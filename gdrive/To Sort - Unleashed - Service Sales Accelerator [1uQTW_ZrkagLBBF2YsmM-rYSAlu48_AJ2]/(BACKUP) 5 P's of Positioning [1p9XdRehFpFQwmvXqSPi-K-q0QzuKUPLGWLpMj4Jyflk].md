# 5P’s of Positioning

## ***Business Purpose & Positioning Deep Dive***

**Goals of this document:** 

* Get more in touch with the problem you or your business solve.   
* Connect the dots to who has the most pain surrounding this problem.  
* Narrow the focus of your energy and business efforts to the people you are most equipped and most passionate about serving. 

**NOTE: For the purposes of the marketing, I’m focused primarily on the software side. I’m open to spinning up the other offers if needed, but I don’t want to get sidetracked with that.**

## **superPOWER**

  **3\. The biggest result we can help someone achieve is… (fill in the blank)** 


  **Software Systems**. Free up their time to keep them from getting buried underneath the business, or so they can spend their time doing what they want to do.

  In the case of manufacturing, we can help them ESCAPE ERP HELL \-- going to the work of implementing a large system that they can’t properly implement, even after sinking in a lot of cost.


  **Business Systems**. Be able to take a task or responsibility and break it down into specific pieces and parts, and be able to successfully hand that off to another team member to take over and manage.


  **Marketing Systems**: Build a lead machine that can get them free leads so they can be in control of their leads as they grow their business.


  

## **PERFECT PATRON**

“Who You Serve” 

**1\. What type of person experiences the most pain from the problem I solve?** 

On the **Software Systems** side, its:

1. A 7-figure custom manufacturing/fabricating/processing company, OR  
2. A larger manufacturing company that’s invested in ERP but can’t get it to work the way that they want  
     
   On the **Business Systems** side, it’s:  
* The owner-operator who’s working themselves silly  
* They’ve tried to delegate, but they’ve done in inefficiently  
    
  On the **Marketing Systems** side, there are a few:  
1. Smaller construction businesses that are wanting to scale  
2. Companies who are dissatisfied with agencies and lead brokers  
3. Larger businesses that want to diversify or lower their lead generation costs  
4. Salespeople in larger businesses that want to increase their earnings  
     
     
     
   **2\. Describe your perfect client in detail?  (If possible, use a favorite past client as a reference point to build this “avatar.”)**   
* Demographic \- Who are they?  
  * Live across the US  
  * Ages ranging from 35-55  
  * Tend to be married and/or with kids  
  * Skews predominantly male  
* Geographic \- where are they?   
  * United States \-- the location honestly doesn’t matter that.  
* Psychographic \- What do they value?   
  * They value efficiency, systems, process, etc.  
  * They value relationships (including family).  
  * They value excellence.


  **3\. Why do you love to serve this particular type of patron?** 


  They want to work strategically, even though they face some perceived constraints around what they’re trying to do.


  **4\. Tell a story about the biggest breakthrough or result you’ve been able to help a client or customer achieve so far?** 


  In **Software Systems**:

* Helped a client take the annual bookkeeping from 8 hours interrupted, to a single hour with interruptions  
* Helped a client drop 8 hours (split across two individuals) down to 5 minutes per week. Helped the same client with another process, dropping it from 8 hours to 1 hour.  
* Helped a client significantly reduce (if not completely eliminate) oversights in their annual government audit  
* Helped a client eliminate a part-time position and reduce the overall team hours, while increasing the value of the business  
    
  In **Business Systems**:  
* Mostly been for myself. For example, being able to hand off parts of the lead generation to a team member without them needing to constantly check in with me  
* Or being able to put together systems to be able to manage my inbox in about 30mins every day \-- without spending a lot of time, organizing, sorting, etc.  
    
  In **Marketing Systems**:  
* Wrote Facebook ads for my brother that went absolutely gangbusters for his precast concrete window well business  
    
  **5\. Does my perfect client detailed above celebrate and need the result I can help them achieve? (Rate on a scale of 1-10 and detail WHY)**   
    
* **Software Systems** \- 7 \- I think so, especially if we’re moving to focusing more on the manufacturing/fabricating/processing space, and especially with the cost bias of “ERP Hell” and the values for efficiency, etc  
* **Business Systems** \- 8 \- I think there’s some really strong value in this one.   
* **Marketing Systems** \- 6 \- This one I’m less sure about, unless it’s more in the construction space. These businesses tend to rely less on marketing (especially depending on the type of business), but it’s quite possible, depending on the specific type of business.

##  **PAINFUL PROBLEM**

**1\. What’s the biggest problem your most ideal client has?**   
Think: What is their most urgent, pressing crisis they have to have solved right away? What is the real pain they’re facing and the thing they need fixed immediately? 

In **Software Systems**:

* They’ve signed a contract with a large software company, where the sales people promise to deliver an outcome, but the software fails to deliver. They first have to pay their staff to go live with the new software. Then they have to hire more staff to make up for the differences. When that fails, they have to pay for an upgrade, which requires back pay subscription fees.

  In **Business Systems**:

* They have lots of business, but so much of their operations are inefficient. Even if they put systems in place, they don’t have a way to manage their projects in a way that works well. (This also applies to Software Systems)  
    
  In **Marketing Systems**:  
* Every time the phone rings, they cringe because they know they paid Houzz/HomeAdvisor/etc for the lead, but it’s not likely a good one.  
* They wake up wondering how they’re going to make the mortgage or make payroll because they’re ineffective with their marketing  
    
  **2\. What are the top 3 things about this problem that are causing your perfect clients regular pain or frustration?**   
    
  In **Software Systems**:  
1. They have a software solution, but the vendor is not cooperating. They’re locking them into a contract, or offering customization but not following through with it. They need to work around missing features or integrate with other software.  
2. They’re in an industry that is underserved with software, and they’re needing to do a lot of work manually.  
   

In **Business Systems**:

* They’re so caught in the whirlwind of reactivity that they’re not able to effectively offload responsibilities.  
* They don’t have time to actually offload the work and because of that, it’s not effective.  
* They try to offload responsibilities to the wrong type of person.

In **Marketing Systems**:

* Agencies who aren’t motivated to give them better leads  
* Lead brokers who won’t qualify leads (and will share them)  
* Traditional advertising that doesn’t work  
* Networking that’s slow, inefficient, and full of people who aren’t movers and shakers  
    
  **3\. What does your perfect client want to avoid at all costs?**   
  *Think: “what keeps them awake at night or makes them fearful or anxious?*   
    
  In software:  
* Knowing that so much of the business rests either on THEM or on one or two key employees (managers, office staff, maybe even themselves), and those employees are severely overworked  
* Realizing that they’ve hit a revenue ceiling because their business systems aren’t good enough to handle growth  
* With ERP Hell, it can be $100K+ sunk into a software system that   
    
  In marketing:  
* Draining all their budget on ineffective marketing  
* Have their competitors get the upper hand with cheaper leads  
    
    
  **4\. What is the cost of staying where they are right now?**   
  Think: How bad can things become if they don’t fix their problem?  
    
  For **Software Systems**:  
* Significant opportunity cost in efficiency and productivity (ineffective planning and reporting)  
* Significant cost in investing in the wrong system (depends one the scale, but easily $250K)  
* Opportunity cost from the gains \-- not able to invest capital into growth.


For **Business Systems:**

* Unable to capitalize on new opportunities (lack of time)  
* Underutilized labor  
    
  For **Marketing Systems**:  
* It could easily cost them $1000+/mo in misallocated marketing investments  
* It could easily cost them $10K+/mo in missed revenue opportunities

  *I don’t remember where I documented this, but I’ve had the idea for a while of using the 80/20 Power Curve (tinyurl.com/compare8020) or Tim Francis’s Know Your Numbers workshop as a lead-in tool for identifying the cost.*


  **5\.  Can the problem be summarized or personified in 1-3 words?** 

  *Ex: [Mayhem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwmpACVxO0)*


  One of the words we’ve been using is:


**Software Systems**: ERP Hell  
**Business Systems**: Busywork  
**Marketing Systems**: 

**6\. What are the 3-5 biggest misconceptions people have about how to SOLVE this problem?**  
*IE: If I could only \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I could fix it.*

With **Software Solutions**:

* Hire the right person (or more people).  
* Set up the right spreadsheet.  
* Find the right coach/consultant.  
* Customize an off the shelf piece of software

With **Business Systems**:

* Hire the right person  
* Have more time  
* Find the right piece of software

With **Marketing Systems**:

* Run the right ads  
* Get the right networking groups  
* Get enough referrals


## **PROMISED LAND**

*“The outcome your perfect patron wants help getting to.”*

**1\. What does your perfect client want more than anything else?**  
(Insert answer here)  
I think this could work for both:

They want a business that runs well by itself, that allows them to be involved as much or as little as they want, and that can continue to grow and scale without sacrificing customer experience or destroying their lives.

**2\.  What is the number ONE *most* important thing they want to accomplish in their life (or business, if your client is more B2B)?**

They want to bring SIMPLICITY back into their business, so they can have the profitability, efficiency, and peace of mind that comes with that\!

**3\. What is it worth to them to get their desired results?**  
Think: What would they be willing to trade, pay or give up in order to get this result? 

We’ve seen consistently that they’re not hesitant to put in the hard work for a future result.

In software, our clients have been willing to pay anywhere from $10-100K to fix this issue (typically hovering around the $30K price point).

**PROVEN PROCESS**  
**1\. If you were in your perfect client’s situation, explain what you would do to solve their problem and get them to their promised land?**   
Share High Level Steps:  'what' you would do, not 'how' to do it.

   **3\. What ‘sacred cows’ do you kill in your approach and process?**

   Think: What makes you different from your competitors?  What industry problems or practices do you stand against? 

   

   For **Software Systems**:

* Doing custom work based on Time & Materials, which usually results in projects being mismanaged and ending up 2-3X over-budget and behind-schedule.  
* Retail providers promising that they can customize, but either won’t or fail when they try.  
* Retail providers get a big sales hit when you sign on, but it’s with a lengthy contract and built on promises of what they deliver, but there’s no incentive from them to keep you happy. In fact, sometimes they’re DIS-incentivized. They have to keep selling to keep developing the software.  
* You just need to wire a few pieces together to get the automation you need to give you a massive boost.  
    
  For **Business Systems**:  
* *Honestly, I have no idea...just some thoughts...*  
* Within the industry, there seems to be little process, especially around hiring  
* There also seems to be a lot of “sink or swim” with training new hires  
* And...a lot of people who are just starting out (and growing) who are disorganized  
    
  For **Marketing Systems**:  
* Selling marketing services that aren’t aligned with their own goals (?)  
* Must build only on referral or networking groups or lead brokers  
* You have to be someone BESIDES yourself to market (?)
