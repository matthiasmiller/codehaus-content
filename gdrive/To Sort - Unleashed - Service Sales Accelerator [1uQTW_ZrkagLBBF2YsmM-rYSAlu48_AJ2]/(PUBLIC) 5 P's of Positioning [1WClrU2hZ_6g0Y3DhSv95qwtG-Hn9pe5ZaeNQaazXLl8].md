**2.1. What type of person experiences the most pain from the problem I solve?** 

A 7-figure custom small business \-- primarily manufacturing/fabricating/processing company

**2.2. Describe your perfect client in detail?  (If possible, use a favorite past client as a reference point to build this “avatar.”)**

  * They value excellence.


  **2.3. Why do you love to serve this particular type of patron?**

##  **PAINFUL PROBLEM**

**3.1. What’s the biggest problem your most ideal client has?**   
Think: What is their most urgent, pressing crisis they have to have solved right away? What is the real pain they’re facing and the thing they need fixed immediately? 

Their business is growing (perhaps beyond what they were ready for). They’re relying on spreadsheets, paper, etc. They’re needing to make educated guesses on purchasing/production. There’s a lot of inefficiencies.

They’ve either looked at or bought retail software, but it simply doesn’t fit what they need it to do. Attempts to develop or customize have fallen short.

**3.2. What are the top 3 things about this problem that are causing your perfect clients regular pain or frustration?** 

1. Cumbersome systems (spreadsheets not quite working, etc)  
2. Double-entry and wasted energy/effort  
3. Not being able to get the data they need to make their business more efficient  
     
   **3.3. What does your perfect client want to avoid at all costs?**   
   *Think: “what keeps them awake at night or makes them fearful or anxious?* 

* Knowing that so much of the business rests either on THEM or on one or two key employees (managers, office staff, maybe even themselves), and those employees are severely overworked  
* Realizing that they’ve hit a revenue ceiling because their business systems aren’t good enough to handle growth  
    
  **3.4. What is the cost of staying where they are right now?**   
  Think: How bad can things become if they don’t fix their problem?  
    
* Significant opportunity cost in efficiency and productivity (ineffective planning and reporting)  
* Significant cost in investing in the wrong system (depends on the scale, but easily $250K)  
* Opportunity cost from the gains \-- not able to invest capital into growth.

  *I don’t remember where I documented this, but I’ve had the idea for a while of using the 80/20 Power Curve (tinyurl.com/compare8020) or Tim Francis’s Know Your Numbers workshop as a lead-in tool for identifying the cost.*


  **3.5.  Can the problem be summarized or personified in 1-3 words?** 

  *Ex: [Mayhem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwmpACVxO0)*


“Duct Type Systems”

**3.6. Tell a story about the most emotionally gripping moment you’ve had in your career related to the problem you solve.**

Because I’ve actually developed financial software for years... 

**3.7. Now share your experience with overcoming that problem or helping a past client overcome it.** 

It really doesn’t have to be this hard.

I’ve got the business AND software experience, with a unique toolset to be able to help other business owners with this.

I was frustrated with Big Box software with no support & industry software that didn’t work as well as I expected.  
I never felt like I was getting what I needed.

**3.8. What other experience do you have that lends credibility to your ability to help them solve this problem?** 

We’ve not only helped manufacturing and construction businesses like yours start fixing their profitability...  
We’ve actually PROVEN it ourselves with a price guarantee (rare in this industry). 

**3.9. What are the 3-5 biggest misconceptions people have about how to SOLVE this problem?**  
*IE: If I could only \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I could fix it.*

* Hire more staff  
* Set up the right spreadsheets.  
* Set up integrations  
* Customize an off the shelf piece of software


## **PROMISED LAND**

*“The outcome your perfect patron wants help getting to.”*

**4.1. What does your perfect client want more than anything else?**  
(Insert answer here)

They want a business that runs well by itself, that allows them to be involved as much or as little as they want, and that can continue to grow and scale without sacrificing customer experience or destroying their lives.

**4.2.  What is the number ONE *most* important thing they want to accomplish in their life (or business, if your client is more B2B)?**

They want to bring SIMPLICITY back into their business, so they can have the profitability, efficiency, and peace of mind that comes with that\!

**4.3. What is it worth to them to get their desired results?**  
Think: What would they be willing to trade, pay or give up in order to get this result? 

We’ve seen consistently that they’re not hesitant to put in the hard work for a future result.

In software, our clients have been willing to pay anywhere from $10-100K to fix this issue (typically hovering around the $30K price point).

**4.4. What bold and specific result could you promise your perfect patron will get from your service if they had the problem you’re best at solving?** 

* **Bold and Specific Promise:**   
  * Quantitative Result:   
  * Qualitative Impact: 

**PROVEN PROCESS**  
**5.1. If you were in your perfect client’s situation, explain what you would do to solve their problem and get them to their promised land?**   
Share High Level Steps:  'what' you would do, not 'how' to do it.

* One Roof (“under one roof)  
* One Click (“automation”)  
* One Tool (“All Numbers” \-- “being able to slice and dice”)

**See 6.6**

**5.2. Now break this down to the 3-5 necessary steps you’ll walk them through that will get them to THEIR finish line?**  
Note: *these are likely the core elements of your offer and/or proven process.* 

1. Discover \- draw out from them what it is that they really want  
2. Describe \- flesh out the details   
3. Deploy \- integrate the finished system into your business

   **5.3. What ‘sacred cows’ do you kill in your approach and process?**

   Think: What makes you different from your competitors?  What industry problems or practices do you stand against? 

   

* Doing custom work based on Time & Materials, which usually results in projects being mismanaged and ending up 2-3X over-budget and behind-schedule.  
* Retail providers promising that they can customize, but either won’t or fail when they try.  
* Retail providers get a big sales hit when you sign on, but it’s with a lengthy contract and built on promises of what they deliver, but there’s no incentive from them to keep you happy. In fact, sometimes they’re DIS-incentivized. They have to keep selling to keep developing the software.  
* You just need to wire a few pieces together to get the automation you need to give you a massive boost.  
* You should just use a spreadsheet  
  **5.4. Is there a guarantee you can make them that will take away their risk and give them confidence your process can deliver?**   
* Guarantee:   
    
  **5.6. Does your proven process have different tiers or packages available at different price points?**   
    
  (If so, outline how you see them below)   
* **Tier 1 | (Insert HIGH TIER Service)**  
  * Avg Cost To Fulfill On This Tier:  
  * Key selling point of this tier:   
  * Average Price Point:  
* **Tier 2 | (Insert MID TIER Service)**  
  * Avg Cost To Fulfill On This Tier:  
  * Key selling point of this tier:   
  * Average Price Point:  
* **Tier 3 | (Insert LOW TIER Service)**  
  * Avg Cost To Fulfill On This Tier:  
  * Key selling point of this tier:   
  * Average Price Point:

  **5.6. Using a bullet list below, brainstorm on the three key systems in your proven process below:**

* **Onboarding Process:** What are the first couple steps you would take to onboard them as a client?   
  * \-  
  * \-  
  * \-  
* **Support Channels:** How do they contact you and communicate with you throughout your proven process?  
  * \-  
  * \-  
  * \-  
* **Key Features:** What else do they get as a client that adds even more perceived value to your proven process?

## **5 P SUMMARIES \- “*How We communicate YOUR POSITIONING succinctly”*** 

Now we need to summarize each of your 5 P’s into a nice, succinct statement. As best as you can, try to sum up your answers in each of the 5 Sections above into one succinct statement below: 

**6.1 | Our Superpower:** 

* **Vs. Retail Software Vendor**  
  * Differentiator \#1: understand your specific problem and find the best way to address it (vs. selling based on vast feature set)  
  * Differentiator \#2: ability to get any kind of report on any piece of information (vs. tweaking columns)  
  * Differentiator \#3: help you find the best way to get your job done, so you don’t need to fight software or learn difficult ways of getting things done  
* **Vs. Freelance Developer** *(not our competitors; deferring for now)*  
  * Differentiator \#1:   
  * Differentiator \#2:   
  * Differentiator \#3:    
* **Vs. Themselves** (I can do it with spreadsheets, or between and my employees)  
  * Differentiator \#1: expertise in organizing information and building systems, and it’s central to our business (vs. them, who don’t have spreadsheet expertise)  
  * Differentiator \#2:   
  * Differentiator \#3:  


  simple business tools to manage all the moving parts

**6.2 | Our Perfect Patron:** (Insert succinct statement) 

* Qualifier \#1: Run a 7-figure construction or manufacturing business  
* Qualifier \#2: Want to do it right the first time, build predictable growth, and lead self-directed employees  
* Qualifier \#3: Be in a position to invest into streamlining your business and improving your systems

**6.3 | Their Painful Problem:** The Guesstimate Game 

* Pain \#1: You feel scattered.  
* Pain \#2: You’re wasting time.  
* Pain \#3: You’re flying blind.  
* **Root Issue:** 

  quietly bleeding cash

Also:

* constantly fighting with the numbers

**6.4 | Misconceptions About Solving This Problem**

Misconception \#1 | If I step out of the business, everything will come to a grinding halt.

* Explain why it’s false: While this might be true of your business now, many businesses like yours have successfully made this shift once they got past the early stage.  
* Share the Truth: You take everything that’s in your head, and you can turn it into a system that someone else can successfully run, and you don’t have to be there to make it happen.

Problem 2- Flying Blind  
Misconception \#1 | My business has grown more than I expected, I’m not completely sure how I got here, and it feels like it’s about to fall apart.

* Explain why it’s false: Your business has grown because you’ve been doing what you’re good at, and as long as you continue that, it will continue to grow.  
* Share the Truth: The real place you need to focus is getting help in the places that you don’t enjoy. You can get help building systems to support the growth of your business.

***In their shoes \-- imagine if I got into business because I want to do designs, and now i need to do testing to keep up...but if I do that, I can’t do designs...and every time the phone rings, I get anxious because there’s more than I can do already…(and I’m making good money, but I’m starting to associate money with anxiety)***

**Put misconceptions in the first person**  
**This is all about narrative and stories they tell themselves**

Custom software is only for the big companies that can afford it.  
There’s no all-in-one solution that does what we need to do.  
They’re feeling stressed and frustrated…

* If only my employees would just work harder

They don’t understand that we’re only as good as the sysmtes  
The more my business grows, the busier and more stressful it will be.  
They may be self-consckously self-sabotaging their growth because they’re concerned about the work that they’re going to need to do.  
Can lean on the unleashed CEO angle \-- hey, I want to empower you to be like the CEO, and in order to do that, we need to free you up from working on minimum wage tasks, and one way to dso that outside of a hire, is just to create better systems in your business to automate. That alone will free up your time to be the empowered CEO that you deserve to be.  
I can’t take time for vacation, because things are oging to fall apart.  
I need to work nights and weekends, or   
I need to stop the business for a day to catch up  
I’ll focus on improving my systems as soon as I get caught up.  
As soon as I get through this next batch, Ill be at peace, or I’ll be able to take a breath (but they’ve been telling   
**You can’t outwork a bad system.**

* They’ll jyst kjeeo adding more things  
* You need to carve off time, and we’re going to create a system that works for you not against you and automates those tasks

**Example client story \-** Jeff was working nights and weekends, and tried for a year and could never get ahead of it, after partnering with us, within 60 days, he went from working an extra 8 hours, to spend time with his family and enjoy it without paperwork

Flying blind,...  
I’ve built this thing, how will this all hold together, and will it all fly apart  
And they end up self-sabotaging it

**Write an email on this template and do some social posts**

* 

Misconception \#? | Software is hard to use, and it’s better just to hire office staff to deal with it.

* Explain why it’s false: Software is sometimes hard to use, but just hiring someone to fix the problem won’t help if you don’t have the right tools  
* Share the Truth: 

Misconception \#? | Software is expensive, and I’d rather just hire someone to take care of it.

* Explain why it’s false: Hiring someone without giving them the right tools is like hiring a carpenter but not letting him use a hammer. Even the best office staff can’t win without the right tools.  
* Share the Truth: When you have the right software, it will help your team member 

Misconception \#1 | It’s better to get a retail solution, because they’ve thought about everything that goes into it.

* Explain why it’s false: Retail software is built on the law of averages--what most people need the most. While many businesses share similar patterns, every business is unique and has unique challenges.  
* Share the Truth: Retail software is often a good place to start for a small startup. However, it’s often unable to accommodate 

Misconception \#2 | If I pick the right software, it will magically improve my bottom line.

* Explain why it’s false: We’ve all seen people buy software and see almost zero benefit (sometimes even NEGATIVE benefit). This is because software is just one part of the puzzle.  
* Share the Truth: The real savings come from simple, repeatable processes in your business. Then you accelerate it by using software to make it faster and easier to manage those processes. 

Misconception \#3 | I can trust a team of developers to implement a CRM, especially if they’re certified.

* Explain why it’s false: It’s not uncommon for businesses to spend $100-250K on a CRM implementation, only to have to cancel or redo the project. Development is only a small part of the project.  
* Share the Truth: To successfully roll out a CRM, you must have clarity about what you’re looking to achieve, and you need to have the right people in the right seat of the bus along the way.
