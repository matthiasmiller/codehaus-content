# **RightFit Software Assessment**

## Introduction

What is the best software to use for your business? With the many options that are available, it’s hard to know where to start.

The RightFit Software Assessment is a tool we’ve developed to help business owners know what to look for. This tool will enable you to find the software that will give you the greatest value for your business.

Use this assessment to create three lists:

1. Critical Features \- the tools that will have a dramatic impact on your business. Without them, your business will suffer or stall.  
2. Important Features \- the tools that will have a significant impact  
3. Nice Features \- the tools that will positively improve your business, but aren’t the \#1 priority or require other changes to be made first

You can make this list by either marking up this document, or by filling out the worksheet that’s included in this document.

You can either work through this assessment from start to finish, or you can choose to focus on a specific area first.

## Marketing

A reliable marketing system is the foundation of every business. Your marketing system should enable you to continue one-to-many conversations with your target audience.

You may be familiar with marketing platforms such as Hubspot, Clickfunnels, or Mailchimp. These are many other widely-known marketing platforms.

These platforms have exceptional tools for marketing automation. For many businesses, it makes the most sense to run their marketing on these platforms, while integrating them into the rest of their business process.

Let’s take a look at a few key features.

With the proper integration, you can prioritize inbound leads that are most likely to convert. This keeps your sales team from wasting time with people who are least likely to buy. This is especially important if:

* You’ve maxed out your sales team’s ability to follow up on all your leads.  
* You’d drown your sales team if you turned on your marketing all the way.  
* Your business has a very time-consuming follow-up process for your leads.

This also allows your sales team to immediately respond to your leads when they’re most interested in your product or business.

This also allows you to customize your marketing to prospects after they have a personal conversation with your team members. This allows their marketing to reflect the conversation they had with your sales team.

This allows you to maintain one-to-many communication with your existing customers. For example, you can change how you communicate based on the type of product they purchase. This is important if:

* You have many customers you need to stay in contact with.  
* You have many different types of customers in your business.  
* Each customer tends to have consistent buying habits.  
* You communicate with people differently after the first time they buy from you.

By tying specific ads to specific sales, you can identify which ads yield the best customers. For example, you might identify that Facebook is getting you more business than local print ads. Alternatively, you might discover that addressing one benefit of your product brings higher quality leads than another benefit. This is important if:

* You advertise your business in multiple places, or you want to test advertising in additional places.  
* You use or test multiple ad formats for reaching people.  
* You use or test multiple messages to communicate your business’s value. (This can include different benefits, discounts, offers, guarantees, etc.)

If you are using a website to collect leads (or purchases), this allows you to reflect current inventory and pricing. It even allows you to automatically calculate pricing for custom products.
