**Subject**: Manufacturing Efficiency Guides

Dear Matthias,

I just wanted to let you know that our operational consulting guys have finished writing three convenient guides about manufacturing efficiency and I'll be happy to send you a Free copy if you reply back:

\- “Streamlining Your Manufacturing Business” explains the mental model for effectively evaluating your operations, as well as the three filters to use to streamline your operations.

\- “Risk Free Delegation” deals with the critical qualities of a successful process, as well simple, achievable steps to start getting immediate results to free up your time and focus.

\- "Escaping ERP Hell” goes in-depth into the process of enterprise software, why it fails to meet objectives, and what to do to ensure that it delivers on its promises.

Again, these guides are Free, all you have to do is reply back with your choices, and I'll send you one or more guides in PDF format.

Best success with your current manufacturing project,  
Matthias

PS: Just so you know, I'm personally sending this message. It's not a robot, so I'll see any replies and you won’t get bombarded with messages. ;-)
