# 3 Steps to Successfully Streamline Any Business

## Introduction: When Faster Isn’t Easier

Aaron runs an 11-person truss shop. He spent ten years working for his father, starting from the very bottom, learning the ins and outs of the business, and slowly working his way towards buying out the business.

The business has continued to grow. In fact, Aaron sometimes feels guilty that he’s not spending as much time with his family as he’d like. He admitted to his wife, “Sometimes I wish I could go back to the way things were.”

He’s grateful for a thriving business. However, it’s come at a price. As it has grown, it’s become increasingly difficult to manage. He’s been caught between phone calls, following up on misquoted jobs, scheduling deliveries, meeting the order deadlines, and last (but certainly not least) staying on top of their inventory.

Most days, when he walks through the front door of his home, his body is still trying to catch up with his racing mind. It’s difficult to block out the things that require his attention and follow-up. He doesn’t give his wife and family the attention he knows they deserve. His health is suffering.

“A fast-growing business should be without trouble, right?” Aaron used to think so.

However, work has become such a haze that he’s having trouble finding exactly the pieces he needs to change.

## A Simple Distinction to Clear the Fog

As Aaron looked for ways to simplify his business, it was important for him to make a distinction between the activities that were important and the ones that weren’t.

Every business has two types of activities:

1. The essentials  
2. The incidentals

The essentials are the foundation of the business. Without them, the business doesn’t exist. Unless Aaron’s crew produces trusses, there’s nothing for his contractors to buy\!

As they work to produce these trusses, however, they have other things they must do. They need to manage their inventory, bill their customers, and make sure they meet the delivery deadlines. While it’s not part of the core of the business, it’s also not possible for the business to thrive without it\!

To regain control of his time and business, Aaron must find a way to focus his and the crew’s time on the **essentials** of business, rather than getting caught in the **incidentals**.

Fortunately for Aaron, he didn’t have to figure this out alone.

## Clear the Rubble to Make Room to Scale 

When Aaron had gotten into the business, he lived his life by a simple rule: “work hard, work long, and make things happen”. This had worked well when he had specific trusses he needed to build. However, as he grew the business, he often felt under-equipped to help his team members. In fact, these same behaviors that helped him initially were now getting in his way\!

When he got the invitation to attend a local business seminar, he hesitated to take off from his business. His wife, though not well-versed in the business, knew instinctively that the time away from the shop would do him good.

He reluctantly registered for the event, wondering what someone who didn’t have a truss shop could possibly share to help him.

However, as the first speaker began to share, Aaron’s attitude began to change. He reached for the pen and pad he’d gotten at registration and began taking notes.

He discovered three important questions he must ask about the things that he does:[^1]

1. Can I eliminate this task?  
2. Can I automate this task?  
3. Can I delegate this task?

Just then, his phone buzzed with a text message from his foreman. Should he take it, or should he not? He decided against it. He’d call him back later.

He tuned in just in time to hear the speaker’s admonition.

“If you answer ‘no’ to all the questions, you must start the process over. You have to go through this process *twice* before you conclude you’re the only one who can do it. Remember, your time as a business owner is *valuable*, and every distraction can cost you significantly in the major decisions you make.

He leaned forward in his chair, drinking in every word. The speaker continued to explain.

“Every power tool has a motor--a little piece that spins in circles that drives everything else forward. In the same way, your business is full of many little things that happen over and over. It has dozens (if not hundreds) of tasks that must be repeated on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. When you begin to see these pieces, you can start to find what you can change in your business.”

That’s when the speaker began to explain the first question.

## “Can I Eliminate This Task?”

It was so much for him to take in, but Aaron felt the lightbulbs turning on.

The speaker continued, “It doesn’t matter if you have the most powerful saw in the world. If it’s not touching a piece of wood, nothing gets cut\! Many times, we have pieces of our business that are moving, but not doing anything to help the business.”

“No wonder,” Aaron thought. “That’s why I feel like I’m spinning my wheels...because I’m doing things that don’t move anything forward.”

Aaron began to think about the bustling activity on the shop floor. His mind wandered to the piles of paperwork that continually accumulated on this desk. As he reflected, he began to realize that he’d taken on some habits from his father. He’d never given time to consider whether these habits actually served them. Some of the paperwork really wasn’t necessary.

He began sketching out the process on his pad. “If I moved *this* around, we could skip doing *that*.” He started a list of things to discuss with his foreman.

He felt so grateful his wife had forced him to come here that he almost missed the speaker introducing the second question.

## “Can I Automate This Task?”

The speaker continued, “Automation is the difference between a hand tool and a power tool. When you have a hand saw, you have to keep moving it back and forth to cut the wood. But when you have a power saw, you simply plug it into a power outlet or compressor hose. Everything else takes care of itself.”

“Business software,” he said, “is the same way. Your CNC makes sure all the measurements happen. Business software makes sure that all of your **incidentals** happen.”

Aaron was confused. It was easy to understand the router. However, the software still didn’t make sense. He timidly raised his hand. “Can you explain what you mean? Do you have an example?”

“Sure,” the speaker replied. “Imagine that someone places an order. How do you make sure that order doesn’t get misplaced? How do you make sure you have the inventory? How do you know when to follow up with the customer?”

“Sure, you can print out paper copies. However, if you have software, you can do your inventory calculations automatically. You can even send the client an email, fax, or SMS when the order is complete\!”

Aaron’s mind still was still spinning. He didn’t understand everything that was possible, but this much he *did* understand:

If his crew didn’t have to worry about these things (or they couldn’t mess these things up\!), he could free up more of their time for the **essentials**\--building trusses. And he could spend more time on what he needed to do--focus on leading and growing the business\!

Aaron had a lot more questions, but he knew he didn’t have time to ask them all. He jotted a note to ask them later.

He was curious how the speaker would handle the next question.

## “Can I Delegate This Task?”

The speaker began with a statement that made Aaron squirm. “It’s important that you remember that you’re the most important person in the business.”

Aaron flinched. He wasn’t sure he agreed with the speaker. He wasn’t in business to stoke his ego, but he decided to wait until he’d heard this out. 

“What happens when you lose focus in your business? What happens when you make a bad decision? If it’s one of your crew, it might mean an unhappy customer. If you’re too distracted, it might mean posting a loss for your business, or even needing to lay off team members.”

“This is why it’s important to get the help you need from your team,” the speaker explained

Aaron spun his pen through his fingers. He’d never thought of it that way before, but it made a lot of sense.

“Think of it like this,” the speaker continued. “When you want to make sure you get the same cut, the same hole, the same finished product, you create a jig or you program your router. In the same way, when you delegate to your employees, you want to make sure that they know exactly what to do.”

“And more than that, you want to make sure the process *guides* them to do the right thing. Just like a jig. Many times, when your team members make mistakes, it’s because you haven’t created the right guide for them.”

Aaron spent the rest of the day filling his notebook with tidbits of wisdom. As he walked out of the conference room that evening, he felt relieved that he’d listened to his wife and taken the day off.

Maybe the things he learned today could help him take more time off in the future\!

## Using These Tools to Scale

While the story of Aaron is purely fictional, the truths that he discovered are proven. They can be used to streamline any process. These are the same results we’ve walked our clients through as we’ve helped them build custom software solutions to help them scale their business.

We’ve helped clients like you build custom software solutions to:

* Track important interactions with clients  
* Easily view and prioritize competing priorities for your team  
* Clearly identify the person currently responsible for a specific project  
* Ensure critical projects are on time and done well  
* Protect important information from being lost between team members  
* Highlight specific areas that require your attention

These tools streamline your processes and eliminate costly mistakes in three ways.

First of all, a custom software solution allows you to **prioritize your projects**, ensuring that you spend your resources on your most important projects. The most expensive mistake is not usually a tactical error, but rather a strategic error of focusing resources on the wrong project or wrong types of projects. This kind of tool can provide a high-level view of your projects, enabling you to prioritize more effectively.

Second, a custom software solution **prevents avoidable mistakes** by centralizing the important details of each job and creating user-friendly processes to keep your team from overlooking important steps. By integrating this into the workflow, you can ensure consistency and efficiency without micromanaging your team.

Finally, a custom software solution allows you to **measure your projects**. By reviewing the profitability of specific jobs, you can identify the best and worst jobs, and continue to refine your business processes to improve profitability.
