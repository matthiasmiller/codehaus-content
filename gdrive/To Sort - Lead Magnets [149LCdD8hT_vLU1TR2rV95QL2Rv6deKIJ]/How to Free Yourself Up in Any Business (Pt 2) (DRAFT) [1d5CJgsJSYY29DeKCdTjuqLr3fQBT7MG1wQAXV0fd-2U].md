# How to Free Yourself Up in Any Business, Part II

## *An Intercepted Letter That Reveals the Two Unchanging Principles That Have Freed Up Our Clients Time After Time*

Dear Larry,

It was great to hear from you the other day\!

My mind rolled back quite a few years. Do you remember when you kept waking up in the middle of the night wondering, “Will I be able to pay my mortgage? Will I be able to make payroll?”

How things have changed\!

Now you’ve got new (and bigger\!) challenges. It’s worth celebrating where you’re at\! You’ve made it through a tough patch that many others haven’t been able to navigate.

The question now becomes, “Where to go from here?” You mentioned that you feel the weight of the business on your shoulders. You want to do more things with your family and in your community.

This is a **common problem** and it’s a **deeply felt pain**. You can turn many different directions for support on facing this problem. Some of these will work quite well for you. Others will look promising, but they’ll fail to deliver. As you consider options, I have one word of advice.

There’s no magic pill.

I’m not going to sugarcoat it. Finding your way forward requires work, focus, and dedication. Anything that promises less than that is only addressing a symptom, not the root problem.

The good news?

If you’re willing to put in the work, this problem is completely solvable.

Let’s start with your first question:

**“How do I redirect the questions I receive?”**  
You mentioned that you get bombarded with questions. You wondered about finding someone else to take your place.

This can be an excellent solution, as long as you keep a few things in mind. First of all, the less your business depends on a single person, the better it is for everyone\! They can go on vacation without being bothered, and you can sleep at night knowing that you’ve got options if they decide to leave.

If you’re not careful, you can end up with the same bottleneck as before. Instead, all the knowledge is in a key employee's head, not yours\!

One gentleman admitted his entire operation rode on a manager who was consistently working 60-hour weeks. Nobody knows when the manager’s wife will hit her limit of late dinners, short weekends, and a husband who dozes off when he should be helping with the children. As soon as her husband decides to take a pay cut and find another job so he can spend more time with the family, the game is over.

The root problem isn’t necessarily **lack of people**, and it’s not even **lack of knowledge**. All the information you need exists in the business *somewhere*, even if it’s in someone’s head. The issue you’re trying to solve is **visibility to the knowledge**.

Some of the information is in your head. Some of it is under a pile of papers. Some of it got lost on the job site.

The more that you can centralize this, the more efficient your business will become. There’s no “single right way” to solve this, but I can give you some examples.

* Ryan (name changed) wanted more visibility in his production and delivery schedule. Recently, we helped him put a 4K touchscreen in his office with live updates on daily and weekly production counts, as well as the delivery schedule.

* Jared (name changed) had documents spread across multiple desks across the state. When someone called for information, nobody knew *for sure* what the accurate story was. We helped bring all that information under one roof. It was a major time investment for him. He told us later, “You worked me out of a job\!”

We do this internally as well.

We create checklists. We document procedures. We schedule reminders. We develop training. We have multiple people involved in projects. Anyone can check in on the progress of any job, and they can see exactly what’s going on.

While it takes a little bit longer to create this, it gives us the freedom to cover for each other.

It also frees us all from the crippling bane of micromanagement.

This answer ties into your next question:

**“How do I keep all the trains running on time?”**

You mentioned a second frustration of keeping all the trains running on time. It’s a big slow down when questions have to go through you. However, you can take this further.

People need to know exactly what to do, and when to do it. Everything in your business can be broken down into steps. For example:

1. What steps do you take when a customer calls in?  
2. What steps do you take to put together a quote?  
3. What steps do you take to fill an order?

If you’re having trouble with breaking down a task into steps, have someone watch what you’re doing and ask you questions. Then, have *them* write down what you’re doing. Next, turn the tables and have someone else follow along with what they wrote. See what they missed, and fill in the details.

As you’re doing that, one of you might notice you’re doing some things the hard way. Getting these things down on paper where you can see them can be a huge boost in finding inefficiencies.

Once you’ve got the steps nailed down, you can start setting objectives.

* How many calls should you be getting every week?  
* How long should it take to do a job?  
* How much time should be going into each job?  
* How far are you booked out?

Once you’ve got clear steps for each part of your business, you’ll know what success needs to look like. Then you can start putting accountability into place.

Peter (name changed) owns an agricultural repair shop. When we started working with him, he could only guess whether he hit his estimates for each project. He didn’t know when his mechanics would be available to start projects. He built out a process for tracking incoming jobs, time spent on each job, and billing for completed jobs. He freed up mental headspace, and was able to consider other suggested improvements.

One warning, though.

When people hear of these outcomes, they sometimes try to skip a step. Rather than spend the time trying to figure out their business process, they jump straight to a certain system. It might be:

* A planning system  
* A scheduling system  
* An inventory system  
* An estimating system

Until you know what your process *should* be, you’ll never know whether the system will actually help you do what you need it to.

We helped Faith Builders develop a solution to manage their scholarship funds. When we started the project with Vivian Mast, our first priority was to understand the *process* behind scholarship management. Once we were able to understand the process, we could build the systems we needed to facilitate that.

Because she did the hard work first, Vivian cut her annual review process from **eight hours (without distractions) to one hour (including multiple interruptions)**. Since then, she’s been able to start sharing her responsibilities with a team member. This is a big win not only for Vivian personally, but also for Faith Builders as an organization.

This leads us to the final question you asked.

**“Where do I even start?”**

To help you know where to start, I want to walk you through a simple diagnostic. First, let me try to summarize what I shared.

The two primary challenges we see people like you facing are:

* Lack of shared knowledge  
* Lack of clear process

If you don’t have shared knowledge, you’ll end up having a few people being the slow down for the entire business. If you don’t have a clear process, you’ll end up needing to micromanage everything.

I’ve laid this out in the simple Streamlined Business Quadrant.  
![][image1]  
To self-diagnose, you can approach this quadrant in two ways. The first way is by looking *inside* the quadrant. Ask yourself these questions:

* What parts of the business are inefficient?  
* What parts of the business need to be micromanaged?

The second way is by looking *outside* the quadrant. Ask yourself these questions:

* Where is information hiding in my business?  
* Where are the steps unclear in my business?

Take time to sit down and write out the answers to these questions. This will help you pinpoint the one or two areas in your business to focus for immediate wins.

Once you’ve done that, I encourage you to reach out to Ian to process what you’ve found. He’s the first point of contact for all our clients. He helps them nail down their focus, what they want to accomplish, and take a look at the best path to get there.

Here’s the best way to reach him:

	**Phone**: (620) 209-4250 (ask to schedule an appointment with Ian)  
**Fax**: (620) 301-8083 (include information about your general availability)  
**Email**: [ian.miller@codehaus.com](mailto:ian.miller@codehaus.com)  
**Calendar**: [https://calendly.com/ian-miller-ch/call-with-ian](https://calendly.com/ian-miller-ch/call-with-ian)

Again, I want to congratulate you on getting this far in your business. What you’re about to embark on isn’t easy, but I think you’ll find it to be well worth it\!

Regards,  
Matthias Miller
