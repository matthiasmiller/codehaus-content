# **Uncontrollable Forces**

Most people spend their lives fighting forces they can’t control. The most successful people I know are able to leverage natural forces for their own benefit and gain. This is going to be my attempt to show you as many of these as possible, for your maximum benefit.

Earlier this year, I spent a week at an under-the-radar marketing conference discussing how to beat Facebook and Google’s heavy hand. If you land on the wrong side of these giants, they’ll knock you down.

Most people dance with forces that are more powerful than themselves. When they succeed, they credit themselves. When they fail, they blame someone else.

It’s completely okay to leverage uncontrollable forces–but you’d better make sure you know when the tailwind is going to turn into a tsunami.

The more that you stop trying to exert control over your environment, and tap into the Uncontrollable Forces around you, the more success you’re going to enjoy.

Let’s take a look at a few.

## Money & Markets

In every economy, certain segments of the market are on a rapid uptick. Others are rapidly declining. Then, you have the vast majority of the market that’s merely average.

The most recent example (at the time of this writing) is crypto-currency. Many people made lots of money both investing and teaching others how to invest. The people who were able to capture this Uncontrollable Force and ride it to the top did quite well.

On the other hand, we see what Amazon has done to bookstores and other retail businesses. During the pandemic, consumer demand for buying online skyrocketed. You don’t have enough fingers on one hand to count the number of major box stores that closed their doors over the past number of years.

While it’s beyond the scope of this article, if you can create a superior product, it is possible to create an unstoppable force that tilts the market into your favor. However, you are not forcing consumers to come your way. You’re simply harnessing another Unstoppable Force that turns the tables.

## Personal Motivation

At the core of who you are, you have a very small handful of things that deeply motivate you. High performance comes from leveraging as many of these as you possibly can.

Yesterday, I was on the phone with a client who was 7 minutes late. Meanwhile, my assistant and I were waiting on the call with our prepared agenda, ready for the meeting to start. My client clearly struggles with showing up to meetings on time, wants to change his behaviors, and is doing that by being more focused. However, he has a highly reactive personality. 

I, too, have a highly reactive personality. Rather than fight that, I hired a full-time executive assistant who builds meeting agendas, takes notes, and reminds me where to be at what time. 

It is far better to structure your environment so that it naturally drives you to where you want to go, rather than constantly fighting yourself.

## Advertising

Advertising is about truth-telling. It’s about finding alignment between your product and what consumers are looking for.

Persuasion and influence is as much about getting people to what *they* want, and allowing them to make the connection between what they want and the product or service you offer.

Trying to use sales and marketing tactics without this foundational alignment creates resistance, not buying incentive.

## Likability

People like people who are like themselves.

## Leadership

People who talk the most tend to be promoted to leadership.
