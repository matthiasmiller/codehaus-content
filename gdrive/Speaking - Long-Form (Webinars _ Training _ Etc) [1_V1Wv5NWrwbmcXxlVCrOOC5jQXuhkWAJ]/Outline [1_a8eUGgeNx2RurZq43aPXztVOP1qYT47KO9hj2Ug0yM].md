# Notes from Christian Linhart

Interesting use of pair programming for developers with strong "live" communication.  
I never really understood the usefulness of pair programming, but this makes sense.  
In a broader sense we need to learn that specific methods are not for everybody. Different people need different methods.  
(Just as nutrition is subjective. Just because some food is good for the author of a new diet hype doesn't mean that it is universally applicable for everybody.)

FocusMate would drive me insane and destroy my productivity. Clearly not for somebody like me who prefers "recorded" and who needs to eliminate all distractions and have open-end time in order to be productive.

To your question where I have seen strong "live" developers excel in the software space:  
I am not sure whether I have seen any of those excel in software development.  
But I have some experience, both myself and others, with developers that have a somewhat useful level of "live" even though "recorded" is probably their primary mode:  
Discussing requirements with customers.  
When I was still an employee I took over a project as technical project manager (as a fire-fighting measure).  
One of the first things was a live meeting with customers which clearly showed that nobody has understood customer requirements at all.  
I fixed that in one (or multiple) live meetings.  
This certainly has needed some level of live communication skills.

If you have customers that prefer live communication, then that's the only way to get the requirements clarified.  
Non-developers often don't know what kind of questions to ask etc.  
So they'll never get useful requirements out of customers.  
So, you need a developer with some reasonable level of live communication skills and some experience with architecture and requirements-engineering.

Discussing architecture with other developers.  
I know some developers who are quite good at live discussions of architectural stuff.  
I participated sometimes, but I don't really like it that much because there's not enough time for thinking.  
I prefer discussing architecture by email (or sending a architecture document back and forth).

My opinion on architecture is that this should mostly be done by one single capable engineer without too many discussions. (only him/her asking others when needed for coordination)  
And then going through a review process.

If several engineers do architecture as peers this usually leads to endless discussions and in the end, it can happen that the architecture of the most obnoxious/annoying guy/gal wins because the others are tired of the drama and just give in even when they think that it is a bad architecture. (opposite of 80/20: high cost, low quality result).  
The engineers who were good in "live" and not so strong at "recorded" usually have gravitated towards other occupations after a while, such as   
field engineers  
sales  
product management (requirements engineering)  
middle management (leading a development department)  
They usually weren't great developers anyway, but some of them were quite talented for their new roles.

The worst developer I have experienced was quite talented in making presentations and in making suggestions of improving work processes for the whole company.  
That's were he became passionate. He even volunteered for these tasks proactively.  
With software development he was very slow and almost non-productive. He also surfed the web a lot when he was supposed to do software development.  
And he distracted others with lots of questions, because he even didn't know how to do the stuff he claimed to have experience with.  
So his net productivity contribution to the software development team was significantly negative.  
I am not sure whether this can be fully explained with live vs recorded, but in hindsight it probably was a significant component.  
Chris  
P.S.: Many developers are quite good and happy at live chatting in a non-work setting. (e.g. meeting in a restaurant with or without beer, or lunch break or other breaks, ...)  
I.e. to get the team be connected on a personal level, inviting them to a restaurant or so in a relaxed atmosphere from time to time is usually a lot better than work-meetings.
