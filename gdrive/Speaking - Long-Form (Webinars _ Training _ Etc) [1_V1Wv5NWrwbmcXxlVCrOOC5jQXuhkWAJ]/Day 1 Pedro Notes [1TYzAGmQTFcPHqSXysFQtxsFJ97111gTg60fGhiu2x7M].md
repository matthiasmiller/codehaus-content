3. Why?  
   1. If you are a passionate, mission-driven entrepreneur…  
   2. You do not have to sacrifice fulfillment on the altar of financial gain  
   3. How to find fulfillment, how to end imposter syndrome, end the comparison trap, etc  
   4. You’re here, and you need to walk them out  
   5. The people who are the most on-fire, passionate, happy, going places, are either leading a movement or part of a movement (or both)  
   6. Nonprofit \-- this is one of the best value adds you can give to a donor  
4. You are not called to THE world. You are called to YOUR world.

   1. Take a stand for and/or against something  
   2. People united in a shared interest / passion

         2. Followers to leadership  
         3. From members to members  
   4. Self-governed by a culture of shared values and principles  
      1. If it grows beyond you, it must have a culture that creates self-governance.  
      2. Self-government is the highest form of government  
   5. Money is not the point of a movement  
      1. While they need it and are accelerated by it, they are not built for money.  
      2. Movements are about PEOPLE not a PERSON (this is not about a guru)  
6. Movement dynamics  
   1. Movements require **passion**  
   2. Movements have a restlessness, a sense of urgency, that gets people to move now.  
      1. Movements understand the now.  
      2. Understand the past, present, and the future (where thye want to go)  
      3. Movements help people get mobilized and take action in the now.  
      4. Restlestness around this problem/issue  
      5. Movements that grow are great at making people make a decision now \-- are you for us, or against us?  
   3. Movements seeking to eliminate a strain...there is a clearly articulated dissatisfaction with a specific problem  
      1. They focus on SPECIFIC problems  
      2. Most people are very general \-- being floodlights not laser beams  
      3. I will wrestle for the words to clearly articulate the problem that our movement is taking a stand against.  
   4. Movements bring freedom from an injustic…  
7. There is “Movement” or “movement”  
   1. \>\>\> The author Clay Shirky has observed that **new communications technology** coupled with a growing desire to engage and make a statement is resulting in “the most radical spread of expressive capability in human history.” Much of that human expression is happening in groups engaged in what Shirky calls “shared endeavors”. Or to think of it another way, what we’re seeing is an explosion of movements, some large and some very small.  
   2. Movements are not going away anytime soon   
   3. Movement Quadrant  
      1. Public vs. Personal  
      2. Small vs. Large  
   4. Some breakdown:  
      1. Rosa was not the first person to resist, and YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE THE FIRST PERSON. You might be the BEST person, or the WILLING person. Be the first person to say yes and be willing.  
      2. Sometimes leading a movement will require you to be somewhat controversial.  
      3. “I don’t have to be the first person. I just have to be a willing person.”  
      4. Pushing against the norm, tradition, incumbent, etc  
      5. “People are lucky to work with me.” Taking a stand for YOURSELF as well.   
      6. The movement maker model is the highest form of business, because it positions yourself as the go-to expert, especially when you’re the only one taking it, or the loudest one taking it. Sometimes when you take a stand for you, and you end up taking a stand for other people.  
   5. Examples  
      1. Rosa Parks \- Large, Public Movement  
      2. Pedro Adao \- Retired & Free \- Small, Personal Movement

         1. With Movement Marketing  
   7. How to start a movement on accident  
      1. Problem Aware \-\> Take Action \-\> Movement Emerges  
         1. Aware of a problem that was angering him  
         2. There’s ANGER and then there’s RIGHTEOUS anger...the latter is something that fuels inside of you because there’s something that’s wrong in the world around you  
      2. You always have what you need to say yes and to accomplish the next step.  
      3. Your movement might be a movement of one, today.  
      4. Take a stand for and/or against a problem that you are irrationally passionate about...tap into the anger and dare I say hate…  
   8. How not to kill your movement before it even starts  
      1. Woke up yesterday knowing that there was theft happening…  
      2. The Movement Stealer was out on the prowl, trying to steal movements out from people.

      4. Enemies  
         1. Overthinking  
         2. Trying to plan too far ahead  
         3. What if people think I’m stupid (People around you will probably think you’re stupid)  
         4. I’m not famous, I’m not an influencers and nobody knows who I am  
         5. Surely someone else is more qualified than I am (sure there is, but they were not willing\!\! So what? They say no, and you said yes\! Your yes qualified you\!)  
         6. Listening to “normal people” … you are not normal  
         7. Being too high in the clouds and not taking action  
         8. Not having enough or timing of funding  
         9. Running out of gas emotionally and/or physically  
         10. Connecting to the wrong fuel..movements that are organized around being a victim will always die...anger can get you started but it can’t sustain you...plug into love  
             1. You cannot build movements on anger, fear, or oppression   
             2. Love is the gas that burns forever.  
             3. Movements are about serving/loving people  
             4. Not just about taking stand AGAINST something, but FOR people  
         11. Trying to be too fancy too soon  
         12. Don’t worry about being politically correct...offend away just make sure you are offending the right people  
         13. Make sure you pick the right enemy..most movements fil because they pick the wrong enemy  
             1. So they may win a battle but lost the war  
             2. You might be opposing a person/government...you may be opposing a mindset/spirit  
   9. How to accelerate your movement  
      1. Take a powerful stand for truth and righteousness  
         1. You will never lose with this  
         2. Righteousness is “right standing” being in right standing with the people you serve  
      2. Testimonies of breakthrough and transformation \-- modern day miracles  
         1. You can be BOLD when you can take a stand for your client  
         2. There must be evidence and proof  
         3. This is why before/after is so powerful  
      3. Create an environment where people in the movement naturally want to connect and spread the good news of the movement  
      4. Persecution .. Opposition  
         1. Movements that get opposed, tend to grow.  
         2. There is a payoff to the persecution if you respond correctly  
      5. Understand the problem better than anyone else  
      6. Clearly articulate what success looks like and provide a path to it  
      7. Find ways to include people beyond the scope of the movement…  
   10. Why movements now  
       1. We are hardwired for connection  
       2. Movements are offering reassurance and puirpose in a way that’s increasingly unsettling  
       3. “Movements have a strong meaning component to them--it’s what attracts people to them in the first place”
