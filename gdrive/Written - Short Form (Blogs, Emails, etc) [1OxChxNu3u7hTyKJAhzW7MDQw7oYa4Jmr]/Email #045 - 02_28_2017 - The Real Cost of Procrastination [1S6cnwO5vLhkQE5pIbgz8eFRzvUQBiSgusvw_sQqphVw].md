I’ll be the first to admit struggling with procrastination. In fact, I procrastinated writing for this month’s edition of [*The Multiplier*](http://www.multiplyyourstrengths.com/newsletter) so much that I turned my three in articles late. I can happily say I did better for the next edition\!

I’m sure you’ve never done this, but if you have, let me tell you about the reality check I experienced recently.

**Reality check**  
Most of the time when we’re procrastinating, we’re simply exaggerate the magnitude of whatever we’re putting off. In fact, *the mental space it occupies actually becomes greater than the actual task.*

When we run into this, we should do one of two things:

1. Either offload whatever we’re procrastinating  
2. Or find a reasonable timeslot to focus specifically on it and just *get it done*\!

Of course, you could also decide not to do the task. Ever.

Think of your mind as a storage unit or, even better, as RAM on a computer. There’s only a certain amount of space available in your mind for you to process projects, ideas, relationships, and so forth.

Just like RAM on a computer, if you leave a task “open,” it will slow down your mental energy and eat away mental capacity for other important tasks.

To be highly effective leaders, we should be intentional about either “closing down” or “completing” any open tasks so we move on and succeed at even more important tasks.

There’s too much important work to do for us to get caught in the draining habit of procrastination. 

If you find yourself caught in the procrastination swamp, do what it takes to pop out of it as soon as possible so you can free up your RAM and put your mind to more important tasks.

And of course, this will help you to increasingly…

Be the best you\!

Sometimes when we procrastinate, we exaggerate to ourselves the weight of whatever we’re doing. The mental space that it occupies actually becomes greater than the actual task.

Whatever we do, we must do one of two things:

3. Either offload what we’re procrastinating  
4. Find a reasonable timeslot to focus specifically on it
