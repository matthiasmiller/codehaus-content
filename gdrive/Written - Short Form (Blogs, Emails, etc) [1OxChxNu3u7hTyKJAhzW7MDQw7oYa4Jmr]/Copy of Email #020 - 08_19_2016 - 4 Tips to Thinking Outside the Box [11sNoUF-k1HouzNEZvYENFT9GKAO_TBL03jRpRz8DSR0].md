* **4 Tips to Thinking Outside the Box**

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }},**

Last week I gave the illustration of a ten-year-old cutting down a tree in the forest. I stressed the importance of challenging underlying assumptions and thinking outside the box. This week, I’m going to share how we as a team break out of assumptions to find the best approach.

Whether you’re working by yourself or with your team, I believe these will be helpful to you as well.

**Tip \#1: Find the real problem you’re trying to solve**

Most times, the problem we focus on is only a surface problem. When you dig further, you find that you’re actually trying to solve a much deeper problem. Regarding last week’s example of cutting down a tree, you might ask yourself a series of questions: 

Do I need to sharpen my axe?

* Do I have the skills and resources I need to solve this problem?  
* Am I in the right environment to work through this problem?

Do I need a chainsaw instead of an axe?

* Could other software help me solve this problem?  
* Could I hire someone to do this for me?

Does this tree even need to be chopped down?

* Rather than find a better tool, should we let this customer go?  
* Is this a problem that deserves to be solved?  
* Should we consider discontinuing a product or service that doesn’t line up with our focus?

**Tip \#2: Find the real outcome you’re after**

Taking the third question further, decide what outcome you really want in the end.

For example, why do you need to chop down that tree? Do you want to make a clearing for a house? Do you need firewood? Are you hoping to build a boat?

Continue the train of thought until you come to the real reason. 

If you need to cut down a tree in order to have wood to build a boat, ask yourself why do you need a wooden boat. Why not use fiberglass? Why do you need a boat at all? Do you need to transport something across water? Can you use an airplane? Can you build a bridge? Are there any routes around the water that would take more time, but save resources?

Do you catch where I’m going with this?

With each assumption (i.e. “I need to cut down this tree...”) there’s an underlying *reason* (i.e. “...because I need a boat”). Keep digging until you find the real reason and....

**Tip \#3: Explore alternatives**

The deeper you dig for the real reason, the more broadly you can explore alternatives.

If you need to get from point A to point B...

Could you fly an airplane instead of building a boat? If airplanes are too expensive, could you build a bridge? If you can’t fly an airplane or build bridge, would it be better to hire someone else to build a boat so you can focus on what really lines up with your vision?

**Tip \#4: Start now**

What are the decisions you are facing right now? Do you know the Fundamental Assumptions behind them? Take time to discover the assumptions you’ve already made and the underlying reasons behind them. 

This will enable you to make the *best* decisions, find the *best* routes forward, and make the *best* use of your time.

And when you are making the *best* decisions and following the *best* routes, you can…

Be the best you\!

*Several concerns about this article:*

* *It’s a bit long, and while the hike example is great, it’s different from the other examples that you mention, which makes it feel like we’re disconnected because of that. That example could almost be a challenge as a final email in the series, challenging them to look for places in their business where they need to step back...thoughts??*

You would then start it out like, “Last week I shared the story of … cutting down a tree in the forest. This week, I’m going to share how we as a team break out of assumptions to find the best approach.

Thoughts??

**Fundamental assumptions**

New idea--can you train people how to question fundamental assumptions? i.e. easy for me, hard to Will

Other things you could explore??

* What are questions you can ask to help break free from fundamental assumptions?  
* What are other examples you could include?  
* What are ways we can identify whether assumptions are getting the better of us?  
* Any other practical tools to apply this?

Will referenced the book “Six Thinking Hats”, so it’s up to you to take a look at that.

Thoughts:

- Talk about HIKE and how we tried to teach the guys to think outside the box to solve problems.  
- Bring 3 points on how to teach a team to challenge their assumptions  
- One of the big questions is going all the way back to the ultimate OUTCOME that you’re after--are you just wanting to cut down a tree, or what’s it for? To make a clearing for a house, build a boat, make a fire, or…?  
- Intentionally exploring alternatives \-- if we didn’t have X and we had to do Y, how might we accomplish it? It’s not necessarily about finding a workable alternative, but finding ways to think outside of your current way of thinking, that opens you up to new ideas.  
- Your ability to think outside the box comes down to how well you’re able to get down to the very root of the issue and the problem that you’re trying to solve.

1. When an issue arises: Stop, Think, and Question  
   1. Is my axe sharp? (e.g. “Could other software help me solve this?” “Am I in the right environment to think and work through this problem?” “Perhaps charcoal-grilled pizza would satisfy my customers or set me apart better than wood-grilled...” etc)  
   2. Can I use a chainsaw? (e.g. “Could I hire someone to do this for me?” “  
   3. Is this a tree that needs to be chopped? (e.g. “Can we let this customer go?” “Is this a product/service that lines up with our focus, or should we discontinue it?”

Tree for boat to transport. Could we use plane? Is what I’m bringing already there?  
*Maybe we can’t afford flying it in, but it gets us thinking about pack mules, etc.*
