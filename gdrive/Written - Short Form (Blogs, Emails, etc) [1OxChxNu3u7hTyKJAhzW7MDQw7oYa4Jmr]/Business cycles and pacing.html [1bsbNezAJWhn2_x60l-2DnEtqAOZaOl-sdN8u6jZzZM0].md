# **Business cycles and pacing**

Josh told the story this morning about how when he was in high school, some of the students would go back-and-forth between high privilege and low privilege. This is a lot like some business owners where they go from a boom to bust sales cycle. This is more than a treadmill, because a truck noble actually stabilize you because you set the pace at which you're willing to go.

However, if you're unable to pace self, you will run at sprints and then wear yourself out. This is the same kind of effect that happens to runners when they don't pace themselves. But the key is to learn how to pace yourself and follow that pace at a sustainable rate.
