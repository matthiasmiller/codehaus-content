One day, while on their way to lunch, a sales rep, an administration clerk, and their manager came upon an antique oil lamp. Curiosity got the better of them and they picked it up to examine it. Suddenly, a genie jumped out of the lamp, very annoyed at being disturbed. With impatient disgust, the genie barked out a promise. “I’ll give each of you just one wish if you’ll leave my lamp alone\!” 

The administration clerk immediately jumped on the opportunity. “Me first\! I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof\! Without another word, she was gone. 

“Me next\!” said the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas, and the love of my life.” Poof\! He was gone, too. 

The genie turned to the manager, “Okay, mister, you’re up.” 

With a twinkle in his eye, the manager said, “I want both of them back in the office after lunch.” 

Moral of the story: ***Always let your boss have the first say.***
