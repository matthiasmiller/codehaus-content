# **Note**

Working by the hour deliberately breaks the 8020 rule. You are paid not based on results are productivity, but by the sheer number of hours. You are encouraged to get on the treadmill and start moving faster. I think that hourly work is detrimental to business owners, because it inherently prevents them from stepping outside the system and looking at the business as a whole.

Working by the hour is a deliberate attempt to live by the law of averages.
