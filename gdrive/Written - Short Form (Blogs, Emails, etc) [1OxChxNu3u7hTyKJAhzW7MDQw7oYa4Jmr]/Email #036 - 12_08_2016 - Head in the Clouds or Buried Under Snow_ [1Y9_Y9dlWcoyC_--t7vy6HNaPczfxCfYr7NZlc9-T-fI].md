Do you ever find it hard to balance long-term vision with short-term day-to-day planning?

If so, you are just like many entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs often get caught in one of two places:

1. Heads stuck in the clouds of a big-picture vision  
2. Snowed under with a thousand small details

The problem with \#1 is you end up transfixed by the big-picture without ever implementing a plan to get there.

The problem with \#2 is you spend a tremendous amount of time and activity meandering through life without ever arriving at your destination.

A 5-year plan is too broad of a target to be able to get strong clarity. Who knows what could change in the next five years? There’s no specific path to follow.

However, if you just show up every day with nothing more than an inner sense of where you want to go, you’ll be so reactionary you’ll never make meaningful progress toward your goal. There might be a path, but no long-term destination.

To reach your destination, you must create both long-term and short-term plans, zooming in-and-out from the big picture to the specific details every day. 

Reviewing that long and short term perspective every day enables you to make much better decisions on your daily activity.

It has certainly helped me. The planning system I’ve been using recently has made such a tremendous difference for me, it’s too good not to recommend to others. Most planning systems feel overwhelming and stifling, but this one is lightweight yet very effective.

Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planner Course addresses how to not only **articulate your vision** but also **break it down into manageable day-to-day tactics**.

This time of year, I get pitched a lot of goal-setting advice. This is the first one I’ve felt like I could actually integrate into my life on an ongoing basis (not just as a hyped-up New Years event). That’s why I signed up as an affiliate, because it has worked wonders for me.

Nevertheless, like I said last week, it’s not for everyone. This is specifically designed for busy entrepreneurs and overwhelmed visionaries, though it does require you to engage with the content and develop specific daily habits. If you are feeling a disconnect between your big-picture vision and your day-to-day tactics, and nothing else seems to be helping, I encourage you to check out [Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planner Course](https://ew295.isrefer.com/go/charfen1/mys/).

It may just work for you\! (If not, you’re covered by a full refund for 60 days.)

Connecting your day-to-day activities to your long-term vision, will consistently enable you to...

Be the best you every day\!
