# **Ready, Fire, Aim**

## *Driven Entrepreneurs and the Relentless Pursuit of More* 

Sunday evening, once our house finally quieted down, and our boys were soundly asleep, my wife Bonita and I started talking about everything that was going on in our lives. Somehow, I started talking about all of my ideas and everything that I was trying to move forward in business.

Nothing was moving quickly enough.

She simply looked at me and said, "You really want to change the world, don't you?"

Absolutely right, I do.

Wherever I look, I see opportunity.

I see gaps in markets that are great business opportunities. I see organizations and corporations that could make relatively minor changes and see significant benefits. I see individuals who have incredible potential if only someone would mentor them through all of the hard knocks of the school of life. I talk with my friends about how to create a cultural change that could remedy some of the problematic social issues our country is facing.

Opportunity lies everywhere.

Don't get me wrong--I'm still blind to 95% of the opportunity that's lying right in front of me. I still struggle at times to create the change that I want to see in the situations that I'm in. However, I just happen to be highly tuned into 5% of the opportunities in front of me.

## **The Difference between Activity and Traction**

Sometimes the opportunity becomes overwhelming to me.

I've watched enough entrepreneurs to know many of them unintentionally self-destruct. The same ambition and drive compelling them to succeed actually becomes their greatest enemy. They push themselves beyond their limits, instead of relying on the powerful levers life offers and being willing to saying “no” to opportunities that come their way.

I've come to question the conventional wisdom of hustling and grinding, not because I'm lazy or don't believe in the value of hard work. I question it because it often comes with a set of faulty assumptions that actually undermine the results you’re after.

Rather than push myself to exhaustion every single day, I’ve done my best to maximize my focus and energy on all levels--mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. I've intentionally created space in my week where I can disconnect from the noise and intentionally focus my own well-being. As part of this, I journal extensively--even for hours at a time.

This past month as I was journaling, I realized the huge difference between activity and traction. It's a little like driving on the gravel roads in rural Kansas, where I grew up. As an entrepreneur, it's a great rush to stomp hard on the gas, let your tires spin wildly, throw gravel twenty feet back, then feel yourself lurch forward, your truck fishtailing as you start to get traction.

The past few months, I realized I've been doing exactly that. I've stomped on the gas pedal, assuming all my activity would result in getting traction. Instead, I was mostly throwing gravel.

It’s a great adrenaline rush, but it’s no guarantee for results.

## **Running Forward and Falling Behind**

This past month, I participated in a business-building challenge, expecting it to help me significantly move the needle on my business. Instead, everything started working against me. All of the conventional advice that was supposed to move me forward actually made me feel stuck.

I rarely work late at night, simply because I make much poorer decisions and actually get much less done. I tried it a few nights...and ended up with unproductive days and sleeping 14 hours when I was finally able to crash.

Weekly conference calls that used to energize me to move forward started overwhelming me with 10 more things I should be doing.

The accountability that should be providing the support I need to move forward (along with all of the opportunities that I saw right in front of me) actually caused significant mental blocks, an intensely debilitating feeling of not being able to focus, think, or meaningfully move forward.

Conventional wisdom says to work harder, set bigger goals, and do more. If it works for the rest of the world, why doesn’t it work for me?

Call it what you like—the war of art, lizard brain, bad mindset, lack of commitment, poor effort. All I knew was that my activity yielded little meaningful results, and I struggled to push forward.

To make it worse, trying harder didn’t help. If anything, it was making it worse.

## **Less Activity, More Results**

If pushing yourself to do more things, move faster, and work longer hours doesn't work, what does?

As I talked with my wife and spent time thinking about it, I realized that I had drifted from a number of fundamental concepts that have helped me considerably over the past few years. I hold to them for a simple reason--they consistently reduce activity and increase results.

Let me share two of them with you.

**1\. Achieving more demands an obsession with doing less.**

Yes, you've likely heard the proverb about the person who chases two rabbits catches neither. The hunger to move faster and achieve more must force us to question our *approach* not merely to redouble our efforts.

I’m not going to try to convince you to stop juggling so many things. If I can merely *tempt* you to stop and experience it for yourself, my job’s done.

The real question is whether you've experienced the clarity, peace of mind, and focus that comes as a result of doing less. Life is programmed to increase noise around us, and if we want to keep moving forward, we must obsess about lowering that noise.

**2\. Achieving more requires a deep trust and reliance on other people.**

I’ve heard many reasons not to build a team:

* “I’ve tried delegating and it doesn’t work.”  
* “It’s hard to find good help.”  
* “Nobody really wants to work.”  
* “Nobody does it as well as me.”

Many times, delegation is simply taught as a way to get others to do tasks that we don’t want to do ourselves. As a result, we unintentionally micromanage our team and reduce them to robots who get work done.

People were born to be powerful. If you treat them like that, they’ll live like that. If you don’t, they’ll either reduce themselves to your standards or they’ll quit.

Lead them well, and they’ll help you move things forward. They’ll take the weight off your shoulders and free your mind to focus on the things that matter the most.

Once you've experienced the benefits (and you see how empowering it can be for your team), you’ll obsess about replicating it because it becomes one of the highest-leverage, most fulfilling things you can do to move things forward.

## **Living With Our Eyes Wide Open**

As my wife and I sat in our living room and talked, one thing became crystal clear to both of us. I needed to narrow my focus.

This week, I've done exactly that.

Rather than engage in meaningless activity, I'm actively surrounding myself with people who can help me move forward, choosing to create traction in the one area where it matters.

For those of us who are eager to change the world and to move forward more quickly, narrowing our focus seems like a short-term setback. We've become addicted to activity, happy with the hope that maybe somehow, we're moving forward.

I'm not satisfied with that.

I'm satisfied with nothing less than changing the world, but I'm not satisfied selling my soul to do it.

I'm living my life based on a conviction that conventional wisdom is often wrong, that productivity doesn't look like a sweatshop, that doing more actually results in getting less done, and that hustle and grit may look very different than what we might think.

Some days, I feel like I'm living my life on a hypothesis, hoping against hope that the crowd is wrong. Other days, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the crowd is walking blind.

I refuse to live my life without my eyes half closed, and beg you to do the same. Don't waste your life chasing a lie, soothing the burning addiction of an entrepreneur with more activity that distracts you from the things that really matter.

Let's be the ones who do more, be more, and yes, even change the world.

And we’ll do it without selling our souls.
