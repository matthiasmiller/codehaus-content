The past week I’ve been waking up to a chill in the air. The weather is slowly changing, and the evening is coming a little more quickly.

I took my walk earlier this morning, absorbed in my own thoughts until I suddenly noticed the brilliantly green trees. In a few months, those leaves will change colors and fall to the ground.

In every season, we have an urge to say, “This is just like last year...and the year before.” However, we dare not miss the most beautiful gift--the gift of a life of wonder. In the words of G. K. Chesterton, “The repetition in Nature may not be a mere recurrence; it may be a theatrical *encore*.”

Just like entrepreneurship.

I want to encourage you with one thing. Don’t lose the wonder of entrepreneurship\! No matter the challenges you face and the wins you celebrate, don’t miss the wonder of the relationships you create, the projects you build, and the life that you get to live\!

Let every day be your theatrical encore\!
