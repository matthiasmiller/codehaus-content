**Chris’ Conclusions:**  
So it would be interesting to know this for all of our emails since the relaunch when I started writing. These primitive stats tell me that overall solution focus is better, but that problem focus shouldn’t be counted out. JUST REGARDING OPEN RATES.

What would tell us even better would be effectiveness and maybe this can be a future survey or something some day… to survey specifically the effectiveness of solutions vs problems emails.

***Stream of conciousness:***  
So my final thought is maybe focus on solutions but don’t leave problems out. Maybe have a 3/1 ratio or a 4/1 ration of solutions/problems. This would work well with series. Present a problem and then send out 2 or 3 emails about practically getting around that problem.

One thing would be interesting to go to a mall or a business center and sit there and ask “What are these guys thinking?” I heard Amazon founder Jeff Bazos recommend this. One thing for sure is that they’re not thinking about me. But maybe they’re thinking about they’re bottom line or how they blew up at their employees or how to generate revenue or whatever.

***It would be interesting to set a goal to get a 5 week average open rate of 60%. I definitely think we should set a few goals for ourselves. Let’s talk about this.***
