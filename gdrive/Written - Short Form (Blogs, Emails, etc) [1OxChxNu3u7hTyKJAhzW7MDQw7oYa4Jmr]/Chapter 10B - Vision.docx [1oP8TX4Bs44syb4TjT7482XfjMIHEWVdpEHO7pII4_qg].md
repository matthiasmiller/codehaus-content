## **Getting Your Vision on Paper**

Your vision is only meaningful if you are able to articulate it. Don't underestimate the importance of doing that right now, because it gives you the opportunity to clarify exactly what you are looking for.

No matter whether I set aside time to journal, I always make sure I have a way to record thoughts that I have throughout the day. I've used all kinds of things:

* A small notebook that I keep in my pocket

* A document on my computer

* A special email address that I send notes to

* An app on my phone

No matter what it is, I try to capture these insights and put them in a place where I can come back to them. As you begin to think about your vision, you will start having ideas coming to you in the middle of the night, or in the middle of the day. I get insights to the problems I face when I'm standing in line at the grocery store.

The key is to start recognizing and recording those insights. The more that you ignore them, the fewer of them you'll see. But the more you pay attention to them, the more you'll discover.

If you've never spent time journaling, what is the best way to journal?

Let's go back again to when you were a child. You didn't spend time figuring out if you had the right answer, or if people were going to like you because you preferred green lollipops instead of red ones. No, you were free to be yourself, even if it didn't make sense.

Many times, we restrict ourselves from journaling because we hold back from writing if we don't think it makes sense. That comes later, when you read through your journal. But to use a journal effectively, you need to allow yourself to be free.

Many times, we have managed to bury our vision, and the only way to dig it back out is to allow ourselves the freedom to explore it. And that means letting go of our filters of what is "right" and "wise" and "normal". We need to allow ourselves to break out of the box that we have put ourselves into.

Journaling your thoughts will help you find clarity. When you begin to unearth these questions, you'll find yourself with a lot of questions, and journaling is a great way to sort through the issues that you're facing.

Journaling your thoughts will also make them more real. Your vision is just an idea, but when you put it down on paper, it will take on a life of its own. It will become something tangible, rather than just an idea or a thought. We play around with ideas all day long, but as soon as we can get something tangible, that's when we begin to embrace the vision.

But the most important part about journaling is just to make it happen. Do it now\!

Take a few minutes right now and reflect on your first question, "What can you imagine yourself doing?" Write down five of the things that you imagined:

---

---

---

---

---

And now, take some time to think about it. What threads do you see? What are things that burning inside of you?

---

Go back to the funeral. Who were the specific people (or kinds of people) who had something special to say about you?

---

---

---

---

---

What were some of the specific things that they had to say?

---

---

---

---

---

Take a few minutes to reflect--what part about this really energizes and excites you?

---

---

---

---

---

Stop right now.

Don't rush ahead, and don't hurry on to the next chapter. Take a few minutes to think about:

* what this means for you

* what this could look like

* why this matters to you

* why this matters to others

## **Valuing Your Vision**

Several years ago, I began an idea bank filled with dreams--some of them big dreams, and others of them small dreams. Each page represented a separate dream. It's inspiring to go back and look over these dreams, because some of them I'm working toward right now. Others I know are possible for the future.

Being able to write down your dreams allows you to keep moving forward now without a fear that you will forget the dreams that you've held in your heart in the past. It also allows you to expand, to brainstorm about the vision you've had in the past.

The value you place on the vision you hold will determine the outcome of your life. If you value the vision that's in your life, you'll find it grow and expand, and you'll discover people coming into your life who share the same vision, the same passion, and who are willing to support you in that goal.

But the opposite is also true. IF you devalue the vision in your life, you'll gradually find it shriveling up and dying. Like a garden, vision has to be tended to and focused on. You have to water it; you have to keep the weeds out. You have the make sure it gets sunshine. You have to nurture your vision if it's going to see the light of day.

The steps that you take to think and journal about your vision are the steps to valuing your vision, although it cannot stop there. It's up to you to determine how much attention you will give it, and how much action you will take towards it. In the end, the measure of the value you put on your vision is measured, not by the how thoroughly you explore it, but how well you can embrace it in uncertainty and how actively you take measures to bring it to pass.

## **Carrying Your Vision**

Anything great comes at a price, and if you're willing to embrace you're vision, you must be willing to embrace difficulty, hardship, and opposition. Not everyone will be supportive of your vision, and not every day will be an easy day to pursue that vision.

Your vision needs to be written not merely on a piece of paper for you to review. It must be written on your heart. Your vision must become something that you carry.

That is what will allow you to face some of the most difficult times as you embrace your vision.

## **Contradiction**

Some of the most emotionally difficult times of embracing your vision are when life goes in a completely opposite direction. You want to start a business, but you're stuck in a job working for someone else, and you can't find your way out. You were born for fame and influence, but you're unknown in the world. You were born to lead and influence, but you're always placed into the smallest, most insignificant role.

The most powerful leader is not always the one who is able to force situations into her control. The most powerful leader is the one who is able to hold onto a vision in spite of situations that defy it.

You might have a vision to give generously, but you're dead broke. You might have a vision to speak in front of crowds, but you've got a debilitating stutter.

Sometimes it seems like your situations are laughing out loud at your vision, but your choice determines the outcome. You get to determine whether you'll listen to those situations, or whether you will continue embracing the vision and carrying the vision.

Your ability to live in the middle of contradiction will determine the level of influence you have on those situations. When your response is to react, you're immediately granting that situation power over your vision. But when you can respond, rather than react, you prove to the world (and to yourself) that your vision truly is greater than your circumstances, and that one day, your vision will triumph.

Learning to live in contradiction is a great gift and skill for you to develop. This time will either make you or break you. It will either give you the internal resolve to believe in yourself, or it will break you down and cause you to lose hope. However, it's not the situation that has that power. It's your ability to embrace the contradiction and allow it to do that deep work within you, to transform you from one who is tossed from side to side by circumstance, to one who stands tall, in spite of the contradiction.

## **Delays**

And then you encounter delays. You want to travel the world, but instead you welcome a small child into your world. You want to start a business, but instead you end up taking another job. You want to start a non-profit for troubled youth, but instead you end up taking a homeless teenager into your own home.

On your way to pursuing your vision, you encountered delays. Again, sometimes these situations are completely outside of your control, but your ability to deal with deals come down to two simple realizations.

First, every delay holds within in it further shaping that will explode your capacity with your vision. Every delay, if you allow it, will develop in you patience and resolve, a deeper drive to continue pushing for the goal.

Second, every delay holds within it the power for you to choose. Within every delay, there's a new step forward that you can take. It gives you one more opportunity to continue moving towards your vision, even if it means a step of preparation that you didn't anticipate.

When you look at the peak of a mountain, it's difficult for you to gauge how far it is to the base of the mountain, much less to the peak. And sometimes, you think you are close the peak, only to discover that the summit you are heading for is on the other side of a valley. Most times, we assume that delays are little creatures that spontaneously spring up on us, intentionally distracting us from our destination, not realizing that some of these delays are (and always were) part of the journey to our destination.

## **Opposition**

As you determine to pursue your vision, sometimes it feels like everything starts to go backwards. You decide to expand your business and suddenly, the sales that you'd had start to dry up. You decide to spend more time with your family, and you being encountering family conflict. You decide to give more generously, and suddenly, you find your finances tighter than you anticipated.

Life has a way of handing us scare tactics. Sometimes the closer you get to your vision, the greater the opposition.

The voices of the critics will get louder, telling you that you're making the wrong choice for deviating from the status quo. Your own inner critic will start mocking you, telling you you'll be ashamed of yourself if you really pursue your vision. It will tell you that it's not possible, that nobody really believes in you, and nobody else will support you in your vision.

Sometimes the final part of the journey towards your vision comes with a war cry, a defiant act that whatever it takes, you will move into the arena that you have claimed as your own. Sometimes it means battling your demons until they finally surrender, and you break into the place you knew you were destined for.

You must learn to carry your vision through the opposition. The opposition that you face is not proof that your vision is impossible. In fact, it's proof that it might be much more possible than you believe. It's not proof that you're doing everything wrong. It might be proof that you're doing everything right.

As you press forward into the future, you get to hang onto your vision. Let it be something that is burned in your heart, that no matter what comes your way, you fully embrace, taking steps every single day into the future that you're creating.
