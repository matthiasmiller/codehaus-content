Justine Musk once told us to forget making a billion dollars and become passionate about providing what the world needs. She said to pinpoint what only you and you alone can offer to the world. To take two things--fields, hobbies, genres--that you’re a master at and combine them.

This certainly seems to have worked well for her ex-husband. Elon Musk, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time, has degrees in both physics and economics. So then, according to Justine’s advice, it shouldn’t surprise us that he’s revolutionized the car, space, and financial services industries (Tesla, SpaceX, and Paypal).

This is the essence of any great innovation. And it’s certainly not limited to only entrepreneurship. Chefs do it all the time when they mix and match the most random ingredients to create the latest palatable rage.

Take a moment to stop and consider two or more things that you’re really good at. How could you take those two strengths to provide what your customer needs?

The more solutions you have, the better you’ll be equipped to…

Be the best you\!

P.S. Like always, I love hearing your ideas. What amazing ideas have you discovered by combining two different thoughts?
