Do you ever miss the simpler days of childhood? The days when we didn’t have to worry about showing up to work on time or communicating clearly with a team of employees or year-end strategy evaluations. Sometimes I miss those days when my biggest problem was trudging through one more grueling hour of social studies.

I miss those days only because now I have twenty years’ worth of perspective and new problems that make washing the dishes seem like play-time. Yet, back then, working my way through a mountain of crusty dishes seemed like a real problem that I couldn’t wait to get away from.

A big lie we tell ourselves when advancing to the next level is that our problems will finally disappear once we level-up. 

While our life should continually be getting better, **the fantasy that we’ll eventually arrive at a plateau where all our problems are gone is simply not true.**

Whether it’s when we’re becoming an independent adult for the first time, developing a new skillset, or scaling our businesses, we will always have problems.

Every new solution introduces new problems. 

We experienced this when we decided to bring our print publication, *The Multiplier,* in-house. It did solve a lot of problems. Instead of being dry stock content produced by professionals, it became a fresh, personal letter from our team. At the same time, it produced problems of efficiency, teamwork, and communication that we’re still developing solutions for.

Just like growing into adults required us to face more responsibility, an opportunity to grow our print publication became an invitation to a new set of bigger problems.

Unless we’re willing to embrace problems, we’re not cut out for business. (Or we're doomed to live in a business stuck with the same set of problems on an ongoing basis.)

Trying and failing doesn’t always mean we tried the wrong thing. Often, the solution was correct, but it introduced problems we didn't anticipate.

As leaders, entrepreneurs, and creatives, let’s stop searching for a problem-free utopia\! Instead of looking for a respite from problems altogether, let’s begin anticipating and embracing the new problems that every level of growth brings.

As you take on bigger and bigger challenges, you will continue growing yourself to...

Be the best you\!

If you're in business to avoid problems, you shouldn't be in business. Every solution introduces additional problems, the growth is always an invitation to a set of bigger problems. Unless you're willing to embrace that, you're not made for business, or you're made to live in a business that is stuck with the same set of problems on an ongoing basis.

If you tried something but failed, it's not always because of what you tried. Sometimes it's because the solution was correct, but it introduced problems that you didn't anticipate.
