# **6\. Circular outline**

Thoughts and ideas are not linear as an outline suggest. They are more like a globe or a circle, like mind maps suggest. This is one of the keys to being able to organize thoughts in a good fashion.

When you do this, it allows you to see connections between unrelated ideas. This is really hard to express.

For example, rather than a hierarchical org chart, you might want to diagram your business as a “network” with certain hubs, etc.
