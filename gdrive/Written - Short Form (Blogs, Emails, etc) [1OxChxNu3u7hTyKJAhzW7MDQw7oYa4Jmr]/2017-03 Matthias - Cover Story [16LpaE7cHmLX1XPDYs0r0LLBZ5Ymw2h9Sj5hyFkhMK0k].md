## **The Paradox of Rest**

Growing up, the concept of rest didn't make much sense to me.

As a child, our family had a weekly ritual. Every Sunday, after attending a lengthy, traditional church service in the morning, my parents would send me off to my bedroom for an afternoon nap.

As a five-year-old, I distinctly remember the contradicting advice my father gave me. If I fell asleep during the interminable service, he'd tell me, "You must be tired because you couldn't stay awake." And if I stayed awake the whole time, he'd say, "You must be tired because you didn't have a nap this morning.”

I'll admit...it was a great way to get me out of everyone else's hair for a few hours.

Of course, I may have read a book or two when I was supposed to be sleeping, or on occasion cautiously tiptoed outside, slowly shutting the back door behind me, hoping I wouldn't wake my parents.

(Don't tell my father.)

Throughout most of my life, sleep was simply the antidote for avoiding disaster. I would regularly stay up until 2:00 at night working on a project at work or I'd get up at 6:00 on the weekend to meet with mentors. The only reason to sleep? If I woke up and felt so horrible that I knew even caffeine wouldn't carry me through.

Even in high school, I kept a stash of coffee beans nearby to pop in my mouth. I refused to slow down simply because I had cut my sleep too short.

Seems pretty typical of the entrepreneur: driving hard, pushing for the next thing, taking on more. Who needs sleep? I've never heard an entrepreneur admit they struggle getting too much sleep.

For many of us, rest doesn't make a lot of sense.

## **Entrepreneurial Vacations**

And then there are vacations.

Early in our relationship, my wife and I had very different ideas about vacation. Prior to our relationship, I can't remember spending more than half a day just to chill, kick back, and relax unless I was laid up sick or locked up in a car on a road trip.

Of course, I'd periodically take days off to read, but I never read merely for entertainment. I was driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn more about the world around me or the pursuit of an interest or goal.

One time I did start a novel just for entertainment, but I eventually tossed it in the trash because I couldn't stand to finish it. What was the point? It felt like an utter waste of time.

Then I spent vacation with my wife's family. This wasn't just a single day off. They got together for an entire week at a time to eat, hang out, and yes, venture out on one or two escapades. But mostly, just to hang out.

I hated slowing down. During those first vacations, I looked for every opportunity I could to go jogging, take a trip to town, or bury my head in my phone to research a new idea I had.

Not the best way to prove to your wife, "I love you and I love your family."

With time, we've found ways to work around our differences. Vacations have become easier for me with kids, because there's more activity. Meanwhile, I've become more intentional with being present with her family, and she's been more intentional in giving me the space I need to get out and go do something.

While I found ways to enjoy vacations with her family, I still didn't fully understand the importance of rest, or even the kind of rest that I needed.

That changed eight months ago.

## **The Unfolding of Insight**

My introductory lessons on the importance of rest began last summer.

Throughout my entrepreneurial journey, I've spent a lot of time journaling. It's been a powerful tool for me to get clarity on specific things I'm facing. Almost invariably, the things that repeatedly show up in my journal are things that are very important.

If you're a Christ-follower, journaling is one of the easiest ways to start hearing God's voice for your business. If you're not actively pursuing that, you're missing out. And if you don't believe in God, it's still a powerful tool to sort through the noise of your thoughts and get clarity on your life.

Last summer, over a period of maybe six months, the importance of rest consistently came up throughout my journaling. During this time, I also kept stumbling across articles defending the importance of rest.

More importantly, I started seeing a direct correlation between my rest and my creativity. If I was even slightly fatigued, my ideas became less creative, I became less productive, and I had a harder time focusing. However, my best work always came when I was physically rested.

I don't think it's any coincidence that my emancipation from a caffeine addiction came directly on the heels of these lessons on rest.

With it, I started taking on a different perspective on productivity.

## **Productivity Isn't Just Time and Effort**

With time, I started changing my focus in productivity. In the past, I'd focused on taking on more. I looked for ways to optimize my time, plan more effectively, and increase my effort.

These are helpful building blocks, but they're limited tools. I began focusing on building my creative energy. I started looking for interesting conversations with other people, reading books on topics that interested me, taking time to go on lengthy bike rides or walks by the river, listening to music, spending time in prayer, and taking the time I needed to journal.

While I was doing these things, I saw a dramatic increase in my level of creativity. I consistently had new, fresh ideas. I had insight on how to solve specific problems and how to move things forward.

I began to realize the value of a having a crystal-clear mind free of the distractions and  noises that pull many people down. However, I also began to realize exactly how difficult that can be.

But then it began slipping away.

## **Greater Noise Means Less Creativity**

It happened so slowly that I didn't realize it.

Last fall, I stumbled into some unexpected opportunities and challenges, and I found my life starting to pick up significantly more speed. Unfortunately, I didn't offload things as quickly as I was taking them on.

As the noise slowly increased around me, I started losing my creative edge. Don't get me wrong--these were still very productive months for me, yet, I had this uneasy feeling something was out of sync and I couldn't nail down exactly what it was. While I was able to make small improvements, I didn't find the extreme improvement I was hoping for.

I didn't realize how much I'd drifted out of this until I spent nearly three weeks out of the office, only checking in occasionally. This wasn’t completely my choice. After all, taking time away from work that you love isn't exactly something you do by instinct.

However, three unexpected things happened to me:

1. I got a strong urge to do some hobbyist software development and bought my first Raspberry Pi, a miniature computer that's perfect for it. I immersed myself in the project, tackling a challenge completely unrelated to anything I'd been focusing on.  
2. I got a breakthrough on a mental block that had kept me from moving forward on one of our major initiatives.  
3. As soon as I was back at work, the first thing I did was eliminate the noise from my inbox. Today, over 90% of my email bypasses my inbox so that I can deal with it on my own terms.

With this came three powerful lessons on rest.

## **Lesson 1: Rest isn't inactivity.**

Rest isn't inactivity. It's an intentional act that's not limited to physical rest. I've come to believe that actively engaging yourself in something that's enjoyable, mentally stimulating, and somewhat productive yields a major boost in restfulness and creative energy.

If you don't have a hobby like that, get one.

## **Lesson 2: Distance creates clarity.**

Intentional disconnects from business are critical to gaining clarity. It's one of the most counterintuitive, unnatural things for an entrepreneur to do. It doesn't mean disengaging from life--it simply means engaging with a different part of life so that you can re-engage your business with fresh perspective.

If you haven't intentionally disconnected recently, you should spend two or three weeks away from your usual surroundings, finding something that engages you on a deep level.

## **Lesson 3: The noise around you rises to match the noise within you.**

When the noise in your life increases, the noise around you will increase as well. You must do everything you can to reduce the noise, both internally and externally. Use tools like exercise, journaling, and creative hobbies to lower the internal noise. Build a team around you to lower the external noise. Refuse to tolerate the small issues because they often point to a bigger problem.

All this leads us to the paradox of rest.

## **The Paradox of Rest**

The paradox of rest is twofold.

First, rest is not the absence of activity but a proactive pursuit of things to recharge. It is not always about disengaging, but engaging with something different.

Second, rest is not about slowing down but about increasing your capacity to move more quickly.

As unnatural as it seems to an entrepreneur in motion, rest plays a crucial part in gaining the clarity of mind you need as a leader and an entrepreneur. It's non-negotiable for playing at the top of your game.

Go have some fun\!
