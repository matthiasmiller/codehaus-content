Growing up, our family had a special Thanksgiving tradition. After lunch, each of us shared something we were grateful for. For many of you, this is not only a Thanksgiving tradition but also a habit you practice every single day. Rather than encouraging you to be grateful, I want to remind you of the people who are grateful for you.

They’re the customers who’ve benefited from your products, the entrepreneurs who’ve grown their business because of you, and the employees who’ve grown personally because of your leadership. They’re the lives you’ve touched through your giving, mentoring, encouragement, and interaction.

Entrepreneurs are among the most generous (and perhaps most misunderstood) people. Most of us take little or no time to reflect on the impact of our lives. However, I encourage you to take a few moments to do that this year. Whether or not you’ve reached your financial goals, you have still been a success. On behalf of the people whose lives you touched, I want to say “thank you\!”

Happy Thanksgiving\!
