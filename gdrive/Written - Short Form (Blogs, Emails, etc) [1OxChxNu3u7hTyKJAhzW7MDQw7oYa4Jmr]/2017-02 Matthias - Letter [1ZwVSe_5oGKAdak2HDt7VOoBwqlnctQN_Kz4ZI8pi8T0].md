When my wife and I became licensed foster parents--three years ago this past December--we were told one thing, “Expect the unexpected.” And three years later, we certainly have stories to tell of the unexpected\!

We certainly have this past year. The last few months have been a whirlwind of activity and emotion as we welcomed a newborn into our home and said goodbye to a three-year-old. While that's exactly what we signed up for, it's funny how it hits me at crazy times.

And yes, sometimes it means caring for an orphan even when it hurts.

Here's to the generation of entrepreneurs who level the scales of injustice\!
