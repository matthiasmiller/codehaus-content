## **Focus on the Growth**

When I look forward to everything I want to be and the person I want to become, I realize how significant the leap is. I see so much growth potential in myself, and I realize that I cannot achieve that growth apart from investing a lot of time.

Some mornings, that thought will invigorate me. But other mornings, if I allow myself to think about it, I will discourage me.

It's important that we learn to celebrate what we accomplish. When we have a difficult meeting with someone--something that stretches us past our comfort zone--we need to celebrate it. When we are in a new season \=of life, and we still haven't mastered the skills that we need, but we've made a little bit of progress, you need to celebrate it.

The simple act of celebrating will help you shift your focus from everything that you don't know to everything that you do know. It will keep you from getting distracted by everything you need to accomplish in the future, and help you to focus on your progress right here, right now.

Any time that you are in transition, much more is happening in your life than you realize. Being able to focus on the successes and the lessons you're learning will tune your awareness to the huge amount of personal transformation you are experiencing here and now.

## **Focus on What You Know**

Sometimes you need a break from learning and growing so you can focus on what you know. Recently I've been intently focused on personal development--focusing heavily on what I can do to live my life with excellence. I've read countless books, many of them heavily impacting my view on the world. However, for every book that I've read, I have ten more on my wish list.

The wakeup call for me comes every time I am having conversations with other people, and I began to see patterns in their life that I have corrected in mine. I often become especially aware of patterns that I've corrected years ago. How I live my life and approach life is so different, that it's completely second nature to me, and I am struck by how a short conversation can have such a significant impact.

This is the wakeup call for me that even though I have engrossed myself in these subjects, I am surrounded by people who haven't adapted them into their life. Every day I am aware of places I need to grow to become more effective at what I'm doing. But it's in these conversations that I become more aware of everything that I have learned throughout these years.

Many people move into a new role feeling like a novice. However, most people forget that the decisions they've made and their excellence before has allowed them to be promoted into a new role. Often, it's someone else's vote of confidence that has allowed them to be promoted.

Understanding that you were promoted for a reason, and that someone else saw something in you to move you into this position can give you clarity into what you have to offer. a simple conversation with the people around you can give your insight. Simply ask them, "What did you see in me that qualified me for this role?"

## **Focus on What You Bring to the Table**

Of course, some individuals are compelled forward by their own inward drive. They have a desire to accomplish something, but they going out on their own. They're starting a business. They're launching a new venture. they don't have a board promoting them. they don't have a boss helping them succeed. It's just them.

When you don't have anyone to encourage you or give your insight, how do answer the question, "How do I deserve to be here?"

Most people are unaware of the vast knowledge, experience, and perspective that they bring to the table--often by virtue of simply living a different life, having different interests, and learning different things.

If you're striking out on your own, know that you are one of few. You are one of those initiators, those go-getters, those people who make it happen. It's easy to downplay our courage because when we approach the uncertainty, the fear can be so strong. But if you're stepping out, you're one of few who is willing to full embrace the fear and keep moving forward anyway.

those inner qualities that you have as a leader are significant qualities. you must learn to lead yourself first. just take the time and answer the question, "What are the things that I bring to the table?" These might be skills, experiences, or qualities. For example:

* I bring a sense of determination.

* I can bring clarity to situations.

* I am action-oriented.

* I am aware of other people's feelings and I can help move them forward.

Learning to take this inventory list is critical to keeping an awareness f what you have to offer. This will keep you from focusing on everything that you don't have and on the things you do have. It will keep you from inaction because of the things you don't have to offer and will keep you continually offering the things that you do have to offer.

## **Gratitude: The Tool for Changing Your Perspective**

In the early days of my wife and my relationship, we would occasionally hit grouchy times. One of us got into a bad mood, and we felt down about our situation, and one of us would pipe up, "Let's play the gratitude game\!"

I don't recall whose idea it was. I'm guessing it was my idea, because I was happy to play it when my wife wasn't having the brightest of days, and I became stubborn as a mule when my wife suggested we play it on my down days. (My wife is good like that allowing me to challenge her and going along for the ride--and finding a way to hold myself to that same standard\!)

Here's the game: we would take turns saying something we're grateful for. I would run out of ideas, so whenever my wife would say something, I would look for something similar. Often she would tell me, "I already said that."

Only ten items in, we would find our perspective shifting. We turned our focus away from the things that we didn't like, and we turned them back towards the things that we were grateful for, and our emotions followed.

My wife learned a lot faster than I did, but over time, I began to develop a lifestyle of gratitude. Rather than becoming overwhelmed by the things that were going wrong, I became able to see all the things that were going right.

She still encourages me sometimes, but my "down days" are a lot more infrequent because I've learned how to focus on the things that I have.

You can do the same thing. Start a journal--write down one thing that you were grateful for from the day before. Text someone every day, with one thing you're grateful for. See what happens to your perspective\!

## **Begin with Success**

The final perspective, I as I have mentioned earlier in the book, is learning to begin with success. Success is not something that's maintained at the end of a journey. It's a posture of your heart at the beginning.

Success is a way of approaching the world that will allow you to get the results that you want. It is an inside job that will yield the results on the outside that everyone else labels as success. However, the outside results are merely the fruit.

Get it backwards, and you'll live a frustrated life. That's exactly why so many people have the external results they need and want, but they will be frustrated because they do not have the internal results they need that keep them satisfied.

When are you going to feel successful?

What is it for you financially? Is it when you've reached a six-figure income? Is it when you become a millionaire? What about a multimillionaire? Will you need to become a billionaire?

What level of competence will you need to have to feel successful? Will you need to be in the top 10 percentile in your state? Will you have to be the most visible, highest performing in your company? Will you need national recognition?

What is it going to take?

If you answer these questions with anything that is in the future, you've already damaged your success, because it belies a subtle but flawed belief: "Success is out in the future."

The trouble is, you convince yourself that you're reaching for a destination, not realizing that you have a mindset that's moved it into a moving target. If you believe right now that success is out in the future, you will continue believing that five years now. When you reach your next goal, you will still feel like success is out in the future.

The only way you can reverse that is to change your belief: "Success is here and now." Learn to live successfully now. With whatever level of income you have now, live successfully. With whatever level of performance you have, live successfully. Live as if you were successful here and now, and use the peace of that awareness to allow you to keep pushing forward.

You were never made to chase a moving target. Returning to the example of the car, it's like focusing on the horizon and trying to reach the horizon. You become so focused on reaching the horizon that you forget to look around you and look at the scenery. You forget to look at the map. You forget to refuel your car.

No matter how much you focus on the horizon, you will get to that point at the same time as if you focus on the stretch of road ahead of you. In fact, focusing on the horizon will delay you if you are running out of fuel and blowing tires when you rocks in the road.

When are you going to make the decision to embrace success now? Are you willing to live your life endlessly chasing a moving target, or are you ready to embrace an internal process that will carry you to the external results you want?

That's the power of perspective.
