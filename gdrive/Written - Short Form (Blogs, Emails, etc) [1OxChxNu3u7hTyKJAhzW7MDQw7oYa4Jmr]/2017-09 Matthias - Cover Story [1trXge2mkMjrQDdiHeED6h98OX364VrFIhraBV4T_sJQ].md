# **Set Free by Systems**

Entrepreneurs are known by their ability to think on their feet and fly by the seat of their pants. They improvise, innovate, and discover uncanny solutions when their back is up against the wall.

Sometimes, when I'm talking with an entrepreneur about systems, they get this funny look on their face, as if they're thinking, "Why would I want to have something as constraining as a system? When you systematize life, what challenge or variety do you have left?" That's when I know that they haven't yet experienced the liberation of a great system.

It's okay, because I get it. Entrepreneurs resist anything that feels constraining, and most of us have grown up in systems that didn't support us. Maybe it was a classroom that confined us to our desk, or demanded that we study information that we couldn't compartmentalize in our minds. Maybe it was a church that was more interested in preserving the past than shaping the future.

If you're an entrepreneur and you've never experienced the benefit of a system that truly supports you and helps you move forward, you're selling yourself short.

The truth is this: the part of the world that isn't entrepreneurial typically enjoys structure and order. There's no law that says you need to build your entire world from checklists, "to do" lists, and working procedures. However, even if you don't use them frequently for yourself, you should consider using them for the people around you who rely on them to do their best work.

If you will have a successful, thriving business, you must learn to build those systems appropriately. And to do that, you must understand how they work.

If you're an entrepreneur, business owner, or leader and have not yet read Sam Carpenter's book *Work the System*, please buy it.

Now.

Then read it.

It's hands-down the best book to help you not only understand a systems mindset but also get a clear picture of what it looks like in day-to-day life.

But first, let's deal with an entrepreneurial misconception.

## **Predictability Is Your Friend**

No matter how innovative you are as an entrepreneur, predictability is your friend. How would you value a business that has:

* A predictably great flow of leads  
* A predictably great sales process  
* A predictably great product or service  
* A predictably great profit margin

Or would you rather use your innovation to fight fires surrounding these:

* An unpredictable flow of leads  
* An unpredictable sales process  
* An unpredictable product or service  
* An unpredictable profit margin

If you're like most entrepreneurs, the day-to-day life of the latter option may actually *sound* more appealing. It has far more drama, and it actually utilizes more of your natural ability to think on your feet and pull solutions out of your hat.

However, it will also rob you of your most important creative abilities. When you spend your days fighting fires, you'll spend so much time coming up with creative solutions that you'll miss the most obvious business problems in front of you.

Trust me: predictability is your friend.

Your job as an entrepreneur is not necessarily to become predictable or systematic. Your job as an entrepreneur is to harness your unpredictability. If you can't do it yourself, hire people who want nothing more than to duplicate your predictability.

If you're a world-class salesperson, you might enjoy thinking on your feet. Let someone else turn some of your pitch into a script or into materials that others can use.

If you're a world-class speaker, you might be most comfortable getting on stage every time and presenting your training live. Find someone else who can package your message into a recorded training or a book.

While most entrepreneurs love the challenge of figuring out how to solve new problems, they end up shooting themselves in the foot when they take this strength too far.

## **Everything Is a System**

Once you realize that predictability is your friend, it's time to understand how systems create that.

Everything in your business can be reduced to a system. If there's any part of your business where you're not getting good results, it's probably because you haven't implemented a good system (or you're working with people who haven't implemented a good system). If you've developed a great system and it's still failing, it might be because you've got wrong person working your system.

Maybe it's someone who's just a little too much like yourself.

At the highest level, your business is a system. If you have a restaurant, it's a system that allows hungry people to fill their empty stomachs.

However, that system is made of many smaller systems. Your hostess has a system for seating people. She has a system for taking reservations. She has a system for estimating how soon a booth or table will become available. Your waiters and waitresses have a system for taking orders. They have a system for presenting those to the cook. They have a system for making sure everyone is enjoying your meal. Your cooks have a system for making the food (yes, called a recipe).

The list of systems goes on. There's a system for compensating your staff. There's a system for accepting payment. There's a system for accepting take-out orders.

If these systems are well-designed and well-executed, your customers are ten times more likely to not only enjoy their meal, but bring a friend back the next time.

Everything is a system.

However, there's one crucial system that is missing from this description.

## **Yes, Even Marketing is a System**

All marketing, even in the most primitive form, is a system. Word of mouth is a system, although typically a very loosely structured and poorly executed system.

Sometimes people consider marketing (and human persuasion) to be a blind art. Every once in a while, I find myself in a conversation with someone who believes human behavior is mostly erratic and unpredictable. This belief makes it *very* hard to resolve conflict, and it makes it very difficult to market your business effectively.

I believe human behavior is somewhat unpredictable yet very consistent. Let me explain.

People typically have a limited number of core motivations that drive them to make their decisions (and no, those decisions are rarely intellectual). Let me give you some examples:

* If one of my favorite restaurants is giving me 20% off my favorite dish today only, I might choose to eat out tonight instead of tomorrow night, and I might choose that restaurant over their competitor across the street. Why? I don't want to lose the opportunity to get my favorite dish at a bargain price.  
* If I see a lot of cars parked outside a restaurant, I'll assume it's a great place to eat and (as long as I'm willing to wait), I'll be more likely to stop to check it out. Why? If so many other people are eating at this restaurant, it's probably a good choice\!

As erratic as human behavior might be, those principles of persuasion are tools that you can be *very* systematic about.

Of course, other things are more difficult to predict. You might not be able to predict exactly what items your customers want to see on the menu. You might not be able to accurately predict whether they will look for you on Google, ask for a referral from a friend, find your listing on the Chamber of Commerce website, or wait for an ad on Facebook. You might not be able to predict exactly what type of offer they're most likely to respond to.

You can always take a "best guess". However, any experienced marketer knows that even best guesses might be flat-out wrong.

The only way to find out for sure is systematic experimentation. Find the media and messages that are working, and use experimentation if you must. Find out exactly where your customers are looking and what they'll respond to. If you do that, you're almost certain to uncover a consistent flow of customers, as long as there's actually a market for your business.

No matter whether you're selling retail goods, real estate, coffee drinks, consulting, or soliciting donations for a non-profit, every part of your sales and marketing process is a system. It follows a specific process. The better your process and the better the execution, the better results you'll gain.

## **Systems Give You a New Way to Look at the World**

When you start to look at the world through the lens of systems, you'll discover a new way of looking at almost every problem that you face. This perspective shift is critical, and it's an important part of creating predictable success.

However, it's not enough to just change your perspective. Next month, I'll discuss specific tools that you can use to implement this in your business and your life.

Until then, be unpredictably predictable\!
