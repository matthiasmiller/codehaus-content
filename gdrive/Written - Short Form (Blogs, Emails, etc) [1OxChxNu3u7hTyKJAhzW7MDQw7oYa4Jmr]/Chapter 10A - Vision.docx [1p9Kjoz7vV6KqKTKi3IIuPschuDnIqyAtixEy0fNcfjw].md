# **Chapter: Vision: Living for Something Bigger**

Most people do not suffer from having too big dreams. They suffer from being satisfied with the ordinary, being content to move from one day to the next without making a significant impact on the world that they live in.

They suffer boredom because they are unwilling to move beyond the places that they've been. They're afraid of leaving the places that they know for the places that they might know, explore, own, and occupy.

You cannot persuade everyone else to dream bigger, but you can choose to do this for yourself.

Your life can be driven by one large, motivating force--a dream so vast that it forces you to stretch yourself to even believe it remotely possible. This is the one thing that will keep you from living a small life.

You could be the driving force of history. The question is not whether it's possible, because we have countless individuals who have proven it possible in the past and are proving it possible today. The question is, "Are you able to dream big enough and do you have it within you to keep pressing on until you reach it?"

## **Finding the Ability to Dream**

First, you must regain your ability to dream. You must challenge yourself to go beyond your circumstances. You must lay aside your own self-perceived limitations, and you must be willing to look for ways to move beyond them.

Many people are waiting to be great and significant because they are waiting for someone's permission. They don't know whose permission they're waiting for--maybe it's their friends, their family, their boss, or their spouse. Because they don't have permission, they are waiting in the sidelines, hoping that someday the doors will open for them to make a difference.

Meanwhile, they are being passed on every side by individuals who are making the decisive choice that today, no matter whether they have permission, they are going to make a difference. They are going to take ahold of history, and they are going to shape it.

You have permission.

Your wait for permission is simply a cautious fear--a fear of others' disapproval, which will almost certainly come. It is a fear of others' judgment--a judgment that you are less competent, less skilled, and less noteworthy than you believe that you are. It is a fear that others will see you as arrogant, brash, and foolhardy.

You don't have to prove them wrong, because proving them wrong means giving them a listening ear. You simply have to find a "yes" that is bigger than their "no's".

Your time on earth is limited, and don't waste your life because you believe that others need to give you permission to go on this journey. You have permission, so go for it.

Rooted in the concept of permission is the belief that someone besides you is ultimately responsible for your life. This is a lie, and it strips you of taking the decisive action that you need. It is up to you to ask for insight where you desire insight. It's up to you to ask for perspective where you desire perspective. But you will be the only one who has to face the regret of how you lived your life when you are lying on your deathbed.

It's sobering, but it's true.

Do not wait until you nearly die to decide to live. Decide it now. Commit to yourself that the world needs someone who is willing to dream bigger, who envisions a reality that is bigger than we've seen yet. Then, go, and give them that gift.

## **Your Ideal World**

Everyone has something hidden deep within them, a yearning to see the world changed. They have one thing that, if they could eradicate or change, they would commit their lives to.

For me, it's seeing people struggle in life without answers--living far below their potential--when within their grasp are a few simple tools that could dramatically change the trajectory of their lives.

I burn to see people reach their fullest potential.

You have something within you that you burn to see changed. You've seen hints of it, but it's up to you to fully take hold of it and own it. It can be really simple:

* It could be to see young children have positive mentors.

* It could be to see thriving marriages and families.

* It could be to see modern day slavery abolished in your lifetime.

* It could be to see poverty broken, and children given the opportunity to pursue the career that matters to them.

* It could be to see every child in foster care cared for.

What is it about this world that, when you look at the world, you tell yourself, "It mustn't be\! And I'm burning to change it\!"

Unless you have a big "yes", you will not have the power to say "no" to living a small, ordinary life.

You must decide what you want to be remembered for, and you must start living that now.

## **Grow Your Vision, then Grow it Even Bigger**

You don't just need a compelling vision. You must grow it until it hurts your ability to believe.

I can help ten people reach their fullest potential, just by helping my friends be the best they can be. If I just impact one life every year, I will easily have time to spare\!

How big should my vision be then? It could be a hundred, or a thousand. Maybe it will be ten thousand, or even a million.

But what about a billion?

When your vision for the world borders on insanity, you know you've find about the right size. That's exactly the place where you're willing to take on the challenges that are required to step up your game.

But it forces you to do something else. It forces you to completely redefine the way that you look at the world, and the way that you solve your problem, and the way that you approach your vision.

You will no longer be looking to touch each life at a time. You will be looking for ways to make the biggest impact to the most people, and you have to redefine your approach in order to do that.

## **Grow Your Vision Beyond Yourself**

You have to grow your vision beyond yourself. You were not put on this earth to serve yourself. You were put on this earth to invest in the lives of the people around you.

If your vision does not require aligning yourself with others who share the same vision, you're playing too small. You cannot make the impact you want to make without finding those individuals and working with them to see this come to pass.

The entire focus of your vision is not to build your own empire, even though it might serve you quite profitably. The focus of your vision is serving the world in the best possible what that you know how.

Learn to serve, in the greatest possible way. Learn to give your time, your effort, to something that matters.

Anyone can sit on the couch and complain about the situation of the world (which really isn't as bad as many people would have us believe). But it takes a mark of true courage to step out and to be the change.

Anyone can travel alone, but it takes the heart of a true champion to surround herself with people who are willing to join in the vision.

At the end of your life, no one will thank you for having been self-serving and self-absorbed. The only true measure of your life is the benefit that you've given to other people, how you've made their lives better.

## **Delete "Can't" From Your Dictionary**

If you truly have a vision that's mind-blowing, you must delete the world "can't" from your dictionary. In every conversation about your vision, you must watch out for that red-squiggly underline that says, "This word is not in your dictionary."

You have the capacity to do it, and as long as you allow your basic assumption to be that you will find it and you will do it, you will find a way.

However, if you allow "can't" to become part of your language, you will keep yourself from accomplishing everything that you can accomplish. You will kill your vision before you even start.

Saying "can't" is really saying, "I won't." I refuse to believe that my vision is possible, and I refuse to believe that I have it within me to keep pressing through when it gets difficult. I refuse to believe that what I have to offer truly matters. I refuse to believe in my ability to keep pressing forward.

It's a decision to refuse to believe.

You can choose to believe. And when you hit an obstacle, keep on believing. Don't stop, just because you can't see the situation working out like you imagined.

## **You Do Have a Vision**

Right now, I can hear people say, "But I don't have a vision."

Oh, but you do. You were born on this earth for a specific reason, and as you find that reason, you will find yourself coming more fully alive.

You don't think you have any vision or dreams because you have never allowed yourself to pursue them. If you were born into a home where fear, safety, caution, and status quo were the norm, you were influenced away from pursuing a big vision for your life.

However, that time of influence is over. If you're reading this book, now's the time to start making changes to your perspective.

Right now, ignore all the unanswered questions, and move beyond everything that you don't know. Just take a moment to go back to your childhood.

Do you remember lying on the grass, looking up at the clouds, and imagining that you could fly? Do you remember getting so completely lost in your imagination that you lost all sense of what was going on around you? Maybe it happened for you at night, when you lay on the ground and stared up at the stars, or maybe it happened when you took long walks through the woods, and just let your mind go free.

Do you remember what it's like to sit and just imagine?

If you don't have a vision right now, start with that. Just close your eyes for a moment, and allow your mind to run free. Imagine yourself doing anything that you wanted to. Maybe you're spending time in your favorite vacation spot in the world, or maybe you're working on a top-secret project, doing research into complex but exciting problems.

Let your mind wander. Explore the possibilities.

Allow your imagination to give you clues about where you don't like to go, and what you'd like to be. Your vision or your dream might not look like what you imagined, but you will find yourself drawn to certain kinds of dreams. Use it to as a brainstorming tool for your vision.

Close your eyes again, and imagine that you're at your own funeral. Imagine different people coming to the front of the church, and saying, "My life had...because..." Allow yourself to imagine what they would say:

* A young mother might say, "My life is different because you encouraged me to pursue my dreams."

* A high school senior might say, "My life is different because you spoke at our school, encouraging us to be leaders."

Just allow yourself the freedom to imagine.

Write down what you imagine yourself doing and what you imagine people saying. Yes, right now\! Take the time to write it down\!

See? You did have vision\! You have a rough sketch of your vision, and we're going to take time to dig deeper into it, and get it down on paper.
