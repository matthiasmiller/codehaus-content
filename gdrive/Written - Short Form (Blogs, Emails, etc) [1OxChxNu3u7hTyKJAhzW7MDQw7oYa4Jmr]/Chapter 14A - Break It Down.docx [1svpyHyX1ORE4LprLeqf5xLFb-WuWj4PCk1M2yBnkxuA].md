# **Chapter: Break It Down, Break It Down**

Have you ever been racing to the next town, hoping and praying you'd make it to the gas station? And just before you get there, your tank runs empty.

You push it another hundred feet to the gas station, where you can finally fill it up with gas.

But imagine something for a moment.

What if you would do that all the time? Why do you even need fuel? Why not push your car wherever you wanted to go?

Of course, this seems incredibly ridiculous. But many times, this is how we live our lives.

We continue to push ourselves to our vision. We sleep less, we work harder. We think that if we can get one more thing done today, we'll be one step closer to success.

meanwhile, we don't recognize that we are merely pushing our car--when in fact, we could be driving.

If you're ready to go after your dreams more effectively, you're going to stop living your life by your own "push". You're going to have to learn how to effectively drive your car.

It is the engine that propels you. It is the GPS that guides you. It is the transmission that engages the power of the engine to the wheels. It's up to you to capture the passion and the drive that's within you, and use it to make a difference in the world.

It's time for you to stop living by the "push" and start living by the "pull".

Let the pull of the engine propel you forward. Let it take you towards your dream. Live by such a powerful "yes" that saying no to distractions isn't even a challenge and takes no second thought.

From there, you get to start living your life in first gear.

Simple changes. Simple habits. Simple results. You gain momentum. You get up to speed.

Then, you push in the clutch, shift to the second gear.

You're going faster now. Refining your habits. Improving results. Working with other people to achieve your dreams. Your momentum builds.

You push in the clutch, shift to the third gear, then the fourth.

You goal?

To be hurdling down the road at 70 MPH, music turned on loud, GPS set on the right destination, and using your momentum to propel you forward.

Here's what most people don't realize.

There's a difference between speed and acceleration.

It takes energy to overcome negative momentum. You're sitting in once place, and you want to be moving forward. You start to push on your life. Things begin to shift. However, it takes incredible energy to create that momentum.

However, going back to the story of the car that ran out of gas, if you've ever experienced that, you know that the most difficult part is getting the car to start rolling. However, once it's rolling, it takes almost no effort to keep pushing it.

That's the difference between speed or acceleration.

A lot of people are exerting all their energy, running from one place to the next, wearing themselves out. But if they focused their energy on a single point, their energy would turn into momentum. They could have things that keep continuing with very little effort.

And then, instead of using their energy to get it started, they could use their energy to keep pushing, slowly picking up speed.

Every day, they speed up by one mile per hour. That's it. Every week, their speed increases.

It doesn't take more effort. It simply requires that they focus their attention on a single point, and continue pushing, and continue being deliberate to keep their foot on the gas pedal.

But it gets better.

Every obstacle that you face has negative momentum. It wants to slow you down, hold you back, and defeat you. As long as it doesn't stall you or distract you, however, it holds a secret benefit for you. Remember, negative momentum becomes positive momentum as soon as the movement starts to shift.

Some of your biggest barriers to moving forward are simply the pieces of your life that are waiting for that breaking point--when they stop standing in your way and start propelling you forward.

That's what it means to live with momentum. That's what it means to develop acceleration.

It's possible.

But first, we need to start with the power source.

Let's get started.

## **Original Intro**

It's easy to embrace a big dream and believe that that's all it's going to take to achieve it. It's like we've received a promise from the future and that's all it takes to accomplish it.

That's not how it works.

Imagine that you were planning a vacation to the sunny shores of \_\_. You go online, you buy the plane tickets, and you make arrangements to leave for a few weeks. However, the morning of your flight, you have no idea which way to go to the airport. You head off in one direction, only to discover that you've gone the wrong way. You're stuck in traffic, hopelessly lost, and you'll never make your flight.

Although we would never plan a vacation like this, many of us plan our lives like this. We imagine what we would like to become. We take assessments, write in our journals, and brainstorm about where we want to be in life. In other words, we decide our final destination.

However, we don't know how to create a plan to actually get there. And because we don't create a plan to get there, we spend our time wandering from one place to the next, assuming that somehow we will stumble upon something that will take us where we want to go.

If you don't break it down, you will be completely overwhelmed by the size of the task and by what you need to accomplish. To use my own example, when I considered the possibility of writing my first full-length book, I became so completely overwhelmed by the process that I never even considered starting the project.

That's when I started breaking it down.

I realized that the first thing that would benefit me the most was having a full-length rough draft. Just like an artist sketches outlines before filling in the detail, I realized it would be better if I completed the rough draft before I started perfecting the first chapter.

That allowed me to ignore the questions about editing, cover design, back matter, and marketing. Those are specific questions that needed to be answered, but I was able to ignore them.

From there, I determined how many words I could write in an hour every day, and I determined how many weeks I required to achieve my goal. Once I actually saw these figures in plain numbers, it started looking very achievable. That gave me six weeks to finish the draft of my book.

I started my plan, and every day, I committed to writing half a chapter. It didn't matter whether it made full sense. It didn't matter whether I fully developed all the ideas. It didn't matter if I had perfect grammar or spelling. What mattered was that I hit my half-chapter quota.

After I was writing for a week, I started breaking my one-hour sessions into smaller chunks. I started breaking each chapter into smaller sections. My writing timeslots became periods of intense focus, working only to accomplish the next thing that was in front of me. Day by day, as I would convert growing book into PDF format, I would watch the numbers grow. I wrote five pages every day.

I committed myself to writing a half-chapter every day. I only skipped one day because of a conference I attended, and I made up for that immediately the next morning.

That's the power of breaking it down. That's the power of relentless, consistent focus on achieving your goals. I can tell you that I accomplished a lot of other things during those six weeks, but none of them are as memorable as sitting down every single day to write the manuscript.

## **Break it down by the Month**

You don't have to have a fancy process for creating your plan, but it does have to be something that is fully believable to you. If you don't believe that you can actually write a rough draft of a chapter in two hours, you're not going to do it. (Actually, my goal was to write a rough draft in one hour, but I only did that as a stretch goal. In fact, even as I writing this, I'm timing myself against that benchmark.)

If you're looking at a project that spans multiple months, start breaking it down into specific pieces. What are the big pieces that you need to accomplish it? Start to look at it from a 1-2 month time-frame?

Notice that I didn't spend much time planning out all the other pieces before I started on my draft. Some people will tell you I was crazy for not thinking through the process more. However, I knew that if I waited until I planned out the whole project, I would become overwhelmed again. I chose to focus only the thing that was directly in front of me.

However, I also ran the risk of reaching the end of the first month, and without a clear next goal, I begin wandering aimlessly again. And because I'm not seeing measurable results, I give up and drop the project once more.

I know that I will hold myself accountable to publishing and marketing this book. However, it might be more helpful for you to determine the big picture--to know all of the pieces that you need to get this done. It would be easier to hold myself accountable this way. That would allow me to break through the current barrier, knock that off the list, and be able to move onto the next piece. I have a clear, definitive plan, and I know exactly when I have reached my goal.

Many people never accomplish what they want because they are unclear about what they want, and they do not take the time to determine what it takes to get there. It's not crucial for you to know the individual pieces of the whole process, but it's important that you have a place to start.

Whatever you do, you must set yourself an end-date, and you must have a way to make sure that you know that you reached the goal. You don't want to leave any ambiguity from yourself. You want to make sure that you will know with confidence, "Yes, I've completed this\!"

It was important to me to know that my goal for the first draft was only getting ideas on paper. I have stalled on other book projects because I was so focused on getting the details exactly right that I had no way of knowing when I had reached my goal. How good was good enough for my book? I would spend hours editing and rewriting, and it was just a matter of days before I stopped seeing visible progress, so I just gave up and quit.

It's not good enough to simply "make something better". If that's your goal, your first step must be to find "10 simple, clear ways to make this better". Your next goal becomes to "execute those 10 improvements".

## **Break it down by the Week**

After that, I started breaking it down by the week. I realized that I would be able to give an hour a day to something that was my passion. To say that I would spend 30 days writing sounded like a huge number, but when I broke it down into 6 weeks, it became achievable.

Look at how I viewed my progress at the end of each week:

1. The first week, I only had five weeks left.

2. The second week, I was a third done.

3. The third week, I was half done.

4. The fourth week, I was two-thirds done.

5. The fifth week, I only had a week left.

6. The sixth week, I was finished\!

By breaking my goal down into weekly chunks, it looked much more achievable. Imagine if I had broken it down into days:

1. The first day, I only had 29 days left.

2. The second day, I only had 28 days left.

3. The third day, I only had 27 days left.

4. The fourth day, I only had 26 days left.

5. The fifth day, I only had 25 days left.

Yes, each day I was making progress, but it seemed much less achievable than when I broke it down by weeks.

Again, each week I had very clear, definite goals. I knew I had to write exactly 10,000 words every week to stay on track with my goal.

Of course, that sounds like a lot of words.

## **Break it down by the Day**

That's when I started breaking it down by the day. I committed myself, for the first hour of my day, to write half a chapter. Some days it took 35 minutes. Some days it took 55 minutes. But I always managed to get it done in under an hour.

I knew exactly what I needed to get done every single day to accomplish my goal, and although I tried to stretch myself, I also knew it was very achievable.

I knew that each chapter needed to be approximately 4000 words, and that every day I needed to write 2000 words for a half chapter.

I did that relentlessly. With one exception, every morning I sat down and I wrote my quota. I knew with certainty that my success depended on only one thing: writing my daily quota.

Each morning, I didn't have to worry whether I would meet my deadline. I didn't have to worry if my book would be long enough. I didn't have to worry about when I'd finally finish. I knew.

All I had to do was to focus on today, and get done what I had committed myself to do.

## **Break it down by the Minute**

To be completely honest, I broke my goal down by the minute. I realized that if I would type at 67 words per minute, I would be able to write my rough draft in half an hour. At only 50 words per minute, I would be able to write my rough draft in 40 minutes.

I literally determined how fast I would have to type in order to reach my goal. I wasn't focused on getting the whole chapter done in an hour. I was focused on getting one section done at a time, then one paragraph at a time, and a single sentence at a time.

I was relentless.

But I have to admit. I broke it down even further.

I wrote this rough draft by timing myself. I used special software to set a target writing speed, and I always set it to stretch myself. I had up-to-the-second feedback on how close I was to achieving my writing goal.

## **Breaking it Down Will Build Back Up**

Breaking it all down is what allows things to build back up. Because I had clarified exactly what I needed to get done and when I needed to get them done, I was able to focus only on the thing that was directly in front of me. I didn't have to spend time worrying about writing the chapter tomorrow, because, well, that was tomorrow, not today.

I didn't have to worry about what I would write about next week, because, well, it was this week and not the next\!

I knew that letters turned into words, words turned into phrases, phrases turned into sentences, sentences turned into paragraphs, paragraphs turned into sections, and sections turned into chapters, and chapters turned into a book.

Every single action that I took built up on the prior one, and every single action kept compounding, allowing me to get superb results without worrying about whether I would reach my goals.

That's the power of breaking it down. Everything looks impossible until it's broken down into small pieces. And when you look at the small pieces and you start executing those small pieces, that's when you get massive results for your actions.
