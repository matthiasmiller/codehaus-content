# **Chapter: Fuel the Fire**

Once you know where you want to go, you get to pour fuel on the fire. It's a choice to live more fully, more passionately. However, it can be easy to lose sight of where you need to.

Fuel is something that transfers into energy. Some energy sources are renewable, and others are non-renewable. You need to learn to tap into renewable energy sources. It's not enough to have an explosion of growth and momentum, only to have it fade away. It's not enough to start a project with passion and fire, only to burn out because you overextended your reach.

You need an energy source that will keep propelling you forward. You need a true energy source, something that will continue fueling you.

Many times, it's easy to get lost in the mundane. In the last chapter, we covered the challenges of navigating through a plateau. We've discussed a lot of the technical aspects of pursuing your dreams and going after the things that you want and desire. However, there's another aspect that's just as real and just as important.

It's the poetry of your life.

Your logic is the power that enables you to strategize. It's the power that allows you to navigate fear and doubt and indecision. It's the power to give you direction when it feels like you've completely lost direction. But it takes more than that to live a life that's fully alive.

It takes more than strategy. It takes more than a mission statement. Those are simply the kindling. To set it all on fire, you need something more.

You need imagination.

It's your greatest power against burnout and getting caught in the mundane. It's your greatest power against fear. It's your greatest power against settling for the things that you current see and experience. It's your power to launch into a life that is not merely ordinary, but is extraordinary.

## **Living Life in 3D**

Life was meant to live in three dimensions. Every time we reduce our lives to a simple list of tasks, simply things to do or places to be, we reduce our lives to two dimensions.

These are dimensions of reality, but the third dimension is the critical piece: it's the depth.

The third dimension is the difference between a painting and a sculpture. It's the difference between a movie and a live performance. It's the difference between accomplishing a task and achieving a mission.

There's a story that illustrates this well. Three men were laying bricks on a building. Someone asked the first man, "What are you doing?" He replied, "I'm laying bricks." They asked the second man, "What are you doing?" He replied, "I'm building a wall." However, when they asked the third man what he was doing, he replied, "I'm building a cathedral."

He was the man who was living life in 3D. He saw the fullness of what he was creating. He was able to visualize not just the end product, but he was able to see the story that he was writing. It was a story that was much bigger than him. Its meaning transcended both him and what he was building.

Your life was made for transcendent meaning. You were meant to live for something bigger than you, something bigger than what you're doing.

Any time that you reduce your life to yourself or you reduce your life to what you're doing, you're reducing your life to a 2D image. Yes, it can be grand, incredible, and inspiring. But because it lacks depth, it does not that element of being fully alive.

If you want to pour fuel on the fire of your dreams, you must learn to live life in the 3D.

## **Living for Something Bigger than You**

You were never meant to live for yourself. You are most motivated and most fulfilled when you are working for a cause that is bigger than you. Even when you accomplish greatness, it has little significance until it touches the lives of the people around you.

Even if your goal is building a name for yourself, you will always accomplish it better by serving the people around you. History does not favor those who build empires for themselves. No, history favors those who have built empires for others, for people who are less fortunate than themselves. They remember the Napoleons who conquered vast lands, but the favor the Mother Theresa's who gave themselves away for the sake of others.

Living for yourself means living in a single dimension. It means living in a world where community works only for your favor. Business deals are only aligned with what you can get from it.

When you start living so that others can mutually benefit from what you have to offer, you start living in a second dimension. You live in a world that is big enough for others to succeed, where others can benefit without robbing you of opportunity.

However, when you add to that living in a way that you benefit those who have nothing to give you, you start living in a third dimension. This means giving people the opportunity to succeed who would never had a chance to succeed before. It means creating opportunity where it never existed, creating wealth where it never existed, and doing it to raise up giants around you who would have remained hidden in insignificance if it had not been for you helping them to find their way up in the world.

That's life in the third dimension. That's a life that fully and deeply matters, and it's a life full of meaning and significance.

You were born to impact others. You were born to raise up leaders and world-changers around you. You were born to see the potential in others and help them to achieve it.

You were put on this earth to build an empire, but not an empire for yourself. You were born to build an empire that champions others, that is much bigger than you yourself.

Build an empire for yourself, and one or two beneficiaries may remember you when you do. But build a kingdom of giants, investing in the people around you, and you will leave an entire nation who mourns your passing.

Create a culture of people who will perpetuate your work. Live to leave a legacy. Start something so big that the people who come behind you cannot help but be compelled to join in this vision that's so much bigger than you. You will die, and you may be forgotten, but life for a vision that will never die.

That's what it means to live for something bigger than you.

To do so, you have to surrender your own ambition and your own pride. Sometimes it takes more humility to say, "I will generate wealth and change the world" than to say, "I will remain hidden in my little corner with my small pile of rocks."

You cannot influence people if you remain turned inward and focused on yourself. Sometimes the humblest thing that you can do is step out and say, "I'm willing to step into the arena and face the odds. No matter what it looks like, I am going to do what I can to impact the world that I live in."

That's the power of life in the third dimension.

## **Burning Up Burnout**

Your ability to fight burnout lies in your ability to live with imagination. Every one of us has things that we face that are daunting. Every one of us lives with challenges that are difficult. If you are an entrepreneur, you live with the risk of losing everything that you've put on the line. Sometimes this risk stares in your face daily.

When some people look at their lives, they imagine that they are in a prison. They imagine that they are slaves at a work camp, getting up every morning, doing the same thing every day, bending and bowing to everyone's beck and call.

This is a terrible use of the imagination, and it will lead you directly to burnout. The mundane always gets the best of the people who are unable and unwilling to dream, to imagine.

Every hero's story could be reframed a way that is much more boring, more mundane, and outright terrible. His story could be reduced to the fact that he lost his mother at a young age, and he was pegged for a crime he never committed.

But oddly, these realities only serve to bring grandeur to the story. They show his power to overcome the odds. They show his ability to come back. Even if he does not achieve fame or does not clear his name, we still admire him for his ability to overcome, to persist even through the challenges.

For the heroine who was abused as a child, raped as a teenager, homeless for a year on the streets of New York, we paint the same picture. If you paint this picture in daily life, you might frame her as a victim, someone destined for failure. However, if you her story into a movie, you build the expectation of an overcomer. You know that person has something within her who will defy the odds and will persist.

It might not be a billion dollar business. It might just be the ability to get up every single day, face the world. It might mean just getting married and having a family of her own. In daily life, we downplay the significance of these accomplishments, but when we paint the obstacles she has had to overcome, we see the colorful threads of the story that she's living.

If you can do it for other people, why can you not do it for yourself?

If you are simply working a job to pay the bills, no wonder you have no meaning\! No wonder you are frustrated with your life\! But if you are working a job so you can raise children who will be world changers, what's going to stop you?

You get to determine the story that you tell yourself about the life that you are living. If you are bordering on burnout, you are telling yourself a story that downplays your significance in the world.

Put your life into a movie. Right now, you might be in the worst part of the movie. Maybe you are broke. Maybe you've completely lost sight of who you are and who you want to become. But why do you have to imagine the movie stopping right now?

Who's stopping you from imagining the rest of the movie? What if your life is not a terrible failure, but what if instead, it's an incredible comeback in the face of the most difficult odds?

Why not? Who's to say it isn't?

Besides your own unbelief in yourself, who's to say that success is not every bit as possible as failure?

## **Burning Up Fear**

Your imagination can also burn up your fear.

Many people get lost in the imagination of all the things that could possibly go wrong. They imagine going bankrupt, losing their house, going broke, and getting stranded on streets, begging their friends for a place to stay. They imagine getting stuck in an economy that will not give them a job.

This is a terrible use of your imagination.

Your imagination can just as freely imagine the things that could go right. Yes, you might face bankruptcy. However, if you do, you're in great company. Many successful people have faced bankruptcy in their lives before.

But what if you don't? What if you do face success?

You've been influenced by the world around you to imagine the worst that could happen when you're faced with risk. That's how the media trains you to think, but you're not obligated to follow the norm.

Take the time to consider the risk, but what if you take the time to imagine the benefit? Is that not time better spent?

Whatever you allow yourself to focus on will consume your attention, and it will literally affect the things you're able to see. Your imagination of all the things that will possibly go wrong is training you to only see the things that are going wrong. It is literally blinding you to the things that are going right around you.

Use your imagination for good, not for harm\!
