We've launched headlong into one of my favorite times of year. The heat of the summer's been loosening its grip, and our family's been cramming as many evening walks and Saturday hikes as possible.

Getting ready for winter sounds like getting ready for a school exam, eh?

Maybe we're soaking up all of the goodness of this season before we're catapulted into the next. Or maybe it's just a white-knuckled grip while we hang on for the ride of our lives\!

Maybe both.

The best stories are filled with action, drama, emotion, and suspense. Those are enthralling when you're curled up on the sofa, listening to the rain fall outside your window, engrossed in a captivating tale.

They are bloody terrifying when you're in the story.

We are living the story we'll someday tell. We live amidst the stark contrast of dark against the light, the struggle of evil and justice, and the fight for hope against impossible odds.

You were born for it. Embrace it, because you will live to tell about it\!
