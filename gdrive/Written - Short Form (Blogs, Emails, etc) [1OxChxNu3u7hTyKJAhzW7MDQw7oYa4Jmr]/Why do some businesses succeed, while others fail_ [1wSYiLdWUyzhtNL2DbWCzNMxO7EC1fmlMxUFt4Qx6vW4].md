Have you ever wondered why some businesses succeed, while others fail? Have you wondered why some industries experience explosive growth, while others smolder and disappear?

Everyone has their own answer to the question.

If you pick up a book on business development, it likely focuses either on tactics or strategies. Of course, great strategy and great execution is critical to the success of a business. However, many people ignore a much deeper root cause of business success or failure.

It's a plunge into the depths of 80/20.

Almost a year ago, I heard the story of the first millionaire in California. He became a millionaire selling picks during a gold rush. It's become a profound framework for looking at my business at a 10,000-foot level. Not only does it affect my business decisions, it's become a grid for purchasing decisions I make (even personally).

While most of the world is focused on finding gold, a few people focus on selling picks. In fact, many entrepreneurs make their dive into entrepreneurship through some kind of biz-op, whether it’s network marketing or another opportunity. Months or even years later, they wake up to the cold reality that only one person is making the money...and it’s not them. It’s the person who sold them the membership, franchise, trade rights, training--or whatever it might be--for that opportunity\!

Of course, not every gold rush leads to a dead end. I believe the world is waiting for honest people who are committed to making a profit by genuinely helping others.

I'm [doing a webinar](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/7612267921590522625) tomorrow, Wed, September 21 at 6:00 PM ET where I'll discuss:

* A foundational lens for understanding businesses that succeed or fail  
* A new insight into where your growth opportunities lie  
* A guide for understanding the right time to pivot in your business  
* A deep reason why consumers are missing most of your marketing messages

This is not a simple "how-to" webinar, and definitely NOT a "get rich quick" pitch. This is 1-hour content-packed presentation, and I will do everything I can to make good on your promise that it will be the most enlightening hour you've spent this week.
