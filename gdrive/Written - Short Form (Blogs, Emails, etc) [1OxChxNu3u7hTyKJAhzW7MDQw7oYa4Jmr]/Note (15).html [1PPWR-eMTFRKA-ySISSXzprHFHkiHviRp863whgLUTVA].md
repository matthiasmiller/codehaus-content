# **Note**

Just realized that a lot of the stuff that I'm learning is such a different approach. Especially the fact that we often get into problem-solving mode, which is more of a diagnostics-mode, an analytics mode---rather than staying in the open, free, creativve space. This is exactly what I've been doing. So it's almost like you have one way of looking at the world that is strictly analytical, and then another way that is more exploratory, and free-thinking. And most of my deep insight come from my ability to step outside the problem to consider what's going on inside of it.
