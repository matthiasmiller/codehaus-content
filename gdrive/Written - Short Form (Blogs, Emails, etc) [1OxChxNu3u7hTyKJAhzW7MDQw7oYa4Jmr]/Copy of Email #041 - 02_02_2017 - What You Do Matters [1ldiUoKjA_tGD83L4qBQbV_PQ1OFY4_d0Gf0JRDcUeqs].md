Sometimes life gets us down.

We get involved in a personal conflict. We overextend ourselves with too many commitments. We face disappointment from working hard on a project and not seeing the anticipated results. Sometimes, we simply lose interest in our task at hand.

You can probably list a dozen more reasons why we get discouraged about life and feel like our work doesn’t matter.

The past few weeks, I’ve faced challenging situations that left me stuck staring at what felt like a turtle's pace. If I’m not careful, it can really get me down. I question whether my work makes any difference. I start to believe my entire life will be spent in this mire.

Rational thoughts? No.

Real feelings? Absolutely\!

True prognosis? By no means\!

When I begin asking questions like this, I’ve learned to respond with a resounding “YES\! My work matters\!” 

And so does YOURS\!

I’m going to tell you why and break them down one by one over the next three weeks.

But until then, just remember:

1. You’re probably not aware just how much you’re helping other people, even now.

2. The most important work is often the most difficult and the least visible.

3. You’re (probably) much more aware of everything you’re *not* doing...and probably not paying attention to the amount of progress you’re actually making right now.

Don’t lose heart\! Your hard work is making a difference\!

Keep it up and keep…  
Being the best you\!
