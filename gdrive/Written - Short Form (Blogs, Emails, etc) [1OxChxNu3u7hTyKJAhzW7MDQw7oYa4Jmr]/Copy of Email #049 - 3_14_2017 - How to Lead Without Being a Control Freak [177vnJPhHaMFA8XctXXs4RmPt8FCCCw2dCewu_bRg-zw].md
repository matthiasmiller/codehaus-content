Have you ever worked under a control freak? Someone who can’t accept criticism or suggestions and feels threatened whenever someone questions their ideas?

This can be crippling to work under and it ruins relationships. Of course, no one enjoys working with a control freak and no one aims to be one. 

Yet, it’s the stereotypical driven CEO, right? The high-energy choleric who doesn’t have time for dumb answers or lousy employees. He’s large and in charge and if you put up a fight, you’re out.

As we know, it’s just a stereotype: true in a few cases, but not across the board. Thankfully, rising to success doesn’t mean you have to become a control freak (or any sort of freak for that matter). In fact, the alternative is as simple as changing your mentality.

Leaders become “control freaks” out of insecure ambition. They only see one route to achieving their goal, therefore, any “rerouting” an employee or partner attempts to make is a threat to a highly-cherished ambition. Not only that, but other perspectives are an insult to their intelligence.

Control freaks see only one path--their path--and because they’re driven, they won’t let anyone deter them (or their companies) from that path.

Nobody wants to become a control freak: they’re hard to work with and disliked. So how do we avoid becoming one?

The only way to dodge a life as a control freak is to ***become a Lifelong Learner.***

Lifelong Learners are defined by three traits:

1. They’re transparent: they disclose information about themselves  
2. They invite feedback: they ask others to critique them and their work   
3. They embrace healthy change: they make adjustments according to what they discover through intentional critique

No matter how valuable your end-goal may be and no matter how efficient you’ve made your strategy (or path) to get there--you can only gain by hearing criticism and learning from it.

If you are free to admit areas where you’re growing or need to grow and invite feedback from those closest to you--and learn from it--your momentum will be unstoppable.

I’m going to focus on each of these traits over the next three weeks. Digging in and exploring what it really means to become a Lifelong Learner (and escape exile as the loathsome control freak).

In the meantime, 

Be the best you\!
