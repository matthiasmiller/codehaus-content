Have you ever had someone tell you they can’t do something because of their personality?

Perhaps they say *“I’m not naturally talented at sports,”* as the reason they won’t play tennis with you.

Some might claim *“I’m not a people person,”* to explain why they can’t get along with people or why they don’t go to parties. Others say *“I’m not a ‘go-getter,’”* to explain why they’re slow to tackle a project.

Sometimes this bleeds into our businesses as well. We can give an endless number of reasons to excuse ourselves from doing our job.

* *“I’m too shy to be a salesman. I don’t have the personality for it.”*  
* *“I’m a driven person. I don’t have the personality to care for people.”*  
* *“I’m a pessimist, it’s hard for me to look on the bright side.”*

Sometimes we waste away precious time explaining our undesirable outcomes as a matter of “personality”--time we could spend developing the necessary talents for better outcomes. 

It’s true, we will never excel at certain roles because they don’t align with our God-given giftings and inclinations. However, most times it’s simply a matter of making small changes in our habits to bring about better results.

The question is no longer, *“Does this fit my personality?” but instead, “How can I get the right outcomes by changing my behaviors while harnessing my natural strengths?”* 

For example, are you really naturally incapable of playing tennis or are you simply disinterested? Are you really incapable of looking on the bright side or have you merely trained your mind to draw attention to the negative?

Many of the things we blame on our personality are really habits we’ve formed over a lifetime of practice. They could be traits we developed on our own or traits our parents subconsciously taught us through example--either way, they are not embedded in our DNA.

Next week, I’ll share some tips on how to discern between personality traits and learned habits.

Until then, keep asking yourself, *“Am I doing (or not doing) this from my God-given personality or am I merely using it as an excuse?”*

And as you chip away at negative habits and form better ones, you will increasingly…

Be the best you.

**Personality vs. Learned Traits**  
Most of us spend WAY too much time explaining our undesirable outcomes as a matter of “personality”, not recognizing that much of the time, there are small things we could do that would change the outcomes, such as:

* I don’t have a personality for sales.  
* I don’t have a personality to care for people.  
* I don’t have a personality to get things done.  
* I don’t have a personality to look on the bright side.  
* More ideas??

Or, “I’m not naturally talented at sports.” … which is often just a reason that we give ourselves for our poor outcomes, or our lack of interest or even commitment. 

At the end, these all become limiting ideas.
