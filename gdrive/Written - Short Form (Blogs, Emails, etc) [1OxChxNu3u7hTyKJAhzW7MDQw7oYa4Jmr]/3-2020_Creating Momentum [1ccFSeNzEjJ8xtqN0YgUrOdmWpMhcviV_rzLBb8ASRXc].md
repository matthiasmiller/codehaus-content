# **The Death of Time Management**

Before we get started, I want to warn you.

This newsletter might tick off some people. And if you SHOW it to some people, you might REALLY tick them off.

I'm going to ask you to read this with an open mind, and here's why. I believe that what you're doing right now is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

This isn't some kind of "let's start off with some feel-good encouragement", although that never hurt anyone\!

What I mean is this..

The things that you're working on are the things that will ensure that my children and grandchildren live in the type of world that's best for them.

And not just them...

You're doing that for MANY more people.

I'm going to ask permission to step on your toes a little bit, and I'm 100% comfortable asking for that. The process I'm describing in this newsletter has been VERY unsettling for me. I've had to deal with quite a few insecurities, and I've had to risk ticking off a few people in the process.

I'm also going to have to ask you to think outside of the conventional way of thinking. It's not hard to explain why.

I don't know who you hang out with, but have you ever noticed the primary word people use to describe their lives?

Busy.

Busy with work. Busy with deadlines. Busy with meetings. Busy with family obligations. Busy with community obligations.

Never enough time. Never quite enough energy to do the things that really matter (or at least, to do them as well as they deserve).

If that's the life that you want, no worries. Skip this newsletter. :-) 

However, if you're willing to be challenged a bit, you're going to want to grab your coffee, tea, or jug of water, pull out your pen, and prop up your feet, because you're going to enjoy this one.

I'm going to take you on a journey.

## **Where True Time Management Starts**

A year ago, a team leader, a coach, and a team member met in a top floor conference room in Denver for a day of strategic planning.

We had done some planning before, but never at this level. And we had a very unique approach.

The focus of the planning was not on doing more. It was a deliberate attempt to do LESS.

Let's work with fewer people. Let's do fewer things. Let's cut things way back.

We walked out of that meeting with a crystal-clear picture of what we needed to do.

The best thing?

We set the goals so low that we KNEW we could hit them. No question. (If you've ever heard the advice about multiplying your goals by 10x, it sounds great in concept, but it only works in specific situations. Most times, it adds to the overwhelm and actually works AGAINST you. It's important for you to win consistently.)

We hit our goals, started making significant progress, then met again in September for a second strategic planning day. This time, it was in a basement meeting room with leather couches, huge whiteboard, and a big screen TV.

We dialed in our focus again.

We walked out of that meeting knowing with certainty what we were committed to.

And that's where true time management starts.

I think it's completely meaningless until you strip away all the noise, all the busyness, all the activity and you narrow it down to the ESSENCE of what you're doing.

This is WAY harder than you might think. However, I think it's one of the most overlooked factors of success. You've got to be able to filter through the noise to find what truly matters.

Once you've narrowed your focus in on one thing, get ready, because...

## **You vs. the Whirlwind**

Every day in leadership is an all-out war against the whirlwind of life. The moment I stepped out of that meeting, I was confronted with emails, texts, calls, requests for my attention.

Conventional time management says that I should prioritize and triage them. Do all these time management activities that (quite frankly) I've never really been good at. My brain can't handle that type of complexity.

We knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that our focus was highly strategic. We knew it would help us move forward. And yet...

That pesky whirlwind threatened to derail us.

That's when we decided to dig in our heels and start to fight like crazy.

We've started doing some pretty unconventional things, but first, we've got to understand some core concepts.

## **Reactivity vs Proactivity**

The first warning signal was the fact that I love to help people. Sounds like a good thing, in the right context. If you put it in the wrong context, it'll be the first thing to derail me.

We realized that we had to narrow my focus to very specific things. Here's where people start running into issues.

Their inner critic starts jumping up and down and waving its arms telling you:

* Nobody else can do it as well as you.  
* You're going to disappoint people if you stop doing this.  
* You have to reply to every email.  
* You have to pick up the phone when someone calls. What if it's an emergency?

The list goes on.

The trouble is, every time someone sends you a text, writes an email, or gives you a call, they're imposing THEIR agenda on you.

Which means you're making an INTENTIONAL CHOICE to stop doing the things that you decided were most important.

Which is the very thing that I talked about at the beginning of the newsletter. The things that people like me, like your board, like your donors, like your clients are EXPECTING you to do.

You can't have it both ways.

You're either working proactively or reactively. You can’t do both.

So here's what we did.

## **Structure Your Email by Importance**

One of the best places to start is by unsubscribing from everything except what you absolutely MUST have. If you must stay on a subscription, create three folders in your inbox:

* Email subscriptions you read daily  
* Email subscriptions you read weekly  
* Email subscriptions you read monthly

This can ease your fear of unsubscribing, but to be honest, you'll find that you can probably go through most of the weekly and monthly subscriptions and unsubscribe once you see how little value you get from them.

(By the way, you can set up your inbox to automatically filter emails into the right folder. However, I don't think you should be the person to do it. I'll explain why later.)

You can also create folders for:

* Senior leadership  
* Board members  
* Staff  
* Significant donors

Rank them in order of importance. If you're busy, go ONLY into those folders and answer those emails. Nothing else.

We implemented this, and it was a great start, but we still had an issue.

## **Email is Reaction Distraction**

We live in an age of popup notifications. On your phone. On your computer. Everywhere you turn.

If you have social media alerts turned on on your phone, open up your settings and turn them OFF. I've heard from many people that they've felt a bit of withdrawal when they've done this. This is not a conspiracy--it's just that you really do get a dopamine boost by those alerts, and they're pushing you in the wrong direction.

Turn off the popups for your email. Start training people to reach out to you by a text message or phone call when it's truly urgent.

By the way, turn them off on your phone AND your laptop. No need to have both.

Important note here: I didn't make this change overnight, so give yourself permission to grieve the loss of your social media. However, you should put this newsletter in a drawer and pull it out six months from now. If you've taken my advice, take a look at the improvements you've experienced. If not, it'll be a good reminder to try again\!

Even after I'd done that, it didn't take long to realize that email was one of the worst distractions for me. If I started working on a project, I'd see a new email, think I could respond quickly, get lured into a rabbit hole, then forget what I'd been doing when I resurfaced.

You're likely to experience the same thing with phone calls. Again, here's the thing.

Phone calls are people imposing their agenda on you. It's not cold or heartless to leave your phone in another room or turn it OFF for a period of time. If you have a parent who's severely ill and you're expecting a call at any moment, figure out a way to make sure you can get the call without being bombarded by other requests.

You do not have to respond to texts or DMs immediately, either.

Listen...I fully expect this to be a difficult change for most people to make.

It's also why most people in this world are overwhelmed, underproductive, and unfulfilled. They're not focusing on what matters.

My readers span the religious spectrum. If you're offended by Christian ideas, jump to the next paragraph\! However, if you happen to have been raised with some kind of religious guilt over refusing to follow other people's agenda, remember that Jesus Himself followed an agenda that was NOT the agenda of the people. He also deliberately "turned off his phone" by retreating into the wilderness. Don't bring false guilt on yourself by trying to imitate a false agenda that others place on you.

So...

The real question was how to tame this email distraction.

## **Let's Beat This Thing Into Submission\!**

I'd already enlisted help managing my inbox, because I had so many people vying for my attention. However, up to this point, I was still in my inbox managing emails.

You've got two approaches moving forward:

1. Keep managing this yourself (with some creative tools)  
2. Get help managing it

If you're managing this yourself, one of the best things you can do is create a new email address every year. Tell all the people who NEED to have close access to you, and start checking that email every day. Keep your primary email around, and make a commitment to only check it once a week.

Yep, and I can already hear the objections\! "What if I miss something?"

Which is exactly my point.

By checking your email, responding to messages, and reacting to others, you ARE missing something.

You're missing your focus. You're missing your creativity. You're missing your deliberate emphasis on the most important thing you could be doing.

That's option 1\.

The second option I believe to be a far better option, and it's the one I use. It will be the most effective if you have someone you can absolutely trust. It must be someone who will never steal from you, backstab you, or betray confidentiality. This MUST be someone who has your complete and total confidence.

Like option 1, I created my own private email address. It should be for a VERY small circle of people. I've chosen to only share with team members. After all, the further you open it up, the more you allow other people to get into your headspace.

Every day, I've got a team member who goes through my main inbox, sorts emails, and jumps on a call with me. We talk through the emails, hand off as many tasks as possible to someone else, and he forwards to my private email the few that I need to respond to personally.

This has two benefits:

1. It's VERY clear how much time the inbox is eating up. If I have a lot of frivolous emails I'm answering, that email call may take an hour.

2. It creates a quiet space where I can work on the things that matter the most.

Still, I can hear the objections. But before we get to those, I want to add a little more fuel to the fire.

## **Can We Meet for Coffee?**

If you think email and text messages are a distraction, how about the requests you get from others to "go out for coffee"\! Here's what we realized.

Most times, when people ask to meet with me, it's because they have a specific agenda and it doesn't align with what I'm trying to accomplish.

Don't get me wrong...

I DO believe in spending time with friends. I DO believe in the benefits of chance encounters. I DO believe in the sparks of creativity when you get around other people.

I just don't think it usually happens with people who ask you to "go out for coffee". Most times, they're not exactly clear what they want from you.

It's tough for me, because let's face it--I love people, I love brainstorming, I love helping others. And to be honest, sometimes I feel guilty saying no.

Instead, what I've started doing is referring them to my team member who asks them a few questions to understand why they're wanting to meet. He’ll either refer them elsewhere or work with them to schedule a meeting with me.

(Yep, it's true--I rely heavily on other people to schedule my calendar.)

Meanwhile, we make sure that we intentionally reach out to people who we might be able to add value to, or who might be able to add value to us.

Okie dokie...

Now that I've got you all worked about about how inhumane and rigid this system is, let's talk about some of these objections.

## **All the Reasons Why You Shouldn't**

I think there's something important you have to realize. It's not just that YOUR time is valuable. It's that OTHER people's time is valuable. Unfortunately, I've been the person who reached out to others and set up meetings without a clear agenda about what I wanted from it. Because of that, I wasted my time.

If you need help figuring out what you need, let's talk about that. But let's not spend time going in circles, because YOU were put on this planet to do more than have meetings with people to go around in circles.

Big mindset shift for me, because I realized it was self-serving to allow people to meet with me when there wasn't a clear value to them.

And then...

There's the people who say this is cruel, heartless, and that I don't care about people. All I care about is results. All I care about is my schedule.

Let me be clear.

I can care about people BECAUSE I do this.

As soon as I wrap up this newsletter, I'm getting in my car and going home to spend time with my family. I would NOT be able to do that if I had not put these systems into place.

In fact, I'm writing this newsletter BECAUSE my head is clear. It's not full of the clutter of other people's requests or agendas. It's not full of noise or chaos. It's shockingly clear.

If this newsletter allows you to focus more intentionally on the people you are SUPPOSED to serve, I've already proven my point.

Let me make one thing clear:

Not all emails are bad. Not all text messages are bad. Not all meetings are bad.

Remember my opening remarks about having a clear vision and a defined outcome? Without that, you have no guide to know where you should be focusing your time.

If you're SUPPOSED to be spending time with certain types of people, then of course your answers will be yes\! (However, even then, you can do that in a way that doesn't eat up your energy and focus.)

## **Dismantle the Rules of the World**

I believe that many people live under layers of obligations, expectations, and guilt because they've never fully broken free from the expectations that other people put on them. (Sometimes it's your OWN expectations for yourself\!)

Most people will NOT tell you to stop meeting with others so that you can do the things that are the most important.

I'm here, in your face, risking offense, because I believe your work (and the relationships close to you) is THAT important.

Surround yourself with people you need so you can…

 Lead courageously\!
