**Target: 240**

Remember the days when neighbors helped each other during hard times? Well, did you know those days are still around? Our team came across a delightful story from McKinley Corbley at the *GoodNewsNetwork.com* and just had to share it with you.

When Jennifer Austin brought her husband, Don, home from the hospital after he had a leg amputated, she suddenly realized he couldn’t get up their porch stairs without significant help. He just wasn’t strong enough to make it up on his own, even with her help.

Just then, Steve Smith, who was driving by, noticed the family struggling and immediately turned around to see if he could help. According to Corbley “Steve then scooped Don up into his arms, carried him into the house, and put the man down on the couch.”

But he didn’t stop there. Less than 24 hours later, Steve came back with his father and built the family a wheelchair ramp into their home.

Corbly quoted Austin as saying: “This stranger saved the day for us twice within 24 hours. He also brightened our spirits that had become increasingly dimmed over the difficult months. Like a breath of fresh air he is, and there is a sense of optimism back in our home because of his kindness. This stranger is now a friend.”

It makes us wonder: Who do we know going through a hard time in their life? What keeps us from doing a simple act of kindness to bless their day and brighten their soul?

You never know when a stranger just might need a little light to make it through their day. All it takes is open eyes and a ready heart.
