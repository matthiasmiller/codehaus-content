Bobby is a typical five-year-old who can’t stay focused on an activity for even five minutes. His mom takes him to the playground to burn some energy while she does paperwork. But Bobby, whose mind never lacks creative adventures, skips from tree to bush to squirrel, and his Mom is the one burning energy. 

Last week he was intent on defeating Captain Blackbeard back at the playground. But that was last week’s adventure. There are way too many trees to climb, villains to find, and new adventures to start for Bobby to stay at the old, boring playground. 

Let old Blackbeard have the monkey bars. The five year is moving on to something more exciting.

Ever felt like a Bobby? So many customers to pursue, budgets to balance, and employees to manage. It’s easy to drift into cyberland to retreat from the follow-ups and budgets. Constantly bouncing from idea, to distraction, to responsibility, back to distraction, you feel you’re getting nothing done but exasperated exhaustion. Now it’s midnight and you need to wake up in six hours.

You keep telling yourself you need to be more disciplined and focused, but you find yourself meandering to activities more interesting or engaging at the moment.

Meanwhile, nothing really gets done.

So, how can you stay focused on the present?

The ability to be “present” is built directly upon your ability to build practical boundaries around your life, work, and emotions. 

Take advantage of the boundaries already built for you:

1. Turn your cell phone on “Do Not Disturb” so you can focus on strategic tasks.

2. If you find yourself distracted by social media or email while doing computer work,  use an app like “Self Control” (for Mac users) or “Cold Turkey” (for Windows users) to temporarily block certain websites.

Intentionally disconnect from your work at the end of the day, and choose not to check your e-mail on the weekend. Do what it takes to cut distractions from your life\!

Most importantly, develop “Strong Yes’s.”

Every “No” can be overpowered by a stronger “Yes.”

Don’t say “No” to Facebook. Say “Yes” to a productive day, a successful business, and a free evening with family. Yes, even say “yes” to rest\! 

Those e-mails will still be there when you get back to work on Monday morning.

“Strong Yes’s” overpower distractions and enables you to make the most of each opportunity by living 100 percent in the moment.

When you live fully in the present, you are free to give life your full attention, do what you really love, and know that life will take you where you want to be. Be kind to yourself and live in the present\!

Your best you is in the present: be the best you\!

# **Boundaries, Presence, and Worry**

I have a theory that the ability to be present is directly connected to being able the draw solid boundaries in life, including having solid emotional boundaries, work/life barriers, and strong yeses.

**And that worry is often just trying to solve something you cannot solve in the present, and a poor boundary with your problems. When you relegate your problems to when you can solve them, you can trust both the work and creative process to resolve them. **
