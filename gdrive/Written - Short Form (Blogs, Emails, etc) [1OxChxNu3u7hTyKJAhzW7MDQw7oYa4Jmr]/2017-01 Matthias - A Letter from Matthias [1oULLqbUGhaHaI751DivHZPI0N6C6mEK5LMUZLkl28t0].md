**TARGET: 175**

My three-year-old son wanted a train ride for his last birthday. He’s fascinated by trains. However, , but we didn’t just buy him a ticket: we gave him a pair of red noise-blocking earmuffs, just his size, so he could enjoy his ride without being overwhelmed by the ear-splitting train whistle.

It reminded me of entrepreneurial life.

Anyone, especially an entrepreneur, becomes overwhelmed when the noise in their life increases past a comfortable threshold. The question for those wanting to do and be more is simply, “How do I deal with the overwhelm?”

Noise often points to a place where we’ve overcommitted to or need help from a system, process, or team member.

Just like my son, we all need to protect ourselves from uncomfortable noise. By making a daily habit to lower the noise in your life, you’ll increase your awareness as a leader. It will allow you to proactively resolve issues before they escalate, and it will help you can maximize your make the full impact you want.

What red noise-blocking earmuffs do you need?
