## **Vision for Your Identity**

When you live by your GPS, you are not merely looking at what you are trying to do. You are looking at who you are trying to become. You are developing an identity, and internal perception of the person who you are becoming.

If you want to be a businessman, it's time to start living like a businessman. If you want to be a social reformer, it's time to live like a social reformer. If you want to be an author, live like one. This doesn't mean being silly and living beyond your means. It means reshaping how you think about yourself, and it means starting to look at the world through the lens of the person you want to become.

This sense of inner identity will be an inner compass that will guide you throughout your life. Learning to think of yourself as an author, for example, will allow you to make decisions in alignment as an author.

In each of the decisions and junctures of life that you face, you can ask yourself a simple question, "Would a great author do this?" Do not look at your situation merely from our current point of view. Look at the situation from who you want to become. By doing that, you will continually be aligning yourself with the person you want to become, and you will start changing your situation to match.

Many people believe that structure follows success. Once you become successful, you begin to implement certain habits and behaviors. The opposite is true. Your habits, behaviors, and mindsets are the foundational keys to success. By setting a vision for who you want to become, you will always have a place to guide you.

Many people live only in their current circumstances. They look at their circumstances and they tell themselves, "You have no visible success. You're not an author." They continually sabotage their own success because they're basing their perception of themselves on their circumstances. It's self-defeating, because you can't live like a great author if you don't see yourself as one, and you can't see yourself as one if you don't start living as one.

You just have to show for life one day, and say, "You know what? I'm an author\!" Do that, continually. Keep living that way, and one day, you will look around and see the things that everyone else is pursuing, and you will be struck by this realization, "You know what? I really am an author\!"

You must learn to live bigger than your current situation, or you will never outgrow your current situation. It may seem unnatural or arrogant to you right now, but it's not. It's humility to embrace the person that you were made to become. It's pride that uses it to the exclusion of others, pushing others down.

You will go into a process of growth. You may encounter bumps in the road. You may fall down. You may make mistakes. You may even annoy a person or two.

But you will find that this sense of identity will be an inner compass that guides you in your life decisions. You will start making choices that will develop you into the person you want to become. You will find yourself internalizing one of the most powerful elements of the GPS: your personal identity.

Learning the mental discipline to separate your circumstances from your identity may be one of the most challenging mental disciplines you will face, but it will set you free to pursue your dreams.

## **Your Life Message**

We've dug through many different facets of the unchangeable parts of your life. It's a great exercise, because it forces you to think about what you're about. It forces you to examine the reason you believe you were born.

Now, we want to take all of that and condense it down to a simple message. When you die, people won't recall your mission statement. They won't recall your vision. They might recall some of the things you did, but more than likely, they will recall the person you were and the cause that you represented.

Martin Luther King, Jr. will always be remembered for his mantra, "I have a dream\!"

Mother Theresa will always be remembered for serving the poorest of the poor.

Nelson Mandela will always be remembered for his great leadership in forgiveness and reconciliation.

Each of these individuals did many things in their lifetimes that were also noteworthy. And yet, when everything was said and done, people remember only one thing about the individual.

That's the power of a life message, because your life is a message. You are living it right now. Each of your actions and your choices are writing that message. Is your message worth remembering?

All of your life matters. Some of the most respected leaders in history made some of the biggest mistakes in their personal lives. Choosing your life message isn't an excuse to sideline parts of your life. It's not enough to bring change to the world, while your children or spouse are neglected.

This message must touch every part of your life, and it must be present in relationship. It must be present in how you relate to your spouse, to your teenage children. It must be present in how you relate to the stranger passing you on the street, and to the people you work with. It must impact how you do business.

What will it be for you?

When you take everything that you've done, and you've boiled it down the pure essence of who you are and what your life meant, what will it be?

Every time that you meet someone, you have the opportunity to write something on their hearts. You have the chance to infuse them with something--hope, inspiration, significance.

Your life message has to be something that you're passionate about and that you care about, something that surfaces in your life continually. It has to be something that you remain committed to throughout your life, a lifetime focus and endeavor. It must be something you're willing to commit your time and energy to infuse in every relationship.

Take a few minutes right now and write a few phrases that you think are core to who you are, things that you want to be remembered for. Don't skip ahead\! Remember, the benefit is in doing it right now\!

Going back over the list, ask yourself which of these is the most important to you. Which of these is the most central to who you are and how you want to be remembered?

---

You may adapt, you may adjust, and you may edit. But your life is a message to the world. Live it intentionally, knowing that although people may remember you for many things, most of them will remember you only for one thing.

Make sure that the one thing you are remembered for truly matters to yourself, but most importantly, that it truly matters to the people you left behind.

## **Journaling**

As we wrap up the section on your life message, I want to leave you with a really simple practical tool to stay on track with your GPS.

We all hit times when we need to regroup and refocus. Last night was one of those nights for me. I had growing levels of stress, and after I came home, my wife suggested that I take some R\&R. I knew I needed it badly.

I filled a backpack full of books, grabbed my earbuds and my laptop, and headed to the coffee shop. I ordered my coffee and dropped into a chair, and stared into space, just thinking. I'm sure I looked a little unusual, because I sat there for ten minutes before I even touched my coffee.

I just took the time to sit and reflect. I thought about the problems that I was facing in my business. I thought about the challenges raising a family. I thought about how well I was doing taking care of myself, and the problems I was facing trying to keep myself recharged.

I grabbed a notepad out of my backpack and just started taking notes. I drew diagrams and wrote lists. Some were ideas for what I was going through, and sometimes simply describing the problem. But I didn't rush myself. I had no agenda, no specific problem I had to solve. I only knew that I had a hundred things bouncing around in my head that needed to be cleared up.

Then I started digging through my computer.

I have a folder on my computer with lots of files--lots of weekly reviews, monthly, yearly strategies, personality assessments, mission statements, and coaching notes. Whenever I find myself losing my way, I take the time to go back through some of these documents, finding the pieces that are relevant to me.

I reviewed some of the notes from some of my mentors. One of them was a performance review (one of the few I ever received)--and his observations were golden\! The other was from another mentor who met with me almost weekly for an entire year, in one of the most difficult seasons of my life.

As I reread some of the notes and the journals, I realized just how far I had come. I had made significant progress in my life. I'm not the same person I used to be. I've changed, for the better\!

But as I read, I also realized a lot of places where I've missed the mark. I've lost track of where I wanted to be and who I want to be become.

I hunched over my laptop, and just started to write. I wrote about the things I was going through, the challenges I was facing, and the person I wanted to become. I checked in with my purpose, my vision, and my mission. I let go of the pressure that I had felt to be anyone besides myself, and I truly embraced who I was and where I was in life.

Here's what I realized.

Life can be deceptively busy. When we are overwhelmed by the things that are going on, we often miss the things that are truly important. And so often, we are so busy going from one step to the next that we forget to recognize the significant growth that we're experience. We forget to celebrate everything that's happened. And we forget to recognize the huge amount of growth that's happening in our lives.

That's the power of reflection and journaling.

I know that everyone's personality is different, but One of the most powerful was I've found to remain checked into my GPS is simply this habit. Make it part of your routine. Do it consistently. Learn how to regroup and recharge.

## **Conclusion**

You were meant to live life on purpose and with intention and direction. That's why you crave a sense of direction. You were born to make a difference and an impact, and you were born to be remembered, not forgotten.

You were born to leave a legacy. You were born to live a life that is so many times bigger than yourself.

How you do that is determined by your values, your purpose, your vision, and your mission. Those are the big-picture pieces that will keep you on track, keeping you in sync with the person you were created to be.

No one else has your personality or your interests. You were not made to replicate others' successes. You were made to create your own successes, built uniquely on the person you are.

Go out and live life bold. Dream bigger. Live bigger. Embrace the person you are going to become. Make a difference, and live for cause that truly matters.

Be intentional to stay the course, never drifting, and you will find yourself making a bigger difference than you imagined.
