Sheri Nisly \- “When I first signed up for the *Multiply Your Strengths* newsletter, I wasn't quite sure what to expect or how relevant it would be for my ecommerce business. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how many of the core principles taught were easy to apply to my specific situation. Being a business owner can be quite lonely at times when I am surrounded by folks who do not understand the unique challenges and tough decisions I am faced with every single day. In *Multiply Your Strengths* I found not only a cheering companionship but a brilliantly fresh perspective of different ideas and insights I had not thought of before. I am grateful to the team for providing such quality content that continually encourages and inspires me to keep propelling my business forward and persevere no matter what obstacle I happen to be facing\! “
