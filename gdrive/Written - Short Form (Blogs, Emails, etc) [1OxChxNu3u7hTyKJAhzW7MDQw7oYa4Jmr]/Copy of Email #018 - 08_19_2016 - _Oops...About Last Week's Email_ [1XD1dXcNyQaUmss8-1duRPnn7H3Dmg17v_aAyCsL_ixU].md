Perhaps you noticed something a little different about last week’s email: there wasn’t one.

I didn’t plan to mention it. Chris, who’s responsible for scheduling the emails, went on vacation last week and forgot to schedule it. However, he encouraged me to write about, and we agreed it was a great story to share.

Here’s the deal: While I could have dug out the password, logged in, and double-checked that Chris scheduled the email, I didn’t do that because I believe it implicitly destroys trust.

We build accountability through ownership, not through micromanagement. I work with people to take ownership of projects, which is exactly why Chris suggested we candidly talk about it in this email. That’s the level of ownership he has taken--he quickly took initiative to clean up his mistake, and he’s making sure it won’t happen again.

Building a team means trusting other people, which means, quite frankly, they will sometimes make mistakes and let you down.

However, here’s what I’ve learned: leadership becomes significantly easier when I choose to rely on my team, give them whatever support they need, then turn them loose, trusting they’ll find the best way to achieve outcomes. In fact, I’m learning to shut my mouth because most times, Chris has better ideas than I do.

What about you? 

If you struggle to trust your team, perhaps you’re leading them incorrectly or perhaps you’re simply holding onto the lie that says “it’s faster to go alone” or “I can do better than others.”

It’s only as you learn to lead effectively by trusting your team that you and they will be able to...

Be the Best You\!
