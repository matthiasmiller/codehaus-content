# **Boundaries, Presence, and Worry**

I have a theory that the ability to be present is directly connected to being able the draw solid boundaries in life, including having solid emotional boundaries, work/life barriers, and strong yeses.

And that worry is often just try to solve something you cannot solve in the present, and a poor boundary with your problems. When you relegate your problems to when you can solve them, you can trust both the work and creative process to resolve them.
