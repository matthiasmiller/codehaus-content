## **Leveraging Your Values Against Themselves**

The third time I found myself stuck in a rut at work, I knew I had to make intentional moves to break out of it. I began looking for ways to embrace my values at work.

I started by looking for ways to embrace growth in my role. Because I was already technically skilled in what I did, I was given little opportunity to grow myself technically, so I looked for other opportunities. This growth opportunity moved into my personal life. I began asking myself difficult questions like, "How can I learn to thrive in a work environment like this?"

I always gave up, if it hadn't been for the support of my wife and some of my close friends. I realized that it truly was possible to become larger than my situation. Whereas every other time in my life, I had tried to change my situation to improve my satisfaction, I began embracing my situation. This internal process, though very difficult, was aligned with my value for growth. Recognizing the internal strength I had developed through this process motivated through it.

In fact, I even adopted a mindset about work, that I could grow myself to the point of learning to love my work, despite its relative unimportance to myself. As strange as that might sound, that helped to re-instill some of my personal values back into my work.

I also leveraged one of my other values--that of impacting the lives of others, and helping others reach their potential. I began to work directly with a coworker, mentoring him in his role and helping him become a better developer.

These are examples of how you can leverage your values against themselves. When you find yourself in a situation that compromises your values (but not moral values), you can leverage other significant priorities against them.

## **Learning to carry your values**

The challenge, then, is learning to carry your values. When you get up in the morning, how do your values affect your approach to life? How do they affect the choices you make?

Developing a very simple awareness of your top three priorities will give you a grid for measuring your sense of fulfillment in your role. If you are in a situation that is uncomfortable to you, it allows you to turn them into simple questions.

For example, if two of your core values are compassion and relationship, and you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, you can ask yourself:

* Is this in conflict with my core value of compassion?

* Is this in conflict with my core value of relationship?

No matter how this affects your decision, simply having a litmus test for the discomfort that you feel can help you restore your sense of direction. Even though these are your values, you may be required to compromise them for the sake of something bigger, but recognizing the conflict will give you the strength to embrace the conflict, and it will give you words for the conflict.

Many times, we fear that we will lose our values when we find them in conflict. For example, I often feared that I would lose my personal value for growth if I lost myself in a job that didn't push me towards my potential.

While I could have resigned myself to that, I have found, rather, that when I have found myself in values conflict, it hasn't served to discourage me. Rather, it has served to either strengthen my values or to clarify them.

As I have mentioned, I have a large value for personal growth and improvement. However, this value also works against my personal value to influence others, because my appetite for growth and change violates people's sense of safety and comfort.

The challenge, then, is to remain completely true to who I am, while giving others permission to be themselves, and relating directly to the values that they hold. I have recognized this and wrestled with this, not in theory, but in direct, real-life relationships. I have found that by being in relationship with people whose values are different from mine, I have first of all strengthened the values that are important to me.

However, I have done more than that. I have clarified my values in regards to the people around me. I have clarified values that demonstrate an appreciation and care for the people around me. Although the process has not always been easy, the clarification of my personal values has been more than worth it.

Many of us are afraid of situations or people whose values differ from our own, because we are afraid of losing the values that are important to us. We fear this, because we are uncertain of the fruit that this conflict might hold in our lives. As we learn to embrace the conflict and be in relationship with people who are different than ourselves, we can provide clarity to our own values.

If you are living in fear of losing your value, you've landed in one of two camps. First, you are trying to protect a value that is not your own, and you know that if you are influenced by someone else, you will not be able to maintain that value. Second, you hold pride in your own value, and you have your own personal agenda to have others embrace your values.

If you are embracing a value that is not your own, you need to work through the process of learning to embrace the value to make it your own, or you need to embrace the truth that you have not embraced it as a value. At any cost, you must be honest with yourself, even if you say, "This value is something I know I will embrace. Yet, I haven't embraced it yet."

If you hold pride in your own values, you will find yourself threatened by people who are different from you, and you will find yourself creating false enemies, because you will see those who are different as those who are at odds. It is true humility that is able to embrace values in the middle of differences, and remain true to them without trampling others underfoot.

## **Living by Priority**

Before you can really know where to turn your focus and where to turn your efforts, you must know your top priorities. This is the importance of knowing your values. You cannot make an impact and you cannot be in alignment if you do not know what is most important to you.

The most fundamental, most basic, is your values.

Your values are the air in your tires. As you go down the road of life, your car will travel more smoothly with less wear if your tires are full of air to the right pressure. However, if you pick up a nail and the air starts slowly seeping out of your tire, you'll find your ride becoming bumpier. You'll find yourself drifting to one side of the road or the other. And if you keep on going, you'll completely ruin your rims.

You values are the air in your tires. Have you ever noticed some people who seem to be fully engaged in life, always going from one thing to the next, and seem to never experience burnout or fatigue? The secret is not the number of cups of coffee that they drink. The secret is living in alignment with their values. Just like a tire will wear if it's out of alignment, so our lives will wear if we are out of alignment.

All of us encounter situations that poke holes into our values. It's a commitment that we make that takes us away from our priorities. It's a relationship that influences us away from who we know we were meant to be.

The answer is never to keep driving on a run-down tire. The answer is to pull off to the side of the road, pull the spare out of the back of the car, and keep moving until we can repair that tire. When we've repaired it, we reevaluate our lives and keep moving.

If you find yourself drifting in life, the first place you must start looking is with your values. Do you have an awareness of what your values are? Second, are you living by those values? That is the foundation for being able to navigate successfully through life.

## **Navigating Through the Unknown**

You values are critical when navigating through new territory and new opportunities.

Business owners recognize that not every opportunity to make money is a good opportunity for them, because not every opportunity is aligned with who they are and where they want to go. But the most important question to ask is always first, whether the opportunity aligns with their values.

For you personally, not all opportunities will have the same benefit to you. Sometimes we become so anxious to take opportunities that we forget exactly how many opportunities await us, and we take opportunities that are in conflict with who we are and who we want to become.

In many cases, however, the difference might not be between a "yes" or "no". It might simply be a question of how you approach your role, especially if you are in a position of leadership. When you are in leadership, you establish the values for your team, either indirectly by exemplifying the values in your life, or directly, by working with your team to clarify them. These are situations where you have the ability to shape situations are important values.

Your values are the first anchor to you focused as you move into new arena. These are the most important things for you to maintain a sense of your direction. If you have moved into a new role and feel like you have lost your sense of direction, this is the first question you must ask yourself.

What are your values? What are the things that are the most important to you? Either discover or recover them, and you've made the most important step in navigating through the unknown.

## **Protecting Your Heart**

People fear losing their heart. They fear that they'll marry someone who doesn't share their values, or they'll work for someone who doesn't value their values. They're afraid of getting stuck in situations where they lose their heart--they'll lose the ability to keep in touch with the things that are the most important to them.

Protecting your values means protecting your heart. It means being the guardian of your heart, and watching over it. It means staying connected to it, and listening to it even if it feels like it's trapped within your chest.

Many people know when their heart feels like its stifled. That's your clue that your values are out of sync. That's when you must listen to your heart--give special attention.

All of us can undergo significant hardship if we are required. We hold must greater potential than many of us realize, or than most of us care to realize. The true potential can only be discovered in hardship.

But there are two kinds of hardship. There is hardship that we embrace while our hearts turn hold as stone. We disconnect our hearts, and we tell ourselves that the things we care about don't matter anymore. Maybe it's the dream of a life-time relationship with someone special. Maybe it's the dream to travel the world, or be a world-changer. To break the pain, we simply turn off our hearts. It's in that world that hardship is the most difficult to endure.

But there's another hardship. It's the adversity of life. It's the hardship of a dream that's beating within our hearts, refusing to be silent. It beats, time and time again, crying to see the light of day. We push against life, and time and again, life seems to beat us down, but we refuse to give up. We face the grueling work of bringing these dreams to life. It's harder than we ever imagined, but it's also easier than we ever imagined, because we face this hardship with our hearts full alive.

That's what it means to live life fully engaged.
