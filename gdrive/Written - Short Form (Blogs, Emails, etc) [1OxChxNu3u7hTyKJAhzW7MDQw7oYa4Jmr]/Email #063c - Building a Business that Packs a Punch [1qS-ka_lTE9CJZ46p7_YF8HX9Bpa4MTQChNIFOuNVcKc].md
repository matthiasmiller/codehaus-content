* **Building a Business that Packs a Punch**

Three emails on Gravity:  
Email 1: Introduction  
Email 2: Proximity  
*Email 3: Mass*

What's the difference between businesses that have strong market appeal and seem to win in the marketplace, and businesses that don't?

The answer is simple: Gravity.

The law of gravity is at work not only in physics, but also in business. It's a measurable force that's at play as you build your competitive advantage. As you remember from your physics class, the law of gravity has two components: distance (or proximity) and *mass*.

We talked about proximity last week. This week, we’re talking about the second factor, mass.

Mass is the amount of substance an object contains. The more mass an object has, the stronger the gravitational pull. The less mass it has, the weaker the gravitational pull. This is why an electrically charged balloon sticks to your head instead of your head sticking to the balloon. Your head has mass, the balloon just takes up space without any actual mass. (This is also why the moon revolves around the earth, and not vice versa.)

We said last week that the closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients will be. However, being close to your target market has little impact if you don't have mass. Without it, you cannot attract your target market. And without it, they will not be attracted to you.

So what is mass, and how do you build it?

(By the way, if you're a non-profit, you can apply these exact concepts to donors, volunteers, and other giving opportunities. In fact, non-profits actually have a tremendous opportunity to strengthen their gravitational pull.)

**Size Does Not Equal Mass**  
Mass is simply the amount of matter in a business. However, within that definition is a simple nuance that's worth uncovering.

Apart from matters of distance, why does the sun hold a stronger attraction than the earth? If you're in elementary school, the simplistic answer is that the sun is bigger than the earth. However, that's not entirely true.

When it comes to gravity, the issue at stake is not size but mass. The amount of space occupied does not equal the amount of matter.

Why is this important?

As businesses grow, many of them begin to occupy larger amounts of space. They take over their market and capitalize on their economy of scale. However, unless they're careful, they increase their reach without increasing the strength of their business. They bloat like a balloon

That's when they become vulnerable to disruption. A smaller company discovers how to significantly increase the amount of value they provide, and even though they lose by a space advantage, they have strength within their small rank and they begin to win the market. They pop the balloon

This is an important rule to remember in business: mass does not equal space occupied. It’s not about taking up more space than the next guy. **It’s about who packs the biggest punch.**

**~~The mass of your customers or clients~~**

**Building Mass**  
When you begin to look at your business from the perspective of mass, not merely size, you begin to measure based on the impact you're having on the market and the value you're providing to your people.

***What are specific ways that you can increase mass?***

1. *You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority.*  
2. *You can provide guarantees.*  
3. *You can find ways to delight your customers.*   
4. *You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service.*   
5. *Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider.* 

Again, the business that measures itself by the value they provide to the customer (rather than the size of their company), will be the one who owns the gravitational pull.

Be that one.

Be the best you.

Proximity: The closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients.

You can have Goliath companies that occupy all kinds of industry real estate, but when you look inside, they've got very little fighting power. Meanwhile, you can have smaller David companies that are much smaller on the surface but pack a powerful punch.

Without offering up specific names, some of the large advertising firms have a broad presence but provide extremely sloppy and poorly managed ad campaigns for their clients. It's not uncommon for well-educated, savvy consultants to easily outperform these big companies.

You might see a Goliath whose inwardly rotting away.

*What are specific ways that you can increase mass?*

6. **You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority.** You might produce hard, results-oriented case studies, or simply capture testimonials from your happy customers or clients. You might leverage a story of overturning a sacred ideal within your industry. You might seek out other platforms to establish your credibility with interviews, books, articles, etc. It's worth something to do business with someone who's respected in their industry.

7. **You can provide guarantees.** Many businesses are scared of offering guarantees because they're afraid people will take advantage of them. However, many times the benefit far outweighs the cost. You might guarantee freshness, quality, timeliness, or effectiveness. If you're in an industry where business owners scoff guarantees (or if you doubt whether you can offer one), you're probably in a ripe opportunity for a guarantee.

8. **You can find ways to delight your customers.** Hunt for the right spot for your team members. Make sure the person on the phone has a smile on their face (yourself included\!). Make sure the people doing fulfillment have the detail and follow-through required. Have a team member send reminder text messages or phone calls.

9. **You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service.** Find ways to get better results at a substantially lower cost. Automate the pieces that are human. Humanize the pieces that are automated. Reduce the response time. Find a way to improve the results.

10. **Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider.** To borrow the words of Margaret Thatcher, "If you have to tell people you’re \[a person of integrity\], you aren't." However, if you can prove to people that you have integrity (especially in businesses that require high trust), you've just increased the value you provide.
