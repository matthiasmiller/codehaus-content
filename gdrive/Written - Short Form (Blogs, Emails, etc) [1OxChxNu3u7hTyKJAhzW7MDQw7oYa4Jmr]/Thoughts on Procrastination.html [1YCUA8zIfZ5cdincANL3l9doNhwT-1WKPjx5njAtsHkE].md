# **Thoughts on Procrastination**

From Linda Rose:

I've read the warning about perfectionism frequently, but in the housekeeping arena. FLYLady says that perfection is the biggest enemy of good housekeeping. We think we don't have time to do it right, then we don't do anything. One of her mottos is, "Housework done imperfectly still blesses your family." which I have adapted to my situation, "Housework done incompletely still blesses my home."

From Me:  
I'm just getting back from vacation, and I was struck by how profoundly this touches a lot of people's struggle with procrastination. Great way to cut to the root of it. Thanks\!
