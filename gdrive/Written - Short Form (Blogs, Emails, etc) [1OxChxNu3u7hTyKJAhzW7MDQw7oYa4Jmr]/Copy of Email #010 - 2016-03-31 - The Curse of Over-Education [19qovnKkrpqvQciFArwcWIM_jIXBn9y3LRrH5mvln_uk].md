American education demands that we get our education before we start our career. While this is true for brain surgeons, it's generally false for entrepreneurs.

Last week I wrote about how important it is for us to live from who we are: “Be Yourself,” as we’re often told. Living from who we are (being), brings clarity about what we are supposed to do.

“But,” one might say, “before I do anything, I should learn all the in’s and out’s of accounting, leadership, business development, sales, and a hundred other things I should know, right?”

Actually, not necessarily.

Most of us get detained learning everything we think we must know before pursuing our vision. We get so busy reading books, we never step out and take action.

In reality, we should live our lives like this:

1. Ask: “What do I absolutely need to know to take the next step?”  
2. Take the next step.  
3. Repeat.

We as entrepreneurs are often held back by indecisiveness--we’re afraid of hurting our business or revenue by making the wrong decision. But needing to correct a mistake is better than doing nothing at all.

Don't get caught in analysis paralysis. You’ll find that taking the next step will unlock more answers than a thousand books.

Always remember, be the best you\!
