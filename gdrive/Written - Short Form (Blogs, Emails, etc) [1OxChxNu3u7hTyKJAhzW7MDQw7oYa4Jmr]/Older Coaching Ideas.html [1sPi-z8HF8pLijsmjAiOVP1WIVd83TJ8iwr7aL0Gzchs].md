# **Older Coaching Ideas**

**MatthiasM 03/10/2014**:   
From BaPLC: 

The coach's intention is to build the long-term capacity and capability of the client.

Having the client take *action* is only one aspect of the client's change process--often the most observable and quantifiable aspect, but not necessarily the richest, most enduring, and most satisfying outcome of coaching.

...However, the benefits of coaching accrue because clients build their capacity and create greater capabilities for the long term--for life.

**Matthias Miller 03/13/2014**: 

We expect others to push ourselves, even God to push us,

when what we need is find our internal motivation that has been deposited in us

**Matthias Miller 03/13/2014**: 

Talk about how BEING precedes DOING

**Matthias Miller 03/13/2014**: 

Talk about how mindset can fuel passion

**Matthias Miller 03/13/2014**: 

f you are defined from the outside in, you are actually letting your LIFE shape you instead of SHAPING your life

You cannot follow your heart if your identity is on the outside. you must break to an identity that comes from within, so that it will carry you through life.

**Matthias Miller 03/17/2014**:   
One of the worst things about blind spots is that you can't see them.

Can you have an inner peace in an outer struggle?

fulfillment starts now--not then

**Matthias Miller 03/24/2014**:   
What you fear, you empower.  
Fear of pride is not humility.

**Matthias Miller 03/24/2014**: "When people have a purpose in life, they enjoy everything they do more. People go on chasing goals to prove something that doesn't have to be proved: that they're already worthwhile."  
\-Spencer Johnson

**Matthias Miller 03/24/2014**: Many people live superficially. If you can live deeply from a transformed life, you will live a life of influence.

Transformed people transform nations.

**Matthias Miller 03/23/2014**:  Double mindedness sometimes look like...."I would like encounters with God, but would I listen?" Sounds like balance and realism, but Is it? It sounds more like fear.

**Matthias Miller 03/31/2014**: The "shoulds" of your life are your red warning lights. Instead of questioning our "why", we question our "will", not knowing that we are yearning for something *stronger* to compell.

**Matthias Miller 03/31/2014**: If someone is making a DEMAND of you, it is a sign of CONTROL. Unless you are doing something illegal or immorally wrong, turn and RUN.

**Matthias Miller 06/30/2014**: write an e-mail about my failures and mistakes \-- somehow?

**Matthias Miller 07/06/2014**: when you stand for something, you will have someone stand against you. the fact that you stand for something often creates a line in the sand, and some people will take great strides to make sure you know they don't share that line.

**Matthias Miller 07/07/2014**: As a world changer, you are going to be different. how do you support yourself in that state?

**Matthias Miller 07/21/2014**: Business is a 1st class kingdom citizen

**Matthias Miller 07/21/2014**: Wealth is a byproduct of creating value. The pursuit of wealth does not work in business. It must be about creating value for others.

**Matthias Miller 12/12/2014**: What if vision is not just for the what, but the who...the identity. And What if the now but not yet would be related to vision not just identity?

**Matthias Miller 01/20/2015**: 3 seconds to beat yourself up (olympic athelete), and the ability to ignore obstacles. some things get power only when you give them focus

**Matthias Miller 01/20/2015**: Self-promotion isn't selfish or proud. Rather, it's victimization.
