“A house divided against itself cannot stand.”

We’ve all heard this quote. We all agree it makes sense. Whether civil war or fractured management, division will always weaken a nation or an organization.

This is never truer than when it comes to the focus of your business.

Many of us think our focus is unlimited. We think we can give our attention to multiple pursuits and goals while still getting positive results.

But stop and think about the real, physical focus of your eyes for a second. The notion that you could possibly “split” your focus in multiple directions is foolish. It is impossible for your eyes to focus on two places at one time, let alone three or four places\!

The best we can do with our eyes is shift focus quickly between two different locations. But constantly switching your focus back-and-forth handicaps you from moving toward either location.

The same is true in business.

We’d like to think splitting our focus 50/50 between two projects will simply take twice as long, with no time lost in the end. However, in actuality, it will likely take 3 times as long or longer. The more you split your focus, the less valuable your focus becomes.

In order to get great results you must maintain an almost obsessive focus.

**This is because focus has a compounded effect, giving it exponential power.** The more you’re focused on something, the more likely you are to notice other side effects which spring from it.

**Further, I would argue that focus is more important than time.** The value of your time is entirely contingent on how you spend your time. If you spend an hour working on a project which in the long run does not push you further toward completing the ultimate goal of your business, you’ve wasted that hour.

The question I ask more than anything is not, “Do I have the time for this?” but “Do I have the focus for this?”

Mental space is a limited resource. Don’t give it anything which won’t deliver. Any projects, activities, or thought processes you give your focus to, should pay their rent in order to take up your mental space. The more you want to grow, the more you will find yourself obsessing about what things you allow to occupy that space.

By only allowing the ideas and projects which will propel you to your goal to take up space in your mind and focus, you can do your best work.

This obsessive focus will bring your best results.

And as always, be the best you\!

**Focus \--- Proposed Subject has the concept of “not getting buried by distractions” or … not being reactive, interrupted by your phone, etc etc**

Singular focus always beats multiplied effort.  
A divided focus is very expensive.

We all have limited resources, and many of us think that our FOCUS is an unlimited focus, allowing us to spread it across multiple things while still getting positive results.

However, focus has an exponential power to it. Splitting your focus 50/50 between two projects does NOT mean that the projects will take twice as long. More likely, it will mean it will take 3x as long. The more you split your focus, the less valuable your focus becomes.

Getting great results and outcomes often comes from an almost-obsessive focus, because it’s through that focus that you get dynamic results.

Also, focus has a compounded effect, because when you’re focused on something, the more likely you are to notice other things on the side that will benefit it.

I would actually argue that FOCUS is more important than TIME. The question I ask more than anything is not, “Do I have the TIME for this?” but “Do I have the FOCUS for this?”

Mental space is a limited resources, and things have to pay their rent in order to be there. The more you want to grow, the more you will find yourself obsessing about what things you allow to occupy that space.
