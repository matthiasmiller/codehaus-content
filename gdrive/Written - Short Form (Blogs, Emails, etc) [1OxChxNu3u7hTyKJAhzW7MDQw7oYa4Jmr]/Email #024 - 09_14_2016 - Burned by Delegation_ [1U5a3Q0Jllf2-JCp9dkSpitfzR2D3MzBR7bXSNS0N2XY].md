Most leaders know they need to delegate. Unfortunately, many leaders have been burned by delegation because their employees neglect their tasks or are unable to fulfill them. This brings the responsibility back on leader who has to pick up the slack. And this robs him of precious time he doesn’t have.

If this is you, perhaps it’s because you’ve been delegating wrong.

There are two styles of delegation: *Task-based delegation* and *Outcome-based delegation.*

**Task-based delegation** expects the employee to fulfill a check-list of tasks. Rather than communicating clearly what outcome he wants, the boss simply says, “Please go do tasks A, B and C. I’m here to tell you what to do.”

Because the employee doesn’t know the desired outcome they can’t troubleshoot solutions around any problems they encounter. Thus, they have to go back to the leader who will then come up with a solution and give further instructions. 

This treats people like little machines. It’s prone to burning not only the leader out, but the follower as well. 

Task-based delegation inhibits creativity and initiative, which completely smothers potential for explosive growth.

There is a better alternative to *task-based delegation.*

**Outcome-based delegation** places ownership for the outcome on the individual employee. Rather than saying “Go do A, B, and C,” the boss says “These are the results we’re looking for. You have the freedom to find whatever path serves you and the business best. I’m here to help wherever you need it.”

Sharing responsibility in a healthy way encourages your team members to ***take ownership***. This encourages creativity and initiative among followers and frees leaders to focus on the tasks only they can do.

This is when explosive growth happens.

*Do you find it hard to delegate? Have you ever been burned by delegation? When has delegating been especially freeing for you as a leader?*

Tell me about it in an email\!

And as always...

*Be the Best You\!*

Delegation is not merely handing off your “to do” list to somebody else

* Solution:  
  * The most primitive rule of delegation is clear communication of expectations  
  * There are two kinds of delegation:  
    * **Task-based delegation** \-- Go run this errand, take this to the post office. This ends up treating people like little machines, and is more prone to burning them out.  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** \-- where people are responsible for and vested in an outcome (such as overseeing/streamlining office work), which always directly ties back to moving the business forward  
  * The difference is *NOT that the person doesn’t* go to the post office. The difference is that it’s based on *the person’s own initiative*, and it’s tied directly to the outcome.  
    * **Task-based delegation** \-- The boss might say, “please go to the post office and get stamps to mail off these letters”  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** \-- letters need to be mailed. The person may choose to stop by the corner store (which is closer) to buy stamps and drop them in a dropbox. OR, they might choose to always have extra stamps on hand, so they can consistently spare themselves the trip to the post office….or they might question the “how” even further, and start emailing certain things instead of snail-mailing them and follow-up with a text to let the person know, etc  
  * Another way to say it:  
    * **Task-based delegation** says, “Please go do tasks A, B and C. I’m here to tell you what to do.”  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** says, “These are the result that we’re looking for. You have the freedom to find a path that serves you and the business the best. I’m here to offer help wherever you need it.”  
  * **Outcome-based delegation** does *NOT work with “tell me how to do it” people*, so you have to find people who are able to think on their own and are willing to question how they’re doing it.  
* Further, sharing responsibility in a healthy way encourages your team members to ***take more ownership***, not less.

Original opening:  
Sadly, many leaders are so busy, they lack time or energy to move their organization forward. Usually, this because they don’t delegate.

It is understandable that leaders would struggle to delegate because they likely know exactly how they want things to be done. In their minds it is easier to do it themselves. This fills their time with odds and ends other people could just as easily do. 

Leaders should focus their time and energy on what only they can do, and delegate the rest.

Unfortunately, many leaders simply hand off their “to do” list to somebody else, without communicating clearly what outcome they want. This is not good delegation.

In fact, there are two styles of delegation. One is task-based and the other is outcome-based.
