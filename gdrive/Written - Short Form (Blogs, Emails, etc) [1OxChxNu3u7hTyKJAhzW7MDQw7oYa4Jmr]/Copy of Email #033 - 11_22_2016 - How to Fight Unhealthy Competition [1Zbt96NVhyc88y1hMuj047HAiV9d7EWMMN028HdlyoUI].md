A couple of weeks ago I wrote about healthy and unhealthy competition.

When people’s worth is measured by performance, healthy competition is smothered. But when worth and performance are disconnected, healthy competition thrives and camaraderie goes up.

If someone extracts their worth from their ability to win, competition becomes very nasty and unattractive.

So what do we do when we find ourselves in such an environment?

We can do two things to fight an unhealthy competitive environment.

**First, we can step back and evaluate our own mindset.**

Are *we* linking *our* self-worth with our performance? When we “lose” or “fail,” do we see ourselves as less valuable or do we see an opportunity to learn and grow?

**Second, we can nurture a healthy environment around ourselves.**

Let the people around you know you value them no matter how well they perform. For example, you could bring encouraging notes or gifts for your coworkers (or friends or family) to remind them they have value whether they win or not.

**Third, we can remember some people thrive on competition while others don’t.**

We should make the necessary adjustments in our work systems so everyone can thrive and do their best.

Trouble doesn’t come from competition, but from letting failure (“losing”) define us. So turn unhealthy competition upside-down and remind yourself and those around you that there’s more to life than winning.

As always, be the best you\!

We should give them the how-to in doing this:  
\- Don't be tacky  
\- Don't be overt, but subtle. being overt will ruin it.  
\- Tell them by leaving encouraging notes, unrelated to their performance  
\- Take them out to eat, but don't necessarily talk about their performance.  
\- Do things for them  
\- Serve them  
\- Bring them gifts  
\- These things tell them they have value regardless of how they perform
