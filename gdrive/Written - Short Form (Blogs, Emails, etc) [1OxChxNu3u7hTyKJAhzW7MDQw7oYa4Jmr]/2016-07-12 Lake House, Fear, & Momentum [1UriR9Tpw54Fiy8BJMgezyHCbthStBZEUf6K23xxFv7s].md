Last month we went on vacation with my wife's family, spending two days at a beautiful lake house in Nebraska. I'm a landlubber, so I envisioned myself relaxing on a sofa in an air-conditioned den with a few great books.

My wife had other ideas, finally convincing me to go tubing with her. Let's be honest...I'd never done it, and I was apprehensive at best. Halfway through the ride, something shifted inside me as my fear gave way to raw adrenaline.

It was one of the best moments of our vacation.

As I walked off the dock, my mind exploded with insights. Fear, I realized, is simply a precursor to momentum. As I jotted notes in my journal, I knew immediately I had to share this story (which ironically meant facing more fears\!).

I can't possibly share everything I realized in this moment. However, if you will find the places you've held back out of fear, you'll discover the places of some of the greatest breakthroughs for yourself and your business. Don't hold back\!
