**From Facebook \- What is the hardest part about delegation? Why?**

“People doing it wrong” \- Hans Mast

“Trusting that someone else will put the same love and attention into it that you want to.”- Jessica Yoder

“I think the hardest part of delegation is trust. Being able to step away from something and truly believing it will get done correctly. Also, the other part that is tough is being able to give good accountability without being overbearing.” \- Joshua Kettle

“Feeling guilty that I'm burdening someone” \- Elizabeth Harshbarger

“This isn’t quite along the lines of your question but more about a particular response— some say it’s hard to delegate because the other person might do it wrong (I’d consider myself included in this)— but for me personally the deeper question is why am I afraid of the other person not getting it right or not doing it like I would?” \-Tina Miller

“Being afraid that I'm coming accross as bossy or controlling” \- Emily Fern Stoltzfus

“Communication and lack of discernment\!” \- Judy Shepard

“In the interest of transparency, my flesh sometimes feels bad that they will get the accolades for a job well done. I know, it's a dark spot in my soul.” \- Matt Parker

“Not seeing the big picture. Or the details.” \- JuliaRuth Miller

“It is difficult, at times, to articulate the vision so those to whom you delegate can execute on that vision. Also, as others have mentioned here, trusting others to accomplish the task to a level with which you would be satisfied. I think the fear of others not getting it right is rooted in an individual's own insecurity and a fear of failing. Ultimately, if you delegate and the person fails then their failure is a reflection back on you. Rather, people should embrace failure as an opportunity for personal growth and for the opportunity for another person to feel they can fail with the grace to fail and learn from it. Delegation is an opportunity for failure and success. For both parties involved. I believe the fear of failure and fear of negative repercussions are at the root of not wanting to delegate. Just my two cents.” \- Jacques Cavosoz

“Restraining myself from delegating too much, to soon \-- cause work getting done without me doing it is crazy awesome.” \-Craig Miller

“Fear that it won't get done especially if you've been let down in the past.” \- LaDonna Joy Nice

“That the job got done twice as fast better than I could have done it by a person half my age...with little appreciation for how hard it was just to get the job in the first place? \#youngpeopleareannoying Jk ….Seriously though sometimes for me it's so much easier to just do it myself...especially if the passion for excellence is not visible. It's also giving up a task that you worked hard at perfecting at the risk of mediocrity. Yes them there's this thing called pride and laziness ( to lazy to teach) that can get us.” \- Mark Nissley

“Delegate \= you give up that it will be done your way” \- Nancy Lapp

(Reply to above)   
“That can cause serious problems. I have had it cause huge problems. You are the boss and employees need to be teachable and follow directions. Otherwise very easily that person thinks they are now the boss and run with their vision.   
I was way to lenient and employees were doing what they wanted to do when they wanted to do it.   
And were offended I did not approve of their vision.” \- Judy Shephard

**From other sources**

I was talking to Brad last night, and he mentioned that INTJ's (Myerrs-Briggs) tend to gravitate to where they see a gap and want to fill in the missing pieces. It made me wonder if at least part of the struggle with delegation could be personality.

**From LinkedIn \- “Fred, I see we're connected on LinkedIn but haven't communicated. I'm planning to write a number of articles answering questions on team building and delegation. Curious if this is something you'd find of interest, and if so, if you've got any specific questions you'd like me to address?”**

“One of the issues I see most regarding delegation is the mindset of "this person won't do the task as efficiently as myself". How do we train our brains to let go ?” \- Tim Otwell

“Definitely Matthias, the topic is of interest. I don't have any specific question but would be happy if your articles could mention as to how team building is an important factor to sustain growth. How this platform allow everyone to be out of their comfort zone (at the workplace) and yet freely expresses and share ideas. \- Amrit Chutoorgoon

Hi Matthias, for the delegation, how about a para on 'delegation is not only about instructions OR it is no longer my responsibility...it is a part of the building blocks which is sustained through team building'” \- Amrit Chutoorgoon

“Sounds like some great information. Love to see what you post.” \- Dean Benton

“I am very interested and my questions are varied\!  More later thanks for contacting me\!” \- Don Byars

“Thanks for reaching out. I would be interested in that topic, but at the moment I don't have any specific questions. Looking forward to hearing what you have to share\! “ \-Katie DeBusk

“Hello Matthias, I'd recommend conflict management. Do you need a more specific or detailed idea?” \- Vivian Hymer

“Thank you for reaching out\! I think your articles will be greatly beneficial. I don’t have any questions for you to address at the moment but if I think of something I’ll let you know. Warm regards, Corrie” \- Corrie Leber

“Yes\! I do have questions\! Just a little background on me. I have been part of both great teams and bad teams. If I don't like a work environment I leave. Before I leave, however, I try to reconcile as best I can. I've had many bosses tell me " you can come to me about anything, I want to hear your opinion, etc." This is not the case. It seems to me every time you approach the "leader" of an establishment and state your concerns (i.e. an other sales person stealing a sale from you), it only makes matters worse and more tense. Managers say they want to hear your concerns and then minimize the problem, tell you something like "be the bigger person and keep up the good work". It has been awful\! My questions is, for the sake of a team, how do you approach a manager in a constructive way? I hope this helps you, I have many more questions.

Like, how do you suggest team building to an owner? How do you tell him company parties don't count?

Maybe this is off topic because you are writing about team building and I am asking how to implement team building as an employee?” \- Brittany Geisler

“Sure. How do you build and synch teams across sectors and multiple organizations” \-Scott Nelson

“Nothing comes to my exact mind, but a good one is always focusing on doing things only you can do.” \- Bob Clark

“Hey Matt. Good to hear from you. I have a question. How intertwined should the relationship between sales and marketing team members be?” \- Christopher Root

“Thank you for the invitation. Do you have experience/insight with developing remote team(s)...Actually, I'm thinking that my colleagues would benefit from wisdom and insights on team building and delegation... specifically related to remote teams. I look forward to seeing your articles and sharing them with others….Here's a little more insight... I'm the remote guy who has been tasked with developing a team, but the "main office" folks struggle with delegating authority... this shows up in many ways, but one is the direction I receive changes from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the perceived needs of the main office rather than the needs of the remote team. One quarter, I'm asked to look for service staff. The next quarter, I'm asked to look for sales staff instead. (each of the candidates I bring do not meet the (unspoken) expectations of the decision-makers... this is a much broader organizational issue, which feels like a rock-hunting exercise.). Then, the company is not seeing enough quarterly profit, so we put all plans on hold for a quarter or two. (again, a much broader organizational issue... leading me to conclude we're not ready to make the leap.)

Another issue is one of communication and expectations... I often find that expectations are not clearly communicated remotely. I think I receive a "hey, how are you?" phone call about once every 3-6 months. All the rest of my interactions are conference calls, purely business-related, or initiated by me... and then people wonder if I'm even still out here when I'm reloading my pipeline.” \- Jon Barron

“I have one person I volunteer with that is very stubborn. It's pretty much his way or the high way, and when you deny him of what he wants, he stirs up conflict in the group. What suggestions do you have regarding working with this person?....I guess in general, I'm wondering how you would handle a difficult team member. Is there anything specific you'd do with them regarding delegation?” \- Vivan Hymer

“Thanks for reaching out, I'm always interested in good articles. I don't have anything specific I'm interested in hearing but I look forward to what you come up with.” \- Gary Ford

“Hey Matthias, I think I can help with a question. In team building and relationships one thing that remains a bit or art and science is setting expectations but also not being to strict with boundaries that it degrades the natural flow of report and comradery that should be cultivated. Is there some formula or insight you have on this.” \- Brock Predovich

“It’s nice to meet you\! I guess my main question would be what do you do when your team seems to be drifting apart rather then building together? What aspects need to be changed?” \- Beau Thoutt

“how do you address the new to the company/field hire that is added to you established team.” \-Michael Cunningham

“Sounds like a great plan. Have you considered using the Enneagram?” \- Yann Larrieu

“I am very interested in learning more about team building and delegation. Where can I read your articles?” \- Sue Sanicky

“Matthias  
Yes I think it would be very interesting, but I’d have to think about what questions I’d have.  
I travel with a company out of MN The Springs is my home base   
Thank you   
Tom” \- Thomas Levlocke

“Interested\! I have no specific questions at this time, but I might as time goes on.... Thanks\!” Benjamin X. Wretlind

“I’m not really in a leadership role with my organization but I’m always interested in team building \- particularly how to make it less boring or less awkward. Hope that helps. I look forward to seeing your stuff.” \- Jedd Hafer

“Yes. Looking forward to reading.” \-Ronald Clanton

“Hi Mathias,  any light you could shine on working with team mates that are time management challenged would be of huge interest to me. Don't know if that is a viable subject, or not...hope this helps\!” \- DJ James

“That is great\! Team building is essential. One thing I think we all struggle with at one point or another is building a team with diverse skill sets. We often struggle with the need to be the best at everything, however when I changed gears and started focusing on being the best leader for my company, and started hiring people that were far better than me at my weaknesses, we truly started to grow. It was okay to not be the best at everything, I needed to be the best at what I brought to my companies dynamic.   
Maybe addressing that and unpacking that would be good for your article. “ \- Nicholas Dockweiler

“Mathias yes I would be interested in learning more” \- Florian De Castro

“Sure...How would you start if you have never had to do it before?” \- Leslie Garcia

“I don't have any questions at this time. Though I would love to see an article on shifting a business culture. I know there is no one set formula, but that is what I am currently trying to do in my department (with the hopes of it spreading). I want to allow my place of employment to build the leadership bench, get employees to care about the work they are doing, and encourage people to contribute at an individual and group level for more productivity and expanding our service/product line to benefit our end consumers. “ \- Alec Kirby

“I think one thing that is very important in team building is communication. Lack of communication regardless of it is positive or negative can crumble any team.    
If you would be able to come up with an article for the best 10 ways to keep communication within a company that would be amazing. I would like to get all of my staff on the same level with communication. Some are overbearing and others are too reserved. I have implemented several ways for employees to communicate within the company for what ever reason it may be and it still seems as if there is a communication issue. If you have any questions feel free to message me. I could possibly give you what works and what does not with in my company.” \-Barbara Reyes (Velie)

“Hello, Matthias. I can't say that I have any specific questions at this time but it is something I would be interested in” \-W.Garrett Goggans

“I’m interested. I would like hearing your thoughts on what to do when things go wrong. Specifically, how you take ownership of problems and create solutions vs passing blame.” \- Sean Genung

“I don’t have any specific questions. I’ll be looking forward to reading your articles.” \-Jason Blair
