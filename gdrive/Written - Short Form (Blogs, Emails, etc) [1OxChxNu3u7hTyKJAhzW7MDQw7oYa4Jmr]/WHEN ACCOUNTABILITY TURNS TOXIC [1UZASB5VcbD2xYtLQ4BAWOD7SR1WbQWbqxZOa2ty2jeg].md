WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY TURNS TOXIC. Sometimes people react negatively to the idea of accountability. However, it's an important part of moving any organization forward.

In fact, it's an important part of moving our lives forward.

I've noticed two reasons accountability becomes toxic.

1\. Accountability becomes toxic when people aren't foremost accountable to themselves. Accountability with others is always meant to be a safety-net, never a tow-rope. Each individual needs to take ownership of their own outcomes.

2\. Accountability becomes toxic when people don't ask for and receive the help they need. When this happens, accountability just becomes a way to shame each other for not measuring up or trying hard enough. Because it doesn't resolve the underlying issue, it creates a cycle of failure.

When people are accountable to themselves and receive the help they need, they can correct their course even when they fail.

Healthy accountability is incredibly empowering.
