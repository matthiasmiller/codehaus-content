The paratroopers of World War 2 will always be remembered for their courageous feats which led the way for D-Day. However, they would never have survived Normandy without air-support and back-up. Thrown headlong into the chaos of a warzone, teamwork was not a matter of convenience. It meant survival.

Entrepreneurs face threats to their business, every single day, both inside and outside their business. The small business survival rates speak the cold reality:

* Nearly 66% of businesses survive the first two years.  
* About 50% of businesses survive the first five years.  
* Only 33% of businesses survive more than ten years.

Starting a business is a lot like going to war. 

The life of an entrepreneur is a test of vulnerability. Unless you can trust other people to provide protection and support, you will be decimated.

Entrepreneurship takes courage and perseverance through pain.

Gather people around you who believe in and will fight with you. Trust that your family, friends, or partners have your back when you’re under fire.

It demands vulnerability and humility, but that’s where courage and freedom are found.

Don’t take these comrades for granted. Keep them close, show gratitude, and reciprocate the support.

Friends like these enable you to be the best you.
