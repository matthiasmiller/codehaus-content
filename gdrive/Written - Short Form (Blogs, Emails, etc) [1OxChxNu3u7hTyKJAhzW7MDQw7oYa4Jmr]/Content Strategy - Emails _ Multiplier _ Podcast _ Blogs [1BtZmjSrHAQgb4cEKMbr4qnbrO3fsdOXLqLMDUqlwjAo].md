Emails

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

Purpose of emails: to nurture our customer base

Ideas:

- Do a run endorsing our book  
- Be okay with 100 word emails as well as 500 or a little higher

We’re going to try doing a 1 to 3 ratio of problem/weakness emails to solution/strength emails. This results in essentially month long email blitz’.
