It’s often tough for entrepreneurs to focus on the big picture of their big goals. Because of this, we often find it difficult to stay proactive in taking the small steps that keep our business moving forward toward our goal. 

We face an assortment of demands every day--deadlines, emails, text messages, random drop-ins from friends or customers--and we get lost in the chaos. Instead of being *proactive* in taking the important small steps, we become *reactive* to all the demands constantly assaulting our attention.

To help navigate this chaos, a few years ago I started implementing a basic morning routine. I knew a routine would consistently set me up for daily success. However, I didn’t have the structure I needed to sustain it. In fact--I have to admit--I didn’t *want* the structure to maintain it because structure felt limiting, cold, and lifeless. And so, the routine faded away.

I’ve struggled with this off and on, but nothing has ever really worked and I’ve constantly moved from routine to chaos, then back to routine. 

That is, until recently. 

This past month, I’ve started using a new planning system designed by Alex Charfen. It’s designed to:

1. Help me focus on what’s most important  
2. Help me resolve any issues slowing me down  
3. Help me focus on the places where I’m winning  
4. Remind me to be grateful for all of the good things that happen to me on a daily basis

Your focus determines your direction. Not only that, whatever you focus on is what you’ll see more of. 

For example, when most of us reach the end of the day with a conventional “to do” list, we’re more aware of the places where we failed or the things we didn’t get done than we are of the things we accomplished and how we moved forward.

Once I started using Charfen’s system, I found myself being more proactive not only in how I spent my day, but also in solving small issues before they became big ones.

I usually hate affiliate products. They’re cheap, salesy, and presented as the “cure-all for everyone.” However, I signed up as an affiliate for this for one reason: It’s a planning system that actually works for entrepreneurs. 

This is not necessarily for everyone.

This system is specifically for visionary entrepreneurs who have tried and failed at conventional planning systems but are still willing to actually give this program a go.

As you continue becoming more proactive and less reactive, it will empower you to…

Be the best you\!
