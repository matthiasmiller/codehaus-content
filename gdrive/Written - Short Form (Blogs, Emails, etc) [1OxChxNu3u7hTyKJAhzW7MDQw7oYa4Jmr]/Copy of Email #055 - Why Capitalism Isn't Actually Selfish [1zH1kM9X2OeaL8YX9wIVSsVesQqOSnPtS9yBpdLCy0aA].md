Many business owners build their companies to meet their own needs. 

To their own demise.

The hard truth is that your customers don’t care whether you make a lot of money, fulfill your calling, or any of that. All they’re thinking about is their own unmet needs.

To be successful in any line of work, you have to focus on what your customers need.

Justine Musk (the first wife of billionaire and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk) put it like this: *“Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what **the world** wants and needs.”*

In other words, ask yourself what your customers want. What are they hungry for and itching to get their hands on? How can you uniquely provide that for your customers? What sets you apart? Are there ideas you could mesh together to create brand new solutions that stand apart from any other competition?

In business, unselfishness is richly rewarded. Build your business strategy around *what the customer wants* and you’ll be unstoppable.

And as you become unstoppable, never forget to…

Be the best you\!
