## **Building a Business that Packs a Punch**

What's the difference between businesses that have strong market appeal and seem to win in the marketplace, and businesses that don't?

The law of gravity is at work not only in physics, but also in business. It's a measurable force that's at play as you build your competitive advantage. As you remember from your physics class, the law of gravity has two components: distance and mass.

When you're evaluating your competitive advantage, you need to look at four specific factors:

1. The proximity to your customers or clients  
2. The distance from your competitors  
3. The mass of your business  
4. The mass of your customers or clients

Last month, we discussed the first two items, related to distance. The closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients.

However, being close to your target market has little impact if you don't have another crucial ingredient: mass. Without it, you cannot attract your target market. And without it, they will not be attracted to you.

So what is mass, and how do you build it?

## **Size Does Not Equal Mass**

The definition of mass is quite simple. Mass is simply the amount of matter in a business. However, within that definition is a simple nuance that's worth uncovering.

Apart from matters of distance, why does the sun hold a stronger attraction than the earth? If you're in elementary school, the simplistic answer is that the sun is bigger than the earth. However, that's not entirely true.

When it comes to gravity, the issue at stake is not size but mass. The amount of space occupied does not equal the amount of matter.

Why is this important?

As businesses grow, many of them begin to occupy increasing amounts of space. They begin to take over their market and capitalize on their economy of scale. However, unless they're careful, they increase their reach without increasing the strength of their business.

That's when they become vulnerable to disruption. A smaller company discovers how to significantly increase the amount of value they provide, and even though they lose by a space advantage, they have strength within their small ranks, and they begin to win the market.

This is an important rule to remember in business: mass does not equal space occupied. This is about who packs the biggest punch.

You can have Goliath companies that occupy all kinds of industry real estate, but when you look inside, they've got very little fighting power. Meanwhile, you can have David companies that are much smaller on the surface but pack a powerful punch.

Without offering up specific names, some of the large advertising firms have a broad presence but provide extremely sloppy and poorly managed ad campaigns for their clients. It's not uncommon for well-educated, savvy consultants to easily outperform these big companies.

While on the outset, these companies appear to have the upper hand, they are often Goliaths who are inwardly rotting away. If you’re going to knock the giant off the hill, you must change your perspective from merely “size and scale” to “mass and impact”.

## **Building Mass**

When you begin to look at your business from the perspective of mass, not merely size, you begin to measure based on the impact you're having on the market and the value you're providing to your people.

This means a deep hunt into the places where you can provide a tremendous amount of value, with a proportionally small amount of effort. If you make this a practice, it becomes a virtuous cycle that turns your business into a lean, toned muscle machine instead of deteriorating into a flabby giant.

Even when you're facing a giant, if you remain creative, you can likely find ways to increase your value. You must look for cracks in their armor, places where they're weak, and capitalize on them.

What are specific ways that you can increase mass?

\[star\] You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority. You might produce hard, results-oriented case studies, or simply capture testimonials from your happy customers or clients. You might leverage a story of overturning a sacred ideal within your industry. You might seek out other platforms to establish your credibility with interviews, books, articles, etc. It's worth something to do business with someone who's respected in their industry.

\[star\] You can provide guarantees. Many businesses are scared of offering guarantees because they're afraid people will take advantage of them. However, many times the benefit far outweighs the cost. You might guarantee freshness, quality, timeliness, or effectiveness. If you're in an industry where business owners scoff at guarantees (or if you doubt whether you can offer one), you probably have a ripe opportunity for a guarantee.

\[star\] You can find ways to delight your customers. Hunt for the right spot for your team members. Make sure the person on the phone has a smile on their face (yourself included\!). Make sure the people doing fulfillment have the detail and follow-through required. Have a team member send reminder text messages or phone calls.

\[star\] You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service. Find ways to get better results at a substantially lower cost. Automate the pieces that are human. Humanize the pieces that are automated. Reduce the response time. Find a way to improve the results.

\[star\] Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider. To borrow the words of Margaret Thatcher, "If you have to tell people you’re \[a person of integrity\], you aren't." However, if you can prove to people that you have integrity (especially in businesses that require high trust), you've just increased the value you provide.

Again, you must measure yourself by the value that you provide to your customers or clients, rather than your size.

## **Your Mindset Matters**

While we've just covered practical ways to increase your gravitational pull, I'd like to discuss one more angle: your mindset.

Don't buy into the nonsensical lie that says if you just change your mindset, you'll start attracting high-quality buyers. Not exactly true. That's why I started with extremely practical ideas first.

However, even if you're a practical thinker, don't dismiss the importance of deeply-rooted beliefs. When they move from merely an opinion to a deeply-held conviction, they will alter how you communicate and present yourself. They will affect everything from your marketing, to your communication with your customers, and even your physiology.

Two core convictions are important.

The first conviction is that no single deal will make or break your business. Believing otherwise is to diminish the quality that made you an entrepreneur in the first place--your ability to innovate, to solve challenging problems, and to create opportunity where none existed before. It will also pull you from the place of healthy power that allows you to make winning negotiations.

Have I lost deals that I thought I really needed at the time? Absolutely\! The more desperate I was for the deal, the worse I positioned myself. The stronger my conviction that I didn't need the deal, the better my negotiation. Even in the deals that I lost, when I embraced this conviction, I found that the loss only strengthened my own positioning. (And often, better opportunities awaited me.)

The second belief is simply having an internal conviction of excellence, a healthy pride about what you do--knowing that you do really great work. Having a conviction of the value you provide to people, knowing that you are exceptional in your work, will create a gravitational pull around you.

These beliefs drive a core emotion--confidence. That confidence, when rooted in truth and the reality of who you are and what you have to offer, will fundamentally alter the way that you do business.

## **Making it Practical**

Just like I encouraged you last month, you should take 20-30 minutes right now to make this practical.

Here's how:

1. Grab a paper and pen. (Yes, you should do this by hand.)  
2. Read back over this article. I've even marked the parts you need to focus on with a little "star".  
3. Write down your strengths and weaknesses--the places you provide immense amounts of value, and the places where you find yourself weak.  
4. Spend some time looking for high-leverage ways to strengthen your positioning.  
5. Make an action plan, then go out and start implementing it in your marketing.

I expect less than 3% of my readers actually complete the exercise. Thinking strategically about your business is challenging, because it flies in the face of our Protestant work ethic. However, those who do it will likely land themselves in the top 1% of business owners.

Be the one to own the gravitational pull.
