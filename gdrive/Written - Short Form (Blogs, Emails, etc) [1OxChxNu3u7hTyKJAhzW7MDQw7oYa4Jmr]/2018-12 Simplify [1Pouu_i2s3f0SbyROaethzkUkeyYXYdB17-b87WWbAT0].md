# **Simplify**

I love the holidays.

It's a chance to step back from life, connect with family, and focus on the things that truly matter.

While I’m enjoying the activity and celebration, I can feel the momentum shift every year around the beginning of November. Life seems to accelerate.

It starts slowly with the last few activities we have to squeeze in before the holiday rush begins, then it drifts into Thanksgiving and the Christmas shopping rush. Before we know it, we're headlong into dressing up for holiday banquets, searching for the last-minute Christmas gifts, responding to year-end donor drives, and squeezing activities into our packed schedule.

All the while, we make a final push in our business to make it our best year yet.

In six weeks, we manage to add layers upon layers of complexity to our lives. We reach the end of the holidays grateful for our family and friends, yet feeling slightly tired without any specific reason for our exhaustion.

Herein lies our first lesson on complexity.

## **Complexity Creeps In Slowly**

We rarely see complexity coming, making it a particularly difficult challenge for entrepreneurs.

You begin offering a certain product, then you offer to include a little more customization.

You enhance your policy on vacation time to treat your employees more fairly, so you include more detail in your bookkeeping.

You add one more critical item to the hundreds of things vying for your attention. The one strategic meeting that could drive your business forward ends up buried in the noise.

You choose to serve a specific customer or group of customers, leading you to spend more time helping them than you anticipated.

Because each of these changes seem small, we rarely see the impact. However, we've all had moments when we stopped to look around and realized our business (and even our life) has taken on significant complexity. As we continue to grow, the demand to manage these complexities increases.

But this extra complexity isn't always because we've been inattentive, which leads us to our second lesson on complexity.

## **All Growth Brings Complexity**

Complexity is a natural outworking of growth.

Do you remember the last time you were in a period of intense growth and personal transformation? During those times, our lives feel utterly chaotic. Our very identity begins to shift, and we find it difficult to make sense of who we are. We see all the multifaceted pieces of who we are, yet with little clarity of the final outcome.

This is a natural, necessary part of growth.

However, blindly eliminating complexity altogether is never the answer. Some people embrace simplicity as the highest good. While it's wonderful to emphasize simplicity, it doesn't make sense to celebrate simplicity for its own sake. When this happens, simplicity degenerates into purposelessness.

As entrepreneurs, our deepest-rooted motivation is simply this: to do more and to be more. We are hardwired to make a difference, help more people, and ultimately, change the world. As a pioneer, it means following clues, listening to hunches, taking risks, and driving forward.

You can’t do that while blindly embracing simplicity. After all, it’s much simpler to find a job that allows you to show up at the same time every morning, do the same job every day, and leave work at the same time every evening.

If you're reading this newsletter, chances are that's not enough for you. You probably have an innate drive to do more and to be more. And if you have that drive, you have an innate tendency to complicate your life.

More training, meetings, committees, projects, and products. More marketing, customers, team members, paperwork, partnerships, and even business opportunities. More, more, more.

This continued complexity is a natural outcome of growth, and we must embrace it. However, we must also embrace simplicity to capitalize on that growth. If you oversimplify during your growth, you will limit your growth. However, if you leave the complexity unmanaged, it will eventually strangle your growth.

This leads us to our third lesson.

## **Complexity Can Be Good or Bad**

Reckless attempts to simplify your life will almost always be destructive.

Just ask the ADD entrepreneur who hires staff willy-nilly, delegates projects by dumping them on his team members, and cuts down his paperwork by hiring a secretary who is as visionary and distracted as he. Unwittingly, the attempt to simplify has only created more complexity.

More importantly, some businesses are built on complexity. They exist because they can manage incredible complex, challenging issues for their clients. If they eliminate the complexity, they eliminate their business.

It's crucial, then, that we understand positive and negative complexity.

While complexity exists within the business, it must follow two critical rules:

1\) Complexity must be hidden from your customers.

2\) Complexity must be isolated within your organization.

If you need brain surgery, you want confidence in your surgeon and a basic understanding of what he will do. However, he should never demand that you understand, much less master, the complexity of what he's about to undertake. As a patient, you need the complexity to be hidden from you, or you might never commit to the operation that could save your life\!

Furthermore, you had better hope the surgeon doesn't need to confer with the receptionist to determine the next appropriate cut. And you're betting your life that when the receptionist needs to go to lunch, your surgeon will stay in the room with you, focused exclusively on the task at hand, not distracted by searching for someone to fill in at the front desk, or worse yet, filling in himself\!

These rules for good complexity are born from our fourth lesson:

## **Complexity Has a Compound Effect**

Complexity amplifies complexity.

Imagine two cooks making meals in two separate kitchens.

Put them in the same kitchen, and you multiply their chaos. Add a time deadline, and it gets worse.

Just like these cooks, when your business has many moving parts that frequently interact with each other, when the lines of communication are unclear, when the responsibilities and accountabilities are blurred, then the complexity of the organization multiplies.

Fortunately, this compound effect leads us into our fifth lesson.

## **Simplification Follows Rules**

Your goal in simplifying is not to eliminate all complexity. Your goal is to eliminate bad complexity and isolate good complexity.

First of all, find ways to eliminate bad complexity, anything not providing value. Most times, we find ourselves surrounded by things that add complexity, not because they were poor choices, but simply because times have changed.

We must all periodically ask ourselves the tough questions:

* Do each of our meeting agendas provide value? Does the meeting itself provide value?  
* Do each of our products or services provide value to our customers and to the business?  
* Do each of the features and variations offer value to our customers or clients?  
* Do each of our customers or clients still provide value to our business?

These questions can become very specific. Do the emails in your inbox provide value?

Sometimes, the answer will be simple. You can merely eliminate the subscriptions cluttering your inbox. It's not always that easy. However, you must be deliberate in eliminating the things that don't provide value to you.

Second, reduce how often employees (and especially entire departments) need to interact with each other.

While collaboration is crucial, it can quickly create bottlenecks and significantly increase complexity. When a business is small, it's easy for your staff to pop their head into the salesman's office for a quick question. It's easy for the cashier to ask the owner a question about pricing. However, as an organization grows, these interruptions become very inefficient.

For example, rather than your staff continually checking in with your sales or leadership team, clarify this through daily, weekly, and quarterly objectives. Establish decision-making guidelines that allow your team members to make the decisions they need to move forward.

Third, reduce the number of people any team member interacts with on a regular basis. For instance, twelve people who regularly interact with each other will have 66 lines of communication among them. If you divide them into three teams and assign leaders to communicate between teams, that number drops to 21 lines of communication.

To be clear, this does *not* mean putting teams into isolation. However, simply establishing leaders to facilitate communication across teams can significantly increase the quality of communication. This keeps each team’s responsibilities, along with their complexities, within their own team while allowing them to collaborate with other teams in the organization.

Fourth, stop specifying things that should be generalized. Lawmakers are notorious for implementing policies for one-off situations. Clear decision-making principles can resolve most of these issues. Sometimes because of unrelated changes, policies become unnecessary over time.

While simplification isn't easy, it leads us to our sixth and final lesson.

## **Simplicity Enables More Growth**

As you may have noticed, we've just redesigned our entire newsletter. This was a deliberate attempt to simplify. It immediately brought *more* complexity. However, this was a necessary process to allow us to simplify further. And we will experience the benefits.

Healthy simplification will always:

1. Increase clarity and peace of mind  
2. Increase productivity  
3. Increase profitability  
4. Reduce stress

As entrepreneurs, we tend to accept more at the cost of complicating our lives. However, the paradox remains that we will invariably achieve more when we embrace the complexity and then wrestle it to the ground to simplify our lives and our businesses.

Let's settle for nothing less than our best.

Let’s simplify.
