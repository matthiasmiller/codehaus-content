seling is helping someone else, but it's also a request for help

People like to assume that they can multitask. However, multitasking is a myth

Even computer processors do not multitask. Instead, they have something called a context switch. They have a set of instructions they are falling, and they momentarily take a break from one to work on another.  
If you develop a habit if multitasking, you may actually be strengthening your habit of context switching, which means that you make it more difficult for you to focus.

I don't know how this fits into the Colby, but it's worth thinking about that angle as well.
