## **Personal Freedom, Part 2**

When I woke up this morning, the last thing I wanted to do was to write this chapter. I didn't have the focus. I didn't have the mood. I wasn't ready to push myself to the next level.

Instead, I was busy feeling sorry for myself. I wasn't dissatisfied with where I am in life.

Ironic, isn't it, that at the hour of the greatest victory, comes the greatest test?

I had to make an intentional conscious choice--that I was not going to allow my circumstances to define how well I'm doing. I had to recognize that I had a choice about the perspective I chose, and how I chose to respond to life.

And here I am, fully engaged, ready to approach my day with full passion and energy.

One of the most important parts of using your personal freedom is learning how to rebound from setbacks, but before that, we need to dismantle something that commonly keeps people trapped, and keeps them from making full use of their personal freedom.

## **The Cause and Effect that Isn't**

If you listen closely to the conversations around you, you will notice that a lot of people assign cause and effect that really isn't true. It belies their choice to be a certain way. Here are some of my favorites:

Personality.

I can't help it that I'm withdrawn and that I don't like spending time with other people. It's my personality to be shy. I'm an introvert=, and that's why I don't allow other people to get close to me.

Nonsense.

I do believe in introversion--don't get me wrong. But introversion has nothing to do with your ability to build relationships with other people. This is just an excuse to allow your personality as an explanation for why you don't want to spend time with other people.

Or how about this one?

"I'm a bold, courageous individual, forward-thinking, and my personality means that I will be interpreted as cold and heartless. I'm very opinionated, and that's just my personality. Some people just don't understand."

Really?

That's not your personality. That's just something to hide behind. You might be opinionated, but you have a choice even in that. You can choose how highly you hold your own opinions and how you allow it impact your relationships. You have a choice how you relate with other people and whether they feel valued or devalued by you.

Don't get me wrong, it's really helpful to understand your personality, but it's one of the common excuses people use to keep them from changing.

Injustice.

"I was driving down work, and this jerk cut me off in traffic. He made me really mad, and he totally ruined my day."

Let's break this down: The driver made you mad. This means, that you had no choice in how you responded.

Furthermore, because he made you mad, you had no choice but to allow your day too be completely ruined.

Let's back up a little bit.

Even if you were upset, you were able to choose whether this was going to ruin your day. But even further, the obnoxious driver did not make you angry. You chose a response to him, and you're responsible for your response.

What about your history?

"My parents were never there for me, and because of that, I will never be able to fully make anything out of myself."

Again, don't get me wrong--everyone deserves to have healthy, happy parents who are fully present in their lives. I've noticed, however, that a lot of people courageously overcome this deficit in a healthy way.

It's an unfortunate start in life, but it's an even more unfortunate ending.

What about this?

"I was never taught how to be successful, and no one in my family was ever really successful. Therefore, I'll never be able to attain success."

Watch the connection between the past and the future. Again, this perspective is completely robbing you of your ability to make choices about the future. You are limited by what you've already accomplished, and you're never going to be able to move forward.

Why?

Because you've given your past more power than your present.

## **Breaking the Cause and Effect**

I've noticed that a lot of people assign cause and effect that is really quite false.

They see their personality causing them to be interpreted a certain way. They see certain situations that cause them to react, instead of responding well. They see their past as driving their actions.

They believe that the situations are causing them to respond that way, instead of recognizing that they are choosing that response.

Breaking that connection is the first step to regaining your personal freedom. When you realize that it's no longer the situations that are driving you to respond, you no longer have to react, but in order to move ahead, they have to look at the underlying cause.

## **The Real Cause and effect**

The biggest problem about our experiences is not the experiences but the negative conclusions we draw about them.

For example, a geeky kid in school will either draw the conclusion that he's smarter than everyone else and that's why nobody wants to hang out with him, or he will believe that everyone hates him because he's not a great person to be around.

One conclusion will lead him to be a healthy individual, embrace who he's been created to be, while the other one will encourage himself to turn inward with self-hatred because he's not a likable person.

The conclusions we draw from life are incredibly powerful, and one of the most powerful tools you have in your toolbox of personal freedom is the ability to choose the conclusions you draw from situations.

By breaking the fundamental beliefs about these circumstances, you can break their power over your life. But it requires that you examine to see what your story is about these situations.

## **Developing an Overcoming Lifestyle**

These conclusions are incredibly powerful. ,and they are the secret to developing an overcoming lifestyle.

What conclusions do you draw from very difficult situations? If you are having trouble paying the bills, what does that say about you? If you are unsure of how to meet a client's demands, what does that say about you? If you're going through a difficult emotional time personally, what does that say about you?

Does that mean you're a weak person?

Does that mean that you're not working as hard as you should?

Does that mean your dumb?

Or does it mean something else?

Does it mean that you're facing the same roadblocks that every other successful person had to face?

Does it mean that rather than being on the brink of failure, you're on the brink of success and breakthrough?

Does it mean that on the other side of this situation is someone who is stronger and more powerful, because they were able to choose their perspective and approach in a difficult situation?

Developing an overcoming lifestyle requires systematically breaking down the things that keep you from moving forward.

## **Trapped**

This morning, I felt trapped by my situation. It's one of the greatest lies we are told about our personal freedom. It's true that sometimes we are unable to change our situation, but our trapped feeling often comes from our inability to see the possibility of change that we can bring within our situation.

We believe the trapped feeling, and we are overwhelmed by this thought, "I don't know how to get through this or get past this."

And because of that, we don't even try.

Even worse, we tell ourselves, "I'm completely alone right now, and nobody understands me."

Truth be told, every successful person experiences situations where they struggle to get back and up and push through the pain. It doesn't mean that it's easy, but it means that it's possible/

And push through you must.

You have to fight your way to a different perspective. You have to find a way out of the mess you found your way into. Not the mess of your situation, but the mess of believing that your situation is hopeless.

For me, it meant digging into my toolbox, remembering all of the things I had learned and start applying them to my life. \+I had to dig for a while, but the moment I broke through, it was like a flipped a giant switch. All the negative energy that I had been feeling turned into positive energy.

All of the hopelessness turned into hope. All of the impossibility turned into possibility. I realized that my situation was not hopeless, that I was ready and able to keep moving forward, to keep pushing toward the goal.

I managed to break the cause and effect, and by doing so, I was able to break the power of the situation, which brings us back full circle.

## **Life Controls You, or You control Life**

Your approach to life will determine how satisfied you are with it. Many people, I discover take life as it comes. This is a useful skill to have, expect when you allow it to rob you of important decisions that you need to make along the way.

This is why so many people feel unfulfilled in their lives, and why so many people die with so much regret--because they were unwilling to make the decisions that they really needed to make in order to have a satisfying life.

As soon as you break your situation's power over your life, you take back power over your situation.

When you break these false cause-and-effects in your life, you become free from the situation, because your situations no longer need to control you. And it's in that place of freedom that you're given the ability to influence your life as you desire.

This is where you have the ability to make decisions objectively, without being yanked around by the pressures going on around you. This is where you're able to live with peace in the middle of a hectic world, because your circumstances don't have the freedom to control you.

From that place, it's up to you to take the steps you need to direct your life. It's up to you to step up to the plate, own your life, and make it happen.

It's no longer about letting other people's demands fill your time,. It's about deciding which things are right for you.

Not everyone has the privilege of accessing your time, your energy or your resources. This is not an excuse to be coldhearted and indifferent--but then, neither is it cold-heartedness or indifference.

It's a deliberate choice that you're making: where will you make your biggest difference and biggest impact?

## **Develop the Lifestyle**

This perspective of the world needs to become a lifestyle--it needs to become a grid for the world that you live it.

In the situations that you are in, you can ask yourself: "What do I believe is causing this?" And then, ask yourself, "What is it, really truly, that is causing this?"

If you've found a cause that you can uproot, you know that you're onto something.

But if you've found a cause that is outside of your control, you're still living as a victim to your circumstances. You've uncovered the falsehood, the facade of what is motivating you. Keep digging\!

Make this a habit. Learn to check in with yourself, and you'll learn that each time, it will become easier and easier for you to find your way out of these situations.

This morning, I was unhappy with where I found myself. And I was unhappy that I was unhappy\! But I knew that I would refuse to let this ruin my day, and I determined that I would find a way to come around to a new perspective. And that's why I know that, as terribly as my morning started, my day is going to be great\!

And the same can be true for you\!
