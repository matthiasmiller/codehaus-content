I have a confession to make. This probably won’t make me sound intellectual. In fact, it may make me sound a little ignorant, but...

I hated history in school.

I hated dates. I hated needing to learn so many names, places, wars, and events. None of it made much sense. I despised the rote memorization it took to learn it all.

I’ve realized, lately, why history was so hard for me: I never understood *why* I had to learn it, *why* it was important. It was just a class full of useless facts.

You see, I learn through patterns and ideas, through making connections and discovering reasons--not by memorizing a list of *facts*. If I want to remember something, I have to have *reason* to remember it. I have to know the “*why*” behind that name or war.

For example, if my wife tells me where to find something in the kitchen, I will invariably forget it unless I have a mental *“reason”* *why it’s there*. 

*“The paprika is in such-and-such cupboard because that’s where all the spices are. The spices are in that cupboard because it’s a convenient spot when you’re making food.”*

In history class, my teacher taught me facts alone, disjointed from the reasons, motives, and principles behind them. Naturally, I had a difficult time fitting it all into my context of learning. Whenever I was forced to simply memorize information without a “bucket” to put it into, I almost always failed.

For example, did you know President Jefferson was able to acquire the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 at a low price because the French dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte, desperately needed money to finance his wars against the British, fought from 1803 to 1815?

Often, these facts are presented through American history and European history separately. But when presented as a story, they stick much better in your memory because you understand the *reasons* and *motives* behind the facts.

Because I didn't receive this, I often felt out-of-place and incompetent in history class. However, I didn’t realize these weaknesses were the flip-side of my strengths:

1. While I struggle to memorize facts, I often hunt out the *principles* and *reason* behind them.  
2. While I struggle to understand the past, I’m always thinking about future.

I’ve spent years cultivating this ability to make connections, see patterns, and hunt down real reasons. I’ve found that whether it is history, business, or interpersonal relations, many people will simply give you *facts*. Few people will give you the *why* behind it all. 

By learning *patterns* and *principles*, you can learn how to make effective decisions much more easily. This is high-leverage decision-making.

Many of us spend too much time beating ourselves up for our natural weaknesses, rather than looking for ways to capitalize our inborn genius.

So what about you? What are the natural weaknesses you’ve obsessed over? More importantly, what are the natural strengths? How can you partner with others to shore up your natural weaknesses?

Shoot me an email, I’d love to know\!

In the meantime, always…

Be the best you\!

**Learning \- Facts vs Principles**

I realized lately that I learn based on patterns, ideas, connections and reasons.

My history teacher was teaching me based on facts, and I had a difficult time fitting that into my context of learning. Whenever I was forced to memorize information and I didn’t have a “bucket” to put it into, I almost always failed.

If my wife tells me where to find something, I will usually forget unless I have a mental “reason” why it’s there.

Many people will teach you facts, but few people will teach you reasons. Teaching the principles/reasons/connections will teach you HOW to think and how to problem solve.

When you start to see PATTERNS, you can learn how to more effectively make decisions much more easily. This is high-leverage decision-making.
