# **Chapter: Busting Plateaus**

As I sit down to write this chapter, I am faced with one of the most challenging parts of completing a project: breaking through the plateau.

You know what it's like. Maybe it's a New Year's resolution that you made. Maybe it's a big project that you've undertaken. Maybe it's a program that you enrolled in, or a class you started.

Once the initial excitement and energy has worn off, you feel like you keep pressing on with no visible signs of progress. All of the initial momentum has worn off, and it feels like you have nothing left except for a daily grind. You get up and do the same thing all over again.

To make matters worse, most times this happens before you begin seeing visible results. If you're lucky, you'll actually have something to show for your work. But sometimes, you have absolutely nothing until you push through the plateau.

Your challenge is not starting new ventures. Your challenge is finishing them. You know that some ventures are not worth completing, but some of them are. Some of your greatest works may be lying neglected in a drawer somewhere, simply because you lost the resolve to push through to the very end.

Every time you start a new project, you have a burst of energy. The end product is so real to you that you can almost touch it and feel it. You can imagine yourself with your successful business. You can imagine yourself placing in a marathon. You can imagine yourself being twenty pounds lighter and needing to go shopping for new clothes. You hear your friends complimenting you, "My, you look fantastic\!"

With that burst of energy and emotion, you sign up for your gym membership. You sign on to new classes. You start your new business. You pour your heart and soul into it, and you're faced with lots of new and exciting ideas. You're faced with exciting challenges. Every day, you've got something new confronting you.

But over time, your energy starts to wane. It's harder to get up in the morning. It's harder to hit your daily goals. It's easy to skip going to the gym every once in a while.

It's in this plateau that most great ideas die.

You convince yourself that because your idea is no longer new and exciting, it's not worth pursuing. This is the part of your journey where you're most susceptible to buying another program, signing up for another class, reading another book, starting another diet, or altogether canceling your gym membership.

You've managed to ride the roller coaster from, "This is completely possible\!" to "I could never actually accomplish this\!" And all of this happened in a matter of months.

The question I must face right now, and they question you must answer, is one and the same: "How do you push through the plateau to get to the next level?"

## **Plateaus Don't Have to Be Boring**

The reason most of us become disinterested during plateaus is simply because we reach a level of routine. It becomes normal to us. Because it's normal, we begin to disregard it as not being significant, and because we disregard it as insignificant, we don't put energy into making it happen.

Your dreams are going to take work. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Some mornings it will take all that you have to get up and do it again.

When that moment happens, you get to choose how you respond.

Motivation is not something that happens to you. Motivation is something that you choose and something that you cause. As long as motivation is something that happens to you, you will always be chasing from one thing after the other trying to find the motivation that you need to pull yourself through.

But if motivation is something that you can create, it is something that you can control. If you aren't motivated to do something, it's your own fault. You can't blame your circumstance, your boss, your friends, or your spouse. You're to blame.

If you're not motivated to do something, simply say, "I'm choosing not to do this." If you wanted to do it, you would find a way to motivate yourself.

You have to reframe your perspective of motivation, because until then, every plateau will completely kill what you have to offer. You will find yourself suffering because you cannot find the motivation to keep on going.

You have to stop and take responsibility for your own motivation. Nobody else is pushing you to achieve their dreams, and the cost of not being able to motivate yourself to pursue your own dreams is the cost of following someone else's.

If you choose to quit when you've hit a plateau, then quit. But please do yourself a favor and don't deceive yourself into thinking that you quit because you weren't motivated.

You quit because you decided to quit.

You can, of course, return to the same place you started from. Like it or not, you are a leader, and the most important person you must learn to lead is yourself.

No leader will take her people to the place they need to go without continually reiterating her vision. People need to be reminded of why they're doing what they're doing. They need to be reminded of the significance of their daily work.

The same is true for you. It is your responsibility as a leader to remind yourself of the significance of the work that you're doing every single day. If you find yourself losing motivation, go back to the very first day when you decided, "I'm going to do this\!"

You get to choose to return to the same place of wonder and excitement. You signed on because you wanted to leave a legacy. You wanted to see people's lives touched and the world changed.

In the middle of one more homework assignment, it's hard to see a student's life changed. It's hard to visualize someone's world completely transformed by your unique insight.

But the result will never happen without the process, and unless you completely value the process, you will never achieve your potential. To value the result but downplay the process is like visiting a restaurant and asking for a plate of food, but requesting that the cook be relieved from his duties. It's like going to a fast food restaurant and expecting the quality of a home cooked meal.

You cannot achieve the result without embracing the process. The result is where the novelty and intrigue appear, but the process is what makes it possible. Change your perspective. You are not merely drudging through the day. You are making continual, progressive steps toward your end result.

As long as you define that end goal, and as long as you continue taking steps toward it, you will experience the reward of attaining what you're reaching for.

## **Sustainable Action**

One of the most dangerous parts of taking on a new venture is relying on the burst of energy at the beginning to push us through to the end.

In his book *Good to Great*, Jim Collins discusses the concept of the 20-mile march. Basing his insights on a race to the South Pole, he describes two individuals.

The first individual determines that, on the first day, he will exert all of his effort and will go twice as far as he might. However, on the next day, he wakes up, completely exhausted and discouraged by his obstacles. Because he doubled his effort the day before, he chooses to take a day off. The following day, he decides again to take a day off, knowing that he will be able to make it up later. Some days he travels forty miles. Some days he travels ten. Some days he travels none at all.

Meanwhile, the second individual determines to a measurable amount of progress every single day. If the conditions are good, he quits early. If the conditions are terrible, he travels late into the night. Every day, he marches forward 20 miles.

What Jim Collins calls the 20 Mile March is a significant distinguishing factor between great companies and average ones. Great companies will protect themselves from overextending themselves in the good times, and they will protect themselves from giving up in the bad times.

It's uncomfortable, and it's difficult. But it keeps you accountable to your goal. You force yourself to keep moving forward, no matter what the conditions are.

If you're simply moving forward when the circumstances are right or when you feel like it, you are limiting yourself from your full potential. You're not in this life as a shooting star. You're in this to create sustainable action towards your goal.

When you use this method of pursuing your goals, it becomes not a race, but a simple lifestyle. You determine how you can reach your goals, and you determine the time that is required to do it. It gives you the freedom to quit at the end of the day and tell yourself, "I've done all that I need to do to." It gives you permission to stop and rest.

## **Addicted to Novelty**

We live in a world that is addicted to novelty. We have more information at our fingertips than any other time in history. Our exposure to creative ideas and inventions is broader than any other time in history. We are inundated with media and entertainment.

We live in a culture that is creating an addiction to novelty and intrigue, and we are unable to embrace greatness because we are so easily distracted from our true goal. We lose interest in the things we are trying to accomplish, simply because they are no longer new and exciting.

The distractions that surround us are more harmful than good. They encourage us to read short pithy thoughts rather than engaging deeply into ideas that matter.

This filters into how we read books--skimming them to find one or two items that are significant to us, rather than being willing to dig deeply into them and gain the full benefit of someone else's insights.

We live our life at a surface level, never being willing to mine deeply beneath the surface to find the things that lie hidden. We are willing to hurriedly run from one place to the next, never settling long enough to observe all the nuances that are around us.

The only way to break this distraction is by intentionally eliminating it from our lives. It means intentionally creating periods of time where we are not distracted. It means choosing to read certain things offline, where we don't get lost in the distractions of links and cross-references and videos and suggested content.

It means being able to live life without a fear of what you're missing out on. It means being able to focus on what you have directly in front of you, doing the things you know to do, and executing them consistently and relentlessly. It means living life with a singular, strong focus to do the things that matter, to silence the thousands of voices around you, and focus in on the few voices that matter the most.

Seeking for the next novel idea is like playing the lottery. It may allow you to uncover a magical insight, but it will train you to keep searching. It will teach you to discredit what you already know in a hungry search for more truth, more insight, and a silver bullet you'll never find.

If you're not consistently executing what you know to do right now, why are you looking for some great insight? Why are you waiting for a breakthrough if you're not willing to act on what you already know?

Get up, and march 20 miles today. Then get up and do it again tomorrow.

In a year, you will have marched over seven thousand miles.

But it starts today.
