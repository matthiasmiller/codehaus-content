As a leader, your time is your most precious resource. Because of this, your ability to get things done quickly and efficiently is a life-changing tool.

Yet, if you’re like me, when it comes right down to getting stuff done, distractions are always around the corner. Like a vicious dog, ready to pounce and shred your productivity just when you’re least expecting. This eats up your time, drains your mental energy, and creates more hurdles and frustrations for you to overcome every single day.

Being able to lock away your distractions becomes an an indispensable tool for any entrepreneur.

Of course, we already talked about this in last week’s email. This week, like I promised, we’re going to dive deeper and discover some valuable tips on how to effectively set aside time to intentionally focus on the important things.

So here we go.

As we’ve noted, important work is often the most difficult. Therefore, it’s EASY to get distracted doing anything other than the important task at hand.

That’s why, recently, I’ve been nurturing a habit of spending an hour a day to focus intentionally on those difficult but important tasks.

This can be both EXHAUSTING and EXHILARATING. Focusing intentionally on high-value work can help you “zone-in” and *get things done*. Unfortunately, it also takes a lot of mental and physical energy to do.

So how can we make the most of the exhilaration while minimizing the exhaustion?

**How to Focus Well**

***1\. Set a time frame that works for you.*** 

This is crucial to getting the most out of your focus time. If you’re in your office, set aside an hour for a specific task that is important to get done that day. Remember to drink water and use the restroom *ahead* of time, so you can stay at your desk the entire hour.

This is important because in order for this hour to work, you must NOT get up until the hour is over. So find a good time and be ready to stay put.

***2\. Turn off your Wi-Fi and completely silence your cell phone.***  
If you find yourself picking up your phone or checking your email, you’re going to slow down and start thinking about other things. This will kill your momentum. 

If you want this focus hour to actually work, take it seriously and turn off your Wi-Fi and your phone. Those emails and texts can wait.

***3\. Do it in the morning when your energy and creativity levels are the highest.*** 

This is when it’s easiest to concentrate. If you do more than an hour, do it early in the week when you’ve got the most mental energy after a restful weekend.

***4\. Don’t do it just because a task “needs to be done”.*** 

If you’re doing it simply because it “needs to be done”, it’s a clue that you may be working on the wrong thing. While it might be important, it’s probably not the \#1 priority. You may be better off delegating it.

***5\. Eliminate reactivity as much as possible.*** 

This world is wired to get you distracted. Getting a crystal-clear vision on *what* you need to do and maintaining realistic expectations of *when* it can happen is key to succeeding during your focus hour.

This hour is not set aside for replying to emails, answering phone calls, responding to texts, or running errands for stuff other people could get. There’s a time and place for that. That time is **not** during your focus hour. Make this hour about getting the important, high value stuff ***done***. 

(At times, your most important work may involve some email. However, do it with caution--it’s easy to get sucked into your inbox and sidetracked from what you’re working on. Usually, however, emailing could happen at a lower value time, such as at the end of the day or week.)

Your effectiveness as a leader depends on your ability to get important things done. Take the time to intentionally focus. Experiment on what works best for you. Then knock that high-value “to-do” list out of the park.

Do this and you’ll be well on your way to...

Being the best you\!

**Highly valuable, Intentional Focus**

**Value**

* Most of the “weight” of things that we have to do ends up coming from the mental space that it occupies, the nagging thought that “I need to do it”. Oftentimes, we should either delegate, or do it.  
* Also, it’s easy to let distractions rule your day instead of focusing on the core business-building activities. Unless you actively and intentionally focus on your high-value activity, it will take a back burner.

**How to do it well**

* Set a time frame that works well. If you’re in your office, set an hour. Drink water and use the restroom before, so that you can stay at your desk. Do NOT get up until the hour is up.  
* If necessary, turn off your wireless and completely silence your cell phone.  
* Do it in the morning when your energy level is the highest. This is when it’s easiest to concentrate. If it’s more than 1 hour, do it early in the week when you’ve got the most mental energy after the weekend.  
* Be careful doing this just because something “needs to be done”. You may be better off delegating instead.  
* This world is wired for distraction. Eliminate reactivity as much as possible. Getting crystal-clear on what needs to be done and a realistic expectation when it can happen is key.

**What I’ve learned**:

* The most important work is often difficult, and it’s EASY to get stuck rearranging your desk, taking out the trash, checking your email...anything to avoid the important task at hand.  
* Spending an hour doing this is both EXHAUSTING and EXHILARATING. If you’re really focused on high-value work, you should find yourself slipping into the zone, but you’ll also find yourself spending a lot of mental and even physical energy doing it.
