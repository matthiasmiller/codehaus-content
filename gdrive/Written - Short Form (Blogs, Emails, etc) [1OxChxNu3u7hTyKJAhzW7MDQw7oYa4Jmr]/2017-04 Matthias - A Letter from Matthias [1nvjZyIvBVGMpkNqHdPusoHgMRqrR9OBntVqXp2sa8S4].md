**TARGET: 175**

Nothing excites my son as much as getting a package in the mail. Even if he knows exactly what's in it, he eagerly rips off the tape to look inside. At three years old, his vivid imagination and wide-eyed wonder keep reminding me what it was like to be a child.

Just like him, we all have packages we can unwrap every day, and we can do it with the same wide-eyed wonder.

It might not mean watching the sunset on the beach. It might mean looking inside our team we know so well. It might not mean listening to the strains of a beautiful orchestra. It might mean embracing the wonder of unpacking today's agenda...even if we know what's coming\!

Science has proven that playfulness and fear cannot coexist. Leaders understand, more than most people, the consequences of their decisions and actions. Yet it seems we often become fearful when we take ourselves too seriously and lose touch of the wonder.

Just like my three-year-old son, let's choose each day to rip off the tape, look inside, and embrace the wonder of every day.
