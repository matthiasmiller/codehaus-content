# **Unstoppable Force**

## Why Motivational and Productivity Tools Aren’t Helping You Move Forward, and How You Can Get Unstuck

On August 6, 2014, I enrolled in my first high ticket coaching program. I had spent most of my life in a 9-5 job that I was *quite skilled at* but that I *hated.*

It became so challenging that one day, my boss threw up his hands and shook his head.  He told me, “You’re one of those creative types who are simply moody.”

Trouble was, I didn’t know how to fix it or manage it.

In fact, for almost as long as I could remember, I had struggled with motivation. I knew the tactical principles of business, but I couldn’t bring myself to execute. Nobody that I spoke with seemed to be able to get to the root of the issue.

In fact, my first formal business coach got frustrated at me. Despite my best effort at the time, something inside of me was dying. I became another statistic, along with the dozens (maybe hundreds) of other students who failed to achieve the program’s promises.

This sent me on a multi-year search to find the answer to this question:

“What does it take to become an unstoppable force?”

When I asked that question, I started with the first thing I knew.

## Skills

Just a year earlier, I enrolled in a Christian Coaching institute. I wanted to develop additional skills, and the coaching industry caught my attention. It didn’t take long to realize that unless I could market myself, I’d always struggle.

This started an extensive dive down the world of marketing, persuasion, and communication. As you’re reading this article, you’re enjoying the benefits of the skills I developed in that season of life.

Something was still wrong. I felt like Paul’s words, “For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.”

I knew what I SHOULD do. I had trouble executing on it. I kept getting in my own way, starting new things, and losing my focus.

Fortunately, one of my mentors introduced me to an aspect of me that I’d never been aware of before.

## Conation

I discovered that each person has a **very specific pattern** of taking action. For example, I have an unusually high risk tolerance. I also have a bent towards starting things with very little instinctive behavior to wrap them up.

This opened my eyes up to the power of a team.

My first hire was quite similar to myself. We had a lot of fun (even wrote a book together\!). We failed to stay on a sustainable path.

On my second try, I struck gold. My new assistant was strong where I was weak. She helped cover many of the administrative pieces so that I could continue building out the business.

As the business started to develop, I made some adjustments to my daily role. My performance went from mediocre to okay.

I still struggled. It still wasn’t good enough.

That’s when I unlocked a third level.

## Motivation

Every entrepreneur loses interest in their work from time to time. My problem was much bigger than that.

This wasn’t merely being distracted. I still had a low grade frustration with what I was doing. I wanted to be able to go *all in* on my business, and I wasn’t sure how.

Most of my friends could point to something very specific and say, “*THIS* is something I’m interested in.”

I couldn’t do that.

Instead, it seemed I had a variety of interests in a lot of different directions. I tried to eliminate distraction, narrow my focus, and find fulfillment by:

* hiring business consultants  
* hiring personal advisors  
* enrolling in more business coaching programs  
* listening carefully to my friends

With time, I finally began to understand what drove me at my core. As I continued to unpack this, I took my lessons and reassembled it into an article entitled “Lead Like a CEO”.

It proved to be a rock solid success.

And yet...

Something was still missing.

## Spiritual Environment

For as long as I can remember, I’ve been hyper-sensitive to environments around me. Even as a child, I could pick up on someone’s sadness without them saying a word. I knew when someone was frustrated or upset at me, no matter how much they tried to mask it. People’s emotions often shouted at me.

Despite that, I never learned to deal well with negative emotions. You can imagine what I wrestled with as a child.

I had deep feelings of emptiness, confusion, and even depression. I wanted to be emotionally in tune with others. But I had not developed strong skill sets in bonding, attachments, and relationships

It was a lonely place, and I couldn’t make sense of it.

I turned to the only source I knew to turn--GOD.

That decision took me on a journey I could never have predicted.

That journey has looked a lot like the stories I read in Scripture. Joseph got sold into slavery by his brothers (although my brothers were kinder). Abraham packed up and left his hometown to follow God. And me?

I did whatever I could to give Him a little freaked-out “yes” to His adventure.

It’s come at a price.

It’s cost me personally, including both financially and emotionally. 

It’s taught me a few things, as well.

I learned about the power behind my sensitivity. It took me quite some time to realize two things about it.

1. This was a GIFT  
2. This was INFORMATION, not DIRECTION

I envied people with less sensitivity. They could pursue goals, execute, and win and not be encumbered by what other people thought.

That’s when I realized that they *do* have a challenge. Disregarding people brings short-term success. However, it compromises long-term success when they can’t tune into what could spell disaster.

The danger, though, is that it's easy to rely on this sensitivity for direction. If you know your team member is having a bad day, you might instinctively wait to ask a favor until tomorrow. It *might* be appropriate to do so, or it *might* be the opportunity to serve is the answer to their bad day.

This is where formulas begin to break down.

We all face problems. We can all identify problems. What we desperately need are solutions.

From the very beginning, I have made a commitment to making prayer central to my business. This means partnering with what God wants to do in practical ways.

When someone is having a bad day, sometimes only God knows what the solution is.

Ask Him.

He is the one who sets the course. His is the vision I'm bent on following. The only way to find what that is?

Ask. Seek. Knock.

If you're a person of faith, this is simple to grasp and apply. It's not always easy, but it's simple.

It’s impossible to do this topic justice in such a short space, you’ll get an incredible amount of clarity if you hang with me.

## The High Performance Pyramid

When we put these pieces together, you find a pyramid of:

1. Skill  
2. Conation  
3. Motivation  
4. Spiritual Environment

I have dug deeply into each of these areas (going so far as getting specific certifications). The personal and professional development world focuses primarily on skill and motivation. Almost no one talks about **conation** and **spiritual environment**.

Because I don’t have room to go into each of these, the rest of this article will be focused on the habits of your **spiritual environment**. This has been a cornerstone for my success.

## What You Let Go Matters More Than What You Gain

Almost all religions are founded on man trying to reach God. Many people live their spiritual lives with a goal to attain.

The gospel is backwards from that. It is God reaching down to man. In Christ, you’ve been given everything you need. The only thing that’s required is your willingness to engage with Him in the process.

This means that there are two things you need:

1. Let go of the things holding you back  
2. Keep growing by walking out what He’s given you

That’s it.

Letting go is one of the fastest ways to go forward. There are three ways I’ve seen this play out.

**Absence is a presence.** When I first realized this, I’d been struggling with a sense of being disconnected from God. I knew this wasn’t the basis of my faith, but I also knew something wasn’t right. I couldn’t figure out what was going on.

I broke down some of my reasoning:

1. If God is always present, the lack of presence is a lie.  
2. If it’s a lie, it’s from the father of lies. This must be the enemy, not God.  
3. Thus, there is no lack of presence. If God feels absent, it’s an invitation to turn my attention back to Him.

It is easy for us to detect hot water. We can recognize cold water. It’s much more difficult to detect lukewarm water. Just as the church of Laodicea succumbed to lukewarmness, one of the enemy’s strongest tactics against us is not **torment** but **numbness**.

I stopped trying to attain His presence, and I started living from His presence. Whenever I felt disconnected from God (and I had done nothing to break fellowship with Him), I dealt with it as if it were an enemy. And I started consistently breaking through into His presence.

This realization only came about because of an even broader understanding.

**Lies are bondage. Truth is freedom**. The bondage we live in doesn’t come from our experiences. It comes from the beliefs and conclusions that we have about our experiences.

I intentionally watched my behaviors, beliefs, and unwanted patterns.. I looked for the belief behind them and where that belief started. I began confronting them with the truth.

Many times, it was as simple as letting go of the lie that I had believed. This allowed the truth to permeate my heart and mind. When you let go of falsehood, the truth moves in.

This has led to a lifestyle of ever-increasing freedom.

**Forgiveness is freedom**. Sometimes, these lies were tied to things that people did against me. Remember the first high ticket coaching program I enrolled in? It didn’t work out.

In fact, it was an utter disaster. I tried my best. Their efforts to make things right and help me succeed just led me back to the same place.

And I knew I wasn’t an anomaly. Their alumni group was filled with disillusioned people who were still stuck.

For years, I fought the fear of putting others through the same nightmare I went through. That fear kept me locked up in analysis paralysis. One day, I made an intentional decision to forgive the owner, the salespeople, and the coaches. Within a matter of days, I found myself walking in a newfound freedom to keep moving forward.

**And more**. These are just three ways that letting go has helped me to move forward. If we looked at your life, I’m certain you could provide more examples of this.

Through this, one thing became clear to me. Every morning when I woke up, I had one responsibility.

## Stay in Peace

The deeper I went into a life of prayer, the more I recognized the power of the staying presence of Jesus. His presence always brought with Him righteousness, peace, and joy. I began to pay close attention to this, both within me and around me.

I’d been around the block enough to know the power of establishing a vision document. I’ve had numerous forms of this over the years. Yet, more often than not, these seemed incomplete and incongruent. At times, they even felt disingenuous.

I began to recognize a pattern.

When I woke up every morning with the express purpose and goal of getting into the presence of Christ, my whole day began to shift.

If I wasn’t in that space, I asked God what was on His heart. If He wanted me to deal with an enemy, I dealt with that. If He laid a friend or client on my heart to intercede for, I would do that. If He laid my wife or children on my heart, I would pray until I found that release. I would press in until I felt the release of His Spirit.

Almost immediately, my days started going better. I didn’t struggle doing the right thing. This habit motivated me to pursue what needed to be pursued.

This was the keystone that everything else rested upon. If I pulled back on this, no other success habit could sustain my momentum.

I realized that my Father had played a chess move. He had hardwired me to need his fellowship and connection to make it through the day. He’d made it a lifeline for my motivation.

**GOLDEN INSIGHT**: Productivity experts will encourage you to close your day with gratitude and wins (which is a great suggestion\!). I’ve been building habits to take it one step further. Close out your day with truth and joy. Read Scripture. Have a good laugh. Your mind and body will thank you when you wake up in the morning\!

And something interesting started to happen throughout my day.

## Hear His Voice

For years, I recognized that God gave me ideas, insight, and instruction for my business. But the more intentional I was about pursuing the presence of Christ, the easier it became for me to identify these.

At times, my team members would press me to address a specific problem immediately. I had this instinct that it wasn’t the time. I would put it on the back burner, then I would address it when the time was right. Time and again, I watched all the pieces come together at the perfect time.

One morning, He woke me up with a very specific instruction to fire a team member. It was a simple, loud thought ringing through my head as I woke up. I was taken aback, but I began the process. I walked through all the necessary steps, doing the due diligence required.

Looking back, it’s a move that probably saved the business.

I’ve watched this concept also impact my team members. Earlier this year, a business partner woke up with the full details and plans in his head for a project management report for our software projects. This has turned out to be a lifesaver for our projects, and it’s allowed us to bolster our development process. It was easily a $10,000 idea.

I’ve watched it happen in small ways. One afternoon, I was working on a project. One of my team members was out of the office, but was available for questions. I called them with a question, catching them in a 5-minute window of a very busy day for them.

To be fair, not every day is this dramatic. Business life is full of a LOT of regular old business matters. Solving one problem after the other.

But every day, I see His hand at work in me, my team, and my business. It’s not always big. It’s not always dramatic. But it’s always there.

And this has taken me to the next step.

## Execute His Vision

The most foundational shift for me has been to come into alignment with His unique purposes for me. This article itself is part of that purpose.

For years, I’ve struggled with setting goals. I’ve struggled to stay on track. I’ve struggled to stay motivated.

I’ve shifted my question from, “What do I want?” I’ve changed it to a prayer, “What do You want?” I’ve been shifting my focus from building my business to stewarding His vision.

This is NOT a matter of getting some sense of direction, then trying to achieve it by myself. This is also NOT a matter of winging it. It includes very practical management tools.

It’s a matter of getting FIRST THINGS FIRST, making sure you have the right foundation, then building on that. It’s a matter of walking in fellowship with Christ in every part of life.

Getting onto God’s agenda takes time. None of us got where we were in a moment. None of us will get to where we need to in an instant. For me, this was a process that happened over months, even years. I continuously calibrated myself with where God wanted me to be.

When I realized this shift, I began to understand the reason I struggled to set goals. I’ve got an **unusually high need** to believe in what I’m doing. Nothing I created had a big enough believability factor to win my buy-in.

It’s not that I’m averse to setting goals. However, the only thing powerful enough for me is a daily reminder from the God of the universe that I’m on track with what He’s put me on the earth to do.

**GOLDEN INSIGHT**: Some people have taken the idea that God actively speaks to us today, and they’ve used it for selfish, personal agendas without love, humility, and teachability. However, their choices do not exclude us from our own journey of faith and obedience that we see modeled by our heroes in Scripture. Each of us must decide for ourselves to follow Christ with a loving, humble, and teachable spirit, grounded in the truth of God’s Word.

The more that I started seeking out God’s vision, the more I started experiencing a flip-flop of ownership. Rather than looking for a vision I could own, I found that His vision started to own me.

## Do You Have Your Vision, or Does Your Vision Have You?

Something began to change.

Previously I'd struggled to find motivation. I had to find ways to reconnect with the vision. I began to experience something new. 

Rather than me possessing the vision, the vision started to possess me.

In some ways, it was as if I was a pawn in the vision’s hands. And yet, I didn’t feel manipulated or used.

Unlike my experiences in the professional world, I didn’t mind being possessed by this vision. I didn’t feel mistreated, misused, or abused. I felt empowered. The vision was pushing me and driving me forward.

It’s been a game-changer for me.

With that, you might be asking, “What does it take for me to live the same way?”

## Practical Steps

It’d be a lie to say that this journey of development was easy, simple, or inexpensive. I paid a big price to be able to walk this journey. While it’s far from over, I’ve given you a snapshot of where I’ve come today.

There were three important lessons for me:

1. ALL of these areas need to be in alignment for maximum performance. Most people are lucky to have more than one dialed in. It’s the reason why a lot of spiritual people struggle in other areas of life, such as their finances. Sometimes affluent individuals struggle in the spiritual and relational parts of their life. These alignments don’t always happen in a single order. Sometimes, you must fix the top of the pyramid to sustain you while you establish the solid foundation at the bottom of the pyramid.

2. This is not something to be done alone. God created us for community and connection. I learned from personal mentorship of mature experts, which accelerated my process.

3. Each person’s process is different, because of their DNA, their journey, and their destination. This framework is a starting point, not the endpoint.

Building this foundation requires more than tweaks. It requires intentional, consistent calibration. It happens over weeks, months, and even years.

As I’ve embarked on this journey, I’ve begun taking others along with me.

I’ve piloted our first paying coaching clients through this process. I’ve done this unofficially with quite a few people outside of that engagement. The growth they’ve experienced is nothing short of extraordinary.

I know of no one who’s gone this deep into this aspect of high performance, bridging the gap between faith and business in this particular area.

I’ve written this article to give you practical, actionable advice. While I encourage you to take it and run with it, I also have to be completely honest with you.

I’ve yet to find someone who’s successfully made this journey alone.

I want to extend an invitation to allow my colleague Jason and I to have a conversation with you. We can discuss where you’re at, where you want to be, and who should be your travel mates on this journey. We’ll be looking not only at the **spiritual environment** but also at each of the other components that make up the **Unstoppable Force**.

If you’d be best served working with us, we’ll tell you. If not, we’ll give you clear next steps.
