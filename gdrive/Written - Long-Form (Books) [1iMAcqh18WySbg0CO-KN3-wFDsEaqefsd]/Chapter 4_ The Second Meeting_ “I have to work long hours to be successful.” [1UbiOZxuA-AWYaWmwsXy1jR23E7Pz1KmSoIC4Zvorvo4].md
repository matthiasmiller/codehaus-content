**Chapter 4: The Second Meeting**  
***“I have to work long hours to be successful”***

“JACK, YOU have to start working fewer hours.” 

Jack’s old friend started week two of their new routine with the bombshell statement.

“Work fewer hours?\!” Jack retorted. “I think all this analytical stuff has gone to your head, sir.”

They both chuckled.

“Naw, I’m serious Jack\! You need to shed this mindset of ‘Work hard, work long; take no time off.’”

“But that’s business\! It’s hard work. It takes long hours,” the younger man rejoined, more confident than he really was.

The old man looked him square in the eye for a moment before asking: “How’s that workin’ for ya?”

The question hung in the air, unanswered. Jack couldn’t respond. Truth was, it wasn’t working out for him--not in the way he had hopped.

“But…” he stammered. “But...there’s more than that, to my problems. That’s not what’s holding me back.” He paused before adding: “Is it?”

“It’s a big part, Jack--being addicted to work. It’s not everything. But it is definitely a big part of it,” he repeated.

Jack gazed out the window and across the street where the proprietor of a flower shop was just opening his doors. 

Although he became more comfortable each week with the idea of sharing his struggles to his mentor, it still made him nervous. Exposing the embarrassing weaknesses and frustrations long ago relegated to the dark alleyways of his soul wasn’t exactly his favorite past-time. He didn’t like admitting ignorance to anything, let alone business. He had been trained in mechanics *and* business. He thought he already knew all there was to know about running his shop. Apparently not. 

And now, his mentor was trying to throw away one of mankind's best understood principles.

“How could hard work and long hours stunt the growth of my business? That doesn’t make any sense.”

“Oh, hard work is good. The issue is using your time efficiently. Let me ask you this: Who processes the bills at your shop?”

“I do,” Jack replied.

“Is that what you envisioned doing when you opened a mechanic shop: Processing bills?”

“No, of course--”

“Why did you open your mechanic shop, Jack?”

“To work on cars...to do what I love, what I’m good at\!” Jack answered. These felt like simpleton questions, which annoyed him.

“Do you love processing your bills? Do you love running payroll? Do you love running to AutoZone for small, forgotten parts?”

“Of course not, but it’s a necess--”

“Then why are you still spending long hours processing all that paperwork, Jack?”

Jack furrowed his brow and pursed his lips. Silent, but pondering, trying to figure the old man out.

Folding his weathered hands and resting them on his stomach, the old man nestled back into his chair: It was story time.

“This morning, I want to tell you the story of Kip, because he struggled with this exact same problem,” the mentor explained. “He dreamt of running his own successful restaurant ever since he was a kid. You’ve seen him, observed him relate to the rest of us. How would you describe him?”

Jack thought for a moment before responding.

“Full of energy and grit--a hard worker,” he finally said. “Perhaps a bit raw in his approach to relationships--though he strikes me as incredibly tender-hearted.”

“That’s good. You observe well,” the older man complimented. “I know few men who have worked harder than Kip during their careers. Unfortunately, that drivenness--grit as you said--and raw way of relating is what tore his family apart.”

“Oh?” Jack raised his brow. “I didn’t realize he had family.”

“Not many do. His work ethic destroyed it.”

Jack straightened, interested to know the story now. 

“By nature, the man doesn’t know how to stop. He’s a workaholic--or he used to be, rather. He learned the hard way success isn’t all about money.

“He’s originally from New Zealand, you know.”

“I could tell by the accent.”

“Kip came to Colorado during the ‘60s, trying to get away from the pill-popping, surf-riding hippie crowd his brother and sister had fallen in with. They sought meaning through drugs and pleasure. Kip looked for it in money and success.

“He determined to make something of himself and follow his dreams. That was his life. That’s what defined him.

“I met him in ‘74,  in one of his restaurants. At the time, it was his only establishment.

“I was barely out of college and ready to take on the world. There I was, eating a delicious steak at this new place in the river city. Suddenly, through the kitchen doors bounded this young, well-built, fire-ball of a man who appeared to be in his upper twenties. He was 28, to be exact.

“The guy shot like lightning through the room and never stopped.

“‘Hey you, do this,’ he would tell an employee. ‘Don’t forget this,’ he told another. ‘Waitress, you’ll have to cover these guests.’ ‘Busboy, can you clean those tables, please?’ 

“I wanted to meet this alien force of a man. So, at one point in the evening when he landed for air, I invaded his sphere and introduced myself.

“All I managed to get out of him was one run on sentence. ‘Name’s Kip, sir. Very nice to meet you; hope you enjoyed yourself--come again\!--sorry, can’t chat: lots to do when running a new business, ya know.’ Next thing I knew, he had scurried off to continue his managing. I thought right then and there if this man doesn’t stop for a breath, he’s going to very quickly self-destruct.

“Anyways, so every time on my way through, I stopped in at *Kip’s* for a nice juicy steak and a chance to catch the fire-ball and talk to him. It didn’t take long at all to realize Kip lived by the dangerous idea that in order to make his restaurant a success, he had to work long, dreadful hours.

“I remember, one night--after a few months of getting to know each other pretty well, I caught him closing up shack all by himself.

“‘What’re your plans for the rest of the evening, Kip?’ I asked. “Do you enjoy bowling? I think there’s an alley not too far from here.”

“‘Ah, there is--up three blocks. I suppose I’d enjoy it, I just never have the time,” he responded. He barely even looked up from his paperwork--bills and such, by the look of it.

“‘Gotta sweep this floor--it’s a mess--after I’ve finished-up this paperwork. Then I got some other random bitties to do yet before I go home to the missus.’

“I nearly fell over from shock right in front of him. Not only at the fact that the proprietor of the restaurant was sweeping the floor by himself, but he also had a wife waiting for him at home\! 

“‘Sounds incredibly busy, man,’ I told him.”

“‘It’s all part of being an entrepreneur, bro,’ he replied.

“Like I said, Kip was incredibly driven. He loved serving people, loved crafting delicious food, and loved making money doing it. The food service industry fitted him perfectly. But just like you now, he carried this dangerous mindset of ‘My business won’t succeed unless I work long hours.’”

“But isn’t that just reality,” Jack inserted. “Isn’t that part of the toll of being an entrepreneur?”

“You’re right,” the old man surprised Jack by agreeing with him. “It is part of the toll. It’s hard work to get a business off the ground. It often demands long hours from you. But driving yourself--and the people around you--nutty by working crazy hours doesn’t guarantee success. Like I’ve been saying, it’s usually the quickest route to disaster.”

He let Jack ponder the thought.

“Let me give you an example from Kip’s life.

“The longer I got to know him the more my suspicions were confirmed: This man was drunk on work and in perilous danger of a bad crash. In fact, he told me once he didn’t feel satisfied with himself unless he put in at least sixty hours a week at the restaurant. He was measuring his success by how many hours of work he put in\!” The old man slapped his hands on the table in exclamation before continuing. “About two years into the venture, Kip hit a major plateau--much like where you’re at today. He had worked hard and was very tired, but the business had survived.

“His most discouraging moment came after working eight days in a row. Understandably, his wife was not excited about these work hours and was trying to get his attention. This particular night, despite his exhaustion, they argued long past midnight.

“I remember his call clearly:

“‘She wants a divorce, Cal,’ he told me. ‘Says she’s done with living alone. Says I can’t be married to her and the restaurant. She just doesn’t understand.’”

“And what did you say?” interrupted Jack.

“I didn’t know what to say. At this point, I had known him for less than a year. I knew he was running a destructive lifestyle, but didn’t know it had come to this.

“‘Kip,’ I said, ‘Take a few days off--the restaurant will be fine. Give her some space, but take time to talk with her, to hear her out. Try to listen, Kip. I’ll be up the day after tomorrow and I’m bringing Carl with me, okay? We’re here for you, man.’

“So we did. We had no clue what to tell him, but we knew he had to change his lifestyle, especially if he wanted to save his marriage, but even if he wanted to save his business.

“He kept telling us starting a business was so hard and grueling but he loved it. It was what kept him going. ‘The hardest part,’ he told us, was his personal life. He said the people closest to him had become the least supportive, especially his wife. He claimed they had been fighting every day.” 

The old man’s eyes began to fill with tears as he retold his friend’s story.

“Then he asked a question which confirmed all my fears about his mindset. ‘How can I survive without my work? My career?’” 

The old man paused and shook his head.

“‘How can I survive without my work,’ Jack, that’s what he said to us. He wasn’t asking ‘How can I survive without my wife? How can I survive without sleep? How can I survive with this crazy, unsustainable schedule? He valued his work not only more than his wife--the woman he once loved more than anything else, the person who was supposed to be his *partner* in life--but valued it even above his own health well-being\!”

“We listened, we questioned, we tried to understand his situation. This struggle was obviously tearing him apart. Not only was he lacking the support only those closest can give, but he was experiencing rejection, in place of it. And all of it was only driving him to work *harder*.

“Carl finally worked up the courage to confront the real issue head on. I was too worried about hurting Kip’s feelings, but we both agreed: The guy’s work ethic was destroying his family and possibly his career.

“‘Kip, you’ve got to slow down,’ Carl insisted. ‘You’re destroying yourself.’ 

“I still remember Kip’s confused look as he tried to process what Carl was saying.

“‘But my business needs me. I can’t afford to slow down\!’ he said.

“‘You ‘can’t afford’ this plateau you’re in, either. You ‘can’t afford’ to lose your soulmate. You ‘can’t afford’ to micromanage your employees.

“‘You can’t afford not to slow down. Most of this stuff you're doing, isn’t worth your time.’

“‘Well, someone has to do it\!’ he threw back.” 

Jack’s mentor paused, before saying, with a wink, “Sounds familiar.”

The younger man grimaced and rolled his eyes.

The old man continued his story.

“We agreed with Kip that someone had to do it. ‘But it shouldn’t be you,’ Carl said. ‘You’re the leader. You are the vision and soul of the restaurant. You spearhead the way; you set the course; you call the shots.’ Then we asked him what we ask everyone business owner: Why did start the restaurant to begin with.

“‘Because I love making delicious food and making people happy,’ he replied. And getting paid to do it wasn’t too bad, either, of course.

“Carl told him he should be spending most of his time on just that: Creating delicious meals, delighting customers with a quality experience, and finding new and better ways to do it.

“That’s when I piped in,” the old man explained. “I told Kip, ‘Your job is to move the business forward and upward. That’s where your time is most profitable. Don’t throw it away on minimum wage chores.’

“I could see the lightbulb beginning to flicker.”

“‘And you must take care of your allies: your wife and those closest to you. They’re your lifesavers. If you create an incredible business, but destroy your family by your crazy hours and lifestyle, you haven’t succeeded at anything.’”

“Kip pondered it all for a long moment. I could sense the internal battle raging inside him. Everything he lived for, everything that gave him a will and drive to live was wrapped up in his business.

The old man looked at Jack. 

“You can you relate, can’t ya?” he stated.

“It sounds a lot like me, actually,” Jack admitted despite his pride.

Silence enveloped the narrative and they sat quietly for a moment. Jack tried to process everything the old man had just told him.

“It just doesn’t sound right,” he finally said. “*‘Work fewer hours, get more done.’”*

“Goes against everything you thought you knew, doesn’t it?” the old man agreed.

“There’s a rule, for this,” Jack’s mentor continued, “I think they call it the eighty-twenty rule these days, or something like that. Perhaps you’ve heard of it? This rule tells us all kinds of things we need to know about life and business. But the issue at hand is *time*. What do you spend your time doing?” he asked.

“How do you mean?” Jack asked.

“In any way. All day, every day what do you do?”

“I mean--I wake up, eat breakfast, and try to be at work at least by six o’clock every morning, if not sooner. We open the garage at eight, so I have plenty of time to work on paperwork or any vehicles before customers start arriving.”

“How much time do you spend on paperwork?”

“Couple hours a day in total maybe.”

“And, is that why you opened a mechanic shop?”

“No, of course it’s not.”

“Is it important for *you* to do all the paperwork or can anybody do paperwork?”

“I guess just about anyone…” Jack consented.

“Good. Anyways, continue explaining your routine. Do you ever do errands, like running for tools or parts--that kind of thing?”

“Often throughout the day or on my home from work, yeah, I’ll pick something up.”

“When customers drive into *‘Jack’s* Auto Repair,’ who do you think they expect to meet?” the old man questioned.

“Well, me--”

“JACK\!” his mentor interrupted. “They expect to meet Jack. But are they going to meet Jack if he’s off running to AutoZone for another carton of oil?”

“We--we buy it in bulk,” Jack corrected. 

The old man waved it off with a chuckle, “Whatever you get at AutoZone then. Doesn’t matter. What does matter is that your customers meet Jack at ‘Jack’s Auto Repair.’ It’s important they find the trustworthy guy running the place and have confidence he’s the one working or at least watching over those working on their car. It doesn’t matter who runs after errands, does it?”

“Well, sometimes we have to find particularly unique parts.”

“But that's not hard. You can train the other guys to do that pretty well, can’t you?

He didn’t wait for an answer, but continued on, “Here’s the thing, Jack. Spend your precious time working on stuff that drives your business forward: Interact with the customers to build trust. Work on their cars and do a good job so they keep coming back. Find ways to get them talking about your shop in better light than the next guy’s shop. Train the other employees to be five-star mechanics. And stop messing around doing odd jobs any of your men could do. Hire a secretary, assign one of the guys to be an errand-boy--do stuff to lighten your load.

“Is this making sense, son? The idea is to make a lifelong habit of letting go of the ‘low value’ things. Focus on doing things only you can do to drive the business forward. Leave the rest for your employees. That’s why you hired them. Kip learned most of the stuff he was working long hours to get done could have been done by someone else. So why put in ridiculous hours when you could be spending more time with your wife and kids and spending time doing stuff that actually grows your business?”

The old man leaned in as he finished up his little speech.

Jack rotated a leftover piece of toast from breakfast and sat in silence. The old man waited patiently for him to process everything. 

“So that’s how Kip learned to work only three days a week?” he asked the old man.

“Yup, by doing the stuff only he could do and having others do the rest.”

Jack watched a couple of sparrows swoop in to pick up the crumbs scattered by the men that morning. The eight o’clock sun penetrated the previously shadowy atmosphere and began to warm them as they sat silent.

*“Slow down, work fewer hours, maximize whatever makes you most productive…”* 

This was a hard turn for Jack to make. Everything he thought he had learned from years of running his own business--let alone the training he had gotten in college--was wrong, it turned out.

He looked up at his old mentor: Did this man know what he was talking about? Or were these just mere opinions he was reading into his experience?

“What happened then?” he asked the old man.

“To what?” the man grunted in reply.

“To Kip. Did he change?”

“Kip?” he said perking up. “It was hard. He didn’t change overnight. He was addicted to his work, you know. Most people can’t kick their addictions overnight. But eventually, he changed. And it probably saved his life and his business. Unfortunately, it was too late to save his marriage. She was hurt, angry, and fed up, so she packed her bags and left.”

“Is she still around?”

“They maintained a civil relationship--for the sake of the kids, mostly. But she remarried and seems to have had a happy life until she passed away about ten years ago.”

“Did Kip ever remarry?”

“Nope. No, he loved only Olivia, deep in his heart. He just didn’t realize it until it was too late. He had been too busy to realize she no longer loved him.”

JACK THOUGHT of Kip and Olivia the entire ride home and the entire way through the house and into his room.

The *“do the things only you can do; hire others to do the rest,”* part made sense to him.

But Kips words haunted him, *‘How can I survive without my work?’*

*“How do I survive*?” Jack wondered.

He had spent so many years believing he would be a failure if he didn’t make his business profitable. He couldn’t imagine thinking any other way. As small as it was, mechanics was his life.

But what did the old man know? He wasn’t a businessman. What gave him the right to make such strong assertions about how Jack should run his business.

It was late afternoon now. Jack began his evening jog by walking vigorously down the driveway from his house. Getting outside and exercising always cleared his mind.

He hurried his pace and broke into a jog. His heart fluttered a little as he caught sight of Riley walking up to the house from working in the garden. He always thought she was especially cute in work clothes.

Saving his family was a no-brainer. Of course he wanted that. Only an idiot would decisively choose to hurt his family.

But would working long hours to build a successful business really tear them apart?

*“Stop running errands to AutoZone. Instead, do the stuff only you can do to drive your business forward.”*

*“Let go of doing ‘low-value’ activities yourself. This will free your time, and more importantly, free your focus from needing to remember all the little details.”*

Jack broke into a run down the street, eyes narrowed in on the path in front of him. He didn’t even notice the new neighbor waving from his riding lawn mower. He didn’t notice his own kids playing with the Garcia children across the street. He was completely lost in thought.

“HELLO\! ANYBODY home?” Riley asked her husband, now sitting on the porch stairs.

“I’m sorry. What did you say?” Jack said, emerging from his thoughts.

“What were you thinking about?”

“Oh, just my conversation with Cal,” he wiped the sweat off his brow. “What did you want?”

“I was wondering if, at some point, you could help me in the garden. I need that old fence stake pulled out.” his wife repeated.

“Oh.” Jack thought for a moment. “I mean, yeah, I guess I can do that. I don’t know when, but I can help you out.” 

He knew it wasn’t the right answer. But he didn’t feel up to a cheerful *“Yes\! I’d be happy to.”* He had plenty on his mind already. This silly fence stake surely wasn’t more important than any of the other tasks calling his name.

“Well, if you don’t have time to help me, don’t worry about it.” She stood, obviously hurt, and walked into the house.

The roar of a mower and the sound of his children playing with the neighbor kids wafted across the yard. It was a peaceful late summer evening outside.

But inside Jack Martin a different sound filled the air, like the cries a diseased city on fire rather than a peaceful summer’s eve. Jack clenched his fist shut, as if to grasp an invisible foe.

*“YET ANOTHER FAILURE\!”* the thoughts screamed. *“Oh, she hates you even more, now.”*

*“She doesn’t understand what I’m going through,”* he thought to himself. *“She doesn’t understand the pressure.”*

The faint gurgle of boiling water came from the silent kitchen. 

“Riley\!” he called out. “Something’s on the stove\!”

No answer.

His mentor’s words rang in his ear, *“How much is your family worth it to you?”*

He knew he was acting in the wrong. He knew Cal was right. He knew he should apologize. Again. But humble pie is especially hard to swallow twice.

In the long run, she was more important than his business and most certainly more important than his pride. In the long run.

But not at the moment.
