Here you go\!

Read the whole thing. Attached are my thoughts on the book. It was solid. I think a lot of people in the business community and people who embark on a entrepreneurial path will easily relate to everything inside. I enjoyed the story telling too. Very well written.

Anyways, see attached doc for further thoughts and answers.

Good luck with everything\!

Thanks,

What were your two favorite chapters? 

Chapter 1 \>\>\>   
I liked the descriptions and thoughts of the internal friction going on with Jack. Always good to hear about someone’s dreams, feelings, frustrations, etc. 

Chapter 4 \>\>\>  
Because it described the notion that we need to work long hours to be successful. Debunking myths. Great chapter on being more efficient. I loved that story with Kip. Learning how to slow down, work fewer hours, and maximize the hours you do have to be the most productive. Really good lessons here.

Chapter 6 \>\>\>

Also enjoyed this one.

What were your two least favorite chapters? 

Chapter 3 \>\>\>

A little long winded but still good.

Chapter 5 \>\>\>

Didn’t necessarily like the beginning of it with the young teacher. A little random or out of place. But I see how it tied back with Trev. Good little lessons there about energy management and what to do to eliminate tiredess.

Was there any place where you got lost or confused? 

Nope. Great flow throughout the book.

Would you recommend it to a friend? Why or why not? 

Yes, especially my friends that are leaders, entrepreneurs, business people, or just workaholics in general. I think they could relate to the story and the amount of pressure they put on themselves as most ambitious people do.

I think it can help anyone looking for mentorship, guidance, and accountability.  It’s also good for those that looking for ways to get out of quicksand. Great for being that want to be leaders and create winning teams. Personal growth is key. Reader needs to have an open mind and be open to this type of growth.

Would you buy it in the bookstore for $10 dollars when it comes out? Why or why not? 

Yeah, $8-$10 would be fine, nothing more. I’d buy it especially if the back of the cover explained the story good enough or convincingly enough. It reminds me of books by the great Jim Rohn who I really enjoyed reading a long time ago. He wrote personal development books but had stories tied into them simultaneously.
