**Chapter 6: The Fourth Meeting**  
***“If I don’t take responsibility, nobody else will”***

THE THOUGHTS still plague Jack. The fire still rages wildly through the streets of his soul. Fate, it seems, gives an unbearable load to the already downtrodden.   
But history reminds us of hope.  
The fire saved London from plague.

“BEEP\! BEEP\!”  
Jack opened his eyes and shook his head, confused. He tried to make sense of where he was, what noise was blaring and why it was going on and on.  
“BEEP\! BEEP\! BEEP\!” it continued.  
Then his head cleared and it all suddenly made sense again. His eyes focused on the bright red numbers on the clock: *6:31 am*.  
Shocked, Jack leaped out from under his covers. He bounded over to the closet, ripped out a pair of work clothes and began pulling them on, hopping around the room like a freshman late for the first day of class.  
Riley rolled over and looked at her husband running about.  
“What’s the big rush?” she moaned, squinting at the light floating in from their master bathroom.  
“I’m late for work\!” Jack responded impatiently, knowing deep down it was not her fault.  
He reached for the bedroom doorknob, planning to head straight for the garage and skip breakfast. But as he swung the door open, he stopped.  
*“You have to start working fewer hours.”*   
His mentor’s words echoed from their conversation the previous morning.   
*“Why are you still spending long hours processing all that paperwork, Jack?”*   
*“I guess anyone can do it…”* he had agreed.   
*But will anyone step up? Anyone can do it, but will they?* he thought to himself.  
*“Take care of your wife... If you create an incredible business but destroy your family, you haven’t succeeded at anything.”*  
He looked back at his wife who had fallen asleep again.  
*“She’s your lifesaver.”*  
Jack quietly closed the door and cautiously made his way down the hall, realizing his commotion might wake up the entire house. He thought of his kids and how quickly they were growing up.  
Suddenly, his perspective shifted.  
*How could I be so blind?* he thought. *If I lose Riley and the kids what is my business worth?”*  
He made his way down the stairs, walking like he had all day now. He stopped at the kitchen entry, thinking, considering, confused as to how to proceed with this change in perspective.  
And then he knew and he immediately set to work. He did have all day. Work could wait, but his family wouldn’t.  
“Who am I helping if I can’t even help them?” he whispered to no one.  
Jack found he suddenly had new vigor and energy for the day. Flinging open the cupboard doors, he grabbed a pan and a spatula. He swiveled around on his heel and grabbed the last three slices of bacon from the fridge. He turned on the stove, laid the bacon in the frying pan, and listened for the sizzle.  
He rushed—almost leaped—to the other side of the kitchen again and grabbed the coffee but stopped. It had been so long since he’d made coffee, he couldn’t remember what ratios to use.  
Just then he heard a stir from around the corner. He looked back to see his daughter Emma watching him, looking perplexed.  
“Emma\! You’re just who I need\!” he exclaimed. “How much coffee do I need to make two cups?”  
“Just two cups?” she asked, even more perplexed.  
“Like two mugs for two people\! How much water and coffee do I need to make some for two people?”  
“Well,” she said, assuming a master’s persona, “if you’re going to make this much coffee”—she pointed at the 4-cup line on the pot—“you’ll need this many scoops of grounds,” she explained as she put 5 tablespoons of coffee grounds into the maker.  
“That’s how much Mom puts in. She says she doesn’t like Grandma’s coffee because it’s always weak.”  
Jack smiled down at his intelligent daughter. What a gift she was.  
“Thanks, hun,” he said before a sizzling reminded him he had bacon on the stove. He rushed over to move it to the paper towels he had prepared.  
“What’s all this?” Riley’s voice came floating through the entryway as she strolled, yawning, into the kitchen.  
“Breakfast, can’t you see?” Jack replied happily as he cracked an egg into the bacon lathered frying pan.  
“Jack Martin making breakfast? Surely not,” Riley joked, squinting a little.  
Jack put his arm around his wife and kissed her. Emma rolled her eyes and left, groaning.  
“I’m sorry for being caught in my own little world,” he said. “Cal has been helping me see how flawed my thinking has been. I can’t keep going like this. I’ve got to slow down.”  
Riley looked up with admiration. She grinned as he talked.  
“I really am sorry about all I’ve missed,” he continued. “Jimmy’s ball games, Emma’s recitals--the church banquet. All the random times we could’ve spent together, but didn’t ‘cause I had my head in the engine,” he said with a cocked eyebrow.  
Jack’s soul began to fill with a new enthusiasm for life and for his family. His heart overflowed with love for Riley. Yes, it felt right. This was the right track for him to follow.  
“So, I thought making breakfast for the two of us was the least I could do to show my love and gratitude before work,” he said, kissing her again.  
“Jack,” Riley said, looking into his eyes, with a grin.  
“What?”  
“It’s Saturday.”

JACK RAN across the park lawn, laughing along with his kids.   
The sun shone warm in the late morning sky. The trees burst with a summer breeze that rustled the branches and sent loose leaves fluttering to the ground. Fall was approaching, which pleased the autumn loving mechanic, but it disappointed him that all three of his kids would soon be going to school.  
He looked over to his wife who sipped a latte on a nearby park bench. Beside her sat his old mentor. They were laughing as Jack goofed off with his delighted children. Though he was still troubled by the plateau he felt at his shop, his heart was full again after a very long vacancy.  
Perhaps there was hope.  
“It’s good to see you haven’t forgotten your fun side,” his old friend bellowed as Jack approached, breathing heavily from all the running, “though you look a bit out of shape\!” The man grinned broadly.  
“I’d like to see *you* keep up with them\!” Jack shot back, with a long sigh. They laughed.  
Riley got up to take the children home.  
“So, you decided to take me seriously, huh? Work less. Care for your family. Do things only you can do?”  
“Yeah, I guess so. Thanks for talking straight to me,” Jack said. “Hey, you up for a walk?”  
“Why sure, if it’s not too far. I’m an old man, ya know.”  
“There’s a cafe just up the street.”  
“Well, then, by all means.”

“I AM liking the idea of working less,” Jack explained to his old friend as they walked along. “But I have this gnawing fear that if I don’t take responsibility for things, nobody else will.”  
Jack looked at his mentor beside him. The old man walked methodically, breathing slowly in and out like a trained athlete.   
Jack wondered what wealth of wisdom and experience the man held untapped within that old gray frame.  
“Many entrepreneurs feel the same way, Jack,” the old man finally replied, “especially entrepreneurs of your type. You’re not alone. Be encouraged.”  
Jack paused, waiting for the old man to continue, but he just kept walking and breathing.  
The old man looked up and then over at Jack.  
“What?” he asked, in reply to Jack’s expectant gaze.  
“I just thought you’d have a story about this or something.”  
“Oh, I suppose I do. But you don’t want to be bored by that on a Saturday.” The old man brushed it aside. “You only promised to give me two hours a week, remember?” He smiled broadly.  
“I’ve got all day,” Jack laughed.  
“Well, then, I’ll tell you about Charlie.”

“AS YOU know, Charlie is a lifelong rancher,” the old man began.  
Jack nodded, remembering some of the rancher’s recent projects mentioned over breakfast.  
“The astounding thing about Charlie”—he drew each word out in his deep, radio bass—“is that by the time he turned everything over to his son, he didn’t work much over 30 hours a week, if my memory serves me correctly. And it wasn’t because he was lazy.”  
Jack stopped in his tracks and looked at his mentor, incredulous.  
“He’s a rancher\! How could he do that?”  
“Hold your horses, son\!” the man said, holding up his hands before putting them behind his back and continuing his slow stroll. “That’s the story I’m about to tell you.”  
He continued, “Charlie is the literal definition of a work horse. He’s like Kip, only more horse and less puppy. Has been ever since I first met him.”  
“Where did you meet him?” Jack inquired.  
“Tucson. It was a Saturday morning. He was making a quick trip down just to deliver an old bull and a couple of heifers he had sold. That was Charlie. Always runnin’ over time on the smallest things.  
“I met him at a diner Kip had recommended. We soon discovered we were both visiting from Colorado, so we struck up a friendship.  
“Amy and I once took him up on an invitation to visit his ranch. It was spring of ’81, I believe, and the place was just splendid. I mean rugged, fresh, wild, beauty. We stayed in a little cottage they had up in the hills, couple hundred yards from the ranch house.  
“Anyways, like I said, Charlie worked hard and took serious responsibility for his life, his home, and especially his ranch.  
“This is obviously a great trait for a businessman and a leader—to take responsibility. But as they say, your greatest strength is often your greatest weakness. It was hard for Charlie to keep employees for more than a year or two because he never developed them to their full potential.”  
“How do you mean?” Jack asked.  
“Well, take for instance those three cows he brought down to Tucson when I met him.”  
“Yeah?”  
“Charlie didn’t have any other business down there. His only purpose was to sell those cows. An experienced ranch hand could’ve easily done that. Instead, the head rancher himself took time out of his busy schedule to travel over ten hours just to sell a few cows.”  
The men arrived at the cafe and sat down after they had ordered their drinks.  
“Okay, so you’re saying Charlie should have had a ranch hand take care of transporting the cattle?”  
“Yes, but not just any hand. Someone he had trained for the job,” the old man replied. “Obviously you don’t just let any inexperienced joe take the cattle into their own hands. Obviously they need to be licensed to drive a truck. But even beyond that, Charlie should’ve—and he eventually learned this—taken one of his ranch hands aside and taught him how to transport livestock, interact with customers and buyers, and all that.  
“Ownership.” Jack’s mentor growled the word out like an old time preacher. “As an employer—or as any type of leader—you want those under you to take ownership of their jobs. And that first and foremost begins with the leader.”  
“If a leader is always telling people what to do or, worse yet, doing it himself, they won’t take ownership.”  
The old man paused as he took a sip of coffee.  
“You want the floor sweeper to take *ownership* of the cleanliness of the floor. That floor is his. If he doesn’t sweep it, nobody will. He should take pride in it.  
“Or, on the ranch, you want a ranch hand to take ownership of his job, whether that’s maintaining the place, transporting livestock, or wrangling horses. Let me give you another example from Charlie,” the old man interrupted himself.  
“So if a ranch uses horses to do work, they need what is called a wrangler, right?” Jack nodded, pretending to know. “This man is in charge—or should be—of all horse-related activities, which includes breeding and training--stuff like that.  
“Well, in the early days of the ranch, Charlie hired a supposed ‘wrangler’ so he could tend to other, more important ranch oversight, business strategy, and whatnot.   
“After a while, Charlie wanted the guy to start training one of their colts. So he says to him, ‘Lenny, this horse has known you since birth. You have gained the necessary experience, now I want you to halter train it.’  
“And so Charlie goes about his business for a couple days, even went on a trip out of state. When he came back, what do you know but the colt still wasn’t trained. He found the thing wandering around and unapproachable in the yard with a halter and loose rope dangling from its neck.   
“Boy, was Charlie unhappy. He stormed off in a sweat and searched the ranch high and low until he found the wrangler in the stable cleaning stalls. It was all Charlie could do to not wrangle the wrangler\! In a mad huff, Charlie fired him on the spot.”  
“On the spot?” Jack asked.  
“With no explanation\! From the wrangler as to why he hadn’t trained the colt or from Charlie as to why he fired the poor guy.”  
“Ouch. That’s harsh.”  
“Sure was\!” Swirling his coffee, the old man crossed his legs and leaned back in his chair. “After that, Charlie was a little gun-shy of negligent employees. If he was afraid something wasn’t going to get done, instead of working with his employees and empowering them to take ownership, he just did it himself. Which is why he ran into a traveling man and his wife at a diner just outside of Tucson, Arizona.” The old man pointed at himself so Jack would make the connection.  
After draining his drink, the old man leaned forward, slapped the table and said, “Well, where shall we go now?”  
Jack stifled a chuckle and exclaimed, “I thought you were old and didn’t want to walk very far?”  
“Well, whatever that ex-press-o stuff was you ordered for me has me roaring to go\!” He slapped the table again and gave a hearty laugh.  
“We can go back to the house or walk over to the shop, I suppose,” Jack suggested.  
“Where you lead, I will follow\!”  
“So, how did Charlie get his work week down to thirty hours?” Jack asked, as he stood from the table.  
“Really, at the core he had to learn the same principles Kip did, which was to focus on doing what only he could. But there were different reasons behind why each of them was distracted with the little stuff.  
“For Kip, his work was his drug, so he just did anything and everything, wasting away his energy and time for his family. Charlie, however, was simply afraid nothing would get done if he didn’t make it happen. A bad experience skewed his perspective.  
“On one hand, it is the employer’s job to nurture an environment where employees take ownership. On the other hand, there are ‘just-tell-me-what-to-do’ employees out there who are too passive to take ownership. You have to weed those out during the hiring process. In any case, the responsibility does rest ultimately on the boss.”  
The old man slowed down, apparently remembering his age, despite the influx of caffeine. Jack grinned to himself. It felt good to do casual things with his old mentor again.  
“By the time I really got to know Charlie, Kip had been meeting with Carl and me for several years already. So we invited Charlie to join us because we thought he would bring a lot to the table and figured we had a lot to offer him in return.  
“As he shared about his business and the barriers he kept coming up against, it became obvious to us that he had become an obsessive micromanager. Because Kip had a similar experience, he spoke directly into Charlie’s situation and lifestyle, pointing out how he had to loosen his grip on the ranch and let his employees take ownership—like we’ve been talking about.  
“Not surprisingly, the first two moves he made were to hire and train a self-motivated and creative wrangler, as well as a driver who could transport livestock and execute business deals. Those two things in themselves relieved a lot of stress and time off his shoulders. This freed him to work on moving the ranch forward, exploring new ventures with breeding and feeding and whatever other things ranchers do to innovate when they finally have time.”  
The old man smiled as he concluded the story.  
“So, ‘*Do what only you can do*,’ again,” Jack summarized, “and ‘*empower ownership*.’”  
“Exactly right,” the old man agreed. “If you execute those two concepts, your productivity will drastically increase.”

**Chapter 7: The Fifth Meeting**  
***“If people get close and see what’s really going on, they won’t appreciate me anymore”***

CARS WHIZZED past as Jack made his way from the cafe on Lewis Street. He shoved his hands deeper into his pockets to escape the crisp morning air preluding autumn’s arrival. The cold always energized him and he whistled as he mulled over his recent conversations with his mentor.  
He was beginning to see the value of the masterminds or “doing business in strong community,” as the old man put it. It bothered Jack how many misconceptions he had blindly believed about business\! So much for 6 years of personal experience.  
Jack fiddled with the coins in his pocket, trying to keep his hands out of the breeze. The expense of joining a local mastermind didn’t bother him now. If the success of these men was due at all to the support and feedback of the group, he wanted it too, even if it cost him.   
His only hang-up was the sharing. No matter how much sense it made, the idea of sharing his deepest struggles with peers still made him uncomfortable. Talking to his mentor, putting his family first—he was getting used to all of that. But sharing openly with other men his age seemed humiliating.  
He stopped at the edge of the sidewalk and pushed the button for the crosswalk.  
“Hey Jack, good mornin’\!” a voice called from behind him. He recognized Charlie’s western twang immediately. “You meet with Cal again after breakfast?” he asked, strolling up beside Jack.  
“Yeah I did,” Jack said. “I never realized how much experience he has. He’s learned a lot through you guys.”  
“He’s a wise man. How’s it going for ya?” Charlie asked.  
“Good\!” Jack replied.  
Charlie grinned down at the younger man, arms on his hips as if waiting expectantly for something more.  
Jack returned Charlie’s gaze, flattening his lips and nodding his head, unsure how to handle the silence.  
“Good?” Charlie repeated. “In what way?”  
Jack fumbled for the words. “Well, like I said, I’ve learned a lot.” He felt the butterflies in his stomach begin their less-than-synchronized flying.  
Charlie kept grinning. “How are things going, really?”  
Jack could feel his palms start to sweat. His heartbeat quickened. He felt his face turn red and hoped the rancher hadn’t seen the embarrassment wash over him.  
The pressure increased in his chest, twisting his stomach into knots, until finally it all bubbled over and came tumbling out in a rush of words and sweat and red cheeks. Jack felt like a fifth grader spilling his silly secrets to the teacher.  
He explained the emotions he had pent up inside him. How every Friday morning he felt like a kid at the adult table.  
He told Charlie how it was embarrassing simply to share his struggles even with a kind, trusted old mentor. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to share with his peers.   
“I’ve racked up substantial debt that I’m *still* trying to pay off. And even after six years,  I still feel lost in leading my small team\!” he vented. “I’m just a mechanic, Charlie. I’m totally out of place among men running companies in industries far more important and demanding than an auto-repair shop.” He sputtered the words as if in disdain.  
He stopped, realizing he had rambled for several minutes. He looked sheepishly at the older man. But Charlie didn’t laugh. He didn’t scold. He didn’t even look at his phone or fidget restlessly. He listened. He looked right into Jack’s eyes, nodding and smiling occasionally. Jack stood there uncomfortably folding and unfolding his arms.  
“I guess I just feel like a naive schoolboy among them—you,” Jack concluded.  
Taking his hat off and motioning for Jack to follow him, Charlie sat down on the curb. Jack felt a little conspicuous but followed the rancher’s lead and sat. He was shivering now. He noticed the crosswalk sign had turned red again.  
Charlie stretched out his long legs into the street and smiled at Jack. “I love mornings like this,” he said, closing his eyes and letting the sun warm his face. Jack shivered.   
“You know what,” Charlie began, eyes still closed, “I felt the exact same way you do when I first started meetin’ with the group.” He shoved his thumb in the direction of the cafe behind them.  
“Really?” Jack asked. “How so?”  
“Well, imagine it. There I was, this rough ’n’ tumble, boots and hat wearing cowboy. And there they were, a successful multi-restaurant owner, a pilot, and, eventually, an educated teacher. Carl understands rough ’n’ tumble, being in the Air Force and all, but even he has been refined and educated into a professional pilot.” He spread his long arms out into a shrug. “What did I know about their businesses? And of all things, why would they care about my lowly ranch? But,” he said, “I found—and I’m sure you have, too—that they don’t give a damn if we fit their style or not.”  
He paused, turning his hat around in his hands. “When I started sharing with the others about embarrassing obstacles or revenue losses on the ranch, I saw them continue to respect me and not treat me as less valuable to the group. I realized for the first time I possessed worth simply because I was a livin’, breathin’ human individual. It wasn’t because I was turning a large profit or because I was a dynamic leader—but simply because I lived and breathed.”  
He absentmindedly shoved some gravel into the street with his leather boots.  
“You know,” he said, “successful people can be the warmest and most welcoming people around. You know why I think that is?” He looked at Jack.  
“Why?”  
“Because almost all of them have been in our shoes. They are ‘failures’”—he lifted his fingers in quotes—“just like us. But they got back up, they pushed on, they sat at tables they didn’t belong at. Those crazy successful people are some of the most flawed, but it’s their flaws that helped them succeed. It’s okay not to be perfect and not have all the answers. Just learn from it and get back up again.”  
Jack shifted his weight as he sat, watching the crosswalk sign turn green for the third time.  
“That makes sense,” he told the old rancher, sighing.  
“*Hhhuhh\!*” Charlie imitated Jack’s sigh. “What’s ‘*hhhuhh\!’* about?”  
“Oh, I guess I still fear I’ll never be able to grow my business or make a profit.”  
Charlie thought about it, then said, “I worried about that too, which is why it was so good for me to be in this group and share my struggles. I talked constantly about my financial frustrations and how hard it was to turn a profit on a ranch. But eventually they helped me to let go of the need to generate results and focus on things that really mattered.”  
Jack looked confused.  
“Exactly\!” Charlie agreed. “I had the same reaction. But I discovered the more desperate I got to turn a profit the more frustrated my employees and I were. Eventually, I learned to focus only on building healthy systems with my team, my finances, and my relationships. With healthy systems in place results come—slowly, but eventually and with stability.  
“It’s like this,” he said, “I don’t do much with crops myself, but business is kind of like a farmer who plants a seed into the ground. He puts in place systems to plant, water, and tend the seed until harvest. Sometimes business is just a matter of plantin’ and waterin’ seeds, and waitin’ for them to grow. But that takes patience and a willin’ness to forgo short-term success for long-term sustainability and easy management.”  
“So you did that on your ranch?” Jack asked. “You let go of the drive to turn a profit and instead set up systems?”  
“Yeah, because you can work on systems and maintain them over the long haul—they’re sustainable. Whereas when you’re just runnin’ around doing business by the seat of your pants tryin’ to make an immediate profit, you will eventually burn out your engine, as it were.”  
“So, just like that you changed?” Jack asked.  
“Well, it wasn’t on a dime. It was a slow process of learnin’ from the others and failin’—which proved to me they were right,” he said, waving his arm in the direction of the cafe again. “But learnin’ and failin’ wasn’t the worst of it. As I began to see the light, I had to do one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.”  
“What was that?”  
“I had to ask people close to me—these gentlemen as well as relatives—to lend me some money to get through the year—this was about six months after I joined them. The scariest part was I had no idea how I was goin’ to pay them back.” The rancher shook his head. “I don’t recommend it as a business strategy, but it’s where I was at. It was hard asking for help”—he scrunched up his nose—“but you know what?”  
“What?”  
“When I expressed my need for help,” he said, “I got tremendous support from everyone. They rallied right around me and helped me through. That’s the power of doing business within strong community.”  
 “‘Business within strong community,’” Jack repeated. “Cal says that.”  
“You said you were embarrassed to share your struggles just now,” the rancher asked.  
“Yeah, kind of,” Jack said.  
“Did I make you feel stupid?”  
Jack shook his head.  
“Did I walk away from you?”  
“No. You were very encouraging, why?”  
“As you were talking and unloading everything you had kept inside for so long, did you feel better?”  
“Yeah, I guess,” Jack shrugged.  
“I bet,” the rancher said, holding up a finger, “you even begin to see solutions for some of your problems just through talking about them, am I right?”  
“Well,” Jack stammered, “I don’t know if they’re solutions.”  
“That’s what can happen when you and others share and brainstorm together\!” Charlie smiled at the younger man. “Jack, you know good men. I know you do because you are a good man and good men attract good friends. Go, find them and start sharin’. Start, as Carl says, ‘a lifestyle of contribution.’ Start a mastermind, Jack.”  
The younger man mumbled a reply, trying to think it through.  
“Well, the day’s leavin’ us behind\!” Charlie declared as he stood up. He pointed at the pedestrian sign “Light’s green now.”

CHARLIE LEFT Jack alone to his thoughts and shivers.  
The mechanic was thinking of all the businessmen and leaders who he could invite to a mastermind. It still felt weird to him, imagining how the conversation would go.  
*“Hey, you wanna get together and talk about our problems?”* Jack would ask.  
The friend would probably wrinkle his nose and shake his head. *“I’m sorry, Jack, I have important things to do.”*  
Jack blushed just thinking about it.  
He slowly rose from the curb and watched Charlie stroll away humming to himself. Jack tried to imagine what the rancher must have been like in his younger years.   
*Probably wore the same jean outfit.* He chuckled to himself.   
The light turned green again and Jack crossed the street, climbed into his truck, and went to work.

JACK HAD begun to view his shop from a new perspective. He no longer felt intense pressure to make something of himself. Yet he also took comfort in knowing success was possible.  
Stepping inside the dusty office, he paused. He looked at the piles of bills, flyers, and *Popular Mechanics* magazines strewn across the desk over his laptop.  
A thought occurred to him and instantly he knew what to do. Leaning out the office door, Jack shouted to the young men in the shop.  
“Hey, Gabriel\!” he called. “Come here for a sec’\!”  
The 18-year-old looked at his co-workers nervously before jogging toward the office.  
“Yeah, boss?” he said.  
“Do you enjoy working here, Gabe?”  
“Yes sir, I appreciate the job\!” he said, a little too enthusiastically to be genuine.  
“You like changing oil and grabbing tools and parts for me and Pete?”  
“Happy to help wherever I can, sir,” the young man assured.  
“But aren’t you good with computers? Wouldn’t you rather be somewhere else messing around with computers and software and stuff?” Jack asked.  
“I mean, I suppose so. But I didn’t get a job like that. You hired me and I’m glad to be working.”  
“Would you enjoy doing the computer work for the shop?” Jack asked the teenager.  
Gabe thought for a second. “I’ve never really considered it. I suppose I could enjoy it.”  
“You’d enjoy it more than working on the cars, I bet?” Jack said, perceiving restraint in the answer.  
“Actually, to be honest, sir, yes, I would,” the young man admitted.  
“It’s all yours then,” Jack said. “If you want it, I’ll give you responsibility over all the computer work: records, scheduling, billing—all of that.’”   
Gabe put his hand over his chin, as if considering the negotiation.  
“I’ll bump up your pay to be worth it. If you agree, all of this”—he spread his hands out to the office—“will be your domain.”  
“All of it?” Gabe exclaimed.  
“Yup\! I’ll move my stuff over there,” Jack said, motioning to the desk in the corner, hidden by boxes, papers, and parts. “And you can do whatever you need to be comfortable with this desk.”  
He thought a little more, eyeing the rest of the office.  
“Perhaps I’ll bring my wife in and get her to help shine this place up and make it a little more pleasant and welcoming. Otherwise, it’s all yours. Are you cool with this? Do you want to give it a try for a while and reevaluate later?”  
“Yes, sir—I mean no, sir—I mean I want to do it.”  
“Good\! You ready to start?”  
“Yes, sir\!”  
“Okay, I’ll go over everything with you as soon as I clear away this junk.”  
Jack started looking through all the stuff on his desk. He stacked the magazines together and tossed them into the trash. Setting all the bills and business paperwork right next to the computer, he began sorting through the loose-leaf papers. A little flyer caught his attention:  
“Share, learn, and grow with people like you\!” it read. “Join us at our weekly business mastermind\!”

JACK COULDN’T believe what he was doing. Upon finding the mastermind invitation (which he normally would’ve thrown away), he called the number and asked to visit the next Saturday.  
Now he sat around a restaurant table with five other businessmen, four of whom he had never met before, and one who was none other than Mr. Robertson, the roofer. Jack laughed at himself as he remembered the half-hearted conversation he’d had with the roofer at the church banquet. His perspective had changed dramatically since then.  
They were going around the table sharing about themselves so Jack could get to know them better. It all reminded him of the group of retired men who met every Friday morning in the cafe on Lewis Street. Only these guys were his own age.  
Each one talked about their businesses, why they had started, what they had gone through and overcome, and what they hoped would happen in the future.  
Then it was Jack’s turn. His heart beat a little faster. Adrenaline surged through his body. His lip quivered a little as he spoke.  
“I … it … it,” he stuttered and blushed, but he pushed through. “To be honest, it freaks me out to share my problems with you.”   
There. He had it out. The men chuckled.  
“Believe me, we’ve all been there, bro,” the leader, a guy named Kyle, assured Jack. “Just say whatever you’re comfortable sharing.”  
Jack continued, explaining some of his backstory and the current state of his business. The more he shared the easier it got. He even told them some of the humiliating details, such as his debt, and how long it had taken him to realize his wife should be a top priority over his business.  
“It’s hard—and embarrassing—for me to share this. In fact, it has taken me a long time to even see the value of a group like this,” he told the men.  
Their continual nodding and expressions of agreement relieved Jack. They seemed to understand what he was talking about.  
Charlie had been right. It felt good to share with people who understood and still respected him. Plus, they had good insight into some of his problems, even though none of them were mechanics.  
Jack knew he would be joining them the next week and every week after that. These guys were real men, successful, strong, brilliant. Yet they spoke freely about their weaknesses. They even asked him—the new guy—for input, which he shared humbly. Being able to contribute to other people’s success boosted his own confidence and motivation to work hard towards success himself.  
Jack sat back and smiled. His old friend would be delighted; he had found his “strong community”.
