**Chapter 8: The Last Meeting**  
***Isn’t a Mastermind Just Shooting the Breeze?***

***Three Years Later…***  
THE OWNER of *Jack’s Auto-Repair* drove his old Tacoma into the garage one last time.

Pete, the newest chief mechanic in town, waved at his boss.

“Good mornin’\!” he greeted the smiling Jack.

“Morning\!” the boss replied. “You ready for this?”

“Yes sir\!”

Jack’s eight-year-old son Jimmy jumped out of the truck and ran into the office. 

The mechanic had done himself proud over the previous three years. Customers bragged freely about their favorite mechanic shop and how well they treated their customers.

“That garage on Main. It’s the best. If they can’t getcha in right away, they’ll make you a priority later on. That young secretary of theirs, he’ll even call you up personally to tell when there’s a new opening available. Can’t beat their prices or efficiency, either\!”

Jack Martin walked into his old office. Jimmy dangled off the secretary as Gabe tried to continue working on the computer.

“Careful, Jimmy. You bother Gabe too much and he might not want you to come back\!” Jack joked. 

He stood still, taking it all in. The place was in tip-top shape. Riley had done herself proud in decorating the office so anyone would feel comfortable waiting in it. Apart from the dead flowers on the coffee table, it was just how she had put it.

“Mechanic shops are always so dirty and gross,” she had told her husband. “Make it pleasant enough for people to *want* to come. And provide snacks\!”

But the time had come for Jack to move on. He loved the thrill of presenting people with restored vehicles. But he realized he loved helping restore lives even more. He had done what he could to transform lives through the shop. He was proud of what he had done here. Pete had excelled even Jack in skill, Nate had moved on with a bigger, better company. And Gabe was working his way through college while renovating the entire environment at the repair shop through computers.

Jack gathered what was left on his desk into his briefcase. With one last thank-you and handshake, he said goodbye and drove away.

But there was still one last thing to do before he left town.

“WHAT DID he say?”

Jack and his mentor were back at their regular spot after Thursday morning breakfast. 

“He thought all we did at the meetings was shoot the breeze. He was like, ‘I’ve got a few friends I play golf with on the weekends. Isn’t that the same thing?’”

They chuckled at the thought.

“What did you say then?”

“I told him it’s much more than that,” Jack said. “We do spend time catching up, but we’re intentional about helping each other grow.”

“Oh, some people are so skeptical at first, aren’t they?” the old man winked. 

“They certainly are\!” Jack exclaimed, rolling his eyes.  
“You said it right. Every mastermind should take time to catch up and make small-talk. Good camaraderie is important for deep growth to happen. But remember, leaders are busy. Don’t waste their time. Focus the discussions on things that matter.”

“So how did you guys focus your meetings?”

“Good question,” the old man mused. “We made a lot of mistakes along the way, as I’m sure your group does, too,” he explained. “But we learned quickly it was easy to make false assumptions. Once we figured this out, we began taking time to ask clarifying questions whenever someone shared a story, or problem before we assumed we knew the answer.”

“Makes sense,” Jack agreed.

“Everyone comes at life and business from different angles--which is the beauty of masterminds. But our differences can cause misunderstandings which easily result in wrong assumptions. We made sure we clearly understood each situation. Remember, Jack, just because your perspective is different doesn’t mean you’re right *nor* does it mean you’re wrong. It just means you're different. So don’t hesitate to share your perspective--it will be very helpful. But also never assume you know the right or wrong answer.

Jack loved listening to his old mentor, especially when he got passionate. Even after listening to him for years, Jack thought he must still have an untapped storehouse of wisdom.

“Also, something else we found helpful was to pick one thing to act on every week. There are a hundred suggestions you could try to implement every week. You just can’t. So, after brainstorming together, we chose one thing each of us would do that week. And we made it a priority, because nothing ever changes if you don’t prioritize it. Make it as important as eating. But don’t try to do everything at once.

“How do you make it a priority?”

“Well, depending on what type of assignment it was, I literally made it as important as eating. If I was trying to develop a daily habit, I would refuse to eat lunch until I had done it.”

“That certainly would motivate me\!” Jack said, already thinking of the chicken sandwich he was going to have for lunch. “What else did you do?”

His old mentor thought for a moment.

“Ah\!” he finally said. “Here’s a neat trick we learned several years after doing the same thing over and over again. Structure is important, but we found it sometimes gets really monotonous. When this happens, people easily disengage from the group. So we took time to change things up. For example, sometimes we each shared from books we had recently read--sometimes going so far as to rent a room and actually teach it to each other. Other times, we’d all attend a seminar together. This was especially fun if it was out of state, because it meant we could take a road trip. Sometimes we’d go just as guys, other times we’d bring our wives and make a grand party out of it.”

Jack wondered what it would be like to road trip with these passionate men.

“So where did the structure come from?” Jack asked.

“You know how Charlie likes to talk a lot?” the old mentor asked Jack, eyes twinkling.

“Yes sir\!” Jack chuckled. “I’ve had several a lengthy chats with him, actually.”

“Oh have you?” the old man laughed. “Well, if you think he talks a lot now, you should have seen him when he first came. He wouldn’t be seated at the table two minutes before he’d have us all wrapped up in some grand story,” Cal smiled as he spoke. “As much as we loved Charlie and his stories, we knew that’s not why any of us were attending the meeting. This taught us two things. Number one, we needed an official moderator. Carl was the obvious choice, since he already did so informally. Number two, we needed to set boundaries.

“As you know, the meetings originally were born out of our note-swapping in college. After Carl and I finished the class and still wanted to keep sharing ideas back and forth, we started meeting at a cafe not too far from campus.

“When it was just the two of us, things went pretty smoothly and naturally. But soon Kip started coming and then Charlie and Trev.

“We hashed things out so hard\! We’d tear each idea apart and brainstorm how to put it back together--it was great\!” The old man laughed again. “But we all felt--especially at the behest of Carl--like we could get more done if we were more intentional with our time.

“So with Carl at the helm, we structured our meetings. That’s when we came up with what you’ve seen every week--or pretty close to it at least. Obviously it has evolved over the years, especially after we all retired.”

“How’d you come up with the ‘hot-seat’?” Jack asked.

“It just kind of evolved, as I recall. It likely started when Carl and I first went up to visit Kip. We saw how helpful it was for him to share freely without interruption. He also appreciated what little input we gave after he had shared. Soon we were all doing it. From there, we naturally started brainstorming each problem together. And every week, we’d follow-up.”

Jack’s mentor leaned back and crossed his legs. 

“Once, we invited a guy named Adam to join us. He was a construction worker or something along those lines--I don’t remember. He came for several weeks before we all convinced Carl to ask him to leave.”

Jack gaped. “I never knew this\! Why on earth?” he asked.

“Because he was all talk, talk, talk and no action. He’d sit in the ‘hot-seat’ and share all his problems week after week. But we quickly realized he kept having the same problems--which would’ve been fine, if the guy had honestly tried our advice. But it became obvious he wasn’t taking it seriously. We felt like he was taking advantage of the group and stealing our time. So we asked him to leave.”

Jack raised his eyebrows. “Ouch,” he said.

“Yeah, it wasn’t fun for either him or us. We all felt bad. But we valued our time and the integrity of the group. That’s when we started choosing weekly ‘assignments’ after every session and being more careful who we allowed to join us.”

“Wow, you guys were serious,” Jack said.

They sipped their coffees as the conversation lulled.

“So, uh,” the old man finally said. “You’re all packed?”

“Yup,” Jack replied.

“This old town’s not gonna be the same without ya, son.” Jack thought he saw a tear slipping down his old mentor’s face.

“Yeah, we’re going to miss it.”

“Don’t forget about me, now. Visit at least once a year.” The old man smiled, unashamed at the tears now streaming down his face.

“Only if you do the same\!” Jack said. “Thanks for everything, Cal.”

“I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m so proud of you, Jack Martin.”
