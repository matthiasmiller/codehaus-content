What were your two favorite chapters?  
Chapter 1 because I like how you set the scene. I can already sympathize with the characters and you’ve also shown conflict and established the tone of the story at the very start. I also like Chapter 4 because it shows the bond between Jack and the old man. The message about using time efficiently is loud and clear.  
What were your two least favorite chapters?  
Chapter 2 sounded a bit redundant because it continued to show that Jack’s wife was upset with him. It was evident already in Chapter 1 and I feel that scene can be eliminated to tighten the story. The readers are already aware of that and your goal is to advance the plot. All the other chapters are good.  
Was there any place where you got lost or confused?  
Nope, but my suggestion would be to tighten some areas especially Chapter 2\.  
Would you recommend it to a friend? Why or why not?  
Yes, because it’s very well written and you can see the struggle early on. People can relate to Jack’s internal and external challenges.  
Would you buy it in the bookstore for $10 dollars when it comes out?  
I like the story and it offers a universal message about maintaining work/life balance, prioritizing family and relationships that matter and valuing what’s important. People can relate to this.  
Why or why not?  
My only concern is that maybe $10 might be too high since the book is only 71 pages. You might want to price it a little less. Perhaps $7.99 would be better.
