**Epilogue**  
I stumbled blindly into entrepreneurship.

When I started, I was simply looking to answer a deep craving inside of me. I had no idea the answer to that craving was entrepreneurship.

Frustrated by my lack of results in business, I started studying the habits of the people who were successful. I quickly realized they intentionally surrounded themselves with people who could help them better themselves and grow. 

In my journey, I’ve discovered we must be very intentional about *who* we surround ourselves with. The right people will give us a tremendous amount of energy and forward momentum, while the wrong people will knock the wind out of us.

When I started my journey, I had no idea the vast number of well-intentioned but deeply misinformed coaches and trainers in the business arena. I’ve watched individual entrepreneurs slowly self-destruct because they’ve started ingesting toxic advice. I’ve also watched masterminds lose their collaborative culture because of that same toxic advice.

Discernment always comes at a price. For some, it costs a few thousand dollars. For others, it may cost tens of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately, for far too many, it ends up costing their marriage, their family, and even their health.

Discernment is simple but not easy.

If you want to know whose advice to listen to, observe their life, because you will become like them. And if you want to know who they are becoming, look at the lives of their mentors and the people they’re learning from. Over time, that’s who you will become as well.

The people you surround yourself with will influence your outcomes. Placing yourself into a mastermind with like-minded entrepreneurs can amplify the impact you want to have. And a mastermind that resonates with who you are and what you want to achieve will be worth every cent of your investment.

We offer business masterminds for business owners who value collaboration, growth, and integrity. We don’t pretend to be a silver bullet that will fix everyone’s challenges. Because of this, we will turn people away if we feel they are not a good fit or won’t benefit significantly from being a member. However, the business owners who end up in our groups find a tremendous amount of openness, support, and accountability.

If you’re uncertain of where start or would simply like help finding a mastermind that can support you and help you move forward, feel free to reach out to us. You can call us at (719) 458-1650 or email matt@multiplyyourstrengths.com.

Whether you join our mastermind, find a different mastermind that fits you better, or simply become more intentional in building powerful relationships in business, I urge you to find the people you must run with in this season of life and go for it\!

Let’s win together.
