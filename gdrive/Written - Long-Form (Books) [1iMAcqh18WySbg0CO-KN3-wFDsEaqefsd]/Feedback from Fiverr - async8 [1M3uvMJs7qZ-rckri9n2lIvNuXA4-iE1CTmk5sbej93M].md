1\. TWO FAVORITE CHAPTERS?  
Chapters six and seven were my favourite chapters. They resonated with me because they  
showed tangible examples of Jack’s connection with his family and employees. They showed  
his growth and maturity, and provided examples of how he applied some of the concepts  
alluded to in the book. Chapter 1 was also very good, as it did a good job of setting up the story.  
2\. TWO LEAST FAVORITE CHAPTERS?  
Chapter 8 was my least favourite, as it left too many loose ends. What’s Jack moving on to?  
Who is the old man, really? Where is Jack taking his family and how does his family feel about  
it? Has he become less self-centred? The end does not depict this. Do As a more general  
comment, the development of characters apart from Jack (his wife, the old man, the kids, his  
employees) would really help to enrich the story.  
3\. ANY PLACE WHERE YOU GOT LOST OR CONFUSED?  
Chapter 8 is confusing, as it’s unclear what Jack is moving on to do. The implication is that he’s  
moving on to create master mind groups – but this could be clarified.  
4\. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IT TO A FRIEND?  
I would recommend it to my younger Gen X and older Millennial (25-39) friends. These groups  
are more likely to be at the point in life where they would experience some of the challenges  
outlined in this book. On the other hand, older Gen Xers have likely made and learned from  
their mistakes, and those who haven’t, are likely less willing to put in the effort to change.  
A good time to launch would be the end of December / beginning of January, to capitalize on the  
market of people who are setting New Years resolutions.  
5\. WOULD YOU BUY IT IN THE BOOKSTORE FOR $10?  
If the epilogue were a prologue instead, I would be more likely to buy. Seeing the epilogue  
while leafing through the book, would lead me to conclude that the objective is to sell  
Mastermind subscriptions, rather than offer advice. For that reason, I would recommend that  
the Epilogue should actually be a Prologue.
