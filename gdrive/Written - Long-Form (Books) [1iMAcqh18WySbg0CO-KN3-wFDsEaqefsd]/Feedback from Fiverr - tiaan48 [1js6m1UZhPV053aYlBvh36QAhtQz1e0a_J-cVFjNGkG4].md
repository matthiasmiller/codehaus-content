I have finished the book and it was quite enjoyable.

Please find herewith my review of your book, and the answers to your questions.

What were your two favorite chapters?

\- My favorite chapter were 3, 8 and the epilogue. This is mostly because the I fee that the most important messages are hidden away in these chapters. For example, when Jack's mentor told him about the mastermind in chapter 3, and how you should focus on one specific thing at a time that is in line with your passion.  
Chapter 8 and the Epilogue is great as well, as it tells you the importance of surrounding yourself with good successful and ambitious people that can help you grow and be successful. You are in fact the average of the 5 people you spend most time with. It also tells you how all people are different in how they approach things, and it's important to respect that.

What were your two least favorite chapters?  
\-The first two chapters I think.. I wasn't sure what the story was about, and it didn't give me enough clues. It could also maybe improve a bit in capturing the reader's attention, and also promote the benefits of reading this book (these could however be listed on the back or cover of the book)

Was there any place where you got lost or confused?  
\-I got a bit confused with the names during the first few chapters. I didn't understand the London thing. Also, When Jack had to watch the shop for Mr. Joe while he was away. Wasn't it Jack's shop? 

Would you recommend it to a friend? Why or why not?  
\-I would. There are some nice messages spread throughout the book which is very valuable for any entrepreneur/aspiring entrepreneur. 

Would you buy it in the bookstore for $10 dollars when it comes out?  
Why or why not?  
\-I would buy it if there is a clear indication of what the book is about and how it will help me. At the moment, I didn't really see the benefit before I started reading. You could maybe play around with the title or add some quotes on the back or the book or give a nice catchy description.  
It is also important to capture the reader's attention within the first few pages of the book.

Hope this helps. Let me know if there are any other questions.
