1. Isn’t friction a good thing?

   1. Example if a car..  
      1. Putting oil in the car…  
      2.   
   2. Example of marriage \+ Pancakes  
      1.   
   3. Some is… like when I have a legitimate perspective that you need  
   4. Others, not so much…  
      1. Like when things are unnecessarily hard  
      2. Or when I have tunnel vision & I’m just focused on me & not the company & customer’s success

2. What are some examples of misalignment that you’ve seen between a manufacturer and a subcontractor:

   1. One example is a place where the subcontractor didn’t have a standard pricing sheet, so the salespeople would put together quotes based on the pricing they had, then the subcontractor would change pricing. It ended up creating friction between the salespeople and the customer, destroying trust and making it harder than necessary to close deals.

   2. Another example is a subcontracted hauler who really struggled with customer communication. He should have delegated this, or he should have found a way to make this work. But again, it trickled back up to the salespeople

3. What about misalignment between sales & marketing?

   1. I’ve seen things like marketing pushing a product that doesn’t sell…  
   2. Or marketing giving good leads, but sales complaining because they actually need to roll up their sleeves and put in some work to close them  
   3. As an owner here’s a key…  
      1. Close rate overall, vs.  
      2. Close rate by contact rate

4. What about misalignment between sales & production?

   1. Production is pushing for efficiency, so they push certain buildings through as inventory, even if they’re not in demand  
      1. Fix: open communication between dealers/salespeople and production

   2. OR, sales tries to close a deal on something production can’t fulfill on

   3. OR, production isn’t communicating lead times back to sales, so sales is making lead time promises to customers but customers are calling back when it’s not met

5. What about grumpy and whiny dealers or salespople?

   1. Listen… really good salespeople are sensitive to bumps in the road. They want the runway clear for people to buy. You need to discern whether it’s someone who:  
      	Just has a negative attitude  
      	Is picking up on something that’s wrong  
   2. But a lot of times, there’s some substance in theri complaint if you’re willing to look under the surfac

6. What is the difference between a sales-led vs. a production-led company?

   1. Sales is the heartbeat of the company, because it means having your ear to the ground of what customers want
