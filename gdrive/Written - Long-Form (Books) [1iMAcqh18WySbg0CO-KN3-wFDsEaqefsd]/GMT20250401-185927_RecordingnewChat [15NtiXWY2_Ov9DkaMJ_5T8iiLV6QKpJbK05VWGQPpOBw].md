00:52:10	Nathaniel Tillinghast-Raby:	It sounds like alignment \- between business and market, business and customer, vertical, horizontal, etc. \- could in your view be an expanded view of Harry Browne’s principle of selling: “find this prospect’s motivation and appeal to it and it alone.” (Harry Browne wrote what was called by Gary Bencivenga the best book on sales, “The Secret of Selling Anything”  
00:52:32	Nathaniel Tillinghast-Raby:	Find this department’s motivation, market’s motivation, etc., and line up everything like that  
00:54:49	Perry Marshall:	Anybody relate to this?  
00:56:59	Colin Campbell:	100%. Daydreaming out of violence/fear in family turned into creative capability in marketing… Professional avoidance and an empathy to accept distorted behaviour.  
00:57:19	Avram Freedberg:	Sounds like he knows a lot but it's hard to process for the listener.  
00:57:27	Barb Ferrel-Rylander:	Totally relate

01:07:50	Barb Ferrel-Rylander:	High sensitivity correlates with giftedness.  Also the jumping…very much so.  The massive intake of awareness, the sensitivity to sound, to a mega-flow of information all day every day…certainly results in enhanced emotional response.  That only makes sense.
