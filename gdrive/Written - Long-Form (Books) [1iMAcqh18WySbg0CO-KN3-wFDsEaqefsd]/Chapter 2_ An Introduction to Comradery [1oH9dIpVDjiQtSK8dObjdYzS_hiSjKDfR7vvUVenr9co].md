**Chapter 2**   
***An Introduction to Comradery***

A MAN feels despair when his thoughts tell him he’s not enough. He feels anger when his heart tells him that he *is* enough but fails to prove it.

In his heart, Jack knew he had what it took to run a successful mechanic shop, but his mind screamed to the contrary and did a better job proving it.

This internal friction consumes a man until it takes him out.

Jack made it to the church banquet. He escorted his beautiful wife to their seats. He smiled and chatted like everything was all right with Mr. Martin.

But inside he burned. 

Despite all his fanciful dreams and determination, his business was mediocre, his marriage dissolving into frustrations, his children certainly (so he thought) disappointed in him, and his social life a complete facade.

He nodded and smiled as Mr. Robertson, the roofer, drolled on and on about some business accountability group he had started attending.

“It’s a little pricey,” Mr. Robertson said. “But totally worth it. I’ve received such good input and support from the other business people attending.”

“Oh yeah?” Jack replied placidly.

“Yeah, they helped me find solutions to some employee-related obstacles I was facing. Hey\!” He seemed to have a sudden inspiration. “Why don’t you join us next week?” Robertson suggested.

“Oh, there’s no way I’d have time.” Jack surprised even himself at the indifference in his own voice.

“Well, if you ever find the time, let me know. It’s worth it, man.”

“Sure” was all Jack could answer.

THE MARTINS drove home in silence.

It was all Jack could do to hold his tongue. It was all Jack could to do to not give in to the thoughts screaming in his head.

He wanted to prove himself, to compile all his arguments and level the prosecution. But Jack knew good husbands don’t “level” their wives. The last thing he needed was a third strike in the good-husbandry game.

So he continued to shun his despair to the darkest alleys of his soul. 

But the fire within him intensified.

“I’m--I’m sorry” the words tumbled out of his mouth. He didn’t look at Riley because he didn’t want to see her not looking at him. “I’m sorry for forgetting…” he trailed off, waiting for some sort of acknowledgement.

It never came.

Jack clenched his teeth. 

They arrived home, went to bed, and fell asleep.

*“I’LL BE gone until nine tomorrow morning, Jack. Do you think you can handle the shop on your own?”*

*“Yes sir. Don’t worry about me, Mr. Joe. I’m your man\!”*

*Joe smiled, “Yes, you are son. My only man.”*

*The next morning, young Jack opened the shop on his own for the first time. It felt good, even exhilarating. It felt like, for the first time, this was his shop, too, not just Joe’s.*

*The phone rang.*

*“You’ve reached Joe’s Auto Repair. This is Jack speaking. How may I help you?” He said into the telephone.*

*“Hi Jack\!” asked a sweet voice on the other side. “Is Mr. Joe there?”*

*“I’m sorry, he won’t be in until nine o’clock. Would you like to leave a message for him?”*

*“Oh, well, I just needed to ask if he could spare me a little more time to make my payment. You see, it’s my grandson… He needed some extra cash for college and, well…” the old lady trailed off.*

*“I’m sorry ma'am, what is your name?”*

*“Mrs. Jensen. Joe will know me.”*

*Jack knew Joe couldn’t afford another late payment from a customer. He wished Mrs. Jensen realized that, but it wasn’t his decision.*

*Gulping back his frustration, he said what he knew Joe would want him to say, “I’ll let him know you called, Mrs. Jensen. Can I do anything more for you?”*

*“No, that’s all I needed. Thank-you\! It was nice talking to you\! Ba-bye now\!”*

*Jack squinted down at his note.* 

*Another IOU. Another late payment. Another stunted paycheck for Jack.*

This was a dream. Even his dreams were reminding Jack of the frustration that built up within him even before college. They reminded him of why he thought the way he did. Why he believed a business was nothing without profit. And more significantly, why he was nothing without a profitable business.

But then the dream changed from past memories to present torment.

*“I’m disappointed in you, Jack.”* 

*Riley’s face floated before him, vivid yet vague, as only dreams can do.* 

*“Why can’t you do better?”*

*“I’m trying\!” Jack shouted in his dream. “You just don’t understand what it takes to run a business. It takes hard work, lots of hard work--and patience, Ri\!  But I’m trying\! Just give me a break.”*

“Give me a break\!”

Jack jolted out of sleep. He looked around, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. The room seemed unfamiliar, like the world often seems after abruptly waking from a deep sleep. 

He looked at the clock and sighed. It read *4:34 AM*. Too soon to wake up, too late to get any more decent rest.

He turned to his wife, as was his habit. 

She really was beautiful. And he loved her; he knew it in his head. But inwardly, he still felt the confused, nondescript frustration you get after dreaming negatively of someone you know. He felt angry at her. And he felt angry at his anger.

Her sullenness had hurt last night. It was immature. And it frustrated him. But he still loved her and he’d do anything to make her happy, even if it meant working long, hard hours.

But did she want that?

Of course, she wanted the business to be successful. She certainly put a lot of work into it. But what she really wanted was him, wasn’t it? She wanted him to care about her and their children. To remember them--and the stuff they cared about.

She wanted him to remember first tee-ball games and romantic events. Instead, he was consumed with growing his business. But what kind of husband would he be if he failed as a provider?

His employees wanted a respectable paycheck, a positive future, and a boss who could afford to let them take meaningful times off. But the business Jack ran straddled such a fine financial line, he could never afford to let them go, or give generous bonuses.

Whatever he was doing wasn’t working. One tear loosed from Jack’s eye as he wrestled with the clash of strangling frustration and overwhelming love.

He remembered the invitation he had to breakfast the following morning. Perhaps his old friend could help him find the answers. He sure hoped so.

“JACK\!” THE Old Man called from his table, motioning him over. “Have a seat.”

The young entrepreneur surveyed the scene as he made his way over to where his old friend sat. 

Four others surrounded the table with the old man. One man, with hat, boots, and a large-buckled belt--obviously playing the part of the cowboy--was telling some grand story and gesticulating dramatically, while the others around him listened and laughed and scoffed at the details. 

Another man sitting beside the cowboy and of a considerably different size and style, who was looking to be in his low 60s, rolled his eyes at the cowboy and offered his hand to Jack.

“My name is Trevor, but only officially. Please, call me Trev unless you work for the government.” The men all laughed and then in turn introduced themselves.

These men were confident, with a distinguished aura about them, as if they had done much and been much, and knew it. Yet, they immediately put Jack at ease with their comfortable and casual down-to-earth interaction. Something told him these were great men, yet he didn’t recognize a single face in the group.

“Jack, these are some of my oldest friends,” the man explained.

“Yeah, you can tell by the gray hair,” said the fattest and seemingly oldest of them who spoke in a weak kiwi accent. Jack tried to remember his name, but had already forgotten.

“Longest lasting, I mean\!” the old man clarified rolling his eyes. “Please, have a seat, Jack.” He motioned to the one empty seat around the table.

The mechanic felt like a small child sitting with the adults, but the men welcomed him in with no hesitation, as if he were one of them.

Jack observed more than he participated in the conversation that followed. He had never seen such a group interact before. These distinguished men laughed until they cried. They told stories and reminisced together. They joked and poked fun at each other, yet affirmed each other through the twinkle in their eye.

But soon, after the jokes were out and the food was in, the atmosphere stilled and Jack’s old friend spoke up.

“Carl, how goes the project?”

“Oh, it’s going fine. Just put the finishing touches on the frame this week. Now I just have to finish off the inside and get to work on the important stuff.”

Jack looked at his friend inquiringly, who took the hint.

“Carl here is a former career pilot. He began in Vietnam and ended in private commercial. Now, he’s building an airplane of his own.”

Jack raised his eyebrows, speechless.

“For a customer?” he finally asked.

“No, son, I’m retired,” Carl laughed. All the men laughed, too, though not in a condescending way, but with the amusement older siblings experience when their younger brother asks a silly question.

Jack couldn’t believe Carl, retired and in his upper sixties, was building an airplane. 

The conversation continued with each of the men pestering Carl with questions about what exactly needed to happen next, what the costs were, whether or not the project was getting along as quickly as he had expected, and other details they apparently found interesting.

Soon, it was another man’s turn to share.

One was a retired educator who currently tutored a smattering of struggling students. Another had been a career restaurateur, who now ran a homeless shelter in town.

And so it went, each of them in turn sharing what they were doing and taking questions from everybody about how it was going.

Jack wasn’t sure whether to be astonished, amused, or intrigued. These successful leaders and businessmen who had worked hard all their lives, weren’t done. They hadn’t quit life to play shuffleboard for the next 20 years. They were still going, still chasing their dreams, still changing the world.

“WHAT WAS that?” Jack asked his friend after everyone left.

“What was what?” the old man said.

“All that\!” Jack exclaimed, waving his arms in circles. “All that talking and brainstorming?”

“Those are my friends and comrades-in-life,” he replied. “This is what I wanted to show you. I believe this is part of the answer to your questions, Jack.”

“Your friends are the answer?”

“Sort of.”

“I’m sorry, I don’t get it.” Jack wrinkled his brow.

“This group of ours has been meeting in some shape or form on and off for nearly forty years.”

Jack’s mouth dropped open.

“Forty years?\!”

“Yes sir. Certainly, a couple have come and gone and we’ve added a few, but for the most part, this has been the group.”

“Why on earth?” Jack questioned.

“Because we needed it. Each of us were businessmen or leaders in some way. We knew we needed support, advice, and outside perspective. So we’ve gotten together nearly every week to eat breakfast, share a joke or two, and help each other in our endeavors. It started out as a business strategy. Now we’re fast friends.”

He leaned close and lowered his voice to a whisper, “Truth is, we keep starting projects and building stuff just to have a reason to get together.” He let out a deep chuckle.

Jack shook his head slowly.

Looking him in the eye, the old man said: “If you want your business to grow, you have to find men like this. Men who are doing stuff. Men who are learning and growing and have connections.”

“That sounds ideal, but I would never have time--” The old man stopped Jack mid-sentence.

“Wait\! Before you start going on about how time-consuming this is, let me explain my plan.”

“Your plan?”

“Jack, yesterday you vented to me about how frustrated you were with the business. What you thought you wanted from the business was not only not happening, but even changing. You were tired, frustrated, and angry.”

“Angry? I don’t recall saying--”

“I’ve been in your shoes, son,” he interrupted Jack again. “I know that frustration. You’re up against a wall you can’t identify, let alone get around. It’s creating a lot of friction inside of you. I saw the look in your eye. I felt it in your mood. I heard it in your voice. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to burn-up and burn-out. But you don’t know what to do.”

“I certainly can’t just blow a few hours every week chewing the cud with my buddies\!” Jack said. “Maybe once I’ve had a good long life and am retired. But right now I have a wife and family at home. I have employees needing a consistent paycheck. Suppliers needing their money. Not to mention increasing loans to pay interest on\!” The words all tumbled out with more heat than Jack had anticipated. He took in a long breathe.

“I think you’re wrong. I think spending time in something like this is one of the best investments you could make,” the old man said calmly. “This isn’t about blowing time with your friends. These are all high-value men. Who have been places and seen things most people only dream of. Furthermore, we all started meeting long before retirement.”

“What’s your plan?” Jack asked.

“For the next five weeks, give me two hours once a week.” Jack looked away as the old man explained the plan. “Just meet with me every Thursday morning just like this morning. Watch the group, observe their habits, their conversations, their ideas and strategies. Once they all leave, let me tell you their stories. If after five weeks, you still don’t see the value in a group like this, so be it. That’s fine. You can continue doing what you’re doing.

“But I don’t think that’ll be the case. In fact, I fully expect by the end of five weeks, you’ll have started putting time and money into your own mastermind\!” He grinned.

Jack looked silently at his old mentor.

“Can you do that Jack? Is your business and your family worth it to you?”

The younger man thought for a moment. 

What other choice did he have?
