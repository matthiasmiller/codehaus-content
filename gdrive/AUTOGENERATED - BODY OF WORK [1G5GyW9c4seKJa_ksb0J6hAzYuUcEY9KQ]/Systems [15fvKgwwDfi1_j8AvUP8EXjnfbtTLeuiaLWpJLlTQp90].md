### Day 1: You Own the System

Welcome to your first day as a software executive—or maybe your thousandth. Either way, here’s the big shift: you’re not coding anymore. You’re not even just fixing bugs or tweaking features. Now, you’re running the whole show. Think of yourself as the boss of a giant tech empire—teams, projects, profits, all of it. That’s your system. And just like any system, it’s got parts that need to work together. Your job? Make sure they do.

Back when you were an engineer, you owned a piece of the puzzle. Maybe you wrote killer code for a login page or debugged a server crash in the middle of the night. That was your world—one function, one file, one win at a time. But now, you’re not in the weeds. You’re up high, looking at the full picture. You’re not tweaking a line of Python—you’re steering a machine that pumps out apps, makes money, and keeps customers happy. Every team, every sprint, every dollar spent? That’s on you.  
This isn’t about letting go of your tech roots. You’re still a coder at heart—someone who loves systems, logic, and making stuff work. But the system’s bigger now. It’s not just code. It’s people, goals, and deadlines. It’s the chaos of a late release and the thrill of a million new users. You’re not writing the app anymore—you’re the one who makes sure it gets built, shipped, and scales to the moon.

Here’s an analogy to lock this in: imagine you’re the architect of a cloud platform. Picture AWS or Google Cloud—a massive cluster of servers, buzzing with life. Every node in that cluster is a piece of your company. There’s a node for your dev team, cranking out features. Another for QA, testing every line. One for sales, pitching the app to big clients. And don’t forget ops, keeping the servers alive. Each node has its job, churning away, processing data, serving users. But if one node fails—say, dev misses a deadline or ops ignores a crash—the whole platform stumbles. Users leave, money dries up, and the empire shakes.

You’re not the one running each node anymore. You don’t log in to fix the crash yourself. You don’t write the test cases or close the sales. That’s what your teams are for—your engineers, your leads, your VPs. But you own the system. You decide how the nodes connect, how fast they run, and what they’re aiming for. You set the rules—how much CPU each team gets, how they share data, how they sync up. If dev builds a feature ops can’t handle, that’s your mess to spot. If sales promises something QA can’t test in time, you’re the one who sees it coming. You keep the platform humming, scaling, winning.

This shift can feel weird at first. You might miss the rush of a perfect commit or the quiet of a late-night debug session. That’s okay—those days shaped you. They taught you how systems tick, how a tiny bug can crash a server, how a smart fix can save the day. Now, you’re using that same brain to run a bigger game. Instead of debugging code, you’re debugging teams. Instead of scaling a database, you’re scaling a company. It’s the same logic, just a bigger playground.

So, what does this mean for you today? It means stepping back and seeing your world as one giant system. Your dev team isn’t just a bunch of coders—they’re a node pumping out features. Your product managers aren’t just planners—they’re a node setting the roadmap. Your budget isn’t just numbers—it’s the power supply keeping the lights on. Every piece matters, and you’re the one who makes them fit. You don’t micromanage the nodes—you don’t need to SSH into every server—but you watch the dashboard. You spot the red lights, the bottlenecks, the wins. And then you act.

Here’s your takeaway for Day 1: map your empire. Grab a piece of paper—or a whiteboard, or your phone—and sketch it out. Draw your system as a tech platform. List your teams—dev, ops, sales, whatever you’ve got. Add your projects—like that app launch or server upgrade. Throw in your goals—more users, bigger revenue, happier staff. Keep it simple, just boxes and lines. Then step back and look. Where’s it strong? Maybe dev’s killing it with fast sprints. Where’s it weak? Maybe ops is swamped, or sales is out of sync. Pick one part—one node—that needs a boost. That’s your focus for tomorrow.

This sketch isn’t busywork. It’s your first step to thinking like an executive. Coders fix functions. Leaders fix systems. You’ve spent years learning how to make tech work—now you’re making a company work. That app you used to build? It’s nothing compared to the empire you’re running now. Every team, every goal, every dollar—they’re your nodes. You own them. You connect them. You scale them.

That’s Day 1\. You’re not just an engineer anymore—you’re the architect of something huge. Tomorrow, we’ll dig into how what you feed this system decides what you get out of it. For now, draw that map. See your platform. Pick one piece to tune up. You’re in charge now—start acting like it.

### Day 2: Inputs Drive Your Big Win (Updated)

Yesterday, you mapped your company as a system—a cloud platform you run. You’re the architect now, not the coder. You spotted your teams, projects, and goals, and picked one piece to boost. That’s exec thinking. Today, here’s the one big idea: you control the inputs that drive your big win. Feed your system the right stuff, and you hit your target—whatever it is. Feed it junk, and you miss. You set those inputs—then let your teams make it happen.

Picture your company like an API call. You’ve used those: you send an input—like a user ID—to a function, and it gives you a result, like a profile. Send a good ID, and the output’s perfect—fast, useful, a win. Send junk—like a blank field—and it flops, no result. That’s your empire now. You’re not coding the API. You’re picking the inputs—the goals, resources, and priorities you give your teams. Pick the right ones, and you get your big win—more users, bigger deals, higher value. Pick the wrong ones, and you’re stuck.

You’re not in the weeds anymore. You don’t write code or chase details. You decide what your teams work with. That’s your power. Set a clear goal, and they deliver something huge—your target nailed. Set a fuzzy one, and they spin—no payoff. Give them enough resources, and they move fast—your win grows. Skimp on resources, and they stall—nothing happens. Point them at the right priorities, and they hit the bullseye—success lands. Point them wrong, and they miss—empty-handed. Those inputs—goals, resources, priorities—are what you control. You set them, and your big win follows.

It’s tech logic you get. An API needs a good input to work. Your company’s the same. A team spinning its wheels? Check your goal—is it sharp or mushy? A group lagging? Look at resources—are they solid or weak? A project drifting? See the priority—is it right or off? You’ve tuned functions before: a bad input breaks it; a good one delivers. Here, a bad input—like “do whatever”—breaks your shot at winning. You’re not running it or fixing it—that’s micromanaging, and you don’t do that. You pick the input, then step back. Your teams turn it into your victory.

Mess it up, and it stings. A vague goal is like a blank ID—nothing moves, no win. Too few resources is like a wrong type—everything stalls, target missed. A bad priority is like no input—work flops, goal’s gone. You’ve seen an API fail with dumb data. A dumb input fails your big plan. You’re the architect. You spot the junk, swap it for something solid, and keep your target in sight.

Your takeaway today: pick one input and tune it with your insight—then let go. Grab your empire map from yesterday. Find one piece that’s off—a team’s slow, a project’s stuck, a goal’s not landing. Ask: what’s my input here? Is the goal clear—or a mess? Are resources enough—or thin? Is the priority right—or wrong? Pick one to fix. Use your judgment—make it sharp, like a good ID that gets results. Maybe it’s a quick call, maybe it’s a deeper look—your time, your call. Then trust your team to deliver. No hovering. You’re steering, not coding.

That’s Day 2\. You control the inputs—goals, resources, priorities—that drive your big win. Tune them like an API, and your empire hits the mark. Tomorrow, we’ll shard those big goals into wins that scale.

### Day 3: Shard Your Vision

On Day 1, you mapped your company as a system—a cloud platform you run. You’re the architect now, not the coder. On Day 2, you saw how your inputs—goals, resources, priorities—drive your big win, whatever that is for you: users, deals, value. Today, here’s the one big idea: break big goals into pieces to hit your big win. Shard them like a tech system, and your empire scales. Keep them huge and vague, and they flop. You split the vision—then let your teams nail it.  
Think of your company like a database under load. You’ve seen those: one giant table with a million rows, trying to handle every query at once. It’s slow, clunky, crashes hard—users bail, no win. Now shard it—split that table into smaller chunks, spread across servers. Each piece handles its own load—queries fly, results land, success scales. That’s your job now. You’re not coding the database. You’re sharding the goals—the big, hairy visions you’ve got—like “own the market” or “double our size.” Break them into chunks, and your teams turn them into wins.  
You don’t chase details or write the plans anymore. You set the vision and split it up. That’s your power. Take a huge goal—like “grow huge this year”—and it’s a mess; no one knows where to start, nothing moves. Shard it into pieces—like “launch a key feature,” “land five big clients,” “boost system speed”—and your teams can grab them. Dev takes the feature, sales hits the clients, ops speeds it up. Each piece is clear, doable, aimed at your win. You don’t run every shard—that’s micromanaging, and you’re past that. You break the goal, then step back. Your teams scale it into success.

It’s tech logic you know. A database needs sharding to handle scale. Your company’s the same. A team stuck on “be the best”? Shard it—give them “cut load time” or “add a top feature”—and they deliver fast. A group spinning on “grow big”? Break it—“hire two stars” or “target a key segment”—and they move. A project drifting on “win more”? Split it—“ship by June” or “boost uptime”—and it lands. You’ve sharded tables before: one big mess fails; small chunks win. Here, a big goal—like “do everything”—fails your big plan. You’re the architect. You split it smart, and the win grows.  
Leave it unsharded, and it tanks. A giant goal—like “dominate all”—is like one fat table: too heavy, it crashes, no progress. Teams stall—dev builds junk, sales chases ghosts, ops spins out—your target slips. A vague vision—like “scale up”—is like no shards: chaos, no focus, win’s gone. You’ve seen a database choke under load. An unsharded goal chokes your empire. You’re the one who sees it, breaks it down, and keeps the pieces humming.  
Your takeaway today: pick one big goal and shard it with your insight—then let go. Grab your empire map from yesterday. Find one goal that’s too huge—like “grow fast” or “beat everyone”—something not hitting your win. Ask: how can I break this? Split it into three pieces—clear chunks your teams can own. Maybe it’s “launch a core update,” “sign a top deal,” “fix a key bottleneck”—whatever fits your target. Use your judgment—maybe it’s a quick split, maybe it takes a meeting—your call. Then hand them out—tell your leads, set the pieces. Trust your team to deliver. No hovering. You’re steering, not sharding the code.  
That’s Day 3\. You break big goals into pieces—shard them—to hit your big win. Split them like a database, and your empire scales. Tomorrow, we’ll cut the noise that slows your win.

### Day 4: Cut the Noise (Updated with “System Blueprint”)

On Day 1, you mapped your company as a system—a cloud platform you run. You’re the architect now, not the coder. On Day 2, you tuned inputs to drive your big win—users, deals, value, whatever your target is. On Day 3, you sharded big goals into pieces to scale that win. Today, here’s the one big idea: cut the noise that slows your big win. Strip away the junk—useless chatter, extra steps—and your system runs smoother. Leave it loud, and it drags. You clear the static—then let your teams hit the mark.

Think of your company like a server under load. You’ve seen those: a clean machine hums—requests zip through, results pop out fast, your win lands. But pile on noise—random pings, pointless logs, junk traffic—and it bogs down. Requests stall, users bounce, nothing works. That’s your job now. You’re not coding the server. You’re cutting the noise—the clutter that jams your teams, like too many meetings or vague updates. Trim it, and your system flies—your big win comes faster.

You don’t chase details or run the show anymore. You spot the noise and kill it. That’s your power. Too many emails—updates flying everywhere—and teams miss the real goal; your win slips. Too many meetings—hours of babble—and focus dies; nothing gets done. Too many side tasks—busywork piling up—and the main plan stalls; no payoff. Noise is anything that drowns your signal—your goals, your priorities. You don’t wade in and fix it—that’s micromanaging, and you’re above that. You cut it out, then step back. Your teams deliver the win.

It’s tech logic you know. A server needs clear requests to run. Your company’s the same. A team buried in chatter? Cut the noise—drop the fluff emails—and they lock on target. A group stuck in meetings? Slash them—free their time—and they move fast. A project clogged with extras? Trim the fat—focus the work—and it scales. You’ve cleared server logs before: too much junk slows it; a clean slate wins. Here, too much noise—like endless check-ins—slows your big plan. You’re the architect. You spot the clutter, ditch it, and keep the system sharp.

Leave the noise, and it bites. A flood of emails is like junk traffic—teams lose the signal, your win fades. Endless meetings are like bad pings—energy drains, no progress. Extra tasks are like bloated logs—work stalls, target’s missed. You’ve seen a server choke on noise. Noise chokes your system—delays stack up, focus blurs, your big win slips. You’re the one who sees it, cuts it, and keeps the goal in sight.

Your takeaway today: pick one noise and cut it with your insight—then let go. Grab your system blueprint from Day 1\. Find one spot where clutter’s slowing your win—a team swamped with updates, a project bogged in talks, a goal lost in extras. Ask: what’s the noise here? Is it too many messages—or not enough clarity? Too many huddles—or no focus? Too many side jobs—or a fuzzy plan? Pick one to trim. Use your judgment—maybe it’s killing a daily standup, maybe it’s clearing a busywork task—your call. Make it quiet, like a clean server that runs fast. Then trust your team to deliver. No hovering. You’re steering, not debugging.

That’s Day 4\. You cut the noise—clutter, chatter, extras—that slows your big win. Clear it like a server, and your system hits the mark. Tomorrow, we’ll lock the truth that keeps your win on track.

Okay, so what did it take some time because Ricky asked me a question about why he asked the question, why is can a small website not keep up with volume of streaming video, but YouTube can't. And why is it so expensive that it would take millions of dollars to scale up? And well, well, while I don't have the exact, full, in depth reason in a way that I think I can articulate.

# Pair Programming

TODO

here's another interesting way to look at it. If you look at the evolution of software, and the evolution of language, then. Then you have the postcards and then the assembly language and it's like, well, let's do complicated. Let's make shorthand for that. And then that ultimately everything was predominantly linear.

And so somebody's said, Okay, well, instead of like, let's not make this completely linear, let's say, We're gonna let you say go to what I mean. Maybe this is from the beginning, go to Step four, and repeat. Okay, well, that's good. That's really complicated. Like, like, how do I keep that in my head? And so then it's like okay, well, we're gonna put names to this go to the part that's named you know, you know, show error on the screen and then the let's go on the you know, let's let's and then when it's done then it can go it can tactic does to go to somewhere else. And so we don't actually had to know the actual location, we can just refer to it by name, and then it's really easy. And then finally said, Okay, well, this is good, but we have to pass information back and forth. And so, in order to do that, we need to have something called parameters. In other words, there's certain types of input and certain types of output that these these things can have and and how do we, how do we define those? How do those get passed, passed around? And then we started creating a convention for that. And then they said, Well, it's actually not quite that simple because now you have two versions that are worked together and, and how do those things tie together? Well, you have something called the class or the class to share some information. And, and oh, by the way, there are some design patterns that are really important when you're working with classes which is which is, you know, you can have I mean, for example, well, first of all, there are some design patterns, resources that are really important.

For example, there are some contracts that you're going to keep. In other words, I'm only going to ask you to do this under this, these situations, I'm going to only only going to tell you a certain subset of things and then and then when you're done like you promised that the world will be in this kind of a state when you're done. And the same with classes like this class is responsible for a conceptual conceptual part of the part of the process. Now, this this concept has been in it in the you know, in software development from for a very long time, even before was called this, where it's like, well, what what is the class what classes is often represents some kind of thing. So sometimes it's an abstract thing and sometimes it's a more tangible thing. So for example, your you want to start working with a file on disk, there's a series of operations that need to happen in order for you to do that you need to let the operating system know that you want to open the file you want to tell it what to do as a file doesn't exist and you need to know what what you're planning on doing doing with the file so you don't accidentally do the wrong thing with it. So you can keep yourself from shooting yourself in the foot and then once you do that, then you need to tell what part of the file you want to go to. And then once you're in the right part of the file, then you need to know you need to decide what you're going to either read or what you're going to write or if you do both and then you need to tell it that okay, I'm done doing whatever I need to do the final week

I'm done with that I'm not going to be doing anything with it and then it closes don't have access to it and and that gives the operating system a chance to go write these things to death so that your information doesn't get lost and and it helps your your operating system manage resources because now because even though it's a small amount it takes there's some bandwidth for it to to be able to keep track of your file and the changes that you're making. And then once you've got that then what's the next piece well, okay, so, so then these are the types of things that you can you can use you can make it read only you can you can look at certain physical piece of information you can query it find out when it was last modified and these are all parts of accessing files, well, oh, look at all these functions that do the same thing. And they're all interconnected and interrelated. Well, this is actually, you know, conceptually. This is a this is a class. And so we're going to create a class called a file that has all of these functions that it can have. Now, how does this actually relate with business? Well, first of all, there's all kinds of interesting things that the that the that are going on under the hood when you're working with the file, but you don't actually need to know when you're working with a file. Like you don't really need to know this information, but it's happening under the hood. So what does the class do? A class helps to hide that information from you so that when you ultimately when you want to work with the firewall, you need to know you need to know the file name, you need to know some things about what you're gonna be doing. And then you need to perform the actual actions. And so here's one of the lessons that we extract from from business is that sometimes there's groups of activities that you're doing together that logically belong to each other. And, and, and you want them to be to be interconnected with each other. And because of that, you can well, and so you can put them all under one roof and and when somebody wants to go and the way that you manage complexity is you look at the points of communication so how do you get at the point of intimate communication? Well, you only share the information that needs to be shared, you try to reduce the number of people that it needs to be shared with. And when you do that, you isolate and eliminate complexity. So you might have a sales department that's really complicated. We have a marketing department that's extremely complicated. And there's all these folks talking to each other. But what you do is you have you haven't you have parts within any part of the business talks as much as it needs to with with other people, but when you try to limit it to a single point of contact, you dramatically reduce reduce complexity. What does this also mean? Well, systems and processes are much more than just step by step instructions. It's about finding the natural order and the natural structure that is that is emerging from within the organization. So now there are some patterns that we have. Well, there's, there's there's some other issues too, which is it's centered around scalability like how do you how do you skill software? Well, at some point, you need to have a you need to have one source of truth for your information like you can't have you can't have to two people out there with with the same name and same social security number and different phone numbers because, well, then what what are they like which number is correct? And so let's say that you have a massive amount of storage and massive amount of information that you're dealing with and you need to synchronize this information across multiple people that are that are wanting to use it how? Well one of the ways that you do is one of the things you can do is you say okay, well, it's perfectly appropriate, appropriate to have somewhat stale information. So sometimes on a news website, just the act of saying that somebody is going to have one second still news, or that somebody's watching a streaming video that's one or two seconds delayed, introduces enough delay and enough of a capacity that it allows the to steer the burden and and speed it up so in other words,

so why, why is this? When you have only one source of information, that's the source of truth, then you have two dozen people that are going to this one person, and this one person gets overloaded because they only have so much bandwidth. So when the same people then you say, Well, no, that doesn't make sense. So so in the in the case of software, instead of just having one computer to go to, we're gonna have that one computer still gonna be the source of truth, but it's going to share its information with six computers. And each of those six computers will have a copy of the information that's been delayed. And so every second it's refreshing it to get the to get the latest to get the latest information. And and then and then instead of, you know 15 People going to, to 18 people to the first person you now have whatever the numbers are you got you know just a handful of people going to each one so suddenly you've multiplied your capacity because you've introduced some kind of a delay. Now, what does this mean in business? Well in business, sometimes you may have something that is the source of truth like a city or county. And, you know, maybe this is less true in a digital context. But it may be true in a you know, from a procedural standpoint, so there is a master procedure list that gets handed down to from department to department and, and because there's a delay then we're able to allow the  
then then people can go ahead and instead of asking just one person and bombarding one person with all of these questions, they're actually able to go to multiple people and there's multiple sources of information for this now what's the problem with this in any kind of software environment? Well, one of the problems is, is that what happens when you have three copies of this information and, and the source of truth changes so, so three computers have memorized my contact information and it changed the actual contact information? How do they know to update? Well, there's a few ways that they can do this one, you can say, well, we just do this automatically every second. So if you catch it within a second, then you're gonna get stale information. What does this mean in an organization? You could, it may just mean that it takes time to roll out changes and whenever these changes get rolled out, and people get notified, and if you're okay with a delay, you're fine. Now what's another way to do it? Well, you can have a you could have a quick check in that basically says, Hey, I'm here with this information, is it is it still up to date? And if it was, then you then you go, or good? Or you could say, Well, every time we get this information, we're gonna go see if it's is this out of date and if it is, then we're gonna go fetch it ourselves and replace it. So there's, there's a number of ways that you could actually deal with this issue. Or you can have, you know, whatever, when, or you can have this proactive or you can have a proactive state where, where this is when when something is out of date, then it gets pushed down to let it get gets, that actually gets pushed out. Alright, you're gonna have a hybrid approach, which is like, okay, there's a new policy. Now we're going to go to, we're gonna go yank that policy out of the binder and whenever you need a new one, you're gonna come back and you're gonna find a find a new one for us. And so that's how you deal with issues of scalability and how to how to prevent the duplication of information. Now, what you really want to avoid is you what you want. What you really want to avoid is you want to avoid duplication of mystery. You want to prevent the spread of misinformation. And the way that you prevent the spread of misinformation is that having only one source of true information. Now, what what are some other you know, what are some other parallels and equivalents? Well, another federal equivalent is there's something in suffering. There's something in the hardware side, which is short term memory, long term memory Well, what happens when you plug unplug your computer? Well, ideally, all that happens is up against goes down into anything that was open your programs and you know, unless you're like Mac and you Well, I mean, maybe Mac doesn't even do this, but it turned himself down. And as a result of that, you lose all the information that he had open in your progress, but the files on your hard drive are safe. Now. There's some some very specific timing situations where, especially in olden days, if you have power at the wrong time, then you might have a partially written file and you wouldn't and file wouldn't be valid if you might actually lose information on disk. But by and large, we solved that problem. And by the way, we now have batteries, which means that the loss of power is very unlikely, but nonetheless, computer has has a concept of short term memory versus long term memory. Well, what's the benefit of short term? Memory? The benefit of short term memory is that it's super super fast. In other words, like, I mean, if you're dealing with, you know, one of the fastest things, well, you know, as an example, when you have software you might have a million lines. The project that we worked on had upwards of a million lines of code. And, and because of the way this this stuff is interconnected, it was ended up processing. I don't know exact numbers, but maybe five or 10 million lines of code because of how again, how how those technical pieces of information happened through the reading this much information and enough to be a bottleneck, especially at the point that you had, that you had a valid you know, whatever your your CPU, your processor was fast enough, and then the slowdown would become reading all this information on this. Well, what's what's it analogous to? RAM is analogous to this is analogous to your short term memory and and written procedures are analogous to long term memory. So So why do you need them? Well, short term memory is good, because it's really fast that you can remember but the problem is that there can be blessing in your short term memory. And so that's when you need long term memory. Or you might close down the program and and somebody else might come up and, and show like log in and be like, Oh, so you know, the program might restart. What's that analogous to this? That's analogous to somebody else coming in and jumping into here in the process? Well, they might not actually know what's going on but so they need a long term memory so that they can load it into they can do it quickly. And then once it's, once it's, it's, it's it's like it gets replicated. So here's another theory of scalability. In other words, like  
the equivalent of caching is like, you have these, you have these written procedures and they get copied down into people's brains. And so what needs to happen is when these things get changed, you need to push them to people's brains, or people need to check in and that's really where the scalability analogy comes in. So that you need to transfer it to their their for short term, their long term memory. And this is called you know, this is a process called syncing. Now, no thinking is another issue, which is, at some point, you have to have an actual source of truth, like you can't just have some kind of false wish, which is what happens when you have one person that changes one thing and somebody else who changes another thing, how you reconcile those differences you need to know What's the content? What needs this was what needs to go in today? Again, what's the analogy here when you've got when you've got these procedures in, in somebody's head, they might actually start behaviorally doing something different that doesn't match what's actually documented and written down. And as a result of that, it introduces this disconnect between what's actually documented and how it's actually  
being executed. So, in that particular case,

with that particular case, what you need to do and on top of that, might actually have management making changes to these and thus meeting to creating multiple levels of difference where you can't just update so what you need to do is you need to take a look at and compare them. And by comparing them essentially what you do is you look for the differences. You figure out which difference resulted from changes by whom, and then you interleave those changes, and you make sure that the changes still create a coherent whole, which is basically the process that happens when talking about the process. We're not a code review process but in a conflict merge from a software standpoint, one of the ways that you do this is you  
either assign something as the source of truth,and you force people to do that, or you've got some of the processes of reconciliation and thinking and then the less real time, the thinking the greater the likelihood of changes. And then what happens when you've got multiple people trying to change the same process. And if you do both different ways, now you have a conundrum that requires human intervention because you need to actually look at how they're doing it differently specifically, and be able to reconcile those Okay. So, taking this a bit further you also have to understand that these things are divided in categorized in different ways. In other words, there's things all the way in the very basic granular structure which are called statements and then blocks and then functions and classes and modules and libraries and applications and even application suites. In other words, this whole design process is extremely fractal and Yeah relationships with between statements Groups. There's their responsibility if you're doing XY or z, if you very similar outside of that. The last thing you want to create is if you create a Swiss army knife, but if you create a dummy knife which should be at the core is this container that holds all of these isolated separate tools and if you have a tool that grows separately, and you if it evolves into it into a Swiss Army Knife without proper categorization, preferably a unifier then you just have this convoluted mess where it's like maybe it kind of works but there are some things that just need to be done. But there's, there's not always it becomes a series of tasks, which is a whole other form of programming. It's called scripting. In other words, there's these isolated things that need to be done isolated tasks. And just go do them. And we can support the environment, but they're not really, you know, they're critical for the for that they're not actually part of the they fall under, typically under kind of a different set of some rules. They can be shorter in the linear base doesn't always necessarily tie elegantly to emerging coal. So along with that, Kevin, one of the things you see with we were going to present is that procedures which are this one on pass, these are the essentially the scripts, the batch processes, that needs to be run, that supported progress that's going on, but then we also have the whole itself itself and how those actually functions. So there is another part of development which is, is the code review process, which means that you always have a second device, looking everything and trying to see because essentially what happens is there's balance transfer happening both directions. First of all, you have some risk. But then you also have feedback on investing and have something with a fresh set of eyes. So that's one aspect of it, but it is something else that happens is an actual UA which, again, we're not stringent on this, but I wanted you to be able to have what I didn't execute at least once and then the more you can verify that these things are actually saying it actually gets recorded that everything's recorded. That needs to be reasonably reported. There are some additional pieces that I think it was going to tie into that. Getting is going to give me a moment to think about a little bit and see what else I came up with. Here is something interesting is usually what a piece of software is, it really comes down to a set of instructions organized in a logical coherent manner to interact with the outside world. Control the defined means with with an exchange of communication with an exchange and storage of information. So, people from the outside who are providing information, providing something there is a specific set of instructions of how to get that information or that information something useful there's a small black box of outside of what appears to be happening but there's actually so many layers beneath what actually is happening. And, you know, this is not not a dissimilar analogy. One of the challenges we face along with that is that ultimately what you want is a high level level. system the greater picture it's because of missteps. Decisions decision design process because you lose context. Or you have something that is actually designed in a different context and environment and conceptually, they say it's applicable. But it's actually not a result, you end up having to shoehorn it in you basically, introduce, you don't have control over changing. So that is analogous to, say a vendor or something particular vendor you're working with and you don't have the ability to change how they operate. You end up you know, the biology. Example is another way to remind me of the rule of three. I'll get back to that logical example if you form a callus or something around that. And you just let yourself in, but it's interesting, but sometimes you actually somebody processes me but what you need to do is be able to find a bit of that in a way that you can manage the complexity and again, isolate. You want to isolate whenever you can't isolate, isolate it as much as possible. Isolating, it means reducing, keeping it a very local impacts. See how much and there's this whole concept of the rule of three which is, well actually, there's also this concept of refactoring, which What does refactoring mean? Well, if you look at the total cost of ownership on a software project, its industry standards, they tend to represent the initial why is that? It's because it's actually apparently a static transaction is very, very dynamic space. being applied the speed of innovation it was 10 years ago, we're talking about was perfecting yourself we're talking about. or 15 years ago, when we were talking about was what to window which went from a static document based web to a you know, interactive web And now and now we're talking about what what we put out which is the centralized software. So suffers by, by nature, very dynamic, and as a result of that you have to invest in maintenance, or you're going to or you're going to lose a project and the cost of maintenance costs represent every year. Well, what does this actually how does this actually translate? If you really want to be really want to integrate processes effectively, you have to allow room to look yes, it will speed up your process. But you also have to allow to be able to go back and revisit it and edit it and make changes and revamp it and more than just tweaks and edits are times when you will have to restructure entire parts of it so that you can do so that you're gonna continue to adapt. Why is that because business is what type of business but the more static your business, the less you have to do that the more kinetic your business and the more vulnerable you are to moving parts outside of it. Then the more the more important. This is another another tool set in programming called refactoring. refactoring. Well, refactoring basically is let's actually start with three, three, the rule of three says that before you before you genericized something we should generally implemented about. Doing this you'll create this very quickly deals with what you idealize would happen but it's not actually grounded in reality so complicated. Because you don't really know what this is more. You can be useful it doesn't actually work. This is very common with people who are trying to build out a business process when they've actually built out the business. You want to build a high margin business on the front end. So you can actually have the room and space to build the process, because you want to do this repeatedly before and allow yourself the space to figure this and by the way, there's different skill sets. To innovating to this first number of iterations and finding the common patterns and systematizing it to keeping that machine going. And we're using so. So one of the things you want to do is say hey, this sounds a lot like this thing that we're doing over here. Like is this basically the same thing can be consolidated and they can't be consolidated the same process one of the process, really in other words, basically what you have when you did this, to make sure that you repeat this over here as well, and the other places oh, by the way, it could be this place. By doing that, you can make sure that things that are very similar and we're pretty similar, but slightly differently. Confusion of trying to create something that works for both substantially different but substantially similar types of procedures, make sure that we can make changes to one you think, the application. Now, there's also these questions about what makes a good development environment and what are the things that makes your development environment that makes it really easy to find connections and find the things that you're looking for. And in any, any type of situation like minimize the amount of time that actually spent looking for things. Make it as easy as possible actually. A few things one is a good system for organization. Insert search for your seats and we're not going to wait and really, really want to know about you prize So there's another very common design pattern that you see which is a tree structure. One of the reasons why choose structures are helpful and relevant is that they represent the fractal nature of things. Which really is not unlike an org chart. It's not unlike many of the things that you might have. I don't really know how this actually plays into an organization. But one of the things that does is well, one of the things that it does is it really gives you a way to, to versus a list we're list is a linear set of things. It does allow you to easily segment you know, another way of representing the tree structure, so to speak, it does mean that you can, like if you imagine, wall surfaces all the leaves and if your circles subset any number of related issue and related pieces based on based on the level of specificity, for example, you might say, there's this one here, that is related to like, here's his script. I want to see where, what might be impacted by changes to this task. And so, you look at things that are closely somewhat related to the less closely less closely less for free and go expanding after concentric circles. We're able to identify where potential leads, there's a good chance to serve some kind of practical method. It's not immediately apparent, but it's something worth considering. it's if you take a software system and rewrite it completely from scratch, it's often means depth to the project. And the reason is that there are small pieces of detail that have significant impact and ramifications. So, there may have been this one scenario sample of scenarios where something went sideways a series of small fixes to prevent that problem with doing things is that there are certain nuances in in that so because it appears to be in detail, you may underestimate the action together. mitigate that as much as possible to mitigate this by mutations. Document. Fixing by doing things a certain way, and then being a fantastic array of data. Managing versus waiting, simply don't understand perhaps not in the Maybe it's not important for the people who are actually going through that but they need to consider why they bug fixes are part of the process, and bug fixes, I don't just mean intelligence mean correct ways to fix problems with systematically. So now there's this there's this final piece, which is probably one of the greatest skills that comes from position which is managing work maximum. And, again, different different developers will focus on different things. So if you have a certain type of you have to understand that certain types of software features, temporary levels of the printer cracy. If you have the software that's where accuracy or performance or timeliness accuracy are not a major issue, then quality of rebate actually be more important, but when you have situations where we have situations where accuracy actually does matter substantially. That's where attention and care for detail are more important. So again, very pragmatically when it comes to building out these processes in detail for you, to place the things that require precision and allow other people to allow other people to do the things so with that, in everything there is this drive for pragmatic pragmatic benefit was actually usually one thing, surely, as a result, we build a machine that doesn't actually have to worry. There's other people who do that. So it's like hierarchy. So what's your engine is a system so if you if you systems are like yours, and if you have a low amount of momentum in a vehicle, hear I hear all the distractions, like we're just going to give one away and you're going to look here and you're going quickly, or you're going to max out Europeans and that's the scenario worst case scenario. You really want to start later. So how do you do that? I think it's always a work in progress. This is supposed to serve you and make your life easier, not harder to start with the pieces that are most difficult or that person can most easily be offloaded or delegated. So that's that and then, then there's this process of how do you actually break this down? I think one of the easiest ways to do this sort of process of tactical delegation, which means any number of ways you can do this. So ultimately, what you want to do is you need to have you need to have some kind of recorded storage in some format or another, it can be taxed, can be written or it can be spoken for TV video. And the it is a trade off between speed of changing Egypt changing it and updating small parts of it, versus Ease of Doing it the first time. Usually it's more work to get it to the first time in a way that allows you to easily get the feature. So it's a trade off. But then there's also this secondary issue that different people have different preferred means of communication. So some people prefer to live on the fly and some people prefer recorded so you might have live spoken and so simply what you would you can do there if somebody has like spoke smoking, there's a few things you can do. Easiest thing is just to record it and have it transcribed using something like otter. You might have something to utilize written, which may come down to have a chat or text message or email, exchange. You know, may end up being heavyweight and then using that kashrut and restructuring it and reformat it or you may have some leakage occurs live demonstrations. Again, video can be a great way of doing this for feedback, watching them do it practices or doing it yourself can be amazing. What you're looking for, is you want to translate from a live environment into a recorded environment, that it can get translated back into a live environment accurately. So keeping in mind that there's these three primary modes of communication, learning and modeling appropriately, and you'll find that in different types of roles that you'll have proclivities in one direction or the other based on first so for example, if you are in some form of manufacturing things for your Etsy shop, those types of people may be more inclined to learn by watching collections. And by doing so, you've built your training process. And you may actually want to have some kind of mean, here's a simple example. You may actually want to have a physical board that has pictures of the tasks with a QR code that allows you to pull in specific details for that particular class. Or you may actually have a print out a series of books that's once you freak. out people who are some people who again this this, some people may prefer flowcharts more of a step by step instructions of what to do this, this, this and this. And then, you know, this is my personal preference because of the ease and simplicity of the tool set. Simply allowing yourself to complete the inspection. Putting in big categories of steps. It's very easy to read into, style Here's another really interesting correlation when you consider low level versus measurable languages. Because I think low level languages can be roughly equivalent to unskilled labor, which means that you can I mean, theoretically you can take anything and you can break it down in a unskilled level. But if you were to write let's say in assembly language, it would be surgery ridiculously complicated, but it will prove to be useless. Now that's extreme, but with higher level languages, higher level levels of abstraction, a lot means that there is some kinds of free understood ideas like that, that allow you to get things done. So what you want to do is you want to tailor the instructions that you have or the level of knowledge that you expect to have so. By and large, your lower level tasks will include a much higher level of detail because yet people will text you. The other responsibilities for your procedures for a marketing director, for example, will be higher level, things that you might actually put in information about or hear the things that need to be done. Specifically, by as part of this, we're just understanding that, you know, high level languages allow you to say a lot of words or skill your team member that you're listening with more you'll be able to do that. So just tailored appropriately. Again, there's two things that you're looking to do. One is to unpredictability because people are and the other thing is to be able to let them go on vacation and somebody else cover for them for people. So instructions are certainly fighting. Argument, vacation you don't really have more than just the basic are going to respond. So those types of responsibilities, if they reasonably can be outside their role, and listen to us more specific language work, and more perversely to work versus high level conversations

# System Optimization

●      https://otter.ai/u/xdaKpaxySCQp631H2NnKZUEZNB4?f=home

I had this realization after hearing Stephanie talking about the theory of constraints. And related works, which is there's a process of there's a tree structure process hierarchical process in optimization, which means in software optimization, so, for example, when you go the first step of any kind of optimization issue is find the worst case scenario first of all, and how do you exaggerate the problem? So, in software, it's like, go throw the biggest data set at it or the biggest, you know, fill in the blank where if it's really the resource contention, go constraint, the problematic resources. So have you know, do something that brings it to the surface and then and then the question is, once you have that, then you do the analysis. Now the cool thing is, with software, you have a call stack, which is essentially a hierarchical view of where the bottleneck is. And so what so you start at a high level? View really clear when you say what's taking a long time. But at a high level, you say, how much time is this? What are the big portions of and how long does each big person take? And then you dive down into into those portions. And it could be that what initially appears to take a really long time is actually quite well optimized. It's just takes a long time. And then you look for you may go into going down a different branch, and diagnosing other further process, you might find that in that part of the process, there's a piece of it that takes an inordinate amount of time that is hyper inefficient, and you can fine tune that. And then as a result of that, you get, you know, marginal benefit. Now, the other thing you might discover along the way is that your algorithm is wrong, which means that your fundamental approach is misaligned. So, what are ways that you can eliminate that? Well, there's a few ways that you can do that. One is you can do more things simultaneously. And so you can introduce multi threading, or some kind of multiprocess thing. You can do more of the similar things at the same time. Or you can try to deal with you can try to cache there's more information in memory at a time. You can, you can and sometimes there's a spirit of faster ways of solving problems. Or a you know, sometimes instead of a highly accurate calculation, you can find a way to get an approximation that's actually accurate enough which you want to do. But it's much less expensive to speculate. It's really hard to tell, I guess, here's the question. You know, typically, when you profiled there's there's two pieces of the puzzle one is what percentage of time does this take of the parent task? And what percentage of time does it take your real task? And so if you search everything, based on time will be a real task and very quickly, you start to notice exactly where the bottleneck is. And that's the thing that you want to optimize first. Usually. So there's two steps to this. There's the profiling process, which is basically give me the data in a hierarchical format, sorted in or appropriate way so that we can actually filter these things to the top of the list, and we know how to address it, then there's the question of how do you actually optimize, optimize it? And you know, I don't really know that I've got much more to add to any of this. So the question then becomes, you know, the interesting thing about this is that this is actually the approach that I've used for the time study, which is, let me profile your time. And, and, really the there's two helpful pieces of it first is you actually have a grid or a framework and some level of categorization, some kind of tree structure to outline your time and I think it could actually be productive to convert this from a grid

to a to a tree structure, where on any given task, you can break down deeper, the deeper levels of the tree structure I'm not completely sure how that might work. But there is this profiling data collection. The way profiling works, is really not that dissimilar from the 15 minute time log, which is, you know, sampling. Let's go see what we're doing periodically. And let's just get a sense off of that what I'm doing is a different approach. Which is less accurate, but still accurate enough to get significant wins from. And then there's the the analysis, which is basically Okay, let's sort these things based on their level of impact and there's two resources being measured. There's opportunity cost, and there's actual time spent to the other cost. So we sort of based on those resources, and that's what drives the priorities that would actually optimize.

Yeah, so there you go. There's this really interesting take on business optimization, which can be taught but feels actually pretty instinctive. To me, and I don't know exactly how to quantify it in the example of dealing with dismissal last night, at the Vacation Bible School is a good example where we are creating distinct separate points of communication between different people, and by doing so, eliminating a lot of complexity and chaos. Because we were able to do that. So there you go. interesting observations about the recommendation and business process optimization

# Systems \- Threading \- Shared Resources

[https://otter.ai/u/mBJqk3qcHAfmPvEiBLN-cj99-gw?f=home](https://otter.ai/u/mBJqk3qcHAfmPvEiBLN-cj99-gw?f=home)

that's working. All right, here's another angle of this whole thing. multi threading mutexes shared data locks, race conditions, etc. So when you just a few observations that when you've got a lot of people working in the same type of environment and working on the same types of things that they need to coordinate things so that they don't, don't conflict on shared resources. And this can create a constraint because not only does the shared resource create the problem, create a bottleneck, but the actual act of checking for the shared resource makes it a bottleneck. Let me give you a practical example. Let's say that you've got one truck for two guys. It's not just the fact that only one guy can be on the road at a time. It's the fact that each guy has to check to see whether the other guy is using the truck before he can actually use the truck. Now in a digital world, if you're using something like Excel spreadsheets, for example, you have the same type of resource contention is what it's called. You have one person who wants to use the Excel spreadsheet and the other person doesn't now you can just try to open the Excel spreadsheet and that might be good enough but even the, you know, even the fact that you might not be able to open the Excel document creates introduces delay because you know, you're already Planning for Contingencies of what if I'm actually not able to or if it doesn't, completely throws those off sideways, what you're trying to do. mutexes are basically a way just say, okay, here are the parameters around you know, here, here are the parameters. You know, you can simplify this by creating parameters around how often or when you actually do try to access the shared resource. Now, sometimes you can engineer your shared resource in such a way that there's only one person responsible for actually managing and updating the shared resource. And because they have limited bandwidth. There's the it's a simple matter of sequencing in order so for, for example, in the vehicle example that I gave, the equivalent would be to have is to have a dispatcher where they make multiple requests. And whatever whatever form or mechanism that they want to prioritize it by whether it's by first come first serve, or whether it's by other types of prioritization. They can manage access to the shared resource and then ultimately, you know, there's a final final piece of this, which is there's a waiting that necessarily comes when you have a shared resource and so while you might engage with other with other types of sorry, what other types of activities you still The challenge is that, you know, when you when you've got multiple threads, you can very easily just tell them to wait until the shared resources available, but that's from a human perspective. That's horribly inefficient. And so, ultimately what you have to do is do this from a systems perspective. So you've got your notification or something like that that occurs when something becomes available.

Call Waiting hold. These are types of examples of managing asynchronous communication because you've got a shared resource, ie either a person or a phone line. And you can either wait until the resources available or get a call back. I mean, this is I guess along with that, there's synchronous waiting and asynchronous waiting, has in literally, this is called a callback. And when a great example, again is customer service, when are you going to wait, wait, well, actually, there's three types. Three ways to do this. One is I'm going to there's synchronous waiting. There's event driven notifications, and then there's polling polling just means I'm gonna check check, check, check, check until it's done. Now. The problem with that? Well, and along with that, there's also timeout typically with the with any type of waiting, perhaps not with event. Driven but so you have

to let's say that you've got a project that is an email that you send, and you don't get a response. Well, clearly, it's not a logical approach to simply wait until you get a response. So that means that you are either waiting for an event driven or pulling, pulling type of response. With this, there's also the concept of timeout. So let's say that you pull, which means that you periodically check back in and say, Hey, did I get an email? And if not, you might actually ping them and say, Hey, can I have an answer? To my email and you continue this event driven? You simply wait for the response to come back. And in the example of Google, it comes back to you after two days or three days, and you haven't gotten a response. So this guarantees some kind of timeout on the responses to your email messages. The same thing applies to so this is one of the ways that you prevent system failure, or that you protect against it. because the question is, how do you protect against things when they go completely dark? Well, you need contingencies for that. So what happens when.

What happens when somebody is on hold for 10 minutes, and I didn't know they didn't just. stranded you ring them back into the main queue and you prioritize them to the tops of Cubans and it rings again

you talk to somebody who's more likely to be available and says hey answer this call

# Systems Refactoring

●  	https://otter.ai/u/BHGGXshHWLoKr0FgqbMmVGDcGms

So here's another fascinating take on coding in business because refactoring is natural part of the process. When, when is what makes refactoring be necessary? Well, it's the process of flows to change requirements change direction. It's like it's a continuous self healing process. And it's absolutely critical to continue doing refactoring to make the codebase as flexible and as nimble as and useful as possible. And if you do not refactor that you end up with something that's brittle, which means that they'll try to make a change and all these other things will break because because of it, so what do you do in the process of refactoring? Well, you look for commonalities you look for things that have not been updated in a long time. He looked for things that should be simplified. To tease apart things that have kind of, you know, this thing used to be one thing and it grew into three things and now you split apart the three things. You You You move Part A that has been under this umbrella you remove you know, sometimes you completely redefined how something is done, and you transition out of that way in the old into the new way and, and you delete old code that is no longer necessary because of because of all those changes in requirements. So in business, it's like, it's moving people from one place to another department, it's building out departments, inspiring people, it's rearranging things, it's ultimately rearranging the components of the business to align where the business has grown to splitting apart responsibilities. People were doing too many things at a time. And creating and, and reorganizing and restructuring that and getting the business into a healthier, maintainable place. And if you don't do this, your business is gonna break one way or the other. Business is always code tends to break when you have refactoring. You have to do testing, you have to be careful and you have to take these things piece by piece, but if you don't do it, that will take a different way, which means you're going to hit a some kind of growth plateau. And the same is true in business where if you don't take the time to refactor your business, you don't you don't take time to restructure and reorganize and get things off of people's brains and split decisions and to and all of those things. Then, you're going to encounter a different type of breakage which is simply like your business will become brittle and it will become resistant to growth. And you won't be able to lower and make those types of changes that you need to so interesting perspective on refactoring as well.

# Context Switches

[https://otter.ai/u/bfNZW9qc49o\_d6iVnnz5uI1Qocg?f=home](https://otter.ai/u/bfNZW9qc49o_d6iVnnz5uI1Qocg?f=home)

So one of the things that's really interesting to take a look at is this whole thing of context switching. ie, what happens when you are able to when you don't need a context switch and you're able to actually stay in one place, there's an efficiency gain. So how many different contexts is somebody required to operate it? How many different types of roles are they required? What how many different modalities are they required? If you can reduce those modalities down to the ones in which they're most efficient And certainly if you can eliminate the context switching. You you'll have an immediate gain now. You don't want to reduce context switches into over into a less efficient or less ideal scenario. This is another systems training.

## Feedback Loops, Part 2

[https://otter.ai/u/oczh53XUdlwHpVL5oBqUe5oO268](https://otter.ai/u/oczh53XUdlwHpVL5oBqUe5oO268)

Not every accountability structure in business is a feedback loop. So if you're starting with tactical delegation, tactical delegation by itself is a tight feedback loop where somebody else watches you, you know, if you wanted to go that way, pause, do model, then somebody watches you do it. And it's a really tight feedback loop, then you loosen it up and you watch them do it. And then you loosen it up and you go look at the results of what they produce. And then you loosen it up and you start monitoring the outcomes and you loosen it up and you start evaluating more and more. And then as as you go up your chart and further tree, you're, you've got greater cycles, feedback loops based on the reliability and the predictability of the system. So the less reliable a system is, the tighter feedback loops, you gotta have to automatically error Correct. Or if it's of low consequence, if it goes rogue or sideways, then you don't need a tight feedback loop. You can just let it go. You know, go where it wishes. The issue with you look at this as a sliding scale. So for example, if you have somebody who is rogue then you need to tighten the feedback loop. If they make a mistake, then you just need to implement a feedback loop. And if you're a micromanager and they're actually more reliable than what you think then you need to loosen up the feedback loop or expand it and, you know, allow more space and distance if it's actually dialed in and working and so understanding that from a concept of scalability and from a concept of delegation, layers of workshop is is a really helpful perspective of how to apply feedback loops in the business. And so the same thing happens with marketing tests. If you're doing a wild off the wall test, then you need tight feedback loops to make sure that it's actually working and if you're, if you're doing shore shot tests, then you can loosen it up. So maybe maybe you're tweaking though the 1% or something and you can you know, maybe maybe it takes less taken to close on that. Or, for example, you're testing a new product and you need really, really tight feedback loops. And that's why you encourage people to actually talk directly with customers. But then if you as it scales, then you can use looser feedback loops and you can put entire sales teams in place. And that's why, you know, that's why you don't want to mismatch, the scalability with the certainty so if you have a highly uncertain thing, you don't want to scale it because it it creates distance in the feedback loop and it creates a wild variance. Now, another observation, which I need to take take to heart is that any place where you see variance is a place where there's not reliability and predictability where there's not a process where and that's where you need feedback loops and you need to you not not only need feedback loops, you need systems and processes to implement and build those feedback loops. And there you go. That's it.

## Firmware

You have think about firmware, and the things that get flashed on firmware, and if it gets interrupted, you’re in trouble – just like what Stephanie was saying about the 67-day habits

# Debugging

https://otter.ai/u/ZQjVahwr2GfLlwDjJbkPJoiWmtA?f=home  
An interesting perspective. The. When this came from starting to read the six month fix that was recommended by Tim Francis. You have a, you know, what are the rules of business? Well, the fundamental rule of business is you have to make money like this is the most practical irreducible rule of business. And there's 1,000,001 ways to do this. But if you violate this rule, well actually, that's not exactly true. In business, you have to have cash. And that's a rule you cannot violate. And if you violate it, that is the equivalent of an out of memory error or out of disk error or an exception. Crash. It's the end of the software running there's nothing more that can be done and that's the red line. Now normally, unless you're a venture startup, then you need something that produces profit, something highly profitable. For most freelancers, that's, you know, there's 1,000,001 ways to go about this.  
And various ranges of certainty, but you need something that generates a profit this is one of the feedback loops that you want to optimize for.  
to be completely clear, this is not the only one you should be optimizing for him. Because if you make this be the only one then you're going to might as well go sell drugs in the street corner. But there are other rules such as that actually feed into this. But it's kind of like running a compiler. And the compiler says it says, does it work? You know, there's some very basic does it work kinds of rules. If it doesn't work, and you get your debugger out, and you start breaking down the process, and you say, where in the process does this problem actually exist?  
And if you can identify it where the problem exists. Think of your business as a subroutine. And first subroutine is marketing. How do you find people the second subroutine is sales How do you close business? Third subroutine is operations How do you fulfill on it for subroutine is referral and Ipsum Risa and if if, if the engine does not feed the engine free course so at this point, what you can do is you can start looking at where exactly is the problem, you can debug it. When you debug it, you can get call stack variables. You can say what exactly is what what is going on at this particular point in time. And effectively what you should think of it one one good way to think about it is as test driven development. And your goal is to maximize profitability in order to do create maximum benefit Yeah, so if you actually look at this from the standpoint of a compiler and pass pass fail results, then what follows from that is what does it take to actually build a compiler could you build a compiler for your business that looks at any given module, sub module and says, Is this thing functioning as it was intended to yes or no? And if yes, then everything is good. It is immediately an alert. It's the equivalent of a regression err, it's the equivalent of $1 Build error and requires immediate attention. Until this thing can be fully resolved. Follow up question and homework assignment is to literally implement something like this.  
We've got step one and two. We got some initial accounting steps in place, but we really need to take it to one more level

## Strategy Consulting through Process

* What's the throughput? for example of a local business where people are moving through, and what they are buying. These are the inputs. How do you position yourself so that main street works? But even main street is part of a bigger process, where the world is shifting to online? And how do you follow that?

## Profiling

Two types of profiling

Decoration (iirc) Sampling

This is like getting feedback from customers and employees. You just need some time slices.

# More Thoughts

So I thought of two more things for my computer science book. One is offline usage, and then there's one that correlates to that, which is syncing. And then there's all of the other things like hardware, like monitors and the pixels and the three parts that make up each pixels and the RGBs. And uh, then there's things like RAM and temporary storage, which I think I might have talked about. But then there's also things like peripherals, like imagine the old cereal ports versus the, um, the, the cat, you know, cat five, cat six. Uh, then there's the standardization of usb, but then the different fragmentation within USB of different types of usb. Um, and then there's a fact that software comes down to information, decision making and actions. Um, and it's, you're really, really what you're doing is, I mean, ultimately at some form, all commands are a form of information, but, um, you know, more direct versus less direct information. So if somebody says, 

You   
Know, go to the hospital, I mean, in some ways it is a form of information, although it is in the form of a command. Um, another way to look at it is that there are real time and there are active and passive commands. So your speed should be this speed or, well, I don't know that this really makes sense. I'm kind of grappling with it. But, um, almost like this, well, what should I be doing now? What should I be doing now? What about now? What about now? Now, now, um, so there's, that's maybe a proactive versus a reactive response to commands. Um, I don't know. There's commands that are triggered by time, so that's another one.   
Okay.

## TODO \- Declarative vs Imperative Languages

Expression-Oriented Languages / Functional Languages vs. imperative programming

I think one of the things that arose from that is like, well, what is actual software because there's two ways that people think about software. What is people think about software from a very technical standpoint? In other words, you have a there there kind of are two types of even programming programming languages that are very linear, very, very, you know, step by step, the whole thing is a step by step. And that's called functional programming. Now, there's another way of programming which is like it will and those functional instructions are the foundation of any programming like I mean, yes, there are other types of expressive languages, expression based languages that are more you know, whatever, but be that as it may, at the core of all language and even you know,

Once you understand tree structures, you understand the formation of life.

For example, life begins with two people who have sex to conceive, and the process of growth continues as a series of divisions. We see this on a macro scale, where God divides himself into man (first of all), and since he was incapable of reproduction, subdivides man into man/woman. ANd we see it in the nature and structure of familes.

And everywhere we go, we see this.

In language parsers, you have a root object, that then gets subdivided into smaller pieces.

You have that with countries.

EVERYTHING in business starts with LIFE \-- with something that is working. ANd it grows and feeds from there. So if you want to find out what is going on and what is working, go START WITH THAT. Then allow that to expand.

Then, find everywhere that you are investing effort where it's not bearing fruit, and cut it off\!\! (This is good personal insight and feedback for how to respond to work.)

I don't feel like this captures the half of the significance of this line of thinking \-- but understanding how organisms form and grow is a good illustration of business.

For example, it is not healthy for a girl to become pregnant before she is capable of emotionally and physically caring for that child. Many "entrepreneurial seizures" (as Gerber calls them) could effectively be called "entrepreneurial orgasms" \-- that start things that later need to be aborted. Some business leaders need birth control on their ideas\! 

And a baby / offhsoot is akin to an embryo that (in some sense) is a parasite off the other. And you need to understand that new offshoots will cause the mother to become nauseous / sick / tired. ANd that to continually have one offshoot after another is going to wear down the mother's health and may eventually become a risk.

And that if those offshoots / startups are not properly trained, they will become a disgrace. They need attention, or they will become bratty children  
And pruning is what is required (see above) to cut off the things that don't give life.

There is a major gap in women's view of business, and men's.

BTW, I could have a book on the concept, on markets, on business, etc. i.e. I could show this on a macro scale, as well as a very micro scale.

Even the framework that Tim Francis shared was an illustration of tree structure, and the dividing to create life. THere is a very specific order in which human organs form when a child is born.

The reason that the BMA ends up being abusive is that they discourage and stunt growth. It is like telling a child that their learning is complete, then punishing them if they try to learn anything else.

Also...

It is dysfunctional parenting to abandon a half-grown child for the sake of a one-night stand "grand idea" you have that will be the silver bullet for fixing your business. (This is NOT to say that businesses are children and shouldn't ever be abandoned.) However, if you imagine someone who has a five-year-old daughter, then pursues a lover for the sake of another daughter (abandoning the first one), you start to understand the depth of dysfunction that you experience in that space

Furthermoree...Talib says that creativity comes from unexpected interactions. This is what is happening when you have a sperm and an egg. They are bouncing around \-- it's unclear if they will meet \-- but they MIGHT and if they do, you have a fragile form of life that begins. If you want more kids you have more stirfry of ideas. If you want more adults, you better parent the ideas you've got. Etc etc

# Sales Call Reviews

When I was a software developer, we had an entire step in the development process that was devoted strictly to "code reviews". Whenever a developer made changes to the software, another developer (either a peer or a manager) would look over every part of that change. This happened long before anybody else got to use those changes.  
These reviews included two parts:  
\- Is it FUNCTIONALLY correct? i.e. is it accurate in what it does?  
\- Is it STYLISTICALLY correct? i.e. is it well-structured and well-written?  
In addition, each piece of feedback came with one of 3 levels of importance:  
\- This HAS to change.  
\- This SHOULD change.  
\- This COULD change.  
We often offered subjective feedback to each other, even if it might not have been wrong. It helped us to broaden our scope and skillset.  
What does this have to do with sales call reviews?  
Unlike software, you can't go back and redo parts of sales calls. :-)  However, I would like to start doing weekly sales call reviews for a bit.  
This simply means me going through your call recordings, listening, and making observations. I'm going to be looking for things that are going well and for things to consider for improvement.  
By nature, some of these comments are going to be subjective. I'm going to include them anyway, and I invite you to consider them and to disagree and push back. I'm very interested in dialog, because I think that's one of the ways we get better.  
I plan to be sending these out to you privately via email, starting today or tomorrow.  
If you've got any questions, let me know.  
Thanks for your patience as we get some of these management / coaching rhythms into play\!

# Small Steps to Quantum Leaps

# Small Steps to Quantum Leaps

## The Proven Innovation Framework That Moves You to Something You've Never Seen Without Recklessly Risking What You've Always Had

# Preface

Quite some time ago, I was working on a software project that had an unusually high level of complexity. I was only one of a handful of developers even capable of making the required changes--and all of them were too busy to take it on.

As I'd been working on the project, I began to recognize that I was repeating the same pattern as I was working through this intractable problem.

In the back of my mind, I realized that I'd been learning different important lessons on how to solve really difficult problems regarding innovation, change, and quantum leaps. I'd gotten stuck multiple times on this project, so I wanted to take more time to articulate the process, providing myself tools to keep the project moving along.

Most surprising to me was how deeply this pattern ran through my life. Looking back, I've consistently found myself on the scene of major transitions.  These examples include:

* Starting to work for a software development company just as they were moving to an entirely platform, a massive undertaking that involved deep technical changes as well as significant changes in development culture  
* Starting to work for a nonprofit only months before their first major leadership transition in 20 years, working alongside the leadership team through the transition  
* Joining a local economic development corporation just as they were starting a local tech initiative, the first of its kind within the state of Colorado

Each of these were major transitions that other people set in motion, not something that I specifically sought out.

These patterns played out not only in these significant seasons of life. They also played out in smaller, less dramatic changes and transitions on the scene.

I recognized that this same approach could be applied to other challenging problems, including complex organizational restructuring, restructuring a marketing strategy, migrating a company to adapt to industry changes, and even undergoing deep personal identity shifts.

Since then, I've continually returned to this framework to help me understand how to make strategic decisions in my business.

Before we unpack the toolset, let's lay some philosophical groundwork.

### Why All Systems Tend Towards Chaos

Almost every system ever designed started with simplicity. Do something logical given the current needs, then continue to adjust as the needs change.

Here's an example:

When you look at the road systems of today (especially in the older road systems), you'll notice that it followed a simple pattern: find the most efficient path from one town to another, accommodating for hills, mountains, valleys, rivers, and streams. Because of the available toolset, the simplest approach accommodated the path that was easiest to build, even if it was a longer, curvier, more roundabout path.

This was a great approach (and simple\!) in the beginning. When there were only a few communities and transportation methods were limited, it made sense to build it like this.

However, as more communities, towns, and cities began to spring up, people needed to adapt. In addition, they had additional tools available to them to build roads where they wanted them to go, not just where the landscape allowed.  
As this happened, the complexity began to increase. They began to build more roads, and the best roads were between the communities that needed the most connection with each other. Because the cost of changing these roads is cost-prohibitive, many cities and towns are not designed to handle this level of complexity.  
The same is true in business.  
When most businesses start out, they begin by gauging the market needs and offering a variety of services to a variety of people. This works while the business is small. However, as the business grows, this leads to an incredible amount of complexity and chaos in the business.  
In addition, many entrepreneurs have a notorious bent towards creating complexity. As they identify new opportunities and ideas, they continue adding to their existing business. They add product lines, but never remove old ones. They hire people, but rarely fire. They set up systems, but never remove them. They add customers, but not never let go of them.

With time, these things become increasingly complex and inefficient. It becomes time to simply. At times, it requires moving to a fundamentally new model.

Reality is continually evolving. Disruption happens when someone is willing to reexamine the issues and design a new system that models reality more accurately.

## All Complexity Started With Simplicity

Almost all complexity began with simplicity.  
This introduced a concept called the Network Effect, where each additional city added an exponential amount of complexity. (We'll talk later on how this applies to other problems.)  
This problem is exaggerated when you're working in  capital- and labor-intensive projects like road construction. The cost of changing or moving a road is extremely difficult, and if your area is expanding at a rapid rate, you never question your approach. You continue building roads just to keep up.

The point is this...

As the number of roads increased, the MODEL for placing those roads was no longer the best or most efficient model. To make matters worse, tight construction made it almost impossible to adapt even the busiest roads to increase capacity.

Herein lie a few of our first important lessons.

## Lesson 1: Complexity creeps up on you.

Complexity rarely comes knocking on your door. In fact, most times, it starts out with SIMPLICITY and as the situation continues to expand, all changes continue under the original paradigm.

Many people wake up TOO LATE. All of a sudden, they're surrounded by winding roads with severe traffic jams, and there's almost no way to reverse the situation.

## Lesson 2: Complexity is often a factor of incremental growth.

The more incremental the growth you experience, the more likely you'll encounter broken systems. This is more likely to happen with incremental growth.  
If someone walked into your office and told you, "You're going from a   
1milorganizationtoa  
1milorganizationtoa10mil organization tomorrow," you would immediately radically rethink your approach.  
However, if that happened over the span of 5-10 years, you'd be less likely to question the model of what's going on until it was seriously broken.  
Plateaus (or growth barriers) are actually your friend, because they demonstrate where you've failed to adapt to the new system required.

## Lesson 3: Solving complexity almost always requires rethinking the model.

Almost all complexity comes from a model that is broken. At one time, everything used to fit into a simplistic model. However, as times change or adapt, that model has remained fixed.

While you can incrementally ADAPT to a new model, you cannot merely TWEAK your model. You need to almost completely revamp how you think about the issue, and once you've done that, you can start implementing incremental change.

## Lesson 4: The most significant breakthroughs almost always require relinquishing effort and lowering noise.

The software project pushed me to make a shift away from effort to awareness. It was impossible to simply power through it. It required the creative space of problem solving.

The only way to address these issues was to stop exerting effort. It required me to rest. It required me to sometimes think of something different and unrelated. It required me to go on walks and bike rides.

It was a test of creative discipline, albeit a different kind of discipline. Once I made the shift, I began making the connections and getting the insights required.

Most change requires a fundamentally different approach or perspective of the world.

## The Process for Resolving These Issues

When most people encounter these issues, it's WAY past the time they should have fixed it. There are problems (and often SEVERE) problems because of it. It's a PR crisis because of an unaddressed equity issue. It's a financial crisis because they can't cash flow their growth. It's a burnout problem or staff retention issue because they can't adapt resources to match needs.  
The goal of simplification is to REDUCE THE VARIABLES of any given system. For example, you can often tell the quality of a culture by the LEAST number of conditions you have to remember.

If you have a culture of innovation, you don't have to encourage people to keep thinking of new ideas. If you have a culture of empathy, you don't have to have policies for make sure people are cared for. Etc.  
For example, if you're in customer service, you might have developed all kinds of policies, such as:

1. What items can be returned for a full refund  
2. What types/resolutions require manager approval  
3. The script used to answer the phone

Etc cetera  
In this case, customer service has a definite rules-based approach. Again, this can be helpful in specific situations. However, it becomes a problem because each exception provides exponential complexity.

Here's where I believe the whole thing starts.

## Step 1: Get a clear picture of your target model

I think the most important process is getting a clear picture of how you would organize or design your solution, based on WHAT YOU CURRENTLY KNOW about the situations you're addressing.

At this stage, you don't worry about figuring out all the details of how to make the transition. Just make sure that you can develop a cohesive, sensible model that addresses what you're trying to do.

For example, a business that has added all kinds of products, etc over the years may look to find common themes, most successful products, etc and develop a simpler, more consolidated product line that makes sense with the company vision.

Or a business that's had different people grow into different roles. Sometimes, people are taking care of too much stuff, or they're in positions that they shouldn't be in. Sometimes you need to introduce another layer of leadership.

The goal is to identify the BIG PICTURE design of what you're moving towards.

The difference between conventional planning and the current planning model is that traditional planning is built around nailing down every last detail. In a static environment or a predictable market  that works very well. If you're putting together a piece of software, and it's very simple and straightforward without a lot of variables, then you can spec out most of this stuff from the get go. This is one of the reasons why phases are so important in projects. You don't know what you don't know. You might roll out a project, only to discover that the market leans in a different direction or something like that. Because you're creating something new, something that hasn't existed before, you don't have the capacity to evaluate it until it's actually in the market. That's how it really is in the software world.

Now, in a very static environment, something like banking, you actually want to have the highly detailed plan because there isn't a lot of change and it is very straightforward. It's very complex, but there's not a lot of variables, it's very static. So you can use a static plan. In a lot of conventional businesses you can do that. The more innovative the business, the less you're able to do that. Innovative businesses require an iterative approach. It also requires this whole approach that I've been talking about in my article. It's a completely different way of looking at the world. Some people might say, "hey, you're not planning if you're doing it  this way."  Actually you are, but it's a completely different model of planning.

Something else to consider. Most planning is on the details, but not anchored on the outcomes. The 80/20 of event planning is determining the outcomes of the event. Most of the other details around planning become noise without it. This is my hangup with most planning.

For example ;-) .... Handwriting on envelopes is a means to an outcome. Discussing the best way to do that is an exercise in standard management. The outcome is open rate. Shifting focus to the outcome allows an 80/20 question of the best and easiest way to do that. One idea is to print the headline on the back of the envelope. You don't get these types of ideas from conventional planning. I have instinctively questioned these things but this is codifying what I naturally do.

## Step 2: Build the minimalistic shell/foundation that you need to start the transition.

It's easy to make the mistake of over-engineering this, but you'll need to put whatever basic foundation in place.  
If you can start by doing this in a place where you don't need to do any transition, this is by far the easiest way to get started. Start in places where you have a completely clean slate, because this allows you to test the assumptions of what you actually want.  
In the product example, if you're wanting to move from one training platform to another, you could consider creating a pilot product on the new platform the prove that you understand what you need and that you've created the process correctly.  
In the leadership example, if you're getting ready to spin up a new department, you could start doing it there. However, it's pretty rare that you'll have that big of a leap that you'll want to make.

## Step 3: Pick an isolated piece of the puzzle to move over.

The challenge with these types of issues is that they are often intertwined, so no specific piece will be absolutely simple.

However, you have to choose a place to start, so start with the place that's most easy to implement the new changes. This gives you a clear objective and limits the complexity of what you're trying to do.

In addition, because complexity has a NETWORK EFFECT, starting at the simplest place exponentially reduces the complexity impact of the remaining issues, even though the others are notoriously difficult to crack.

In the product example, choose one specific product to phase out, or choose a set of products to combine into a single offer.

In the leadership example, choose one department or section of the company to implement these changes.

This has the added advantage that you will learn lessons from doing it that can be applied elsewhere.

As you REMOVE a piece from the puzzle, you will EXPONENTIALLY DECREASE the complexity.

## Step 4: Get x-ray vision into what's REALLY going on.

Here's the thing.

Most complex systems are a black box.

Things go in, things come out, and people aren't sure exactly why or how, but somehow it works.  
One of the best places to start is to start IDENTIFYING what's really going on. This is NOT about value judgment or best practices. This is simply about: if this happens, then that happens, what should the outcome be?

In the product line, you might want x-ray vision into what the product does, or if it's a course, what the course teaches. Or how much it sells, etc.

In a leadership role, you may want to start by defining each person's current responsibilities. For example, you could have them start by spending a few weeks detailing all of the things that they're involved in, and summarizing them as part of the process.

The other fascinating thing about this whole thing is the power of the subconscious. I've frequently gone off and done other things, come back, and had the solution in my head. This is becoming shockingly frequent.

This is one of the reasons why it's so horrible to be pushing yourself to the limit, because it gives little or no ability for your subconscious to work \-- OR for you to connect with Memos about your work.

There's a few other keys to this:

* Have a feedback loop built in, so that you know that the changes you're making are working. (equivalent to unit tests)  
* Having a way to measure progress. The clearer the better. I think it's helpful to know what % of the way through the plan you are, but in lieu of that, even being able to see where you've come from is huge (like my insertion point spreadsheet)  
* When deciding the next big piece to work on, part of the challenge is deciding how to slice and dice it. There are different ways to do it \--- you can examine several pieces, then see if there's a pattern there that can be deduced. The other thing, sometimes there are logical breaks or divisions. You might have to carve off pieces multiple times to get to where you need to go.  
* When you identify an aberration, one of the best ways to solve it is as a one-off, then see if it's a pattern and apply that pattern to other places

Instances:

* I also did this with InvLinkWeb.

## Step 5: Start eliminating exceptions.

Here are a few more lessons on the insertion point job.  One of them is that as soon as you run into an exception, isolate and deal with the exception to standardize it and solve that issue. When you introduce exceptions into whatever else you're trying to do, you dramatically increase complexity. So isolate the complexity, deal with the exception, and everything will go faster for you. Now, here's the other thing that I've noticed. For a while, I thought this was just a productivity issue of not being able to cut to the chase on some of these issues. But I think there's also this element of when you're in the swamp land it can be very disorienting, because you don't necessarily know where the bottom of the swamp is. You don't necessarily know what the right path forward is. So you end up wandering in the swamp, and it feels like you're not necessarily getting momentum or things aren't going as well as you'd like. But there was a mindset shift for me that when you're in the bottom of the swamp, and you're wandering around, and you don't feel like you're making progress, it's okay. It may be disconcerting, but it actually can be a very powerful time for you. And it may be more productive than you know.  Maybe the times when I just felt like I'm struggling, I'm just digging around in the bottom of a swamp. Once you find the bottom of the swamp,  there's something solid to it. And maybe that was that feeling especially with this last round of trying to clean up these section break insertions. I wandered around for a while and all of a sudden, it was like I hit pay dirt and everything started coming together. These are my thoughts on that. super fascinating.  
There's another dynamic to the whole troubleshooting process, which is the whole concept of debugging. There are some things that you can only catch in real time that you can't see any other way. One example of this is the nuances of how people relate with each other, or the nuances of people's emotions or responses in the situation. Another aspect is that people rarely remember all the actual details. When you're watching real time, you can observe the facts. If you understand what facts and details you're looking for, you can actually observe them when you need them. Whereas after the fact the only thing that you can really, truly be certain about is the outcome that you've achieved. So that's why having somebody accompany you through the process can be such a critical piece of it. It's also why it's so much more valuable to watch something in real time. It's also one of the reasons why planning can be problematic because planning predicts but planning is still not real time. And there's some things that can only be determined and fixed in real time. There's some things that cannot be fully determined beforehand by planning because there's other variables but when you're in real time, all those other variables are playing a part.  
Once you get the x-ray vision into what's going on, you can start making clear, sensible adjustments without anything falling through the cracks.  
Here's one of the reasons this is important. Sometimes, you can make changes by completely stopping the show, then restarting again. However, this comes at a big risk:

1. Your new approach isn't guaranteed to approach  
2. You have dramatic downtime in the process

By taking incremental shifts, you can test your changes as you go and minimize disruption during the process. Again, there are some times when it's best to completely revamp things (and no, I'm not sure when that is), but you're not afforded that in every situation.

When you identify a change that will be potentially disruptive, it allows you to build safeguards around that.

## Step 6: Finalize the transition

As you continue making the small changes, you'll find that the big leap (while still being a leap) is actually not as difficult as you first imagined.  
One of the best ways to find additional problems is simply by "staging" the transition, and you'll find remaining unresolved issues.  
However, if all of those gotchas have been cleaned up, it's an easy shift.

## Recap: Toolsets

Here are the common places people get stuck:

1. They don't have a clear picture of how it should look.  
2. They try to transition the WRONG THING (they've mis-identified the simplest item)  
3. They try to transition MORE than just an isolated portion,  
4. They don't have TRANSPARENCY into what's really going on now

If you're stuck, you should review this list and determine which one at fault.

The first software languages were very simple. They basically had a series of step-by-step instructions with the ability to:

1. Read information  
2. Write information  
3. Modify information (i.e. do calculations)  
4. Jump to a different step

If you were to break down the process of a clerk entering information into a cash register, it might involve something like this:

1. Wait until a customer walks up  
2. Look at the customer, smile, and say "hello"  
3. Pick up an item off the counter.  
4. Run the item past the scanner.  
5. Put the item in the bag.  
6. Are there any items on the counter? If so, return to step 3\.  
7. Otherwise, press the "Total" button on the cash register.  
8. Announce the total to the customer.  
9. Wait for the customer to pay.  
10. If the customer pays in cash, enter the amount of cash in the cash register, then press "Paid".

Of course, you can get much more specific. You could spell out the details of: \- Where to turn your head \- What specifically to look for \- Which muscles to engage to use your hand to pick up an item \- Which muscles to engage to move the item closer to scanner \- How much force to use when pressing the buttons on the cash register  
If we did that, we'd have an inordinately lengthy list of tasks. It would almost be impossible to comprehend all the pieces.  
We might also expand this list with all of the possible exceptions: \- What happens if a customer walks up without any items? \- What if the scanner doesn't work for an item? \- How do you handle vegetables that need to be paid? \- What happens if the customer doesn't give you enough cash? \- What is the best order to scan and input items?  
This in-depth list is the equivalent of the early methods of programming. It took many laborious instructions to achieve what you wanted to achieve.

With time, different individuals developed higher-level languages. In short, these languages identified common patterns. They condensed a dozen instructions down into one.  
Today, we see the rise of low-code and no-code solutions. These solutions take thousands (maybe even millions) of instructions and turn them in a small handful of instructions.  
How does this apply to business?  
The seniority of a person is in their ability to be able to describe and understand a very complex task in a simple sentence.  
If you have an experienced marketer, you can tell them that you need to launch a new marketing campaign. They immediately know that it will require hundreds of specific action steps to make that happen.  
If you give the same instruction to an inexperienced marketer, they will be unable to complete your request. They'll be completely lost.  
This means that your level of detail must match the level of experience. If you have highly inexperienced team members, the best way to work with them is through tactical delegation. You have to guide them through the step-by-step instructions of everything that needs to be done.  
If you give this level of detail to a senior marketer, they'll be bored to tears (or outright insulted).  
Second of all, you need to be able to find the common building blocks in what you do. The reason we can effectively tell people how to do something is because we have some basically terminology that encapsulates many actions. For example:

* Run  
* Walk  
* Shout  
* Whisper

The more that you can identify those components in your business, the more quickly you'll be able to train people on the most common pieces. This will make your training process easier.

In fact, an exercise you should do right now is try to identify the most common patterns that are in play in your business. YOu are almost certainly missing training and delegation opportunities because you do not recognize the repeated patterns.

# Linear and Holistic Thinking

# Linear and Holistic Thinking

Software developers typically fall into two camps.  
The first kind of developers think very linearly. They are step-by-step thinkers. They think in terms of steps and sequence. They are fantastic at making sure that software is functionally correct--that is, that it actually does what it's supposed to do.

The second kind of developers think holistically. They think in terms of parts and relationships, not in step-by-step actions. They are fantastic at making sure that the software is cohesive. They make sure that all the parts of the software fit together.

Of these, I believe that the first kind of individual is more commonly attracted to software develoment. I frequently felt out of place beause, while I learned strong linear thought, I much prefered the holistic thinking. My colleagues often told me that my code was elegant. It had a poetry to it.

Each kind of developer has a corresponding weakness. A very linear thinker will get the job done, but it might not always be done in the most elegant way. A very holistic thinkiner will find an elegant, cohesive way to get things done, but they might miss the minute details in the process.  
If you can pair these individuals together, you get a powerful combination. They can cover each other's blind spots. The best years of my software development career was working side-by-side with a linear-thinking developer. We frequently grabbed the keyboard away from each other when we saw the other making a mistake that fell in our blind spot.

How does this apply to business?

A linear thinker can quickly see and recognize tasks that need to be done. They are always pushing these things forward.

A holistic thinker can quickly see where specific tasks fit into the big picture. If they don't see a way to fit them into the big picture, they'll push until they see the connection.

You want a healthy balance of each.

Your linear thinkers will keep others from overthinking what needs to be done, and they'll just make sure it happens.

Your holistic thinkers will keep others from creating tangled messes by making sure that the business is well-designed from the inside-out.

If you are struggling with getting buried in the weeds, you should find a holistic thinker who can help you get out of the weeds, gain perspective, and see what you're missing.

If you are struggling with redesigning everything without getting anything done, you should find a linear thinker you can drive your project in a sequence of next steps.

# Introduction

# Introduction

I've been intrigued by systems as long as I can remember.  
When I was five years old, I knelt by a shelf in the lunchroom of my parents' bulk food store. I had a pen and a blank 8.5x11" paper.

On it, I sketched out a sandwich-making machine. It even had a special arm for people who wanted mustard on their sandwhich.

I remember the pride of showing it to my childhood hero Arlyn, thinking about all the work it would save. I imagined using it for a restaurant someday.

By the time I was nine years old, I was writing software code. It started with silly programs, like a police radar detector and a Winnie-the-Pooh text editor. However, by the time I was 13, I had written my first instant messenger to help a deaf software developer communicate with the rest of his team.

I mastered the craft of software development, and I become one of the top developers at the company. Then, I hit a wall.

Bored, frusrated, and restless, I began hunting for the next step.  
I became an executive assistant at a non-profit, sitting in senior leadership meetings. And then, a few years later, dove headfirst into business.

Even though my father owned a retail business, I knew that would never work for me. It spent nearly ten years going deep down the depths of business--sales, marketing, and operations. My brother and I started a business to build custom software for small businesses. I discovered I had a unique superpower of understanding the workflow and designing custom software to help the business track profitability and become more efficient.

Most recently, my focus has shifted from mere software systems, to the business systems themselves.

All my life, I've lived and breathed systems.  
This book is an invitation in my mind

On Thursday, June 2, 2022, my friend Ricky asked me a simple question about my work. In that one-hour lunch conversation, I realized just how deeply this had affected me.

I spent an entire hour after that conversation recording my thoughts on an audio transcription.

Here's my short goal: \- Explain basic principles in software development to business people \- Show how these basic principles can practically improve your leadership

* **Levels of abstraction**

Okay, so what did it take some time because Ricky asked me a question about why he asked the question, why is can a small website not keep up with volume of streaming video, but YouTube can't. And why is it so expensive that it would take millions of dollars to scale up? And well, well, while I don't have the exact, full, in depth reason in a way that I think I can articulate. I think one of the things that arose from that is like, well, what is actual software because there's two ways that people think about software. What is people think about software from a very technical standpoint? In other words, you have a there there kind of are two types of even programming programming languages that are very linear, very, very, you know, step by step, the whole thing is a step by step. And that's called functional programming. Now, there's another way of programming which is like it will and those functional instructions are the foundation of any programming like I mean, yes, there are other types of expressive languages, expression based languages that are more you know, whatever, but be that as it may, at the core of all language and even you know, here's another interesting way to look at it. If you look at the evolution of software, and the evolution of language, then. Then you have the postcards and then the assembly language and it's like, well, let's do complicated. Let's make shorthand for that. And then that ultimately everything was predominantly linear.  
And so somebody's said, Okay, well, instead of like, let's not make this completely linear, let's say, We're gonna let you say go to what I mean. Maybe this is from the beginning, go to Step four, and repeat. Okay, well, that's good. That's really complicated. Like, like, how do I keep that in my head? And so then it's like okay, well, we're gonna put names to this go to the part that's named you know, you know, show error on the screen and then the let's go on the you know, let's let's and then when it's done then it can go it can tactic does to go to somewhere else. And so we don't actually had to know the actual location, we can just refer to it by name, and then it's really easy. And then finally said, Okay, well, this is good, but we have to pass information back and forth. And so, in order to do that, we need to have something called parameters. In other words, there's certain types of input and certain types of output that these these things can have and and how do we, how do we define those? How do those get passed, passed around? And then we started creating a convention for that. And then they said, Well, it's actually not quite that simple because now you have two versions that are worked together and, and how do those things tie together? Well, you have something called the class or the class to share some information. And, and oh, by the way, there are some design patterns that are really important when you're working with classes which is which is, you know, you can have I mean, for example, well, first of all, there are some design patterns, resources that are really important.   
For example, there are some contracts that you're going to keep. In other words, I'm only going to ask you to do this under this, these situations, I'm going to only only going to tell you a certain subset of things and then and then when you're done like you promised that the world will be in this kind of a state when you're done. And the same with classes like this class is responsible for a conceptual conceptual part of the part of the process. Now, this this concept has been in it in the you know, in software development from for a very long time, even before was called this, where it's like, well, what what is the class what classes is often represents some kind of thing. So sometimes it's an abstract thing and sometimes it's a more tangible thing. So for example, your you want to start working with a file on disk, there's a series of operations that need to happen in order for you to do that you need to let the operating system know that you want to open the file you want to tell it what to do as a file doesn't exist and you need to know what what you're planning on doing doing with the file so you don't accidentally do the wrong thing with it. So you can keep yourself from shooting yourself in the foot and then once you do that, then you need to tell what part of the file you want to go to. And then once you're in the right part of the file, then you need to know you need to decide what you're going to either read or what you're going to write or if you do both and then you need to tell it that okay, I'm done doing whatever I need to do the final week  
I'm done with that I'm not going to be doing anything with it and then it closes don't have access to it and and that gives the operating system a chance to go write these things to death so that your information doesn't get lost and and it helps your your operating system manage resources because now because even though it's a small amount it takes there's some bandwidth for it to to be able to keep track of your file and the changes that you're making. And then once you've got that then what's the next piece well, okay, so, so then these are the types of things that you can you can use you can make it read only you can you can look at certain physical piece of information you can query it find out when it was last modified and these are all parts of accessing files, well, oh, look at all these functions that do the same thing. And they're all interconnected and interrelated. Well, this is actually, you know, conceptually. This is a this is a class. And so we're going to create a class called a file that has all of these functions that it can have. Now, how does this actually relate with business? Well, first of all, there's all kinds of interesting things that the that the that are going on under the hood when you're working with the file, but you don't actually need to know when you're working with a file. Like you don't really need to know this information, but it's happening under the hood. So what does the class do? A class helps to hide that information from you so that when you ultimately when you want to work with the firewall, you need to know you need to know the file name, you need to know some things about what you're gonna be doing. And then you need to perform the actual actions. And so here's one of the lessons that we extract from from business is that sometimes there's groups of activities that you're doing together that logically belong to each other. And, and, and you want them to be to be interconnected with each other. And because of that, you can well, and so you can put them all under one roof and and when somebody wants to go and the way that you manage complexity is you look at the points of communication so how do you get at the point of intimate communication? Well, you only share the information that needs to be shared, you try to reduce the number of people that it needs to be shared with. And when you do that, you isolate and eliminate complexity. So you might have a sales department that's really complicated. We have a marketing department that's extremely complicated. And there's all these folks talking to each other. But what you do is you have you haven't you have parts within any part of the business talks as much as it needs to with with other people, but when you try to limit it to a single point of contact, you dramatically reduce reduce complexity. What does this also mean? Well, systems and processes are much more than just step by step instructions. It's about finding the natural order and the natural structure that is that is emerging from within the organization. So now there are some patterns that we have. Well, there's, there's there's some other issues too, which is it's centered around scalability like how do you how do you skill software? Well, at some point, you need to have a you need to have one source of truth for your information like you can't have you can't have to two people out there with with the same name and same social security number and different phone numbers because, well, then what what are they like which number is correct? And so let's say that you have a massive amount of storage and massive amount of information that you're dealing with and you need to synchronize this information across multiple people that are that are wanting to use it how? Well one of the ways that you do is one of the things you can do is you say okay, well, it's perfectly appropriate, appropriate to have somewhat stale information. So sometimes on a news website, just the act of saying that somebody is going to have one second still news, or that somebody's watching a streaming video that's one or two seconds delayed, introduces enough delay and enough of a capacity that it allows the to steer the burden and and speed it up so in other words,  
so why, why is this? When you have only one source of information, that's the source of truth, then you have two dozen people that are going to this one person, and this one person gets overloaded because they only have so much bandwidth. So when the same people then you say, Well, no, that doesn't make sense. So so in the in the case of software, instead of just having one computer to go to, we're gonna have that one computer still gonna be the source of truth, but it's going to share its information with six computers. And each of those six computers will have a copy of the information that's been delayed. And so every second it's refreshing it to get the to get the latest to get the latest information. And and then and then instead of, you know 15 People going to, to 18 people to the first person you now have whatever the numbers are you got you know just a handful of people going to each one so suddenly you've multiplied your capacity because you've introduced some kind of a delay. Now, what does this mean in business? Well in business, sometimes you may have something that is the source of truth like a city or county. And, you know, maybe this is less true in a digital context. But it may be true in a you know, from a procedural standpoint, so there is a master procedure list that gets handed down to from department to department and, and because there's a delay then we're able to allow the  
then then people can go ahead and instead of asking just one person and bombarding one person with all of these questions, they're actually able to go to multiple people and there's multiple sources of information for this now what's the problem with this in any kind of software environment? Well, one of the problems is, is that what happens when you have three copies of this information and, and the source of truth changes so, so three computers have memorized my contact information and it changed the actual contact information? How do they know to update? Well, there's a few ways that they can do this one, you can say, well, we just do this automatically every second. So if you catch it within a second, then you're gonna get stale information. What does this mean in an organization? You could, it may just mean that it takes time to roll out changes and whenever these changes get rolled out, and people get notified, and if you're okay with a delay, you're fine. Now what's another way to do it? Well, you can have a you could have a quick check in that basically says, Hey, I'm here with this information, is it is it still up to date? And if it was, then you then you go, or good? Or you could say, Well, every time we get this information, we're gonna go see if it's is this out of date and if it is, then we're gonna go fetch it ourselves and replace it. So there's, there's a number of ways that you could actually deal with this issue. Or you can have, you know, whatever, when, or you can have this proactive or you can have a proactive state where, where this is when when something is out of date, then it gets pushed down to let it get gets, that actually gets pushed out. Alright, you're gonna have a hybrid approach, which is like, okay, there's a new policy. Now we're going to go to, we're gonna go yank that policy out of the binder and whenever you need a new one, you're gonna come back and you're gonna find a find a new one for us. And so that's how you deal with issues of scalability and how to how to prevent the duplication of information. Now, what you really want to avoid is you what you want. What you really want to avoid is you want to avoid duplication of mystery. You want to prevent the spread of misinformation. And the way that you prevent the spread of misinformation is that having only one source of true information. Now, what what are some other you know, what are some other parallels and equivalents? Well, another federal equivalent is there's something in suffering. There's something in the hardware side, which is short term memory, long term memory Well, what happens when you plug unplug your computer? Well, ideally, all that happens is up against goes down into anything that was open your programs and you know, unless you're like Mac and you Well, I mean, maybe Mac doesn't even do this, but it turned himself down. And as a result of that, you lose all the information that he had open in your progress, but the files on your hard drive are safe. Now. There's some some very specific timing situations where, especially in olden days, if you have power at the wrong time, then you might have a partially written file and you wouldn't and file wouldn't be valid if you might actually lose information on disk. But by and large, we solved that problem. And by the way, we now have batteries, which means that the loss of power is very unlikely, but nonetheless, computer has has a concept of short term memory versus long term memory. Well, what's the benefit of short term? Memory? The benefit of short term memory is that it's super super fast. In other words, like, I mean, if you're dealing with, you know, one of the fastest things, well, you know, as an example, when you have software you might have a million lines. The project that we worked on had upwards of a million lines of code. And, and because of the way this this stuff is interconnected, it was ended up processing. I don't know exact numbers, but maybe five or 10 million lines of code because of how again, how how those technical pieces of information happened through the reading this much information and enough to be a bottleneck, especially at the point that you had, that you had a valid you know, whatever your your CPU, your processor was fast enough, and then the slowdown would become reading all this information on this. Well, what's what's it analogous to? RAM is analogous to this is analogous to your short term memory and and written procedures are analogous to long term memory. So So why do you need them? Well, short term memory is good, because it's really fast that you can remember but the problem is that there can be blessing in your short term memory. And so that's when you need long term memory. Or you might close down the program and and somebody else might come up and, and show like log in and be like, Oh, so you know, the program might restart. What's that analogous to this? That's analogous to somebody else coming in and jumping into here in the process? Well, they might not actually know what's going on but so they need a long term memory so that they can load it into they can do it quickly. And then once it's, once it's, it's, it's it's like it gets replicated. So here's another theory of scalability. In other words, like  
the equivalent of caching is like, you have these, you have these written procedures and they get copied down into people's brains. And so what needs to happen is when these things get changed, you need to push them to people's brains, or people need to check in and that's really where the scalability analogy comes in. So that you need to transfer it to their their for short term, their long term memory. And this is called you know, this is a process called syncing. Now, no thinking is another issue, which is, at some point, you have to have an actual source of truth, like you can't just have some kind of false wish, which is what happens when you have one person that changes one thing and somebody else who changes another thing, how you reconcile those differences you need to know What's the content? What needs this was what needs to go in today? Again, what's the analogy here when you've got when you've got these procedures in, in somebody's head, they might actually start behaviorally doing something different that doesn't match what's actually documented and written down. And as a result of that, it introduces this disconnect between what's actually documented and how it's actually  
being executed. So, in that particular case,  
with that particular case, what you need to do and on top of that, might actually have management making changes to these and thus meeting to creating multiple levels of difference where you can't just update so what you need to do is you need to take a look at and compare them. And by comparing them essentially what you do is you look for the differences. You figure out which difference resulted from changes by whom, and then you interleave those changes, and you make sure that the changes still create a coherent whole, which is basically the process that happens when talking about the process. We're not a code review process but in a conflict merge from a software standpoint, one of the ways that you do this is you  
either assign something as the source of truth,and you force people to do that, or you've got some of the processes of reconciliation and thinking and then the less real time, the thinking the greater the likelihood of changes. And then what happens when you've got multiple people trying to change the same process. And if you do both different ways, now you have a conundrum that requires human intervention because you need to actually look at how they're doing it differently specifically, and be able to reconcile those Okay. So, taking this a bit further you also have to understand that these things are divided in categorized in different ways. In other words, there's things all the way in the very basic granular structure which are called statements and then blocks and then functions and classes and modules and libraries and applications and even application suites. In other words, this whole design process is extremely fractal and Yeah relationships with between statements Groups. There's their responsibility if you're doing XY or z, if you very similar outside of that. The last thing you want to create is if you create a Swiss army knife, but if you create a dummy knife which should be at the core is this container that holds all of these isolated separate tools and if you have a tool that grows separately, and you if it evolves into it into a Swiss Army Knife without proper categorization, preferably a unifier then you just have this convoluted mess where it's like maybe it kind of works but there are some things that just need to be done. But there's, there's not always it becomes a series of tasks, which is a whole other form of programming. It's called scripting. In other words, there's these isolated things that need to be done isolated tasks. And just go do them. And we can support the environment, but they're not really, you know, they're critical for the for that they're not actually part of the they fall under, typically under kind of a different set of some rules. They can be shorter in the linear base doesn't always necessarily tie elegantly to emerging coal. So along with that, Kevin, one of the things you see with we were going to present is that procedures which are this one on pass, these are the essentially the scripts, the batch processes, that needs to be run, that supported progress that's going on, but then we also have the whole itself itself and how those actually functions. So there is another part of development which is, is the code review process, which means that you always have a second device, looking everything and trying to see because essentially what happens is there's balance transfer happening both directions. First of all, you have some risk. But then you also have feedback on investing and have something with a fresh set of eyes. So that's one aspect of it, but it is something else that happens is an actual UA which, again, we're not stringent on this, but I wanted you to be able to have what I didn't execute at least once and then the more you can verify that these things are actually saying it actually gets recorded that everything's recorded. That needs to be reasonably reported. There are some additional pieces that I think it was going to tie into that. Getting is going to give me a moment to think about a little bit and see what else I came up with. Here is something interesting is usually what a piece of software is, it really comes down to a set of instructions organized in a logical coherent manner to interact with the outside world. Control the defined means with with an exchange of communication with an exchange and storage of information. So, people from the outside who are providing information, providing something there is a specific set of instructions of how to get that information or that information something useful there's a small black box of outside of what appears to be happening but there's actually so many layers beneath what actually is happening. And, you know, this is not not a dissimilar analogy. One of the challenges we face along with that is that ultimately what you want is a high level level. system the greater picture it's because of missteps. Decisions decision design process because you lose context. Or you have something that is actually designed in a different context and environment and conceptually, they say it's applicable. But it's actually not a result, you end up having to shoehorn it in you basically, introduce, you don't have control over changing. So that is analogous to, say a vendor or something particular vendor you're working with and you don't have the ability to change how they operate. You end up you know, the biology. Example is another way to remind me of the rule of three. I'll get back to that logical example if you form a callus or something around that. And you just let yourself in, but it's interesting, but sometimes you actually somebody processes me but what you need to do is be able to find a bit of that in a way that you can manage the complexity and again, isolate. You want to isolate whenever you can't isolate, isolate it as much as possible. Isolating, it means reducing, keeping it a very local impacts. See how much and there's this whole concept of the rule of three which is, well actually, there's also this concept of refactoring, which What does refactoring mean? Well, if you look at the total cost of ownership on a software project, its industry standards, they tend to represent the initial why is that? It's because it's actually apparently a static transaction is very, very dynamic space. being applied the speed of innovation it was 10 years ago, we're talking about was perfecting yourself we're talking about. or 15 years ago, when we were talking about was what to window which went from a static document based web to a you know, interactive web And now and now we're talking about what what we put out which is the centralized software. So suffers by, by nature, very dynamic, and as a result of that you have to invest in maintenance, or you're going to or you're going to lose a project and the cost of maintenance costs represent every year. Well, what does this actually how does this actually translate? If you really want to be really want to integrate processes effectively, you have to allow room to look yes, it will speed up your process. But you also have to allow to be able to go back and revisit it and edit it and make changes and revamp it and more than just tweaks and edits are times when you will have to restructure entire parts of it so that you can do so that you're gonna continue to adapt. Why is that because business is what type of business but the more static your business, the less you have to do that the more kinetic your business and the more vulnerable you are to moving parts outside of it. Then the more the more important. This is another another tool set in programming called refactoring. refactoring. Well, refactoring basically is let's actually start with three, three, the rule of three says that before you before you genericized something we should generally implemented about. Doing this you'll create this very quickly deals with what you idealize would happen but it's not actually grounded in reality so complicated. Because you don't really know what this is more. You can be useful it doesn't actually work. This is very common with people who are trying to build out a business process when they've actually built out the business. You want to build a high margin business on the front end. So you can actually have the room and space to build the process, because you want to do this repeatedly before and allow yourself the space to figure this and by the way, there's different skill sets. To innovating to this first number of iterations and finding the common patterns and systematizing it to keeping that machine going. And we're using so. So one of the things you want to do is say hey, this sounds a lot like this thing that we're doing over here. Like is this basically the same thing can be consolidated and they can't be consolidated the same process one of the process, really in other words, basically what you have when you did this, to make sure that you repeat this over here as well, and the other places oh, by the way, it could be this place. By doing that, you can make sure that things that are very similar and we're pretty similar, but slightly differently. Confusion of trying to create something that works for both substantially different but substantially similar types of procedures, make sure that we can make changes to one you think, the application. Now, there's also these questions about what makes a good development environment and what are the things that makes your development environment that makes it really easy to find connections and find the things that you're looking for. And in any, any type of situation like minimize the amount of time that actually spent looking for things. Make it as easy as possible actually. A few things one is a good system for organization. Insert search for your seats and we're not going to wait and really, really want to know about you prize So there's another very common design pattern that you see which is a tree structure. One of the reasons why choose structures are helpful and relevant is that they represent the fractal nature of things. Which really is not unlike an org chart. It's not unlike many of the things that you might have. I don't really know how this actually plays into an organization. But one of the things that does is well, one of the things that it does is it really gives you a way to, to versus a list we're list is a linear set of things. It does allow you to easily segment you know, another way of representing the tree structure, so to speak, it does mean that you can, like if you imagine, wall surfaces all the leaves and if your circles subset any number of related issue and related pieces based on based on the level of specificity, for example, you might say, there's this one here, that is related to like, here's his script. I want to see where, what might be impacted by changes to this task. And so, you look at things that are closely somewhat related to the less closely less closely less for free and go expanding after concentric circles. We're able to identify where potential leads, there's a good chance to serve some kind of practical method. It's not immediately apparent, but it's something worth considering. it's if you take a software system and rewrite it completely from scratch, it's often means depth to the project. And the reason is that there are small pieces of detail that have significant impact and ramifications. So, there may have been this one scenario sample of scenarios where something went sideways a series of small fixes to prevent that problem with doing things is that there are certain nuances in in that so because it appears to be in detail, you may underestimate the action together. mitigate that as much as possible to mitigate this by mutations. Document. Fixing by doing things a certain way, and then being a fantastic array of data. Managing versus waiting, simply don't understand perhaps not in the Maybe it's not important for the people who are actually going through that but they need to consider why they bug fixes are part of the process, and bug fixes, I don't just mean intelligence mean correct ways to fix problems with systematically. So now there's this there's this final piece, which is probably one of the greatest skills that comes from position which is managing work maximum. And, again, different different developers will focus on different things. So if you have a certain type of you have to understand that certain types of software features, temporary levels of the printer cracy. If you have the software that's where accuracy or performance or timeliness accuracy are not a major issue, then quality of rebate actually be more important, but when you have situations where we have situations where accuracy actually does matter substantially. That's where attention and care for detail are more important. So again, very pragmatically when it comes to building out these processes in detail for you, to place the things that require precision and allow other people to allow other people to do the things so with that, in everything there is this drive for pragmatic pragmatic benefit was actually usually one thing, surely, as a result, we build a machine that doesn't actually have to worry. There's other people who do that. So it's like hierarchy. So what's your engine is a system so if you if you systems are like yours, and if you have a low amount of momentum in a vehicle, hear I hear all the distractions, like we're just going to give one away and you're going to look here and you're going quickly, or you're going to max out Europeans and that's the scenario worst case scenario. You really want to start later. So how do you do that? I think it's always a work in progress. This is supposed to serve you and make your life easier, not harder to start with the pieces that are most difficult or that person can most easily be offloaded or delegated. So that's that and then, then there's this process of how do you actually break this down? I think one of the easiest ways to do this sort of process of tactical delegation, which means any number of ways you can do this. So ultimately, what you want to do is you need to have you need to have some kind of recorded storage in some format or another, it can be taxed, can be written or it can be spoken for TV video. And the it is a trade off between speed of changing Egypt changing it and updating small parts of it, versus Ease of Doing it the first time. Usually it's more work to get it to the first time in a way that allows you to easily get the feature. So it's a trade off. But then there's also this secondary issue that different people have different preferred means of communication. So some people prefer to live on the fly and some people prefer recorded so you might have live spoken and so simply what you would you can do there if somebody has like spoke smoking, there's a few things you can do. Easiest thing is just to record it and have it transcribed using something like otter. You might have something to utilize written, which may come down to have a chat or text message or email, exchange. You know, may end up being heavyweight and then using that kashrut and restructuring it and reformat it or you may have some leakage occurs live demonstrations. Again, video can be a great way of doing this for feedback, watching them do it practices or doing it yourself can be amazing. What you're looking for, is you want to translate from a live environment into a recorded environment, that it can get translated back into a live environment accurately. So keeping in mind that there's these three primary modes of communication, learning and modeling appropriately, and you'll find that in different types of roles that you'll have proclivities in one direction or the other based on first so for example, if you are in some form of manufacturing things for your Etsy shop, those types of people may be more inclined to learn by watching collections. And by doing so, you've built your training process. And you may actually want to have some kind of mean, here's a simple example. You may actually want to have a physical board that has pictures of the tasks with a QR code that allows you to pull in specific details for that particular class. Or you may actually have a print out a series of books that's once you freak. out people who are some people who again this this, some people may prefer flowcharts more of a step by step instructions of what to do this, this, this and this. And then, you know, this is my personal preference because of the ease and simplicity of the tool set. Simply allowing yourself to complete the inspection. Putting in big categories of steps. It's very easy to read into, style Here's another really interesting correlation when you consider low level versus measurable languages. Because I think low level languages can be roughly equivalent to unskilled labor, which means that you can I mean, theoretically you can take anything and you can break it down in a unskilled level. But if you were to write let's say in assembly language, it would be surgery ridiculously complicated, but it will prove to be useless. Now that's extreme, but with higher level languages, higher level levels of abstraction, a lot means that there is some kinds of free understood ideas like that, that allow you to get things done. So what you want to do is you want to tailor the instructions that you have or the level of knowledge that you expect to have so. By and large, your lower level tasks will include a much higher level of detail because yet people will text you. The other responsibilities for your procedures for a marketing director, for example, will be higher level, things that you might actually put in information about or hear the things that need to be done. Specifically, by as part of this, we're just understanding that, you know, high level languages allow you to say a lot of words or skill your team member that you're listening with more you'll be able to do that. So just tailored appropriately. Again, there's two things that you're looking to do. One is to unpredictability because people are and the other thing is to be able to let them go on vacation and somebody else cover for them for people. So instructions are certainly fighting. Argument, vacation you don't really have more than just the basic are going to respond. So those types of responsibilities, if they reasonably can be outside their role, and listen to us more specific language work, and more perversely to work versus high level conversations

# System Optimization

* [https://otter.ai/u/xdaKpaxySCQp631H2NnKZUEZNB4?f=home](https://otter.ai/u/xdaKpaxySCQp631H2NnKZUEZNB4?f=home)

I had this realization after hearing Stephanie talking about the theory of constraints. And related works, which is there's a process of there's a tree structure process hierarchical process in optimization, which means in software optimization, so, for example, when you go the first step of any kind of optimization issue is find the worst case scenario first of all, and how do you exaggerate the problem? So, in software, it's like, go throw the biggest data set at it or the biggest, you know, fill in the blank where if it's really the resource contention, go constraint, the problematic resources. So have you know, do something that brings it to the surface and then and then the question is, once you have that, then you do the analysis. Now the cool thing is, with software, you have a call stack, which is essentially a hierarchical view of where the bottleneck is. And so what so you start at a high level? View really clear when you say what's taking a long time. But at a high level, you say, how much time is this? What are the big portions of and how long does each big person take? And then you dive down into into those portions. And it could be that what initially appears to take a really long time is actually quite well optimized. It's just takes a long time. And then you look for you may go into going down a different branch, and diagnosing other further process, you might find that in that part of the process, there's a piece of it that takes an inordinate amount of time that is hyper inefficient, and you can fine tune that. And then as a result of that, you get, you know, marginal benefit. Now, the other thing you might discover along the way is that your algorithm is wrong, which means that your fundamental approach is misaligned. So, what are ways that you can eliminate that? Well, there's a few ways that you can do that. One is you can do more things simultaneously. And so you can introduce multi threading, or some kind of multiprocess thing. You can do more of the similar things at the same time. Or you can try to deal with you can try to cache there's more information in memory at a time. You can, you can and sometimes there's a spirit of faster ways of solving problems. Or a you know, sometimes instead of a highly accurate calculation, you can find a way to get an approximation that's actually accurate enough which you want to do. But it's much less expensive to speculate. It's really hard to tell, I guess, here's the question. You know, typically, when you profiled there's there's two pieces of the puzzle one is what percentage of time does this take of the parent task? And what percentage of time does it take your real task? And so if you search everything, based on time will be a real task and very quickly, you start to notice exactly where the bottleneck is. And that's the thing that you want to optimize first. Usually. So there's two steps to this. There's the profiling process, which is basically give me the data in a hierarchical format, sorted in or appropriate way so that we can actually filter these things to the top of the list, and we know how to address it, then there's the question of how do you actually optimize, optimize it? And you know, I don't really know that I've got much more to add to any of this. So the question then becomes, you know, the interesting thing about this is that this is actually the approach that I've used for the time study, which is, let me profile your time. And, and, really the there's two helpful pieces of it first is you actually have a grid or a framework and some level of categorization, some kind of tree structure to outline your time and I think it could actually be productive to convert this from a grid  
to a to a tree structure, where on any given task, you can break down deeper, the deeper levels of the tree structure I'm not completely sure how that might work. But there is this profiling data collection. The way profiling works, is really not that dissimilar from the 15 minute time log, which is, you know, sampling. Let's go see what we're doing periodically. And let's just get a sense off of that what I'm doing is a different approach. Which is less accurate, but still accurate enough to get significant wins from. And then there's the the analysis, which is basically Okay, let's sort these things based on their level of impact and there's two resources being measured. There's opportunity cost, and there's actual time spent to the other cost. So we sort of based on those resources, and that's what drives the priorities that would actually optimize.  
Yeah, so there you go. There's this really interesting take on business optimization, which can be taught but feels actually pretty instinctive. To me, and I don't know exactly how to quantify it in the example of dealing with dismissal last night, at the Vacation Bible School is a good example where we are creating distinct separate points of communication between different people, and by doing so, eliminating a lot of complexity and chaos. Because we were able to do that. So there you go. interesting observations about the recommendation and business process optimization

# Systems \- Threading \- Shared Resources

[https://otter.ai/u/mBJqk3qcHAfmPvEiBLN-cj99-gw?f=home](https://otter.ai/u/mBJqk3qcHAfmPvEiBLN-cj99-gw?f=home)  
that's working. All right, here's another angle of this whole thing. multi threading mutexes shared data locks, race conditions, etc. So when you just a few observations that when you've got a lot of people working in the same type of environment and working on the same types of things that they need to coordinate things so that they don't, don't conflict on shared resources. And this can create a constraint because not only does the shared resource create the problem, create a bottleneck, but the actual act of checking for the shared resource makes it a bottleneck. Let me give you a practical example. Let's say that you've got one truck for two guys. It's not just the fact that only one guy can be on the road at a time. It's the fact that each guy has to check to see whether the other guy is using the truck before he can actually use the truck. Now in a digital world, if you're using something like Excel spreadsheets, for example, you have the same type of resource contention is what it's called. You have one person who wants to use the Excel spreadsheet and the other person doesn't now you can just try to open the Excel spreadsheet and that might be good enough but even the, you know, even the fact that you might not be able to open the Excel document creates introduces delay because you know, you're already Planning for Contingencies of what if I'm actually not able to or if it doesn't, completely throws those off sideways, what you're trying to do. mutexes are basically a way just say, okay, here are the parameters around you know, here, here are the parameters. You know, you can simplify this by creating parameters around how often or when you actually do try to access the shared resource. Now, sometimes you can engineer your shared resource in such a way that there's only one person responsible for actually managing and updating the shared resource. And because they have limited bandwidth. There's the it's a simple matter of sequencing in order so for, for example, in the vehicle example that I gave, the equivalent would be to have is to have a dispatcher where they make multiple requests. And whatever whatever form or mechanism that they want to prioritize it by whether it's by first come first serve, or whether it's by other types of prioritization. They can manage access to the shared resource and then ultimately, you know, there's a final final piece of this, which is there's a waiting that necessarily comes when you have a shared resource and so while you might engage with other with other types of sorry, what other types of activities you still The challenge is that, you know, when you when you've got multiple threads, you can very easily just tell them to wait until the shared resources available, but that's from a human perspective. That's horribly inefficient. And so, ultimately what you have to do is do this from a systems perspective. So you've got your notification or something like that that occurs when something becomes available.  
Call Waiting hold. These are types of examples of managing asynchronous communication because you've got a shared resource, ie either a person or a phone line. And you can either wait until the resources available or get a call back. I mean, this is I guess along with that, there's synchronous waiting and asynchronous waiting, has in literally, this is called a callback. And when a great example, again is customer service, when are you going to wait, wait, well, actually, there's three types. Three ways to do this. One is I'm going to there's synchronous waiting. There's event driven notifications, and then there's polling polling just means I'm gonna check check, check, check, check until it's done. Now. The problem with that? Well, and along with that, there's also timeout typically with the with any type of waiting, perhaps not with event. Driven but so you have  
to let's say that you've got a project that is an email that you send, and you don't get a response. Well, clearly, it's not a logical approach to simply wait until you get a response. So that means that you are either waiting for an event driven or pulling, pulling type of response. With this, there's also the concept of timeout. So let's say that you pull, which means that you periodically check back in and say, Hey, did I get an email? And if not, you might actually ping them and say, Hey, can I have an answer? To my email and you continue this event driven? You simply wait for the response to come back. And in the example of Google, it comes back to you after two days or three days, and you haven't gotten a response. So this guarantees some kind of timeout on the responses to your email messages. The same thing applies to so this is one of the ways that you prevent system failure, or that you protect against it. because the question is, how do you protect against things when they go completely dark? Well, you need contingencies for that. So what happens when.  
What happens when somebody is on hold for 10 minutes, and I didn't know they didn't just. stranded you ring them back into the main queue and you prioritize them to the tops of Cubans and it rings again  
you talk to somebody who's more likely to be available and says hey answer this call

# Systems Refactoring

* [https://otter.ai/u/BHGGXshHWLoKr0FgqbMmVGDcGms](https://otter.ai/u/BHGGXshHWLoKr0FgqbMmVGDcGms)

So here's another fascinating take on coding in business because refactoring is natural part of the process. When, when is what makes refactoring be necessary? Well, it's the process of flows to change requirements change direction. It's like it's a continuous self healing process. And it's absolutely critical to continue doing refactoring to make the codebase as flexible and as nimble as and useful as possible. And if you do not refactor that you end up with something that's brittle, which means that they'll try to make a change and all these other things will break because because of it, so what do you do in the process of refactoring? Well, you look for commonalities you look for things that have not been updated in a long time. He looked for things that should be simplified. To tease apart things that have kind of, you know, this thing used to be one thing and it grew into three things and now you split apart the three things. You You You move Part A that has been under this umbrella you remove you know, sometimes you completely redefined how something is done, and you transition out of that way in the old into the new way and, and you delete old code that is no longer necessary because of because of all those changes in requirements. So in business, it's like, it's moving people from one place to another department, it's building out departments, inspiring people, it's rearranging things, it's ultimately rearranging the components of the business to align where the business has grown to splitting apart responsibilities. People were doing too many things at a time. And creating and, and reorganizing and restructuring that and getting the business into a healthier, maintainable place. And if you don't do this, your business is gonna break one way or the other. Business is always code tends to break when you have refactoring. You have to do testing, you have to be careful and you have to take these things piece by piece, but if you don't do it, that will take a different way, which means you're going to hit a some kind of growth plateau. And the same is true in business where if you don't take the time to refactor your business, you don't you don't take time to restructure and reorganize and get things off of people's brains and split decisions and to and all of those things. Then, you're going to encounter a different type of breakage which is simply like your business will become brittle and it will become resistant to growth. And you won't be able to lower and make those types of changes that you need to so interesting perspective on refactoring as well.

# Context Switches

[https://otter.ai/u/bfNZW9qc49o\_d6iVnnz5uI1Qocg?f=home](https://otter.ai/u/bfNZW9qc49o_d6iVnnz5uI1Qocg?f=home)  
So one of the things that's really interesting to take a look at is this whole thing of context switching. ie, what happens when you are able to when you don't need a context switch and you're able to actually stay in one place, there's an efficiency gain. So how many different contexts is somebody required to operate it? How many different types of roles are they required? What how many different modalities are they required? If you can reduce those modalities down to the ones in which they're most efficient And certainly if you can eliminate the context switching. You you'll have an immediate gain now. You don't want to reduce context switches into over into a less efficient or less ideal scenario. This is another systems training.

# Test-Driven Development

## Feedback Loops, Part 2

[https://otter.ai/u/oczh53XUdlwHpVL5oBqUe5oO268](https://otter.ai/u/oczh53XUdlwHpVL5oBqUe5oO268)  
Not every accountability structure in business is a feedback loop. So if you're starting with tactical delegation, tactical delegation by itself is a tight feedback loop where somebody else watches you, you know, if you wanted to go that way, pause, do model, then somebody watches you do it. And it's a really tight feedback loop, then you loosen it up and you watch them do it. And then you loosen it up and you go look at the results of what they produce. And then you loosen it up and you start monitoring the outcomes and you loosen it up and you start evaluating more and more. And then as as you go up your chart and further tree, you're, you've got greater cycles, feedback loops based on the reliability and the predictability of the system. So the less reliable a system is, the tighter feedback loops, you gotta have to automatically error Correct. Or if it's of low consequence, if it goes rogue or sideways, then you don't need a tight feedback loop. You can just let it go. You know, go where it wishes. The issue with you look at this as a sliding scale. So for example, if you have somebody who is rogue then you need to tighten the feedback loop. If they make a mistake, then you just need to implement a feedback loop. And if you're a micromanager and they're actually more reliable than what you think then you need to loosen up the feedback loop or expand it and, you know, allow more space and distance if it's actually dialed in and working and so understanding that from a concept of scalability and from a concept of delegation, layers of workshop is is a really helpful perspective of how to apply feedback loops in the business. And so the same thing happens with marketing tests. If you're doing a wild off the wall test, then you need tight feedback loops to make sure that it's actually working and if you're, if you're doing shore shot tests, then you can loosen it up. So maybe maybe you're tweaking though the 1% or something and you can you know, maybe maybe it takes less taken to close on that. Or, for example, you're testing a new product and you need really, really tight feedback loops. And that's why you encourage people to actually talk directly with customers. But then if you as it scales, then you can use looser feedback loops and you can put entire sales teams in place. And that's why, you know, that's why you don't want to mismatch, the scalability with the certainty so if you have a highly uncertain thing, you don't want to scale it because it it creates distance in the feedback loop and it creates a wild variance. Now, another observation, which I need to take take to heart is that any place where you see variance is a place where there's not reliability and predictability where there's not a process where and that's where you need feedback loops and you need to you not not only need feedback loops, you need systems and processes to implement and build those feedback loops. And there you go. That's it.

## Firmware

You have think about firmware, and the things that get flashed on firmware, and if it gets interrupted, you’re in trouble – just like what Stephanie was saying about the 67-day habits

# Systems Deep Dive Pt 1 \- Training

So today we're going into delegation systems and email Deep Dive. And hopefully, this will be pretty interactive time, feel free to jump in and interrupt. And I'll try to keep my eye open on the chat and all those good, good things. The I wanted to just start a little bit with the inspiration before this, first of all, if if you do have specific things that you want out of this, it would be tremendously helpful for you to say, hey, I really want X or Y, there's some of the things that came through and some of the messages but and also, once again, feel free to jump in with, with some conversations or wisdom with questions as we go. So I committed to doing this, and this is one of those, you know, put together this parachute on the way down, and we can have a go, I had a conversation with a friend of mine who over lunch she was like, so what it is, what is it that you actually do? And I really want to understand why some websites scale and some websites don't and why is it so expensive to have millions and millions of video views, et cetera, et cetera. And it uncovered this whole line of thinking, and I realized that, that there's, there's been this whole way of thinking about the world and thinking about processing systems, it's become, it's been deeply innate. And and that conversation really helped to bubble a lot of those things up to the surface. And I say it not not strictly because somehow it was born with it. But because we'll get to that in a moment. The email actually originated from kind of a deep dive that I've been doing around what is my artistic selling proposition. And I realized that I'm in this kind of strange place where I think systems are actually part of my art that I create. And it's part of my my part of what I what I invent. My first invention was as a four year old, which I did not actually create. But as a four year old, I tweeted this, I sketched out the sandwich making machine. And I just thought about how much easier and better the world would be if we could all like, automatically make sandwiches without any kind of labor, any involvement like that, and how amazing it would be for the restaurant and all of those types of things. So from a really young age, I was always kind of looking to get out of work, and to do less. And a bit of, of laziness to kind of, hopefully productive laziness that set in, early on. Now along the way, I've been working with with my, my brother and I have been developing custom. Let me take one step back from that. And my background is in software development, wrote, wrote software helped banks, insurance companies manage bond investments, and was part of a part of a major initiative to take a Windows only product and make it natively available on the web, allowing the windows and web platforms to interact. And also, and, you know, do this whole thing without breaking anything massive undertaking. But it's positioned the company now to put themselves smack dab in the middle of a fantastic network as a result of as a result of that work.   
I've been working with my brother to take some of these same software, billing skills, skills and apply them to businesses, where we basically take a look at business process and and we build custom software around the business process to help streamline it. So from from age eight, when I first started programming, and throughout most of my career, I've been living and breathing systems and and systems have become deeply ingrained in kind of within me and how I how I think and how I operate. There's a variety of reasons for that. But all of these forces have kind of combined. And I've realized that I've been, this has gone way deeper than what I've actually realized at first. So that's a precursor in context. So where do we want to go from go today? There's, there's two things that I want to unpack. The first is just the system's perspective, which is what like, how do you how do you think how do you look at the world from a from a systems perspective, and have something that is deeply visceral, where you look at something, and you can see that system that's at play, you can see the system that work should be at play, you can see where the bottlenecks are, where the issues are the challenges, etc. And this is the, this is that massive brain explosion that I had, we could have to go after, after going out, out to lunch with my friend. And the second part of this and this is just assembling that body of knowledge into into a single cohesive unit and the second half, I'm gonna go into more of a practicum like how do you how do you actually apply this? What are the actual tools examples, all those parts and and as well as how to kick start this whole process and taking whatever time for q\&a. So part one systems perspective. I think one of the things It's really helpful to understand is that your business, this is coming from the perspective of your business being a system. And if it's about a system, it's about your business. So in this first section, we talk more broadly about systems. But if you have this kind of secondary line of thought, thinking about your business and how these things apply, I think you'll, you'll get some helpful insights along the way. I think if you boil down a system to its three basic steps, there is some kind of external input, there's some kind of internal transformation. And there's some kind of external output. Now, this can be as simple as a fulcrum, where you put your foot on a on a board, and that's the external input. The fulcrum provides the transformation, and it lifts something really heavy, on the other end, and that's the external output. Now, this also applies to business, there's some kind of external input, there's a customer who shows up, they, they provide you with some kind of input, financial plus, informational plus, all of that you provide, there's some kind of internal transformation, and you provide some kind of value, or some kind of output on on the backside of this. When you're sitting at a coffee shop, customer walks in, they place an order, that's an external input, and there's the process of making the coffee. And then there's the process of delivering it, that process of making the coffee is internal transformation, that process of delivering it is the external output. And then each, so within these within these pieces, there are three primary, three primary components that I see there's the information, that's, that's involved, there's the choices that are made. And then then there are the actions that are made. And using borrowing the famous kind of technical triangle perspective, there is, these are the these are the three components that are, that are deeply entwined within, within a system. So you can't have any meaningful system without information that's being processed. It's not really a meaningful system without some kind of, well, I guess there are meaningful systems without decision making. But within the context of what we're looking at here, decision making becomes, is part of it and the actual execution. So you have external input is information or in some cases, energy coming in, there is a internal transformation where there's a series of decisions and choices that are made to provide some kind of to provide some kind of action, which provides external output back out to back out to the person any any kind of questions or feedback, or anything on that piece of it?  
Alright, so, so, I want to talk to you because So, in this whole process, I came to understand that I looked at, at systems from a different perspective than some of my peers did when I was doing software development. And this is the myth of the operating manual. I think building effective systems is more than building some kind of step by step instructions or some kind of operating manual. Because if I observe good developers across across the scope, good developers think in linear step by step fashion, like what are the what are the tasks that need to be executed in order in order in order to make something happen, but great designers see all the parts, and they see how they interact. And I think that's the difference between kind of this tactical perspective and this systems perspective. And I think this is also one of the reasons why it's difficult to scale when you're working in the business, because when you're in the business, there is this, you're focused on the step by step tasks that need to be need to be executed, you're thinking very linearly. And when you step back from the business that gives you gives you the opportunity to look at that pieces in relation to the whole and allows you to see how they, how they interact. Yes, I will be happy to provide the slides and best with the recording. So what are some traits of great systems, great systems simplify the steps, step by step process. So one of the places this becomes super clear is in software, there's there's these layers of instruction that are very granular down at the bottom, you have the ones and zeros and then there are languages that are really complicated that make it a little easier, and then less complicated and even more easier, and then an even easier, and then there's apps that that hide all the programming practically from you. So Zapier is a great example, you can enter some simple prompts to connect all your accounts super simple, but there's layers upon layers underneath that because underneath the prompt, there are plugins that use the easier to learn languages like JavaScript or Python. And JavaScript Python is predominantly implemented in a language in a harder to learn language called C. And C gets translated into this impossible to understand machine code which is essentially the byte the ones and zeros that make it all work. This is not that dissimilar from how a business operates, because when somebody comes to you and they say, Hey, I want a, if you walk into a coffee shop and say, I want a caramel macchiato, and I would like a decaf, there's a certain in with this kind of milk, there's a certain set of steps that are hidden from you that the barista goes and implements. So that one simple instruction just ballooned into one to two dozen different steps of what's actually needed, or half a dozen steps maybe of things that need to be done in order to provide your coffee. And, and this is the this is how. So every great system hides, system series of systems, hide and simplify the step by step process. And by doing so they create leverage to make work more easily executed. Now, this also, this line of thinking also applies when you're working with different levels of, say, a corporate ladder or different organizational hierarchy, where the people at the bottom of the at the bottom of the tree are working very in much more tactical task driven, a much more tactical task driven basis, as you go up the tree. There's higher level instructions and, and higher level initiatives that encapsulate a lot of effort in a very small amount of space, I think it's also helpful understand that great great systems contain more systems. Again, computers using computers, as a great example, if you're running an operating system like Mac or Windows, then there is a, there are software suites like Microsoft Office that has have individual programs within that, such as Microsoft Word which have individual modules like spellcheck, with individual features like word highlighting, which with specific functions like checking a word spelling, and, you know, literally putting the highlight underneath it. And each of those is, is code that is broken down further and further into sets of sets of instructions. We see this within a business, you have the whole business as a system, but the marketing department is a system. And within the marketing department, the Google AdWords and Facebook are systems and within the delivery process, there's there's all of these systems that are are all at play. And not only that the business itself is part of a bigger system, which is called the economy, which is called the National the local economy, the national economy, the global economy. So, so systems relate with systems, and it means that systems are only meaningful if they interact outside of themselves. So there's a theorem that says that there's no sorry, I should have, I should have gotten this but in essence, systems need contexts outside of themselves, for them to be truly, truly meaningful. And, as I mentioned, just now, an example is businesses within your market. Now, there's an underlying structure to systems which means that if you can start to to recognize the underlying structure, you can start to identify you can you can identify where systems are at play, you see an orange charts you see it in your computer files and folders, you see it? What's the navigation, you see it in contents, nation states of Providence County cities, postal routes, see it McDonald's directors and more like, what's what is that structure. And trees, I believe, are the language of systems, which makes sense when you flip them. There's a global system. But if you flip them on the on its head, then you have an org chart. And this whole concept that you have, you have some kind of node, some kind of piece, some bigger hole that is divided into smaller parts, which is divided into smaller parts, or some kind of one thing that's responsible for more things which are responsible for more things, that is the foundational structure of systems. And when you're able to recognize when you're able to look at work, the work that you do from that perspective, when you're able to look at your business from that perspective, when you're able to look at any number of things from that perspective. I think that starts giving you the framework just to see and recognize systems where they existed where they made made us make, yeah, where they're at. There's this rule that overloaded systems want to divide. And if you try to grow a system past its capacity, it gets to an inordinate amount of complexity, it will stall, it will break and it will, it will begin to lose its function until you divide it and give it the freedom to, to subdivide and continue to grow. If you look at a branch, as the branch grows, it will continue to grow, it will sprout new branches, new branches, new branches, etc. You see this with overworked staff, that if you take somebody and you run them at 110% capacity, there's going to become a time at which they're going to crumble, they're going to stop performing, they're going to break down they're going to fill in the blank and what they want to do is they want to divide the responsibilities in one or more parts so that they can so so that the responsibilities and the work achieved can actually continue to grow. We see the same thing within a stagnant or a flooded market. So, if you have a market, that's that saturated, that's completely flooded, it's an invitation for fragmentation for division, which leads to growth. Somebody, somebody comes in and carves off a segment of the market, does whatever they want to do. And suddenly, there's, instead of just one market, there's two markets or more. We see this in terms of responsibilities. So all all tasks and roles that grow start is just a series of steps, these things that are doing, and as they grow and grow and grow and grow, you reach this point where there's this breaking point. And then you you get to evaluate and say, Well, what are the big categories of things that are happening as part of this role, or this, these responsibilities, and it allows you to carve off those pieces and continue, and then allow those individual parts to continue to naturally grow. As biology systems, it's organizations, it's, I think, pretty much natural law. And, and there's a there's an implication of this, which, which we'll, we'll touch on later, but we can touch on now, which is one of the most useful ways and useful places to delegate immediately is finding the most overloaded part of your system, and looking at where those natural dividing points are, and find and delegating out of that particular out of that particular spot. And so along with that, there is their fault lines that you hear. Live on the fly, as promised. So what are things that cause growth to stall out? Actually, I was going to skip this slide. But since we're here, what are the things that cause it to fail? If you don't have any kind of action, it's impossible to systematize and grow. If you don't, if you're not able to recognize the patterns within of the work that's being done, you're not able to delegate, you're not able to break those pieces apart. And certainly, if you can't delegate and spin those off, then you're stuck. So systems are like trees. And systems are also fractal which I mentioned earlier, there are systems within systems and systems have systems. And you can, you can zoom in very closely into a system and you can zoom out very macro level and a system becomes a very useful way of looking at the looking at the world.  
So as a result of that, as I was thinking of working on this on Friday, on Friday, it I realized that most of my work in systems in my best work in systems has always been related to tree structures. And it's always been, it's always had this 8020 element to it. And so I think systems are inherently 8020, or they inherently follow the Pareto Principle. I think they they follow the rules of stable versus unstable systems, which mean means that when they top like a 90 to 1090 10 ratio, that they become unstable. And I think they follow very into the power curve. So this sent me down the rabbit hole, which said, I believe there's a whole set of math that's related to, to systems and management. And there is if you so there's a whole set of questions that because of because organizations are tree structures, because they're practical. And because they apply the 8020 principle, there's a whole set of questions that you can ask that can can give you perspective as far as scalability, margin, work, expansion of a workload tying back into into scalability, stability, based on management, efficiency and labor overhead, or how many management layers you need to support a certain level of work output. So if you haven't, so I put together this little tool, if you have an organization of 100 people, and you have two levels of management we're using a in this particular case, we're using a formula with proximation but it requires approximately 10 direct reports per management position, which is very upper end of where you might want it to be. So we have 100 people 11 of which are in management and 89 of which are this is assuming an equal distribution across the entire organization 89 workers the management structure has has Ada 12 efficiency. If you if you increase the organization size 220 You increase to an average of 11 direct reports and you start entering these upper bounds of the ratio between the ratio between the work that's being done. And the management that's required to actually get the work done. increases. If you want to have, let's say you, you have two levels of management and you you are willing to go up to eight now eight, an average number of eight direct reports, it allows you to, that allows you to scale up to a structure that has 73 people, including 64 work, people who are workers 12%, management overhead and 80% 88%. Going towards the work that's actually being done. So. Hey, interesting questions, too, to go down the, to kind of go down that management. rabbit trail. Any any questions from any of them so far? Cool. So, way back, when we took a look at these at this different components, we took a look at the three components that I had in the triangle, one was communication, one was one was decision making, and one was action? Well, I think one of the things is really helpful to understand in terms of systems is that there are two two kinds of communication that lie on a scale. One is broadcast communication, and what is targeted communication.  
Think it's important to realize that these two types of communication happened very differently.  
Ah, radio, Kelly,  
and you can access the tool. So So with that, you have to understand that any, any communication system has a maximum bandwidth of communication, there is a volume, whether it's because of the person who's on the other end, whether it's because of for whatever reason, there's an issue of, of maximum bandwidth. So, so broadcasts communication is a one to many, like broadly broadcast communication, targeted communication is one to one higher friction. So take a look at product broadcast communication, it's low friction, lower quality, and high bandwidth. So you can you can, you can communicate a high volume of information in a very short amount of time. But communication works differently with with when you've maxed out the bandwidth communication attempts continue, regardless of available bandwidth. So even even if you've maxed out the bandwidth, there's still an attempt to continue to communicate. And it requires, it requires end users to filter out what is relevant to them. And if if it exceeds the maximum bandwidth, either you have to I mean, sometimes you can recognize it on the broadcasting side. And you can choose what you actually actually put out, or it just straight up this, this communication gets lost. A great example is all the times when you're sitting on a yeah, you're sitting on a zoom call, and somebody makes a comment about needing to go turn off the reset the router so that they kick off their teenage kid off the game so that they can get their bandwidth back. I mean, this is a case where there's this, this overload of, of, of communication, predominantly, in this case, broadcast communication, that is, that is using up the bandwidth and causing causing data to be lost signals to be dropped. So it can either be filtered or prioritized by the user agreement. Good example is radio where you get to tune into the into the station. But even with that, there's like there is limited bandwidth, you can only listen to one radio station at a time, or it's by the medium. So we all remember the days of Facebook, when you can see everybody's posts and all these things. And people have gotten used to this by now. But we also remember all the arguments about how Facebook was evil, and they're not hiding people's posts and et cetera, et cetera. Well, in reality, Facebook had reached its maximum capacity on broadcast communication, and there was no more capacity. And so they took it into their hands and said, Hey, we're going to filter and prioritize what has been communicated. So that to benefit us, rather than just allowing those these choices to be made randomly based on chance. Another example is lost emails, and we'll get to this in a little bit but the reasons why people's emails get lost is because they are in there's there's this noise of broadcast communication targeted communication is very different. It's high friction. It's high quality and it's low bandwidth. It's his communication slows based on the available bandwidth. So if you don't have the available bandwidth, the communication slows down. The classic case in point, can I get a meeting? No, you can't, because my buddy because I don't have bandwidth for meeting. It's more easily prioritize for essential versus non essential communication. In person, you know, person to person personal emails, sorry, in person meetings is what I meant to say here. Some kinds of, of certain types of email, postal mail, those are those are examples of targeted communication. There's a specific person or specific set of people that you're wanting to wanting to reach. And it's done with intent. Large volumes of broadcast communication will slow down targeted communication. This is one of the reasons why emails get lost in the inbox is because there is this barrage of broadcast communication, and the actual targeted communication isn't isn't being communicated. If you this is. So your your first rule of business when dealing with your email, which we'll get to this more in depth, but your first rule of business is to divide this between broadcast communication and targeted communication, if the only thing you implement right now is set up filters for all of your broadcasts communication and go squirrel them away everybody everywhere else, and set up your filters for email that you know is targeted information, you've you've immediately solved a major constraint in in your communication bandwidth in your email. This is also why the difference between broadcast versus targeted communication is also why you email a dozen people and get no responses. But if you actually text people directly, then you get them all decide to sign up. Because broadcasts communication adds to the noise targeted communication cuts through the noise. It's also why if you're ever in an emergency, you should call out, ask one bystander to help you instead of saying hey, would somebody please help me, you in the blue shirt help me out. So there's the there's the targeted and broadcast communication. But then there's also the internal versus external communication. And every healthy system has two areas of communication, internal communication and external communication. So internal communication is communication that happens within the system. It's, it's what the system needs to have within itself, so that it continues to function. But then there's the external communication, which is how it interacts with the outside world. So you have everything that happens within a department and all the department people within the department are talking to each other, but then the department needs to talk to somebody else and do another department, and that's external to the department. So it happens at a department level, it happens on a business level, there's all of the conversations that happen within a business, there's conversations that are external, where we're talking, talking with customers, and how the customer experiences it. As, as a, as a, as a system grows, as it grows to its capacity, the more the the more the the communication within this, that sphere continues to grow. So all of a sudden, you have this whole department that's chattering with each other, and there's this noise, and its relevance decreases, and you increase the broad the amount of broadcast communication. And so people start stop getting people stop hearing what they need to hear. They stopped comprehending all of those things. And the weird thing is, we already told you we sent this email, we did this, we did that. But it's not getting through, why is it because the system has, has maxed out its communication bandwidth, people are overwhelmed. And that's one of the signals that there's that there needs to be some kind of segmentation and breaking apart of some roles and tasks and responsibilities. When when the noise of the communication increases too far, the complexity of a system is proportional to the number of people you communicate with. So if you want to reduce complexity department, everybody in department a is talking to everybody in department B that's that's a lot of people talking to each other, reduce the number of people who have to communicate with each other, you'll you'll lower the complexity, the number of times you have to communicate them, or you communicate communicating with them constantly, or is there are there? Is it daily? Is it weekly? Is it monthly? Those that reducing the number of times that you need to communicate will overcome complexity and the types of communication that you have with them? Are you communicating with them about a bajillion different things? Or is there a set of a small set of segment, small, small categories of things that you communicate with them? So looking at the so reducing the number of people, times you need to communicate and the types of communication will help lower the noise within within an environment. And by the way, broadcast communication and noise in environments is one of the reasons why people don't get creative inspiration, inspirational ideas, and so if you're not getting enough creative inspirational ideas, then reduce the number of people you communicate with and reduce the times you communicate with them and reduce the types of communication that you outwork them. A simplified system removes as much external communication as possible without compromising the utility of the system, I think, think there's there is a thing of over optimization where you optimize, optimize, optimize a system to so far that it becomes unstable, which is what we see with at the moment that you get 10 or more direct reports, you've crossed the threshold into an unstable system, and you've optimized it too far. And it's going to break. Awesome. Jay, you okay? Along with this with communication information, you have to understand that there needs to be some kind of source of truth, which are two, apparently competing, but important realities that healthy systems require a single source of truth. And healthy systems require redundancy. So one of the challenges that we often solve in terms of software is everybody has different ideas about when this product is gonna be delivered, or when this this thing is supposed to be supposed to happen or some other thing like, there has to be one source of truth for what, what is the state of this thing? And, and the more variance you have, in that information, the more trouble that you create operationally, healthy systems also require redundancy, I think having a single just because you have a source of truth does not mean that you have, you need to have a single point of failure. What happens if you put all your information into an existing Excel spreadsheet, or you're scheduling information into a single Excel spreadsheet, and you lose the spreadsheet? Well, there's ways to have redundancy so that you don't lose lose a spreadsheet, even though you have a single source of truth. So questions on communication? Good.  
All right. system based decision making, I want to distinct distinguish between human decision making and complex decision making versus based decision making. Because yes, Jay,  
before, before we leave that I just wanted to comment. When you talked about do we want to improve communication, that we have to eliminate the number of people or things that we're doing that is a a critical thing, for getting memos or for understanding, because you have to have some time to stop and think about new ideas and what you're wanting what you're looking for, out of out of the people or the audience that you're trying to connect with. And, and that just made me realize that there are groups of people that, that I have to limit the number of people in that group that I communicate with, in order to have a better impact on the group. So thank you for sharing that.  
Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for the feedback, Jay.  
All right. So the system based decision making, there's a difference between intelligent decision, like, I guess, intelligent decision making and non intelligent decision making, and I'm going to basically categorize system based decision making as as decision making that's designed for anticipated events. So systems become overbearing, when they universally apply decision making an actions to inappropriate situations, we've all been part of a chat bot, or part of some kind of phone experience, or some kind of customer service experience where, well, here's the rule. And so because this is the rule, this is what's going to happen, and shame on you for asking anything different. And, you know, we're gonna smack you over the head and make you make you follow this, this procedure. The reality is that systems can only account for when you build systems, they can only account for things that you can already anticipate. And if you anticipate any exceptions to that, then you can account for the exceptions and then handle the exceptions and how the exceptions should work. But there's some some situations in within within business that I think can be can be helpful. That, you know, just just as examples, if you're as you're building out business business process, it might be that certain recurring invoices only get set and sent over a certain dollar threshold or that refunds are always pre approved under a certain set of conditions or that there's a certain amount of discretionary money that can be spent to keep the customer happy or, you know, any number of any number of boundaries. So your question is asked regarding this kind of system based decision making if you're wondering if if there's a I think one of the ways that you can detect a lack of this is when there's a lot of fires to be to be fought a lot of questions to be answered. There's, there's a lot of things that come bubbling to you for for a response and feedback. So some helpful questions to ask around these are what are the boundary conditions that we need to enforce here? What is too much? What is too little? What is too frequent? What is too infrequent? What are the enumerate the possible scenarios of the common scenarios that could happen in this particular case? What should happen in the what should happen in the exception case? Etc. Don't really have a whole lot to add to that system base execution is also designed for for predictable, repeatable actions must be clearly defined, I think it's fair to note that it can be based on machine or human automation. And if you look at that, from the context of a business than Yeah, there are certain tasks that not all tasks should be should be automated by machines, there are some tasks that should be automated by people instead of machines.  
This is like the surface of kind of this, this whole thing that like kind of unpacked is kind of going into this and I don't know, any, any part of this that that would be helpful for you guys to go. To go deeper into. Can you just go back to questions to ask for just a moment? I went, I was didn't. Okay, let me just read this again. Too fast the first time? Yep. Okay, thanks.  
I think if there ever is a encore to this, or a sequel to this, I suspect there's there's some really interesting things about how you work with systems and how do you refactor systems? How do you rearrange parts? How do you prevent systems from breaking in the middle of changes, and those those types of things. So part two, where this actually gets practical, and this is where I think this is probably the piece where I struggled the most, to be fully transparent, I struggle the most with the and to close to what I'm doing to actually it's almost like a fish in water kind of problem. And so hopefully, this is as thorough as, as it's probably going to serve as can be, hopefully, it's still helpful. And hopefully, together, we can continue extracting. If you look at the basic, if you look at that business, as a system, it's a really simple system, it's a way of attracting customers, it's a tray, it's a way of fulfilling those, it's, it's a way of repeating that, if possible, that's like, extremely basic thing, but then there's an In addition, there's all of these supporting functions that that go along with that, that don't really fit in that, but nothing else can happen without that. And, and, and like I mentioned before, systems are fractal. So each each of those subsystems within systems. One of the things that is I think it'd be helpful to understand and how to start looking at delegation is, is understanding that there is a once again, value systems are fractal or organizations are fractal. There's at the upper end of the of the orchard, there's the highest value work that's being done. And there's this continual push down the tree of or down the down the chain of lower value work and there's this continual push out off to the side of things that shouldn't be done. And at the very bottom, if you optimize from top to bottom, at the very bottom, you have low value work that can be the lowest value work is almost always the requires the least level of sophistication of training, decision making. And it is usually ends up being the easiest part of the entire process to to automate at some level. So we're gonna talk a little bit about delegation styles. And how to delegate I think one of the one of the one of the challenges that shows up sometimes is really around this. I have the stuff in my head, I don't know how to get this stuff out of my head into somebody else's heads, they can actually do something practically with it. So each of us has a preferred teaching style, speaking writing diagramming and doing and demonstrating. So there's some people prefer to verbally explain what's going on. And some people prefer to have some kind of written communication. Like, here's the, here's the article, or here the steps or here's the information. There's the diagramming the flowcharts. The structure, the connections, like show me the, show me how these pieces fit together. And then, and by doing that I can help you understand or there's the come watch me, look over my shoulder, watch me do it somehow or other, and I will be able to teach you to do it that way. But don't ask me to use words to explain or don't ask me to write it down on paper. And similarly, there's corresponding learning styles, which is, do you prefer to learn by listening? Do you prefer to learn by reading, if you prefer by looking at visuals and flowcharts? Do you need to know how a thing is structured in order to learn? Or do you need to actually be kinesthetically engaged, like you have to, to watch and to do and to get your hands on something? And, and so with this, there's a question of? So with that, there's a question of, well, not only do you want to know the learning style, the teaching style and the learning style, but you also want to know, if you're looking at implementing process within a business, you want to understand what format Do you want it in? Should this be pictures? Should this be video? Should this be tech? Should this be audio? Should this be fill in the blank? Like how? What should How should this be structured? And I think this comes down to a matter of priorities. And a matter of of I mean, it's it's? Well, it really comes down to a matter of priorities. So what's more, most important is it is it most important for you to get for you to be able to offload quickly and quickly create these kinds of processes that other people can take over. Is it important for you and or them to be able to quickly update them? and modify them? Keep them up to date? Or is it more important for it to be fast for them? Do they need to be able to quickly consume it the first time? Or do they need to be able to quickly come back and review it and fill in the gaps? And so with that, that determines the retention style? Do you want to do you want this information? Do you want your processes documented as spoken words, written words, charts and diagrams or videos and pictures?  
Any kind of moving through this really quickly does that. That line of thinking makes sense to you guys. Good. So then once you understand that, you can understand what tools you want to use for that. And there's just a whole set of tools that you can do such as recordings, transcriptions, using your phone, whiteboards, charts, my mind maps, documents, chat, text, message, email. So here is another tool set that I put together around delegation style, which is around the question of, how do you prefer to teach? So So let's say that, that somebody prefers to teach by diagramming and outlining the structure. And the most important thing is that we need people to be able to continually come back and look at this and review it. And they're delegating, but they're delegating to somebody who prefers to learn by listening. Okay, so this is a little bit of a curveball at the end. So your preferred style is diagramming and diagramming is the style that is the fastest to continually review and come back to. And because that's your preferred style, you don't need to translate it into in order to put it into a business process. But so you can build out your diagram and invite other people's feedback to finalize it. But because you're delegating to somebody whose preferred style is listening, they may need help translating this into speaking. And just some quick tips on tools that you can use such as recording photos and calls or auto in reference options. So, you may you may put together a flowchart of how this functions and then record yourself explaining this or they may have somebody record their explanation, and they may keep that as, as their resource or go to on on that particular resource. Or we can start over and say I prefer to teach by by writing and now let's let's do it Do I prefer to stage by by speaking, and I want this to be fast to continually update, and the person who, I'm delegating it to somebody who does best by watching and doing. And so your preferred style of speaking, but writing is the style that's fastest to continually update. So you'll need to translate from speaking to writing the best way to do this use otter or rev to turn your speech into text and edit it in its final form. And you may need to help somebody who's translating this into demonstrating or doing or they, they may be able to go through those instructions and be able to, to translate it themselves and get it into the muscle memory. So once again, for speaking, capturing these by recorded calls or transcriptions, for writing, again, depends on whether you're refer this to be the initial draft to be kind of dynamic, or whether you're trying to put together a finished product right out of the out of the gate. But this can be assembled from Word documents, chat transcripts, text messages, emails, etc. And then for demonstrating and doing it could be that you go ahead and get that recorded as a step by step instructions. And then as a secondary level you do something limit recording, or include pictures or videos so that people can visually see what's going on. Kelly, your question?  
If this doesn't seem to remain valid means stupid, but you made me think of the fact that if I build a spreadsheet, you know, and Google Sheets or something, um, it's come out of my brain. And so how it works and what its intentions are is clear to me. But I'm also aware of how painfully disorienting it can be to suddenly be confronted with a spreadsheet built by someone else. So maybe the simplest analogy in terms of what you just described is that for me, having someone talk through saying like, here's what's here, and here's why it's here. A minute of that probably spares me 20 minutes of angst and confusion. Yep. Yep. It's a great example. Any  
any feedback or questions from you guys on delegation style? Good.  
All right, so then, what actual tool sets do you use to put these put these things together? There's actually something that I think it's better to start with, which is, I think anytime that you're building out tools or resources for your team to be able to implement process, delineated structure at there's, there's a few pieces that are important, I think it should be easy access should be easy to search, easy to categorize, categorize, easy to update. And if it's hard to get to, it doesn't become part of the central workflow. If it's hard to find what it is you're looking for, again, it has very low utility. If there's not some kind of logical order or structure to it, then things just kind of fall apart and become disorganized. And when there's no way to update these things, then well, then what's your plan? So Kelly, in your example, here's the spreadsheet. So you can have the spreadsheet living here, you can have the audio file, and, you know, if you want transcript right beside it named identically to the file, like that's a very simple way to make it easy to access, easy to search, easy to categorize. And if you're dealing with audio and you have a transcript, then it actually makes it quite easy to update because you can modify the transcript and then go off the updated transcript. And you have a new audio version of that. As far as actual tools, I think there's anything can work, anything can fail. We've seen people use things like Google Drive or Dropbox, notion, process Street. We're a custom software shop. So we use our own database platform, our own project management tools, our own wiki, email reminders, to tie these pieces together. So as an example, when we're when we're spinning up a new task in the project management system for client engagement, we're able to copy the template from from our documentation over here, and the template lives within our business documentation. And it gets copied into the, into the tasks of the project we go through, check things off, get things done. And if there are any changes, then we go back, if there are any issues that that come up that can be fixed with better process, then we go back into our documentation and say, Hey, after we complete step three, we should also do this other thing, and make sure that this issue doesn't happen again. Within the the wiki, we have a tree structure, not surprisingly, of documentation. And we'll get into categories of how we do that. Different different things, we document different types of training.  
job descriptions, live there. And then we also have this tool set around email reminders, which were basically, you know, the first, this is predominantly useful for administrative types of tasks. But it's also useful for other types of things as well. So that you know, every, every Monday, you know, they're every third Monday of the month, like, here's the set of tasks that need to be done for that. And this can be tied into a project management system. There are other ways to do this. But having that kind of recurring. Having those recurring reminders, so as it kind of broke down, what are the different customization tools that we use along the way within the process? Again, software is something that you think of something that's highly custom. But there's actually a lot of there's a lot of repeatable process within within this entire role within the process. So what are some of the tools? Here's the list. And I'm going to just go through them one by one and talk about that a little bit. Checklists, checklists, are great tools to verify work, look for things that can go sideways, things that are really important that actually happen. Did the money make it to the bank? Did the did the? Did we collect the, you know, once we signed on a client, like, do we have all of the relevant materials from the client? Once we've fulfilled on a on a project? What are all the things that actually need to be done? And so we have some very into this on, or actually multiple, multiple sets of this where, you know, in the onboarding process, there's, there's like these reusable checklists, but then even within the projects that we deliver, there's certain checklists that we build out before before, actually, that are that are specific to the project that that we build out and go over before it actually ends up being delivered to to the client.  
Yeah, templates, what are places where we're often often building the same thing twice, or writing the same thing twice, or putting the same thing together multiple times. So certain types of emails that are constantly being sent the same? Same way? And because you Mr. Markers, like this isn't, this isn't rocket science, we're familiar with the site with this idea. But what are certain types of client documents or certain types of reports that we're putting together? Similarly, that are basically the same thing, the same way different times, within within our. And there's, there's certain, certain templates that we use within our system design process that become reusable. Training for onboarding. So I think one of the questions here is, what's the baseline skill that you will hire? There's no reason to, if you're hiring somebody with this specific what the expectation is, they have a specific knowledge, obviously, you don't have to have any kind of training for that. But is there? What do you want them to know about your culture? What do you need to know about the process? And what about job specific skills that we need to develop  
in the along the way. And this is, this is  
something that deserves a spot in the slides. But one of the things that's incredibly useful when it comes to building out systems and process is the rule of three, which is basically that you should never try to systematize or automate or do anything like that until you've done something at least three times. And because what's going to happen is you do it once the first time and you're gonna do it kind of right. And then the second time, you're going to realize that there's this other thing that's kind of different, but by the third time, you've actually recognized that, well, here's the things that are that are the same about everything. And here are the things that are different and these are the things that I can extract And these can actually be repeatable. And I can handle handle this off to a VA. One of the places I see people going sideways with virtual assistants is like trying to take these one off tasks that they've barely even mastered themselves and trying to break it down into something that's very tactical for a virtual assistants to do. And then the virtual assistant goes off the rails and nobody knows why. So the rule of three is tremendously helpful. So this particular piece, depending where you're at, has less, has less press less relevance. And then for some of the others in the knowledge base, this is one of the things that we that we opted to do, which is having our having our training actually having a training actually serve as a knowledge base as well. And so there's the the training process is, can be our entire training, you can go through the slides of the training, and go through the individual pieces of the training, or you can search the search for specific pieces of information that you need, such as you know, there's product knowledge, etc, what you need. process and process documentation. These are little ones sheets and things that need to be done repeatedly and can be handed off by somebody else. And and if they're actually documented, then somebody else can take it over. And so it's it's a simple document that has a clear title and single sentence overview and multi step instructions. And here's how it takes you. You just can't screw it up. And if it's wrong, and you go fix it and tweak it and update it. It's a It's a living document. email reminders, what are the things that need to be done on a recurring schedule? What are the things that easily get forgotten? Because they're infrequent? And what are the things that happen on a calendar basis, not a project basis. Different things happen on different timelines. And so keeping your eye out for those things can free your mind from keeping track of all of that job descriptions. Again, there's not really that much to add to this, you know, general categories and explanations for the roles, process for periodically reviewing and updating the job descriptions as well, I might add some of the process documentation if you're not actively using it. Sometimes it some things are used more actively than others. And so if it's not accurate, we use sometimes drift out of dates. And there's a whole bunch of additional software tools that you can use, such as survey tools, or Zapier or Google scripts or spreadsheets or like something custom if you want to or Jillian other bajillion other other ways to do that. Any questions on the I guess, the tool sets  
I think one thing that did not make it in slides that I think would be helpful to note that. You know, I think there's a lot of value in finding the low hanging fruit and pursuing what I would call tack tactical delegation, which is basically when you look at your, you look at your, your, your total span of things that you're doing, and you break that apart, and you find the low hanging fruit that you can hand off, breaking that the the lowest value work that you're doing is the work that you should offload first, and is usually the easiest work to to actually offload. And those are the pieces that can be most easily broken out into some kind of simple repeatable process that can be that can be handed off to handed off to somebody else. So what are types of categories and examples that we have within our documentation? There's kind of two ways to think about this. There's a, what is the, you know, kind of what, what, what department or what part of the businesses this does this fall into? And so we categorize a bunch of stuff from that perspective. You know, what are the what are the things that are documented regarding regarding marketing or sales or delivery and fulfillment or client support? Supporting functions? Real training?  
Yeah, Mark, process through another SAS tools for workflow. I do not have a question. I don't have a good resource for you on getting a decision towards third party processes and tools, but I will be happy to follow up on that get back to you. So what are some examples of things we put into our sales documentation? What are common objections? How do you frame people's perspective when they're looking to buy? What are proper analogies to use? What is the most important sales training that really matters the most Um, information about delivery fulfillment of the product. practical things like how do you take payment? How do you hand off? Once you've made a sale? How do you hand off the, the client to, to the next person? What's, what's the process for following up with, with leads? Delivering fulfillment, there's certain internal tasks that need to happen and and it ties into into the project management. What's the onboarding process? What's the onboarding call agenda? What are the call schedules going on from that? What's the pricing on the upsell and or next step for the client? Client Support once again, we have we have templates, certain types of common issues that people face or internal tutorials and troubleshooting, like how do you troubleshoot client client issues or product? Product documentation? What are specific features that the clients need to use? I know this is a little different, because we're coming from a software software standpoint, but these are still documenting this common client client questions and and if you if you want to, some of these can be made available to the client and give them easy access to that. It's pretty functions. I mean, like what's your hiring process? What's your this is just super high level and there's people that get way more sophisticated than this. But what's your interview process? Your your what's your job listing process? How do you create a job listing? How do you know when it's time to hire? Let's go way back to the beginning. And by the way, what accounts do you need to create for them? And what's their first day look like? And you know, all of that? What are all the legal pieces that that need to happen? Internal tutorials? What are specific tools that we use as a team? How do you how do you request paid time off? It's a bajillion other things we have a daily and weekly check in process with our team. How do those work? You know, we have we use virtual reception for for our calls. So there's a very detailed process about how calls, inbound calls get handled. job descriptions, which I mentioned earlier.  
Yeah, any questions on kind of those broad categories of category? Yeah, just categories.  
Okay, let's talk about email. Email is probably is probably one of the things that showed up showed up the most frequently is, hey, we need help with this. This is overwhelming. How do we fix this? I think it's I think there's some basic mindset things that come into this or just perspective coming to this, it's super helpful. One is, you need to understand that email is a communication tool. It's not a project management tool. And email is prioritized by recency and urgency, not based on actual priority. And the more that you rely on your email inbox to prioritize and manage your tasks, the more likely you are to become reactive, because it's not intended so that it's intended for communication. I talked about earlier about this whole thing of your email has two types of communication, it's broadcast communication, and it's targeted communication. And the sooner you do that, the more you can do to filter those out, then the more you can cut through the noise and then get to the root of it. So you can set up automation, for unpaid invoices to there's certain sets of of invoices that we can come in, like send them, send them to a filter, so you can review them on an ongoing basis, if there's if there are receipts, like send those to where they need to go. So that so that those are archived appropriately. I've broken my subscriptions into daily, weekly and monthly, and if if it's not something that I should look at, you know, daily, or like these things that I really value this and it's quality input on a on a, you know, maybe not exactly every day, but on a on a regular basis. And weekly is like lower quality input. And periodically, I'll put my head in there and see what's going on what's interesting, and then monthly is like one of those things that I probably shouldn't unsubscribe, to unsubscribe from but I for whatever reason, there's this little thing in the back of my head that I want to give myself permission to stay subscribed and so I put it in the monthly and if you don't make it on that list, then I'm sorry, you're you're out. And you know and then there's the by the way, who are all the people who really deserve Hi, access to me directly. And their emails can can go to the top of the list and so there's a personal review folder where all of those things go in and unsubscribe from everything is possible and really ought to unsubscribe or review the kind of weekly in monthly things on certainly daily, but it's probably less likely to change change in the weekly and monthly. So the 20 filtering is at filters for individual subscriptions. And it's, it's useful to match on the address on the front address, as well as the address and unsubscribe tag text so that you actually are filtering out real broadcast mail and not personal email from the list owner. And you put them in the right subscription folder, then you add folders for partners, team members, and most important clients, or long term clients into your personal review folder, if that's actually where they where they need to go. And you can help this process by very simple, easy step. And I don't pretend to have taken this super far, but a very easy next step is having an assistant pre process some of that email and go through and unsubscribe to things that you shouldn't be subscribed to and keep your eye open for important things. And, you know, and such. And I think the other piece, so So that just by doing that, you do nothing, nothing more than that. You've separated broadcasts communication, meaningful broadcast communication, and you prioritize broadcast communication. And you've separated it from targeted communication that you actually want to pay attention to. And then you have this other bucket over here, that's just noise and probably 95% of it, you don't actually need to do anything with or you need to unsubscribe or just get rid of the noise, but you, you created some segmentation. Now, how do you effectively deal with the things that you actually need to deal with, and this is probably stuff that any other great productivity guru will, or any great productivity guru will tell you. And it just took me a while to catch on. I don't know. But some of the some of the helpful distinctions for me has been knowing whether something is Is this something that's actually just informational in nature? Or is this actionable in nature? Was just informational, then then send it away? And, well, if it's actually backup, if it's informational? Is it something that needs to be filed away somewhere? Is there someplace where I need to come back and find this? And if so, then it's a short email to, to my system to say this, like, let's, this seems to be filed away? Or if it's? If it's informational, I just know I know it, then it can disappear. And I can always search for the email later. If it's actionable than then when and how does that need to be action? Does it need something in the calendar? Does it need something in the project management system? Or? Or does this require some kind of immediate follow up and let's set up a call or fill in the blank? One of the things that I found myself, for whatever reason, perhaps, you know, perhaps personality, perhaps, who knows why I often find myself getting stalled on trying to make decisions on emails where I did not have sufficient information. And I think one of the things that has become really useful for me is to allow other people to shoulder as much of the of the responsibility as possible, and where there's insufficient information, but putting it back on their shoulders to get the information that I needed in order to make a decision, or if there's some kind of follow up required to put that off on other people's shoulders. Certainly, where appropriate, but, but having that as a lens has been tremendously helpful. And then last of all, is this actually a current? Is this a current priority? There's, there's two senses in that one is, if if we don't do anything about this, will the problem go away? And sometimes problems do? Or is this something that's perceived? You know, it's it was top of mind, it's not actually current priority, it's just showing up on the radar because just showed up on somebody's brain, and it's, and we're looking at it now. So going back to some of the previous discussions about email and being project management. And, for sure, like we could, there's way more that I could or could be doing with email, if I really chose to, this is kind of landed on a happy medium for where I'm at as far as like, touching email, but not getting buried in it. So that's kind of where we're at. Any, any questions on an email?  
Good. Alright, so the where to start? So let's say that you actually want to begin working on systemization. You want to implement more process you want to delegate you want to offload fill in the blank, where do you start and what do you do? And so, this is this is the this is this is the Part of the here's the here's the invitation to go deeper, I guess one of the things that I did, that I did over the last 60 days is we build out a time X ray processing tool, where we walk through your activities. And we we, we get an accurate perspective of your time, and break down your highest value activities, your lower value activities. So highest value activities you should focus on including the ones you should start doing. Or you want to start doing the lower value activities of what you need to let go of, and the measurable impact to your your stress, weekly schedule and hourly impact. Output, one of the things that we found is that, unlike the carry around a timesheet for for and keep track track of all your time for 15 minute intervals, and do that for a week, so that you come back at the end. And you actually see all these times were like all these things you should be doing, which can be quite helpful. This is kind of the collapse condensed version of that where we do this within within about an hour. And the pattern very strongly emerges. And usually there's kind of this 8020 of how you're spending your time that requires requires focus. And then there's a question of, yeah. So it's kind of it's a guided process plus software tool tool that we that we walk through to get that. I've been doing a handful, this is something that I pre sold, we had an executive director whose last six months were focused specifically on delegation, and not doing things he shouldn't. And with that, there were there were a few finds that we had one was a meeting that he was hanging on to that he wasn't he had not yet that he needed to let go of and adjust. And because of the impact other people he, you just had not yet started looking at options for what to do with that. And there are also a series of meetings that he was part of it that he realized he really didn't actually need to be part of. We had a salesperson who no lie, was spending 19 hours a week fixing other people's problems, process problems, operational problems, all of these other things and kind of playing the Savior in the business. And when she recognized what she was doing, she realized that her somewhat aggressive sales goals that our sales manager and said would be completely doable if she would stop trying to fix operational problems that aren't actually her fault. And so just setting some boundaries around how she's planning to spend her time. Got her completely changed her mindset on her on our work and our sales goals. There's another Operations Manager. So this is not something that we've implemented, but finding a way to increase hourly value by 49%. These are these are self reported approximations, getting stressed at about half and getting a role time at the job by 21%. So that's the time X ray. If that's interesting, if that's interesting to you, send me an email and we can we can talk about that.

# Systems Deep Dive PT 2 \- Q\&A Discussion

So that was much less than three hours.  
That's kind of the end of what I've put together here.  
The completely open need to go as long as you guys want questions about systematization, about process donation, automation, any of that email, or around more blue sky things like artistic selling propositions or about?  
I don't know. Anything really? So bad thoughts? Yes, Jay? So what was your perceived outcome? For monetizing what you're doing today? So the perceived outcome for monetizing is?  
Well, there so there's two pieces of this? That's a great question. I think number one, I think I think the time is X ray, during the time time X ray. And, and walking through that process is, is one potential Ave. To be honest, going into this, I wasn't planning to monetize, really, in any way, or even make any kind of offer whatsoever. I was like, these are cool people, and they're gonna help me get this stuff out of my head, we should go spend some time together.  
Going deeper, there's this question of, you know, there's there's the, the, okay, I should, you know, it's kind of the classic of, hey, I think I'm good at something, I should be able to teach other people how to do this. And well, yeah, you kind of can, and you can kind of get an insight into how your how my brain works. But there's also how many years of having been molded by probably someone who you would not conventionally, who kind of falls into the non conventional engineer perspective, and you kind of develop this visceral, unusual, unique ability of looking at things that only emerge because you're you. So the other avenue or path is just kind of is  
working more directly in terms of how do you like beyond just what we talked about even more practical nuts and bolts, how you actually get this stuff done, so that you can implement this.  
Cuz one of the things that I do is, is when I see a situation, I, I look at ways that it can be monetized. And I see what you have developed as, as there's multiple things that you could put into just a little bit more automation, some of the some of this systematizing, that you already have the basics in place, that could turn into a, a revenue generator or profit generator for you that would not require time away a much as much time away from your existing business. So I think I think you really put a lot of time and effort into this. And I think, I think what you've done is very valuable.  
So I mean, I would love to have you expand your line of thought a little bit more, if you'd be open to that, well, I kind of like have to go back through the slides because that there were just different things that stuck out. But one is is the the time X ray, that is something that could be a tool that could be automated, where people could do like a self test, and then you could you could review that and get back to them with with some some challenges some ways to do improve what they're doing. Then to take that a step further, you could even get people that that have a already have a coaching business or something like that, and then do a white label for them for that product for that industry and give them a complete exclusive for that industry if they maintain X number of customer's going through it or something like that, so that so that you're compensated each time they use it. And if they don't use it enough, then use it to somebody or give it to somebody else. Just using a thing that's popped in my mind was, I've used many bas from from the Philippines who are articulate speaking English, well even have a masters that and, and you can get them to do a lot of things by offering to go in and set up an email pro filters for people that are, quote, too busy to do it themselves, then they're I mean, there's, there's just ways to expand on the systematizing that builds credibility with what you're doing. And it just kind of solidifies them and then becoming a client that will just mine, basically what it's a different subset of what Perry does. I mean, I understand everything that Perry has to do right now, even though it doesn't apply to me, because he's bringing ideas. And so he has an audience of 1000s of people like, like us, that you could that you could develop your own audience and, and then share more things.  
That's helpful. Appreciate it, Jay. So good, good, good.  
Um, I was just gonna say, you know, there were a lot of big ideas. I was seeing all kinds of things in your first slides. But you know, that jumped out at me is like, this is like a meme, quote, you know, what I mean? Where you see six words, and you're like, dang, that's a lot to think about. So, um, so I guess I just want to affirm that you're, like, what you've recognized about your unique context, tying different things together, like that does to somebody like me, that has lived the life and a completely different context like it, it's, it's landing for me is, like, really interesting and fresh, and a whole different perspective or angles. So thank you for that. And yeah, I'll, I'll be intrigued by listening to the replay again, like riding my bike and letting it all soak in in a different way.  
Got a,  
I'll add on to that a little bit. Go for him. Thank you. So if I take the sections, right, so you had you know, systems of production, that we have the stuff and then it's, you know, the actual tools and techniques? If I just look at the tools, this last piece, more or less the tools, right, systematizing, you know, email doing things like that. Stand Alone, if I took a stand alone, I don't see a lot of differentiation there between what 1000 other people do, right? So what I would look for, you know, what I'm suggesting you do is look at that first section, and like Kelly was talking about lots of things in there. But one of the one of the differences, that having those mindset, that systems mindset and the sub parts of the system mindset make and doing the prioritization, doing deficiencies and everything else, because that's the actual difference, the differentiation between you and you know, the bazillion of efficiency and time people out there, they're just recommending kind of the same stuff, right? So in going through it. First art was strong, but didn't really get that connection, right about why I should consider the tool is separate, right?   
Because that's a cool thing. You know, the X ray is kind of like a separate deal that's separate, but all the rest of them. It just, it just didn't have the connection there. Like if I just take any one of those slides say Okay, in this, what's the what's the differential for a client or a customer, anyone I want to influence about having a systems view, versus just taking those tips which, you know, if I Google all five, right? I mean, just engineering for I'm not saying the next level, and you're talking to somebody and implementing, it's not going to be there. I'm just saying in the way you presented it today, right? There's all this cool stuff up front and I get the other and it's kind of like, well, I'm not like I'm not seeing it. And so that's why I think, you know, issue you now when you haven't done it today and you go back to recording is think about or your notes is okay. Then when Kelly said and when others have said, Oh, that's a gem right, you know that Jay said and you know things that Kelly is looking for the things that you know, so what are the things that stand out? But what are the implications? I'll give you an example. So you mentioned earlier, I can't remember if we talked about that or not, the idea about refactoring, and how that's applied to software systems, but how it can also apply to organizations? Well, guess what? Every single change that leaders make in an organization involves refactoring of some level. Right? So that's a huge area and a huge implications for a systems thinking, you know, if I go back to it, so you know, there are lots of things like that I'm just, I'm not dissuading you from talking about the email and everything else, right, from an efficiency standpoint, but maybe to Jay's point. And maybe if you leave the x ray is a intro tool, or some way to get into the Matthias universe. And then the coaching consulting needs to be something that's differentiated from all the vast number of others. So that was a little bit long. I just, that was kind of the overview of how I was feeling Yeah, thinking through it and listening to what you're saying.  
So if I can, if I can kind of talk it back to you, it's kind of like  
I think I think there's this there's this frustration that I've had with most of the teaching, which is here the tools to go do it. But there's not a lot of how should I actually be thinking about this as I approach it? And then when I think about doing a training, it's like, well, how do I actually make this practical, if I don't, you know, go recap all of the How to Use of what everybody else is already talking about.  
Now, so let's let's, let's take one of those tools. So for instance, if let's take the reverse, maybe if you just as a thinking possibility here, I take all those how tos? Well, maybe for each one of those how to she put a statement about, if you don't do this with a systems perspective, here's all the bad juju that can happen, right? Here are all the errors and the holes that you can fall in. Now, you can go backwards from that and say, okay, here, you know, you can do the connection and do the other stuff. Because you know, there's all that stuff, that's not going to happen. I mean, a great example, from a systems point of view is someone will take the current mode topic of transformation, everybody wants to do transformation, but they only want to change a little bit of this process over here, right? Without thinking about the big picture of does that affect everything, they'll just take some tool from somewhere, apply it and hey, they're not getting the results they want. Why? Because they didn't consider the connection to the rest of the organization as a system. Okay, so that's what you're describing about the tools. But that is what then I would focus and make obvious, and I didn't make it as obvious as I should hit earlier. Right? When you're talking about the tools and how to make it different about eight. If you do this, well, you might make this impact. But guess what, you're missing all these other things out here, you know, by not taking the system's view, especially if you're doing it on a larger level, or one impact on a larger level.  
Does that help? Yeah. I got one question in the chat.  
One person's business currently I want to expand, I've gone as far as I can, by using occasional freelancers. I develop e commerce websites and digital ad campaigns are the typical problems you need to avoid by expanding best size recommended management systems, Asana, etc. concedes that some of your slides were very relevant to my situation. Well, here's something that's really interesting.  
Regarding expansion, sorry, wrong one, this guy. Let's say that your organization size is two. And you have one level of management. Well, you have   
two people, and one worker, and your management structure is 50%. Management 50% work. And now is it true that you can split your time doing some work? Yep. But you're going to be surprised how much time you start spending actually running the machine. So one of the mistakes that people make with this is not having enough margin early on, and like you need proportionately higher, the smaller your bid As the more margin you need proportionally in order to scale, because well, first of all, as soon as you introduce your first team member, you introduce a significant amount of overhead, management overhead. And, and you don't get economies of scale until you actually grow past that point. And on top of that, if you're just starting out, hiring the wrong person is horribly expensive. And even if you do get the right person, it's still cost money to get them on boarded and up to speed with what needs to happen. So those are some typical problems, I think, to avoid recommended management systems. Oh, goodness, I mean, like, I think, to Mike's point, this is probably where I feel like, not only am I not that differentiated, I'm probably not even the best person to ask, I think   
I want let's, let's put it in the form of what you should be asking you. So the question to be asking you is that when I think about this, what are the processes I need to put in place for a business system that has employees rather than just me? And then pick the tools later? Based on what those processes are? Right? Sure.   
So the way that you should start thinking about this is you have a business developing ecommerce websites and digital ad campaigns. So how clear Are you on? Like, is the flywheel turning actively bringing in you bringing in new clients? Is that consistent? Is that stable? Is that reliable? Is that a system that is currently working? Is your sales process currently working? And then there's this question of what does what is the fulfillment and delivery process look like? So what is your onboarding process? And what is your ongoing support process? And then looking at across the scope of those things?  
Where are you, I mean,  
so if you don't have if your sales and marketing systems aren't stable, then you're going to introduce a lot of instability into your business, adding operational overhead, adding to your operations without without beefing that up. And, and then looking at, I would look across those. And, and, like, again, the time X ray, I think is a great way to go about this. But where are the places where you spending low value work? And Can you are you wanting to expand strictly by? Like, honestly, the easiest place to start is finding the low value work that you can offload across across those things are what are the things that are time consuming, that can be automated? And I would, I would start by doing that. Now the other the other approach you can take is just go find somebody who's better than you at running ad campaigns, and build the sales and marketing machine and feed these leads off to them. That's that's how I would go about thinking about the about the issue. It's not about  
Thank you, Mrs. For this is great. So keep keep the same slide, right. And it's a question related to the question you just got. So I'm a one person, everything, right? What I tried to do is to delegate what I don't want to do, let's say on a print 200 copies of testimony booklet, I send it to a company or UPS or whatever. Now I start to struggling by they are not on time. And I need the stuff to be done on time. Now hiring somebody to be working with me. For me, it's been in the neck. Unlike people I like to do stuff by myself, because I get the idea. Just go do it on. Like, oh, wait, what if excuse on that stuff? So backing up with this? How can I overcome that mean? How can I overcome this? Because I don't want as you said low value. I don't I don't want to do low value stuff. I want to spend most of my time thinking and applying my ideas because I think I have greater days and the work when I execute them, then I struggle with executing them because I don't have somebody to help me have time to do them.  
So I the one thing that stands out from your question is this whole conversation is about how do we build simple repeatable process that continues. And what I'm hearing you say is, what I actually prefer to do is an art form. And so you're not actually this is what it sounds like to me is like you're not actually looking for somebody who can dot the i's and cross the T's what you're looking for as much as that is a dancing partner of somebody who can dance dance with your crazy ideas and, and go pull them off. Or you switch your, your mindset to or you, you Yeah, or you switch your mindset to let's go back over these successful ideas that I've had these creative ideas that have worked. And let me look for ways that I can turn these into something that can actually be repeatable. Again, this is just inferring from what you're saying. But it sounds to me like the idea of that kind of bores you. But there there are people who would be I don't know, there's, again, there's different ways to approach this, there are people who would be delighted to have an idea that actually works. And then take that working idea  
and to do it 510 100 times over until, like, indefinitely, is that? Is that your question?  
Yeah, well, let's say I have that I had the idea as you know, the traveling thing, right? It was great. I even on announcing it to my patients, a lot of them asked for it, right? Because everybody now is literally traveling. They need this. Now I need to print that I need somebody and up on top of it. I cannot leave what I'm doing to go printing. So I go to say, hey, UPS take this give me 200 copies, okay, in two days, in two days, I call nothing in 10 days now nothing.   
So the idea is not excuted? Because I have no control on this  
should I hire somebody to be having all that stuff to do it or just delegation? Like what I'm doing is writing?  
I mean, this is something. Yeah. So this is?  
Where do you where do you? I think the question I can't answer is where do you want to go with it? Are you wanting that part of the business to become something that's repeatable, that becomes a part of the of the business that continues to grow? Or do you?  
Yes. Okay. So. So then, what's the  
what's the hesitation on?  
On finding somebody who can? solicitation?  
There's some kind of hesitation about I guess, where's that wasn't? Where's the hesitation with finding finding somebody to do that? Or with? I mean, is it a question of whether you should find somebody? Is it a question of who that person is? Is it a question of, should you just have better selection of your printing company?  
When should should I hire somebody to take care of this trivial stuff?  
That's, that's my question.  
Or I just keep looking for a better company. way, I think, regardless, I think at almost any stage,  
that there is always there's always opportunity for trivial things that you can hand off to somebody else. And so I don't know if it's specifically this, let's chase down and see whether you can get these these booklets printed.  
Or whether it's, it's gonna take care of all of these other trivial things like housekeeping or bookkeeping, or all of the other trivial things that need to be done? I think,  
I think the, it depends on the quality of the person that you find. And it depends on  
the and it's also easier if you have I also think initially, this is my opinion, initially, it's easier to find those things that need to be done repeatedly, and find somebody who can, who can learn how to do those things repeatedly. And you don't have to be explaining yourself over and over again. And so if you can save yourself an hour every week by things that you're already spending an hour on every week and they need to be done every week or multiple times a month. I don't really have a good good good answer for for what but if you have, but you can almost certainly benefit by finding somebody to offload some of those low value tasks to  
djay Yeah, just one, one small nugget of advice for Mustapa. Using a virtual assistant, here in the US initially to hand, this is somebody who already knows how to how to get multiple office things done. So even though you might wind up paying 25 or $35 an hour for that person, it will help you determine what types of things that you can let them do. And the more things you get off, eventually, you might have a dedicated person that that does those kinds of things, specifically for certain tasks, but the more things that you can offload, to a to a virtual assistant here, number one, you're not hiring or an employee. So if you're having a cash flow, you just cut that person off this week or this month. But instead of having the employee or bringing somebody in to work with you, it's keeping keeping your brain clear, because it sounds like you, you'd like to work alone and think, and then pass it off to somebody or something like that. So using a virtual assistant, where you can just email them that says, hey, get this thing printed. And, and they do that, or, you know, I need a graphic for this or something like that. And so it's it's a, it's a learning curve for them. And for you, as you find that you can push more and more things away, it frees your time up to, to do the things that are important. And that's one of the things that Matthias pointed out earlier that was just hit me is that we have so many things crowding for time, in our mind, and with with things that need to be done that are that are that are urgent, but not necessarily as important as what you're doing. So if we start doing the important things and taking the urgent things, and push him off to somebody whose whole job is doing urgent things, and that's what a virtual assistant is handling printing for you, and printing for Matthias and printing for several other people at the same time. And so they're not really they're not trying to think about how to make their business better. They're just working. So that's,  
here's my issue. I tried to two companies before for virtual assistant never showed up on time, the first meeting, I was like, if you already don't show up for your work, how I'm going to trust you with my work?  
That's a very valid question. I mean, so maybe third time's a charm, and maybe maybe it takes five times. And that's better than hiring an employee that doesn't show up for the shows up late four days in a week to the office. So it's better to have a virtual assistant that you can get rid of than somebody that you've hired, that's not working.  
Okay, I'll look into that. So they can do the work, even if they are not  
around me. So absolutely, I Yes. Okay. I have just, here's an example. I have a bookkeeper who is a certified financial analyst, who is a fractional CFO. And she took a series of books for a small company and just made it work great. But I've never met the lady. And she, I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee, she's in Denver, Colorado. And but she has transformed my life. And she communicates directly with my CPA, she helped us do insurance for workers comp. I mean, there's just all kinds of things that I never knew that that somebody could do. And she says, Oh,   
I can do this, or I can do that. And just go do it.  
Okay. Yeah, we'll look into that again today.  
Thank you. Sorry, I'm fast. I didn't mean, it's good.  
I appreciate that. So something else that came to mind while you were talking, as well as I think,  
the, you know,  
in an ideal situation that he wants that back and if you have somebody who can say, hey, I need these booklets printed, and I need them in two days, go find somebody who's going to do that. That's one step better than saying, Hey, let's go to UPS and figure out how to get ups to  
print these booklets because, like, Yeah, clearly that's, yeah, it's a great business idea. But helping entrepreneurs get have ideas done, or execute? That's a great business idea.   
Somebody can do that.  
You will own a lot of money  
I think it would be helpful to hear from the first part is just kind of going back to Mike's comments, what are the gems that you heard and you're like, like that, like, that needs to be framed or highlighted or emphasized or this slide is a gem for me. I like this one. This slide that we are on now at 20\. Management. Yeah, great. And there was another one when you when you when you talked about communication. That was great, too. That's very, very effective.  
The yep, this one? low friction. Oh, hi. Hi.  
Yes, I was great to see, for yourself, have you thought about a DSP?  
In this particular aspect of it, I mean, have I thought about it and kind of feel like I'm in this particular aspect, I'm actually kind of hunting for what it is I'm looking for. Because because of your expertise in, in systemize, systems and codes, it's almost like you could be you could put together and I don't know what the total package looks like yet. But you have the beginnings of a package to go and work and help coders or coding teams become more efficient.  
And, and I don't know what that looks like, any more than I know how Perry works with all of these different people, except he's bringing value. And I think if you're really He keeps talking about being the king of a niche. And I think the more you bring it down into people who, who understand systems, but from there using, most topless. Do, you know they're so busy working, that they can't, they can't get things done that they need done. But yet they're needing somebody to come in and help them put it together. And I think you'd have the framework. And you can you can talk to coders and understand their language. And as Perry says, you can you can read a page out of their journal, because you've been there. So you're, you're really you have the ability to get inside their head and and write the copy or let somebody else write the copy that that brings out those pain points.  
So everything in part one is censored, in some degree to make sense to people who are not coders. Because my basic process was I'm going to digest for an hour, and here's all the software coding equivalents. And we're going to boil them down to the basics. And then how do   
I communicate this to other people? But if we if if I were to go to a, I think perhaps my hesitation with software companies, it's like well, I mean, there's, they're not, are they wild by systems? I don't know. But it could be that what they're wowed by is, hey, we live in systems all day and everything I need to know about how to run my business is right in front of me and I already know this stuff, but nobody ever was actually able to extract it and articulate it in the way that you can. And I think I think perhaps I could replicate those same sets of a Ha's of like, you know, talking about, you know, machine code and Zapier is probably more interesting to them than it is to you guys. And there's an refactoring like Mike mentioned, you know, other things like  
that it's definitely worth definitely worth worth a look anybody else have gems in the highlights? Things that like this was the these are the best parts of it.  
Can you just spin back to some of the very first slides for me quick because I have a feeling  
There's that this. There's this guy that was good. Oh,  
can you back up one second? Yeah, the difference between a developer and a designer. That was a key takeaway that a lot of people again, these these guys who are designing websites under, see all the parts, the people who are actually doing building the thing, all they know is they need to build another step. And great designers are not great developers  
Oh, that back up there. Oops, there.  
Yeah, this I thought was really interesting, right. Um, um, and I know there was a slide later where you had the header and the subhead and both of them struck me as super like, like a ton of concept in just a few words there that was that yeah, that's one of them. At least that overloaded systems wanted divide. I've never thought about that concept ever. And it's really interesting. And all growth halts without division one right same. Same idea said differently, but I'm like really provocative to me. So there was a communication piece there is that second part too. Okay. Cool. Anybody else? Anything else? Are we good? Okay, well  
whatever on this page, you can tell that you're really different than thought in this was really great. You made it simple. This means you master the information or No, I like this. So you made it simple. I am a person who doesn't understand all of that stuff.  
Understood. Yeah. Cool. All right. Well, appreciate you guys. I'm gonna get this uploaded, and get the email sent out to you guys. afterward.  
Thank you very much. Thanks.

# Systems Deep Dive

# Systems Deep Dive

1. Introduction  
   1. What do you want to have out of this?  
   2. Two Parts:  
      1. PART ONE \- Instilling a DEEP VISCERAL understanding of systems, how they work, and how to think about them  
      2. PART TWO \- Tactical pieces of how to implement these in your system  
2. Part 1 \- Mindset  
   1. Introduction  
      1. As I was preparing for this, I had a lunch conversation with a friend of mine who asked me, “What do you REALLY do?” We had an intensely creative conversation.  
      2. For the next 48 minutes, I was speaking into my voice recorder, capturing the parallels from my entire career in software and my understanding of business.  
      3. This is going to be my path to UNPACK  
   2. What Are SYSTEM?  
      1. External Inputs (Interruption \+ Information) \-\> Series of Actions / Decision Points \-\> External Output  
      2. A system is only meaningful when it interacts with things OUTSIDE it  
         1. Godel’s Theorem  
         2. Scripture \-...  
         3. A business…  
      3. As simple as a LEVER/FULCRUM  
      4. For example, sitting at the coffee shop, the external event is someone walks in, places an order  
         1. In this case, THEY are making the decision.  
         2. From there, it’s a series of simple steps to make their food/drink based on their decision  
      5. Alarm Clock  
         1. External Input (time of day, etc) … series of items etc …  
   3. 3 ways to think about software  
      1. Expression Programming  
         1. if you give me information, I give you new/different information, but I will not DO anything.  
      2. Functional Programming \- Linear / Step by Step  
         1. If you give me information, I may change some things along the way, and I may or may not give you new information  
         2. RETURN-based vs EXCEPTION-based  
            1. I will tell you whether or not it worked  
            2. I will tell you if it DIDN’T work  
      3. Object Oriented  
         1. This is a hierarchical TREE structure, where you have:  
            1. Systems  
            2. Subsystems  
            3. Modules  
            4. Files  
            5. Classes  
            6. Functions  
            7. AND THEN you get to the linear   
         2. But here’s the thing  
            1. EVERYTHING can be represented as a tree structure  
            2. There’s a whole part of linguistics that’s centered around modeling   
            3. Your family is a tree structure  
            4. Your house is a tree structure  
               1. House  
                  1. Kitchen  
                     1. Cabinet  
                  2. Living room  
                  3. Bedrooms  
                     1. Bedroom 1  
                     2. Bedroom 2  
                     3. Bedroom 3  
            5. This is almost everywhere  
   4. How do you traverse TREES?  
      1. The most natural flow of information is up and down the tree, NOT randomly across the tree.  
   5. Trees follow depth of knowledge  
      1. This is what has happened in the evolution   
   6. Knowledge becomes more granular as you go down the tree.  
      1. Software Language – look at what people have called CODING:  
         1. Machine Code (1’s and 0’s)  
         2. Assembler (short abbreviations)  
         3. C (standard C)  
         4. C++ (or object oriented C)  
         5. JavaScript (V8)  
         6. Zapier  
      2. What are the benefits?  
         1. It allows you to turn 10, 100, or 1,000 instructions into 1  
         2. You can tell an entry-level person step by step instructions  
         3. You can tell a manager overall plan  
         4. You can tell a leader the strategic direction  
      3. And encapsulated in your instructions are multiple levels of instruction  
      4. This means that your level of specificity MUST match the level of sophistication of each person. Your PROCESS will be much more terse.   
      5. It also means that if you’re able to find common, repeatable processes, and you’re able to break them down into meticulous instructions, you can offload them to less skilled labor  
   7. When you develop software, you always start with:  
      1. A series of instructions  
      2. YOu allow it to grow  
      3. You recognize the natural divisions  
      4. You split them apart  
      5. *This is how biology works, and this is how organizations grow as well…*  
   8. The same with a business, and a new venture, or ANYTHING that you do…  
      1. You start with a series of steps and tasks  
      2. You look for natural patterns and divisions that emerge  
      3. You separate those so that you can continue to grow without encountering undue complexity  
   9. There are 3 places where these things can break down:  
      1. If you have INACTION, you don’t have any steps/tasks to device  
      2. If you don’t have PATTERN RECOGNITION, you’ll misappropriate tasks OR you’ll continue to evolve into deeper chaos…  
      3. If you don’t have DELEGATION, you can’t split off tasks to continue to multiply  
   10. NOISE is when you have communication without separation.  
       1. There are two types of communication in networking –  
          1. Broadcast (requires users to filter out what is relevant to them)  
          2. Targeted (only sends messages that are targeted)  
       2. Every communication system has a BANDWIDTH issue  
          1. You can only HEAR and UNDERSTAND so much stuff  
          2. (Story of Gox Box?)  
       3. A growing system that does not subdivide, will encounter breakdowns in communication, because people are not able to handle that much information  
       4. Information will actively start getting lost…this is the equivalent of “packets getting dropped”  
   11. Communication  
       1. Targeted communication is high-friction, high-quality, low-bandwidth  
          1. Targetd communication slows down and speeds up based on the communication bandwidth  
       2. Broadcast communication is low-friction, low-quality, high-bandwidth  
          1. Broadcast communication simply gets lost when it exceeds the maximum bandwidth  
       3. Every broadcast medium, such as social media (or to some degree, email) needs to have a filter. If you want something more than just what happens to come at the wrong time, you need to actively WEED OUT invalid information.  
          1. This is why people who are busy with other things are often not able to hear memos from the head office, because they have a hard limit on their bandwidth.  
          2. One of the most 80/20 thing you can do is recognize this limit.  
       4. The problem with your email is that you have BROADCAST and TARGETED communication in one place, which means you are voluntarily dropping information. When you start prioritizing your email, you have a higher quality of information. For example:  
          1. People you MUST absolutely communicate with (spouse, close team members, top clients)  
          2. People you MAY communicate with  
          3. People you SHOULD NOT communicate with  
          4. Subscriptions you MUST read  
          5. Subscriptions you MAY read  
          6. Subscriptions you SHOULD NOT read  
          7. *Note the way that BROADCAST \+ TARGETED COMMUNICATION are mixed into the same medium, which (like packets) SLOWS DOWN even the targeted communication*  
       5. This is why when you send an email asking for volunteers, you don’t get anything, but when you ask people directly, they’ll help you.  
       6. This is why when you send a mass email to people, it goes through a different set of filters. THe power of marketing is in trying to scale something that APPEARS targeted, but as something that is BROADCAST  
   12. This is one of the ways you isolate complexity, because there are two types of communication:  
       1. INTERNAL communication – which are all the things that someone things, or does, that nobody else sees. This applies personally, as a dept, team, business, etc  
       2. EXTERNAL communication – which is how an entity communicates outside of itself  
       3. SIMPLIFICATION comes down to moving as much communication as possible to be INTERNAL, without compromising the utility of the system  
       4. Practical implications  
          1. You have a team member who is asking too many questions, given their role  
          2. You have a team member who is asking TOO FEW questions given their role

You mentioned Process Street, and other saas tools for workflow. Are there any books/blogs that help guide a decision towards which 3rd party process/tool to use.  
\-- The Time X-Ray  
    \* Could be automated \-- and I could review that and get with them with some challenges and a way to improve what theyire doing  
    \* Could even get people, who already have a coaching business, and then do a white label for them, for that product, for that industry (give them a complete exclusive for that industry, if they maintain a certain number of customers, and if they don't use it enough, use it for somebody else)  
    \* Use VA's from Philppines w/ Mastesr and articulate, by offering to set up email filters for people who are "too busy to do it themselves"  
    \* There are ways to expand on the systemaizing that builds credibility with what I'm doing, and it solidifies them into becoming a client  
    \* Perry has 1,000s of people with like us, and I could generate an audience   
\-- Kelly \--   
 \*\* This is a MAIN QUOTE \-- where this is 6 words, where there's a lot to think about  
 \*\* What I recognized about my unique context, tying things together  
 \*\* To somebody who's lived in a different context, and it's landing as something that's really interesting and fresh

If you just look at this last piece, etc  
\*\* What are teh DIFERENCES that those MINDSETS and the subparts of the system mindset MAKE, in doing the prioritization, efficiencies, etc \-- because that's the actual differentiator because of the other people  
\*\* First part was strong, but didn't get that connection, but not the connection WHY this actually matters  
\-- It didn't have connection there \-- IN THIS, what's the DIFFERENTIAL about having a systems view...vs. just taking those tips and if you google and find them...  
\-- Think about .... What Kelly said....  
  \*\* What are the GEMS?  
Mike \-- I mentioned earlier, about refactoring can be applied to software systems, and also   
 \>\>\>\> That's a HUGE area, and a huge implication for systems thinking...  
If you do this, and you don't have the SYSTEMS THINKING, then there's all the other stuff that's not going to happen...  
\>\> The current vogue topic of transformation, but only part of the process, but not thinking about the big picture  
\>\> How does that affect everything?  
If you DO THIS, you're getting this without geetting the systems view, or want impact on a larger level

As a 1 person business, currently, i want to expand. I’ve gone as far as i can using occasional freelancers. I develop e-commerce websites and digital ad campaigns. What are the typical problems i need to avoid by expanding? Best / recommended management systems (asana etc?) I can see that some of your slides were very relevant to my situation.

# Systems \- Email Decision Making

You asked me a little bit about what's my process for rapidly processing emails. But one of the things, one of the rules of thumb that I have is keep everything on your plate as as little as possible, get it under somebody's else's plate as quickly as possible. And when there's technical knowledge involved, do as much diagnosis as as you need to to keep it from coming back to you. And then of course, handed off and leave it on somebody else's court for follow up. So my only response is a mean email for me as a hospitalist. And that's how I roll with it. So when I sit down for email, one of the first things that I do is read through all the informational emails. And this really is a process change that I think could be helpful or beneficial for me. It's easy just to kind of get in the rhythm and habit of it, but I think it could actually be helpful for me to separate things that require some kind of communication or project management back and forth. And actual feedback for me versus things that are strictly just informational. But So read through, get rid of those things that are just informational, anything that they need to know. And then there are times when there's a bigger project where, for example, the inside marketing project is a bigger project that requires a lot more back and forth. One of the things that I do on those that we started doing, that gave introduced me to that I really like is you have a single email thread where things are going back and forth. You have a new paragraph for each topic with a bold prefix. So for example, you know, you might have on a marketing campaign, you might have something like Google ads, in bold and then you have a paragraph describing information regarding Google ads. And you have another one bold Facebook ads, and you talk about stuff about that and then you have like bold contracting for fill in the blank 123\. And you have, you know more specifics around that. And what that allows you to do is rather than having a dozen different email chains, where things things are flying back and forth, that allows you to have a single email chain and, you know, go back and forth on that and make sure things don't fall through the cracks. The other thing that I will look for is for duplicates, so for example, sometimes you get error notifications or things like that. So the earlier ones they just discard the early ones or sometimes you discard the later ones, whatever it doesn't really matter. Just get slowly the just catch one of them. Getting second let me think what else So typically, when I'm overwhelmed that things tend to sit in my inbox a little bit, because my, my management, time management goes down when I'm overwhelmed. I try to keep only a few things that really deserved my highest priority at any given time, and requires more level of detail than that it probably needs to be handed off to somebody else to help manage and oversee. But there are times when I will take something that's on in my inbox and I'll throw it on the calendar or I'll throw it in the project management system and put it on there. Or that's, that's really what I do there and then on the project management side, I think I've lacked this primarily on the courthouse side. But once again, I truly try to put as much project ownership on other people as possible. So they're actually responsible for managing the project management is the most challenging for me to determine priorities and what needs to be done and as much as possible, just looping some whoever knows into that and whoever's got that kind of operational mindset and just lean on them to help me kind of decipher what's what and and sort through it, there's also one of the things that I've learned is to respect my own kind of creative and working with him, which is absolutely catastrophic for somebody who doesn't understand how I work. I'll get to that in just a moment. So I've actually got a really good handle over my flow of energy, but it's a nonlinear type of type of working style. And so I will pick something up while I have creative energy for that I work on it until I lose steam on it, and I will set it aside and I'll go work on something else. This is the kind of thing that drives people crazy when they you know, if you're linear worker, this is not a style that's going to work for you. But I understand my style and I know what works and I'm constantly re evaluating and judging things based on the current priority and where things are at. And the other thing that's been really helpful for me is time not in initiating factfinder. And so I don't always recognize when I'm missing information. So one of the things that I have learned along the way is to recognize basically were common reasons why I start out or lose motivation or a project and almost always, when I hit a wall, it's it's either also decided I'll wait until it's the right timing because it might not be the right timing to pursue it  
or to keep driving it forward. I will, again, my most successful and most successful when I got somebody else where I can set it aside. There's somebody else I'm collaborating with on the project, we got to get heads together and work through that. It's also been really helpful for me to have a coach that got access to more than once a month and be able to bouncing things back and forth and get momentum and stuff as I get stuck on it. And then there's still this whole system with with email subscriptions. I rag email subscriptions based on frequency daily, weekly, monthly and that system works very well. And so those just happen sporadically and randomly whenever you feel like going in there and and finding out what's going on but there's not really any kind of real urgency. I think that's probably the gist of it. How I process my email. If there's any more specific questions have answer them. Thanks
