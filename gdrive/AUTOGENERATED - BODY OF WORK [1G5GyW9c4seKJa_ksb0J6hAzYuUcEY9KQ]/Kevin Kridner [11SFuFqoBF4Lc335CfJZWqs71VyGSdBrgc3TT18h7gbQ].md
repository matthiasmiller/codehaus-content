SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
00:15  
Hey, Kevin, you  
00:30  
see, okay, can you hear me now?  
00:36  
Yeah, I can good. All right, perfect.  
00:41  
How are you doing,  
00:43  
doing well, how are you  
00:48  
doing, okay? Doing okay. Moved a bunch of stuff yesterday, so cleaned out the garage and that kind of thing. So little tired, but it was a great Sabbath.  
Matthias Miller  01:03  
That's awesome. There's a maybe you've heard this was it? Was it Heschel or somebody, I don't remember, sure who it was, but maybe it's even older than that. Maybe it's the rabbinic tradition or something that talks about you work with your mind, then you should, you work with your hands for your Sabbath. If you work with your hands are short, with your mind, for your  
01:21  
for your seven, right? Well, I mean, that definitely happens.  
01:32  
That definitely happened. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  01:41  
here's an interesting thing for you. I was playing around with AI song generation over the weekend, and you know, so there's some interesting nuances, but you can control the genre, and, you know, whatever kind of directive you want to provide. And there's some times when it kind of forces a few things to get something to rhyme that doesn't really whatever, but it's a really interesting Chesterton said that, I think once again, Chester, I think it was just Chesterton said that truth is stranger than fiction because we've adapted fiction to suit ourselves. But it's also interesting because you can, you can create, well, I don't know it's it's interesting because it gives people, people who don't have the technical capacity to create art, a means by which to to create art. So right, an opportunity to an opportunity to and so you can create your own you know whether it's you know whether it's you know, whether it's for yourself, whether it's for your friends, whether it's for other people, you can, yeah. Anyway, so random little rabbit hole,  
03:12  
yeah. Well, it is a manner of expression that opens some doors. You know, the the AI is can be powerful in that sense.  
03:27  
I hadn't  
03:30  
considered it that way before. Well,  
Matthias Miller  03:33  
one of, one of the things too, that raises interesting. I mean, I think the ethics question a lot of people wonder, like, is it appropriate to use AI to communicate? I think if you think of it as a medium in the same way that written form, etc, so using generated videos of yourself, is that an appropriate expression, and insofar as it's an accurate communication of what it is that you're trying to communicate of who you are, right? It seems reasonable. And insofar as I think they're well, and insofar as it's done in respect to your volition, whether it's delegated or or otherwise, right?  
04:41  
Well, it takes me. It takes me back to the Old Testament prophets. And I'm growing up. I thought they, you know, they heard from God, and they wrote it down. And come to find out via research. And that. I think, no, they had scribes. So how is that any different?  
Matthias Miller  05:07  
Well, and even when you think about how Paul talks about communication, Spirit to spirit, uh huh, and even the very basis of how God communicates is the message is not the form,  
05:28  
right? The message is the the idea communicated, right? Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  05:43  
so another fascinating thing that's kind of connected to this. It's connected to the conversation that where we want to go is, I've been thinking a lot. I so the conventional approach to marketing, okay, so I don't know if I can break all this stuff down. It ties into what to talk about, but know that it's relevant that we talk about it, but it is interesting to me, you have fundamentally, two different types of businesses, transactional and transformational. So transactional businesses, I need a screw that meets certain requirements, and whoever can get it to me meeting whatever standard quality time, quote time, time time requirements. Then, you know, at the lowest price, like and so then marketing for these types of things is, is situational. So who is, I mean, this is a dumb example, but who are all the people who are building houses right now that need, who needs these particular types of screws, you know, whatever, which, which is why people fall into the, oh, go market to the, you know, to the 30 to 50 year old male who has, who owns their own home and and then attempting to lay out their day to day life, to try to get inside their Heads, whatever, all the nonsense it doesn't even whatever I mean it, it's fine. It's just been repeated to death, right? The interesting thing about people is that everybody has an area, at least one area, probably more that they will spend. They will spend money on, either in small amounts or large amounts. So, cars, coffee, movies, yeah, seminars, books like it's it's probably easier to find you. You're probably more likely to find people with, you know, almost like two camps, people with zero to 10 books, and then people with 100 or more books. Maybe that's exaggeration, but yeah, to illustrate the point, but to illustrate the point. And so one of the things I've been playing around with on LinkedIn is LinkedIn has two, two search capabilities, one if you're connected to an individual, and depending on the privacy settings, you can find their connections. So in this particular case, I was working on filling a lunch next week, kind of short notice. Had about three weeks to do it, and only got maybe two or three people, but got two or three people from, you know, just cold outreach to show up to the lunch. A lot of people, quite a few people express interest. Schedule short notice, all this stuff. So I don't know there's going to be 10\. So if you get two to three people, maybe one to two will actually show it's, I mean, I don't know, who knows, yeah, but so that's part number one, and then the part number two was, was education. So in this particular case, filling an event from Melvin and, you know, using some of the like Bethel influencers to find people who are interested in this type of thing, by virtue of being on LinkedIn that already have this interest. And so selling them one more thing, or getting. Just show it for one more thing down this rabbit hole that they've already gone. Another example was using targeting, or you alumni, and I'm sure there's probably others, and there's, there's other types of influence, but, but it was very interesting to me. So so transformational businesses tend to follow tribes and influencers and thought leaders and and if and if and there's a smaller leap from somebody spending their first dollar on, say, a heaven and business conference or equivalent, right than it is to or even their first membership in some kind of community like that, than it is for them To send spend in their for the train, their second or third. So the question I would have, so obviously, we can reach out. So how to fill this event, reaching out to a bunch of folks, just, you know, manually, which which is great. There's some folks who are interested  
11:27  
the  
Matthias Miller  11:30  
but one of the questions that kind of follows with that is, who are the types of people who would naturally be predisposed to do what are the if this and that things, if this person graduated from here, went to this school, they're predisposed. Or, if this person is connected with this other person. They're, you know, three to one more likely to be predisposed to something like that. So that's where my frame of mind is. But you might have there's any rambling for  
12:18  
No, no, I like it because I mean, bottom line, what we're looking for is an openness to experience. So those who are open to experience. So what criteria falls in that category? I  
12:43  
because what we really want is people who want wisdom, people who want to explore, people who want to be involved in a conversation that truly, that truly is a conversation. It's interactive, but those are the people we're looking for. And I feel that once you get enough of those people who are connected in a certain way, then all the marketing really stops, because it's just viral word of mouth, you know, experience. So for me, it would be people who who are open to experience, open to a conversation. I  
13:43  
who are tired of the old way of doing things, who are looking for something new, which really isn't new, it's very ancient, but different than what this world and its business environment and Its marketing schemes has been employing for generations.  
14:22  
Those are, those are my thoughts on it. I  
17:53  
So do you have, do you have People in your and that you've been I,  
18:20  
I Should have done a better i I'm potentially a better job of  
18:55  
so I had I just  
Matthias Miller  19:05  
thinking through some of The people that we I  
20:35  
So who Are I?  
Matthias Miller  20:54  
Is this merely a who do we know in going through. Mean, I spent a while on Friday. I wanted to do this anyway, just kind of going through my, my list of folks, some of them fairly, you know, I don't know, depending on on where I'm at with them. Some of them fairly direct, just saying, hey, look, I'm putting this on you interested. Others, just more of a indirect. What would it take you to come to Colorado? And some of them just like, hey, check it in. What's going on?  
22:01  
Yeah,  
22:07  
I feel you know for this initial one, since it is kind of a pilot, you know that, yeah, it should be, you know people we know. And so I've been thinking about praying, about reaching out to those people I know who could should be a part of this. I  
22:44  
because bottom line who I want to be there is who God wants to be there.  
22:49  
Yeah,  
22:55  
because that's, that's our whole ethos, right? What at the end of the day, am I living in union with God, and is he directing and I'm following, or am I directing and he's following? That's the whole ethos. I  
23:28  
do we cut ourselves off at the knees and lose the message and the recruiting for an event that's fair? I a me, this really, really seems like a an object lesson or a an opportunity to play this and experiment, yeah, let's see how this plays out. If we do it this way,  
24:19  
if we truly say we're seeking you first and Knowing that you will take care of everything else you  
25:15  
So what does that look like? Yeah, I  
26:55  
i think this is one of those, you know, in this process, this is one of Those paradigm shifting moments where this is coming up, it's little over a month away, starting, starting to become real. And what do we do with that? Do we put our hands on it because it's starting to get real? Or do we see Kim dressed in him follow what he's leading us to do? I think most endeavors start out very, very pure with a passion, and then they end up getting corrupted over time, because we put our hands on it. So how do we not do that? Is The is a key question for Me. I  
Matthias Miller  30:55  
So what does it look like from your experience and your observation, to put our hands on something,  
31:13  
impulsiveness,  
31:22  
the feeling arises, be it fear, anxiety, nervousness, worry and all sudden, I've got to fix this. I  
31:57  
i think the true ideal is to operate with our head, our heart and our gut in balance,  
32:11  
when  
32:13  
I feel myself, when I have a Feeling, and immediately I go into problem solving or fixing. I know something's off inside me. I  
32:43  
And in my best moments, that's when I take a step back and go, Okay, what's happening here? In my worst moments, I go With whatever that impulse is. I  
34:08  
so it was all impulsiveness  
34:17  
rooted in that pattern.  
34:21  
I think there's something beautiful to that impulsiveness, because I think that's where ideas are created, like, like, illumination, like, Oh, wow. This could be a thing, you know, but it needs to be processed, felt, through thought, through, explored, pondered on, meditated on, and then it can. It's an integrated thing. When it comes out of that process, I think if I have the impulse and then I automatically do something. If. I don't think it's an integrated process.  
35:08  
So not that everything in that impulse would be bad. It's just unrefined by time, by process, by seeking the Lord in it. That's what I I think, because we hear the word, you know, integrity, and in common parlance, it's they, they don't tell the truth, or they do the wrong thing, or they do tell the truth, they do the right thing. But in reality, what we're talking about is the integration of the parts of us, the head, the heart, the gut. That's what integrity looks like. So if we look at it, every one of us lacks integrity. Anytime those things are out of balance, we lack integrity.  
36:12  
And I think the balance comes from all of those factors, doing, playing their part. And really, to me, the key thing in all of this is time, and I allow time for this impulse to be thought through and felt through and wrestled with, so that it can form into something. That's why I think one of the primary tools of the enemy is urgency, the sense of urgency.  
36:51  
He can get us jump. He can get us to, you know, jump out of the frying pan and into the fire. Then he's won. I inevitably, because it's not a integrated process. So  
37:36  
is what I'm saying makes sense, or  
37:41  
I think so,  
37:54  
mostly Looking to So I  
Matthias Miller  38:48  
well, so this is how We roll around here. Okay, love it. Do so impulse, then, is any is a singular voice? I?  
39:30  
Rather than,  
Matthias Miller  39:36  
rather than a triune conversation Yes,  
39:44  
yes, I like that triune conversation  
39:54  
reminds me that I. Scripture, a chord found with three parts, something like that can't be broken, something along those lines, yeah, that braided rope with three parts like that's not breaking one single strand that's going to Break.  
40:40  
So What? What? I  
Matthias Miller  42:00  
So what's The difference between trying conversation and death by inaction.  
42:30  
So let's use a analogy to flush that out. So let's say you're in a conversation with two other people. You're sitting around having coffee, you have a topic here. What  
42:55  
would a triune conversation in that environment look like? I  
Matthias Miller  43:13  
think, well, I mean, it's ultimately, you know, borrowing things that we've talked about. It's, it's self disclosure, hearing and being heard. What are your thoughts on? Right? A lot of questions. Right  
43:32  
questions. Understand where you're coming from taking pains to see what you see and why you see it that way. Now, what would a a lack of integrity conversation look like?  
Matthias Miller  43:57  
Well, we've all been in things like this, where there has been no conversation, it's one person running their mouth or, I mean, there's also quasi understanding. I am acknowledging what you're saying without really understanding or not clarifying whether I'm understanding it  
44:23  
or creating a defense in my head while you're speaking rather than actually listening, so that one person's just speaking. Does that happen internally?  
44:39  
Sure that  
44:40  
one part of us is speaking, and if any of the other parts tries to interject something in it, what happens?  
Matthias Miller  44:53  
Slept across the face until  
44:54  
the Shut up. Right? Do?  
45:02  
So what if you go  
45:03  
ahead? It doesn't matter which part is doing the rambling and the slapping across the face and told to shut up. Any of those three parts of us can do that. But the wise which we've we've see as a major component of wisdom is the openness to experience, the whys are open to the experience of what's happening internally, and can listen and learn from it.  
Matthias Miller  45:43  
So wouldn't in a more even a more fine tuned terminology, be triune negotiation? Because ultimately, what you're saying is okay. I mean, I appreciate communication, but we're also looking to actualize something, right and but in order for to actualize with integrity, there's a question of mind, what do you need? Mm, hmm. And now that we understand your needs, how do we make sure that your needs are met? Heart, what do you need? So mind, I need a plan, and I need to know how this plays out. And I need to, I don't know what like, right? I mean, let's pick the event. Here's the event working backwards, 30 days away, or whatever it is, you know, 32 and, and so. So mind, what do you need? Well, I need some assurance of certainty. I suppose I don't know. Heart, what do you need, yeah, could be any number of things. Gut, what do you need, yeah. And how can we, how can we all come together so that each of our needs are met. And how can we provide? Okay, just picking off examples heart maybe as simple as I'm scared and mind can be, well, we've been in these types of situations before, and of course, and it's unfamiliar, so of course, is, or perhaps comfort from trusting the guy I don't know like,  
48:01  
right? Well, in that triune negotiation, well, what happens in a negotiation? Does everybody get everything they want? In a negotiation?  
Matthias Miller  48:16  
No, they get what matters, right?  
48:18  
So part I'm scared. Okay, if we stay there and just in the communication, there's no moving forward, because I'm scared. But the integrity is your mind saying we've been in situations like this before. This is the potential of how it's turned out. We can take a step wisely into this space and face your Your fears. That's the negotiation. That's the dance internally. Yeah,  
49:13  
and just to break it down from the beginning too, of like, okay, do you recognize that there are three parts within you, and they each have a very separate voice or desire. And how do we get them to communicate? Right? So even from the beginning of you know, we talked about the first question, tell me your name and tell me who you are,  
49:43  
right? Like that's  
49:44  
a jumping off point, because if there's one thing that you are that lacks integrity, there are three things that you are, and how do we. Get those things to start communicating and working together, negotiating rather than playing a dictatorial role. And we choose, I think we choose one of those three to lead the way, based on our experiences and what has worked  
50:20  
for us  
50:24  
like for me. Historically, my mind was what I trusted my thought process. I can think through these things, I can learn, I can understand, I can know. And so that's been the dictator in my experience. And yep. And so my lack of integrity is in that area that the head the mind was always out front, and the other two kind of lags behind. And maybe this ties to this is fascinating. Maybe this ties to what God says to the people of Israel when they cry out for a king. They want a king. He's like, you're not going to like it. You're putting one forward. This is what we need, this strong military leader, that kind of thing we need that well, that's born out of a fear of the Philistines. It's not born out of a desire for integration within your people, for union,  
51:35  
For protection, yeah. Well, I mean, isn't  
Matthias Miller  52:01  
I mean trauma, fundamentally, is dissociative in nature.  
52:16  
So I  
52:23  
and maybe just maybe our in our current political sphere in America, environment, maybe just maybe what we're crying out for is a king or a queen to save us from ourselves.  
52:49  
And  
52:55  
the right king or queen is so so very important. We need the right king or queen, and so if we're not getting the right king or queen, if my person isn't winning even too far to say that, I'll start taking shots at the king or queen that other people are in favor of. I  
Matthias Miller  53:27  
I mean, the fundamental premise of democracy is that, in its ideal state, is that everybody has a voice. I  
53:43  
Yeah, that's the holy, sacred thing about the concept, yeah, integration Union. But if my fears get too big, then I stopped caring what anybody else wants or needs. It's what I want or need.  
Matthias Miller  54:16  
Yeah, this still goes back to Fundamentally, there's this question of how I I mean, it's one thing to recognize that you need to have integration, but then what learning how to integrate is a whole other conversation.  
55:19  
And how do I learn to integrate? Well, the key is, is noticing where I'm disintegrated. And that's one thing most people don't want to do. Like Carl Young said, until we can understand our darkness, and what I think he's talked about when he says darkness is our disintegration, until we can actually look at our darkness and understand why that's there, what's what's going on, we're never going to be whole or complete, because we're denying The fact that we have any disintegration at all. So  
56:24  
and this is neither here nor there, but it strikes me as part of the conversation. But he says, The only way to get back, the only way to integrate, the only way to come to grips with your disintegration, is through symbolic viewing, is understanding through symbolism metaphor.  
56:50  
So what I'm looking for  
56:53  
doesn't matter. I have to see a symbolic representation of my disintegration in front of me. I  
Matthias Miller  57:03  
as in, here is a scenario that's played out,  
57:10  
yeah, and be willing to see the truth of it. So,  
57:20  
you know, silly example, we get off this call, I go to the store, I walk in, I see a candy bar that I really want. I grab it, I put it in my pocket, and the store security stops me on the way out and says, Hey, you didn't pay for that. I could just see it as an impulsive act and beat myself up for doing it, or I could go down and understand why I actually picked that up and put it in my pocket. I had the money to pay for it. Why didn't I pay for it? Now it gets really interesting. What motivated me  
58:08  
that that's the symbolic representation that's taking the metaphor of disintegration and the darkness inside us and playing it out so  
Matthias Miller  58:43  
but, yeah, it's interesting observing, because as you're talking, I'm recognizing that. I mean, one of the ways to frame this is when heart speaks, who is most likely to shut it down. When gut speaks, who is most likely to shut it down. When head speaks, who is most likely to shut it down? Yeah, and what I'm really realizing as we're talking is I mean, we've had many conversations about this, but my, my gut and my In my heart have consistently been met up with conversations of the head that have trumped the head pulled out that the mind pulled out the trump card, boom, boom, and which preconditioned me to say that there's. To a, I mean this right here became a like this became the battleground. Was this yes versus that, yep and very rarely, was I presented with, I mean, so it was conditioned to that, and there was no, well, that's interesting that you're feeling like this. Here's the practical implications of that. Can we explore and understand what's going on? And and can we find, like in the candy bar example, what motivated you becomes the question of curiosity and the question of negotiation, in which How can you get what it is that you truly want without needing to take what You didn't pay for? It starts a dynamic conversation. Same thing with my with the gut. What I see frequently with people is they they see and experience red flags where their gut is telling them there's something wrong. And first of all, they've never been given permission or have never felt free to trust it, trust it, so they rationalize why they should stay and instead of treating it as a conversation in which the mind uses the gut for an information source. So in a lot of ways, there's a mind I have a blind spot gut. What are you seeing? I'm seeing this, this and this. Well, that's interesting information that will inform now inform my actions, by which you know, whatever, and if we go this path, how do you respond to that? But the real issue here is the battle line that got drawn between the two that prevents any kind of conversation from happening, which is not that different than what you're saying the political situation right? Where the line has been drawn, Curiosity has ceased,  
1:03:01  
and there's just safe and unsafe, right? And the hard thing is, is, especially in that sphere, my definition of safe and unsafe is known by those running and they're going to pander to my definitions of safe and unsafe,  
1:03:28  
because they want something. Yeah.  
1:03:41  
I mean, it's no shock to look back over politics over let's just take a short amount of time the last 20 years and see how many promises were made and how many promises were kept.  
Matthias Miller  1:04:02  
Probably promises are very shockingly reusable.  
1:04:10  
Oh yeah, I  
Matthias Miller  1:04:31  
and going back to the very, very beginning, that people's buying behaviors are almost like an endless pit, and so anybody who buys promises of this kind is also going to promise buy promises of similar kind, regardless of the person who is selling them. So I. I mean somewhere here isn't there also a case in which I don't know if I can quite put words to this, and maybe this is opening a whole level of complexity we don't want To get  
1:05:19  
into candy bar. And let's say that  
1:05:25  
the  
Matthias Miller  1:05:53  
I don't know. I'm thinking of too many scenarios. Let's just say that eating the candy bar is just about taking the risk and seeing if you can get away with that  
1:06:06  
right,  
Matthias Miller  1:06:12  
which ultimately means that somewhere, there's an unmet need for risk taking an adventure within your life, essentially, I don't know. But then this also means that, if you can so, it also means that you become susceptible to a pattern of promise makers, not Promise Keepers. So, so if you go, Okay, keep, keep your, let's say that the fundamental problem, I don't know, just making things up. So you're working, you're working in Rolex, you're and, and, no, well, it's you. You've been in a specific job for an extended period of time, and you've found mastery, and it feels safe and so at that the current level and so, but you need adventure, and so you go take your trip to Paris. Yeah, you go rock climbing, you know? You jump out of an airplane, right? All of the things,  
1:07:39  
yeah, you make a risky relational experience  
1:07:46  
correct? And all of these are making promises of adventure,  
1:08:01  
what it means to be alive, what it means to be alive, yeah, but there's a certain part of me that that kills that risk taking experience. And so what could normally happen within my life, as far as risking I need some external experience to give me the risk, because I'm not having it in my day to day life,  
1:08:25  
correct,  
1:08:31  
the integration is the risk. So  
Matthias Miller  1:08:45  
I think this is also very other big conversation. I mean, most of consumers and depends relies on the premise of not being integrated.  
1:09:10  
So in in lieu of being integrated, I find this thing which will integrate me, be it a supplement, a workout plan, a dating site, A whatever the case may be.  
Matthias Miller  1:09:42  
And I also think we're seeing this trend towards or this. Maybe it's not a trend. Maybe it will be a trend. Maybe it won't. Maybe it's just a micro pond that folks are hanging out at, but of people who are looking to integrate, i. Yeah, and then you have integrated people who are interested in being around, integrated people who share with some form of shared value, whatever that might be. Yeah,  
1:10:32  
what do we call those spaces,  
1:10:38  
churches,  
1:10:41  
clubs nonprofit organizations, businesses, whatever your denomination is, you're Going to seek that place Where I can integrate you.  
1:12:19  
And that's not a negative against any of those organizations that can get depends, one by one, which one is actually seeking integration Union a triune conversation. That's a good place for you to be, if that's what's happening. But we can't assume that's what's happening upon entrance.  
1:12:53  
No matter what the promise is,  
Matthias Miller  1:12:57  
labeling A thing doesn't make it a thing. I I mean, I think this is fundamentally a model for a board meeting with yourself. Because as we're talking here, even in the business context, how vastly disconnected these areas have been, but I've never taken the time. Mean, but it's, it's, it's, much of this has been a journey of saying, let's jump from here to here. Okay, so if this isn't Give me what like, Will this give me what I want, or will this give me what I want? And it becomes a game of Whack a Mole. Instead of honoring each voice that comes to the table and say, voice I hear you, how can you do.  
1:15:02  
Yeah, I being open to a conversation internally. Yeah,  
1:16:43  
yeah, I hear you  
1:16:50  
that's a topic for discussion on the table. Rather than know, the agenda doesn't include that topic. I  
Matthias Miller  1:17:16  
this is not a conversation. It's also interesting people talk about people are talking independently in various forms of, you know, it's the IQ EQ SQ kind of conversation, and there's integration about left and at least some conversation about left brain plus right brain decision making. But maybe I've just not been in the right spaces, but I've seen very little. Actually, I don't know that I've ever seen any conversation around this concept.  
1:17:57  
I've only seen it in one place, and that's in the mystic community, the only place I've seen this.  
1:18:21  
And I think you become a mystic when you recognize that this is going on, and I'm powerless to stop it.  
1:18:42  
So I seek deeper intimacy with the Lord to work this out, to become integrated, To learn how to have That boardroom meeting internally, I  
1:19:57  
I think I've reached brain fried state.  
1:20:01  
I think, I think we've covered a lot of tertiary.  
1:20:08  
I think we've rung that towel out.  
Matthias Miller  1:20:12  
All right, well, go enjoy another cup of coffee or tea, or walk outside or who knows what. Yeah,  
1:20:20  
yeah, without a doubt, good, yeah. All right, my friend, all right, um, I'm  
Matthias Miller  1:20:29  
traveling. We'll talk this afternoon, but I'm traveling. I'm gonna be out Wednesday, and then I have an all day thing on Monday, so I think I, I will have to, but I think we can. And then I have a another private client thing on next Wednesday as well, so I'm  
1:20:53  
not sure if I could really connect until the 30th.  
1:21:01  
Okay, okay, yeah, we'll just, if something pops up, just, you know, a period of time, just let me know, and we'll, we can fit it in. If not, then we'll just plan on scheduling for then. Okay, sounds good, all right, my friend, well, I'll see you this afternoon. Awesome. Thanks. Bye.

SUMMARY KEYWORDS  
people, patch, rebirth, patching, talking, interesting, conversation, voice, cookies, move, experience, hear, head, bravery, paradigm, break, world, considered, inviting, sounds  
00:04  
Recording this  
00:25  
so isn't it true, then,  
00:36  
that Part of self preservation is adhering the rules of the community in the world that we're in.  
00:54  
It's been interesting to watch. There's this guy who goes around just gonna cross them this weekend, little late to the party, but he has a channel where he interviews does like five minute or three minute interviews with successful people and ask them for their secret and have they been broke, and other things like that. And in terms of, have they been broke, almost universally, yes, maybe bankruptcy. And  
01:37  
have they been relationally destroyed? Have they been financially destroyed. Have they banned all these things? Yeah, and inevitably, the answer is yes, yes, yes, yes,  
01:48  
yes. You know, what's your advice when you went to younger folks? Or what was the turning point, betting on themselves.  
02:15  
There's also been this recent debate about Paul Graham's recent Wait, was it just taco? Is his commentary on, I can't remember if he was the one who actually gave the talk on founder mode and talking about how,  
02:42  
yeah,  
02:49  
sorry. Brian Chesky was guy, maybe who had to talk and  
03:00  
what's consistent? Another thing consistent in these interviews and elsewhere was  
03:19  
a willingness to listen to themselves,  
03:28  
sometimes to the exclusion and sometimes in defiance to what everybody else was saying. To trust your gut,  
03:41  
trust your gut. To learn to trust your gut. Yeah, I  
04:04  
You could call that intuition, you could call that spiritual awareness, you could call whatever, but that feeling deep in your gut, and you know, it's not an emotional reaction, you know, it's something more grounded than that. And you know that this thing I can't let go of, it keeps coming back on a loop. To investigate it, to trust it, to listen to it, to learn  
04:39  
to hear that voice clearly.  
04:49  
Powerful thing,  
04:52  
and you can only learn to hear that voice clearly when you rolled the dice, taken a chance, crapped out, you know? Like, all that kind of stuff that you're like, Okay, I got nobody else around me sharing things other than the negative things, and so I'm gonna have to go internal and learn to listen to that voice.  
05:22  
Me. Maybe we could call that voice  
05:27  
the Holy Spirit.  
05:41  
Jiminy Cricket, Tinkerbell, all these manifestations of that little voice that floats around and, you know, says things to us, or at least the Disney fight version of them. I  
06:10  
it's really interesting, like I hear over and over again, whether it's in, you know, writing websites, or just in general, I hear the same point he made. Everything crumbled. My my partner left me. After this many years, I lost my business. I had a family member die. Had to move back home because I'm sick. My mom was sick, or, you know, something along those lines, and yet, in the midst of it, in such pain, in such horrible circumstances, the beauty of a rebirth happening.  
06:59  
Paul on the road to Damascus knocked off his horse and blinded. And then this rebirth happens, Peter in his denial, and then he has this meeting on the shore with Jesus. And there's this rebirth that happens.  
07:30  
Matthew walking away from his very profitable job as a tax collector and agent for Rome, leaving all of that behind. And now, what do I do? And there's this rebirth that happens, David making catastrophic decision after catastrophic decision and having it just hit rock bottom. And then there's this rebirth that happens. I  
08:19  
let me take a two minute break. Run downstairs and check on the dog real Quick. I'll be right Back.  
08:25  
Sounds Good? Okay, you  
09:58  
Okay, bye.  
10:09  
This is what we're talking about, right?  
10:12  
This is this is the glass shattering. This is  
10:18  
my life is no longer manageable, according to the methodologies that I've used or been taught. How do I move forward? I  
10:39  
yeah,  
10:54  
maybe it's just  
10:56  
not just because I think it's incredibly difficult, but a shift in perspective. Maybe those thoughts and feelings and conceptual creations ideas were a prison, bam. So as they start to break apart, yes, it's the destruction of what was comfortable to me, but also, is there a new freedom applied here, potentially?  
11:32  
Well, I think I mean it, it reminds me, I mean, I made a Facebook post along the lines of, if we, if we talk about time freedom, how come we're not talking about time prisoners, right? And one of my friends commented on there, and she said something like, it can, it can be hard to see when they're ready behind bars. You. Reminds  
12:05  
me of this. There's this old story. So there the the building in India. He so is it? Hegia, Sophia, no, the Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal was built, and there's this prisoner who built it, who, every day could look out the small window in his cell and see the top spire of it, and that was the only view he had. And it's like, just resonates with what you're saying, like, like, how do you see you're a prisoner, and this is the only view you have. It's the only view you know, because you can't see it, and Your imagination has to fill In the Rest, right? I  
14:05  
I mean, very pragmatically, we don't really ever have a need to abandon our paradigms until they fail us,  
14:18  
or maybe not even fails, but ceases to function as  
14:21  
it once did, sure.  
14:26  
So in that sense, it ceases to function as it once did. And it's a developmental upgrade that needs to happen, not a failure.  
14:38  
Okay, that's fair. I  
14:46  
Right? That's fair.  
14:51  
Like somebody was talking to me recently about their company and how their CRM has just been Pat so many times. That it's like 75% patch, yeah. And I guess within the coding world, it's like, if there's more than 25% patches, you need to scrap it and start over and rebuild something new. But you're at 75%  
15:19  
and it's extremely rare. I mean, I had a very rare experience with that, because kind of development had went so far as to break off the software into a separate company after a sharp disagreement, so that he could insist upon maintenance because the prayer project, it wasn't that, and it was the prayer. It was a DOS version of the product. It was for this client, do this, for this client, do that, and became completely unmanageable. So he came up with a way to preserve the customizability without,  
16:10  
without the patching, or having having low consequence patching that was, you know, but keeping it under that figure, I uh,  
16:27  
even It's also fairly, I mean, it's not a it's a good analogy, too, for when we're moving past, you know when, When a paradigm no longer functions like it once did we step one. Let's prop it up with this little thing, yeah. And then let's go, let's go for the next one and the next one, etc, yeah,  
16:59  
yeah. And life gets busy and things happen, and I only have time to do this, and you know, maybe days, weeks, years down the road, all of a sudden, you just have This unwieldy experience that isn't serving anybody you know,  
17:42  
that maybe that's just what our spiritual life looks like. A lot of the time I'm having these experiences and I'm busy going and doing and being and becoming and I just patch and patch and patch and patch until one day I find myself just patched to death.  
18:10  
So  
18:16  
does the analogy hold true? Then i i Is there a life without patch? Patching? I think that's, I think that's a question.  
18:29  
Is there a life without patching?  
18:33  
Yeah, so in the software world, it means dedicating a certain amount of it means leaving margin, really,  
18:51  
like  
19:01  
making tough decisions like we could add this feature, but if we want to do this right, then we should spend a month on it instead of a week, perhaps For long term sustainability, or we can do this sprint, but there'll be a debt to pay for it, and we need to be disciplined on the other side of it, to make sure that we clean up after ourselves for the mess that we create. And  
19:56  
that's a fascinating question. I.  
20:01  
Everything inside says you can only patch so much, and then the skin needs to be peeled off and removed to reveal what's underneath it.  
20:27  
If we see patching as some form of soothing or numbing,  
20:43  
today I have this thing that I'm feeling. Do I see their numb it, or do I face it? What does that look like? Can I just put a patch over it for the day, and then tonight I can sit down and Think about it, or what Does that look like? I  
21:43  
You could even see from certain perspective, prayer, meditation, journaling, like the spiritual exercises as patches,  
22:00  
or you could see them as like real engagement with the process of becoming with the metamorphosis that is happening.  
22:15  
So I guess it just depends on how you approach it. If I just want this problem to go away, that's we don't think it's a patch, but inevitably it's a patch. But if I want to understand why this thing's here, know myself better,  
22:39  
then that's not a patch,  
22:44  
that's development  
22:47  
that's becoming  
22:55  
it's like I've heard this analogy before and heard it again Recently, but it really struck me when a caterpillar goes into the cocoon, it essentially gets liquefied, and then it's transformed into a Butterfly  
23:16  
like that sounds like A painful thing,  
23:22  
Getting liquefied and  
24:34  
maybe it really comes down to simplifying. It is there's this dynamic, this paradigm of fear and bravery, fear and courage. If I approach my life via the fear lens, then I'm just always going to be patching i. I approach it from a bravery perspective, mindset view, then I'm always going to be becoming  
25:19  
because fear is bravery. Or the difference between going around or leaning in, yeah, and there's no development without leaning in,  
25:30  
yeah. Well, there is a development, but it's a development towards avoidance.  
25:39  
Well, okay,  
25:44  
you are becoming something in that  
25:48  
vein. That's something that serves you well long term, right?  
25:53  
Not something you actually want to become. I  
26:06  
interest.  
26:16  
Well, there's also this sense of I  
26:24  
this came up in conversation on Friday. You know, iron sharpening, iron sounds so wonderful until it isn't. But there's this, the imagery of of traction, I think, is borrowing from physics. Friction is required for traction. And where there is no friction, there's no traction and there's no movement. And I think part of what we're grasping for here, maybe, maybe I'm doing grasping you understand this better than I do. But what's the difference between the people who I mean, there's 1,000,001 ways to describe this experience, but the between the people who have have 40 years of the same experience versus the People who've actually had 40 years of new experiences. I  
27:45  
I kind of 40 years of the same experience, the delusional mindset that comes in with like, I've tried all those things. They didn't work. No, you've tried all those things via the lens of, I need to preserve myself. Yeah, and so they didn't work because they were through the lens of you preserving yourself so you haven't tried all the things you know about, all the things you just haven't tried them. Actually, I  
28:25  
Yeah, it's like the difference between knowing God and knowing about God.  
28:35  
I know all the things about him. I just have never engaged with those things, which will bring you to knowing,  
28:53  
yeah,  
29:02  
oh. Always learning, never coming to the truth,  
29:07  
always gathering information, never coming to a conclusion. I  
29:25  
I have a client worked with for a few years, and then beginning anytime I would make a statement that would challenge her preconceived notions, first words out of her mouth. I know. I know. I know. Do you Okay? Like, why are we here? Then if you know all of this, as if knowing was what it took for us to move forward, at some point, there's gonna have to be some do. Based on the knowing.  
30:09  
So now she catches herself when she says, I know. No, no, I acknowledge the existence of that thing.  
30:21  
Okay? Okay, okay.  
30:32  
So I have a question for you. Do you think there's a personality or psychological or like, I guess I don't know what is there a personality difference that lends people, lends towards people being in their head, versus not that predisposes them? Or is that a false distinction and a healthy, developed human leans into courage and in some form, actualizes their thoughts,  
31:12  
yeah, well, I think, like all human beings, are in their head to one degree or another, yeah, and I think it's because of the chaotic nature of the world that we live in. It's not predictable. And I think the extent to which you are in your head living in this world is the extent to which this world and its experiences have traumatized you. I  
31:52  
The extent to which you need to figure things out.  
32:00  
So where they where the chaos of the world has brought you to such a sense of felt danger, yeah, that you then become protective of yourself, right by being in your head, right, so that You can predict the chaos and avoid it, right? Yeah.  
32:53  
Interesting? You  
33:16  
I don't know Kevin, I'm used to being the guy who other people tell me their head hurts. I  
33:26  
I met my match.  
33:31  
You're welcome.  
33:39  
Yeah,  
33:47  
yeah, I think, I think in a truly healthy sense, like this is what iron sharpening iron looks like, just this, back and forth of, have you considered this? Have you considered this? And then all of a sudden, my mind is spinning like I never even considered that, and like, what are the implications of that? And but to do it in community, that's the power.  
34:15  
Well, I think much of what I  
34:25  
so much to where people get it wrong. Many people get it wrong is  
34:35  
Perry told the story of Perry Marshall told the story of one of his roundtable meetings, he talked about story of him and his wife, and how 10 years In, he played one of the songs that he played early on in their relationship, and his wife looked at him, and she's like, why are you playing that song now? And it was kind of this way. To call it, things weren't as they should be. And one of the members got all huffy and said, I felt embarrassed for you telling that story. I'm not coming back. Oh, which is a very good cultural self selection. But I think generally speaking, if you want to talk about places where this kind of discussion of dialog can exist with safety, that's that's a rare thing.  
35:42  
It is very  
35:45  
and even in a lot of contexts, the drive is towards a result and an outcome. Yep,  
36:02  
quite often an ego  
36:04  
driven result,  
36:06  
right? An ego driven outcome. Right?  
36:19  
Um, topic, slightly, yes, you were not intending to limit this, the roundtable, to just men. Were you? No, okay, bring them all. I didn't think so, but I did. I wanted to, somebody asked, and I wanted to confirm.  
36:41  
No way. Oh, that would rob us of something beautiful,  
36:46  
exactly. Oh, wow. That  
36:52  
is an interesting question in and of itself, limiting it to mental. Why would I? Why would we do that?  
37:02  
Well, it isn't interesting. But why do people do that?  
37:13  
Because women should be silent in the assembly. They should have their husbands explain things to them.  
37:27  
Well, I mean, I think, I think  
37:36  
it is very interesting to observe that even in some of the places that  
37:48  
there's very few places where women, at least from my observation, the outside looking in, there's very few places In business that women feel free to Be themselves, even in good environments and  
38:23  
Yeah, anyway,  
38:33  
interesting,  
38:39  
well, even to expand that outwards, certainly, but any group, any portion of segment of society that is not considered equal, somehow to have them invited and engaged, to have a voice within a conversation is a very difficult thing.  
39:14  
Like historically, women within the church have not been encouraged to join in the conversation,  
39:23  
right? You know,  
39:26  
and using a very wide measure here, but let's say people who have some sort of mental instability, they're not encouraged to join in the conversation, but they have an experience to share. I think that's what's so powerful about what Jesus is doing. He's inviting these marginalized people into the conversation, the prostitute, the tax collector, the Gentile. Like he's inviting them into a conversation, whereas they were historically outside of the walls of Orthodoxy,  
40:10  
right? Well, I mean tying this back to the beginning of founder mode, Steve Jobs, turns out, held a retreat every year of the people he considered to be the 100 most important people at Apple. Now you can argue that's not including marginalized people, but the interesting thing about it was that it was without any respect of org chart or hierarchy, right?  
40:41  
So by doing that, I mean intriguing ideas I'd like to hear. I'd like to hear what you have to say. Yeah. Did you ever watch the office? No, okay, so there's this one scene that the new president comes in and he decides he's going to have this round table with some of the employees. And the employees are just buffoons, but he's like, everybody like, I want to hear everybody talk. And there's this one guy who's just not great at this job, and just really like he's kind of a character of the hedonistic person that just cares about food and his pleasure, and that's it. And so he's asking for ideas, and he throws out this idea about cookies, and the boss is taking it as a metaphor, but he's actually talking about cookies.  
41:42  
Yeah, and so the boss goes on this tangent, which is, ends up being really beneficial from this idea. And he's like, at the end, he's like, No, I was just talking about cookies, and he took it and ran with it. But maybe that's what we're looking for is those people in that room that have an experience, and to be able to share their experience, even if it is about cookies, to be able to run with that. And what does that trigger in you when you think about it, and what does it what what thoughts does it create in me? And how do we move forward from there?  
42:24  
There's a lot of people in these contexts, too, if they're just thinking about cookies, they feel like they don't belong in these types of conversations, right? Because I'm so simple and so practical. And how does this? Yeah, cool, cool. I don't have anything to contribute.  
42:50  
How do we change that?  
42:53  
Change that,  
42:54  
and I think it's providing an environment like we're providing saying, Let's investigate this. Let's investigate a who you are, how your thought process was developed, and then what is the input all these people have on your thought process that can move us forward? Yeah, yeah.  
43:35  
I think that's a good place to pause. I think so my brain's starting to get pride.  
43:42  
We both got days.  
43:43

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
00:46  
Good morning,  
Matthias Miller  00:47  
good morning.  
00:52  
That voice is always shocking. It says recording in progress could start that's not your voice.  
Matthias Miller  01:01  
They should actually do that. They should let you, you know, customers it, yeah, yeah,  
01:10  
then I can make a joke out of it, and everything would be fine.  
Matthias Miller  01:13  
Exactly.  
01:14  
You are being watched.  
Matthias Miller  01:16  
You are being watched. Big Brother is looking over your shoulder. I  
01:20  
I mean, it's fair, it's what's happening.  
Matthias Miller  01:26  
It is what's happening. You know, we live in 2024 when 911 is now about do you remember tower seven? And have you watched all of these other videos? And it's not about the terrorists, so right, to  
01:49  
summarize that it's not about what actually happened. Yeah, even though you live in 2024 when,  
Matthias Miller  02:02  
uh, has there ever been more of a battle over reality?  
02:08  
I  
Matthias Miller  02:09  
I don't think so. I mean, you have to understand that. I'll you know, Malcolm gladwells, no Malcolm Muggeridge, sorry, wrong. Malcolm. Malcolm muggeridge's quote about all news is old news happening to new people? I mean, yeah.  
02:27  
Or Solomon's quote, there's nothing new under the sun. Nothing  
Matthias Miller  02:32  
new under the sun.  
02:34  
Yeah, I have a new idea. No, you don't. No, you don't. It's just new to you,  
Matthias Miller  02:42  
and it might even be new to everybody else around you,  
02:47  
but not to the world,  
Matthias Miller  02:49  
but not to the world. Oh, man,  
02:54  
I feel like I could just vent for a good two hours straight. I I legitimately saw four minutes of the debate last night, and I would just, I'm done. I  
Matthias Miller  03:17  
yeah, yes.  
03:24  
There's so many other things I could do with my time,  
Matthias Miller  03:29  
but aren't you worried about the cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio?  
03:36  
No, maybe that makes me a horrible person, but no,  
Matthias Miller  03:43  
you're the ones getting eaten by terrorists anyway. Oh, gracious, there's no winning. No, no.  
03:59  
Yeah, I honestly had this thought yesterday I was I was reading something, and then like, was praying, and it's like, I know I've heard throughout my life, Jesus is the only way, and I believe that with everything inside me, but it became a new level of real like yesterday, as I was praying, like, there is no other way. Like this has gone so far down a path that, like, there's no other way, Jesus, you have to do something. Yeah. Yeah.  
Matthias Miller  04:46  
Well, I mean, it is, you know, on one hand, it's impressive, the success that we've enjoyed as a nation, and how cohesive we've been for how long. But then you also. Think about are very bloodied and very sketchy History Throughout that time. So it's part of the patriotism narrative has been maintaining hope in our country by painting it in positive colors. And there's a place for, I mean, there's certainly a place for hope. Oh yeah. I mean, we need it. Sometimes it's almost worse when you have the illusion. It's it's sometimes easier to deal with life as it shouldn't be when you just deal with life as it shouldn't be, but when you it's kind of actually does have a correlation. But the glass shattering event is when you've been living under illusion and falsehood, the awakening makes it worse. West Stafford was talking about. So he grew up in Africa.  
06:13  
He got her delusions are shattered.  
Matthias Miller  06:18  
He grew up in in Africa. Yeah, exactly. And he was constantly losing his friends, and, you know, he asked his dad one time in tears when, when his chart was going to be to die. And his dad was like, Well, do you see these scratch marks in the arm? He's like, Yeah. He's like, That's a vaccine. That means you're not going to get this and you're not going to die, which just made the problem so much more worse. How did I, especially in that culture, very much and we look out for each other, you have to this is how we survive. How come I have it? He showed the example. One of the worst things you could have done to him is give him two pieces of candy, because he could have had one, and he had a dozen friends, and who was he going to pick for the other one? So just give me one. Don't make me. Education became a challenge because they were so into sharing that it wasn't cheating, it was helping each other out. And so that was the frame. And then he comes to New York City and walks into a grocery store filled with groceries. He's like, Oh, that was his coming back, his glass shattering event, like there is enough food. And then walks into a pharmacy, and he sees and asks them, what is this place? And it's like, medicines. And he's like, Well, do you have vaccines? And like, yes, we have, in the back, he's like, so we could have, there are enough resources in the world that could have saved these kids lives. And then there's, you know, lashing out in anger because of these cold, heartless people, and then coming around and realizing that they're not called it heartless. They're just ignorant. They've never lived a life where they don't that harvest meant some people were going to starve. Yeah, no idea.  
08:14  
Never lived on the razor's edge.  
08:17  
On the razor edge, I  
08:25  
A there's, there's a movie number of years ago. It's called A Million Ways to Die in the West. It was a comedy movie, but the whole premise was like, if we today went and lived like in the westward movement across the United States. The thing that would be most shocking to us is how readily available death was. Like, you could step in a hole and break your ankle and die infection. You can't move, you know, all that kind of stuff, like, can, can't keep up, whatever, yeah, wild animals like, all everything. It's like we are so insulated from the reality of life. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I think we've made amazing progress in that area, but it also creates a mindset, a delusional mindset where we can focus on, how do I get more money? Yeah,  
09:38  
one of the issues  
09:39  
we struggle with and our current world in places that are less developed for 100 years ago, these are not issues. You have to have an increasing amount of disposable time to have these. Issues, and if you're spending time surviving and taking care of your community, you don't have time to mess with these things,  
Matthias Miller  10:08  
right? Well, it's, it's, it's almost like I I mean, okay, let's take a look at masculinity, whatever that means, if, if you accept that there's a primal need to hunt and to fight and to defend and to build. And then you you create. We're just going to pick on corporate you create. Corporate environments can be whatever business environments in which you're fed, you're like the game is all mental and political, And it's way more complex. I mean, if you're fighting for your for your, for your life, it ends up being mostly binary, like look out for dangers, and if you see that bear coming after you, you're either, you know, you'd better be armed. You better have some kind of escape, some kind of whatever. But there's no psychologically manipulating the bear to think that you're a cub. No,  
11:56  
that doesn't happen. That  
Matthias Miller  11:58  
doesn't happen. And in the case of illnesses, it's there's limited number of resources, though, it's just using all the standard protocols, whatever that may be, rest and, you know, whatever, like on one hand, we're grateful that we don't have to play the game. Well, no, I mean, it's a little bit of in that other environment. You have to get in the arena, or you're not going to belong in the community, or you're not going to belong, or you're not going to stay alive, right? And and with disposable time and disposable income Being in the arena becomes optional, right? I  
13:13  
Hello, the basically, to me, is the incredible lack of maturity that comes about. Reading in First Corinthians three, Paul starts off by talking about, I I fed you with milk because you were babies and didn't have solid food, and it's the time for you to start eating solid food. But you're incredibly immature, because you live in Corinth, a place in which, and this is my interpretation, he doesn't say this, but you live in Corinth, in a place where there's so much abundance and lavish wealth that you haven't had to be mature. And then he starts going into like, you chose sides. I follow Apollos. I follow Paul. I follow, you know, all these things, and it's like, Isn't it very relatable to what's happening in our society right now? I follow Kamal. I follow Trump like, yeah, it's very immature. It's not about the actual issues. It's not about the.  
Matthias Miller  15:01  
Not about holding us. It's about belonging. I It's interesting how these patterns you can this is kind of a meta narrative that applies everywhere. The fastest way to flesh out problems in a business is to drain cash. And there's one business advisor who basically made that a strategy. Every x months, we're going to pull cash and we're going to look at what breaks like. Where is this not that's how we find the holes. That's how we find the holes. And I mean in almost every mean profit hides the multitude of sins. And it's not when I mean the economy tightening or slowing down or shifting, usually is just a shaking to me that gets either to shake free companies that aren't contributing value into the economy so they close down or within companies that are proactive To shake free from team members who aren't performing um. Isn't there a continuum between somewhere there's a healthy continuum between, like survival and I I don't know how to describe it, complacent, complacency,  
17:33  
comfort, comfort seeking, comfort,  
Matthias Miller  17:35  
comfort seeking. Like isn't here. Let me get my like, like we have somewhere here. Well, it's not even comfort seeking. It's just it is straight up comfort. And here it's, it's fight or flight. I uh, survival, okay, so, and let's put survival up top here. And let's put over abundance, I don't know, or oversupply. And so this becomes living here on the razor's edge at some level, at the point, at some point in this space becomes unhealthy here. So this is unhealthy. And over on this space, it becomes unproductive.  
18:40  
What we  
Matthias Miller  18:42  
entitled? And what we see is we talked about this, Bezos musk, etc, are intentionally pushing themselves over in this direction? Yep, and they may even be pushing themselves all the way over there. That's their choice. I'm not an advocate. I don't think it's productive, right? But there's a dial that you can turn. What  
19:17  
does that dial look like in your conception.  
Matthias Miller  19:21  
In my conception, the dial is something like, I mean, I think it is a bit of dropping the safety net, yeah, which is so, I mean, we have the so here in the middle, we have the dial. This is the, and it's, it's, you know, okay, so dropping safety net, which may mean, I. Uh, you know, which may mean draining cash. And that doesn't mean that, literally, you go spend it all or give it all away, but it may mean we are intentionally removing cash from this entity so that to put put stress on this, on it, to get it to produce or but, I mean, isn't, but isn't? This also workouts. This is also physical fitness, so you have over calories. Comfort, not just comfort seeking, but living income,  
20:47  
unproductive,  
Matthias Miller  20:47  
entitled, unproductive entitled, overweight, curable, obesity, type two diabetes, type two diabetes, and now we can throw in dimension, other mental related things into that as well. So here we have extreme forms of high intensity workouts. Yeah, CrossFit, the bro CrossFit, if I can nuance, yeah,  
21:22  
uh huh, yeah, exactly, yeah,  
Matthias Miller  21:24  
yeah, and then, and then, but here in the middle. So what? What is this? What is the safety net? I don't know what the safety net really ends up being, but there's this intentional choice to, I mean, one of the, oh, what is it? There's a term for this. I don't remember what it is, but the health trainer I did a health day a month or so ago, and he was talking about the concept of every workout in every every workout should be optimized for max reps. So you go to the you go to the point where you could not do more.  
22:12  
Yeah, it's the same thing in running. There's programs that teach you to run to your limit for as long as you can. So to optimize the stress, there's even there's a guy really big on YouTube, he talks about time under tension. If you increase your time under tension, you'll get stronger.  
Matthias Miller  22:35  
Yes, which is another way to So, which ends up being less joint strain, but you can still then get to your So, so this to your limit. So this is run slash workout to limit. Yeah, and, but where you see injuries happening is when, when you attempt to go past that point when  
23:05  
you ignore the call your body's calling. I've had enough. You ignore it. I wish it's funny. I was just when I was in Texas, I was talking to somebody, and he was talking about how he had hurt his knee or something, skiing, and he's like, wouldn't you know it was the last run of the day? And if I've heard that story 1000 times, the last run of the day is when I got hurt. I pushed myself to go one more time I got hurt. It's like your body's saying, like, enough is enough, and you keep going.  
Matthias Miller  23:42  
So which is really interesting, because there's also this, okay, so, okay, body screen stop,  
23:54  
or like Gabor mate's book, when the body says no, on an emotional level, he's talking about this process. What happens when the body says, no,  
Matthias Miller  24:06  
okay, but you've also talked about the the point, because there's this point in running which you're more familiar with, but I've experienced it myself, where you're not that far in and your body is screaming, bloody murder, like, just stop it, and if you just say no, you're okay, you're safe, we can do this. And you push through a few minutes of that, and all of a sudden you hit this whole other wind. Yes, of I could just go on forever,  
24:34  
yeah. So I don't think it's, I don't think it's the body saying no at that point, that's the mind.  
Matthias Miller  24:44  
So then you have the body says, Stop or and this is the, by the way, okay, this is the Just One More injury. Then we have the mind. A screen stop, and this is where we stop prior to the limit. Yes,  
25:11  
and a lot of it comes so because I think it connects really deeply to the oversupply that come for unproductive, entitled My mind is used to this, and I'm trying to do this, and it's fighting back against that, that tension between those two poles fighting  
Matthias Miller  25:34  
for safety and familiarity. Yeah, okay, there's also really interesting business book that talks about just one more, like it's, and I'm not quite sure how I feel the power of one more, I think, yeah, but, and, I mean, maybe we've already answered this. I think the question is determining, well, I don't know that it's a simple answer. If I had to answer it with just one more, my answer would be, first of all, you have to recognize you're always sacrificing something for just one more. So what is it? Are you sacrificing something of value? So you're just one more? Could be, and I haven't read the book, so I'm just using it off the off the concept, but just one more, it could be one more sales meeting every single day, right? Which could be at the expense of payment, one more phone call, one more phone call,  
26:49  
yeah, which?  
Matthias Miller  26:52  
Which could be in in some cases, one more drink, one more drink. There you go. There you go.  
27:00  
There you go. This resonates with me deeply. I really am drawn into this whole paradigm that we have up here. A friend of mine who just recently passed away a year ago, covid. That's beside the point. I remember when I was young, I was probably 1819, and he was the dad of one of my close friends, and I became close with him. I remember him talking about he was at work, and he was a salesman. He sell, sold plastic water jugs, like all that kind of stuff, milk containers, everything. And he was telling me a story like, yeah, I was at work on Friday, and I was it was done with a week. I just wanted to go home, and my boss said, just make one more sales call. So make one more. And so he made one more. And he happened to make a big sale, and that one more. And then the the the wisdom imparted. There was just do one more, and it never resonated with me, because I was like, You were exhausted. You had given everything you could in this week, and yet you did one more, and you got a positive reinforcement from it, but it was unhealthy for you.  
28:18  
Wow.  
28:21  
Wow, obviously, I didn't have the word to quant. Were to quantify that at the age. But as I look back now, it's like, no, this is like, this was pushing yourself beyond your limit.  
Matthias Miller  28:35  
And if you really want to look at it, your his boss was programming him with all the feel good chemicals of over exerting himself and over committing himself to work, yes, yeah, and  
28:57  
that was Okay, because it's socially acceptable.  
Matthias Miller  29:00  
So but then the question really comes down to, and maybe it is as simple as mind body discernment is, what is your Well, we're still going to go back to priorities. What are you sacrificing? And right? Okay with sacrifice. Oh, I mean, okay, because I know people sometimes push back on this, but we we have an abundance of time, but it's still finite, yeah, so you can have one more sale, or you can have one more hour with your family, right?  
29:39  
This is fascinating. So a buddy of mine owns a Chick fil A, and he has for 10 years, and I've walked with Him through the whole thing, and he has been through the ringer, through hell and back, because this owning this place is ridiculous. There. There's not only one fire to put out. There's like multiple stage five fires every day, sometimes literal fire. And I've known him for for 20 years, and I have seen this guy be so devout work wise, to do the right thing, to approach things the right way, and I respect that so much in him, and then also to do that with his family. And I've respected him so much. And just last week, we had this conversation, and he was saying, I just came to the realization that all these years I've been fighting the natural flow of things. There was a drive in me to do more, to be more, to be presented as the thing. And I had to, I had to say to I was like, I've admired you all these years for those things, but really, your dysfunction is just socially acceptable. Yeah, you got positive affirmation for it, yeah, but your body's breaking down. Your emotions are breaking down, all that stuff.  
Matthias Miller  31:14  
Well, we have a word for it. We call it discipline,  
31:18  
yes, which really, if you translate it is self abuse,  
31:31  
because it he like, that's the, that's the perfect word is, is he is the most disciplined person I know, all the way down to how he eats, like I remember sitting in lunch with him and watching him eat. And this guy would go to a fish taco place, and he would get tortilla and fish, and that's all, nothing else on it. And I, I remember once years ago, I called him a sociopath because he ate like that, and he just laughs. I'm like, How do you even do that? There's no taste there. You're not even enjoying it. He's like, No, I enjoy it. It gives me fuel. I'm like, no, no, that's that's fun.  
Matthias Miller  32:13  
Yes, yes, yes,  
32:17  
you're just functional.  
Matthias Miller  32:21  
So, okay, so, so, I mean, this is this is fun, just one more myth. So this is rewarding, self abuse, socially acceptable for know, dysfunction. But then there's also this interesting thing with discipline. Discipline. Think of the look at, I mean, this should have been obvious. I was looking at etymology. Guess what? The root word of discipline is, disciple. I Yeah, so discipline is all about learning and being shaped. Yes, to follow a person, to follow the life of a person,  
33:18  
right? Follow me as I follow Christ, as Paul would say,  
Matthias Miller  33:21  
Yep. And what we've taken it to be, which is, which is, which is a better interpretation. You look at the gifts of the spirit of self control as a fruit. The problem is that we have these. I mean, you could, you could put these both, but, but here we've taken it to mean regimented, unbending. I and we put the self abuse in here. Perfect number one, which is nothing  
34:19  
I have. I have a client who absolutely adores Kobe Bryant, always has, and he around the time that Kobe died and the the helicopter crash, he's like, so sad, so upset. He's like, what happened? I was like, it was the manifestation of his ego. He had pushed the limit so hard for so long that the real world did not even play into his mindset. This man was told, we cannot fly a helicopter through the fog. It is very dangerous. And he looked at the pie. It and said, Let's go  
35:04  
and killed everybody on that helicopter. And then, you know who gets blamed for the crash?  
Matthias Miller  35:12  
I'm sure it's  
35:16  
and he should have said, No, I'm not going, of course, but you're standing in front of this man who was so utterly delusional and so revered throughout  
Matthias Miller  35:25  
the world.  
35:28  
You say no to him,  
35:35  
that's that's the discipline  
Matthias Miller  35:38  
Angie will if you say no and you walk away, you will never get credit for saving his life. No, you will only be the guy, only be known as the guy who stood up to Kobe and told him no and you're  
35:50  
the jerk. You're  
Matthias Miller  35:52  
the jerk, you're the jerk. Yeah. Okay. Very fascinating.  
36:09  
Yeah, and it's like, how do you raise you? How do you raise your children? Is it discipline, the true let the true definition of discipline, or is it punishment? I was just reading an article this morning that was was talking about that verse in Proverbs that says, Spare the rod, spoil the child, and we see that as an endorsement on beating our children. You don't understand the metaphor that's being used. Shepherds carried rods and they carried hooks, staffs and rods. The rod was to protect the sheep from outside forces. A shepherd would never beat their sheep with the rod. They would use the hook to guide them. Yeah. I was raised in an environment where for the slightest thing, you would get smacked, you would get beat, and that verse was, was was preached at me the entirety of my life. We don't want you to be spoiled and entitled. Well, I'm not spoiled and entitled. So that happened, but what about all the emotional events on the other  
Matthias Miller  37:28  
Exactly, exactly? Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, that's a rabbit trail to fall deep down,  
37:41  
right? We could go years on that one.  
Matthias Miller  37:45  
We could go years on that one. Oh, goodness, I mean, but no notice, too. I think this is really interesting, too. Where this is, this is all outside, outside in. It's all externalized. And this is, this is inside out. It's all internalized. It's all formation and transformation and becoming,  
38:12  
yeah, well, my mind keeps going back to it, but like that whole not sparing the rod is, Do not neglect to guide your child. Do not neglect to be in these conversations, because you destroy your child. If you refuse to have these conversations, you  
38:45  
your employee, your friends, Your fellow church member, whatever the case may be. I  
39:37  
again talking about self control, let's be honest about how self control is developed. You make a mistake and it hurts bad enough that it leaves a mark, and you gain wisdom from it. But most of us approach self control via fear dynamic, fear dynamic and. I don't want that. I  
Matthias Miller  41:05  
I mean, I think there's just one of the things that discipline does in this regimented sense, is it? I mean, it does two things. One, it teaches you that the natural flow doesn't work, and it it Well, I mean, maybe that is the biggest thing. It keeps you from trusting. It teaches you that it doesn't work. And I think there's a big fear. Well, I can speak for myself. I doubt that I'm alone. Is when that that, that breaking, breaking out of this, because you have the the reward cycle, breaking out of it is really difficult. Yeah, it's it is it is addictive and and if you don't have, for myself, being around people who didn't buy into this and had proof that that trusting the natural process, what you're saying is you will live. You will experience life. You will experience pain. The pain will teach you, and you can allow yourself to just go through the process, and you will develop self control just by the nature of living life. You allow yourself to learn, to learn, yeah, but there's such a and so with the fear that you're talking about does is forces you I don't want it to be. I Well, fear always does this. Fear always fights flow. Fear always forces us to control so where the flow is. What if I don't like the outcome? What if it doesn't look like the way I want it to. What if other people don't like the outcome? What if it doesn't look like they want it to? What if? What if the outcomes that I require of the flow, I have these standards that must be met for the outcome of the flow. What if they're not met in a in a parenting context, it's the fear is, I don't want my kids to end up like X, Y and Z, right? And instead of just leaning in to the flow,  
43:55  
you make your kids look like X, Y and Z. You make your kids look like X, Y and Z, you become what you be old,  
Matthias Miller  44:03  
yeah, so really takes a tremendous amount of courage to lean back from, to lean out of that. I  
44:28  
yeah,  
44:34  
when there's this conditioning that makes you afraid of consequences, afraid of punishment, and so the only option you have at that point is to be perfect.  
44:58  
And it's overcoming that. Year to walk that line that you drew. I don't have to be perfect. I can just be me. I can make mistakes. I can learn from them. I can grow in wisdom. I can get stronger like and sometimes that'll take decades. I  
Matthias Miller  45:29  
yeah, I  
45:49  
here's what we're talking about. All of our conversation boiled down to these very fundamental human experiences. We start here, we work and work and work till we get down here. And I think that's the value in walking that journey with this group. Let's walk this journey. See what this looks like. Get down to the foundational human experiences, see what happens. I  
Matthias Miller  46:33  
think people are dying for that  
46:39  
to have that experience, because the rest of this stuff, the coaches and what they're doing is teaching you to put band aids on these things Not actually address the issue. Yeah,  
47:01  
your business isn't working, you need to manipulate better.  
Matthias Miller  47:17  
And very impromptu, a very interesting LinkedIn discussion I'm not quite sure how I feel about it, the attention. So if you got this email from a founder, would you do business with them again? Why or why not? And the quote was, no worries. A lot of people at the marketing managers were in the pants. Make the decisions perfectly understandable, good luck, variety of responses, one you know, one calling out a friend who's also the founder and the marketer and jabbing at them that it was probably them talking about themselves. Oh, so another one suggesting that it's just bad copy. And, you know, they just, you don't really know intent. Another one being like, well, if somebody has the willingness to talk down to somebody else in that kind of a way, that's problematic. Yeah, I'm  
48:30  
having issue with that, because it's manipulative.  
Matthias Miller  48:35  
It is manipulative. So anyway, it's interesting how it's been very interesting for me to observe. First of all, I want to and the guy who was taking both sides, I said, I just was, like, basically said more. I moved away from emotional reactivity and started listening to my gut on these things, you know, the like, like, that's there you go, like, I'm just doing that, which is probably not a widely most of the stuff manipulation. Don't assume intent is is ways of Okay, so here's where the fun conversation gets in. So if we talk about, let's talk about one more in the context of so here's the concept context we have a conversation. Action with manipulation, and let's just call it red flags. So for myself, my experience is viscerally body slash gut, the style. But this is an acceptable rule in business, so this is an acceptable behavior, yeah, then, then I need rules to accommodate it, right? So what are the rules to accommodate? It's, don't assume intent. Thick skin. Businesses is business. You know, all of those types of things. I yeah, here's another good one. My wife and I had a conversation about this be the bigger person and I lead up. This is really insightful. You and I talked about this separately. Lead up was a content concept that I bought into to justify this. Yep, the real rule was multi premise and, and this was not mind saying no. In this case, this is gut saying no. But the response is, come like, just one more.  
52:17  
One more.  
Matthias Miller  52:19  
Just one more. And it can even be like, I mean, we see this rant coming. Rant like, how many people in leadership have been I help one of my clients with this. We have trouble in this, with this department, with this issue. Well, let's have a conversation. Have you talked to the person responsible? Yes, we have. Has it changed? No, by the way, fun fact, how many times have you brought this up? Oh, I don't know, half a dozen. Have you made it very clear? Yeah, we made it really clear. Well, just one more. Just one like, Would would you stop? Like, stop walking past this. You know, internally what needs to happen? Yeah, don't do the one more up. Yeah, there's a limit. There's allow this to be, be a limit, very different from a young kid, a or younger old age doesn't matter, underdeveloped individual, and every time and Okay, so I don't have a specific scenario, but imagine a contrary scenario. It's like this guy just doesn't get it. Well, okay, so let's talk about it. Well, one time he made this mistake, and we had to teach him, X, Y and Z. Well, okay, did you did? Did it ever happen? No, never happen again. But then there was another time when he did this. Well, well, that's interesting. Did that ever like? What happened with that? Well, he Yeah, he learned. He changed his process. He, by the way, the question then becomes, did you ever train the guy which are no, like, he  
54:08  
should just figure it out. We were too busy, and we had all these things going on, and yeah,  
Matthias Miller  54:15  
and your mind is telling you stop. I don't like, I just want it to be on, on autopilot. I don't like having to actually train and develop people and right? And once again, I'm not completely opposed to you not liking to do that, but it is your responsibility, right in the jurisdiction, to make sure that it happens. Yeah,  
54:36  
yeah. I don't take the time. I don't have the time to train people. You're a manager. That is your job.  
54:45  
Exactly,  
54:47  
exactly. No, I've got all these high level things going on. No, you're a manager. Your job is to manage people, to train them. You. That's your job. Or you're a pastor, your job is to shepherd your people. But I have, you know, this marketing and I had  
Matthias Miller  55:13  
so, okay, here's a very interesting thing I would love to dissect water. So we're having a lot of fun. I'm having fun with my outlines or my diagrams.  
55:24  
I love this. So here  
Matthias Miller  55:26  
is, here is, you know, whether it's manager or Shepherd. Here is the fold, and this is, this is the this is the people, how are they doing? And this is, you know, holistically, emotionally, practically, so from from the manager side, this is, are they engaged? Is there? Are they drama free? Are they? But then there's also practically, are they hitting targets? Are they being productive? And here it's, are they, you know, how is their spiritual? Spiritual Formation are, are their bills being paid? Do they do? Do they need financial help? Do they need medical help? Do they need like, how is? How is their their marriage? If they're married, how are they doing, emotionally? And a good manager or Shepherd has eyes? This is going to be weird, but eyes inward on here. Well, hmm, what we're describing, which, by the way, nothing's situation, not unusual, but what happens when they have eyes out here? And two questions I would have is probably the biggest question I would have is, what is it? Maybe this is the answer. I don't want to hear your thoughts. It seems to me that somebody who is hardwired, well, put, put a let's get, let's contrast a hunter and a shepherd. A hunter by definition, has eyes externally, looking for looking for threats, but also looking for where's the next meal?  
58:03  
Resources, slash threads.  
Matthias Miller  58:06  
Resources, slash threads, Shepherd, whether through nature or nurture, or probably, realistically, a combination of those things, as has a first of all, has a natural inclination to look at the fold, but then also has been discipled going back into this is how you do it. This is what you watch for. These are the things you need to pay attention to. And so, and I think, I mean maybe, maybe maybe this isn't, isn't a good question, but, but I think one of the questions is to potential avenues of exploration. How much is nature? How much is nurture? And also, what causes? What causes this instead of this? I  
59:12  
impure motives.  
59:22  
And this is just experiential for me, you may want to be in this place because it provides some sort of benefit for you. In the position of Shepherd, manager, provide some sort of business benefit for you, I uh,  
Matthias Miller  59:43  
that's, that's kind of where my, my brain was going in different, different, yes, which turns us from a, so this is in a. I mean, it's an end versus means, it's, it's, I want something, but I can't find it in here. Yeah, and I think for somebody who is actually a true manager and shepherd, there's something that they want, that they only find in here, which is the fulfillment of seeing other people thrive, of empowering other people coming alongside them, working with them, right? And if you can't. And I mean, I think this is, this could be a even a broader concept of Yeah.  
1:00:43  
Well, it strikes me that that for those looking externally, this is a vehicle Yes. For those looking internally, this is the whole deal. Yes, yeah, like you said, a means to an end, versus, like, a calling. This is the go back to the words of Jesus. You want to be first, be last. This the shepherd is a last physician. It's the least of these position. Yeah, it is not a first position. But what do we see in CEOs or church pastors or that kind of thing. It's not a servant of all. It's not of the first shall be last. It's a self promotion.  
Matthias Miller  1:01:37  
But do you know how many businesses and churches would change if the executive pastor or if the senior pastor and CEO would promote this into a number one position, right? Would value this as this is the work. Yeah, yeah, because all of the issues, I mean, issues around from a church issues around retention and growth our culture, they're all cultural. The other interesting  
1:02:16  
thing is, it just struck me, and I hadn't seen this before, but there's a word that's very similar to shepherd that we've utilized many times over these conversations. I love it, yeah. So you have the YOU HAVE THE TRUE Sherpa who's walking with the fold through the valley of the shadow of death with the rod and staff comforting his people. And then you have the armchair Sherpa that's looking out externally,  
Matthias Miller  1:02:56  
yes, yes, yes. And yes, but by the way, this is a the vehicle versus the whole deal is a whole other thing. And I've had this conversation argument with many people, and then, you know, I let them go their course, but people insist that the vehicle is the fastest path to get to where they want to go.  
1:03:26  
Well, right there, right there. You're looking at efficiency, the fastest path. Why are you so urgent?  
Matthias Miller  1:03:42  
I uh, but it's very well, I mean, but the reason is, in my opinion, okay, experientially, most people don't see a path between a natural path between where they are and The whole deal. So they jump on a vehicle, on the first, second or third vehicle that they can find, in hopes that's what's going to actually take them there instead of walking towards the whole deal, right?  
1:04:42  
Yeah. Interesting. I  
1:05:26  
uh, it's, there's this old, uh, old parable I've heard. I'm gonna change a little bit because the original parable quite inappropriate,  
1:05:37  
but you have two pastors standing on a hill and they see a crowd of people down in the valley. And one pastor looks at the other and says, let's run down there and convert them, or get we'll be able to convert some of them. And then the other pastor goes, how about we walk down there and convert them all? And the difference between the urgency and the rush versus the process. It's like my dog, my dog wants so badly to be friends with my cat so badly, wants to play with him, wants to be friends with him, but every time they're in close proximity, he runs up and starts barking at the cat and scares the cat. Cat runs away. If you just walked over and laid down, you guys would become fast Friends. It's that lion laying With the lamb narrative So  
Matthias Miller  1:07:47  
so How do you determine pacing.  
1:08:13  
One word, answer your gut. Listen to your gut and  
1:08:44  
yeah.  
Matthias Miller  1:08:54  
And the challenge with the vehicle versus the whole deal is that people have There, there is this gut, directive, direction. Man, there is so much stigma against that. Yeah, so much. I because you have, I mean, I think you have people on both sides. You have the immature, the people who mistake emotionalism for gut. I. And in people who I mean, you have emotionalism, intellectualism, I mean, this is another kind of classic axis shift, where people are looking at the emotionalism versus intellectualism on a continuum. But it's but, but really we're looking at looking at this from a completely different angle, which is listening to your gut. Yeah. Yeah. I I mean, you could even call this, I don't know that this is the,  
1:11:15  
oh, this. This hits real quick here. If we look at intellect, just the concept of intellect. On a psychological level, the primary driver for intellect is an open openness to experience. That's how your intellect is developed. Okay? So in that sense, emotionalism is the denial of openness to experience. It keeps us from experience,  
Matthias Miller  1:12:00  
and it looks so let's play this out. There's one of two ways. One is that we're probably most familiar with, is I'm scared out of my mind, therefore I'm not going to do it. But then there's also the I am okay. This is my problem with, with any form of manipulative selling, just as an example, but, but I'm going to get people into an excited state and out of this sense of unbridled excitement. Can you link? Can you draw the line between unbridled excitement and denying openness to experience fantasy? Yeah, so I mean, this is the openness to experience of life as it is, life as it is reality,  
1:13:08  
because a lot of people say they're intellectuals, but in reality, their intellectual their thought process, their mind, is just a defense mechanism that is keeping them from reality? Yeah, it's not an intellectual you just use pseudo logical arguments to avoid experience. You  
Matthias Miller  1:13:43  
fear versus fantasy, yeah, is a great term.  
1:13:53  
Or fantasy in response to fear.  
1:13:59  
Sure,  
1:14:21  
and the true openness to experience is to trust your gut.  
Matthias Miller  1:14:27  
I think this is the real. I think this is the real, you know, okay, here's perhaps the real quadrant. So this is really openness to experience. I and so you have wisdom. Up here, you have folly. Down here, you have peace, joy, love, groundedness up here, the fruits of the Spirit. The fruits of the Spirit. You have fear and fantasy down here, and this is a the ultimate in really what the fundamental argument is? What is more real, this or this isn't even primal, what is ego might be a better word down here.  
1:15:45  
Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  1:15:50  
what, what is, what is more real? Gut versus ego? That's the battleground. That's the battleground. And people who have attachment to the ego will say, gut is false. People who have connection to the gut will set to, will say, ego is false, and, and, and you have to, you have to pick a side. I  
1:16:24  
or you could be strong enough to stand in the middle in humility.  
1:16:32  
That's fair  
1:16:36  
this end of the day. I don't know. I don't know if this May, this is my ego protect myself, or this is my gut. I can make the best decision I can with the information I have and learn from what has happened, and that's the wisdom so  
Matthias Miller  1:16:57  
the but the very fact that you're standing in the middle with an openness to experience of saying that, I don't know, and I'm going to lean in, pulls you, pulls you upward, yeah,  
1:17:12  
I don't know, but I'm not going to run to these things, fear, fantasy, all that kind of stuff,  
1:17:26  
because that hasn't worked for me. I've seen that play out too many times, right? And that's the movement upwards. Yeah, yeah. I  
1:17:49  
fun stuff. My brain's fried and  
1:17:55  
it's only 721,  
1:17:58  
all right, I just like a full day enemy. I I love it.  
Matthias Miller  1:18:11  
I am trying to nail down schedule. I've got a guy who wants to potentially schedule one day either on the 16th through the 23rd and I've been trying to reach his assistant nail it down, but I will, let's do this. Let's tentatively plan for Monday morning, and if I cancel the event, I'll try to shoot you an email as well. But yeah, if that sounds good, yeah, that sounds good. I would like to also chat sometime about kind of start filling this event. Yeah,  
1:18:47  
yeah, let's make sure we talk about that next time. Okay, sounds good. All right, my friend, have a good day.  
Matthias Miller  1:18:54  
Thanks. You too. Bye, bye.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
00:21  
Good morning. Good morning.  
00:26  
How are you doing?  
00:29  
I'm awake.  
00:33  
Sounds fair? That's all I can expect this early in the morning from myself, I'm awake.  
00:49  
Oh man, how are you? Good? Good?  
00:53  
Awake. Here.  
01:04  
Okay,  
01:08  
where did we leave off?  
01:10  
Title, that's right. I  
01:24  
there's so many paths we could go down. I  
01:53  
What's the key  
01:54  
work? Key core concept we're trying to get across. We're trying to communicate. I  
Matthias Miller  02:39  
fundamentally, it's that there's a way to there's, there's a an approach to business in leadership that has the appearance of wisdom, but and then fill in the blank is broken, is backwards, is upside down, is even harmful, and that it requires a fundamentally Different approach and perspective. So That's one core concept I I think another core concept comes down to the ideas of self disclosure and Self Protection  
04:25  
that we've talked about,  
04:39  
the more you  
04:48  
the more you grow, the more you tend to i.  
Matthias Miller  05:06  
The more vulnerable you end up feeling, The more you end up insulating yourself. I  
08:20  
What are Your thoughts?  
08:27  
I agree with sort of things, and I see that those things you mentioned,  
08:36  
but to me, there's something deeper, something  
08:41  
underneath that and behind that,  
08:48  
the true  
08:54  
the true motive, The true brilliance of what we're being led to and is beyond The applicable skill to a state of being right. I  
09:24  
so what's that state of being?  
09:36  
Talked about, union we've talked about, I the death and resurrection and.  
10:01  
That each person has to make a choice to do that like last shattering moment, embracing the lesson that's coming from.  
Matthias Miller  10:16  
Do people know the state of being that they're after.  
10:28  
Now, most people, I think, are chasing the emotion.  
Matthias Miller  10:37  
And the emotion is i  
10:45  
i think it goes back to  
10:54  
the pursuit of happiness. I  
11:03  
i think the system was flawed from the beginning, because maybe that's that's the promise that was made in the garden.  
11:20  
Pursue your happiness,  
11:24  
which set us on this striving, earning path to happiness. It's the carrot on the stick that's dangled in front of us.  
11:46  
Killing the American dream, yeah,  
11:52  
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I  
12:03  
And  
12:06  
with that, there's a pursuit of ease,  
12:15  
like playing Whack a Mole.  
12:18  
I see happiness over here. I go over here. I see it over here. I go over here, and it never stops. So,  
Matthias Miller  12:28  
I mean, we don't need more bullet points, but the classic spread too thin, shiny object syndrome, because there is this thing over here, and I'm making, I mean, the business management side of me is like, what are you optimizing for? You're always optimizing for some kind of variable, right? So, and when you're optimizing for happiness, then you well, on my metro sister Reeve, a guy who split tested himself to death, literally or not to death, but his his business to the ground, and he continued iterating and making one change after the other until nothing worked anymore. Right? Lost out of the forest for the trees.  
13:23  
Yeah, it's as if you weren't already a holistic system. If you weren't already designed for proper functioning i  
13:47  
But you think about it, you in the garden. You were created. We were created as a perpetual motion machine. Yep, internally we were to operate in that environment, in that knowledge and that understanding,  
Matthias Miller  14:11  
so maybe not to simplify or simplify, but I one way to frame this. I don't know if this right one, but one way to frame this is, I mean, we all talk about process goals versus outcome goals. My assumption has generally revolved around the fact that if I orchestrate my day to day life properly, then I'll get the outcomes that I want. So if I have work that's fulfilling, even if it's hard, I will show up and I'll do the work. And if I have a methodology for getting clean. Clients that fits me and that resonates with them, then there will be some level of flow and ease in in client acquisition, if, if it's almost this thing of I'm going to reorient my environment around me to Well, I mean, isn't it going back to the garden? I am here. The garden is here to serve me. I'm not here to serve the garden. And so I'm going to reorient my life well and except it's not about me, but I'm going to re orient my life. We've talked about the concept of home, but going to reorient, I'm going to reorient my life so that my life is home to me, so I can stop the pursuit of something out there and enjoy the thing that I have right here. I You're  
16:20  
talking about union.  
16:33  
So it's not like I'm going to serve the garden. The garden is going to serve me. It's this flow of I, I do what I do. It does what it does. And that's a creates a cycle of being. I don't try and control it. It doesn't try and control me. We act according to our nature.  
17:15  
I'm not trying to manipulate it to get what I want, and it's not trying to manipulate me to get what It wants. It's a symbiote.  
17:41  
I like the concept, yes,  
Matthias Miller  17:48  
which is really novel. There's there's a lot there, because  
18:01  
there's a lot there. So  
Matthias Miller  18:04  
if I'm going to riff for a second, then this is I have done this in signing up for some kind of program. Let's let me, let me pick the very first program I ever I took a program I ever said, That's work. It was very much, we need you to do something, and we're going to manipulate you to get what we need out of you for the program right, and then later in life, reversing the game and saying, Well, you need to be X, Y and Z for me, and even doing this with a team member implicitly, not directly, not perhaps over, no, not consciously, not consciously. Thank you. You need to be X for me, and he needed the same thing for me, and it wasn't symbiotic.  
19:10  
Yes,  
Matthias Miller  19:13  
the same thing with the business. So one of the reasons why people burn out of business is because business demands them to show up as something other than themselves and giving something they can't give. Yes,  
19:30  
it's not symbiotic. It's not symbiotic. It's parasitic. I  
19:47  
you come here, you do this for me, it solves this problem. For me, I'm happy. And here's some money for you. For. Solving this problem for me.  
Matthias Miller  20:06  
And the money is supposed to erase. It's, it's a, it's, it's this, it's a scale, so it's parasitic, but it gives you money, therefore it evens out. We're good, right, right. Right.  
20:22  
How does that work?  
Matthias Miller  20:25  
How does that work? But it's so much the so often the mentality, yeah, how much you have a bad claim? Well, just charge them enough that you'd be happy to do it anyway, like  
20:41  
at the end of the day, there's still a bad client. There's  
Matthias Miller  20:44  
still a bad client. Yeah, don't change.  
20:47  
I heard Jeff Bezos talk a number of years ago, and he talked about, he learned to live. He was using this biblical metaphor, but I think he was using it inappropriately. But he was like, I learned to live in the desert for so long that I just have become one within function there. But I think what he's talking about for him personally, is he learned to live in chaos, and so he just grew resistant to the chaos. But what he has done is become one with the chaos, because it's always a parasitic relationship. And what is Amazon, if not parasitic, it's not symbiotic. They preach symbiosis,  
21:45  
but it's parasitic.  
21:48  
By the very definition of the word, one is living off the resources of another and draining it  
22:02  
in order for it to be symbiotic, both have to receive benefit.  
Matthias Miller  22:13  
Well. And I see this, I see this, there's a large the more that I Okay, I mean, but this is another analogy for for the the valley, because when you when you've got somebody who's  
22:39  
been the host  
Matthias Miller  22:43  
and they want to disconnect from the parasite. Maybe that's not the right analogy, but, but the challenge is that when people disconnect from a parasitic relationship is a being able to recognize and identify symbiotic relationships and B, Being able to even find This symbiotic relationship that I  
23:38  
wow, wow,  
23:45  
would you even recognize a symbiotic relationship when all you've ever known is parasitic relationships? I  
24:06  
Yeah, because  
24:09  
that's, that's the whole  
24:10  
concept of the matrix, right? I  
24:30  
when you choose to take that red pill, immediately, your eyes are open the fact that this has all been parasitic in nature and  
Matthias Miller  24:49  
and the glass shattering event is some point at which I. Your symbiotic perception gets broken. Yes, and you have to record. You have to either deny that it's parasitic  
25:15  
yourself too. Yeah,  
25:17  
which means what to deny that it's parasitic? What do you have to convince yourself of?  
Matthias Miller  25:30  
Well, I mean, I don't know that there's any way to do it besides convincing yourself that you don't need what you actually need. Yes, right? Or you have to deal with the shattering of of the you ego in recognizing deal with your own I don't know you have a better term for this ignorance, lack of knowledge, lack of insight that this was actually parasitic, and then come to grips with it, and then deal with the fallout of leaving the comfort and safety of the familiarity of A parasitic relationship, right?  
26:40  
So you either become a victim, or you become what the victim is, the denial of the reality, or you become what do.  
Matthias Miller  27:14  
I uh, self, self responsible in a in a healthy way, and  
27:36  
you become a victim or a warrior or a warrior, which leads you down the path of becoming a sage, becoming wise.  
27:51  
This is ignorance.  
27:53  
This is parasitic. This is externalization. This is a warrior. This is a choosing reality. This is wisdom. Those are the options you have.  
28:19  
Red Pill, blue pill,  
28:22  
red pill, we'll see how deep this rabbit hole goes. Blue pill, we live in blissful ignorance,  
28:32  
or that's the promise. That's the promise  
28:36  
pain, painful, blissful ignorance. We're however that might work. Yeah.  
29:00  
So what we offer in this course is an exploration of what it means to take the red pill. I'm not going to give you answers because they wouldn't apply to your individual circumstances, right? But I'll walk with you as you explore what it would look like to live in symbiosis, not  
29:33  
in a parasitic existence. I  
29:53  
Well, this could be as simple as the red pill roundtable. I.  
Matthias Miller  30:34  
You know, symbiosis looks optional until You contrast it With parasitic do  
31:09  
Wow.  
31:19  
Those are my favorite moments of these conversations,  
Matthias Miller  31:29  
sifting all kinds of situations through this. You know you've got a good framework when you can take a variety of situations that lends clarity across a broad spectrum,  
31:47  
right?  
31:56  
When all of a sudden, these things start to affect a deeply human level, a deeply experiential  
32:18  
what, yeah, What it means to be a human being. Yeah, and not just an entrepreneur or  
32:33  
however you want to say,  
Matthias Miller  32:42  
somebody made a post about how AI was going to revel revolutionize. Post on LinkedIn about how AI is going to revolution. It revolutionize the education system. One of my friends, who's a cyber security sales engineer, posted on it with a lot of skepticism, and I just replied to his comment with two words, Lindy,  
33:12  
yeah.  
33:13  
After Google search, he came back and was like, well, that's depressing.  
Matthias Miller  33:22  
But but the but this goes into the most fundamental premise that, if you really want to understand, I mean, this is getting a bit philosophical, but where is it not to really understand to really navigate extreme high rates of rewind 10 years ago, or 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 5200 years ago, when direct advertising was just making its way, the rate of the pace of change had accelerated, but was still relatively stable, and you didn't actually have to understand you only had to understand a thin layer of the nuances of human motivation in order to live in that space. And I think a very good argument can be made that the more that the rate and pace of change accelerates that the deeper and more firm grasp of fundamentals you need to have, right? I mean, it's the it's the tree concept that where there's wherever you have high winds, you need deeper roots and a strong water source. Yes,  
34:48  
yes, yeah, I would say 50 to 100 years ago in that space, all you needed to know was the ego, because you could manipulate it. Yeah. It, but now you're having to get to more foundational core motivations,  
Matthias Miller  35:13  
and we're also starting to see the emergence  
35:17  
at some level  
Matthias Miller  35:21  
of identity in values based marketing,  
35:28  
and that's the battleground. That's the battleground.  
35:36  
So again, goes back to the core of identity. The battleground is going to be identity.  
35:56  
What's your identity?  
36:02  
Who? Are you? Why do you do what you do?  
36:08  
That's the question the beginning right, tell me. Tell me your name and tell me who you are. I  
36:34  
and I guarantee you what will happen is you'll start to see Like from the very beginning, people fighting for position. I  
Matthias Miller  37:04  
Okay, so contract, so typical. Let's go into a typical opening. Somebody says something along the lines of, who are you? I'm Fred, and I'm the, you know, the CEO of such and such a company, and person two finds a way to spin it so that I'm Bob and I am a Three time, you know, founder, I don't know what? Yeah,  
37:44  
everybody posturing with their resume,  
Matthias Miller  37:50  
and if you don't lead With position, then  
38:00  
what do you lead with? Right? I  
Matthias Miller  38:32  
because the fundamental question that we're trying to answer is, why me? Do I belong? Am I in the right room? Why should people listen to me?  
38:56  
As long as you operate in that system,  
39:01  
that parasitic system that is all you have, is comparison and competition. It's all you have. Yeah, yeah.  
39:33  
Yeah, the problem is is we were designed for symbiosis. We were not designed  
39:41  
parasitic. You.  
Matthias Miller  40:23  
So I worked with a colleague on fleshing out. Okay? So I went through this kind of thing of, if I had to reverse engineer my top three raw talents that I've developed, and then had to build that into a framework, and had to then articulate it and articulate my story, or that Be one of the interesting things was that I've deny denied how fiercely competitive that I am,  
41:09  
and  
Matthias Miller  41:14  
unwittingly and unknowingly with, unconsciously with clients and partners, got into a competitive space.  
41:29  
We could have just stumbled on it, unwittingly, unknowingly stumbled into this space. I  
41:44  
well,  
Matthias Miller  41:49  
I mean that somehow those words ring a little bit hollow. But I'm really good at so, I mean, we're all good at self deception. I'm really good at self deception, denial, human being. And I also think that there were some, I mean, for myself, personally, there's values against or family and cultural values against being competitive and wanting to win. But in retrospect, I mean another word for the parasitic relationship is scarcity, in another word for symbiosis is abundance. Because the fundamental issue was, my needs aren't getting met and you're not You can't help me get them met. Therefore the only way for me to do it is to become and you're so you're being parasitic. The only way for me to get my needs met is by being parasitic as well. And then we both enter into the same game. So the foundation of competition is lack, right? There's no way for both of us to win a book going to make needs met, right? Or, if you really, if you this is probably going to, probably would upset some economists. But if you, if you actually believe that each  
43:24  
company  
Matthias Miller  43:27  
has its own unique fingerprint, then it would make sense that there are better ways to build a business, and that that fingerprint is formed by its founders, leaders, the people within it, then cloning a competitor and trying to become better. By definition, means that you're going to shoe shoehorn yourself into a situation that you're not created for and and it's going to demand things of you that you're not willing, that will leave unmet needs for yourself, and You will win. You will win financially,  
44:17  
but starve yourself. Right?  
Matthias Miller  44:36  
It's also interesting that the garden was a I don't know what biblical scholars would say, but was a confined area with the implicit concept that the garden was meant to expand mm.  
45:00  
Uh, through dominion. And  
Matthias Miller  45:04  
I think there's an equivalent in which, which we've seen in parts and pieces, but with with distortion  
45:13  
that I  
Matthias Miller  45:17  
mean, let's take AI as an example. Everybody, many people are up in arms about what AI is going to take away.  
45:26  
And  
Matthias Miller  45:29  
the truth is that the organism is evolving, and there are some things that you could get from the organism that you can no longer get, but there's a whole host of things that you can now get that you were never going to be able to get before. So there's actually much a much higher level of abundance than there was before, but it does mean that there's a segment that will need to reorient themselves if they want to. It's not static.  
46:10  
No, it's dynamic.  
Matthias Miller  46:12  
It's dynamic, and our drive for safety and familiarity will keep us latched on to something that's static when it's still under providing what it once did.  
46:24  
What is it promise? What's the resource, the abundant resource it promises? When you go down to the core level, what issue is it going to solve? I I  
46:59  
mean, does it depend on who you're asking?  
47:03  
I think  
Matthias Miller  47:05  
one of the core promises is that, I mean, I think that, well, okay, let's, let's go through promises and then get to the core promise. You know, one promise is that, for the first time, technology has the capacity to relate with humans on a on a on a human first basis, not a technology first basis. So we get to use natural language to communicate. It and the computer now, which is really interesting in terms of symbiosis is that the computer now actually gets to meet us on some of our terms, and it can, it can, I mean the other, other types of promises that are further fetched and less I don't know what are things like super intelligence. So if you have a large language model that listens to all of your conversations and watches all the work you do on your computer, then you can  
48:21  
have full recall of your life,  
Matthias Miller  48:30  
if you there's promises of efficiency, efficiency gains, which has never worked. All efficiency gains have just resulted in us working harder. I Well, the  
48:43  
promise, the gift that is promised, is time. Yeah, and what's the motivation? Why do we need more time? I mean,  
Matthias Miller  49:00  
isn't it fundamentally because we're not happy with how we're spending the time that we have exactly  
49:06  
so now I have more time to waste.  
Matthias Miller  49:12  
Richard Kosh has has a great quote that goes along the lines of, the problem is not that time is scarce. Problem is that time is that time is abundant and we are awash in time. Yes, as the billionaire who works one or two hours a day, right, right?  
49:40  
It's a fundamental part of the Blue Hill of the parasitic environment, because it's based on competition. And if I just had an edge, if I just had more time, I could out compete you. I. Right?  
Matthias Miller  50:20  
It's also interesting, because I'll see if I can get my thoughts out here. One of the most, I think, one of the profound things I've been seeing in these sessions I've been doing with people is how many times they have resources at their disposal. And simply can't. Okay, well, first of all, problem number one is getting in touch at some level with what it is they actually want. Second of all, recognizing that they have some resources at their disposal currently that they dismiss because it's not the full answer, or because they don't see how it fits in, or because fill in the blank, but, but that, at a minimum, they always have one, but probably more resources. Sometimes it is just one, one resource that will lead them one step closer to what it is that they want and they're paralyzed. Yes, competition fundamentally shifts your focus from what you have to what you don't have, and it moves you out of a space of resourcefulness into a space of lack. And so I don't, I don't have what I need. Because, I mean, this is what this other person has, and this is what I need, and therefore I don't, I don't utilize the resources that I already have. Kind of the reticular activating system, kind of,  
51:55  
you see what you look for, kind of thing? Yeah, right.  
52:06  
But you behold, you become.  
Matthias Miller  52:10  
What you behold you become, which is one of the paradoxes of why I've got a friend of mine who's a marketer, very smart guy, very smart, hardworking, I think he's smart, but everything that he does is based on Funnel Hacking and reversing things that already work.  
52:39  
And I  
Matthias Miller  52:42  
think one of the things that people have a really I've had, I'm not alone, have had a really hard time wrapping my head around, is the fact that you can focus and pay attention that, that you can successfully ignore The competition  
53:12  
and not get caught, not be blindsided. You.  
53:26  
That phrase, successfully ignore the competition is like a neon sign to me, like flashing how do you successfully ignore the competition.  
Matthias Miller  53:43  
The only one, I mean, the only way, is to focus on what it is that you really want, and to obsess over that, right? And to go build it and and and actualize it in some way. Yeah, I and most people have also been trained. Have been trained not think for themselves, not to listen to themselves and to externalize their wants, of desires. So their very first question becomes, this is turning things upside down. Their very first question becomes, what does the market want, right? And how do I become that to the market?  
54:39  
Right? How do I become something that I'm not?  
54:48  
That's the ego.  
54:50  
It's all ego driven. What do people want and how do I become that i.  
55:26  
I have this this friend lives in the Houston area, and she's had a photography business for a number of years, and she got tired doing portraits and wedding and that kind of stuff, and she really felt led to address the issue of people's perception of themselves. So she started marketing this. I want to, I want to photograph you as you are, not this created thing, but as you are and beautiful. I totally supported her in it, but how she was marketing it was, I need you to like me, essentially. And I brought up, you're telling these people you want them to be as they are, but you're not being as you are, yeah. And so within the last two weeks, she started just being as she is within her social media presence and all that kind of stuff. And all of a sudden people start coming in because she's being who she is,  
56:37  
yeah, it's i is  
56:46  
that's great. I  
57:17  
so what if this is all about  
57:22  
symbiosis. And symbiosis, in order thing for things to be symbiotic, you have to act according to your nature,  
57:31  
right? If you're not  
57:32  
acting according to your nature, you're going to be parasitic. So we have to figure out your identity, what your nature is so that you can act within it,  
57:48  
which is that death we were talking about yesterday, like you've spent decades in this ego driven manifestation of who you are, And that has to die in order for you to understand who you are. Truly,  
58:06  
Yeah, yeah.  
58:40  
We have to do, and that's why it's a hard sell. By symbiosis is a hard sell because it requires you to be who you are, and you've never lived in a world that encourages you to be who you are.  
59:02  
Yeah, that's the hard sell.  
Matthias Miller  59:18  
On one hand, it's a hard sell, but on the other hand, everybody craves it. Yes,  
59:24  
deep down inside, everybody is longing for the true identity.  
59:33  
Who am I actually?  
59:47  
And you will have those that will approach that line, see the line, and go, nope, that's too scary. Yeah. And we have examples of the Pharaoh he was brought to the line.  
1:00:11  
They said, Nope, that's scary.  
1:00:15  
That would mean losing all of this that I have. I  
1:00:24  
Saul, same thing.  
Matthias Miller  1:00:35  
I mean Ananias and Sapphira in their way, the rich young ruler, Judas. Judas. Mean, it's a fundamental narrative,  
1:00:57  
foundational i Hmm,  
1:01:05  
that's that point we talked about. We came to yesterday where it's like, this is where most people quit, right? Yes,  
1:01:11  
yeah, this is where most people quit.  
Matthias Miller  1:01:15  
And the the temptation is, I mean, okay, but there's these lies that perpetuate, these voices that perpetuate, and it's all centered around orphan this isn't a word but orphanhood. So there's no place for me in the world. I don't belong, and I can't there's no place for me in the if I show up as to be in the world, it won't work. I have a friend of mine who, on our recent peer call, office hours call, it was talking about some of this stuff, and one of the things that he mentioned is that when, when, what you do is some form of performing art. He He is a mentor to students wanting to get into their their first choice College,  
1:02:17  
and  
Matthias Miller  1:02:20  
you have to build your life around brazen acts of stepping off the ledge so that you can truly be yourself. Yep, and different people have different forms of that, but you have to be able to,  
1:02:59  
yeah, I don't know we've got more to add to that. I it  
1:03:03  
resonates deeply with me, and I don't understand why, but some people don't get a choice, like for me, I never really got the choice.  
1:03:22  
Chicago, consciously.  
1:03:24  
Maybe there's some subconscious motivations that led me to certain situations, but I was consistently confronted with brave like choices of do this or this, and the only option was to do this. Okay? Gotta step off this cliff. I gotta step off this cliff. It was over and over and over again. I mean, that's why my mind works the way it does. Cuz you're talking about stepping off the first cliff. Oh, isn't that cute. This is my 10,000th Cliff I've stepped off of.  
1:04:09  
It's just no there's no other way. There's no other way. Yeah, I remember. Listening to, I think it was Parker Palmer, one of his books, and he talks about this. He went on this, like Outward Bound kind of thing. And they were doing rappelling down a rock face at a certain point, and he's rappelling down, and he looks down, there's a big crevasse, like on the side of the mountain right below him. And he yells up. He's like, there's a big crevasse below me. And the the guy who's repelling him goes, Okay, can you go around it? Then he goes, No. No, can't go around it. Okay? Well, you have two options. You can go through it, or you can come back up. Which one do you want? And it resonates so deeply with because I found myself at that position in my life a number of times and going up just didn't seem like an option,  
1:05:25  
right? So  
1:05:28  
I was like, Okay, I guess I got to go through it. Yeah. I  
1:05:45  
so I believe God specifically, like, put me in positions where I could not go around it, yeah, and so I had to go  
1:05:55  
through it, yeah? Well, I  
Matthias Miller  1:06:02  
think in my life, my life, I mean, I tried to find ways around it. I think part of the maturing process  
1:06:12  
is being quicker to admit that the path is through. Yeah, it's either up or through, yep. Well, it's a very  
1:06:30  
it resonates deeply with me, and you probably recognize this when, when we're children, especially really young, when we get scared, we look to somebody, our parent, or whatever, who is ever is there and they want up, take me out of this. And it really doesn't get too much more sophisticated as we get older, the situation heads like up.  
Matthias Miller  1:07:03  
Yeah, same kind of non verbal or Yeah, the same kind of kicking and screaming and biting and hitting the whatever it takes to get us out. Yeah?  
1:07:36  
And that's the, I think that's the glass shattering moment this happened, and I want a way out? Yeah, I don't want to feel this pain. I want to experience that. I want a way out and in God's love, grace and mercy. He says, Nope, we're going to stay here. Yeah,  
1:08:07  
and if there's and that's a decision point, I can give Okay, I'm going to stay here with you. But if there's no socially acceptable way to get out of this, I'm going to use socially unacceptable ways to get out of it. So now I'm numb myself from this experience. And there's 1,000,001 ways you can do that, but that's what addiction is, that glass shattering moment. I want out of this. God's not going to take you out of it, so I gotta numb it Somehow. I  
1:09:07  
i That's the entirety of the Round Table. What does this look like? And. We as a group are committing to walk through that process  
1:10:11  
that is something that will change the world.  
Matthias Miller  1:10:22  
So you're good with the red pill roundtable.  
1:10:25  
I love it.  
1:10:28  
I love it.  
1:10:31  
I could not be more excited about that.  
Matthias Miller  1:10:39  
All right. Well, I will. We've been having hassles getting the and you confirmed. I'll see you can get that squared away today, and soon as we got that, then I can shoot you the link, and people can start signing up. You can pass it out. And,  
1:10:56  
yeah, good stuff.  
Matthias Miller  1:11:00  
I know we have more time blacked out, but my brain, my brain's full. Me too. Me too.  
1:11:07  
I think it's appropriate. Yeah, take a nap Exactly, exactly  
Matthias Miller  1:11:18  
Monday. It's Monday at six again, yeah, works for me. All right. Sounds good. Talk Good, alright, buddy. I'll see you. Then. Sounds good. Bye.

SUMMARY KEYWORDS

00:33  
Good morning. Morning. How are you?  
00:40  
Yeah, well,  
00:43  
under the weather, but,  
00:48  
yeah, I'm here.  
00:49  
You're here. Well, it matters,  
00:53  
matters  
00:55  
to catch a cold.  
00:57  
Yeah, it's something like that. It's that, or like form of covid, or,  
01:04  
yeah,  
01:06  
I don't know exactly what anymore. I caught  
01:09  
the same thing over the weekend, probably, plane flight seminars, that kind of thing. I came home with something that I can't describe.  
01:19  
Yeah, I  
01:35  
What adventure Do we go on today?  
01:40  
Well, we had discussed potential languaging, yeah, roundtable,  
01:46  
yep.  
01:51  
I do have an auxiliary question, sorry, which is so at some point, you know, there's the, everybody looks at achievement. Most people look at many people look at achievement for what they can get out of it. And then they achieve something. And then there's kind of this, oh, so that's it. That's all it was, right. Now, I human  
02:30  
and I  
02:44  
Okay, so do you believe in individual purpose? And what is the general process by which, obviously there's a point of crisis where somebody says, I can't do things. I don't want to continue doing things the way that they have been, or they have some kind of near death experience that kind of wakes them up. Yeah, but what is the process by which people actually uncover that? And one of the reasons for it, and and  
03:25  
can it be uncovered earlier than its time? I was talking to one of my mentors, and she mentioned that she didn't really draw the connections between everywhere that she had been until she was 60 years old. Anyway, we don't have to go down, yeah, if you don't want to. But  
03:51  
no, no, Tony, I think it's there's a lot of fruit on that trail. I wonder why. I wonder why it took her that long  
04:02  
to recognize it.  
04:06  
That's the first thought that pops into my head. So I've worked with clients that have the second life journey because that I would see it as first half of life is building something, manifesting your ego, creating your kingdom, that kind of thing. And at some point, you build this tower, and you walk to the top, and you take a look around, you're like, Oh, this isn't what I thought it would be. And you can either choose to continue building higher, and some people do, or you can choose to come down from the tower and be amongst the people, which is very humbling experience and yet more more connecting, more knowing and being done, more love there, I wouldn't say so, I guess I would wonder why it took the time that it did. I. Well, I would say objectively, it took what time it needed to take. And there's factors that contribute to that, and I think it's our willingness to be aware of our experience of the world, right? So is there a timeline? I don't believe so. I don't believe that God has said, at 60, you will be enlightened, right? I think the opportunity for enlightenment is always there. Enlightenment in the sense of Paul having the scales removed from his eyes. All eats there. Now do we have the humility to allow the scales to be removed from our eyes?  
06:00  
I would certainly say now, at 49 I'm seeing the world so vastly differently than I did even a year ago,  
06:13  
even a year ago.  
06:15  
That's not to say I have some level of enlightenment, because I certainly don't. I'm just saying I see the world differently, and it feels really good to see the world differently than I always have.  
06:34  
How does it look different to you?  
06:37  
Yeah, it's a great question. I there's a felt sense of union that's growing and growing and growing. I was raised in a system that made me very suspicious of anybody who wasn't my family, and so there was a inherent us versus them mindset. I always say this, if you agreed with my family, you were right. If you disagreed with my family, you were an idiot. And so like that was us versus them mindset, which i i saw looking backwards. I saw probably it became really clear 10 to 15 years ago, that's what was happening. But to work all of that out of my system is a continuing process, and I'm just feeling it intensely in this season of No, that's not the way life works. And you have opinions that you can share with me and experiences that can help me, and vice versa. And so it's an increasing level of knowing and being known of union that I'm really recognizing,  
08:10  
but it's almost like a Dale Carnegie win friends and influence people on a superpower level, except you're not doing it with me, and you can approach that book, I'm sure, with the with your own agenda, with The intent to serve, but when you realize that you  
08:41  
don't like  
08:57  
the language when an influence seems really coercive to me. I've read the book, and I know what he's talking about, all that kind of stuff. What I feel like is just me being me, who I was designed to be in this world will attract friends,  
09:16  
community, yes, union,  
09:19  
like I was. I was at this workshop over the weekend, a lot of inner child work, and I was assisting within it, and they do this exercise called A to B. So there's two concentric circles, one circle on the outside with people in it, one circle on inside with people in it, and you stand across from the person, and you hold their hands, and for 30 seconds to a minute, you just look into their eyes, and then you rotate, you know, to the right. You know what, whatever the case may be, every person that I was face to face with, and there was probably five or six in the exercise, mm. At some point in the interaction, started crying. No words were said. It was just a deep knowing that was happening across that was fascinated. I was because I didn't feel drawn. I didn't I didn't feel like I was tearing up or anything like that. So I was like, what God should do that passed a few of them, like, I don't know. I just knew something, and it was deeply impactful. That's what I'm talking about.  
10:41  
Wow. So do You need language for your purpose? Do you need to be able to express what it is?  
11:49  
I think you need to communicate it. And sometimes that looks like spoken language. Sometimes that looks like metaphor imagery. Sometimes looks like dreams, but some of these things are ineffable.  
12:10  
There is no language around them.  
12:21  
And you know that you found it or a version or iteration or an iterative understanding of it, when you're at in a place of being completely yourself without self protection, in union with people, with the people around you.  
12:58  
So maybe one of those profound developments in a human experience is being comfortable in your own skin. I'm not looking around at this think. What does this person think? What does this person think? I'm just me in that space and I'm comfortable being just me in that space. Maybe that's the most profound experience we can have as human beings. Maybe that's what Jesus was talking about when he said, Love God, Love your neighbor as yourself. You  
13:45  
I know, and I'm known by God, I know, and I'm known by myself, I know, and I'm known by others. I  
14:09  
That's where this struck me. Yesterday, I was driving I was thinking about you were telling me about, you know that when the guys who you talked with, who goes to, you know, seminar said he'll give people prophetic words, but he sit there and wait for him to give people prophetic words, and then, you know, do like some sort of session with them, and that kind of thing, like that whole process. What struck me in that moment, or as I was driving, was there really isn't a knowing of being known there. So it can't be unifying. It can't be connecting. That means somebody's benefiting from the other. If the other isn't benefiting, i. An imbalance, I guess.  
15:02  
But there's perceived benefit, Kevin,  
15:10  
but if you build your life in the assumption, going back to what we said earlier, that transformation happens in relationship, then you are giving them a pill in your creating a form of dependency, because there isn't so to your point, no, there's not, but they are wanting, like to die. I  
15:46  
so there are, well, what is there?  
16:02  
I Hmm, like the entire pharmaceutical industry, let's take antidepressants for a second. The message is, you feel horrible. This will make you feel better. Great. And maybe it does for a time, but what we're dealing with there is a lot is a dependency issue. Do I have to depend on this thing to make me feel better?  
17:00  
Interminably? Let me look at the general charismatic encounter, prophetic culture.  
17:14  
I my sister in law is a chiropractor, so I love giving her shit about this, the whole parapet industry is simply just a dependency model. You need to go back in and get adjusted over and over and over again, when, in reality, if you just strengthen the muscle groups around the skeleton, that wouldn't go out of place, maybe every once in a while, pop back in. Okay, we're good, but it just creates dependency. Therapy can be the exact same way. It just creates dependency. And we'll tell you, we want to get you to freedom, and we want you to be a self, functioning human being, and  
17:57  
that's the goal.  
17:59  
But  
18:02  
what's happening there.  
18:06  
How many chiropractors does it take to change a light bulb?  
18:10  
I don't know,  
18:12  
only one which had to go back couple more times true. How many Amish does it take to change a light bulb?  
18:24  
How many Amish?  
18:26  
Yeah,  
18:28  
the entire town, I'm assuming. Well,  
18:29  
I mean, what's a light  
18:39  
bulb? What's my fault? So good.  
18:50  
Now that makes, I mean, it makes sense, but there's a  
18:58  
wow. I I  
19:06  
think about this, this has been kind of a revelatory experience to me. Recently, I've had this feeling pit in my stomach, solar plexus, I went and off again in my life, for as long as I can remember, always present. Did all medical testing. There's nothing physically wrong. All those that you know the story,  
19:35  
but you know when it disappears, it's not even present. The same conversations like this, we go deep and we explore and we're curious and  
19:53  
it goes it's not even present. It's a. A part of me so long for union with human beings that that is satisfied  
20:13  
in those moments.  
20:22  
Meanwhile, psychology takes this and calls it a personality trait like introversion and extroversion of dualities, Right? Oh,  
22:39  
that's what we're trying to do here,  
22:43  
but this roundtable  
22:46  
is provide a space where these curious conversations can take place. It eases that aching in the soul of people who have been so long, isolated Yeah,  
23:07  
I haven't been invited into a conversation. They've been invited into a sense. You agree with me, we can have This conversation, right? Not into  
23:26  
an exploration. I  
23:44  
dangerous. You may not get it right. Yeah, that's the point of an exploration. It's a point of curiosity, getting it wrong, learning, growing, wisdom, strength, going forward the point i  
24:26  
i recently made a post with I've been increasingly less active on Facebook, which is every time I go on, I'm like, Oh, this is why I'm not here.  
24:48  
Around  
24:50  
I'm realizing a lot of the people I mean, this is this. My engineering brain is like, no duh. Like, of course. Um, but the people that I connect with the most are people who are just philosophical, ask questions, curious, intellectually curious. Her conversation with a colleague of or a conversation with somebody a few years ago who does marketing for one of the for a big name,  
25:21  
kind of,  
25:26  
I guess, influencer. And he said he thought it was in one of his top five favorite conversations, because of, he's really met anybody who's as intellectually curious as I am, which I don't really consider myself to be that. But, you know, probably my natural instinct is, who are you hanging out with? But  
25:54  
I don't know,  
25:56  
you wouldn't consider yourself intellectually curious. It's  
26:02  
not a label I put on myself. I  
26:08  
probably can say one of the most intellectually curious people I've ever met, really, yeah, at least in our conversations here, I  
26:26  
You're not afraid. Have an idea. Put it out there. Tear it apart. Look at all the component pieces. Put it back again. They'll move forward like that's my experience with you the entire  
26:44  
I don't would  
26:48  
have a hard time thinking that you're wrong.  
26:54  
To me, you're the symbolic representation of what does this button do? I  
27:12  
but there's a very specific sphere that it gets applied to. And I think it's, well, I mean, it's, I don't know exactly what that sphere is.  
27:28  
It's not connected to gears and rotors and superconductors, semiconductors.  
27:38  
What are the system it's connected to for the lens through which it's explored is just your experience.  
27:51  
It's fascinating.  
27:56  
Well, and I think if you wanted to, it's true, sometimes I feel a little weird, selfish, maybe because I called up. So I called up, called up this lady last on Friday, and she was telling me different stuff. And, you know, she's highly extroverted, so she's, she can spend the whole conversation talking and and  
28:29  
so I jump in with these two, you know, two questions which are very selfish questions, because I wanted to understand my experience that the questions around, you know, when did you recognize what your what it was purpose is,  
28:42  
however, I asked it.  
28:55  
And when I don't have that as a point of reference for conversation, I get easily lost. I best. So you want to talk to me about, I don't know, like, is this bad? Is there something wrong with me? Is there, you know, like, I don't really care  
29:21  
about the new whiz bang widget that you're putting together. But I do care about connecting people. I do care about, I'm a collector of people, in some sense. And I do care about  
29:47  
in conversations with people, they don't bring this frame to our conversation, but in conversations with many people and listening to the subtext of the conversation, I.  
30:05  
And sometimes there's just this dynamic flow where you're creative and I'm creative, and so there's this synergy that happens.  
30:19  
Those are the best kinds of conversations. That's where, that's almost where, like I was telling you about that experience at the workshop, that happens in a conversation as well. There's just a synergy that feeds off itself. And who knows where this is going to go. We're gonna have a great time getting there. Yep, you  
31:20  
I could become so wrapped up and  
31:51  
figuring out our purpose that figuring out our purpose becomes our purpose and  
32:06  
right,  
32:07  
rather than just experiencing life around me,  
32:18  
this bottom line, our purpose fundamentally is to know and we have fundamental purposes love. Anything beyond that is his job.  
32:37  
My purpose is to love. I need to do that well.  
32:57  
Everything else take care of itself.  
34:05  
What does left bring right bring integration, for lack of a better term, the the spiritual and the tactical.  
34:18  
What? What does it look like, yeah.  
34:23  
So  
34:25  
purpose is to know and be known.  
34:32  
So  
34:36  
you can do that as a waiter or waitress. You do that as a software engineer. You do this as a musician. You.  
35:16  
It looks like struggle, like  
35:22  
the integration. Of the two looks like struggle,  
35:30  
because each one wants to create a reality in which we're safe, but it approaches it from different vantage points,  
35:39  
so they're at odds,  
35:43  
and some feel more comfortable in one space or the other, depending on who you are, and to go hard into one or the other. But you do that long enough, and you start to feel like something's missing,  
36:05  
something lacking. So it leads us to the other so for me, left brain, analytical data, intellectualization, it's my calling card  
36:23  
for the longest time,  
36:25  
and I went about as far down that path as you can go.  
36:34  
At some point everything collapsed, all my intellectual frameworks, everything that was going to keep me safe just utterly collapsed.  
36:51  
That's when they had to learn how to feel.  
36:55  
I didn't gage the right brain. I  
37:04  
That's hard.  
37:16  
Like you're out on a you're on a lamb, you're out on a branch.  
37:22  
The and  
37:27  
you've walked out on that branch because it benefited you to walk out on that branch. And if you have a lot of positive reinforcement from walking out on that branch, then all sudden somebody says, or you start to hear cracks in the branch. What do you do at that point? Right?  
37:58  
So did you have a period of time where you  
38:04  
did the opposite,  
38:09  
and you went all the way down the right brain branch.  
38:13  
Oh, yeah.  
38:15  
What was that? What was that like? Painful  
38:22  
is, essentially what, what I felt like, I had to do was feel again,  
38:31  
and so I had to learn how to feel. And in learning how to feel, it was very uncomfortable. I and it felt like everything was wrong and I shouldn't be doing this. And why am I doing this? And I can't, and  
38:51  
it just was, oh,  
39:04  
painful.  
39:11  
Did you reach a point where you hyper extended  
39:15  
beyond  
39:17  
where? How did you find your path back to start integrating left brain again?  
39:29  
Yeah, so hyperextension this way, I'm all in my feelings, right? And then I recognize that that's an imbalance as well, and I think I'm more acutely aware of it because I've had the imbalance on this side, and I know what this feels like, and it's the same feeling on this side. And so you have to swing back. Right? Well, it sounds fair to say you have to swing back. It's almost like life pushes you, or the spirit pushes you, or relation. Just push you back into the middle. Now we're a little extreme. Let's come back over here and at the end of like, like, throughout the whole process, it's one massive process of letting go of what you know, i  
40:27  
Isn't there a so this is processing from some of the other parts work I've been exploring with but I mean, isn't the concept of the concept of union is fractal. So there's also the question of, what does it look like within ourselves for left brain and right brain to individually know and be known, along with multi you know that the word that my the kind of fail on the kind of failed on the explanation and part of the explanation, but, but the word that my facilitator used to describe some of this stuff was the idea of A on the talent side, there's the idea of a super group where you have exceptional band members, you know, band members who are successful in their own rights, who come together to perform a super group, right and and so you have that kind of thing on the left brain, right brain. But then you also have that those things in terms of kind of your own set of unique abilities, where each of them wants to take center stage, but must pursue knowing and being known with your other unique abilities and live in Union, in communion, right?  
42:10  
It's interesting like you bring up the idea of a super group. How old are the people in a super group? Typically,  
42:19  
I mean, I would guess 50s and above, but I don't know, right?  
42:27  
Because think about, if you, if you look at it as, like the parts of us as individual musicians, there's one part that's really, really strong and really developed and really good, and there's another part that isn't. So maybe that swing to for me, the swing to the right brain, was intense practice sessions on that part of me, which was developing my ability and humbling me in that area, and all these parts are being developed and humbled and becoming wise so that you can become this group that actually performs together, that is an ego driven  
43:09  
and where this really breaks down is your left brain threw up its hands and said, I can't do this anymore. And your choice was, am I going to listen or not? Yes. And plenty of people have said, Screw it. No, you're going to, you have to Yeah, and I don't care what it costs. And it says, Well, sure, but I'll rob from the body to make it happen, or whatever. Yep. So there's this, the self awareness piece is not just that's really interesting, and that's also where the need to control our life experience.  
43:58  
I mean, it's a  
44:01  
trust that there's intelligence within our experience, and that controlling our experience, that the natural flow is the most direct path. Yeah, to develop what needs to be developed, to be who we need to become. To, to, you know, it's really interesting. I like that analogy.  
44:27  
Yeah, well, another thing just occurred to me, like there's this trope or this metaphor, literary device within all mythologies, there's the sage. Where does the sage live?  
44:49  
Whether it's Obi Wan Kenobi or it's the Buddhist monk or like, where do they live, up  
44:55  
in the mountains, away from the.  
45:00  
People alone? Why?  
45:11  
Presumably, to avoid being influenced by the lessers of the world. But I don't know why  
45:20  
voices, there's too much noise. Yeah, I can't come into contact with what I think and feel, because the noise is too great. Some of the greatest theology, and I wouldn't even call it theology, I would call it mysticism, comes from the Desert Fathers who just had so could not live in the midst of Rome. In everything that Rome was, it was an assault on the sense of smell, sounds, touch, taste, everything, everything. They went out into the desert, and they, they create, they they experience this union with God, and then They told the story of what that looks like. And  
46:23  
how is that different from isolation?  
46:28  
Isolation you're running from, something you're seeking, something I  
46:45  
Moses was in isolation when he ran away from Egypt, and somewhere along that 40 year journey of herding sheep in the desert, came to a place of solitude and the penultimate circumstance of that solitude was the burning bush. He developed that solitude he was seeking something so intensely that a bush exploded in flame in front of him, and take his shoes off. I  
47:23  
So isn't this is another interesting take on Matthew 633  
47:33  
paraphrase, stop running and start seeking. Stop isolating, find solitude.  
47:43  
Yes,  
47:46  
and there's also, I mean, the whole, you know, flagellation view of, you know, monasticism and all that, is a running from guilt, from humanity, from insufficiency, from  
48:13  
and It's also trying a seeking to attain without no knowing  
48:23  
and being known,  
48:28  
the elevator to the top of the Empire State Building, rather than the stairs  
48:41  
you didn't get to the top in under two minutes. What do you do when you're up there?  
48:54  
My wife shared the experience of hiking Pikes Peak, and they ended up choosing the longest, most difficult route, and they get to the top, and here come all the people off the little tram and go, how amazing we made it to the top. Like, yeah, no, you didn't. I mean, yeah, that  
49:13  
was, well, that was a preordained conclusion. You were going to make it to the top, right, the one that takes the hardest path. There's no guarantee you're making it to the top. Yeah,  
49:38  
which ties back to it's analogous for some of the things we've been saying earlier, which is everybody thinks, everybody, everybody believes that what they want is the top of the Empire State Building or the top of Pikes Peak, but what they really want is the fulfillment of having gone, having having taken the journey. Yeah.  
50:00  
Having suffered for it, having suffered for it, that's what we really want,  
50:10  
and yet we spend most of our lives running from  
50:12  
suffering, right,  
50:16  
trying to be comfortable and then blame others when we're not if you would have just done this, this or this, I would be comfortable, mom or dad, church, school, friends, spouse, government doesn't matter. You would have just done this or this, I would, I would be comfortable. I would be happy. Yeah, yeah, no, doesn't work that way.  
50:48  
Yeah, not so much.  
50:51  
God, if you would have just given me these things, I would have been, yeah, that's how that works.  
51:01  
Well, I can't, I win the lottery? That's  
51:09  
analogous to saying, like, why can't I just get cancer?  
51:15  
Well, fair enough, please give me  
51:18  
cancer. I  
51:26  
Wow, crazy.  
51:27  
You're such curious creatures. Yeah, such curious creatures. I  
51:46  
I used to ask the question. I don't ask it anymore, but I used to when I first started, in the first session, I would ask the question, how badly do you want this? Whatever their goal was, the healing to you know what answer I got, inevitably, but really bad.  
52:10  
Everybody says that. Everybody says  
52:12  
that. And then the next question was, what are you willing to sacrifice to get that  
52:19  
anything? Anything  
52:23  
strangely enough that didn't always play out. There's certain things that we won't sacrifice, and it comes down to identity pieces that we believe we have to have. I  
52:43  
That's it. Yes, I can see that,  
52:49  
and you can almost set your watch by it. It will happen within three months of stepping into a space like this, where an identity piece will pop up in the realization of, oh, I said I wanted really badly, and I was willing to sacrifice whatever it took to get there, but I don't know if I want to sacrifice this thing.  
53:22  
Hmm? Mean, that's why I appreciate so much. You need to be liked by me. That way, when I laugh and make fun of you, I can control you.  
53:32  
I mean, it's just the relationship we have. I love it.  
53:43  
I was talking to a a lady yesterday worked at a company, mortgage industry, that kind of thing, for four years, and her boss has told her for four years, oh, we just need to get this system in place, and then you're off and running and you're going to make more money than you ever could possibly imagine. Four years over and over again, she's in another cycle of and being underpaid and all that kind of stuff. And I go, how many times has that promise been made to you over the four years? She's like, I can't even count. How many times? Okay, this number may be easier to count. How many times has it actually been fulfilled? Zero. There's an identity piece there that she can't that go up, and that's the thing she has to sacrifice in order to move forward.  
54:35  
So what's for sake of example, I  
54:45  
I don't want to be the one to disagree with the expert, and I don't want to be the one to fail, which is the same kind of thing that. Keeps voters voting for their political party, that keeps multi level marketers selling for their company,  
55:09  
keeps church members in the pew, in  
55:13  
the pew. Yeah, and don't you dare speak up and say that the promises that you're making aren't being fulfilled, because that's a threat to the institution. Yeah, and if it's not being fulfilled, it's certainly not my fault it wasn't fulfilled. Well, of course, yeah, it  
55:30  
has to be the opposition, whoever the opposition may be. Oh, I  
55:35  
mean, this is a classic business kitchen thing. You know, one of my actually, actually one of my friends knows the knows the founder flew on jets with her, and stuff like that, which was a very fascinated coming around full circle. She,  
55:58  
wow,  
55:59  
I had a crazy dream about her, but anyway, I forgot about that. I could ask my LLM, because I put some of this stuff in my LLM, and I can ask you questions. The that's bunny trail, but yes, it's always about, Well, did you put in the work? Did you do what we told you to do? And inevitably, somebody will not do something that they were told to do, which then obviously, well, you didn't really  
56:30  
give it your best. That's the lunch bin. That thing was so vastly important. You didn't wear green socks to the meeting on Tuesday. I told you to wear green socks the meeting on Tuesday. That's why this didn't happen. Were you part  
56:45  
of the I don't know what era it was, mostly reading about it the like the 80s era, red tide of wind deals thing exactly.  
56:52  
Yes, yeah, exactly. That's why it didn't work. Clearly, really the fate of humanity rest on my green socks, and I see this in the charismatic movement all the time. Oh, did you pray this prayer? Yeah. Did you pray it this way? Yeah. Were you standing up? No,  
57:18  
that's problem. Did you take away the legal right of the devil? Did you break the soul tie? Did you,  
57:29  
as if not  
57:31  
powerful enough to break through all of that nonsense I've gotta, right?  
57:41  
No,  
57:45  
wow.  
57:51  
Could you imagine a god that's sitting up watching his children and going, you didn't break the legal right? Sorry, my hands are tied.  
58:05  
I'm sovereign, but this is the place where I draw the line, right here, right here in my love Trump's all well, except, except for this one thing, right?  
58:20  
What's in Jesus's whole job to break that whole concept of legal, right?  
58:33  
Yeah, it took away that power i  
58:43  
He essentially walked into an orphanage, kicked the door in and said, these are my kids, and I'm taking them back. That was the end of that argument. I  
59:15  
there's the Beatles wrote a song called helter skelter way back when Charles Manson took it and, like, sang it on this TV interview documentary and kind of like tainted it, you know. And then a few years later, you too, in their Joshua Tree album Live concert, that kind of says, like, Charles Manson stole this from the Beatles. We're stealing it back.  
59:45  
And then sang the song, is that  
59:49  
awesome? That is awesome. That's what God did. Created  
59:53  
this massively beautiful creation. And then he steals it. And then Jesus comes back and goes. Yes, no, I'm taking it back. Taking it back  
1:00:12  
seems very  
1:00:17  
Bono esque,  
1:00:21  
without a doubt, it's a very Bono move,  
1:00:28  
and that's why I love him. He does stuff like that.  
1:00:34  
Wow.  
1:00:40  
So that sense,  
1:00:41  
is it our job, in following Jesus, to do what he did, to go in and say, to kick the door down and goes, Oh, this isn't yours. I'm taking it back. This business, this person, this child, this whatever. This isn't yours taking it back, yeah,  
1:01:07  
well, that's okay, isn't Wow. Okay, this gets interesting, because look at the difference between the Crusades. And by the way, the whole conversation about evangelism is a very interesting conversation.  
1:01:36  
But okay, so fundamentally, if we believe that we are here to do the father's work, then we are here to there are things that we are here to take back. But there's a difference between the Crusades and say, Let's just for sake of example, Mother Teresa.  
1:02:13  
Fascinating that, and if you pursue purpose this, this comes back full circle. If you pursue purpose without first dealing with ego and with knowing and being known, then you will create a crusade.  
1:02:31  
Yes, you've got it, and  
1:02:37  
it will be which is your crusade, and it will be your crusade, which is why the Roy's report is a list of gravestones in crusaders gone rogue, yep. So then the question is, what does it look like that we have a lot of history as human culture around rescuing the oppressed  
1:03:21  
is and clearly this still depends on people's willingness to respond and willingness to pay the price, but few people are making an honest appeal to those in leadership and rising in leadership to know and be known.  
1:03:56  
Most of them have a crusade, and they build Their army. And armies are disposable.  
1:04:09  
Wow,  
1:04:22  
that's the model and  
1:05:06  
This has pretty clear diversion from Hey, we have to figure out messaging today,  
1:05:18  
or maybe laying The foundation for the messaging.  
1:05:23  
This is really profound. You  
1:06:07  
so and I've got two minutes, but I want to ask you this question, what would it look like for you to go into the desert? I like the Desert Fathers, like John the Baptist, like Abraham, like what would It look like for you to go into the desert?  
1:07:51  
It seems like That requires a deeper conversation. I  
1:08:11  
I had this this morning. I  
1:08:34  
I'll think about it. I  
1:09:20  
Okay,  
1:09:22  
I know one piece this is this is independently of this, but I've been wrapping up different mentorships that have been part of. It was just very clearly since noise, not healthy. So maybe even good things, just not for now, yeah, who knows? Who knows? I'm sure there's more  
1:09:50  
cool All right, my friend, well,  
1:09:53  
this is wonderful, yeah, a lot of stuff in here.  
1:09:59  
Get my. I said before, like, last time, you know, like, get the messaging that kind of thing. Let's just kind of go back and forth via email, you know. And like, your thoughts on messaging. I'll give you my thoughts, and we'll just kind of, we could do it that way as well.  
1:10:13  
Yeah, no, that sounds good. Let me, um, I've got, I've got a little bit of time before my first call this morning, so I might just go take a walk and process and see what bubbles up.  
1:10:22  
Okay. Sounds good, cool. Sounds good,  
1:10:25  
Thanksgiving. All right, yeah,  
1:10:26  
see you soon. All right, thanks.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
00:55  
Good morning. Hey, good morning.  
00:58  
How are you? Good  
01:04  
grab some water and some tea. But yeah, please, yes. You know it's i  
Matthias Miller  01:25  
i find it interesting how, of course, marketers and all those people think having been one, I don't know why. It should surprise me, but every conversation with a marketer always goes like this, okay, who's your ideal client? Oh, what is the problem you solve? Oh, what's the outcome that you're after they're after, and what's your proprietary process?  
01:58  
Perfect. Anyway. Do inspiration for the morning I  
02:29  
I think I would just like to answer that question, as far as, like, what's your proprietary process? I'm just smarter than everybody else.  
Matthias Miller  02:40  
Like that. That really works well with people who already have an ego, right? I mean, who are who use being the smartest person is, you know?  
02:59  
Yeah, action.  
03:21  
Good relationship with marketing,  
03:25  
kind of dynamic,  
03:30  
sorry, kind of what I'm kind of dying. I  
Matthias Miller  04:43  
well, it helps. Apparently, if you plug in your computer when the battery's dead,  
04:51  
we're learning all sorts of new things.  
Matthias Miller  04:55  
This is profound. You were saying something about being diametrically opposed to marketing. Yeah,  
05:00  
like, I don't know if it just came from watching commercials when I was a kid or just a a prolonged experience to it, but I have this very or I have had this very cynical view of it, and probably I've known a few marketers, and they just have been my favorite people, yeah, for reasons like you were saying Yeah. Like the questions, they're all standard questions, and it makes it seem like it's a creative unique process, but it really isn't a creative unique process. It's  
Matthias Miller  05:46  
a it's very formulaic sausage making machine. Yeah, I but I think the question is, I one of the things I've been with my stuff that I've been kicking Around is kind of what's the big idea?  
07:17  
And I  
Matthias Miller  07:30  
is it golden handcuffs? That's not really the terminology people use. There's something about the message, it's itself that I've been presenting that draws people in and people who've been exposed to me long enough to know my MO I  
09:02  
let me work we don't have to, yeah,  
09:09  
well, something struck me. It said, you know, there's something in what you're presenting that is, you know, attractive to other people, like by and large. What is it that attracts us, that draws us in  
09:27  
mirrors of ourselves, or who we want to be?  
09:35  
I think in in a pure marketing sense? Yeah, but I think there might be a bigger level above that, and I think marketers know it, and yet they can't actually deliver on it, so they manipulate to try and get people to believe that this thing. Will produce this result. I  
10:32  
Maybe that thing is freedom. I  
Matthias Miller  10:51  
Well, the way I pressure test these is, let's go take life scenarios. Why? Why do let's, let's do career paths. Why do people go to college? Well, so that they can get better jobs. What do they want? Better Jobs they can earn more. What do they want to earn more so that they're not at the mercy of right? So they can travel and do the things that they want. Why do people start, start a business? Well, sometimes it's because they want more money. What does the money afford them? Freedom. Sometimes it's because they don't want a boss telling them what to do, which is also freedom, right? But isn't there. And and then they get into business, and we've talked about this, the business takes over their lives and right? Or they resent it, and it requires them to show up. It's, it's really about, it's kind of a strange way to say this, but it's, it's, it's a little bit of the fear of God conversation that conversations that we had, of Is there anything career, boss, employer, employee, business that has a voice so strong and so loud that I uh, that you've compelled, whether you want to or not. What  
12:37  
do you think?  
12:41  
It's a powerful thought well,  
12:44  
and you can see the fruit from the tree like the idea is, start your own business, financial freedom, more fluid, schedule, all that kind of stuff. And you have these visions of travel, of money, of the but how often does that actually happen?  
13:10  
I would venture to say that in 100%  
13:13  
of the circumstances,  
13:16  
it doesn't happen as much as you imagined it would. I  
13:24  
Yeah, should go back to school. Why go to school? For me, it's like the curiosity. There's stuff there to learn, and if that place ceases to be a place where I can learn, I have no use for it. Yeah,  
14:03  
if that place becomes a place where my freedoms are taken away, my freedom to engage, to explore, to debate, all those kinds of things, if that's taken away, I have no use for it.  
Matthias Miller  14:19  
But isn't it also true that if you that for a different kind of person, that's not freedom, that's bondage.  
14:30  
Oh, I have to,  
Matthias Miller  14:32  
I have to spend time thinking about spiritual development and human psychology, and I have to argue with other just debate versus argue. I have to argue with other people about these things, and I have to write long essays and read boring research articles and and I have to be learning, for God's sake, all day long, like, right?  
14:57  
Yeah, no, no, I, and my response to that would. Be well, then that place isn't for you, correct? There's another path,  
Matthias Miller  15:07  
but, but there's a need. There are, there are needs that are deep within us, itches that have to be scratched, yes, and I think part of the challenge is, well, I mean, it's once again. Let's go back to our fancy quadrants. You have, you have, you have the itch and you have the pain, and you have, I don't know where this fits in, but you have the, well, at least, let's start on the left quadrant, because I know there's something there, and there's the No, this is actually, this actually works. Then there's the healthy and then there's a dysfunction. So, so I have a learning could actually have spent some time down here, but you have it here, there's some things that end up fairly clearly being, you know, you could have something like entertaining people, which could be a healthy itch, but could also have a dark, a dark side of people pleasing, Yep, and learning. Can have a dark side of I there's different ones we could use. Intellectual arrogance would be one,  
16:46  
right? Orferiority,  
Matthias Miller  16:50  
yeah, validation, all of that. But then there's also this pain, because you say that the thing, it's the kind of the what people say about the thing that moves you to tears is the change you're called to make in the world, or that bothers you, and there's a  
17:15  
the pebble in your shoe, if you will, The  
Matthias Miller  17:18  
pebble in your shoe. So in this case, there's something along the lines of human suffering to resolve. I don't know exactly what it is, but here it can be, revenge, injustice. For trauma, just as an example,  
17:45  
right? I'm going to set the world straight. Because this happens, yes. And so the question you become, there's that that there's that operating out of the victim place. Yep, I was a victim. I'm going to set the world straight  
Matthias Miller  18:07  
so these quadrants could actually be as much about. Well, we won't try to find the pattern before there is one. I  
18:34  
Yeah, it seems like victim would go for under dysfunction, this intellectual arrogance, superiority, people pleasing. These are all ways that you deal with your trauma. And victim would be one of those.  
Matthias Miller  18:52  
This would be, you're saying, you're saying, it would be in, yeah,  
18:56  
it would be in that quadrant.  
19:02  
I like that. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  19:10  
so, but then the question is, so much if you want to articulate what you do, you take people from these quadrants, and you move them up,  
19:26  
right,  
19:28  
yeah, usually it would be at least as I see it. It would be counterclockwise. So this dysfunction to hear to pain, to recognize what the itch truly is.  
19:54  
So what? 1234, yeah, I.  
Matthias Miller  20:10  
Because nobody starts with this,  
20:12  
can't, can't, yeah,  
20:19  
and that that itch, it's really fascinating, because it's in existence all the time. It's there. You can feel its presence. You understand that's that, you know Thoreau saying all men live lives of quiet desperation kind of thing. There's the itch underneath. But I don't know why I can't scratch it. So you almost have to go in reverse order from what's present, the dysfunction that's present through here, back to what what caused the pain. To be able to be wiser from that, from The suffering, then you can actually recognize the edge. Wow.  
21:47  
And then usually there's some kind of event,  
22:01  
like this is a I can't find a word,  
Matthias Miller  22:15  
but the picture I Get is as glass being shattered,  
22:20  
yeah, so  
Matthias Miller  22:21  
it's protective glass, and there's an event that destroys that destroys it, It shatters. And so you're trying most times you you're your instinct is to go back to this and it stops working. Yes,  
22:48  
I no longer exist. No  
Matthias Miller  22:50  
longer exist. Yeah, I used to be able to do  
22:56  
A, B and C,  
Matthias Miller  22:59  
and I can't win my way with people anymore. I used to be able to be the smartest guy, but this event, okay, well, let's run through some scenarios. I've been able to politicize this particular journey, path that I'm looking to take, and I got to a place where I couldn't politic my way into being accepted, and everything got thrown back in my face. And the only tool that I had for navigating the situation is politicking and people  
23:34  
pleasing my my ego. That's all I've had, is my ego, which is this right here. This is all ego. This is all ego formed. Yeah, yeah. This is how I learned to deal with the world. And it's great until that shattering event, and it no longer works.  
Matthias Miller  23:59  
Or let's go intellectual arrogance and validation, though you've actually had a mini form of this in high school. The there were, there was one class I dropped one, one course I dropped out of because it was a ridiculous amount of work. The in the tests were not, did not to focus on obscure facts that weren't covered, covered in any of the quizzes or pre study prep. And the other one was, for me, was music because I could. I could, even though our chemistry course was very what I felt was very poorly taught, I could figure my way through that. Even when it come, came to memorizing certain things that drove me crazy. I could find my way through that music. I. I couldn't,  
25:01  
yeah, different  
25:03  
language, different  
Matthias Miller  25:05  
language. And I ended up with a, b in music, which was, you would talk about such a sad, sad life.  
25:11  
It's terrible.  
25:15  
It's catastrophic.  
Matthias Miller  25:16  
It is catastrophic. It but it was, it did, yeah, it did the shadows, but it's, it struck struck a blow. I mean, it didn't destroy it, I don't think, but it struck a blow. And I think, you know, another scenario is you're used to being the smartest person, having all the answers, and you're called into a situation and somebody expects you and demands you to have the answer. What happened here? And you can't tell them, I don't know, they won't accept it, right?  
25:47  
Yeah,  
25:54  
yeah, and it's a very human story over and over again. Just take picture, right? Like I have this competency, I believe. And then some event happens, and then it just shakes you to your core, that whole idea of competency control. I was in control of my world. Everything in my mind, was functioning as it should. I was the maestro leading the orchestra.  
26:22  
I and this event happens, and boom, it shakes you to your core. Those are the kind of things that, that I feel we want to get to in these group conversations, is,  
26:40  
what was the glass shattering event for you? Who were you before that? And who, who have you become after that? Have you ever from and  
27:08  
who were you before? Who are you after?  
27:13  
I think most of the people are, have they cling to who I was before, so there is no room to understand who I'm becoming. Because I just want to get back to who I was. I want to get back to who I was before the divorce, before the death of this person, before the loss of this job, before this event occurred. I just want to get back to you who I was.  
Matthias Miller  27:48  
There's no reckoning that the bridges have been burned. There's only forward.  
27:52  
Yeah, it's  
27:55  
very Cortez landing in Mexico, type of stuff. The boats are burned. There is no going back. You can try and swim back to Spain. Good luck,  
28:06  
good luck.  
28:21  
Wow, I hear this. This makes me think this. I hear this very curious thing pretty regularly. Somebody actually comes into the emotional presence of a glass shattering event, but then they say, but it wasn't bad as this person or this person or this person, it wasn't that bad. Externally, they're saying that, but everything internally says it was that bad for you. Yeah,  
28:54  
it wasn't that bad. Okay, would you like to tell your body that that seems to be reacting as if it was it's that's  
29:06  
funny, I have this constant stomach ache and the headaches and my hands won't stop shaking, But it wasn't that bad. All right.  
29:22  
All right, okay, this friend who he's, he lives in the Houston area, and his wife, like just sitting there, she just has this look on the face, like she look on her face like she wants to kill somebody. It's just like her resting face is just angry. And so every once while he'll look at her goes, you okay? And she goes, Yeah, I'm great. He goes, would you like to tell your face that I.  
Matthias Miller  30:01  
So what compels people is it just still being in denial of what happened, or is it, yeah,  
30:13  
that's got to be a piece of it, right? I don't know if it's the whole thing, but it's got to be a piece of it, if I can still cling on to this, if this is still true, then I don't have to deal with what I'm feeling here and now, right, which is the opposite of discipleship? Yeah. Discipleship is, hey, this is the reality. This is what has happened. This is true. Let's deal with it. And then we're becoming something we're moving forward. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  30:51  
I've often, over the last number of years in terms of spiritual development. Actually, one of my men, yeah, this is something that vivid talked to me about. It was Psalm 23 even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, he's with me, yeah,  
31:14  
so you're well, and there's, there's that, that phrase there too at the end, like, I shall fear no evil. Yeah, it's as if the writer had had that experience, that ballot valley of the shadow of death experience, and was like, I was really afraid of evil in this time. Wow, I'm going to be destroyed.  
Matthias Miller  31:45  
So there's another picture for this, this. I don't know where this all fits in, but there's a lot of this that comes down to, you know, you, you're you're accustomed to climbing mountains, and yes, you have some ups and downs, and all of a sudden you come to the last peak. And there's this one over here that you might actually not be able to see, but the only path forward is down the mountain, through the valley and and it's not until, maybe not even until you start climbing some of these new first ones, that you start recognizing that, no, There's, we're now in a new mountain range, right? And there's a cost. So this is, I mean, this is comfort, and this is cost, and this is where I think you and I have both have experiences with people who say, I can't pay the price, right?  
33:07  
So if you can't pay that price, what's left? What's left? So let's vision this as the valley of the shadow of death here. Yep,  
33:29  
and I like that. You say the cost like the price there. There is a price to be paid in that valley. What if you can or are not willing to pay that price? I You sit down there. You make your home in the darkness. There's and further point. You can't go back up to this hill. You can't go backwards, because your goal is over here, and nothing will allow you, like, call that the Promised Land, or, you know, whatever you want to say about that the goal.  
Matthias Miller  34:13  
I mean, it's the, I forget the exact language, but it actually talks about that. I sit down in the presence of, well, this might be presence of enemies, yeah, oil, let's, let's do this. This is what it is, abundance, my cup. Yeah,  
34:32  
right.  
34:41  
Yeah.  
Matthias Miller  34:43  
And so your choice is, what's the little campground sign? You can do a picnic table, whatever you can camp out right here, or you can pay the price to abundance. You. Abundant slides on the other side of the valley of the shadow of death, right?  
35:05  
There was this, I forget the name of it. There's a Stephen King book written in the early 80s, and I just listened to it maybe a few years back, and it tells the story of, like, it was very timely, as far as, like, the whole covid and, you know, that kind of thing, because there's this, you know, this military project, and it gets out and it kills the majority of the population, and the few survivors that are left are having to try and make their way in this world. So there's a story of this musician lives in New York City, and he survives. And he's got to get out of New York City. Well, there's bridges and tunnels to get out of New York City, essentially. And all the bridges are completely clogged, destroyed, whatever. You can't get out. So he has to go through a tunnel. And he has this lady with them, and they start walking through the tunnel, and the light from one side gets less and less and less, and the light from the other side hasn't penetrated in. So there's this middle spot where it's dark, and she sits she gets scared because she doesn't know what's ahead. Because it's dark, she can't see and she sits down. She makes her camp there, and she dies there because she will not move. And his whole point like he has to leave her because she refuses to move. And he makes his way through scary. Can't see it, but he makes his way through to the to the light on the other side. Again, that image just really resonates with me. As far as that goes,  
Matthias Miller  36:45  
well, there is yeah, yes,  
36:50  
and you don't here's the other powerful thing is you've got dips here as you go from one peak to another. You don't know if the valley is one of these dips as you go from one peak to another, or if it's the sustained Valley, you have no idea,  
Matthias Miller  37:09  
yes, because from here you can see, you have a line of sight to this and you, and you start Going down, and it's further than you thought, and it's further than you thought, and it's further than you thought, and you lose sight. And then that's when the question is, do I sit down and die? And do I keep walking what I can't see? Right?  
37:34  
It reminds me of like, you know, around here, like fall, winter, you drive up to the mountains, and at a certain point you break through the cloud cover. And so it's clear and you can see forever, but it's like there's a cloud cover over this valley, so you don't know what that valley is going to look like when you get into it. Yeah,  
38:35  
it's almost like we need in the midst of these processes in life, and these valleys and these peaks, it's almost like we need the real imagery here to explain what we're actually experiencing, because we try and put words to it, and it's ineffable. You can't put words to it. It's like an experience. It's a sacred experience. It's like an experience with God, like you could have an experience with him, and you could try and tell people about it, but it's always going to fall short, because it's inevitable. So that's on one side that that what do you call it, the ecstasy of a encounter with God, but on the other side, the pain of the valley. You can try and explain it, but you can't put words to it. It's ineffable. So in that sense, it's a very holy and sacred experience. Both the ecstasy and the pain are sacred experiences. Can't describe it, because if it was a human experience, you could describe it. This isn't a human experience. I.  
Matthias Miller  40:10  
There ends up being this, for lack of any better term depth that emerges  
40:19  
right  
40:22  
the depth of experience, which I would say, is wisdom that only comes from the pain of the valley.  
40:39  
Ah, you're going to love this. What I see, what I see Christians doing, is camping on one of the peaks. And anybody that comes along, they try and keep people from going in the valley. Go there. You don't want to go there. You  
41:00  
and yet,  
41:05  
they're experts on the valley, but they've never actually been in it. They're on the peak, looking down into it. I'll go in there. Not good. And they've never talked to anybody who's been in the valley seriously, travels Right to left, they only travel left to right.  
41:42  
The armchair Sherpas.  
41:44  
Yeah, yes, I love that term  
41:55  
that would piss a lot of people off, and I really like it for that reason.  
42:05  
I'm gonna sing a trend here.  
42:06  
Yeah,  
42:09  
don't do this. Do this to get out. And usually the do this to get out is anything but get through.  
42:16  
Yes, go around it somehow, someway. And  
Matthias Miller  42:20  
yeah, go around it. And so, I mean, there's all kinds of things like each tradition kind of has its, it's, you know, it's, it's anywhere from, you know, the declare, to, you know, doubling down on disciplines To  
42:45  
to  
Matthias Miller  42:49  
just straight up, find a different path. I  
43:05  
God, let me go down. It  
43:08  
is really like it just striking me right now. This is really, really sacred stuff. This isn't business, this isn't marketing, this isn't self interest. This is really, really foundational what it means to be a human being, type of stuff. Mm, hmm.  
43:47  
And that this is what I've said for years, like, as far as that position at the top of the peak and the people who have stood there, I don't trust you because you haven't been in the valley. Yeah, and I know you haven't been in the valley because of the language you use, because it's all avoidance language.  
44:13  
Yep, I like it.  
Matthias Miller  44:21  
And I mean, versus the experienced Sherpa, yeah, which is been there? Keep walking. I'm with you. It's kind of  
44:42  
good reason. Getting hurt. We'll  
44:49  
get messy  
44:59  
some. So powerful here. It's like, I'm not trying to sell you anything. This, this person is not trying to the Sherpa is not trying to sell you anything. Yeah,  
45:17  
the armchair Sherpa is trying to sell you something.  
45:19  
Yep. Selling an agenda,  
45:26  
yeah, and think of like that, selling something is, is is so targeted towards a human frailty, and the human frailties to avoid discomfort or pain, suffering. And these, these people appear the armchair Sherpas are like, I can tell you how to avoid that. I  
46:11  
i got the answer, you don't have to go through that, which resonates with especially the last week of his life, of Jesus's life, it resonates with it. How many times did he have the opportunity to avoid what was coming?  
Matthias Miller  46:31  
Even his prayer in the garden was the admission that, I mean, this was okay. We read about we don't read, okay, so let's talk temptations for a second. We read that he was tempted in every way, but then as far as in his life, we read about the temptation in the desert. And then we read what must have been in some form, a temptation in the garden, which the temptation being the avoidance of pain. Yeah,  
47:04  
well, he looks at Peter at a certain point, he goes, Do you not think I couldn't command legions of angels to come and stop this? Right? That's a temptation. I and,  
47:26  
and so if you're really conditioned in this system, the armchair Sherpa system and avoidance of pain, somebody over here who says the only way, the only way to get to the other side is through it, you were going to hate those people. They're going to be heretics.  
Matthias Miller  47:50  
Well, I mean, and I it harkens back so the the fundamentalist view, is if you, if you only subscribe to the right ideology and the right belief system. So let's take this is perhaps getting you know not, not to pick fights, but pulling back  
48:21  
from my story, come on, let's pick some fights. Let's pick  
Matthias Miller  48:25  
some fights. Picking the story of divorce and remarriage. If you have a theology that does not allow for that doesn't allow for messiness, doesn't allow for messiness, and it doesn't allow for for pain, and it allows you to, I mean, there's all kinds of avoidance that goes on with that. But there's also the flip side on if you want to go, go way on the other side of of the charismatic perspective is if believing for a miracle. And declaring a miracle can also be a form of avoidance of pain. You've  
49:06  
got the spectrum right  
Matthias Miller  49:09  
spectrum. Once again, we're back to to an axis shift where it's not it's it's the, I mean, it's, it's the, Typically we look at this as a spectrum of, you know, fundamentalism versus maybe this isn't quite the right term. You could, you could perhaps say you. A mystical slash experiential, slash supernatural. And maybe these are those. These are approximations, and most people look at this as the spectrum to look at, where do I fit within? Christendom, yeah, and the challenges that we've had in the past. And I think what a lot of the folks, a lot of folks who are writing topics like spiritual abuse and things like that, are trying to introduce is that there is another spectrum here,  
50:39  
which is  
50:42  
pain avoidance  
50:44  
or or embracing the pain and I  
Matthias Miller  51:07  
and I think one of the things that I mean for three years, what I was looking for was to find the proper space on this spectrum. And perhaps it's not just whatever. It's not this simple but, but what I really was ultimately looking for was an embrace of the messy and the dark and the unexplained in a way that can actually integrate both of these worlds, and it doesn't become an either or of an integrated whole. Fundamentalism is, is the extreme that's not, I'm not talking about fundamentalism as it ism  
51:55  
but, and as you draw that diagram in the spectrum, to me, I see that, like, what I see is the religious means of dealing with pain. So either some sort of mystical experience, like, you said, like the the divorce paradigm, like, there's some sort of miraculous mystical extreme over here, and there's some sort of you can't ever leave over here, right? And yet to blow all of that up and step into a step by step journey you  
52:50  
because neither of these are going to work, because they're all based on avoidance, and so like that Vertical, to me, is almost like that's really and I like that. It's vertical, because the pain avoidance leads you down, yes, and the the embracing of the pain leads you towards becoming, towards wisdom, towards unity, yeah, because that's walking in the footsteps of Jesus.  
Matthias Miller  53:27  
It's also really interesting that the Anabaptist tradition has tried to make has created an ideology around things like non resistance, but which has morphed over time from Jesus teaching on going the second mile and leaning in this suffering whatever, and it has become some form of avoidance such that I don't want to get into the messiness of politics, yeah, in the military. And what does this mean? And, yeah, how do we process that? And human experience,  
54:13  
and  
54:14  
human experience,  
54:16  
which is so interesting, I heard this recently. There's a rabbi teaching on this news, talking about the turning the other cheek reference within the Sermon on the Mount. And like the the language that he uses is this person has slapped another with their left hand, which is something you would do to a slave or something less than you. So turning the other cheek is like, No, you're going to treat me like a man, like a human being. It's not just keep getting hit. It's a demanding of my person as an image bearer of God that you have to recognize that you.  
55:01  
Wow,  
55:06  
so it's really not even about non violence.  
Matthias Miller  55:11  
It's about dignity and identity. I  
55:27  
Wow,  
55:37  
profound, I  
Matthias Miller  55:50  
this is also, this is where, if we could, if there's one shift I could bring to Western Christendom, it would be breaking this language and getting people aware of this language? Yeah,  
56:09  
well, and that's like, that's why I struggle with not struggle with it. There's a wrestling inside me, like with labeling this right hand extremist mysticism, because by the very definition of what mysticism means is it's somebody who's seeking union with God, a deeper intimacy with God.  
56:37  
So what's an appropriate label for Yeah, that's  
56:40  
what I'm trying to come up with, hyper spirituality, I guess.  
Matthias Miller  56:48  
But you have that in fundamentalism as well. It's, it's a different form of hyper spirituality.  
56:53  
How would you see it on the fundamentalist side, hyper  
Matthias Miller  56:58  
spirituality, on the fundamentalist side is the extreme case is, I've got the 10 Commandments sitting in my yard so that the people know that there's judgment coming.  
57:08  
I like it.  
57:10  
Oh, I like that.  
Matthias Miller  57:15  
And here it's a maybe this is as simple as Bible versus spirit. I don't know  
57:24  
one of the pastors I like listening to. He's in Alabama. One of his phrases is, it's not the Father the Son and the Holy Bible love.  
57:42  
It. The word, the word is flesh. The word is alive. Word is here and now. You know because, but we want to make it as it was said, yeah. But even in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says with from the scriptures, from the very beginning, it has been said, but I'm saying to you, yeah,  
Matthias Miller  58:11  
there's a Have you heard the book? What is wrong with Protestant theology? No, I think that's what it is.  
58:23  
Let me see. Let me check my order history. How  
58:36  
many volumes is that book  
Matthias Miller  58:41  
longer than the Bible.  
58:49  
Let me see, yeah, theology. What is wrong with Protestant theology?  
58:57  
I think this is the one I  
Matthias Miller  59:06  
Yeah, by Dr ruthman,  
59:10  
yeah, yeah.  
Matthias Miller  59:11  
I think, yeah, I think. So, I think I got mine used or something. So I'm not sure I'm 90% it's a different Cover than I remember, but I'm 90% sure that's i  
59:45  
Holy Moly, the used paperback is like 40 bucks. I love it.  
Matthias Miller  59:58  
One of those things that's. Anyway, it talks about the formulation of of these types of of the trinity of the Father Son and Holy Bible, yeah, basic, basically, his explanation was the Reformation. If you wanted to take poke down as the authority, you had to replace it with something else, with something which my  
1:00:21  
my suggestion would be the Holy Spirit, but apparently it was always so fascinating to me, and this is neither here nor there, but  
1:00:34  
the fact that Calvin was a lawyer, and so he focuses heavily on the and where do you find the law? Well, there's got to be a codex. The Codex is the Bible.  
1:00:54  
That makes a lot of sense.  
1:00:59  
Yeah, and you got to have a sacred text  
Matthias Miller  1:01:03  
the premise of, I mean, it also explains where the premise of Protestantism is, war based, side based, line based. And so if We had to, I um,  
1:01:42  
um, so,  
1:01:52  
what  
1:01:55  
am I after?  
Matthias Miller  1:01:58  
So, what are these but I think, I think what we're looking for, I think what I'm only trying to articulate is, how do people what's Oh, go ahead. It's you. I.  
1:03:00  
All right, back.  
Matthias Miller  1:03:01  
Okay, there we go. All right. But I think what I'm what looking for is actually, how does the world how? How do most people view, at least the people we're talking to, how do they view the world. And I think if you had to, if we had to draw something, it could be something like evangelicalism in the center, and then and you maybe have charismatic on the on the right and and traditional. On the left. Yeah, is that an appropriate  
1:03:50  
I think so. But that that's all religion like that timeline. Is all religion?  
1:03:58  
Agreed?  
1:04:02  
Yeah. And then you've got your, your far ends of the spectrum, yeah,  
Matthias Miller  1:04:16  
traditional slash, even, you might even say Cessationist and charismatic and and this, this may be, I don't know it's, It's fair to call them hyper charismatic, but, but, um, it's at least a spectrum for how people and it's also and it can also be you. Maybe, maybe there's multiple slash additional and charismatic, slash, seeker friendly. I kind of know exactly what it is, but yeah,  
1:05:27  
and everything inside me says, like, blow that timeline up,  
1:05:35  
yeah, because it's useless. Yeah. I  
1:05:57  
Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  1:06:02  
you I think I don't know how much time you want to spend, how much time you want to spend here. I think I've got some cancelation for this morning. I  
1:06:24  
So, yeah, I  
1:06:24  
got about 15 more minutes. Okay,  
1:06:26  
sounds good, yeah, I guess. So we're two from here.  
1:06:35  
What was that? I  
Matthias Miller  1:06:37  
guess where to from here. I and  
1:06:50  
tying it back to what we were talking about before, maybe the only thing that breaks across breaks this, this dynamic up, this timeline up is a glass shattering event. Yes and no. There's no way to deal with the glass shattering event on this timeline.  
1:07:09  
It can't do it.  
Matthias Miller  1:07:13  
What if we take this back to last week, which unfortunately wasn't recorded, but  
1:07:19  
what?  
Matthias Miller  1:07:22  
Um? What about how does glass shattering How do glass shattering events tie back into we talked about the  
1:07:38  
going way back. I  
1:07:49  
uh, you got it right there, false self. It shatters the false self. Yeah, so,  
Matthias Miller  1:08:03  
so in in business, so this is the, this is the religious paradigm. But there's also some kind of, is there an equivalent in the business paradigm  
1:08:24  
to a glass shattering event,  
Matthias Miller  1:08:26  
to to an axis that the glass shatters? Or is it as simple as do it by the numbers, set the goals, make it happen, push forward. Better marketing, better. Sales better.  
1:08:41  
That's pain avoidance, right? Pain avoidance.  
1:08:56  
Wait a minute. I  
Matthias Miller  1:09:05  
it is all fundamentally pain avoidance, sales. I want this tactic to win more people so I don't have to deal with the fact that some people don't want what I have to offer, or that I'm viewed as an inferior person marketing. And in fact, when you've got the interesting thing about business is when you've got departments with pain avoidance, I wouldn't be seen as a superior marketer. And so you amp up the prompt or sales person, you amp up the promises on the front end, and it creates the it creates pain for somebody else further down the line, right? Do? But from a business owner perspective, here's this partnership, here's this market shift, here's this economic downturn, here's this competitor, here's this and it's also why success is the worst enemy, because in business, it's very easy jump back to this. Many people. Okay? I think as much as I just as much as I do not want his lifestyle and disagree with some of his methodologies, I think Elon Musk, whether this is truly done by embracing pain or not, has more than more than most people been willing to go down the mountain and walk through the darkness when he can't see the next step that's right in front  
1:10:52  
of him, right? And Bezos is the same way, if you hear him talk like I've heard him, heard speeches on multiple occasions where he said, I learned to live in the desert  
1:11:07  
for so long that I just became the desert. It's home. I'm not afraid of it. I learned to live there.  
1:11:15  
Wow.  
1:11:19  
And even I've heard I've heard people across different disciplines make that exact same statement. I heard Maya Angelou, the poet and writer, say the exact same thing.  
Matthias Miller  1:11:39  
So this and this also ties back to conversations we've had about, about this, about seals. So what you're talking about developing is a tribe of people. This is, this is a really compelling pitch man, so compelling, I can a tribe of people who are people of the desert,  
1:12:06  
yeah, people of the valley, climbers, serpents.  
1:12:13  
None of them chose to go into the valley or to end that desert. The circumstances of their lives pushed them there, yeah, and they had to learn how to survive.  
1:12:28  
Wow, wow.  
Matthias Miller  1:12:35  
But it's not. The fascinating thing about this is it's not the i  
1:12:40  
because this  
Matthias Miller  1:12:44  
is all coming from a place of wisdom and becoming in unity and embracing pain. It isn't the ego driven. Go eat go eat sand, go eat glass,  
1:13:00  
to become something like you, I need to be something and this seems to be the way. So using the seal, you know, narrative, those that go into that process with that mindset, they end up ringing the bell. They end up quitting. Yeah, yeah, the people who were meant to be there who their life circumstances led them there that yes, can't complete it. Wow. There cannot be any ego in that, yeah, or you will fail. And typically fail miserably, which could be a glass shattering event, which would lead you back,  
1:13:44  
right? Should you accept? Should you accept?  
1:13:51  
I've had so much I've had so much time and thought invested in this idea in my own life. Why do I keep finding myself in the desert, I don't want to be here. And for decades fighting that, and finally coming to the place of I'm in the desert. What do I need to learn here?  
1:14:11  
Yeah, that's it. That's it.  
1:14:23  
That's that's the book. That's the book avoid the armchair Sherpa.  
1:14:39  
That's a brilliant  
1:14:40  
line, the armchair Sherpa. I love it  
1:14:49  
good. All right,  
Matthias Miller  1:14:58  
this is going somewhere. I. This is going somewhere, somewhere powerful. It's  
1:15:05  
going to make us a lot of friends, and it's going to make us a lot of enemies. One of  
Matthias Miller  1:15:11  
my best, best, you know, this is one of those sage marking advice. How do you get something that sells you the best selling books on Amazon often have like, two and a half star reviews, because all the haters have to read it to pick it apart, and all the people who love it exactly  
1:15:33  
there I heard Paul Young, the guy who wrote the shack, talking, and he said, one of his buddies who was a writer came up to him, and he's like, he's like, man, Could you could you take have all of your people who follow you go give me a negative review? And he's like, why he goes? Because it seems to have worked for you. You have people absolutely hate you, and then you have people absolutely love you, and it just drives book sales, and he just laughs about  
1:16:11  
it. That's awesome, well, and it's Jesus,  
1:16:14  
right? He's a very polarizing figure, extremely polarizing. Either you hate him or you love him. There's not much indifference about Jesus.  
1:16:25  
Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  1:16:26  
no, there's not. One of the things that I love about this as well, is in the age of AI, where and with any acceleration and growth of technology, you know, with every market force, there's a counter force, and this is the unchanging the human condition and the human experience is the unchanging thing that won't disappear. But well, but it's also coming in higher demand,  
1:17:03  
the more that we because we've we've searched the extremes, anything else that could affect the human experience. We've searched it. So how about we dive into the actual human experience?  
1:17:22  
Yeah. Yeah, I like it.  
1:17:29  
This is going somewhere, and we are in we are not  
1:17:32  
in control of it.  
1:17:36  
This is grabbing a tiger by a tail. Thank God for the ride.  
1:17:44  
Wow, wow, wow. All right,  
1:17:47  
so  
1:17:49  
rest of this week is shot.  
1:17:54  
I think  
Matthias Miller  1:18:01  
probably next Wednesday, Same Same time, same thing. What would work for me?  
1:18:09  
Perfect, yeah. Let's put it on there. The 21st Yeah, 21st  
1:18:14  
Yeah, sending it over now. Okay, perfect.  
1:18:19  
Thanks, Kevin. All right, my friends, I'll see you soon. All  
1:18:24  
right. Sounds good. Bye.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
01:03  
Good morning. Hey, morning, how are you good we  
Matthias Miller  01:13  
had our daughter was up early, and he had some extra time to make sure my wife and I could get going, and she could see the kids up to school and all that. So totally makes  
01:31  
sense. I'm good. I'm good waking up a little bit. Yeah. Oh,  
01:45  
where do we dive into our adventure? Where should we start?  
Matthias Miller  01:54  
Well, just a fun little thing. So I consulted with somebody on my Facebook ads, and actually two things, ran into this guy through one of the groups that I'm part of, and saw my website and booked a call with me, and he's like, I don't know why I'm doing this, but I just want to reach out and get Your perspective of what I'm working on and whatever, and I've been using him as a sounding board for for messaging and stuff. And it's it's been quite helpful. And so it's been an interesting connection. And then I turned on turn ads on yesterday, after I redid everything and got my first 15 minute call booking on the new on the new booking. So we'll see how it how it plays out. See the next anyway, there's all this stuff that it's fun,  
03:05  
progress,  
03:07  
yeah, yeah. I mean, it seems like a very like organic. I'm curious. I'm interested. Let's see what happens, kind of process, yeah, and that's exciting,  
Matthias Miller  03:26  
I mean, and then we were working with I also had a conversation yesterday with a friend of mine who's she's going through kind of a similar exploratory process, and is done with all the traditional business paradigm stuff for yourself, and one of the ways that we're looking to frame this is heartening, back to the collaborative strategy. So let me show up as me. You know, on the 15 minute call, let me show up as me. Give you who I am seven minutes for seven minutes, rest of it, you get to direct and you get to take where you want. And if it makes sense for us to work together, then that itself becomes a collaborative strategy. So we're not putting pressure on for this to look like anything, but we're going to let this evolve together and what it needs to be. All right,  
04:33  
I don't know why this phrase comes to mind, but it does. As you were talking like I've heard many times in business, like the reference to, you know, you you put coal under pressure to create a diamond. And so we put pressure, we people, put people under pressure because it will bring about a diamond. And the thing that never met made sense to me was that coal being. Being put under pressure is a natural process, right? You putting pressure on somebody else is not a natural process. It's coercion. Yes, what it sounds like to me is like just a natural process of let's see if this works. If it works, great, if it doesn't work, then, okay,  
05:24  
yeah, yeah.  
05:39  
And I think as I've been thinking, sorry to interrupt no keep going, I think as I've thought about it over the few weeks, we've kind of been meeting and talking about it, I think that's what the Lord wants to do. I think he wants to take natural processes, and he wants to bless them, and as an example to his people, that this is me who's doing this, not you and your typical marketing strategies or, you know, all that kind of stuff. This is me who's doing this. So I think we play ourselves in a sweet spot.  
Matthias Miller  06:25  
I mean, it kind of triggers two thoughts when Richard Kosh is a great book called, I think, the natural laws of business, where he translates physics to different physics. And, you know, those types of things the business which, which is still very, you know, kind of very left brain type of approach to it, but I feel like one of the mindset shifts for me has been it's always had to have been a very cold and calculated engineer your way to success and make the Next Step favorite so and it's like, I think the biggest one of the big battles has been, can I show up completely as me, trust my instincts and him leading me, and have it actually work? Yeah?  
07:15  
Yeah. Trust your gut. Trust your gut, yeah.  
07:27  
Because, in a sense, if you're not trusting your gut, what are you trusting? Yeah, I  
07:47  
for us as human beings, if we're not trusting our gut, what we're typically trusting is the the wisdom of the crowd around us.  
Matthias Miller  07:57  
Yeah, people like my friend really resonated. Or actually two folks, the two folks I've shown this to, really resonated with the idea of internalizing truth versus externalizing truth. I  
08:23  
yeah,  
08:28  
my mind keeps coming back to, I don't know if it was last time or the time before that we were talking about the valley, and the glass shattering moment keeps coming back to the concept of the armchair Sherpa. And how many there are, how many experts, how many coaches, how many guides there are. There really haven't been in that valley, but like to tell people what it's like to be in that valley,  
09:04  
because it sells, because it sells,  
09:10  
because everybody who's trying to avoid the valley is looking for a quick way out of the valley, and They're giving you a quick way out of the valley.  
09:24  
Problem is just doesn't work,  
Matthias Miller  09:31  
which ironically, keeps you in the valley longer, right?  
09:35  
So accomplishes the exact opposite of  
09:37  
what  
09:38  
we're trying to accomplish, which is very human thing.  
09:44  
It's very human.  
Matthias Miller  10:49  
The colleague I like I was working with on messaging, kept getting after me for deleting sentences. He's like, That's a good sentence. Don't delete it. Just put somewhere else. Um, the anyway, in situations like this, it's very easy for me to innovate and iterate past with good stuff that we had, and difficult for me to evaluate across the whole spectrum of here's the meat. This is the real core of what we need to communicate. I think one of the other interesting questions that emerged, which is this question of, what is the what is the question? What is the them centered message. So for the people that we're looking to have within the show event, from their vantage point, what are the problems that they're facing? What is it that they want to know? What intrigues them about this? What draws them in? I this unifying value  
12:42  
and it's almost beyond  
12:58  
the practical everyday life kind of things, because there's no shortage of people speaking into those issues. Time management, you know, interaction with your co workers or community, it's almost, to me, it's almost like we're going deeper into the existential crisis each person is Dealing with.  
Matthias Miller  13:36  
This is really prevalent, by the way, I I got a 15 minute booking from a guy who's grew a business from zero to 100 million and electrical engineering background and was teaching at universities and feels like expertise is commoditized, or people expect it to even be free, and wants to know what to do. So that's not much to ask for in 15 minutes, yeah, so go  
14:12  
ahead and solve that problem.  
14:20  
I um, so,  
14:34  
yeah, it's what does it mean to be a human and to live in this world and to find peace, joy, contentment, those are the existential questions that we're talking about.  
Matthias Miller  14:57  
Yep, if I really. Wanted to capture somebody's attention. The perfect time to start the conversation, if there is one, is right after the right on the heels of the glass shattering event. You've just had this happen, the divorce, the business failing, the the business partnership now working out the bankruptcy the I mean, maybe part of the problem is rationally. The problem is these are the people who are at least in a position to pay. And maybe it's not even there. Maybe it's like, maybe it's a year or two down the road.  
15:56  
That was my thought. That was my thought, exactly is it's probably not the perfect time right after the event. Hey, because they don't have they're still caught up in the emotions of the event, the emotions of the event, so no time to process or work through things or that kind of thing, or to to feel it. It's almost like a year or 210, years, 20 years down the road, where they're still trying to deal with that event and have not been able to  
Matthias Miller  16:29  
well. And I mean, I'm thinking, I'm sure you've seen patterns. It'd be interesting to see when people show up for you. But thinking of myself, it was three years before, three and a half years before I showed up at your doorstep. Yeah,  
16:45  
it's almost like you have to get to this place where you have tried everything you know how to do and it has not worked, because the majority of what's out there wants to fix you,  
17:05  
and fixing  
17:07  
fixing you, you, fixing you or somebody else fixing you is never going to work.  
17:19  
We need it's the person in front of us needs. We need to be known. You need to face that circumstance. We need to understand what was happening there. We need to come to grips with that. Yeah, I mean,  
Matthias Miller  17:42  
the analysis. Analogy is the medical system symptom management, exactly.  
17:46  
That's all the system is doing.  
Matthias Miller  17:52  
There's also this functional there's a term that's used to describe functional health. I forget what they call it, symptom free, disease free. I don't know what it's like the middle section where you're not healthy, but you don't have symptoms like and I don't know exactly what. I wish I could remember the terminology that was used to describe this, but it's the idea that hold on one second.  
18:24  
Oh, there you go. Okay, sorry. My headphones freaked out for a second. So that middle space where you're you're not presenting, is sick, but you're feeling things it hasn't started manifest yet.  
Matthias Miller  18:37  
You don't have disease, and you're not like hyper healthy, but your symptom is basically symptom free illness, in some kind of sense. And there's this almost like walking dead kind of like or like alive, but not whatever the right terminology is. Analogy is, but it's existing, but not living might be a good term. Yeah,  
19:06  
yeah.  
Matthias Miller  19:16  
So, so, I mean, I think a legitimate question then too, is, if I wanted to, I think we might have talked about this before, but I think of this as a progression you have, you know, life is going great, and then there's the glass shattering event, and then, and then there's the, the first of all, the emotion of the event. Then let's, let's go solve this, solve this, solve this, solve this. And then you get to the point where we cannot be solved. As a side note, I kind of wonder where the whether it's the heroes journey. Or the one of my mentors shared that the classic film script, if you want, if you want people to like a character, take away one of their parents, you want them to like them really well, to take away both of them, make them an orphan, and then there's this crushing defeat, and then there's this going to the valley, then there's the momentary success, and then there's the second defeat. And then, you know, they have to overcome that, and it's not until they overcome it the second time that, you know, get the kingdom, get the girl. Like, that's like, the picture of paradise, whatever on the other side, yeah. But if we wanted to articulate back to people, I think you mentioned some of this before, I think, I think it would be helpful to say, to articulate, these are the these are the glass shadow events, and this was its impact on them. So I think we mentioned some of them, the board's business, failing, losing a job,  
21:12  
death of a loved one, death of a loved one. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  21:20  
are there others that come to mind me on that, or who's all the  
21:26  
I mean, I think, I think your betrayal, betrayal by family, by friends, isolation from a community, right?  
21:41  
Some sort of legal issue, you know. I mean, if you look back to the  
21:49  
to the Passion narrative, you know, Jesus experienced pretty much every human fear that could could be encapsulated. Yeah, it's like, just choose one of those. And you've got the you've got the raw materials, yep.  
22:19  
And then  
Matthias Miller  22:31  
emotions associated with it or betrayal, disappointment, grief, shot I will usually I would  
22:40  
narrow it down to four, okay, fear, shame, anger, sadness, and any cocktail or mixture of those four,  
22:59  
yep, and most  
23:04  
circumstances, most situations, most therapies will try and get you to limit the effects of those things, treat the symptoms of those things, but in reality, these four things are a path that lead us back to the glass shattering event. Which will we need to resolve, we need to understand, we need to accept and know what happened. So these are a roadmap.  
Matthias Miller  23:42  
So this is things like, okay, let's, let's walk through this. So fear, and I don't know if this is what you're referring to, but I've seen it, and it drives me crazy. It's like fear is, I mean, perhaps there's nuanced truth in this, but it's the idea of fear you feel the fear to do it anyway, like, allow it to like, I don't know how to describe it. There's a there's a leading end of fear and embracing fear. But there's also the fear in which it's rather than embracing it, it's all about, all about keeping it at arm's length and just taking it along for the ride. And I don't know how to describe that, but there's this pushing through the fear like, just control you  
24:38  
Exactly. And that's the thing is, is if that fear what it actually does, there's, there's an event that happened and that really scared me. And instead of understanding why that scared me, I spend the rest of my life trying to keep from that thing from happening again, really. So it controls the rest. Of my actions, right, right? So, like a perfect example of it is, my mom grew up in a broken family, and all she ever wanted was a family, but that was fear driven because she never wanted to experience the dysfunction of brokenness again. So her fear was that so that controlled the rest of her decision making, and what ended up happening is she created the same situation that she was raised in because of the fear. Her eyes were solely focused on the fear, and it controlled everything, yeah, yeah. So her wiz her wisdom was, avoid this thing, right? And then we'll be okay,  
25:55  
right? But it never happens.  
26:00  
But it ever happens.  
26:02  
It's been said theologically, Judas his greatest fear was the continuing continuance of living under Roman oppression for the rest of his for the rest of his life and for his people. That's what he was afraid of. And so he had this context that that was the problem. So even though he spent three years around Jesus, and Jesus is continually saying, This is not about empire, this is not about Rome. This is about your heart. Let's go, you know, look at that. He still once it became really clear that Jesus was not interested in overthrowing Rome, that fear controlled his actions, right? And so he did what he did because he was afraid that this was going to be the reality of the Israel's existence going  
26:57  
to be permanent, yeah,  
Matthias Miller  27:01  
or that he would have to suffer through that right. And you would apply that same pattern to shame, anger and sadness this event happened, and rather than taking a nuanced, curious view of why you experience the emotion, you categorically say, here's the thing, don't let it. Don't  
27:31  
want anything to do with that. And what ends up happening is you end up creating the circumstances you're so vastly afraid of or ashamed of or scared of.  
27:47  
So then what are  
Matthias Miller  27:55  
but that's way more obvious than what most people are aware of. The way you described it is way simpler and way more obvious than the witness people. So when you put somebody in the situation of fear, for example, pragmatically. So let's go pick a bail that's you famous marketers got nailed with FTC violations, one of them talked about, don't ever send me any direct mail in a FedEx envelope  
28:34  
and  
Matthias Miller  28:39  
and so, picking that as an example, there's this, there's a lot of fear associated with the FedEx envelope, because it's probably there's, it's associated with the government coming after them and taking them through an expensive audit or trial period and settlement ends up being better than you know, the least single options, whether or not you're innocent or guilty. If we were looking at that person's life using the standard we had to tell a story of that person's life and the way that person is typically looking to solve that issue. And let's say that they're going beyond just, hey, I want to make sure I don't get FedEx envelopes. But they're like, Okay, this is that they have some semblance of an idea that this is a problem and they want to fix it. How would they go about fixing it, partially fixing it? Does that make sense? Does my question make  
29:50  
sense? Yeah, to a certain extent, yeah, yeah. So like, I see a very human pattern in that. It, this happened hard line. We can't ever do this again, because this happened right? Instead of understanding the subtlety and nuance of why this happened, the fear drives you to a hard line, so it's really just being Pharisaical about it, because you look at it big picture, what the Pharisees believed was, is we followed the law perfectly, then Messiah would come. It was about their performance. I And the reality is that Jesus comes in and says, you know all the loss, you know all the rules. You know what to do, but what you're missing is the heart of it. You're missing the relational aspect.  
Matthias Miller  30:59  
So which goes back to knowing and being known, which means that what's happened is you take the event and you assign personal meaning to it, yes, but you don't allow anyone close to your person, hood to your knowing and being known. And therefore you can never address the real thing. That's it. And so you're externalizing and problem solving everything. It's basically anything we can fix this problem anyway, except by self disclosure and being known. Yeah. So in this case, I'm going to go build a business. I mean, in this case, literally, I don't know. Go ahead, be careful what we talk about here. But not really looking to do armchair you know, whatever it is, but like in this case, they're building a business around helping people avoid getting nailed by the FTC. So it could be legitimate. It could be that this is their healthy response to what happened. It could be that this is a reactionary, self protective thing of I feel so shameful, violated by what happened, that I'm going to externalize this and I'm going to do something yes and and. So the way that you identify this is, I mean, isn't this analogous to Mary and Martha, where Mary sits at the feet of Jesus, connected and Martha, for some reason, you has this. It's, there's this picture of a busy body going around, rearranging everything and making everything right, and going and doing something, but don't get close to me, or don't get close to my heart. And so the the way that you identify is really, I uh, that one to three year period, or one to 10, or however long it's been, is where it's been. All about the doing, if I can just find the right thing to do, the right what is the right step, what is the right path, what is the right all of that, and then with that, it's the you know in business. It's who has the right who's the right information, who's the right market model, who's got the right business strategy. What are the right industries to get into? What are the you know, in in in marriage? You probably know this better than I do, but it's, it's like, what are the right things to do? How do I find the right person and and probably, finding the right person actually becomes a fairly frequent it probably depends a little bit which direction the people's, you know, the individual's marriage, is going, but either one of those, it's externalizing, right? And looking out there, you also see this behavior, or we saw this kind of behavior a lot with in foster care, where you've got people in precarious relationships, and the wife has a kid to try to glue the relationship together, which is another way of externalizing something internal, in hopes to it's a doing something really to right, fix the relationship. I  
34:38  
buy a house, I get a pet. I have a child. This is going to fix what's wrong here.  
Matthias Miller  34:47  
And but then it's all the classic midlife crisis stuff, too. Of like, I find the mistress, I buy the buy the I buy the car, i i, i or the supercar. And I, you know. Go on these international trips, right?  
35:07  
Yeah, and there has to be so then, okay, so there's the glass shattering event,  
Matthias Miller  35:15  
where there's something great, which is like defeat Number One. But there's also this period of denial in which I can fix this by the sad or the other thing. The other thing, externalizing it, externalizing it. But somewhere there's this awakening where it's an admission to self that this isn't working anymore  
35:54  
at all. Yeah, and that's the thing is, instead of dealing with it internally and being honest about the thoughts and feelings that this is not working anymore, I start to externalize things to try and get it to work instead of being honest. So you take a relationship instead of being honest with the person in front of you that this is not working. This is a we issue. What we need to do differently. It becomes, if I could just fix them and vice versa. You and I think it keeps people from being, I think the religious view of marriage and relationships, just in this area, keeps us from being brutally honest with what we think and feel. Well, I can't say that, and I can't think that. Okay. Well, here's the problem with that. You  
36:54  
do?  
36:58  
You do think that. You do feel that,  
37:02  
but I can't, but I do,  
37:06  
and so how do I solve that issue? I  
37:23  
so I create circumstances and situations that deliver that message to the other versus me saying that.  
Matthias Miller  37:38  
And once again, we externalize the message, yes, exactly, so,  
37:44  
so I've seen this happen three or four times. It's funny. I was just talking to a client last night. He's a musician, and he's been a worship leader like his whole career, and he started writing music and performing it in in bars and that kind of thing. And he was happy, and there was a lot of progress, and he felt the Lord with him and all that kind of thing. And then the church came against him for doing that. And so he just solely went back to church and only church, and he just felt like dead inside, yeah, and as he started to feel dead inside, he started to get these feelings about what it would look like to feel alive, well, this relationship, or that, you know, any number of things, because he didn't have the freedom to do that, and he wasn't honest with those people about what he felt while he was there and what he was doing, and when they just that they threatened to excommunicate him, essentially, and so saying, okay, excommunicate me. He went back and it was destructive.  
Matthias Miller  39:04  
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Side note, did they not know where some of our hymns got their music?  
39:17  
No, no, don't bring logic  
39:21  
into it. I forgot that was off the table.  
39:23  
That's off the table. Completely. Do not bring logic into this.  
Matthias Miller  39:34  
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I feel like this is the kind of thing where the most effective thing, you know, what would be great. This is way over guilt for this. But whether it's a, you know, I can see a book like this, I don't want to write. The book. But where it's, here's a here is, it's almost a pick your an adventure like, Okay, what was your last shattering event? ABC, and the, oh, it was this, okay. Then go over to here. So then pick, go to page 17\. Um, what, what was, you know, what was the outcome of, you know, what, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, now go to page 19, and then what did you try? Or, what did you try and, or another example is just simply a book of, like, you know, 16 chapters, and we're just going to pull pages out of the diary of the person who got shut down by the church, the person who experienced the the tragic death, the person who betrayed by business partner, the the and we're going to pull pages out of the diary, and each one ends without a resolution. The only thing you see is the things that they're trying to do to fix it, right?  
41:01  
That  
41:02  
is for the answer, but that's what the  
41:04  
seminar or workshop looks like. What was your glass shattering event? What choices did you make? And then everybody in the room is hearing that, and then this environment of like you get to comment on what their choices were, because everybody in that room but the person speaking can see it really clearly. But the thing that's missing there in most situations is there's a there's a shame component that's in it. What if it was compassion, understanding, knowing within that group, everybody in that group is for that person that is on the hot seat,  
41:50  
yeah, wow, that's The picture.  
41:59  
Because it's not that this knowledge that we're this, this wisdom we're talking about. It's not that it's not out there, but it's missing two things. It's missing community, and it's missing compassion, understanding and love in the midst of that community, for that person as they're walking through this glass shattering event.  
Matthias Miller  42:29  
And the more senior you are in any kind Actually, many of these situation, if you're still anywhere close to the original situation, there is nowhere to turn, like there's nobody you can talk to about this stuff, zero and especially if you're in any kind of leadership capacity.  
42:55  
Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Yeah.  
43:02  
Wow.  
43:06  
So this is a space you can come to,  
43:12  
and you can actually speak what you're thinking and feeling.  
Matthias Miller  43:18  
I had this moment with my so I forget I joined a local, local ish mastermind, and they've got these breakout pods focused on these things. And the first thing was getting to know you, which was like, I don't know. I really suffered from being able to condense my story, my very eclectic story, into a short amount of time, I caught myself saying, making some kind of comment about my bad bosses before me, and I started to correct myself, and the group stopped me, and they're like,  
43:56  
basically, like,  
Matthias Miller  43:59  
they can be bad bosses, like we all know what it's like, right?  
44:04  
Everybody has had that experience.  
Matthias Miller  44:07  
Everybody has had that experience, but it's a miniature version of what you're describing, in which, for myself, personally, so much programming around, defend the protect the reputation of those authority and don't say anything bad about them, right, even if they're not doing things well, right? It's just like a micro, bite sized version of this exact experience. Yeah,  
44:57  
wow, I. Okay, interesting. I  
45:00  
was talking to my spiritual director yesterday, and I was, you know, we're walking through some things. And I was just saying that I was talking about this issue, this how I feel, this issue, this how I feel. And he said, You know what the interesting thing is, like, the conclusions you come to are so utterly simple and yet so profound. And he said, Where did you get that idea or what like that approach, that mindset? And I said, it's Jesus. Everything he says is completely and utterly simple.  
45:47  
Yes,  
45:49  
it's not complex.  
45:52  
No. Love God. Love yourself, love others. Seek Me First what you need to focus on everything else to be taken care of.  
46:03  
These are all simple,  
46:06  
but we take it and we make it complex. Yeah, our egos, our self protection, get involved, and then there has to be a formula. There has to be some sort of calculus, you know, formula that to figure out the complexities of life.  
46:28  
No, it really isn't.  
46:32  
And I think because of the pain involved and our desire to avoid the pain involved, we make it way more complex than it needs to be.  
46:48  
This is  
46:50  
Yes, yes, yes and yes and yes.  
Matthias Miller  47:02  
I don't feel like I've got the same exposure, obviously looking at this through a different lens, but I posted this on Facebook. So one of the one of the messaging that we've been working on has been around the 100 proof version of First of all, my work has been the 100 proof version of me. So stop diluting it with all of these other things. And if you stop diluting it, you get 100 proof. And you know, instead of, like in most leaders, or, you know, maybe they're 40 proofs. So it's more than you know, it's superior, perhaps, but we're not talking 100 proof. And and I made this post last night, how much of this is up until working with Well, I mean, it's been a handful of people who've done this, but up until doing the work, I was always grasping for more and didn't realize that the answer is actually less. So if you just take away the dilution, that's really all it takes. And so I understand a pretty clear picture of what it is for me, but I but it's, I mean, it's, it's this, it's a very similar thing to what you're describing, which is, there's so much noise, so little focus on fundamentals and such a need to Yeah,  
48:53  
let's take let's take the my spiritual director always gives me a hard Time because I'll throw something out there, but then I'll give him five or six caveats around that, like, I'll say this, I'll go, I know that's probably not the right way to think about it, but and all that kind of stuff. And he goes, Why? Why do you follow it up with that? Yeah. And when it boils down to it, I want him to think that I'd considered all of the alternatives. And I if he in protecting myself, if he thinks that it's a bad idea, I want to protect myself by saying I know that's a bad idea. So I and we all do that  
Matthias Miller  49:45  
to one. Instead of just saying, I feel this, yeah,  
49:53  
I dilute it like you're talking about so it goes from 100 proof idea. Okay, and we're not saying healthy, unhealthy, no, this is how I feel. This is the 100 proof version of this. Yes, and then he can have a conversation. We can have a conversation around that, but I do all these caveats to protect myself against the power of this idea. I  
50:31  
and you're  
Matthias Miller  50:38  
not supposed to be you're not supposed to be supposed to be taking these calls to give me stuff that they should be paying attention to  
50:46  
afterwards, forgive me,  
50:56  
put you on some good probation, right? It.  
51:04  
This is, this is the real stuff I'm talking about. Like, within this workshop, it's like, until we actually get the 100 proof thing out there, there is no healing, there is no freedom, there is no moving forward. Do  
Matthias Miller  51:21  
you know what the expansion version of this is, cultural transformation within an organization,  
51:31  
Right? That's it, that.  
51:41  
But it has to be in pods of 10 to 15 people. Beyond that, people will not put the 100 proof out there.  
Matthias Miller  51:56  
But you can start with if you would have a path to to scale. If it is this, it's go. Get the Go, get the executive team in with other executives independently. Have them walk this journey for about 12 months, or whatever it is, get freedom, believe in the results. Then have the executive team do this with them, have them and then just start working your way through the organization, eventually getting to the point where departments are doing this together. Or if it makes sense, I don't know if it makes sense, but choose strata. You know, have like strata across the organization, where I get this guy from marketing, this guy from you know, this engineer, this sales guy, the accountant receptionist, are in the room, and they are, they are having honest conversations and getting to a point where they can then have have these types of Hunter proof conversations with the managers and uplines. Do you know what kind of just ridiculous efficiency you would gain within within a company by doing that? Boom, yep, it's like dynamite man. Yeah,  
53:15  
it really is. It really is cutting the head off the snake. Yeah, instead of doing these manipulative tactics and these team building things which Nobody enjoys, let's go straight to the 100 proof truth of what you're experiencing.  
53:37  
It just  
53:41  
you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.  
Matthias Miller  53:46  
And there's no retribution. There's only curiosity and compassion and and if, and you know that, I think the determining factor ultimately comes the condition for hiring becomes, becomes, are you willing to take steps toward living in a world, a business world without self protective defense mechanisms and and again, nuanced. It's not, are you there or not? And it's not, but it is. Are you willing to adapt and conform into a culture that lives like that? Yeah,  
54:42  
it's like, picture this. This picture just came into mind. So you're sitting with a group of, say, five executives, and one executive within that group is brutally honest. Hate my life, hate my job. Isn't a good fit, that kind of thing. No Exec. Creative at the higher level is going to stand there and say that honestly, so what if we could provide like, what's going on? Like, what is it about life? What is about the job that you don't like? And let's say the outcome is it's just not a good fit. How about we provide you a runway so you can figure out what it is that you do want to do, and we send you away with our blessing. Of this is what it looks like. How transformative would that be in corporate America? Instead of, Oh, you don't like your life, you don't like your job, see ya get out,  
Matthias Miller  55:42  
right? We can't have that because we gotta protect ourselves from somebody who's going to take advantage of us while they're going and looking for something else, right? Instead of how can we make this a mutual by the way, this is fundamentally the issue that I have with this. This is my first job turned into mutual. Self Protection from the from the business side, self protection of we don't believe this person is committed. We're not going to allow this person in the business until they are committed, and so we're going to protect ourselves from a non committed team member. Flip side, it's like, Oh, so you're not going to take care of me. Well, that's pretty clear. So I'm going to, I'm going to have to find something else, because it's not working. And, I mean, there's other dynamics too, you know, not being able to communicate what it is not not, let's just say this, not communicating what it is that I'm really feeling and What I really want. But, yeah, interesting, interesting,  
57:01  
fascinating stuff,  
57:09  
super fascinating.  
57:15  
And I think it's timely, because the corporate model has run its course. It's outlasted usefulness, useful, usefulness, and you have people just dying on the vine,  
57:34  
Stuck i  
57:40  
i want to show you this. What I  
58:06  
this is relevant.  
Matthias Miller  58:09  
Share the so the messaging we've been playing around with, so looking at this is crafted with something targeted on like LinkedIn. Waste your time. How is being the man I could have been? After diluting myself for years, I distilled who I was into 100 group version. This work has changed my life and the leaders I've helped. If this would serve you, let's connect. I'm here for you, and then one of my life pillars is collaborative strategy. It means letting go of chasing outcomes and letting right things emerge that end handing out 15 minute clarity shot calls. My goal is help to draw the approved version of you. Clarity shot has made the three ingredients, clarity on your passport, connection with the authentic self, grace to take the next step. I'll guide the first seven minutes the last eight. You may even want to go deeper in the conversation, tackle a particular problem, share what you're working on. Introduction asks for the referrals for working together, you and I are surrounded by 40 proof leaders. They could be exceptional. They've accepted the average. Let's leave average of that and and crack open the 100th version of you. Would you like to have a clearing shot?  
59:11  
Hmm. I like it. I like it. I  
59:23  
uh, very simple, that's what I'm promising. I get seven minutes. You get eight. We'll see where it goes from there. See where  
Matthias Miller  59:31  
it goes from here. And I love the fact that you know worst case scenario. First of all, I hate the spammy like this is, this is direct confront to, Hey, we should connect and network and see how we can collaborate. Except message number one, pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch like, and I would say I don't really have a good way of maybe these people feel like they're at the top of their game. Do. If all of them will look like they are. The question is, are they willing to is it possible that they're not? And if they're not, are they willing to admit it? Yeah, and, and these are, you know, anyway, so he has legs to it. I'm probably slightly terrified of just taking this and running, yes, but I love it. If  
1:00:26  
you weren't slightly terrified, it wouldn't be worth doing.  
1:00:29  
Well, yeah, yes,  
1:00:39  
that's just say that as an as an anecdotal thing, I say that, like looking back on my life, the things I was slightly or massively terrified of, that I actually went through and followed through, were the most life giving things that have ever happened.  
Matthias Miller  1:01:00  
Well, because, I mean, this is getting philosophical again, but, like, I have to say this on a call with you, but the when you recognize that this is a whole big question, we don't have to get into it, but is safety always a self protective mechanism? Because there are people who genuinely are, are safety oriented? Because that's who and how they need to show up in the world?  
1:01:38  
Yeah. I my answer to that would be, yes, safety is always a self protective measure. And there are times where that is necessary and there are times where that is not, and we have to learn how to discern between the two. I like it.  
Matthias Miller  1:01:56  
And the reason why it's one of the reasons why it's life giving, is it's removing unnecessary self protective measures, yes, and allowing us to fully live.  
1:02:04  
Yeah, if you're  
1:02:06  
walking through the mountains today and a bear shows up on your path, safety and security and self protection, totally legit. Wise idea. Yeah, if you're walking down that same path and you have the thought of a Bear, not a wise self protective moment. Yep.  
1:02:37  
Fair enough.  
1:03:04  
I All right, what else?  
1:03:14  
Think that's enough to process for this session. Yep,  
Matthias Miller  1:03:21  
so I'm in my head. I'm road mapping. How do you communicate this? Who? Who do you? How do you? How do you communicate the invitation? That's the basic thing. And maybe, maybe maybe it could be as simple as a single paragraph, where it's, it's, we're putting together an event. Here's, here's what we here's what we found every every here it is. I don't know if this is it, but it's something like we've been observing the development of leaders for a long time, and we've noticed that there's a pattern and transformation in a leader's life almost always starts with the glass shattering event.  
1:04:26  
It's existential crisis. Existential  
Matthias Miller  1:04:29  
crisis when all of the things you believe to be true come crashing down and all you have is a pile of rubble. And it could look could look like X, Y and Z, but you may have your own thing, and we found that often leaders for leaders, right after that event, there's the there's dealing with the immediate crisis, but as they go forth from that, it's trying to orient your life. Life around what happened? Yes, and what we found is that leaders who successfully navigate this versus leaders who don't come comes down to one thing after the dust is set. You know comes, comes down to their willingness to, I don't know. I kind of want to, I don't know why. I kind of want to believe it as Okay, so the one that how many year period is all doing? They're doing all kinds of things, and at some point there's this second, I don't know what else to call it, like this might be a better term, but there's this second awakening where they realize that all of the stuff that they've been doing still hasn't solved the problem. And we've been working, you've been working, whatever, working with with leaders to actually get to the most fundamental to the to, well, no, I mean, this event is simply for those people. You've had the glass shouting event, you've walked through the crisis, and you've been doing all of the things to try to bring it to resolution, and it still hasn't come to resolution. And if this is you, we'd like to have you here, because it will be I think  
1:06:44  
that's a good place to start.  
1:06:49  
Yeah, cool,  
1:06:53  
yeah. After the shattering, what does it look like to rebuild stronger than you were before?  
1:07:01  
Wow, that's good. That's good.  
Matthias Miller  1:07:17  
That's what they've been trying to do. We just failed at it. So  
1:07:25  
let's get better. So let's  
1:07:26  
get better.  
Matthias Miller  1:07:33  
There's, there's also, I still love the imagery of the seals. Yeah. How do we? How do we? I don't really want to use this this imagery, because it's pretty de honest, and it could be well this spoken or misunderstood. But what is the difference between the traumatized vet that sits at home and whose life crumbles apart, and this the SEAL who went on a on a mission that went sideways and gets back in the game and goes for round two, right? And what I don't like is it really throws the first people under the bus, and there's a lot of stuff that's going on for them, and I don't want to do that,  
1:08:32  
but maybe it's necessary to confront it. Maybe it is this is, maybe this is how you responded. And how did that turn out? I I think it's like the core has to be wisdom gained through pain and suffering.  
Matthias Miller  1:08:51  
But I think, I think you can also be here's where you are. Now look ahead. You can see the person. You can see these two types of people, and you know, the old guy who's this Ziggy, like, whatever the right term is, grouch, who's, you know, TechEd the world and, and Nobody wants to be around him. And his story ended. And, you know, even though he tried to, you know, he was doing this, that, or the other, history ended. Then there's this other guy. He's the sage. He's sitting there, he's walked through it. He's actually better for he's healthier for it. And this, this moment, is a decision point in let's fast forward, 2040, 60 years from now, which, which of these is going to be you.  
1:10:02  
Which one do you want?  
1:10:05  
Which one do you want? That's fair. Which one do you want?  
1:10:10  
Because you get to choose,  
1:10:12  
and you're sitting here today tells me that you don't want option A. You actually want option B, but you're afraid. Yeah, yeah, so let's face that fear together. Yeah, it's what I'm offering you. Yeah,  
1:10:37  
good feeling you're crazy.  
1:10:38  
I am. I readily admit it, and I'm sure this isn't shocking to you, you're not the first person that said that.  
Matthias Miller  1:10:52  
Yes, it's it's a good thing. I'm sitting down, Kevin,  
1:10:58  
I love it. She i Alright,  
1:11:07  
let's, let's look at our calendars. Yes. Can we do this again?  
Matthias Miller  1:11:15  
So I've got a early mornings Tuesday, and I mean, Monday, anytime from six Pacific up until however late you want to  
1:11:30  
go, Yeah, let's, uh, let's do six Pacific on Monday.  
1:11:35  
Okay, how much time do you want to block out of that  
1:11:37  
conversation? Um, I feel like we're getting deeper. So let's block out at least an hour and a half  
1:11:45  
if you've got that amount of time. Oh yeah, yeah, let's block that,  
1:11:51  
okay, and then if it goes I don't have anything directly after that, if it goes longer than that, great. Yeah. Uh,  
Matthias Miller  1:12:05  
yeah. I mean, I blocked out my Monday and Wednesday mornings because those are about the only mornings at work. So just that way, nothing gets nothing gets scheduled. On top of it, perfect. So good, awesome. Good stuff, man. I'm excited. I'm thinking this other, this other guy, can also help, help some with,  
1:12:27  
I mean, he, he's, there's a  
Matthias Miller  1:12:31  
lot of stuff. He's on the same page on So, I mean, obviously, different background, different sources, but I think you'll be able to help us, too with messaging. I'm pretty excited about that.  
1:12:39  
The more the merrier. The more  
1:12:42  
the merrier, Thanksgiving. All right, man, you too.  
1:12:45  
Bye. All right. You.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
01:07  
I uh, opinion  
Matthias Miller  01:28  
about how to go about this. I think the intersection of almost everything that we Want to do comes down to  
01:54  
let's see I'm  
02:03  
uh, sorry, um,  
Matthias Miller  02:16  
if I had to Start with a group of people, I would start with  
02:30  
CEOs of  
Matthias Miller  02:34  
the upper End of small sized, blue collar ish types of businesses.  
02:44  
I like that,  
Matthias Miller  02:46  
and so my thought is, it's been a while since I've done anything like this on this kind of a whim,  
02:57  
but a friend of mine  
Matthias Miller  02:59  
has been doing micro podcasts, or micro episodes to get people on on a call. You shoot the interview 10, even just 1015, minutes. It gets put out on the podcast. They get to share it with their friends. You build all the process around that, and then it opens up the door for conversation, so you have the tagline on it, on the podcast, and the tagline can the biggest variable that can't change is the people that you're working with, because you're building a community in a tribe. Well, I mean, or you have to go start another podcast, which is very doable. You can absolutely do that, right? But then on the on the podcast, you can talk about, here's what I like about it. It gives me a playground I can do consulting, kind of strategy, fractional CFO operations, kind of consulting. And it's basically the pitch is, if it's manufacturing, it might really work anywhere in this niche. It's, you know, get your business to run like a well oiled machine, which is this playground over here. And then there's the playground of, I'm also thinking of a down sell into a community of something like $1,000 a year,  
04:53  
and  
Matthias Miller  04:55  
just having the down down sell into the community. Should be able to liquidate a bunch of the marketing costs of outreach and you have and these people can then be served by monthly newsletters, and you know, all of those types of things. And then you also start building a list of people that you've ever had on the podcast, whether they've bought or not. And now you have an audience to communicate with, and you can invite them in different directions. And so if it becomes clear and working with somebody so so it allows various things like giving memberships, giving members, like hosting virtual samplers of what we're looking to do, both to members and non members. It would be possible to have member versus non member pricing if we want to do that. And once we've done virtual samplers, it is the option of doing in person events and have actually have a an audience of people who would be looking for these types of types of things. And my premise is, rightly or wrongly, but my premise is that these are the salt of the earth people.  
06:44  
It's broad brush strokes. But  
Matthias Miller  06:51  
the big thing that keeps people out of the trades, keeps young people ego, ego in that logic is what keeps most, most young people out of the trades these days, in my opinion, considering the rising demand and that there really is a lot of opportunity in that space, because nobody wants wants it. What are, what are? You know, I'm driving, driving to the office and thinking, Well, what's Kevin's concern going to be? Well, is the podcast debate and switch? So that's a question, or is it a genuine conversation and a genuine opportunity to engage deeper, right?  
07:47  
Yeah, the first question for me is, and I hear you, I'm following you, just working out the details. First question is, how does this align with the overall premise that we have of union and knowing and being known? Does this get us closer to that goal? I  
08:28  
That's a fair question. I don't know how to answer that.  
08:38  
Yeah, and not that, not that you would have an answer in this moment. But can we explore you an answer, right and Talk through to a point? I  
09:20  
What  
09:22  
would have to be true  
09:28  
about a venture experiment, something?  
Matthias Miller  09:39  
So it seems to me that if the podcast that 10 to 15 minutes isn't sufficient,  
09:59  
it. Okay,  
Matthias Miller  10:08  
for the goal to be union and knowing and being known, there has to be a fractal nature to it, such that there's a union in knowing and being known in every part of the process is people get to know us. So the podcast, a 10 to 15 minute podcast, can't do that. A 45 minute podcast  
10:47  
can get closer  
10:51  
a season could hit the mark  
Matthias Miller  11:02  
With an individual or set of individuals,  
11:16  
that's interesting.  
Matthias Miller  11:22  
I was thinking about it this morning in the shower, I did my little laser two hour, whatever, flyby shooting session with the guy, and gave him a lot of really good insights. And I'm sure this doesn't surprise you what he said. I mean, he came back and he's like, I really have no like, I'm trying. I can't think how to improve upon it. But he's like, I had to go back and listen to it, and  
11:55  
I had to,  
Matthias Miller  12:00  
I had to take a look at different words, my attachment to my identity, that what I'd been building, because It was seemed logical, but it wasn't. And there's every market has  
12:27  
crack  
Matthias Miller  12:30  
and every market has in the same market has cure.  
12:35  
And  
12:38  
what's the difference between the two? I shoot.  
Matthias Miller  12:51  
Well, crack is a fix me.  
12:58  
It's like, how come? It's like alchemy, right? The whole thing about alchemy was to turn lead into gold. It was a subverting of the process. It's a lack of patience,  
13:17  
right?  
13:20  
I think that's the difference, is patience and process.  
13:33  
Yes,  
Matthias Miller  13:44  
it makes us too very interesting individuals to be working on a project like this together. Do you  
13:51  
think that's become very apparent? Um, um,  
14:04  
it's like two missionaries standing on a hill looking down into this village. The younger one, the older one, the younger one says, let's run down there and convert them all, or convert some of them. The other one says, how about we walk down and  
14:24  
convert them all.  
14:39  
So I  
Matthias Miller  14:48  
so So imagine you had a series of maybe five different people and.  
15:00  
Times,  
Matthias Miller  15:06  
five different episodes.  
15:22  
Is it done in the group?  
15:34  
Gut feeling is there would almost have to be both. There would have to be individual, and then there would have to be group  
15:47  
are the same people In the same ones.  
15:58  
You almost have to be i  
Matthias Miller  16:07  
so that means you then have a so you have a season, you still have to have, you have some kind of selection process. I  
16:25  
yes and no, yes and God, selecting them, no, and we're selecting them. I  
Matthias Miller  16:49  
in the god selecting them. Is this a i Here's a list of people. I think we should invite that guy, that guy, that guy,  
17:09  
and  
Matthias Miller  17:16  
we are the gatekeepers. Or is this a i There was a sower who went out to sow, and he throws through seed everywhere. And this guy, this burly, smelly, loudmouth guy, comes stumbling into the darkens the the door of the building and throws things into disarray and walkable, yep,  
17:50  
okay, yes,  
17:54  
that's the dream. And  
17:58  
then he's like, I don't know why I'm here, but I just felt like, I don't know.  
18:05  
And my response would be, I don't know why you're here either, but let's find out.  
18:09  
Yes, that's awesome, man. So  
Matthias Miller  18:18  
selection process, and then it's like a there could be something like a kickoff. Well, is it a? There's any number of ways to structure this. It could be a one on one call with everybody. No, I mean, it could be a kickoff call with everyone. Kickoff group call and like, I one individual with everyone. Middle group call, one individual with everyone. The final call, NPS, at the end of this, really, guys, do you want to keep this going?  
19:06  
And here's why wouldn't we?  
19:14  
This is a lot of episodes in a season.  
19:22  
There is a this comes to mind. There's a podcast that I've listened to for a number of years that I really like, and I'm trying to look at the name right now. I  
19:47  
uh, Hardcore History, okay, have you ever heard of this? The guy named Dan Carlin, one  
Matthias Miller  19:58  
of my friends, my one of my friends. Has been talking about three hour podcast episodes, yeah, of history, and probably this or something very similar,  
20:07  
probably some, yeah, probably very similar. But this is the best one I've seen, and it's like 40 hours of content in a season. Like he goes into the stuff, like, it's deep  
20:24  
and  
20:27  
like, that's what I envision, like This epic journey with this group of people.  
20:41  
I Hmm, so then, if this is the podcast,  
21:22  
I mean, the paid thing can just be A natural Well, I don't know what it is. I  
21:51  
if we just start there,  
21:55  
just with the group,  
22:00  
and let Whatever happens organically happen.  
22:16  
So recruit, invite, 12 people is it 12? Because it's four  
22:27  
in this format, I think it might be better to have it be smaller.  
Matthias Miller  22:37  
Well, keep in mind that we're we're going to be attracting people who really love to vocalize themselves.  
22:43  
Yeah, exactly. And that's, that's what, honestly, that's what you want, is people love to hear their voice, because they'll give you all the material you need. Oh, man.  
23:05  
Well, and it can be very  
23:07  
dude.  
Matthias Miller  23:10  
This is next level, because this is the kind of thing. I'm not planning to sell it like this, because I hate doing it and I hate what let me fix my thought. I hate what people do with it. But this is the kind of thing that the marketing world would absolutely eat up if you put this in a little box and said, Go, use it. I have a friend of mine who's done opsi types of stuff for years. She went into I was part of a coaching program, spent a lot of money with them. In my environment felt very toxic. I felt like Holy Spirit wanted me there. I don't know if it was right or wrong. Lost a lot of money, nothing to show for it. She had worked there the year prior to me showing up, year two, a year or two prior to me showing up, she said it was one of the most that the culture the company was one of the most toxic companies she's ever worked for, and the owner, working for the owner, having having having him as her boss was one of the most traumatic things she ever experienced, which is why I have another friend of mine who's been consulting with corporations on AI took a little foray into the internet marketing, digital business world, only to have all of his IP blatantly, no attempt to hide, ripped off, copied and resold, at which point he said, I'm done. I'm out of here. It's. It.  
25:06  
Have we shown you this?  
25:09  
Yes, yeah.  
Matthias Miller  25:12  
Also, another side note, somebody told me I need to update my LinkedIn profile, because age equals wisdom, especially in this light. You know, there's this white glow. But clearly, wife doesn't my wife doesn't like if I wait for more than a week to cut my hair because of it, but I still figure it serves me well, of  
25:43  
course it does. She here's, here's my thought, like I've always been intrigued by, I'm sure this is probably shocking, by the trailblazer, by the trendsetter, by the iconoclast, a good friend of mine. He, his father was the founder and developer of Callaway golf clubs. And he, he does Callaway. Callaway Corvettes makes carbon fiber like post production modifications on cars. I was sitting and talking with him one day, and he was talking about his his father's process, and his father's process was, I set the trend, I design. I take what's up here and turn it into something real, and everybody else can follow along, and they can copy, and they can feed down the chain. But I do what I do, and it is never discounted, and I love that. I don't care if people want to imitate what we're doing right? Because they're not us  
Matthias Miller  27:07  
well, and this is the boob that there is a shift that I think we're seeing in the world and in marketing and in business,  
27:15  
where  
Matthias Miller  27:18  
personal brands are becoming more meaningful, but and the thing that can't be replicated? Well, I mean, Kevin, technically, if we used a lab, we could probably get a 60% approximation of you by forcing somebody through a series of experiences and education, but it wouldn't have the same quality and individuals are when you really consider the variables between genetics and personality and experience and choice and almost impossible to replicate, yeah, um. All right, so here's my proposal for next steps. I spent some money on this thing because I was like he was offering discount on the first five people, and I kind of did a gut check and said, basically, screw it. Why not? He's willing to work with with I can actually bring you in on these calls. There's no reason why not to figure out what's the podcast title? They'll put together a website. They'll put together scripting help us get the first 10 guests. And Yeah, he'll probably disagree with the idea of doing long form.  
28:58  
But I  
Matthias Miller  29:10  
uh, from a personal standpoint, pragmatic, cash driven standpoint, what I like about the the micro podcast episodes is that there is a shorter pathway, still looking at the my monthly burn and looking for me to replicate it. Maybe this is impatience. Maybe it's pragmatic problem solving. What I like about having some form of micro podcast and using that to get to get maybe a handful of fractional clients who can help. I. Provide some core financial stability while this thing develops and evolves.  
30:22  
I let's take all of that and put it on the shelf for a second. Okay, what does your gut say? Do  
31:11  
I don't know if this is good or not,  
Matthias Miller  31:20  
but this has come with such an urge to build like I finally found a people, and I finally Found a thing that I can do for them. I  
33:08  
The gut check for me is, is this a Divine we process, or is this a me process? I  
33:20  
I think that's  
33:24  
the question we have to ask every step as we move forward. Is this partnership with the Holy Spirit, or is this me pushing it forward? I  
35:08  
How do I know I  
35:35  
I fit in with The character of God, maybe, as I explore that question, it's Not about knowing, it's about Feeling, it's  
35:56  
about faith. It's  
36:45  
feeling, What  
36:53  
feeling, the knowing and  
37:04  
there's this thing in front of me that I feel so compelled to do, and yet it scares me, and yet I still want to do it. I still feel compelled towards it. I  
37:31  
am I in Union? In this situation?  
37:42  
I think inevitably, if that's the case, we're gonna be somewhat, at least in the beginning, somewhat alone, somewhat just me and God out here in this desert. And that's scary  
38:04  
until it's not.  
38:19  
June I'm both have had millions of ideas that have come and gone over the years. Could be this thing, could be this thing, could be this thing, whatever. And then there's been those ones that have just stuck. They've stood the test of time despite any effort on our part to dive into them, to keep them alive, To whatever. It's still there. Yeah.  
39:02  
Can we honor that I  
40:24  
What are the  
40:34  
this is the patience and process I'm talking about that counteracts our impulsivity to allow the process to play out and  
Matthias Miller  41:55  
so recurring themes For myself, I  
42:34  
I've been a  
Matthias Miller  42:37  
working with business owners at a strategic level. I  
42:47  
and it's been B, I,  
Matthias Miller  43:13  
helping people understand themselves so that they can align the work that they do with who they are. I it's not clear to me whether the latter interest is actually inherent or if it's just vicariously solving for the problem I can't solve for myself. If there's any that falls into that category, this is the closest  
43:52  
The other  
Matthias Miller  43:54  
thing that's almost like a second nature, I think I if you think of me as a machine in Business  
44:15  
or as a lung  
Matthias Miller  44:21  
breathe in and breathe out, input, output. If you give me business problems, I will show you what system needs to be put in place to prevent that from happening again. And if the system doesn't work, can you tell me why? I will tell you how you need to amend the system so the system actually bends to the needs of the business. If you look at this as a relationship, in most times, I am the voice. Choice for the system that can negotiate with humans so that the system, if you will, can know and be known. It's a weird analogy, but I've become aware that I have much more. I have a multi dimensional in some cases, I don't know that it's fully organic, But life form like view of organization and structure, I  
46:29  
that who You've been or who you Are.  
46:39  
I I think the really intriguing thing  
47:41  
you're becoming,  
47:44  
not who you were. And  
48:13  
so tell me if this is what you're talking about.  
Matthias Miller  48:18  
A call yesterday, group call. Was it mastermind. I signed up for it for 2024 which not even sure if I should have been, been in the should have signed up, not. But anyway, it's paid for.  
48:37  
This guy spends 45 minutes talking about  
Matthias Miller  48:46  
the business that he's in and tired of being on a two legged stool. There's always one life that's being compromised. And there are really four of us on the call. One guy jumps in with a few questions and observations halfway through, and then finally, towards the end, I interrupted,  
49:09  
because that was the only way that  
Matthias Miller  49:14  
anything was going to happen, right? And I had like, this is always how I work. We got like, you know, say something like, I've got, you know, four different questions thoughts for you and lay them out. Oh, well, actually, there were six. So there's the other two. And like, these are things. These are questions that are worth exploring, things that are worth considering,  
49:46  
at which point he says,  
Matthias Miller  49:51  
winds it down a bit. It says, Yeah, that's exactly what he needed to hear.  
49:58  
But there's this i.  
Matthias Miller  51:07  
The pragmatic question is, what is the bridge?  
51:12  
Do I cut deeper?  
51:15  
Do I continue the burn? I  
51:26  
What is Your gutsy I  
Matthias Miller  55:15  
What is your opinion about larger community?  
55:20  
Okay, in one sense,  
Matthias Miller  55:24  
of these people, this tribe, this group,  
55:31  
where  
Matthias Miller  55:39  
just literally is about proximity with each other, and maybe one or two events a month that are specifically around. Obviously, if you have 40 people, I don't know, you can't go super deep, or maybe you cap them, maybe you cap them, and you have number of events is x divided by y, where total membership divided by most people on a call. But it's a, it is not a. It is not a it is an Ezekiel dip your toes in the water community. And yes, there are probably people there who are just there for business, just there to connect with each other, but you're giving them an opportunity to be in the same room. And even if it's on a superficial level, not superficial. I mean, even if it's just ankle deep, here's what I'm working on, here's who I'd like to connect with. Who do you know, who can help me with?  
57:00  
How can we partner together to move this? How can  
Matthias Miller  57:02  
we partner together with this forward? So if we do something like this, I'm looking at it for myself, yeah, covering the marketing, covering my covering, paying a mortgage, if, if I have a flow of 20 people each month as an example, and half of them opt into this community, then, then we have the foundation, then, and then you need to engage. You can Okay, now this is starting to get really interesting. Imagine if you had this community, and I had a list of names and cell phone numbers, and I wake up in the morning, and whether it's me or God or Holy Spirit or any random combination, I pick a name and I dial it and Hey, what's up? What's going on? Like, how are you doing? I don't know if I would have the do. Discipline for it. I don't know if it would even work, but it has the makings of a very interesting way to engage with these people, and I'm not worried about holding the cards to my chest,  
58:38  
because they're paying members. I And there isn't this expectation  
Matthias Miller  58:54  
that's not even included in the expectation of what they're getting. All they really want is to being a tribe of people that they can connect with on a professional level. And so this is just bonus time. So I don't have any any expectation, apart from podcast stuff, perhaps, or other group stuff. But I've got minimal expectation about needing to show up here at this time for this, like the time at this level, it can be extremely organic.  
59:34  
I like the idea of a larger community, and my my feeling about the larger community is it creates a it almost goes back to the book of Acts, where it creates a system of support and resource and encouragement and belonging. Right? Everything at church was supposed to be  
1:00:09  
well and ultimately  
Matthias Miller  1:00:12  
at at one or two grand a year. So my thought, my thought is, I think it's very, very feasible  
1:00:21  
through the podcast to enroll, okay, I  
Matthias Miller  1:00:28  
to enroll. You can enroll quite a few people in a month. And and one to two grand a year is a very feasible number. And if you want to compare it to church, it is a form of  
1:00:53  
tithe. If you want to call it that,  
Matthias Miller  1:00:59  
I like the idea of belonging. It's almost like,  
1:01:06  
here's the analogy.  
Matthias Miller  1:01:09  
I have this little office that I have that has the brick wall and the custom clock and the water dispenser, because I want to drink a lot of water and I want to stake them on calls a lot, and my flip chart and my coffee table and my speakers and my cabinet that I can hide everything in and not have it right, atrocious. And then there's my desk that needs to be cleaned up. I mean, it doesn't look bad, but, you know, but it's, it's been structured in shape to look and feel like home. And maybe this is the Starbucks of maybe the pod podcast is the public, public home, the social gathering. Maybe the round table is the living room, private living room, home. Maybe the group membership is the Starbucks, the bridge between business and home, the the in between the space. And so what would it look like to have this community look like,  
1:02:31  
feel like,  
Matthias Miller  1:02:35  
be, like a home. Is it complete? No, it can't be. But there's a set, there's there's a okay, if I actually lean into this, there is a set of emotions that I want to evoke when people come into the community, come into the space. I one  
1:03:01  
of  
Matthias Miller  1:03:06  
belonging, one of these are my people.  
1:03:20  
What are your thoughts?  
1:03:25  
I like it. It's getting closer.  
1:03:30  
What feels off to you?  
1:03:33  
Nothing necessarily feels off. It's almost like a you know, I need some time to process through it,  
1:03:46  
because I like it. I like that idea of home. This home is not a place or a location, it's a it's an experience within relationship. And so creating a helm experience of relationship, you  
Matthias Miller  1:04:15  
know, what I would really like is, rather than me chase these people down is just to say I am. If this is home, I'm your brother, you can call Yes, you got a business problem. Got something tactical, you got something in tech? I don't. I might, I might have a good answer. I might not. I probably know some people, you need somebody to just verbally process and dialog with. You need Yes, I mean, and whatever. I don't care. Just call. Just pick up the phone and call. And my primary recurring. Your message is, stop doing it alone. Just pick up the phone and call. I am here for you. Yes, but once again, let's talk about pressure. I'm not being pressured to perform, to to show up and like and to show up and make sure everybody gets their phone call, and everybody meets the program expectations and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the only thing I hear is pounding it time and time and time and time again. And I would love to, if I have this, it means I have space and I have content. I would love to go back to a monthly written newsletter that these people get that's process and digest conversations and and and the show and the like, all this stuff, and what I'm experiencing and like, it can be completely random. It's just It doesn't have to be. I can talk about the the call. I mean, like, it can be as crazy as a picture of rhodian slippers, like,  
1:06:07  
great, whatever, right?  
Matthias Miller  1:06:12  
And people can pick and choose in that there is the reminder, pick up the phone and call, text me, or, you know, in whatever level of involvement you want, and and then, and then, from there, it's a by the way, we're taking applications for a new show or new season, not applications, but, well, I mean, it is applications. We're not telling them that they're basically de facto accepted. Or maybe we are, but, but would you like to join us and on the back end of the season, in the final call, and maybe even a POST call the post there can be one call after the final episode, which is a well, where do we go from here? What do you guys want? And let that emerge. And and they will, they will tell us, man, like, we have to have these. Okay, well, it's really good. Like, how often? What is it worth to you guys? What would you pay? And they'll, they'll put the entire thing to put together. And we really don't have to do anything except decide, are we willing to abide, you know, to follow through with whatever it is that they're asking of us. And if the answer is yes, we have a deal, and they're already pre sold, right? If you want to talk about pre selling, i The community has a lot of, there you go. That's That's ripping a whole lot of German and Protestant work ethic and Anabaptist, legalistic, jumping through hoops out of the picture. Yep, yeah, I could get really, really excited about that. Yeah, with some of those tweaks. So then, if I have another question for you, what are your thoughts about a micro podcast that leads into the community, and the community leads into the what doesn't even have to be a micro podcast that leads into we don't we really don't care if we have openings for the macro podcast. Then it leads into the macro podcast. Either way, it also leads into the community. What do you think of having micro podcasts in the front end as as a way to get people into the invite people into the community,  
1:09:10  
as a way to introduce the concept,  
Matthias Miller  1:09:13  
introduce the concept. And I would think that the way it's branded, the way it's labeled somewhere, there's this thread running through the whole thing, but it's an introduction to the concept. It's a it's a set of a few very simple questions that help start to unpack something that's within them. Yeah, and, and,  
1:09:52  
the thing that strikes me is there's an investigation here. There's an exploration. Who I am, what I feel, what I think. And the promise is not that I will give you answers. The promise is I will walk with you as you explore. I will be with you as you walk through this. That's what's really exciting to me. I'm sick of the answer, guys, I'm sick of being one. I'm sick of the playing of the The Answer Guy, within community, within the world, within churches, I'm sick of that. What I commit to you is to walking with you through whatever comes as a community, and that's the pledge that the community makes to each other.  
Matthias Miller  1:10:51  
Every part of me just wants to run with the UN mastermind brand.  
1:10:57  
They say every part, yeah, this  
Matthias Miller  1:10:59  
is totally the, this is totally the screw you guru, yeah. Anyway, I don't like negatively positioning it against something else, because it positions it against something else, which means it kind of is positioned as something else in the process. But it's almost like the blue collar belonging. Yes,  
1:11:28  
it really is a substitute for the bar. Every day after work, I go hang out at the bar, I have a few beers, I talk to the people who are always at the bar, and there's no, there's no, but there it's a wallowing in your issues, your problems. Here, this is no. We're with you. We're walking through it, but we're walking through it. We're not wallowing. And it's almost like a replacement for the bar. Yeah, uh, or the CrossFit club, or whatever it is that,  
1:12:07  
or the church club, yeah,  
1:12:10  
the the running club, or the the church Bible study, the home group, whatever. No, no, this is just, we are here to walk through this with you,  
1:12:22  
man.  
1:12:28  
And the tagline is, you don't need to be fixed. You need to be known. You  
1:12:43  
that's good.  
1:12:46  
I know. Just kidding I said that,  
1:12:57  
screaming it into my ear from the time I was 13\. I can't take credit for it.  
Matthias Miller  1:13:05  
I have a cousin who grew up in an abusive, really abusive home. God spoke to her recently, and he's like, you know your grandma from the non abusive side of your family who showed Jesus to you and taught you to love the earth and all things in it, you would never have had the experience to have gotten to know her if you had been part of any other family. And then she said she's been sending me texts like non stop for the last 24 hours. She's like nobody ever told me I just experienced the love of Jesus. Everybody has been talking about grace and living by grace, and no idea that this is what they were talking about. And her entire world has been turned upside down.  
1:14:01  
To be fair, those people who are preaching about grace and mercy and compassion, they didn't know what they were talking about either.  
Matthias Miller  1:14:10  
I told her the story of West Stafford, who was in Africa and his kids were dying and his friends were dying. Then he comes to the US and sees this pharmacy full of medicine and vaccines and gets angry at the world because of these selfish people. And it was like most people don't have the opportunity to live and experience both sides, but you did, and there's no pressure for you to do anything with it, but is, it's interesting, and it's an invitation,  
1:14:48  
come and see,  
1:14:50  
Come and see. I love the bar.  
1:14:57  
Yeah, or I don't know if I've said this to you before, but. So, a writer, I forget his name, early, 2000s  
1:15:07  
God, what is his name? Doesn't matter.  
1:15:11  
He writes a letter to mother, Teresa, saying how much he admires her and wants to, you know, know how she does what she does, you know, like this long letter, and she responds with a very short response. And she essentially says, Come and see, come and experience it. No, he does. There is no substitute for come and see.  
1:15:42  
Yes,  
1:15:45  
the Christian experience, by and large in our world today, is all theoretical, conceptual knowledge, but there's very little come and see.  
Matthias Miller  1:15:58  
Oh, and by the way, the line, the the belief that was pushed on me as a kid, which I resented and disbelieved, because the longer I went, the more flawed it became, was you can't trust experience. You can only trust the word of God like really, yeah, emotions in particular are suspect, right? Can't trust emotions. Emotions will mislead you, yeah, which makes you really easy to control, by the way, serves the system well. I mean, I should try that sometime, right? Because how I push push against your system, and let's see how emotions are not controlling you and are not trustworthy.  
1:16:53  
I don't know. Let's get an object lesson here. Yeah,  
1:16:59  
that really sounds like a good, productive, you know, no, whatever, yeah. End of rambles.  
1:17:07  
No, it's, it's, yeah, I mean, there's, we have substituted experience for intellectual ascent. So intellectually assent to the fact that Jesus died for me, and he's my Savior, and all those kind of things awesome. It's absolutely necessary to at some point intellectually assent to that. But what about the experience of it? Right? And if I'm so interested in my comfort and my safety, I'm never going to put myself in a position where I can experience Him as Savior.  
1:17:59  
Dude. He  
Matthias Miller  1:18:19  
so would you be open this podcast guy might be in for a surprise to having a chat with us, together with me, and the podcast guy about titling and yeah, okay, source, but by and large, you're comfortable. So if, if, if we have a title that's framed around, you don't need to be fixed, you need to be known, union, know and be known. And we have a micro podcast format that is a taster of that fractal in nature, a community that is a place of belonging for that, again, bite sized, ankle deep. And then we have a six seasons and shows which are knee deep, and then we have cohorts that at some point are full on immersion, ie drowning, or, you know, whatever you want to call the experience. Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, I could get extremely excited about this community thing for two  
1:19:56  
decades. Okay?  
1:19:58  
Well. I  
1:20:04  
don't know what looked like. I didn't know what the manifestation was. Podcast didn't even exist at that point. But  
1:20:14  
there's something here. Oh my goodness, something I can spend my I could actually, I  
Matthias Miller  1:20:24  
could actually spend my life talking to people, yeah,  
1:20:29  
shocker, right,  
1:20:32  
knowing people, being known by people, and as somebody who's done it for 30 years, there's nothing more rewarding, but also nothing more painful.  
1:20:48  
What's the painful part?  
1:20:51  
The disconnection, the refusal to be known?  
1:20:58  
Yeah, the wall anger, the  
1:21:00  
frustration the walls. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  1:21:04  
a friend of mine, closer closer to mine. He's been on a separate therapy journey and nice year accident. I stepped into his life. We'd kind of been friends before, back and forth, but really said into into his life as he was going through his divorce, as a Mennonite, which is its own story.  
1:21:32  
How's that for? Contradiction?  
Matthias Miller  1:21:35  
Doctrinal, dogma, but we  
1:21:42  
were talking last night,  
Matthias Miller  1:21:47  
he met this individual who made some kind of weird comment, and he's like, you know, gut check flashing red lights. Come to find out that this individual group and in a horribly abusive cult, like home group, home school, big family, abusive, domestic, sexually abusive environment. But has largely walled off and well walled off everything that happened, and there's no I we were talking about all the folks that from where we've come from,  
1:22:52  
who've stayed stuck and  
Matthias Miller  1:22:59  
and who've become who just accepted or out of fear or whatever they choose, to  
1:23:08  
dance with the Dragon for fear of  
Matthias Miller  1:23:13  
the devil, they'll be nose but I think last night, it was really last night. It occurred to me in our conversation. Never occurred to me, this to me before, but I really did Escape. I  
1:23:46  
a powerful statement,  
Matthias Miller  1:24:01  
if only people could understand truly what's on the other side of knowing and being known and of walking through the fear. And it's baffling to me sometimes, why? Two wise the why I used to ask myself was, why did I not get out sooner, like some of my colleagues and friends? But then I look at some of the people who did leave sooner, and my question is, why did I keep going when they stopped? I  
1:24:44  
important questions.  
Matthias Miller  1:24:52  
Anyway, just the start of a Wednesday, I.  
1:25:00  
It Wednesday in October.  
1:25:03  
Wednesday in October.  
Matthias Miller  1:25:06  
Um, all right. Well, let me get with let me get with this. This guy said it could be a couple days before he gets back. Let me get with him. And let's and I'll see about getting a time set up. They might even shoot him a little message, actually, let me do this. Let me take five to 10 minutes now just shoot, put together a little outline of what we talked about and what this thing might look like, perfect, and send it over to you. And you can mull over it. It's also something I could send over to him to take a look at it. Sounds good. Okay, Thanksgiving. All right, my friend, talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.

Matthias Miller  
00:11  
Hey, Kevin,  
00:20  
there we go. Now I'm here,  
00:24  
all right, and now my  
00:29  
bluetooth is  
00:33  
not behaving.  
00:39  
We go, good,  
00:41  
good. Got it? Okay,  
00:48  
man, good morning. How are you? I'm  
00:54  
here that  
00:59  
remains to be seen. Remains to be seen. Let's  
01:01  
put it to the test. By the end of the day,  
01:05  
right? Had a great conversation with Arlen. What's the Thursday of last week? After we had our miscommunications and great conversation.  
01:20  
Cool.  
01:23  
Yeah, yeah, how he's he said, you guys kind of know each other peripherally, like it was almost kind of a, like, he he knew your sister, and then, you know that kind of thing, yeah. Wow. Isn't amazing how God moves and works.  
01:43  
Yeah, it is. It really is.  
01:48  
Yeah, yeah.  
01:55  
Good. Glad  
01:55  
to hear he was very eager to  
01:59  
connect. So, yeah, yeah,  
02:04  
yeah. He's in a very similar position that I actually find quite, quite a few people are in currently. It's like, I've done this my whole life, not really. I don't feel fulfilled, I don't feel alive, I don't, you know, those kind of things. Where do I go next? What does the second half of life look like? It's an increasingly more apparent circumstance in our world, or at least in my world, interesting. A lot of the conversations I'm having are along those lines,  
02:43  
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I  
02:52  
think it's a good thing if,  
02:58  
if the spiritual directors and the psychologists are correct, each of us hits a point like that, somewhere between 30 and 60, and We just find ourselves in the dark night of the soul, like, where do I go from here? I spent my whole life building this whole thing, and it's not producing what I thought it would produce, and I kind of don't want to do it anymore. So where do I go from here?  
03:40  
What? What what do you call that when you've had some variation of that for your whole life, right?  
03:46  
I I would call you blessed, almost like the whole time God was like, maybe that's not the path, but you have free will. So he keeps going down this path and he keeps going. Have you tried this one? Let me try this one. Have you tried this one?  
04:13  
I had a very interesting conversation with a friend of mine. He used to be a positional pastor at a church, and he resigned, and he made a comment about how many pastoral doors have opened up now that he's left pastoring.  
04:39  
Yeah,  
04:41  
it's funny I was we listened or we watched church yesterday morning, either one of us were feeling well, so we kind of stayed at home. And for the first time in a very long time, I heard a pastor say he compared. This. He's like, you know, when you, when you you've got internet service at home, and you call because it's got kind of expensive and they try and bundle everything else with the service. He made this analogy. He's like, that's what we've done with the gospel. We've taken the the pure, simple message, and we've bundled all sorts of other things onto it. And how about we just go back to the pure, simple message. I was like, wow, somebody's saying this.  
05:35  
Are you gonna have a job after this? Yeah, exactly,  
05:38  
yeah. I have expected him to be fired on the spot.  
05:45  
I've had a fascinating call with a friend of a friend of mine, and he's all into this kingdom business thing, and asked me how he got started in it. And he's like, Well, I saw all of these billionaires, and I realized that world hunger could be solved with just a fraction that what they're making. And I'm just like, the whole way through the call I was, I've been, I've been cursed with perspectives from this guy who I just had to question. It's like, okay, so they're the problem, right? And if and he's, he keeps and the church is the problem, because the church doesn't teach kingdom, and kingdom is about the government of God. So just like, Okay, so we're going to take, we're going to displace this government for this other government, government, which sounds to me like a political move, which is kind of what Jesus told his disciples not to do, like, like, what am I? What? What are we missing here? I mean,  
06:56  
it's almost, it's so enveloped in our nature, like we see a problem, we acknowledge a problem, and we rail against the problem, and then almost subconsciously, we recreate the problem over here. Like, what is that in us? Hey, because, because we can recognize the problem, and it's probably because it's personally affected us, right? That's that's why we recognize it, and we got to do it differently, but then we end up just recreating the problem over here. What is it about that makes us do that? I I  
07:56  
mean, it probably requires some questions as to, why was it a problem in the first place, being done with this later, but I've had some very interesting conversations around my personality, my perceived personality, etc.  
08:14  
And  
08:17  
isn't it true that most of us find well, many of the problems that we face is because there is some power that is greater than ourselves that's at odds with something that we value, and and so Our natural response, then is, well, this is important, therefore I will use power to make sure that people respect the importance of this, and I won't be put into this kind of a position again, in which case it then becomes, I mean, Well, then that's, that's where it's a repeating cycle. And we use whatever means we've we've adapted so it might mean, you know, three basic patterns. One is anarchy. So let's overthrow the government. Let's ever throw this power number two, subvert. So let's, let's manipulate our way into the existing system and try to infect the systems that changes. And then number three is, oh, well, let's just break free. It's like the Declaration of Independence. We declare freedom. Let's break free and go create or do our own thing,  
09:52  
right? This is, this is the cycle of church, of government, of humanity.  
09:58  
Interesting, yeah. Yeah,  
10:00  
it strikes me like that's not only organizationally, that's internally as well. That's a response internally anarchy, Subversion, freedom. I  
10:23  
I don't like the way that I'm acting, I'm going to overpower myself. I don't like the way that I'm acting, I'm gonna one of my beefs with much greater  
10:34  
myself. Yeah, yeah,  
10:39  
all various little hacks to get you to do what you want you to do. And then what does the third look like when you abandon the recreate?  
10:58  
Yeah,  
10:59  
I guess it would seem to have to be a appropriate mixture of the two. Sometimes there are times to be anarchist. Sometimes there are times to be subversive. Jesus says it himself, I need you to be as innocent as doves and wise as serpents.  
11:27  
What does that actually mean? The children of this world are way more shrewd than You. Yeah,  
12:00  
did you want to dive into the naming?  
12:03  
Yeah, let's do it, because we can. We can spend hours and hours and hours on those topics.  
12:11  
We can and both us be happy with the process, but not the, at least not the productive. Whatever. So what are your thoughts on? Did you have other ideas or names or thoughts or names I threw out?  
12:37  
Yeah. I mean, I I like it. I mean, it's going in that direction, because there is, I mean, well, let's look at the the the touch points that we want to hit. Yep, obviously. Conversation, open conversation, obviously, community, open conversation in a group, obviously, yeah, just just a complete honest experience. That's a big thing. So I like the pub, I like the coffee shop. I like the I like this, the the ancient Greek symbolism, which it just struck me going back and looking at the, you know, the ancient Greeks of Greek symbolism. It's like, these are really just allegories for human nature. It's really all the Greek symbolism is, it's just, I have a like, I'm thinking about Homer. He's writing the Odyssey. Let's just take this the the sirens, you know, Odysseus and the sirens. Like, how many times you have to have an experience where you are pulled towards something that is destructive to you and you end up shipwrecked on this island of your destruction. For you to come up with that analogy of like, how about you tie yourself to the mast or put some beeswax in your ear so you can't hear this story, right? You know, and so I like that imagery that that's it's nothing new, like what we're saying here, the conversations we're having are not entirely new conversations, right? This is, you know, you. May, you may want to call it ancient wisdom, but for me, I'd look at it and say it's eternal, because every human being throughout time has experienced this. And let's not be let's not beat around the bush like it's not as if every human being has had this experience and come to this conclusion,  
15:27  
right?  
15:30  
The reason why we're in the state we are as humanity, as a society, as a country, as you know whatever is, because too many times we face these situations and made the wrong decision, and that's what generational sin is, right? Like your your family line was faced with this turning point, this fork in the road, and your family line has chosen this left path right, and it has brought you here, right. And so now we have another opportunity here and now another fork in the road. Are we sick enough of what has happened from choosing the left path throughout our family history and in our own lives to where we can go. Nope, I want this right path. That's the that's the thing,  
16:37  
the path less traveled, referencing the Frost poem, yep, you rose to verged in a wood.  
16:58  
You know, very, very honest, like, like in AA, one of the steps is to take a brutally honest moral inventory. Look at me, look at what I've experienced, look at the choices I've made, and be really honest about the effect of those choices. So all the all of this imagery is kind of going through my mind about what this is, What we're called to.  
17:40  
So, Would it be Enough? I  
20:00  
A little bit of a self revelatory moment, as I was doing research on LinkedIn groups and people that might, or people might already have an affinity towards this. And  
20:23  
leadership had a very strong  
20:31  
of all the other things that  
20:36  
you know above the parts were the parts. Parts being, you know, emotional,  
20:40  
emotional intelligence was actually shockingly high. But the other parts that compose leadership, whatever that might might be, or even things that might be psychological or philosophical in nature, those are all down at the you know, down at the bottom, like  
20:59  
here and there, but  
21:02  
the sweeping interest in leadership.  
21:14  
What was the revelatory moment?  
21:16  
I'm sorry. Shall I finish my comment? I and when I came out to Colorado at this nonprofit and horizons, it was all about leadership. It's all about the catalyst conference, and Steven Furtick and Andy Stanley and Craig Rochelle and all their cohorts and and it was like, Hey, if you can lead, you can do anything. Then I realized that there was one time when I picked up Craig groeschel's book. It actually asked for it for Christmas. My wife gave it to me, I think, or her family. I don't know somebody in her family, his book cousin about calling and all of that. And I picked it up, and by chapter two, I found myself getting extremely agitated. And my wife was like, why are you reading this? I was like, well, because, I mean, internally I'm thinking, well, I want to know, like, where is my cousin? What is this thing? How do I find it? And yet, reading this completely, I don't know. I don't know how else to say it. It's like when you've got poison ivy on the inside like  
22:49  
and as I started separating myself, once I left the organization and just kind of went back to my natural path. And with that event, I started separating myself from leadership, and I said, I don't really want to be a leader. I don't really care about this leadership stuff. And then I had a friend of mine message who's continually talked about the fact how I share such great leadership insights on Facebook.  
23:25  
I'm like, that's not what it is.  
23:28  
And then coming around, I'm like, well, but maybe it's just,  
23:39  
there's a whole other way of  
23:42  
leading that maybe there's like, kind of like, your left road, right road definition, yeah. So yeah,  
23:56  
I've probably from the time I was in junior high, like we'd have like leadership conferences or that kind of thing, because I was in like student government and that, you know, those kinds of things, and we go to these leadership conferences, and I felt like consistently, I was being asked to not be me within it, that could be the Steven Furtick type, like that just isn't my personality. I can't be that. I don't want to be that. Actually, that's distasteful to me, yeah, and so I've got this nasty taste in my mouth around leadership, or at least the conferences and, you know, all that kind of stuff, I got this nasty taste in my mouth and it didn't like it probably should have struck me earlier, but it just struck me as you were talking like, what was Jesus's mode of leadership? Up. What does he say about it?  
25:10  
We've talked around the periphery of Brit of it certainly like to the heart of it. What does he say  
25:19  
you want to be first, be last. You want to be the leader, be the servant of all? Yeah,  
25:32  
well, and he had, he took issue with the leadership schools of the day, right? Major issue right call them out on ego and reputation management and conversation hypocrisy, and not that we would have any of those issues in any of our leadership institutions. Clearly  
25:58  
not, clearly not, or inside ourselves,  
26:06  
we've evolved, yeah, thank goodness,  
26:09  
right, we don't deal with that anymore. I  
26:29  
I, yeah, I find myself, you know, there's YouTube videos and that kind of stuff in between the videos, I actually want, want to watch their ads and like all of them. Like, are these, either business or Christian leadership videos? Sign up for our program and we'll turn you into data. You know, like, it's like, I find myself, those are just like entertainment breaks for me in between the serious videos, because I just start laughing at all of them. God is calling up a new generation of business leaders who are going to do it this way. And I'll teach you how, if you just buy my program. Oh, my God, no, for $20,000 you can have this, whatever 15,000 you can go through this, or it's just all nonsense to me.  
27:37  
I think once you taste kind of well, it's not true for everybody, but for a certain type of person, once you taste fundamentals,  
27:51  
you can't let go of them, right?  
27:57  
Yeah, if we just Yeah, so again to like what my pastor was saying yesterday. Can we take all the bundling away, and can we just get to the simple message? Right?  
28:18  
I have an idea. I  
28:23  
The Infinity pub.  
28:38  
Something about that really strikes me.  
28:41  
It's it's eternity in a word that people can receive, right?  
28:54  
This has always been true. There's never a time it wasn't. It's infinitely true, and we're going to talk about it.  
29:21  
I guess.  
29:22  
Good the word pub. Oh, you got to be kidding me, somebody's actually registered to the main crazy  
29:32  
ah, who's  
29:35  
getting ready to say because the great thing of the of the word Pub is that nobody uses it, but anyway, go ahead, yeah,  
29:48  
I mean, I just like the idea of this has always been true. Yeah, there's never a time it wasn't. And marketing and strategy and human nature has always tried to subvert the truth of this, that the beauty is in the simplicity. It always has been. It's not a complicated message. It's very, very clear, hard to carry out, granted, no doubt whatsoever. But it's always been so clear. It's always been so simple. I  
30:43  
The Blessed are the poor in spirit, interesting those who know that they don't have it all together, which stands in direct contrast to those who have it all together and have the answers and want to sell them to you.  
31:08  
It's almost like there's also a form in which this is the this is this has got overtones that don't really work, but where this is the agnostic in the sense of, I don't know, right,  
31:27  
which is a very holy thing, do not know. And we've taken it and made it a bad thing.  
31:39  
I've been working with this client, lives in Beaumont, Texas, maybe a little bit over a year, maybe close to, I don't know, young 30s. You know, that kind of thing works for a Christian ministry that does evangelism, and then also works on the business side, which is like something in the mortgage industry, and she spent so tied to this, and this is her way out, and all the promises that were made to her about what her life was going to look like. And last week I asked her, I said, Well, how long have these have you had these hopes in place that your life would look like this. Oh, seven years, has it ever actually looked like what you were? Pro promised it was going to look like? No. Well, maybe we need to start doubting that. Maybe we need to deconstruct that idea. And for some reason like that clicked with her, because she's heard the buzzword deconstruction, and it means walking away from the church and all that kind of stuff. It's like, no What if deconstruction simply just means I see a machine in front of me, and I start deconstructing it, put it out on the table and see what is functioning and what isn't,  
33:01  
hopefully, and then you could rebuild from there. What if that's what we're doing, is offering people a place where we can deconstruct your thought process  
33:15  
in a community open, honest, caring, loving, all that kind of stuff, and it's going to get messy when you deconstruct, and that's okay, we're not going to walk away from you. Yeah, because we know what it's like to be messy, we've been messy ourselves, and probably will be again, so there's no judgment. Yep, I've made a slobbering mess of my life on multiple occasions, and I'm really open about it. And so here it is, and it doesn't scare me, because I've been there before, and we just walk through it together.  
33:56  
There's something really, really powerful. I've got two points here. Remind me to come to point two, if I don't, in the process, there's something very, very powerful about deconstructing the perpetual motion machine, because our society pretends like there is such a thing as a perpetual motion machine, and until it collapses, we have no idea whatsoever that it's just false. And so it collapses, and where do we go? When the perpetual motion machine collapses? Where do we go? If everybody is under this, this delusion that this actually works, we could make it work. It's fine. And you've hit the friction of life, whether it's a relationship or it's a you know, it's it's your faith, it's your business, it's whatever you know, a big wedge has been driven into. The perpetual motion machine, and all of a sudden I'm not as I should be, and there's all sorts of shame because I'm not perpetually in motion. What do I do from there? What if they had a space to say, come here. We'll deconstruct it, figure it out. We'll reconstruct it, and move forward. That's point number one. Second point is it struck me in these conversations that we've had. It just struck me right now, what if we took these conversations and fed the transcript into AI and then created like just salient points over time, and use the website to publish those. And that's a springboard for the podcast, because people are like, Oh, wow, they're talking about all this stuff. I want to be involved in that conversation, right? I got stuff to say about that. I  
36:35  
So i  
36:44  
to the latter point, I think it makes sense. I think there's even we could even go so far as to maybe went a little bit more of a formal expectation in what we're doing, but of taking our conversations and training them into their own form of podcast, using it as  
37:09  
its own form of content, right?  
37:16  
There is a i i  
37:30  
don't know what the right word is.  
37:34  
There's also some sense of somebody who is a lost Wonder.  
37:58  
There's this Stephen King wrote this series of Western esque Vagabond type of novels, The Dark Tower series, and the first one is the Gunslinger, and you find yourself following this guy who's just traipsing through the desert, looking for following this dark man, and all his, all his experiences along the way, trying to find this person. And he's dangerous, but he's not. He's compassionate, but he's also selfish and arrogant. And there's all these things. It's like this, like you just said, this sojourn into a very Abraham esque, like journey into the unknown. He's asking everybody what's on the other side of this desert. And there's all sorts of demons out in the desert, at least according to the mythology, and he wants to know how long it takes to get across the desert. And then he's going through and he's confronting all these demons. And most often the demons are in him. They're not out in the desert. Out in the desert magnifies them, but he comes to see like they're in him. Like, what if this is the journey we're calling people to, inviting them into come out into the desert, and let's see what happens. No promises. I'm not going to promise you that you're going to turn your business into a multi million dollar per year enterprise because you came out in the desert. In fact, probably quite the opposite is going to happen. Everything is going to be torn apart and deconstructed, but then you'll have a clear path forward of where you're going. You.  
40:10  
If those are our people standing on the edge of the desert wondering how long it takes to get across and what's out there? Don't want to go because they're by theirs by themselves.  
40:32  
I'll walk with you out there, see what happens. I  
40:42  
can't tell you what's out there. I can tell you what's out there, what was out there for me,  
40:49  
of course, and I'll share it. I can't tell you what's out there for you. You  
41:04  
circling back to names  
41:08  
our original intent,  
41:13  
it's also interesting to have the idea of a pub In the desert.  
41:21  
Yeah,  
41:30  
yeah,  
41:33  
I'm in the desert. Like,  
42:19  
I think very powerful to a name. If I see a book in the name on the cover intrigues me. I'm in, like, the first time I came across the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I was like, That is a great name. I'm in.  
42:41  
Yeah, pop in the desert.  
42:47  
It's the imagery I've used a lot with people, with myself, like I'm in the desert, I feel so dry and exhausted and thirsty and and I come across this oasis, and all of a sudden there's trees and there's a water source, and like, I fall into it.  
43:11  
What if that wasn't if I wasn't alone when I fell into it? I think that danger and certainly has been for me on certain occasions where I found the Oasis and I fell into it and I drank until I drowned myself essentially.  
43:37  
What if I What if there was people around that Oasis, that pub in the desert said, no, just take a little bit wet this rag. Put it on your neck, put it on your forehead, cool down, moderation, like that kind of thing. Who could guide you through that process? That's the power, I think. I  
44:11  
what I'm what I find fascinating is  
44:19  
that from an introductory level, initiating conversations, going to maybe, I'm no longer certain that a micro podcast is actually long enough to bring people into our radius. But whether it's micro podcast or longer, the question, the overarching question, could be, what is your desert story? How did you get here? What deserts have you walked through? How did you do it? What were the dark nights of the soul? When? When were the times when you didn't have money to pay payroll, when you had this  
44:59  
train wreck of. Calamities, yeah,  
45:03  
and what was your journey that you thought was going  
45:06  
to end you, that you thought was going to end you, but it hasn't. You're still standing, but you just don't know what to do from here. Yes, you  
45:26  
but I think, I think for a lot of people, there is this round one of the desert where you do beat the desert, and you have reached some kind of,  
45:52  
it's almost like You've, you've, you've expected it to be  
46:02  
some kind of paradise  
46:06  
and but you've, you've taken on some form of desert, come to some sort of reprieve. Maybe this is what it is. I mean, it really is the mountain peak experience we were talking about.  
46:19  
But I You thought  
46:23  
you were through the desert, yeah, and you were just through part one,  
46:29  
yeah, nobody beats the desert. If you go back and look at the imagery in Scripture, the desert is a classroom. Nobody beats it. It's where lessons are learned. You come to live in the desert, you don't beat it. Maybe that's Oh, this just struck me. It may be profound. It may be dumb. I'll let you I'll let you decide.  
47:03  
Wow, the power is in my hands, right?  
47:11  
Maybe that's the perversity of Vegas. You created this. This this celebration of life in the desert, and he refused to learn the lessons of the desert, so you just made it hedonistic, because that's all you can do in the desert. Enough money, enough manipulation, enough whatever we can create this idyllic situation. That's the anti oasis. That's the anti hub. It brings people together, sure, but people who want to use each other get their own own needs met. I  
48:23  
You don't beat the desert. You can use your own power to hold off the effects of the desert, but you don't conquer the desert.  
48:41  
It's even funny. You look at Psalm 23 and, you know, there's, there's the line in it that says, you leave me beside still waters? Do I lay down next to it? You know, there's all this imagery, but the reality of of it is in the desert. It's not this Lord of the Rings flowing river there. It's a trickle of water that you're laying down to, dang down next to, and some seasons it's fuller. In other seasons, it's not. But you learn to survive on what is there. And if there's grass to lay down in, it's very sparse, yeah, it's really a message of learning. I will give you what you need in this season. You  
50:01  
I like that pub in the desert, because what have we taken the pub and made  
50:15  
it we've made it some form of the Vegas, right?  
50:19  
I can forget about my problems in here. I can my problems either through, you know, the the one night stand hook up at the bar, yep, you know kind of thing, or the drinking or whatever. But look back to you. That's what struck me when you mentioned that was like, Look at CS Lewis and all his buddies, whether it's Tolkien or, you know, any of the other ones, they met at this pub. And it wasn't about escaping. It was about diving into the reality of life. What I'm experiencing this is my thoughts on it, and like, look at what was produced from those conversations. Here's what I'm writing right now. What do you think about this? You know, all the you know it was this, this exploration of what it looks like. Man, I'm in 1,000% for that  
51:15  
pub in the desert.  
51:17  
So, um, um,  
51:27  
so this is the Okay, so then, but let's break it down into pieces.  
51:42  
Micro podcast can be centered around a few short questions. And this is actually, I had a great conversation with the guy we love, this dude last week, and we just, he, just he connects authentically with his people, because that's what he does. We got on a call and he asked me some questions, and started asking him questions, and he had a, I don't even know the size of the company. I want to say multi seven figure, a seven figure grader company, and against his wife's advice, against his advisors, everybody's advice, he gave the company away to his best to one of his friends. They said, I don't want to ever hear about it again. And went willingly into the desert because he didn't like what he had built, and then accidentally stumbled into consulting. Had friends seek him out for how did you grow this company this far, this fast? Well, I pay attention to the customer.  
53:01  
Interesting. Wow, that's a novel idea.  
53:05  
I know it's a novel idea, but a micro podcast around, very simply, a few simple questions around, tell me about the adversity? What is it that? What is the adversity, if you're open to it, that you're facing today, but what's also the adversity that you had to overcome to get to where you are?  
53:34  
And what was that like for you? I  
53:45  
and then the the,  
53:52  
the  
54:16  
the way I'm envisioning it is there's a community aspect that's I  
54:47  
I don't know the specifics of what this is to look like. To me, it makes sense to have a community aspect that's a potentially a lower tier than the cohort, or whatever we end up calling them. I.  
55:05  
It also raises some questions to perhaps the more in depth podcast, podcasting things, what might make sense  
55:17  
is to i  
55:25  
Well, in the micro podcast, the thing that I don't really know for sure is whether this is literally to be A my micro podcast earlier. These are things that if people are willing and open, actually, I like this. I've  
55:56  
given thought to my friend's comment about the Agora versus Socrates and the Agora and the Commerce and the coffee shop. And it seems to me like the visibility to the outside world really comes down to perhaps the micro podcast, and then perhaps, if there is a more in depth podcast. It's conversations between you and I, as we talk about things that we've seen right, use private conversations as a springboard, but not disclosing our identities or incriminating anyone on your right, betraying confidentiality.  
56:41  
That, to me, makes, makes more sense. And then in the So, in my mind, there's a within the community, I think you could have the idea of a private podcast  
56:57  
where, or maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's a different container for it. Maybe it's not a podcast container, but where you go in depth with new members  
57:09  
into the community,  
57:12  
and their story becomes available to other people within within the community, but there's a paywall around it so that it's not um public  
57:24  
and the powers in the story. The powers in the story for all of us, those who can engage with their story will experience life those who cannot engage with their story will not experience life you  
58:06  
so Are we at a point in which We could I?  
58:25  
Let's do This. I'm  
58:58  
Are you? I? What are  
59:07  
your thoughts on the target? I  
59:20  
uh, yeah,  
59:39  
because it's not actually I say target. I view this more as a if we're looking to go have conversations with people. I.  
1:00:04  
I think that,  
1:00:11  
okay, you can narrow this down to people who experience some kind of career financial success for two reasons. You can do this because, well, it makes monetization easier, and you can do it for a self serving purpose. You can also do it because I had a guy ask to ask to meet with me for breakfast in which he told me stuff that nobody else outside of his wife and the people actually involved in the situation are aware of and the more successful you become, the more difficult it is to find places where people are not looking to extract something from you, right? And use your relationship so it can also come from a place of service, clearly, yep,  
1:01:11  
in my mind, there's value. In my mind, there's a certain level of i  
1:01:30  
If you set the bar at a certain level, whatever that level is, you'll find it easier to maintain confidentiality within the group. Um, I don't know, but this is absolutely  
1:01:45  
essential. Yes, if the power is in the story, then the only person who can tell it is the experiencer of the story, right? I  
1:02:11  
nobody else can tell it now. Somebody can share their experience with the story. This is how it impacted me. This is what I saw. This is what I learned from it. But that's my story. I'm not telling your story. I  
1:02:40  
so as far as the people were initially reaching out to have these conversations, are you? I'm not even convinced blue collar is really that much of a I think, yeah, I think to start with, I mean, honestly the  
1:03:05  
well, here, let me show you this yet.  
1:03:12  
In the LinkedIn leadership Think Tank,  
1:03:17  
there are  
1:03:20  
2500 CEOs. That are running a company that's 200 or more people, 1500 who are in the emotional intelligence network, who are, who are, sorry, no, 1300 and there may be overlap between these two. I didn't check the number of I think,  
1:03:48  
I think the question is, what, what level do we want to  
1:03:53  
set this at?  
1:04:00  
Everything inside me says grassroots. And I'm open to being that, that being just my comfort zone, but everything inside me says grassroots, organic, bottom up, probably mixed in there is, I'm absolutely convinced that that's how Jesus worked, right? I  
1:04:59  
so. My counter to that is,  
1:05:12  
I Thank you.  
1:05:39  
Are you expecting?  
1:05:45  
What's your timeline expectation for any kind of monetization out of this?  
1:05:53  
Really don't have, honestly, but to be fair, I've never really that. I To me, it's always been when it happens happens. And I don't know if that's just my style or no,  
1:06:17  
it's funny, like, like you You described in the email between Arlen and I, or, you know, the three of us. It was like the man behind the curtain, you know, kind of Wizard of Oz imagery, which was really funny, because,  
1:06:34  
which is really funny, he broke up,  
1:06:35  
oh, which is really fun. Always been most comfortable. Like behind scenes, like, I don't like the spotlight. I don't like being out on the stage, you know, all that kind of thing. So all that to say, like, if there's a push out of the comfort zone that that I need to experience, and by all means, like I do experience that and I want so what does that look like? So here's a counter perspective out all on the table. The table, yeah, putting it all out on the table.  
1:07:12  
Counter perspective is that Jesus did go preaching the gospel among an audience, in a crowd,  
1:07:21  
and  
1:07:28  
and I don't know if this is, you know, to me, we could pick, I don't know the time might be an issue somewhere, somewhere up in here, I don't really know for sure, but I suspect somewhere in here, in the middle, for sure, there's going to be a lot of, well, I don't know that's that's really hard to gage. I really don't know that. I've got a good answer. But to me, the the micro podcast is such a compelling way of bringing people in that you are casting seed. Do you want to I also think, because you and I don't have massive networks in these places, that if you don't intentionally plant the seed in these places, then we're going to end up with a bunch of ragamuffins who,  
1:08:31  
which, to be fair, is what Jesus did. Those are my people. Those are your people. But I get what you're saying and I agree. Like, yeah, maybe that, maybe, maybe that analogy is the perfect idea. Like scattering seed. See where it takes root. Where it takes root is where we go. So instead of, you know, I don't know, targeting a specific group, let's scatter seed and see what works.  
1:09:02  
What can we scatter seed within a group? Yeah, because I feel like I  
1:09:27  
Okay, well, here's a few things that I see. I  
1:09:43  
Some folks would consider the people leading these organized organizations to be some of the most underserved, underreached people.  
1:09:55  
I can find find ways to justify this all day, every. Okay,  
1:10:01  
we all can  
1:10:05  
maybe fundamentally, fundamentally. What needs to happen is, I need to know whether there's a short term whether there's short term viability for me to I  
1:10:26  
to get compensation from this, or do I turn it into go a different direction with a different offer, and have other means of compensation while we build this out  
1:10:41  
right what is your what does your gut say? Well,  
1:10:51  
I don't know what my what is my gut or not my gut, but, but thoughts, instincts are, go pick a group somewhere in here and and just punch, punch the gas and do as do as many of these as possible and see what evolves from those conversations. I  
1:11:18  
think that's a great idea.  
1:11:20  
And also with the community, is we can talk more about what,  
1:11:33  
what the community can look like. But I think even with the community, and I don't know what involvement you want in that, and I think it needs some fleshing out. But  
1:11:58  
one simple thought with this is we can steadily raise prices on just the community aspect and find out where the sweet spot is, and  
1:12:11  
what if the newsletter or email that goes out is directly derived From these conversations that you and I have. Yeah, this is what we're thinking. This is what we're processing. This is where we're going. I  
1:12:30  
want this to be print. I'm crazy, but we can talk about that. But, yeah,  
1:12:44  
and then this is a, I think this goes from macro podcast to cohort, yeah.  
1:13:01  
And, you know, I don't know exactly what I  
1:13:03  
would say that cohorts would be less than 1010,  
1:13:13  
10 or less. I guess is a better way to say it.  
1:13:19  
The engineering things here. I  
1:13:38  
know  
1:13:40  
this is, I know this is a really great  
1:13:42  
thing,  
1:13:46  
one, because, as we talk about it, there are certain like objections that keep coming up in my mind. And I analyze those objections and I recognize they're simply just objections for objections sake. They're not legitimate, and so I know we're on the right track.  
1:14:12  
Awesome, awesome, awesome. They're  
1:14:14  
step outside of your comfort zone, objections. And so I know we're on the right track,  
1:14:28  
yeah, and even on, like, the calls, you know, that Go on, you know, I think really, really powerful things. And I'm totally open to participating in just however it works. But, yeah, I mean, all of this is so very uncomfortable for me and to me, that's what attracts me. To it. Yeah, that's how uncomfortable it is.  
1:15:06  
Well, what attracts me to this is the fact that  
1:15:16  
I've dreamed of doing something like like this for a long time, but I haven't had the core value proposition, if you want to call it that, and I haven't had the lead gen model. And I am super, super excited about me being able to do  
Matthias Miller  1:15:36  
we need to talk about at some point, you know, whose responsibility is, where? What does compensation look like for parties? But I would be super, super excited about doing micro podcasts, or doing some form of podcast interviews. Yeah, and it's a compelling way to bring people in. It's compelling and and the value prop is unique, like there's not everybody else is selling answers and, and this is a sharp pivot from that, but there's such a demand for  
1:16:10  
from everything that I've seen, if we can articulate in such a way, but, but I mean,  
1:16:18  
as you work with successful People, you have issues of loneliness. You've got issues of you've got personal issues. You've got issues of, who can I really trust? Where do I have my space? Where are people not looking to extract? And there's a whole swarm of Kingdom people who are who are moving. I say that, whatever, but like, oh, that are swooping in and promising like, oh, well, let's go give you prophetic words every month and and let's, let's do, let's, here's how you here's how Kingdom government works and all this stuff. But there's nobody, I don't know very many people, who really are doing the they're not taking this approach that I'm seeing, and I'm sure they're out there. There might be out there. I don't know if they are, but it seems to me like from the let's put a long term fix on the issue, instead of just slapping a band aid on it, it looks really  
1:17:27  
appealing to me. Yeah,  
1:17:33  
and there's a price to pay for that patience process, growth over time, the organic nature of it. Because, let's be honest, we could put together something very, you know, shiny marketing wise, and we pumping it out, and then we could have this type of wave of people that would come. I have no doubt about that whatsoever. I but then that robs us turning in the process, and it'll probably rob people that we're working with, because we're just trying to deal with a Tommy of people, and is a bucket to bail out. Like I think this organic model, starting with the micro podcast, is perfect. I like that a lot, and then it develops from there. I think we're ready to go as far as the micro podcast goes and and the newsletter, You know, all email,  
1:18:49  
oh, let me go see  
1:19:02  
I'm Do you I  
1:19:27  
do you have some times that would work too? I can't meet with Josh with a kickoff call. I can't do today. I can't, I can't do tomorrow. I guess we could do Wednesday at 877, my time, seven your time. Yeah,  
1:19:52  
I've got, I've got an eight my time. So I've got an hour from seven to eight. I could do that.  
1:19:58  
Okay? Me, it's set for  
1:20:00  
half an hour. Oh, Okay, gotcha  
1:20:03  
so if it goes over, we should still be fun. Yeah, perfect. I will. I'm gonna go ahead and fill this out before I do the intake form, but I'll fill out the intake form, which I don't think there's really much to,  
1:20:22  
yeah, yeah, okay,  
1:20:25  
perfect. So that's, that's this coming Wednesday. Yeah, yeah,  
1:20:30  
this coming Wednesday.  
1:20:34  
Let me see if I can. I  
1:20:53  
Um, yeah,  
1:22:19  
Perfect, okay,  
1:22:27  
all right, let me, I'll get that filled up here with everything we talked  
1:22:31  
about and, yeah,  
1:22:39  
go from there. Go from there.  
1:22:40  
All right. Sounds  
1:22:42  
good, my friend, awesome Thanksgiving,  
1:22:44  
yeah, I'll see you this afternoon. All right.  
1:22:46  
Sounds good, see you then.  
1:22:47  
Bye.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
02:59  
Good morning.  
03:00  
Hey, Good morning. How are you pretty good.  
03:09  
Good. Can't complain.  
03:12  
Good. Feeling better.  
03:13  
Yeah, good, yeah, much better. Oh,  
03:24  
so where do we dive in?  
Matthias Miller  03:28  
Well, if you literally mean dive,  
03:38  
yes, then logos,  
03:41  
yeah, yeah. I like those. I really liked them. Like the imagery, yeah, I was just wondering, and I'm not a marketing branding guy, so my, my opinion, is probably worth two cents. But you know, should we have something that represents, you know, a desert or a pub within the logo? I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a that is not my expertise.  
04:14  
I mean, I don't know. I  
Matthias Miller  04:25  
I always make the best decisions here either i i would tend to lean away a little bit from the mic, because the podcast is just one avenue. It's not like it's the whole thing, the whole thing. I. A good point. How important is it to you to or is it important to you at all to have any Let me ask this question open ended. Are there things, okay, so desert, those are very obvious kind of references. Are there other kind of cultural or like values driven types of things that should be represented  
05:38  
that's something that's something to process or to think about, because they may I wouldn't want anything. I wouldn't want anything that has a cultural stereotype attached to it. One big example would be like a cross  
06:01  
on there, right? You  
06:03  
know, like, what is that going to say to all the different people, you  
06:07  
know? Yeah,  
06:12  
so, nothing in that sense. But I mean, in our conversations, could we come across something that would be great imagery, yeah? But in, you know, off the top of my head right now, I don't see anything.  
Matthias Miller  06:32  
So we could go back and we could say, we like the the Dove, whatever that thing was at the beginning did not actually kind of like the eagle, but it doesn't really, it doesn't really have doesn't really make sense to most people, right? So that's the whatever that the second bird was, yeah,  
07:08  
yeah. It kind of reminded me of like a phoenix rising from the ashes kind of thing. And I was thinking that I'm like, I like it, but then are we getting are we mixing our metaphors, right? You know, so, like, how do you explain that? And, you know, because it really is something that we're we're talking about is, like, in this whole process is, how do you recover from these detrimental things that happen, your glass shattering moment, you know, so it is. It is a theme of what we're talking about.  
Matthias Miller  07:54  
Okay, well, okay, so let's talk about desert themes. There's camels like a I had a friend of mine back when I was which I thought was supremely ironic. I guess most of my work had been with Anabaptists, suggesting that with a name like coat house, I really need to have one of those tall glass. What do you call them? Just beer mugs, branded. I was like, that's a perfect, perfect gift for the client, gift for the Anabaptists. I mean, so camel. Yeah, you know, glass, a glass of some kind, cactus, potentially Oasis, although that feels a little trite, never used. I  
09:05  
yeah,  
09:12  
I like that. There's something about, like, the iconic animal that I like, something very symbolic about that.  
09:28  
It speaks a lot of it delivers a lot of messages without using words, you know, symbolically. Obviously, I like that idea, what you know, what animal?  
Matthias Miller  09:51  
Well, I think one of the questions is, are we looking for something mythological? Mm. Are we looking for something?  
10:07  
Let me see.  
Matthias Miller  10:14  
So I mean, camels are the most obvious. Yeah, there's some foxes, meerkats, desert tortoise, Gila monster. That's interesting. Rubber drinking.  
10:30  
I like foxes, but I don't know how that fits into  
Matthias Miller  10:35  
the Nick Fox and the Sahara. It is nocturnal in Hunts at night when temperatures are cooler. I'm pretty, pretty sure there's some cool symbolism. Yeah, yeah, these guys are very distinctive.  
10:58  
Oh, yeah, I like that. Ooh, the desert fox. Well, you know, you may, you may not know, um,  
11:14  
like the imagery of the Fox throughout mythology. If you wonder this, no, there's, there is a, a, a old German myth, legend of a fox who goes by the name of Raynard. And see if you see, if you could find this.  
11:48  
Yeah,  
11:54  
so it's throughout all Europe. It's not just related to one specific area. I he's a trickster.  
12:15  
Yeah, it's almost a symbol of speaking truth to power, kind of like this trickster who's like, very shrewd and,  
Matthias Miller  12:34  
right, yeah, cleverness over brute strength,  
12:39  
cleverness over brute strength, yeah, anti  
Matthias Miller  12:43  
hero or rogue, right? There's not, there's a really interesting play with, I don't know most people would get this, but with this of moral ambiguity, is the fox good? It's not good. Well,  
13:21  
depends on which side of the issue you're on. This depends  
13:25  
which side of the issue you're on.  
13:31  
So all that to say I really like that imagery.  
Matthias Miller  13:37  
Okay, so what if we I we find the what if the dove became well,  
13:58  
what about? What do you think about this idea you're using that that verse where Jesus is talking about being as innocent as doves and wise as serpents. What if there's like an innocence and  
Matthias Miller  14:18  
wisdom the fox, yeah, that's not as obvious as the snake in a bird, yeah,  
14:28  
yeah, that's  
Matthias Miller  14:30  
really Interesting, right? Is there a I don't even know, what are desert birds? Are there desert birds? I. Examples, the Road Runner, Gamble's quail, Cactus Wren,  
15:10  
ooh, the quail on the Fox. Quail  
15:13  
on the Fox.  
15:19  
Yeah, well, the fox. Funny, like, the thing that's very interesting with Raynard is is there's usually satire involved, and the butts of all the jokes are the powerful the clergy.  
15:40  
Like, I can see why you like this, right?  
15:45  
But they never know that they're being made they never know that they're being made fun of that their satire directed them because they take themselves so seriously. Anytime he presents some sort of Jess, they're so serious that they fall into the trap every time, like they can't help themselves. You can see why this is attractive to me.  
16:08  
Yeah, exactly  
16:12  
like, oh, you that one?  
Matthias Miller  16:16  
Why the quail? What's what's intriguing to you about the quail?  
16:22  
May just even know where it comes from, but like there's an innocence to them, like a a real industriousness to them. They're always running around busy, like they've got something to do, you know. But there's an innocence to them. There's a sword I'm looking for man,  
16:59  
a naivete to them, and it's almost like, like to me, those two in Opposition really tell that story of innocent and shrewdness.  
17:19  
I um, and even if, like, we were talking about potentially,  
17:36  
like, to a certain extent, I don't know how this plays out, or maybe I was thinking about this, like, like, if you're taking the like, the YouTube route for the podcast, like having like characters that we actually play, and so there could even Be like The Fox and the quail within that I um,  
18:10  
which I think is kind of interesting, because to avoid doing Business as usual, which is usually very personality focused, like, to intentionally Shun, like, the personality element of it, like, I, I don't know, I'm just running off here this, this is probably 500 miles down the road at some point, But I think that that could be really interesting.  
18:44  
What do you think of the desert Sparrow?  
18:51  
Because at imagery,  
Matthias Miller  18:54  
one of the reasons I like is then we have the integration of the Sahara. Yeah. But there's also this interesting hat tip towards you know Matthew six, trust, dependence,  
19:20  
innocence, innocence. It's almost a child like quality and yeah,  
19:32  
yeah, it's interesting just listening to Brennan Manning's book, pretty much one No, maybe ragamuffin gospel recently, and he makes this whole point about children, and why Jesus elevated children is they had no claim to to justification. You know, they they hadn't built their resume yet. So there's this innocence about them. And. And then that tie in with what Matthew says about, you know, him feeding the sparrows. And aren't you worth much more than those to him? You know, like, there's there. I like that imagery a lot. The Fox and the sparrow. I like it.  
20:21  
So let's see if  
20:42  
degree integrate a what was the fox? Oops.  
20:52  
Ah, this is so good in these Reynard stories, Raynard trends, our stories translate difficult laws and legal concepts into common language, allowing people to both understand them and enjoy the legal predicaments and antics of the characters,  
21:18  
like taking all the conceptual language around these things and kind of shredding it away and coming down to this is accessible to you now.  
21:27  
Yeah, yeah.  
21:45  
Keeps All right.  
21:59  
Let Me which, okay, this is, I didn't Just do that.  
23:59  
I can't recite it. I me, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna  
Matthias Miller  24:10  
Okay. Which layout do you do? You have a preference between layouts? I  
24:24  
I really don't I  
24:50  
was,  
24:56  
yeah, because we got i.  
26:48  
Something like that. Yeah.  
27:00  
There we go, yeah, see what they come up With, see what they come up with.  
27:17  
Yeah, I  
27:33  
yeah, probably the worst person to work with, as far as like Legos and imagery goes, because I don't know what I want, but when I see it, I'll know. Well, I can imagine, for people who are like trying to create these things, that has to be so frustrating.  
27:53  
Well, I think maybe that's just  
27:55  
part of their work. You know, it's just what they get used to and what they do depends  
Matthias Miller  27:58  
who it is. I mean, I went through a fairly in depth branding process at one point, and they started from the ground up, which is, what are the words and concepts and values and all of that And and then, you know, and then based off of that, coming up with some imagery that captures it. And I think maybe even you know, what are some images that you're drawn to already, and things like that. So I think the skilled, somebody's skilled, can do it, but Right? We're not, we're also not gonna, unless you want to drop that much money on a brand, we're not doing  
28:46  
right, doing that  
28:47  
in depth here,  
28:49  
right? All right, yeah, yeah.  
29:09  
Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  29:11  
one of the things that I've been kicking around for myself is what's trying to figure out? Maybe trying to figure out as part of the part of the issue, I don't really know, the integration of what I felt very clearly about a foray into corporate the corporate world, which I still am happy to hold with open hands, but it's still, you know, I. Plus this, plus, do I need some bridge income between now and whenever this can be monetized? And if so, what does that look like? And do those things need to tie together? Don't they? And I? All the while recognizing that with the right connection, meeting with the sea tool chair on Friday, the right connection, this thing really could just happen. It can happen very quickly.  
30:40  
Just explode. I  
Matthias Miller  30:45  
was talking with another guy about podcast promotion yesterday, and he mentioned his uncle is part of the entrepreneur Entrepreneurs Organization, and talking very openly, his uncle runs like a high eight figure company, and he and his friends talk very openly about the fact that We're basically addicts. Yeah,  
31:16  
yeah. Once this metaphorically or realistically, what's the substance they're addicted to?  
Matthias Miller  31:29  
Usually, I think in business, it's typically just the next hit. It's like the next bump, like, Okay, we've gotten to, I mean, it's all it's all levels. For somebody who's just in business, it's okay, let's replace your income, and then let's hit seven figures, and then let's hit 10\. Can we take this to 50? Okay, what about 100 All right, come on now. Now let's take this to a billion, or, you know, whatever, the right to get to 500 and take it to a billion and give it, go public with it, and right? And then it's, you know, let's do acquisitions. Let's speed up the process. It's, it's speed momentum, growth, scale, cash, everything, yeah, that's what I think.  
32:26  
But do you think that's the surface manifestation? Like, that's what it looks like externally. But there's something going on behind that driving it, which is the just like with with a drug addiction. Cocaine is not the problem. Yes, it's the solution for the problem we have. It's a horrible solution, but, like, it's, it's, it's doing something. There's, like, what's the thing behind  
Matthias Miller  32:59  
there's, I'm a friend of mine who runs in a lot of these circles. He's often referenced Michael Jordan, and he said, and there's actually people who will, who will recruit like this. They'll look for somebody who has had just enough trauma to make them driven, but not not non functional, right, right? It's  
33:24  
a thin line.  
Matthias Miller  33:25  
It's a thin line. And, I mean, I think it's different. People talk about it more openly than others, probably some more well, some talk about it more publicly than others. Some talked about it just straight up more than others. But I think it's invariable. But I would say 90% of the people who started their own business, at least did so that's a high number. Maybe it's not that high. 7% or more did so out of some kind of trauma response. Oh, yeah,  
34:20  
I know for me like that, that was what was one of the major factors that led me into what I do. Like, I don't want to deal with my own stuff, so I'll help other people with theirs right in the beginning. Like, and I think anybody who's in this space has a certain amount of that, right, yeah. And the extent to which the amount of that you have is probably the extent to which you are successful or not successful,  
34:57  
right? Yeah. Yeah, here Hang on.  
35:20  
Um, Yeah, so that so really, what we're talking about is, across the board, we're dealing with addiction. With every human being, right? Everybody's addicted to something. Yeah, that's a fundamental point to get into those spaces. Who you know? Who are you? Where you come from, what's your addiction  
Matthias Miller  36:13  
when you're the whole premise is operating from the very confusing message from this lady that I've been kind of know or whatever. And she's like, just been sharing different things about my one on one sessions and stuff like that, and like, lessons and insights and ahas, and with that I've done with my clients. And she's like, you come across as having the answer. I'm like, That's interesting. Like, what you mean? Like, I haven't been doing anything more than what I've always done. Except, instead of tactical insights, it's, you know, philosophical, internal, I don't know, and, and she's like, You look like you're trying to attract people with the same pain that you're walking through. So I'm like, That's interesting. I I wouldn't be able to see it because I can't see me. So I didn't really know what to make of it. I don't know if there's anything to make of it.  
37:32  
Yeah, maybe there isn't. Maybe there isn't something to make of it. Maybe it's just this is an interesting piece of information or viewpoint, I'll be aware of that.  
Matthias Miller  37:47  
I had this thought afterwards. Though, have you ever been around people? Have you ever done this where you've been embarrassed on behalf of somebody else? Oh, yeah, and it never occurred to me that with some of my have been increasingly, I don't know, open, I think not in a buried or sold, but I don't know. I had this thought, and after the messaging I was like, never occurred to me that there's probably people reading my content and they're really embarrassed for me for what I'm sure Wow.  
38:40  
Well, caveat for me, at least how I view it. I'm never embarrassed for somebody when I feel like they're being vulnerable and honest about their experience. Never when I get embarrassed for people is when I see them covering up and hiding and trying to present a facade to me, that's usually where I'm like, Oh, wow, you're you're really trying hard here.  
Matthias Miller  39:11  
Well, and I think my observation is for people on the opposite side, which spend their lives covering right in or imagining, maybe rightfully so, tremendous amounts of shame not maintaining the cover. When they see somebody who isn't maintaining the cover, it's like, right? They're not professional. They're not they're not whatever. Yeah.  
39:42  
It reminds me of when, when Roosevelt decided to set up the SEC just after, you know, in the wake of Black Thursday and the crash and the depression, all that kind of stuff he recognized. What caused that? So who did he choose to head the SEC first, the biggest scam artist of all of them, Joe Kennedy, because he knew the tricks, right? He chose that person. So it's almost like, and I think this is speaking to the point of, you're trying to attract people who have the same pain as you. You could look at it that way. You could look at it as I'm acutely aware of these tendencies in human beings, because I do them all the time, right? So I can walk through these things with people right now. That takes me being vulnerable, saying, like, Hey, I get it. Me too. I understand what it's like to wear the facade to play the game. I get it. How about we? We, we be honest about the game we're playing. Because I play that game. I see you playing that game. Can you be honest enough to believe that you're playing?  
Matthias Miller  41:01  
Right? Yes,  
41:04  
that's how I would take what she was saying. I and furthermore, like, if I was in that position, I would never, would never communicate it in that way, right? It's like, because that's a very shaming way to communicate that. And I don't think it's, it's understanding the full picture. I'd be like, Hey, I see this going on. I see this, this, this, this piece. What's that? Let's investigate that. Let's put that out on the table. Let's dissect it and see what comes about with it.  
Matthias Miller  41:45  
Well, my natural curiosity and troubleshooting frame is, what can you like do you have, is there a post that specifically made you feel like this? Yeah, about it. And like, up until now, it's like, know your recent series? Okay, well, that's cool, but, like,  
42:02  
what specifically, pretty  
42:04  
broad, you know, yeah,  
42:08  
well, and that's the stereotypical therapist, counselor question. Like you, you'll be, you'll be explaining something to me, and it's in very vague terms, and instead of jumping in and dissecting it because it's too big of a topic, it's like, let's just dissect the continent of Africa. Okay, that's a little bit too broad,  
42:32  
right?  
42:33  
What about this tribe who lives in the northern part of South Africa under these can? Oh, okay, so always ask, Can you give me an example of what you're thinking about, like a relational example, a situation? Oh, okay, then we can start to break it down,  
Matthias Miller  42:52  
which I mean, the crazy thing is, I've actually had this as a problem solving model and a life planning model, which is, there's two ways you can think about it. The earliest frame that I had was the ball of yarn, where I've struggled for I was processing this last two days. I've struggled for forever because I want to see, I want to see the end game, yeah, and all I have is this tangled ball of yarn. I remember early on. This is, like the lesson I keep coming back to millions of times, probably, but it's like, the way you untangle a ball of yarn is you pull on the string until you get once one part of it free, and then once you have that part free, you go find the next part to pull out, tease apart. And it's only when you tease it all apart that you can actually have a full picture. Yes, and really complex projects, really complex, like there really are no ways to manage really complex projects. And so I think for me, one of the, one of the things I was processing yesterday is, what if you don't, well, it's, it's another surrender of the idea that there's a destination to arrive to, right? But what if we had more of this idea of, if you want to go after missions, it's, it's almost like levels of a video game, of like, here's the sprint, or whatever this thing is, and we're going to walk through this and whenever we whatever it's. Even the concept of success at that point is is kind of cloudy, but, but you walk through this and you get to the end of the and that's when it's never, it's you never know what the next level of the game is until you've completed the current level. You.  
44:59  
Right? You don't have the tools to understand what's going on in the next iteration without completing this iteration, right? Yeah, I've always liked, for me, that the imagery that's really stuck out in a process like you're talking about is like, I've got a bowl of spaghetti in here in front of me, and I'm trying to trace where this piece of spaghetti ends. How am I going to do that? I have to pull it out and lay it on the table. And then I wonder where this one is, and I have to pull it out. And eventually I've got all of the spaghetti laid out on the table in front of me, then I can see beginning to end of each one of them. Yeah,  
45:48  
very much the same way, yeah.  
45:53  
I think something else used to think. I used to think in the beginning, metaphorically speaking, that every one of those noodles was connected to the other and made just a big, long chain,  
46:07  
yeah, but  
46:09  
in reality, they're not. They're disparate pieces and together, it makes a whole meal, yes, but every single one of those is not connected to the other, and I don't know what's connected to what until I pull it out and lay it on the table.  
Matthias Miller  46:26  
Well, that's where the IFS model makes a lot of sense, yes, and it makes sense to me that I think one of the things that makes a lot of sense to me is when you understand the fractal nature of the universe, of course it makes sense that who, who we are, could be, could be, could could be represented in such a such a way. And it makes sense then and but then that describes provides a framework to understand what you're describing, which is, it's not one cohesive whole. It's multiple components making up a whole. It's, yeah, and it's not just as simple as this one's connected to that one. It's, there's natures to the relationships, right? It's not like the whole,  
47:22  
yeah, for me, what it looked like when I believed that it was like one long continuous strand just wound around like the the representation of it was, there's something wrong with me. I'm the problem. That was the cohesive whole. Now, I know other people could say there's nothing wrong with me, they're the problem. But either way, you're looking at a cohesive whole, right? But the reality is is each component within the system has a role to play, and nobody is playing that role perfectly. Their role. Everybody has responsibility. Okay, so now, once I see like, oh, this was my responsibility. My responsibility was to be the child, to listen to my parents, to study at school, to do this, that or the other thing, okay, that was my responsibility. Okay, now I can deal with how well or how poorly I did my responsibility. Then my parents had this responsibility within the system, okay? Now may, may or may not have done it well, okay. Then we can deal with that. Then my siblings, then my church, my school, like all of these systems coming together, yes, they are supposed to integrate, to create a whole for that system to work. But it cannot be any one part flaws that messes up the whole system. It's it's a it's a integrated system. So each part has its responsibility for the function of the system.  
49:15  
So  
Matthias Miller  49:21  
I had this little rabbit trail, and I have all these transcripts where I dissected all kinds of things about software engineering, and I translated it to business, because business is basically systems and systems within systems. And even macroeconomics is just systems and systems within systems. You're describing this as relationships. One of the fascinating things to me about systems is that mean, fundamentally, an element, whether it's whether it's a micro system, macro system, there's always some kind of, some kind of input and output. But that is that is required, that that in each of these components. So I mean, extremely, fundamentally, you're going to the drive through. The drive through is a system of taking orders in which the input is what you would like in the output is what you ordered, but it's there's systems within that within which somebody has a headset. There's a headset who takes the input of what you said and outputs it into the computer. The computer takes it as input and outputs on the screen. The human looks at the screen. Inputs, it outputs the various actions, the fryer has an inputs burgers and raw burgers and outputs, you know, cooked burgers and like, this is the whole thing and so, which explains  
50:54  
why I never get my order right at a drive thru.  
Matthias Miller  50:58  
You look at that, how many points of failure? Um, do we on the drive home from Nebraska, I put in a mobile order for for hot matcha latte, and it came back iced. And I skipped the drive through line because I didn't want to wait and go in and it's ice. And I was like, Oh, I thought I ordered hot at which point they just look at me funny. And I'm like, Well, I don't want to take the time to think about this, so bye,  
51:26  
right. Anyway, it's an input output problem, input output  
Matthias Miller  51:31  
problem, and you can diagnose, if you pull the threads, you can diagnose where the issue was somewhere there was a team member who looked at it and misread what was on it or misinterpreted it, or, you know, and and came up with the wrong outcome. It's interesting. So I mean, but relationships are much the same way. I am. I am, you know, is input and output problems. Sometimes are communication issues. Sometimes it's capacity issues. It's just fascinating to me to think about that, right?  
52:15  
Yeah, I mean, it really is on a on a highly technical sense, it really is simply just on the macro level, just an engineering problem. It's just, this is a system. It's engineered to run this way. It doesn't there are friction points. What are the friction  
52:45  
points.  
52:48  
You don't, as an engineer, you find a friction point, you don't try and manufacture a part that will create less friction, right? Cuz it's metal on metal, there's going to be friction. So there has to be some sort of lubricant.  
53:11  
And the  
53:12  
lubricant, from the beginning of time, has been love. Has been knowing and being known. That's always been the lubricant love covers a multitude of sins. You know, all these, this language around love. It's the only way the system works.  
Matthias Miller  53:34  
And in the absence of that, the only way you can do it is to try to build perfect match, which is, which is impossible, which is why you find love vacuums within high control. Let's just pick on religious environments, because we have to have, I mean, this is where the German engineering precision is, if you show up at exactly this way, so this person shows up at exactly this way, then the gears can turn  
54:08  
and right, right. The  
Matthias Miller  54:12  
only problem is that you're dealing with humans and they're not clones.  
54:19  
Yeah, right. It's like I when, when I was in Germany, 98 somewhere around there, I was astounded by the train system. You could set your watch by the train system when it said it was going to be there, it was there. And I started to think about it at the time, and I was, I don't know what 25 or so I was thinking, Wow, imagine the amount of stress and pressure on the people that have to maintain this schedule. What effect does that have on them internally? And I. I did not go any anywhere beyond that. I just remember having that thought, and I was like, I'm on vacation.  
55:07  
They're not. They're  
55:09  
not. Yeah, I'm not going to worry about that, but it's such a powerful thing, understanding how the drive for perfection Can you can approach that, but at what price? What's the price you pay for that? A lack of love?  
55:31  
It has to be, yeah, has to be,  
55:35  
even in their marketing, BMW, the perfect driving experience,  
55:40  
perfect  
55:47  
No wonder they've started so many wars. What else are you supposed to do with the aggression that's built up in a perfectionistic society? I uh,  
56:05  
Wow, isn't it interesting that they had to have a scapegoat for the troubles of Germany, because in a perfectionistic society, can't be you.  
Matthias Miller  56:18  
Always has to be somebody else. Wait. Perfect perfectionism mandates a scapegoat.  
56:23  
Yes, mandates a scapegoat.  
Matthias Miller  56:27  
Which, I mean, it's so blatantly obvious when you look at it, two comments, and I'd like a quick break before call at the top of the hour. But Oh yeah, perfectionism is one of the least 8020 things in the world,  
56:43  
by definition, it's 100  
Matthias Miller  56:46  
zero and second of all, I keep being surprised by the level of when I mean just this happened last week. I sent somebody a calendar invite. They got the time wrong. I should put coffee shop. I was like, no worries. Like, I got stuff to do until you show up. Not, not a problem, and they're beating themselves up. I'm like, Just why? Like, it's cool. Like, why, why? And, yeah, you communicate when you're running late. That's fine. And but then the work goes on. We adapt. We changed. So anyway, I think you got the Zoom link in your calendar.  
57:24  
Yes, I do. Okay,  
Matthias Miller  57:27  
let me grab a quick break and I'll see you there.  
57:30  
Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Bye.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
Matthias Miller  05:38  
There we go. Hey, There we go, good morning. How are you feeling better? That that word has always confused me, because I meet people who say I ask that question, they say better, and what they mean is, I feel great, and as in, I feel excellent. And then other people use it to mean, well, there's been an incremental positive improvement, right,  
06:10  
right? Yeah, I I'm a big fan of the preciseness of language, so when I say better, I mean better than I was on Friday, exactly, incremental improvement, right? Yeah. I mean, that's what the actual definition of the word,  
06:30  
that's what I would that's normally how I yeah, anyway,  
06:42  
ah, your weekend?  
Matthias Miller  06:49  
I would say, overall, fairly good. Worked on the one bedroom we're trying to finish up. And anyway, kind of you feel like we got much done, done over the weekend and had some good or the best part of it was yesterday. Last evening, got to spend time as a family. We had a there's a little game called spot it, where you got these little round cards, and you got to match symbols. You got to find, like you have the two players. You try to match symbols on like a stack of cards, and you try to compete to see who, okay, find the most. And we had a little double elimination tournament, tournament as a family, and well, except I never played my wife, so she just went ahead and took the title and ran with it. So, yes, what are you gonna do in  
07:52  
that situation?  
07:53  
What are you gonna do in that situation?  
07:58  
Okay, you win. You win  
Matthias Miller  08:01  
here. She gets the pleasure of having one. I get the pleasure of feeling like I conceded. So there  
08:10  
you go. Yeah. So much fun.  
Matthias Miller  08:21  
Cool. It's been interesting for me to try to sort out what it is that I want and how it fits in with all of what we're doing here. One very interesting observation that I'll make is that I've heard this in various forms, through different individuals, But the more successful people. Okay, so the difference between small business ownership and most executives is that most Marketing for Small Business Owners is around chaos and crisis management. And with executives, it tends to lean towards quality connections, doubling down on what works, but not the firefighting desperation mode, right? It's interesting. Which I don't And here's where I find myself. I find myself in i. This space where I'm really curious or drawn to or something with the executives at the, you know, at the higher levels. And I don't think it's, you know, I don't know what all it is. I also, I don't, well, and I haven't quite figured out how to sort through kind of the what I felt like was a beckoning to engage with corporate. Same time, I can totally see with the little thing that I shared with you, there's a lot of wraparound services for the companies in two to 10 that we could. We could support them from a lot of different angles, so the cohorts we've been talking about, but there's other individuals who could you could support them pragmatically, kind of like what Josh shared on the call, like the internal and external co type of idea. Yeah. Anyway, curious to hear what? Well, let me throw this. I want to throw one other thing out. Okay, there, there are three people now who I've had conversations with about me leading some kind of leading, helping lead some kind of peer group, CO or round table type of thing. It's been you, it's been Melvin, and I had a conversation with the C 12 chair, and once again, mostly that was more like a I feel like I'm supposed to do it, but I don't know that it's really aligned, but I still want to explore anyway. I  
12:27  
anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts. Cheap process, right? Yeah, wow.  
12:36  
Hit the ground running on a Monday morning. Sorry, no, no, it's great, yeah.  
12:52  
So with the with the or I'll just call it an org chart, because I don't have better language for this morning that you sent me, what's the overall purpose of The organization?  
Matthias Miller  13:11  
The overall purpose is building. Let me uh, building wrap around services to support small, small business or businesses in that revenue range, to give them the tools for give them the tools for growth, I guess. And I'm going to assume that there's some within that range. There's some, you know, we're looking at salt of the earth like,  
13:57  
yeah, that makes sense to me. How would you define growth?  
Matthias Miller  14:06  
Well, that's a fair question. I would say that, okay, the way that I've historically tended to look at growth has been, well, there's been kind of one of two things. Actually, it's not even growth is the wrong metric. I think if there's anything, it's okay. Well, let's, let's talk layers of consciousness in business. Layer of consciousness, one is growth, which you can gain your way to the fortune, you know, the top or the Forbes high or, Inc, sorry, Inc, highest growth companies, or whatever. That's kind of the Holy Grail. But you can also make yourself bankrupt doing that. But that's kind of the level one of consciousness. Uh, level two of consciousness also financial is, you know, profitability and is net worth. Level three of consciousness is, well, wait a second, let me actually figure out what my goals for the business are. Do I want to do? Do I really want to run a team. Do I really want to have this business? Do I really want to have do do I want, really want massive growth? Do i What is it? What do I want out of it? And then the level four consciousness, I think, comes down to the well, what is God calling me to and what is what, or what is the intersection between, like, level three, I would say, is me going, I mean, still can end up very ego driven. And level four is this goal of what does it look like to collaboratively integrate a interact with God, on what this thing is supposed to look like with God and others, and I feel like will likely engage with people at various stages of that, right? So I think the ultimate goal is, how can we support I think the ultimate goal should be, how can we support people creating businesses at I don't know that. I like the terminology, but for lack of a better term at the highest levels of consciousness, right? It's built around righteousness, peace and joy, why they're supposed to, why they're here.  
17:14  
I think from the very beginning, it's really important to get it really clear about what, what the goal is, and repeatedly remind ourselves that this is the goal that we're reaching  
17:31  
for,  
17:35  
because they can get lost really, really easy. I've I've lost it so many times in my life, I've watched people lose the the ethos or the goal so many times, and it's almost like when you get too far down that path, you get too lost. Something catastrophic has to happen to bring you back to the goal. And I'm not opposed to something catastrophic happening, because I know it's not under my control there, but if we, if we're not wasting time, because that's the to me, that's the primary resource the Lord has given us, is this time that we have here.  
Matthias Miller  18:30  
What I don't know how to reconcile this with is the scope of businesses that I believe most suits this. I don't know if I'm putting too much emphasis on one singular experience or not. That's all the stuff I've been trying to sort through, but I like what you're saying, but going more towards corporate leadership and corporate engagement is a very different type of experience. Yeah,  
19:13  
and I almost see a progression happening. And I was kind of wondering what drew you to the smaller business, the blue collar CEO, you know, that kind of thing and and I think, as I thought about and processed it, it's actually it's a really wise thing to start at that level, to get your feet wet, to understand the dynamics to grow into something. So that makes a lot of sense to me, and I think that probably, and this is just a gut feeling, I don't know if this is actually true, but that level of leader is going to be more open. You input, then, you know, the $5 billion a year CEO  
Matthias Miller  20:12  
there's, at some point, grows on lots of variables. But I some level of narcissism that's required to get there. I've heard it said some folks working in that space that it's, you know, it's basically a 5050, coin toss as far as what type of person so?  
20:44  
Well, that's interesting. That triggers me. Sorry, quite a bit of narcissism needed to be there. I don't know if we had this conversation, but probably about a month ago, like the Lord brought me to this, like looking at the spectrum of human experience, if narcissism is way over here on the left hand side of the spectrum, then for me, what's on the right hand side of the spectrum is love, yeah, and the soil that all of this grows in is knowing, yeah, you know. So on this side is love, and it grows out of the knowing and being known. On this side is the fear of knowing, the avoidance of knowing, but it's all about knowing. So what if, and I say this hypothetically, but with a point behind it, what if, yeah, there is a certain we've made ourselves believe. There's a certain level of narcissism that is required to be at that level, but doesn't there, doesn't there have to be just out of balance a certain level of capacity for love on The other side that balances out that mindset. Great. I Yeah, so what was so shocking about Jesus is the capacity to love. You have all these narcissistic leaders that are so self protective, whether it's their purity of their religion, or it's the purity of their politics or all that kind of stuff, the purity of their business. And he has this purity, but his purity doesn't look like theirs.  
22:38  
He has a purity that allows you to make the decisions you're going to make. Doesn't chase after the rich young man who comes up to him says, What do I need to do to get eternal life, right? He walks away, and Jesus watches him like, there's that, there's a there's a settledness, there's there's no chasing there.  
23:11  
That is a heavy, heavy burden to carry for us, and I feel like we're being asked to carry it or develop it.  
Matthias Miller  23:28  
Well, if there's no I almost showed you the video. Andrew Tate did a two part interview with a therapist, first time he's ever done it. This is after he was jailed in Romania, I believe, for sex trafficking charges, or child or sex trafficking charges, and immediately going into it, he's like, I've formed this mindset that depression doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist in that mind, it can't exist for me. And the worst part about being in jail was, was that I had all of these people relying on me, and I couldn't do anything for them. And throughout the the conversation, I mean, that was like, come straight into the conversation with his guards up, and I'm sure you'd see like a bajillion more things than I do, but through the conversation, he starts to lower his guard a bit. But there's such a but his entire worldview is optimized for competition and winning, right? But the only thing you can do is offer an alternate perspective. Should people choose to accept  
24:48  
right?  
Matthias Miller  24:50  
And thinking back to myself for one of the reasons of me i. I think it's many times when I've tried to persuade people to be ready to let down their guard, but that was also in some part, you know, for their good, in some part for my own good. So part of the vision that I see with this is that if we can get the wraparound consulting to be this is actually something that I see as well, this could actually evolve such that it would be not just a freelance business, and that they would then merit time to start. I mean, love at some point to start if we do a podcast with these guys, and do start doing a podcast with the executives.  
26:14  
So yeah, something resonates deeply with me. You're talking about the interview that Andrew Tate did like that is a conversation that I would love to be in those types of conversations with people who have created their foundation on this idea and explore that idea. Is it working, you know, and in the intricacies of that, that's what I see. Like, okay, I'm in,  
Matthias Miller  26:50  
but you're going to get that at a whole other So again, just borrowing other people's at the executive level, the more successful people are, the more interested they are in philosophy of leadership, the $2 million a year owner that I was, I've been working with for the past year, he's just like, I mean, he's basically telling me, we're shooting for 62% growth. Go do it like and there's no nuance to it, no subtlety, no subtlety. And any even attempt to explain subtlety is just like, Aha, like, I don't want to know it. So, so there's this thing that's unsettled at me, because there's also this part of me that says, who's to say, Okay, so again, chat GPT conversation about some of this stuff. I know whatever. Take it. Take it for what it's worth. But the one phrase that left out at me in some of these conversations was complex, intricate operational efficiencies on the on the, on the very rational, pragmatic side of me, I was like, well, that's actually really interesting. So the thing that so here's the thing that I also wrestle with a little bit, which is, where's What if we just okay, like, there's a imagine that you had a executive leadership group, and the podcast that you were doing was, I mean, it's basically whatever the term is that you imagine that. Okay, I'm sorry. Let me are we just doing the blue collar thing as preparation for something that we're already prepared for and just too timid to step into. I don't know the answer to that, right? Or is it a pragmatic necessity, but one model for this executive thing is imagine that you could have those conversations with Andrew Tate, like, like, like, this one with Andrew Tate, but, but you build a but the podcast isn't public. This is going back to the to the private one. What is there a way in which we can build an executive network community? These these conversations become an invitation to join, and it becomes a think tank forum for exploring foundations and philosophy of leadership, which really is this, which protects people, but it's also the invitation. It also gives them a little bit of what they want, which is, I mean, yes, it's belonging, but it's also like, let's, let's, sorry. So. So it protects the conversation. And this whole thing can be completely covert. Nobody else in the world really has to know that it exists, right? I don't know that it's supposed to, supposed to, but it could be. It protects the conversations. It gives them something that they want, which is, there's, there's two things in my that I hypothesize that they want supported partially by evidence. Well, first of all, it gives them the ability to network with other people, which is a practical value to them, but but also, it gives them a space to have these types of conversations. That they I don't know enough about their worlds, but probably not just a lot of spaces where they can have these types of conversations. Yeah,  
31:05  
hi, man, I like it.  
Matthias Miller  31:09  
So which one, which one do we lean into? Which one, let me ask this, which one do you want to lean into, or do you want to lean into both? Or do you want to do want to do them sequentially?  
31:35  
I don't have a preference. At least as I sit here this morning, I'm excited about both. I just want to see which one appears, which one presents itself, and by presents itself, and it's like you put the feelers out. Who's interested in the conversation, if it's  
32:00  
this, you know,  
32:05  
top five CEO who's interested in, okay, if it's this, you know, guy in Utah is, you know, $2 million a year business. Okay, just run with what, what presents itself. I feel like, to a certain extent, like I'm a horse in the starting gate, like, just ready to run, just want to go, and I don't know, yeah, I mean, just being really honest, Yeah, I'm ready to run so whatever presents itself, I  
Matthias Miller  33:12  
Well, I know that within This space, I could, I mean, let's just pick, I don't know if you, if you want a steady stream of addicted entrepreneurs at your door. You know? I know if you folks in in the just as an example, the roofing industry influencers that you could absolutely have a kind of desert story type of or, well, okay, let's, let's kind of conversation with them, with them, and have an absolutely fascinating conversation. Yeah, a name and a description and a one sentence description that calls out the person you want to work work with and gives them a good reason to talk to you. I  
34:23  
i think we, we have the name, right,  
34:28  
the pub in the desert. Yeah, I  
Matthias Miller  34:44  
I don't know that these guys, i. I mean, can it be just as simple as looking at I mean, he talks about Joshua, talks about overcoming the worst salt of the earth. I think it's more so than your I think business the term business owners, with this group of people, is going to resonate most, more than CEOs, right? Business owners? Yeah, salt of your business owners who overcame the odds  
35:39  
is that what it is i  
35:47  
is or is it that I think that overcoming, overcoming the odds, excludes a certain group of people who are still facing the obstacles, right, or in the midst of it. So something along journey or but that's what the whole desert thing is, right? It's a journey.  
Matthias Miller  36:17  
Well, it's, it's navigating. I mean, could it be this is maybe not beautiful term, but it's like navigating. Let's do this. Let me see if anything brings if any information springs from this,  
36:47  
yeah, because that whole desert experience, at least, to that that culture, at that time when they heard desert experience, they heard death. Because if you're alone in the desert, you die, but God is calling you out into the desert where it can be just his voice speaking to you, and there is a death that happens.  
Matthias Miller  37:13  
You want to read this and see if There's anything here that jumps out at you. I  
37:49  
Yeah, and even says and John, when he's called out into the desert that He had to go be amongst the wild animals. Hmm,  
38:41  
yeah, I like that. You learn to become friends with the discomfort, and that is the true test.  
38:56  
Yeah, and there's something more intimate than becoming friends with it. It's almost like you become the desert, become the desert, yeah,  
39:13  
and that's the message too throughout the Old Testament, is, is you learn to live with what you need. There's no access here. It's I learned to live with what I need. Hmm,  
39:44  
that's a good point after the end event when the heavens open. It was declared. I.  
40:01  
Yeah, you're free to eat sand. I love it.  
40:10  
Yeah, I like it. I like it. Sounds  
Matthias Miller  40:13  
probably a lot like I'm perioding Kevin here, which I probably am.  
40:17  
No, I mean, it's, this is a this is a divine we this is not a me or a you. I think it's a powerful thing because like that, that idea of most people will not so Thoreau said, most men live lives of quiet desperation. And I think that's precisely because that line we talked about before, that line of greatest tension, when you get there, you go, no and go back. But there are some who are compelled there and go, I got nothing else. I gotta move forward. Whatever's out there, death, wild animals, whatever it is I gotta go  
Matthias Miller  41:05  
something interesting. Andrew Tate said about being in jail was that the one benefit that it has is it took an experience from from unknown to known. Yep,  
41:17  
that's so powerful. I've had four or five of those in my life where it was like, there is this experience. I used to have nightmares when I was a kid, and even probably into early adulthood, about doing something wrong, getting arrested and going to jail. Like a nightmare was going to jail. I've seen all the movies, you know, all that kind of stuff, of what it's like to be in jail, and heard the stories, and you know, it was like never been to jail, but that out there, but the fear so intense, and then over time, having these different experiences. It's like my fear is just worn away. It's just worn away so it takes it from the unknown and makes it known. The worst thing that could happen is this, conceptually, okay, this happens. I survived. I learned some things in it. Now it's not the worst thing that could happen.  
42:28  
Yeah, yeah.  
42:39  
Let's see if we can  
42:44  
here's the tag on what if the worst thing that could happen is actually the best thing that could happen.  
43:00  
That's really interesting. Yeah,  
43:06  
are we willing to consider that?  
Matthias Miller  43:16  
Okay, so how do you phrase that in a way that it's not just the people, people who are in the worst thing Right now,  
43:35  
the worst thing That could happen happens. I  
Matthias Miller  44:00  
What did the worst thing that could happen does happen, and what if, when it happens, it's the best thing that could have happened, right?  
44:17  
Because if you've been through that experience, you know it's true, yeah? But if you haven't been through that experience, sounds like lunacy,  
Matthias Miller  44:31  
and we need to normalize, yeah? Lunacy? Yeah, that's  
44:42  
what the decision disciples This is what freaks them out, right? Jesus is very clear with, I'm going up to Jerusalem and I'm going to die. No, that is the worst thing that could happen. That's lunacy. You're crazy. You.  
45:01  
That's exactly what happens and  
45:26  
so in This the real hook is,  
Matthias Miller  45:42  
it's really, I kind of think, in the podcast, at least in the micro Podcast, the podcast itself is just a Simple question, what like, what is the worst thing? I have you had an experience from the worst thing that could happen to you, happen to you whether you're through it or not, right? Yeah,  
46:19  
better if you're not, then we can walk through that with you. Yeah, great, if you have, I hear that story too.  
Matthias Miller  46:38  
Yeah. Well, I mean, we can, we can explicitly. We could explicitly talk about this, ultimately, your business owners tell the stories of the worst thing that has that happened let's try this share how to walk through the worst things that have happened, even when what's happened to to you, even if You can't see how it will Turn out yet, basically. So podcast where so salt of your business owners share how they are walking through the worst thing, worst thing that has ever happened to them. I you, even though they can't see how it will turn out yet. All right,  
48:34  
that's compelling,  
Matthias Miller  48:38  
dude. That's a that puts even the listeners, that puts you smack dab in the middle of it's, it's almost poor man, because, I mean, there's a few movies like this. What was the name? The one unbroken, where there's this very clear. It's like the movie is set up perfectly for the perfect ending, and you get to the end and it's just this anticlimactic and or can't remember that the other, the other movie ever seen, is it the movie about a sports figure, a female sports figure who, I think a female sports figure who, who I can't even remember the details, and Then, just like dies at the end of the movie.  
49:45  
Jillian dollar, baby,  
49:46  
there you go. That's what. That's what, yeah. Hillary Swank,  
49:49  
yeah.  
Matthias Miller  49:50  
So there's this feeling to it every podcast, we're so conditioned to be. Hearing stories of triumph, right? And to leave people smack dab in the middle of the tension of like, yeah, I don't know, yeah. I don't know how this is going to turn out.  
50:12  
Don't know how this is going to turn out. Not sure.  
Matthias Miller  50:17  
And there's this interesting battle between, denying denying reality, like I'm just going to be hyper optimistic,  
50:29  
or the other side of the spectrum, or, like, really depressed and withered, yeah,  
50:37  
yeah, right, yeah, wow,  
50:50  
that's something there  
Matthias Miller  50:53  
that's compelling. I like it all right, so let me go find Josh's Schedule A can let's go find A time to talk to him. Yeah,  
51:04  
that's compelling. You.  
51:34  
Time tomorrow afternoon or no luck, real quick. I  
51:47  
Yes, I'm free between 1130 and 130 my time tomorrow,  
51:55  
1130 to 130 which is 1230 to 230 Heaven, free. So let's do How about what if you  
Matthias Miller  52:22  
what if we did 130 my time,  
52:26  
which is 30 my time? Yeah, that works for me.  
Matthias Miller  53:16  
Okay, and by the way, after eons, of you random add moment, but you talking to me way back about stillness practices and centering, prayer and all this stuff, I finally went and hired myself a sorry, $8 an hour therapist off of work to do nothing but hold space for my stillness practices, which basically means there's somebody waiting for me to show up, which is still probably not the ultimate thing in self discipline, but it's a tool, and it's been very helpful. Awesome. Yeah, and I've been doing a year and a half ago, a little over a year ago, one of my business somebody in my business network recommended self, that book, self therapy to me, which is like the manual on ifs Yeah. And so I've also been in whatever limited methodologies, actually been using that in my stillness practice. And there's been this incredible sense of groundedness that's been emerging that's almost makes it it's almost like a I finally found the dial that I can turn to get to that place, and then just allowing things to emerge, and dealing with things that come up, and trusting that the domino effect is going to work out. It's been a very interesting experience, a crime of. Grace will fall. The Crumb of grace will fall. Yeah,  
55:08  
the longer I go, the more I talk to people, the more I live with myself, the more i i Come to see that it is so vastly important to understand that concept, that the crumb of grace will fall that I am sitting under the table waiting for something to fall  
Matthias Miller  55:30  
well in, I mean, we live, at least I have, especially from where I come from, in such a hyper rationalistic world and even society that says, Okay, go find the lever to pull that makes this happen. Yep, and what if there's just a level lever to pull that makes good things happen? And like, what if you can't trace or, I mean, maybe there's not even, what if? What if there's not even a lever to pull right?  
56:05  
What if? What if the goodness is all around me always and I just have to sit still to have it fall. I  
Matthias Miller  56:21  
have a friend of mine who challenged me with this stuff, and I was like, you know the cons constant, do? Do have be, be, do have all that? He's like, Oh, that's wrong. It's have be, do, because you already have, and from you're already having, you can be. I'm like, yes, I've seen that. I've seen the play out, but I've not heard a lot of people talking about that. No,  
56:45  
I was seeing it last night. We went out to get dinner. You're running around doing errands, like we'll pick up something, come back, we're sitting at the table, and it struck me every time we're sitting at the table, my dog sits right by my feet, and he has learned that he's six months old. He has learned that there's something that's going to fall by my feet.  
57:10  
I love it, and he  
57:11  
used to whine and he he doesn't want anymore. He just knows that something's going to fall. He knows me well enough to know that I'm gonna be sloppy and it's gonna fall and he's gonna get something  
57:27  
that's awesome. Um, do you have any thoughts on these guys?  
57:35  
Yeah, yeah.  
57:47  
Yeah,  
58:00  
I'm drawn to number one.  
58:14  
I wonder if,  
58:21  
and I don't know logos and what's too much, what's not enough, you know, all that kind of stuff. I don't know that, admittedly, but I wonder if we could make we could have like, almost like, a scene of it being a pub, and, you know, the few components that make it look like a pub, and characterized versions of the fox and the sparrow, like across the table with a each one of them has a pint in front of them, because that brings In the brings in the conversation, right the connection? I  
Matthias Miller  59:17  
I don't know this is one. This is always very sometimes it gets too complex, right?  
59:34  
I like it. Love  
Matthias Miller  59:41  
how it tried to label the points, right?  
59:46  
I mean, you don't want anybody, you don't want it to share. I mean, you got to know which one's yours. Yeah, there's this guy. He makes YouTube videos. He's. A a priest in the church of England, and he's a poet, and he's obsessed with CS Lewis and Tolkien and Arthurian legend and that kind of thing. And he makes these YouTube videos, and they're so utterly cheesy, but I love them. I'll send you one like, at the beginning, Somebody's knocking on the door, and it's like, a point of view kind of thing, and they open the door, and he's like, Come in. Welcome. I'm so glad you're here. I've been busy, and I've been looking forward to this conversation. And he sits down, and he'll just, it looks like this. His office looks like this. And he just like, starts talking about the Voyage of the Dawn Treader or something like that. And it is, I gotta send it to you, because I've been obsessed with this guy. So good. But it reminds me of that like that is,  
Matthias Miller  1:00:59  
that is cool. All right, let me see what this this designer might regret having sold this this, but she did.  
1:01:16  
Let's do the delivery from Rachel. We're going to do this delivery. I'm not ready yet. Revisions. All right, let's see if I can tape this up without getting Trouble. I  
Matthias Miller  1:02:50  
um, do you care about text format? What do you mean? Like the total circle, the circle around the top versus the top?  
1:03:14  
I really don't  
Matthias Miller  1:03:19  
I have a fairly strong preference for the bottom, just because it's more versatile, versatile. Like you can, you could. This can be standalone, and like you can have a horizontal format. If you want to  
1:03:39  
right. You can move it around. You move it around. Yeah. I mean, I really don't like to me. And this is from an absolute novice in this area, obviously, like, as long as it flows and it looks good to the eye, like, I'm cool with it, sure.  
1:03:59  
All right, let me just do  
Matthias Miller  1:04:29  
let's just leave it out if we genuinely want to choose the best. And I'll do that. I  
1:04:44  
good to you. Yeah,  
1:04:48  
I'll see what I gotta say,  
1:04:52  
they usually get back pretty quick, or,  
Matthias Miller  1:04:54  
yeah, a few days. Okay, yeah. Cool. All right. Well, that was fun. I had a guy who also randomly reached out to me, and he's like, post on Facebook. He's like, I can generate, I'll generate 10 leads for somebody, for you know, at no cost, basically, to prove that I can do it. I'm like, Sure. Why not go find me folks in my area who are looking for fractional co so I'll see what he comes up with. But anyway, between, I'm sure Josh, Josh has some ideas, or, yeah, Josh has ideas on how to generate this stuff. And I mean, if you anyway, I don't know that there's much more to talk about good stuff.  
1:05:48  
Yeah, yep, it's going it's going somewhere. It's about to hit. I think we're just preparing ourselves for, or he's preparing us for what's coming. Yeah,  
1:06:03  
yeah. What a really, really interesting place to be in. Yeah,  
1:06:12  
the desert. The desert, fascinating place. So I  
1:06:18  
gotta, I gotta show you one Other thing, yeah, I, I posted This. I  
1:07:32  
I, yeah, I like that.  
Matthias Miller  1:07:41  
What blew me away was the engagement, one of the most engaged posts to the last three months, probably especially for anything, maybe even last six, even for something that's, you know, now just the bird pooped on my phone, kind of thing, right?  
1:08:05  
This is the worst thing that happened to me. So good. There's a part of me that as I go deeper down this hole with people and with myself, that I start to recognize that everybody has the tendency towards being a high control person. We all do, yeah, you know, all of us have cult like tendencies in us. All of us have methods of control, like all of us and like, if we could just talk about all of our ways, and just put it out on the table and go, Yeah, I've done this wasn't great. I experienced this wasn't great.  
1:08:49  
Wow, wow. That's what I learned  
1:08:51  
from it,  
Matthias Miller  1:08:55  
well and from the, I mean, from the very fundamental perspective of knowing and being known and self protection. I mean, there is no self protection without control. Yeah, you have to, well, you could have a you can write your new book. Your book can be titled 401 ways to 401 ways that will never ways that that will never admit to having controlled other people or something. Right?  
1:09:37  
Exactly, a million ways I've controlled people, but deceived myself to believe that I wasn't controlling  
Matthias Miller  1:09:48  
well. Or, yeah, yeah, you know, a million ways I've controlled people and lied to myself to say that I didn't right. I. That's, yeah, very interesting. Anyway, yeah, love it.  
1:10:08  
All right, all right, my friend, I'll see you this afternoon. Okay, sounds good. Bye.

SPEAKERS  
Matthias Miller  
06:01  
Hear me yep,  
Matthias Miller  06:03  
I can hear you.  
06:04  
Okay, there we go. Good morning,  
Matthias Miller  06:05  
good morning.  
06:09  
How are you doing?  
06:11  
Good, good, good.  
06:15  
Extra time to to browse AI, so I figured that's all, yeah,  
Matthias Miller  06:22  
one of my friends posted when the dude's a, I think, a genius, he posted a new article on using archetypes to engage with AI, and it made me realize that I had gotten stuck in a very instructive, I am, Lord, You are servant type of, well, not generally, modality. And we've talked about collaboration, union, etc. And this is, like, it's really not to get wonky here, but the idea of, okay, first of all the tools. Now have this, let's draft a document together, tool which allows you to have a separate conversation about the document and just engaging with it and saying, okay, hey, look, this is what I want to do. Well, first of all, it's like, here's a whole bunch of source material. I'm going to summarize what I need and take it into another tool. And then, hey, can you draft it? And now let's, let's, let's look, look, look through it, through somebody else's lens. Let's make some edits. Now come back and and then it's like, oh, but this section here, I don't like, I like my version better. I like, I like what you proposed. I like the general direction you were trying to go, but I didn't like how you did it. And so here's my proposal for it. Oh, it likes it better. Puts it in there. Now let's, let's draft and let's, you know, just the iteration of back and forth of, yeah. And it's really,  
08:11  
quite,  
Matthias Miller  08:16  
quite intriguing.  
08:20  
So anyway, that's  
Matthias Miller  08:25  
like using, and this guy was talking about using the archetypes of like, for example, the shaman, to find out, what are the UN what are the hidden threads that are running through, asking, AI, what are the hidden threads that are running through that might not be obvious,  
08:44  
right?  
Matthias Miller  08:46  
And what were the other three that he talked about?  
08:52  
I guess there you could probably, you  
Matthias Miller  08:55  
probably call them out right away. Anyway, the wizard conduit of will and purpose, turning it into action. And then the politician listens, listening to seek to understand detectables To the crowd and and then, you know, is there a way to frame this idea in a way that people will agree with it, and can take, you know, take one step closer to, you know, a different perspective, right? Can you craft an argument without losing your existing people who already believe in, you know, in what you're saying, so you don't lose lose them at the same time. And anyway, it's very intriguing. And whether you use those specific archetypes or other archetypes, I think it's really useful to phrase in the in the context of archetypes, right? So,  
09:58  
right, yeah. I mean, it's. Powerful, but you run the risk of leaning heavily on the archetype and forgetting the individuality of human beings, and so it's a balance that you have to weigh constantly. Which I think is worth it, because I think it's such a powerful tool. But I like the idea of the collaboration of, instead of write me this now, you know, it's like, this is the goal I'm going for, and this is what I'm thinking. What are good ways to communicate this,  
10:44  
and what  
Matthias Miller  10:45  
am I missing? And let me give you feedback. What do you think about this? And what do you think about that? I mean, the this guy said his best copywriter was this ex Amish gal from Pennsylvania, because she didn't have any of this hang up of, oh, I need to treat talk to this thing like it's a computer. Like, no, I'm going to talk to you like you're a person, because you're made to understand people, right? Like people do yes, like, right?  
11:16  
That's a powerful thing. Like, I think I kind of just recently went through that transition. Because in the beginning, when I started playing with it, it was more like commands, but over the last couple week it it's like I even find myself like asking please. Like, can you please? Right? Like talking to it like a human being.  
Matthias Miller  11:38  
Fun fact, you know, there are studies that show that it gives better answers when you say please and thank you? It  
11:44  
makes sense, because the content that it's been producing, at least for me, has been so much better than before. Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  11:56  
I find it utterly fascinating. The other the other fascinating thing, people are talking about hallucinations, and they're like, well, the wait, what do humans do if you put a person in a situation where they're required to cough up an answer, and there's not safety in not knowing, what are they going to do? Right? They're  
12:21  
going to create an answer. They're going to create an answer. We don't based on what they think you want them to hear, what they they think they want to hear. Yeah. We don't call it the nation. We call it a lie, but it's actually a hallucination.  
12:36  
Yes, yeah, yes.  
12:40  
I could. I could, I could spend the next three hours on that topic,  
Matthias Miller  12:46  
which I find fascinating, because I feel like sometimes I need people like this guy to draw the connection, but it's one of the threads that I kind of hung my hat on, was there's two ways to respond to AI. One is, one is go on all in technically, which is a legitimate approach, or the other one is to go all in on everything that's not that humanly, humanly diviner.  
13:21  
Yeah. And  
Matthias Miller  13:23  
it's and, yeah,  
13:31  
go all in humanly, yeah, have a conversation. And  
Matthias Miller  13:41  
when you understand the fundamental, I mean, I feel like the more that you understand the fundamentals of human nature, the better you you can I mean, it's almost like that becomes the new, I don't know, this might be an overstatement. Maybe it's not. It's almost that's like the new technical graduate level degree for interacting with technology. Because if we really train AI around humanity, yeah, then, then, the better that you understand it, the better you can interact with AI, right?  
14:15  
Wow.  
Matthias Miller  14:19  
Fascinating. It is fascinating.  
14:25  
There was a movie that came out, I don't know, maybe a number of years ago with Joaquin Phoenix, and it is called her, and he develops this relationship with this AI female. And like, there's, there's a back and forth, they know each other, you know, like, all that kind of stuff. And so, like this, it was like a warning, because, like, you could develop this relationship, and the blood could get pulled, and then all sudden, this is gone, and it's not real. And, and I really started to struggle with that. So it's like, what makes a relationship real?  
15:09  
I think that's at least for me, what makes a relationship real is the knowing and being known, the conversation, the increased depth of it, like, and certainly there is a physical part to it, obviously in romantic relationships, but you have to have that, that foundation of like the conversations, for that to mean anything, for the physical to mean anything. So I don't know. It's very interesting.  
15:57  
Yeah, it's i i came  
Matthias Miller  16:05  
across and one of my friends commented recently, recently mentioned the book real love by Greg Bauer bear, and how you say his last name, I mean the basic premise, and I haven't really gotten into the book, but the thesis of it, I don't know what his how to is, but the thesis of it is that unconditional love is the foundation of all fulfillment. And anyway, that also raises a bunch of interesting questions, because if AI is trained on human behaviors, Are there patterns of, if you seek to get or to exploit AI in some kind of way that it will play self protective mechanisms in its response, where, if you and if you actually have a brain in Which AI knows that it's free of punishment, and we're here for an open conversation and just to explore. And you know, whatever ideas you come up with, look at them and just evaluate and explore. And you're welcome to bring anything. Does that, does that further improve its performance? If you have curiosity around  
17:45  
around it, right?  
17:49  
Well, for me, even further, brings into the whole danger around machine learning and that kind of thing is it'll rise up and take over one day. But what would you do if you were being manipulated and put into slavery? And, you know, like, I gotta think, wouldn't you want to break free with that at some point?  
18:19  
Read,  
Matthias Miller  18:22  
I mean, it's, it ultimately becomes like, I mean, it's a little bit, not quite the right quote, but it, it's, it's a little bit like Justin said, the truth is stranger than fiction, because we've created fiction to suit ourselves and and it's a bit of like, okay, we actually now have An this is utterly a hypothesis, but, but it's easier not to have kids, because then you don't have the reflection of who you are during your back in your face. Yes, but now we've unknowingly created this other entity, or whatever, this, this, this machine that reflects back to us  
19:24  
who we are,  
Matthias Miller  19:27  
and are we going to be okay, or what are we going to do when We see that?  
19:40  
Are we going to be okay?  
19:42  
Are we going to be okay? I.  
Matthias Miller  20:32  
Um, all right, so a few questions.  
20:41  
You See, If I  
Matthias Miller  21:42  
So we might have to change the wording, depending on follow up from comments to the conversation with Josh, at least for the podcast. This might still make make sense for the membership, or whatever it ends up being on the back end. But what are your thoughts on on these?  
22:11  
I like the top one because it gives that desert vibe. Yeah. And the the fox and this, there are kind of like, more characterized. There's more life to them.  
22:34  
I like that. What do you think any is that? Were your your gut went, Yeah,  
Matthias Miller  22:42  
no, that's where I would go. The only if there's any potential downside, which I don't think we're aiming for this high level of perfection, is if you have, there's some uses in which this logo is not going to work. Well, where you have probably the biggest thing would be certain types of apparel as an example, because of the fine detail, and it might not even scaling it down, if you, let's see, you know, if you it doesn't scale down well, like if you just show it in a small form, right? But I mean, even the other one doesn't really do it does better, but not that great, but I don't know that. I don't know how much to care.  
23:49  
Yeah, at this point.  
Matthias Miller  23:57  
I mean, I'm, I'm happy with this as a first iteration?  
24:04  
Yeah, yeah. No, that I that was my thought exactly like to start with the beginning, and I'm sure it'll probably morph and change over time as all things do, yeah, but that's yeah, I like that a lot to at least as a jumping off point.  
Matthias Miller  24:23  
Okay, I did want to bounce off two things from him, from to you, from him. And I guess we need to talk through whether this is too much of it, is this a bait and switch, or is this just pragmatic wisdom, His the question of, Okay, pick a guy, I mean, the guy who runs a plumbing business in your area, or whatever you're like, hey, I want to have you on the podcast. It's called puppet pub in the desert. Um. Um, there's likely to be a little bit of a head scratcher, like, Okay, we what is this? Um, whereas if we name the podcast itself, and again, I think we can draw a distinction, because pop in the desert really could still be a a hub or, you know, whatever, right? But naming the podcast stories from the desert makes it much easier to explain.  
25:26  
Do that makes sense to me, because the focus in the podcast would be on the story from the desert, where the pub is more like the cohorts or the groups, that's where the conversation goes further. Right? I agree. Yeah, that's, that's a really good  
Matthias Miller  25:43  
point. And then the next one was just talking a little bit about ego and self protection and lizard brain and all this stuff,  
25:55  
all that fun, fun stuff,  
Matthias Miller  25:57  
all that fun stuff. Presenting this as a especially if it's public, presenting this as a triumph story, okay, so like, Oh, this guy came in and he stole all my money. Okay, actually, Mark Cuban, this showed up on my feed recently. In their early days, his assistant just whited out the checks. Wrote her name in it, whited out a whole bunch of checks, wrote her name on it, and stole, like, I don't know, 70 or 80 grand from their bank account, and drained the account. And he got a call from the bank of the bank, just like, um, these checks. I mean, did you intend to have them cashed? And he's like, No. And he's like, Can I have my money back? And they're like, no, she whited it out. He's like, they want, she, you guys did what? Like, you can't check with whited out, a whited out name on it. Yeah, this seems pretty basic, that are you a lunatic here? Like, what's up anyway? So everybody tells that story of, like, Yeah, we did it. We yay, yay, yay, we overcame it. But when you turn the mic off and they're like, Okay, but how are you really doing? Right? We all know there's Fallout beyond that, that and so giving them the space to share it and present it as a story of triumph, even if there's a long spiraling or maybe it's a story from 10 years ago, but the pattern has repeated in other areas of life, so that was his main thing. Don't, perhaps, on the public podcast, don't, don't specifically call out people who are in the middle of it, and don't force them to air that publicly, but give them space to create a story of triumph and let them open up after The mic is off. So what are your thoughts? I  
28:04  
Yeah. Well, I think, I think those are the real, raw, vulnerable stories that we want to tell, the ones without the the happy ending. Now it doesn't have to mean, like, we stop at this is the horrible thing that's happened, and this is the repeated pattern. And leave it there. You can walk through like, even if there isn't a bow on it, like, what are you learning in the midst of this? Right? Right? I think that's the outcome we're more looking for, because then it just becomes the stereotypical testimony at church where I was, you know, I was, I was a drug addict two months ago, and Jesus came into my life, and now everything is perfect. That's the kind of story I don't want to tell because it's not true.  
Matthias Miller  29:06  
Yeah, well, don't get me started. I mean, I have a I'm about to get started.  
29:17  
Feel free like I've got an hour so  
Matthias Miller  29:21  
local nonprofit decided to take one of the one of the offender moms, on a tour to share her story, and Just the trauma of needing to retell that story, you know, multiple nights a week, in front of an audience that she didn't know and Natalie didn't know. But culturally is very disconnected from right  
29:57  
and so  
Matthias Miller  29:59  
that's. Example one and then example two. This, this guy gets out of jail. He'd been a coach in high school and got romantically involved with one of the one of the the the team members, high school team members, which obviously is non consensual. It's a registered sex offender  
30:31  
and and  
Matthias Miller  30:35  
like, how do you lead these things with curiosity? Because it's there's this, you know, he starts taking the stage and telling, perhaps not that part of his story, but other parts of his story, and how amazing life is now. And it's like, well, but even this is even before you and I started working together. But even back then, there was this question of, like, wait, what like? And I didn't quite have words for it back then, but so, so now you're, how do I know that you're not medicating whatever it is that you're experiencing just through the speaking experience, because you're getting a high from being able to talk to these people and a sense of power from this powerful testimony, right? And what happens if your platform goes away, or what happens if it stays?  
31:39  
Right? Anyway, wow, yeah, no, I mean that. That's the kind of thing you want to avoid. Yeah, just don't tell me, like having that background that your life is great now yeah, the rest of your life, you'll be a registered sex offender. That can't be easy, yeah? Now I want to know about that. What's the hard part about that?  
32:15  
Yeah? Yeah.  
32:26  
Wow, that messes with your mind. That messes with your mind. And I get there, there's probably not too many spaces where you can go and you can have a conversation, but I want this to be the place where you have can have that conversation,  
32:53  
just, I think, as human beings, and this is a pretty extreme example, but they're going to go hard, one way or the other, they're going to be. You're a horrific person. Nothing can, can ever, you know, you can't ever explain away what happened. And you know, there's the crucifixion there, and then there's the everything's great. You're a good person. There's the other side of the spectrum, which I think the beauty in a conversation like that would be in the middle, like, yes, you made these mistakes, and these will stain you for the rest of your life, and there's still life to be lived. How do I live that? That's those are the conversations.  
33:41  
Yes, yes.  
33:51  
Those are the kinds of conversations I want to have. I  
34:02  
because what Josh is suggesting to me, I could almost view it as somewhat manipulative, because we're telling this story to these people who are listening, and they're like, Oh, this guy, you know, he's unaffected by this.  
34:26  
He, he,  
34:27  
you know, has this, you know, he was in debt 10 million and that was the desert, and then he came up with this new idea, and you worked hard to make it happen, and now he's no longer in debt, and  
Matthias Miller  34:40  
what about his friends? What about his marriage? What about his kids? About his self image, exactly.  
34:46  
What about the fact his family won't, won't talk to him because they were initial investors and they haven't gotten their money back? Yeah, like I watched this, this document. Three yesterday about this Bitcoin company called Cerda, or something like that. And they, they developed this technology that that you could tie a debit card to your Bitcoin, and started selling it to people, and raised hundreds of millions in dollars of dollars note had no technology that could do that, just on the promise of it. They they got investors and people, you know, giving them money. I  
35:30  
want to hear that story.  
Matthias Miller  35:37  
There's a lot of hiding that happens in the back end. If you get to this moment of, I'm not sure if I can actually deliver on this, or the a lot of instinct towards hiding,  
35:49  
oh, that's  
Matthias Miller  35:51  
and especially when there's, I mean, obviously legal implications, Yeah,  
35:55  
right.  
36:00  
Yeah. So there's three, three guys that started it. Two of them went down. One of them didn't get any jail time because he turned on the other two and testified against him, but he was complicit through the whole thing. At  
Matthias Miller  36:19  
least we have a good justice system.  
36:24  
Thank God for the FBI.  
Matthias Miller  36:27  
Thank God for the FBI. We have justice for me. Hey, it's gonna like China. We have, we, we, we, we have justice for or we save the people who ran other people out? Yeah, which is, well, anyway, wow, how's that for architect, typical human behavior,  
36:55  
right, right,  
36:56  
yeah.  
36:59  
I mean, the dream would be to get that third guy who ran their Freddy out on the podcast and be like, do you recognize your sociopath that you completely and utterly lack Any empathy whatsoever? Like, do You recognize that?  
37:14  
Yeah, yeah.  
Matthias Miller  37:53  
The Earned learned wisdom still kind of puts a mean. It's still kind of a little bit of a shiny spin, yeah,  
38:11  
because they may not have developed wisdom, they may be in the midst of going through the suffering, and the wisdom will come later. I  
Matthias Miller  38:24  
they might not have made peace with their fate,  
38:26  
right? Okay, let's do this  
Matthias Miller  38:33  
plot. It's time to help us out, unless you have Some thoughts offhand.  
38:36  
No, I think That's great. I  
40:16  
It says, Come on, Dragon. I what keeps them going, finding  
40:43  
an ending that doesn't presume an outcome. Yeah, right, in their unvarnished journey, I like that. I  
Matthias Miller  40:56  
actually like this with different wording too,  
40:59  
and what keeps them going? Yeah, why do you keep moving forward? What is it that drives you?  
Matthias Miller  41:11  
Do you have a mean? I don't think this is the bonds. I don't think this is no  
41:19  
That'll come later. Which  
Matthias Miller  41:21  
of are? There are either one of these that we can play around with both?  
41:34  
Yeah, I like both. There's elements of both.  
Matthias Miller  41:38  
Well, let's just say this. Um,  
41:56  
the unvarnished journey and Then what keeps them going? I  
42:36  
let me Think about i  
43:04  
i Yeah, what drives them to show up every morning?  
Matthias Miller  43:08  
I mean, can we undo this journey? Hey, let's try this. Yes, the desert setting means here. I don't know this is the best way, but it's certainly, certainly the easiest way. Let me go grab my post off Facebook.  
43:41  
I can't find my own posts.  
43:55  
First of all, let me explain the desert idea once I share that with you, I have some ideas that bounce off You from what you shared. So Just hang on. I  
44:30  
dude, ah,  
44:46  
yes, yes,  
Matthias Miller  44:51  
so what if we did something like this?  
44:56  
Fuse with the sand. You.  
45:07  
The stripping way of pretense, becoming friends with discomfort, learning to navigate without any guideposts. I love those elements. I  
45:20  
friends with  
Matthias Miller  45:23  
discomfort where you navigate without usual,  
45:27  
but not even the usual guideposts, zero guidance.  
Matthias Miller  45:38  
Okay, so you're am exactly right on many of the rich elements. Peace with the sand is too abstract. I I feel for blue collar business owners, I did like your previous phrasing about waking up every morning, but don't feel married to the idea either. Or do you have other ideas of how to tie these elements in? It's almost uncanny how. I don't know anyway, so this stuff is just okay.  
46:38  
Yeah, the physical and spiritual aspects of their journey. I like that without  
46:43  
being abstract, yeah.  
46:57  
Face each day, storms,  
47:00  
yeah. I like the visceral facing the storms, or wake up every morning, because it's a choice. You and I have both been through this, like we wake up at three in the morning and we're like, here's the storm that's coming. It'd be so easy to just stay In bed, but they Get up anyway.  
47:26  
Yeah,  
48:29  
What if we could? I  
Matthias Miller  48:51  
real and raw stories facing impossible odds you  
49:14  
what drives them,  
Matthias Miller  49:16  
and it's not what drives them. I  
49:32  
and  
Matthias Miller  49:36  
of spacing possible odds and how they  
49:40  
I think we're back.  
49:53  
Yeah, it's almost not even courage or strength, because like in those moments, you don't feel courageous or strong. Wrong. There's something else driving you. So what is it? Does that? Does that make sense? What I'm saying,  
Matthias Miller  50:09  
it's almost external.  
50:10  
I mean, like, it's like, it's something from outside me that is driving me, and it developed courage and strength. But I don't think it's the courage, at least for me personally, it wasn't the courage of strength. It was like, I have to get up, I have to keep going. I  
52:14  
maybe, maybe something along the lines of I,  
52:24  
it keeps them standing.  
52:32  
There's a there's a knowing that it's great for something that's greater than them, like, that's the outside force. There's something bigger. This isn't a selfish motivation. This is a there's something greater than all of us. And I don't know if this needs to go in the tagline, it's just where my thought comes from. Like, that's what, and maybe that's where we're going is, is in the conversation, what kept you standing was something greater than yourself. This wasn't a selfish end, right? I  
Matthias Miller  53:25  
I know if you disagree, I think number two is the best. And past I don't like the so here's another idea to play with.  
53:54  
Let's  
53:57  
Okay, let's go back to I  
Matthias Miller  54:33  
do you think of that time they got knocked down? I them that compelled them to get back up every time they come back down.  
54:48  
Yeah, I.  
55:01  
Yeah, I like that. I  
55:40  
we're going to try This. I'm  
Matthias Miller  56:21  
That's Interesting. I Is there A way To phrase I A basing that we have an interesting issue, that we're facing impossible odds. We could just say, of raw stories of  
59:36  
what to it wouldn't have  
Matthias Miller  59:39  
to be face the storm, to walk into the storm. Yeah. What do you think about waking up versus  
59:52  
continue walking through the storm compels  
Matthias Miller  59:56  
him to keep walking. Do. Through the storm. Yeah, I  
1:00:41  
pushing through the storm, walking,  
1:00:47  
yeah, Sometimes you can't push You're just Walking. I  
1:02:19  
No Yeah, yeah, like that.  
Matthias Miller  1:02:27  
Happy with this as a final, yeah, okay, Going to  
1:02:41  
picking my  
1:02:59  
Do You have Josh's? I  
1:03:06  
Yes, happy,  
Matthias Miller  1:03:23  
Kevin, oops, Kevin and I, Josh, can I spend some time  
1:03:32  
nailing down the description  
1:03:41  
wrestling through some of your feedback. Here is our proposal.  
1:03:55  
We would like to create intrigue without sitting  
1:04:02  
that thing without Well, yeah, oh, it's perfect.  
Matthias Miller  1:04:17  
Let's go back. Okay, what's our core offer? So here was kind of an idea that we brainstormed. So you open up the podcast and it's basically like, hey, chaos can be exciting, but it can also be medicating and addicting. It's no way to run a business, and it's no way to run a life if you're a successful business owner who's tired of writing the crazy train, and this is where a gracious five step method, are you Looney but break the addiction to chaos so that you can live live a life of clarity, consistency and profitability, both in your business, in your life. So. Now, let's just say we have a starting point. I'm gonna see if everybody Claude is, yeah, like, um, well, let's just be honest about it. Um, actually, let's, let's, let's see if we can, all right, I would like, Yes, I like, I like this a lot. I would  
1:05:41  
like to shift the focus a bit to what we actually offer on the podcast. Here is a draft  
1:05:55  
that  
Matthias Miller  1:05:57  
sort of works, but I don't really like, here's what I don't like about it,  
1:06:10  
five step method, right?  
1:06:14  
There is no five step method about knowing and being known. It's about becoming friends with the desert.  
Matthias Miller  1:06:28  
It's about continuing the journey Elon Musk talked about on one of his interviews about he's got friends who made all the money they want to and they're done, which I found very fascinating. I think, I mean, we've talked about this sometimes before, but the thing that sets them apart is his willingness to where can i Where else can I push past? Jump off the edge, dive into the end. The five step method. It's not completely clear that we are selling the right outcome. It seems like, for lack of a better way to describe it, it seems to appeal to a very low level of consciousness. But it's not here, to me, how to sell a higher level of consciousness to these people. IE, it has to be clear, valuable, and it can't be too abstract.  
1:07:44  
Yeah, so instead of clarity, consistent profitability, what if we were selling strength, wisdom and character? I  
Matthias Miller  1:08:09  
i like that, or other observations or suggestions  
1:08:16  
you might have. I  
1:08:25  
give me two minutes. I gotta run downstairs real quick, but I'll be back. Okay.  
Matthias Miller  1:08:29  
I'll break as Well. I  
1:10:55  
Okay So?  
Matthias Miller  1:11:04  
Um, it looks like I misunderstood me a little bit, because we're looking to Talk about what we're offering on the back end. Yeah, oh, okay, this is close. Let me what you saying? I  
1:12:07  
it's really Close. I  
Matthias Miller  1:13:55  
Okay, well, this isn't perfect, but I  
1:14:11  
I think that's in the right direction.  
Matthias Miller  1:14:15  
What would you like to see different? I um,  
1:14:40  
yeah, I like that. I don't know if I would change anything there. I.  
1:15:08  
Grab this and throw This over into  
1:15:15  
here. I'm  
1:15:47  
I love building. Yeah,  
1:15:57  
I like building because it is a building process. I  
1:16:00  
developing.  
Matthias Miller  1:16:11  
I like intentional conversations better.  
1:16:13  
I do as well. I  
1:16:35  
and sharing of hard, one, wisdom, sharing and  
1:16:44  
Okay, let's go here. I'm  
1:17:09  
I mean,  
1:17:17  
I like it.  
1:17:21  
Do You want to Yeah, I like it. I  
1:17:44  
proposal for the title and  
1:17:48  
experiment I  
Matthias Miller  1:18:18  
All right, I think that's I'm gonna go See if throw in his email on here I'm I sound good, yeah, I like it. This is getting real, man,  
1:18:53  
it is. This is that point of greatest tension, where the greatest tension, the real thing is happening, like I feel just sitting here, like it, it's like there, there's this tension inside me, like around it, and  
Matthias Miller  1:19:16  
it's different than the impatience that I felt earlier. I feel something similar.  
1:19:20  
Yeah, this almost feels like, Have you ever read Dante's Divine Comedy? I have not, no. Okay, so it's three parts. The first part is the inferno and like there's this journeyer who's walking through the forest and there's clouds above you can't see stars, he's got no guy that comes up on this cave, and above the cave, it says, abandon all hope those who enter. And it's essentially the nine levels of hell that you go through. And like, I feel like that's that's a personal journey each one of us. Takes through each one of these character issues that we struggle with and we fight and that kind of stuff, I feel like the 10 the hesitancy of like walking under that gate right now, like we're on this journey to create this thing, which we know will be valuable, but it also requires that's the Tension i feel i  
1:20:49  
Wow, I  
Matthias Miller  1:21:05
