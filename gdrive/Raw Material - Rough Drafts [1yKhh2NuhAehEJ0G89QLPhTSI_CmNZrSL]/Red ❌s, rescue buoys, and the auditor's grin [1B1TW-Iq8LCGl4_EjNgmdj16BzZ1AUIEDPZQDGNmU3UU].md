Everyone held their breath during this time of year.

The auditor would show up unannounced, and at a moment's notice, would peruse through stacks of paperwork. Her eagle eye for detail would be sure to find something that was amiss.

And year after year, she would.

However, it was a struggle to stay on top of it all...

* The daily demands of just KEEPING THE FIRES BURNING, not to mention...  
* Making sure ALL the different people completed their paperwork...  
* Making sure ALL of the right deadlines were met...

They were drowning in the sea of paperwork. They'd lost sight of the shore, and their arms were growing weary. They knew they needed help, but nobody knew exactly what.

"Can you throw us a lifeline?" they asked timidly.

"Certainly," I said.

We gathered around their conference room table, sorting through all of the nooks and crannies of their business. I asked probing questions and took judicious notes.

"What next?"

As they waited in anticipation, we built the specific tools they needed. A few months later, they began to use it every single day.

Each staff member cut back a few hours a week.

They stopped missing deadlines.

And best of all?

Their auditor left their office with a glowing smile on her face. And on theirs\!

We had taken the busywork out of their business.
