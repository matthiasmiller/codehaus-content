# **Do You Belong in the Winning Circle?**

Have you ever found yourself asking, “What on earth am I doing? Do I even belong here?”

Let me clue you in on a little secret. Even people who’ve achieved significant success–by any standard–have moments when they wonder when they’ll be found out. Even most winners feel like they don’t really belong.

If you ask those questions, you’re in good company. In fact, those questions indicate that you DO belong in the winning circle.

* Do you ever wonder what it would sound like to converse with friends who truly understand your entrepreneurial spirit?  
* Do you ever watch yourself growing increasingly weary, never having the full support you need both inside and outside your business?  
* Do you struggle to create the structure that you need in your life to tangibly move forward toward your goals?

If you answered “yes” to any of these questions–if you’ve struggled to move forward as quickly as you know you should–you belong in a Winning Circle.

## **What’s a Winning Circle?**

The Winning Circle is a virtual meetup of like-minded entrepreneurs, specifically designed to give them the support they need to move forward with their business. It’s based on 8 core tenants.

**Entrepreneurs fail because planning makes them dizzy**. If you’ve ever cracked open a planner and felt shortness of breath and momentary vertigo, don’t worry. If you don’t understand what I mean, you might not be in the right place\! If you do, please understand, you’re not broken. Most planning systems are designed for assistants and organizers, not entrepreneurs.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they lose their way**. When things become difficult, entrepreneurs often search for a “quick fix”, derailing their success even further. However, the traditional advice to “just persist” can be just as harmful. As an entrepreneur, you know the importance of having a plan that you can stick to, while continually adapting to the needs and challenges you face.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they lack support**. Every entrepreneur resists systems…until they find the system that liberates them. Surround yourself with the right support and the right systems, and things will become easier as your unique genius begins to show.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they lack knowledge**. When you’re in business, what you don’t know really *will* hurt you. Your success rests not on the *quantity* but on the *quality* of information you have. Many entrepreneurs are fed low-quality information that’s keeping them stuck at low levels.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they don’t see the progress they’re making**. You’re in business to solve problems, and if you aren’t careful, you’ll start to see only the problems you must solve. Entrepreneurs fail when they don’t regularly see and celebrate the progress they make.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they get “stuck in the weeds” instead of taking the time to think “big picture strategy”**. To borrow Stephen Covey’s analogy, it doesn’t matter how fast you climb the ladder if it’s leaning against the wrong wall. As an entrepreneur, you *must* schedule time in your calendar to step away from your business so that you can work “on it” not merely “in it”.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they become isolated**. Don’t get me wrong–most entrepreneurs I know will find a way to push through this somehow. However, constant isolation takes a deep emotional toll that prevents an entrepreneur from approaching their business with full creativity.

**Entrepreneurs fail because they never invest in themselves**. Perhaps most importantly, entrepreneurs must invest in themselves. Your personal growth is the greatest leverage point in your business, and you will never out-earn your personal worth.

## **What does the Winning Circle provide?**

The Winning Circle provides a small, tight-knit community designed specifically for entrepreneurs. Each Circle consists of 4-6 entrepreneurs who meet virtually for one hour every 1-2 weeks for a structured time together that will:

1. Make it easy for you to quickly and effectively set realistic goals…in a way that makes sense to you as an entrepreneur.  
2. Help you to see the places you’re winning and build on your wins.  
3. Help you lock arms with other entrepreneurs who are in the trenches.  
4. Schedule time for you to make high-leverage decisions by working “on” your business, not just “in” your business.

## **Expectations for Membership**

Let’s be clear: this is not a “pay to play” or “come as you want” membership.

When you join this group, **you must have a mindset of abundance and contribution**. You must have a vested interest in seeing your peers, your team, your clients, and yourself succeed.

When you join this group, you must have a clear track record of success. This does NOT mean that you need to have a seven-figure business (or even a six-figure business), or that you need to have your path completely figured out. However, **you must be willing to take advice from other people and be willing to stretch and grow**.

Unless you’re on vacation with your family or in the hospital, **we expect you to attend these virtual meetings**. If you have trouble regularly showing up (and being on time), we’ll ask you to discontinue your membership.

**We also expect you to keep your commitments to yourself**. We’re not looking for Herculean efforts from you every single week. We’re looking to support you in a long-term, sustainable entrepreneurial venture that’s uniquely congruent with YOU.

If you aren’t following through on your weekly commitments and plans, we want to help you overcome your hesitations and fears, or perhaps find a path that’s more congruent with you. However, if you’re not willing to make those changes, we’ll kindly ask you to discontinue your membership.

As an entrepreneur myself, I know that deals fall through, markets change, and kids get sick. Some days you want to work 14 hours, and other days you’re lucky to work 2 hours. That’s the life of the entrepreneur. **However, you must continually prioritize the things that are the most important**.

The Winning Circle is a unique community of highly engaged, highly committed entrepreneurs who are changing the world in business. You will be matched with similar, non-competing entrepreneurs who can support you in growing your business and your impact.

## **Your Investment**

Membership in the Winning Circle is an investment in the most important asset of your business: YOURSELF. Give yourself the support, the structure, and the growth that you deserve as an entrepreneur.

To recap, each Winning Circle will consist of **60-minute structured sessions with 4-6 entrepreneurs.** Each session will include:

* **Entrepreneurial planning** so you can focus on your highest priorities  
* **Celebrated wins** so you gain perspective as you move forward  
* **Accountability** so you can win more quickly and more often  
* **Hot seats** so you can solve your most important business challenges

We offer three levels:

1\. The **Acceleration Circles** are designed for entrepreneurs with businesses grossing more than $1 million per year. These Circles meet for 4 hours every month. The investment for this group is $947/month.

2\. The **Growth Circles** are designed for entrepreneurs with 1 or more team members and less than $1 million revenue per year. These Circles meet weekly. The investment for this group is $297/month.

3\. The **Startup Circles** are designed for freelancers and “soloproneurs” with no team or less than $100,000 revenue per year. These Circles meet twice a month. The investment for this group is $147/month.

Make no mistake: **this is an investment into yourself and your business, and you determine its return**. The more deeply you invest, the greater your opportunity for return.

Every entrepreneur and every situation is difference. While we cannot guarantee your success, we promise to give you every opportunity we can throughout these Circles to double, triple, or even 10x your membership. Gaining one untapped opportunity or avoiding one pitfall could easily pay for an entire year’s membership.
