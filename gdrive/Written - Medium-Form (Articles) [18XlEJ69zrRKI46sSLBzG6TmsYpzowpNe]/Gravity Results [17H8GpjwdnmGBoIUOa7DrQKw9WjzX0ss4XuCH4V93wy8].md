* Ways to leverage: How can you effectively use this in your marketing

# **Summary (0%)**

You have little differentiation from your competitor, and you're fighting a tough battle.

The threat of your competitors overtaking you should keep you up at night. You should not sleep until you can create a battle you can win, either by overtaking your competitors or (more likely) clearly differentiating yourself from your competitors.

Fortunately, you have a lot of low-hanging fruit that will start pulling you away from your competition's gravity.

# **Summary (25.0%)**

Although you have some differentiation from your competitor, you still lack the gravitational pull to extract yourself from your competitor's grip. If you're not careful, you will drift back into their orbit.

Fortunately, you still have a lot of opportunity to escape your competitor's gravitational pull.

# **Summary (50.0%)**

You've created more differentiation than many businesses. You've started breaking free from your competitor's gravitational pull, and you're starting to taste the benefits. Good work\!

While you still have some opportunity to extract yourself from your competitor's gravitational pull, you've done most of the work. You've probably already taken advantage of the easiest wins, so you will need to become aggressive to fully corner your market.

Domination lies ahead\!

# **Summary (75.0%)**

You've placed yourself in an envied position--something that most entrepreneurs can only hope to achieve. You've cornered your part of the market, and you've escaped your competition's gravitational pull.

You're in a position where water appears to flow uphill, and things have become much easier in your business.

Your greatest challenge is watching for your vulnerabilities and maintaining this position. Use your position to keep innovating, watching particularly for market disrupters who can upset the entire basket.

Appreciate the position you're in, and always remember to sleep with one eye open.

# **Strengths Introduction**

Your strengths are your greatest weapon against your competition, and it's crucial that you understand what they are and how to leverage them. This self-awareness provides three crucial benefits.

First, your unique strengths will show you exactly where you are the most vulnerable to disruption. Your success depends on maintaining your differentiation in these specific areas, and having strong clarity allows you to spot threats on the horizons before they can disrupt your business.

Second, when you know your unique strengths, you can wisely navigate strategic decisions without sacrificing the things that brought you your success.

Third, many businesses fail to fully leverage these strengths in areas such as their sales, marketing, or hiring. More likely than not, these strengths provide strong benefits to your customers or clients that can sharpen your position in the marketplace, and they can create a uniquely interesting place for rising talent to work.

# **No Strengths**

Right now, you do not have a clear strength to pull you away from the organization. Your strengths allow you to defend your position, breaking you free from your competitor’s pull. However, until you develop them, you remain locked into your competitor’s orbit.

Your first priority must be to search out your greatest opportunities and develop them into strengths.

# **Strengths: Objectives**

*What it is*  
You've chosen to pursue different objectives from your competitors, allowing you to pursue a different set of goals. Rather than competing on the same track, you’ve shifted your direction, allowing you to run a different race.

*What to Watch For*  
As you continue to grow your business, watch for other businesses (both established companies and small startups) who adopt the same objective.

Your biggest threat might not be your competitor who makes a small tweak, but rather an unexpected rising business who creates a fundamental shift that allows them to overtake you.

*Ways to Leverage*  
Leveraging your objectives requires you to think creatively about unexpected benefits for your customers or clients. It requires you to continue digging more deeply.

For example, if your objective is to be the least expensive, perhaps you reduce the cost by including a Do-It-Yourself component. What happens when you unravel that further? Your customers may experience the unexpected joy and satisfaction of building their own widget and watching it come to life. They might relish the mastery they acquire as they assemble the product or develop a unique skill.

If your objective is to provide the best experience, what numbers, reviews, or testimonials do you have to prove it? Develop proof. Become intentional about building a portfolio reviews, feedback, case studies, and testimonials.

Who are the people in your market who are currently experiencing the pain of a dissatisfactory experience elsewhere? Leverage your superior experience by clearly communicating their story back to them, articulating the pain that they’re already experiencing elsewhere in your market.

Look for other unexpected benefits. If you are the least expensive or most efficient, you might unexpectedly reduce the environmental footprint. The reduced cost might allow your consumer to instead spend money for things that matter the most to them, such as a home or their family. The increased efficiency might allow them to spend time doing the things that are important to them. For a business customer, it might improve their bottom line, or it might remove the headache from a particularly difficult process.

# **Strengths: Customers and Customer Type**

*What it is*  
You’ve chosen a unique subset of customers with a specific set of interests, setting you apart from your competition.

*What to Watch For*  
Your greatest threat might not be someone copying your unique angle. Most likely, you will notice any competitor who enters your space with the same approach.

However, you might not notice the competitor who chooses a different angle with a stronger affinity to your prospective clients. For example, while you might be focused on a specific age, you might encounter a competitor who focuses on a specific hobby. If that hobby has a stronger affinity to your clients, you might find yourself losing your competitive edge, even though you still maintain your segment of the market.

Watch for competitors who cross specific boundaries. For example, if you serve consumers, watch for a competitor who serves businesses, then finds a way to level the market, and enter the consumer space.

*Ways to Leverage*  
You can uncover great opportunity from immersing yourself in your customer's world. Identify the unexpected similarities among your customers, allowing you to speak more directly to them. If you're reaching mothers of young children, are they single parents? If they’re raising a family on their own, are they pursuing a second career?

From there, find the places where your people congregate. Rather than reaching the whole world, focus on reaching their entire world.

Cater to the unique rabid desires of your niche. This includes the tangible desires (new car, sound night’s sleep) as well as the intangible desires (security, purpose).

Does your product or service have special features that are tailored to your niche? If so, allow those to have a central place in your marketing.

# **Strengths: Products, Services, or Business Model**

*What it is*  
Your business has a unique set of products, services, or business model.

*What to Watch For:*   
If your products or services are unique, your first line of defense because your protection of intellectual property through trademarks, copyrights, and patents.

While this will help to provide initial protection, your greatest threat might not be the clearcut knockoff. You will likely notice when a competitor starts to sell a distinct variation of your product or service. However, you might not not when a competitor introduces an unrelated product that renders your business obsolete.

If you have a unique business model, keep your eye open for competitors who have the capacity for taking your business model and taking it mainstream.

*Ways to Leverage:*  
If you have a unique product or service, you may be able to leverage your novelty. You don’t need to restrict this merely to the novelty of your product or service. You can expand this to include the novelty of your business or your own unique personality. Look for a great story woven in the fabric of your business and integrate that into your marketing.

If you have a unique business model, be sure to capitalize the ways it benefits the consumer. To keep it very simple, the customer’s benefit of a subscription model is twofold: they can get the product at a reduced price, and they can guarantee that they’ll always have it when they need it.

Conversely, the benefit for a one-time purchase works much the same way: they can get the product for a larger upfront without paying recurring fees.

# **Strengths: Geography**

*What it is*   
Setting yourself apart geographically is a quick and easy way to differentiate yourself from your competition. For example, if you’re the only grocery store in town, you’ve immediately pulled the entire town into your gravitational pull, provided you stay outside the scope of any online retail juggernauts. You’ve done a good job at physically separating yourself from your competitors. 

*What to Watch For*   
If you're an offline business, you should be keeping a watchful eye on any online competitors that may enter your space. You might not have any online competitors yet, but this is a prime area for someone to disrupt the market. Amazon has uprooted many retailers--even impacting major retailers such as Wal-Mart. Depending on the size of your business and the products you sell, start with the assumption that online businesses will pose a significant threat. 

If you're an online business, you should watch out for the exact opposite. Localized or geographically centered businesses can speak more directly to the customer and provide an experience that’s difficult to replicate online. Localized businesses have the unique advantage of customers walking through the door and developing a strong loyalty and connection with their staff.

This level of trust is especially crucial if you're selling something that requires some level of consultation. You may be able to further solidify your reputation as a trusted advisor by developing in-person relationships, and you may be able to continue raising your prices by creating deep trust with your clients.

If you're an online retailer, your position is both an opportunity and a threat. You can develop an unfair advantage because the world continues moving to the online space. However, because the barrier to entry has been dramatically lowered, you may end up facing an even greater level of competition.

In fact, you may find that a local business provides you with a unique edge for the specific reason that it’s becoming contrarian.

Online businesses should also watch out for other online businesses entering their space. Being online does not make you immune to competition. If anything, it invites even greater competition as more businesses start to enter your space.

In an online business, your differentiation may come from your ability to capture multiple traffic sources and innovate customer captures that outperform your competitors.

*Ways to Leverage*   
If you're a local business, leverage your geography to create a unique customer experience and build deeper trust. Leverage local pride wherever it continues to persist. If you’re a grocery store, pride yourself in being a locally owned, locally employed, and locally sourced market.

Deliberately partner with other local businesses to create a “network effect”, embedding local customers more deeply into a micro-economy of your own creation.

If you’re an online business, capitalize the unique advantages of an online business. For example, you provide convenience of your customers purchasing from their own homes. You increase the transparency for your customers through customer reviews. You streamline the sales process by providing online videos and other resources that allow your potential customers to understand your product and make an educated choice. You provide a storefront that’s open 24/7 from anywhere in the world.

While these advantages are true for almost any online business, you may find that you’re not fully leveraging these advantages in your marketing.

# **Strengths: Type of Employees and Way of Working**

*What it is*  
Competitive advantage applies not only to your customers but also to your employees. When you distance yourself from other companies, you can increase the attractiveness for employees to work for your business.

When you hire quality employees, you can increase the efficiency and quality of your business. At some level, this always results in an improved experience for your customers, and it certainly impacts the profitability of your business.

Your business has a unique environment that none of your competitors have seemed to figured out. The employees you have and your style of working is different than anyone else in the industry. This uniqueness sets you apart when hiring employees.

*What to Watch For*  
Your specific threats depend on your unique differentiation.

Expert v. non-expert workers. If you're relying on expert workers, be aware that as the industry continues to mature, the cost of acquiring these experts typically goes down over time. The commoditization of knowledge slowly erodes your competitive advantage as this talent becomes easier to find and cheaper for your competitors to hire. While this happens more quickly in some industries than others, you must continue to innovate to protect yourself against this commoditization.

On the other hand, if you're relying on non-expert labor, you have easy access to a labor pool. You likely have a proven system and a proven process that anyone can adapt to quickly. Your greatest threat is the potential ease and minimal effort required for other companies to replicate what you're doing. Continued innovation increases the difficulty of your competitors replicating your process.

Contractors v. employees. By itself, this differentiation doesn’t typically provide a strong advantage to your employees. If you are relying only on this differentiation, look for additional ways to strengthen it. Since you’ve already differentiated yourself, your threat lies in other businesses who see the advantage of your way of working and begin to replicate it. Again, you have the non-obvious threat of a competitor who may find a way to create a stronger appeal to your workforce or employees.

Shared v. virtual office. If you have a shared office, keep your eyes open for a disruptor who discovers an effective way to set up a virtual team. More importantly, they may find a way to tap into a greater freelancer pool, thus driving down their costs simply because those individuals are willing to work at a lower rate. This not only allows them to tap into a cheaper pool, but it also enable them to build a much larger network, have their freelancers compete against each other, and produce a much higher quality content at a lower cost.

If you have a virtual office, watch for a shared office that captures the synergy of an energetic culture and harnesses the efficiency of in-person communication.

Commission v. hourly. The best compensation model depends on your ideal team member, and whether they prefer stability over risk and opportunity for advancement. For example, many sales individuals are open to risk and tend to operate best on a commission. On the other hand, many other employees tend to avoid that risk and prefer the increased security of a job.

It's always worth watching out for another competitor in your space who plays off of your angle and takes it two, three or even ten steps further than what you'd actually imagined or thought about.

Also consider whether a competitor might disrupt your industry by choosing a different model. For example, they may hire a risk-averse sales force that operates on an hour rate, yet doggedly pursues their prospects, winning them over one at a time.

*Ways to Leverage*   
You can leverage your way of working in different ways, depending on your unique angle.

Experts v. Non-Expert Workers. Whether you use expert or non-expert workers, you can leverage it to be a strength. When dealing with experts, you’re more likely to find top quality work by top quality people. On the other hand, if you develop a process that can be followed by non-experts, you increase the size of the pool of people who can work for you, thus increasing your capacity.

When you’re hiring experts, you can typically develop a premium product or service, giving the consumer your very best.

When you’re hiring non-experts, you may choose to leverage it in multiple ways. If you can find an effective way to hire interns or entrylevel workers, you may choose to pass the savings on to your consumer, reducing the cost of your product and service. Done correctly, you can dramatically lower your costs while increasing your profit margins.

Shared office v. office. Many individuals are looking for the opportunity to work from home, and it’s a common selling point for companies looking to hire virtual team. Depending on your industry, that may be rare enough that you can leverage it. Many individuals are willing to work for lower pay in exchange for the flexibility of a virtual office.

On the other hand, if you provide a shared office, you may find this to be a sharp differentiator in an industry where people are often isolated and work alone with little support. You may also discover increased creativity as you develop a teams who see each other as family and communicate regularly on daily basis. For many individuals, this level of support is very important.

Commission v. hourly. If your employees work for a commision, you can leverage this by inviting highly motivated and competitive individuals, giving them the opportunity to earn as much as income as they’re able to earn. If you offer an hourly wage, you will tend to cater to individuals who are risk takers.

When considering this way of working, consider whether you want to work with risk takers or stabilizers. This will determine how you structure your business and the compensation you offer. It will determine what kind of employees you will hire.

When your industry typically hires stabilizers, you may search for a specific value-add that leverages the innovative creativity of risk takers. You may intentionally choose to involve them in the day-to-day operations. 

Summary. A great way to leverage your way of working is in through your recruiting. Use the benefits of your way of working to hire the exact team members you wish to retain, then leverage that way of working in your unique business model.

# **Strengths: Type of Value Added**

*What it is*  
“Type of value added” is the distinct product or service you provide that your competitors aren’t providing. It’s the unique value you are adding to your customer’s or client’s lives.

**TODO**

*What to Watch For*   
If you’re a “done-for-you” service--like a handyman who takes care of any problems a homeowner may face--watch out for another business who adds your service as an add-on.

For example, Amazon is a great example of this kind of disruption. They began by offering done-for-you installation services as an add-on to their products. Not too long after that, they started offering Amazon Home Services, allowing local handymen to list themselves on Amazon.

Of course, you can jump on there and do your own thing, but chances are it's going to be less than what you would typically charge your clients directly. You're going to get to keep less of the money and staying afloat is going to become more of a challenge for you.

Who would’ve imagined Amazon would cut into the handyman industry? It’s a good reminder to always keep an eye for businesses within your sphere--even loosely connected to your sphere--who are looking to integrate what you're doing into their way of working and look for ways to collaborate with them. Also if you have some kind of intellectual property that's a unique value add, do what it takes to protect that and find a way to capitalize on what you've got. But also be aware that other companies will be innovating and I think one of the best things you can do is to continue innovating, refining, and improving and looking not just for incremental improvements but for fundamental, exponential improvements that can dramatically move you forward. It might take on an entirely different look, but it could very well establish your hold on the market.

*Ways to Leverage*   
If you're creating distance from other people, what you offer is probably relatively unique. So it should become front and center in how you position yourself in the market. For example, if you are the only printer who provides a done-for-you service, where everything is literally “done for you” with zero headaches and zero hassle, you become the only printer in the area who can design, print, publish online, x, y, and z.

This is your uniqueness and you can use it as a way to leverage. Since you're focusing on a specific part of the process, it allows you to get very in depth and very technical. For example, you might focus on a very specific part of the hiring process or it might be a part of the supply chain or something along those lines. Within that arena, because you focus so deeply on that, you're able to create a deeper network of resources and connections. You're able to develop unique tools that are focused specifically on that part of the value chain, and so really what ends up happening is you have such deep knowledge about it that you're able to do things either better or more efficiently or more effectively than your competitors who are taking the jack-of-all-trades approach. 

Reports and information. Ways to leverage this really comes down to finding the unique benefit you provide to your client. What is the actually day-to-day change your clients will experience? That might be one of the things you want to start considering as far as what your unique angle is. Other people might help their clients introduce peace of mind through management planning. Your unique angle may be to aggressively increase wealth through entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial means of planning, and the value add that you're giving to them is again, it kind of goes back to the stability which is risk differentiation. You're really focusing on, are you focusing on giving stability to stabilizers or helping risk takers take wise leaps. 

Also with customer service I think this is a phenomenal way to leverage this is with guarantees. The satisfaction guaranteed guarantee is pretty standard. It gets used a lot, but finding a way to make an even stronger guarantee than that and perhaps even offering to pay customers if they really aren't satisfied, there are all kinds of ways that you can actually leverage this and improve upon it. So that's that.

# **Strengths: Technology**

*What it is*

*What to Watch For*  
You want to watch out for the fact that technology is a rapidly changing field and there's new players showing up to the scene almost every day. Staying on top of the ball requires a tremendous amount of momentum. If you are in an industry that has aged and doesn't have a high level of momentum, then you're technology has given you quite the leap forward. However, you do need to watch out for innovations that are going to significantly undercut your performance. 

*Ways to Leverage*  
More likely than not there are almost certainly very clear benefits to your technology. It might be increased accuracy, it might be reduced costs, it might be less headache, it might be greater efficiency. For example, you may have created a systematic process that completely eliminates manual labor. Another way to leverage this is positioning yourself as being in the cutting edge of the field in what you're doing. 

# **Opportunities Introduction**

Congratulations on building a business that is this strong\! Good luck as you continue to grow and scale your business. This next section details the opportunities open to you and lists ways to strengthen your gravity of competition score. They are listed in order of greatest opportunity with greatest return to least return for your effort. Remember: gravity is not linear, it is exponential and so your first steps to get away from your competition are actually the greatest in boosting your gravity of competition score. Even though they are listed in this order, keep in mind that some of them will yield much greater benefits and will be much easier for you to implement than others.

Alright, let’s get to it\!

# **No Opportunities**

So now for the section where there are no opportunities. This is what we should say. You have a business that is strongly differentiated from your competitors. One of the things you might want to consider is whether you are close enough to your customers or clients. If you're not, look for ways where you could move yourself closer to the competition for the sake of getting closer to your customers and clients. However, if you have a business where you're profitable, you're strong, you're growing, you're in a very envied position. You can still find some marginal gains by going over some of the subcategories that were included with each of the sections and look for ways that you could differentiate yourself further in some of those subcategories. 

# **Opportunities: Objectives**

Currently you match the same objectives as everybody else in your market. So the first order of business is what your objectives are. If you have no clear objectives, then your immediate goal should be to create some differentiation to your objectives. Obviously, there's some tough challenges as far as how you actually achieve or accomplish that, but start out by asking yourself a few questions. 

Is your objective to be the least expensive? Is it to be the most efficient? Is it to provide the best experience? Perhaps it’s to provide the luxury line or the luxury brand? What is so unique about you that customers will consistently pick you over the guy across the street?

Determining and clarifying your objective first and foremost and should really be your number one goal. You might choose to have a service system that's comprehensive or the simplest service on the market. Either way, you must nail down a single objective. 

Once you've established your objective, the real hard work begins, which is to figure out how exactly you're going to implement that. If you're looking to become the least expensive, then you need to start looking at creative ways to lower your costs either through scalability or innovative ways of servicing your customers, or by looking for new and unusual ways to approach your business. 

If you're looking to be the most efficient, you may find yourself pursuing secondary objectives, but you start by looking for ways to systemize your business, eliminate unnecessary workload off of your team, and remove features and benefits that don't actually benefit the customer. 

If you're looking to provide the best experience, then you're looking for ways to create an atmosphere and an experience your customers really appreciate and really enjoy. 

So you're greatest opportunity here, is setting an objective that differentiates yourself from your competition. By doing that you can corner a different part of the market.

# **Opportunities: Customers and Customer Type**

You have a wide open opportunity to gain some distance between you and your competition by identifying your customer base. 

The first step in doing this is to segment based on age. For example, you could focus strictly on millennials or strictly on seniors, military and veteran customers or busy, middle aged professionals.

Another way to differentiate would be by income. You may choose to target only the wealthy or the middle class, or you may choose to go business versus consumer. 

Your competitors may be focused on the business market but you may spot an opportunity in the consumer market. Or it could be vice versa: You may have a competitor who is focusing on the consumer market and you may be able to find a niche in the business market. This gives you immediate distance.

In fact, even if you have a consumer focused business, you may be able to find opportunities with corporate clients, through providing employee benefits or some other unusual angle that may actually serve business customers with a service typically only given to consumers. 

Likely, you could segment your customers based on their hobbies. Maybe there's an unusual segment of your demographic that loves hunting, so you provide the service that is strictly focused towards hunters. 

Once you know your customers, you can start targeting them much more easily. You can implement marketing techniques such things as speaking to them in their language--whatever terms or jargon is unique to their segment--and create almost a cult like following from that niche. 

# **Opportunities: Products, Services, or Business Model**

You have a lot of opportunities to differentiate your products, services or business model. One idea on this is, if you have a subscription based business, you could think about turning it into a one time purchase. What other people are offering as a service, you might figure out a way to turn it into a one time purchase and prevent your customers from needing to buy a subscription. 

Or, if you’re on the other side of the spectrum, you might choose to do the opposite. Consider taking a product you're selling and turn it from a one time purchase to a subscription. A simple example of this is on Amazon, there are a lot of products you order on a regular basis. They’ve started selling these products through a subscription model. So if you buy tooth-paste regularly, just turn on a subscription and every few months you automatically order more. That's exactly what Amazon is doing. This could be an interesting strategy to differentiate yourself. 

Something else you might consider is changing from a product based business to a service based business or vice versa. So for example--and it depends on what kind of service you offer--rather than offering it as a service, you could develop a product that meets the same needs and allows people to either do it themselves or you create a technology that essentially does it for them. This could eventually cut down long term costs as well. 

In a lot of situations, people don't think through these kinds of issues very deeply. By applying some deep thought, you will certainly encounter some challenges in figuring out exactly how to implement it. It's not guaranteed to be easy, but you do have the opportunity to uncover a lot of interesting opportunities here.

# **Opportunities: Geography**

Opportunities for geography, so if you are in a business that needs to be very geographically centered, then this poses an interesting problem for you. How do you differentiate yourself geographically? One of the things you might consider is establishing a delivery service or partnering with a delivery service. For example, while many consumer-focused laundromats are brick-and-mortar businesses, a laundromat owner might consider a laundry pickup and delivery service, expanding the availability to the busy middle class.

Obviously, if your business is to replace car windshields, you’re stuck geographically because you have to be in range of all the cars. However, you could develop a process for replacing windshields on site, thereby eliminating the hassle of a customer needing to find you. Car detailing is another business that could be offered “on site.” Another example for potential mobility is fitness and training. 

Once you start looking for these kinds of opportunities you'll see them popping up everywhere. You might also be looking for online alternatives to offline kinds of communities. So if you have a typically offline club or some kind of offline experience, you might start looking for ways to create an online community around that, and utilizing some of these other differentiators to capitalize on what you're doing. 

Now, the inverse is also true. Every cultureship creates a counter culture opportunity, and as the world continues moving to online and digital, it creates this expanding possibility to create offline events and create offline engagements, which people crave more and more as things go digital. So if there are services or experiences that people have online, communities that they're part of online, or trainings that they take on line, you may actually be able to differentiate yourself by taking this training and going back and reversing the trend, and actually start doing offline events. 

This might also work if you're on the West Coast and there's a major competitor on the East Coast, they're significantly larger or they have other strong advantages over you. One valid choice for creating distance, rather than focusing on where they're focused on, simply focus on a distinctly different geographical region.

This could be as small as a town, it could be a county, it could be a state, it could be a country. Something else that you want to think of when it comes to countries, is that you--especially if you have an online business--might want to start looking at opportunities in foreign countries. A lot of foreign countries are undergoing a lot of similar transformations that the US is experiencing in terms of social media and access to high speed internet. The difference is that they're 3, 5, 10 years behind the US and there's a lot of business opportunities, and a much less competitive business landscape in some of these countries. So you might start exploring ways of doing international business as a way to create some more opportunities for you. 

# **Opportunities: Type of Employees and Way of Working**

Alright, so opportunities for type of employees and way of working. Again, more likely than not, your company or your industry has certain standard ways of working. 

So the industry standard might be to hire somebody with a college degree and your differentiating approach may be to hire interns or it may be to do apprenticeship. So find people with a natural aptitude and train them specifically for the job you want them to do and take it from there. If you’re working in an industry that typically uses contract labor, you may choose to turn it on it's head and hire them as employees or vice versa.

***Shared office v. virtual office***. Again, if you're in a business that typically has everybody in the same office, be aware that there's a lot of advantages to that, but you may be able to create the same experience through virtual offices and create differentiation for yourself like that. You might choose to find a creative way of compensating your people. For example, in some manufacturing industries, a commission based production is very common. You may choose to, rather than focusing on commission based wage, instead of hire these people as employees and provide a better working experience for them and actually focus on some of the productivity and motivational issues that the commission based wage was intended to solve.

# **Opportunities: Type of Value Added**

So this may be one of the most interesting ones for you. It requires a creative look at the value you provide to your customers. It may be that you have a “Done for You” service. Your opportunity here could be to instead enable people to do it themselves. 

The inverse might also be true. If there's typically some high maintenance, you could take that and provide a “Done for You” service that takes all the headache and hassle out of the customers hands. It could be something you do for your customer while they're at work or not at home. Your value added might be timeliness, quality and excellence, customer service, or the guarantee you offer to them. The value you provide could be narrowed very deeply into a specific niche or a specific part of the process where you have a much deeper knowledge set, and because of that you can approach a specific problem with a lot greater excellence. 

The value added might also be certain kinds of reports or information that you can give to them based on working with them and of course it's not just the actual information itself, but there's a value added based on what they can do with the information you provide, allowing them to make better decisions if they're in business, allowing them greater peace of mind. So those are some of the opportunities you have with value added. 

# **Opportunities: Technology**

One of the opportunities you have, especially if you're in an industry that is not really sophisticated, you can look for opportunities to create, to disrupt your industry by bringing technology into your industry. This works for a lot of really unsophisticated industries that don’t seem like they could ever be tech enabled. By doing this, you can often significantly increase the benefit to people, sometimes by lowering the cost, but the exact benefit may vary. 

You might not even expose customers to the technology, it could solely for internal use. But because you use the technology internally, you create distance from your competition and you can provide a far superior experience and actually do it at a superior profit. 

This might come with certain tools you have. For a simple example, if you're a handyman, there may be certain tools, tips, or ways of getting things done that would allow you to get them done significantly faster and do a significantly better job at the same time. This might be equipment or the quality of the equipment. It could be your equipment might be solar powered versus non renewable fuel energy. These are just a few examples of some of the opportunities that you have to explore with your technology.
