You mentioned Process Street, and other saas tools for workflow. Are there any books/blogs that help guide a decision towards which 3rd party process/tool to use.

\-- The Time X-Ray  
    \* Could be automated \-- and I could review that and get with them with some challenges and a way to improve what theyire doing  
    \* Could even get people, who already have a coaching business, and then do a white label for them, for that product, for that industry (give them a complete exclusive for that industry, if they maintain a certain number of customers, and if they don't use it enough, use it for somebody else)  
    \* Use VA's from Philppines w/ Mastesr and articulate, by offering to set up email filters for people who are "too busy to do it themselves"  
    \* There are ways to expand on the systemaizing that builds credibility with what I'm doing, and it solidifies them into becoming a client  
    \* Perry has 1,000s of people with like us, and I could generate an audience 

\-- Kelly \--   
 \*\* This is a MAIN QUOTE \-- where this is 6 words, where there's a lot to think about  
 \*\* What I recognized about my unique context, tying things together  
 \*\* To somebody who's lived in a different context, and it's landing as something that's really interesting and fresh

\-- Mike  
 \*\* Systems Introduction  
 \*\* Tools & Techniques  
If you just look at this last piece, etc  
\*\* What are teh DIFERENCES that those MINDSETS and the subparts of the system mindset MAKE, in doing the prioritization, efficiencies, etc \-- because that's the actual differentiator because of the other people  
\*\* First part was strong, but didn't get that connection, but not the connection WHY this actually matters  
\-- It didn't have connection there \-- IN THIS, what's the DIFFERENTIAL about having a systems view...vs. just taking those tips and if you google and find them...  
\-- Think about .... What Kelly said....  
  \*\* What are the GEMS?

Mike \-- I mentioned earlier, about refactoring can be applied to software systems, and also   
 \>\>\>\> That's a HUGE area, and a huge implication for systems thinking...

If you do this, and you don't have the SYSTEMS THINKING, then there's all the other stuff that's not going to happen...  
\>\> The current vogue topic of transformation, but only part of the process, but not thinking about the big picture  
\>\> How does that affect everything?

If you DO THIS, you're getting this without geetting the systems view, or want impact on a larger level

As a 1 person business, currently, i want to expand. I’ve gone as far as i can using occasional freelancers. I develop e-commerce websites and digital ad campaigns. What are the typical problems i need to avoid by expanding? Best / recommended management systems (asana etc?) I can see that some of your slides were very relevant to my situation.

Jay \- because of my expertise in systems and codes, beginnings of a package where coders and coding teams become more efficient...
