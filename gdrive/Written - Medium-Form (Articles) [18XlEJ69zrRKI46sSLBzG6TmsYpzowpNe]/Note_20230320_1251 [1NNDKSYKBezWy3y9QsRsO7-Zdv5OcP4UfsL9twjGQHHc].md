Well, one of the things, one of the rules of thumb that I have is keep everything on your plate as little as possible, get it onto somebody else's plate as quickly as possible. And when there's technical knowledge involved, do as much diagnosis as you need to to keep it from coming back to you and then, of course, hand it off and leave it on somebody else's court for follow-up. My only response is a... I mean, email for me is a hot potato and that's how I roll with it. So when I sit down for email, one of the first things that I do is rip through all the informational emails. And this really is a process change that I think could be helpful or beneficial for me. It's easy just to get in the rhythm and habit of it, but I think it could actually be helpful for me to separate things that require some kind of communication or project management back and forth and actual feedback from me versus things that are strictly disinformational. So, I rip through, get rid of those things that are disinformational, anything that I need to know.  |
| :---- | :---- |
|  | And then there are times when there's a bigger project where I'm... For example, the insight marketing project is a bigger project and requires a lot more back and forth. One of the things that I do on those that we started doing that Gabe introduced me to that I really like is you have a single email thread where things are going back and forth, you have a new paragraph for each topic with a bold prefix. So for example, on a marketing campaign, you might have something like Google Ads in bold and then you have a paragraph describing information regarding Google Ads, and you have another one bold. Facebook Ads and you talk about stuff about that, and then you have bold, call tracking for, fill in the blank, 123, and you have more specifics around that. And what that allows you to do is, rather than having a dozen different email chains where things are flying back and forth, it allows you to have a single email chain and go back and forth on that and make sure things don't fall through the cracks.  |
|  | The other thing that I would look for is for duplicates. For example, sometimes you get error notifications or things like that. So if they're earlier ones, I just discard the earlier ones or sometimes I discard the later ones. Whatever, it doesn't really matter, just catch one of them... Give me a second, let me think, what else? Typically, when I'm overwhelmed, things tend to sit in my inbox a little bit because my time management goes down when I'm overwhelmed. I try to keep only a few things that really deserve my highest priority at any given time. And requires more level of detail than that, it probably needs to be handed off to somebody else to help manage and oversee. But there are times when I will take something that's in my inbox and I'll throw it on the calendar, or I'll throw it into project-management system and put it on there, or... Well, that's really what I do there.  |
|  | And then on the project-management side, I think I've lacked this primarily on the CodeHaus side, but, once again, I try to put as much project ownership on other people as possible. So they're actually responsible for managing with the project management. It is sometimes challenging for me to determine priorities of what needs to be done and, as much as possible, just loop in whoever knows into that and whoever's got that kind of operational mindset and just lean on them to help me decipher what's what and sort through it.  |
|  | One of the things that I've learned is to respect my own creative and working rhythm, which is absolutely catastrophic for somebody who doesn't understand how I work. I'll get to that in just a moment. I've actually got a really good handle over my flow of energy, but it's a non-linear type of working style. So, I will pick something up. While I have creative energy for that, I work on it until I lose steam on it and I will set it aside and then I'll go work on something else. This is the kind of thing that drives people crazy when they... If you're a linear worker, this is not a style that's going to work for you, but I understand my style and I know what works, and I'm constantly re-evaluating and juggling things based on the current priority and where things are at.  |
|  | The other thing that's been really helpful for me is I'm not initiating fact finding. So I don't always recognize when I'm missing information. So one of the things that I have learned along the way is to recognize basically what are common reasons why I start out or lose motivation on a project. And almost always when I hit a wall, it's either I'll set it aside and I'll wait until it's the right timing because it might not be the right timing to pursue it or to keep driving it forward, or I will... Again, I'm most successful when I've got somebody else where I can... I set it aside. There's somebody else I'm collaborating with on the project. We've got to get heads together and work through that. It's also been really helpful for me to have a coach that I've got access to more than once a month and be able to balance things back and forth and get momentum on stuff as I get stuck on it.  |
|  | And then, there's still this whole system with the email subscriptions. I rank email subscriptions based on frequency, daily, weekly, monthly, and that system works very well. Those just happen sporadically and randomly whenever I feel like going in there and finding out what's going on. There's not really any kind of real urgency.  |
|  | Anyway, I think that's probably the gist of it. That's how I process my email. If there's any more specific questions, I'll \[inaudible\] answer them. Thanks.  |
