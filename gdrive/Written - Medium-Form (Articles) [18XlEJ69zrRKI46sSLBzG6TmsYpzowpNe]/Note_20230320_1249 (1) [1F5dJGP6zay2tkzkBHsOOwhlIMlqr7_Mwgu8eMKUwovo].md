There's a tree structure process, hierarchical process, in optimization, which means in software optimization. So for example, when you... The first step of any kind of optimization issue is, find the worst-case scenario, first of all, and how do you exaggerate the problem? So in software, it's like go throw the biggest dataset at it or the biggest fill-in-the-blank. Or if it's related to resource contention, Go constraints, the problematic resources, so do something that brings it to the surface.  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Speaker 1: | And then the question is, once you have that, then you do the analysis. Now the cool thing is with software you have a call stack, which is essentially a hierarchical view of where the bottleneck is. And so do you start at a high level? So it might not be immediately clear when you say, "What's taking a long time?" But at a high level you say, "How much time is this, and what are the big portions of it, and how long does each big portion take?" And then you dive down into those portions. And it could be that what initially appears to take a really long time is actually quite well optimized. It's just takes a long time.  |
| Speaker 1: | And then you look for, so you may end up going down a different branch, and diagnosing another part of the process. You might find that in that part of the process, there's a piece of it that takes an inordinate amount of time that it's hyper inefficient and you can fine-tune that. And then as a result of that you get marginal benefit. Now the other thing you might discover along the way is that your algorithm is wrong, which means that your fundamental approach is misaligned. So what are ways that you can eliminate that? Well, there's a few ways that you can do that. One is you can do more things simultaneously and so you can introduce multi-threading for some kind of multi-process thing. You can do more of the similar things at the same time, or you can try to cache so that there's more information in memory at a time.  |
| Speaker 1: | And sometimes there's just straight up faster ways of solving problems. And sometimes instead of a highly accurate calculation, you can find a way to get an approximation that's actually accurate enough for what you want to do that is much less expensive to calculate. It's really hard to tell. I guess, here's the question. Typically, when you profile, there's two pieces of the puzzle. One is what percentage of time does this take of the parent task, and what percentage of time does it take of the overall task? And so if you sort everything based on what percentage of time is the overall task, then very quickly you start to notice exactly where the bottleneck is. And that's the thing that you want to optimize first usually.  |
| Speaker 1: | So there's two steps to this. There's the profiling process, which is basically giving the data in a hierarchical format, sorted in an appropriate way so that we can actually filter these things to the top of the list and we know how to address it. Then there's the question of how do you actually optimize it? And I don't really know that I've got much more to add to any of this. So the question then becomes, the interesting thing about this is, is that this is actually the approach that I've used for the time study, which is, let me profile your time. And really, there's two helpful pieces of it. First is you actually have a grid or a framework and some level of categorization, some kind of tree structure, to outline your time. And I think it could actually be productive to convert this from a grid to a tree structure where on any given task you can break down the deeper levels of the tree structure.  |
| Speaker 1: | I'm not completely sure how that might work, but so there is this profiling, which is data collection. The way profiling works is really not that dissimilar from the 15-minute time log, which is sampling, which is, let's go see what we're doing periodically and let's just get a sense off of that. What I'm doing is a different approach, which is less accurate but still accurate enough to get significant wins from. And then there's the analysis which is basically, okay, let's sort these things based on their level of impact. And there's two resources being measured. There's opportunity cost and there's actual time spent, which is the other cost. And so we sort based on those resources, and then that's what drives the priorities of what would actually be optimized.  |
| Speaker 1: | Yeah, so there you go. There's this really interesting take on business optimization, which can be taught but feels actually pretty instinctive to me. And I don't know exactly how to quantify it. I think the example of dealing with dismissal last night at the Vacation Bible School is a good example where we are creating distinct, separate points of communication between different people, and by doing so, eliminating a lot of complexity and chaos because we were able to do that. So there you go. Interesting observations about co-optimization and business process optimization.  |
