| Speaker 1: | One of the things that's really interesting to take a look at is this whole thing of contact switching, i.e. what happens when you don't need to contact switch and you're able to actually stay in one place, there's an efficiency gain.  |
| :---- | :---- |
| Speaker 1: | So how many different contacts is somebody required to operate in? How many different types of roles are they required to operate in? How many different modalities are they required to operate? If you can reduce those modalities down to the ones in which they're most efficient, and certainly if you can eliminate the contact switching, you'll have an immediate gain.  |
| Speaker 1: | Now, you don't want to reduce contact which is over into a less efficient or less ideal scenario. This is another systems training.  |
