**Early Business**

 

My business background starts all the way back to when my father started a retail bulk food and bookstore, in rural Kansas.

Well, let's actually start even before that. First of all, let's set the stage. Grew up in rural Kansas, agricultural community, not a lot of outside money coming into the economy. A few folks there that did quite well and a lot of people there that are on the wrong end of the economic spectrum. And so for much of my life, through a variety of failed, of poor employment opportunities, agreements gone sideways, manipulative behavior, I watched my dad suffer financially because of that.

When I was in the 3rd or 4th grade, I qualified for the national state math competition. I had gotten 3rd place in two divisions in regionals. Our family couldn’t afford for me to go, and I was devastated. This was the first taste of me not being able to do something I wanted to do because I couldn’t afford it.

In addition to that, grew up in a large family. And so, one of the things my dad wanted to do was create an opportunity for his kids. So he started a retail store for selling bulk foods and started a bookstore and was able to get that off the ground. And actually was going quite well, until Walmart and the Kroger stores started moving in. Walmart started opening at Super centers, the Kroger stores started expanding and both of those moved into natural foods, which was one of my father's specialties. And he was not able to find appropriate market differentiation. And that was kind of a marked turning point in the business when it was functional but not where he would've wanted it to be.

**High School Software**

And so then because of that, so then I come out of high school and I have the unusual opportunity to start working for a company that basically builds software for Wall Street. And it was a great opportunity for that area. And for a variety of reasons, I actually ended up helping make substantial contributions to help my dad pay off my house, which I don't know that this necessarily needs to go into the biography, but it paints a little bit of a picture of the financial backstory.

And it was a career that, I worked as a software developer. It was a career that I was quite skilled at. I had been coding since I was about eight or nine years old and actually had written a computer program that I had sold prior to that, when I was in the seventh grade. And never really understood marketing and never knew how to take it to market. But we managed to sell maybe a dozen copies or so.

So I was in this career, I was good at it. People told me I was good at it. It paid better than most opportunities that I had, but I didn't enjoy it and it was pretty soul sucking. And then fast-forward to, through some years of, I don't know, wondering, exploring, trying things, got tired of not having money, went back to software development and was in this space of, if not depression, bordering on depression. It just was not working for me. And that's what eventually pushed me into business.

**Exploring Business**

I never really expected being in business, pursued some opportunities in various types of freelance roles and three to five years probably, barely paying the bills, trying to do what I can to survive financially and mentally. And along the way started moving from coding to software design. And that was one of the big shifts for me, when I realized, when I started being able to utilize my experience. And instead of needing to actually do the work, was able to design systems for other people to build.

And then on top of that, being able to work with a team member who could complement my working style very well and could flesh out all the details that I struggled to nail down. And that's when things started to shift for me. But even during that time, there were periods of, it ended up being quite a bit of a rollercoaster. There was some predominantly strong quarters, where I did really well and I got excited about it and was like, "Hey, we can expand this business, we can grow it."

And then next quarter was really tight and actually during that time probably had some of the leanest times that I've ever had in the midst of it. But the software design then expanded beyond that and basically started moving into bigger and more stable projects. And so, I think that will fairly easily dovetail into case studies.

**Difference Been Software Development (I meant coding) and Design)**

When you're building a house, there are people that you hire to frame the walls. Well, to pour the foundation, frame the walls, put in the plumbing, wire up the house, install, put the roof on, fill in the blank. That is largely the equivalent of coding.

So I suppose you could probably say software development has a fairly broad spectrum, but within that specifically, I was writing the code, doing the work. Actually, like the equivalent of hands-on swinging a hammer and door in the house.

But you also have in their plan, developers and architects. So what is a developer's job? A developer's job is to, I mean first of all, if you're looking to do more than a single house or something like that, then you want to find a location that's... Oh, this is going to be more than 90 seconds, but it's still good.

You want to find a location that has good accessibility, good, what are all the things that you need in that? You want to make sure the location's good. And then you want to start taking a look at the layout, of how these things are all laid out. And then you get down to the individual houses. When you're designing a house, then you want to know what is it going to be used for? Is it a one-off custom home for somebody who's got specific needs, or specific interests? Is it a spec house that's going to be used for repeatedly across multiple times, or repeated, replicable?

I guess that's the right term for spec house. I don't even know. I'm kind of ignorant. But that's the idea of architecture. So, once you have the blueprint and the plan, then you got to have somebody to manage the budget, make sure things happen on time, on schedule, on budget. And you got to have people who are actually swinging the hammer to build it.

And the management side and the swinging the hammer side, the management and coding and software, was by and large the place where I suffered the most and struggled the most. Now in some situations, depending on the project I was working on, there are some projects that I absolutely loved coding. So it just depends a lot on the style of work that I'm doing. But the type of work I was doing, that was where the struggle was.

And so what I went from, was actually doing the work, to writing the lines of code, to let's take a look at the big picture, let's understand what the needs are, let's understand how the pieces need to be arranged and then what needs to be done from you. The equivalent of where the rooms and what needs to be done to be able to take this to completion. So that was the shift.

**Wins for Myself – The Kind of Work**

So, let's see, wins for myself have been, one of the major wins for me has been finding work that doesn't feel like work. Somebody has once defined retirement as doing what you want to do, with the people that you want to do it, when you want to do it. And...

And so I'm not at a place that I can NOT work, but I am at a place that the work that I need to do, that I can get paid for those, for that type of thing.

And so, that's a huge win and it has a compound effect because when you are doing that, you love it, you want to do it, you're motivated to do it, you put yourself into it, you're naturally good at it. And it's the classic thing of, you're not trying to take something that you're a three at up to a five, you're taking a seven up to a eight, nine or 10\.

**Wins for Myself – Raised Fees**

And so because of that, the second win has been, it's allowed me to continue raising my fees and what I charge. And be able to provide an income, make up some of the difference for all the times my wife has had to say no to all kinds of things along the way, to get to where we're at today. And in addition to that, one of the wins for myself has been shifting from, there's been two shifts that I've made. One is shifting from strictly, I've mostly made, thinking about my work in terms of hours and dollars per hour to value-based work. That's shift number one. And what's the value and contribution of the work that I'm doing and charging based off of that.

**Wins for Myself – Retainer Engagements**

Number two is, shifting from per project engagements, to retainer based engagements, where I negotiate monthly fees for access to me, for access and work. All that comes with it, without needing to negotiate what exactly it is. Specifically without needing to negotiate on a per project basis, if it's basically ongoing, longer term work.

**Wins for Myself – Working on More Important Parts of Client Businesses**

And three, being able to move from less consequential parts of the business, to more consequential parts of the businesses I work with, all of which have been wins.

 **Family**

My wife and I have been married for over 10 years.

I need to see how much of this my wife is comfortable having online – but my wife and I did foster care for 9 years, ended up adopting 5 kids – we were one of Colorado’s adoption families of the year in 2020\. We’ve got a kid of our own on the way.

Family is a big part of my life – eating dinner together every night, going on walks, playing tag / catch with them in the backyard, jumping on the trampoline, one of them loves going to work with me and rearranges/cleans up my office, they help me clean my office. Evenings are usually reserved for family. Saturdays are usually family day, as well.

**Some personal interests beyond business**

* Faith is a really big deal to me , but to be honest, I don’t talk about it much because I’m too liberal for the Amish (who I work with), too “charismatic/spiritual” for the Mennonites (who I work with), and quite a few people who walk about faith among the “English” are using it for their own gain (and I’ve had plenty who’ve touted their faith and have been nothing short of abusive). So if it’s integrated, it’s gotta be done tastefully.

* I dabble in psychology (even got certified in the Kolbe index)

* I’m a tea drinker – my latest kick is loose leaf earl grey

* I love taking walks in the mountains, or hiking mountain trails. I enjoy biking but am not a hardcore mountain biker.

* I am absolutely a philosopher at my core.  
  (Still set \+ interest, but have had multiple people tell me I think more deeply about things than most people they know)
