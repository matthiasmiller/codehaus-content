    - *Family is a big part of my life – going on walks, playing tag / catch with them in the backyard, jumping on the trampoline, one of them loves going to work with me and rearranges/cleans up my office, they help me clean my office. Evenings are usually reserved for family. Saturdays are usually family day*

  - Some personal interests beyond business  
    - *Faith is a really big deal to me , but to be honest, I don’t talk about it much because I’m too liberal for the Amish, too “charismatic/spiritual” for the Mennonites, and anyone who talks about faith among the English is using it for their own gain (and I’ve had plenty who’ve touted their faith and have been nothing short of abusive) –*
