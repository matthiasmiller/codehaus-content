Someone asked this question:

> Title: How to “Tell a Story” in excel
>
> I work in FP&amp;A and parse through a lot of raw data to make it accessible to CFO and CEO. What I’m really lacking is the ability to “tell a story,” with the data. Meaning I always have an excessive amount of tables and I’m not great at highlight the top / most important pieces. Any one have great tips and tricks or videos / online classes that can help me improve this part of my job?


Here was my response:

> Some great answers here. The biggest thing is being able to translate it to the real world (or really, the CFO and CEO's worlds). If you don't have the context you need yet, spending some time learning the business (can be as simple as talking to people) can be incredibly useful.

> If you want specific areas to drill into, you can start by asking how the data relates to:
> 
> \- Specific things the CFO/CEO are specifically looking to confirm or deny, especially if anything specific triggered this deep dive  
> \- Current company objectives  
> \- Standard management KPIs (industry-specific or otherwise)  
> \- Day-to-day operations  
> \- Financial performance such as profitability, cash flow, revenue, valuation  
> \- Outliers within the data (especially when you slice it in different dimensions)
