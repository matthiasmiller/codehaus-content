Here was my response:

> Any company that does this but doesn't continue investing money into it on an ongoing basis is going to experience ongoing issues. Microsoft would often overlook small vendors because they wouldn't charge the required ongoing maintenance. I don't know if this was the case, but it's a real thing.
