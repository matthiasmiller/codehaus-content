Here was my response:

> I've been involved in successful rollouts of custom ERPs, and these are the traits that made it work well:  
>   
> \- Clear business process, or an internal stakeholders to help it get there  
> \- Reasonable pacing (always do lowest effort, highest return first). This helps substantially with learning the requirements, design, &amp; change management process.  
> \- Get visionaries out of the room after it's getting started, at least until you've built the core functional needs  
> \- Use a good stack for performance &amp; reporting  
> \- Use a team, not a freelancer  
> \- Ideally, find someone with experience in manufacturing &amp; software engineering  
> \- Ideally, push Excel as far as it can reasonably go first

> The one thing that I would add - I know two companies, both dropping a little over $1MM on this problem. One of them did a custom NetSuite implementation over 1-2 years, and they're still upside with almost nothing but heachaches for their efforts. The other one spent about the same of money over probably 5-6 years on a custom solution and have tools that I would guess are better than most in their (pretty small) industry.
