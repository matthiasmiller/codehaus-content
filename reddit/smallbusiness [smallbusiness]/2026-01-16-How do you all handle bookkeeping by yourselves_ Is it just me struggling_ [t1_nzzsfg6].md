Someone asked this question:

> Title: How do you all handle bookkeeping by yourselves? Is it just me struggling?
>
> I’m a **US based** solo female business owner doing all my own bookkeeping and it’s honestly *draining* me ??.   
>   
> I use QuickBooks for tracking, but between categorizing transactions, reconciling bank accounts, and making sure I didn’t screw up the taxes, it feels like a lot. Hiring an accountant is out of my budget right now (tiny business, every dollar counts).
> 
> I’m curious - **how do other small business owners manage your books each month?** Do you use spreadsheets, software, a part-time bookkeeper, or some other hack? Are there certain tasks you’ve found ways to automate or simplify?
> 
> I keep thinking “there has to be an easier way” but maybe this is just part of the grind of being an owner ??. Would love to hear your experiences or tips. What’s the **hardest part** for you, and how do you deal with it?
> 
> (Not looking for tax advice specifically, more about the day-to-day bookkeeping process and keeping sanity.)

> Thank you!


Here was my response:

> Well, \*\*IF\*\* this is actually true... the real problem is that you're going into saas underfunded (or you jumped into an empty swimming pool and are trying to find water), and you should find your cash cow (or other capital) first so you don't have to pinch pennies for bookkeeping.
