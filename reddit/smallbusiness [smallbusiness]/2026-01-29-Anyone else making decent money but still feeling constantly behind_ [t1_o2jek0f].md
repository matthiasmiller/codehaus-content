Someone asked this question:

> What finally helped me wasn’t budgeting or tracking every dollar.  It was separating money by purpose and doing a short weekly check instead of reacting to whatever the bank balance said that day.

Here was my response:

> For me, it's always been about the systems...  
>   
> For example, building the business around systems for predictability. Cash flow doesn't have to be consistent (although that's obviously nice!), but it does need to be predictable. And when it's disrupted, you ideally build it so you have plenty of room to respond to business &amp; market needs. If you build your system around these ideas, then you simply double down on the lead metrics &amp; everything else will works out.
