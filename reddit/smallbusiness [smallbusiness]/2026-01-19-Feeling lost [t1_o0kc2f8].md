Someone asked this question:

> Title: Feeling lost
>
> Hello everyone,
> I run a small pest control company on the Gold Coast (Australia). I started it from scratch and have built it to a point where it has a decent reputation. I am good at my job and have good rapport with my clients.
> 
> I feel like I have hit a roadblock. I am a one-man band and don’t see how I can progress. I can’t employ staff to help and grow because, realistically, I can’t afford the wages. There is also a big shortage of decent staff, and at the wage I could offer, it wouldn’t really be worth it once you factor in another ute, equipment, insurance, and other costs.
> I can’t employ anyone in the office either, as that would be a financial cost I really couldn’t afford. Taxes, BAS, and all the other expenses baffle me, and I struggle to see how I can move forward, or whether it is even worth it. I pay myself a very low wage, but there are perks such as a company car, phone, and flexibility with my kids, which is a big plus.
> 
> Lately, I’m starting to feel resentful towards the business. I’m getting to the point where I don’t enjoy dealing with everyone’s problems, and sometimes when the phone rings, I don’t want to answer it. Doing reports at home and trying to keep up with social media, software, and accounting feels like it is all piling up, and I just feel lost.
> 
> While I do enjoy the job itself, it is a lot of responsibility, especially with termite work and pre-purchase inspections, for not a lot of reward other than flexibility. In this day and age, that doesn’t feel like enough. The financial pressure is creeping in, and I am feeling very lost.
> 
> I don’t want to fail, but I am struggling to see a way forward.
> 
> Any advice would be appreciated. Has anyone been in a similar position, and if so, what did you do?
> 
> Has anyone left their business and been happy about it?


Here was my response:

> Too little detail to tell, but there's also a chance that there's an upstream problem, such as no established credibility &amp; value proposition in the local market -- leading to difficulty setting proper prices.  
>   
> ETA- Although admittedly, if the labor pool is small &amp; you're one of few people willing to do it, the u/Common-Sense-9595 advice makes sense ;-)
