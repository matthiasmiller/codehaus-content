Someone asked this question:

> Title: How do small businesses decide when it's time to hire a CPA instead of handling finances themselves?
>
> I run a small business and currently manage most of the accounting and taxes on my own using software and basic bookkeeping. As the business grows, I’m starting to wonder at what point it actually makes sense to bring in a CPA.
> 
> For those of you who’ve made that transition:
> 
> * What signs told you it was time?
> * Was it about revenue, complexity, taxes, or something else?
> * Did it save you money or mainly reduce stress and risk?

> I’m trying to understand what triggers that decision for most small business owners. Any real-world experiences would be helpful.


Here was my response:

> I knew it was time when I saw the tax savings -- I don't know specifically when but probably when I cross $200-250k in revenue. I hired an accounting firm / tax strategist, and it was worth it for that alone. They know the ins &amp; outs of compliant tax savings as well as audit triggers. The additional advice I get from them is just a bonus.

> I used a slipshod bookkeeping firm for a few years, and just recently discovered they had failed to write off about $16k of expenses. I'm almost certain they substantially underbilled some of my reimbursable expenses from one of my clients, but it's too late to go back and clean it up. They may have been well-intentioned but they were some of the most unorganized people... NOT good to have in your books.

> Unfortunately, I was too focused on other things, and recently really dove in to find profitability of different product lines. Nobody else cares about you making or losing money on parts of your business than you. I also regularly prune expenses. Lots of stuff accumulates for no reason at all. Running lean is under-rated.
> 
> The decision for you depends on two things, IMO:
> 
> \- What do you WANT to do in your business based on your goals? If finances are fun for you &amp; you're happy with that in light of your goals, there's no rule you need to hand it off.
> 
> \- Can you outsource finances &amp; put your time back into higher-value activities for your business? This is a simple ROI question.

> Hope this helps.
