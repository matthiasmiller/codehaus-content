Someone asked this question:

> Title: Credit card processing
>
> I'm sick to my stomach looking at money lost in 2025. Hoping you folks might be able to help me figure this out. 
> I've had heartland credit card processing for 5 years, always have been happy with them. It appears this year they were bought by global Payments. My processing fees have always been around 4%. In 2025 the fees were around 9%.
> We also switched to their pos system 2 years ago also, so not sure if we're somehow locked in with them now.
> very unhappy with the major fee increase.
> A little about the biz
> -brick and mortar retail and service
> -average transaction is about $70 I'd guess
> -600k -800k in credit card sales a year.

> Any help is much appreciated
