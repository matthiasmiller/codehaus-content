Someone asked this question:

> Title: How do you actually know if your cash flow is "healthy"?
>
> I had a small question for the other small-business owners here.
> 
> How can you tell whether your cash flow is good for you?  
> Is it your accountant, reports, spreadsheets, or just checking your bank balance and crossing your fingers?
> 
> I sometimes come across businesses that make decent profits but are still suffering monthly anxiety. Are you curious what signals you trust the most?


Here was my response:

> Three things:  
>   
> 1. 13-week cashflow forecast  
> 2. Monitoring the leading metrics that put cash in the bank  
> 3. Fixing any issues that arise from that (cutting costs / growing revenue)
> 
> That's it.
