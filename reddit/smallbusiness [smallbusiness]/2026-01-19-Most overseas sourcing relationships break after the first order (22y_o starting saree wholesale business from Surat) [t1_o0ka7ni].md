Someone asked this question:

> Title: Most overseas sourcing relationships break after the first order (22y/o starting saree wholesale business from Surat)
>
> I grew up around the saree manufacturing side of Surat as my father works in one surat's of the best saree dyeing mill from years and over the years I’ve noticed something interesting.
> 
> Most overseas buyers don’t lose money on the first order.
> They lose it on the second.
> 
> Samples look great, first shipment is fine — and then finishing, consistency, or timelines quietly slip once volumes increase.
> 
> Because my father has worked inside one of Surat’s established saree mills for years, I’ve seen where this usually breaks down on the factory side — not because of bad intent, but because systems aren’t built for repeat export buyers.
> 
> I’m now trying to build a small wholesale operation backed by manufacturing access, with a very boring goal:
> make reorders less stressful than first orders.
> 
> I’m curious to hear from:
> 
> - retail store owners
> 
> - importers / distributors
> 
> - anyone who sources textiles internationally
> 
> ?? What has been the biggest issue you’ve faced after the first successful order?
> Quality drift? Communication? Timelines? Something else?
> 
> Trying to learn before scaling anything.


Here was my response:

> This is an indirect answer to your question...

> Do you already have customers? Isn't the easiest way to just create that standard, create a process of proactive communication after they receive an order to make sure you hit the standard, then just start proactively &amp; aggressively solving any operational issues internally that keep you from getting a high NPS scores (or whatever mechanism you use)?
> 
> Then, just pace your growth. If this is as big of a problem as it sounds, just tell them, "We're only taking on X customers / month, because this is such a priority to us." As you get these issues ironed out, you can start increasing the quantity / speed of onboarding.

> It seems like a simple yet powerful systems / measurements / management play.
