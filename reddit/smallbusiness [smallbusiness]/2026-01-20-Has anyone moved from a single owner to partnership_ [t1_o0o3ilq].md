Someone asked this question:

> Title: Has anyone moved from a single owner to partnership?
>
> Wondering what the process would look like for switching to a partnership instead of single owner. Or just what partnership businesses look like? The financial aspect is what confuses me more then splitting responsibilities.
> 
> I have a small business, two storefront locations. Right now they are mostly running with minimal involvement from me. And I’m debating selling, or bringing in a partner but wasn’t sure what that would look like/entail
> 
> If it’s relevant the business does 400k+ in sales a year, currently low product margin but that’s because I’m paying for employees instead of running things myself. The potential partner would be a current employee


Here was my response:

> Observation: I've seen far worse than 12.5% to 17.5% net profit on "low margin" and "mostly owner absent" businesses.
> 
> Three questions for you:
> 
> 1- What problem are you trying to solve with the partnership?  
> 2- Is this the best way to address that problem?  
> 3- What specifically would the employee bring towards solving that problem?
> 
> Partnerships bring their own headaches. I'd want to make sure it's actually worth the headache, because it's not a magic pill. However, it's not possible to give direction without understanding what problem you're solving.

> Your employee is still going to want to eat. It might make your net profit look better if they're taking distributions instead of wages, but it doesn't give you more cash flow in the business.
