Someone asked this question:

> Title: Increasing productivity - New laptop. Laptop + tablet or 2 in 1?
>
> I own a small roofing business in Europe (Slovenia) and looking to grow. I need to optimise my bidding technique and my old laptop is struggling with more than 3 PDF files at once. I still work on the roofs untill I train a team that can handle themselves so my office time needs to be low but efficient. 
> 
> Roofing in my market seems more complicated compared to North America where they do mostly asphalt shingles (frowned upon roofing material in Europe). That is why I think I need a laptop/tablet for presenting different options when making a bid, carrying all the printed booklets looks archaic and its a hassle.

> Anyway I am thinking:
> 
> \- buy a separate laptop for office work and + decent tablet for presenting/bidding to customers. 
> 
> \- buy a 2 in 1 laptop and just carry it with me all the time.

> I am budgeting at about 2000€ (when I buy I dont buy cheapest).

> I kind of don't like the idea of unplugging my laptop everytime I go out to a customer and bid our services.


Here was my response:

> I have a desk with a 4k screen, keyboard, mouse, headset, and a laptop stand for my MacBook with ONE cord that I need to plug in for docking. If I want to duck out, I have a single cord to unplug and I'm gone. Same when I get back into the office -- the cord's right there. I plug it in and I'm good to go.

> Personally, I like the fact that I always know where everything is, and I never have to think about, "Did I save? Did I send it to myself? Do I have my password to log in?" If I have it on my laptop, I have it.
