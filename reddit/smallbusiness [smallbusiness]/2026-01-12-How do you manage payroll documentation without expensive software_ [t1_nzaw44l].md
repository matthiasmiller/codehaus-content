Someone asked this question:

> Title: How do you manage payroll documentation without expensive software?
>
> I run a small business and struggled for years with messy payroll records and audit stress.
> 
> I ended up simplifying everything by using basic Excel sheets instead of software — tracking hours, overtime, and weekly summaries in a very straightforward way.
> 
> I’m curious how other small business owners handle payroll documentation without expensive tools.

> What works for you?
