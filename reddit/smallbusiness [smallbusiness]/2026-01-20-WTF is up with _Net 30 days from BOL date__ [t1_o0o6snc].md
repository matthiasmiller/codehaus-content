Someone asked this question:

> Title: WTF is up with "Net 30 days from BOL date"?
>
> Here is the reality of "Net 30 from BOL date" in international trade:
> 
> I ship the goods on Jan 20th. But I don't get the Surrendered BOL for another 2-3 weeks because of how the buyer manages the booking.
> 
> The 30-day payment period doesn't even begin to count until mid-February. By the time I actually see the payment, it’s late March or even early April. This means there is essentially no upper limit on the payment deadline.
> 
> Normal trade terms we’ve experienced include balance payment against invoice, OA 30 days against invoice, or Net 30 days against invoice. However, Net 30 days from BOL date is absolutely disgusting....


Here was my response:

> Might as well start a bank lol ...
> 
> You doing this for all your buyers, or you just had one who was aggressive in their negotiations??
