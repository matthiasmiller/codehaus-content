Someone asked this question:

> Title: Curent CFO thinking about starting a back office outsourcing business
>
> Looking for opinions here. I'm the CFO of a medium sized company in a large US metro. I noticed that one problem virtually companies we deal with have, is that running the back office is a ton of work and costs a lot money. So naturally, the smaller the company the more disorganized the back office. You can buy the services you need from different places, bookkeeper, project manager/admin, marketing etc. All of it via different agencies.

> When I worked in Fortune 500s, we had access to outsourcing providers that would provide us with a ton of resources on demand. But small businesses don't have access to this, they can barely hire 1 admin.
> 
> So I've been thinking, what if I offered a fixed price service to run someone's entire back office incl. supplier, employee, IT  etc. You'd get a dedicated person/team that fractionally works on your things when you need them.

> Has anyone had experience with a service like this? Was it valuable?


Here was my response:

> One of the ways one of my colleagues approached this was having a hiring process for these individuals who are basically "administrative jacks-of-all-trades" placed primarily as part-time roles. It's a one-time hiring fee for the small business, but at employment rates.

> Also, makes you wonder if there's a reason that size &amp; organization are correlated? ;-)
