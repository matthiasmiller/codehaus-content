Someone asked this question:

> Title: Do companies/individuals actually shop their electricity supplier in deregulated states? Curious what your experience has been.
>
> I’ve noticed most companies/individuals either don’t know they can choose their electricity supplier or assume switching is always a scam.
> 
> For those in NJ, PA, MD, IL, DE, CT, OH, ME, NH, etc. — do you actually shop your supply rate, or just stick with the utility by default?
> 
> Curious about two things:
>      •     Have you ever switched, and was it worth it?
>      •     What percentage savings would make it worthwhile for you to switch, assuming people are almost always leaving money on the table by not shopping around?
> 
> Not promoting anything — just trying to understand how people think about it.


Here was my response:

> (thinking hat) This seems like a great question for the broker. How do they determine which opportunities to pursue and what's their compensation model?
