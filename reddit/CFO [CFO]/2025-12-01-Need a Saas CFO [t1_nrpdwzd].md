Someone asked this question:

> Title: Need a Saas CFO
>
> I have been in business for over 24 years.  I have not been able to get strong financial support from a CFO that understands my niche in the past.  I have had CFOs but they are not universal.  From my experience, you cannot get a manufacturing CFO to translate over to construction.  Started a Saas company and need someone that knows the niche.  Looking to connect with someone that will talk me through finding a great fit with a Saas CFO.


Here was my response:

> This would be helpful to explicitly clarify. Also, good point... fundraising is as much sales &amp; marketing as it is finance, and the fundamental premises of S&amp;M apply (know your audience &amp; what they want, and having a compelling offer beats pretty slides, etc).
