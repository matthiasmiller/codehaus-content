Someone asked this question:

> Title: How much effort to put into an indirect spend dashboard?
>
> Multiple data sources (HR, ERP, Excel, travel provider) each produce their own dashboards but none show the full picture.
> 
> Is there value in bringing it all together under a PowerBI layer? Or is this a prestige project that sounds good but won’t actually be used to control costs?


Here was my response:

> Excellent feedback already... I will echo by noting that the fewer numbers you have to chase &amp; pull together, the more you can simplify what is 'winning vs. losing', and the more you can pull people towards a shared goal, the better...
