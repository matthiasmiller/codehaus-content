Someone asked this question:

> Title: Why finance teams disagree on revenue even when the data is correct
>
> Over the past few years I noticed a pattern across companies that were trying to improve reporting. Leadership assumed they had a dashboard problem or a data quality problem, but the real issue was that everyone was using different definitions of the same metric.
> 
> A simple example is revenue.
> 
> Finance counts revenue when it is recognized.  
> Sales counts revenue when the deal is signed.  
> Operations counts revenue when the product is delivered or project milestones are hit.
> 
> None of these are wrong. They just serve different decisions.
> 
> The problem is that all three metrics are often labeled as "Revenue" in reports, board decks, dashboards, and models. Then people spend whole meetings debating whose number is correct when really they are answering different questions.
> 
> What helped move teams forward was separating one canonical metric (Total Revenue) from its contextual views:
> 
> * Booked Revenue (Sales)
> * Recognized Revenue (Finance)
> * Fulfilled Revenue (Ops)
> 
> Once teams labeled these clearly and documented how each was calculated, arguments disappeared. People stopped trying to "fix reporting" and instead used the right metric for the right decision.
> 
> The interesting part was that nothing changed in the tools. The alignment came from definitions, not software.
> 
> Curious how others handle this.  
> Do you define multiple revenue metrics formally or treat them as one?


Here was my response:

> I'm assuming by revenue you mean shipments? If COGS is the only thing that matters, they can cut all workers down to part-time and cut costs by not providing benefits, increasing margin. It's a silly example, but it demonstrates that cost is not the only factor at play here.
