Someone asked this question:

> Title: Should capital investment hurdle rates reflect RELATIVE risk vs alternatives?

> I am a pioneer in Environmental Management Accounting since 1993 at the Washington Dept of Ecology.  I have worked with thousands of business managers since then to help them reduce cost and risk with sustainability strategies and cleaner tech.  I have always been frustrated by their evaluation of more sustainable alternatives.  They use the same hurdle rate for all alternatives.  But in fact most capital investments to improve business sustainability are really to reduce risk.  Markets are clear:   Higher risks deserve higher hurdle rates.  Why are CFOs not doing this for capital investment alternatives when reduced risk between them is obvious?   Not doing so actually subsidizes higher risk!   I realize that determining alternative discount and ROI rates is hard.  But subsidizing higher risk is stupid.  Prove me wrong?


Here was my response:

> This is intriguing to me. It's fascinating that so many of them made good sense even with the 3-year hurdle, but the 3-year hurdle deterred the proposals.
