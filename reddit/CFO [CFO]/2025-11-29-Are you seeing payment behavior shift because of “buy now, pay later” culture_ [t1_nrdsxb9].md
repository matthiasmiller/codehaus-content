Someone asked this question:

> Title: Are you seeing payment behavior shift because of “buy now, pay later” culture?
>
> Feels like over the last few years, everything has turned into some version of “buy now, pay later.”
> 
> It started in e-commerce with Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm, etc., but it feels like that mindset has crept into B2B, too.
> 
> Customers take longer to pay, push for extended terms, treat Net 30 like a suggestion, and sometimes act like deferring payment is the new normal.
> 
> For folks who’ve been in finance long enough to see the before/after - Have you noticed payment behavior shift since BNPL blew up?
> 
> Are customers slower across the board?
> 
> More comfortable carrying small balances?
> 
> More likely to delay because everyone else does?
> 
> Just curious how this looks from people who’ve watched the landscape change over the years.


Here was my response:

> Isn't this the natural outworking of the Pareto principle -- that a certain segment of people (sellers) become increasing capable of extending credit, and a certain segment of people (buyers) fall further down the curve?
