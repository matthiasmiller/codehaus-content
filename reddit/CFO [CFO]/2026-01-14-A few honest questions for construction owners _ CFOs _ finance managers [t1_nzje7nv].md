Someone asked this question:

> Title: A few honest questions for construction owners / CFOs / finance managers
>
> Which causes you more stress today: cash flow visibility or payroll accuracy — and why?
> Have you ever had a profitable project that still created a cash crisis?
> What do you currently rely on to understand your next 30–60 days of cash? (Excel, gut feeling, accountant, something else?)
> If you could remove one financial headache permanently, which would you choose — and what would that be worth to you?
> I’m not selling anything — just trying to understand where the real pain actually lives.
> Would really value perspectives from people who’ve lived this.


Here was my response:

> Yes, I find the human element continually being the biggest issue. ;-)
