Someone asked this question:

> Title: Business leaders—what data do you wish you had better visibility into?
>
> Curious what keeps executives up at night from a "I don't have good data on this" perspective.  
>   
> Is it operational efficiency metrics? Customer behavior patterns? Where money is actually going? Something else entirely?  
>   
> I feel like companies collect tons of data but decision-makers still end up making calls based on gut feel because the data isn't accessible or trustworthy.  
>   
> What would make your job easier if you just... had it in a dashboard you could actually rely on?


Here was my response:

> Just curious, is this because you're not tracking the leading indicators, or because you can't access them to get them in the dashboard?
