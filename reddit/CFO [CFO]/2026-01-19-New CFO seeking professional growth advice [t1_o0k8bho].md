Someone asked this question:

> Title: New CFO seeking professional growth advice
>
> I’m looking for some input on professional development and next steps. I’m in my late 30s and spent a little over 10 years in post-acute care operations. I later earned my CPA and joined an accounting firm, where I primarily worked with healthcare organizations. After about four years with the firm, I accepted a CFO role with a company that owns and operates multiple post-acute care providers. 
> 
> Our prior CFO was in the role for more than a decade and recently moved into a CFO position with a larger healthcare organization on the acute-care side. Seeing that transition has made me think more intentionally about my own long-term growth.
> 
> I know this is a broad question, but I’d appreciate any advice on how others have approached professional growth at this stage. Whether through additional credentials, certifications, executive education, or involvement in professional organizations. Any perspectives or recommendations would be appreciated.


Here was my response:

> Just one person's observation, but looking back, my network + tactical, brass-tacks skills are almost always what got me in the room I wanted to be in. All of the other things (people skills, strategic &amp; critical thinking skills, dealing with trauma &amp; doing therapy, resilience, etc) were the things that kept me in the room. It let me be the sane voice when other people were going crazy. Not easy. Not an immediate ROI. Not something that's ever worked well for me to lead with. But in my experience, immensely useful.
