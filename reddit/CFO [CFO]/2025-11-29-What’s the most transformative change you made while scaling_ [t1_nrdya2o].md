Someone asked this question:

> Title: What’s the most transformative change you made while scaling?

> What’s the most transformative change you’ve implemented in your Finance organization as your company scaled?

> This could be a process, technology, something else. Curious to hear others experiences.


Here was my response:

> I've heard so many things..isn't this very specific to the company? Just some examples from friends &amp; clients alike:  
> \- staying on top of receivables  
> \- controlling expenses  
> \- raising prices  
> \- better financial reporting  
> \- incentive program in production

> I think this is often indicative of the current team's weaknesses at prior levels, that must get addressed in order to scale.
