Someone asked this question:

> Title: Value of Finance Role in a Nonprofit With a For-Profit Subsidiary
>
> I’m curious to hear from other nonprofit CFOs. I’m currently CFO at a small NGO with a for-profit subsidiary LLC, and I’ve realized that the CEO and Board don’t really value the finance function. There’s ongoing resistance to adding finance capacity even when it’s clearly needed, and financial work is often pushed onto non-finance staff. As a result, the CFO role becomes underutilized - stuck in day-to-day execution rather than operating at the right altitude to guide revenue, cash flow, and expense decisions, which feels particularly problematic in a mixed nonprofit/for-profit structure.

> I’m in the process of exiting, but I’m wondering if anyone has successfully navigated this kind of dynamic without leaving. More broadly, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern where organizations that sideline their CFO/finance function often regret it later, usually once issues emerge that could have been avoided with earlier strategic focus.

Here was my response:

> It's a small sample size, but the organizations I've seen successfully navigate this were ones with strong chair leadership, along with board members who ran bona fide businesses and were there for more than just networking &amp; status. In one case, the executive director &amp; chair became incredibly intentional to get the right proxies and board member nominations in so they could improve the quality of board membership.

> As stated, it's certainly worth being extremely clear why the finance function is important. If that doesn't work, the surest, shortest path I've found is to step back, let them learn from their own experiences, and be available to help them when they're ready.
