Someone asked this question:

> Title: Dealing with reactive CEO
>
> What are your experiences on working with reactive CEO? I have most often worked with CEOs who are quite coherent and have professional behavior with whom it’s easy to solve problems together.
> 
> During recent engagements I have been working with CEO who is rather reactive if any issues are brought up. This makes it rather tiring to bring up any potential items that might require more focus as it often results in burst of monologue from the receiving end. Luckily it calms down quickly and is not directed at me but it still does not feel productive or make me feel comfortable even though have developed quite thick skin during my career.


Here was my response:

> I've always ultimately walked away from this kind of leadership. I find that leaders who are reactive and emotionally unregulated throw shade on the entire culture, and it's very difficult for other leaders around them to counteract that. Also, it slows everything down to a snail's pace, and in my experience, its hard to feel good about the work you do when you know your productivity's being throttled back.
> 
> Bluntly said, I think life is too short and skillset too valuable to be wasting it under poor leadership. The fact that you feel uncomfortable despite your thick skin is worth paying very close attention to.
> 
> In my experience &amp; observation (me &amp; others), the temptation is to be lulled to sleep by the paycheck, the role, the hope for change, and more. However, if the CEO is surrounded by people who cover for their reactivity, it's almost impossible for enough light to shine on the issue for meaningful change to happen. Most people are loathe to fix problems before a high threshold of pain, and often it's easier to find a new opportunity rather than address.

> My mentor once asked me a perceptive question after I walked away from a situation like this. He asked me, "If you leave money off the table, how do you feel about moving on. Hands down, it was a 9 out of 10. Not every story ends well, but for me, it opened the doors for my next opportunity. Today, I'd expect I'd be more resilient, but I still doubt I could have stayed long-term.

> We all have different tolerance levels for reactivity. You need to know and find yours. Hats off to you for asking this question..it's a good one. If you do end up moving on, having great friends &amp; colleagues in your corner make a world of difference.
> 
> I'd love to hear any thoughts that you have, as well as opinions from others (agreeing or disagreeing). I think it's a great question &amp; an important one.
