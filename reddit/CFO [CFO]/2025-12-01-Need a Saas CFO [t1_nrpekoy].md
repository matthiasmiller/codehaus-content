Someone asked this question:

> Title: Need a Saas CFO
>
> I have been in business for over 24 years.  I have not been able to get strong financial support from a CFO that understands my niche in the past.  I have had CFOs but they are not universal.  From my experience, you cannot get a manufacturing CFO to translate over to construction.  Started a Saas company and need someone that knows the niche.  Looking to connect with someone that will talk me through finding a great fit with a Saas CFO.


Here was my response:

> I've got a colleague of mine who's exceptional at hiring senior leadership team members. Biggest thing is calling out what will get high-performers to show up &amp; work for you so you get quality applicants. Message me if an intro would be useful.
