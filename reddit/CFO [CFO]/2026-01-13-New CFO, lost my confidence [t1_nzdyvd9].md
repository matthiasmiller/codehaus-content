Someone asked this question:

> Title: New CFO, lost my confidence
>
> I moved into a CFO role about a year ago. It was a stretch role for me which I knew, but was encouraged and even asked by the CEO to pursue it. 
> 
> A year in I am struggling with my confidence. I used to never hesitate to speak up or be decisive and now I find myself doing both. How do I stay in the know enough without overstepping, how do I keep my head up and maintain being an authority on certain matters while sometimes fumbling and having to acknowledge there is so much I haven’t learned yet, and keep up with learning while also trying to look ahead and demonstrate my abilities. 
> 
> I do have a few mentors so am covered there. My boss is supportive and patient. I work for a large nonprofit ($65M revenue with 30%+ growth planned in the next 5 years) so it’s a decent scope but I know nonprofit culture is its own thing compared to other sectors. 
> 
> CFOs who can be kind and have been through this, did anything in particular help restore your confidence? I want to stay humble enough to learn and accept the needed guidance without losing my edge as a frankly highly essential leader for our org.


Here was my response:

> Who are the peers in your corner that you can vent to, dialogue with, and bounce ideas off?
