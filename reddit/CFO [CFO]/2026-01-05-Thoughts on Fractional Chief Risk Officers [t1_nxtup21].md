Someone asked this question:

> Title: Thoughts on Fractional Chief Risk Officers
>
> First time posting, thanks for having me! I am considering setting up a side hustle as a Fractional Chief Risk Officer (currently an executive coach specializing in the intersection of risk/change/program management) however I can not seem to find a group of people working in this area. When I talk with SBs and Mid size biz, it is clear to me (I may have spent too long being a CRO ??) that they could benefit significantly from a Chief Risk Officer's guidance on Strategic Enterprise Risk Management (less compliance more strategic risk taking). Maybe Fractional Chief Risk Officer is the wrong title and this work would fall under another title?

Here was my response:

> Only to add... Just be mindful that you have to sell what they're willing to buy. It's possible that they'd rather pay for a fractional CFO with a focus on on risk management, rather than fractional CRO, especially in the SB space.
