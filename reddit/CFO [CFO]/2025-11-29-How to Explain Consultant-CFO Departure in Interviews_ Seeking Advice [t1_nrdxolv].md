Someone asked this question:

> Title: How to Explain Consultant-CFO Departure in Interviews? Seeking Advice
>
> \## TL;DR
> 
> I was consultant/CFO for a PE-backed buy-and-build for 2 years. Delivered operational improvements but the business underperformed investor expectations due to management team misalignment and integration challenges. Investor decided to make leadership changes.   
>   
> Now interviewing for CFO/M&amp;A roles in similar PE situations but different industries. How do I frame this professionally in interviews?
> 
> Issues with the business:  
> 1. Very aggressive business plans and budgets that were never met  
> 2. Overly focussed on M&amp;A and failed to integrate acquisitions and reap scale benefits  
> 3. Very high holding costs of almost 10% of sales which ate up most of operating subsidiaries profits  
> 4. Lack of alignment within management team which was also expanded from 3 to 5 individuals (consensus decision making meant that decision making was very slow)
> 
> In hindsight things I could have done better:  
> 1. Failed to build relationships with other managers which then later made it difficult for me to convince them to make necessary structural changes  
> 2. Difficulty in engaging with the investors on these issues as the management team wanted to speak with a unified voice.    
> 3. My background was mainly from PE, commercial banking and restructuring, so I had actually never been a CFO before.  
> 
> Personally I feel I was partly blamed for problems I could not solve on my own, although with the benefit of hindsight there are several things I could have handled better. 
> 
> I really enjoyed the opportunity despite it being frustrating at times, how to best explain why I left and now looking for a new role thereby putting myself in the best positive light?


Here was my response:

> Yes. Or also consider finding a great therapist who can help you tease apart your part of the responsibility, and possibly the leftover guilt you feel from having been the scapegoat within the organization. This seems to be more of a question of how to mentally detox than a tactical question of how to express it.

> I might be misunderstanding where you're coming from, u/FarArachnid7859. If this is a tactical question, just acknowledge your responsibility, recognize that it was two-sided without throwing anyone under the bus, and recognize the lessons learned that you will be taking into the new role.
