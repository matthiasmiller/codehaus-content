Someone asked this question:

> Title: Who has a Financial Dashboard
>
> What information is being captured, is it used daily and what was used to create the dashboard?


Here was my response:

> There are so many toolsets. Pick a toolset based on the rest of your stack, or just find someone reputable to choose one when they build one for you (with caveats). I can chat about it more if you like.
> 
> First piece of advice is to keep it simple, and to focus on a few core metrics per department:
> 
> \- Marketing - $ / contacted lead and % of Revenue  
> \- Sales - fantastic if you can get your sales manager to keep an eye on a dashboard of salesperson behaviors  
> \- Ops - depends on your industry; for one manufacturer, we were able to drive almost everything off Raw Material as % of Revenue. This was the fastest way to predict healthy pricing.  
> \- And of course anything you want related to financial health (free cash, cash flow velocity and/or AR, 13-week forecast, etc)
> 
> Second piece of advice: what's the biggest blindspot that keeps biting you all? Build the dashboard for that. I always liked to solve for highest priority, real problems first. Stop the bleeding. Then, you can get further into preventative measures.
