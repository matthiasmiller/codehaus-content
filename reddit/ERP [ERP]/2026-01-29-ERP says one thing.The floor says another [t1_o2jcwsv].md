Someone asked this question:

> Title: ERP says one thing.The floor says another
>
> Most days, ERP feels like something we updated after decisions are already made. Planning changes, grade swaps, rush orders none of that waits for the system.
> 
> Someones's spreadsheet ends up being the source of truth and ERP is there so finance doesn't yell.
> 
> Is this just how steel works everywhere or have people actually made ERP useful day-to-day planning?


Here was my response:

> Hats off to you ... this is a major undertaking. I've been involved in a similar project for the past 3 years, and it's incredible to finally be able to see the fruit of it all coming together.
