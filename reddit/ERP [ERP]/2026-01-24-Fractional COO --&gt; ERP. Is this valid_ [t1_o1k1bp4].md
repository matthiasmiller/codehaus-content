Someone asked this question:

> Title: Fractional COO --&gt; ERP. Is this valid?
>
> For years, the narrative has been simple: you're either big enough to afford a full-time COO, or you're stuck wearing all the hats yourself.
> 
> But something's shifting.
> 
> The fractional COO space is exploding, and most entrepreneurs in the services industry still have no idea it exists. I've watched this unfold over the past few years, and the gap between what's available and what business owners *think* is available is staggering.
> 
> **Why the blind spot?**
> 
> Most SMB owners assume executive operations leadership is reserved for companies doing $50M+. They've never seen a viable middle path between "solopreneur chaos" and "hire a $250K executive." So they limp along, brilliant at their craft but drowning in operational dysfunction—firefighting instead of scaling.
> 
> **What's actually happening:**
> 
> The fractional COO market is growing at \~30% annually. Service-based businesses (agencies, consulting firms, professional services) are discovering they can get strategic operations leadership at a fraction of the cost, exactly when they need it. Usually that sweet spot is $1M-$10M in revenue where systems are breaking but margins can't support a full-time executive.
> 
> **The trajectory is clear:**
> 
> Just like fractional CFOs normalized over the past decade, fractional COOs are becoming the expected path forward. The businesses that figure this out early are scaling cleanly. The ones that don't are hitting the same ceiling repeatedly—great at delivery, terrible at operations.
> 
> If you're a fractional COO, you're riding a massive wave that most people can't even see yet. If you're running a service business and things feel chaotic despite your revenue growth, this role exists specifically for you.
> 
> The question isn't whether fractional COO services will become mainstream. It's whether you'll discover them before or after your next painful growth plateau.


Here was my response:

> Great point. I had one client obsessed with tech but with team members actively sabotaging and undermining the mission, and wouldn't do anything to fix the problem. Free ride for the problematic folks in the company! But tech was going to fix it!
