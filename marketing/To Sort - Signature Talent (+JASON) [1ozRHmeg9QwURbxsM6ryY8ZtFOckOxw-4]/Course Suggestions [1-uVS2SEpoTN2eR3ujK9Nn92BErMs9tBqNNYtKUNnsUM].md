Speaker ideas

* Matt Yoder \- SC  
* Rick Rhodes

We could start a podcast on the phone system. Could get different speakers. The listeners would pay a monthly fee to listen, or we could sponsor ads. 

From Matthias:

* Kent Lapp? \- **There are a fair number of people who aren’t too pleased with his business dealings over the past few years. Not sure what this would do to our reputation. I have a few reservations about him….**  
* Richard Miller  
* Leon Yoder  
* Sarah Fisher \-- really want her input on unity, etc  
* Roy Herr

Could be used for networking with influencers

Could record in video and make it available in other formats

Could associate fax numbers with accounts \-- to get worksheets, or even print-only materials

Making it appeal to the Amish

* A platform they’re familiar with (phone and fax)  
* The speakers and collaborators would be important (if we can get endorsements from people that they trust, and names that they recognize and trust)  
* John Lapp may be a good resource in this…
