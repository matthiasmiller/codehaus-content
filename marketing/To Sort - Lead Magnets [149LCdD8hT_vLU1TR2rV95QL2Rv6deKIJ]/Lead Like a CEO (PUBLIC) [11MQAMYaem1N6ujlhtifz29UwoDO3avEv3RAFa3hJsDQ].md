# **Lead Like a CEO**

## A definitive guide to leading your fast-growth business like a highly effective CEO \- even if you're not a natural leader.

Paul’s voice dropped on the other end of the line. “I need to figure out a way to do less,” he confessed, recounting his plans for the new year.

He’d hit roadblocks with his first business. The second business he’d spun up wasn’t going as well as he expected.

His tone revealed his stress and personal burnout.

“I’m not good at running a company,” he admitted. “I’ve thought about selling my first business. Some days I wish I’d be a crew foreman on the job, doing the work.”

As I listened to Paul’s story, I heard the story of hundreds of others as well.

* “My business grew too big too fast.”  
* “I didn’t get into business to do everything I’m doing right now.”  
* “I’m not sure how I got my business here, or what to do to keep it going.”

Those doubts are actually quite *normal*. You may have had the same thoughts, feelings, and doubts yourself. It’s not enough to ignore the voices. You must cut through to the root of those doubts.

You may have heard the adage, “**What got you here won’t get you there**.”

While it's true, it also embeds a deep-seated lie that will sabotage your business. We’ll get to that in a minute.

Let’s start with the truth:

You face these challenges because nobody gave you the tools you need.

This article covers those tools. Highly effective CEOs rely on these 3 pillars to simplify their lives and leadership. You, too, can experience these benefits by using these tools.

It starts with how you look at your world.

## **Priority Pillar 1:** Proper Perspective

Paul knew he needed to change something in his business. He didn’t know what. He was too close to the day-to-day operations to see what was *really* going on.

His team bombarded him with one problem after the other. His phone buzzed from early morning to late at night.

Whenever he took time off the business, he had to play “catch up” or “fix-it man” when he got back.

He was “stuck in the weeds” of his business. To borrow a popular adage, he was working “in his business” instead of “on his business”.

This is the difference between a **tactical focus** and a **strategic focus.** Tactical focus is looking down at your feet as you climb a mountain. Strategic focus is taking in the 30,000 foot view.

In the early phases of your business, tactics make or break it. You are a master of your craft. You learn the business from top to bottom. You know how to do every last thing.

Small businesses lift off the runway through a tremendous amount of hard work. Tactics are the engine that propels the plane.

However, Paul couldn't fix his frustrations with a tactical focus. That perspective blinded him to both threats and opportunities. If he saw them, he saw them too late. He needed a strategic focus.

Highly effective CEOs allow time to think about the crucial questions.

They allow themselves a broad perspective. They ask long-term questions. They're willing to leave the specifics of the implementation to others.

This is how they give themselves a pay raise.

One decision to tap into a new market can generate millions of dollars over the lifespan of the product. One decision to drop a failing product line can save hundreds of thousands of dollars.

This is how highly effective leaders increase the value of their time by 10X, 100X, or even 1000X. It allows them to break through revenue ceilings.

Paul started to look at his business with a strategic focus. He realized he needed a second pillar to keep growing.

## **Priority Pillar 2:** Problem Prevention & Predictability

With the proper perspective, it didn’t take Paul long to recognize the issue. His team and customers were eating up his time. He had accidentally become the biggest bottleneck in the business.

In the early days, it was easy to correct problems that arose. If a customer was angry, he picked up the phone or went on-site, had a brief conversation, and resolved it.

As his business grew, he didn’t have enough time to check in with everyone. He couldn’t keep track of everything that could go wrong. He barely had enough time to address the issues that arose.

This is where many business owners get stuck. They are too busy fixing problems to start actively working to prevent them.

Highly effective CEOs recognize this pattern. They start injecting predictability into the day-to-day of the business.

They learn to rely on systems to create predictability. The tactical parts of the business begin to run like clockwork and automatically prevent problems before they arise.  As a result, highly effective CEOs experience a measurable boost not only in profitability but also in peace of mind.

They take time to create the right systems. This way, their team members actually *embrace* them instead of fighting them. Otherwise, the team performance and morale would drop *lower than before*.

As Paul looked at his business, he realized he needed a third pillar to use these systems.

## **Priority Pillar 3:** Powerful People

Paul recognized he needed his team to buy into the systems he wanted to create. To do that, he needed to further shift his focus.

In the early days of his business, he did everything. He focused every day on the work itself. As he hired team members, he handed off specific pieces to them.

He made them responsible for tasks, but he watched over their shoulder to make sure they completed them. He wanted everything done right.

Highly effective CEOs do not focus on the tasks and projects. They focus primarily on the **people** they need to achieve those outcomes.

They don't solve problems by working harder. They solve them by finding the right people.

They understand people's value. They understand what motivates them. They understand how they naturally behave. That's why they can create systems to serve the people who are working in the business. They understand systems must always evolve. This allows them to create systems that are flexible, adaptable, yet effective.

They go beyond mere system-building to culture-building. They instill culture that encourages the right attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.

They create an empowering environment for high-performing teams. Team members take ownership of their responsibilities. Accountability is within the fiber of the business.

Highly effective CEOs choose their people with care. Because of that, they instinctively trust the people around them.

What if they had chosen the wrong people? What if they had failed to empower them? What if they had not supported them well? These leaders would have crippled themselves with a deep mistrust in their team.

These leaders will fight to protect their instinct to trust others. They do that by knowing and understanding how people work best.

Highly effective CEOs shift their primary responsibility away from completing tasks and projects. They focus on finding, developing, and leading a handful of critical team players.

They surround themselves with the right people. They make sure these people can be wholly trusted. They make sure these people align with their role and know how to do it.

As they do that, they shift into the fourth gear. They let out the clutch. They press their foot to the gas pedal. They increase the speed of their leadership while lightening their load.

Paul recognized what he could achieve in his business using these pillars. He hadn't realized exactly how much his lack of tools was costing him.

## **The Million-Dollar Price Tag You Don’t Know You’re Paying**

The biggest price tag in Paul's business was one he didn't know he was paying. He needed these pillars, and he needed to fit them all together.

They needed to fit cleanly, like a puzzle. Avoiding any of them would make his business inherently harder.

* If he avoided PROPER PERSPECTIVE, he would execute on well-intentioned but ineffective actions. He might seize opportunities that look profitable but aren’t. He'd overlook the opportunities hidden within his business.

* If he avoided PREDICTABILITY AND PROBLEM PREVENTION, the constant firefighting would overwhelm him. He would lose the predictability he needed to scale his business. He'd continue being the limiting factor in his business.

* If he avoided POWERFUL PEOPLE, he would keep hitting the limits of his own performance. He would sabotage the very foundation his business stood on. The “people issues” would continue to come back to bite him, costing him a lot of time, money, and headache.

The difference between a right and wrong focus for Paul meant the difference between:

* Making or losing money  
* Fulfillment or burnout  
* Family peace or family tension  
* Team members staying or leaving  
* Having a business he was proud of, or one that he despised

The cost of these decisions easily has a million-dollar price tag. The truth is, “What got you here won’t get you there.”

Unless it will.

Even though I’ve shown you how that statement is true, I’m also going to show you how it’s **blatantly false**. Most people will never admit to you that **what got you here MUST get you there**.

Here’s why.

## **The 2900-Year-Old Reason You’re Actually Successful**

The answer isn't in the fad of leadership books and lessons. Many coaches will ignore the 2900-year-old reason that you’re successful. The truth is this:

**Your business success is a direct reflection of your Signature Talent**.

Solomon himself wrote, “Do you see a man who excels in his work? He will stand before kings;

He will not stand before unknown men.”

You’ve used your special gift, unique knack, and signature talent to grow your business.

That Signature Talent may involve sales, management, or craftsmanship. It may include your special attention to detail. It might be your ability to read people. It might be the way you can build exactly what people visualize.

That Signature Talent is your key to your business growth. You might change how you APPLY it. But you can NEVER change the fact that this is the secret to your success.

As your business has grown, it now requires new talent to run. That doesn’t mean that YOU need to provide that talent. You might change your role in your business. You might choose to keep it the same.

But you dare not neglect your Signature Talent to do it.

**Focusing on your Signature Talent turns your leadership upside down. Embrace it, and you'll become more fulfilled and productive over time.  Ignore it, and you'll burn out and self-destruct.**

Your Signature Talent is a crucial key to unlocking fulfilling business success.

Let me share my story with you to show you exactly how much this can help or hinder you.

## **“I felt like an unproductive idiot for years.”**

When I was 8 years old, I typed my first line of code into a computer. I quickly became fascinated with the world of programming.

I sold my first copy of software to a law firm in Wisconsin when I was in the 7th grade. When I graduated from high school, I began working for a software development company.

As a teenager in a rural community, I leapt at the opportunity.

It didn’t work as well as I had hoped. My managers and peers recognized my clear skill. I was quite *good* at what I did. I still have a raving endorsement from my boss to prove it. 

**I hated almost every minute of it.** Nobody understood why.

On one specific summer day, I brewed a cup of freshly roasted coffee at my office. I carried it downstairs and paced the arctic-chilled basement, thinking about my situation.

That day, I drew a line in the sand. I resolved that I would find the answer, or I would die trying.

That journey took me across the globe into a foreign culture and language. It landed me in a small tech community in the prison capital of Colorado.

Along the way, I studied coaching and psychology. I paid business coaches and consultants to work with me. I worked in groups and one-on-one.

Slowly, I started to peel back the layers. What I found surprised me.

I discovered the same thing that made me brilliant at software also made me hate it. I was brilliant at the big picture. I knew how to fit pieces together into a coherent whole. My design skills had a level of elegance and congruence most developers dreamt of.

Nonetheless, I hated spending my day writing that code.

Without trying, I started helping my business colleagues with this Signature Talent. They told me how I “pulled them out of the weeds” and helped them “work on the business”.

I still didn't recognize this as a Signature Talent.

That changed one winter day. I sat in a glass conference room on the 5th floor of a downtown Colorado Springs office building. A StrengthsFinder consultant sat around the corner from me. She pointed to my top 5 strengths. My jaw dropped. **My** **top 5 interests were all strategic**.

I began to pay *very* close attention to this.

I started listening more closely to my clients and colleagues. I paid attention to my experience. I had spent years honing my “systems thinking”.

When a mentor recommended a book on business systems, I took for granted how quickly it “clicked” for me. I immediately saw how to apply what I learned in software to businesses.

I took it for granted, that is, until I heard what my clients and colleagues were telling me. “You’ve got a strong, analytical mind.” I started to watch my business become more predictable and enjoyable. I assessed and diagnosed problems, then **put the supporting systems in place**.

I found myself walking into new situations. Almost immediately, I could see what systems to create.

I had gotten these insights by going deep down the rabbit hole of human motivation and behavior. I hired coaches who *specialized* in business relationships and team development. I befriended mentors who were exceptionally skilled in working with people.

As I applied what I learned, I watched my team become more engaged. I watched them knock it out of the park. I watched people close to me get out of challenging situations. I watched doors open as they finally tapped into their Signature Talent.

I'd been learning and growing. I'd even gotten certified in the Kolbe index. I still took this for granted.

I finally asked my friends (a second time) what I’m better at than most people. To my shock, they told me. “You make the people around you feel understood and heard.”

For the first time in years, I traveled back to an award ceremony in the second grade. I sat in the third row of the auditorium. My teacher called me to the front. She presented a certificate recognizing my sensitivity to other people.

That’s when I realized that **my deep interest in how people work** wasn’t something I had merely learned. I'd had that Signature Talent within my DNA from the very beginning.

As I reflected on my life, I realized this: I had spent most of my life outside of my Signature Talent.

I felt like a spelunker coming out of a dark, oxygen-starved cave. The sky was blue. I could run. I could jump. I could finally breathe.

I deliberately moved into that unique zone, and I'm not going back. Now, I’m extending that invitation to you.

## **An Invitation to an Experience You Will Not Forget**

You might be like Paul.

Paul never really wanted to be a CEO. He got into business because he loves to work in the business. It was actually a relief for him to hear that his Signature Talent isn’t being the CEO.

No shame in that.

In fact, it’s HONORABLE that he’s willing to recognize it. And it doesn’t mean he has to sell his business.

He simply needs to shift his focus from “how” to “who”. **Who can he rely on to fill in those gaps in the process?**

The Priority Pillars in this article are more than just ideas or concepts to me. They are the foundation of my Signature Talent. They are built into my DNA.

They’ve been the source of most of the breakthroughs I've helped my clients experience. For example:

* A construction company decided to shut down an entire division. This freed them to focus on the part of their business that WAS working. They've been experiencing explosive profit since.  
* A property management company learned how to entrench themselves into their local market. They lowered the cost of operations and leads. As a result, they're creating an almost impenetrable moat against the competition.  
* A software company implemented a specialized sales process. Because of this, they've rightfully earned deep respect from their prospects. They're becoming a clear leader in their market. They've been breaking their previous deal size limits.  
* A medium-sized fintech company needed to bridge the growing rift between departments. I spearheaded a company-wide initiative to help departments work together more easily.

I can't claim credit for these successes. At the end of the day, my clients are the heroes who have put in the work.

I do know, though, that my Signature Talent played a clear part in each of their successes.

I also know that this Signature Talent is deeply core to who I am. In any situation, I will help people with strategy, systems, or people. It's who I am. It’s etched into my DNA.

I’ve struggled for years to explain what I do. I've fought for years to defend what I do. The truth is, once my clients experience me, they stop caring about that.

That’s why I’ve stopped explaining what I do. I’ve shifted to two carefully created experiences**:**

1. The **Signature Talent Experience** captures the lessons and insights from my *expensive and challenging* journey. It condenses them into laser-focused personalized coaching that removes you from cycles of failure. It sets you on a path to stand before kings (and queens\!).

2. The **Lead Like a CEO Experience** is the undiluted, full-concentrate form of the Priority Pillars. Through a dynamic coaching partnership, you will build the environment around you that protects your Signature Talent. This way, you can continue to grow your business without making it harder on yourself or your team.

Which experience is right for you depends on you, your business, and your goals.

I want to invite you to Coaching Session Zero with my colleague Jason Eby and myself. We will walk through your business, your challenges, and your goals.

We’re committed to *only* invite people who would clearly benefit from these experiences. If not, we’ll point you in the direction you need to go.
