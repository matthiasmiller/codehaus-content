# **“Is Custom Software Right for Me?”**

## The Decision Making Habits of Highly Successful Business Leaders

When people begin looking for business software, they are sometimes intimidated by the scope of the decision that they’re making.

It’s understandable. For many businesses, it’s a substantial investment of time and money into their business. For some, it’s intimidating to start a process when they can’t see the finished product.

Our solutions advisor Ian and our senior solutions specialist Matthias recently discussed how to help people make **higher quality decisions**. This isn’t even about persuasion, because our goal isn’t to sell custom software to everyone who reaches out. Our goal is to make sure the right people get the right solution.

As they reviewed our conversations over the years, they began to recognize specific decision-making patterns of the most successful business leaders. These leaders made consistently **higher quality decisions** than other business owners we spoke with. Their success reflected the quality of their decisions.

To be clear, these patterns will not specifically lead you towards software. They will lead you to a **higher quality decision** for yourself and your business.

## Habit 1: Shared Ownership, Respect, and Responsibility

The most successful business leaders have wanted to work together with us to make the right decision. This requires mutual respect to be effective.

People who come to us view us in one of two ways:

1. As bricklayers  
2. As engineers

We can easily tell how they view us by the language they use. If they see us as bricklayers, they’ll say, “We know the exact features and functions we want the software to have. We need you to build it like this: \_\_\_\_\_.” Or if they have an existing system, they’ll say, “We want it built just like what we have, but we want you to make these changes: \_\_\_\_\_.” They will then show us their current system and ask, “Can you build this?”

If they view us as engineers, they’ll tell us, “We have an idea of what we want, but we need your help to get what we need.” Or if they have an existing system, they’ll say, “We’d like to replace the current software we have, and here’s why: \_\_\_\_\_. We need your help figuring out how to build software that helps us \_\_\_\_\_.”.

When people reach out to us as “engineers”, they’re able to broaden their understanding of what they have, what they need, and where they can go. We understand that they are the experts in their business. Meanwhile, they recognize that we have extensive knowledge in software design that they can rely on.

This way, they can ensure that they’re making the decision about the **right thing**. The solution they’re considering might not be the most effective solution. Here are two examples:

**The Bricklayer**: One business owner approached us from the “bricklayer” perspective, dictating how we should build the system. We quickly understood that we’d end up replicating his existing software, flaws and all. Even though his business would benefit drastically from better software, he missed the opportunity to grow his business. It’s like a homeowner paying a builder to tear down his existing house and build an identical one, only so that he could add a few desirable features.

**The Engineer**: On the other hand, another business owner (with a very similar business) came to us with a similar request. However, he had an openness to rethinking his approach. We helped to fix some fundamental issues with his original software, creating a runway for him to continue to build out systems as his business grows. This is like a homeowner who decides to build a new house that is based on what he needs, both now and the future. He works with an engineer to design a house that fits the needs he has.

This also has far-reaching implications for the actual development of the project. The primary benefit of custom software is that it’s well-designed, fits your business, and is a joy to use. When clients view us as bricklayers, they almost always miss this primary benefit.

In addition, they end up overpaying for their software solution. A skilled engineer can evaluate the needs, the opportunities, and the upside to make wise decisions as we design and build out the software.

This leads us into the second habit of our most successful prospects.

## Habit 2: Investment or Expense

When we looked at our conversations with successful business leaders, we realized people had one of two perspectives regarding software. They either view it as:

1. An expense or  
2. An investment

Our most successful clients look at it as an investment. They view it as a business tool that will help boost their productivity and profitability, the same way they view a piece of equipment or property. When they evaluate the software project, they are looking at three things:

1. The bottleneck in their business  
2. The opportunity of removing the bottleneck  
3. The solution that can bridge the gap

Within that context, they make an informed, intelligent decision for their business. If it has a clear payoff, they move ahead. If not, they put it on hold.

When business leaders view it as an expense, they don’t evaluate it in the context of their business, their bottleneck, or their opportunity. They evaluate in the context of **alternative solutions**.

They’ll find 2-3 other options, then will evaluate them based on price. However, when they compare based on price, they often lose sight of the real reason they’re buying the software--to solve an underlying business problem. The “less expensive” solution is sometimes effective. However, it just as frequently misses the target of what they were hoping to accomplish. Later, they must circle back and pay MORE to fix the problem right.

Maintaining the investment perspective allows you to decide whether this opportunity will have the right payoff for you. This allows a wise, informed decision that’s based on risk and clear upside.

This leads us into the third habit.

## Habit 3: Distracted, Reactive, or Proactive

The most successful leaders had a unique timeline of the problems they were focused on solving. As we looked back over our conversations, we found the business owners we spoke with were on one of three levels:

1. Distracted \- unsure where to focus; creating more problems than they solve  
2. Reactive \- know where to focus; solving problems from the past  
3. Proactive \- know where to focus; solving problems for the future

Our most successful leaders have consistently been proactive.

The primary job for a distracted business owner is to find out where to focus. Otherwise, any activity will create more problems than it will solve. When you know where to focus, you can start actively solving problems that will move your business forward.

A reactive business owner should do whatever he can to get out of reactivity. Custom software can be immensely helpful for someone in this condition. However, it will almost always be more challenging, more lengthy, and more involved than anyone anticipates. The problems that have accumulated didn’t arise overnight, and they can’t be solved overnight.

**From Reactive to Proactive**. After implementing custom software, one of our clients began to implement lean manufacturing into his business. This was something that he had no mental capacity to implement before custom software.

The most powerful place to be as a leader is being proactive. The best time to create a crisis plan is before you need one, and the best way to deal with a crisis is to avoid it altogether. Proactive leaders are able to look down the road, anticipate challenges they’ll face, then begin proactively solving those problems.

Proactive leaders are almost always looking for ways to offload their responsibility and replace themselves. Many times, custom software becomes a critical piece of allowing them to do that.

Proactive leaders always make **higher quality decisions**. And if they choose to move ahead, the higher the likelihood of a successful project.

## Making a Decision

As you review these habits, it’s important to remember that we are all at different stages of growth and development as business leaders.

If you find yourself short of where you want to be, this is not a condemnation. It’s simply an invitation to who you are becoming.

The **most important thing** is that you take the right next step, no matter how big or small. This might mean beginning to consider the possibility of a software project. It might mean that your biggest priority may be to get clarity on where your business is and what it needs.

Regardless of what you need, we want you to take the step that’s best for you. If we can help you, we’re happy to do so. If not, we can point you in the right direction.
