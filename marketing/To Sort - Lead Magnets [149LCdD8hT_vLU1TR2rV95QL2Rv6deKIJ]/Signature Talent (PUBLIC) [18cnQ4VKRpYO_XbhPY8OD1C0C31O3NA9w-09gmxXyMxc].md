## How the Highest-Performing Business Leaders Get the Most Done with the Least Effort

Every business leader knows the dreaded feeling.

You wake up each morning in a fog of focus. From the first minute in the office (sometimes before\!), you’re assaulted with interruptions and distractions. Running the business feels like a marathon through mud. By the time you reach the end of the day, you collapse in an exhausted heap.

And then, there’s the *other feeling*.

You roll out of bed with energy surging through your blood. From the moment your feet hit the floor, you’re cutting through the noise. Even though the challenges exist, you’re slicing through them like butter. The tide turns in your direction.

The question is, “How do you spend *more* time in the second space, and *less* time in the first?”

This article is my answer to that question.

Most productivity training focuses on the *tactics* of productivity, such as how to delegate, plan, and execute. This article is going to take you to the *foundational principles*. These are the shifts of perspective that are key to bending time in your favor.

And the first one starts by breaking a myth.

## Your Disproportionate Advantage

Averages lie.

 In any situation, a few factors have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of all aspects of life. Your ability to recognize these factors is a critical skill for high productivity.

Take, for example, the sense of personal fulfillment you experience on a weekly basis.

Every week, you’re likely to have a handful of experiences that remind you of the real reason you do what you do. It might be a conversation with a team member. It might be a check you get to write to charity. Once a month, you’ll have an experience that’s unusually meaningful.

You’ll also experience some moments that make you doubt why you do what you do. Even when you’ve gone out of your way to support your team, someone still complains about a change that you’re making. In fact, once a year, you might hit a particularly dark spot that leaves you tempted to throw in the towel.

You might rank your personal fulfillment as a 7 out of 10\.

Yet the average hides the fact that you have moments you’d rank 11 out of 10 if you could. You have other moments that you would rank below 0 if you were allowed.

Averages lie because they hide the true leverage points. Those “11 out of 10 moments” reveal where you have a **disproportionate advantage**.

This doesn’t only apply to personal fulfillment. This applies to every area of life. When you begin to recognize it, you will weaponize your focus.

It will bring clarity to you in two areas:

1. It will reveal things about yourself. It will show you your most powerful skill set and your most fulfilling work. You will recognize your highest-value contribution.

2. It will also reveal things about your business. It will show you what’s working and what’s not working in your business. It will point to advertising, employees, products, business locations, and more.

It will reveal the places you have (and should leverage) a disproportionate advantage both in your personal or business life.

Choosing to double down on **disproportionate advantage** and letting go of **disproportionate distraction** is enough to create a dramatic shift of momentum for most businesses. Many times, this requires careful thought and execution. However, investing time into solving this is one of the best investments you can make.

This is not something you do when you have the luxury of extra time. This is what you do to GIVE you that luxury. If you are overwhelmed, overworked, or stressed out, one of the best things you can do is give yourself a break. Stop the work of *doing* and step into the work of *thinking*. Rest is an accelerant for clear thinking. You’ll find that as you step away, you’ll gain critical perspective that’s not possible any other way.

As you begin to see the world through these lenses, you’ll start to experience the compound effect of momentum. By getting rid of the things that slow you down, you can stop wasting resources getting “caught back up”.

It’s impossible to overemphasize the importance of this perspective. It applies in *all* areas of life \-- physically, spiritually, emotionally, mentally, financially.

When you understand **disproportionate advantage**, you begin to understand your personal signature talent.

## Your Personal Rhythm

Recently, my friend pointed out the evolution of author Tim Ferris’ books. Tim's book, *The 4-Hour Work Week,* became the blueprint for those who wanted to model his pattern for success.

Nine years later, Tim released another book entitled *Titan*. It revealed the habits of highly successful people. For one person, the secret to success was to wake up at 5 AM every morning and stick to a strict morning regiment. For another, the secret was to never show up at the office before 10 AM.

What’s clear is that **each person has their own rhythm for success**.

In fact, many leaders start off by trying to become like a certain role model. They’ll model how they think, act, and talk in hopes of experiencing the same successes. It is the leader’s good fortune when this begins to break down. They’re forced to reckon with the fact that they’ll never measure up to someone else’s standard.

They’ll have to measure up to their own standards. They’ll finally surrender to giving themselves permission to **do things their way**. When they do that, they’ll go on the hunt of finding their own personal rhythm.

This takes the leader down the path of deeply understanding themselves. 

This means understanding what motivates you at the deepest level. It means tapping into how you instinctively take action. It means understanding your strongest skill sets. It also means developing skills and aligning them with who you are to create a disproportionate advantage. 

It’s a process and journey of discovery. And it’s a road to sustainable, powerful momentum.

But there’s only one way to get there.

## Your Exponential Environment

The great lie of high performance is the **myth of the self-made man**. It’s false. Every highly productive person is tightly integrated into an environment that supports them.

It’s not hard to understand why it’s so important.

1. **Genius leaves gaps**. If you’re exceptionally talented in one area, you’re likely to have deficits in another area. And it’s only through relying on other people’s skills and talents that you can offset that.

   In fact, research has proven that the success of an endeavor can be predicted by the composition of the team that surrounds it. (You can ask about the tools we’re certified in using to examine these factors.)

2. **Connection creates momentum**. We are hardwired for relationships. Even without the transference of skills, the simple decision to surround yourself with supportive relationships will give you an immediate boost in your performance. We draw energy from other people.

Many leaders get stuck because of their environment. It doesn't support their growth and forward progress.

Having the support of either Genius or Connection will help you significantly as you move forward. However, if you manage to get *both*, you’ll experience exponential progress.

Here’s why.

The goal of leadership is not to find and apply answers. It is to become the answer. It is to close the gap between what we call “head knowledge” and “heart knowledge”.

Head knowledge is about the **transfer of information**. It is the facts, research, and insights to solve the problem in front of you.

Heart knowledge is about the **transfer of identity**. It is about shaping and molding you into the kind of person you need to be for the task at hand. While it includes the transfer of information, it is about engraving what you need to know at your very core.

Reshaping your identity is one of the fastest paths to transformation. And this is the very foundation of transformational leadership.

This is one of the most underrated and undervalued aspects of business leadership. It’s rarely pitched or sold because its results are so hard to quantify. And yet, it has a palpable impact on your culture and team performance.

## Your Personal Trifecta

For the past few years, I’ve searched for high performance that doesn’t sacrifice myself, my team, or my family. What you’ve just read are the foundational pieces of that hunt.

These principles have allowed me to *substantially* increase my efficiency in business. One of my team members recently told me, “A minute with you is like an hour with most people.” It was then that I realized how much my efficiency had changed. I was also reminded of the importance of intentionally slowing down at times for the sake of others.

The question remains, “What will you do with your signature talent?” You have a personal trifecta that centers around:

* Your Disproportionate Advantage  
* Your Personal Rhythm  
* Your Exponential Environment

Each of those areas are unique to yourself and to your business.
