# Escaping the ERP Inferno

**WARNING: The information in this report may be emotionally disturbing for those who’ve walked through an ERP inferno**. The author is not responsible for any triggering memories of software projects gone wrong.

Last night one of my friends recounted a tragic manufacturing bankruptcy story. Angry customers. Hate mail. Staff members grilled for the owner’s contact information. Employees walking out with large pieces of equipment.

Quite a few things went wrong. I couldn’t avoid zeroing in on one piece that seemed absolutely avoidable to me. **The piece of software that should have shown them what they needed to know**.

In fact, I couldn’t sleep last night. This story put me over the edge...because it’s only ONE of many stories I’ve been hearing over the past number of weeks. I couldn’t stop thinking about the many other people, just like them, who are going through the same stories. 

Let me share a few of these stories:

* **Leaving Operations in the Dust**. The CFO researched multiple ERP systems before leaving the company on good terms. The owner hired a CEO, who made a decision on the ERP based on a national brand and a personal bias towards sales. After they’d made the decision and rolled out the ERP, it didn’t integrate well with operations. The employees in operations hated the software and didn’t want to use it.

* **Personal Call from the CEO**. The company purchased an industry-specific ERP. In the words of the owner, the software is “mediocre at best and has a lot of glitches to it. It looks very user friendly, but when you start editing/working in it, it's not.” He’s written many emails to support asking for changes. He received a personal call from the owner himself. However, none of the changes are “cost effective” for the vendor. The customer support, so strong in the beginning, faded out over time. They began to cycle through one representative after another.

* **3 Years to Fulfill a 6-Month Promise (They Think)**. The company purchased an industry-specific ERP. The software vendor promised a critical feature “in 6 months”. Three years later, there’s no sign of the feature. The vendor signed on more users than their infrastructure can support. The users regularly see a “spinning throbber of death”. The company needs to periodically refresh the page and restart their data entry. The vendor is unable to accommodate the company’s needs.

* **Issues Are Coming Faster Than They’re Resolved**. The company purchased a retail ERP. However, they ran into a lot of problems. The promised integrations didn’t work. The vendor promised to make customizations for the company. The customizations ended up incomplete or not working as expected. In the owner’s words, “Issues are coming in faster than they are being resolved.”

These were only SOME of the stories that have come to the surface.

At the end, each client totaled up the bill for:

1. The upfront cost  
2. The subscription fees  
3. The required upsells for additional modules  
4. The consulting fees to take the software live  
5. The hours of team payroll required to make the transition  
6. The hours of productivity lost in the lack of performance  
7. The opportunity cost of not having had the RIGHT solution in place

And…

This doesn’t include the cost of starting the whole process all over again to do it right.

Running down this path and back again EASILY cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Someone led them down...

## The Road that’s Paved with Good Intentions

Let’s face it: every industry has its dirty little secrets. The things that nobody wants to talk about or address.

And it’s not to say that it comes from evil intentions. In fact, sometimes it comes from the BEST intentions.

Manufacturers aren't always armed with the weapons of insider knowledge.

Let me walk you down the road that’s paved with good intentions.

## Paving Stone 1: Buy a Tactical Solution to a Strategic Problem

The first problem appears the moment someone begins to shop for an ERP solution. Implementing an ERP is a tactical solution.

It’s a boots-on-the-ground decision.

Our most successful clients start at a much higher level--the *strategic* level.

That level requires examining the business from a different vantage point. While our best clients eventually needed an ERP, they needed to focus first on their systems.

An ERP enforces and strengthens systems. It can't compensate for poor or missing systems.

If you don't clarify your systems first, you’ll sabotage your rollout from the very beginning.

You’ll also end up making a second, equally critical error.

## Paving Stone 2: Assume the First Layer of Need

Most times, the issue at hand is not the most critical issue. To paraphrase the mindset of Bluefisher Steve Sims, each problem has three layers:

1. What people THINK they want  
2. What people think OTHERS think they want  
3. What people ACTUALLY want

It takes a thoughtful, effective, and skilled vendor to help clients extract their true need from the engagement. Without that, they’ll slap a bandaid on a broken arm because “it’s hurting” and hope the pain will go away.

But because you’re in intense pain, you willingly follow them to the next paving stone.

## Paving Stone 3: Fit Your Problem to Meet Your Solution

It’s impossible to truly understand what you need from your ERP until you’ve clearly defined and clarified your manufacturing workflow, your specific processes, the individual accountabilities, and the actual metrics that are critical in running the business well.

If you don’t have this clarity, you’ll begin conversations with ERP vendors and suddenly discover software *features you’ve never considered* that point to apparent deficits in your operation.

After all, they have a very specific product to sell. They can only  onboard you by proving your problem meets their solution.

Truth be told, sometimes it’s a complete match, and occasionally it’s a complete mismatch.

Most times, it’s only a partial match to your *real, underlying problems*.

This has no guarantee that it’s actually a meaningful need for your business. Without strategic clarity, you’ll sway in a direction that's unhelpful or even harmful for the business.

As you discover all of these things that you COULD be doing, you’ll start to encounter a sinister lie.

## Paving Stone 4: Doubt Yourself as the Expert In the Business

In one of the first ERP nightmare tales, the owner made a decision to hire a CEO that didn’t understand his business. He trusted the CEO to make a decision for the best of the business.

True discernment in business comes down to:

* Recognizing when others know and understand things you don’t  
* Recognizing when YOU know and understand things others don’t

It means being able to read people’s bluffs, or sometimes, their intensely stated but deeply under-informed opinions.

You know, the people blowing smoke because they’ve got something to gain--either for their personal ego or their personal benefit.

True humility comes down to embracing reality. It means knowing the things you’re absolutely certain about. It means being willing to learn from the people who are clear experts in their specific arena.

At CodeHaus, we have a specific mantra for “trial runs”. If you can't discern an individual's true expertise, use trial runs to mitigate your risk. Eventually, you’ll tell whether their advice is sound or not. Humility won’t resist it, but ego will.

Once you doubt yourself as the expert in your business, you’re about to put on the first pair of shackles.

## Paving Stone 5: Commit First, Figure Out Later

Many vendors are incentivized to get you to ink the contract. It’s good for driving topline revenue and client retention metrics. By the time a client has made the transition, it’s excruciatingly painful to transition elsewhere.

However, it doesn’t drive customer satisfaction.

In fact, I’ve had quite a few individuals come to us, hanging their heads, explaining that they took the sales professionals at their word. They believed the marketing. But when the product was actually delivered, it didn’t meet their expectations.

Instead, it was slow. It didn’t have the features they needed. It didn’t fit into their workflow.

But the client had already signed the contract. They could try salvaging the monthly fees by using the software, or they could helplessly watch the debits from their bank account, month after month.

Once the vendor received the contract, the customer support dropped off. The requests for changes fell on deaf ears. They no longer needed to help the client. They’d already locked in their client retention numbers.

Sometimes this doesn’t become clear until after the next paving stone.

## Paving Stone 6: Pay Hourly Rates for Implementation Consulting

I’m going to say it:

Hourly rates suck. For everyone.

It encourages consultants to spend more time on a project, not less. It prevents the vendors from paying the consultants on a *value* basis.

It discourages planning and preparation. It encourages the consultant to solve difficult problems they could have prevented from the onsite.

The implementation process often uncovers a need not discovered earlier in the process. This leads you straight to the next paving stone.

## Paving Stone 7: Buy (And Implement) Another Module

Listen, I’m not saying this as a hypothetical. This is straight out of the storybook of the people who’ve been willing to sit down with me, face to face, and share their own story of the ERP inferno.

It's that moment when you discover that the bill of goods you were sold actually *don't* do everything you need it to do.

"But take heart, because we have a module that (even if it's outside your budget) will give you exactly what you need."

Which is exactly what you expected to happen at the beginning.

It’s at this point that the question starts to appear, “When will this journey ever end?”

Trust me. It’ll end as soon as we follow the full pathway of these paving stones and discover ourselves fully shackled in an ERP inferno.

And this promises to be the solution, until you reach the next paving stones.

## Paving Stone 8: Beg the Vendor for Customization

If the module doesn’t deliver on its promises, you’re left to beg the vendor for customization. However, this usually results in a few outcomes.

The vendor may outright refuse it, indicating that it’s simply not possible. This leaves you to find another solution.

The vendor may agree to it. However, the likelihood of your success depends on two things:

1. The design of the ERP solution  
2. The vendor’s development processes

Retail solutions are *very* different from solutions that are easily customizable. That's why it's so expensive for vendors to add customization to a retail product. It's not just the cost of implementation. It's also the long-term cost of supporting the feature.

Furthermore, custom development requires a high commitment to quality development processes. This ensures that it reaches the same quality standards as the rest of the software. Most times, retail vendors can't effectively provide QA for client-customized features.

Thus, customizations take much longer than predicted. They don't reaching the quality standards required. Sometimes, the vendor cancels them outright.

This leaves you with only one path forward, directly to the next paving stone.

## Paving Stone 9: Coerce Your Business Processes to Fit the Software

When the software proves to no longer fit your workflow, you’re faced with only one option.

Coerce your business processes to fit the software. Unfortunately, this has a deep ripple effect throughout the organization.

First of all, it undoes any efficiency from tightly refined business processes. You’re now forced to use labor (an expensive resource) to compensate for software (which you bought to reduce labor).

Furthermore, it breaks down employee morale. The business processes are no longer built to serve your employees. Instead, your business processes must serve your software, and your employees must find a way to serve the business processes.

And in case you haven’t observed, business processes make GREAT servants and TYRANNICAL leaders.

Finally, your employees are much less likely to actually use the system. This compounds the negative impact. Not only are you missing the critical features, but you’re missing the inputs you require to experience the full benefit.

But take heart, you’ve finally reached your destination\!

## Paving Stone 10: Congratulations\! You’ve Reached the ERP Inferno\!

You’re in a contract.

You’ve paid for the implementation consulting.

You’ve bought the upsells.

You’ve trained your staff.

You’re still not happy.

It won’t get better. However, the painful (and expensive) journey to get to this point is enough to keep most people here. They can’t imagine life outside of this inferno.

If you’ve never been down this path, put down this paper and write me a check for $10,000. I’ve just saved you 10X that on your ERP rollout.

And if you have been down this path and find yourself in the ERP Inferno, take heart.

There’s a path out, and I’ll show you how.

## Turning the Software World Upside Down

Let me tell you about my secret ambition.

I launched my career in a software company with exceptional practices and high value for people.

At the time, I had no idea how rare that was.

I learned the development processes that will make or break a software project, beyond simply management buzzwords.

I learned exactly what it takes to make software that not only WORKS, but works for the CLIENT.

It’s what’s allowed me to write code that, over ten years later, is still running on the servers of Fortune 500 banks and insurance companies.

Until these ERP nightmare stories began to surface, I didn’t realize how *differently* I thought about and approached software.

My secret ambition is to overturn the way software is developed--and more specifically, how ERPs are rolled out.

With that, I want to share the golden rungs we’ve used successfully with our clients to pull them out of the ERP inferno.

## Golden Rung 1: Start with the Business Workflow

The first order of business in any of our client engagements is deeply understanding their business workflow.

This starts as early as our first sales conversation with a client.

Why?

Because it’s the ONLY way to ensure they get the best experience, and the best product that will actually solve their problem.

It allows us to understand and document the specific processes that are critical to the success of the business.

## Golden Rung 2: Become the Business Expert You Already Are

We understand software deeply, and we’ve got a great grasp of business as well. However, our core understanding is that the real expert in the business is the client.

Our job is simply to extract that knowledge, then help you implement tools to strengthen and optimize the things that you’re already doing.

Which leads us to the next Golden Rung.

## Golden Rung 3: Build the Solution to Meet the Problem

Once we deeply understand the problem that you’re looking to solve, it allows us to build a solution that’s tailored to your specific situation.

This is an intensely thorough process. As the client, you actually work with us to design and develop the contract. You have zero surprises by the time we’re ready to start implementation.

We don’t get to the tactics until we’ve understood the strategic requirements. Everything is sequenced to avoid deadends and gaps.

And there’s a specific reason we’re able to do that.

## Golden Rung 4: Predict and Prevent Problems Early

Rather than bill out hourly rates for the implementation, we calculate the exact cost of the full system deployment.

This puts the onus on us, the vendor, to ensure that we find and prevent these issues.

Unless you have a SOLID grasp on what each client needs and on the implementation process, this is NOT a risk that most vendors are willing to take on.

## Golden Rung 5: Deploy Software that “Thinks Like You Think”

By the time we’ve gotten to the deployment phase, we’re able to actually deploy software that “thinks like you think”.

Yes, together we’ll have to migrate information over.

Yes, together we’ll have to train your staff.

However, the costs are SIGNIFICANTLY lower because they match your existing business processes. And in the places where they don’t match, they match what your business processes SHOULD be.

And your employees will actually *want* to use the system because it doesn’t get in their way.

You can actually get the data you know you need to make wise business decisions.

The question remains:

## Will You Take Your First Step Out of the ERP Inferno?

Many people stay in the ERP inferno for a simple reason--indecision and inaction. However, the first step out of the ERP inferno is easy: Reach out to grab hold of the first rung.

Today, you’ve been armed with knowledge. What you do with it depends on you.

To further help you avoid the ERP Inferno, CodeHaus has developed a 45-minute Software Blueprint Deep Dive which we conduct over phone or Zoom with you and top staff/ team members.

What we accomplish in this fast-paced, zero-nonsense session is:

1. Mapping out a strategic landscape of the business, including both software and systems  
2. Identifying the opportunities with the greatest return on effort
