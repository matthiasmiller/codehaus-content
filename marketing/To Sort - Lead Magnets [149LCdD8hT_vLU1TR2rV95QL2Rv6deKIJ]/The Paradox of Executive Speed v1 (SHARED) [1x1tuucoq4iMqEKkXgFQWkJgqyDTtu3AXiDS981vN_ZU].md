# The Paradox of Executive Speed

## Why the Most Critical Problems In Your Business Cannot Be Solved by Writing a Check (and what to do about it)

Every executive faces two kinds of problems.

The first kind of problem can be solved by finding a proven solution. This may involve hiring a consultant, coach, trainer, or professional. It may mean investing in a product or service. The solution might be simple or complex. It might be costly or inexpensive. It might be easy or a lot of work. However, you can ultimately write a check to solve your problem and move on.

The second problem is more challenging. These are problems that do not have a proven solution.

When you hire a consultant for these types of problems, they will lean towards a solution that fits their skillset. A marketing consultant will address it through marketing. A management consultant will address it through systems and process. A human resource consultant will address it through human capital.

As a result, these problems are easy to approach symptomatically. And even though parts of it appear to get better, the problem never goes away.

These are the problems that slow you down.

1. Business moves at the speed of problem solving.

2. If you can write a check to solve a problem, it's either no longer a problem or no longer a priority.

Thus, the **problems that slow you down the most are the ones you can't write a check to solve.**

This is the Paradox of Executive Speed.

The question naturally arises, “How do you solve these unsolvable problems?”

## The 3-Step Framework for Solving Unsolvable Problem

As I’ve worked with problems similar to this, I’ve found that usually these problems are remain unsolvable for one of three reasons:

1. The problem has been misidentified. What’s trying to be solved is not *actually* the real problem. Thus, it never goes away.

2. The identified solution is just a partial solution. It appears airtight on the surface, but when it’s introduced into business, it creates vacuums of unaddressed issues. 

3. The problem is addressed with a conventional planning model, which does not work for these types of problems.

I’ll break each of these down further in the next steps.

## Problem Decomposition

The only way to address Unsolvable Problems is by breaking them down to their root issues. This means taking the problem through the Problem Decomposition process.

Once you’ve completed this successfully, you will be able to articulate the core problem clearly. You will achieve 90% clarity on your action plans.

This is more than just finding the core elements of the problem. It also means uncovering gaps in the understanding of the problem. The gaps often yield the most insight to the true nature of the problem.

When this process is not followed correctly, the solutions will only address the symptoms. The problem will never truly go away, and you will continually be trying to clean up the symptoms.

## 360 Integration

Unsolvable Problems cannot be isolated. This lends to their complexity. Addressing the problem has a ripple effect throughout the business that needs to be considered. The 360 Integration process ensures that these ripple effects do not have unintended consequences.

When done correctly, the solution integrates into your business. The pieces fit together like a well-cut puzzle. You will know a solution has 360 Integration when **it improves every part of the business it touches**.

When done incorrectly, solutions like these will create barriers within parts of the business. It will isolate certain departments. It will agitate other unsolved problems. While the solution may appear right on the outset, it will create ongoing friction in the business.

## Adaptive Execution

Conventional problems follow a conventional model. You can develop a simple, linear plan to make the required changes in your business. When you break down your Unsolvable Problem, you may discover that you can use this model to address it.

However, you may also find that the Unsolvable Problem is so deeply interconnected in your business that you cannot follow a conventional plan.

Instead, you must use the Adaptive Execution model. This allows you to isolate and prioritize the next steps, despite their interconnectedness. While it does not follow a conventional project plan, it is a clear process with a defined target. It is a proven pathway in executing complex, interconnected solutions .

## Where You Can Go From Here

Based on what you’ve read, you may decide to tackle the Unsolved Problems that you’re facing. If you’ve gained a new confidence in doing that, I encourage you to do that.

You may also decide you want help addressing it. I’ll simply answer a few questions for you.

**Q: What is it that you do?**

I specifically work with executives to **solve the problems they cannot write a check to solve**. I do not work on problems that you can hire an accountant, attorney, technician, or conventional consultant to address.

The problems you have left? The pesky problems that are slowing down the business, will not go away, and have taken up residence in the back of your head?

Those are the problems I address.

**Q: How do you address these problems?**

I address them using the 3-part framework I discussed above. Once we’ve broken down the problem correctly, I find that the solution often emerges clearly.

**Q: Do you have a guarantee?**

Yes. as long as you engage with the process, and I have access to the staff members required to complete my work.

If you don’t agree that I’ve identified parts of the problem you haven’t seen before, articulated the problem more clearly, or defined the problem better, you owe nothing.

**Q: What does it take to get started?**

Every engagement starts with a $500 discovery call. You will receive a 1-page report of the problem that you’re looking to solve.

If I’m confident I can help you move forward, it will include an offer for a more in-depth engagement.
