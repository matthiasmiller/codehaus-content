# **The Mud-Free Mind**

## How to Accelerate Decision Making by Reducing Overwhelm

Team,

I was awake for two hours last night. I couldn’t sleep. The only thing I could think about was *The Mud-Free Mind*. I wanted to bring you all on the journey that I’ve been on the past few weeks.

This journey started over Christmas.

Our family spent over 36 hours on the road. As we drove, I listened to *The Rise and Fall of Mars Hill*, a podcast about a narcissistic church planter gone rogue.

While on vacation, I began to dig in deeper, I began researching narcissism, spiritual abuse, and psychological abuse. I began unraveling a lot of things that happened in my childhood and in my recent past.

After we came home, I kept digging.

Three weeks ago, I found a podcast that cracked open the concept of self-sabotage in a way I’d never experienced.

Two weeks ago, I read a book on cult behavior and mind control. Last week, I dug through a book on sexual predators.

It’s not the kind of weekend reading you’d expect. I journaled dozens of pages of notes. I found something shifting inside of me. However, I didn’t realize just how significant that shift was, until something happened to my email inbox.

## How I Annihilated Two Hundred Emails Directed to Me

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with my email. I’ve used every crutch I can imagine to address it. However, I was often overwhelmed by the number of decisions I needed to make.

Sometimes, I was completely paralyzed. And yet…

A week ago, I had over 200 emails that were assigned to me personally to deal 

Today, I have 16\.

I did it almost without trying. And I realized that I’d been living with mud in my mind. It led me to wonder…

Could I articulate what actually changed for me?

That’s why I want to take you deeper on my journey.

## Everything’s Normal Until It’s Not

Every single breakthrough I’ve had has had a regular pattern:

**I saw a picture of what the true normal looked like**.

It happened in my pursuit of an authentic relationship with Christ. It happened through my wrestling through dysfunctional emotional attachment. And it happened recently.

Even though it had felt like I’d been fighting something, I could never put my finger on what it actually was. I’ve come across quite a few mindset coaches who promised to help–but I never trusted that they *actually* knew what they were talking about.

The journey that started in December struck a few cracks in my distortion of reality. At first, it felt like more than just cracks. It felt like the world was crumbling.

I had to face the cold reality that certain individuals I’d previously trusted relied on strong, manipulative patterns. I revisited painful situations, looking at them in a new light and with a fresh sense of betrayal.

And yet, it was as healing as it was painful. Because finally, what had been “normal” wasn’t “normal” anymore.

## Stop the War Inside

On Friday evening, January 14, I was interrupted by the thought, “You should look for a podcast by Stephen Bates.” He was a business consultant I met in 2020 as part of a high ticket coaching program.

I scrolled through my Podcast app. I settled on one of his interviews as a guest on another show.

To this day, I don’t think I ever finished the podcast. I got what I needed with this simple nugget:

**You’re not fighting yourself**.

You know those behaviors you don’t like? Those patterns you want to break? Those are things you started doing because they **helped you**. 

The person who hides because they got negative attention? Yep, that was me.

Every Saturday afternoon, my dad would come home from work, exhausted. If he came home early enough, he’d eat lunch. Almost always, he’d take a nap.

Invariably, he’d head out to his shop to fix a few things on his tractors.

And invariably, he’d find me first to get my help.

The trouble was, I’ve *always* been sensitive to the emotional environments around me. I could tell he was stressed. And while he didn’t talk about it, it’s clear now that he experienced emotional turmoil that he never expressed.

Me?

I felt suffocated in the process.

I was grateful when I started working for someone *besides* my dad. It meant I could finally find something I needed to do on a Saturday afternoon. If I had to work, my dad couldn’t argue with it, unless his request was *really* important.

So I learned to hide.

And I continued to hide.

For most of my life, I’ve hidden.

I’ve tried to market myself. And I’ve still stayed hidden.

I’ve started projects, then terminated them. To stay hidden.

It wasn’t until two nights after I listened to the podcast, that it hit me. I was still hiding. And as soon as I realized it, I recognized when it started. And as soon as I realized it, it began to lose it’s power.

I found a new freedom in posting on social media. I was more free to be myself than I’d been before.

I had no idea this was simply a layer.

## Stop Living the Shadow of Me

I didn’t realize, though, how much I’d been living my life from a false identity. Not only that, I’d grown up in a culture that **encouraged** people to form false identities.

It was the only way to reach the impossible standard that people set for themselves and for each other.

As a religious community, it was the only way to keep people from indulging in the pleasures of sin–by keeping them from the pleasures of being themselves.

While this distortion drove me to understand myself through tools such as the Kolbe or the StrengthsFinder, the root lay in this:

I’d been taught to disregard my created identity. Instead, I’d been taught to live by a group identity that:

1. I did not know  
2. I did not control

This left me helpless. I survived the only way I knew – by reading environments, copying what other people were doing, and hoping to avoid the backlash.

I never learned to live from my own identity. I’d always sought others’ input because I found it impossible to trust myself.

I could never choose, because I never saw the two identities. As I continued to dig in, the two separate identities began to emerge:

1. The shadow of myself that others projected  
2. The reality of who God created me to be

I began to realize the only key was to embrace who God created me and called me to be. I only needed to shed the shadow of how others saw me–because even that wasn’t real.

God had already placed the keys to my own success within my DNA. And when He put Christ’s power in me, He gave me everything I needed.

He created me to grow through the fires I’d walk through. He created me to learn through the classrooms He put me into.

He created me to succeed in the paths He created for me.

As me.

In fact, there was no shadow anymore.

It was only me.

But then…

Who was I really?

## Stop the Fight Over Borders

In the culture I grew up, not only did I lose myself to the group identity, I lost myself to the identities of others. I did not know where I stopped and others started.

I distinctly remembered trying to follow the paths of each of my brothers… because I had such an illformed sense of who I was to be.

Furthermore, the culture I grew up in practically labeled it a sin to look out for your own good. As a result, expectations were left unsaid. People’s feelings got hurt. People’s needs were left unmet.

Including my own.

I had to fight to retrain myself to look after myself. I had to fight to believe that looking after myself would not destroy people around me.

And I had to fight to know where I stopped and others started.

This had practical implications.

* I started asking other people for information they needed to provide.  
* I stopped scheduling things at inconvenient times.  
* I started looking for times that worked well for me.  
* I gave myself permission to (finally) sleep as much as I needed.

And scary as it seemed, I took one step after another. I asked for things I wanted (even needed). And I began to realize….

That healthy kings respect the borders of the kingdoms.

And tyrants had no regard.

And this kingdom was not just with other people. It was also within myself.

## Stop the Tyranny of the Mind

I realized that I have, time and again, violated the borders of my mind.

I’ve asked it to solve unsolvable problems.

I’ve asked it to navigate impossible situations.

When it tries, it results in:

- Confusion  
- Indecision  
- Overwhelm  
- Ambivalence

Simply put, the mind can’t do that.

And as I learned to respect the boundaries of my mind, I learned to find avenues outside of myself.

- Ask better questions  
- Investigate  
- Defer until it’s clear  
- Postpone indefinitely  
- And most importantly, just to pray.

And all these returned me to a new place…

## The Quiet Sanctum of My Inbox

As I regained my sense of identity, let go of these old patterns, and only allowed my mind to solve the solvable problems, I found something shift.

My mind became clearer, and my heart found rest. And my inbox? Well, the inbox is clean.

You might be asking the question, “But will this last?” And, “Will this work for me?”

The answer is simple: “I don’t know.”

I do know this journey has led me to a remarkable sense of freedom. And I do know that, even if this isn’t a silver bullet (and almost nothing is), it is a marked milestone in my journey of leadership.

I don’t know how to bring others along. I don’t know how to replicate it for someone else.

But I do know that I can share the story of what happened to me. And I hope, if nothing else, it will continue creating a healthier environment for you all to live and work. And I hope it will inspire hope in each one of you in your pursuit of the freedom that God has created you for.

\-Matthias
