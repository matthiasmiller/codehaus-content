# **The Grow & Scale Productivity Bundle**

The Grow & Scale Productivity Bundle is a core package of software to help businesses streamline and automate their systems, with the opportunity to grow and scale with the business. These are the same foundational tools we use to manage and run our business.

This bundle includes:

## CRM / Lead Management

* **Contact Management**. Track all of your contacts, address, phone numbers, and email addresses in a central location. Attach files, notes, and images to each contact. Easily export your contacts to Excel for mailings.

* **Sales Pipeline Management**. Lead management and followup is one of the most important parts of the sales process. The Sales Pipeline tool can track one or multiple sales opportunities for each prospect. Every opportunity can be assigned to a specific salesperson, with conversation notes attached directly to the sales opportunity. These notes can include text, checklists, images, and file attachments.

  The sales opportunity will follow specific checkpoints as the prospect moves along the sales process. All opportunities include a sales followup date, with a workflow report and email reminder to make sure follow up happens strategically. When using time tracking, the salesperson can track the number of conversations and amount of time spent on each opportunity.

## Project Management

* **Project Management**. The Project Management tools allow prioritizing and assigning projects to specific team members. Each project includes a formatted text field that allows tracking conversation history, creating easy-to-use checklists, and recording project status. When time tracking is enabled, projects can be managed on a timeline, tracking project estimates against the actual time required.

* **Project Snippets**. The Project Snippets tools allow preconfigured text to quickly be appended to a project. This makes it easy to create preconfigured checklists or templates for certain projects that are repeated frequently.

* **Time Tracking**. The Time Tracking feature includes time sheets for each employee, tracking not only the hours but also the category of work. This can be used in conjunction with the Project Management tools to track time spent on specific activities or projects.

## HR Management

* **Time Off Requests**. Together with the Time Tracking feature, this allows you to manage employee time off requests and track used and remaining paid time off. Their approved time off is automatically added to their time card.

## Business Processes

* **Process Documentation**. The Process Documentation tools create a centralized place to document business processes and procedures. These can be grouped by category, allowing file attachments, images, and full text formatting. These can be easily linked to from projects, or can be tracked on time cards.

* **Automated Email Reminders**. The Automated Email Reminders provide powerful scheduling features for recurring tasks. These can be used in conjunction with the Process Documentation tools to create reminders for specific tasks that need to be completed on a specific timeline.

## Getting Started
