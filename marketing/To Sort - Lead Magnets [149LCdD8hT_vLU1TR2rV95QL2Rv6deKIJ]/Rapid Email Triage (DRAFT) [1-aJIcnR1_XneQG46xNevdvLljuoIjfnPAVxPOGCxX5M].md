# **Rapid Email Triage**

## How to Maintain Inbox Zero, Remove Mental Sludge, and Focus on the Things That Matter

For years, I’ve struggled with email.

They’d accumulate day by day, until I had so many that I *had* to do something. I would resign myself to trudging through them.

One. At. A. Time.

I tried every hack imaginable.

I tried virtual coworking.

At one point, I even had a team member review emails with me over the phone. And while this was much more pleasant, I found it wasn’t good enough. I couldn’t find the gap.

And even though I had an assistant, I even tried to go out to hire *another* assistant.

That’s when I realized I had the wrong mental model.

## What Email Is and Isn’t

Email is a written conversation. You’d never go around with a voice recorder to all of your conversations with all of your colleagues, and you should never do that with email.

Email has a very short halflife, and you should treat it that way. Touch it too long, and you’ll get burned. Or some kind of radioactive email cancer.

It is NOT a task tracker or project manager. The only prioritization it has is the recency of response, which is a highly unproductive way to structure your life. You need a SEPARATE system to track what needs to be done, which we’ll get into.

It is also NOT a document storage or knowledge base. Yes, you can keep your emails to search back through them. However, trying to reference information in an email is a major killer of productivity. It’s easy to get sucked into quick responses here and there.

But first, let’s start with an assumption

## Hiring Your Assistant

If you are earning any respectable amount of money, you should hire a part-time assistant. This is NOT a treatise on hiring. However, you’re leaving money on the table by putting this off.

You’re also cluttering up your mind. The reason I can accomplish what I can is because of the clarity of mind that I have.

I don’t let things clutter my mind, and I’ll explain how in a bit.

And while you may be tempted to squirm and avoid finding an assistant and learning to work with them, your life will be immensely improved by finding one.

With that in mind, let’s start with the lowest-hanging fruit.

## Filter Your Email

The first place to start is to filter your email. This means setting up rules in your email to move them to the appropriate folder. This is covered in our Inbox Zero Challenge videos.

Here are some specifics.

### Filter Eliminate Email Subscriptions

The first order of business is reducing the noise in your inbox. The first step is filtering your email subscriptions.

You should filter your mailing lists into subfolders for:

* Daily Reads  
* Weekly Reads  
* Monthly Reads

This is helpful for two reasons:

1. It keeps you from the paralysis of “what if I unsubscribe”  
2. It keeps the noise from your main inbox  
3. It tells you clearly what you should unsubscribe from

Yes, you MUST unsubscribe from anything that does not fit into the above categories.

There’s another important filter you can create.

### Filter Email Groups

If you’re a member of an email discussion, create a subfolder for that group, and send all emails to that folder. Then, you can catch up on those emails as you please.

### Filter Invoices and Receipts

We’ve set up automation to filter paid invoices and receipts, convert them into PDFs, and file them.

For unpaid invoices, my assistant files them into a “Payables” subfolder for review and approval.

### Filter Remaining Emails

Every day, my assistant goes through my inbox, looks for things to unsubscribe from, things to file, and things that need to be addressed by me. She places them in a folder called “Matthias Review”. This is the inbox that I spend the most time with.

She also places logins for course access and new accounts in a “Registration Info” folder.

We’ve also set up email filters so that team members and certain client emails go directly into that folder. (I’ve also got a confidential email address for private messages, since multiple team members have access to my full inbox.)

## Process Remaining Emails

If you’ve done this correctly, you should have eliminated nearly 90% of your emails. This leaves the remaining emails.

However, even these can pile up if you’re not careful.

As I look at these emails, there are a few things I look for.

### Is This Informational or Actionable?

Informational emails simply need to be read, and sometimes acknowledged. Sometimes, it needs to be filed in the project management system with a project. 

If it’s actionable, the question is:

### Do I Know What to Do?

A lot of my stalled decision-making came down to lack of information. When I get an email that does not have clear next steps, I’ve learned to quickly hand it off to someone else for more information.

The WORST kinds of emails are “THINK ABOUT’’ and “CONSIDER” emails, because they imply open-ended mind-stumping questions. Some of them don’t even fix a real problem.

For example, it would be much better to say, “DEVELOP A PLAN” so that you can evaluate the plan. Or, “SKIM THIS AND GIVE THOUGHTS.”

Sometimes, it doesn’t matter because the next question reveals the priority.

### Should I Do It Now?

A lot of emails require followup but are not all that important. These get thrown into the project management system, which we’ll talk about in a bit.

This gets it out of email, but it allows you to re-evaluate them in the future.

Lack of clarity in any of these areas will slow down your decision-making process. However, if you’ve got these nailed down, you can dive into the final piece.

### Tactical Delegation

The final piece is **tactical delegation**. My biggest mistake with delegation was trying to delegate **strategically, not tactically**. I would try to give broad, brushstroke instructions, rather than clear, detailed tasks. The problem was that I didn’t know what I wanted.

This hit me after I filled out paperwork that required my signature. It required a single fax and the document to be filed. Since it only would take a few minutes, I was tempted to go ahead and do it myself. However, I realized that it would only take a few seconds to send the PDF to my assistant, and she could follow up with it.

Of course, that’s what I did.

When delegating, there are two types of tasks:

- One-off tasks  
- Recurring tasks

One-off tasks, such as creating a new item in our project management system, is as simple as a quick email to my assistant.

Recurring tasks require instructions, as well as documentation as a Simple Repeatable Process. If it’s in-depth, this is something that I create using our Just-in-Time Process Method. Otherwise, I’ll send a few instructions to my assistant and allow her to flesh it out.

## Project Management Cadence

All this relies on a project management cadence. We use a cadence based on:

* Quarters  
* Weeks  
* Days

(Yes, I know that Months are missing and should probably be included. I’m excluding it because we’re not doing it right now.)[^1]

Your project management is only as good as your use of it. This means reviewing your lists of tasks, and adjusting priority. We use a 1-5 numbering scheme, where 1 means “now” and 5 means “maybe eventually”. Anything we decide NOT to do, we close out.

Priorities are constantly shifting, and if you only have a fixed list of TO DOs, you’ll never readjust them for changes in priority.

For much of this, we’ve built in some team accountability.

## Calendaring

A final part of this process is calendaring. While I go in-depth in this in another article, this is a key piece in being able to schedule time to work on things.

Finding GOOD times to do things is critical. Most people try to force tasks in at the wrong time, and then they hate their calendar and their schedule.

Don’t do it.

## System Integration

Last thing, and then I’m ready for questions. We’re actively building out two integrations:

1. **Project Management \+ Email**. This will allow us to link email conversations (with team members or clients) directly to projects in our project management system. This will eliminate the back-and-forth.

2. **Project Management \+ Calendar**. This will allow us to link calendar events to our project management system. This will simplify the weekly and daily planning process, will allow time projections, and will simplify ease-of-access to projects.

With that, there’s one final thing…

## Questions?

I can’t imagine that I’ve sufficiently described this process or answered this question. This is a one-two punch. Half the game is mindset. The other half is tactical.

With that…

What questions do you have?

[^1]:  As I’m writing this, it occurs to me that a logical priority would be (1) Today, (2) This Week, (3) This Month, (4) This Quarter, and (5) Eventually
