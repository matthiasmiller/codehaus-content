Warning
This is NOT your conventional approach to business planning or goal setting.
Any of these struggles sound familiar?

THE Failure Cycle
You may have felt trapped in the failure cycle.
Any of these struggles sound familiar?

The Failure Cycle
You Feel Underappreciated
Even though you’re pushing your limits, others don’t see the sacrifice you’re making.
Any of these struggles sound familiar?

The Failure Cycle
You Feel Overwhelmed
No matter how hard you work, you’re always falling behind.
The Business Is All In Your Head and Can’t Outgrow You

The Failure Cycle
You Feel Under-supported
You have a revolving door of people, most of whom won’t stick it out for the long term.
The Business Is All In Your Head and Can’t Outgrow You

How do I know this?
Because I actually got stuck in the failure cycle... 

MY Experience
The best compensated business leaders have solved it.

EPIPHANY
If I could spend time around the most elite business leaders, I could learn what they’re doing differently.

I was frustrated that with all my effort, my business was still hanging on by a thread.
I temporarily “fired” my project manager because he kept making it worse.
MY Experience

SINCE THEN.. 
I’ve moved into spending 90% of my day in a productive flow that’s growing and expanding our core software business.
I’ve helped numerous leaders dramatically reshape their lives from dead-end mud ruts to wide open highways.
Entrepreneurship has been written through my entire life. Grew up planting churches and performing on stages with parents.
Been part of planting 4 churches and launching 5 businesses -> Successfully made the leap all those times -> some were amazing, some were near disasters. 
Became a consultant for entrepreneurial church plants and nonprofits. 


But it wasn’t always like this.

We’re ON A MISSION…
We’re on a mission to help 1,000 business owners escape the Failure Cycle and create high-growth businesses that leave a legacy of income and impact.
Left that behind to return to my root passion: helping small businesses stuck in self-employment like I was to escape and regain their freedom while scaling highly profitable and impactful 7 Figure businesses. 
Our WHY vision is to Unleash 10,000 Impact Driven CEO’s who lead 7 Figure healthy companies and give $100,000,000 annually to make earth more like heaven. 
That’s why I’m willing to give this training away for FREE because that mission deserves to move forward.

This is for you if you’re…
Experienced what others consider significant success, but you still have a gnawing dissatisfaction that won’t go away
Feeling stuck in the hamster wheel of the Failure Cycle and can’t seem to find the way out
Are tired of crack cocaine wizardry of motivational gurus who still haven’t given you the real answers you need

Proper Perspective
Most business owners get “stuck in the weeds” of their business. To borrow a popular adage, they end up working “in their business” instead of “on their business”.

Proper Perspective
To get out of the Failure Cycle, you need to make sure that you’re playing by the right set of rules.

Proper Perspective
Without this, you’ll continually be caught in the rules of playing someone else’s game.

Proper Perspective
When it’s done well, you fall in love with the process. Every day, you move closer to the place you want to be.

Proper Perspective
1. Take the time for “think time”.
Use a pen and journal if you need to.
Allow yourself a change of scenery.
Block out your time on the calendar.

Proper Perspective
2. Ask yourself powerful questions.
The problems you’re facing can only be addressed by asking better questions.
The issues of the challenges you face are often under the surface (most likely, a few layers deep).

PROPER PERSPECTIVE
3. Make sure big picture stays congruent with daily details.
When you are in action mode, make sure that you stay congruent with where you want to go.
Be willing to say “no” to things are “good things” but aren’t a “good fit”.
