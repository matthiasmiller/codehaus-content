# The Paradox of Executive Speed

## Why the Most Critical Problems In Your Business Cannot Be Solved by Writing a Check. (and what to do about it)

Executive speed is essential to decision making.  However, your speed in executing the next logical step can be the boulder that rolls down the hill to block your path.

Right now, you have a nagging problem in your business that will not go away.

You can't delegate it.

You can't work harder at it.

You can't write a check to get rid of it.

And yet, this problem stands between where you are, and where you need to be.

If that's you, you're not alone. In fact, you've just encountered something called the Paradox of Executive Speed.

It's a phenomenon faced by many business leaders like yourself. It keeps them stuck, unable to move forward.

This Paradox rests on two simple rules:.

1. Business moves at the speed of problem solving.

2. If you can write a check to solve a problem, it's either no longer a problem or no longer a priority.

Thus, the **problems that slow you down the most are the ones you can't write a check to solve.**

This leads to a problem-solving impasse.

To break the impasse, you must understand the two types of problems in business.

## The Two Types of Problems in Business

Businesses face two types of problems:

1. Problems with a proven solution.  
2. Problems with an unknown solution.

The skillsets required for each type of problem are vastly different.

The first type of problem can be solved by hiring a consultant, coach, trainer, or professional. You simply need to find and implement best practices.

However, the second type of problem cannot be solved by conventional consultants. When they are faced with these challenges, they will lean towards a solution that fits their skillset:

* A marketing consultant will address it through marketing.  
* A sales consultant will address it through sales.  
* A management consultant will address it through operations.  
* A human resources consultant will address it through culture and process.

If you have a problem with a known solution, you **should** take the path of a proven solution. However, if your problem does not have a known solution, you need to address it differently.

## The 3-Prong, Paradox-Breaking Framework

Before taking you further, I want to introduce myself.

I’m Matthias Miller, and my genius zonezone of genius is helping executives **with all the problems they can’t hire someone else to solve**.

This stems from a unique ability to find root issues others have overlooked, fit competing needs into a cohesive whole, and tease apart complex solutions into next steps.

These are the exact reasons many problems remain unsolved:

1. The problem has been misidentified. What’s trying to be solved is not *actually* the real problem. Thus, it never goes away.

2. The identified solution is just a partial solution. It appears airtight on the surface, but when it’s introduced into business, it creates vacuums of unaddressed issues. 

3. The problem is addressed with a conventional planning model, which  neglects planning a detailed step-by-step timeline of executiondoes not work for these types of problems.

As a result, I’ve been able to take this from more than just a zone of genius. I’ve developed  a framework that I’ve used time and again to work through problems that do not yet have a clearly defined solution.

This includes three parts:

1. Problem Deconstruction   
2. 360 Integration  
3. Adaptive Execution

Let’s break each of these down further.

Breaking these down further:

## Problem Deconstruction

Poorly defined problems lead to useless solutions. The key to correctly defining the problem is by breaking it down into its root issues.

This is done through the Problem Deconstruction process. Once you’ve done this, you’ll be able to articulate the core problem clearly. You’ll also get at least 70% clarity on how to solve it.

The problem deconstruction process not only identifies and articulates the core problem clearly, it also uncovers the gaps in understanding that are crucial to the fundamental elements of the problem,  Not unlike an iceberg, the true nature, and danger, lies below the surface.

When followed correctly, our process corrects the problem in totality, the observable symptoms are gone, but the comprehensive analysis of the fundamental causes, allows you to prevent messes from recurring.

This is more than just finding the core elements of the problem. It also means uncovering gaps in the understanding of the problem. The gap itself often yields the most insight into the true nature of the problem.

When this process is not followed correctly, the solutions will only address the symptoms. The problem will never truly go away, and you will continually be trying to clean up the mess.  The paragraphs above are now consistently referencing “the problem” which has been parsed out from “these kinds of problems.  So the rewrite of the paragraph above, pulls through that consistent narrative, rather than switching into “when this process is not followed”  You’ve been talking about what happens and what your process is, hence, the rewrite.

## 360 Integration

In fact these problems do not occur in isolation.  They can be somewhat simple problems, or they can be extremely complex.  Regardless, they interconnect with every other aspect of your business in an organic way.  As we guide you through the Deconstruction process and into 360 Integration.

Furthermore, these problems are often difficult to isolate. They’re complicated with a lot of moving parts. Addressing them has a ripple effect throughout the business that needs to be carefully considered and managed.

The 360 Integration process ensures the core elements and insights from the Problem Deconstruction Process are seamlessly connected to all aspects of your business as the Adaptive Execution process unfolds. 

When done correctly, it allows the solution to fit into your business like a well-cut puzzle. You will know a solution has 360 Integration when **it improves every part of the business it touches**.

When it’s not done correctly, the solution will introduce new barriers. While the solution may appear right on the outset, it will create ongoing friction in the business.

(*I think that the above bit of a rewrite ties the highlighted parts together and moves the understanding into clarity at least somewhat.)*

## Adaptive Execution

Finally, these types of problems are notoriously difficult to execute on. This is because they do not follow a conventional model of execution.

For problems with a known solution, you can develop a simple, linear plan to make the required changes in your business. These solutions are often so deeply interconnected in your business that you cannot follow a conventional plan.

Instead, you must use the Adaptive Execution model is the implementation process we have developed for these types of systemic issues.  Without an entirely new paradigm, these problems are notorious for confounding the best planners.  While the clarity that comes with deconstruction and businesswide planned integration are essential elements, the Adaptive Execution Model provides unique processes in which your specific problem can be evaluated as to the next steps.  It provides a process to address the complexity of interconnectedness, simplifying the progression from Deconstruction, thrugh 360 integration, into Effective Execution and a rapid pace..

When done correctly, it allows you to isolate and prioritize the next steps, regardless of their interconnectedness. It is a proven process that helps you execute complex, interconnected solutions.

Without this, the executed solution will miss the target. At best, you’ll end up with a partial solution to the problem you’re looking to solve.  

## Where You Can Go From Here

Based on what you’ve read, you may decide to take this framework and run with it. If you prefer to do that, I encourage you to do so\!

To move forward more quickly and effectively, you might decide to work with me.

These engagements always start with a 1-hour discovery call and written summary. This is a **paid engagement** that gives us a quick opportunity to find out what it’s like to work together and what the appropriate next steps will be.

If I can help you, I’ll include that in the summary. If not, I’ll give you direction on how to address next steps. Your Discovery Call also comes with a **money back guarantee**. If you don’t agree that I’ve identified parts of the problem you haven’t seen before, or articulated the problem more clearly than before, you’ll receive a full refund within 30 days. The report will be yours to keep.
