### Notes (those in bold are added above): 

***Here are a few more lessons on the insertion point job.  One of them is that as soon as you run into an exception, isolate and deal with the exception to standardize it and solve that issue. When you introduce exceptions into whatever else you're trying to do, you dramatically increase complexity. So isolate the complexity, deal with the exception, and everything will go faster for you. Now, here's the other thing that I've noticed. For a while, I thought this was just a productivity issue of not being able to cut to the chase on some of these issues. But I think there's also this element of when you're in the swamp land it can be very disorienting, because you don't necessarily know where the bottom of the swamp is. You don't necessarily know what the right path forward is. So you end up wandering in the swamp, and it feels like you're not necessarily getting momentum or things aren't going as well as you'd like. But there was a mindset shift for me that when you're in the bottom of the swamp, and you're wandering around, and you don't feel like you're making progress, it's okay. It may be disconcerting, but it actually can be a very powerful time for you. And it may be more productive than you know.  Maybe the times when I just felt like I'm struggling, I'm just digging around in the bottom of a swamp. Once you find the bottom of the swamp,  there's something solid to it. And maybe that was that feeling especially with this last round of trying to clean up these section break insertions. I wandered around for a while and all of a sudden, it was like I hit pay dirt and everything started coming together. These are my thoughts on that. super fascinating.***

***There's another dynamic to the whole troubleshooting process, which is the whole concept of debugging. There are some things that you can only catch in real time that you can't see any other way. One example of this is the nuances of how people relate with each other, or the nuances of people's emotions or responses in the situation. Another aspect is that people rarely remember all the actual details. When you're watching real time, you can observe the facts. If you understand what facts and details you're looking for, you can actually observe them when you need them. Whereas after the fact the only thing that you can really, truly be certain about is the outcome that you've achieved. So that's why having somebody accompany you through the process can be such a critical piece of it. It's also why it's so much more valuable to watch something in real time. It's also one of the reasons why planning can be problematic because planning predicts but planning is still not real time. And there's some things that can only be determined and fixed in real time. There's some things that cannot be fully determined beforehand by planning because there's other variables but when you're in real time, all those other variables are playing a part.***

***The difference between conventional planning and the current planning model is that traditional planning is built around nailing down every last detail. In a static environment or a predictable market  that works very well.***  
***If you're putting together a piece of software, and it's very simple and straightforward without a lot of variables,then you can spec out most of this stuff from the get go. This is one of the reasons why phases are so important in projects. You don't know what you don't know. You might roll out a project, only to discover that the market leans in a different direction or something like that. Because you're creating something new, something that hasn't existed before, you don't have the capacity to evaluate it until it's actually in the market. That's how it really is in the software world. Now, in a very static environment, something like banking, you actually want to have the highly detailed plan because there isn't a lot of change and it is very straightforward. It's very complex, but there's not a lot of variables, it's very static. So you can use a static plan. In a lot of conventional businesses you can do that. The more innovative the business,***  
***the less you're able to do that. Innovative businesses require an iterative approach. It also requires this whole approach that I've been talking about in my article. It's a completely different way of looking at the world. Some people might say, “hey, you're not planning if you're doing it  this way.”  Actually you are, but it's a completely different model of planning.***

***{A} So here's an interesting observation. This is personally in connection to the whole process for making these massive transitions. And part of it just is observation around unique ability. But it's interesting to observe how many times that I have been in the middle of transition. And how many times this has occurred, unintentionally for me. So as an example, with the transition to the web product, it was it was right over that transition of it was not only developing a new platform and developing the new tool sets, but it was also right over time of developing new***  
***development methodology,***  
***and a lot of new development mindsets. That came as a result of that transition. So it really was bigger than just the product,  it was the time we were rethinking how we actually do development.***  
***So that's one example.***  
***That continued for a number of years.***  
***When I went to Bangladesh, that was in itself a time of transition. And actually more than anything else, it was a way to make transition manageable for other people.***   
***When I came to New Horizons, there was this transition to kind of a guys dorm. Guys from supervisor, there was the transition from out place to in house video production, there was an executive director transition, which once again one of the most interesting things was that I arrived on the scene of that massive transition, without even predicting. There's these little hunches that I follow that have not seemingly been connected, but have landed me on the scene of massive transition. There was the connection with Pastor Jim, which led to the housing summit, which led to the FEDC membership, and then eventual board membership. The interesting thing there was that there was that I came right on the heels of transition with Rob Brown becoming president. But then beyond that, there was this transition in terms of how we view economic development. And there was the startup of TechStart.***  
***All of these things came together right before all this stuff started happening. And I don't know how I would have made that connection if Brad had not been part of that. So that's super fascinating.***  
***I see the same thing, in terms of the Emergent campus. It has been very much that same type of thing where we're transitioning. Partially is it's a new startup. There is this shift from the old way. And even with the sector partnership, there's a shift from the old way of how we, how we do business and how we look at how we perceive our own culture, and how we approach talent and economics. And I've managed to find myself in the middle of that transition as well. So I think I've seen this on a macro level. And I think if I pay attention, I see it on a micro level. Now, one of the things that's interesting to observe about this as well is that it makes sense that somebody who is driven to change would find themselves attracted to areas of transition.***  
***But what's most fascinating is that many of these situations had a series of events leading up to them that resulted in me being there at the right time, in the right place.. it makes me wonder where the full angle is on this unique ability. Because in reality, I can go back to any of these situations, I can go through the process that I've described. And I can detail how, maybe not how I've done it, but maybe how other people have.***  
***I can apply this model that I'm looking at to a lot of these different situations. And it really is interesting to see how much of that type of transition I have managed to be a part of. I suspect that there's a lot more insight to be had on that very specific dynamic.***  
***And here's just another one on a micro level but the coaching relationship that I had with***  
***Nelson also came right over the heels of transition. That's another example where I showed up on the scene right in the midst of that transition.***

***Something else to consider. Most planning is on the details, but not anchored on the outcomes. The 80/20 of event planning is determining the outcomes of the event. Most of the other details around planning become noise without it. This is my hangup with most planning.***

***For example ;-) …. Handwriting on envelopes is a means to an outcome. Discussing the best way to do that is an exercise in standard management. The outcome is open rate. Shifting focus to the outcome allows an 80/20 question of the best and easiest way to do that. One idea is to print the headline on the back of the envelope. You don't get these types of ideas from conventional planning. I have instinctively questioned these things but this is codifying what I naturally do.*** 

*by nature, I push myself harder* 

*\- not saying to cheat investortools*  
*\- not trying to cheat MYS*  
*\- if I walk away from SBI completely drained, what I've actually done is worked about 38 hours for Investortools and only billed 30 hours*  
*\- the sense you should have that you walk away, is I have worked hard, but there's sense of I have a bit of space, and I don't have a high level of inner tension, and I don't feel drained*

*is it better for Matthias to take an hour of brain space of the day, staying engaged motivated and productive, or Matthias billing one less hour a day and Josh not knowing what to do with him*

*figuring out how to care for yourself is how you serve the people around you...*

*I provide immense value to Investortools--they can never fully compensate that the top performers provide...can promise you that the long-term results are far better for them if it has this sense of fulfillment and not just exhaustion and drain, and not frustration*

***The other fascinating thing about this whole thing is the power of the subconscious. I’ve frequently gone off and done other things, come back, and had the solution in my head. This is becoming shockingly frequent.***

***This is one of the reasons why it’s so horrible to be pushing yourself to the limit, because it gives little or no ability for your subconscious to work \-- OR for you to connect with Memos about your work.***

***There's a few other keys to this:***

* ***Have a feedback loop built in, so that you know that the changes you’re making are working. (equivalent to unit tests)***  
* ***Having a way to measure progress. The clearer the better. I think it’s helpful to know what % of the way through the plan you are, but in lieu of that, even being able to see where you’ve come from is huge (like my insertion point spreadsheet)***  
* ***When deciding the next big piece to work on, part of the challenge is deciding how to slice and dice it. There are different ways to do it — you can examine several pieces, then see if there’s a pattern there that can be deduced. The other thing, sometimes there are logical breaks or divisions. You might have to carve off pieces multiple times to get to where you need to go.***  
* ***When you identify an aberration, one of the best ways to solve it is as a one-off, then see if it’s a pattern and apply that pattern to other places***

***Instances:***

* ***I also did this with InvLinkWeb.***

***{B} The interesting thing about this project is that it’s pushed me to shift from effort to awareness. You can accomplish a certain amount of work by effort. However, if you shift it to awareness, it heightens your ability. This is how you maximize output.***

*Another angle on this would be to break down how this worked for doing API conversions, because I think there were some similarities in the process EXCEPT I tried to go linearly with it.*

*Also, it’s interesting to note that organizations are like software WHEN you understand them and have the right perspective. People told me that I approached code very differently--not quite like poetry, but as an expression and with elegance. And I think that’s partially because of how I view the world.*

*Now, a big challenge could be knowing how to share all of this without making it be all about software development for people.*
