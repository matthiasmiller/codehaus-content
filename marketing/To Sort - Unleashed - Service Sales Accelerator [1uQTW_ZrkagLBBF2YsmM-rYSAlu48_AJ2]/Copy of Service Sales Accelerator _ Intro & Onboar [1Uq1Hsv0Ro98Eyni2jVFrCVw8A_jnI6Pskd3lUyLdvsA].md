## **Implementation Pathway**

* This is set on your roadmap call HOWEVER…   
* Be a cheetah, not a lamb. Take massive action based on the plan we set together to move your business forward.   
* Don’t wait for permission. 

**Common Pitfalls**  

1. **Not Time Blocking 5 Hours / Week Right Away**  
   1. Morning Voxer check-In (recommended for accountability)   
   2. 2 hrs / week for calls.  
   3. 3 hrs / week for completing assets and homework.  
2. **Not focusing on the next right thing, but focusing on everything**  
   1. Simplify; less is more.  
   2. Say NO and *“not yet”* a lot more over the next 90 days.
