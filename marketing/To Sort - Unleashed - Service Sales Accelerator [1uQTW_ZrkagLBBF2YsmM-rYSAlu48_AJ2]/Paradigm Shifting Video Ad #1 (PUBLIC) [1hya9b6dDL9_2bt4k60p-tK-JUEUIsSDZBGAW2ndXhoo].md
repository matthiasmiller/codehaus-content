Dear 7-figure construction or manufacturing owner,

Do you feel like your jobs, schedules, and invoices are scattered across papers, spreadsheets, and software?
MY QUESTION TO YOU...

Are you quietly bleeding cash from your business because things are slipping through the cracks?
MY QUESTION TO YOU...

Hi, I’m Matthias. I’ve watched business owners like you fight with “duct tape” paper and software systems. 
I KNOW THIS PROBLEM WELL

Many business owners believe, “If I step out of the business, everything will come to a grinding halt.”
Common Misperception

While this might be true of your business now, many businesses like yours have successfully made this shift once they got past the early stage.
WHY THIS Is False

You can take everything that’s in your head, and you can turn it into a system that someone else can successfully run. You don’t have to be there to make it happen.
THE ROOT ISSUE

Getting these things out of your head and automating it is the key to profitably grow your construction or manufacturing business with confidence.
SOLVING THIS IS KEY

We build software that’s custom-made for your specific business using our CodeHaus Development Process.
