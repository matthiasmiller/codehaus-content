# Perfect Patron Connection Story Notes

* The biggest driver behind what I do is this...that I see people get BURIED under operations, and it ends up making life unnecessarily hard.  
* The problem is...the way most people are solving the problem is limited. It’s either about:  
  * Implementing SYSTEMS...  
  * Implementing SOFTWARE...but most of this is retail software, serving a large audience, and it doesn’t guarantee that   
*   
* One of the things that CONTINUES to bother me is very capable, strong leaders who achieve some level of success, only to get buried underneath it.  
* I’ve spent TOO MUCH of my life buried in those places   
*   
* Early on in my career, I managed a few digital marketing campaigns.  
* What I really loved about it was getting the systems set up, testing the messaging, but the actual work of managing the ads was tedious and time-consuming.  
* I build a custom software solution  
* You know, I think one of the closest things I can think of in terms of personal emotional connection, I guess, well, yeah, there's, there's a few things maybe one is one is probably coming more from my brother, in terms of the opportunity that he saw to help these businesses, the one coming most directly from me is really tied to and I think you could probably massage this to make it fit but being the feeling the pressure as an employee, and and feeling the pressure to be in the, in the operational side of the business, and the kind of the overwhelm that came with that, knowing that I really wanted to be in more of a leadership role. And in the same way, there's kind of the same pressure of, you know, these business owners wanting to be in a specific spot in their business, whether it's just being able to spend their time more strategically in their business or being able to actually, you know, do the actual work of the business. And I think I think possibly the emotional connection comes down to being able to draw that parallel and, and seeing software as a tool to do that.  I do think there's an element in which I do fall in love with helping you, you know, with the actual toolset and actually doing the software as well as helping helping business owners get that, get that clarity over that. That kind of ties back to my other message.

* Hey, Matthias Yeah, I think that you're on the right track with that angle. I think you could refine it a little bit. But I think that's a good starting point. You know, for me, one of the things like with my Facebook ads agency that I had, that I leaned on sometimes was like, I started this, because I worked at other agencies I saw behind the scenes, and I got so fed up with seeing how bad many agencies treated their clients, they just didn't care. They didn't give them results. And I got sick of seeing business owners bamboozled seeing business owners, you know, that had amazing businesses, but they just didn't understand that just a few simple shifts in their marketing could like, have massive results for them. And so I started blindspot marketing, in order to combat that, in order to give them back time freedom, and show them that marketing doesn't have to be complicated, and expensive, and overwhelming, that can actually be really fun. And it can help them serve their clients at a higher level. Right. So you see how they're like I made an emotional connection between not necessarily having a starting place of like, coming from the industry that the client isn't, but still tying it back to like this painful problem and almost like throwing rocks at an industry.   
* One really powerful thing you can do is what I call my David and Goliath approach, where you're like throwing stones at a giant right, who just is too big and unwieldy to fight back. So like an industry for example. And a lot of successful marketers do this like if you look at purple mattresses, anything anything the Harmon brothers do, they actually do this? If you know who the Harmon brothers are, like, they, they throw rocks at industries that can't fight back. So they create like, you know, there's big pharma and big whatever they do this with, like, they took purple mattresses and they go, they just start throwing stones at the mattress industry. But the mattress industry can't fight back. Like they're not making ads like this. They're not aware of marketing. They're not it's not even it's not even like a single company, right? It's this like, conglomerate this like, way of doing business. And so they made it like, hey, the mattress industry is like trying to scam you. Here's not that you have to be that strong. It's like scam, but you know, like basically, you're getting treated wrong by the mattress industry. Here's a better way. So that's one really powerful angle. You can use

## What lesson did you learn?

* Even a small business in rural America running on razor-thin margins can bolster their business by implementing a simple, focused system on their most pressing problem.  
  * ~~When you’re in a competitive market, getting laser-focused on efficiency and insight into your numbers can make or break your business.~~

  * A retail behemoth who’s a software expert, but there are so many clients that it’s almost impossible to get any level of support (and I’ve watched people try and fail)  
*   
* An small vendor who’s an industry expert, but the software doesn’t always reach the level of quality that’s needed
