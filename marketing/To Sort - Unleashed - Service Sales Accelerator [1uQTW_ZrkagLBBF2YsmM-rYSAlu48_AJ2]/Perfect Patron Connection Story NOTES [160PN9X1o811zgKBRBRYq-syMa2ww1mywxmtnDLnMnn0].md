***RELATABLE Pt 1***

* *I don’t know that the real answer is actually all that helpful here \-- mostly because I got burned out of actual coding and needed to do something different, my brother started the business because he saw the value of what we could bring to people who are in business, and I started to come along for the ride because I was getting burned out of the actual development…*  
* *I actually got into software because of a business owner who was willing to apprentice his talent, and because of that, ended up with top-tier talent.*  
* *The work that I’m doing more specifically with businesses is because I got roped into it--partially because my brother saw the opportunity to help people in their business, but also because I wanted to be able to run a team and work with people…and this gave me an opportunity to do that*  
* *As a teenager working in my dad’s business, my biggest frustration was the amount of BUSYWORK that existed, and I looked for ways to simplify and automate.*

**Pt 2**

* *Emotionally gripping…*  
  * *Not profitable*  
  * *Before government audits*  
  * *Suffocating…*  
  * *Is there a case where they thought they were going to go out of business?*

* I got to watch my Dad and Mom make a retail store work in rural Kansas  
* Business went well, until the big box stores moved into town  
* They  went from planning a trip across the country to trying to figure out how to make ends meet.  
* What saved them?  
* Before this hit, we had helped them implement a business system to give them a STRONG grip on their numbers  
* This gave them a unique advantage, despite their competitors.
