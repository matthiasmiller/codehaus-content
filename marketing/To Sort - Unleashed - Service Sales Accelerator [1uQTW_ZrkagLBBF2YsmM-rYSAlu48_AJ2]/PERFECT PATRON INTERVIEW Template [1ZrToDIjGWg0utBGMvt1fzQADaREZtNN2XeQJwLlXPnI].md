# PERFECT PATRON INTERVIEW TEMPLATE

*One of the most common errors business owners make is **assuming** they know what their perfect patron is thinking and feeling. The goal of this interview is for them to reveal that **for us**.*

# STEP 1 | WRITE YOUR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

There are 4 main areas you should structure your interview around, and they are related to the 5 P’s:

1. **Perfect Patron**: We want them to tell us about themselves.  
2. **Painful Problem**: We want them to tell us what’s wrong and how it feels.  
3. **Promised Land**: what would the ideal outcome look like from working with you? What do they wish you would give them?  
4. **Proven Process:** What kind of solution is your perfect patron looking for?  
   

*Use the example questions below as a guide. Choose the ones that feel most congruent with you and your perfect patron. Multiple choice questions will lead to more interviews completed, but giving opportunity for custom/long form answers will give you the most valuable content. Use a mix of both\!*

There are two groups of people we want to be on this list. 

(1) Is 2-3 of your best current clients who fit the “perfect patron” outlined in your 5 P’s of positioning. **NOTE:** It is also VERY important that at the end of this call with them you ask them to tell you about their experience working with and RECORD this to use as a testimonial. (Ideally this would be over video but written is fine too). 

(2) Is 2-3 non-clients who you could see being “perfect patron” clients if only they truly understood the value of what you do.
