The Business Is All In Your Head and Can’t Outgrow You

How do I know this?
Because I’ve actually developed financial software for years... 

MY Experience
It really doesn’t have to be this hard.

EPIPHANY
I’ve got the business AND software experience, with a unique toolset to be able to help other business owners with this.

I was frustrated with Big Box software with no support & industry software that didn’t work as well as I expected.
I never felt like I was getting what I needed.
MY Experience

SINCE THEN.. 
We’ve not only helped 7- and 8-figure businesses like yours start fixing their profitability...
We’ve actually PROVEN it ourselves with a price guarantee (rare in this industry). 
Entrepreneurship has been written through my entire life. Grew up planting churches and performing on stages with parents.
Been part of planting 4 churches and launching 5 businesses -> Successfully made the leap all those times -> some were amazing, some were near disasters. 
Became a consultant for entrepreneurial church plants and nonprofits. 


But it wasn’t always like this.

We’re ON A MISSION…
We’re on a mission to help 1,000 7- and 8-figure businesses to build streamlined systems so they can cut costs, empower people, and grow their business.
Left that behind to return to my root passion: helping small businesses stuck in self-employment like I was to escape and regain their freedom while scaling highly profitable and impactful 7 Figure businesses. 
Our WHY vision is to Unleash 10,000 Impact Driven CEO’s who lead 7 Figure healthy companies and give $100,000,000 annually to make earth more like heaven. 
That’s why I’m willing to give this training away for FREE because that mission deserves to move forward.

This is for you if you’re…
Running a 7-figure or 8-figure business
Wanting to do the right thing from square one, build predictable growth, and lead self-directed employees
In a position to invest into streamlining your business and improving your systems

PROFIT TRACKER
Most businesses can see the money coming in andgoing out, but they have no idea where it’s actually going.

PROFIT TRACKER
To know your profit, you need to have a simple,easy way to track it that fits into your day-to-day.

PROFIT TRACKER
Without this, you either won’t have the information you need, or you’ll frustrate your team by making them track it the hard way (if they even do it).

PROFIT TRACKER
When it’s done well, this information is gathered automatically as part of the day-to-day workflow of each employee (with little resistance from them).

PROFIT INSIGHT
Most businesses only see the big numbers, such as profit per month or per project. But they’re helpless in knowing the specific things that they need to change.
2

PROFIT INSIGHT
Once you’re tracking your numbers, you need to be ableto “slice and dice” them to see the root of what’s going on.
2

PROFIT INSIGHT
Without it, you’re just making guesses. You end up solving the WRONG problem, or even making the problem WORSE.
2

PROFIT INSIGHT
With PRECISE knowledge of what’s actually going on, you know exactly what needs to change. You can make informed decisions instead of guessing.

PROFIT AUTOPILOT
Most businesses have to wait weeks or months to see and fix problems until they’re seeing the cash flow or scheduling challenges down the road.
3

PROFIT AUTOPILOT
When you have these pieces in “real time”, you can learn and correct mistakes quickly before you pay compound interest on your mistakes.

PROFIT AUTOPILOT
Without this, you may only have a nagging sense that something is wrong. However, the root problem may go undetected for weeks, or even months or years.
3

PROFIT AUTOPILOT
Once you implement this, you’ll start increasing the speed of growth, because feedback is built into day-to-day process.
3

PROFIT AUTOPILOT

Update your trackers more frequently if needed.

PROFIT AUTOPILOT

This can be as simple as a whiteboard with the current projects and projected completion dates.
