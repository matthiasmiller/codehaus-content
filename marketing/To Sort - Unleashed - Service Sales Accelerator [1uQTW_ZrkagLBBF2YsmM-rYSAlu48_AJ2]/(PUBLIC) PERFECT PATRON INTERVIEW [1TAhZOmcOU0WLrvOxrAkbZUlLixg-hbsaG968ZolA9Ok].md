# PERFECT PATRON INTERVIEW TEMPLATE

*One of the most common errors business owners make is **assuming** they know what their perfect patron is thinking and feeling. The goal of this interview is for them to reveal that **for us**.*

# STEP 1 | WRITE YOUR INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

There are 4 main areas you should structure your interview around, and they are related to the 5 P’s:

1. **Perfect Patron**: We want them to tell us about themselves.  
2. **Painful Problem**: We want them to tell us what’s wrong and how it feels.  
3. **Promised Land**: what would the ideal outcome look like from working with you? What do they wish you would give them?  
4. **Proven Process:** What kind of solution is your perfect patron looking for?  
   

*Use the example questions below as a guide. Choose the ones that feel most congruent with you and your perfect patron. Multiple choice questions will lead to more interviews completed, but giving opportunity for custom/long form answers will give you the most valuable content. Use a mix of both\!*

    1. As far as...for him...availability and flexibility  
    2. Didn’t look very long, or very many places...looked at a few software systems that were already built for shop operating, and i wasn’t quite sure that I wanted to go that route because I knew I woulsd end up trying to make something do that it wasn’t design to do, till we were done.  
    3. And then saw an ad for your custom software, and that’s what   
    4. It was available, so just went with that...  
14. What are some of the things you value the most in business software?  
15. **When you’re looking to find business software, where do you go for help?**  
    1. **He was in contact with a few, but got in contact with a salesman that was trying to sell him something, and think they had a solution that would have worked, but did talk with a few people, but not a lot. Did very little work on it before decided to give you us a try**  
16. Where do/did you feel most stuck or frustrated with business software?  
17. What do/did you think is keeping you stuck?

    2. **That may simply have been lack of education why it didn’t work the greatest**  
19. How does that difficulty affect your personal life? Your family life?

    1. It did takes  little bit of faith to just, he had nothing, and we put $10K down, and said “build it”. It was a little bit a stretch for him, but I think you guys sent something over, that I could take a look around. But for some reason, I don’t remember what that was. I think I had a look at what other work you did.  
24. **\[For Clients\] When we were working through the design phase, what problems did we help you solve that you weren’t aware that you had?**  
    1. There was a lot more to it, and we did run into things that you guys brought to my attention, it would be better to do it this way, or if we do this, it’ll cause a problem, if we do it a little different  
    2. 

    

    Wanting to go down the road of lean manufacturing, you don’t think about the next step, and now you can think a little further.

    

    # John \- Triple D

25. **What factors make the decision of who you would choose to go with for your business software?**  
    1. We had to go to somebody that was flexible enough to accommodate the customized software that we’re needing.  
    2. Somebody who was able to make something that was fully customized.  
    3. There were a lot of options out there that probably that would have worked or could have adapted to, or things that just didn’t  
    4.   
26. What are some of the things you value the most in business software?  
    1. Probably the biggest value in going with you guys, is we could customize as we grow into it, which I didn’t fully realize right when we started talking  
    2. He was talking about it being a one-and-done deal, and he’s seeing how much we can add on and integrate in the future  
    3. Biggest thing that you were looking for, was tracking and reports, how much of what size and which that they sold over the years, and also streamlining the order process  
27. **When you’re looking to find business software, where do you go for help?**   
    1. **First, he Googled to see what’s out there \-- looked at Spruce(?) building materials supplier software**  
       1. **10-15 different ones**  
    2. **A couple of others that he looked at and talked about, and just didn’t feel right**  
    3. **Had seen you guys’ ad and knew that you guys did custom stuff \- and said, you know what, we’re just going to build our own**  
28.   
29. Where do/did you feel most stuck or frustrated with business software?  
    1.   
30. What do/did you think is keeping you stuck?  
31. **What objections or limiting beliefs come up when thinking about getting business software working?**  
    1. He wasn’t even sure if he could explain what we were looking for, but it was great.. It’s been great. It’s been awesome. You guys jumped right on it, and know you guys   
    2. And it gives them the opportunity to buy in. That’s the beauty of it.  
32. How does that difficulty affect your personal life? Your family life?  
    1. For us, we’re tracking a lot more, just simply on paper the last 4-5 years than they would have done in the past  
    2. This gives us opportunity to decide if we want to stop more truss sizes (over winter is slow month), and it’s a perfect opportunity to knock out a couple hundred of select sizes, and if he can track the sizes and the specs and know exactly how much we sold consistently over the years, would have an opportunity there \-- to keep us busy over the winters, and allow capacity over the busy months  
    3. Biggest thing streamlining the order process, and having a more professional feel on the quote sheets and everything  
    4. There’s a piece of it that’s customer perception (??)  
33. If you could change 1 thing about your experience with business software, what would it be?  
34. What would you like to see to make that more of a reality for you?  
35. Why would that resource be helpful? What would change in your life/business as a result?  
36. **If I was to present you with a process to solve software problems and help you get the software you need, what would you need to see to believe it would work for you?**  
37. **\[For Clients\] When we were working through the design phase, what problems did we help you solve that you weren’t aware that you had?**  
    1. Not sure...I can’t really think of anything.
