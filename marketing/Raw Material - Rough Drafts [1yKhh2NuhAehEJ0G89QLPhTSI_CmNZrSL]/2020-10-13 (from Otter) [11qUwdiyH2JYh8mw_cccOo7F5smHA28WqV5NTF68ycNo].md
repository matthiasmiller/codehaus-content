How do you guarantee that your software solution is really going to do what you want it to do? This goes back to a handful of mindsets.

**Go for what you want, not for what you think you can have.** (hat tip to Dov Gordon).

The quality of your decisions depends on the quality of your clarity. If you're clear about where you are, where you want to go, and what you want to have, you will make rock solid, strong decisions. 

If you're unclear about that, then you're going to allow yourself to be influenced by other people.

Sometimes you don’t know where you need to be. You just know you want to be somewhere else. In that case you need to get around somebody who will give you clarity about what you actually need.  That's what you need to focus on until you have that clarity.

You don't have any right making decisions about next steps in your business. You need that clarity rather than just guessing.

**Don’t underestimate the cost of retail**. For some of our clients, it may be in their best interests to get a retail solution. But you have to weigh the costs:

* You do not actually have control of the system. It's you versus the hundreds or thousands of other users.  
* If there’s a major issue, they will fix it, but if you have a unique need or question, you may not get attention.

**Consider implementation cost.**

* Easy to underestimate implementation cost.  
* Many times implementation cost is high because there’s a specific model or path that you are expected to follow.  
* You need to understand how their system works and how they expect you to set it up. (Is it fully customizable and hard to even know where to start, or is it a rigid program?)

**Know your business processes before you get into the buying game.**

* Understand that the processes may need to be adjusted.  
* However, if you don't know your ideal business processes before you try to integrate software into it, you may end up backfitting your processes to match the software. You may have to downgrade your business processes in order to match the software.

**Every single thing you pay for is either an investment.** It’s either an investment *for opportunity*, or *against risk.* 

Example \#1: A point of sale system is an investment *for opportunity*. 

* You are buying reliability and accuracy in your engagement with your customers. You are buying efficiency (buying back time and labor). Save time for the people who are working for you.  
* You are also buying reporting and insight. You should be able to get insight into your ideal customer (what do they buy, when do they buy it, how often do they buy it, what are the types of things they are looking for, seasonal trends, all of those types of things.) Having access to that data and using that data yields a tremendous return on investment.


Example \#2: Having legal counsel, or a compliance person, is an investment *against risk*. They will pay for themselves by saving you from paying fines and fees if you aren’t in compliance.

Software is the same way. You have the cost of the software, and you have the return on that cost. 

You may be able to get what you need for $300/month, and you price that out against a $30,000 investment. Which one should you be looking at? It comes down to the question of, what is the return on your investment? A 10% return/month on the $300 is $360/year. It may be more or less, you have to figure it out. What is your return on the $30,000 investment?

* What does it give you?  
* What does it optimizes for you   
* What mistakes does it help you avoid?  
* What opportunities does it allow you to capitalize on?

With the data and insight that you get from the $30,000 investment, you may be able to determine things such as who are your most/least profitable customers? What are your most/least profitable profits? If it allows you to fire your least profitable customers or quit selling your least profitable products sooner, it will quickly pay for itself. You may be getting a 10% return/year on your investment, which would be $3,000/year vs $360/year.

NOTE: Can we use the 80/20 power curve to give an estimate of the kind of savings that could be gained by applying data/insight from custom software? IDEA: Talk to Perry about using the 80/20 power curve in a business, and what that would actually look like to establish profitability and the payoff for the business.

**Consider opportunity cost.** This is the biggest cost in your business, even if you can’t see it on your income statement.  What you choose *not* to spend money on is very likely to have a greater impact on your business than what you *do* choose to spend money on. 

If you could make an investment in your business that yielded a profitable return, and you don’t, you have the multiplication effect of that. Note: Traffic and Funnels may have a better idea how to explain opportunity cost.

Also, consider the lifetime cost of a retail solution versus a custom solution.

**Don’t just choose what you can see over what you can’t.**

Custom software may seem intangible and vague, especially compared to something you can see at a trade show in action. But custom software has a tangible process also, like the process of building a custom home. You walk through the process, build the software, and end up with a tangible product.

It’s often easy to go to a trade show and see a demo and assume that because the product already exists it will be cheaper or that you can make it work for you. But from our experience working with people it’s simply not always the case. You should get really clear about what it is you want and use that as an evaluation. Make sure you consider cost tracking metrics, etc, and how it will affect profitability. Use this as a matrix, then go after what you need and want. Don’t settle for  just what you think you can have.
