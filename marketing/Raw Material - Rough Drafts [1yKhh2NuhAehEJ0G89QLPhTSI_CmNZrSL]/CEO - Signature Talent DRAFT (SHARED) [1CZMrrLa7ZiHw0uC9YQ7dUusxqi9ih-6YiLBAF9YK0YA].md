# Your Signature Talent

## ***How to lead your team like a highly effective CEO, even if you're not a natural leader.***

Dear business owner,

Paul sat across the table from me, recounting his plans for the new year. “I need to figure out a way to do less.” He’d spun up a second business and had hit some roadblocks. I could tell from his demeanor that he was stressed and burned out.

“I’m not good at running a company,” he admitted. “Some days I wish I’d just be a crew foreman who could be out on the job, doing the work.”

As I listened to Paul’s story, I heard the story of hundreds others as well. You may have had the same thoughts, feelings, and doubts yourself:

* “My business grew past my comfort zone way too quickly.”  
* “I didn’t get into business to deal with the stuff I’m dealing with now.”  
* “I’m not sure whether my success is a fluke, or what to do to keep it going.”

All of those doubts are actually *quite* normal in the journey. The problem is, most people don’t talk about specifically what you must do to permanently silence those voices.

You may have heard leadership and business coaches tell you, “What got you here won’t get you there.” And while this is partially true, this statement embeds a deep-rooted lie.

**Your business success is a direct reflection of your Signature Talent**.

Solomon himself wrote, “Do you see a man who excels in his work? He will stand before kings;  
He will not stand before unknown men.”

You’ve used your special gift, unique knack, and individual skillset to grow your business. That Signature Talent may be sales, technical skills, management ability, craftsmanship, or even a combination. If you dig deeper, you may find that it comes from your special attention to detail, your ability to read people, or the way you can build exactly what people visualize.

As your business grows, it now requires additional talent to run. While your role in your business may change (or may stay mostly the same\!), you must become increasingly committed to understanding and using your Signature Talent.

This simple focus on your Signature Talent is the difference between leaders who become more fulfilled and productive over time, and those who become burned out from their own success.

If you’ve achieved your success through deep personal cost, it’s possible that you are just now arriving at the place where you can use your Signature Talent. If you find yourself becoming increasingly burned out, it’s possible that you have drifted from your Signature Talent.

Your commitment to your Signature Talent will be a crucial key to unlocking fulfilling business success.

However, it’s not all that’s required.

In the next few pages, you’ll discover three Priority Pillars that highly effective CEOs use in their business to simplify their lives and leadership.

As you learn about these Pillars, **trust yourself and your own talent**.

After I’ve introduced these concepts, I’ll share how you can start using these Pillars in your business without compromising who you are.

With that, let’s take a look at the first Pillar.

## Priority Pillar 1: From Tasks to People

In the early days of your business, you focused every day on the work that needed to be done. This is where everyone starts--whether you start your business as a salesperson, a technician, or a craftsman.

As you began hiring team members, you handed off specific pieces to them, making OTHERS responsible to make sure these get done. However, your primary focus remained on making sure the projects got completed as expected.

Moving beyond this requires a shift in focus. Highly effective CEOs have learned to move their focus from the tasks and projects to the **people** they need around them. They have discovered the answer for many problems in their business revolves around being able to put the right people in place to fix it.

Once they have a group of people they can absolutely trust who are aligned and equipped for their respective roles, they can accelerate their leadership and reduce the weight of their personal leadership.

Without this, you will continue fighting uphill as your responsibilities continue to increase. Even worse, doing this incorrectly will destroy the instinct to trust others with specific outcomes. As a leader, this instinct is something that you must fight to protect, but it requires insight and knowledge into how people work best.

By installing this first Priority Pillar, highly effective CEOs shift their primary responsibility from completing tasks and projects to finding, developing, and leading a handful of critical team players.

## Priority Pillar 2: From Problem-Solving to a System-Building

When your business is young, it’s easy to correct problems that arise. If a customer’s angry, you simply pick up the phone or go on-site, have a brief conversation, and resolve it.

However, as the business grows, you don’t have enough time in the day to address everything that could go wrong. Many business owners get stuck at this stage because they are too busy fixing problems to start actively working to prevent them.

Highly effective CEOs recognize this, and they start injecting predictability into the day-to-day of the business.

They learn to rely on systems to create predictability and prevent problems before they arise. Using Priority Pillar of a people-centered focus, they understand how to effectively create systems that serve the people who are working in the business, making sure these systems are flexible, adaptable, yet effective.

As a result, they experience a measurable boost not only in profitability but also in peace of mind as they begin implementing these systems.

The most effective CEOs take this one step further, focusing not only on system-building but on building a CULTURE that encourages the right attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. This creates an empowering environment for high-performing teams. It helps individuals take ownership of their responsibilities, creating built-in accountability within the business.

If this is done incorrectly, team members fight against the things that are expected of them. Sometimes, the team performance and morale is even worse than without the system.

## Priority Pillar 3: From Tactics to Strategy

In the early phases of your business, tactics matter immensely. Most likely, you are a master of your craft. You learned the business from top to bottom--the full details of how to do everything that needed to be done.

While strategy is often quite helpful at this stage of the process,most small businesses manage to lift off the runway through a deep commitment to a tremendous amount of hard work.

As your responsibilities grow, you have less time to focus deeply on specific tactical issues. You begin to focus on managing the work. With the proper systems in place, you can trust your team to handle the tactics.

However, focusing too heavily on tactics and the day-to-day can rob you of your time and blind you to the glaring threats or opportunities until it’s too late to truly capitalize on them.

Highly effective CEOs began spending less time thinking about the specifics of how things were implemented, and they started spending more time thinking about the crucial questions that drove the big picture of the business. They asked longer-term questions, leaving the specifics of the implementation to others.

Making one decision to tap into a new market, or to drop a specific product line, can make hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of dollars difference in your business. This is how these highly effective leaders were able to increase the value of their time by 10X, 100X, or (even if only for short periods of time) by 1000X.

If they had not made this shift, they would have continued to struggle to break (or even maintain) their current revenue ceiling without breaking themselves or their business.

## ….

These three shifts are like a three-legged stool. You must have each piece to keep the stool from tipping over.

This means that if you remove any of these three shifts, the whole thing comes tumbling down.

- If you remove UNIQUE ABILITY, you may be able to execute on your goals, but you will continually fight yourself and consistently underperform.  
- If you remove PEOPLE, you will hit the limits of your own performance. You will also sabotage the very foundation your business stands on.  
- If you remove STRATEGY, you will execute on well-intentioned but misaligned (and therefore ineffective) actions.  
- If you remove SYSTEMS, you will be so busy fighting fires that you won’t have time to think about strategy or people.

If you look at the places in your business where:

1. You are losing.  
2. You are burning out.  
3. You are fighting fires.

You will find these are the places where you have the least amount of clear-headed CEO thinking.

The question is...

## What If Your Unique Ability Isn’t Being a CEO?

As I’ve talked with business owners, I’ve noticed that many of them don’t actually WANT to be the CEO. They’re in business because they love the work that they do. For many of them, it’s actually a relief to hear that their unique ability isn’t being the CEO.

However, it sometimes brings with it fear and insecurity.

1. Do I need to keep my business small?  
2. Will I need to sell my business?  
3. How do I get my business to work despite that?

The question, ironically, lies in the CEO thinking.  This is not about you focusing on the PROJECT. It’s about you focusing on the PEOPLE.

In other words, **“Who can fill in the gaps of HELPING you think as a CEO?”**

This question brings a unique challenge, because as the owner, there is NO ONE who’s as committed to making your business succeed as yourself. And NO ONE knows your business as well as you do. In fact, bringing in someone without that knowledge can bring tremendous harm to your business.

As you approach this, you have two options:

1. Find an industry expert who can tell you how to ACT  
2. Find a CEO mindset expert who can teach you how to THINK

The first kind of coaching programs requires less upfront effort. You can do a “paint by numbers” response, push through the discomfort while hoping not to encounter any issues they can’t instruct you on.

The second type of coaching program requires more short-term effort, but it is WILDLY more effective in the long-term. This will give you powerful insights that will burn in your mind for years to come.

The final question is this:

## How Do You Make This Practical?

We know that business owners like you want to get back to doing the things that they love. We want to see you succeed by helping you with the heavy lifting of your CEO burden.

We’ve created a coaching program to help you do just that. **TODO \- fill in details**

Do you remember the days when you were excited to show up at your business because you got to interact with the customers? Do you remember the joy of building things--watching your work take shape and enjoying the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day? Do you miss the discussions and bantering that you enjoyed on the job?

If so, you’re not alone.

I studied under one of the highest paid business strategists in the world. One of his personal advisors began to actively mentor me, up to 5 hours a week at the peak. I collaborated with another mentor of his, a now-billionaire investor who founded one of the top 5 consulting firms in the US.

I trained under one of the top training companies in the world on sales and marketing, an experience that transformed my understanding of how the game of business is actually played, and how the most successful people in the world actually think.

I became certified in instinctive strengths, diving deep into the foundations of high-performing individuals and teams. I began to vigorously apply this to our team, our clients, and our partners.

I studied under two coaches who specialize in operations and systems for entrepreneurs. I marveled at the results when I began to implement even the simplest of these systems.

This does NOT include the providential relationships with people along the way who brought insight I could never have predicted.

## The 3 Shifts From Owner-Operator to CEO

Before I share the insights I learned, it’s important to understand the three levels in business.

## The Ladder of Business

Every business can be simplified into three parts:

1. Doing the work  
2. Managing the work  
3. Leading the people

The smaller the business, the more closely connected these pieces are. However, as the business grows, the distance between continues to grow.

If you’re facing a plateau in your business, it’s almost always because you’re trying to solve your current problem at the wrong level. These plateaus almost always require a **mental shift** to get past your current level.

In fact, if you’re struggling with a seemingly unsolvable problem, it’s probably because you’re approaching the problem from the wrong level.

As I’ve observed my own leadership growth, as well as the path of successful leaders, I’ve found four critical shifts that are required for most business owners wanting CEO-level leadership.

## Shift 0: From Achievement to Unique Ability

As I’ve studied healthy leaders closely, I’ve observed that burnout from the *wrong work* is often more severe than the burnout from *too much work*.

**Successful leaders focus on their unique ability to the exclusion of almost everything else**.

This creates a strong, virtuous cycle:

1. They work on things they’re naturally good at and they love.  
2. They become even better at what they do.  
3. Because of this, they create a tremendous amount of value in a short time.  
4. They become energized not only by the RESULTS, but also by the PROCESS.

Every day, they’re re-energized by the work that they do. They create an energetic, productive culture around them because they’re winning almost every single day.

Contrast that with leaders who don’t focus on their unique ability.

1. They struggle to motivate themselves to do the work.  
2. They have to push themselves to keep doing it better.  
3. They make mistakes in their work, creating longer-term problems.  
4. When they’re done, they’re too exhausted to focus on anything else.

They end their days feeling exhausted and defeated. While they are motivated by the outcome, they find it impossible to fall in love with the process. And while they can achieve the results they want, it comes at significant personal expense (and the expense of their team).

Keep in mind that the reason you’re in business is to give you permission to decide exactly how you want to show up in your business. In this case, you are the one who gets to make the rules.

If you notice the three levels of leadership, you’ll note one important shift in the third: **the movement from a focus on the work to a focus on the people**.

Many business owners experience a very noticeable improvement in their profitability and sanity when they start implementing the proper systems. However, highly effective CEOs elevate this
