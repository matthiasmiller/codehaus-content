Client billing is a critical part of protecting business revenue.

Mistakes lead to:  
\* under-billing (direct profitability hit)  
\* over-billing (bad for client relationships)  
\* delayed billing (inefficient cash flow).

We've had a number of businesses that struggled to get it done accurately and efficiently. We encouraged them to consider a few things:

\-The highest leverage thing you can do is to simplify and standardize your billing. Every time you make an exception for a client, you make it twice as hard to automate your billing process. Sometimes it's as simple as switching long-term clients to a new model. Other times, it's a much more involved process to find a better model or structure altogether. If you're unable to simplify, your exceptions appear deceptively simple but are disproportionately difficult to automate.

\-Closing the gap between all parties substantially decreases errors and redundant effort. This includes the account representative or salesperson who negotiates details with clients, the fulfillment team incurring the actual expense (including time spent if tracking labor), and the accounting team responsible for the billing process. This is especially helpful to track profitability on fixed price proposals, or accuracy of estimates on time and material estimates. It allows measurement on a granular level.

\-Creating very simple API or import/export connections between multiple systems greatly reduces overall cost. When possible, choose one system as a primary reporting tool and source of truth, and allow the other to only include the required summary data. This eliminates a significant amount of complexity and cost. In almost all of our engagements, deep integration across multiple systems looked deceptively simple from the client's perspective and ended up being surprisingly involved in the actual implementation.

At the end of the day, the goal is to maximize business benefit for the effort invested. Using these principles for implementing billing systems, our clients have enjoyed the benefits of:

\-lower training/onboarding costs  
\-less back-and-forth communication across departments  
\-less confusion on how to bill specific clients  
\-greater percentage of work billed to clients   
\-faster processing of client billing  
\-fewer mistakes in client billing

The bottom line is that the more chaos you eliminate in your finances, the more monetary upside you enjoy in your business. Our clients have found that nailing down your client billing is great step in that direction.
