***GREAT POLL :-)***

A great engineer does not always make a great manager or leader.

These things come down to such as:  
\- tolerance for change  
\- need for stimulation  
\- appetite for influence  
\- willingness to negotiate

Exceptionally skilled technicians often become less fulfilled with each promotion.

By the time they realize this, they may have an entire team, department, or company relying on them. They've adapted their lifestyle to their compensation. They've snapped shut their golden handcuffs. 

A natural leader may suffer under entry-level with, but will become more fulfilled with each promotion. Every promotion brings them closer to their unique abilities. They operate with greater excitement and higher excellence.

It may be that having an awful start to a career is a gift, if you can make your way through the ranks.

It may also be that if you have an excellent start to your career, you'll be best served as becoming a top 1% technician and protecting your health and fulfillment.

Of course, there are those who are highly adaptive and who climb to the top, enjoying every step of the way. Those who can work in technical details and strategic leadership, bridging the worlds of people and things, are highly productive leaders.

We've recognized for a long time that promoting individuals can stunt they're growth and hurt their performance. (Pete Principle, anyone?) These are far from new ideas. Yet, it's a practice that continues.

Any thoughts why, or what to do about it?
