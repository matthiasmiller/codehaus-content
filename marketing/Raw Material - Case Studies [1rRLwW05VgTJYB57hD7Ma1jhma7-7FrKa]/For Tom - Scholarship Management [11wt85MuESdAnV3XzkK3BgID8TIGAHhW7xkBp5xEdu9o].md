# For Tom \- Scholarship Management

Project two, was Faith Builders and here is a note to self, I don't know if we'd be able to nail down how much growth they experienced because of the systems we put together. But I think probably I've got some cases of information that I could include but bottom line, they were an organization that manages scholarships for private schools.

And businesses get 70 to 90% tax credit, based on those contributions. And they were managing all this stuff in Excel. And so first round was, helping them deal with a very confusing process of making sure all their numbers tie out, the right people are getting paid the right amount, the right kids are getting the right scholarship amounts, and a bazillion moving parts, to make sure that everything's right.

And so, round one was putting together a system to help track that. And there were a few benefits that they experienced. Number one, there was a lady who'd been there for quite some time and all this information was in her head. Which kind of ended up being a bit of a liability and it was a lot of responsibility on her part as well. And especially around certain parts of the year, very tight deadlines to get things done and it had to be done and it had to be done right and she was the one with all the knowledge and how to do it. And so we were able to remove that pressure from her, and create the opportunity, make it easier for them to start to bring on another team member to help her out.

Number two is, there was certainly an increase in level of accuracy and they gained a huge confidence in their numbers because they just knew it was right.

Number three was, the reconciliation process between their management system and their accounting system. Went from one day of lock yourself in a room, don't let anybody knock or go in, slide food under the door, whatever it takes, and make sure that all the numbers reconcile for the year-end. And after the system, they did it in an hour, with multiple interruptions and distractions along the way and we're able to prove that all the numbers checked out with minimal headache.

Now, if that were the end of the story, that'd be kind of interesting, but it's not. The state of Pennsylvania also has something called, special purpose entities, which are LLCs that allow people to open this up to a broader range of individuals.

The first one was just for businesses. So you had to be doing it through a business, to get these benefits. But with SPE, you can basically become a member of a special purpose entity, almost like a shop company and you can join up with other people, to gain these tax benefits as an individual. And they were just starting to apply for these in the state of Pennsylvania and they had a large amount of demand for people who wanted to capitalize on this. But man, they were managing in Excel again and it was very, very cumbersome to pull off.

So we put together a system, a second system for them on the applicant side of things, to help manage these special purpose entities, allow people to become members, track membership amounts, dollar amounts, membership percentages, dollar amounts, state applications, filing requirements, filing deadlines, payment deadlines, email notifications, all of the things that go into making sure this works and happen smoothly.

I do not have exact numbers, but I would warrant to say that, on the heels of implementing that... Oh goodness, I shouldn't be making up numbers, I need to go chase down numbers and see if we can find numbers, but got to be on the low side. I'm going to estimate it's two to five x there. What they've been able to, the funds they've been able to manage in a two-year period probably.

And on top of this, they also receive a management fee for the funds that they do manage. And it's allowed them to, I mean it's given them capacity to grow some of their own programs internally, as a result of that. So that's project number two.
