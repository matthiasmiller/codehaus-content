# For Tom \- Logistics

The “new horizons thrift store” pickup and delivery system, way, way back. They were originally using papers and printouts and manually scheduling stops and doing all kinds of things to schedule their pickups and deliveries. And I put together a system for them, that created a streamlined system.

So when somebody sells something at the front, they could immediately enter that into the logistics system, so that they could get scheduled for delivery. Once it got scheduled, auto calculating a drag and drop between routes and auto calculating driving time, number of stops per day, stop time and basically getting down to the minutes scheduling for, well, it varies but down to the minutes scheduling for these stops.

And so, saving a lot of time on the taking care of things falling through the cracks, between checkout and the folks in the back. Saving time on the scheduling front because now they could schedule, they had a visual for where things were laid out and could schedule them in the ideal order and sequence for driving time. And then on the back end of that, also providing access to the drivers on their phones, to be able to quickly punch in the Addison, the GPS. Flag stops is completed or missed, or requiring follow up. And once again, making sure that customers don't fall through the cracks that way.

One of the major wins was, as a result of this system, they were able to... I have to go back to my notes, see if I can find it. But I believe they were doing about 2-4X, the number of stops per day, that then some of their competitors and or kind of industry averages were. Which comes down to, when it comes to vehicles and to labor costs, that is a substantial monetary savings because of the efficiency.

Little caveat on that one, is that we wanted to make it bigger and better. They didn't want to. I didn't want to make the investment after I was no longer on staff wages, but it's a case study. Trying to think if there's anything else it would be helpful to include with that one.  
Jaron:

Well, I was a beneficiary of that, because when I was in the thrift store, I was in the office. Or I was in the thrift store, but I did flex some of the office work and so, I got to benefit from the scheduling stuff and having all that, having a whole system set up. So thank you for that.  
Matthias:

You're welcome. Are there anything that you would add to that or anything in your own words about, I don't know, benefits that you experienced yourself?  
Jaron:

I don't know. I think it was easy to work with. I was answering phones and so to have a customer call in, it was really easy to give them a quick answer. And I don't know, to have a response to their questions, whether it was scheduling, or how long it was going to be until someone showed up, or stuff like that. Made it really easy to answer customers questions.  
Matthias:

And you can see real time, which stops had already been completed. So you...  
Jaron:

Right. So I can see where they're at and like, "Oh okay, they're going to be there in two stops." So stuff like that made, it was like, and it was easy. I don't know, usually it made for an easy win on our end with the customer, to have these answers and stuff like that.  
Matthias:

Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And the other thing I forgot about was, when you scheduled the stop, you could actually set a scheduled date at the checkout, at the register. And we would basically know whether the schedule was full for a given day, or given week. And you give the customer a heads-up right away. When they should be expecting it.  
Jaron:

Right.  
Matthias:

So, I don't know how you tie out monetary benefits to customer service and happy customers, but it's definitely there.  
Jaron:

Yeah.  
Matthias:

Good. And note to self here, I actually, just today got done putting together a redacted copy of our revised, or version 2.0 proposal that we put together for them. So, that might be something to include. I don't know, it's probably too much to include for Tom, but hey, maybe. All right, so that's project one.
