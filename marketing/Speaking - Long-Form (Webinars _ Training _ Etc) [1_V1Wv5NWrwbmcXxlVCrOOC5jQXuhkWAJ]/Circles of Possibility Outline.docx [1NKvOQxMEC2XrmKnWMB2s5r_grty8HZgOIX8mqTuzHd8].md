1. Introduction  
   1. Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to jump into this training with me.  
   2. First a little introduction.  
      1. I’m a professional coach, so I spend a lot of time working around issues of personal growth, limiting beliefs, mindset shifts, human relationships, and motivation.  
      2. I’ve noticed, however, that many times, growth creates DISCONNECTION rather than CONNECTION  
      3. I’ve watched people shut down and disconnect from my visions of the future.   
   3. This morning I was talking with a friend over coffee, and we began talking about relating to other people who are at a different level.  
   4. For example, it’s easier to sell a training program to a novice than to an expert  
   5. However, my friend started talking to me about intimidation.  
   6. At some point, the difference between two people can become so great that it creates distance.  
      1. This usually shows up as intimidation or a fear of being manipulated.   
      2. Especially in the world of leadership, or in the world of sales.  
   7. In a flash, I had a huge insight that I’m call the “Circles of Possibility”  
   8. As we started applying it, both of us started getting huge insight into various situations, where we cut ourselves off from other people because of this principle.  
   9. I literally came home and put together this training, because I wanted you to be able to make use of it.  
2. Where does this show up?  
   1. Every kind of relationship with a greater/lesser power  
   2. What it looks like depends on whether you’re the more powerful person in the relationship   
      1. If you’re more powerful, you may end up driving people away, or inviting yourself to be attacked  
      2. If you’re less powerful, you may end up in the FIGHT or FLIGHT – either running away, or trying to attacking them  
   3. I’ll look at these in more detail later.  
3. Circles of Responsibility  
   1. Let’s start by introducing this concept  
   2. Doing – what are you doing right now?  
   3. Growth – what’s the next step?  
   4. Stretch – what if I push myself?  
   5. Impossible – no comprehension  
   6. For example:  
      1. For some, doubling their income is a stretch  
      2. For others, speaking to a group of 10 people is a stretch, but to a thousand is impossible  
4. Next  
   1. Growth is a natural process  
      1. Your DOING gets bigger  
      2. Your STRETCH moves closer  
      3. Some of your IMPOSSIBLE moves into your STRETCh  
   2. Most people are unprepared for the consequences  
      1. Changes your relationships with others  
      2. Sometimes our friends are still in the same spot  
      3. Look at the comparison  
      4. Your STRETCH is in the middle of their possibility  
   3. What happens?  
      1. When you talk about your STRETCH, their mental circuits start flipping, and they begin to question you  
      2. They begin to lose trust, because what you’re talking about lands in their area of impossible **\[\[CUT\]\]**  
      3. Now, I’m going to give you some practical ways to deal with this later, but first I want to give you some examples.  
   4. Examples  
      1. I see this with leaders who want to take an organization to a certain level  
         1. People around them say it’s not possible and can’t be done.  
         2. It’s a conflict between the growth of the leader and  the rest of the organization  
         3. It’s a matter of having wandered outside their circle of possibility  
      2. I see this in a lot of WEALTH programs.  
         1. Most skeptical of, but most drawn  
         2. Want to know that they can do more and be more  
         3. But if they fail to make that shift, they’re like to do one of two things  
            1. See themselves as a foolish buyer  
            2. See the sellers as ruthless ales people  
         4. I understand that fraud does happen.  
            1. However, many times it’s simply this dynamic at play  
   5. Just briefly, we relate to people differently in different circles.  
      1. CONNECTION happens in DOING  
      2. ENCOURAGEMENT happens in the GROWTH  
      3. EMPOWERMENT happens STRETCH  
      4. But many people cannot make the leap beyond that, and they simply cut themselves off after that point.  
   6. The key to relationship is learning how to connect to someone where they’re at, and growth them from there, so you don’t completely cut them off.  
5. Breaking Limiting Beliefs  
   1. Most people approach growth incrementally. Speaking in front of 5 people, then 6 people  
   2. The issue is that the distance between STRETCH and IMPOSSIBLE is not an incremental shift; it’s an exponential shift, and order of magnitude.  
   3. It’s not about going from 5 people to 6 people; it’s about going from 10 people to 100 people.  
   4. It’s not about making 1000 more dollars a year; it’s about doubling and tripling your income. At what point do your mental circuits start to flipping?  
   5. It’s not about working 40 hours per week instead of 50\. It’s about working 1 day instead of 5\.  
   6. The reason why many people mistrust wealthy people is simply because they cannot see the possibility  
   7. Here’s why: the rules don’t change with incremental growth, but they do with exponential growth  
   8. The reason that a lot of people hit barriers is because they are trying to achieve incremental growth.  
      1. Incremental growth brings questions of EFFICIENCY and EFFORT  
      2. Exponential growth brings questions about FUNDAMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS, APPROACHES, etc.  
   9. To break past your limiting beliefs and actions, you don’t just need a TWEAK. You need a FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT  
   10. Instead of thinking about 10 people, think about 100 people.  
   11. You can’t solve big problems with a little mindset. You have to change your mindset and approach.  
6. Application  
   1. Leader, Seller, Mentor   
      1. Your \#1 goal is to grow people’s circle of possibility  
      2. It has to start from their context  
         1. Be aware of where your others around you are  
         2. Look for factors of intimidation and mistrust  
      3. Use that awareness to connect with them  
      4. Then build a build  
      5. Once you build a bridge, you can start introducing fundamental mindset shifts that create a framework for the place that you want to take them.  
      6. However, it’s important to relate to them out of THEIR circle of possibility and not their own, and use that as a leverage point to grow them  
      7. Then, use that as a leverage point to grow their circle of responsibility  
      8. Otherwise, once you move past a certain point, they become unable to catch what you’re saying because you’ve moved too far past it.  
   2. High-Impact mentoring  
      1. This is where high-impact mentoring and leadership happens, because it allows you to accelerate people by introducing fundamental shifts in the approach  
      2. And thus get exponential results  
   3. Follower, Buyer, Mentee  
      1. Becoming aware of our own internal limitations  
      2. To some degree, it means learning to be able to trust other people more than ourselves  
      3. Relating to other people in search for that FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT that makes their perspective plausible
