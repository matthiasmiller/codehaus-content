* Introduction & Welcome  
* Outcome-based leadership is the path to ownership  
  * Leadership operates at different levels:  
    * One is the OUTCOME that we’re trying to achieve  
    * One is the WAY we go about achieving that outcome  
  * For example, if you have a donor newsletter, what’s the MOST significant outcome that you’re after?  
    * That it doesn’t have typos?  
    * That it goes out on schedule?  
    * That people open it?  
    * That people read it?  
    * That people give in response?  
    * That people build long-term trust and connection?  
  * For your organization, the most significant outcome is that you can create is transformation for your clients. However, this has supporting outcomes:  
    * You must have a way to fund what you’re doing.  
      * You must have a way to build long-term donor relationships.  
        * You must have a way to invite them to give.  
        * You must have a way to communicate with them.  
        * (You could go down the path of, this is how you build a newsletter.)  
      * You must have a way to secure grants  
        * You must find applicable grants.  
        * You must apply for them  
        * You must secure them  
  * Imagine what happens to your time as leader, when you:  
    * Hand your staff grants to fill out  
    * Check in with them constantly on the results  
    * Assign them to first write articles for the newsletter, then assign them to proofread them, then take them to the printers, then stuff envelopes, and so on…  
  * Writer-downer \-- “One-off projects are a threat to the sustainability of your organization.”  
    * My leadership has evolved from “let’s do this” and “please do this” and trying to keep people busy, to…  
    * Helping people create ownership  
* Understanding ownership  
  * Even though different people have different M.O.s….people were created for rulership, to have a specific domain.  
    * Different people at different levels of leadership have responsibilities for different sizes of outcomes.  
    * (Diagram this)  
      * Board has the greatest responsibility of the outcome  
      * ED  
      * Management team has individual parts  
      * Staff lower  
  * The problem with micromanagement is that it creates rulership over people, and people will always resist being DOMINATED.  
  * "If part of your story was that people have always projected or tried to clothe you with their own ideas of who you should be and the decisions you should make and where you should go, then what happens is, you probably grew a distant relationship with responsibility to adapt and adjust to people's definitions of you." \-Dr Matthew Stevenson  
  *   
  * It’s important to understand two types of leadership:  
    * Task-driven leadership \- i.e., do this, this, and this...  
    * Outcome-driven leadership \- i.e. here’s the outcome we want:  
      * We want to have donors who keep coming back to us time and again  
      * We want engaging newsletters  
      * We want \_\_\_\_\_  
  * Everyone is responsible for achieving different OUTCOMEs. However, the SIZE of the outcome can vary from person to person.  
    * Should go without saying, but the size of the outcome may affect the value of the individual to the organization, but does not speak to the organization’s value.  
    * Another lie from recruiting, etc…  
* Misconceptions about ownership  
  * The flipside is the “here you go, figure it out”. This is NOT outcome-driven leadership.  
  * Many times, Ian and I will do something once, creating a rough outline for the process that should be used, then turn it over the person responsible to continue to adapt, tweak, and improve .  
* Understanding systems  
  * Systems thinking for non-systems people  
    * Not all of us are naturally systems-oriented thinkers, but it can be really useful to understand basic systems thinking…  
  * Diagram  
    * Systems ruling over people, vs.  
    * People ruling over systems  
  * It basically comes down to this:  
    * WHEN this happens, or WHEN you need to do this....  
    * Here are the steps  
    * So you’ll get this outcome.  
  * RULE: Change or improve the steps at any time.  
* Examples:  
  * We use software tools to create SUPPORT and ACCOUNTABILITY around our responsibilities.  
  * For example, we have email reminders that are sent out to different team members for our leadership journal that we publish, on a specific monthly schedule.  
  * We have certain checklists and processes that we have when onboarding our clients.  
  * When there’s an achievement oriented approach, it’s helpful to have a centralized place to keep the tasks, a manager can help organize/prioritize and people can pick off with some discretion  
  * *Wiki example*  
* Defining roles from a systems approach...  
  * A big breakthrough for us was understanding that people fill multiple roles.  
  * For example, you may have an individual that serves as:  
    * Volunteer Manager  
    * Program Manager  
    * Events Manager  
    * *Having each of those roles separately defined, is powerful, especially when you have overlapping roles.*  
    * *This helps to reduce SIGNIFICANT confusion when defining roles.*  
  * What we’ve found works well:  
    * Defining the outcomes  
    * Having details about that managed through other means, such as check lists, reminders,   
  * Also:  
    * Many things come down to repeatable steps.  
    * The key is knowing their knowledge and instincts, to know where to provide support in the process  
    *   
  * Depending where you are on this structure, changes how you relate to this.  
  *   
* Defining Roles  
  * What are the actual TASK or RESPONSIBILITIES? How to define job descriptions? Tools:  
    * Time-based:  
      * What are things that happen daily?  
      * What are things that happen weekly?  
      * What are things that happen quarterly?  
      * What are things that happen annually?  
    * People-based  
      * Who are the people that this person relates to? And how?  
    * Sequence or event-based  
      * When this happens, that should happen.  
    * Access-based  
      * What are software tools, and such?  
      * Passwords?  
      * Physical access?
