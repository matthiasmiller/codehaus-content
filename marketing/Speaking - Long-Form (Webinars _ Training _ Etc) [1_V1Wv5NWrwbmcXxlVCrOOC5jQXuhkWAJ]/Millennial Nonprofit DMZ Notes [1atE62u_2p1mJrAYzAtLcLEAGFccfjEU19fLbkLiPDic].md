**What do you think is happening good in our region in the nonprofit arena?**

* The opportunities to connect w/ those who are in the nonprofit world.  
* Lots of nonprofits in our area.   
* Opportunity to move the community forward. Nonprofits have the opportunity to be nimble, unlike corporations and government.  
* They can be the driver of where our community goes.   
* Having the combination  
* We’re being more adaptable. Taking the best of the older generation \- respecting that \- and adapting them to today.   
* There is a great deal of will and desire to move the nonprofit sector forward.   
* We’re on the precipice of creating more structures and framework using social media.   
* We’re right there and it’s exciting.   
* **Esp. Co. Springs being a relational community**, not enough--there are groups that serve niches, but millennials being relational and being able to trust, it would be beneficial to move forward working together. Being able to collaborate. Having that relationship.   
* The economic impact that the nonprofit sector is making. Ability to work together since they’re so saturated, which is so much better than competition.   
* What does it mean, saturated? We have so many nonprofits that have very similar missions. A lot of people doing great work, would love to see them work together more?  
* What I love about this community is over 3,000 nonprofits--that is incredible\! The passion people have--we’re passionate about what we do. I love the nonprofit sector and hope it continues\!  
* Very successful is we have a very mature funding landscape created on the back of others before them. Light-years ahead of other places for getting grants. It’s easier for nonprofits to thrive here than in other states.    
* More diversity in the nonprofit sector. 

**Why does this region create saturation for nonprofits?**

* Such a melting pot, with the military. Innovation from all over the country and all over the world.   
* The culture lends itself to wanting to help other people.   
* Our generation has a bleeding heart. We are more emotionally mature--able to communicate our emotions. So we are able to communicate more freely.   
* An incredible number of faith based nonprofits.   
* Colorado Springs is a unique community because, for better or for worse, we are a no-government, hands-off culture and the nonprofit fills the sector. 

**Are millennials being engaged properly in this sector? You have things to say and bring to the table. Are you being listened to and engaged? What generation leads them?** 

* From what I’ve seen, it depends on the org. \--when they have less of a hierarchy. I’ve also seen nonprofits who don’t.   
* Gen-X/middle-aged.   
* The power of nonprofits lie in a generation not our own.   
* It depends on the nonprofit. In the rural culture, it was harder to be heard and received. Groups that weren’t receptive of millennials are on the downward spiral because they aren’t adapting and representing our generation. I see a decline there.   
* Not being represented. Without us they will decline and without them, we won’t get where we want to go.   
* What’s missing is for the generation that holds the power to take the risk to innovate to create new models. They need to be willing to put their skin in the game since they wait to take the risk until it’s proven.   
* I think that it varies from org. to org. I feel like I have the ability to be heard in one department and I’m told what to do in the other. If everyone is willing to be uncomfortable and try new things, then it will work better. We need to find a common middle ground--to continue doing things the way we have as well as to try new things.   
* Some more hierarchical, others more collaborate. I see benefits to both. We’re going to see more of our age more likely to take the collaborative approach.   
* We have a lot of millennials in our org. but there is a lot of turnover. I wish they could stay in this work and continue to stay passionate. I think it might be economic.   
* The perceived value of our work is diminished because of lack of pay. The only sector where you’re expected to be paid with good feelings. Some come in thinking that pay doesn’t matter. But then they realize it doesn’t work and then they leave.   
* If you can’t do nonprofit work full time, I wonder if it’s sustainable.   
* We’re seeing that nonprofit employees are doing more work in a day, just as more employees are doing more work in a given day. Thus less people have time to volunteer.   
* A lot of people are struggling with debt and working a lot more trying to pay it off, and not enough time to volunteer.   
* Financial stress makes it hard to bring your whole self to the table because of the bills.   
* Incorrect idea that overhead \= waste. Employment benefits \= waste. I couldn’t afford not to find a different job. I needed insurance. I wanted to buy a house and buy groceries.  And I couldn’t do that in the nonprofit sector. I’m working 60 hours/week for a nonprofit without benefits. The older generation isn’t listening to the younger generation.   
* Not just the pay but being able to make a go of it in life.   
* My single mom who was an effective executive director left the nonprofit sector because the board wouldn’t give her life/disability insurance.   
* I would love to go back to the nonprofit sector, but it’s hard to because of the low wages. 

**What are some good things that would make millennials want to engage in the nonprofit arena?**   
**Make the org. look the way you want. What wouldn’t you change?**   
**You’re in charge now. You’re running this thing. What would you like to keep--what’s been done well in the nonprofit sector from your perspective?** 

* Procedures and tools to keep things organized.   
* Core communities that have been built in the Pikes Peak region. The community of collaboration in the Springs region.   
* The positive culture.   
* A lot of support to move millennials from associate to directorship.   
* The amount of resources to help nonprofits create the structure they need to be successful--ie. Nonprofit Disruptors, Center for Nonprofit Excellence.  
* A move toward running a nonprofit like a business--keep moving that direction.   
* Head for business, heart for mission. This is great\!   
* I would like to keep the hard work ethic from the past generation and the ability to do more when needed. 

**Why are you in nonprofit work? I love working for nonprofits because...**

* I feel like what I’m doing matters.   
* I took a paycut to work in a nonprofit. I still get by. The culture is amazing and what we do is cool. I get to be surrounded by that every day.   
  Name change needed? Nonprofit → For Impact Organization.   
* I get paid to give back.   
* I’ve never been paid for what I do. But it’s my calling.   
* I think we can have vocation supporting avocation.  
* You don’t have to get paid to make an impact; you have to prioritize it.   
* I don’t think nonprofit employees need to be martyrs. Not a lot of money coming into this sector. 

**What are we going to do to make nonprofits more viable financially?** 

* Humans want to matter.   
* Our corporation will not donate if we don’t get an ROI. We measure it and we won’t give if they don’t meet up.   
* No tangible measurement of the nonprofit aspect.   
* Creating models that are sustainable--coupling nonprofit with for-profit orgs.   
* Such a lack of financial education in how to use their money wisely.   
* 80+% donations come from individuals.  
* Fundraising is sales.

Can we keep this going? Maybe a mastermind?   
Thank you for caring and listening and for trying to do something about this.
