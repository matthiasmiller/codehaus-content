Three types of movement:

1. Movement only (No business model)  
2. Movement / movement-based business (impact prioritized over profit)  
   1. When you run a movement based business, you might bring less money home  
3. Business with movement-based marketing

1. Path to a life of financial freedom and fulfillment:  
   1. Most should be choosing movement-marketing  
   2. The most impactful movement makers do not have financial pressure.  
   3. Sometimes we don’t take care of ourselves because we have such big hearts.  
   4. The only way to be sustainable is to have financial viability.  
   5. *Do you have a small m-movement?*  
   6. Which phase 1?  
2. Take me to the promised land  
   1. Movement makers move people.  
   2. People buy what they want, not what they need.  
   3. Helping people go from the problem and where they’re at, to the promised land, where they get the results and the outcome they desire.  
   4. I am in the business of From/To.  
   5. I am in the From/To business.  
   6. The people need to know they have a problem before they show up, and they want help.  
   7. If you want to help someone who doesn’t know they have a problem, you have to first convince them of the problem, then convince them of your solution. That’s at least twice as much work.  
   8. Have you ever experienced the pain and frustration of trying to help/serve someone who didn’t know they had a problem, or acknowledge the problem but don’t want help?  
   9. Movement marketing is about being the leader in your niche and your industry.  
   10. People buy the HOPE of an outcome.  
   11. Sell breakthrough at a discount.  
       1. $5k for $1k  
       2. $10k for $2k  
       3. $100k for $20k  
2. Clarity Is Calling  
   1. I must fight for the clarity.  
   2. I must wrestle for the words.  
   3. I must define my distinctions.  
   4. I must define my difference.  
   5. I must identify how I can interrupt and interject myself into a conversation.  
   6. I help…  
      1. Executive directors of nonprofit child & family service nonprofits  
   7. Win at virtual fundraising  
   8. By executing value-focused challenges for their ideal donor.  
   9. When you can figure out paid traffic  
3. Question  
   1. Who can you serve now? Who do you want to serve? Who should you serve now?  
   2. How clear are you about the “who?”  
   3. How Clear Am I About the Result, Big Promise, or Transformation That I Provide?  
      1. What’s the big promise?
