3. What’s a movement maker, and why should I be a movement maker?  
4. Two ways to think about this:  
   1. Movement First business (business comes second)  
      1. Some of us will have the movement be primary, then the business will be birthed out of the movement and will support the movement, and will help you fund it as fast and grow it as fast as you want  
      2. You will probably always choose impact over profit margin  
   2. Business First business (using movement marketing methods to grow the business)  
      1. You have certain specific financial goals. Specific profit margin expectations. THen you prioritize the business first, then you use movement-based marketing  
      2. You will probably be more concerned with maintaining profit margins and using movement-style marketing  
   3. These principles will work for both.

   3. Over two years ago, was a financial planner, was doing events, workships, seminars, etc and learn online marketing. Before that, went through a difficult season.
