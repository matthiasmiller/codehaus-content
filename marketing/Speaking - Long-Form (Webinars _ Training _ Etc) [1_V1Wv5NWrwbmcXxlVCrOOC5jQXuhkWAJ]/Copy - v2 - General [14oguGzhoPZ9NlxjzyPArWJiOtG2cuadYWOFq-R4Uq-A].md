Dear kingdom-driven marketplace leader,

Do you have a team member....on your team RIGHT NOW...who knows their way around, is trying their best at their job…

...and yet they can’t seem to get it together?

Not bad enough to fire them (yet)…but not good enough to promote them, either… It’s slowing the rest of the team down...maybe even slowing YOU down…

And your team meetings are revolving doors of trying to find tips, tricks, and hacks to keep them motivated?

With good talent hard to find, here’s the good news…

I’ve discovered it really IS possible to help team members like this find their place, so you can have a team that is low-drama, hardworking, highly motivated, and has fun along the way…

Took a few bumps for me to learn how, though…

I got into a software career where I received encouragement and accolades, mixed with baffled confusion on why someone so GOOD at their job could be so UNFULFILLED…

Makes me Case Study \#1...

It finally drove me to strike out on my own. When I hired my first team member, I goofed big time…Great guy, wrong role, and I didn’t have room to move him elsewhere…

I took the time to apply the lessons from everything I’d devoured over the years, and that’s when things began to change...

My second employee I hired as an independent contractor for a consulting project...my client raved about her after they’d struggled for years to find the right person…

I brought her on as an employee, then went on to build my small team…

The SPOUSE of my recent Q.A. hire passed along a heartfelt “THANK YOU” to the person who made the introduction that got him the perfect job for him…because SHE no longer had to deal with a stressed-out, misemployed husband...

And it hasn’t just been my own team…

When our software partner had an international team whose productivity was plummeting, I helped them rescue the team and build up both their morale AND the productivity...

I’ve helped individuals make dramatic shifts in their work role--sometimes in a few hours, other times in a matter of minutes…

I consistently watch their shoulders drop and face relax as I help them understand where they can make their greatest contribution to their team...

And for the first time, I’m opening up the doors to reveal HOW I DO THIS…

I’m launching a 5-day masterclass for kingdom-driven marketplace leaders starting NEXT WEEK on April 20 that takes you behind the curtain of how I make sure team members STRIVE and THRIVE…

We’ll meet daily at 9 AM MDT (that’s 11 AM EDT). If you can’t make it live, you will receive daily emails with access to the replays.

In these five 1-hour sessions, you’ll learn:

* the difference between traditional management and kingdom stewardship  
* the \#1 misunderstanding of management that undermines motivation  
* the 4 critical components of a star employee  
* how to move an employee into a new role and have them accelerate their success  
* why relying only on skills and experience can hurt you (and what to do instead)  
* how to help your team members find what they WANT, even if they don’t know...  
* the hidden reasons that “personality assessments” don’t work for many people  
* and more…

I’ll also WALK YOU THROUGH making personalized changes to your team that you can implement BEFORE YOU FINISH THE TRAINING.

I’m opening this up for only $27…with a few special surprises coming along the way...

You will NEVER get this level of support from me at this price again…

If you’re committed to seeing your team members thrive from a practical, proven kingdom perspective…

Or just want to stop dealing with the drama of a team member who’s not doing well…

Or want to fix the problem before they walk out the door and down the street...
