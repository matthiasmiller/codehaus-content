   3. Level 3 \- Full-Blown Movement  
2. The game you’re trying to play is, how do I give a dollar of advertising and get back more than a dollar?  
   1. Why? Understands movement-based marketing, with a powerful challenge framework  
   2. Solve the problems he knows they have  
   3. You need to learn how to follow. This is part of humility  
   4. It’s a lot of work to have your own product/service, because you have to sell yourself.  
   5. Let other people brag about you. Overwhelming social proof. That’s why you need to get those testimonials.  
   6. Where are your miracle stories?  
   7. “We are not in the convincing business.” Sales is not convincing. Sales is serving.  
   8. Selling is nothing more than helping someone make a decision to take a step in the direction of something they have already said they wanted to do/go.  
   9. Never try to get someone to do something they have not already said they want to do.  
   10. Selling?  
       1. What have you tried that did work?  
       2. What have you tried that did not work?  
   11. I don’t want to help anyone who has not first owned the problem.  
   12. The people have to value your solution more than the money in your pocket.  
   13. You must have them become very aware of the cost of the problem.
