5. Training \-- What is this costing you? / Foundational Principles  
   1. Have a notebook and pen  
   2. Manifesto  
      1. Write down what resonates… Highlights only  
      2. What are the places where you are out of alignment  
   3. Pre-work  
      1. Emotional cost  
      2. People locked down  
      3. Difficulty relating with other  
      4. Getting sabotaged in their places of strength  
   4. The VINE principle  
      1. The reason you prune the vine, is so that you can have focused growth  
      2. Every economic reset is a time of PRUNING \-- which means things that have NOT BORN FRUIT in the past, are being brought to light and being pruned  
      3. This allows more LIFE and ENERGY and GROWTH to flow into the things that are ready to come forth.  
   5. 80/20 principle of removing vs. adding  
      1. It is ALWAYS harder to ADD than it is to subtract  
      2. If you want to spend $1 in an administrative expense, how much money (time, effort, energy) do you have to raise to cover that? $10? But for the same or LESS effort, you can cut $10. OR, you can find a more effective way to spend that $10.  
      3. If you have a relationship that puts a big drain on your energy, is it easier to take an extra 2 hours for self-care, or to eliminate those 30-minute phone calls?  
   6. This is about STEWARDSHIP  
      1. It’s not that people don’t NEED help.  
      2. The question is...are you the PERSON FOR IT?  
      3. It’s not that people don’t NEED WORK..  
      4. The question is...are you the PERSON FOR IT?  
   7. When you have TWO priorities, one will be SIGNIFICANTLY better than the other, and the lesser will pull down the other to average  
   8. When you try to leverage OPPOSITE strengths, you’ll LOWER THEIR STRENGTH to mere average.  
   9. Lies  
      1. Why experiences and resumes lie  
      2. Can I go into people being bought and sold, at their harm? Kolbe stories of physical sickness/illness  
      3. It’s all about recognizing staff and thanking them, and letting them know that what they do is important (half-truth)  
   10. If you’re going to do effective hiring, you must cut through the BS  
       1. Stop BSing people about how great it is to work for you.  
       2. Stop letting people BS you about how great they are  
       3. You would never start any serious relationship with lies or pretenses, so don’t let it start here  
   11. Want to be part of a family...and WE ARE...but are they supposed to be part of THIS FAMILY?? It’s only when we LET GO that they can find their tribe and their family.  
   12. You are not only pruning people from your organization, you are also pruning YOURSELF from THEM. You are giving THEM the opportunity to cut off the dead branches in their life, so they can find new avenues of life.  
   13.   
   14. LIE \- climbing the ladder is a big lie  
       1. Peter Principle \-- promoted about their level of competence (exact idea?)  
       2. Won’t promote people who are not skilled at the ground level.  
       3. Two sides of coin \-- must start with humility and learn the organization, BUT some people are good at leading not doing  
       4. For example, we didnt; hire Ian as a project manager  
   15. Sometimes it’s EASIER for you and the other person to move on, because they don’t have the history of the mismatch/misfit, and they can move into their place of gifting without labels
