# **Building Your Supercharged Team**

Dear high-achieving, kingdom-driven manager,

Do you have a team member....on your team RIGHT NOW...who is skilled at their work, trying their best at their job…

...and yet they can’t seem to get it together?

Not bad enough to fire them (yet)…but not good enough to promote them, either… It’s slowing the rest of the team down...maybe even slowing YOU down...

Well, here’s the good news…

It really IS possible to have a team that is low-drama, hardworking, highly motivated, and has fun along the way…

Took a few bumps for me to learn…

I got into a career where I received encouragement and accolades, mixed with baffled confusion on why someone so GOOD at their job could be so UNFULFILLED…

That led me to start my own business. When I hired my first team member, I goofed big time…Great guy, wrong role, and I didn’t have room to move him elsewhere…

I took the time to apply the lessons I’d learned, and that’s when things began to change...

My second employee I hired as an independent contractor with a consulting project...my client raved about her after they’d struggled for years to find the right person…

I hired her as an employee, then went on to build my team…

I recently had the SPOUSE of one of my team members pass along a heartfelt “THANK YOU” to the person who made the introduction that got him the job…

And it hasn’t just been my own team...

I’ve helped others make dramatic shifts in their work role--sometimes in a few hours, other times in a matter of minutes…

I consistently watch people’s shoulders drop and face relax as I help them understand where they can make their greatest contribution to their team...

When our software partner had an international team whose productivity was plummeting, I helped them rescue the team and build up both their morale AND the productivity...

For the first time, I’m opening up the doors to show you HOW I DO THIS…

I’m launching a 5-day masterclass for kingdom-driven managers starting NEXT WEEK on April 20 that takes you behind the curtain of how I make sure team members STRIVE and THRIVE…

You’ll learn:

\* the \#1 misunderstanding of management that undermines motivation  
\* the 4 critical components of a rockstar employee  
\* how to move an employee into a new role and have them experience almost immediate success  
\* why relying on skills and experience will hurt you (and what to look at instead)  
\* how to help your team members find what they WANT, even if they don’t know...  
\* the hidden reason what keeps personality assessments from working for many people  
\* and more...

I’m opening this up for only $47…with a few special surprises coming along the way...

You will NEVER get this level of support from me at this price again…
