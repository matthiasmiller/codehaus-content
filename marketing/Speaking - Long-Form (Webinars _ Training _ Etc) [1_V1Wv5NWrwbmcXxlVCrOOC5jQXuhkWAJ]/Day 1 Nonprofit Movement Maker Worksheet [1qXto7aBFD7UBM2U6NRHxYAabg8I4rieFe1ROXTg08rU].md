## **Building Your Movement Manifesto**

List the things you are FOR and the things you are AGAINST. Then, organize and build your manifesto into a list of statements:  
We are for \_\_\_.  
We are against \_\_\_.

| FOR | AGAINST |
| ----- | ----- |
|                                        |                                         |

| PASSIONS | INTERESTS |
| ----- | ----- |
|    |  |
| **SHARED VALUES** | **SHARED PRINCIPLES** |
|    |  |

## **BONUS: What are the TERMS or PHRASES that you use within your movement?**

After the training, Pedro shared with me that we’ll dig deeper into this on Day 3 (Wednesday). However, I wanted to include this because I talked about it on the recap today. It’s an opportunity for you all to start thinking about it.
