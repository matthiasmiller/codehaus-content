**Chapter 7: The Fifth Meeting**  
***“If people get close and see what’s really going on, they won’t appreciate me anymore”***

CARS WHIZZED passed Jack as he made his way from the cafe on Lewis Street. He shoved his hands deeper into his pockets to escape the crisp morning air preluding autumn’s arrival. The cold energized Jack and he even whistled as he mulled over his recent conversations with his mentor.

He was beginning to see the value of the masterminds or “doing business in strong community,” as the old man put it. It bothered Jack how many misconceptions he had blindly believed about business, even after six years of doing it himself\!

Jack fiddled with the coins in his pocket, trying to keep his hands out of the breeze. The expense of joining a local mastermind didn’t bother him now. If the success of these men was due at all to the support and feedback of the group, he wanted it too, even if it cost him. 

His only hang-up was the sharing. No matter how much sense it made, the idea of sharing his deep struggles with peers didn’t seem any easier than before. Talking to his mentor, putting his family first--he was getting used to all of that. But sharing openly with other men his age seemed humiliating.

He stopped on the edge of the sidewalk and pushed the button to use the crosswalk.

“Hey Jack, good mornin’\!” a voice called from behind him. He recognized Charlie’s western twang immediately. “You meet with Cal this mornin’?” he said, strolling up beside Jack.

“Yeah I did,” Jack said. “I never realized how much experience he has. He’s learned a lot through you guys.”

“He sure is wise. How’s it going for ya?” Charlie asked.

“Good\!” Jack replied.

Charlie grinned down at the younger man, arms on his hips as if waiting expectantly for something more.

Jack returned Charlie’s gaze, flattening his lips and nodding his head, unsure how to handle the silence.

“Good?” Charlie repeated. “In what way?”

Jack fumbled for the words. “Well, like I said, I’ve learned a lot.” He felt the butterflies in his stomach begin their less-than-synchronized flying.”

Charlie kept grinning. “How are things going, really?”

Jack could feel his palms start to sweat. His heartbeat quickened. He felt his face turn red and hoped the rancher hadn’t seen the embarrassment wash over him.

The pressure increased in his chest, twisting his stomach into knots, until finally it all bubbled over and came tumbling out in a rush of words and sweat and red cheeks. Jack felt like a fifth grader spilling his silly secrets to the teacher.

He explained the emotions he had pent up inside him. How every Thursday morning he felt like a kid at the adult table.

He told Charlie how it was embarrassing simply to share his struggles even to a kind, trusted old mentor. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to share with his peers. 

“I’ve racked up substantial debt I’m *still* trying to pay off. I feel lost in leading my small team, even after six years\!” he vented. “I’m just a mechanic, Charlie. I’m totally out of place among men running companies in industries far more important and demanding than an auto-repair shop.” He sputtered the words, as if in disdain.

He stopped, realizing he had rambled for several minutes straight. He looked sheepishly at the older man. But Charlie didn’t laugh. He didn’t scold. He didn’t even look at his phone or fidget restlessly. He listened. He looked right into Jack’s eyes, nodding and smiling occasionally. Jack stood there uncomfortably folding and unfolding his arms.

“I guess I just feel like a naive schoolboy among them--you,” Jack concluded.

Taking his hat off and motioning for Jack to follow him, Charlie sat down on the curb. Jack felt a little conspicuous but followed the rancher’s lead and sat, suddenly cold. He noticed the crosswalk sign had turned red again.

Charlie stretched out his long legs into the street and smiled at Jack. “I love mornings like this,” he said, closing his eyes and letting the sun warm his face. Jack shivered. 

“You know what,” Charlie began, eyes still closed. “I felt the exact same way you do when I first started meetin’ with the group.” He shoved his thumb in the direction of the cafe behind them.

“Really?” Jack asked. “How so?”

“Well, imagine it. There I was, this rough-n-tumble, boots and hat wearing cowboy. And there they were, a successful multi-restaurant owner, a pilot, and, eventually, an educated teacher. Carl understands rough-n-tumble, being in the Air Force and all, but even he has been refined and educated into a professional pilot.” He spread his long arms out into a shrug. “What did I know about their businesses. And of all things, why would they care about my lowly ranch? But,” he said, “I found--and I’m sure you have, too--that they don’t give a damn if we fit their style or not.”

He paused, turning his hat around in his hands. “When I started sharing with the others about embarrassing obstacles or revenue losses on the ranch and saw them continue to respect me and not treat me less valuable to the group--I realized for the first time I possessed worth simply because I was a livin’, breathin’ human individual. Not because I was turning a large profit or because I was a dynamic leader--but simply because I lived and breathed.”

He absentmindedly shoved some gravel into the street with his leather boots.

“You know,” he said, “successful people are often the warmest and most welcoming people around. You know why I think that is?” He looked at Jack.

“Why?”

“Because almost all of them have been in our shoes. They are ‘failures’”--he lifted his fingers in quotes--“just like us. But they got back up, they pushed on, they sat at tables they didn’t belong at. Those crazy successful people are some of the most flawed, but it’s their flaws that helped them succeed. It’s okay not to be perfect and not have all the answers. Just learn from it and get back up again.”

Jack shifted his weight watching the crosswalk sign turn green for the third time.

“That makes sense,” he told the old rancher, letting out a long sighed.

“*Hhhuhh\!*” Charlie imitated Jack’s sigh. “What’s ‘*hhhuhh\!’* about?”

“Oh, I guess I still fear I’ll never be able to grow my business or make a profit.”

Charlie thought about it then said, “I worried about that, too. Which is why it was so good for me to be in this group and share my struggles. I talked constantly about my financial frustrations and how hard it was to turn a profit on a ranch. But eventually they helped me to let go of the need to generate results and focus on things that really mattered.”

Jack looked confused.

“Exactly\!” Charlie agreed. “I had the same reaction. But I discovered the more desperate I got to turn a profit, the more frustrated I and my guys were. Eventually, I learned to focus only on building healthy systems with my team, my finances, and my relationships. With healthy systems in place results come. Slowly, but eventually and with stability.

“It’s like this,” he said. “I don’t do much with crops, myself, but business is kind of like a farmer who plants a seed into the ground. He puts in place systems to plant, water, and tend the seed until harvest. Sometimes business is just a matter of plantin’ and waterin’ seeds, and waitin’ for them to grow. But that takes patience and a willin’ness to forgo short-term success for long-term sustainability and easy management.”

“So you did that on your ranch?” Jack asked. “You let go of the drive to turn a profit and instead set up systems?”

“Yeah, because you can work on systems and maintain them over the long haul--they’re sustainable. Whereas, when you’re just runnin’ around doing business by the seat of your pants tryin’ to make an immediate profit, you will eventually burn out your engine, as it were.”

“So, just like that you changed?” Jack asked.

“Well, it wasn’t on a dime. It was a slow process of learnin’ from the others and failin’--which proved to me they were right,” he said waving his arm in the direction of the cafe, again. “But learnin’ and failin’ wasn’t the worst of it. As I began to see the light, I had to do one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.”

“What was that?”

“I had to ask people close to me--these gentlemen and relatives--to lend me some money to get through the year--this was about six months after I joined them. The scariest part was I had no idea how I was goin’ to pay them back. I don’t recommend it as a business strategy, but it’s where I was at. It was hard asking for help”--he scrunched up his nose--“But you know what?”

“What?”

“When I expressed my need for help,” he said, “I got tremendous support from everyone. They rallied right around me and helped me through. That’s the power of doing business within strong community.”  
   
“‘Business within strong community,’” Jack repeated. “Cal says that. A lot.”

“You said you were embarrassed to share your struggles, just now,” the rancher asked.

“Yeah, kind of,” Jack said.

“Did I make you feel stupid?”

Jack shook his head.

“Did I walk away from you?”

“No. You were very encouraging, why?”

“As you were talking and unloading everything you had kept inside for so long, did you feel better?”

“Yeah, I guess,” Jack shrugged.

“I bet,” the rancher said holding up a finger, “you even begin to see solutions for some of your problems just through talking about it, am I right.”

“Well,” Jack stammered, “I mean, I thought about stuff, but I don’t know if they’re solutions.”

“That’s what can happen when you and others share and brainstorm together\!” Charlie smiled at the younger man. “Jack, you know good men. I know you do because you are a good man and good men attract good friends. Go, find them and start sharin’. Start, as Carl says, ‘a lifestyle of contribution.’ Start a mastermind, Jack.”

The younger man mumbled a reply, trying to think it through.

“Well, the day’s leavin’ us behind\!” Charlie declared as he stood up, “You should go, too.” He pointed at the pedestrian sign. “‘Cause the light’s green now.”

CHARLIE LEFT Jack alone to his thoughts and shivers.

The mechanic was thinking of all the businessmen and leaders he knew he could invite to a mastermind. It still felt weird to him. He imagined how the conversation would go.

*“Hey, you wanna get together and talk about our problems,”* Jack would ask.

The friend would probably wrinkle his nose and shake his head, *“I’m sorry, Jack, I have important things to do.”*

Jack blushed just thinking about it.

He slowly rose from the curb and watched Charlie stroll away humming to himself. Jack tried to imagine what the rancher must have been like in his younger years. 

*“Probably wore the same outfit of jean clothes.”* He chuckled to himself. 

The light turned green again and Jack crossed the street, climbed into his truck, and went to work.

JACK HAD begun to view his shop from a new perspective. He no longer felt the intense pressure to make something of himself. Yet he also took comfort in knowing success was possible.

Stepping inside the dusty office, he paused. He looked at the piles of bills, flyers, and *Popular Mechanics* magazines strewn across the desk over his laptop.

A thought occurred to him. Leaning out the office door, Jack shouted to the young men in the shop.

“Hey, Gabriel\!” he called, “Come here for a sec’\!”

The 18-year-old looked at his co-workers nervously before jogging toward the office.

“Yeah, boss?” he said.

“Do you enjoy working here, Gabe?”

“Yes sir, I appreciate the job\!” he said, a little too enthusiastically to be genuine.

“You like changing oil and grabbing tools and parts for me and Pete?”

“Happy to help wherever I can, sir,” the young man assured.

“But aren’t you good with computers? Wouldn’t you rather be somewhere else messing around with computers and software and what-not?” Jack asked.

“I mean, I suppose so. But I didn’t get a job like that. You hired me and I’m glad to be working.”

“Would you enjoy doing the computer work for the shop?” Jack asked the teenager.

Gabe thought for a second, “I’ve never really considered it. I suppose I could enjoy it.”

“You’d enjoy it more than working on the cars, wouldn't you?” Jack asked, perceiving restraint in the answer.

“Actually, to be honest, sir, yes I would,” the young man admitted.

“It’s all yours then,” Jack said. “If you want it, I’ll give you responsibility over all the computer work: records, scheduling, billing--all of that.’” 

Gabe put his hand over his chin, as if considering the negotiation.

“I’ll bump your pay up to be worth it. If you agree, all of this,” he spread his hands out to the office. “Will be your domain.”

“All of it?” Gabe exclaimed.

“Yup\! I’ll move my stuff over there,” Jack said motioning to the desk in the corner, nearly hidden by all the boxes, papers, and parts covering it. “And you can do whatever you need to be comfortable with this desk.”

He thought a little more, eyeing the rest of the office.

“Perhaps I’ll bring my wife in and get her to help shine this place up to be a little more pleasant and welcoming. Otherwise, it’s under your charge. Are you cool with this? Do you want to give it a try for a while?”

“Yes, sir--I mean no sir--I mean, I want to do it.”

“Good\! You ready to start?”

“Yes, sir\!”

“Okay, I’ll go over everything with you as soon as I clear away this junk.”

Jack started looking through all the stuff on his desk. He stacked the magazines together and tossed them into the trash. Setting all the bills and business paperwork right next to the computer, he began sorting through the loose-leaf papers. A little flyer caught his attention:

*“Share, learn, and grow with people like you\!”* it read. *“Join us at our weekly business mastermind\!”*

JACK COULDN’T believe what he was doing. Upon finding the mastermind invitation (which he would’ve normally thrown away), he called the number and asked to visit the next Saturday.

Now, he sat around a restaurant table with five other businessmen, four of whom he had never met before and one who was none other than Mr. Robertson, the roofer. Jack laughed at himself as he remembered the half-hearted conversation he had with the roofer at the church banquet. His perspective had changed dramatically since then.

They were going around the table sharing about themselves so Jack could get to know them better. It all reminded him of the group of retired men who met every Thursday morning  in the cafe on Lewis Street. Only these guys were his own age.

Each one talked about their businesses, why they had started, what they had gone through and overcome, and what they hoped would happen in the future.

Then it was Jack’s turn. His heart beat a little faster. Adrenaline surged through his body. 

“I--it--it,” he stuttered and blushed, but he pushed through. “To be honest, it freaks me out to share about my problems with you.” 

There. He had it out. The men chuckled.

“Believe me, we’ve all been there bro,” the leader, a guy named Kyle Hendrix, assured Jack. “Just say whatever you’re comfortable sharing.”

Jack continued, explaining some of his backstory and the current state of his business. The more he shared, the easier it got. He even told them some of the humiliating details, like his debt and how long it had taken him to realize his wife should be a top priority over his business.

“It’s hard--and embarrassing--for me to share this. In fact, it has taken me a long time to even see the value of a group like this,” he told the men.

Their continual nodding and expressions of agreement relieved Jack. They seemed to understand what he was talking about.

Charlie had been right. It felt good to share with people who understood and still respected him. Plus, they had good insight into some of his problems, even though none of them were mechanics.

Jack knew he would be joining them the next week and every week. These guys were real men. Successful, strong, brilliant. Yet they spoke freely about their weaknesses. They even asked him--the new guy--for input, which he shared humbly. Being able to contribute to other people’s success boosted his own confidence and motivation to work hard towards success himself.

Jack sat back and smiled. His old friend would be delighted: he had found his “strong community.”
