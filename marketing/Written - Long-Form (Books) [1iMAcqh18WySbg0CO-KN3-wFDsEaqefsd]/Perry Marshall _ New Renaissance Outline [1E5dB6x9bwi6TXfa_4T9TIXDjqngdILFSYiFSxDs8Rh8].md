## **INTRODUCTION (10 minutes)**

### **1:10 \- 1:14 – Your Unique Journey (4 minutes)**

* **My Promise**  
  * Perry or Cuyler, feel free to interrupt, jump in, ask questions…  
  *   
* **Opening Story**: My unconventional path to business alignment  
  * "Good to be with you\! The one thing my bio didn't mention..."  
  * From Amish kid writing enterprise software for major banks and insurance companies  
  * To developing specialized software for 8 and 9-figure Amish businesses without internet  
  * Lessons from Unbending Systems & Uncontrollable Forces  
  * To my current focus: breaking free from the hamster wheel to build a business that can operate without me  
  * For years, I've tried to capture the essence of what I do and how I think about business...

### **1:14 \- 1:17 – The War Within & Without (3 minutes)**

* **The Cost of Division**: Why most businesses operate at only 50-70% of their potential  
  * The hidden wars happening inside successful businesses  
  * The gravity of competition vs. the friction of fragmentation  
  * **Real-world Impact**: The software project where I netted a 200% loss  
  * Built custom tools prior to the position being filled & defined  
  * Misalignment (I am NOT a teacher/mentor/manager...and that's the role I stepped into)  
  * Overly complicated solution to an undefined problem  
  * **Key Insight**: "I would have been better off taking a 4-month vacation"

### **1:17 \- 1:20 – The Foundation for Change (3 minutes)**

* **UNION As a Foundational Principle**  
  * **Engagement Question**: "Where in your business do you see the most conflict or friction?" (10-second reflection)  
  * Militarization creates division while union creates strength  
  * Love as the foundation for business alignment  
  * The simplicity of love: 'knowing and being known'  
  * Being Known \= self-disclosure  
  * Knowing \= listening with curiosity, not judgment (and implicitly the need to self-correct)  
  * **The Frictionless Promise**: What's possible when internal wars end
