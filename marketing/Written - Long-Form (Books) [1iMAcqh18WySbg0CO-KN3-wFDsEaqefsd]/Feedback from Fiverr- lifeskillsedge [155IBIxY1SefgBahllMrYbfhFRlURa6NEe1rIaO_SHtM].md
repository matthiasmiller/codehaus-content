**Feedback for the book “Winning Together”**  
by Matthias Miller and Christopher Witmer  
   
   
è **What I liked:**  
   
·         The title of the book  
·         Ideal length of the chapters, it was easily to digest  
·         Good overview of each chapter (looks well-structured on page 5\)    
·         Chapter 2 to 8 (I started really getting more hooked on the book after reading chapter 2\. It it would be difficult to tell what my favourite chapter would be since they all have some important messages and have a unique story to tell).  
·         The “touching” ending (chapter 8\)  
·         Featuring the achieved results and progress made after 3 years  
·         It made me aware of some of my own mistakes. And it also inspired me to set up a like-minded community like the ones described in the boo, too (thanks\!\!\!) – Thus, definitely an inspiring book, real-life related which I’m sure many other readers/entrepreneurs will be able to relate easily too\!  
   
   
è **What I didn’t like:**  
   
·         Found chapter 1 it a bit lengthy and not as attention-grabbing as all the other chapters. Some details I would consider as irrelevant. Maybe because I personally prefer getting to the point soon.  
·         Mistakes: I hardly come across a book which has no mistakes in it at all, be it typos, grammar or anything else. And famous publishing houses are NO exception. This is what I found in your book, you might consider making the changes: (if I’m wrong please apologize).  
\-          Contents list: Chapter 3: “Personal development take**s** too much time”  
\-          Chapter 4, page 35: “You can you relate, can’t ya?” he stated.  
\-          Chapter 6, page 53: When he came back, what do you know **but** the colt still wasn’t trained (not sure about the word ‘BUT’ in this sentence,).  
\-          Epilogue, page 70: When I started my journey, I had no idea **about** the vast number of well-intentioned but deeply misinformed coaches and trainers in the business arena.  
\-          Chapter 2, page 15: It was all Jack could **to** do not to give in to the thoughts screaming in his head.  
   
è **What would I do differently?**  
   
·         I would include a list of characters at the beginning before the story starts, so that the reader gets already familiar with the main characters (Jack, wife, son, his employees, his mentor, other community/group members etc.) I would show a drawing of each person, with their name and short description in which you explain who is who, e.g. the wife of the car shop owner, Cal \- the mentor, etc.) Once you read about them in the book you can instantly understand who they are. I was a bit confused when once the teacher was referred to as “Mr Young” and then “Trev”. Either you mention both names or just call him Trev, or just Mr Young. I feel it would make it easier and quicker to understand that you are talking about the same person. Another example: When the book talked about Riley, it was not instantly understandable for me that she was Jacks’ wife.  
   
For example:  
   
Jack Martin, ……..  
…….  
…….  
   
   
   
   
   
Riley Martin, ….  
…..  
…..  
   
   
   
   
   
Cal, the mentor ……  
……  
……….  
   
   
   
   
other people…..  
   
·         I would add a short introduction before the story begins. You wrote a very good epilogue at the end, something similar could be included as an introduction.  
   
   
·         I would reduce a bit the use of descriptive language. If it would be a novel, it would be perfectly fine, but as a business book (even though a parable) I found it a bit distracting because I started paying attention on how vividly you described certain things, and focused less on the core message/lesson from each story. I found therefore myself re-reading certain parts to make sure I understand everything correctly. For me it was a bit difficult to adjust to this descriptive language style which I’m not used to. It does not mean that it’s bad, just different from what I usually read. However, other readers’ perception might be different.  
   
·         **I would write/highlight certain important parts in bold**, e.g. memorable sentences, the lessons to be learnt, the acquired benefits.  
   
Some examples:  
   
***‘And you must take care of your allies: your wife and those closest to you. They’re your lifesavers. If you create an incredible business but destroy your family by your crazy hours and lifestyle, you haven’t succeeded at anything.’ (Chapter 4\)***  
   
**“Slow down, work fewer hours, maximize whatever makes you most productive…”**  
   
Remember, Jack, **just because your perspective is different doesn’t mean you’re right nor does it mean you’re wrong. It just means you're different. So, don’t hesitate to share your perspective, it will be very helpful. But also, never assume you know the right or wrong answer.** (Chapter 8\)  
   
**Being able to contribute to other people’s success boosted his own confidence and motivation to work hard towards success himself.**  
   
“So, ‘**Do what only you can do**,’ again,” Jack summarized, “and ‘**empower ownership.**’” (Chapter 6\)  
and many more….  
   
OR  
   
summarizing 2-3 key points from each chapter, by saying:  
The main takeaways from this chapter are:  
·         …….  
·         …….  
·         ……..  
   
   
è **What I don’t know…..**  
   
·         Occasionally 2 words at the beginning of a sentence were written in capital letters, I wonder whether there was a specific reason for that?  
·         As mentioned at the beginning the book was written by two book authors, but in the epilogue mentions just your name.  
·         I consider also the cover of a book as important. If you have already created that too, I would be happy to give you feedback on that as well (for free). By the way, you might consider creating it by yourself by using Canva.com. I did that for my own ebooks too 😊  
   
Hope my feedback is helpful. I really like it and would surely recommend it.  
   
All the best,
