**Prelude**  
***Into the Woods***

“WHEN IS Daddy gonna be home, Momma?” the little boy asked.  
His mother winced and closed the book she had been reading. She had thought long and hard about this moment, but still found herself stumbling over what to say. Her pulse quickened and her stomach churned. She wished she could ignore the question. She didn’t want to face the reality she knew or the questions she couldn’t answer.  
She knew one thing, she wouldn’t lie to him.  
“I don’t know, Jack. I don’t know if he’ll ever come back.”  
“But Mr. Barkley will find him, won’t he?”  
“Captain Barkley and all his officers have done everything they can, dear.” A tear began streaming down her face and she pulled her six-year-old close. “All we can do is pray he’ll come back.”  
She held the boy tightly for a few minutes before going into the kitchen to begin making supper.  
“Why don’t you go out and play with Muffin until dinner’s ready? Just stay away from the road.”  
Jack grabbed his raincoat and boots and went out onto the porch where his Irish-red cocker-spaniel eagerly waited for him. He looked into the garage, wishing he could watch his dad tinker with cars one more time like he always did after work. Jack didn’t understand what he felt in his chest and stomach, but he didn’t like it.  
He made his way down the muddy driveway, hopping in and out of the puddles. He was getting soaked from head to foot. He came to the end of the driveway and gazed longingly at the muddy field across the street. The rain from earlier in the morning had turned the field into a gigantic muddy slip-and-slide. He looked at Muffin and motioned toward the street.  
“We can’t go over there. Momma won’t let us.” He sat on the muddy gravel the dog nuzzled up to him, as if to comfort him. Suddenly, he perked up. “We could go play in the woods,” he said to the dog. “Yeah\! Let’s go into the woods and build a fort\!” he repeated, getting excited.  
Sensing his excitement the dog stood up and barked in agreement.  
“Come-on girl\!” He shouted and ran off to the woods.  
Jack never saw his mother again.

**Chapter 1:**  
***The Burning of London***

TWENTY-SIX YEARS LATER

*THE THOUGHTS plagued him all day long like he was 17th century London invaded by the Black Death. They exhausted him. He went to sleep tired and he woke up tired. He couldn’t escape them. They were killing him and there was no cure.*  
*It wouldn’t take long though; there wasn’t much left of him to kill.*

\~\~\~

JACK MARTIN’s Tacoma sputtered its way into the auto-shop parking lot. He shoved the gear into park causing the truck to grumble and die. He moaned at the sound. It was already six o’clock in the morning, later than he had hoped. He cursed the dead battery and hurried to the door, fumbling with the wad of keys at his side. He jammed one into the office knob. Wrong key. He found the right one, twisted it, and burst into the office, dust flying through the morning rays of the sun.  
He plopped down at his desk and started leafing through the files before him, already compiling a to-do list in his mind.  
Mrs. Taylor’s Jetta needed a new catalytic converter; Rod Wilson needed an oil change and couldn’t find access to the battery on his Corolla. Easy fix, those late 80s Corolla batteries are only accessible from the bottom.  
Then there was all the paperwork and bills and follow-up calls on top of that…  
“Don’t forget about Jimmy’s first tee-ball game tomorrow afternoon,” his wife had reminded him the night before. “And do you think you’ll be home in time to go with me to the church banquet in the evening?”  
“I don’t know yet. We’ll see,” he had murmured before shutting off the lights.  
Jack found himself staring numbly at a paper before him: It was an invitation to a “business mastermind” taking place on the following Saturday. “Share, learn, and grow with people like you\!” it read. He set it aside, knowing it would eventually make its way into the trash.  
Payroll, rent, an order for supplies, and the four voicemails left on his cell during off hours.  
Jack took a deep breath, tightened his lips, and dove in.

MOMENTS LATER, Pete, Jack’s right-hand man, stuck his head through the office door.  
“Hey boss, you got a moment?” the man asked, sitting down across the desk from Jack.  
“Yeah, Pete,” Jack said, looking up from his laptop, trying not to feel irritated at the interruption. “What’s up?”  
“Well,” Pete began, shifting in his seat, “it’s about time off—not that I’m asking for extra time off, necessarily, it’s just…” he stuttered. Jack leaned back, trying to set his employee at ease. He figured it was the “approachable boss” thing to do.  
“Well, my brother’s getting married next month, and I was wondering if I could use some vacation time to take a week off for it.”  
Jack brought his arms up behind his head, confusing the dust still floating lazily through the morning light. He thought about how to respond.  
Pete was a hardworking man, the best mechanic Jack had ever employed. They had worked together for years, and he had proven himself a diligent and hardworking employee. Surely he deserved some paid time off.  
But there was so much to do. It would mean extra work for both of them leading up to Pete’s time off and less production while he was away.  
The business was getting by, but could they really afford even a week’s loss in revenue?  
“I don’t know, Pete,” the boss finally said, trying to sound optimistic. “That’s a long time for you to be away. We are barely keeping up as it is so, without you, we’d have to cut back. I just don’t know if we can afford to do that right now.”  
Pete watched a roach scurry under the metal desk. He furrowed his brow, thinking.  
“How about Nate? He’s could step up for me while I’m gone,” the younger mechanic suggested.  
“Nate doesn’t have near the experience you do. I’d end up spending all my time in the garage helping him rather than taking care of all the paperwork, follow-ups, and whatnot.” Jack picked up the papers and plopped them back down to drive home his point.  
“You’ve got to understand, Pete”—Jack searched for eye contact—“I wish I could let you go for a week, but I just can’t.”  
Pete met his boss’s eyes.  
“I understand,” he conceded and began to get up.  
“I tell you what,” Jack inserted as Pete rose to his feet. “I’ll let you have a long weekend over the wedding. Send me the date and I’ll write it into the calendar. But unfortunately, I can’t give you a whole week’s vacation.”  
“Thank you, sir.” Pete nodded and turned to go.  
“You’re my man, Pete\!”   
The door swung shut.

	JACK WATCHED as his man walked back toward the garage.  
“What a way to start the day,” he mumbled as he wiggled his mouse to wake his computer. “Poor guy.” He instinctively reached up to feel the gash on his forehead.  
Jack had started his career in fixing cars under his first boss, old Joe.  
Joe was a friendly guy and great to work under. Jack could take time off whenever he needed. Customers were loyal because Joe gave them magnificent discounts. He even accepted IOUs when someone couldn’t pay. They loved him and so did Jack. But the man never made much money. He was barely able to pay his only employee.   
*It’s a mercy the man never had a family,* Jack always thought to himself.  
The business went under nearly two years after Jack had started working there.   
It was a mess. Debts, late payments, and a host of customers’ IOUs Joe didn’t have the heart to collect.  
Shaking the dust off his feet, Jack headed to college.  When the time came for him to start his own business, he would do it right. He would be successful, profitable, and helpful—not only to his customers, but his employees as well. Beginning with no IOUs.  
Getting a mechanic shop up and profitable wasn’t easy, but without good cash flow he would have nothing—no growth, no money to properly pay employees, certainly no generosity or charity. Money was everything.  
Jack knew making a profit required hard work, diligence, financial dexterity, and lots of grit.   
*Without a profit in the end you have nothing.* was the hard truth Jack lived by and built his business on.  
And build his business he did, with three employees, a well-equipped garage, and a decent pay check not only coming to himself but to each of his employees—and all this in under 10 years. The business was getting by.   
Yet, something gnawed at Jack. The business was getting by, but it wasn’t successful. It wasn’t growing as he wanted it to. 

“There’s no such thing as a plateau.” He had learned in college. “If your business isn’t going up, it’s going down. If you're not winning, you're losing. If you’re not growing, you’re shrinking.”  
No matter how hard he worked, Jack’s auto repair shop wasn’t growing.

THE CLOCK read a quarter past eleven. Turning away from his computer, Jack stretched, stood, and took the trash out to the dumpster. He noticed Wilson’s Corolla sitting by the garage.   
Grabbing the keys, he hopped inside the well-kept classic and pulled it into the open space.  
“Needed a break,” Jack replied to Pete’s questioning look.  
With an oil carton in one hand and a pan in the other, he got to work.  
*If you’re not winning, you're losing, Jack.* The thought nagged him every day. *Success equals profit and profit is hard work. You gotta work harder, Jack, or you’ll end up like Old Joe.*  
He shook his head, but the thoughts remained, helping themselves to his mind and emotions at will. Jack pursed his lips again, frustration rising.  
“I’ll keep working harder,” he mumbled to himself. “I’ll make money. I’ll make money and make Riley and the kids happy. Pete and Nate and Gabriel will be happy, too. I may be tough, but they’ll love me in the end.”

\~\~\~

*THE THOUGHTS plagued him. All day long they plagued him like the Black Death in 17th century London. Nothing he tried sterilized the despair spreading through the streets of his soul.*   
*This frustrated him and added to his torment, friction and pressure. Slowly, the heat rose and the pressure intensified until it ignited. Not only was he plagued by incessant thoughts, but he was hot with anger. For all his determination and grit, Jack Martin was burning out.*   
*London was on fire.*

\~\~\~

JACK STARED at his Keurig coffee sludge, swirling it slowly. His stomach twisted into knots. His heart pounded as he spoke.   
“I want to help people, I think,” he said. He raised his head to look at the old man sitting across his office desk from him. He wasn’t used to sharing his feelings with others, but neither did he like feeling confused. But he needed to talk to someone.  
“I don’t think that was my motive when I first started. Then all I wanted was not to be a failure like Joe; to run a successful business, raise a happy family, and make some money. Okay, a lot of money but…” He paused and looked down at his coffee again.   
His eyebrows furrowed as he pursed his lips and continued, “I think, now, I want a legacy that lasts longer than the date on my tombstone.”  
“Mmm.” The old man nodded. “Harder than you thought, huh?” he asked in his growling bass voice.  
“Don’t get me wrong, the business isn’t hurting—though it’s certainly not growing nor is my pay check,” he explained. “My family has nothing to complain about; we have a nice house and car, even a swimming pool in the back. My wife doesn’t have to work if she doesn’t want to. She hangs out with her girlfriends all she wants and pursues whatever she feels like pursuing...”  
He trailed off.  
“But something's bothering ya deeper,” the old man growled. “What is it, Jack?”  
“Well, it’s… I think…” Jack hesitated as his cheeks glowed red with embarrassment. “It seems as though nothing is enough. I slave away at work day and night. I give my family the basic things they want. I make a decent amount of money—but it’s still not enough\!” He sat straighter, clenching his jaw.  “And…”  
“And what?”  
“You wouldn’t understand. I’m not sure *I* even understand. Nobody understands.”  
“C’mon, Jack. I know what it’s like. You gotta let it out.”  
“How could you know? You’ve never led a business.”  
“But I have been a leader,” the old man replied softly, his bass voice still growling. “And I’ve known businessmen all my life. I understand more than you think. And I know you will only be torn apart until you let out what’s all stuck up in here.” He leaned over the desk and poked the younger man in the chest.  
Jack rubbed his sternum as if the poke hurt.   
He looked at the old man who was waving for more coffee. Jack saw in his face—tan from years of hard work in the sun—that same old fiery passion that originally drew Jack to the man.  
Jack didn’t really do mentors, his ego never let him. But this old man had been there for him when no one else had been. This was the man Jack always came to with questions and the old guy always showed up, usually just to listen, sometimes to give answers. Jack could not have gotten off first base in manhood without the old man’s support—let alone wooed a woman, raised a family, or led a business.  
Maybe Jack did do mentors.  
“What are you feeling? Can you describe it?” the mentor asked.  
“Yeah, I suppose I could, but I don’t know why it matters,” Jack replied.  
“It matters a great deal,” the old man explained. “Do you pay attention to the dash lights on your truck?”  
“Of course I do.”  
“Your *feelings* are the dash lights of your heart and soul. Sometimes they are simply out of whack or even wrong, but most of the time they give warning to a deeper problem. You’d do very well to pay attention to your feelings, son.”  
“I guess I feel… I feel like I don’t know what to do. Like my engine’s roaring but my wheels are spinning and flinging dirt everywhere,” Jack explained.  
The old man set his coffee on the desk and brought his hands together up to his face, thinking.  
“You know, Jack, you nee—” he began to speak but paused abruptly. “Well, let me just show you. Meet me at the cafe on Lewis next Friday—I guess that’s tomorrow morning, isn’t it? Be there tomorrow morning at six.”  
“What will I see? Is it worth my time?”  
“Just come and watch, Jack. And take care of that gash on your forehead. Looks awful.”  
With that, the old man took one last swig of coffee, grabbed his hat, and left.  
Jack exhaled slowly, staring blankly at his coffee again, wondering what the old guy was planning to show him.  
“I hope it helps.”   
Noticing the time, Jack decided to let Pete close up shop. He jumped back into his Tacoma and turned the key. Nothing happened. A light on his dash caught his attention.   
It flashed, “*Check Engine.*”

TWENTY-ONE MINUTES after five, Jack finally pulled into his driveway. His kids were chasing each other, giggling and laughing, around the front lawn.  
He pushed his remote to lift the garage door as his truck passed through the driveway, passed the garden, passed the playing kids. Shutting the garage door, Jack wiped his brow, relieved by the shade of the house, and entered the kitchen through the garage.   
To Jack’s surprise, the kitchen contained neither wife nor supper. He searched his memory for an explanation as he walked into the living room. He found her sitting with her back towards him, oblivious to his entrance and clearly not cooking.  
Riley Martin tapped away at her computer, earbuds in, eyes down. Jack waited, annoyed by the disconnection his expectations and reality.  
Apparently still not noticing his presence or ignoring it, she continued working. So he did as well, resuming his routine as normal: perhaps an explanation would come to him.  
When he walked out of the shower, thirty minutes later, Riley stood primping herself in front of the mirror.  
“We commemorating the hungry tonight?” Jack asked sarcastically, looking at her through the mirror.  
Riley furrowed her brow back at him, anger flickering in her eyes.  
“Don’t you remember?” she murmured.  
“Was I supposed to remember something?”  
“Several things.”  
Jack pursed his lips. Work was frustrating enough. Why did he have to deal with this at home?  
“The banquet tonight?” she reminded him.  
Jack, groaned inwardly at himself. He had completely forgotten about the church.  
He bit his tongue, hard. Everything within him wanted to defend himself, but he was caught and he knew it.  
With all his might, he attempted to right his wrong, “I’m sorry. I forgot all about it. What time does it start?”  
“Six thirty.”  
“Okay, we’ve still got time. We’ll be late, but we can be ready in forty-five minutes, can’t we?”  
“I can.”   
Riley’s face remained unchanged in the mirror as she worked away at her hair.  
“Perhaps you should apologize to your son, too,” she mumbled.  
Jack glared at her, more than annoyed now at her lack of response to his apology while also feeling incredible shame. He had also forgotten Jimmy’s tee-ball game—the first tee-ball game of his son’s life.  
The plaguing thoughts, lingering in the shadows of his mind, pounced immediately.   
*You failure\! They’re unhappy. She’s unhappy. What can you do now? Nothing.*  
But other thoughts poured in as well: justification, anger, resentment, defense. *“She doesn’t understand. Work is busy. I’m a good husband and father. She is simply ungrateful.”*  
“Look, I’m sorry I forgot. Let’s just go to the banquet and talk about this later.”  
“That’s okay. You're busy, I know. You don’t have to come to the banquet.”  
Jack tried hard to restrain himself. It was bad enough to have failed twice in one day, now she was making it sound as though he didn’t care about what she cared about.  
“No\!” he said emphatically. “I *want* to go to the banquet. We’ll leave as soon as I’m ready.”  
With those words, he walked away, desperately trying to shove the anger deeper. But the despair only rose higher and consumed his thoughts.  
*So much for working harder, Jack Martin. You can’t keep up. You’re certainly not helping.*

\~\~\~

*LONDON’S FIRE raged hotter.*
