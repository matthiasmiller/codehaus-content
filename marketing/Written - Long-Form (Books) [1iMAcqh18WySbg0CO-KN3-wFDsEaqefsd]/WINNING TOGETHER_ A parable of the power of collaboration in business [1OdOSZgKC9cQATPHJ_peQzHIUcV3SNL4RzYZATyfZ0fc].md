**Chapter 1**  
***The Burning of London***

THE THOUGHTS plagued him.

All day long they plagued him like he was 17th century London. And they exhausted him, too. Tired he went to sleep and tired he woke up. He couldn’t escape them--the thoughts. They were killing him and there was no cure.

It wouldn’t take long, though: there wasn’t much left of him to kill.

JACK MARTIN’s Tacoma sputtered its way into the auto-shop parking lot. He shoved the gear into park causing the truck grumble and die. He moaned at the sound. It was already six o’clock in the morning--later than he wanted. This mechanic didn’t have time for dead batteries, certainly not in his personal vehicle. 

He hurried to the door, fumbling with the wad of keys at his side. He jammed one into the office knob. Wrong key. He found the right one, twisted and burst into the office, dust flying through the morning rays of the sun.

He plopped down at his desk and started leafing through the files before him, already compiling a to-do list in his mind.

Mrs. Taylor’s Jetta needed a new catalytic converter; Rod Wilson needed an oil change and couldn’t find access to the battery on his Corolla. Easy fix, those late 80’s Corolla batteries are only accessible from the bottom.

Then there was all the paperwork and bills and follow-up calls on top of that….

*“Don’t forget about Jimmy’s first t-ball game tomorrow afternoon,” his wife had reminded him the night before. “And do you think you’ll be home in time to go with me to the church banquet in the evening?”*

*“I don’t know yet. We’ll see,” He murmured before shutting off the lights.*

Jack found himself staring numbly at a paper before him: It was an invitation to a “business mastermind” taking place on the following Saturday. *“Share, learn, and grow with people like you\!”* it read. He set it aside, knowing it would eventually make its way into the trash.

Payroll, rent, an order for supplies, and the four voicemails left on his cell during off hours.

Jack took a deep breath, tightened his lips, and dove in.

MOMENTS LATER, Pete, Jack’s right-hand man, stuck his head through the office door.

“Hey boss, you got a moment?” the man asked sitting down across the desk from Jack.

“Yeah, Pete,” Jack said, looking up from his laptop, trying not to feel irritated at the interruption. “What’s up?”

“Well,” Pete started, shifting in his seat. “It’s about time off--not that I’m asking for extra time off, necessarily, it’s just--” he stuttered. Jack leaned back, trying to set his employee at ease. He figured it was the “approachable boss” thing to do.

“Well, my brother’s getting married next month, and I was wondering if I could use some vacation time to take a week off for it.”

Jack brought his arms up behind his head, confusing the dust still floating lazily through the morning light. He thought about how to respond.

Pete was a hardworking man. The best mechanic Jack had ever employed. They had worked together for years, and he had proven himself a diligent and hardworking employee. Surely he deserved some paid time off.

But there was so much to do. It would mean extra work for both of them leading up to Pete’s time off and less production while he was away.

The business was getting by, but could they really afford even a week’s loss in revenue?

“I don’t know, Pete,” the boss finally said, trying to sound optimistic. “That’s a long time for you to be away. We are barely keeping up as it is, so without you, we’d have to cut back. I just don’t know if we can afford it at this time.”

Pete watched a roach scurry under the metal desk. He furrowed his brow, thinking.

“How about Nate? He’s up-and-comin’ and could step up for me while I’m gone,” the younger mechanic suggested.

“Nate doesn’t have near the experience you do. I’d end up spending all my time in the garage helping him rather than taking care of all the paperwork, follow-ups, and whatnot.” Jack picked up the papers and plopped them back down to drive home his point.

“You’ve got to understand, Pete,” Jack searched for eye contact, “I wish I could let you go for a week, but I just can’t.”

Pete met his boss’s eyes.

“I understand,” he conceded and began to get up.

“I tell you what,” Jack inserted as the man rose to his feet. “I’ll let you have a long weekend over the wedding. Send me the date and I’ll write it into the calendar. Unfortunately, I can’t give you a week’s vacation.”

“Thank you sir,” Pete nodded and turned to go.

“You’re my man, Pete\!” 

The door swung shut.

JACK WATCHED as his man walked back toward the garage.

“What a way to start the day,” he mumbled as he wiggled his mouse to wake his computer. “Poor guy.”

Jack had started his career of fixing cars under his first boss, old Joe.

Joe was a friendly guy and great to work under. Jack could take time-off whenever he needed to. Customers were loyal because Joe gave them magnificent discounts. He even accepted IOUs when someone couldn’t pay. They loved him and so did Jack. But the man never made much money. He was barely able to pay his only employee. 

“It’s a mercy the man never had a family,” Jack always thought to himself.

The business went under nearly two years after Jack had started working there. 

It was a mess. Debts, late payments, and a host of customers’ IOUs Joe didn’t have the heart to collect.

Shaking the dust off his feet, Jack headed to college.  When the time came for him to start his own business, he would do it right. He would be successful, profitable, and helpful--not only to his customers, but his employees as well. Beginning with no IOUs.

Getting a mechanic shop up and profitable wasn’t easy, but without a good cash flow, he would have nothing. No growth, no money to properly pay employees, certainly no generosity or charity. Money was everything.

Jack knew making a profit required hard work, diligence, financial dexterity, and lots of grit. 

*In the end, without a profit you had nothing.*

It was hard, but it was truth Jack lived by and built his business on.

And build his business he did. With three employees, a well-equipped garage, and a decent paycheck not only coming to himself but to each of his employees--and this all under 10 years. The business was getting by. 

Yet, something gnawed at Jack. The business was getting by, but it wasn’t successful. It wasn’t growing like he wanted it to. 

*“There’s no such thing as a plateau.”* He had learned in college. *“If your business isn’t going up, it’s going down. If you're not winning, you're losing. If you’re not growing, you’re shrinking.”*

Jack’s auto repair shop wasn’t growing.

THE CLOCK read a quarter past eleven. Turning away from his computer, Jack stretched, stood, and took the trash out to the dumpster. He noticed Wilson’s Corolla sitting by the garage. 

Grabbing the keys, he hopped inside the well-kept classic and pulled it into the open space.

“Needed an break,” Jack replied to Pete’s questioning look.

With oil carton in one hand and a pan in the other, he got to work.

*“If you’re not winning, you're losing, Jack.”* The thought nagged him everyday. *“Success equals profit and profit is hard work. You gotta work harder, Jack, or you’ll end up like Old Joe.”*

He shook his head, but the thoughts remained, helping themselves to his mind and emotions at will. Jack pursed his lips again, frustration rising.

“I’ll keep working harder,” he responded to the thoughts. “I’ll make money.  I’ll make money and make Riley and the kids happy. My employees will be happy, too. I may be tough, but they’ll love me.”

THE THOUGHTS plagued him. All day long they plagued him like he was 17th century London. Nothing he tried sterilized the despair spreading through the streets of his soul. 

This frustrated him and added to his torment friction and pressure. Slowly, the heat rose and the pressure intensified until ignition. For all his determination and grit, Jack Martin was burning out. 

London was on fire.

JACK STARED down at his coffee, swirling it slowly. His stomach was doing the same thing.

His heart pounded as he spoke, “I want to help people, I think,” he said. He raised his head to look at the old man sitting across his office desk from him. He wasn’t used to being vulnerable with others, nor did he like feeling confused.

“I don’t think that was my motive when I first started. Then, all I wanted was to not be a failure like Joe: to run a successful business, raise a happy family, and make some money. Okay, a lot of money. But,” he paused and looked down at his coffee again. 

Furrowing his eyebrows together and pursing his lips, he continued, “I think, now, I want a legacy that lasts longer than the date on my tombstone.”

“Mmm,” the old man nodded. “Harder than you thought, huh?” he said in his growling bass voice.

“Don’t get me wrong, the business isn’t hurting--though it’s certainly not growing nor is my paycheck,” he inserted. “My family has nothing to complain about: we have a nice house and car. Even a swimming pool in the back. My wife doesn’t have to work if she doesn’t want to. She hangs out with her girlfriends all she wants and pursues whatever charitable work she feels compelled to pursue...”

He trailed off.

“But something's bothering ya, deeper,” the old man growled. “What is it, Jack?”

“Well, it’s--I think--” Jack hesitated as his cheeks glowed red with embarrassment. “It seems like nothing is enough. I slave away at work day and night, and I give my family the basic things they want, make a decent amount of money--but it’s still not enough\!” he sat straighter, clenching his jaw.  “And…”

“And what?”

“You wouldn’t understand--I’m not sure *I* even understand. Nobody understands.”

“C’mon, Jack. I know what it’s like. You gotta let it out.”

“How could you understand? You’ve never led a business.”

“But I have been a leader,” the old man replied softly, his bass voice still growling. “And I’ve known businessmen all my life. I understand more than you think. And I know that you will only be torn apart until you let out what’s all stuck up in here.” He leaned over the desk and poked the younger man in the chest.

Jack rubbed his chest as if the poke hurt. 

He looked at the old man who was waving for more coffee. Jack saw in his face--tan from years of hard work in the sun--that same old fiery passion that originally drew Jack to the man

Jack didn’t really do mentors--his ego never let him. But this old man had been there for him when no one else--even his own father--had been. This was the man Jack always came to for answers and the old guy always showed up, usually just to listen, sometimes to give answers. Jack could not have gotten off first base in manhood without the old man’s support--let alone woo a woman or raise a family or lead a business.

Maybe Jack did do mentors.

“What are you feeling? Can you describe that?” the mentor asked.

“Yeah, I suppose I could, but I don’t know why it matters,” Jack replied.

“It matters a great deal,” the old man explained. “Do you pay attention to the dash lights on your truck?”

“Of course I do.”

“Your *feelings* are the dash lights of your heart and soul. Sometimes they are simply out of whack and even wrong, but most of the time they give warning to a deeper problem. You’d do very well to pay attention to your feelings, son.”

“I guess I feel,” Jack explained. “I feel--like I don’t know what to do. Like my engines roaring, but my wheels are spinning and flinging dirt everywhere.”

The old man set his coffee on the desk and brought his hands together up to his face, thinking.

“You know, Jack, you nee--” he began to speak but paused. “Well, let me just show you. Meet me at the Cafe on Lewis next Thursday--I guess that’s tomorrow morning isn’t it? Be there tomorrow morning at six.”

“What will I see? Is it worth my time?”

“Just come and watch, Jack.”

And with that, the old man took one last swig of coffee, grabbed his hat, and left.

Jack exhaled slowly, staring blankly at his coffee, again, wondering what the old guy was planning to show him.

“I hope it helps.” 

Noticing the time Jack decided to let Pete close up shop. He jumped back into his Tacoma and turned the key. Nothing happened. A light on his dash caught his attention. 

It flashed: “*Check Engine.*”

TWENTY-ONE MINUTES after five, Jack finally pulled into his driveway. His kids chased each other giggling and laughing around the front lawn.

He pushed his remote to lift the garage door as his truck passed through the driveway, passed the garden, passed the playing kids. Shutting the garage door, Jack wiped his brow, relieved by the shade of the house, and entered the kitchen through the garage entry. 

To Jack’s surprise, the kitchen contained neither wife nor supper. He searched his memory for an explanation as he walked into the living room. He found her sitting with her back towards him, oblivious to his entrance and clearly not cooking.

Riley Martin tapped away at her computer, earbuds in, eyes down. Jack waited, annoyed by the disconnect between reality and his ritualistic expectations.

Apparently still not noticing his presence, she continued working away, so he decided to as well, going about his routine like normal. Perhaps the explanation would come to him.

When he finally walked out of the shower, towel in hand, Riley stood primping herself in front of the mirror.

“We commemorating the hungry tonight?” Jack asked sarcastically, looking at her through the mirror.

Riley returned his look, furrowing her brow like his. Her eyes twitched with anger--but a sort of sad anger, he noticed.

“Don’t you remember?” she said unmoved.

“Was I supposed to remember something?”

“Several things.”

Jack pursed his lips. Work was frustrating enough. Why did he have to deal with this ingratitude at home?

“The banquet?” she reminded him.

Jack closed his eyes and hung his head, groaning inwardly at himself. The church banquet was that night and he had completely forgotten.

He bit his tongue, hard. Everything within him wanted to defend himself, but he was caught and he knew it.

With all his might, he attempted to right his wrong, “I’m sorry. I forgot all about it. What time does it start?”

“Six-thirty.”

“Okay, we’ve still got time. We’ll be late, but we can be ready in forty-five minutes, can’t we?”

“I can.” 

Riley’s face remained unchanged in the mirror as she worked away at her hair.

“Perhaps you should apologize to your son, too,” she mumbled.

Jack glared at her. More than annoyed now at her lack of reception to his apology, while also feeling incredible shame. He had also forgotten Jimmy’s tee-ball game--the first tee-ball game of his son’s life.

The plaguing thoughts, lingering in the shadows of his mind, pounced immediately. 

*“You failure\! They’re unhappy. She’s unhappy. What can you do now? Nothing.”*

But other thoughts poured in as well: justification, anger, resentment, defense: *“She doesn’t understand. Work is busy. I’m a good husband and father. She is simply ungrateful.”*

“Look, I’m sorry I forgot. Let’s just go to the banquet and talk about this later.”

“That’s okay. You're busy, I know. You don’t have to come to the banquet.”

Jack tried hard to restrain himself. It was bad enough to have failed twice in one day, now she was making it sound like he didn’t care about what she cared about.

“No\!” he said emphatically, “I *want* to go to the banquet. We’ll leave as soon as possible.”

With those words, he walked away, desperately trying to shove the anger deeper into the dark corners of his soul. But the despair only rose higher and consumed more of his mind.

*“So much for working harder, Jack Martin. You can’t keep up. You’re certainly not helping.”*

LONDON’S FIRE raged hotter.

**Chapter 2**   
***An Introduction to Comradery***

A MAN feels despair when his thoughts tell him he’s not enough. He feels anger when his heart tells him that he *is* enough but fails to prove it.

In his heart, Jack knew he had what it took to run a successful mechanic shop, but his mind screamed to the contrary and did a better job proving it.

This internal friction consumes a man until it takes him out.

Jack made it to the church banquet. He escorted his beautiful wife to their seats. He smiled and chatted like everything was all right with Mr. Martin.

But inside he burned. 

Despite all his fanciful dreams and determination, his business was mediocre, his marriage dissolving into frustrations, his children certainly (so he thought) disappointed in him, and his social life a complete facade.

He nodded and smiled as Mr. Robertson, the roofer, drolled on and on about some business accountability group he had started attending.

“It’s a little pricey,” Mr. Robertson said. “But totally worth it. I’ve received such good input and support from the other business people attending.”

“Oh yeah?” Jack replied placidly.

“Yeah, they helped me find solutions to some employee-related obstacles I was facing. Hey\!” He seemed to have a sudden inspiration. “Why don’t you join us next week?” Robertson suggested.

“Oh, there’s no way I’d have time.” Jack surprised even himself at the indifference in his own voice.

“Well, if you ever find the time, let me know. It’s worth it, man.”

“Sure” was all Jack could answer.

THE MARTINS drove home in silence.

It was all Jack could do to hold his tongue. It was all Jack could to do to not give in to the thoughts screaming in his head.

He wanted to prove himself, to compile all his arguments and level the prosecution. But Jack knew good husbands don’t “level” their wives. The last thing he needed was a third strike in the good-husbandry game.

So he continued to shun his despair to the darkest alleys of his soul. 

But the fire within him intensified.

“I’m--I’m sorry” the words tumbled out of his mouth. He didn’t look at Riley because he didn’t want to see her not looking at him. “I’m sorry for forgetting…” he trailed off, waiting for some sort of acknowledgement.

It never came.

Jack clenched his teeth. 

They arrived home, went to bed, and fell asleep.

*“I’LL BE gone until nine tomorrow morning, Jack. Do you think you can handle the shop on your own?”*

*“Yes sir. Don’t worry about me, Mr. Joe. I’m your man\!”*

*Joe smiled, “Yes, you are son. My only man.”*

*The next morning, young Jack opened the shop on his own for the first time. It felt good, even exhilarating. It felt like, for the first time, this was his shop, too, not just Joe’s.*

*The phone rang.*

*“You’ve reached Joe’s Auto Repair. This is Jack speaking. How may I help you?” He said into the telephone.*

*“Hi Jack\!” asked a sweet voice on the other side. “Is Mr. Joe there?”*

*“I’m sorry, he won’t be in until nine o’clock. Would you like to leave a message for him?”*

*“Oh, well, I just needed to ask if he could spare me a little more time to make my payment. You see, it’s my grandson… He needed some extra cash for college and, well…” the old lady trailed off.*

*“I’m sorry ma'am, what is your name?”*

*“Mrs. Jensen. Joe will know me.”*

*Jack knew Joe couldn’t afford another late payment from a customer. He wished Mrs. Jensen realized that, but it wasn’t his decision.*

*Gulping back his frustration, he said what he knew Joe would want him to say, “I’ll let him know you called, Mrs. Jensen. Can I do anything more for you?”*

*“No, that’s all I needed. Thank-you\! It was nice talking to you\! Ba-bye now\!”*

*Jack squinted down at his note.* 

*Another IOU. Another late payment. Another stunted paycheck for Jack.*

This was a dream. Even his dreams were reminding Jack of the frustration that built up within him even before college. They reminded him of why he thought the way he did. Why he believed a business was nothing without profit. And more significantly, why he was nothing without a profitable business.

But then the dream changed from past memories to present torment.

*“I’m disappointed in you, Jack.”* 

*Riley’s face floated before him, vivid yet vague, as only dreams can do.* 

*“Why can’t you do better?”*

*“I’m trying\!” Jack shouted in his dream. “You just don’t understand what it takes to run a business. It takes hard work, lots of hard work--and patience, Ri\!  But I’m trying\! Just give me a break.”*

“Give me a break\!”

Jack jolted out of sleep. He looked around, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. The room seemed unfamiliar, like the world often seems after abruptly waking from a deep sleep. 

He looked at the clock and sighed. It read *4:34 AM*. Too soon to wake up, too late to get any more decent rest.

He turned to his wife, as was his habit. 

She really was beautiful. And he loved her; he knew it in his head. But inwardly, he still felt the confused, nondescript frustration you get after dreaming negatively of someone you know. He felt angry at her. And he felt angry at his anger.

Her sullenness had hurt last night. It was immature. And it frustrated him. But he still loved her and he’d do anything to make her happy, even if it meant working long, hard hours.

But did she want that?

Of course, she wanted the business to be successful. She certainly put a lot of work into it. But what she really wanted was him, wasn’t it? She wanted him to care about her and their children. To remember them--and the stuff they cared about.

She wanted him to remember first tee-ball games and romantic events. Instead, he was consumed with growing his business. But what kind of husband would he be if he failed as a provider?

His employees wanted a respectable paycheck, a positive future, and a boss who could afford to let them take meaningful times off. But the business Jack ran straddled such a fine financial line, he could never afford to let them go, or give generous bonuses.

Whatever he was doing wasn’t working. One tear loosed from Jack’s eye as he wrestled with the clash of strangling frustration and overwhelming love.

He remembered the invitation he had to breakfast the following morning. Perhaps his old friend could help him find the answers. He sure hoped so.

“JACK\!” THE Old Man called from his table, motioning him over. “Have a seat.”

The young entrepreneur surveyed the scene as he made his way over to where his old friend sat. 

Four others surrounded the table with the old man. One man, with hat, boots, and a large-buckled belt--obviously playing the part of the cowboy--was telling some grand story and gesticulating dramatically, while the others around him listened and laughed and scoffed at the details. 

Another man sitting beside the cowboy and of a considerably different size and style, who was looking to be in his low 60s, rolled his eyes at the cowboy and offered his hand to Jack.

“My name is Trevor, but only officially. Please, call me Trev unless you work for the government.” The men all laughed and then in turn introduced themselves.

These men were confident, with a distinguished aura about them, as if they had done much and been much, and knew it. Yet, they immediately put Jack at ease with their comfortable and casual down-to-earth interaction. Something told him these were great men, yet he didn’t recognize a single face in the group.

“Jack, these are some of my oldest friends,” the man explained.

“Yeah, you can tell by the gray hair,” said the fattest and seemingly oldest of them who spoke in a weak kiwi accent. Jack tried to remember his name, but had already forgotten.

“Longest lasting, I mean\!” the old man clarified rolling his eyes. “Please, have a seat, Jack.” He motioned to the one empty seat around the table.

The mechanic felt like a small child sitting with the adults, but the men welcomed him in with no hesitation, as if he were one of them.

Jack observed more than he participated in the conversation that followed. He had never seen such a group interact before. These distinguished men laughed until they cried. They told stories and reminisced together. They joked and poked fun at each other, yet affirmed each other through the twinkle in their eye.

But soon, after the jokes were out and the food was in, the atmosphere stilled and Jack’s old friend spoke up.

“Carl, how goes the project?”

“Oh, it’s going fine. Just put the finishing touches on the frame this week. Now I just have to finish off the inside and get to work on the important stuff.”

Jack looked at his friend inquiringly, who took the hint.

“Carl here is a former career pilot. He began in Vietnam and ended in private commercial. Now, he’s building an airplane of his own.”

Jack raised his eyebrows, speechless.

“For a customer?” he finally asked.

“No, son, I’m retired,” Carl laughed. All the men laughed, too, though not in a condescending way, but with the amusement older siblings experience when their younger brother asks a silly question.

Jack couldn’t believe Carl, retired and in his upper sixties, was building an airplane. 

The conversation continued with each of the men pestering Carl with questions about what exactly needed to happen next, what the costs were, whether or not the project was getting along as quickly as he had expected, and other details they apparently found interesting.

Soon, it was another man’s turn to share.

One was a retired educator who currently tutored a smattering of struggling students. Another had been a career restaurateur, who now ran a homeless shelter in town.

And so it went, each of them in turn sharing what they were doing and taking questions from everybody about how it was going.

Jack wasn’t sure whether to be astonished, amused, or intrigued. These successful leaders and businessmen who had worked hard all their lives, weren’t done. They hadn’t quit life to play shuffleboard for the next 20 years. They were still going, still chasing their dreams, still changing the world.

“WHAT WAS that?” Jack asked his friend after everyone left.

“What was what?” the old man said.

“All that\!” Jack exclaimed, waving his arms in circles. “All that talking and brainstorming?”

“Those are my friends and comrades-in-life,” he replied. “This is what I wanted to show you. I believe this is part of the answer to your questions, Jack.”

“Your friends are the answer?”

“Sort of.”

“I’m sorry, I don’t get it.” Jack wrinkled his brow.

“This group of ours has been meeting in some shape or form on and off for nearly forty years.”

Jack’s mouth dropped open.

“Forty years?\!”

“Yes sir. Certainly, a couple have come and gone and we’ve added a few, but for the most part, this has been the group.”

“Why on earth?” Jack questioned.

“Because we needed it. Each of us were businessmen or leaders in some way. We knew we needed support, advice, and outside perspective. So we’ve gotten together nearly every week to eat breakfast, share a joke or two, and help each other in our endeavors. It started out as a business strategy. Now we’re fast friends.”

He leaned close and lowered his voice to a whisper, “Truth is, we keep starting projects and building stuff just to have a reason to get together.” He let out a deep chuckle.

Jack shook his head slowly.

Looking him in the eye, the old man said: “If you want your business to grow, you have to find men like this. Men who are doing stuff. Men who are learning and growing and have connections.”

“That sounds ideal, but I would never have time--” The old man stopped Jack mid-sentence.

“Wait\! Before you start going on about how time-consuming this is, let me explain my plan.”

“Your plan?”

“Jack, yesterday you vented to me about how frustrated you were with the business. What you thought you wanted from the business was not only not happening, but even changing. You were tired, frustrated, and angry.”

“Angry? I don’t recall saying--”

“I’ve been in your shoes, son,” he interrupted Jack again. “I know that frustration. You’re up against a wall you can’t identify, let alone get around. It’s creating a lot of friction inside of you. I saw the look in your eye. I felt it in your mood. I heard it in your voice. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to burn-up and burn-out. But you don’t know what to do.”

“I certainly can’t just blow a few hours every week chewing the cud with my buddies\!” Jack said. “Maybe once I’ve had a good long life and am retired. But right now I have a wife and family at home. I have employees needing a consistent paycheck. Suppliers needing their money. Not to mention increasing loans to pay interest on\!” The words all tumbled out with more heat than Jack had anticipated. He took in a long breathe.

“I think you’re wrong. I think spending time in something like this is one of the best investments you could make,” the old man said calmly. “This isn’t about blowing time with your friends. These are all high-value men. Who have been places and seen things most people only dream of. Furthermore, we all started meeting long before retirement.”

“What’s your plan?” Jack asked.

“For the next five weeks, give me two hours once a week.” Jack looked away as the old man explained the plan. “Just meet with me every Thursday morning just like this morning. Watch the group, observe their habits, their conversations, their ideas and strategies. Once they all leave, let me tell you their stories. If after five weeks, you still don’t see the value in a group like this, so be it. That’s fine. You can continue doing what you’re doing.

“But I don’t think that’ll be the case. In fact, I fully expect by the end of five weeks, you’ll have started putting time and money into your own mastermind\!” He grinned.

Jack looked silently at his old mentor.

“Can you do that Jack? Is your business and your family worth it to you?”

The younger man thought for a moment. 

What other choice did he have?

**Chapter 3: The First Week**   
***Personal Development Takes Too Much Time and Money***

“I FIRST met Carl in college. He was fresh out of ‘Nam and I was a sophomore at the university.”

Jack did rejoin his mentor and the group of retired men for their Thursday morning routine--despite his hesitation. The old man was right. He was desperate for a breakthrough for his business and family. What other options did he have?

Now, after all the other men had left, Jack once again sat across from his old friend, listening to the first story.

“We were taking the same speech class under Professor Gorman. Terribly boring,” the old fellow said with a role of his eyes. “Neither of us learned a thing. Of course, this preceded Carl’s pilot career. In fact we were both, at the time, eyeing totally different careers than we ended up pursuing.

“Anyways,” he continued. “We didn’t learn a thing from Gorman, but we did from each other. We sat in the back row and dreamt of all the things we would rather be doing.”

The old man cleared his throat and continued with a twinkle: “The kids these days have it easy with their phones. Back then, we had to be very subtle when ignoring the teacher. We wrote our dreams and ideas down in our notebooks then slyly swapped and replied to what the other wrote.

“It just looked like we were taking notes.” The older man smiled, obviously recalling fond memories. “Besides, Gorman wasn’t the quickest professor on the campus,” he added. “I was trying my hand at politics, during those days.”

“No way\!” Jack gaped. “You? In politics?”

“Yes\!” the old man released a booming laugh. “This wasn’t long after the sixties, remember. We hadn’t yet discovered not everyone is born a politician. I vainly tried to organize a team and a movement. I fantasized about starting a new party that would rise above the divisiveness of petty party politics. See my delusion already? I thought I could bring America into the new age of freedom and liberty. I figured I’d be about ready for the presidency by the turn of the century.”

He laughed again.

“Carl, on the other hand, was pursuing a degree in communication.” The man laughed even harder at the thought. “Imagine\! Carl, a speaker? We were so young.”

Jack chuckled, too, more at his friend’s amusement than at the thought of Carl being a speaker.

“So what happened?” he asked the old man.

“With Carl?”

“No, with your political career.”

“Well, my political career would eventually fizzle out like carbonated water. But the party was still a work in progress,” the man nestled in for the story. “Which is actually where we should begin.” He said with a twinkle. “Jack, you know a lot already. You know the basics of business, right?”

“I’ve spent six years building my business, so, yeah, I would say so.”

“That means less groundwork for us to cover. If you really want to go to the next level with your business, the first thing you need to learn is the importance of contribution. So I’m going to tell you today what I learned from Carl about contribution.”

“Contribution?” Jack repeated distracted slightly by his smartphone.

“Yes, contribution. But I don’t mean contribution like paying into a financial kitty. I’m talking about contributing something much more valuable than money. I’m talking about the contribution of--well,” the old man stopped and looked at Jack’s phone. “I guess you probably don’t have time for this story,” he said with mock self-pity.

Setting his phone down, Jack pulled his arms together and leaned in. 

“Sorry.” He smiled sheepishly. “I am interested. I want to hear.”

The older man straightened. “Good,” he said eyeing Jack with a mischievous grin. He waved his mug at the waitress for more coffee. 

“Like I said, my political career wouldn’t last long. However, the team--the party some of us were building, had struck a chord with other students. People wanted in on it. They wanted to hear our ideas and discuss them. It was great, but the structure was fragile. We were weak and beginning to fracture.

“My bull-headed opinions and fist pounding sermons certainly didn’t help anything. People liked being part of the discussions. They liked the setting, but I think they found it hard to follow me as a leader. I enjoyed hearing my own opinions and hated being challenged or put in my place. I was a one man show.

“People started grumbling--you know how that happens. One off-hand comment about bad leadership and next thing you know everybody’s talking about all the problems. Of course, no one talks to the people who actually need to hear the feedback so they can change.”

“Gossip,” Jack mumbled with disdain.

“You know what I’m talking about, then?”

“Yes, I do.”

“It’s an awful thing, but that’s a whole other story.” The old man waved the topic aside. “Once I got wind of the grumblings, I immediately started taking steps to solve the problem. But instead of going to trusted friends and advisors like I should have done--you know, people like Carl or even the actual people doing the grumbling--I went to this ‘great,’ ‘groundbreaking’ seminar on leadership and teamwork.”

“You had those back then?” Jack asked.

“Son, this was the ‘70s. The days of enlightenment and dawn of the new age. We invented self-help seminars\! And at first, I loved it. They gave me all kinds of resources--workbooks, motivational tapes and the like. It all made me feel good for a while, but never made a long lasting impact.

“I would get so frustrated. Sometimes I was frustrated with myself for investing so much money and time into those crazy seminars. Then I’d get frustrated at the guys selling the seminars and writing the books. What rip-offs\! Some days, I was just angry and frustrated for no particular reason. I felt stuck with the whole political party and leadership thing. I felt like all the energy I put into making myself better was going to waste.

“Looking back, I see that their material was ineffective, because it was incomplete. You always needed to join one more program or buy another book, or something even more expensive.”

“Hasn’t changed a bit.”

The old man shook his head. “Yeah, I found out real quick that most ‘business’ or ‘leadership’ seminars promising success were over-priced and ultimately unhelpful. Most of the time they just didn’t align with my values.”

Jack nodded in agreement. 

“You know what I mean, huh?” the man chuckled. “Although I realized they weren’t always worth their price, I did learn some things during that time. One thing I learned was that you don’t have to apply every single thing from every single seminar or book. All you need to do is learn one or two things you can apply really well.

“At the end of the day, though,” he continued with a yawn. “What I really found helpful were those conversations with Carl. The back-row note-swapping sessions were much more effective than any of those expensive seminars.

“You know,” he said, suddenly reminiscent. “Carl had this way of putting people at ease by asking questions. This always got them to talk. I and my political buddies just argued and defended ourselves. But Carl gently pulled ideas from people and allowed them a place at the table, so to speak.”

He paused, setting his mug down and looking up at the vine entangled lattice overhead which provided shade for the cafe courtyard.

“The real breakthrough for me came one time when Carl was especially blunt with me. We were trading notes again in Professor Gorman’s class. I had written a long soliloquy about some idea a fellow student had shared in our party meeting and how stupid I thought it was.” 

Jack’s mentor pulled out what looked like a photocopy of an old notebook paper and began to read.

“‘Do you think he’s really the stupid one?’ Carl wrote back. ‘Sure, his ideology may be naive, but don’t you think, if you look closely, there’s gold under the naivety? There always is. You just have to mine it out. If you immediately reject the ideas people offer you, you’ll never produce a refined idea. You’ll have no revelations, no light-bulb moments, no innovation. Just the ideas in your own head because you don’t think anyone else has anything to offer. Truth be told, bud, the ideas in your head won’t change the world. It takes a team.’”

“Ouch\!” Jack empathized. “That must’ve hurt.”

“Well, I got over it,” the old man dismissed. “What Carl was talking about was *contribution*. The contribution of ideas and criticism. You can’t light a fire with one stick or a single match. You need *two* sticks or *two* flints; a match *and* a striker. The same is true for any type of venture, whether a political party, a non-profit, a church, a family, or, most certainly, a business like yours. You can’t do this alone. You need contribution. You need people to rub your ideas against in order to make a spark. You need to do business in strong community.”

He paused, to let Jack think about it.

After a moment, Jack sat up. “This all sounds ideal,” he said, “but I just don’t have time for it. I have so much to do: paperwork, follow-up calls--let alone the actual mechanic work. I can’t do it.”

“There you go again,” the old man sighed. “That’s what I said at first, too. But like Carl told me: ‘If you want to facilitate a successful movement,’ he said, ‘you gotta strategize--together, with other people. Get the ones most committed and creative to start having meetings with you.’

“I resisted at first. I could barely split my time between politics and homework and all the other activities I was already involved with. Strategy meetings sounded like just one more thing to add to my busy schedule. 

“Nevertheless, I was passionate about this movement. I wanted to make it a success and I knew Carl was right. I knew if we were going to make a difference in our political sphere, I had to start allowing everyone’s voice to be heard--even the ones I most disagreed with. I had to listen to people’s feedback about what was effective or ineffective. People had good thoughts on how we could improve what we were already doing and what we needed to cut back or out completely. If I wanted our message to spread, I had to hear these people.

“I knew it would take time. But I also knew if I didn’t take it seriously, I would be waving our beloved party--and any hope of change--good-bye. So I did it. I plunged in.”

“What did you do?” Jack asked.

“I started by taking a hard look at every activity I participated in--the things eating up my time. I eliminated anything I was not passionately committed to. I saw change needed to happen and I chased after it. I only left my studies, the party, and the activities that truly re-energized me. I saw, with Carl’s help, that I had to make time for feedback and brainstorming, so I cleared my schedule to make room.

“I organized strategy meetings. I included more people in our discussion times. I argued less and listened more. I sent out surveys of the student body as a whole and our political party specifically. I got feedback.

“Soon, it stopped being all *“I”* and “*my”* and became “*us*” and “*ours.*” It grew into a true movement and people loved it. Even after I left the university, having realized politics wasn’t my calling, ‘The Party’--as we called it--was alive and well. I believe it was making a meaningful difference, too.”

“And you think this happened because you started meeting with other people and listening to them better?” Jack asked.

“Yes\! Exactly that\!”

“Well, I’m glad it all worked out for your party,” Jack said. “But I’m just a mechanic. I’m not a politician. I’m not working with ideas or people. I’m working with cars and inanimate tools.”

“Oh, but you do work with people, Jack. You have employees, don’t you? You have customers. You have a family and neighbors, friends, a church: you do work with people and ideas. If you want your business to grow, you have to start valuing contribution. When you’re stuck in quicksand, struggling on your own only pushes you deeper. You need friends to help you out of quicksand.”

“So you think if I get together with some friend to talk about my business, it could grow?”

“Not exactly. I’m saying being involved in a community of mutual giving--contribution--is where successful leaders spring from. It doesn’t just involve talking about *your* business. It involves contributing your ideas to *theirs* as well. You grow by contributing back-and-forth to other people and them to you. Furthermore, it involves growing *personally*.”

“Personally? You mean, like some sort of “Life Coaching Program”? Jack scoffed.

The old man nodded without batting an eye. “If you don’t grow yourself, Jack, how in the world do you expect to grow your business?” The old mentor continued, “Things go on beneath the surface that keep you from generating your best work. You know that, deep down. You just won’t admit it yet.”

Jack squirmed in his seat.

“Did this Friday-morning-group-accountability-thing that you’re still doing come out of your political party?” he said, changing the subject.

He was beginning to feel uncomfortable. The old man was digging too deep. They both knew it. Jack’s thick veneer hid a city plagued by failure, frustrating pressure, and inadequacy. Jack’s soul, diseased and burning, screamed in terror at the idea of being found out. So Jack tried to bypass the real issues to distract the old man from what was really going on.

The mentor eyed Jack tenderly. He saw a new fire blazing in the younger man’s eyes. Whether good or bad, he couldn’t tell yet. He felt compassion for the mechanic because he had been there, too, many years ago. He would let Jack play his little games for now, but eventually Jack would need to tear away the veneer or he would suffocate.

“Oh, no\!” he said. “No, Carl wasn’t much interested in politics. Neither was I, to be honest, it just took me some time to figure that out. No, this group came out of those note-trading sessions in the back of Professor Gorman’s class. Little did we know what started out as just a couple of bored students was only the beginning.”

“The beginning of what?” Jack asked.

The old man spread out his arms, as if to point at the table.

“The beginning of an invaluable relationship between the two of us lasting over forty years, eventually including all of these fine gentlemen you’ve been getting to know.”

“I see,” Jack said.

“Everything I know about contribution and collaboration, came from Carl. Don’t know where he learned it, but he did. Somewhere, somehow.” The old man shrugged. “If I hadn’t listened to him and asked him questions and if he hadn’t been bold enough to offer his advice, all of that wisdom and experience would have gone untapped inside his head--at least by me.”

Jack began to respond, but his old mentor continued.

“I learned many things about leadership and business through starting a political movement,” he said. “But two things in particular stand out to me. First,” he held up his finger, “you must learn from your peers and comrades--like we’ve been talking about. Second, there is no greater teacher than experience, both your own and that others. Almost all of this learning happens in the context of strong community.”

Jack watched the waitress start cleaning up their breakfast dishes.

Looking at his mentor, he said, “I’ve known you all these years and yet have never heard this--I didn’t even know about this group of friends. Why didn’t you tell me?”

“You never asked.”

Jack tilted his head to the side. It was true, he hadn’t asked. He had just plunged into business and never once thought to ask his old friend.

“Why didn’t you ever go into business if you knew so much about it,” he asked the old man.

“Well…” He gazed off, past the cafe and morning traffic jamming Lewis street. He seemed to be looking at something a long way off. But Jack could see nothing beyond the opposing shops. “I was meant to do something else, I guess.” He grinned mildly.

Jack opened his mouth to lodge another question, but the old man stopped him.

“Ah, I think that’s enough for today,” he said stretching and yawning again. “Keep your eyes open this week. All around you, there is plenty of untapped potential and untapped wisdom and experience. Look for it. Seek it out. Learn from it. Next week, perhaps we’ll talk about Kip.”

“Kip? The restaurateur?”

“That’s the one. He’s got a fascinating story. But you’ll have to come back next week if you want to hear about how he only worked three days a week by the end of his career.” The old man’s eyes twinkled.

Incredulous, Jack began to mock the idea, but the old man held up his hands.

“Next week, Jack. I’ll tell it all.”

**Chapter 4: The Second Meeting**  
***“I have to work long hours to be successful”***

“JACK, YOU have to start working fewer hours.” 

Jack’s old friend started week two of their new routine with the bombshell statement.

“Work fewer hours?\!” Jack retorted. “I think all this analytical stuff has gone to your head, sir.”

They both chuckled.

“Naw, I’m serious Jack\! You need to shed this mindset of ‘Work hard, work long; take no time off.’”

“But that’s business\! It’s hard work. It takes long hours,” the younger man rejoined, more confident than he really was.

The old man looked him square in the eye for a moment before asking: “How’s that workin’ for ya?”

The question hung in the air, unanswered. Jack couldn’t respond. Truth was, it wasn’t working out for him--not in the way he had hopped.

“But…” he stammered. “But...there’s more than that, to my problems. That’s not what’s holding me back.” He paused before adding: “Is it?”

“It’s a big part, Jack--being addicted to work. It’s not everything. But it is definitely a big part of it,” he repeated.

Jack gazed out the window and across the street where the proprietor of a flower shop was just opening his doors. 

Although he became more comfortable each week with the idea of sharing his struggles to his mentor, it still made him nervous. Exposing the embarrassing weaknesses and frustrations long ago relegated to the dark alleyways of his soul wasn’t exactly his favorite past-time. He didn’t like admitting ignorance to anything, let alone business. He had been trained in mechanics *and* business. He thought he already knew all there was to know about running his shop. Apparently not. 

And now, his mentor was trying to throw away one of mankind's best understood principles.

“How could hard work and long hours stunt the growth of my business? That doesn’t make any sense.”

“Oh, hard work is good. The issue is using your time efficiently. Let me ask you this: Who processes the bills at your shop?”

“I do,” Jack replied.

“Is that what you envisioned doing when you opened a mechanic shop: Processing bills?”

“No, of course--”

“Why did you open your mechanic shop, Jack?”

“To work on cars...to do what I love, what I’m good at\!” Jack answered. These felt like simpleton questions, which annoyed him.

“Do you love processing your bills? Do you love running payroll? Do you love running to AutoZone for small, forgotten parts?”

“Of course not, but it’s a necess--”

“Then why are you still spending long hours processing all that paperwork, Jack?”

Jack furrowed his brow and pursed his lips. Silent, but pondering, trying to figure the old man out.

Folding his weathered hands and resting them on his stomach, the old man nestled back into his chair: It was story time.

“This morning, I want to tell you the story of Kip, because he struggled with this exact same problem,” the mentor explained. “He dreamt of running his own successful restaurant ever since he was a kid. You’ve seen him, observed him relate to the rest of us. How would you describe him?”

Jack thought for a moment before responding.

“Full of energy and grit--a hard worker,” he finally said. “Perhaps a bit raw in his approach to relationships--though he strikes me as incredibly tender-hearted.”

“That’s good. You observe well,” the older man complimented. “I know few men who have worked harder than Kip during their careers. Unfortunately, that drivenness--grit as you said--and raw way of relating is what tore his family apart.”

“Oh?” Jack raised his brow. “I didn’t realize he had family.”

“Not many do. His work ethic destroyed it.”

Jack straightened, interested to know the story now. 

“By nature, the man doesn’t know how to stop. He’s a workaholic--or he used to be, rather. He learned the hard way success isn’t all about money.

“He’s originally from New Zealand, you know.”

“I could tell by the accent.”

“Kip came to Colorado during the ‘60s, trying to get away from the pill-popping, surf-riding hippie crowd his brother and sister had fallen in with. They sought meaning through drugs and pleasure. Kip looked for it in money and success.

“He determined to make something of himself and follow his dreams. That was his life. That’s what defined him.

“I met him in ‘74,  in one of his restaurants. At the time, it was his only establishment.

“I was barely out of college and ready to take on the world. There I was, eating a delicious steak at this new place in the river city. Suddenly, through the kitchen doors bounded this young, well-built, fire-ball of a man who appeared to be in his upper twenties. He was 28, to be exact.

“The guy shot like lightning through the room and never stopped.

“‘Hey you, do this,’ he would tell an employee. ‘Don’t forget this,’ he told another. ‘Waitress, you’ll have to cover these guests.’ ‘Busboy, can you clean those tables, please?’ 

“I wanted to meet this alien force of a man. So, at one point in the evening when he landed for air, I invaded his sphere and introduced myself.

“All I managed to get out of him was one run on sentence. ‘Name’s Kip, sir. Very nice to meet you; hope you enjoyed yourself--come again\!--sorry, can’t chat: lots to do when running a new business, ya know.’ Next thing I knew, he had scurried off to continue his managing. I thought right then and there if this man doesn’t stop for a breath, he’s going to very quickly self-destruct.

“Anyways, so every time on my way through, I stopped in at *Kip’s* for a nice juicy steak and a chance to catch the fire-ball and talk to him. It didn’t take long at all to realize Kip lived by the dangerous idea that in order to make his restaurant a success, he had to work long, dreadful hours.

“I remember, one night--after a few months of getting to know each other pretty well, I caught him closing up shack all by himself.

“‘What’re your plans for the rest of the evening, Kip?’ I asked. “Do you enjoy bowling? I think there’s an alley not too far from here.”

“‘Ah, there is--up three blocks. I suppose I’d enjoy it, I just never have the time,” he responded. He barely even looked up from his paperwork--bills and such, by the look of it.

“‘Gotta sweep this floor--it’s a mess--after I’ve finished-up this paperwork. Then I got some other random bitties to do yet before I go home to the missus.’

“I nearly fell over from shock right in front of him. Not only at the fact that the proprietor of the restaurant was sweeping the floor by himself, but he also had a wife waiting for him at home\! 

“‘Sounds incredibly busy, man,’ I told him.”

“‘It’s all part of being an entrepreneur, bro,’ he replied.

“Like I said, Kip was incredibly driven. He loved serving people, loved crafting delicious food, and loved making money doing it. The food service industry fitted him perfectly. But just like you now, he carried this dangerous mindset of ‘My business won’t succeed unless I work long hours.’”

“But isn’t that just reality,” Jack inserted. “Isn’t that part of the toll of being an entrepreneur?”

“You’re right,” the old man surprised Jack by agreeing with him. “It is part of the toll. It’s hard work to get a business off the ground. It often demands long hours from you. But driving yourself--and the people around you--nutty by working crazy hours doesn’t guarantee success. Like I’ve been saying, it’s usually the quickest route to disaster.”

He let Jack ponder the thought.

“Let me give you an example from Kip’s life.

“The longer I got to know him the more my suspicions were confirmed: This man was drunk on work and in perilous danger of a bad crash. In fact, he told me once he didn’t feel satisfied with himself unless he put in at least sixty hours a week at the restaurant. He was measuring his success by how many hours of work he put in\!” The old man slapped his hands on the table in exclamation before continuing. “About two years into the venture, Kip hit a major plateau--much like where you’re at today. He had worked hard and was very tired, but the business had survived.

“His most discouraging moment came after working eight days in a row. Understandably, his wife was not excited about these work hours and was trying to get his attention. This particular night, despite his exhaustion, they argued long past midnight.

“I remember his call clearly:

“‘She wants a divorce, Cal,’ he told me. ‘Says she’s done with living alone. Says I can’t be married to her and the restaurant. She just doesn’t understand.’”

“And what did you say?” interrupted Jack.

“I didn’t know what to say. At this point, I had known him for less than a year. I knew he was running a destructive lifestyle, but didn’t know it had come to this.

“‘Kip,’ I said, ‘Take a few days off--the restaurant will be fine. Give her some space, but take time to talk with her, to hear her out. Try to listen, Kip. I’ll be up the day after tomorrow and I’m bringing Carl with me, okay? We’re here for you, man.’

“So we did. We had no clue what to tell him, but we knew he had to change his lifestyle, especially if he wanted to save his marriage, but even if he wanted to save his business.

“He kept telling us starting a business was so hard and grueling but he loved it. It was what kept him going. ‘The hardest part,’ he told us, was his personal life. He said the people closest to him had become the least supportive, especially his wife. He claimed they had been fighting every day.” 

The old man’s eyes began to fill with tears as he retold his friend’s story.

“Then he asked a question which confirmed all my fears about his mindset. ‘How can I survive without my work? My career?’” 

The old man paused and shook his head.

“‘How can I survive without my work,’ Jack, that’s what he said to us. He wasn’t asking ‘How can I survive without my wife? How can I survive without sleep? How can I survive with this crazy, unsustainable schedule? He valued his work not only more than his wife--the woman he once loved more than anything else, the person who was supposed to be his *partner* in life--but valued it even above his own health well-being\!”

“We listened, we questioned, we tried to understand his situation. This struggle was obviously tearing him apart. Not only was he lacking the support only those closest can give, but he was experiencing rejection, in place of it. And all of it was only driving him to work *harder*.

“Carl finally worked up the courage to confront the real issue head on. I was too worried about hurting Kip’s feelings, but we both agreed: The guy’s work ethic was destroying his family and possibly his career.

“‘Kip, you’ve got to slow down,’ Carl insisted. ‘You’re destroying yourself.’ 

“I still remember Kip’s confused look as he tried to process what Carl was saying.

“‘But my business needs me. I can’t afford to slow down\!’ he said.

“‘You ‘can’t afford’ this plateau you’re in, either. You ‘can’t afford’ to lose your soulmate. You ‘can’t afford’ to micromanage your employees.

“‘You can’t afford not to slow down. Most of this stuff you're doing, isn’t worth your time.’

“‘Well, someone has to do it\!’ he threw back.” 

Jack’s mentor paused, before saying, with a wink, “Sounds familiar.”

The younger man grimaced and rolled his eyes.

The old man continued his story.

“We agreed with Kip that someone had to do it. ‘But it shouldn’t be you,’ Carl said. ‘You’re the leader. You are the vision and soul of the restaurant. You spearhead the way; you set the course; you call the shots.’ Then we asked him what we ask everyone business owner: Why did start the restaurant to begin with.

“‘Because I love making delicious food and making people happy,’ he replied. And getting paid to do it wasn’t too bad, either, of course.

“Carl told him he should be spending most of his time on just that: Creating delicious meals, delighting customers with a quality experience, and finding new and better ways to do it.

“That’s when I piped in,” the old man explained. “I told Kip, ‘Your job is to move the business forward and upward. That’s where your time is most profitable. Don’t throw it away on minimum wage chores.’

“I could see the lightbulb beginning to flicker.”

“‘And you must take care of your allies: your wife and those closest to you. They’re your lifesavers. If you create an incredible business, but destroy your family by your crazy hours and lifestyle, you haven’t succeeded at anything.’”

“Kip pondered it all for a long moment. I could sense the internal battle raging inside him. Everything he lived for, everything that gave him a will and drive to live was wrapped up in his business.

The old man looked at Jack. 

“You can you relate, can’t ya?” he stated.

“It sounds a lot like me, actually,” Jack admitted despite his pride.

Silence enveloped the narrative and they sat quietly for a moment. Jack tried to process everything the old man had just told him.

“It just doesn’t sound right,” he finally said. “*‘Work fewer hours, get more done.’”*

“Goes against everything you thought you knew, doesn’t it?” the old man agreed.

“There’s a rule, for this,” Jack’s mentor continued, “I think they call it the eighty-twenty rule these days, or something like that. Perhaps you’ve heard of it? This rule tells us all kinds of things we need to know about life and business. But the issue at hand is *time*. What do you spend your time doing?” he asked.

“How do you mean?” Jack asked.

“In any way. All day, every day what do you do?”

“I mean--I wake up, eat breakfast, and try to be at work at least by six o’clock every morning, if not sooner. We open the garage at eight, so I have plenty of time to work on paperwork or any vehicles before customers start arriving.”

“How much time do you spend on paperwork?”

“Couple hours a day in total maybe.”

“And, is that why you opened a mechanic shop?”

“No, of course it’s not.”

“Is it important for *you* to do all the paperwork or can anybody do paperwork?”

“I guess just about anyone…” Jack consented.

“Good. Anyways, continue explaining your routine. Do you ever do errands, like running for tools or parts--that kind of thing?”

“Often throughout the day or on my home from work, yeah, I’ll pick something up.”

“When customers drive into *‘Jack’s* Auto Repair,’ who do you think they expect to meet?” the old man questioned.

“Well, me--”

“JACK\!” his mentor interrupted. “They expect to meet Jack. But are they going to meet Jack if he’s off running to AutoZone for another carton of oil?”

“We--we buy it in bulk,” Jack corrected. 

The old man waved it off with a chuckle, “Whatever you get at AutoZone then. Doesn’t matter. What does matter is that your customers meet Jack at ‘Jack’s Auto Repair.’ It’s important they find the trustworthy guy running the place and have confidence he’s the one working or at least watching over those working on their car. It doesn’t matter who runs after errands, does it?”

“Well, sometimes we have to find particularly unique parts.”

“But that's not hard. You can train the other guys to do that pretty well, can’t you?

He didn’t wait for an answer, but continued on, “Here’s the thing, Jack. Spend your precious time working on stuff that drives your business forward: Interact with the customers to build trust. Work on their cars and do a good job so they keep coming back. Find ways to get them talking about your shop in better light than the next guy’s shop. Train the other employees to be five-star mechanics. And stop messing around doing odd jobs any of your men could do. Hire a secretary, assign one of the guys to be an errand-boy--do stuff to lighten your load.

“Is this making sense, son? The idea is to make a lifelong habit of letting go of the ‘low value’ things. Focus on doing things only you can do to drive the business forward. Leave the rest for your employees. That’s why you hired them. Kip learned most of the stuff he was working long hours to get done could have been done by someone else. So why put in ridiculous hours when you could be spending more time with your wife and kids and spending time doing stuff that actually grows your business?”

The old man leaned in as he finished up his little speech.

Jack rotated a leftover piece of toast from breakfast and sat in silence. The old man waited patiently for him to process everything. 

“So that’s how Kip learned to work only three days a week?” he asked the old man.

“Yup, by doing the stuff only he could do and having others do the rest.”

Jack watched a couple of sparrows swoop in to pick up the crumbs scattered by the men that morning. The eight o’clock sun penetrated the previously shadowy atmosphere and began to warm them as they sat silent.

*“Slow down, work fewer hours, maximize whatever makes you most productive…”* 

This was a hard turn for Jack to make. Everything he thought he had learned from years of running his own business--let alone the training he had gotten in college--was wrong, it turned out.

He looked up at his old mentor: Did this man know what he was talking about? Or were these just mere opinions he was reading into his experience?

“What happened then?” he asked the old man.

“To what?” the man grunted in reply.

“To Kip. Did he change?”

“Kip?” he said perking up. “It was hard. He didn’t change overnight. He was addicted to his work, you know. Most people can’t kick their addictions overnight. But eventually, he changed. And it probably saved his life and his business. Unfortunately, it was too late to save his marriage. She was hurt, angry, and fed up, so she packed her bags and left.”

“Is she still around?”

“They maintained a civil relationship--for the sake of the kids, mostly. But she remarried and seems to have had a happy life until she passed away about ten years ago.”

“Did Kip ever remarry?”

“Nope. No, he loved only Olivia, deep in his heart. He just didn’t realize it until it was too late. He had been too busy to realize she no longer loved him.”

JACK THOUGHT of Kip and Olivia the entire ride home and the entire way through the house and into his room.

The *“do the things only you can do; hire others to do the rest,”* part made sense to him.

But Kips words haunted him, *‘How can I survive without my work?’*

*“How do I survive*?” Jack wondered.

He had spent so many years believing he would be a failure if he didn’t make his business profitable. He couldn’t imagine thinking any other way. As small as it was, mechanics was his life.

But what did the old man know? He wasn’t a businessman. What gave him the right to make such strong assertions about how Jack should run his business.

It was late afternoon now. Jack began his evening jog by walking vigorously down the driveway from his house. Getting outside and exercising always cleared his mind.

He hurried his pace and broke into a jog. His heart fluttered a little as he caught sight of Riley walking up to the house from working in the garden. He always thought she was especially cute in work clothes.

Saving his family was a no-brainer. Of course he wanted that. Only an idiot would decisively choose to hurt his family.

But would working long hours to build a successful business really tear them apart?

*“Stop running errands to AutoZone. Instead, do the stuff only you can do to drive your business forward.”*

*“Let go of doing ‘low-value’ activities yourself. This will free your time, and more importantly, free your focus from needing to remember all the little details.”*

Jack broke into a run down the street, eyes narrowed in on the path in front of him. He didn’t even notice the new neighbor waving from his riding lawn mower. He didn’t notice his own kids playing with the Garcia children across the street. He was completely lost in thought.

“HELLO\! ANYBODY home?” Riley asked her husband, now sitting on the porch stairs.

“I’m sorry. What did you say?” Jack said, emerging from his thoughts.

“What were you thinking about?”

“Oh, just my conversation with Cal,” he wiped the sweat off his brow. “What did you want?”

“I was wondering if, at some point, you could help me in the garden. I need that old fence stake pulled out.” his wife repeated.

“Oh.” Jack thought for a moment. “I mean, yeah, I guess I can do that. I don’t know when, but I can help you out.” 

He knew it wasn’t the right answer. But he didn’t feel up to a cheerful *“Yes\! I’d be happy to.”* He had plenty on his mind already. This silly fence stake surely wasn’t more important than any of the other tasks calling his name.

“Well, if you don’t have time to help me, don’t worry about it.” She stood, obviously hurt, and walked into the house.

The roar of a mower and the sound of his children playing with the neighbor kids wafted across the yard. It was a peaceful late summer evening outside.

But inside Jack Martin a different sound filled the air, like the cries a diseased city on fire rather than a peaceful summer’s eve. Jack clenched his fist shut, as if to grasp an invisible foe.

*“YET ANOTHER FAILURE\!”* the thoughts screamed. *“Oh, she hates you even more, now.”*

*“She doesn’t understand what I’m going through,”* he thought to himself. *“She doesn’t understand the pressure.”*

The faint gurgle of boiling water came from the silent kitchen. 

“Riley\!” he called out. “Something’s on the stove\!”

No answer.

His mentor’s words rang in his ear, *“How much is your family worth it to you?”*

He knew he was acting in the wrong. He knew Cal was right. He knew he should apologize. Again. But humble pie is especially hard to swallow twice.

In the long run, she was more important than his business and most certainly more important than his pride. In the long run.

But not at the moment.

**Chapter 5: The Third Meeting**  
***“My problems are unique--people don’t truly understand.”***

*“GOOD-BYE kids\! See you next month\!” Mr. Young said to his students as they ran out the door. Only a few responded “Goodbye\!” None said “Thank-you\!” Most didn’t even acknowledge his presence.*

*The first year teacher shut the door and sank down into his chair, exasperated from the long, strenuous week and month and year. He could still hear the rush of students running out the front entrance, voices cheering for the holidays, feet stomping down the hall, doors slamming shut.* 

*Mr. Young wondered whether a career in teaching had been a mistake. So far it had been miserable. He went over the day, trying to figure out what he could have done better. How he could have calmed the unruly fourth grade men vying for leadership. Encouraging giggles from girls were evidently much higher priorities for nine and ten year old boys than the history lesson or its teacher.*

*But, no matter, the Christmas season had arrived, which meant a two-and-a-half week break before he would have to again compete for the attention of the little fourth grade warriors and giggling queens.* 

*The young teacher closed his eyes as the noise from the halls quieted. He sighed with relief at the thought of two weeks home alone with his own Queen. And tomorrow, he would join his comrades for one last Mastermind before the break. That was good. He enjoyed getting together with his new business friends. He liked the perspective they brought to his life and fledgling career, even though sharing his struggles always scared him. Perhaps they could help him solve this fourth-grade riddle.*

“MORNING, JACK\!” the old man exclaimed at the arrival of his friend.

Jack stopped furrowed his brow and stared at the empty table. Since he was usually the last one to arrive, it confused him why his old friend sat alone around their table. 

“Where’s everybody else?” he inquired.

“They all had other things going, so I guess it’s just you and me today.”

“Okay,” Jack said with an amused grin. “Fine with me. So what are we talking about this morning?”

“Your friends\!” the old man said with an extra chipperness in his voice.

“My friends? What about my friends?”

“Can you talk to them?”

“Well, I talk to you, don’t I?” Jack threw back.

The old man chuckled, “Oh, mercy, what a boring life you must lead\!”

Jack grinned to himself as he looked over the menu.

“No, I mean your peers--people young enough to still be doing life and business--your friends who *didn’t* watch the moon landing. Are you able to talk to them about stuff?”

“Yeah, I talk to them, I guess.”

“He guesses,” the old man humphed to the waitress just walking up.

“I’ll have my usual, Connie,” he told the waitress. “And you’re paying,” he informed the younger man.

“Oh, really now?” Jack raised his eyebrows in mock surprise.

They finished ordering and continued their conversation.

“You have to understand: I don’t know very many people who face the same kind of problems that I do,” Jack confessed. “Nobody will understand anyway, so how could it be helpful to share my struggles.”

“How do you know no one will understand? Have you tried?”

Jack thought for a while.

“It’s just--a lot of the people at church don’t know what it takes to run a repair shop. My neighbors don’t talk to each other, so I don’t really know them. And most of my business friends don’t understand why I value church, or family, or people like you,” Jack pointed at his friend with a chuckle. The old man laughed heartily.

“Most people don’t understand people like me,” he said. “I’m used to it by now.”

Connie the waitress set their drinks in front of them.

“But have you ever actually taken them out for coffee and shared your stories and struggles and listened to theirs?” the old man asked.

Jack shrugged, “I guess not.”

“You might be surprised who actually does understand you. That’s what happened with Trev.”

“Trev from your group? I was wondering when we’d get to him.”

“Yup. When he first started coming, it scared him out of his mind to share his struggles.”

Jack nodded in agreement, “No kidding.”

“Trev was struggling with a problem that really had him down. Barely four months into his teaching career, he already felt burned out and at his wits end. He even questioned whether teaching was really for him.

“He had hesitated to share his struggles all fall because it embarrassed him to be so helpless in solving a problem he should have been able to fix--as a trained teacher and all.

“But the thing that really got him down was a nagging doubt whether he had chosen the right career. Imagine it, he questioned a choice which had affected the last four-and-a-half years of his life. It embarrassed him, I think.

“Finally, having tried everything for an entire semester, he determined to bring up both his problem and his restlessness at our final meeting before Christmas. He was still working up the courage to spill all his guts when Carl told us a story from the cockpit. Of all people, it connected with Trev.”

*“DID I ever tell you how I learned to manage my energy during long commercial flights?” the pilot asked.*

*The young teacher leaned in. He had determined to share everything with this group of wise men: his embarrassingly small problem of keeping the attention of fourth-grade students. He also decided, at the strong encouragement of his wife, to share his regret over becoming a teacher.*

*But at this point, it relieved him to have a few extra moments of reprieve while the pilot, Carl, recounted one of his many stories. Sharing always terrified him. None of these guys were teachers: how could they understand his problem? Besides, they were all smart and experienced. It embarrassed him to admit struggling over an issue for so long with so little results.*

*“So, I struggled to keep my energy levels up for many years after becoming a commercial pilot,” Carl was saying. “I didn’t face it as much during the war, so I didn’t know how to deal with it.*

*“One flight to London was especially bad. I was drinking coffee and peeing so much, that the attendants started giggling every time I left the cockpit. You can imagine how my co-pilot made fun of me\!*

*“From that point on, I began searching for a solution to my problem. Airlines didn’t have a lot of protocol when it came to this kind of stuff back then, so I had to figure it out on my own.*

*“I started by cutting out all television in the evenings before my flights. At first, I cut it out every other flight and I would record how I slept the night I watched television versus the night I didn’t. And I logged how I felt throughout the following flight and so on. I kept track like this for several months and began noticing a subtle difference.*

*“The nights I watched television, it took me longer to settle down and fall asleep. Subsequently, it took me longer to wake up the next morning as well. The days and flights following were groggier in general--not significantly, but when I noticed them week after week in my journal, there was definitely a pattern.*

*“After I concluded not watching television improved my sleep, I tried two other things which especially improved my energy during long flights.*

*“I started avoiding newspapers the morning of my flight, and instead spent that time either exercising or reading to relax my brain instead of working it.*

*“I began eating nutrient rich meals before hand: lots of meat, vegetables, and fruits. I also made sure to snack well during the flight, instead of drinking soda and coffee, I began drinking primarily water and healthy snacks.*

*“No more dozing off during those long flights after that. I slept like a rock at night, too.” Carl concluded the story and the meeting moved on.* 

*Listening to Carl explain what he learned about managing his energy, Trev suddenly had an idea about how to help his kids stay engaged in his class.*

*Perhaps their problem wasn’t that his lessons weren’t engaging enough (which certainly may have been part of it). Perhaps their problem was pent up energy mixed with tiredness keeping their minds from being focused.* 

*He could chalk it up to being merely fourth-grade antics. But perhaps a lack of proper exercise, fresh-air, restful sleep combined with fourth-grade restlessness, rendered their minds incapable of focusing on learning.* 

*“Their minds are tired but their bodies energetic,” Trev thought to himself.*

“SUDDENLY, OUR young teacher felt a new energy and vigor for his class and career he hadn’t previously known. He now had a theory that could possibly not only resolve his frustration, but actually *help* the children and their parents,” the old man explained.

“How did he do it?” Jack asked.

“He started with television, figuring it to be the primary problem among his kids. He thought getting that out of the way should be his first priority.

“So here’s what he did. Each kid who could verify they hadn’t watched any T.V. or ninetendo the previous night went home with no homework.”

Jack’s mouth dropped open, “No homework?\!” he exclaimed.

“With no homework. He figured attention in class was more important than whatever more they’d learn through homework. Furthermore, if they could prove from friends or family that they spent significant time playing or working outside, they received extra credit. He verified this by signed papers from parents along with testimonies from friends--that kind of thing.

“He found this worked quite effectively with most of the kids. Of course there were the couch potatoes who liked their T.V., but even they usually found it hard to turn down a chance to skip  homework.

“He also petitioned the school to provide healthier but tasty meals, which proved harder than he anticipated. In the end, though, they saw the value and tried his experiment. He made nutritious snacks a routine part of the classroom. He fostered all of these new measures by giving incentives such as no homework, extra field trips, free days, and the like.

“It’s amazingly simple, but expelling the pent-up restlessness by encouraging physical exercise helped all of them, especially the couch potatoes, to have dramatically better attention spans. They improved even to the point that kids who had been failing, started getting C’s. Along with this, the students were much more responsive to his attempts at reining them in--even when the girls were giggling at the boy’s.

“Wow\!” Jack exclaimed. “That’s quite cutting edge for--when was this, the eighties?”

“Yes, it was,” the old man agreed. “But Trev was only interested in helping the kids.

The breakfast arrived and the two men set to work consuming the food.

“But the thing I wanted to point out to you today was not how smart or cutting edge Trev was,” the old man went on. “You say, Jack, people can’t understand your problems. Your problems are too unique. But who’s more different from each other than a teacher and an airline pilot?”

“You wouldn’t think they could learn from each other,” Jack agreed, taking a bite out of his toast.

“No, you wouldn’t. Yet a random story from the cockpit spawned an incredible breakthrough for a *teacher*. Never underestimate the experiences of your friends and peers, Jack. You never know who you might learn from. Who knows, you might even learn about your business from me\!” the old man chuckled as he dove into his eggs and hashbrowns.

The old man continued speaking, despite the food in his mouth. “Trev’s school became one of the most successful in developing healthy and smart students as a direct result of his initiatives. Grades went up while the amount of time spent in detention and suspensions went down. Trev was a good fifteen years ahead of himself and is now an award winning teacher.” 

Wiping the corners of his mouth, the old mentor looked at Jack and grinning said, “It was all because he involved himself in a strong community of thinkers and doers.”

“Speaking of doing,” Jack said. “I need you to come help me remove a stake tonight.”

“Oh?” the older man said, interested. “And you want the old buffer to come throw his back out?”

“No, I need strong community to give me moral support while I sweat my brains out,” Jack said with a twinkle. “Besides, it’s been awhile since you were at our place for dinner. It’s time you come over again.”

“I’d love to\!”

“STRONG COMMUNITY,” Jack stated through heavy breaths. “You’ve mentioned it several times now.”

“Yup,” the old man grunted as he shoveled dirt away from the stake.

“What is it?” Jack asked.

“It’s all the stuff,” his mentor said. “Everything we’ve been talking about the last few weeks. It’s your friends, the people you go on the adventure of life with, your family, your wife.”

The old man paused, noticing Jack’s hesitation at the mention of his wife.

He leaned on his shovel and asked, “Somethin’ wrong between you and Riley?”

“Ah, it’s nothing,” Jack said, wiping the sweat from his forehead, making it even dirtier.

His mentor raised an eyebrow, “That’s what they all say.”

Jack began heaving at the stubborn stake again.

“Why do you have this stupid stake in here anyways?” the old man asked as he continued his shoveling.

“I don’t even remember,” Jack said. Grunting, he pushed and pulled the stake around and around to loosen it. 

“All I know is that,” he paused, pulling with all his might. The stake suddenly broke loose, sending him off-balance and right onto his rear. “It’s a pain in the ass,” he finished.

Jack’s mentor doubled over with laughter.

“So hilarious,” Jack groaned as he sat in the dirt. “My tailbone is gonna be sore for days.”

“Pain is just weakness leaving the body,” the old man said, giving Jack a hand up. “At least, that’s what your mom said when she gave you birth.”

They both laughed. It felt freeing for Jack to laugh.

After they were done chuckling over their jokes, they grabbed the newly uprooted stake and started back toward the house. 

For the first time in a long time, Jack started to feel hopeful. If a school teacher could take a fighter pilot’s tales and calm a room of rowdy kids, maybe there was hope for him to get out of this mess. 

Sensing his hope, the elder put his hand on Jack’s shoulder, and said, “Making Riley happy and content is your most important responsibility. She’s your lifesaver, Jack. Don’t neglect her.”

**Chapter 6: The Fourth Meeting**  
***“If I don’t take responsibility, nobody else will”***

THE THOUGHTS still plague Jack. The fire still rages wildly through the streets of his soul. Fate, it seems, gives an unbearable load to the already downtrodden. 

But history reminds us of hope.

It was the fire that saved London from plague.

“BEEP\! BEEP\!”

Jack opened his eyes and shook his head, confused. He tried to make sense of where he was, what the noise was that blared and why it was going on-and-on.

“BEEP\! BEEP\! BEEP\!” it continued.

Then his head cleared and it all suddenly made sense again. His eyes focused on the bright red numbers on the clock: *6:31 am*.

Shocked, Jack leaped out from under his covers. He bounded over to the closet, ripped out a pair of work clothes and began pulling them on, hopping around the room like a freshman late for the first day of high school.

Riley rolled over and looked at her husband running about.

“What’s the big rush?” she moaned, squinting at the light floating in from their master bathroom.

“I’m late for work\!” Jack responded, impatiently, knowing deep down it was not her fault.

Jack reached for the bedroom door knob, planning to head straight for the garage and skip breakfast. But as he swung the door open, he stopped.

*“You have to start working fewer hours.”* 

His mentor’s words echoed from their conversation the previous morning. 

*“Why are you still spending long hours processing all that paperwork, Jack?”* 

*“I guess anyone can do it…”* he had agreed. 

“But will anyone step up? Anyone can do it, but will they?” he thought to himself.

*“Take care of your wife... If you create an incredible business, but destroy your family, you haven’t succeeded at anything.”*

He looked back at his wife who had fallen asleep again.

*“She’s your lifesaver.”*

Jack quietly closed the door behind him as he cautiously made his way down the hall, realizing that his commotion might wake up the entire house.

Suddenly, his perspective shifted.

*“How could I be so blind?”* he thought. *“If I lose Riley and the kids, what is my business worth?”* 

He made his way down the stairs, walking like he had all-day now. He stopped at the kitchen entry, thinking, considering, confused as to how to proceed with this change in perspective.

And then he knew and he immediately set to work. He did have all day. Work could wait, but his family wouldn’t.

“Who am I helping if I can’t even help them?” he whispered to no one.

Jack found he suddenly had new vigor and energy for the day. Flinging open the cupboard doors, he grabbed a pan and a spatula. He swiveled around on his heel and grabbed the last three slices of bacon from the fridge. Turned on the stove, laid the bacon in the frying pan, and listened for the sizzle.

He rushed--almost leaped--to the other side of the kitchen again and grabbed the coffee but stopped. It had been so long since he’d made coffee, he couldn’t remember what ratios to use.

Just then he heard a stir from around the corner. He looked back to see his daughter Emma watching him, looking perplexed.

“Emma\! You’re just who I need\!” he exclaimed. “How much coffee do I need to make two cups?”

“Just two cups?” she asked, even more perplexed.

“Like, two mugs--for two people\! How much water and coffee do I need to make some for two people?”

“Well,” she said, assuming a master’s persona. “If you’re going to make this much coffee”--she pointed at the 4-cup line on the pot--“you’ll need this many scoops of grounds,” she explained as she put 5 tablespoons of coffee grounds into the maker.

“That’s how much Mom puts in. She says Grandma’s is always weak and that she doesn’t like Grandma’s coffee.”

Jack smiled down at his intelligent daughter. What a gift she was.

“Thanks, hun,” he said before a sizzling reminded him he had bacon on the stove. He rushed over to move it to the paper towels he had prepared.

“What’s all this?” Riley’s voice came floating through the entryway as she strolled, yawning, into the kitchen.

“Breakfast, can’t you see?” Jack replied happily as he split an egg into the bacon lathered frying pan.

“Jack Martin making breakfast? Surely not,” Riley joked, squinting her eyes a little.

Jack put his arm around his wife and kissed her. Emma rolled her eyes and left, groaning.

“I’m sorry for being caught in my own little world,” he said. “Cal has been helping me see how flawed my thinking has been. I can’t keep going like this. I’ve got to slow down.”

Riley looked up, admiration flowing from her eyes to his. She grinned as he talked.

“I really am sorry about all I’ve missed,” he continued. “Jimmy’s ball games and Emma’s recitals--I almost missed the church banquet the other week. Not to mention all the times we could’ve had together, but didn’t.”

Jack’s soul began to fill with a new enthusiasm for life and for his family. His heart overflowed with love for Riley. Yes, it felt right. This was the right track for him to follow.

“So, I thought making breakfast for the two of us was the least I could do to show my love and gratitude before work,” he said, kissing her again.

“Jack,” Riley said looking into his eyes, again with a grin.

“What?”

“It’s Saturday.”

JACK RAN across the park lawn, laughing along with his kids. 

The sun shone warm in the late morning sky. The trees burst with a summer breeze that rustled the branches and sent loose leaves fluttering to the ground. Fall was approaching, which pleased the autumn loving mechanic, but it disappointed him that all three of his kids would soon be going to school.

He was glad he had taken the time to spend with his family instead of going into the shop and working on the odd stuff left over from the week.

He looked over to his wife who sipped a latte on a nearby park bench. Beside her sat his old mentor. They were laughing as Jack goofed off with his delighted children. Though he was still troubled by the plateau he felt at his shop, his heart was full again after a very long vacancy.

Perhaps there was hope.

“It’s good to see you haven’t forgotten your fun side,” his old friend bellowed as Jack approached, heaving from all the running. “Though you look a bit out of shape\!” The man grinned broadly.

“I’d like to see *you* keep up with them\!” Jack shot back giving out a long sigh. They laughed.

Riley got up to take the children home.

“So, you decided to take me seriously, huh? Work less. Care for your family. Do things only you can do?”

“Yeah, I guess so. Thanks for talking straight to me.” Jack said. “Hey, you up for a walk?”

“Why sure, if it’s not too far. I’m an old man, ya know.”

“There’s a cafe just up the street.”

“Well, then, by all means.”

“I AM liking the idea of working less,” Jack explained to his old friend as they walked along. “But I have this gnawing fear that if I don’t take responsibility for things, nobody else will.”

Jack looked at his mentor beside him. The old man walked methodically, breathing slowly in and out--like a trained athlete. 

Jack wondered what wealth of wisdom and experience the man held untapped beneath that old gray frame.

“Many entrepreneurs feel the same way, Jack,” the old man finally replied. “Especially entrepreneurs of your type. You’re not alone. Be encouraged.”

Jack paused, waiting for the old man to continue, who just kept walking and breathing.

The old man looked up and then over at Jack.

“What?” he said, replying to Jack’s expectant gaze.

“I just thought you’d have a story about this or something.”

“Oh, I suppose I do. But you don’t want to be bored by that on a Saturday,” the old man brushed it aside. “You only promised to give me two hours a week, remember?” He smiled broadly.

“I’ve got all day,” Jack laughed.

“Well, then, I’ll tell you about Charlie.”

“AS YOU know, Charlie is a lifelong rancher,” the old man began.

Jack nodded, remembering some of the rancher’s recent projects mentioned over breakfast.

“The astounding thing about Charlie”--he drew each word out in his deep, radio bass--“is that by the time he turned everything over to his son, he didn’t work much over 30 hours a week, if my memory serves me correctly. And it wasn’t because he was lazy.”

Jack stopped in his tracks and looked at his mentor, incredulous.

“He’s a rancher\! How could he do that?”

“Hold your horses, son\!” The man said holding up his hands before putting them behind his back and continuing his slow stroll. “That’s the story I’m about to tell you.”

He continued, “Charlie is the literal definition of a work horse, like Kip, only more horse and less puppy than Kip is. Has been ever since I first met him.”

“Where did you meet him?” Jack inquired.

“Tucson. It was a Saturday morning. He was making a quick trip down just to deliver an old bull and a couple of heifers he had sold. That was Charlie. Always runnin’ over time on the smallest things.

“I met him at a diner Kip had recommended to me. We soon discovered we were both visiting from Colorado, so we struck up a friendship.

“Amy and I once took him up on an invitation to visit the ranch. It was spring of ’81, I believe, and the place was just splendid. I mean, rugged, fresh, wild, beauty. We stayed in a little cottage they had up in the hills, couple hundred yards from the ranch house.

“Anyways, like I said, Charlie worked hard and took serious responsibility of his life, his home, and especially his ranch.

“This is obviously a great trait for a businessman and a leader--to take responsibility. But like they say, your greatest strength is often your greatest weakness. It was hard for Charlie to keep employees for more than a year or two because he never developed them to their full potential.”

“How do you mean?” Jack asked.

“Well, take for instance those three cows he brought down to Tucson when I met him.”

“Yeah?”

“Charlie didn’t have any other business down there. His only purpose was to sell those cows. An experienced ranch hand could’ve easily done that. Instead, the head rancher himself took time out of his busy schedule to travel over ten hours just to sell a few cows.”

The men arrived at the cafe and sat down after they had ordered their drinks.

“Okay, so you’re saying Charlie should have had a ranch hand take care of transporting the cattle?”

“Yes, but not just any hand. Someone he had trained for the job,” the old man replied. “Obviously you don’t just let any inexperienced joe take the cattle into their own hands. Of course they must be licensed to drive truck. But even beyond that, Charlie should’ve--and he eventually learned this--taken one of his ranch hands aside and taught him how to transport livestock, interact with customers and buyers, and all that.

“Ownership,” Jack’s mentor growled the word out like an old time preacher. “As an employer--or as any type of leader--you want those under you to take ownership of their jobs. And that first and foremost begins with the leader.”

“If a leader is always telling people what to do or, worse yet, doing them himself, they won’t take ownership.”

The old man paused as he took a sip of coffee.

“You want the floor sweeper to take *ownership* of the cleanliness of the floor. That floor is his. If he doesn’t sweep it, nobody will. He should take pride in it.

“Or, on the ranch, you want a ranch hand to take ownership of his job, whether that’s maintaining the place, transporting livestock, or wrangling horses. Let me give you another example from Charlie,” the old man interrupted himself.

“So if a ranch uses horses to do work, they need what is called a wrangler, right?” Jack nodded, pretending to know. “This man is in charge--or should be--of all horse-related activities, which includes breeding and training--stuff like that.

“Well, in the early days of the ranch, Charlie hired a supposed ‘wrangler’ so he could tend to other, more important ranch oversight, business strategy, and whatnot. 

“After a while, Charlie wanted the guy to start training one of their colts. So he says to him, ‘Lenny, this horse has known you since birth. You have gained the necessary experience, now I want you to halter train it.’

“And so Charlie goes about his business for a couple days--even went on a trip out of state. When he came back, what do you know but the colt still wasn’t trained. He found the thing wandering around and unapproachable in the yard with a halter and loose rope dangling from its neck. 

“Boy, was Charlie unhappy. He stormed off in a sweat and searched the ranch high and low until he found that wrangler in the stable cleaning stalls and organizing equipment. It was all Charlie could do to not wrangle the wrangler\! In a mad huff, Charlie fired him on the spot.”

“Without any explanation?” Jack asked.

“Not a word of explanation--from either one of them: from the wrangler as to why he hadn’t trained the colt nor from Charlie as to why he fired the poor guy.”

“Ouch. That’s harsh.”

“Sure was\!” Swirling his coffee, the old man crossed his legs and leaned back in his chair. “After that, Charlie was a little gun-shy of negligent employees. If he was afraid something wasn’t going to get done, instead of working with his employees and empowering them to take ownership, he just did it himself. Hence, why he ran into a traveling man and his wife at a diner just outside of Tucson, Arizona.” The old man chuckled pointing at himself.

After draining his drink, the old man leaned forward, slapped the table and said “Well, where shall we go now?”

Stifling a chuckle, Jack exclaimed, “I thought you were old and didn’t want to walk very far?”

“Well, whatever that ex-pres-o stuff was you ordered me has me roaring to go\!” He slapped the table again and gave a hearty laugh.

“We can go back to the house or walk over to the shop, I suppose,” Jack suggested.

“Where you lead, I will follow\!”

“So, how did Charlie get his work week down to thirty hours?” Jack asked, leading the way.

“Really, at the core he had to learn the same principles as Kip did, which was to focus on doing what only he could. But there were different reasons behind why they were distracted with the little stuff.

“For Kip, his work was his drug, so he just did anything and everything, wasting away his energy and his family. Charlie, however, was simply afraid nothing would get done if he didn’t make it happen. A bad experience skewed his perspective.

“On one hand, it is the employer’s job to nurture an environment where employees take ownership. On the other hand, there are ‘just-tell-me-what-to-do’ employees out there who are too passive to take ownership. You have to weed those out during the hiring process. In any case, the responsibility does lean ultimately on the boss.”

The old man slowed down, apparently remembering his age, despite the influx of caffeine. Jack grinned to himself. It felt good to do casual things with his old mentor again.

“By the time I really got to know Charlie, Kip had been meeting with Carl and I for several years already. So we invited him to join us because we thought he would bring a lot to the table and figured we had a lot to offer him in return.

“As he shared about his business and the barriers he kept coming up against, it became obvious to us that he had become an obsessive micromanager. Because Kip had a similar experience, he spoke directly into Charlie’s situation and lifestyle, pointing out how he had to loosen his grip on the ranch and let his employees take ownership--like we’ve been talking about.

“Not surprisingly, the first two moves he made were to hire and train a self-motivated and creative wrangler as well as a driver who could transport livestock and execute business deals. Those two things in themselves relieved a lot of stress and time off his shoulders. This freed him to work on moving the ranch forward, exploring new ventures with breeding and feeding and whatever other ways ranchers innovate when they finally have time.”

The old man smiled as he concluded the story.

“So, ‘*Do what only you can do*,’ again,” Jack summarized, “and ‘*empower ownership*.’

“Exactly right,” the old man agreed. “If you execute those two concepts, your productivity will drastically increase.”

**Chapter 7: The Fifth Meeting**  
***“If people get close and see what’s really going on, they won’t appreciate me anymore”***

CARS WHIZZED passed Jack as he made his way from the cafe on Lewis Street. He shoved his hands deeper into his pockets to escape the crisp morning air preluding autumn’s arrival. The cold energized Jack and he even whistled as he mulled over his recent conversations with his mentor.

He was beginning to see the value of the masterminds or “doing business in strong community,” as the old man put it. It bothered Jack how many misconceptions he had blindly believed about business, even after six years of doing it himself\!

Jack fiddled with the coins in his pocket, trying to keep his hands out of the breeze. The expense of joining a local mastermind didn’t bother him now. If the success of these men was due at all to the support and feedback of the group, he wanted it too, even if it cost him. 

His only hang-up was the sharing. No matter how much sense it made, the idea of sharing his deep struggles with peers didn’t seem any easier than before. Talking to his mentor, putting his family first--he was getting used to all of that. But sharing openly with other men his age seemed humiliating.

He stopped on the edge of the sidewalk and pushed the button to use the crosswalk.

“Hey Jack, good mornin’\!” a voice called from behind him. He recognized Charlie’s western twang immediately. “You meet with Cal this mornin’?” he said, strolling up beside Jack.

“Yeah I did,” Jack said. “I never realized how much experience he has. He’s learned a lot through you guys.”

“He sure is wise. How’s it going for ya?” Charlie asked.

“Good\!” Jack replied.

Charlie grinned down at the younger man, arms on his hips as if waiting expectantly for something more.

Jack returned Charlie’s gaze, flattening his lips and nodding his head, unsure how to handle the silence.

“Good?” Charlie repeated. “In what way?”

Jack fumbled for the words. “Well, like I said, I’ve learned a lot.” He felt the butterflies in his stomach begin their less-than-synchronized flying.”

Charlie kept grinning. “How are things going, really?”

Jack could feel his palms start to sweat. His heartbeat quickened. He felt his face turn red and hoped the rancher hadn’t seen the embarrassment wash over him.

The pressure increased in his chest, twisting his stomach into knots, until finally it all bubbled over and came tumbling out in a rush of words and sweat and red cheeks. Jack felt like a fifth grader spilling his silly secrets to the teacher.

He explained the emotions he had pent up inside him. How every Thursday morning he felt like a kid at the adult table.

He told Charlie how it was embarrassing simply to share his struggles even to a kind, trusted old mentor. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like to share with his peers. 

“I’ve racked up substantial debt I’m *still* trying to pay off. I feel lost in leading my small team, even after six years\!” he vented. “I’m just a mechanic, Charlie. I’m totally out of place among men running companies in industries far more important and demanding than an auto-repair shop.” He sputtered the words, as if in disdain.

He stopped, realizing he had rambled for several minutes straight. He looked sheepishly at the older man. But Charlie didn’t laugh. He didn’t scold. He didn’t even look at his phone or fidget restlessly. He listened. He looked right into Jack’s eyes, nodding and smiling occasionally. Jack stood there uncomfortably folding and unfolding his arms.

“I guess I just feel like a naive schoolboy among them--you,” Jack concluded.

Taking his hat off and motioning for Jack to follow him, Charlie sat down on the curb. Jack felt a little conspicuous but followed the rancher’s lead and sat, suddenly cold. He noticed the crosswalk sign had turned red again.

Charlie stretched out his long legs into the street and smiled at Jack. “I love mornings like this,” he said, closing his eyes and letting the sun warm his face. Jack shivered. 

“You know what,” Charlie began, eyes still closed. “I felt the exact same way you do when I first started meetin’ with the group.” He shoved his thumb in the direction of the cafe behind them.

“Really?” Jack asked. “How so?”

“Well, imagine it. There I was, this rough-n-tumble, boots and hat wearing cowboy. And there they were, a successful multi-restaurant owner, a pilot, and, eventually, an educated teacher. Carl understands rough-n-tumble, being in the Air Force and all, but even he has been refined and educated into a professional pilot.” He spread his long arms out into a shrug. “What did I know about their businesses. And of all things, why would they care about my lowly ranch? But,” he said, “I found--and I’m sure you have, too--that they don’t give a damn if we fit their style or not.”

He paused, turning his hat around in his hands. “When I started sharing with the others about embarrassing obstacles or revenue losses on the ranch and saw them continue to respect me and not treat me less valuable to the group--I realized for the first time I possessed worth simply because I was a livin’, breathin’ human individual. Not because I was turning a large profit or because I was a dynamic leader--but simply because I lived and breathed.”

He absentmindedly shoved some gravel into the street with his leather boots.

“You know,” he said, “successful people are often the warmest and most welcoming people around. You know why I think that is?” He looked at Jack.

“Why?”

“Because almost all of them have been in our shoes. They are ‘failures’”--he lifted his fingers in quotes--“just like us. But they got back up, they pushed on, they sat at tables they didn’t belong at. Those crazy successful people are some of the most flawed, but it’s their flaws that helped them succeed. It’s okay not to be perfect and not have all the answers. Just learn from it and get back up again.”

Jack shifted his weight watching the crosswalk sign turn green for the third time.

“That makes sense,” he told the old rancher, letting out a long sighed.

“*Hhhuhh\!*” Charlie imitated Jack’s sigh. “What’s ‘*hhhuhh\!’* about?”

“Oh, I guess I still fear I’ll never be able to grow my business or make a profit.”

Charlie thought about it then said, “I worried about that, too. Which is why it was so good for me to be in this group and share my struggles. I talked constantly about my financial frustrations and how hard it was to turn a profit on a ranch. But eventually they helped me to let go of the need to generate results and focus on things that really mattered.”

Jack looked confused.

“Exactly\!” Charlie agreed. “I had the same reaction. But I discovered the more desperate I got to turn a profit, the more frustrated I and my guys were. Eventually, I learned to focus only on building healthy systems with my team, my finances, and my relationships. With healthy systems in place results come. Slowly, but eventually and with stability.

“It’s like this,” he said. “I don’t do much with crops, myself, but business is kind of like a farmer who plants a seed into the ground. He puts in place systems to plant, water, and tend the seed until harvest. Sometimes business is just a matter of plantin’ and waterin’ seeds, and waitin’ for them to grow. But that takes patience and a willin’ness to forgo short-term success for long-term sustainability and easy management.”

“So you did that on your ranch?” Jack asked. “You let go of the drive to turn a profit and instead set up systems?”

“Yeah, because you can work on systems and maintain them over the long haul--they’re sustainable. Whereas, when you’re just runnin’ around doing business by the seat of your pants tryin’ to make an immediate profit, you will eventually burn out your engine, as it were.”

“So, just like that you changed?” Jack asked.

“Well, it wasn’t on a dime. It was a slow process of learnin’ from the others and failin’--which proved to me they were right,” he said waving his arm in the direction of the cafe, again. “But learnin’ and failin’ wasn’t the worst of it. As I began to see the light, I had to do one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.”

“What was that?”

“I had to ask people close to me--these gentlemen and relatives--to lend me some money to get through the year--this was about six months after I joined them. The scariest part was I had no idea how I was goin’ to pay them back. I don’t recommend it as a business strategy, but it’s where I was at. It was hard asking for help”--he scrunched up his nose--“But you know what?”

“What?”

“When I expressed my need for help,” he said, “I got tremendous support from everyone. They rallied right around me and helped me through. That’s the power of doing business within strong community.”  
   
“‘Business within strong community,’” Jack repeated. “Cal says that. A lot.”

“You said you were embarrassed to share your struggles, just now,” the rancher asked.

“Yeah, kind of,” Jack said.

“Did I make you feel stupid?”

Jack shook his head.

“Did I walk away from you?”

“No. You were very encouraging, why?”

“As you were talking and unloading everything you had kept inside for so long, did you feel better?”

“Yeah, I guess,” Jack shrugged.

“I bet,” the rancher said holding up a finger, “you even begin to see solutions for some of your problems just through talking about it, am I right.”

“Well,” Jack stammered, “I mean, I thought about stuff, but I don’t know if they’re solutions.”

“That’s what can happen when you and others share and brainstorm together\!” Charlie smiled at the younger man. “Jack, you know good men. I know you do because you are a good man and good men attract good friends. Go, find them and start sharin’. Start, as Carl says, ‘a lifestyle of contribution.’ Start a mastermind, Jack.”

The younger man mumbled a reply, trying to think it through.

“Well, the day’s leavin’ us behind\!” Charlie declared as he stood up, “You should go, too.” He pointed at the pedestrian sign. “‘Cause the light’s green now.”

CHARLIE LEFT Jack alone to his thoughts and shivers.

The mechanic was thinking of all the businessmen and leaders he knew he could invite to a mastermind. It still felt weird to him. He imagined how the conversation would go.

*“Hey, you wanna get together and talk about our problems,”* Jack would ask.

The friend would probably wrinkle his nose and shake his head, *“I’m sorry, Jack, I have important things to do.”*

Jack blushed just thinking about it.

He slowly rose from the curb and watched Charlie stroll away humming to himself. Jack tried to imagine what the rancher must have been like in his younger years. 

*“Probably wore the same outfit of jean clothes.”* He chuckled to himself. 

The light turned green again and Jack crossed the street, climbed into his truck, and went to work.

JACK HAD begun to view his shop from a new perspective. He no longer felt the intense pressure to make something of himself. Yet he also took comfort in knowing success was possible.

Stepping inside the dusty office, he paused. He looked at the piles of bills, flyers, and *Popular Mechanics* magazines strewn across the desk over his laptop.

A thought occurred to him. Leaning out the office door, Jack shouted to the young men in the shop.

“Hey, Gabriel\!” he called, “Come here for a sec’\!”

The 18-year-old looked at his co-workers nervously before jogging toward the office.

“Yeah, boss?” he said.

“Do you enjoy working here, Gabe?”

“Yes sir, I appreciate the job\!” he said, a little too enthusiastically to be genuine.

“You like changing oil and grabbing tools and parts for me and Pete?”

“Happy to help wherever I can, sir,” the young man assured.

“But aren’t you good with computers? Wouldn’t you rather be somewhere else messing around with computers and software and what-not?” Jack asked.

“I mean, I suppose so. But I didn’t get a job like that. You hired me and I’m glad to be working.”

“Would you enjoy doing the computer work for the shop?” Jack asked the teenager.

Gabe thought for a second, “I’ve never really considered it. I suppose I could enjoy it.”

“You’d enjoy it more than working on the cars, wouldn't you?” Jack asked, perceiving restraint in the answer.

“Actually, to be honest, sir, yes I would,” the young man admitted.

“It’s all yours then,” Jack said. “If you want it, I’ll give you responsibility over all the computer work: records, scheduling, billing--all of that.’” 

Gabe put his hand over his chin, as if considering the negotiation.

“I’ll bump your pay up to be worth it. If you agree, all of this,” he spread his hands out to the office. “Will be your domain.”

“All of it?” Gabe exclaimed.

“Yup\! I’ll move my stuff over there,” Jack said motioning to the desk in the corner, nearly hidden by all the boxes, papers, and parts covering it. “And you can do whatever you need to be comfortable with this desk.”

He thought a little more, eyeing the rest of the office.

“Perhaps I’ll bring my wife in and get her to help shine this place up to be a little more pleasant and welcoming. Otherwise, it’s under your charge. Are you cool with this? Do you want to give it a try for a while?”

“Yes, sir--I mean no sir--I mean, I want to do it.”

“Good\! You ready to start?”

“Yes, sir\!”

“Okay, I’ll go over everything with you as soon as I clear away this junk.”

Jack started looking through all the stuff on his desk. He stacked the magazines together and tossed them into the trash. Setting all the bills and business paperwork right next to the computer, he began sorting through the loose-leaf papers. A little flyer caught his attention:

*“Share, learn, and grow with people like you\!”* it read. *“Join us at our weekly business mastermind\!”*

JACK COULDN’T believe what he was doing. Upon finding the mastermind invitation (which he would’ve normally thrown away), he called the number and asked to visit the next Saturday.

Now, he sat around a restaurant table with five other businessmen, four of whom he had never met before and one who was none other than Mr. Robertson, the roofer. Jack laughed at himself as he remembered the half-hearted conversation he had with the roofer at the church banquet. His perspective had changed dramatically since then.

They were going around the table sharing about themselves so Jack could get to know them better. It all reminded him of the group of retired men who met every Thursday morning  in the cafe on Lewis Street. Only these guys were his own age.

Each one talked about their businesses, why they had started, what they had gone through and overcome, and what they hoped would happen in the future.

Then it was Jack’s turn. His heart beat a little faster. Adrenaline surged through his body. 

“I--it--it,” he stuttered and blushed, but he pushed through. “To be honest, it freaks me out to share about my problems with you.” 

There. He had it out. The men chuckled.

“Believe me, we’ve all been there bro,” the leader, a guy named Kyle Hendrix, assured Jack. “Just say whatever you’re comfortable sharing.”

Jack continued, explaining some of his backstory and the current state of his business. The more he shared, the easier it got. He even told them some of the humiliating details, like his debt and how long it had taken him to realize his wife should be a top priority over his business.

“It’s hard--and embarrassing--for me to share this. In fact, it has taken me a long time to even see the value of a group like this,” he told the men.

Their continual nodding and expressions of agreement relieved Jack. They seemed to understand what he was talking about.

Charlie had been right. It felt good to share with people who understood and still respected him. Plus, they had good insight into some of his problems, even though none of them were mechanics.

Jack knew he would be joining them the next week and every week. These guys were real men. Successful, strong, brilliant. Yet they spoke freely about their weaknesses. They even asked him--the new guy--for input, which he shared humbly. Being able to contribute to other people’s success boosted his own confidence and motivation to work hard towards success himself.

Jack sat back and smiled. His old friend would be delighted: he had found his “strong community.”

**Chapter 8: The Last Meeting**  
***Isn’t a Mastermind Just Shooting the Breeze?***

***Three Years Later…***  
THE OWNER of *Jack’s Auto-Repair* drove his old Tacoma into the garage one last time.

Pete, the newest chief mechanic in town, waved at his boss.

“Good mornin’\!” he greeted the smiling Jack.

“Morning\!” the boss replied. “You ready for this?”

“Yes sir\!”

Jack’s eight-year-old son Jimmy jumped out of the truck and ran into the office. 

The mechanic had done himself proud over the previous three years. Customers bragged freely about their favorite mechanic shop and how well they treated their customers.

“That garage on Main. It’s the best. If they can’t getcha in right away, they’ll make you a priority later on. That young secretary of theirs, he’ll even call you up personally to tell when there’s a new opening available. Can’t beat their prices or efficiency, either\!”

Jack Martin walked into his old office. Jimmy dangled off the secretary as Gabe tried to continue working on the computer.

“Careful, Jimmy. You bother Gabe too much and he might not want you to come back\!” Jack joked. 

He stood still, taking it all in. The place was in tip-top shape. Riley had done herself proud in decorating the office so anyone would feel comfortable waiting in it. Apart from the dead flowers on the coffee table, it was just how she had put it.

“Mechanic shops are always so dirty and gross,” she had told her husband. “Make it pleasant enough for people to *want* to come. And provide snacks\!”

But the time had come for Jack to move on. He loved the thrill of presenting people with restored vehicles. But he realized he loved helping restore lives even more. He had done what he could to transform lives through the shop. He was proud of what he had done here. Pete had excelled even Jack in skill, Nate had moved on with a bigger, better company. And Gabe was working his way through college while renovating the entire environment at the repair shop through computers.

Jack gathered what was left on his desk into his briefcase. With one last thank-you and handshake, he said goodbye and drove away.

But there was still one last thing to do before he left town.

“WHAT DID he say?”

Jack and his mentor were back at their regular spot after Thursday morning breakfast. 

“He thought all we did at the meetings was shoot the breeze. He was like, ‘I’ve got a few friends I play golf with on the weekends. Isn’t that the same thing?’”

They chuckled at the thought.

“What did you say then?”

“I told him it’s much more than that,” Jack said. “We do spend time catching up, but we’re intentional about helping each other grow.”

“Oh, some people are so skeptical at first, aren’t they?” the old man winked. 

“They certainly are\!” Jack exclaimed, rolling his eyes.  
“You said it right. Every mastermind should take time to catch up and make small-talk. Good camaraderie is important for deep growth to happen. But remember, leaders are busy. Don’t waste their time. Focus the discussions on things that matter.”

“So how did you guys focus your meetings?”

“Good question,” the old man mused. “We made a lot of mistakes along the way, as I’m sure your group does, too,” he explained. “But we learned quickly it was easy to make false assumptions. Once we figured this out, we began taking time to ask clarifying questions whenever someone shared a story, or problem before we assumed we knew the answer.”

“Makes sense,” Jack agreed.

“Everyone comes at life and business from different angles--which is the beauty of masterminds. But our differences can cause misunderstandings which easily result in wrong assumptions. We made sure we clearly understood each situation. Remember, Jack, just because your perspective is different doesn’t mean you’re right *nor* does it mean you’re wrong. It just means you're different. So don’t hesitate to share your perspective--it will be very helpful. But also never assume you know the right or wrong answer.

Jack loved listening to his old mentor, especially when he got passionate. Even after listening to him for years, Jack thought he must still have an untapped storehouse of wisdom.

“Also, something else we found helpful was to pick one thing to act on every week. There are a hundred suggestions you could try to implement every week. You just can’t. So, after brainstorming together, we chose one thing each of us would do that week. And we made it a priority, because nothing ever changes if you don’t prioritize it. Make it as important as eating. But don’t try to do everything at once.

“How do you make it a priority?”

“Well, depending on what type of assignment it was, I literally made it as important as eating. If I was trying to develop a daily habit, I would refuse to eat lunch until I had done it.”

“That certainly would motivate me\!” Jack said, already thinking of the chicken sandwich he was going to have for lunch. “What else did you do?”

His old mentor thought for a moment.

“Ah\!” he finally said. “Here’s a neat trick we learned several years after doing the same thing over and over again. Structure is important, but we found it sometimes gets really monotonous. When this happens, people easily disengage from the group. So we took time to change things up. For example, sometimes we each shared from books we had recently read--sometimes going so far as to rent a room and actually teach it to each other. Other times, we’d all attend a seminar together. This was especially fun if it was out of state, because it meant we could take a road trip. Sometimes we’d go just as guys, other times we’d bring our wives and make a grand party out of it.”

Jack wondered what it would be like to road trip with these passionate men.

“So where did the structure come from?” Jack asked.

“You know how Charlie likes to talk a lot?” the old mentor asked Jack, eyes twinkling.

“Yes sir\!” Jack chuckled. “I’ve had several a lengthy chats with him, actually.”

“Oh have you?” the old man laughed. “Well, if you think he talks a lot now, you should have seen him when he first came. He wouldn’t be seated at the table two minutes before he’d have us all wrapped up in some grand story,” Cal smiled as he spoke. “As much as we loved Charlie and his stories, we knew that’s not why any of us were attending the meeting. This taught us two things. Number one, we needed an official moderator. Carl was the obvious choice, since he already did so informally. Number two, we needed to set boundaries.

“As you know, the meetings originally were born out of our note-swapping in college. After Carl and I finished the class and still wanted to keep sharing ideas back and forth, we started meeting at a cafe not too far from campus.

“When it was just the two of us, things went pretty smoothly and naturally. But soon Kip started coming and then Charlie and Trev.

“We hashed things out so hard\! We’d tear each idea apart and brainstorm how to put it back together--it was great\!” The old man laughed again. “But we all felt--especially at the behest of Carl--like we could get more done if we were more intentional with our time.

“So with Carl at the helm, we structured our meetings. That’s when we came up with what you’ve seen every week--or pretty close to it at least. Obviously it has evolved over the years, especially after we all retired.”

“How’d you come up with the ‘hot-seat’?” Jack asked.

“It just kind of evolved, as I recall. It likely started when Carl and I first went up to visit Kip. We saw how helpful it was for him to share freely without interruption. He also appreciated what little input we gave after he had shared. Soon we were all doing it. From there, we naturally started brainstorming each problem together. And every week, we’d follow-up.”

Jack’s mentor leaned back and crossed his legs. 

“Once, we invited a guy named Adam to join us. He was a construction worker or something along those lines--I don’t remember. He came for several weeks before we all convinced Carl to ask him to leave.”

Jack gaped. “I never knew this\! Why on earth?” he asked.

“Because he was all talk, talk, talk and no action. He’d sit in the ‘hot-seat’ and share all his problems week after week. But we quickly realized he kept having the same problems--which would’ve been fine, if the guy had honestly tried our advice. But it became obvious he wasn’t taking it seriously. We felt like he was taking advantage of the group and stealing our time. So we asked him to leave.”

Jack raised his eyebrows. “Ouch,” he said.

“Yeah, it wasn’t fun for either him or us. We all felt bad. But we valued our time and the integrity of the group. That’s when we started choosing weekly ‘assignments’ after every session and being more careful who we allowed to join us.”

“Wow, you guys were serious,” Jack said.

They sipped their coffees as the conversation lulled.

“So, uh,” the old man finally said. “You’re all packed?”

“Yup,” Jack replied.

“This old town’s not gonna be the same without ya, son.” Jack thought he saw a tear slipping down his old mentor’s face.

“Yeah, we’re going to miss it.”

“Don’t forget about me, now. Visit at least once a year.” The old man smiled, unashamed at the tears now streaming down his face.

“Only if you do the same\!” Jack said. “Thanks for everything, Cal.”

“I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m so proud of you, Jack Martin.”
