# Why You're Reading This {#why-you're-reading-this}

The problems in your shed business aren't generic. They're specific to you, your market, your team, and your situation. Sure, the patterns are similar across businesses. But the solutions need to fit your specific reality.

I've worked with a lot of of shed business owners. Each one thought their problems were unique. In one way, they were right—every business has its own flavor of challenges. But in another way, they were completely wrong. The core issues are remarkably consistent.

What's not consistent is how to fix them for your specific situation.

That's why this book exists as a conversation starter, not a conversation ender. It's designed to show you the patterns I see across the industry. To help you recognize which challenges are hitting your business hardest. To give you a framework for thinking about solutions.

But the real work happens when we talk.

Because while the problems may be similar, your path forward is uniquely yours. Your market is different. Your team is different. Your cash flow situation is different. Your growth goals are different.

Generic advice won't cut it. You need specific strategies that fit your specific situation.

So as you read this book, don't just think about which problems sound familiar. Think about which solutions could actually work in your business. 

Which ones would your team actually implement. 

Which ones would your dealers actually follow. 

Which ones your cash flow can actually handle.

Then let's talk about how to make them happen. Because that's where the real transformation begins.

## When Every Day Feels Like a Battle {#when-every-day-feels-like-a-battle}

You know the feeling.

You wake up ready to grow your business. By 10 AM, you're drowning in problems. Your marketing company is running ads for sheds you don't even build anymore. Three dealers haven't called back hot leads you paid good money for. Production is behind schedule. And a customer just called furious about their delivery.

It's only Monday.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. They all think their problems are unique. But the truth is, most face the same challenges.

## Everything is Connected {#everything-is-connected}

Here's what most business owners miss: Every part of your business affects every other part. That marketing problem? It's not just a marketing problem. It creates a mess in sales, production, delivery, and your bank account.

Think of your business like a chain. When one link breaks, the whole thing falls apart. When marketing sends bad leads, sales gets frustrated. When sales promises what production can't deliver, customers get angry. When customers are angry, your reputation suffers.

This book will show you these connections. You'll see how problems in one area create problems everywhere else. More importantly, you'll learn how to fix them.

## The Real Cost of Broken Systems {#the-real-cost-of-broken-systems}

Let me tell you what I've seen:

* A manufacturer spent thousands on marketing leads. Dealers never called them back. The owner got mad at dealers for wasting money. Dealers complained the leads were junk.  
* A production team picked which buildings to build based on what was easiest. Not what customers needed first. This created a never-ending cycle of missed deadlines and frustrated dealers.   
* A business owner had a million dollars in accounts receivable on paper. But he couldn't figure out why there was no cash to pay bills. This was a bookkeeping mistake he didn’t catch until he hired an auditor. 

In each case, the real problem wasn't in one department. It was in the gaps between departments. Poor communication and broken systems created cycles that drained profits and killed morale.

## Why Quick Fixes Don't Work {#why-quick-fixes-don't-work}

Maybe you've tried fixing some of these problems. You hired consultants. You bought new software. You reorganized your team. But somehow, nothing sticks.

Here's why: You can't fix a connected problem with a single solution. When you patch one area without fixing how it connects to others, you're putting a band-aid on a broken arm. The bleeding might stop, but the damage continues.

## A Better Way: Making Everything Work Together {#a-better-way:-making-everything-work-together}

This book offers a different approach. Instead of fixing one thing at a time, we'll show you how to make your departments work together instead of against each other.

You'll learn:

* How good marketing makes your sales team more effective  
* Why sales and production fights can be solved with better communication  
* How quality control in production prevents delivery headaches  
* Why clear finances help you make better decisions everywhere  
* How good admin support frees you to actually run your business

## What's Coming Next {#what's-coming-next}

I won't lie to you. This won't be easy. Real change never is. But I can promise that fixing these connected problems will give you results that quick fixes never could.

You'll start seeing patterns instead of chaos. Your departments will speak the same language. You'll build systems that work without your constant attention. Most importantly, you'll stop feeling like your business is running you.

Throughout this book, I'll share real stories from businesses I've worked with. These aren't theories. They're proven strategies that have generated millions in extra revenue and given owners their lives back.

My goal isn't to inspire you for a few days. I want to give you tools you can use right now. Tools that build on each other to create lasting change.

Here's the truth: Your business doesn't have to feel like a constant fire fight. The ups and downs, the department wars, the sleepless nights about cash flow—none of these are normal. They're symptoms of broken systems that can be fixed.

So if you're ready to stop treating symptoms and start building a business that runs smoothly, keep reading. The solutions aren't fancy new ideas. They're proven systems that recognize how everything in your business connects.

Let's start with the area where many problems begin: Marketing.

# 

# 

# Chapter 1: Marketing Problems \- When Your Marketing Money Disappears {#chapter-1:-marketing-problems---when-your-marketing-money-disappears}

"I'm spending all this money on marketing. The dealers won't pick up the phone and call these people back. All they want is free, easy leads. They're not putting in the work. So why am I spending on marketing?"

If that sounds like your internal rant, you're dealing with one of the most frustrating business problems I see. But before we talk about dealer accountability (we'll cover that in the Sales chapter), let's look at the marketing problems that hit almost every business I work with.

## The "Did It Work?" Problem {#the-"did-it-work?"-problem}

Picture this: You get your monthly bill from your marketing company. You spent $10,000 this month on digital ads, social media, and SEO. Sales were decent. But were they better because of this money? How many leads actually became customers? Which marketing actually worked and which was a waste?

If you're like most business owners, you get silence, vague promises, or conflicting reports that don't answer your main question: **Is this marketing actually making me money?**

This problem—not knowing if marketing works—isn't just frustrating. It's dangerous. Without clear tracking, you make one of two costly mistakes:

1. **Spending too much on bad marketing** \- You keep pouring money into campaigns that look good but don't drive real sales

2. **Spending too little on good marketing** \- You hold back because you can't see the return, missing growth opportunities

Poor tracking hurts more than just your marketing budget. Your sales team starts thinking marketing leads are junk. This creates a toxic cycle where leads don't get followed up properly, which makes marketing look even worse.

## The Agency Letdown Cycle {#the-agency-letdown-cycle}

"We hired an agency six months ago. They promised the world and charged premium rates. I'm not sure what they actually delivered."

I see this pattern all the time:

1. You realize you need marketing help and hire an agency  
2. Big excitement and promises from both sides  
3. Three months in, you're questioning what you're getting  
4. Six months in, you're frustrated and want to fire them  
5. You start over with a new agency and repeat the cycle

What drives this isn't that all agencies are bad (though some are). Many agencies don't get held accountable for real business results. They measure success by clicks and lead numbers—not revenue.

Without systems to track marketing through to actual sales, even good agencies can't optimize for what actually matters to your business.

## The Junk Lead Problem {#the-junk-lead-problem}

Few things frustrate business owners more than paying for leads that will never buy. Leads from outside your area. People who can't afford what you sell. Window shoppers with no real interest in buying.

Bad leads waste money twice:

1. First, in the cost to get the lead  
2. Second, in wasted time following up

The lead quality problem creates an especially nasty issue when it damages the relationship between marketing and sales. When salespeople or dealers keep getting bad leads, they stop prioritizing “online leads”—potentially missing the good ones mixed in with the bad.

## The Promotion Mix-Up {#the-promotion-mix-up}

"Why are we still getting calls about that 20% off promotion we ran in January? It's March\!"

Another common marketing problem happens when your external marketing doesn't match your internal operations. This shows up as:

* Advertising products you don't build anymore  
* Running promotions past their end date  
* Creating marketing that promises service levels you can't deliver

These mix-ups create disappointed customers, frustrated sales teams, and operational nightmares. A customer who shows up expecting a specific promotion your team knows nothing about isn't just a missed sale—it's damage to your reputation.

## How Marketing Problems Hurt Everything Else {#how-marketing-problems-hurt-everything-else}

Marketing problems create a ripple effect through your whole business:

* **Sales Impact**: Bad leads and unclear tracking create tension with your sales team and dealers  
* **Operations Stress**: Wrong promotions and inaccurate marketing create expectations production can't meet  
* **Money Problems**: Marketing without clear ROI leads to either wasted spending or missed growth  
* **Customer Problems**: The gap between marketing promises and what you actually deliver damages trust

## How to Fix Marketing Problems {#how-to-fix-marketing-problems}

Fixing these problems requires more than just hiring a better agency or buying new software. You need to connect your marketing with the rest of your business. Here's where to start:

### 1\. Demand Better Tracking

Your marketing agency should track leads from first contact all the way to sales. If they can't provide this reporting, they're not the right partner. At minimum, you should know:

* Cost per lead  
* Cost per qualified lead  
* Cost per actual sale for each marketing channel

### 2\. Create Clear Communication

Set up processes for marketing to communicate with sales, production, and service about:

* Upcoming promotions  
* Product changes  
* Marketing messages

This isn't a one-time fix. It's an ongoing system of keeping everyone aligned.

### 3\. Focus on Lead Quality, Not Just Quantity

Work with your marketing team to establish clear definitions of qualified leads. Hold them accountable for quality over volume. One qualified lead is worth more than twenty tire-kickers. If you have a low quality channel, add marketing automation to qualify leads before they get to the sales team. 

### 4\. Connect Marketing and Sales Systems

Your CRM should connect directly to your marketing tools. This creates a loop where marketing can see which leads convert and sales can access information about prospects.

### 5\. Require Testing and Improvement

Your marketing partners should constantly test campaigns and find ways to drive lead costs down while increasing quality. If they're not, they're not earning their money.

When marketing works properly, it becomes the engine that drives predictable growth throughout your business. Sales gets a steady stream of qualified opportunities. Operations can plan based on reliable forecasts. Finance can make investments knowing the return.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the sales challenges that often connect with these marketing issues. They either create a cycle of growth or a cycle of blame.

# Chapter 2: Sales Problems \- When Revenue Goes Up and Down Like a Roller Coaster {#chapter-2:-sales-problems---when-revenue-goes-up-and-down-like-a-roller-coaster}

"My sales guy is on a revenue roller coaster. Up for a month, down two months. Up for a month, down two months. Do I keep him or fire him? How much time do I give him to come back?"

If you've ever stared at sales reports with wild swings, you know one of the most stressful parts of running a business. The unpredictability isn't just frustrating—it makes planning nearly impossible and keeps you constantly worried.

Let's look at the sales challenges that hit almost every business I work with. They're often more complicated than they first appear.

## The Dealer Problem {#the-dealer-problem}

For businesses working with dealers, this might sound painfully familiar:

You spend thousands on marketing to get qualified leads. You give these leads to your dealers, expecting them to follow up quickly and turn prospects into customers. But when you check back, many leads were never contacted, or got only a weak follow-up.

Dealers complain: "We only get a 10% conversion rate on these leads, but we get a 60% conversion rate for people walking on the lot. These leads are trash." Even good salespeople beat themselves up over seemingly low conversion rates.

Then you question yourself: "Why am I spending on marketing if dealers won't pick up the phone and call these people back? All they want is free, easy leads, and they're not putting in the work."

This accountability gap creates a vicious cycle:

1. You spend on marketing to generate leads  
2. Dealers think they're bad leads and follow up poorly (or don't follow up at all)  
3. Conversion rates suffer  
4. You question your marketing investment  
5. Dealers blame lead quality for poor performance  
6. Trust breaks down in all directions

The frustration isn't just about wasted marketing dollars. It's the feeling of helplessness—you depend on dealers to drive revenue, but can't directly control what they do. And trying to hold them accountable risks damaging relationships you need.

## The Revenue Roller Coaster {#the-revenue-roller-coaster}

One of the most stressful parts of sales management is the unpredictability. You crush targets one month, only to miss them badly the next. These swings make it impossible to plan production, manage cash flow, or invest with confidence.

The revenue roller coaster isn't just annoying—it's a symptom of deeper problems:

* Inconsistent sales processes that depend on individual effort rather than systems  
* No pipeline visibility to prevent problems early  
* Relying on "heroic" last-minute efforts instead of steady, predictable activity  
* No early warning signs to forecast downturns

What's especially troubling is when manufacturers or owners don't even see these patterns. One client discovered an individual was riding a consistent pattern of one month up, two months down—and was completely unaware of it. How can you fix what you don't even see?

## The Hiring, Keeping, and Firing Problem {#the-hiring,-keeping,-and-firing-problem}

"You put in all the work of training them and getting them up to speed. Product knowledge, company systems, lead flow. Then two or three months in, you have a bad feeling. But it's six months before it becomes really obvious this isn't going to work out."

The cost of a bad sales hire goes way beyond their salary. There's the time you invested in training, the opportunities they missed or messed up, the company knowledge they take when they leave, and the cost of starting over with someone new.

And then you have to do it all over again.

What makes this especially painful is how long it takes to identify the problem. You might suspect issues within months, but feel like you should give them more time. Six months later, you're finally certain—but you've lost half a year of potential growth.

## The Ambition Gap {#the-ambition-gap}

Not all sales challenges come from processes or accountability. Sometimes, the issue is more basic: a lack of hunger and drive among your sales team.

"They lack depth of ambition."

This ambition gap is especially frustrating because it's hard to fix. You can train skills, but instilling drive in someone who lacks it naturally is hard, sometimes impossible. What's worse, this lack of ambition often shows up as resistance to the very things that could improve performance.

The result? Salespeople who:

* Reject CRM usage and accountability tools  
* Resist follow-up processes  
* Are satisfied with "good enough" performance  
* Blame external factors rather than taking ownership

## How Sales Problems Hurt Everything Else {#how-sales-problems-hurt-everything-else}

Sales issues never exist alone—they create problems throughout your business:

* **Marketing Impact**: Poor sales follow-up wastes marketing money and makes tracking impossible  
* **Production Problems**: Revenue swings create feast-or-famine cycles in production  
* **Cash Flow Problems**: Unpredictable sales make financial planning difficult  
* **Customer Problems**: Inconsistent sales processes create unpredictable customer experiences

## How to Fix Sales Problems {#how-to-fix-sales-problems}

Fixing these sales problems requires more than motivational speeches or higher commissions. You need systematic changes to how you structure, manage, and measure your sales function.

### 1\. Reconsider Your Sales Model

If dealer accountability is a constant problem, it may be time to evaluate a direct sales model where you have more control. Direct salespeople are typically used to:

* Accountability structures  
* CRM usage  
* Performance metrics

While this represents a big change, the increased control easily pays for itself when done well.

### 2\. Make Accountability Non-Negotiable

Whether you work with dealers or direct sales staff, make accountability non-negotiable. This means:

* Required CRM usage to track all activities  
* Clear metrics for lead response time  
* Regular pipeline reviews  
* Performance tracking that identifies patterns early

This goes both ways—if you hold them accountable, also give them the support they need to do their job well.

### 3\. Hire for Hunger, Not Just Experience

When making sales hires, look for ambition and past success. Look for candidates who:

* Have a track record of beating targets  
* Ask about pay potential early in interviews  
* Have specific financial goals they're working toward  
* Are comfortable with accountability

You won't get a life-changing salesperson if you can't give them a reasonable path to earning life-changing money.

### 4\. Build Systems That Support Excellence

Top performers don't just want big commission potential—they want to know you'll clear obstacles from their path. This means:

* Efficient lead distribution  
* Streamlined proposal and contract processes  
* Quick resolution of customer issues  
* Clear communication with production and service

Create an environment where ambitious salespeople can thrive, and you'll attract and keep the talent you need.

It's not just about the systems. It's about a culture that values people while pushing for results.

### 5\. Use Data to Spot Patterns Early

The revenue roller coaster is most dangerous when you don't see the dips coming. Set up reporting that shows:

* Pipeline by stage with conversion probabilities  
* Activity metrics (calls, meetings, proposals)  
* Historical patterns in individual performance

These early warning signs let you step in before small issues become revenue crises.

When your sales function operates systematically rather than chaotically, it doesn't just improve revenue—it transforms your entire business. Marketing can optimize based on clear tracking data. Production can plan with confidence. Financial forecasts become reliable rather than wishful thinking.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the operations challenges that often create tension with your sales team, and how to align these critical functions for maximum efficiency.

# 

# 

# Chapter 3: Operations Problems \- When Production and Sales Are at War {#chapter-3:-operations-problems---when-production-and-sales-are-at-war}

If one challenge consistently creates the most stress for business owners I work with, it's what I call "the war between sales and production." It shows up in heated exchanges that might sound familiar:

Sales: "Why can't you just build what the customer wants? We promised delivery in three weeks\!"

Production: "Because you keep selling custom orders without checking with us\! We had a guy take off for 2 weeks, and now we're booked six weeks out\!"

This tension between what sales promises and what production can deliver isn't just uncomfortable—it's costing you money, customer satisfaction, and employee morale.

Let's explore the most common operations challenges and why they're more connected to your other business functions than you might think.

## The Sales vs. Production Battle {#the-sales-vs.-production-battle}

The biggest stress in operations usually centers around two areas of conflict:

### 1\. Lead Time Fights

Sales wants to promise quick delivery to close deals. Production needs realistic timelines to maintain quality and efficiency. When these don't align, chaos happens.

Or, something comes up and production falls behind, but forgets to tell sales.

The result is predictable: production feels pressured to rush, quality suffers, other orders get delayed, and eventually, sales loses confidence in the promises they can make to customers.

### 2\. Inventory Building Decisions

What inventory should you build during slower periods? Sales wants variety and options to show customers. Production wants efficiency through building the same things. Finance wants to minimize cash tied up in unsold inventory.

When these competing priorities aren't balanced through proper systems, you end up with inventory that doesn't sell, tying up cash. And because you don't have enough popular models, you have long lead times or lose sales entirely.

When these issues aren't worked out, they make the seasonality problem even worse.

## The Seasonality Squeeze {#the-seasonality-squeeze}

Managing cash flow during seasonal business can be a headache.

* Do you keep full production capacity year-round, building inventory during slow periods?  
* Do you scale production up and down with demand, losing skilled workers?  
* Do you build inventory during the slow season?  
* Do you look for other products to sell during your off-season?  
* Do you get a line of credit or build up your own cash reserves?

Without systematic approaches to these questions, businesses often default to reactive decisions that create annual cycles of feast and famine, cash flow crunches, and staffing problems.

## The Production Efficiency Puzzle {#the-production-efficiency-puzzle}

Every production operation faces common efficiency challenges:

* **Order Processing Delays**: Making sure orders get promptly sent to production when they come in, rather than sitting in someone's inbox  
* **Production Sequencing**: Building in the right order for maximum efficiency while honoring customer commitments  
* **Sneaky Shortcuts**: Stopping production teams from choosing easier jobs while more difficult (but often more urgent) orders wait  
* **Accurate Pay**: Keeping accurate records of who spends time on what, especially when running piece rate pay  
* **Accountability for Hourly Workers**:  Making sure that you’re getting the value you need from your hourly employees. 

Each of these challenges may seem like minor operational details. But together, they can be the difference between a profitable production operation and one that consistently underperforms.

Many times, you don't have a good way to address this because of another underlying problem...

## The Delegation Problem {#the-delegation-problem}

Many times, owners or general managers end up doing too much. They feel like they can't afford to pay an admin assistant or secretary, because they're not sure what that person would do. Yet, they really do need one.

"Death by 1000 paper cuts" is especially common in growing businesses. The owner or key managers become bottlenecks because they're handling numerous small tasks that could be delegated but haven't been.

The reasons vary from "it's faster to do it myself" to "I can't afford to hire help," but the result is the same: leaders spending valuable time on low-value activities while strategic priorities suffer.

## How Operations Problems Hurt Everything Else {#how-operations-problems-hurt-everything-else}

Operations challenges don't exist alone—they create problems throughout your business:

* **Sales Impact**: Production inefficiencies and lead time issues directly impact sales team credibility and closing rates  
* **Customer Problems**: Quality inconsistencies and missed deadlines damage customer satisfaction and reviews  
* **Money Problems**: Inventory misalignment and production inefficiencies reduce margins and tie up capital  
* **Marketing Problems**: Seasonal production creates marketing challenges in maintaining consistent lead flow

## How to Fix Operations Problems {#how-to-fix-operations-problems}

Fixing these operational problems requires systematic approaches rather than quick fixes:

### 1\. Bridge the Sales-Production Gap

The war between sales and production isn't inevitable—it's the result of misaligned systems. Create processes that ensure:

* Production regularly communicates current lead times to sales  
* Sales has visibility into the production schedule, both for inventory and custom orders  
* There's a formal process for expediting truly urgent orders  
* Both departments share common goals tied to customer satisfaction

After implementing such systems, one owner finally felt like sales and production were playing on the same team, instead of against each other.

### 2\. Set Up Production Scheduling Systems

Move beyond whiteboard schedules or spreadsheets to proper production management tools that:

* Track every order from receipt to delivery  
* Provide realistic completion dates based on current capacity  
* Optimize the sequence of jobs for efficiency  
* Give everyone visibility into the schedule

This transparency eliminates the "when will my order be ready" questions that bog down your team and creates accountability for meeting commitments.

### 3\. Build a Seasonality Plan

Rather than reacting to seasonality each year as though it's a surprise, create deliberate strategies for managing it:

* Develop inventory building plans for slow periods based on what's going to sell  
* Consider alternate product lines that sell in complementary seasons  
* Create cash flow projections that account for seasonality  
* Help your dealers or salespeople make a plan, especially if they're new

With proper planning, seasonality becomes a predictable cycle you can manage rather than a crisis you must survive.

### 4\. Build Quality Control Processes

Quality issues that reach customers create exponential costs in service calls, reputation damage, and canceled sales. Set up QC processes that:

* Have clear quality standards  
* Include multiple checkpoints throughout production  
* Empower workers to flag potential issues before they reach customers  
* Track and analyze quality problems to address root causes, not just blame people

Remember: The cheapest time to fix a quality problem is before the shed leaves your facility.

### 5\. Create Delegation Systems

Strategic delegation isn't just about hiring help—it's about creating systems that make delegation effective:

* Document key processes so they can be easily handed off (yes, you can delegate this, too)  
* Identify tasks that are consuming leader time but don't require leader skills  
* Consider part-time or even virtual roles to get started  
* Create clear accountability for delegated responsibilities

As one client discovered after implementing such systems: "I'm not doing less work—I'm doing more valuable work. The work only I can do, that actually moves the business forward."

When operations run smoothly, the benefits go far beyond efficiency. Sales can make promises with confidence. Customers receive consistent quality. Finance can forecast more accurately. Marketing can align campaigns with production capacity.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the logistics challenges that often create the final hurdle between production completion and customer satisfaction, and how to ensure your delivery experience reinforces rather than undermines your brand.

# Chapter 4: Delivery Problems \- When the Last Mile Ruins Everything {#chapter-4:-delivery-problems---when-the-last-mile-ruins-everything}

Picture this: You've successfully marketed your product. Your sales team closed the deal. Your production team built it to specification and on schedule. Everything has gone perfectly—until the final mile.

The customer calls, furious: "Your delivery driver just dropped my building in the wrong spot, said 'not my problem,' and left. It's sitting crooked because the ground wasn't level, the door won't close properly, and now I'm being told I need to pay extra for repairs?"

Or, your dealer calls you, angry: "I was told I could promise the customer would have the building last Friday. It's Wednesday, and they haven't heard a thing from the hauler."

In those moments, all your previous successes disappear. The customer doesn't care about your "commitment to quality" or your production efficiency or your 5-star reviews. All they remember is this final, frustrating experience.

This is the reality of logistics—it's where everything comes together. And for many businesses, it's where the customer experience gets sealed as a raving fan or a regretful customer. Let's look at the most common delivery problems and their effects throughout your business.

## The Busy, Silent Hauler {#the-busy,-silent-hauler}

If you can find a great hauler who can communicate well with customers, having them as a contractor can work well. But if they're on the road all day and can't call from their truck, you'll end up with frustrated customers. And if they're not willing to put in a little extra work to get a review from the customer while they're on site, you're losing good ways to build your reputation.

Outsourcing delivery to third-party haulers creates a basic tension: the people representing your brand in this critical final interaction aren't your employees. You have limited control over how they treat your customers, yet their performance directly impacts your reputation.

The specific challenges this creates are numerous:

* **Communication Gaps**: Haulers who don't properly communicate with customers about delivery times or requirements  
* **Quality Neglect**: Not checking (or ignoring) damage or issues before delivery  
* **Customer Experience Inconsistency**: Different levels of professionalism and service depending on which hauler handles the delivery  
* **Schedule Flexibility Issues**: When haulers work for multiple companies, your deliveries might not be prioritized during busy periods

Most frustratingly, these issues can be difficult to address because of the arm's-length relationship. If you push too hard, you don't know if they'll stop working with you entirely. And then you have no deliveries at all.

## Quality Problems Multiply {#quality-problems-multiply}

Overlooking quality creates exponential costs, like compound interest on a payday loan. Think about the different scenarios:

1. Catching a quality issue in production: Quick fix, minimal cost  
2. Finding a problem before loading: Slight delay, moderate cost  
3. Discovering an issue during delivery: Significant delay, high cost  
4. Customer finding problems after delivery: Major expense, reputation damage

Each step in this cascade multiplies the cost of resolution—financially, operationally, and in customer goodwill. Yet many businesses lack the systematic quality checks that could prevent these escalating problems.

## The Site Prep Surprise {#the-site-prep-surprise}

Imagine hearing this from one of your dealers:

"We hired a contractor to do site prep for our on-site crew. He mentioned a potential issue with the holes he drilled, but nobody thought anything of it. Then, nobody had the permit in time for the inspector, so the general manager had to run it out to him. The inspector refused to pass the inspection. The contractor is booked out, and the customer is already upset with us missing our deadlines."

Not every situation is this bad. But delivery day surprises create significant complications:

* The customer said the site would be level, but it needs unexpected work  
* The salesperson forgot to ask about fences, trees, and narrow spaces

These surprises place haulers in a difficult position—proceed with a poor delivery or reschedule at significant cost. Neither option creates a positive customer experience.

Sometimes, even when the customer gives approval, it creates even more problems.

## Repair Response Breakdown {#repair-response-breakdown}

If the delivery isn't done right, it can turn into a repair.

Most manufacturers aren't set up to do repairs—they're set up to sell, build, and deliver sheds. Because of that, it's not always clear whose responsibility it is. And if it falls on the owner or general manager's lap, it's easy for it to fall through the cracks because of all they've got going on.

Besides, you've already sold the building, so there's no sales incentive to get it fixed.

The salespeople end up getting calls from the customer. They get upset because they're getting all these calls from an unhappy customer, and they feel unsupported by the manufacturer.

It's a bad domino effect:

1. Customers call in for a repair  
2. Salespeople or dealers get these calls since they're the customer's primary contact  
3. Sales gets frustrated at being the "complaint department"  
4. Sales doesn't close deals as well, because they're frustrated  
5. Production managers, already overloaded, struggle to prioritize repairs  
6. Repairs get delayed, creating more customer calls to sales  
7. The cycle continues, as frustration grows on all sides

Without a dedicated system for handling repairs, these issues become no one's job but everyone's problem.

## How Delivery Problems Hurt Everything Else {#how-delivery-problems-hurt-everything-else}

Logistics issues create cascading effects throughout your business:

* **Sales Impact**: Delivery problems generate customer complaints that sales must handle, damaging relationships and consuming time better spent selling  
* **Reputation Problems**: Delivery issues often trigger negative reviews that affect future sales opportunities  
* **Money Costs**: Post-delivery repairs are exponentially more expensive than preventative quality control  
* **Operations Problems**: Pulling resources to address delivery problems disrupts normal production schedules

## How to Fix Delivery Problems {#how-to-fix-delivery-problems}

Fixing these logistics problems requires systematic approaches rather than reactive fixes:

### 1\. Rethink Your Delivery Model

You need to decide when it's right to bring delivery in-house. While in-house delivery takes capital and a lot of work, it provides significantly more control over this critical customer touchpoint.

You can also solve this by having a really good multi-person hauling company. If you continue with third-party haulers, improve the relationship by:

* Make sure they know you're on their side (donuts, tips, and caffeine go a long way\!)  
* Do your part to make their job as easy as possible (make sure all buildings are promptly inspected and flagged as ready for pickup)  
* Make sure you're clear about what you need from them, and put together a way to make sure that's being met

Remember: Your delivery person is the last face of your company the customer sees. Their performance shapes the entire customer experience.

### 2\. Set Up Pre-Delivery Quality Control

Create a formal quality control process before products leave your facility:

* Put together a final inspection checklist  
* Assign specific responsibility for final quality check  
* Document the condition of products before they leave your facility (photos)  
* Create accountability for catching issues before delivery

Having someone spend an hour a week inspecting buildings will pay dividends in cost, headaches, and customer experience.

### 3\. Develop a Dedicated Repair Process

Stop treating repairs as an interruption to normal operations and build a systematic approach:

* Create a simple but effective repair tracking system  
* Assign specific responsibility for managing repairs  
* Establish clear timelines for resolution  
* Put a process in place to keep customers informed

This systematic approach not only improves customer satisfaction but also reduces the burden on your sales team and prevents repairs from disrupting regular production.

### 4\. Create Site Prep Protocols

Prevent delivery day surprises with better pre-delivery processes:

* Make sure all your salespeople are trained on site prep requirements  
* Put together a checklist that's done before scheduling deliveries  
* Consider offering site prep services for an additional fee

These preventative measures eliminate the most common delivery complications and set realistic expectations for everyone involved.

### 5\. Build Customer Review Collection into Delivery

Transform your delivery process from a potential liability into a powerful marketing asset:

* Train haulers to request reviews upon successful delivery  
* Set up automated follow-up requesting feedback after delivery  
* Create incentives for haulers based on positive customer experiences  
* Use delivery-specific feedback to continuously improve the process

Done right, delivery becomes not just the fulfillment of a promise but an opportunity to create advocates for your business.

When logistics functions smoothly, it doesn't just prevent problems—it becomes a competitive advantage. Customers who experience seamless delivery become advocates. Sales can confidently promise reliable delivery experiences. Operations can focus on production rather than fire-fighting.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the financial challenges that often prevent businesses from implementing these operational improvements, and how to ensure your financial management supports rather than constrains your growth.

# Chapter 5: Money Problems \- When the Numbers Don't Make Sense {#chapter-5:-money-problems---when-the-numbers-don't-make-sense}

"There's money in the account, can I just spend it please?"

This seemingly simple question shows one of the most common financial challenges business owners face: telling the difference between cash in the bank and money you can actually spend. It's a question that reveals a deeper problem—the disconnect between what your bank account shows and what your business actually needs to thrive.

And it's just one of several financial problems that hit even otherwise successful operations. Let's explore the most common financial challenges and why they're more connected to your operational decisions than you might think.

## The Financial Confusion Gap {#the-financial-confusion-gap}

"I have a balance sheet. My accountant gives me an income statement and a balance sheet, but I have no idea what it actually means. I don't know if they're actually doing their job."

Many business owners get regular financial statements but struggle to turn these documents into useful insights. The financial confusion gap shows up in several painful ways:

* **Report Overwhelm**: Getting detailed financial statements but not understanding the key numbers to focus on  
* **Accountant Dependency**: Relying completely on accountants for financial interpretation without having personal confidence in the numbers  
* **Decision Paralysis**: Hesitating to make strategic investments because of uncertainty about financial implications  
* **Reactive Management**: Making decisions based on bank balances rather than complete financial understanding

This confusion gap doesn't just create anxiety—it directly impacts your ability to make sound strategic decisions about every aspect of your business.

## The Seasonal Cash Flow Challenge {#the-seasonal-cash-flow-challenge}

Managing cash flow during seasonal ups and downs ranks among the most stressful financial challenges for many shed businesses. The questions this creates are complex and important:

* Do you take a line of credit to build inventory during slow periods?  
* How much cash do you save during peak seasons to weather the downturn?  
* Should you add other products with different seasonal patterns?

Without systematic approaches to these questions, shed businesses can find themselves in annual cycles of feast and famine—flush with cash one quarter and struggling to make payroll the next.

## The Profit Margin Mystery {#the-profit-margin-mystery}

Depending on how your accountant runs your finances, it might be hard to know your profit margin. If you've never paid close attention, they might still be running it on a cash basis—money in vs. money out. But that doesn't work well, because you've got down payments, inventory builds, delayed deliveries and more.

It can be easy to see a competitor run a sale, and follow suit without knowing whether it will cost or make you money.

This uncertainty creates a dangerous situation where business owners can't tell the difference between competitive pricing and profitability. Consider what this means:

* You might be under-pricing your products, leaving money on the table  
* You might be over-pricing and losing sales opportunities  
* You can't accurately evaluate the performance of different product lines  
* You lack benchmarks to assess your overall financial performance  
* You might be investing capital into inventory that doesn't yield the best return

Without clarity on appropriate profit margins, pricing becomes guesswork rather than strategy—and guesswork rarely leads to optimal outcomes.

## The Free Cash Confusion {#the-free-cash-confusion}

At the heart of many financial challenges lies a basic confusion about what constitutes "free cash"—money that's truly available for spending or investment.

Business owners often mistakenly think their bank balance equals spendable cash, failing to account for upcoming obligations:

* Payroll  
* Taxes  
* Vendor payments  
* Loan payments  
* Working capital (inventory, seasonality, etc)

This confusion leads to the classic cash flow crunch where, despite recent profits, you find yourself scrambling to meet basic obligations.

## How Money Problems Hurt Everything Else {#how-money-problems-hurt-everything-else}

Financial challenges create problems throughout your entire business:

* **Marketing Impact**: Financial uncertainty leads to inconsistent marketing investment, undermining long-term growth  
* **Sales Problems**: Pricing confusion and margin pressure create sales challenges and pay issues  
* **Operations Limitations**: Cash flow problems prevent investments in efficiency improvements  
* **Strategic Paralysis**: Financial illiteracy stops confident decision-making across all business functions

## How to Fix Money Problems {#how-to-fix-money-problems}

Fixing these financial problems requires systematic approaches rather than quick fixes:

### 1\. Develop Financial Understanding

You don't need to become an accountant, but you do need to understand the key numbers that drive your business. A few steps you can take:

* Create simple one-page financial dashboards with financial numbers that matter—for you as the owner, for marketing, for sales, and for production  
* Invest in basic financial education for yourself and key leaders  
* Schedule regular reviews with your accountant focused on education, not just reporting  
* Learn to tell the difference between the key financial statements and what each tells you

### 2\. Set Up Cash Flow Management Systems

Move beyond basic accounting to proactive cash flow management:

* Build rolling 13-week cash flow forecasts that flag potential problems before they occur  
* Consider the "profit first" model with separate accounts for tax reserves, payroll, and other major obligations  
* Establish clear policies for managing seasonal ups and downs  
* Do a few "health checks" before pulling a line of credit or financing

These systems transform cash management from a reactive exercise into a strategic function.

### 3\. Create Profit Margin Clarity

Get clear on your actual profit margins:

* Calculate true costs for each product, including marketing, sales, materials, labor, overhead  
* Set minimum margin requirements for your pricing  
* Regularly review pricing, especially as labor and material prices change

With this clarity, pricing decisions become strategic rather than emotional. You can also quickly identify underperforming product lines.

### 4\. Define Free Cash Clearly

Establish clear definitions for different types of cash in your business:

* Restricted cash (tax reserves, payroll, loan payments)  
* Working capital requirements (minimum operating cash)  
* True discretionary cash (available for investment or distribution)

This clarity prevents the "money in the account" confusion that leads to poor spending decisions.

When your financial management becomes systematic rather than reactive, it doesn't just prevent problems—it enables strategic growth. 

Marketing can receive consistent investment. Operations can implement efficiency improvements. Sales can price confidently and competitively. And perhaps most importantly, you can sleep at night knowing your financial foundation is solid.

In the next chapter, we'll explore the administrative challenges that often prevent these systems from being implemented effectively, and how to ensure your business infrastructure supports rather than hinders your growth.

# 

# 

# Chapter 6: Admin Problems \- When "Death by 1000 Paper Cuts" Becomes Reality {#chapter-6:-admin-problems---when-"death-by-1000-paper-cuts"-becomes-reality}

Many shed business owners would benefit from a secretary or an administrative assistant. They hesitate because they don't know who to hire, they're not sure it makes financial sense, or they don't know what they'd delegate.

This leads to what I call "death by 1000 paper cuts." It's where owners and key leaders spend hours each week handling minor administrative tasks that, individually, seem too small to delegate, but collectively consume a big part of their time and energy.

While administrative problems might seem less dramatic than sales challenges or production crises, they create a persistent drag on your business that prevents you from focusing on strategic growth. Let's explore these often-overlooked issues and their surprising impact on your overall operation.

## The Owner Bottleneck Problem {#the-owner-bottleneck-problem}

The most common administrative challenge occurs when the owner becomes the default handler of numerous small tasks that don't clearly belong elsewhere in the organization:

* Responding to general inquiry emails  
* Answering basic customer questions  
* Processing routine paperwork  
* Handling vendor relationships  
* Managing minor employee issues

The problem gets worse because each individual task seems too small to justify delegation. "It'll take me longer to explain how to do this than to just do it myself" becomes a motto that keeps owners trapped in administrative quicksand.

The result? Strategic priorities consistently take a back seat to urgent but low-value activities. Business growth stalls not because of market limitations but because the owner's capacity is consumed by administrative details.

## The Sales Distraction Problem {#the-sales-distraction-problem}

This bleeds over to the sales team. If you have internal salespeople, they become the default contact for a wide range of non-sales inquiries:

* Vendor calls  
* General customer service questions  
* Delivery status inquiries

Every minute your sales team spends on these activities is a minute not spent generating revenue. While each interruption might seem minor, the cumulative effect (and the resulting distraction) can significantly reduce sales productivity.

## The Order Processing Bottleneck {#the-order-processing-bottleneck}

Orders need to be processed promptly, making sure they get out to the shop in the right order. If the responsible person can't get to it promptly, several problems emerge:

* Orders sitting unprocessed in inboxes or on desks  
* Inconsistent prioritization creating production scheduling challenges  
* Details getting lost in translation between sales and production  
* Customers left uncertain about order status

Without clear ownership of this function, orders become everyone's responsibility but no one's priority—a recipe for customer disappointment and internal frustration.

## The Communication Breakdown {#the-communication-breakdown}

Administrative challenges often show up as communication failures between departments:

* Production changes not communicated to sales  
* Customer requests not passed to the right department  
* Updated policies not consistently implemented  
* Critical emails buried in overflowing inboxes

These breakdowns aren't usually due to negligence or incompetence but to the absence of systematic communication channels and clear responsibility for information flow.

## How to Fix Admin Problems {#how-to-fix-admin-problems}

Fixing these administrative problems requires systematic approaches rather than piecemeal fixes:

### 1\. Start with Time Tracking

Before making administrative hiring decisions, gather data about where time is actually being spent:

* Have key team members track their activities for 1-2 weeks  
* Identify which tasks are truly strategic versus administrative  
* Quantify the cost of having high-value team members handling low-value tasks  
* Determine which activities could be bundled for delegation

This data-driven approach often reveals that administrative support isn't just affordable—it's financially irresponsible not to have it.

### 2\. Build Ways to Communicate

Create systematic paths for information to flow:

* Clarify what, when, and how information needs to be communicated  
* Use phone systems to route calls to the appropriate person  
* Make information about orders accessible without needing direct communication  
* Schedule regular cross-departmental meetings focused on coordination

"This is very solvable through a phone menu" may sound simplistic, but proper call routing alone can reclaim significant sales capacity for internal sales teams.

### 3\. Consider Flexible Administrative Support

If you're not ready for a full-time position, move beyond the false choice of "full-time employee or nothing":

* Explore part-time administrative assistance  
* Start with contract support to define needs before committing to hiring

These flexible approaches allow you to gradually shift administrative tasks without the pressure of immediately justifying a full-time position. You can hire for someone who wants to start part-time and wants to grow into full-time.

### 4\. Create Clear Ownership of Order Processing

Designate specific responsibility for the critical order-to-production pipeline:

* Create a clear order processing workflow with defined handoffs  
* Assign specific ownership for each stage of the process  
* Set up tracking systems that provide visibility into order status  
* Set up performance metrics for order processing efficiency

If you don't have an admin processing orders and managing some of these day-to-day details, you're going to end up getting buried really quickly. This can be a production manager, depending on their skills and aptitude. But many times, the people who excel in that position do better swinging a hammer and working with the builders.

### 5\. Develop Systematic Delegation

Turn delegation from something you do sometimes to something you do by habit:

* Document key processes to make delegation easier  
* Clearly outline responsibility showing who handles what  
* Regularly review what you're doing to identify new delegation opportunities  
* Build delegation skills in key leaders throughout the organization

In fact, a great secretary can actually help you with many of these things\!

Remember: Effective delegation isn't about abandoning responsibility—it's about focusing your attention on the highest-value activities only you can perform.

When administrative functions run smoothly, the entire organization benefits. Owners can focus on strategic growth. Sales can concentrate on revenue generation. Production gets clear communication about priorities. And customers experience a coherent, efficient process from inquiry to delivery.

Many business owners dismiss administrative challenges as "just the cost of doing business" or "not real problems." But in my experience, these seemingly minor issues often create the persistent friction that prevents good businesses from becoming great ones.

By fixing these administrative problems systematically, you create the foundation for excellence in every other aspect of your business. You free up the time, attention, and mental bandwidth necessary to tackle the bigger strategic challenges that drive sustainable growth.

# Conclusion: The Shed Business Where All the Pieces Work Together {#conclusion:-the-shed-business-where-all-the-pieces-work-together}

Throughout this book, we've explored the problems that hit shed businesses across six critical areas: marketing, sales, operations, logistics, finance, and administration. While we've looked at each area separately for clarity, the most important takeaway is this: **These challenges are all connected.**

The marketing tracking problems in Chapter 1 directly feed the sales accountability issues in Chapter 2\. The sales-production tensions in Chapter 3 create the delivery challenges in Chapter 4\. The financial confusion gaps in Chapter 5 prevent the administrative improvements outlined in Chapter 6\. It's all connected—a reality that becomes obvious once you start systematically addressing these challenges.

## From Bad Cycles to Good Cycles {#from-bad-cycles-to-good-cycles}

What I've seen repeatedly is that businesses typically exist in one of two states:

### 1\. Bad Cycles

Marketing and sales blame each other for poor results. Production and logistics point fingers over delivery problems. Finance becomes a roadblock rather than a helper. Administrative inefficiencies create friction in every department.

### 2\. Good Cycles

Marketing provides qualified leads that sales can confidently pursue. Sales makes promises that production can consistently fulfill. Logistics delivers experiences that reinforce your brand promise. Finance provides clarity that enables strategic decisions. Administrative systems remove friction from every process.

The difference between these states isn't luck or industry conditions—it's systematic integration of your business functions.

## The Change Process {#the-change-process}

The transformation from bad cycles to good cycles follows a predictable pattern:

1. **See the Issue**: Recognize that your challenges aren't isolated problems but symptoms of systemic disconnects  
2. **Build Bridges**: Create connections between departments through shared goals, clear communication channels, and aligned incentives  
3. **Optimize**: Fine-tune each system while maintaining its connections to other business functions  
4. **Accelerate**: Leverage your integrated systems to create competitive advantages and sustainable growth

This process isn't quick or easy, but it is predictable and repeatable. As I've guided shed businesses through it, the results are consistently transformative.

## Your Next Steps {#your-next-steps}

If you recognize your business in the problems we've explored, here are your immediate next steps:

### 1\. Identify Your Most Critical Connection Point

Which departmental interface is causing the most friction in your business right now? Is it marketing-sales, sales-production, production-logistics, or something else? Start there.

### 2\. Implement One Integrated System

Choose one specific system mentioned in this book that would address that connection point, and commit to implementing it properly.

### 3\. Measure the Impact

Document the improvements not just in the primary departments involved but in the ripple effects throughout your organization.

### 4\. Expand Systematically

Once you've experienced success with one integrated system, expand to the next most critical connection point.

Remember: You don't need to transform everything at once. Systematic progress on your most painful points of friction will create momentum for wider changes.

## The Ultimate Outcome {#the-ultimate-outcome}

When your business operates as an integrated system rather than separate departments, the results go far beyond efficiency improvements:

* Owner freedom increases as systems replace constant fire-fighting  
* Team satisfaction improves as cross-departmental tensions dissolve  
* Customer experience becomes consistently excellent rather than occasionally good  
* Profitability grows as waste and friction disappear from your processes  
* Scalability becomes possible as systems replace dependencies on specific people

Most importantly, your business transforms from a source of constant stress into the wealth-building asset you always intended it to be.

If you're ready to accelerate this transformation in your business, I invite you to schedule a complimentary diagnostic call. We'll identify your most critical integration points and develop a specific action plan to address them.

## The Truth About Your Business {#the-truth-about-your-business}

Here's the truth: Your business doesn't have to feel like a constant fire fight. The ups and downs, the tension between departments, the sleepless nights worrying about cash flow—none of these are normal. They're simply symptoms of disconnected systems that can be integrated, optimized, and transformed.

So if you're ready to stop treating symptoms and start building a truly integrated business that runs smoothly even when you're not watching, the time is now. The solutions you've been searching for aren't found in revolutionary new ideas, but in systematic implementation of proven principles that recognize how everything in your business connects.

Your shed business can work. All the pieces can fit together. The question isn't whether it's possible—the question is when you'll begin.

# Bonus: Making Great Hires for Your Shed Company {#bonus:-making-great-hires-for-your-shed-company}

The people you hire can make your life significantly easier or harder. I wanted to share some lessons I’ve learned from my mentors and my experience along the way.

## Become the Leader They Need {#become-the-leader-they-need}

Hiring great employees starts with leadership. Too many employers fail to clearly communicate their vision. They don’t build a place where employees feel empowered to contribute.

It's important to align employee goals with the company's mission. If you can build roles around people's strengths, cultivate a healthy culture, *and* help them achieve their aspirations, you'll significantly increase your chances of success. You’ll also attract high quality people. Of course, you’ll want to screen for people who might take advantage of a supportive environment. Be prepared to address such situations promptly.

Letting go of anyone is tough. I’ve talked to many owners who’ve held on to one team member or vendor for far longer than they should. They’ve had conversations, but it’s just not changing. If you want great people working for you, you need to let go of the people who are dragging everyone else down.

If you have to choose who to keep, it should be the individual who consistently makes your work easier, faster, and more efficient. Why? Because a valuable employee acts as a force multiplier, enabling *you* to focus on things that really move the needle. The right hire is invaluable; their contribution can far outweigh their cost.

But finding the *right* person isn't always simple. Let me share a few lessons along the way.

## Know What You’re Looking For {#know-what-you’re-looking-for}

Before you start, clearly define the role's responsibilities and the skills and qualities needed for success.

Consider what traits are important such as:

* **Reliability:** Consistent attendance and punctuality.  
* **Organization:** Effective time management.  
* **Learning Agility:** Quickly grasps new concepts and adapts to change.  
* **Focus:** Maintains concentration and minimizes distractions.  
* **Conscientiousness:** Takes pride in their work and strives for excellence.

If you’re looking for a counterpart to yourself as the entrepreneur or salesperson, you might look for some of these natural behaviors:

* **Appropriate Attention to Detail:** Accuracy without being bogged down by perfectionism.  
* **Strong Follow-Through:** Completes tasks and honors commitments.  
* **Measured Impulsivity:** Thoughtful decision-making, avoiding rash actions.

Also pay attention to whether they belong in the office or on the shop floor:

* **Mental Work**: Prefers working with computers and paperwork  
* **Practical Application:** Prefers hands-on work and problem-solving.

Finally, think through the types of jobs or experiences they’ve likely had in the past. It’s not a perfect predictor, but it’s reasonable.

## Where to Find Good Help {#where-to-find-good-help}

My mentor once heard a shoplifting prevention consultant say:

* **5% of people will never steal under any circumstances.**  
* **5% of people will always steal if given the chance.**  
* **The other 90% will steal depending on the situation.**

You want to hire from that first 5%—the ones who wouldn’t steal a loaf of bread even if they were starving. Character, ethics, and culture matter more than skills because you can teach skills, but you can’t fix integrity.

Hiring your first employee is intimidating, but the key is knowing where to look for honest, reliable, hardworking people.When my mentor needed his first hire, he told his wife to post on the local homeschool group email list. He was looking for a high school grad who wanted part-time work.

This grad was part of that scrupulously honest 5%—the kind of worker you can trust with anything. When you’re looking to hire, you go where you’re most likely to find the kind of people you want.  
For my mentor, he knew that a conservative homeschool family would produce exactly the kind of responsible, hardworking person he needed.

A typical public school in a typical city would not. That first hire has been with my mentor for over 10 years.

I’ve used this same hiring method with great success, especially when starting out. A text to a friend of mine yielded an administrative assistant who was worth her weight in gold. If she hadn’t wanted to spend more time with family, she would have been with us today.

## Avoid Hiring These Types of People {#avoid-hiring-these-types-of-people}

You do NOT want to hire someone who:

* **Looks up to you too much** – A helper should respect your work, but not be in awe of you. You need a worker, not a fan.  
* **Brings drama** – If they constantly have life problems spilling into work, they will slow you down.  
* **Is just looking for a paycheck** – They need to actually want to be good at their job.  
* **Is looking to start their own business –** They need to see this as a career (3 years or longer).


## Don’t Depend Only on Interviews {#don’t-depend-only-on-interviews}

There’s an old hiring mistake: people hire someone they like instead of someone who can **do the job**.

You don’t have to hire based on an interview. Instead, try this approach.

**Pay them to do work instead of just interviewing or checking resumes**. You can have applicants do a task that mirrors real work they’d do. If you expect them to swing a hammer, you might even pay them to spend half a day or a day out in the shop.

This lets you judge them by their work, not their words.	

## The \#1 Criteria & How to Catch Bad Character {#the-#1-criteria-&-how-to-catch-bad-character}

After I shared this document with a number of manufacturers, Micheal Stahl from Stahl Structures wrote in and told me, “The most important thing we look for in an employee is character. It's like the foundation of the house. Everything else comes second.”

The employee might slip through the cracks of the character test. But even if they do, it’s almost impossible to maintain a different persona for any period of time. He said, “It usually takes 2 to 10 days to spot a fake.”

This is another argument for doing an “audition” or a trial period. 

It reminded me of advice from a professional gambler turned salesperson. I’m pretty judicious about the personal advice I take from this individual. However, when it comes to reading people’s character, I can think of few people with more street smarts.

He had a special test for new hires. He would always take them out to eat twice before hiring them. He would pay special attention to how long they would take to order, and how they treated the waitress or waiter. He said, “People can hide psychosis for a meal or an interview, but never two meals.”

The same rule applies when hiring remotely, except it takes 6 meetings instead of 2 meals.

## A Litany of Lessons from Life on the Streets {#a-litany-of-lessons-from-life-on-the-streets}

One of my friends recently asked me about more lessons, so I shared them in no particular order:

* Business owners who actually have a heart usually take waaaaay too long to fire; be proactive with settings expectations, communicating when they're not met, and terminating if changes don't happen

* The longer something has been going on, the longer it will continue. If someone hasn't changed for 3 months, odds are they won't for the next 3 months unless some dramatic catastrophe occurs; give people chances where needed but don't lie to yourself if they won't

* People are generally conscientious everywhere or conscientious nowhere; find and hire the people who are conscientious.

* Conscientious people hang out with each other (birds of a feather) \- go find the kinds of people who are hardworking and ask them for job candidate referrals

* Give people a chance to prove themselves doing the actual work before committing long-term if possible; lots of people sell themselves into a job in an interview by saying the right things, but are completely upside-down when they start work

* There are things like the Kolbe index (I'm certified; I can answer questions) or Predictive Index, etc that you can use to make a good prediction if the kind of work lines up with the person doing them

* If you keep running into issues with your hires, don't hire alone. If you're strong on reason, find someone to do a "gut check". If you're strong on intuition, have someone do a "brain check".

* Wherever you've mis-hired, take time to think about what went sideways, then build it into your hiring and screening process

* Be careful when chasing employees harder than they chase you, unless they are genuinely in high demand (most times, they just don't care that much; find the people who are hungry to work)

* When you interview, don't just gauge the answers \- but also gauge the hunger.

* Interview people from experience as much as possible (when was a time when you \<exhibited behavior\>). Also have them do those things for times when things didn't go their way ("tell me about a time you made a major mistake for your employer, and how you handled it" etc)

Then there are other practical things you can put in place…

* For example in finance, don't let the person who writes the checks, do the books. Create a layer of separation and accountability. It'll save them from your suspicion. It will save you from their possible embezzlement. Some folks disagree, but I think it's best for everyone

# Ready to Stop Fighting Fires? {#ready-to-stop-fighting-fires?}

You've read about the problems. You've seen the patterns. You recognize your business in these pages.

Now what?  
The truth is, knowing what's wrong is only half the battle. The other half is figuring out what to do about it in your specific situation.

That's where I come in.

My name is Matthias Miller. I've spent years working with shed business owners just like you. I've seen businesses transform from constant fire-fighting to predictable growth. I've watched owners go from working 70-hour weeks to actually taking vacations. I've helped companies add millions in revenue by fixing the connections between their departments.

But here's what I've learned: No two businesses are exactly alike.

Your dealer relationships are different. Your production setup is unique. Your cash flow challenges are specific to your situation. Your team dynamics are yours alone.

Generic solutions don't work. You need a plan that fits your reality.

## What Happens When We Talk {#what-happens-when-we-talk}

When we have our conversation, here's what you can expect:

**First**, I'll listen. Really listen. To understand your specific situation, your biggest frustrations, and what you've already tried.

**Second**, I'll ask questions you probably haven't thought of. Questions that help identify the root causes, not just the symptoms.

**Third**, I'll show you exactly which of these problems are costing you the most money and causing the most stress in your business.

**Finally**, I'll outline a specific plan for your situation. Not generic advice, but concrete next steps that make sense for your business, your team, and your budget.

## This Isn't for Everyone {#this-isn't-for-everyone}

I only work with business owners who are serious about change. People who are tired of the same problems recurring month after month. Owners who are ready to invest time and resources into building systems that actually work.

If you're looking for a magic bullet or a quick fix, I'm not your guy.

But if you're ready to do the work to build a business that runs smoothly without your constant attention, then we should talk.

## Here's What to Do Next {#here's-what-to-do-next}

If you see your business in this book and you're ready to stop fighting fires, let's have a conversation.

It's a simple diagnostic call. No pressure, no sales pitch. Just a straightforward discussion about your business and whether working together makes sense.

During our call, you'll walk away with at least three specific insights about your business, regardless of whether we decide to work together.

**To schedule your call, reach out to me directly:**  
719-430-7102

## One More Thing {#one-more-thing}

Remember, you got this book because we talked. That conversation started something. Don't let it end here.

The problems in your business won't fix themselves. The dealer conflicts won't resolve on their own. The cash flow stress won't disappear by hoping.

But they can be fixed. Systematically. Predictably.  
I know because I've seen it happen hundreds of times.

The question isn't whether your business can be transformed. The question is when you'll decide to start.

Let's talk soon.

*P.S. \- Don't wait until next busy season to address these issues. The best time to fix your systems is when you have the mental bandwidth to think clearly about them. That time is now.*
