[METAPHOR I](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnNZFILgc9DlEsmY20Mcph-bxkM9CAGb0bnt2RxduTY/edit?disco=AAAAAztgjJc)

THE THOUGHTS plagued him.

All day long they plagued him like he was 17th century London. And they exhausted him, too. Tired he went to sleep and tired he woke up. He couldn’t escape them--the thoughts. They were killing him and there was no cure.

It wouldn’t take long, though: there wasn’t much left of him to kill.

[METAPHOR II](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnNZFILgc9DlEsmY20Mcph-bxkM9CAGb0bnt2RxduTY/edit?disco=AAAAAztgjJg)

THE THOUGHTS plagued him. All day long they plagued him. Nothing he tried sterilized the despair spreading through the streets of his soul. 

This frustrated him and added to his torment, a friction and a pressure. Slowly, the heat rose and the pressure intensified until ignition. For all his determination and grit, Jack Martin was burning out. 

London was on fire.

[METAPHOR III](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnNZFILgc9DlEsmY20Mcph-bxkM9CAGb0bnt2RxduTY/edit?disco=AAAAAztgjJk)

The plaguing thoughts, always lingering in the shadows of his mind, pounced immediately. 

*“You failure. They’re unhappy. She’s unhappy. What can you do now? Nothing.”*

[METAPHOR IV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnNZFILgc9DlEsmY20Mcph-bxkM9CAGb0bnt2RxduTY/edit?disco=AAAAAztgjJs)

*“So much for working harder, Jack Martin. You can’t keep up. You’re certainly not helping.”*

LONDON BLAZED all the more.

A MAN feels despair when his thoughts tell him he’s not enough. He feels anger when his heart tells him that he *is* enough but fails to provide proof for it.

In his heart, Jack knew he had what it took to run a successful--even great--mechanic shop, but his mind screamed to the contrary and had all the evidence to prove he would never make it.

It is this internal friction that consumes a man until it takes him out.

Jack made it to the church banquet. He escorted his beautiful wife to their seats. He smiled and chatted like everything was all right with Mr. Martin.

But inside he burned.

[METAPHOR VI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OjNq2Sic2_ftg52EnDte168rcbwFUCmu7Bf5pHh_SM/edit?disco=AAAAAzvF6G4)

It was all Jack could do to hold his tongue. It was all Jack could to do to not give in to the thoughts screaming in his head.

[METAPHOR VII](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OjNq2Sic2_ftg52EnDte168rcbwFUCmu7Bf5pHh_SM/edit?disco=AAAAAzvF6HA)

So he continued to shun his despair to the darkest alleys of his soul. 

Still, the fire within him intensified.

[METAPHOR VIII](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OjNq2Sic2_ftg52EnDte168rcbwFUCmu7Bf5pHh_SM/edit?disco=AAAAAzvF6HM)

*“I’m disappointed in you, Jack.”* 

*Riley’s face floated before him, vivid yet vague only as a dream can do.* 

*“Why can’t you do better?”*

*“I’m trying\!” Jack shouted in his dream. “You just don’t understand what it takes to run a business. It takes hard work, lots of hard work--and patience, Ri\!  But I’m trying\! Just give me a break.”*

“Give me a break\!”

[METAPHOR IX](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OjNq2Sic2_ftg52EnDte168rcbwFUCmu7Bf5pHh_SM/edit?disco=AAAAAzvF6HQ)

“I’ve been in your shoes, son. I know that frustration. You’re up against a wall that you can’t identify let alone get around and it’s creating a lot of friction inside you. I saw the look in your eye. I felt it in your mood. I heard it in your voice. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to burn-up and burn-out.”

METAPHOR X

Jack was beginning to feel uncomfortable. The old man was digging too deep. They both knew it. Underneath Jack’s thick veneer lie a city plagued by failure, fire, and inadequacy. Jack’s soul, diseased and burning, screamed in terror at the idea of being found out. So Jack ran away to distract--in any way possible--the old man from what was really going on.

The old man eyed Jack tenderly. A new fire blazed in the younger man’s eyes. Whether good or bad, he couldn’t tell yet. He felt compassion for the mechanic because he had been there, too, many years ago. He would let Jack play his little games for now, but eventually Jack would need to tear away the veneer or suffocate.

---

THE THOUGHTS still plague Jack. The fire rages wildly, not yet under control. Fate, it seems, gives an unbearable load to the already downtrodden. 

But history reminds us of hope.

The fire saved London from plague.
