On the mastermind book:

Tension: *Why should I read this book?*

* By biggest struggle is with the lack of tension. On one hand, it’s an informational book. On the other, it’s a story. How do we keep the tension up and the story moving, while taking long pauses for dialogue to communicate the message of each chapter?

The heart of it: *Make me care.*

* Extending from that, capturing the reader’s heart is hard too. It seems trite to have an accident and kill one of the characters. I mean, everyone does that.  
* I’ve thought of giving Jack a heart-attack, especially in the context of him being too busy. That would force him to take a rest, slow down, and reconsider his life a bit.  
* I’ve thought of somehow making him lose his shop. That would grab his attention. Force him to nurture his family and seek out counsel.  
* My conclusion is to just amp up the tension between him and his wife.  
* Perhaps the house could burn down in/after [this scene, page 14](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdcR8IxO3BmNEG_Y_MCJEI8vT9qsF2Q3ULBvQS9tcTk/edit?disco=w21v4vd4hmeu).

Speaking of marriage struggles:

* The current “Chapter 6” had previously been “Chapter 5,” but I swapped them around. The happiness in current [chapter 6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ApgRI5_B_rdqfCiWf-_b2uqc5uZfNtAvTRgudUuk7eY/edit) seemed like a resolution, which should be towards the end, if not at the very end. But I wasn’t sure how to restructure the story to make it work at the end.  
* Perhaps you have insight into this?

Story Structure:

* Originally, was thinking of having each conversation over the breakfast table at the cafe. But then some other things came to me and I started playing around with scenes outside of that context.  
* I think breaking them out of the cafe--at the park, at Jack’s house, in the garden--could great ways to keep the story moving. Conversations like this often happen over the natural processes of life anyway, so that seems more natural. It would be easier to put in tension, inciting force, resolution into that style, too.  
* I like the metaphors, but perhaps they’re just distracting.
