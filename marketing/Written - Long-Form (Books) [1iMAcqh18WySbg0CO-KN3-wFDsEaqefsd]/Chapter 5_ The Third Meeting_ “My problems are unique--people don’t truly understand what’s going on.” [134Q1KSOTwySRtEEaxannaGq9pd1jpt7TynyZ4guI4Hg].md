**Chapter 5: The Third Meeting**  
***“My problems are unique--people don’t truly understand.”***

*“GOOD-BYE kids\! See you next month\!” Mr. Young said to his students as they ran out the door. Only a few responded “Goodbye\!” None said “Thank-you\!” Most didn’t even acknowledge his presence.*

*The first year teacher shut the door and sank down into his chair, exasperated from the long, strenuous week and month and year. He could still hear the rush of students running out the front entrance, voices cheering for the holidays, feet stomping down the hall, doors slamming shut.* 

*Mr. Young wondered whether a career in teaching had been a mistake. So far it had been miserable. He went over the day, trying to figure out what he could have done better. How he could have calmed the unruly fourth grade men vying for leadership. Encouraging giggles from girls were evidently much higher priorities for nine and ten year old boys than the history lesson or its teacher.*

*But, no matter, the Christmas season had arrived, which meant a two-and-a-half week break before he would have to again compete for the attention of the little fourth grade warriors and giggling queens.* 

*The young teacher closed his eyes as the noise from the halls quieted. He sighed with relief at the thought of two weeks home alone with his own Queen. And tomorrow, he would join his comrades for one last Mastermind before the break. That was good. He enjoyed getting together with his new business friends. He liked the perspective they brought to his life and fledgling career, even though sharing his struggles always scared him. Perhaps they could help him solve this fourth-grade riddle.*

“MORNING, JACK\!” the old man exclaimed at the arrival of his friend.

Jack stopped furrowed his brow and stared at the empty table. Since he was usually the last one to arrive, it confused him why his old friend sat alone around their table. 

“Where’s everybody else?” he inquired.

“They all had other things going, so I guess it’s just you and me today.”

“Okay,” Jack said with an amused grin. “Fine with me. So what are we talking about this morning?”

“Your friends\!” the old man said with an extra chipperness in his voice.

“My friends? What about my friends?”

“Can you talk to them?”

“Well, I talk to you, don’t I?” Jack threw back.

The old man chuckled, “Oh, mercy, what a boring life you must lead\!”

Jack grinned to himself as he looked over the menu.

“No, I mean your peers--people young enough to still be doing life and business--your friends who *didn’t* watch the moon landing. Are you able to talk to them about stuff?”

“Yeah, I talk to them, I guess.”

“He guesses,” the old man humphed to the waitress just walking up.

“I’ll have my usual, Connie,” he told the waitress. “And you’re paying,” he informed the younger man.

“Oh, really now?” Jack raised his eyebrows in mock surprise.

They finished ordering and continued their conversation.

“You have to understand: I don’t know very many people who face the same kind of problems that I do,” Jack confessed. “Nobody will understand anyway, so how could it be helpful to share my struggles.”

“How do you know no one will understand? Have you tried?”

Jack thought for a while.

“It’s just--a lot of the people at church don’t know what it takes to run a repair shop. My neighbors don’t talk to each other, so I don’t really know them. And most of my business friends don’t understand why I value church, or family, or people like you,” Jack pointed at his friend with a chuckle. The old man laughed heartily.

“Most people don’t understand people like me,” he said. “I’m used to it by now.”

Connie the waitress set their drinks in front of them.

“But have you ever actually taken them out for coffee and shared your stories and struggles and listened to theirs?” the old man asked.

Jack shrugged, “I guess not.”

“You might be surprised who actually does understand you. That’s what happened with Trev.”

“Trev from your group? I was wondering when we’d get to him.”

“Yup. When he first started coming, it scared him out of his mind to share his struggles.”

Jack nodded in agreement, “No kidding.”

“Trev was struggling with a problem that really had him down. Barely four months into his teaching career, he already felt burned out and at his wits end. He even questioned whether teaching was really for him.

“He had hesitated to share his struggles all fall because it embarrassed him to be so helpless in solving a problem he should have been able to fix--as a trained teacher and all.

“But the thing that really got him down was a nagging doubt whether he had chosen the right career. Imagine it, he questioned a choice which had affected the last four-and-a-half years of his life. It embarrassed him, I think.

“Finally, having tried everything for an entire semester, he determined to bring up both his problem and his restlessness at our final meeting before Christmas. He was still working up the courage to spill all his guts when Carl told us a story from the cockpit. Of all people, it connected with Trev.”

*“DID I ever tell you how I learned to manage my energy during long commercial flights?” the pilot asked.*

*The young teacher leaned in. He had determined to share everything with this group of wise men: his embarrassingly small problem of keeping the attention of fourth-grade students. He also decided, at the strong encouragement of his wife, to share his regret over becoming a teacher.*

*But at this point, it relieved him to have a few extra moments of reprieve while the pilot, Carl, recounted one of his many stories. Sharing always terrified him. None of these guys were teachers: how could they understand his problem? Besides, they were all smart and experienced. It embarrassed him to admit struggling over an issue for so long with so little results.*

*“So, I struggled to keep my energy levels up for many years after becoming a commercial pilot,” Carl was saying. “I didn’t face it as much during the war, so I didn’t know how to deal with it.*

*“One flight to London was especially bad. I was drinking coffee and peeing so much, that the attendants started giggling every time I left the cockpit. You can imagine how my co-pilot made fun of me\!*

*“From that point on, I began searching for a solution to my problem. Airlines didn’t have a lot of protocol when it came to this kind of stuff back then, so I had to figure it out on my own.*

*“I started by cutting out all television in the evenings before my flights. At first, I cut it out every other flight and I would record how I slept the night I watched television versus the night I didn’t. And I logged how I felt throughout the following flight and so on. I kept track like this for several months and began noticing a subtle difference.*

*“The nights I watched television, it took me longer to settle down and fall asleep. Subsequently, it took me longer to wake up the next morning as well. The days and flights following were groggier in general--not significantly, but when I noticed them week after week in my journal, there was definitely a pattern.*

*“After I concluded not watching television improved my sleep, I tried two other things which especially improved my energy during long flights.*

*“I started avoiding newspapers the morning of my flight, and instead spent that time either exercising or reading to relax my brain instead of working it.*

*“I began eating nutrient rich meals before hand: lots of meat, vegetables, and fruits. I also made sure to snack well during the flight, instead of drinking soda and coffee, I began drinking primarily water and healthy snacks.*

*“No more dozing off during those long flights after that. I slept like a rock at night, too.” Carl concluded the story and the meeting moved on.* 

*Listening to Carl explain what he learned about managing his energy, Trev suddenly had an idea about how to help his kids stay engaged in his class.*

*Perhaps their problem wasn’t that his lessons weren’t engaging enough (which certainly may have been part of it). Perhaps their problem was pent up energy mixed with tiredness keeping their minds from being focused.* 

*He could chalk it up to being merely fourth-grade antics. But perhaps a lack of proper exercise, fresh-air, restful sleep combined with fourth-grade restlessness, rendered their minds incapable of focusing on learning.* 

*“Their minds are tired but their bodies energetic,” Trev thought to himself.*

“SUDDENLY, OUR young teacher felt a new energy and vigor for his class and career he hadn’t previously known. He now had a theory that could possibly not only resolve his frustration, but actually *help* the children and their parents,” the old man explained.

“How did he do it?” Jack asked.

“He started with television, figuring it to be the primary problem among his kids. He thought getting that out of the way should be his first priority.

“So here’s what he did. Each kid who could verify they hadn’t watched any T.V. or ninetendo the previous night went home with no homework.”

Jack’s mouth dropped open, “No homework?\!” he exclaimed.

“With no homework. He figured attention in class was more important than whatever more they’d learn through homework. Furthermore, if they could prove from friends or family that they spent significant time playing or working outside, they received extra credit. He verified this by signed papers from parents along with testimonies from friends--that kind of thing.

“He found this worked quite effectively with most of the kids. Of course there were the couch potatoes who liked their T.V., but even they usually found it hard to turn down a chance to skip  homework.

“He also petitioned the school to provide healthier but tasty meals, which proved harder than he anticipated. In the end, though, they saw the value and tried his experiment. He made nutritious snacks a routine part of the classroom. He fostered all of these new measures by giving incentives such as no homework, extra field trips, free days, and the like.

“It’s amazingly simple, but expelling the pent-up restlessness by encouraging physical exercise helped all of them, especially the couch potatoes, to have dramatically better attention spans. They improved even to the point that kids who had been failing, started getting C’s. Along with this, the students were much more responsive to his attempts at reining them in--even when the girls were giggling at the boy’s.

“Wow\!” Jack exclaimed. “That’s quite cutting edge for--when was this, the eighties?”

“Yes, it was,” the old man agreed. “But Trev was only interested in helping the kids.

The breakfast arrived and the two men set to work consuming the food.

“But the thing I wanted to point out to you today was not how smart or cutting edge Trev was,” the old man went on. “You say, Jack, people can’t understand your problems. Your problems are too unique. But who’s more different from each other than a teacher and an airline pilot?”

“You wouldn’t think they could learn from each other,” Jack agreed, taking a bite out of his toast.

“No, you wouldn’t. Yet a random story from the cockpit spawned an incredible breakthrough for a *teacher*. Never underestimate the experiences of your friends and peers, Jack. You never know who you might learn from. Who knows, you might even learn about your business from me\!” the old man chuckled as he dove into his eggs and hashbrowns.

The old man continued speaking, despite the food in his mouth. “Trev’s school became one of the most successful in developing healthy and smart students as a direct result of his initiatives. Grades went up while the amount of time spent in detention and suspensions went down. Trev was a good fifteen years ahead of himself and is now an award winning teacher.” 

Wiping the corners of his mouth, the old mentor looked at Jack and grinning said, “It was all because he involved himself in a strong community of thinkers and doers.”

“Speaking of doing,” Jack said. “I need you to come help me remove a stake tonight.”

“Oh?” the older man said, interested. “And you want the old buffer to come throw his back out?”

“No, I need strong community to give me moral support while I sweat my brains out,” Jack said with a twinkle. “Besides, it’s been awhile since you were at our place for dinner. It’s time you come over again.”

“I’d love to\!”

“STRONG COMMUNITY,” Jack stated through heavy breaths. “You’ve mentioned it several times now.”

“Yup,” the old man grunted as he shoveled dirt away from the stake.

“What is it?” Jack asked.

“It’s all the stuff,” his mentor said. “Everything we’ve been talking about the last few weeks. It’s your friends, the people you go on the adventure of life with, your family, your wife.”

The old man paused, noticing Jack’s hesitation at the mention of his wife.

He leaned on his shovel and asked, “Somethin’ wrong between you and Riley?”

“Ah, it’s nothing,” Jack said, wiping the sweat from his forehead, making it even dirtier.

His mentor raised an eyebrow, “That’s what they all say.”

Jack began heaving at the stubborn stake again.

“Why do you have this stupid stake in here anyways?” the old man asked as he continued his shoveling.

“I don’t even remember,” Jack said. Grunting, he pushed and pulled the stake around and around to loosen it. 

“All I know is that,” he paused, pulling with all his might. The stake suddenly broke loose, sending him off-balance and right onto his rear. “It’s a pain in the ass,” he finished.

Jack’s mentor doubled over with laughter.

“So hilarious,” Jack groaned as he sat in the dirt. “My tailbone is gonna be sore for days.”

“Pain is just weakness leaving the body,” the old man said, giving Jack a hand up. “At least, that’s what your mom said when she gave you birth.”

They both laughed. It felt freeing for Jack to laugh.

After they were done chuckling over their jokes, they grabbed the newly uprooted stake and started back toward the house. 

For the first time in a long time, Jack started to feel hopeful. If a school teacher could take a fighter pilot’s tales and calm a room of rowdy kids, maybe there was hope for him to get out of this mess. 

Sensing his hope, the elder put his hand on Jack’s shoulder, and said, “Making Riley happy and content is your most important responsibility. She’s your lifesaver, Jack. Don’t neglect her.”
