7 Basic Things that Happen in Every Story

1. A Character/HERO: within 3 minutes, we have to know that character wants something (this is the customer)  
2. A PROBLEM: keeps them from getting what they want; it needs to be defined  
   External Problem (e.g. needs a car)  
   Internal Problem (e.g. afraid of getting ripped off) → you want to resolve this problem  
3. A GUIDE: steps in, (Yoda, Obi-Wan, Hamich; customers are looking for a guide, not another hero)  
4. Guide gives simple PLAN: “Trust the force” “endear sponsors” etc  
5. Guide calls hero to ACTION: moment of crisis, hero needs to take action or things won’t go well  
6. Success

	or

7. Failure  
   *\---\> STAKES: no stakes, not interested*

**In writing books:**  
*The reader is only interested as long as he remains the hero. You’re the guide helping the hero.*

Answer these questions:

1. *What problem is my hero (the reader) facing?*  
2. *What is at stake? (If there are no stakes, reader won’t stay interested)*  
3. *What is the plan to overcome the problem?*  
4. *What action does the reader need to take?*  
5. *What will happen if the reader takes this action?*  
6. *What will happen if the reader doesn’t?*

*Tension, tension, tension. Build tension. Get them on the edge of their seats. Make them WANT the answer. Don’t spill the beans right away. Don’t resolve the tension until the end. As soon as the tension is gone, so is the reader. The book is closed, there’s no reason to pick it up again.*

Suggestion:

- *Come up with one-liner that explains the problem, solution, and successful result of the entire book and keep that in front of you as you right.*
