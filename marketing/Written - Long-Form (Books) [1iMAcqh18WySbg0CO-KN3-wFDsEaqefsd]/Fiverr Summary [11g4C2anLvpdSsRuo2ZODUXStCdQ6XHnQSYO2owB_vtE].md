**Chapter 1:**  
1\. It did a good job of setting up the story  
2\. It set the scene  
3\. liked the descriptions and thoughts of the internal friction going on with Jack  
4\. Least fav. I wasn't sure what the story was about, and it didn't give me enough clues. It could also maybe improve a bit in capturing the reader's attention, and also promote the benefits of reading this book (these could however be listed on the back or cover of the book)  
5\. Found chapter 1 it a bit lengthy and not as attention-grabbing as all the other chapters. Some details I would consider as irrelevant.

**Chapter 2:**  
2\. Redundant in showing wife upset. Needs tightened.  
4\. Least fav. I wasn't sure what the story was about, and it didn't give me enough clues. It could also maybe improve a bit in capturing the reader's attention, and also promote the benefits of reading this book (these could however be listed on the back or cover of the book)  
5\. Hooked me to read the book

**Chapter 3:**  
3\. A little long winded but still good.  
4\. Favorite

**Chapter 4:**

2\. Shows bond between Jack and old man. 

**Chapter 5:**  
3\. Didn’t necessarily like the beginning of it with the young teacher. A little random or out of place. 

**Chapter 6:**  
1\. Showed tangible examples of Jack’s connection with his family and employees; showed  
his growth and maturity

**Chapter 7:**  
1\. Showed tangible examples of Jack’s connection with his family and employees; showed  
his growth and maturity

**Chapter 8:**  
1\. Left too many loose ends. Confusing  
4\. Favorite  
5\. Liked: The “touching” ending (chapter 8\)

**Epilogue:**  
1\. Should be a prologue  
4\. Favorite

\---  
3\. Great flow throughout the book.  
4\. I got a bit confused with the names during the first few chapters.  
5\. Include a list of characters at the beginning before the story starts, so that the reader gets already familiar with the main characters
