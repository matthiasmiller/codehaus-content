**Key Takeaway:**

As a business owner, we face all kinds of friction points that we take for granted. But when we proactively eliminate unnecessary friction, growth happens.

**Questions:**

1. Isn’t friction a normal thing?  
2. What are some examples of misalignment that you’ve seen between a manufacturer and a subcontractor:  
3. What about misalignment between sales & marketing?  
4. What about misalignment between sales & production?  
5. What about grumpy and whiny dealers or salespeople?  
6. What is the difference between a sales-led vs. a production-led company culture?
