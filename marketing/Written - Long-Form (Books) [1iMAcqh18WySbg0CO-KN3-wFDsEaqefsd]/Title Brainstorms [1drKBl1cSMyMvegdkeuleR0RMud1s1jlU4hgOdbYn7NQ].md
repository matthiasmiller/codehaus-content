Looking for a title that captures interest, essence, and is relatively unique (if not completely). I’d like at least 3 titles/subtitles we feel good about.

1. “Team of Giants”  
   1. Circle of Giants  
   2. Troop of Titans  
2. The Masterminds  
   1. Mighty Men  
   2. The Company (a pun?=))  
      1. Company: Why Business People Can’t Succeed Alone  
   3. In the Company of \_\_\_\_\_\_  
   4. Comrades in Arms  
3. Iron sharpening \- with iron sharpening iron idea subtitle  
   1. Iron Will Business  
   2. Businesses of Iron  
   3. Business of Steel  
   4. The Iron Will Company  
4. Let's Go Build Your Business  
5. The Noncompete Advantage...haha  
6. **Winning Together** … sub1? … A parable of the power of collaboration in business  
7. The Success vortex \- why accelerated business success never happens alone 

Subtitle:

1. Why Great Business Leaders Surround Themselves With Other Business Giants  
2. *Something about a “fable” or “tale”*   
   1. How Great Men Build Great Men   
   2. A Parable on the Power of Contribution  
   3. Why Great Business Men Need Each Other  
3. Why Great Business Men are Stronger Together  
   1. Why Great Businesses Are Stronger Together  
   2. Why Great Businesses Link Arms/Join Forces to Win

\#2 and \#2 would go well together, IMO
