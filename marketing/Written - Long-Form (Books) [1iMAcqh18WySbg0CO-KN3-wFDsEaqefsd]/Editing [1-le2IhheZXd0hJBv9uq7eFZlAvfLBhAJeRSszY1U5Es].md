**Editing Notes**

On editing:

1. Read through entire thing out-loud, once?  
2. \[Go through this, giving scenarios, examples, thoughts that reinforce a connection with entrepreneurs/businesspeople. Make sure your “cargo is engaged.” Build tension, tension, tension. Make sure they want an answer.\]    
3. Give examples of him going to seminars, workshops, reading books, etc.  
4. Start the story out small. End big. Like a scene in a movie, focus on two people, then turns around and there's a big panorama or something.

Simple mechanics:

1. Pore over the entire document, remove most/all passive sentences and reforming them into active sentences. Keep in mind, while editing dialogue, that people tend to talk in passive sentences, so don’t rip apart natural dialogue. Keep it natural, but keep it engaging.  
2. Keep tabs of the rhythm between short, punchy (not choppy) sentences and complex, compound sentences which can make the writing more dynamic if not overdone.  
3. Remember to make things realistic. Don’t narrate through people’s thoughts. That’s not realistic. Don’t narrate through conversation, unless one of them was out of the loop, or they’re discussing/resolving part of the incident. People don’t narrate to each other something they both experienced.  
4. Make sure each chapter has a coherent theme, storyline, structure, that fits into the overarching theme, storyline, structure.

About the theme:

1. Build tension.  
2. Explore and develop how the masterminds work and the power they possess  
3. Remember to bring the metaphor in throughout the story

Storyline:

1. Cafe is on Lewis Street \- make this known earlier  
2. Jack has racked up considerable debt \- make this known earlier  
3. Play up Charlie’s love for talking. Make it the comic relief.  
4. Bring in the 'hot-seat' earlier in the story, first couple chapters  
5. Throw in some scenes where Jack is lost in thought  
6. Put in a scene working in the garden together. Jack is pulling a stake out of the ground (symbolizes how stuck he feels) pulls, pulls, and then it releases and he falls on his butt (symbolizing how he’s freed).

Notes from the text:

* Play this up throughout the story: *“You have to understand: I don’t know very many people who face the same kind of problems that I do,” Jack confessed. “Nobody will understand, so how could it be helpful to share my struggles.”*  
* Come back to the thing of “bringing change” as the essence of an entrepreneur. Cal and his friends are attempting to transform culture through the political party. Some of them did it through business and teaching. Cal did it through pastoring(?). (And another mysterious thing that he never talks about.) From Matthias: The tie-in to the political story & movement is that the essence of the entrepreneur is the one who is bent on bringing change. Business becomes the place where he starts a movement that serves people, while giving him the control to set his own destiny. (?)
