## Testimonial

“Winning Together met me right where I was in many ways: too busy, distracted by the daily whirlwind, and frustrated by how my personal life was aﬀected by the challenges I faced at work.

This parable communicated practical solutions to the problems that I was facing in a way that was easy to understand.

You will find yourself drawn in by the real-life challenges and the solutions that Jack found.

A great book on the journey to successful leadership.”
