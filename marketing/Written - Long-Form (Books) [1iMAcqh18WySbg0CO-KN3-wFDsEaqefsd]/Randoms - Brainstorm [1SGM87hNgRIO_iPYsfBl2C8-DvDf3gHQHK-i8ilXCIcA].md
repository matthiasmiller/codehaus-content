**Week 1**  
Examples:

* “I attended a Network Marketing event, and they sold me all this motivational tapes, and I felt good for a while, but it never lasted.”  
* Or, “I attended an event, expecting content, but instead got a sales pitch for a much more expensive program or product. And I wasn’t able to use the stuff I got, because it was incomplete.”  
* “Someone sold me a training for a lot of money, but I never benefited.”  
  * *Some people are overcharging and not all trainings are helpful.*  
  * *Sometimes trainings aren’t aligned with your values or who you are.*  
  * *Sometimes your business or leadership isn’t in a place to fully* leverage *the things you’re learning.*  
  * *You don’t have to apply everything from every training or book. You only need 1 or 2 things that you can apply really well.*

---

* The “time” aspect is kind of like this: “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” (Lincoln did not say this)  
  * For example, you can just hire people off the street and see who works out. Or, you can learn from others about what kind of person would be the best fit, how to identify them, questions to ask in the interview process, and find the right person on the first or second try.  
  * For example, we typically hire people like ourselves, and for entrepreneurs, these are often not great bookkeepers because they tend to be “all over the place”  
  * (There are two costs: the cost of learning from someone else, and the cost of trial and error for yourself.)  
    * Learn 1\. from people around you 2\. Through experience  
  * If something is taking you an extraordinary amount of time or effort, it MIGHT be doing it wrong, or that your tool isn’t sharp  
* The tie-in to the political story & movement is that the essence of the entrepreneur is the one who is bent on bringing change. Business becomes the place where he starts a movement that serves people, while giving him the control to set his own destiny. (?)

**Week 2**  
Examples:

* “Grinding it out” doesn’t necessarily mean working 80-hour weeks, despite common assumption.  
* We all have a certain amount of busywork in our lives that could easily be eliminated \-  
  * Running to the post office,   
  * buying toilet paper, etc.   
  * paying the bills,   
  * doing payroll,   
  * filing paperwork,   
  * mailing invoices etc.  
* If you’re working long hours, you’re probably doing work that you could hire someone else to do, while you could be spending THAT time growing your business.

* There are two freeing dimensions to it:  
  * 1\. Literal **TIME** that gets freed up  
  * 2\. The **FOCUS** (by not needing to remember everything)  
* This would be an example:  
  * *“I’m too busy doing things to train someone else to do them, so I’m always taking over for other people so that we can finish up projects and get them out the door and keep customers happy and keep making money.”*  
  * However, once Kip learns that he’s capping his business because he’s not able to grow past his own limitations, he starts seeing mentoring as a way to INVEST in the business.  
  * If he’s not worried about wrapping up loose ends, he can think about bigger questions such as, *“Finding more ways to serve customers, growing the team, increasing productivity, getting more customers, etc.”*

The 80/20 rule \= “not all time is created equal.” 

* 80% of our *outcome* results from 20% of your *work*.  
  * 20% of your work brings 80% of your results  
  * This means that 80% of your value comes from maybe 8 hours of your 40 hour work week. The other 32 hours, you’re doing little things necessary to do, but do very little to drive your business forward.  
  * Problem isn’t that you have too little time. Problem is that you’re spending your time doing things that aren’t valuable to your business.   
  * Identify which 8 hours spread throughout your week drive your business forward, capitalize on them. This is crucial to living a healthy life as a business owner.


* Examples:  
  * Stop running mail to the post office. This frees up a slice of your time.   
    * Replace that by doing something that drives your business forward. Give where you’re at on the growth scale.   
      * networking,   
      * prospecting or  
      * selling, if you’re early in the process  
      * or it be higher-level strategic objectives if you’re a bigger business.  
  * Make it a *habit* and a lifestyle of letting go of the “low value” things.


* To take it further:  
  * give an example of an entrepreneur that measures success in the hours he works, and ends up sacrificing his marriage and family.   
  * There is no “*personal*” or “*business*” success \-- only “***success***”. To succeed in life, it’s impossible to sustain crazy hours.  
  * Further, there’s no false dichotomy between healthy marriage/family and a thriving business. The two can coexist \-- you just need to learn how to increase the value of the time you’re spending in your business.  
* Do things only YOU can do to drive the business forward.

* 80/20 \= a disproportionately large amount of your productivity comes from a disproportionately small amount of your time.  
  * Same with customers: 80% of revenue from 20% of customers, and it compounds 80% of that 80% comes from 20% or that 20%, etc.

**Week 4**  
Examples:

* Story of someone dumping a project in someone else’s lap and:  
  * It didn’t get completed on time  
  * It wasn’t done as well as it should have  
  * Etc  
* Story of trying to do this, but other people tell me that I’m micromanaging. Perhaps having the secretary quit during the busiest part of the year because of stress-related reasons.  
* Delegation is not merely handing off your “to do” list to somebody else  
* Solution:  
  * The most primitive rule of delegation is clear communication of expectations  
  * There are two kinds of delegation:  
    * **Task-based delegation** \-- Go run this errand, take this to the post office. This ends up treating people like little machines, and is more prone to burning them out.  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** \-- where people are responsible for and vested in an outcome (such as overseeing/streamlining officework), which always directly ties back to moving the business forward  
  * The difference is *NOT that the person doesn’t* go to the post office. The difference is that it’s based on *the person’s own initiative*, and it’s tied directly to the outcome.  
    * **Task-based delegation** \-- The boss might say, “please go to the post office and get stamps to mail off these letters”  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** \-- letters need to be mailed. The person may choose to stop by the corner store (which is closer) to buy stamps and drop them in a dropbox. OR, they might choose to always have extra stamps on hand, so they can consistently spare themselves the trip to the post office….or they might question the “how” even further, and start emailing certain things instead of snail-mailing them and follow-up with a text to let the person know, etc  
  * Another way to say it:  
    * **Task-based delegation** says, “Please go do tasks A, B and C. I’m here to tell you what to do.”  
    * **Outcome-based delegation** says, “These are the result that we’re looking for. You have the freedom to find a path that serves you and the business the best. I’m here to offer help wherever you need it.”  
  * **Outcome-based delegation** does *NOT work with “tell me how to do it” people*, so you have to find people who are able to think on their own and are willing to question how they’re doing it.  
* Further, sharing responsibility in a healthy way encourages your team members to ***take more ownership***, not less.

**Week 3**

* Story: I’ve been surrounded by my friends, but many of them work for someone else, so they don’t understand what’s going on or the challenges I faced. When I tried to tell them, they just shrugged it off, and one of them muttered something under his breath about being able to take business trips to Vegas/Other Major City (or being able to be your own boss, have own time schedule, etc). \--- or “being able to charge $\_\_/hr instead of just getting paid a measly $\_\_\_” with example shop rates vs. employee rates, assuming the full difference goes straight into paying for a new \[\[shiny gadget\]\]  
* The truth is that your neighbors don’t understand...and most of your friends don’t, either. However, that’s what changed when they started spending time with people who DO understand  
* Example: when he first started opening up to his friends about what was going on in his business, he thought he was going to DIE….but once he started finding friends he could be honest with (both in his successes and his losses), he realized he truly wasn’t alone  
* When he started to talk with people outside his “circle”, he realized that other industries had similar challenges, and the very fact of hearing a story of how someone else solved the problem in a separate industry did two things:  
  * It gave him insight into his situation, because he saw it in a completely different light.  
  * It helped him realize that certain principles translate to his own business  
  * For example:  
    * He was having trouble with unruly kids disrupting his classes  
    * Until one day, the pilot was sharing how he manages his energy for his longer flights  
      * Ensuring that he doesn’t watch television, to help him to sleep better  
      * Avoiding the newspaper the morning of the flight  
      * Eating a nutrient-rich meal beforehand, and using healthy snacks to get him through the day  
    * That’s when Educator decided to:  
      * Offer an incentive program for kids not to watch TV *(need more details about how this works)* \-- maybe parents sign off on it, and they got a extra field trip every quarter  
      * Offering healthier meals, and replacing vending machines with higher quality snacks  
      * Integrating healthy snacks into the school schedule in the morning and afternoon  
    * Jack (or whoever) could say that while people are starting to talk about this now, but this was really cutting edge back in the day, and most other educators weren’t able to get access to this kind of thing. And it was because of this relationship that he gained these insights.  
    * Because of that, they were able to raise their grades by a .75 GPA across the board (or something along those lines)?  
    * Optional?? Combined with an after-school program, they awarded a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the changes in their school.

**Week 5**  
Examples:

* Another idea  
  * \-- wrap up the breakfast meeting before, then have this guy bump into someone from the group.  
  * He says, “Hey I’ve been talking to Mentor, and he’s been teaching me about my business.”  
  * Other guy says, “So how are things going?”  
  * He says “Fine”...  
  * Other guy waits...awkward silence...asks how things are *really* going  
  * Face red, clammy palms, heart pounding, lightheaded, etc….  
  * Thinking thoughts of….can’t do this, can’t share, i’m such an incompetent business owner, etc  
* That’s when he starts spilling the real thing going on  
* This could be with the farmer, and he could identify with the sense that his problems were unique, and he felt insecure around these “successful” and “educated” people, and he’d taken on a lot of debt...  
* Realizations:  
  * Blurts out what’s happening, and he’s expecting Other Guy to laugh at him, but he doesn’t.  
  * He realized that just articulating his problem, he starts seeing possibilities for solutions  
  * He starts inviting feedback, and realizes that others have insights into what’s going on  
  * He realizes that it gives other people purpose to help him  
* Examples:  
  * Problems:  
    * Tension at home  
    * Business is OK but not growing  
    * Tied down to his business  
    * Without a profit, his business is nothing  
    * And without a profitable business, he’s nothing  
    * *Living under the pressure of being Perfect*  
  * Farmer shares:  
    * When he started sharing with others, he realized that he was worth as a human, apart from his net worth. HE was surprised to find out that the most successful people were the warmest and most welcoming  
    * How he started letting go of the need to generate results, and instead focusing specifically on building healthy systems and letting the results come from that  
    * Just like he plants a seed, then waits for it to grow...sometimes business is about planting a seed, watering it, and just waiting it out for the harvest  
    * The most successful people in the world are some of the most flawed...and their flaws were what helped them to succeed. IT’s OK not to be perfect, and not to have all the answers.  
    * Perhaps the farmer had to ask people close to him to lend him some money to get through the year, and he had no idea how he was going to pay them back--the hardest thing was asking for help, but when he asked for money, he got so much support than that  
* So perhaps the main character can start opening up about what’s really going on in his business

**Week 6**  
Examples:

* “Isn’t it just a matter of getting together and catching up?”  
* Example \-- got a few friends that I play golf with on the weekends. Isn’t this the same thing?  
* Short answer: no, because we’re focused and intentional on helping each other grow.  
  * Do we brainstorm? Yes  
  * Do we catch up? Yes, we do take time for that  
* However, we are intentional about how we structure the meetings.  
* We made a lot of mistakes, but here’s what we learned:  
  * Take time to ask clarifying questions before you assume you know the answer.  
  * Just because your perspective is different doesn’t mean you’re wrong or right.  
  * Just pick 1 thing to act on. You can’t implement 100 things.  
  * After you brainstorm, be sure to actually *choose something* that you’re going to do.  
  * Schedule it and make it a priority. “For me, it was as important as going to church.” Or some more politically-correct way to say it. :-)  Example of rescheduling things to make it a priority.  
  * They took the time to change it up, such as teaching on books they’d read, seminars they attended, etc.  
  * Maybe even detail the basic structure:  
    * Get together  
    * Someone from the group sharing something they’d learned  
    * Assigning people to a “hot seat” and taking the time to learn about their challenge  
    * Brainstorming as a group  
    * Letting the person choose an action step  
    * (The next time, they would ask each other to see where they were at.)  
  * They valued their time, so while they took the time to say “hello”, they knew that their time was precious, and they did as much as they could to focus their discussions.  
* Stories:  
  * Stories of people who tried to join and just talked their heads off and ran over other people. Setting boundaries as a faciliator  
  * Someone trying to join who was just a talker, but never actually took action and got anything done. Far later than they should have, they finally asked him to leave.

**Week 8**

  * Take time to ask clarifying questions before you assume you know the answer.
