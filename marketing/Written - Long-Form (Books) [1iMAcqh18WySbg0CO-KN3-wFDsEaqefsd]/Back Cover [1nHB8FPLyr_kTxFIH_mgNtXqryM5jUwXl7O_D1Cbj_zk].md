“*Winning Together* met me right where I was in many ways: too busy, distracted by the daily whirlwind, and frustrated by how my personal life was affected by the challenges I faced at work. This Parable communicated practical solutions to the problems that I was facing in a way that was easy to understand. Applying the leadership lessons that Jack learned brought solutions to what I faced. You will find yourself drawn in by the real-life challenges and the solutions that Jack found. A great book on the journey to successful leadership.”
