**Chapter 3: The First Week**   
***Personal Development Takes Too Much Time and Money***

“I FIRST met Carl in college. He was fresh out of ‘Nam and I was a sophomore at the university.”

Jack did rejoin his mentor and the group of retired men for their Thursday morning routine--despite his hesitation. The old man was right. He was desperate for a breakthrough for his business and family. What other options did he have?

Now, after all the other men had left, Jack once again sat across from his old friend, listening to the first story.

“We were taking the same speech class under Professor Gorman. Terribly boring,” the old fellow said with a role of his eyes. “Neither of us learned a thing. Of course, this preceded Carl’s pilot career. In fact we were both, at the time, eyeing totally different careers than we ended up pursuing.

“Anyways,” he continued. “We didn’t learn a thing from Gorman, but we did from each other. We sat in the back row and dreamt of all the things we would rather be doing.”

The old man cleared his throat and continued with a twinkle: “The kids these days have it easy with their phones. Back then, we had to be very subtle when ignoring the teacher. We wrote our dreams and ideas down in our notebooks then slyly swapped and replied to what the other wrote.

“It just looked like we were taking notes.” The older man smiled, obviously recalling fond memories. “Besides, Gorman wasn’t the quickest professor on the campus,” he added. “I was trying my hand at politics, during those days.”

“No way\!” Jack gaped. “You? In politics?”

“Yes\!” the old man released a booming laugh. “This wasn’t long after the sixties, remember. We hadn’t yet discovered not everyone is born a politician. I vainly tried to organize a team and a movement. I fantasized about starting a new party that would rise above the divisiveness of petty party politics. See my delusion already? I thought I could bring America into the new age of freedom and liberty. I figured I’d be about ready for the presidency by the turn of the century.”

He laughed again.

“Carl, on the other hand, was pursuing a degree in communication.” The man laughed even harder at the thought. “Imagine\! Carl, a speaker? We were so young.”

Jack chuckled, too, more at his friend’s amusement than at the thought of Carl being a speaker.

“So what happened?” he asked the old man.

“With Carl?”

“No, with your political career.”

“Well, my political career would eventually fizzle out like carbonated water. But the party was still a work in progress,” the man nestled in for the story. “Which is actually where we should begin.” He said with a twinkle. “Jack, you know a lot already. You know the basics of business, right?”

“I’ve spent six years building my business, so, yeah, I would say so.”

“That means less groundwork for us to cover. If you really want to go to the next level with your business, the first thing you need to learn is the importance of contribution. So I’m going to tell you today what I learned from Carl about contribution.”

“Contribution?” Jack repeated distracted slightly by his smartphone.

“Yes, contribution. But I don’t mean contribution like paying into a financial kitty. I’m talking about contributing something much more valuable than money. I’m talking about the contribution of--well,” the old man stopped and looked at Jack’s phone. “I guess you probably don’t have time for this story,” he said with mock self-pity.

Setting his phone down, Jack pulled his arms together and leaned in. 

“Sorry.” He smiled sheepishly. “I am interested. I want to hear.”

The older man straightened. “Good,” he said eyeing Jack with a mischievous grin. He waved his mug at the waitress for more coffee. 

“Like I said, my political career wouldn’t last long. However, the team--the party some of us were building, had struck a chord with other students. People wanted in on it. They wanted to hear our ideas and discuss them. It was great, but the structure was fragile. We were weak and beginning to fracture.

“My bull-headed opinions and fist pounding sermons certainly didn’t help anything. People liked being part of the discussions. They liked the setting, but I think they found it hard to follow me as a leader. I enjoyed hearing my own opinions and hated being challenged or put in my place. I was a one man show.

“People started grumbling--you know how that happens. One off-hand comment about bad leadership and next thing you know everybody’s talking about all the problems. Of course, no one talks to the people who actually need to hear the feedback so they can change.”

“Gossip,” Jack mumbled with disdain.

“You know what I’m talking about, then?”

“Yes, I do.”

“It’s an awful thing, but that’s a whole other story.” The old man waved the topic aside. “Once I got wind of the grumblings, I immediately started taking steps to solve the problem. But instead of going to trusted friends and advisors like I should have done--you know, people like Carl or even the actual people doing the grumbling--I went to this ‘great,’ ‘groundbreaking’ seminar on leadership and teamwork.”

“You had those back then?” Jack asked.

“Son, this was the ‘70s. The days of enlightenment and dawn of the new age. We invented self-help seminars\! And at first, I loved it. They gave me all kinds of resources--workbooks, motivational tapes and the like. It all made me feel good for a while, but never made a long lasting impact.

“I would get so frustrated. Sometimes I was frustrated with myself for investing so much money and time into those crazy seminars. Then I’d get frustrated at the guys selling the seminars and writing the books. What rip-offs\! Some days, I was just angry and frustrated for no particular reason. I felt stuck with the whole political party and leadership thing. I felt like all the energy I put into making myself better was going to waste.

“Looking back, I see that their material was ineffective, because it was incomplete. You always needed to join one more program or buy another book, or something even more expensive.”

“Hasn’t changed a bit.”

The old man shook his head. “Yeah, I found out real quick that most ‘business’ or ‘leadership’ seminars promising success were over-priced and ultimately unhelpful. Most of the time they just didn’t align with my values.”

Jack nodded in agreement. 

“You know what I mean, huh?” the man chuckled. “Although I realized they weren’t always worth their price, I did learn some things during that time. One thing I learned was that you don’t have to apply every single thing from every single seminar or book. All you need to do is learn one or two things you can apply really well.

“At the end of the day, though,” he continued with a yawn. “What I really found helpful were those conversations with Carl. The back-row note-swapping sessions were much more effective than any of those expensive seminars.

“You know,” he said, suddenly reminiscent. “Carl had this way of putting people at ease by asking questions. This always got them to talk. I and my political buddies just argued and defended ourselves. But Carl gently pulled ideas from people and allowed them a place at the table, so to speak.”

He paused, setting his mug down and looking up at the vine entangled lattice overhead which provided shade for the cafe courtyard.

“The real breakthrough for me came one time when Carl was especially blunt with me. We were trading notes again in Professor Gorman’s class. I had written a long soliloquy about some idea a fellow student had shared in our party meeting and how stupid I thought it was.” 

Jack’s mentor pulled out what looked like a photocopy of an old notebook paper and began to read.

“‘Do you think he’s really the stupid one?’ Carl wrote back. ‘Sure, his ideology may be naive, but don’t you think, if you look closely, there’s gold under the naivety? There always is. You just have to mine it out. If you immediately reject the ideas people offer you, you’ll never produce a refined idea. You’ll have no revelations, no light-bulb moments, no innovation. Just the ideas in your own head because you don’t think anyone else has anything to offer. Truth be told, bud, the ideas in your head won’t change the world. It takes a team.’”

“Ouch\!” Jack empathized. “That must’ve hurt.”

“Well, I got over it,” the old man dismissed. “What Carl was talking about was *contribution*. The contribution of ideas and criticism. You can’t light a fire with one stick or a single match. You need *two* sticks or *two* flints; a match *and* a striker. The same is true for any type of venture, whether a political party, a non-profit, a church, a family, or, most certainly, a business like yours. You can’t do this alone. You need contribution. You need people to rub your ideas against in order to make a spark. You need to do business in strong community.”

He paused, to let Jack think about it.

After a moment, Jack sat up. “This all sounds ideal,” he said, “but I just don’t have time for it. I have so much to do: paperwork, follow-up calls--let alone the actual mechanic work. I can’t do it.”

“There you go again,” the old man sighed. “That’s what I said at first, too. But like Carl told me: ‘If you want to facilitate a successful movement,’ he said, ‘you gotta strategize--together, with other people. Get the ones most committed and creative to start having meetings with you.’

“I resisted at first. I could barely split my time between politics and homework and all the other activities I was already involved with. Strategy meetings sounded like just one more thing to add to my busy schedule. 

“Nevertheless, I was passionate about this movement. I wanted to make it a success and I knew Carl was right. I knew if we were going to make a difference in our political sphere, I had to start allowing everyone’s voice to be heard--even the ones I most disagreed with. I had to listen to people’s feedback about what was effective or ineffective. People had good thoughts on how we could improve what we were already doing and what we needed to cut back or out completely. If I wanted our message to spread, I had to hear these people.

“I knew it would take time. But I also knew if I didn’t take it seriously, I would be waving our beloved party--and any hope of change--good-bye. So I did it. I plunged in.”

“What did you do?” Jack asked.

“I started by taking a hard look at every activity I participated in--the things eating up my time. I eliminated anything I was not passionately committed to. I saw change needed to happen and I chased after it. I only left my studies, the party, and the activities that truly re-energized me. I saw, with Carl’s help, that I had to make time for feedback and brainstorming, so I cleared my schedule to make room.

“I organized strategy meetings. I included more people in our discussion times. I argued less and listened more. I sent out surveys of the student body as a whole and our political party specifically. I got feedback.

“Soon, it stopped being all *“I”* and “*my”* and became “*us*” and “*ours.*” It grew into a true movement and people loved it. Even after I left the university, having realized politics wasn’t my calling, ‘The Party’--as we called it--was alive and well. I believe it was making a meaningful difference, too.”

“And you think this happened because you started meeting with other people and listening to them better?” Jack asked.

“Yes\! Exactly that\!”

“Well, I’m glad it all worked out for your party,” Jack said. “But I’m just a mechanic. I’m not a politician. I’m not working with ideas or people. I’m working with cars and inanimate tools.”

“Oh, but you do work with people, Jack. You have employees, don’t you? You have customers. You have a family and neighbors, friends, a church: you do work with people and ideas. If you want your business to grow, you have to start valuing contribution. When you’re stuck in quicksand, struggling on your own only pushes you deeper. You need friends to help you out of quicksand.”

“So you think if I get together with some friend to talk about my business, it could grow?”

“Not exactly. I’m saying being involved in a community of mutual giving--contribution--is where successful leaders spring from. It doesn’t just involve talking about *your* business. It involves contributing your ideas to *theirs* as well. You grow by contributing back-and-forth to other people and them to you. Furthermore, it involves growing *personally*.”

“Personally? You mean, like some sort of “Life Coaching Program”? Jack scoffed.

The old man nodded without batting an eye. “If you don’t grow yourself, Jack, how in the world do you expect to grow your business?” The old mentor continued, “Things go on beneath the surface that keep you from generating your best work. You know that, deep down. You just won’t admit it yet.”

Jack squirmed in his seat.

“Did this Friday-morning-group-accountability-thing that you’re still doing come out of your political party?” he said, changing the subject.

He was beginning to feel uncomfortable. The old man was digging too deep. They both knew it. Jack’s thick veneer hid a city plagued by failure, frustrating pressure, and inadequacy. Jack’s soul, diseased and burning, screamed in terror at the idea of being found out. So Jack tried to bypass the real issues to distract the old man from what was really going on.

The mentor eyed Jack tenderly. He saw a new fire blazing in the younger man’s eyes. Whether good or bad, he couldn’t tell yet. He felt compassion for the mechanic because he had been there, too, many years ago. He would let Jack play his little games for now, but eventually Jack would need to tear away the veneer or he would suffocate.

“Oh, no\!” he said. “No, Carl wasn’t much interested in politics. Neither was I, to be honest, it just took me some time to figure that out. No, this group came out of those note-trading sessions in the back of Professor Gorman’s class. Little did we know what started out as just a couple of bored students was only the beginning.”

“The beginning of what?” Jack asked.

The old man spread out his arms, as if to point at the table.

“The beginning of an invaluable relationship between the two of us lasting over forty years, eventually including all of these fine gentlemen you’ve been getting to know.”

“I see,” Jack said.

“Everything I know about contribution and collaboration, came from Carl. Don’t know where he learned it, but he did. Somewhere, somehow.” The old man shrugged. “If I hadn’t listened to him and asked him questions and if he hadn’t been bold enough to offer his advice, all of that wisdom and experience would have gone untapped inside his head--at least by me.”

Jack began to respond, but his old mentor continued.

“I learned many things about leadership and business through starting a political movement,” he said. “But two things in particular stand out to me. First,” he held up his finger, “you must learn from your peers and comrades--like we’ve been talking about. Second, there is no greater teacher than experience, both your own and that others. Almost all of this learning happens in the context of strong community.”

Jack watched the waitress start cleaning up their breakfast dishes.

Looking at his mentor, he said, “I’ve known you all these years and yet have never heard this--I didn’t even know about this group of friends. Why didn’t you tell me?”

“You never asked.”

Jack tilted his head to the side. It was true, he hadn’t asked. He had just plunged into business and never once thought to ask his old friend.

“Why didn’t you ever go into business if you knew so much about it,” he asked the old man.

“Well…” He gazed off, past the cafe and morning traffic jamming Lewis street. He seemed to be looking at something a long way off. But Jack could see nothing beyond the opposing shops. “I was meant to do something else, I guess.” He grinned mildly.

Jack opened his mouth to lodge another question, but the old man stopped him.

“Ah, I think that’s enough for today,” he said stretching and yawning again. “Keep your eyes open this week. All around you, there is plenty of untapped potential and untapped wisdom and experience. Look for it. Seek it out. Learn from it. Next week, perhaps we’ll talk about Kip.”

“Kip? The restaurateur?”

“That’s the one. He’s got a fascinating story. But you’ll have to come back next week if you want to hear about how he only worked three days a week by the end of his career.” The old man’s eyes twinkled.

Incredulous, Jack began to mock the idea, but the old man held up his hands.

“Next week, Jack. I’ll tell it all.”
