**ISBN Options**

CreateSpace:

|  | Imprint | Distributor | Price |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| CreateSpace Assigned ISBN | CreateSpace IndependentPublishing Platform | CreateSpace | Free |  |
| Custom Universal ISBN | You choose | You choose | $99 | Offered through Bowker |
| Provide Your Own ISBN | You choose | You choose | Have existing ISBN |  |

I think the last option is for if you are reprinting something.

Bowkers/MyIdentifier:  
One ISBN- $125  
Ten ISBN’s \- $295 (if you’re planning on publishing more than one version or another book someday?)

Questions: Is the book going to be softcover, hardcover, or e-book, or several? I believe you need an ISBN for each version.

***Summary***: If you don’t mind if the imprint is CreateSpace, that would probably be the most economical/easiest route. If you want your own imprint, probably the Custom Universal ISBN through CreateSpace. If you want more than two ISBN’s, buying bulk from Bowkers is probably best.

**Barcode Options**

From CreateSpace: “When your files go through the review process, our system will place your ISBN barcode in a 2" by 1.2" white box in the lower right-hand corner of your book's back cover. Our standard trim size templates will show you exact barcode placement.

Images or text in the barcode location will be covered when the book is printed. Make sure no important elements appear where the barcode will be placed.

If you choose to provide and place your own barcode, be sure it is a high-resolution image. The barcode can be located on the back or front cover of your book, at a recommended size of 2" wide by 1.2" tall. You are welcome to add an additional UPC barcode for distribution purposes if applicable.”

Additional Notes:  
Bookland EAN vs UPC \- UPC codes are often also put on mass marketed paperbacks (EAN on inside front cover, UPC on back cover) that will be sold in settings outside of bookstores (grocery stores, drug stores, etc), as these stores are not set up to read Bookland EAN codes. Other ways around this are two different printing runs (expensive), and putting UPC code stickers over Bookland EAN symbols. However, this may not be an issue anymore, as these retailers are becoming more able to accept Bookland EAN codes.  
EAN-5 \- additional five-digit pricing code, required by Barnes and Nobles and large retailers. Scanners in American bookstores can’t read the barcode without the EAN-5. This gives the currency and the price. So, if it’s US Dollars, it will start with a 5, and if the book is $10.99, the EAN-5 will be 51099\. If you don’t want to encode the price, so retailers can set it, you use 90000\.

Price add-on \- can’t change price after barcode is made without changing barcode.

Barcode needs to be in the lower righthand corner. Size is typically 2’’ x 1.25’’, but can be smaller or larger.

There are free online barcode generators such as [this](https://www.creativindiecovers.com/free-online-isbn-barcode-generator/) and [this](http://www.adazing.com/isbn-to-barcode-generator/).
