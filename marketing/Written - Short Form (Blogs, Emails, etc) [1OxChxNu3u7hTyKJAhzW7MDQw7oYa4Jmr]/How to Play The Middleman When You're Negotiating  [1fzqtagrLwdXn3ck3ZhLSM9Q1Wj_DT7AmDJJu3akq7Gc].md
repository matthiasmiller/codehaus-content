My sister recently told me about a challenging situation at work. She found herself caught between two co-workers who were offering conflicting advice. After going back and forth multiple times, she finally ironed out the situation. 

Even though her story ended well, it reminds me how difficult it can be to play middleman between two parties. Why is it so challenging?

* Both parties come to the table with their own set of expectations and assumptions.   
* Both know what they want to achieve and obtain.  
* Neither party is aligned.

When we find ourselves bouncing back and forth between the opinions and demands of others, our first reaction might be to wield our authority to stop the madness. While this may achieve short-term results, it doesn't create healthy, sustainable outcomes.

John Maxwell famously said that “Leadership is influence.” I’d like to suggest that there's something more important--more foundational--than influence; and if you use it, you'll be able to influence much more effectively. 

So what is that tool? That tool is alignment.

Let's jump back to this example where you're negotiating between two different parties and their needs. The more effective approach in this situation is not to influence one party or the other but to identify what each party needs and then to help both parties discover an outcome that is mutually beneficial. 

Granted, sometimes this isn’t possible. However, when you're negotiating among multiple parties, start taking a look not only at how to influence people towards the outcome that you want, but look at how to create alignment between the outcomes that each party is looking for. 

As you lead, don't merely lead from a place of desiring influence. Lead from a place of creating alignment, and you'll find that influence comes naturally as a byproduct.

One of the mistakes I made as a young marketer was trying to persuade and influence people. While persuasion isn't a bad thing, I missed the more foundational layer that when I align with people’s urgent needs and demonstrate that I can provide a solution, then I had the influence that I needed to persuade and motivate them.

When you deeply understand what your organization needs to move forward, when you deeply understand what your employees need to move forward, you have the ability to create alignment. There are three things you need to remember:

* You’re not able to align yourself with everyone; thus you can’t serve every potential client.  
* Not everyone is aligned with you and your organization; thus not everyone should be on your team.  
* As a leader, your responsibility is to find others who are aligned with your values and goals.

Take a few moments right now to consider the various areas of your life. Identify areas that are out of alignment. 

* What is it going to take to create alignment in your life?   
* Are there people in your life that you need to align to, or need to move on to another setting where they are better aligned?
