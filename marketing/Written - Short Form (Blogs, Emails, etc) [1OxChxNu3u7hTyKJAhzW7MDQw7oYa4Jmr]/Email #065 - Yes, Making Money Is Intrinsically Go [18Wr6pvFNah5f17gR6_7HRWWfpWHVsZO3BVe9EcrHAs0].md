If you’re a Christian in the business realm, you know the struggle of balancing your desire for increasing profits and the Church’s hesitation to build wealth.

Walking this path can be tricky for anyone who feels like God has called them to make money. We hear things like “Money is the root of all evil” and gasp at the horror that we might actually enjoy making a profit.

I’ll shoot straight with you: I think that making money is intrinsically good and that some of us have a God given calling to make wealth through business.

Business is one of the most sustainable ways of changing the world because every contribution ends up with mutual benefit. The exchange should not only benefit the customer, it should also benefit the seller, thus it’s a sustainable model of contribution.

Whereas charity work, as wonderful and important as it is, depends on third party support and the contribution generally flows one direction.

If you are a Christian or even just a spiritual person wrestling with balancing your love for business and your commitment to faith, know that you’re not alone.

For the rest of the month, I’m going to be talking about the concept of Spirituality and business. In the next three emails, I want to give concrete solutions for Christians to be both genuine to their faith and their business\!

As I dive into that, I’d love to hear your thoughts. As a Christian business person, what are your greatest challenges that you face? What are the questions you wrestle with on a daily basis?

I look forward to hearing your thoughts\!

And as always…

Be the best you\!
