“Kids are mean to each other\!”

Ever heard someone say this before? Ever *thought* this yourself? Perhaps it was after your child came home from school distraught over the teasing of some insecure bully. This is too common of a problem.

That’s why every kid needs an Amanda Moore in their life. When Rafael Anaya moved to Temecula, California from Mexico, he had trouble finding friends.

But Amanda remedied that when she used Google translate on her phone to write a friendly letter to the boy.

She wrote, “Would you like to sit with me today? Look for me and I will show you where I sit. We can color or simply tell scary stories. Thank you for your time, signed Amanda."

We often think certain barriers in our lives keep us from reaching out to other people. But as Amanda proved, even one of the greatest barriers we know--the language barrier--doesn’t have to stop us from being a blessing.

While the year is still young and fresh, let’s not let anything stop us from being a blessing to those around us. A friendly note, a cup of water, a smile--you never know how the simplest things could brighten someone’s world.

*“And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.”*
