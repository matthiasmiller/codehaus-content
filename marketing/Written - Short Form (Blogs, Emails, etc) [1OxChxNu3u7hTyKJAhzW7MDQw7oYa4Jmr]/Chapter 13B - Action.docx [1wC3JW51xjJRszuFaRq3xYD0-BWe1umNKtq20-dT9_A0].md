## **Where Lists Get in the Way**

Everyone has different ways of managing their tasks and the priorities. Many people recommend making "To Do" lists so that you can remember the things that you need to do.

I have to be completely honest: the rough draft of this book never made it onto a "to do" list. I decided to do it, I prioritized it for six weeks, and I got it done.

Here's what I've noticed: whenever I have things that I'm not fully committed to doing, I put them on a "to do" list. I find that the things that I am really passionate about and committed to doing find their way into my schedule whether I write them down or not.

Don't get me wrong. It's important to capture some of those great ideas, but it's more important to execute on them. Unless you are intentional about the things that make it onto your to do list, it will become a "List of Obligation", the things that you must do but that will only distract you from the things that are the most important to you.

Even more, unless you proactively take things off your list, your list will simply become a tool for procrastination. When you encounter something that you think you should do, you will immediately postpone it by putting it on your to do list. And the more you postpone it, the more difficult it is to get it done.

Don't let that happen. Instead, learn to prioritize those things that matter the most to do. Most of the things that want to make it onto your to do list shouldn't be done anyway.

If lists of tasks help you, I have no problem with you using them. However, I find it much more powerful to live with list of projects--one or two big priorities that I'm focused on. Everything in my life revolves around these two major tasks, and these are the things that I work to move forward every single day.

When you have something that you're so completely bought into, you'll need to keep a to do list to make sure that you don't miss anything in your excitement, rather than a list of things that you must get done before you can have any fun doing.

Don't let lists get in the way of your bias towards action. Not everything deserves to be done, and sometimes you're better off writing it on a piece of paper and throwing it in the trash can than letting it occupy your mental space.

## **You Won't Be Ready**

Momentum is achieved when you consistently pull the trigger. When I was a kid, I had two peers who were speed fanatics. They excitedly told me and my friends one day about people who race cars with two drivers. One driver controls the steering wheel and the other controls the gas pedal and brake. As they near the bend, the driver with the wheel instinctively pulls back, but the other driver punches on the gas. They narrowly manage to maintain control of their vehicle as they career around the bend.

My friends had been known to exaggerate a story here and there, but this is exactly what you need to do to create a bias action. You're so focused on your steering wheel, trying to control where you're going, that you're afraid to set your foot on the gas pedal and punch it. You're afraid that you're really going to completely lose control.

In the words of Mario Andretti, "If everything seems under control, you're just not going fast enough." You must learn to surrender control and give up the outcomes. You must stay aligned with where you are, and once you've set your GPS, you must be willing to accelerate.

You're ability to execute, to lead, to take risks all depend on your ability to give up control. You need to trust that it's more important to move forward than to make sure that everything is working out.

Nobody was every fully ready for the commitment and transition of getting married. And nobody was fully ready for their first child. How many parents have been in the hospital with their beautiful newborn child and wondered, "How in the world will they allow me to go home with this little kid? Don't they know how inexperienced I am?"

But that's exactly the point.

If you were ready for the experience, you'd be settling for something much less. You can grow in a situation that you're completely ready for.

That's why many young leaders plateau the moment that they are put into a position of leadership. Before that time, they are able to grow continuously, and then they get put into a position where they are required to keep the status quo, to maintain where they're at. They're put into a position where, every day, they know exactly what to expect and what to do.

Don't settle\! You need to be challenged. You need to become uncomfortable with being outside of your comfort zone, because that's exactly the place where you'll flourish the most. You need to be willing to be bold, be courageous.

Being ready is one of the biggest myths of success. Nobody is fully ready. Destiny does not belong to those who are ready. It belongs to those who act.

You need to be able to act before you're ready.

## **Passion Isn't Easy**

Passion doesn't make success easy. Just because you have a passion for art doesn't mean that creating art will not take sweat, toil, and sheer focus. Many people assume that they are able to get the things that they want without putting themselves fully into it.

It's simply not true.

Even the people who've experienced the most radical success have years of preparation and hard work that have preceded it. They've put effort into it. They've been willing to sweat for it and sacrifice for it.

It's all going to be hard work. If it's your passion, you will come home from work feeling like you just had a workout at the gym. Your body and your mind might be aching, but you'll know that you threw yourself into it and gave it everything you had. If it's not your passion, you'll come home from work feeling like you just spent your day at a labor camp. You'll also be exhausted, but you'll be emotionally drained rather than recharged.

Pursuing your passion does not mean sitting on the couch and watching movies about school kids because you want to be a teacher someday. If you're passionate about teaching, you need to get off that couch and start working towards your education or start volunteering at a local school. You need to do something to move things forward.

Just embrace the fact: following your passion is hard. If it weren't hard, everyone would do it. You're going to face setbacks. You're going to face challenges. You'll experience doubt, not only from yourself but from people around you.

Don't expect it to be handed to you on a silver platter, because it won't be. The origin of passion is actually a Latin word that means "to suffer". If you're not willing to have your passion drive you, consume you, push you, and pull you, don't fool yourself. Your passion will work you harder than any boss in the world if you choose to follow it.

Never compromise the most important things in life for your passion, but don't fool yourself into thinking that a passing interest will qualify as a passion.

## **Pull More, Push Less**

If you struggle with an action bias, you need to go back to the prior chapters and review some of the things you've written down. You may have missed something important, or you might not have put down any answers that were truly honest or true to yourself.

Many people, when they are trying to motivate themselves, try to tell themselves to push harder. If you want to create an action bias, you must push less and find a way to let you be dragged into action, if need be, by something that is so compelling that you cannot say no.

If you don't have a reason that's that compelling, it means that you haven't done your homework well enough. Stop what you're doing right now, go back to the previous chapters and seriously consider the things that are really important to you.

Find the things that burn deeply within. I don't mean the things that you like to talk about or read about. Find the things where, when you're sitting in a conversation, you explode if you don't share them.

You know exactly what it's like. You're sitting in a formal, low-energy setting and something says something. Before you know, you respond and you raise the energy level of the room. People around you either join in your conversation, or they sit back and look at you in surprise, wondering what in the world you are doing engaging with such energy.

That's passion.

Those are the things that will pull you into the future. Those are the things that will create a bias for action.

## **Knee-jerk Reactions**

Everyone has their own knee-jerk reaction. As we look at the things we want to accomplish, we have to be completely honest with the time and resources that we have to accomplish them.

However, most people's reactions are simply that their resources are too limited to accomplish. That's what I thought about my book. However, I simply embraced the fact that it was true. It had been my knee-jerk reaction for years, and one day, when I sat down and honestly looked at it, I realized, "You know what? I could do this\!"

For everything that isn't aligned with where you intend to go, you need to develop a knee-jerk reaction that says "no". If a friend asks you to lead a book club for senior citizens, your knee-jerk reaction must be "no" unless you know this is something that's important to you.

For many people, saying "no" leaves a small residue of guilt. I, myself, am a recovering addict to saying "yes" to everyone. The truth of the matter is that, people don't need you to say yes to what they need. They need you to say yes to your passion. You will give the world more by living it fully engaged than you will by responding to every whim of every request.

You've heard the quote by Howard Thurman: "Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive."

Develop a "yes" knee-jerk reaction to the things that make you come alive. Create an action bias towards these things. Do the things that others need, as situations require them, but refuse to build your life around that. Your life must be consumed by the things that make you fully alive.

If you pass someone dying on the street, stop and help them, even if you're on the way to signing a multi-million dollar deal. Don't become entitled or selfish.

However, don't fear that pursuing your passion is intrinsically selfish. Many people worry that if they pursue their passion, they will rob others of the things they need to have done. The truth of the matter is that your greatest contribution to the world will come, not through the daily obligations that you face, but through the passion that burns within your chest.

Your greatest value to the world comes not from the things that everyone else can do. Your greatest value to the world comes by being someone nobody else can be, and it comes by you taking relentless, unending action to execute upon the things that you are passionate about.

Don't sit on your dreams for another day.

Step out, and start moving.
