I almost watered down this email because it felt egotistical and self-centered. (You’ll see why in a moment.)

However, my team encouraged me to share it with you, so I’m going to take a risk and share it with you.

Are you OK with that?

In the past month, I’ve read 6 books, gave PowerPoint presentations on 2 of them, shared insights from a third, done 6-7 hours of online training, and spent 10 hours in solitude (processing and strategizing).

Why? Because I know my limitations. By getting input and wisdom from other people, I can expand the boundaries of what I can do. By imitating what other people are doing well, I increase my value as a leader.

In the last month, I’ve spent 5 hours in masterminds and engaged in 5 intentional conversations specifically focused on challenges or limitations I was facing. Why? If I’m not actively growing myself, I’m actively limiting my business.

The growth of your sphere, whether an entrepreneur, CEO, or secretary, will increase only as you grow personally.

Many people hesitate to invest hard-earned money (or time from a busy schedule) into personal development because it seems like a weak investment with little return. However, the truth is that spending $1000 on personal development could easily yield one idea that returns 10x your investment. Your goal is not to internalize every aspect of the training, but to capture the one piece that is most relevant and helpful and leveraging it as much as possible.

Personal development is a long-term strategy. Simply by growing 1% every day (excluding weekends and generous vacations), you will 10x your abilities by the end of the year. Grow 2% every day and you’ll 100x your abilities.

Most people overlook it because the results aren’t always immediate...but they’re always there.

Don’t settle for where you’re at: 

Be the best you\!

By the end of the month, I'll have spent 5 hours in mastermind, taught lessons from 3 books I've read, done 3-4 hours of online training, 10 hours in solitude/strategy

**Background (do NOT put this in the email)**: talked with some friends of mine who are super-hesitant to cough up dough for a business mastermind. I think I’ve personally invested more money than any of my peers into some form of personal development, and I think it’s paying off.

Random ideas….

If you’re not actively growing yourself, you’re actively limiting your business.

Most people hesitate because it feels like a “soft” investment. The truth is, may spend a $1000 and make a 10x return based on 1 idea of that. Your goal is not to make money off ALL of it--the goal is to capture the part that’s most relevant and helpful.

This is a long-term play. If you take 5 weeks off, grow 1% every weekday, you’ll 10x your abilities by the end of the year.

The first $1 (or even $1000) you spend on personal development is the most difficult. However, as soon as you start seeing the benefit of it, you’

Leadership is leverage, and your ability to lead will always grow your impact.
