Marj is a hard-working woman. She always has been. It’s her grit that has kept her alive this long already.

And it’s her grit which enables her to work a fulltime job to support her kids--both under the age of six--while attempting her hand at entrepreneurship.

Unfortunately, on top of the many obstacles she overcomes everyday, Marj has an even greater problem. She’s not a people person. This is problematic since her boss has recently asked her to take on a project that requires working with a team.

“I just don’t do well working with people,” she vents to her friend after hours. “I work hard and I get things done--a lot more than some of the others in the company. I can’t stand it when people get in the way of me getting things done.”

“Right,” her friend agrees. “But if you can’t get along with your coworkers, the boss is going to be understandably displeased.”

“Well, what can I do about it?” she says. “It’s just my personality.” 

Let’s pause the story for a moment.

Last week we talked about whether our inability to do a job or respond a certain way is always because of our personalities or if they’re really habits we’ve developed over time and could improved.

If something is really “just your personality” then you are stuck with it and unable to change. This would obstruct the progress of any business, not to mention relationships, marriage, or mental health.

So how can we tell when something is simply part of our personality and when it’s something we can change or improve?

There are three questions we can ask ourselves to help us clarify the difference.

**1\. What’s the outcome?** 

Before we can identify whether something is a habit or a personality trait, we need to step back and figure out what we are actually trying to accomplish. In Marj’s example, the outcome she pursues is being able to connect with people and establish a relationship so they can work together. 

Therefore, she needs to be a “people person.”

**2\. What are my expected behaviors?** 

The trouble, however, begins with Marj’s perception of a “people person.” She assumes a “people person” is someone who talks with everyone in the room and is the life of the party. She assumes a “people person” magically gets along with everyone, never gets frustrated with other people, and never faces relational conflict. She also assumes being a “people person” requires her to spend hours sitting with them in their living room, chatting about their life.

In our story, Marj is frustrated with herself because she’s attempting to become a “people person” according to her stereotype. She ends up modeling behaviors unnatural for her.

But are these stereotypes true? Could the woman who enjoys talking to one or two friends at a party be just as much of a “people person” as someone who talks with everybody? 

Is Marj’s driven personality really what hinders her from working well with others? 

Her personality is not the problem. Rather, the problem is her assumption of how a “people person” behaves.

**3\. What are my natural behaviors?** 

Once you identify your natural behaviors, you can tell the problem is really in your expectations about your behaviors. It’s *not* a problem with your outcome. 

Being relational with a few people is being a people person. Taking a few moments to connect deeply with another person, then moving along to another task, is being a “people person.” While the amount of time does matter for some people, the *quality* of time and Marj’s level of presence has a greater impact on the outcome. Being present and actively listening is key to connecting with other people.

Let’s explore a few examples.

* You might struggle with feelings of rejection when you relate with others and conclude you’re not a “people person.” The outcome you want is to be able to freely relate with others, without taking it personally when others don’t want to relate with you. You want to be free to negotiate relationships with others. Likely you taught yourself to say “I’m not likable” when people choose not to spend time with you. This is not a matter of your personality. It’s a matter of having a wrong belief about your relationships.

* You might assume you’re not a “people person” because you’re introverted. Again, this is a false assumption. Introverts aren’t energized by being around lots of people. However, they are often exceptionally skilled at building deep, lasting relationships.

* If you want to jog every morning and struggle waking up, you might conclude you’re not a morning person. The outcome you want is to be able to exercise every morning. Rather than conclude you’re not a morning person, you might actually be motivated by having someone to do it with you. Thus, you might choose to find a friend who is willing to jog along.

* You might assume that because you’re not outgoing, you’re not a “salesperson.” In reality, however, the outcome of a salesperson is simple: “making a sale.” While you might not be the outgoing, extroverted salesperson, you might discover other, more natural ways for you to achieve the outcome: making the sale.

Clearly understanding the difference between the outcome, your expected behaviors, and your natural behaviors will help you understand the difference between your personality and your learned behaviors.

This doesn’t mean working against the grain. It means re-evaluating what you’re truly after, and finding a way you can reach that objective while being true to who you were ultimately created to be.

When you finally use your innate strength to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you will truly be able to…

Be the best you\!

**NOTES:**

A friend and Matt were praying. Standing in hallway praying, someone came through. Said hi but clearly didn’t want to impose or interrupt.

**Conflicting needs**: 1\. I have a deadline, 2\. I don’t want to impose myself, need for privacy, 3\. We’re not here to be a clique

Can you separate the outcome 

Are there people who’ve changed from not-go getter to being a go-getter. Are there people who have succeeded at being a salesperson while still being shy?

NOTES:

1. Am I confusing the behaviors (“talking with everyone in the room”) with the outcome (“being a people person”)?  
2. Have other people changed their behaviors to become a “people person” while being completely themselves?  
3. Can I learn new behaviors from those people that let me be a “people person” while being completely myself?
