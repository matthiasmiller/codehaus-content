I have an addiction. 

I can’t say “No” to people.

Between work, family, and church, I have plenty to keep me busy. I rarely actually have time to help with odd requests thrown my way.

Yet, I don’t like saying no\!

“Of course I’d love to grab coffee and share some business tips with you.”

“Change the color on your company logo? I think I could squeeze that into my spare time.”

“Come over for dinner Friday night? Sure. We don’t have any other plans\!”

“Sure thing, Honey, I’ll grab eggs and milk on the way home.”

High value individuals are always in demand. People everywhere asking “Can you help here, contribute there, or teach me this?”

As a high value person, it is important for you to learn the art of saying “No”. Otherwise, you will end up stacked with obligations with no time to explore and create.

Instead of having time to take that refreshing walk where you finally understand how to navigate through a tough relationship, you’ll be stuck working on unrelated side-projects for a friend who asked nicely.

Or, even worse, that 15-minute appointment to share business tips over coffee will go longer than expected and you’ll be late or totally miss your next appointment. Potentially hurting your reputation of keeping your word.

This doesn’t mean becoming a self-centered scrooge: it means grasping an honest understanding of your time limits and setting clear boundaries. By trying to serve everyone you’ll end up serving no one--and burning out in the meantime.

Don’t sentence yourself to time debtor's prison. Define the boundaries of your time, and commit within them. Give yourself the freedom to explore and create.

And always remember, be the best you\!

they don't have the freedom to create, because they are so indebted with their commitments
