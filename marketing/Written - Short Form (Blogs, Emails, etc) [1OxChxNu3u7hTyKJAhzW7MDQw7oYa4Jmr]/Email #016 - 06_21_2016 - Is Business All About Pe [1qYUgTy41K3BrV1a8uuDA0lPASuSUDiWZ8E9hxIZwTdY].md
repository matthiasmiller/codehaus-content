When it comes to what drives entrepreneurs, more often than not, we lean toward two extremes:

We’re either:

1. All about people, but can’t make money   
2. All about money, but can’t keep people

It takes a healthy tension: Without people, you can’t make money, but without money, you can’t help people.

Let me tell you a true story about Casey, who runs a coffee shop in Los Angeles.

He’s an easy-going businessman frequently giving discounts, coffees “on the house,” and going the extra-mile to find his customers the cheapest deal, sometimes throwing in a bag of goodies with a wink and no charge.

On one hand, he could take this too far and give too MUCH away. He would certainly have a lot of friends and happy consumers, but not a lot of money to grow his business and make his cafe even better. 

On the other hand, he could focus on all the profits being lost through the free coffees and discounts and become stingy, not giving anything away. Perhaps he would break even, but his customer loyalty would be low and there would be little reason for customers to choose his shop over the one down the street.

As it is, Casey deftly holds the tension by being generous while also being responsible. This creates an atmosphere and rapport with and among customers that keeps them coming back, even when the most loyal of them admit they could get tastier coffee only a few blocks away.

The same can apply not only to customers, but employees as well. 

Casey could nurture great team-dynamics that keep employees happy and excited to work, while neglecting the financial demands or quality of product. Or he could focus on the finances and product quality, and neglect the team-dynamic that keeps employees invested in the shop. 

A healthy business takes obsessing with growing people AND with growing numbers. Through this, customers will remain loyal, employees happy, and profits up.

*So, where are you right now? Do you need to focus on building your people? Or do you need to focus on building your profits? Either way, I’d love to hear about it\!*

As you live with the tension between people and money...

Always, be the best you\!

**Matt’s Original Memo:**  
Business people often lean toward two extremes.

Either they’re:

1. All about people, but they can’t make money.  
2. All about money, but they can’t keep people.

It takes a healthy tension, because without people, you can’t make money. Without money, you can’t help people.

It takes an obsession with growing people AND growing numbers.

Sometimes entrepreneurs will run away from profit because they want to “be all about people”. Profits (in their truest form) are the just rewards for helping people, and the best system is always a SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM.

Where are you right now? Do you need to focus on building your people? Or do you need to focus on building your profits?
