**1\. What language do they use?**

If you’re selling business shoes, you won’t use words like “comfortable for long runs,” “good spring support,” “traction for all terrains.” 

You’re going to use words connect with your target audience. What is a businessman looking for in a pair of shoes? What are the problems he’s facing with his current pair? 

Are they not comfortable when **standing** for long periods? Do they lack **arch-support**? Do they last long despite **day-to-day use**? Do they require minimal maintenance, or are they hard to buff?

Speaking your customer’s language communicates that you understand their needs, giving them greater confidence in your solution.

This is a way of getting inside their head.They’ll subconsciously think “Aha, this guy gets it.”

**2\. What is unique to their interests?**

Learning what is unique about your customers is another way of connecting with their emotion.

Let’s go back to the simple business shoe example.

Why would someone be looking for a pair of business shoes rather than any other pair?

The answer is obvious: Because they are most likely business people.

Business is unique. You can target their unique interests in business. Whether through social media, such as a blog or Instagram feed focused on business style, or just a simple advertisement: knowing their unique interest will enable you to capture their attention.

The business shoe example is obvious. But your audience may be a little harder to figure out. Take some time to think about it, ask questions, use surveys, test it through real-life advertising, and soon you’ll discover game-changing information.

**3\. What related interests do they have?**

Knowing your customer’s interests can give you more and creative opportunities to sell to them. Take airfare dealers for example.

A dealer such as Kayak or Expedia knows people looking for a flight likely need a rental car and hotel as well, so they provide package deals combining all or a couple of these needs together. Usually, they also provide tourist information explaining what there is to do in the area, including any tourist packages available.

By understanding what unique interests or related interests your customers have, you can combine your service with their interests, revealing, once again, that you understand their needs and can be trusted to provide a solution.

**4\. Get inside their head.**

The goal of all of these questions is to get inside the customer’s head. What are they thinking, feeling, asking? What words, pictures, and information grab their attention and say “This business understands my problem\! They probably have the solution\!”

You want to ensure the customer that you understand exactly what their problem is, even if they don’t know themselves. As a result, they feel confident that your product is the solution.
