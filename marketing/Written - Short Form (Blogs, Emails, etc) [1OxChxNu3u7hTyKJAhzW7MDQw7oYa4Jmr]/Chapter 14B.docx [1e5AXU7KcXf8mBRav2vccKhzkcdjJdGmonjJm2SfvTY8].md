## **Living Minute by Minute**

It doesn't matter who you are or what you are trying to accomplish. There are times when you feel like you hit the wall, and you've hit a barrier that you simply don't know how to press through. Even though you've broken your task down into the next step, you simply can't figure out how to get it done.

That happened to me this morning.

I woke up this morning, completely exhausted, discouraged with my progress, and in a bad state of mind to keep pressing forward. No, it really doesn't sound impressive for someone who's intent on living life intentionally and making the most of every situation?

But it's true.

Every day, we compare our lives to the lives of the people around us. We look at all of the people who are successful, who seem to be doing so much better than ourselves, and we wonder what they did to deserve their great life. We question what we did to deserve what we've been given.

Most of all, we wonder how to get up and take the next step. How do we press through to the next level?

That was me this morning.

I made a decision. I knew that trying harder would only lead to burnout. I knew that trying to make things happen and make things work would only lead to unwanted stress. Before I even took a single step forward to my daily writing ritual, I took a step back.

I simply stepped back and reflected. I considered where I was, and how far I had come. I took the time to reflect on other people who've faced much greater and much more severe limitations, and I watched their cheerful attitude as they approached one challenge after another. As I watched, I felt the weariness wash away. I realized, once again, that I had not set an outrageous goal. I realized that all of this truly was possible. I realized that I was not a quitter, and I would not give up.

I happen to believe that the best way to keep pressing forward is not always by trying harder, but sometimes simply stepping back, and giving yourself room to be yourself. Sometimes the best thing that you can do is quit working and reflect, sharpen your focus, and go again.

## **Resting from the Rest**

Your stress can come from many different sources for many different reasons. But the fastest way that you can increase your stress is borrowing from the future.

Your ability to remain motivated and focused on the moment lies in your ability to live exclusively in the present. This doesn't mean that you don't plan, strategize, or cast vision for the future. But it does mean that you don't borrow from tomorrow.

Many times, we become so distracted with the things that will demand our attention in the future that we try to solve them before it's time. Rather than spending time intentionally resolving these issues, we instead worry about them. Rather than actively doing what we can now with the energy that we do have, we worry that we will never be able to accomplish everything tomorrow with the energy that we have today.

You must learn to break down your work by working on what you have today, then intentionally resting from everything that's left. You need the energy that you have right now to accomplish what you have directly in front of you, and if you squander it on worry, you will always do achieve much less than you intend.

Worry is a very simple, but very subtle vice. It's deceptive because it disguises itself as wisdom. It wraps itself in a problem that is unsolvable, and it simply poses as an interest in solving a specific problem. The trouble, however, is that it becomes fixated on solving a problem that, as of you, you have no answers.

Sometimes the best way you can solve your problems is first by acknowledging them, then by simply acknowledging that you don't have the full insight you need to solve it. You trust that you will find the answer when you are ready to implement it, and you don't force yourself to jump ahead in the process.

You trust that you will be able to seek out and apply insights from other people when you are ready. To rush ahead of the process makes no sense.

Many of us become so hurried in reaching our destinations and our goals that we overlook all of the pieces required to move us to that point. It is as foolish as a little child who is just learning how to crawl and becomes obsessed about being able to run so he can play a game of football. It simply makes no sense at this point of the journey to worry about how to run, simply because he is unprepared for that step.

You will always build your capacity by doing what you have the ability to do now. The child will crawl, awkwardly at first, then faster and faster. As he does everything he can, his ability expands. And he does it better and faster by focusing on one thing: doing what's in his capacity now.

## **Living in the Now**

In reality, you have only one time: that is now.

You cannot revisit your past, and you cannot live in the future. You have only one time: and that is the present. You will only ever be able to fully maximize your abilities if you choose to live fully in the present.

That means right now.

It means that if you nailed it yesterday, you get to celebrate your success, but you get to move on. It means that you failed miserably, you learn from your mistakes, but you let it go and keep pressing forward. It means that if you missed an opportunity, you let it go and you wait for the next one.

It also means you don't borrow from the future. You do the things that you need to do now, but you don't over-prepare for what is coming. You wait with an awareness that you will have time for the things you need time for.

You don't live in that unseen reality of "someday". You don't obsess over some kind of life that will always be better than where you are. You don't lose yourself in fantasies of a life that you promise you'll reach someday.

You live in the now.

That doesn't mean you don't learn from your past. It doesn't mean you don't think about your future. It doesn't mean you live for the moment. It simply means that you choose to live in the present.

Every moment that you waste is a moment that cannot be regained. To rest and recharge is not a waste. That is a critical part of living a healthy life. But you will never learn to rest if you are never able to live in the now.

When you are at work, are you thinking of when you can be at home?

When you are at home, are you thinking of what needs to be done at work?

When you are working on a project, are you thinking about what you'll be doing the rest of the day?

Again, you must choose to let them go. You must choose not to worry. You must focus on the moment that you have now, and trust that you will have the time that you need to resolve the other issues later.

## **Living in the Here**

Breaking down your work also means living "here".

If you are working a job that you hate, it means learning how to be fully present in that job. Of course, it will also probably mean taking deliberate steps to move yourself out of that situation. But the only way you can make those steps is to fully embrace the moment and live in the present.

It means that if you are in an important meeting with your colleagues, you are fully present in the conference room, not planning your next vacation.

It means that if you are at lunch with your friends, you are in the restaurant with them, not associating with all of your heroes on social media.

It means that when you come home to your family at night, your mind isn't in the office, finishing that report you were trying to finish.

It's discipline, and it's hard work. If it were easy, everyone would do it.

You will never be able to give your 100% if you are unwilling to embrace where you are right now. You will never have deep friendships, a great marriage, or great relationships with your kids if you're not willing to learn to become fully present in their lives.

Pay attention to the things that are going on around you. Pay attention to the people that you meet. Notice their attitudes, their expressions. Care about the things they care about. Ask about them, about their day, their week.

## **Sometimes You Can't Plan Ahead**

Sometimes all you can see is the next step.

We often hear in goal-setting the importance of setting the goals, getting the end picture, and determining how to get there. However, sometimes we cannot see the next step that's required.

Not every path that you take will come with a printed map. Sometimes the only thing that you know is a general sense of direction. But if that's all you have, that is all you need.

You don't always need to know the next step. You just need to know the step that you are on right now. And if you don't know that, just start by lifting your foot off the ground.

That's it.

Some days, we don't have a clear picture of where we're going, not because we're bad at planning. Sometimes our path simply doesn't allow us to see the whole picture.

When you're climbing a mountain, you can't see around every turn of the trail. You can't see every rock that you'll encounter. You can't see every obstacle. But you will never stop from climbing the mountain just because of that.

So it is in life. This morning, as I sat down to write, I realized how little of the big picture I was able to truly see and embrace. But I did know, beyond a shadow of doubt, the next step that was required for me to move forward.

I took that step.

Even though I had to take the time to find my rhythm, to figure out where I belong, to figure out how to move forward, I took that step.

The worst thing that you can do when you can't see the next step is to simply give up. As you invest in taking steps forward, don't lose the momentum that you've built. You may need to redirect it, but you needn't lose it.

## **Break it Down**

Don't overcomplicate the process. Break down where you want to go, and take another step. Don't lose yourself in the unknowns. Don't lose yourself in tomorrow. Don't worry about the things you don't see.

Just live.

Step outside, take a deep breath, and breathe in the cool morning air.

Look around at the wonder of the situation you're in. Find the things that you are grateful for. Learn to revitalize, to refocus.

Then take the next step\!

Some mornings, you won't be able to get started fast enough. Other mornings, you must give yourself room to find your rhythm. Give yourself permission to do that.

Then take the next step\!

Right now is the only moment you have.

Great works are not accomplished at one time. They are built moment by moment, hour by hour, day by day, month by month, and year by year.

Great people are not built in an instant. They are built moment by moment, choice by choice, action by action.

Be that person and determine to become someone great\!
