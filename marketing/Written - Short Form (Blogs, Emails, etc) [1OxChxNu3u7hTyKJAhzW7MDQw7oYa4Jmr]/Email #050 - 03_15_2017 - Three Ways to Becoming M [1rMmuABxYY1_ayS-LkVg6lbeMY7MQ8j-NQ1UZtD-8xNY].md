Nobody likes to work under a control freak. (Neither does anybody set out to be one\!) Yet they’re commonplace. 

In the last email, I said the only way to avoid becoming the dreaded control freak everybody hates was to adopt the three traits of a Lifelong Learner, the first being...

***Transparency.***

Transparency is a major buzzword these days and too often overrated. Nevertheless, it is an important trait to develop. So how do you ***actually*** go about building it?

Without transparency in a relationship, we get stuck behind our own facades: public personas that don’t reflect who we really are. These facades separate us from each other like walls between neighbors. They inhibit communication, teamwork, and camaraderie.

So, again, how do you develop healthy transparency? 

First, realize that transparency comes in layers. Not everyone deserves to hear everything about your life. However, there are a few things you can start doing right now to develop transparency and build trust in your relationships.

**1\. Share insignificant details about your personal life**

People are drawn toward people they know personally and can relate to. For example, your son's t-ball career may not seem significant to your employees or coworkers, but sharing that small detail of your life can break down the walls distancing yourself from others. The fact that you have a son who plays t-ball just like their son or daughter reminds them you’re a real person with an actual life, not just a money-making machine.

**2\. Readily admit when you’re wrong and someone else is right**

There is no virtue in being obstinate. If someone else’s idea is better than yours, *admit it*\! Seeing their ideas and contribution appreciated will prove that you’re a safe person to work with. (And that they play a critical role in the success of your business.)

**3\. Talk about the things that inspire or discourage you**

Closely related to the first one, talking about your own personal struggles or ambitions can go a long way in building camaraderie with people. More importantly, though, it gives them opportunities to speak into your life. If no one knows what discourages you, holds you back, or gives you an extra boost of momentum, no one can help you overcome those roadblocks. It’s lonely, discouraging, and greatly impedes your progress.

That’s why transparency is essential to building successful relationships in any arena of life. It’s the weld that holds relationships together. Without it, failure is inevitable. And those dangerous blind spots we talked about several weeks ago? They will be there until you develop transparency.

Transparency is the first step to becoming a ***Lifelong Learner***.

Do what it takes to tear down any walls between you and others around you by striving to be as transparent as possible. It will do more than anything to help you…

Be the best you\!

Email 2:  
**1\. You build trust by sharing personal information/struggles/joys/ambitions with people**

*Axed:*  
**3\. Ask questions about other people’s lives**

This might not immediately seem related to “transparency,” but it actually plays a significant role. Asking others about themselves stakes a surprising amount of vulnerability. This is why people generally trust those who (at the very least) seem interested in their lives. Ask your employees or co-workers about their dreams and desires. It may not (currently) be to stay with your company, but their trust in you will sky-rocket if they know you care about those details and want to help achieve them.
