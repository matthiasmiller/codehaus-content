Life can hit us hard, sometimes. An economic crash can put an entire country into poverty, a heart attack can take life right out from under your feet in a minutes, a delayed shipment can upend your business. No matter how much we try to avoid it, we all will--at some point--experience some form of hardship.

But 98-year-old Leo Kellner reminds the world that it’s not what happens to us that defines our legacies. It’s how we respond to our experiences that makes us truly great people.

In 2012, Kellner lost his wife after being married to her for 72 years. Instead of letting the grief destroy him, he started baking pies for people in need. According to Today.com, “\[Kellner\] reached out to local funeral homes and community organizations to let them know he’d like to connect with families having a hard time. Kellner then started reaching out to those families, getting to know them, and baking up some love during their time of need.”

He baked 144 pies the first year after his wife died. His generosity has reached far. He has  even received thank-you notes from families in Alaska\!

Generosity is one of the simplest ways we can make a big impact. Whether it’s with our time, money, or just our concern, every single one of us can change the world through simple acts of generosity.
