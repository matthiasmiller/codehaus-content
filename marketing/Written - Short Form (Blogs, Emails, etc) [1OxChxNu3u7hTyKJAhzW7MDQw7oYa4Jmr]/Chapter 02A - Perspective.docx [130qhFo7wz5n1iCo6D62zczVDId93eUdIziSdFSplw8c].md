# **Part: Overhaul Your Engine**

# **Chapter: Your Mindset and Perspective**

Your mindsets are the control center for your life.

Whether consciously or unconsciously, they dictate how you live your life. Like the engine in your car, they are often hidden deep underneath layers of grease and dirt. They are drowned out by the busy activities of today, the emotional distress, and the pressures of work.

You must learn to pay attention to them, or you will become victim to them. If they're harmful, they will hold you back without you realizing it. And if they're helpful, you might unknowingly surrender them without a second thought. However, with careful attention, you can leverage these powerful tools to your advantage.

Your mindset determines what your mind sees as a friend or foe, and like it or not, you will subconsciously guard yourself against any situations that challenge your existing mindset and beliefs. If you believe you were born to lose, you will find yourself sabotaging your own success. If by chance you happen to succeed, you will conclude that it was by accident, because your mind dare not reach conclusions that conflict with your underlying mindset.

That's why you must pay special attention to your mindset.

Are you aware of what you're thinking right now?

Maybe your friends are pursuing their dreams and advancing their careers. You find yourself thinking:

* I don't have enough money to pursue my dreams.

* I'm too busy to pursue my dreams.

* My dreams are not that important.

* I'm not smart enough to pursue my dreams.

You've just gotten a new promotion, and you might be thinking thoughts like:

* I hope nobody finds out that I'm not good enough.

* I have no idea what to do here.

* If I make a mistake, I'll completely blow it.

It's funny, of course, that you'd never be so cruel as to make these statements about your friends, but you willingly do it about yourself. These mindsets are holding you back from reaching your full potential. Many people try to achieve their dreams to convince themselves of the truth, not realizing that they must first believe the truth before they can achieve their dreams.

These thoughts aren't always conscious. They might be lurking in the back of your mind. Every once in a while, they stick their head out, look around, and tell you to quit trying to be successful. You might not be aware of them, but you can tell if they're at work in your life.

If you're having trouble achieving your dream, you're likely to have a few of these thoughts hanging around in the back of your head. You have to scare them out of the darkness, pull them into the light, then completely demolish them.

## **Even Your Emotions Listen to Your Beliefs**

Many people live under the tyranny of their emotions because they are unaware of their mindset. That's not to say that all of your emotions are driven by your mindset, but your mindset has a powerful effect on your emotions.

If you doubt me, just try this exercise: Spend a few minutes thinking about all of the mistakes you've made this past week, and start telling yourself what a horrible person you are. You will find your emotions spiraling downward.

Then, take a few minutes thinking about the things you've done right and about the things you're grateful for. You will find that your emotions being climbing upward.

Unless you take charge of your thoughts, you will live under the tyranny of your emotions. You get to listen to the pulse of your feelings and start becoming self-aware.

Most people, when they find themselves getting anxious or angry, immediately begin looking to their situation, trying to decide what to change. However, I like taking this one step further. When this happens to me, I take a step back and ask myself, "What am I thinking? What mindset is challenging me right now?"

I take a few moments to think about it and probe a bit. Sometimes the answer is obvious the moment I ask the question, but it doesn't always come right away. Sometimes it comes the next day or the next week. Sometimes it's even months or years away, but it always come.

When you begin to change your mindsets, you open the door to transformation.

Learn to manage your mindset, and you'll learn to manage your emotions.

Let's take a look at several important mindset changes.

## **Mindset Shift: From Scarcity to Abundance**

My grandfather grew up on a farm in the great depression. During that time, you pinched pennies because you had to. You didn't have a choice. If you wanted to survive, you had to do it.

My father was raised in that environment, and even though his perspective greatly changed, he was influenced by growing up in that kind of perspective.

To some degree, that was the exact mindset I held. When I got married, I stared my beliefs in the face and was forced to reexamine my perspective.

It didn't matter how much money I had in my bank account, I was haunted by this belief, "You don't have enough." I would worry, work harder, and frustrate my wife because I was never able to make any financial decision without emotions of caution, hesitancy, and fear.

That was my perspective on money.

I gradually changed my perspective to the simply belief, "You will always have enough." And you know what?

I've been in times that are much tougher, much tighter, with more financial obligations, and I've always found that there is enough. Even more, I can live in those situations without fear or anxiety, because I know--there is always enough. Now, my financial decisions are being shaped by intentionality rather than fear, and I'm able to make better financial decisions.

But the abundance mindset moves far beyond finances.

It is a belief that there is room enough for everyone.

As a young determined individual, looking to get ahead in the world, make a difference and make something of myself, I found myself becoming jealous of others around me who were being promoted.

I realized that I had a flawed perspective--that every promotion someone else got was one fewer promotion that I could get. I thought we were all taking slices out of the same pie, and I didn't realize that we were only making the pie bigger.

That's the essence of generating wealth: making the pie bigger.

It also kept me from being able to pursue my own potential, because I feared that if I truly pursued my own potential, I would block out others from being able to be who they truly wanted to be.

But when my perspective changed, I began being able to celebrate other people's promotions, and I was happy whether I received recognition or not.

## **Mindset Shift: Failure from a Foe to a Friend**

Most of my life, I tied my self-worth to my own performance. I was one of the most driven students in my high school, setting school records for the amount of work I could get done in a single year. Because of that, I completed high school in three years.

Looking back, it's not something I'm completely proud of, because I see what was motivating me. People around me may have seen it as a sort of phenomenon, but if they saw the downside, they never told me.

The truth was, I hated to fail. I hated any semblance to failure.

I remember hating my music class because it was one class where I couldn't get an A. Getting a B was too close to failure. It was below my dignity.

If I would publicly fail or get embarrassed, it would throw me completely off kilter. I would do everything I could not to make those kinds of mistakes, and as a result, I ended up playing it safe.

It took me years to unravel my self-worth from my own performance, giving myself the grace and the courage that I needed to fail. But every single day, it gets easier and easier.

Why?

Because I now know that failure doesn't have to be the end of the story.

Failure is one of the best teachers of all times. It will teach you lessons that you will not learn any other way. It's a badge of honor, because you know you were in the middle of the fight, trying do something that mattered, while others merely watched on the sidelines.

Best of all, failure does not mean that you are one. Who I am as a person does not get to be defined by my successes and my failures, and that's why I can embrace failure.

Until you embrace this truth, you will always find yourself running from things that you fear, avoiding setbacks, and avoiding risk.

You have to see failure as a friend, and discomfort as something to embrace.

## **Mindset Shift: Rethinking Your Limits**

What gets to define the limits on your life?

Jennifer Bricker is an American acrobat and aerialist. The only trouble is, she has no legs. And yet, she has learned to push through incredible obstacles to get to where she is today.

In a very telling interview, she said, "Can't is not part of your vocabulary. If you just put your mind to it, you can do it."

Her parents empowered to live without limits, opening her up to more possibilities than most children have who live in normal circumstances. She said, "If you were never given limits, then you think you can anything."

When she was seven years old, she decided she wanted to become a tumbler, and by the time she was in high school, she became the tumbling champion of the state of Illinois.

That was only the beginning.

What are your limits? Is it your age? It is your ability? Is it the incredible odds? Is it that it has never been done?

What if you live as though those limits don't exist? What would your life look like?

What perspective would you have to take in life, if you were able to see yourself as literally having no limits?

## **Understanding the Power of Perspective**

The perspective that you take can make the difference between a life that runs smoothly and a life that runs in fits and spurts. It can be the difference between being stuck in a problem or in finding a solution and creating breakthrough.

Yes, it's that powerful\!

it can be the difference between a day starting out happy or a day starting out grouchy, on the completely wrong note. I can be the difference between a lost client or a lost sale or a sick child being a setback or being an advantage.

That's your perspective.

You cannot control other people's actions, but you can control your own.

And you can choose your own perspective.

Being able to maximize your personal freedom means being able to choose the perspective in whatever arena of life you're in.

## **Don't Always Push Harder**

When we face a problem, we often instinctively try to push harder. Sometimes that's the right solution. We know that we need to push through the barrier so that we can get to the next level.

But oftentimes, we are so busy pushing harder that we forget to take a step back and look for a different perspective. We need to ask ourselves questions like:

* What are ways that I could do this differently?

* if I didn't know what I already know, how would I approach this?

* If I had to come up with the most ridiculous solution, what would I come up with?

* If I talked with a friend of mine (think of someone specific), what would they tell me to try?

Force yourself to step out of your own shoes and look at the problem from a different perspective, and you will find yourself with insight into how to move through the situation.

That's the power of perspective. In fact, most of the beliefs that you hold, in how you approach the world, have more to do with creating a healthy set of eyes at which to look at the world.

## **Perspective: Big or Little?**

As an individual who loves to write, I always dreamed of writing a full-length book, but I never believed it to be fully possible. That is, not until I actually sat down, calculated:

* how many pages I need for a book

* how many words to a page

* how many minutes to type those words

I soon figured out that in less than an hour a day, with a bit of focus, I could write a full-length draft in only six weeks.

That's a full book in thirty hours.

Meanwhile, in my mind, I had always thought it would take weeks, months, or even years to finish a book. Suddenly my perspective changed from "this is something that I ought to do someday" to "this is something that I absolutely must invest my time in doing today."

Your perspective is essential to your motivation to keep moving and keep pushing through your barriers.

## **Perspective in Uncertainty**

Perspective is one of the most difficult things to maintain, especially when you are moving into a new area of influence or responsibility. Many people struggle with self-doubt in these situations, and it's important to be able to reframe your situation to be able to function well and perform well.

It's important that you be especially intentionally in checking your mindset and your perspective in these situations. Otherwise, you will find yourself keeping yourself from reaching your full potential and embracing the discomfort of where you are.

There are a few critical perspectives you ned to keep in mind as you transition.

## **The Illusion of Going Backwards**

Do you remember what it was like to go on road trips as a child, and every time you looked out the window to watch a semi pass you, it felt like you were going backwards? Even though you were moving forward, the simple fact that someone else was moving faster than you and that it had your full focus and attention meant that it FELT to you like you were going backwards.

That's what it's like moving into a new realm.

If you're the leader of your pack, you have no one else to compare it to. You're the one making everyone else feel like they're going backwards (if they choose to focus on you). However, when you're in a new situation, you're challenging yourself and stretching your abilities. You're surrounded by people that are better than you.

And if you're doing it alone, you're reading the books and watching the trainings of people who are ten times better than you. As you grow and consume information, as you learn to do your job well, many people become more insecure about how they'll perform.

When you are focused on a job that you've mastered, your focus becomes on everything that you know. People come to you for advice, and you can give it. However, when you move into a new role that is uncomfortable to you, you become more aware of everything that you don't know. To make matters worse, the more that you learn, the more you realize how little you know.

This perspective gives many people the illusion of going backwards when they are really going forward. In fact, the harder you're pushing yourself, the more disorienting it can be.

Let me give you some examples.

That's exactly what it was like when I got married. I tell people that I was a much kinder, selfless person before I got married. of course, everyone knows that's a lie\! The truth of the matter was, I had just gotten a new standard for myself. Before, I could be selfish and unkind, and in most of interactions with others, it wouldn't hurt anyone or have any consequences. It felt that I had suddenly become a more selfish person, when in reality I had only become more aware of the need to step up my game.

I was looking out my window and watching semis pass me.

One of my clients recently moved into a new leadership role and faced an incredibly challenging season of his life, as he tried to navigate through the responsibilities of life. His own assessment of himself was consistently different from those of others, because he entered into a keen awareness of the things he needed to learn.

This awareness can be helpful as we move into new areas, but unless we are careful, this awareness will discourage us and keep us from being aware of everything that we have to offer.

## **Perspective Changes What You See**

There was a man who was moving to a new town. He was on the train, and the train pulled up to a station. He got off the train, looked around, and saw an elderly man sitting on a park bench. He asked hi=m, "What are the towns people like here?"

The old man replied, "What are they like where you come from?"

The man replied, "Oh, they are rude and obnoxious,. They don't care about anyone, and they are all looking after their own interests."

The old man replied, That's exactly what they are like here. So the man boarded the train and headed on his way.

An hour later, another man stepped off the train and asked the man the same question, "What are the townspeople like here?"

The old man asked again, "What were they like where you came from?"

The man replied, "Oh they were the most friendly people, always looking out for each other, always caring about each other., They always wished the best and tried to help everyone succeed."

The old man smiled. "Well, that's exactly what the townspeople are like here\!"

The old man had learned an important lesson in life--that most of people's complaints or satisfaction came from a simple ability--the ability to choose a good perspective.. One man chose to focus on everyone's faults, and he was completely correct. But the second man chose to focus on everyone's strengths, and he was also completely correct.

But only one of those man was truly happy to be around others--and I'm sure that only one of those men had true friends who enjoyed spending time with him as well\!

When you interact with the people around you, you have a choice to focus on the things you like or you dislike.

Your boss might have an annoying habit of interrupting you. It might feel like he's micromanaging you. But you can reframe that--because some bosses are completely indifferent to what you're up to

You might have a friend who always manages to make others look bad, and you don't want to spend time with them, because you anticipate that always happening. Now, I'm not saying that it's healthy to allow those people to influence you, but what about your perspective? Are you able to find one or two things that this person is exceptionally good at and think about those things when you think about them?

That's the power of perspective.
