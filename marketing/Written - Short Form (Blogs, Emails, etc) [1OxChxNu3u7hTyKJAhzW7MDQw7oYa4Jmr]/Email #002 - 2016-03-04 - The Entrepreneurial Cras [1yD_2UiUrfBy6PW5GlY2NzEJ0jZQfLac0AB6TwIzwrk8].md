My colleague Josh reminisced to me about his high school days. His fellow classmates would constantly fluctuate between working hard and slacking off.

One week they’d party as much as they could and the next week they worked overtime to cram for the deadline. The second the deadline was over, they’d kick back and relax until their laziness caught up with them, and they would start their next race against the clock. 

Sometimes we inadvertently adopt a high school work ethic. We sprint hard for a while making sales and completing projects, only to crash from exhaustion.

It’s crucial that we find a sustainable pace for the long haul, asking questions like:

- How do I balance “tangible results” with “mundane management”?  
- What are absolute essentials that only I can do?  
- Who do I need to train or hire to do some of my work for me?  
- How many hours do I need to rest physically and mentally per week so I don’t crash a few weeks or months down the road?

No one can sprint for extended periods of time. Find the pace that works for you and do whatever it takes to stay in the race for the long haul.

And always remember, be the best you.

# **Business cycles and pacing**

Josh told the story this morning about how when he was in high school, some of the students would go back-and-forth between high privilege and low privilege. This is a lot like some business owners where they go from a boom to bust sales cycle. This is more than a treadmill, because a truck noble actually stabilize you because you set the pace at which you're willing to go.

However, if you're unable to pace self, you will run at sprints and then wear yourself out. This is the same kind of effect that happens to runners when they don't pace themselves. But the key is to learn how to pace yourself and follow that pace at a sustainable rate.
