Alex just took out a loan to make his payroll. His wife's bloodshot eyes remind him his worrisome tossing and turning keeps her awake at night. He's faced with racing thoughts he can't seem to control, problems he can’t stop spinning around, and an empty feeling in his gut he can’t medicate away.

His experience in business hasn’t been fun, to say the least. What seemed like a fresh new vision, has turned into a whirling nightmare. And it’s taking it’s toll on his health, on his bank account, and on his marriage.

“This will never work,” he decides. “It will never take off. I can’t get noticed by new customers. I can’t get referrals from old ones--this just isn’t working. I’m giving my best, but my customers must still not be satisfied. I’m a failure.”

Experience will teach you more than a thousand books ever will. But depending on how you interpret your experience, what you learn may be valuable or detrimental. It is vital that you pay attention to what you let your experiences tell you.

For example, what Alex is feeling may be true, to some degree. His customers may not be satisfied, even though he is giving his best. But that doesn’t mean his venture is a failure. There may be open doors for opportunities all around him and this struggle may simply be the hallway leading him to those doors.

He could either let this lack of referrals be a discouragement or extra motivation to build deeper relationships with his customers so that they want to give referrals. It could either end his career or force him to discover new and more effective ways to gain referrals.

The things you learn from your experience does not rely strictly on your circumstances but on your perspective of that experience.

Alex could say with just as much conviction, "This is taking a lot of time and work to get started, but it has the potential to be something really great. So I’m going to stick at it and find effective ways to get those referrals."

What about you? 

Maybe you’ve had a prospect get upset during a conversation and refuse to talk with you. 

"I'm really bad at communicating with customers" you tell yourself, spending the rest of the day discouraged. But later you learn her mother was recently diagnosed with cancer and has little time to live. 

Are you a bad communicator? Did you respond wrongly? Possibly, but it certainly wasn’t a business-damning failure. And it certainly wasn’t worth spending the day discouraged. Correct any mistakes, write a thoughtful sympathy card, and turn it into a relationship building opportunity. 

Instead of letting the experience simply inform you that you’re a bad communicator: Use it to identify your weakness and let it teach you how to communicate better and how to redeem even your mistakes into opportunities.

It is important we find ways to create wins for ourselves, such as turning a discouraging conversation into a relationship building opportunity.

What is your experience actually telling you?

Learn from that, research and explore it, and give yourself permission to grow.

When experiences are used rightly, they give powerful insight not only into what you're doing but into who you are.

And always remember, be the best you\!
