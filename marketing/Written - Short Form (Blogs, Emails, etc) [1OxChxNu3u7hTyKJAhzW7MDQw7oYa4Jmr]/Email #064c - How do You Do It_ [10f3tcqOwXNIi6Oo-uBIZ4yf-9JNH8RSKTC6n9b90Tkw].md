With series… keep in mind autoresponder sequences.

Could make this series effective, tie in Matthias’ personal story with it all. 

Perry Marshall’s burning bus series. He leads you through it with cliffhangers at the end of every email.

Focus on Matt’s story as it relates to this ^^^

NIGHTMARE STORY: Matt working solo on project, on wife’s birthday, so stressed and out of it, that he barely was even able to celebrate her birthday after he got home from work.
