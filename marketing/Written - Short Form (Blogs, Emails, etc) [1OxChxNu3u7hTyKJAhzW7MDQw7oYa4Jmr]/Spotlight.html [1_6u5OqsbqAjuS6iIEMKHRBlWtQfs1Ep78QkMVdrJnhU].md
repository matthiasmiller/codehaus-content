# **Spotlight**

Some people are scared of the spotlight, because they are afraid that when they get in the spotlight people will see that they are not as successful as they appear. They are afraid that people will begin to see their flaws and will doubt their confidence in them

This is a variant of the imposter syndrome. The only difference is that it happens before success comes.

Many times this is a ridiculous fear because these people do not actually get the spotlight that they anticipate. Why not wait to worry about this problem until they actually reach that point?
