“Just a few more minutes of sleep,” Brian moaned still half asleep.

The sheets twisted around his body as he rolled over to look at the clock, again, which now read: *6:46 A.M.* 

*“Ugh\!”* he thought. *“I’m still so tired\! I don’t need to start work until eight, so I’ll skip my jog and sleep another fifteen minutes.”*

The rationale seemed logical and the sleep so much more desirable than the exercise at the moment. Later in the day, however, as he looked at the developing pouch around his midsection, he scolded himself for being lazy and recommitted to his morning exercise routine. Just as he had done the day before, and the day before that, and the day before that… 

You get the picture. Brian is a procrastinator.

Have you ever been in Brian’s situation? Perhaps you are right now\! Perhaps there’s some other pressing task you are avoiding by checking your email. To be honest, there are some distractions tempting me from focusing on this email. 

We all struggle to feel motivated at times. 

Sometimes we’re like Brian, struggling to get out of our comfortable beds, so we rationalize why something doesn’t need to be done *now* and indulge in a few more winks.

Other times, we’re distracted by good things, like organizing our desks or checking our email. But all of these should take lower priority if the accountant needs a financial report done by noon and it’s 11:15 A.M. 

If you’ve been in this place, take heart\! You’re not alone\!

*“I know this article is due tonight, but I’m just not motivated to write\!” “I know we need more sales calls, but I don’t feel like getting rejected a hundred times\!” “I know relationships are strained at home, but calling a family meeting seems so stressful.”*

We’ve all mentally acknowledged “such and such” needs to be done, but struggled to find the drive or desire to do it.

In reality, these moments of procrastination probably have little to do with “laziness” or lack of motivation (or whatever you chide yourself for).

**Rather, they often result from a lack of *clarity*.**

Momentum and motivation plummet when we forget what we’re striving toward and (more importantly) why we’re striving toward it.

We come up with a million excuses. “*My mind will be clearer tomorrow.*” “*I’ll watch just one more episode.*” “*I need to clean my desk.*”

During these moments, we should remind ourselves what we actually need to get done.

* *“I need to make 10 sales calls.”*   
* *“This order needs to be shipped by Friday.”*   
* *“I need to write a letter to my parents.”*

And often, we may need to dig even deeper to the “Big Why.”

* *“Making these calls will promote my business, which is helping to create jobs for people in need.”*  
* *“Fulfilling this order ahead of time will delight my customer and they’ll be more likely to support my business in the future.”*  
* *“Writing this letter will encourage my parents, because they have been so lonely lately. They deserve to hear from me.”*

If you find yourself struggling with motivation, instead of beating ourselves up over it, take some time to remember “the what” and “the why.”

It might only take five seconds. It might mean dedicating one morning to journal. Maybe a walk to clear your head is all you need.

In fact, I’ve started doing that every single morning. Why don’t you do the same?

It is important to keep a razor sharp focus on “the what” and “the why” so in every moment you can strive to...

Be the Best You\!

# **Personality and Breakthrough**

I’m going to be honest with you: I think most of what we’re taught about motivation is nonsense.

There has to be something that allows me to access the "Lion" or "D" within me to get the results that I need to get. How can I train myself to move into different arenas?

Also, how can I learn how to honor and enter into the "Beaver" or "C" personality type? This is a key about what I don't enjoy Church or some aspects of it. This is why I find it so utterly boring at times. There is little or no activity or change. This is also why some people get so restless in church and other situations. It takes years to get to the punchline.

There is also a dramatic shift in the emotional state of the service. One of the reasons why people don't share in family altar is because of the lowered emotional state of the service. You can see people getting stuck in anxious boredom. 

There is also a high need to technical accuracy and official endorsement etc. 

What if I would invest considerably more effort in thinking about how to contribute to the church? What are the raw actions that are needed? If I can tap into this at will, it would give me a huge shift.

This is where personal development meets spirituality.

The message today was about choices and the long term impact of those choices. I had a hard time picking that up.

Wow, so I would also say this is a lot of raw, unfiltered processing. :-)

I think the huge thing for me is “Harnessing Your Natural Grit” or **Flipping the Motivation Switch** or something like that. Deadlines are the things that really kick it into action, and if it’s not that, it’s sometimes having a new project with a TON of momentum.

However, the deadlines have been useful for me. For some people, the best way to approach it is to build it. For others, it’s to experiment. Other people have to get the facts. Whatever it is, we need to help people get into the zone.

When you can find that, you can “flip” your switch on or off at will. It puts you in charge of your motivation.

Personally, I think there are a lot of nonsense views about motivation. Everyone is motivated. You just have to understand where and how.

If you put researchers in charge of an organization, it will slow down. If visionaries/entrepreneurs run it by themselves, they will take into utter chaos.

The key is learning how let people be themselves

A person with a typical **type C personality** appears to lack emotions, does not usually assert themselves and wants to pacify others.

**Type D personality**, a concept used in the field of medical psychology, is defined as the joint tendency towards negative affectivity (e.g. worry, irritability, gloom) and social inhibition (e.g. reticence and a lack of self-assurance).

***NOTES:***

- *Different people are motivated differently*  
- *Clarity is crucial, whenever I have lack of clarity is when I get bogged down*  
- *For Matt, urgency is important, but it’s not that way for everybody*  
- *A lot of people say we’re motivated by rewards, sometimes that’s the case*  
- *You push through your day job to do your own thing. That’s what’s motivating you to push through your day job/lose sleep*  
- *Some people are very motivated to start projects, some are motivated to finish projects. Kolbe angle, some people are motivated to start new ideas, some people are motivated to prioritize and systematize*  
- *Some people are motivated to see tangibles, to see the finish project, build a house and see the actual product*

Do you ever struggle to feel motivated in your day-to-day routines?

If so, you’re not alone\! Many of us feel the same way.

*“I just wasn’t motivated to get started on work today.” “I don’t feel motivated to sell my product.” “I’m motivated to pursue relationships.”*

We mentally acknowledge that “such and such” needs to be done, but there’s no drive, no desire--no *motivation*\--to do it.

I’m going to be honest with you: I think most of what we’re taught about motivation is nonsense. 

The reality is, everyone is motivated. We just don’t always understand *where* and *how*.

For example, we visionaries do well at leading organizations because they have a strong idea of where they want to go. But we often get bogged down in the details along the way.

We know where we want to go, but we lack motivation to do the things that will get us there.

So if we run the organization by ourselves, we will take it into utter chaos. Thus, we need more detail oriented people to help us research, plan, and execute the important details. 

However, if you put these researchers in charge, the organization will slow it down. 

The key is learning how to let people be themselves, while also stretching them to grow and learn.

Be the Best You\!
