Multiply Your Strengths is a qualified solution provider for AppHosting.zone. While we've described solutions that we've built using the AppHosting.zone platform, we've also been deeply involved in helping them develop their marketing strategy.

At the time, the AppHosting.zone platform had already been used for years by Fortune 500 clients. However, the platform was going to market for small- to medium-sized businesses for the first time. The challenge was simple: make it easier to close contracts by demonstrating the established credibility within this space.

Our consulting relationship started with a Marketing & Strategy Deep Dive (multiplier.link/deep-dive). This process began with an in-depth interview to understand details such as the competitive landscape, business strategy, marketing objectives, and the unique challenges that they face.

While this initial interview was very extensive and in-depth, it played a critical role in clarifying the current needs and direction not only for us, but also for our client.

Once we completed the initial interview, we organized the details from the interview and took it into our "think tank". We attacked this from every angle we could think of. We dug into the competitive advantage, positioning, branding, marketing opportunities, and additional business growth opportunities. We identified potential points of confusion within the business structure, as well as specific ways to clarify them. We covered not only high-level strategy, but also dug into more specific tactical items, including specific marketing verbiage they could use.

Once we emerged from the "think tank", we organized and published our ideas into a 17-page personalized report. This report included very specific instructions: "Don't use the entire report. Find the 1 or 2 best insights that you can use now, and leverage them to grow your business. As you grow, keep reviewing this report for new ideas and opportunities to grow."

This 17-page document guided our 45-minute follow-up interview, where we explored each of these ideas more thoroughly, reviewed them with our client, found additional details or opportunities to include in the report, and answered specific questions.

With the client's final feedback in our hands, we completed a final revision of the report and sent off their completed copy.

Since then, the insights from the Marketing & Strategy Deep Dive report have allowed AppHosting.zone to land bigger contracts. This also laid the foundation for the AppHosting.zone website.
