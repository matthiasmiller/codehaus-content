# **Chapter: Trusting the Process**

When you're facing a new direction in life, you're immediate confronted with lots of questions. Do you have what it takes to get you there? Will you have the courage to follow through? Will you get the results that you want?

Manny people fear failure, because they're afraid of finding themselves in unrecoverable situations. They're afraid of going past the point of no return. Just like the people in Christopher Columbus's day, they are scared of dropping off the earth if they move beyond the horizons.

Even worse, sometimes these people take it upon themselves to warn you of the dangers of dropping off the horizon, of going past the point of no return.

I have just one question for those people.

If Christopher Columbus didn't reach the land he was aiming for, did he fail in his mission? Today, despite the fact that Columbus was searching for Indian spices and landed on America, we still celebrate him as having discovered land.

Something curious happened with our perception of him before and after he sailed. Before he sailed, he was foolish. After he sailed--and found the wrong country--he was celebrated.

Columbus was not the only one. Many famous individuals faced severe setbacks throughout their life--financially successful people encountering bankruptcy multiple times in their life. Sports figures encounter defeat after defeat before finally breaking through into victory.

We read of individuals who were born without legs, or who suffered tragic accidents. Yet, they managed to return to life with a vengeance and truly make a difference.

All of these people had one simple skill in common: they were able to leverage their failures and setbacks and use them to their own advantage

## **Take a Moment to Imagine**

Take a moment to imagine what life would be like if every single situation that came to you, whether seemingly good or positive, had the ability to move you closer to your destiny? What if every setback had hidden within it a little element of power that could propel you forward to the next step?

What would happen if you knew that you had an ability to take every situation and use it for good?

Have you ever heard anyone ask you the question, "What would you do if you knew you could not fail?" When you hear that question, do you hear it as a hypothetical question, or do you hear it as a possibility? Do you hear it within the framework of your current way of thinking, or do you hear an invitation into a bigger way of thinking about your life?

The truth is that you can develop this skill, and it's much simpler than you might suppose. It comes down to two factors: trusting and learning. And both of those skills are skills that you can develop.

## **Trusting**

When you were first beginning to walk, you stumbled from one place to the next. You were hesitant, waiting to take the next step. You took one step after another, but gradually you learned that when you put your foot forward and balanced your weight, you could propel yourself forward.

Today, you don't much time worrying that when you take the next step, whether you might lose your balance or your legs might give way or you might go backwards. No, you've learned the process of walking, and you've given so much trust to that process that you know that when you move your legs and shift your weight forward, it will take you into the future.

Even though your body is doing countless calculations and movements in every step, you're not worried about the outcome. That's because you're relying on a process that works.

The first step in leveraging the negative to your benefit is to simply trust the process.

Many people have a fear that when they start something, they'll be starting something that is fundamentally broken. They fear that they're embarking on a journey that is doomed to start. The truth is that they're embarking on a journey that's full of ups and downs, twists and turns.

If they are willing to stop when they encounter hardship or difficulty, then they are right--they will fail. If their focus is on everything that they've accomplished now, and only on the things they have produced, they are right--they might have failed.

But the process is not merely about producing tangible results. The process is about developing yourself--gaining the skills that you need, learning the difficult lessons, developing the resilience against failure, managing your perspective.

The difficulty, then, is simply learning to trust that as you intentionally develop yourself through these challenges, you have nothing to fear. You can trust that, no matter what the circumstances yield, you will be better for it.

## **Develop a Lifestyle of Growth**

Many people do not approach the unknown with full abandon, because of three fundament beliefs about themselves:

* I don't know how to take lessons from my experience.

* I don't know how to learn what I need to learn.

* I don't know how to finish what I haven't started.

All of these questions involve either skills or mindsets that need to be changed in order to face the unknown, so let's face them one by one.

## **Learning from Your Experience**

Many people learn from their experiences, but many people do not know what to learn from their experiences, because their learning is rooted in a belief that what they're doing is not possible.

I used to continually bump my head up against challenges, and I was unable to follow through and move into the next level because when I had a negative experience, I faced it with the belief that what I was accomplishing something that wasn't possible. The conclusions that I drew would invariably prevent me from making any forward progress.

For example, if I had a difficult sales conversation with a prospect, I was more likely to believe that what I was doing was impossible. As I started changing my core belief, I stopped questioning whether what I was doing was possible. Instead, I began asking a different question, "How is this possible?"

I started looking back at my experiences and asking the question, "What would I need to do differently next time to be at least slightly more effective?"

Did I engage them well? Did I listen to them well? Did I understand what they truly needed? Was I truly speaking their language? Where did the conversation begin to die?

Given those lessons, I tweak the way I approach my next conversation.

I use the exact same principle in my marriage.

My wife and I have agreed that we simply will not allow divorce as an option for us. When we encounter a conflict, we refuse to ask the question, "Can this relationship work out?" The question always is, "How can we resolve this conflict? The lessons I learn from conflict are never that I married the wrong person. The question is, rather: "What do we need to learn from this situation to grow personally and make our relationship better?"

Sometimes when we encounter conflict, we take note of what causes the conflict, and we learn that certain conversations will introduce conflict in someone else. We then begin to avoid that person, or avoid certain conversations with that person, because we've learned that those are difficult conversations to have.

Unfortunately, this is a flawed lesson from our experience. The real lesson that we must learn is not that we must avoid that conversation. No, the real lesson to learn is to discover, if possible, what is motivating the other people. The real lesson is to seek to understand, and if possible, to seek to give them opportunity to disclose what's going on inside of them.

It doesn't happen immediately. It doesn't even happen all the time. Not everyone is open to growth or confrontation, or even openness. But the lesson we learn must not be to immediately shut other people out because of conflict. Again, this approach is built upon the assumption that resolution of the conflict is not possible, and we give up because of that.

The conclusions that we draw from our experiences are critical, and finding helpful, supportive lessons within your experiences is what will keep you moving forward toward your goals.

## **Learning What to Learn**

Your challenge with dealing with the unknown is making it knowable. The fear of the unknown is built upon this fear that you will not be able to take the unknown and turn it into something knowable. If you knew what you needed to know, you could dismantle the fear.

Many people assume that the only way they can dismantle the fear is by filling in the things that they don't know. This, however, is a monumental task, and one that, if you devote your entire lifetime to, you will still face things that you don't know. Obviously, trying to fill in all the missing pieces in what you don't know isn't a reasonable solution. You don't have a lifetime to spend before you overcome your fear of the unknown.

The real solution, then, is developing the ability to learn the pieces of the puzzle that you don't know, and applying them. Once you have mastered this ability, the things that you don't know aren't going to inhibit you, because you've found a way to consistently find the things that are holding you back, fill in the missing pieces, and take the next step forward.

To do this, you need to be able to look at your situation, and start looking for the things that you don't know that are critical to you moving forward. If you don't know what they are, finding those pieces is the first step.

You must intentionally take the first step, and if you don't know the first step, you must intentionally seek out the first step and take it. And once you've completed that first step, you must seek out the second step, and take it.

And suddenly, you've relinquished to know the whole picture, and you've moved from trying to figure out everything to simply taking the next step.

This ability is also what takes the fear and sting out of failure. If you know that, from any situation or any setback, you can look at the situation, find the missing pieces, overcome the obstacles and move forward.

## **Learning to Finish What You Haven't Started**

As soon as we voice the false expectation that we have, it disappears into the smoke of false illusion.

We can never finish what we haven't started. Yet, many times we refuse to start what we haven't finished.

We are, again, fearful that we will encounter a situation that we will be unable to recover from. We are fearful that we will find a fork in the road that, rather than yielding another fork or path to a new destination, will simply yield a dead-end.

We fear that we will encounter unsolvable problems, and that because of unsolvable problems, we will be forced to admit defeat. We fail to recognize that no road is a dead-end unless we fail to leverage it for our own good.

As an entrepreneur, your first venture may fail, but it will give you in-the-trenches education that no business major will learn in school.

We often assume that people who achieve greatness did so because they were able to visualize their ultimate destination--that they knew from the very beginning exactly what their end game would look like, and that they were able to control every situation to the end.

Yes, these leaders had visions of the future, ideas of a better tomorrow--but they started with a thousand details that were unknown or unclear. They didn't embark merely on a destination to their future. They set out on journey, trusting their skills to navigate the way, knowing that it would ultimately take them to the places they needed to go.
