Zion’s New Hands

We live in an age of astounding technological, informational, and communicative progress. When it comes to innovation and inventions, there has truly been no other age like the present  (that we know of). And few fields have seen more progress than the medical field. Even amidst all of our contemporary disagreements about medical insurance, no one can deny there’s never been a better time for medicine.

This was proven two years ago when the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia completed an extraordinary double hand transplant on a little boy.

According to the CHOP.edu, Zion Harvey developed a life-threatening infection when he was just two years old. The infection first affected his kidneys, resulting in his mom donating one of her own to save his life. But it eventually grew so bad, even his hands and feet needed to be amputated.

Nevertheless, Zion grew to be a healthy, mature boy and learned to survive without hands. Finally, in 2015, doctors found two hands that were a match for Zion and he underwent the ten and a half hour transplant surgery.

Today, according to CNN.com, Zion is capable of performing everyday  tasks like every other child his age, even to the point of grasping a baseball bat. He’s mature, positive and grateful for the new opportunities given to him.

Isn’t it amazing what progress and technology God has gifted our generation with medically? Even as we strive to progress in our own lives, relationships, and businesses, let’s never take for granted how far we’ve already come.
