## **Narrowing Your Focus**

The goal of defining your mission is like clarifying a path on the map. Even though the details of how you will reach your destination may change, you want to have a clear pathway of the means of how you will accomplish your purpose and your vision.

For a season of your life, you may invest most of your time in learning and education. You may invest your time in low-paying ventures for high-payoff. You may engage in challenging situations in order to accomplish this vision.

The difficulty for many people is the unwillingness to say no to other ventures. Many people want to accomplish everything, and by doing so, they accomplish nothing. The goal of defining your focus on your mission is to clarify the skills that you want to continue developing and sharpening during the current season of life.

It is not only the skills you want to say yes to, but it will define opportunities it will require you to say no to. Every situation that you are in will be leveraged around this common mission.

When you are in the heat of the battle, your focus isn't always on the big picture. It's often on the action that's directly in front of you. IN the same way, you cannot always remain deeply in touch with your vision. That's why it's important to define each of these pieces very clearly, so that you can execute on them without worrying that it will take you further astray.

Sometimes your mission may continue for days with no seeming results. Sometimes you will be tempted to abort it, and sometimes that temptation is fully justified. Other times, however, you will be tempted to abort on the day before significant breakthrough.

That's because your mission is sometimes nothing less than all-out war.

Sometimes it means saying no to a hundred things just so that you can conquer one more achievement. Sometimes it means saying no to a hundred other distractions so you can enter into your intensely creative mode.

Your plan to accomplish your vision must center on an increasingly narrow focus, and you must be willing to commit to it without fear that you're missing out on things around you.

To give a very simple example, people who drive on the road never complain about the silly lines pained on the road. Of course, people may choose to violate the laws, passing in no-passing zones. However, they do this not only at their own risk, but at the risk of other people coming their way. Even further, they will not venture outside of the lines, especially when they are driving up a mountain, with a hundred-foot drop-off right beside them.

These lines, rather than restrictive, are their guide, giving them the ability to focus their direction on how to reach their destination. Rather than confining them, it gives them the freedom to focus on what's most important: getting to their destination.

In the same way, choosing to restrict how you will embody your vision (at least during this season of life) gives you the ability to focus on a specific part of execution, without worrying that you will drop off the edge of a cliff into a ravine.

## **Maintaining the Vision**

Having said all of that, in those days when your dream and vision is nothing but war, it is critical that you maintain your sense of vision. It's important that you maintain your sense of why you are doing this. It's important that you maintain your motivation.

Motivation does not always show up in glamorous clothes. It's not always the adrenaline rush of another adventure. Sometimes motivation begins as a simple choice to get up, and press further ahead. Take one more step. Develop yourself a little bit more.

What gives you meaning in the process is being able to see you mission, the things that you are doing right now, and how they relate to your vision. Yes, you still need to evaluate whether it's taking you closer or further away. But it's important that you keep pressing forward.

## **Your Mission Matters**

Your mission matters immensely. If you've taken the time to explore each of the prior chapters, you should know that your mission closely revolves around your unique DNA, your unique personality and interests. If you fulfill your mission, you will leave a unique mark on the world and on history.

If you refuse to fulfill your mission and you choose to follow someone else's mission, you will rob the world of something that only you can do.

The way that you become truly great is by making an impact on the world that no one else can make. You do that by doing things that no one else can do, and you do things no one else can do by being someone no one else can be.

And that someone is you.

The only true mark on history is made by those who have learned to be fully aligned with who they are and have been able to leverage the opportunities they've been given to make that impact on life.

That's why it's absolutely critical to be true to your personal mission. The world was mean to be a different place because of you.

## **Learning from the People around You**

One of the most difficult pieces of the journey, as you seek to execute your mission is learning how to learn from the people around you. You may be attracted to someone else's vision and be tempted to embrace their mission, and you may be able to integrate into their mission.

However, you may also find yourself compromising your own strengths in an attempt to be like them. You don't have to be like someone else to join in their vision. In fact, you don't have to be like them to join in their mission. But to be truly effective, you must know how to integrate who you are into their plan and their vision.

You cannot do this when you are uncertain of your own personality and gifts. You must learn to be true to it. When you learn from the people around you, you may learn how to have better relationships. You might learn how to communicate better. Your might learn how to lead better.

But at the end of the day, what you are ultimately learning is how to be the best version of you. When you learn from the people around you, what you are learning are the pieces of the puzzle that you need to be the best person you can be.

## **What Really Is Your Mission?**

I can still hear you asking, "Yes, you've told me a little bit about what a mission is, but I still don't know what it is or how to implement it."

Your mission is simply a description of the kinds of actions that you will take to accomplish your vision. Your mission right now might be to train and raise children who will be cultural influencers and leaders. That's a description of the things that you are doing to accomplish your vision.

Your mission is like a strategy, an attack plan, for how you plan to implement your vision. It's the beginning of a personalized action plan for how you plan to live your life and how you plan to make a difference.

Anyone else may share some of your values, or may be able to share your vision, but the specifics of what you plan to accomplish must be custom-tailored to who you are.

## **A Made-to-Fit Plan**

I dread shopping for clothes. Maybe I'm one of those picky people, but I always have to try on a lot of clothes, and many of them I feel uncomfortable in. My wife knows that when we go shopping for clothes, we either need to look for something that's I've bought in the past, or be prepared to spend considerable time looking for something that fits.

But when I find something that fits, I love it. It's comfortable. I don't just feel more comfortable in the clothes I'm wearing--I feel more comfortable in my own skin.

That's what it's like with our lives. Sometimes we are pressured to fit into someone else's mold, and we can go through all of the actions, and yet we feel like something just doesn't fit. We feel uncomfortable with ourselves, and other people can see our own discomfort. Of course, they might not realize that our discomfort is not some kind of weakness on our part, but is simply because we are embracing a life that was never ours to live.

The purpose of a mission is to develop a life plan that is made to fit. It fits into your values, your purpose, and your vision. But just as importantly, it fits into your passion, your interests, your strengths, and your personality.

This is the place many people dream to enter into, and some people find it. Other people say it's a mythical place that only exists in the imagination. But it is a real place, and if you're willing to take the time to invest in yourself, and if you're courageous enough to step outside of the comfort of your current situation, you can find that place as well.

You know that every piece of custom clothing is always more expensive than the stock clothing. You can buy premade clothing, and it may or may not fit you. But the custom clothing will always cost you more money. But it will always be a better quality, and it will always fit you better.

That's exactly the way it is with your life. You go through life, following the patterns that are set for you, and you will not need to expend the same effort, energy, and even money to become the person you were truly created to be. But without that investment in the cost, you will never be truly comfortable in your own.

You must learn to create a custom-fit plan for you. It will have your name on it, and your stamp. No one else can replace you.

## **The Measure of Value**

In a world where everyone is looking to fit in, your mission is what will make you stand out. People don't often measure you based on your values, or your vision--although I do think we should pay much more attention to those than we do\! People will measure you by the things that they see, and your mission will be the first thing that they see.

In a world where we are pressured to fit in, we are also craving to know that we are valued, that what we have to offer the world is truly worth offering. To prove our own value, you digest other people's work and regurgitate it, hoping that we can demonstrate the same value that they've demonstrated.

However, we know that scarcity is often the determiner of value. Gold is much more valuable simply because it's so hard to find. Meanwhile, the dirt that the gold is buried in is so freely available that people pay comparatively little for the dirt.

That's exactly the way it is for you. Your value is in your uniqueness. It's in combining each of these different factors into a common package. That's exactly what will cause you to stand out in a world of look-alikes. It's what will give you distinction in a world of the status quo.

Who you are is deeply valuable. It's not a matter to be questioned. It's simple a statement to be believed, and I've proven it to you by showing you how fully unique you are.

Even more valuable is the custom-fit plan for you. You cannot buy it, because there is no other plan. You must give your life to pursue it, discover it, and live it.

In the end, that's you will make your mark on the world.

Go out, do it, and be the best "you" that you can be\!
