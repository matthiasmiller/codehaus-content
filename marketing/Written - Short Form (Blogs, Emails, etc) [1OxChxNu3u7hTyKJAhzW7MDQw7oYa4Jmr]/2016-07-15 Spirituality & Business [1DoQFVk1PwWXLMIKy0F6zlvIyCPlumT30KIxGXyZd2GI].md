**Constraints, Spirituality, & Measurable Business Results**  
*WARNING: Don’t Read If You’re Easily Offended\!*

I wanted to offer you a “thank you” for being part of the inaugural edition of this newsletter. As a special bonus, I’m sharing an inside look at how I’ve been resolving one of the primary constraints I’ve been facing in my business. It has forced me to dig deeply into the messy tension between spirituality and business, between inner transformation and measurable actions and results.  
First, a fair warning: If you’re offended by spirituality and controversial ideas, save yourself the bother. If you’re not scared of that, I’d like to share a raw look into how spirituality drives my business. You’re one of the first to hear it.

**My Spiritual Awakening**  
I grew up in a very traditional religious community, where spirituality meant working hard, doing good things for each other, and getting along. Spiritual growth meant spending more time studying Scripture, reading more books, and learning more information. Oh, and don’t bother rocking the boat...it’s worked for centuries, so why question it now?  
Although I didn’t realize it at the time, I’ve always had this gnawing sense inside of me that marked me as an entrepreneur. I found it hard to fit in, and I was rarely satisfied by the way things were. I was extremely sensitive to environments around me--so much so that my boss even commented on my moodiness. I couldn’t figure out what was different about me, or about the hunger that was driving me.  
When I was 18 years old, I experienced something that radically shifted my perspective. At a weeklong conference in North Carolina, I watched with amazement as a man purported to share “words from God” for people. What he shared was accurate, and people were obviously touched. However, more surprising to me, during the conference I began to receive similar kinds \`of “intuitive insights” for other people. In those moments when I shared them, it felt like something that had been deeply incongruent finally came together. I felt closer to “whole” than I’d ever felt before.  
I began learning more about this gift that Scripture calls “prophecy”. I started having experiences where I’d know things about people without them telling me, and I’d use it to encourage them. However, it didn’t stop there. I discovered I’d been misinformed about miracles of healing--that they weren’t just nice stories, but actually happen today. After what I’ve seen, you couldn’t talk me out of it.   
One evening, I felt compelled to drive to the emergency room and find someone with a hurt knee. When I got there, I found a man who’d hurt his knee on the job, and his knee got healed on the spot.  
That’s something you can’t just ignore.  
And it got crazier…  
On the way home from work late one night, I was praying in my car and for the first time I found myself praying in a different language. I discovered that I could pray in this language at will, and when I did, I experienced more of God’s Presence and I received insights for living life.  
However, I also learned that not everyone shared the same excitement. I discovered that some people are more comfortable keeping these experiences locked in the pages of the Scripture, rather than having them lived out in the “here and now”. It’s funny how different things look when you see them in real life instead of just studying a textbook.  
I found myself shrinking back.

**The Problem of Money**  
However, spirituality wasn’t the only issue.  
In the religious community I grew up, the world was unofficially divided into two kinds of people: “normal” people and “devout” people. The normal people were those who had jobs or owned businesses--anybody who made money. The devout people were those who worked in a church or non-profit--rarely making much money at all. If normal people wanted to be more devout, they did more work for free or gave away the money that they’d worked hard to earn. Somehow, God was supposed to bless the people who worked for next to nothing.  
It was great in theory, but it didn’t work out well for me in practice, so I started questioning most of my assumptions. Over time, I stopped trying to be so “devout”.  
Over time, I discovered I had a *lot* of wrong beliefs. I realized making money was a lot better than not making any at all, Scripture never says money is evil, and Jesus never told us to be poor. I found out people are pretty scared of believing in a God who will bless them, as if somehow they’ll become selfish and walk away from their benefactor. (Why would anyone in their right mind do *that*?) On the contrary, some of Scripture’s greatest heros took no issue to being rich.  
Most importantly, I came to the conclusion that money is actually *evidence* that we’ve helped someone else and I never need to justify making money by giving it away.  
*I told you this would be controversial\!*  
Don’t get me wrong. I don’t look down on people who are poor or aren’t particularly motivated to make money. Furthermore I believe 100% in generosity. However, if you’re giving away money to justify making it, you’re probably missing the point. You’ve *already* justified yourself by helping someone else, and if you keep giving it away, you might be robbing yourself of your greatest opportunity to change the world.  
Let’s face it: you can make a lot more impact on the world with money than without.

**Where God and Money Meet**  
As I mentioned, people got uncomfortable with these new ideas, and I shrank back from my spirituality.  
This past month I’ve been working on identifying the biggest constraint in my business. You might expect it to be capital, time, sales, teams...you name it. However, that’s not what came up.  
My biggest constraint was the fact that I was living my life apart from this intuitive gift, what Scripture calls “prophecy”. Sure, I was able to benefit from it privately, but I still felt constrained because I’d never really opened up about it.  
This realization kept returning to me again and again from different directions. I should have known what to do about it, but I had no clue until this morning.  
Over the past few years, as I’ve broke down the barriers between “spirituality” and “making money”, I’ve been seeing crazy things happen in my business. I’ve gotten instantaneous insights into technical challenges. I’ve had dreams at night that have helped set the direction for my business. I’ve had a bizarre 2-month stretch of almost-perfect scheduling. I’ve gotten “mind hacks” to break broken belief systems that have kept me stuck. I’ve gotten ideas on who to partner with on business ventures.  
I’ve made spirituality part of my life, and it’s one of the most crucial things I can do for my business.  
Every single morning, I make myself a cup of pour-over coffee and meet with the Boss. Sometimes I just enjoy the physical manifestation of His Presence. Other times I’ll spend time free-journaling. Sometimes I’ll pray in another language. No matter what I do, I spend that time with Him. That’s where I get insights about things that are broken in my thinking. That’s where I get direction on how to spend my day. That’s how I avoid burnout. That’s how I stay centered.  
He’s never failed me...until yesterday.  
I simply couldn’t discern an agenda. I had a day full of meetings, so it bothered me a little, but it didn’t hit me until I got home from work and realized I didn’t know what to do the next day. This morning, I faced the same block. The only thing that I heard was that I needed to write this paper. Besides that, nothing.  
I’m telling you...I’m dogged with this thing. I actually opened up my laptop to start working, then I shut it again because I knew I wasn’t going to get anything done.  
I kept hanging out in the Head Office...until I got this thought that I knew was from the Boss: “List all of your current projects on the whiteboard.” I had a mile-long list of things I needed to complete. I immediately got the shot of adrenaline to get my day started. At the same time, I got two insights that unlocked challenges I’d been facing for a while:

1. I suddenly realized that as a quick-start personality type, I’d been subconsciously looking for *new* things to do, not things to finish. Just changing my lens changed the things I saw.  
2. I also instantly realized that I’d been approaching sales as a quick-start personality type, which is why I’ve had trouble closing more sales. Just recognizing it opened me up to moving forward in a place I’d felt stuck.

Those instant insights unlocked a productive day of making things happen and moving things forward. While I can’t predict what will happen in these morning sessions, this certainly isn’t unusual for me.  
Not everyone’s OK with this, either...some find it offensive to believe in a God, others find it offensive that God cares about wealth, or that I partner with Him to make money, or that I’m not doing more good in the world, or that God’s speaking some 2000 years after Scripture was written.  
Meanwhile, others assume I’m talking about some kind of wishy-washy “law of attraction”, as if somehow I get to ignore all of the hard work and grind of building a business, with money magically appearing at every turn. Spirituality is no excuse to be lazy or stupid.  
It’s about living all of life in connection with God...*especially* in your business.  
Remember what I mentioned about the biggest constraint I’ve been facing? I’m not just sharing this story as a kind of feel-good kumbaya for me. I’m tenacious about getting hard, tangible results. Sharing a raw, unfiltered look into my life is a deliberate step to moving forward and creating momentum in my business. I guarantee you it will ripple into the rest of my life.  
You’ll never win by trying to be somebody else, and you’ll never move further than your biggest constraint. It takes courage to be yourself, to step out and be the person you were meant to be.  
So go for it\! Live with you no regrets\!
