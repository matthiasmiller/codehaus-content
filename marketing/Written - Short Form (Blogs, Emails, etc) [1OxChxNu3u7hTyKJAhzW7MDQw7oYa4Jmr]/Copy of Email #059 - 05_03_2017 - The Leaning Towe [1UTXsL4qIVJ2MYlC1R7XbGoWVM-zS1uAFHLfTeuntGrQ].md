Trust is the foundation of any relationship. Every other aspect of a business, organization, or movement leans on trust and collapses without it. 

Remove trust from a business and customers won’t buy. Remove it from a marriage, and the partners starve of intimacy. 

Movements implode to meaningless babble, churches split to smithereens, and neighborhoods devolve into chaos when trust is destroyed. The only way to rebuild a business, marriage, or any relationship is to rebuild trust. 

Like the leaning Tower of Pisa, relationships tilt and eventually fall unless they’re founded on trust.

Building a firm foundation of trust requires many materials, including time, dependability, and freedom. But one ingredient stands out above the rest like a frame holding everything together: *transparency*.

If you dismiss transparency in a relationship, trust is weakened and liable to bring everything down on top of you. It’s one thing to *feel* like someone is trustworthy. It’s a whole other thing to *know* someone is trustworthy because they’re open and transparent. *You can see them as they really are.*

Not everyone deserves to hear everything about your life. Transparency comes in layers. But living like you have nothing to hide, will do more to build trust in your relationships than anything you could ever try.

You know what’s even better? *Actually living with nothing to hide.*

Right now, you can probably think of **one thing** that you need to share with your spouse, business partner, team member or friend. Do it.

Now.

Only when you are able to live transparently can you…

Be the best you\!
