So perry Marshall talks about the idea that there is $10 per hour work, $100 per  
hour, $1000 per hour etc. Just had this inspiration and how this relates to  
org. charts.

The basic concept in scaling your business goes something like this:

One. Worker. Do everything yourself

Two. Manager. Do the management of everybody who is doing the work.

Three. Leadership. You lead everyone who is managing everyone else.

Four. Executive/investor. You only involve yourself in the very high level,  
strategic decisions in your business.

Every time that you move to the next level, the more you increase your  
leverage, the more you increase your scalability, the more you increase  
your value to the business.

Your ability to delegate will determine at what level you get stuck.
