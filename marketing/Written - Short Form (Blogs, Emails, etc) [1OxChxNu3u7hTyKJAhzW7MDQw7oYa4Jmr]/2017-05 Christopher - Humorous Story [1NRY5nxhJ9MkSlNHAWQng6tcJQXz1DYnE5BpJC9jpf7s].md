**Target: 150**

Einstein was once traveling from Princeton on a train when the conductor came down the aisle, punching the tickets of every passenger. When he came to Einstein, Einstein reached in his vest pocket. He couldn’t find his ticket, so he reached in his trouser pockets. It wasn’t there, so he looked in his briefcase but couldn’t find it. Then he looked in the seat beside him. He still couldn’t find it.

The conductor said, ‘Dr. Einstein, I know who you are. We all know who you are. I’m sure you bought a ticket. Don’t worry about it.’

Einstein nodded appreciatively. The conductor continued down the aisle punching tickets. As he was ready to move to the next car, he turned around and saw the great physicist down on his hands and knees looking under his seat for his ticket.

The conductor rushed back and said, ‘Dr. Einstein, Dr. Einstein, don’t worry, I know who you are. No problem. You don’t need a ticket. I’m sure you bought one.’

Einstein looked at him and said, ‘Young man, I too, know who I am. What I don’t know is where I’m going.’

**Comic Relief**

A speech therapist was working with a preschooler on  body-part identification and the  k sound. To do this, he had the child use Play-Doh to make a sculpture  of him.

“Is that my neck?” he asked the child, trying to get him to repeat the word.

“No, that’s your chin,” the preschooler stated.

He added more Play-Doh. 

“Is *that* my neck?” the speech therapist asked.

“No, that’s your other chin.”
