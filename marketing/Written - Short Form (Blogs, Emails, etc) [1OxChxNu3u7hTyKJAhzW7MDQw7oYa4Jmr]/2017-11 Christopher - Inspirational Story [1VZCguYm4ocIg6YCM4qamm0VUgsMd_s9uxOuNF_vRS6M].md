In a world where it often seems everyone is looking out for their own best interests, it's refreshing to see a selfless act. 

This past July, in the heat of the afternoon, a young pastor took his children out for ice cream. As he drove out of the parking lot, he noticed an elderly man crouching down beside his car. A closer look revealed the elderly man carefully spoon-feeding ice cream to an elderly lady.

Today.com reports that the pastor, Brent Kelley, took a picture and posted it to Facebook with a caption explaining what was happening. His post was liked and shared by hundreds of thousands of people.

Kelley told Today.com, “It was the perfect representation of what love is. It was unselfish. It was 98 degrees and he’s sitting next to the pavement, which is also warm, and he’s feeding his wife ice cream because she’s disabled.”

Apparently America agrees with him, as his Facebook post was flooded with comments about how people want to be just like this when they are older.

I doubt this was the first time this elderly man showed sacrificial, selfless love to his wife. This event, caught and lauded by hundreds of thousands, was likely the culmination of a lifetime of giving and serving.

This story is a reminder that character is built moment by moment when nobody’s watching. Let’s invest each moment to shape the elderly man or lady we’ll one day become\!

A photo of an elderly man feeding his wife ice cream in the sweltering heat is tugging at the heartstrings of hundreds of thousands of people after an onlooker shared the tender moment on Facebook.
