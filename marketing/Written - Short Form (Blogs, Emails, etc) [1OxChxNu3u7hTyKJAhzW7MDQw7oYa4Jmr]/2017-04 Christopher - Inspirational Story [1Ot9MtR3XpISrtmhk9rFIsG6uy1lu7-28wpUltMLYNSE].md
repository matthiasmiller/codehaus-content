“Social media only promotes negativity\!” This is common knowledge, right?

The dominance of negativity on the internet gets a lot of attention. Understandably so\! From cyber-bullying to heated debates about politics and religion, the internet can be a depressing place.

Yet, what if the internet was dominated by stories like this... 

According to Metro.co.uk, an unidentified user posted a picture on Instagram of a man viewing a display at the jewelry shop where he cleaned. Apparently in a mood for cruelty, the user captioned the photo with *‘This man only deserves to look at rubbish.’*

Why would anyone be so cruel? Nobody knows. But the rest of the internet did not hold the same perspective.

Despite the original hate-filled intent, the response to the picture was an outpouring of love. With the help of well-wishers on Twitter, the man was identified as Nazer al-Islam Abdul Karim and has received numerous gifts. Not just greeting cards but gifts such as iPhones, Samsung Galaxy’s, rice, and jewelry to name a few.

It was all made possible because of the internet and social media. What started out as bullying, others turned into an opportunity to express love.

Imagine the internet if, every time we witnessed bullying and negativity, we’d respond with kindness and generosity. *What if* we randomly gave out iPhones and gift cards and bags of rice? How many lives could we change--even save--if we took time to befriend the lonely and love the ones most people ignore?

This month, let’s be on the look-out to turn situations from negative to positive. Better yet, let’s get a jump-start and encourage the people all around us before negativity has a chance to settle in.
