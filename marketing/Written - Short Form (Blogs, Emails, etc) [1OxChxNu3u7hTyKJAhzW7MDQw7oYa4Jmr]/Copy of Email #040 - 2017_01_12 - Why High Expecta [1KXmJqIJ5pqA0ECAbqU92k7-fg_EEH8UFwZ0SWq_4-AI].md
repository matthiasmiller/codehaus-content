* **Why High Expectations Are Hurting Your Team**

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

People like us have an uncanny confidence that we can achieve anything. However, sometimes our expectations are just plain too high.

You probably already know this if you’ve ever set out on your own to develop a new talent but eventually gave up after the miserable first try.

My friend Daniel tried multiple times as an adolescent to teach himself guitar, but he always quit after the first several hours, far short of his lofty goal.

This is how many of us go into entrepreneurship: overestimating how quickly we can succeed--and underestimating how much help we’ll actually need.

Why is this?

The reason is surprisingly simple: *many of us have never learned how to ask for or receive help.* 

Whether it was instructions, games, or just life, we felt safer figuring things out on our own. As a result, we developed poor habits of doing everything ourselves.

**Those habits kill our momentum.** 

They kill our momentum by undermining healthy leadership and delegation. 

We skip over important details and dump projects into our poor employees’ laps expecting they, too, can figure it out on their own. We expect them to get it right the first time. 

Obviously, this is unreasonable. It’s frustrating to both the leader and the team.

To effectively delegate, leaders must slow down and give their team the support they need. This can feel like a harrowing transition and be frustrating at first as the new employee learns the ropes of his new role. But it in the long run, it actually increases speed and efficiency.

When you break from your sense of unhealthy independence, you are free to support your team as they take on new responsibilities. You’ll be thrilled to see, as they develop, that you regain speed with even greater momentum.

When people are functioning in their sweet spots and your team has momentum, you are all able…

To be the best you\!
