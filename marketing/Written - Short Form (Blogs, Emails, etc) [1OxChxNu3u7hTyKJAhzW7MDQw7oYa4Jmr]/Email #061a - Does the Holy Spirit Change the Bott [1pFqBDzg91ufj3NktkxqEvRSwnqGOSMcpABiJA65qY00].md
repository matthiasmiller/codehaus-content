* **Not for the easily offended… Does the Holy Spirit Change the Bottom Line?**

Hey {{ subscriber.first\_name }},

*Every once in a while, I plan to share some of my perspectives on spirituality and entrepreneurship. If you’d prefer not to get these types of emails, just **click here** and we’ll make sure we don’t send them again.*

Within Christian circles, no one questions whether the Holy Spirit should play an active role in an entrepreneur’s life. That’s a given for the Christian. Yet, what are the *practical*, hands-on steps to allowing Him to change the bottom line?

Let me tell you a story, because for years this was my question, too.

Over ten years ago, I began a quest to find the answer to this question. I sat under the blazing summer sun with my Bible on my lap, pondering the verse that instructed me to “Seek first the kingdom, and all these things will be added unto you.”

It’s a pretty simple instruction, yet the only thing I knew was spending time in prayer, reading Scripture, and being active in ministry. (And probably selling all my possessions and giving to the poor...which turned out to be a pretty bad business plan.)

It seemed God was happy being in an unmeasured, feel-good church environment. However, when it came to the rigors of the workplace and business, He faded away under the light of the microscope. Spirituality felt ethereal...something I could hardly wrap my hands around.

And then something changed.

It wasn’t a lightning moment. It was a gradual dawning of a lightbulb--like fluorescent lights in a gym that take about ten minutes till they’re at peak brightness. It was a slow, protracted “aha” moment stretching out over months and years. I began learning simple keys to seeking the kingdom in my business. 

Keys such as:

* Learning how to live in a spiritual rest and constant communion with the Holy Spirit, even in the midst of crazy long days.  
* Learning how to dream with the Lord to get creative ideas for my business and listen for practical solutions to the problems I faced.  
* Learning how to trust God to bring the right people or training into my path at the right time

And these keys actually unlocked some major barriers in my life.

I found the right assistant through a “random” contact via an old friend--a truly “divine appointment.” I experienced freedom from shame, which allowed me to delegate more responsibility to my assistant and literally saved me thousands of dollars. And I finally learned how to break off business relationships that were costing me a tremendous amount of time and money.

One time, while on a jog, worshiping the Lord, not thinking about work at all, God gave me the solution to a challenging software problem--the evening before a major deadline on the project. A couple of months ago, the Holy Spirit told me to switch some of our marketing from a vendor to in-house because we would get higher quality output at a lower cost (which we did). I could go on and on.

These are real results with a real impact on the bottom line.

So how did I do it? What was the “aha” that I mentioned?

I’m not some kind of spiritual celebrity.

I’m just an entrepreneur who loves Jesus…like many of you. I’m walking in step with my Father and listening for His guiding voice. It’s that simple: that was the “aha.”

I’m telling you all of this because if there’s hope for me, THERE IS HOPE FOR YOU\!

You were born an entrepreneur, born to change the world, and born to see the Kingdom of God invade your business.

LET’S GO FOR IT\!

**IDEA MEMO:**  
As an individual, there’s certain things you can be exceptional at...being effective is more about playing to your innate strengths. 

Being congruent with who you are at every level has a tremendous impact.

**Birkman:**

1. Personality and the emotional side of it. What’s you’re interest and what’s your why? What motivates you?  
   1. Did coaching with Tony Robbins coach, one question he kept coming back to was “What’s your why?”  
   2. Kept saying “that’s a what, not a why” still didn’t know “*why*”  
   3. Even the birkman’s answer is a what

Understanding motivation plays a critical role. Unless you know how you’re motivated, there’s no way to stay motivated.  
       
     2\. Emotional Needs/Stress behaviors. What do I need from other people? How do I respond when I’m under stress? Really becomes about managing your emotional state well so you can be 

**Kolbe:**  
Once you are motivated, how do you take action? Moving into a flow state. Out of sync will affect emotion. Conation is how you will, not emotional/personality assessment.

**Marketing DNA Test:**  
Somewhat similar as Birkman. One thing it does is give a clear understanding of how you are most likely to promote your business. How you’ll be most effective. Gives in depth on sales and marketing.

**Prophetic Coaching:**  
Head trash concepts. Creative ideas, understanding God’s design. Why did God put you on the planet? Understanding road block you might not be aware of. Other parts are much more systematic and scientific… this is just as effective, but with a much more level of unpredictability and element of surprise.

Could be series.

With series… keep in mind autoresponder sequences.

Could make this series effective, tie in Matthias’ personal story with it all. 

Perry Marshall’s burning bus series. He leads you through it with cliffhangers at the end of every email.

Focus on Matt’s story as it relates to this ^^^
