## **Is Imagination Realistic?**

I can hear some people asking me, "Is it even realistic to use your imagination like this?" Underlying the question is the assumption that somehow, using your imagination is less intellectually sound than using logic alone.

I'll answer this question with a simple question, "Will you get the best perspective by relying a single dimension or on multiple dimensions?" Unless you are willing to actively engage your imagination and become a visual thinker, you will limit yourself from your full potential.

You must learn to think not only logically but visually. Your ability to connect ideas with each other depends on this ability. Your ability to connect the things you're doing to a bigger "why" depends on your ability to be a visual thinker. Your first skill that you developed was not logic, but sight, and does it not make sense to leverage this inborn trait to your advantage?

Neither dimension must exist independently of the other. They must both be aligned to make their full benefit to each other. It is intellectually unsound to not engage your imagination in your life, because you will miss out on insights that you will otherwise have gained. You will miss the nuances that are waiting for you, and you will be blinded to the deeper significance that underlies what you do.

Until you learn to paint pictures for yourself, tell yourself the correct stories, and actively use your imagination, you will always be living below your full potential. These are tools for you to use to throw gas on the fire. Use them to make the fire burn brighter\!

## **Creating Momentum**

Every action creates momentum, but it's up to you to harness it or let it pass. You must choose to harness the bits of momentum around you and allow them to turn into something greater. A domino will only fall once, and its ability to trigger a chain reaction is based on its ability to fall forward onto another domino.

Every action that you take, if it is not followed through properly, will simply result in a tireless cycle of setting up dominos and watching them fall. However, if you formulate your actions correctly, you can capture each movement and use its momentum to propel you forward.

This momentum, if used properly, will continue propelling you forward. If harnessed properly, it will continue carrying you forward into the future. But it can also stop just as quickly as it started.

Your goal is to create a lifestyle of momentum, allowing each action to propel you forward. You make a practice of keeping your commitments to yourself, dropping the activities that hold you back. You will find yourself tackling bigger and bigger projects because of the momentum you've built over time.

Your goal is to create inertia, the tendency of your life to stay in motion. Inertia, as you recall, is the tendency for an object to maintain is movement or lack of movement. A large organization has large inertia. If it's moving, it's hard to stop it. But if it's not moving, it can be hard to start.

## **Momentum Starts Small**

You cannot overcome the inertia of a large organization in a single act. You must be willing and able to create a small pocket of momentum and allow it to grow.

This means making small changes in your life and creating momentum. Maybe it means taking a 15 minute jog every day. Rather than reform your entire day, start small, but allow that small start to spread. Start listening to an informative podcast during that time.

Grow your jog to 20 minutes a day, and then start eating a healthy breakfast every morning. Make every change with the simple intention to make it easily sustainable. If you bite off more than you can chew, you'll simply try for a few days, and then fall back to where you had been. Set yourself up for success. Start small, and win, and when you win, keep on winning.

## **Creating a Winning World**

Create a winning world around you.

We as humans are motivated to win. Some people will add more items to their "to do" list after they've been completed, just so they can cross them off\! We love winning\!

Turn your life into a series of wins. This simply starts with a new perspective on the things that you face. Make an intentional effort to turn daily tasks into a win.

Change your mind set to reward yourself for straightening up your desk, for getting down to a zero inbox, for completing your daily jog, for completing projects at work. No matter what you're doing, developing an awareness of the things that you are accomplishing will motivate you to keep pressing forward.

It's easy to look at these tasks as "something else to do". They become something that gets in your way, something that weighs you down. They become meaningless repetition. This is all in the story you tell yourself.

If this is how you see it, it's how you will live. You will not engage yourself to complete them, and you will not follow through. However, if you see these tasks as significant, and if you see your follow-through as significant--if you can see these tasks as a win--they will motivate you to seek out more wins.

Create daily wins. Celebrate the things that you accomplish.

If your task is difficult, celebrate smaller wins. Small tasks completed.

Take a moment to revel in the fact that you've taken another step forward, no matter how small, and you'll find yourself motivated to keep taking another step forward.

## **Insight Follows Action**

The final perspective shift to continue pouring gas on the fire is this: insight follows action.

Many people assume that in order to become an expert, they have to take training and learn certain material. While this is certainly helpful, this is actually counterproductive and if you're not careful, you will put your foot on the brake instead of the gas pedal.

Don't get me wrong: you do need to learn from people who have gone before you. But the world is not lacking from people who have information. The world is lacking who have insight, and that only follows action.

If you're looking to hire a consultant, I hope that you take the time to seriously consider whether they have experience. If they don't, you might want to look elsewhere. Experience is the true test.

Many people refuse to take action because they feel like they are lacking insight in order to move forward. They feel like they need knowledge in order to gain experience. However, this is a limiting mindset, and it's completely backwards. Unless you are in the medical profession, you need to actively pursue experience, and then start looking for insight.

You can't learn to improve a business that doesn't exist. You can't learn any songs if you don't know any guitar chords. Play guitar, no matter how poorly, and then learn from your experience. Take classes, but don't take more than one before you start playing.

Action is worth little if it's not evaluated or examined. The difference between gaining experience and putting in your time is what you do with your experience. Some people go through life, do many things, but they never garner any significant insight into what they're doing. This is a poor investment of your time and energy.

You must learn to take action, but you must develop an attitude of learning from you action. You must question the things that you've done:

* What have I learned?

* What are the things that worked?

* Why did it work?

* What are the things that didn't work?

* Why didn't they work?

* What are the principles at play here?

* What are the insights that I'm missing?

We hold back because we feel we have an incomplete picture, scared of painting ourselves into a corner. This is not an invitation to set yourself up for failure. It's an invitation to being able to learn.

Count the risk of acting now, but also count the risk of doing nothing. If you act now, you might discover the missing pieces you needed, and you will have a chance to try again. Do nothing, and you'll still be wondering what the pieces are that you really need.

## **Finding Insight**

It's easy to look at a situation and believe that you've identified the cause. However, many people assign many interest reasons for why certain projects succeed or fail.

The wrong people worked on the project. They project was underfunded. The market didn't understand the product. People just weren't interested.

Don't just settle for off-the-cuff answers. Dig. Probe.

Sometimes taking action is the only way to discover the questions that you need to have answered. But don't just settle for the most obvious question. Be willing to dig in deeper, to the question beyond the question. Look for the causes that other people have overlooked. Embrace raw, simple truth, but be willing to explore unconventional ideas.

Whatever you do, don't settle for insight that leaves a victim. Don't settle for things that consistently put the cause of failure outside of your hands. If the market wasn't interested, why haven't you found what they want? Or was it because you were unable to communicate your value?

If no one wanted to join you in the venture, it's not their fault. It's yours. You didn't find the right people, or you didn't find the right venture. Don't blame them for it. Take responsibility.

Learn the things that you need to change. Determine how you can better influence others. Determine how you can better identify your own blind spots and your own weaknesses.

Unless you're doing brain surgery, don't stop yourself simply because you don't know "enough". Give yourself the cold, hard truth about how much is really "enough".

## **Insight Fuels Action**

When you gain insight, it's up to you to turn it back into action. If your first project fails, it's up to you to take the things you've learned and do it better.

If the market votes against your product, don't ignore the signals. Learn from them, but allow those insights to propel you forward. Allow your insights to fuel your actions.

Become a life-long learner, and be anxious to apply the things you're learning. Allow your insight to fuel your momentum forward.

## **Keep the Fire Burning Bright**

You must make an intentional choice to live every single day with purpose and passion. You must learn to intentionally monitor how much fuel is in your tank, and when it's consistently depleting, you must be intentionally look for sustainable ways to energize yourself.

Develop an awareness of the areas of life where you are losing momentum, and look for simple way to generate momentum. If you are looking to build influence, start by building a relationship. If you are unwilling to pour energy into a project, make a deliberate decision to ax it so that it won't continue weighing you down.

You get to choose the level of energy with which you live your life. Live in bold, creative colors. Live for something bigger, something deeper. Live for something that matters, something that will last.

Live for something that will outlive you, that will continue contributing to the world long after you're gone.

Choose to wake up, every single day, to pour gas on the fire of your dreams. Let them burn brightly, and let them shine a light to inspire others.
