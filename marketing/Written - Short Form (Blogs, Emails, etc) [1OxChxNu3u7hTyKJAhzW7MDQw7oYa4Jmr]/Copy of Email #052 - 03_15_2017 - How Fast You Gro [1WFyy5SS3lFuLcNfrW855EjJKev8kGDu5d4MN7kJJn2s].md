Five months ago, I made a decision in our marketing that caused quite a few hiccups and, for a while, ended up slowing us down.  
   
Over the past four weeks, we’ve talked about being Lifelong Learners. 

In particular, we’ve noted two traits that help us overcome blinds spots and avoid becoming the dreaded control freaks. That is, of course, to *be transparent* and *invite feedback*. Either is essential to serious personal growth.

However, there’s a catch: being transparent and inviting feedback will only get us understanding and information. They won’t actually make a lasting effect over the long haul. They’re completely useless unless we...

***Embrace Change.***

You might say embracing change goes without saying. Unfortunately, all too often we *resist change* rather than embracing it.

We’ve tried to do our best at embracing change within our company. For example, in the beginning days of our print publication, *The Multiplier*, we outsourced to a company that provided stock content. However, we heard from our readers that they connected the most with personal content. So we brought *The Multiplier* in-house.

Ever since then, we’ve been publishing it as a team. All the content is written by either me or my assistant Chris, who then delegates the proofreading and design to the rest of the team.

Doing this definitely put more work and responsibility on all of our shoulders. Sometimes we barely make the deadline--and sometimes we’ve even missed it\!

Embracing *that* change has definitely been uncomfortable\! Yet, we’re learning and growing together as a team, we’re representing our business much more clearly, and, most importantly, our readers are enjoying much better content as a result\!

There’s no science to “embracing change.” As much as I’d like to, I can’t write out a two or three step formula for you too follow.

This is because it’s not a formula you can execute on. It’s a mindset that you have to embrace.

You must *decide* that you will embrace growth and improvement, even if it’s uncomfortable. After all, that’s what made us entrepreneurs in the beginning.

At the end of the day, resisting change is to plant our feet in the shallow valley of “today.” There’s no movement or momentum, no progress or success without *change*.

So whether it means changing our business strategy, changing our product, changing our attitudes--no matter what it is, we embrace healthy change. And we do it readily.

Only when you are transparent, inviting feedback, and ready to embrace change are we able to…

Be the best you\!

Embracing healthy change (as a result of healthy feedback and discovery)

1. Lifelong Learners embrace healthy change: they make adjustments according to what they discover through intentional critique
