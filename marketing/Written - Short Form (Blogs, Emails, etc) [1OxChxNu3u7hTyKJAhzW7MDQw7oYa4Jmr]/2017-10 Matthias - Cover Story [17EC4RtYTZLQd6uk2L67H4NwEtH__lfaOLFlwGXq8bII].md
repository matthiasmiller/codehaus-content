# **A Hands-On Guide to Systems**

When you're knee-deep in a startup business, your days are full of solving new issues, figuring things out, and trying to make sense of which side is up. The "fly by the seat of your pants" can prove to be an excellent approach when you're trying to prove a revenue model.

This approach, however, can also be your demise when you're copying a model that works (such as with a franchise) or once you've been able to prove a revenue model.

In the last edition of *The Multiplier*, we discussed the fact that your entire business is built around systems. It's simply a matter of how thoroughly you've defined them and how well you (or your team) are able to execute on those systems.

This month, I promised to share some practical tips for creating systems that don't suck the life out of yourself or your team.

## **Systems are Made for People, Not People for Systems**

Before we dive in too deeply, it's crucial to reiterate this point: "systems are made for people, not people for systems." Every system that you implement must serve you and your team. It must be as human-friendly as possible. If not, it's a broken system.

Healthy systems will prevent surprises, help you avoid mistakes, ensure quality, and increase happiness for your customers, your vendors, your teams, and yes, even for yourself.

Hey, there's even a chance your dog will love you for it, too.

Sound like a winner?

What makes systems truly work?

## **Systems Should Fit Into Your Workflow**

If your system requires you to go out of your way, it will end up being a greater burden than a help. The best systems are ones that integrate neatly into your workflow. Here are some examples.

Our team relies heavily on automated emails. These emails include instructions to certain tasks that need to be completed on a regular basis. For example, every month I get an automated email to log into one of our hosting accounts to verify one of our contingency plans. The subject line reads, "I just need 5 minutes of your time..." The subject line reminds me that it's a quick and easy check.

Our team also uses a cloud-based task management solution. We receive automated email notifications when another team member modifies one of our tasks. This way, we always find out about updates and changes, even if we're knee-deep in the project.

You might take this process even further, deeply integrating your processes into an online management tool to oversee the onboarding process, managing time off, coordinating complex projects.

Your calendar, while you might not think of it like this, is a system. It's a system for managing your time and ensuring that you follow through with the things you say "yes" to. The effectiveness of your system depends on how well it integrates into your workflow, which is exactly why I get a copy of tomorrow's schedule before I leave work. This ensures that it's deeply integrated into my workflow.

You might choose to extend your calendar even further by setting up reminders or creating recurring events on a specific day of the week or a specific week of the year.

Your system might be completely offline. You might include a few instructions on a special Refund Request form, ensuring that your team provides a great customer experience while providing critical front-line feedback to your management team. Or you might choose to create a daily opening or closing checklist, which not only clarifies exactly what needs to be done but also provides accountability to ensure it gets done.

Your system might be a weekly 10-minute meeting to review the numbers that you, your accountant, and your manager plugged into a cash flow spreadsheet.

Years ago, my brother had trouble leaving food in the refrigerator at his office. He finally started putting his keys in the fridge to help him remember to take his food home. At the end of the day, when he reached in his pocket for his keys, he'd remember that he had put them in his fridge, and he'd grab his food before he walked out the door. This is a very simple example of a system that fit perfectly into his workflow (grabbing his keys to go home), while ensuring the results he looked for (taking food home before it spoiled).

## **Systems Should Be Clearly Defined**

For systems to be effective, they must be clearly defined. They must clearly define what should happen, when it should happen, or who's responsible for making sure it will happen.

Every business relies on systems on some level. However, many of those systems are poorly defined, and sometimes they're not even defined at all.

We've adopted the following format internally:

1. Clear, concise title  
2. Summary of the objective  
3. Step-by-step process

You may choose a different format. However, it's crucial that whatever you use fits into your workflow. You might prefer to use checklists, forms, or logbooks rather than a set of instructions or guidelines. You might have a separate system to print off copies at the beginning of each week, or you might print different checklists for different days of the week. The printing might be done manually, or it might be completely automated.

No matter what approach you choose, the crucial factor is that it must fit into your workflow and be something you use on a consistent basis.

Let's break down the specific pieces of the system.

The clear, concise title makes it easy to find exactly what you're looking for. No poking or digging, trying to find the right thing. We categorize our systems by using common titles and prefixes to group them together, but you could do the same thing by thinking through a specific folder structure.

Each system includes a short 1- or 2-sentence summary of the objective. This is followed by simple step-by-step instructions. The instructions should be clear enough that most people can quickly step up to the task and complete it. However, it should not be tediously specific.

If you're running a brick-and-mortar business, you might have a system titled "Closing Shop". Its objective might read: "We want to make sure that all the doors are locked and everything is in its place when we leave."

The specific steps are:

1. Ten minutes before closing, check the front area for any trash.  
2. Clear any unnecessary clutter from the front desk.  
3. Wait until closing time.  
4. Turn off the "open" sign.  
5. Lock the front door.  
6. Wait for the last customer to leave.  
7. Stow the cash in the safe.  
8. Ensure that all offices are locked.  
9. Turn off all the lights.  
10. Initial the "Closing Shop" calendar  
11. Clock out, arm the security system, and have a great night\!

For convenience, you might want to place these instructions on a simple postcard that your staff can stow by the security system.

## **Systems Should Be Centralized**

If you want your systems to be used, they must be centralized. This can be a simple as printing off copies whenever you change them, or it can be as sophisticated as a cloud-based solution that your entire team can access. Of course, you can always start with something as simple as a shared folder on a G Drive.

No matter what you choose, do yourself a favor and have an I.T. professional set up automated backups. If you haven't done so already, you owe it to yourself and your business.

## **You Need a System for Changing Systems**

The final, crucial piece of a healthy system is this: a system for changing systems.

You want your team to adhere to the systems as strictly as possible. However, that can only happen when they have complete freedom to propose changes to these systems. Those proposal must be heard and integrated unless there are strong reasons not to. In fact, you may find that you want to start with a "yes"—allowing anyone to make changes, while giving yourself permission to revisit changes if they don't seem beneficial.

## **Systems are Made for People, Not People for Systems**

In closing, I'd like to return to this simple rule: "Systems are made for people, not people for systems." When you make systems easy to follow, easy to use, and easy to change, they make working in a business a joy.

If you love flying by the seat of your pants, these systems may make your life a little, uh, boring. And if you're scared by boredom, take heart. Your successful, boring business can be exactly the thing that will launch you headfirst into your next rollercoaster startup.
