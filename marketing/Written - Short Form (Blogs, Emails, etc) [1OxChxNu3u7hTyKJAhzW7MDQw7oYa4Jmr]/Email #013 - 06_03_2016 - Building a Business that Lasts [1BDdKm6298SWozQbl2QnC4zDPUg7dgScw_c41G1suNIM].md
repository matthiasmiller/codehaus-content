I have a question for you:

How big is your business? Is it a living, growing organism capable of surviving without you? Or, if you were taken out of the picture, would it fall flat and die?

Most people go into business asking, “What can I do to make money?” 

Of course, this always makes them the king of the game and when they are taken out, the game is over.

A tradesman, for example, who sets out to sell his own service, naturally builds a business around his skillset. This means the business only makes money when he shows up. 

Unfortunately, leaders who run their businesses like this tend to micromanage their team because, in their minds, they are the experts.

If you’re interested in creating an organization that outlasts and outgrows yourself, ask the question, “What can anyone else do to make money? And how can we utilize it to make a business much bigger than any one of us?”

It is difficult to get out of the “do it all yourself” mode because we fear that if we stop, everything will come to a grinding halt.” 

The fact is, most of us overestimate our level of skill while underestimating others’ ability to do what we do.

By allowing those under you to take the initiative and think creatively, you cultivate an environment of contribution within your business, producing something much bigger and more capable of surviving the “elements” of economics than if you did it all yourself.

As you allow your employees to grow and create, your business thrives and you can focus your personal time and energy on the things important to you. 

And thus, you will be the best you.

**Leadership**

If you start by doing it all, you will have to transition to another role as a leader. This is a fundamentally different role.

When most people go into business, their first thought is the question, “What can I do to make money?” This always puts them in the center of the chessboard. If you’re interested in creating an organization that outlasts and outgrows you, you have to ask the question, “What can anyone else do to make money?”

Common example is tradesmen, skilled workers, etc who want to go on their own to sell their services. They naturally build a business around what THEY are capable of doing. This means that they build a business that only makes money when they show up, and it means that they are much more likely to micromanage their team because (in their minds) they are the experts.

One of the reasons it’s so difficult to get out of this mode (where you do it all yourself) is because this brings with it a mindset/fear that if I stop doing what I’m doing, everything will come to a grinding halt. Also, most of us overestimate our level of skill, and underestimate other people’s ability to do what we can do.
