* They Don’t Give Medals for This

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

Over the past several weeks, we’ve been talking about how much *your* work is making a difference. Last week, I told you the story of George Bailey and how his simple life altered the fate of many.

This week, I have a question for you. 

It seems simple, but it brings some pretty big perspective.

How often do you think about farmers? 

Do you think about vegetable farmers as you snap off the end of a nourishing carrot? Last night after taking a bite of that delectably tender steak, did you call up any of the cattle ranchers in Texas who helped raise it to perfection?

Probably not.

Yet does that mean you’re ungrateful for their work? Of course not\! Many of us couldn’t grow our own vegetable gardens if we tried, let alone raise our own beef\! We are incredibly grateful to those who work in agriculture because they play a pivotal role in society.

And here’s my point: ***The most important work is often the most difficult and the least visible.***

Agriculture is hard, often back-breaking labor. Millions of men and women across the country spend their lives and fortunes trying to provide the rest of us with decent produce and edible meat and dairy. Yet, very few of them are honored or applauded by the general public. Some are even scorned.

You, my entrepreneurial friend, are a farmer in your local economy.

Just like a farmer, you don’t always see the fruit of your work until you’ve tilled the soil, planted the seeds, irrigated your crop, and prayed for the sunshine to bring it to life.

Innovation and leadership can be excruciating work and few people ever stop to appreciate it. 

The gentleman strolling down the street past your business doesn’t think about the mental drain it takes to create a master product. No one else is thinking about how to solve dicy conflict on your team. Few people notice the tension on your face as you wait for a customer to finalize the large purchase order you needed weeks ago. The president won’t give you a medal for spending long thankless hours balancing budgets, running payrolls, or calling prospects.

Everyone wants to be part of the harvest. Who doesn’t enjoy seeing the visible results? Yet without your grit and determination, Entrepreneur, there is no foundation for success. No harvest. No results.

What you do is hard work, but it’s crucial for economic growth. 

Because you’re a farmer.

Don’t be discouraged. You’re changing communities. You’re changing lives. And, whether big or small, you are even changing the world.

Keep being the best you\!

- Matthias

PS: What about you? What are your projects where you’re digging the dirt and praying for rain? What about the places you’re celebrating the harvest? I’d love to hear your story\!

Well, when I think of it in the context of leadership, dealing with some of my mindset, some of my emotional baggage, etc is not something that lends immediate visible progress, but it's hugely valuable to moving forward.

Some of the most difficult questions about your business, your longterm direction, your positioning, etc. are also examples of very difficult, yet very important work

And given some of the direction you’re going, it’s also the training, the preparation, the process, the growth, etc.
