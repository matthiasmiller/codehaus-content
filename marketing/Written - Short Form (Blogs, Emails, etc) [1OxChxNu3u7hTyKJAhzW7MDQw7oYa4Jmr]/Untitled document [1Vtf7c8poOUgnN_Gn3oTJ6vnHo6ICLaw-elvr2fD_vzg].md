With this, there are three important principles to remember:

First, to change the speed of your environment, your objective is to propel yourself as quickly as possible. It is imperative that you are moving forward and doing so quickly. As you do that, you will naturally increase the speed of your environment, creating lift.

Second, you must leverage your environment. Lift is not created by sheer effort but by creatively changing the environment to help you move upward. 

While you can get greater lift by flying directly into the wind, your goal is not to for the wind to blow another direction. Similarly, you may choose to directly oppose current trends, creating changes in the landscape of your own market. However, for these purposes, your goal is not to reverse these trends but simply to create enough change to propel you upward.
