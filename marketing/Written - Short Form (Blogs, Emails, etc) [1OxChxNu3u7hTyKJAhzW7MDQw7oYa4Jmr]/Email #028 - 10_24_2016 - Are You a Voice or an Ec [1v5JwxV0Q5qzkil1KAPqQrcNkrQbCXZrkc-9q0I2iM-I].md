Have you ever gone “caving”? 

I’m told it’s pretty fun--as long as you don’t mind crawling into the earth through a small hole and navigating around tight spaces.

Usually, the cave eventually opens up into a large chamber where you experience one of the most distinct features of a cave: The Echo.

We’re pretty familiar with the echo, whether in caves, canyons, or cathedrals. Of course, with every echo you need something to provide sound: The Voice.

When it comes to business and leadership, there are a lot of echoes bouncing around out there. People constantly mimic and duplicate what has already been spoken or done.

Echoes are not original. They don’t pioneer new borders or develop new strategies. They’re always one step behind the voice.

The people who really bring about progress are the voices, the ones saying new things then echoed by a hundred different people.

Many parrot famous teachers and influencers, but few actually take established ideas, make them their own, and continue to build on them. If you do, you are a *voice*, an originator.

As we discover the perspectives and talents unique to us, we become the fresh voice for solutions to the problems facing our community, industry, or team. We push the boundaries a little farther in places they’ve never been pushed before.

*We progress forward.*

If we would each grab ahold of the best ideas, combine them to make new ideas, and express them through the giftings uniquely given to each of us, we could together push the world forward.

This is how you can uniquely...

Be the best you\!

**Voice or Echo**

I once had someone tell me that I would mature into become a voice, not just an echo. I didn’t understand what they meant. Since then, I’ve come to realize that as we discover the things that are unique to us, we start sharing that message. Many people can parrot a famous teacher, but few people can take ownership of ideas, enhance them, and make them their own. But if you do, you can become a voice, not just an echo.
