# **Chapter: Bias Towards Action**

It matters little how big your dreams or how vast your inspiration if you're unwilling to take measurable steps to achieve them. It takes more than simply declaring what you want and defining what your life is about. It means you taking a step forward and creating momentum in your life by taking action.

The measure of your value may be measured by the intentions of your heart, but the measure of your results will be measured by your actions.

You must resolve in your heart that you will not fool yourself into thinking that you are doing something when you're not. When we are dreaming, it's easy to measure progress by the ideas we generate. However, ideas are cheap and popular. What's costly is their implementation.

It's not rocket science. If you plan for an event, or you think about doing something, that action is not complete until you've actually done it. Thinking about it might allow you to do it more intelligently, but it will not get you results.

Unless you're doing brain surgery, it's better for you to do something poorly than it is to not to do it all. You must get started, and you must keep getting started, and you must discipline yourself to finish.

Before I wrote this book, I had started several others. For some of them, I had written outlines. For one, I had actually written 3-4 chapters. But none of it matters until the book is complete and it's in people's hands.

Nobody's going to turn to me and tell me, "Wow, Matthias\! You have several partial book outlines and an incomplete manuscript\! You're such a great author\!" No\! They won't recognize me for my accomplishments until (I know, surprise\!) I actually do that.

Just because it's simple, doesn't mean that we easily fool ourselves into thinking that we've done more than we have.

## **Stop the foolishness\!**

Let's just stop the foolishness right now\!

If you have an area of your life where you're not getting the results that you'd like, make a list of all of the things that you've started:

---

---

---

---

---

And write the things that you've completed:

---

---

---

---

---

Finally, write the things that you've thought about doing but haven't:

---

---

---

---

---

Take a look over this list. The question I ask you is, "How many of these things have you actually tried?"

If you're like many people, you have ideas of what you want to try and the things you want to do, but at the end of the day, you've tried very few of those things.

Stop the foolishness\!

Stop telling yourself that you've done all of these things.

If you're busy thinking of all kinds of ideas, just stop and shift your focus for a moment. Stop looking for all kinds of ideas and just start taking action.

If you're stuck in your life, you need to make action one of your greatest priorities. Do it.

Stop looking for the greatest idea, and start looking for the next one. Find one that you're willing to execute, and execute it relentlessly until you're able to bring it completion.

When you stop thinking about your ideas and you prioritize action, that's when you'll get momentum and actually start seeing results.

## **Create an Action Bias**

In everything that you are trying to accomplish, create an action bias. If you're working to create a new business, everything depends on you taking an action bias. If you're looking to grow your abilities, that depends on you taking an action bias.

If you're in a meeting, brainstorming the vision of a new venture, don't forget to create an action bias.

If you are learning a new skill, take a bias towards action. If you're learning how to lead, by all means, take deliberate action towards leading.

Many ideas die, not because they were poor ideas or because nobody saw their potential. Many ideas die because they were over-discussed, overanalyzed, and never executed. Some of your ideas you must kill, and kill quickly. But do not let your best ideas die by refusing to take action.

## **Break the Indecision**

Many people never execute on their dreams, because they are scared that when they reach them, they will have chosen the wrong path and they will be dissatisfied. Or they get stuck between two options, trying to weigh them out, deliberating forever, scared they'll miss out on the best.

You must choose the best, every single day of your life, but you must also make those decisions.

Every day that you delay your decision, you are delaying your dreams. If you never execute and never follow through, you will have a safe, mediocre life. But it will only be by the luck of the draw that you may stumble upon your dreams and what you really want to do.

You have the power and privilege of being intentional with how you life your life. You get to determine where you want to be and who you want to become, but it's up to you to use it. If you want to use your days living in indecision, so be it.

Your indecision may be because you're trying to choose between two poor options, and you're struggling because you know you like neither of them. Many of us get caught in the trap thinking that only the options that others present to us are the options that we truly have.

We spend our lives responding to others, instead of setting a clear direction for ourselves. Yes, it is much more difficult, but it is a much better life.

Ask yourself: "If you had not been given these opportunities and you could choose any direction, what would you choose?" You may find yourself describing something that comes close to one of your options, or you may find yourself describing something entirely difference.

But now you have clarity, a valuable gift. And with clarity, you can make a decision and start taking clear action.

Not every decision has a clear, definite answer. Sometimes we are unable to measure the outcomes of two decisions, and finally we simply do a gut check and take a leap. We do it on a hunch. The bigger the risk, the more consideration we give. But even significant life decisions do not always have a clear, definite answer.

You will need to make a decision, and embrace it, and disallow yourself from returning to the many "what if" questions that indecision likes to bring. You are here, and you are moving forward.

To take clear, definitive action you must be clear on what you want. If you don't have clarity, you can create it by making a decision. When you've made that decision, that's when you can begin taking deliberate action towards your dreams.

## **Past the Point of No Return**

Many people fear going past the point of no return. If you recall, that was the mantra of Christopher Columbus's day. I'm sure many people secretly considered the idea. But the fear of the day was that, if the earth was flat, you would drop off the edge of the earth.

Many people still have a flat-earth theory today, not about the earth but about the life they live. They are afraid to set sail, to lose sight of the shore, to head for the horizon, because they fear the just might drop off the edge of the earth.

Many people never take the action they need because they are unable to see past the horizon, and they are scared of going past the point of no return.

* What if I take on a college debt that I can't repay?

* What if I quit my job, my venture fails, and I can't find work again?

* What if I fall in love? Will I get married, have kids, and never be able to travel the world?

These are great questions as a matter of consideration, but not as a matter of fear. You're not going to drop off the map, and if you do, the fall is much shorter than you realize, and the path up, while difficult, is quite possible.

You cannot take consistent deliberate action unless you are committed to a result, and you cannot commit yourself to a result unless you are willing to dismiss the fear of the point of no return.

The point of commitment is to set your own parameters for you to become truly successful. The point really is to give you a point of no return, to force you to draw a line in the sand that says, "Like it or not, I'm moving forward and I'm not looking back."

The real fear that you face is that on the other side of your commitment is an abyss, not something that you will be glad you worked for.

You must make that commitment, because without it, you will never take that next step. Without it, you will never keep making steps forward, even when it gets difficult.

## **You Have Permission**

Many people are held back because they are waiting on someone else's permission to be someone great. They are waiting for their parents, their spouse, or their boss to give them permission to be significant.

Let me in on a secret: You have permission.

You have permission to be great. You have permission to matter. You have permission to make a difference.

Many times we are unwilling to embrace the fact that all of our heroes were, at one time, in fact novices. We dare not associate with the people we admire the most because their success far outweighs our own. But we forget that at one time, they were in our own shoes. They were the ones who were finding their way, developing their skill, becoming the best person they could be, making many mistakes along the way.

You are not much different from these people that you admire, except for the opportunities they may have been given and the time they've had to develop their skill.

Success is not an elite club. It is not something that you are born into or must pay your way into. It is not something that you must be invited into. It is something that you deliberately enter by the way you life your life, and nobody is stopping you from living your life well.

If you are waiting for someone else's permission to be great, you will always be waiting to take action and to move forward. You will always be standing in the sidelines, watching the game.

It doesn't mean that you disregard everything the people around you are telling you. You must have people who are close to you whom you can trust. You must have people who will tell you the honest truth about you. I do not mean that you should trample others or disregard the impact on relationships.

However, many people simply take no action because they are waiting for someone else to see their own potential. You will not always be able to find people who are immediately ready and willing to support you to living a bigger life. If you are the one who sees your own potential, then you must be the one to take deliberate action towards it.

You must be prepared for dissonance.

If the people around you do not see your potential, they will treat you as if it didn't exist. They will treat you as the same person they've always known and seen. However, you get to choose whether you want to live out of other people's perceptions of you, or whether you want to live out of a realization of your potential and who you could become.

That's the power of living by your potential.
