Let me reveal a little secret about myself.

I am the youngest of the four brothers in my family. This means I had many options to follow, growing up: I could become Lil’ Wes, Lil’ Ellis, or Lil’ John Allan. So many options\!

Believe it or not, I actually tried that\! As much as I love my brothers and admire their examples, I realized I don’t want to be a Lil’ Somebody Else\! I need to be Matthias.

I need to be who I was created to be, doing what I was created to do...(which every youngest knows is to Rule the World).

Truth be told, nobody has led the mobile revolution by knocking off the iPhone. No one has overturned the coffee market by imitating Starbucks.

To become a leader, you must disregard the hundred-and-one different things you can never be. You must find the one thing only you can be.

To get there, you have to be okay with trying and failing and trying again. You must be okay with getting it wrong sometimes and learning through your mistakes.

What you offer the world is unique. You only win when you settle into who you are and offer yourself at your best.

Becoming a better version of your competitors is a rat race you cannot win. You can’t be your competitors, let alone beat them at being themselves. So be your best self and you’ll create a race you can win every time, because no one can beat you at being “you”\!

Dr. Seuss put it best: “Today you are you\! That is truer than true\! There is no one alive who is you-er than you\!”

You are not your brothers; you are you. So be the best you\!
