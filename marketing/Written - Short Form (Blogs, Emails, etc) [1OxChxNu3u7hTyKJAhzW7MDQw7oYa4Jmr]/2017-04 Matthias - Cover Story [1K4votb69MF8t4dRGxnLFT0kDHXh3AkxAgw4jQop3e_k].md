**Title: Don’t Think About It**

**Target: 1500**

Nicole rolled over, grabbed her phone, and blindly hit the volume button to silence her raucous alarm clock.

Instinctively, she swiped her screen and pulled up Facebook. Scrolling through the feed, there wasn't much to see since she'd gone to bed six hours ago. She tapped "like" on a few pictures of her nephew, then instinctively pulled up her email.

"That's right," she remembered. "I never replied to those questions from Aaron." She started typing a reply, then thought better of it. "I'll just call him this morning."

She stumbled into the kitchen, dumped some grounds into her coffee maker, splashed in some water, and hit the button. She opened the cupboard door to get her breakfast. Oatmeal, cereal, a bagel, or fruit? She grabbed a bagel and dropped it in the toaster. Something quick and easy.

Ten minutes later found Nicole standing in front of her closet. She had a meeting with a potential client, and she wanted to look professional, yet attractive--eye-catching, yet not too forward. She narrowed her choices down to two, then at the last minute, decided to go with a third option.

By the time Nicole rolled into the office at 7:30, she felt a little frazzled. She sat down at her desk.

"Where should I start?" she asked herself.

As she unlocked her computer, her eyes drifted to the Facebook tab she'd left open the night before. Serendipitously, her friend had shared a blog post entitled, "9 Reasons You're Distracted by 9 AM".

Nicole clicked through the link, and these are the lessons she learned.

## **Most of us make too many decisions.**

From the moment we wake up, most of us are bombarded by decisions. They start before our feet hit the floor. Do we hit the snooze or get out of bed? Should we check Facebook or email first? Should we watch the video now, or should we save it for later? Which emails should we read? Do we need to reply later, or should we just reply quickly now?

Estimates around how many decisions we make a day vary wildly from 5,000 to 50,000. Regardless, most of those decisions provide very little value to your success. Yes, including my decision on exactly how to phrase the first sentence of this paragraph.

See what I mean?

Of those decisions, a very small percentage of them have a dramatic impact on the outcome of your success. And a very large percentage of them may actually distract you from getting where you want.

## **Decision-making is about managing your mental energy.**

We all have limited energy to make decisions, and the fresher our energy, the better our decisions. Studies show that court cases often receive more favorable rulings in the morning, when the judge's energy is higher, than in the afternoon after he's already had to make a lot of decisions.

The more energy you spend on making trivial decisions, the less energy you have for the strategic, high-impact decisions.

Who you marry is more important than whether you buy her flowers or chocolate. Choosing your target market and offer is more important than the exact design of your ad.

Don't get me wrong--little choices can have a big impact. But they only matter once you've settled the big decisions. In fact, sometimes getting the little decisions out of the way is the only way to get the mental clarity that you need to make the big decisions.

Here are a few simple ways to get started.

## **Simplify your morning.**

First, don't wake up to your phone. Yes, you should get a plain, old-fashioned alarm clock and leave your phone in another room. You owe it to yourself.

Picking up your phone and browsing Facebook or watching Snapchats gives you a dopamine boost without tangible benefit, and it immediately puts you into reactivity. In fact, I've made some changes that allow me to plan my entire day without looking at my phone.

Second, simplify your wardrobe. Find yourself a comfortable outfit and duplicate it five times. When I started doing this, I was surprised how convenient it was to grab my clothes without thinking about what to wear. It was one less thing to think about.

If you really need variety in your wardrobe, do yourself a favor and choose what you're going to wear the night before.

Third, make it easy to get good nutrition. Almost every quick-and-easy breakfast is high in sugar and carbohydrates, which won't give you sustained energy. I've had much better success with fried eggs and stir-fried avocados, a combination of a high-protein and quality fat that provide much more stable, longer-lasting energy.

Don’t take this as medical advice (I’m not a dietitian). However, know this: the quality of your nutrition will determine the quality of your mental clarity, and having a simple, repeatable breakfast plan takes one more decision out of your hectic day.

Finally, create a predictable morning routine. You can make it as simple or complex as you like, as long as your morning routine serves you. My morning routine includes things things such as hydration, journaling, and daily planning. It's a simple, repeatable process, and I use a checklist so that I don't have to think about what I'm doing next. On the days when I oversleep or have an early meeting, I can shorten it down to a 5-minute daily planning session.

The planning itself removes a lot of questions from my mind. I'm clear on what I'm focused on, and I rarely have to spend much time determining priorities.

Yep, one less decision.

As Nicole read the article, she realized she'd spent her whole morning distracted and reactive without ever getting clarity. No wonder she found it easy to click through to the article on Facebook.

Despite the pile of papers waiting on her desk, her curiosity pulled her into the next section.

## **Simplify your workflow.**

Every part of our newsletter production process is strictly choreographed. I get reminder emails at a specific time every month, I have a specific deadline for the rough drafts, and my team knows exactly what needs to be done and when it needs to be completed.

However, it wouldn't be possible without the supportive tools that make it possible.

1. **Organize all documents in a shared location.** There's no emailing files back and forth, or searching for files in a messy inbox. Most of our documents are stored in a Google drive and safeguarded by an automatic backup service. Our folder structure makes it incredibly easy to find the right document, and oftentimes it reflects the workflow. Documents move from one folder to the next as they move towards completion. Anything that isn't in Google drive lives in our AppHosting.zone business management solution, where we track hours, projects, contacts, and working procedures.  
2. **Create systems and checklists for things that need to be repeated.** All of our working procedures live in our online platform, allowing easy editing and automatic email alerts when another team member modifies a document. I don't have to worry about my team forgetting specific parts of the process, and they don't have to wait for me to make corrections to processes.  
3. **Automate your email inbox.** Ninety-eight percent of my email bypasses my inbox. Email receipts are automatically tagged, then exported to G-Drive for bookkeeping. All of my email subscriptions and email groups are tagged, skipping my inbox. I've pinned these folders on my iPhone mail client, allowing me to easily read this content at my leisure.  
4. **Set up recurring events and email reminders.** I live off my calendar, and I use recurring events to manage my schedule. When I have specific things that need my attention, I often set up a recurring email--either weekly or monthly--reminding me of these things.  
5. **Automate your scheduling and planning.** Every evening at 5:10, my printer spits off a copy of tomorrow's schedule. I can grab it as I leave my office, reminding me of things I need to discuss with my wife and allowing me to plan my days without pulling up my iPhone.

As Nicole reviewed the article, she quickly made a list of three things she could do to eliminate noise in her life. She also jotted a note to pick up an alarm clock and some healthier breakfast foods on her way home from work.

## **Get ready for a new day.**

The next morning, Nicole groggily reached over, trying to find the phone on her nightstand. "That's right," she remembered. She turned off her alarm clock, then looked across her room. Her outfit was waiting for her. She could smell the coffee that she had scheduled the night before.

She stumbled out of bed and out into her kitchen. As she reached for her frying pan, she became aware of  how fresh her mind was. Her mind began to wander, and as it did, she began thinking about an untapped opportunity in her business.

For Nicole, it truly was the dawn of a new day.
