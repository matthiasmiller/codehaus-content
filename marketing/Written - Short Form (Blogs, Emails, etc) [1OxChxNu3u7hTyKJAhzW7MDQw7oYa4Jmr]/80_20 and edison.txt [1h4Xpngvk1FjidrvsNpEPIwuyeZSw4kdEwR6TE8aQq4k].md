I don't remember if I have this recorded anywhere but there is a  
statistical rule that says that when you have a series of unusual outcomes,  
it increases the odds for other outcomes.

This means that as long as you are consistently failing in different ways,  
the 8020 rule guarantees that you will eventually succeed. And as long as  
you're succeeding in small pieces, as long as you keep trying the proper  
nations, you're guaranteed to hit a major success
