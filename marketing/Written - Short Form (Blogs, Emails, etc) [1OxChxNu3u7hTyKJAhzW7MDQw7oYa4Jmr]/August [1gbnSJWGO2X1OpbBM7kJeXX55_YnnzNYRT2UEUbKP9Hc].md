# **The Overlooked Weapon to Defeating Overwhelm and Silencing the Noise**

The greatest asset of any leader is not your time. It’s not your money. It's another critical resource.

It's your focus, your energy, and your attention.

Over the past months, I've written about the power of proactivity in leadership. Each time I've written about it, I've taken it to another level. And today, I want to invite you into another, even more powerful level of intentionality in leadership.

However, before we get started, I want to begin by challenging two mindsets I had to unravel to get to where I am today.

## **Proactivity Does NOT Mean Running Yourself Ragged**

The myth behind much of the hustle and bustle of productivity mantras of today centers around this idea:

More hours equal more productivity and more results.

This is patently false.

It's true that highly effective people work hard, and often work long hours. However, that is not the ONLY prerequisite for productivity.

Those long hours must be productive.

How do you get there?

You do that by allowing those hours to be laser-focused on the things that truly matter the most. And you sustain that by setting yourself up every single day for success.

Yes, I’m a firm believer in leaving it all on the court. However, that's NOT the same as destroying yourself.

## **Most of Us Lie About the Time We Have And Use**

And this...

The most powerful revelation about productivity and leadership.

If you've been around me long enough, you know that I'm a voice AGAINST to-do lists. While I don't have time to go into the depths of my reasons (pull up older versions of the newsletter to find out why), I've uncovered another reason why I feel so passionately about this.

To-do lists make it easy to lie about the time and energy you have to devote to something.

When someone asks you to do something, it only takes a second to add it to your little notepad beside your laptop or your Notes app on your phone.

Low resistance now.

High resistance later.

This is a form of self-deception. It makes it unrealistically easy to say yes to people's requests.

This is why many people feel like they are running ragged, trying harder and harder, yet struggling to reach the objectives they are after.

Fortunately, I've been on a path to reverse this, and I'm about to pull back the curtain on a practice that has revolutionized my focus and energy.

## **The Little System That Will Never, Ever Lie**

The solution has actually been quite simple. I've transitioned from a to-do list to a calendar.

It's not that I use a calendar.

It's that I 100% RELY on a calendar.

I lean on it.

Every single day.

And it refuses to lie, as long as I'm willing to be honest with it.

We'll get into the tactics in a second, but first I want to talk about the power that this lends.

## **Flip the Resistance**

If you're like most leaders, your schedule is a complex Tetris puzzle that you're trying to navigate in real time while things are being adjusted. And you're trying to avoid all the little pieces getting stacked up in the process.

When you're working from a to-do list, this becomes an ongoing frustration.

When you deliberately choose to work from a calendar, it releases the pressure valve on your demands.

Why?

When someone makes a request, you must now deliberately find a spot in your calendar for that task or event.

If you already have meetings scheduled with other people, finding a time slot becomes increasingly difficult. While still possible to add things to your schedule, it comes at a cost.

You must decide whether you will cancel your current meetings and experience the pain of rescheduling, or whether you'll decline the incoming request.

Fortunately, when you do this correctly, you don't have to worry about actually getting the project done. You have a guaranteed time slot to do it.

High resistance up front.

Low resistance on completion.

## **Maximize (But Don't Overload) Your Resources**

And here's another subtle, yet powerful benefit.

When you do this correctly, you'll never feel overwhelmed or overextended.

You'll feel exhausted.

You'll feel spent.

Why?

Every single day, you are dealing with the unchangeable reality of time. You're cooperating with it, rather than constantly trying to fight it or adapt it.

Goodbye, self-deception.

Hello, brand new leader\!

## **First, Get This In Place**

We're going to take a look into more of the specifics of what it takes to pull this off. However, I want to make something incredibly clear to you.

The most powerful way to uplevel your leadership is not actually through coaching and training (although that's important).

It's not through books or resources or strategic tools (although these, too, are important).

The most powerful way to uplevel your leadership is...

(Ready for it?)

Getting around people who are playing the game at a completely different level.

Put yourself in the right environment, and you'll find yourself forced to either remove yourself from that environment or uplevel yourself to a higher level.

(It's true. I've watched this happen multiple times just today. Because of things I was talking about and experiencing, I challenged multiple people to uplevel their game and play at a different level. Not because I was trying to lead them. It was because I'm living at a different place than I was even a month ago. And that is because I put myself in a great environment.)

Most people are unwilling to make the personal, financial, emotional, and even spiritual investment to put themselves into the right environment.

Which is good for *you*.

Because when everyone else checks out, that's when you start to stand out and shine.

So, what are the pieces that I put into place to make this happen?

## **A Guaranteed Great Start To Every Single Day**

If you've followed leading experts and thought leaders on productivity, you'll find most of them talk about a morning routine.

Here's why it's important.

Nobody knows exactly in what state they're going to wake up. You might be in the mood to go win at life. You might be in the mood to throw in the towel.

A good morning routine sets you up for success, every single day.

I've tried a number of them, by the way, and I've struggled with most of them.

This time, I've landed on one that's powerful for me.

For me, it's not a checklist.

It's not just a routine.

It's a ritual.

It's a habit.

It's a commitment to myself.

I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that every single morning, before I head to the office, I am going with a clear heart, clear head, and clear agenda.

I know what I'm going to do. I know when I'm going to do it.

So what are the elements of a good morning routine?

It must be something that:

* You can actually remember without checking off dozens of checkboxes  
* Lets you fall in love with the process

It must be something that addresses every part of who you are:

* Your body (through nutrition and exercise)  
* Your mind (through healthy thinking and perspective)  
* Your heart (through resolving issues you haven't dealt with)  
* Your spirit (through worship, wonder, and truth)

Oh, and one more thing...

Every day, I remind myself of the person I am called to become.

Every single day, I address the things that will hold me back.

And because of that, I'm able to show up with my full commitment to accomplish what I need to accomplish.

It's a habit.

Unless I interfere, it's going to happen.

Unless you set up your day for success, you have no guarantee that you will hold to your schedule.

With that, let's dig deeper into the exact process that I use for my schedule.

## **The Monthly and Weekly Rituals**

Every single month, I have a process to uncover the things that are the highest priorities.

Want to know another advantage of no to-do lists?

Everyone has a limited number of things they can keep in their head at a time. (And if you're overwhelmed, chances are it's because you're trying to keep too many of them in your head.)

Avoiding lengthy lists forces you narrow your focus to a small handful of objectives every month.

Something you can focus on.

Something you can actually achieve.

Not a million disconnected things that you're chasing.

(Listen, if you think you don't have the luxury of narrowing your focus, I'm about to tell you the truth. You don't have the luxury of NOT narrowing your focus.)

This monthly perspective allows me to do the same thing on a weekly basis. From that specific point, I can focus my energy on the very top objectives.

And that's what takes me to my favorite part:

Scheduling my week.

Each day is dedicated to a different focus. For example, our team meeting happens on Monday. I leave the first two days of my week for my most productive work. I move as many of my meetings as possible to Friday, so that I won't risk my energy levels for other things that demand my highest attention.

From there, I start moving specific pieces on the calendar.

I have an event for every single thing that I'm committed to achieving that week.

And I make a commitment to myself not to stretch the truth.

This means a breather between meetings.

This means making sure the meeting is long enough in the first place.

This means scheduling time for follow-up, if required.

This means leaving some downtime if I have a busier-than-usual day.

This means leaving margin for things that are likely to come up.

No lies.

Just truth.

It's not always easy.

It sometimes requires juggling pieces.

It requires judgment calls.

It requires honesty.

When done correctly, it opens up another level of intentionality.

## **The Domino of the Perfect Week**

Listen...

I get that leadership is no walk in the park.

It's just that it's a lot harder when your body, your mind, your energy, and your focus aren't in the right place.

Start your Monday well, and you'll end it well.

End your Monday well, and you'll start Tuesday well.

You'll create a domino effect that will carry you through Friday.

Create the weekend that you need to recharge (and you need to recharge), and it'll set you up for Monday.

Will you stumble? Yes

Will you have days that you're a bit off? Yes, even weeks like that.

However, you will dramatically reduce the impact that this will have on you, your productivity, and your team.

Now, just one more thing...

## **How Does This Fit Into Your Heart-Centered Leadership Ethos?**

You might be wondering how this fits into a heart-centered leadership ethos.

I'd like to recap a few principles that you may have heard me talking about in previous newsletters.

First of all, I believe this is one of the most effective ways of being a heart-centered leader.

I've been around leaders in different arenas (and many whom I've respected) who made commitments that they never followed up with.

"I'll make sure that I check in with you."

"I still want you to be involved with \_\_\_\_\_\_."

And while they were well-meaning and had the best of intentions, it never happened.

Making a commitment without following through is not heart-centered. It doesn't mean it's ill-intentioned. It simply means that you're not prioritizing the people you say you care about.

Second of all, it's up to you as a leader to determine which of these requests you can accommodate and to allow room in your schedule to accommodate them.

For example, if you want to be available on a daily basis, reserve 30 minutes before lunch and before the end of your day. Use it to catch up on your reading or your strategic thinking. When someone wants that time with you, you can accommodate them.

The best part?

Meeting them will not put your week into a tailspin.

You'll be able to remain focused and present with them, while staying true to your commitments.

Interestingly, there's something that's one step better than ad hoc crisis meetings (which will certainly happen), which is to...

## **Stay On Schedule With Preventative Maintenance**

As a leader, it's up to you to ensure that the people you are responsible for are supported and valued.

And if you value it, it's on your calendar.

Recurring schedule.

Recurring agenda.

How are you doing?

How can I support you?

When you proactively address these issues, you reduce the number of urgent "I need a meeting before this all burns down" moments.

Good for them.

Good for you.

## **"Okay, but aren't you taking this calendar thing a bit too far?"**

Hey, you might be sitting on your lawn chair, sipping your pina colada, and agreeing with everything that I've written here.

"Been there, done that. About time he figured it out."

Or you might have done this out of necessity...

Yet you still find your calendar filling with more events than you have time...

Or you might be wondering if all of this is truly necessary.

I'll give you the quick answer.

No.

None of it is necessary.

I just happen to believe...

## **The World is Waiting for Leaders Like You**

Not everyone wakes up every morning with a cause that's burning on their hearts.

Not everyone wonders whose life will be different because of their impact.

Not everyone wants to make sure that they actually reach the fullness of their *own* calling.

Not the gentleman's next door.

Not the lady's across the street.

Yours.

I believe the world is waiting for leaders like you.

I believe lives will be different because of you.

I'm not content to stand on the sidelines.

I'm not content to let life pass by.

More importantly...

I'm not content to let children miss their own calling, because they didn't have the support they needed.

That's why I'm here.

It's why I do what I do.

It's why I wake up every single day.

It's why I push myself to improve every single day.

The question is...

Will you join me?

If you're on this list, I know you already care.

You're already working to be the best you can be.

I'm willing to share these lessons with you, under one condition:

You must be willing to join me on the journey.

We have a generation that will wait for a short time for us to show them the way, before they push us aside to find the path that nobody was willing to show them.

I'm willing to pay the price, and I hope you are, too.

Even if it means mastering something that, on the surface, is as ugly, boring, and difficult as moving my life to a calendar.

I'm all in.

Let's go together.
