Have you ever needed to catch a flight but had no way of getting to the airport? Your ticket, though it gives you permission to get on a flight and explore incredible places, is entirely contingent on your being able to get to the airport. Without that ride, your ticket will be worthless.

That’s exactly what it’s like to have a vision.

For years now, Taylor has wanted to build a space in his Los Angeles neighborhood where kids of all ages can hang out, study, and discover.

He envisions an ice-cream shop to support a safe but fun-filled youth center.

There is just one problem: it’s only a vision. Without a plan, it’s like a ticket to Fiji with a taxi ride to the airport.

Taylor’s vision has incredible potential, but without a plan of how to make that happen, the power of the vision will be left untapped.

Here are three tips my team and I have found helpful for developing a plan:  
 

**\#1 \- Write down where you want to end up**

Yes, it’s true--written goals really are that much more effective\!

Taylor’s goal: to open a self-supporting ice-cream shop and youth center. 

Perhaps your goal is to generate 30% more revenue than last year or open a locally themed coffee shop. 

Whatever it may be, get it down on paper so you can see where you’re headed.  
 

**\#2 \- List what attaining the goal will demand (Survey the Landscape)**

At this point, consider anything even if it’s far-fetched. You just want to get true understanding of what reaching your goal will demand.

Taylor’s vision will require a building practically located where young people can hang out for an afternoon. As well as one either large enough to hold a youth center or close enough to open land or other buildings which he can eventually grow into.

A list for Taylor should include details such as: 

* Ideal building location and cost  
* Necessary supply stock and cost  
* Number of employees required to run such a business

If you want to generate 30% more revenue for your business, your list may include: 

* Determining which ad campaign is most effective (and at what cost)  
* Finding ways to increase customer loyalty and lifetime value  
* Offering higher ticket items to give greater opportunity to upsell  
* Eliminating low-profit or no-profit items from your business  
* Determining your best customers and finding more ways to serve them  
* Spending more time prospecting for new clients

Get specific on the things required to get the job done.  
 

**\#3 \- Create an Action Plan**

From here, you have a good start to creating an action plan. You know where you want to go, you know what it requires. Now, how specifically are you going to get there? What are the next steps? 

Does it mean networking for the next few months and building a team of partners and advisors? Does it mean hiring someone to help you with your responsibilities? If you’re just starting out, does it mean pulling the trigger and quitting your day job? If so, how are you going to support yourself until you’re profitable?

For Taylor, an Action Plan could involve:

* Researching what it takes to run an ice-cream shop and community center (Surveying the Landscape)  
* Educating himself about the art of ice-cream making and business start-ups  
* Networking with local businesses and entrepreneurs  
* Getting feedback from the local youth about what they want in a ice-cream shop  
* Finding the ideal location  
* Researching options for loans and potential sponsors

An action plan should also include a tentative timeline with monthly, weekly, and daily goals, showing him what he should be moving toward week by week.

Above all, it demands clear, deliberate steps forward and requires the full support of your peers, mentors, spouse, and team. Although we sometimes fail at this, our team’s best results have always come from consistent, repeated movement because of specific goals and objectives we’ve set for ourselves.

*So what is your big vision? How do you plan to get there? Send me an email back, I’d love to hear it\!*

And as always, be the best you\!

# **Vision without a plan**

Having a vision without a plan is like having a airline ticket without a way to get to the airport.
