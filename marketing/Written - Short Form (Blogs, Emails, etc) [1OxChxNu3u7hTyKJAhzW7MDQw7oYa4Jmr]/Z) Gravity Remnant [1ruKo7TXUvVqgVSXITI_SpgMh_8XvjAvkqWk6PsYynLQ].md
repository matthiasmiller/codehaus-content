  
It’s critical to remember that in order to create lift, you must change the speed or change the direction of the air (or both).

The first thing to consider when creating lift is speed. If you are going the same speed as the crowd, you will not fly.  

The second thing to consider is direction. Lift happens when air is turned by an object. Air hits the airplane wing, and it’s direction is changed. It lifts and begins to climb.
