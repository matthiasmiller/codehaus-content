Do you remember when you first learned about gravity as a kid? It was so basic, yet so hard to understand. What *is* gravity? What keeps us on the earth? Why does the moon revolve around Earth instead of any other planet? And why don’t we all go--Earth, moon, and Mars--all go crashing into the sun?

Just like gravity in physics, it can be hard to understand in business as well. Why does it seem like some businesses attract customers effortlessly while you grind away to get a few? Why does it feel like you have to beg others to work with you and you eventually have to tolerate any customer who comes your way?

It seems complicated, but (just like physical gravity) it’s actually pretty basic. Gravitational pull is determined by two factors: *proximity* and *mass*.

The first factor, proximity, has to do with distance--how close objects are to each other. The closer one object is to another, the stronger the gravitational pull. If they drift apart, the pull is reduced. (Which is why the moon revolves around Earth instead of Mars.)

Proximity can be broken down into two more specific components (well do *mass* next week\!).

**Proximity to Your Customers or Clients**  
Although proximity can be measured any number of ways, the most obvious is this: How visible are you to your customers? Do they even know you exist? 

If you're a local business, can your customers find you on Google? Do you rank near the top? Are you visible on Facebook? What kinds of magazines are they reading? Do they listen to the radio or watch television? Even though Facebook’s user base is growing, you're still not going to reach baby boomers the same way you reach millennials.

Obviously this isn’t rocket science, but it's so simple, we can easily gloss over it. Which we can’t afford to do\!

Just because YOU know you exist doesn't mean the rest of the world does. My friends and I often joke about "new" discoveries we make about our small town--such as businesses established over 10 years ago. While we aren't natives by a long-shot, we're not exactly the new kids on the block, either. Yet we’ve never heard of these places.

***Don't assume everyone knows you exist.***

However, proximity to your customers doesn’t just mean getting in front of people’s eyeballs. It also means being able to crawl inside someone else's skin to experience life as they experience it.

Again, take my hometown for example. While Canon City has had some fantastic coffee shops in the past, they never lasted long. Until one shop bucked the trend, choosing a different location (and different model) than any other coffee shop before it.

They ditched the stereotype and stripped the coffee shop experience down to one thing: a drive-through. They've proven to their customers they understand the busy and sometimes sleep-deprived workforce, rushing to get their kids ready for school before racing out the door to make it to work on time. If they're running late, they can even call in their order when they leave the house to shorten the wait.

While they've got a great location, they've been able to tap into something much more important. They've been able to crawl inside people's minds and give them what they really want.

But they’ve also been able to do something more.

**Distance from Your Competition**  
They've also been able to distance themselves from their competition. The only other coffee shop with a drive-through is ten miles outside of town, catching commuters on their way to Colorado Springs.

When you distance yourself from your competition, you stop fighting against their gravitational pull.

Don't get me wrong--blindly distancing yourself from your competitors can get you in trouble. If you distance yourself from your competitors and don't move yourself closer to your customers, you've lost the game.

However, when you find the magic balance between distancing yourself from your competitor while getting closer to your customers, you automatically increase the strength of your gravitational pull.

Combine that with an increased *mass* and you’ll be a customer magnet--but we’ll save that for next week.

Until then, continue to…

Be the best you\!
