If you’re like me, you’ve probably been told at some point to “Just be yourself.” But what does it actually mean to “be yourself” and why does it matter?

Think of yourself as a book that everyone you meet is reading. When you walk down the street, people judge you first by your cover, and eventually by your contents if they get to know you. As you interact with strangers or friends, they see the unique message written on the pages of your life.

People are naturally curious and want to hear your message. They want to know what you care about, what is burning inside of you waiting to come out. 

However, sharing your message is terrifying: What if people don’t like it? What if they critique it, dismiss it, and toss you aside? So it’s easy to shut the covers and try to fake a message you know the world will like.

But people sense very quickly when we’re lying to them. As frightening as it may be, you must learn to just be yourself. Open up those pages and let people see who you really are and what you care about.

This is what it means to Be Yourself.

However, sometimes we don’t even know, ourselves, who we are. That’s why it’s important to slow down, step back, and evaluate who you really are: what actually lies inside the covers of your life. 

What is your message? Because once you know your message--that fire burning inside your chest--you will be able to be yourself, speaking and living your message with clarity and precision.

Everything in your life revolves around your message (because you’re a book\!).

You can't escape or ignore it. You must simply embrace it and let it drive every part of your life. Live it 100%. Let it define who you are at work, how you respond in relationships--even how you drive on the freeway.  
   
**Finding Your Message**

You won’t find your message in an instant, but you can begin discovering it by:

1. Writing down what breaks your heart and what excites it--this shows where your passion lies.  
2. Noting the patterns in how you relate to others, asking your friends for their perspective--this can reveal your giftings.  
3. Taking time to process life and clear your mind. This may mean journaling, taking walks, going on vacation, detoxing from electronics and media, spending several hours or days alone. This allows new vision, creativity and perspective to surface that otherwise would not have fit into the crowd of thoughts in your mind.

Pay attention to yourself. Think about it. Keep journaling. And as you learn what your message is, live it out, letting it touch every part of what you do.

And soon you’ll experience the freeing, transformative power of being the Best You.
