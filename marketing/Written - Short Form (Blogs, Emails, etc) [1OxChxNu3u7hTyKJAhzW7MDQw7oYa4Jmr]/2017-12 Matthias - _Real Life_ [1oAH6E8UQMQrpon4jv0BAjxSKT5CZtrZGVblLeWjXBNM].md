How do you manage life when you're faced with unusually intense pressures and challenges? How do you stay productive at work when you face challenges at home? How do you stay engaged at home when work stress is building up?

Maybe you've heard the term "work-life balance" or come across the "Wheel of Life" coaching assessment. According to this way of thinking, life is a zero-sum game where you can achieve an "ideal state" where everything is perfectly balanced. That is, until something knocks you off your equilibrium, which happens almost daily\!

I find that perspective damaging and unhelpful. Instead, I love the premise of the book *The Balance Myth* by Teresa Taylor. While she specifically addresses women in the workplace, her summary is fitting for any entrepreneur:

"True success is living an accomplished life and making sure that life is fully lived. To think in terms of 'balance' would require us to make a trade-off between one life and another. Instead, if your work life is challenging, take energy from your home and put it into work. If your home life is difficult, give yourself a break at work so you can focus on home. I couldn't take the mother out of the career woman or vice versa."

We must look at these situations as a *whole person* not as a *balanced wheel*.

Over the past month, my wife and I have had to put this perspective to the test. Here are some practical things that we've done to thrive in the light of a number of very challenging situations.

1. We've got each other's back. Always. We've been intentional about watching out for each other to make sure we're doing well and managing our stress.  
2. Each of us have specific individuals we reach out to for support--as often as we need.  
3. We've increased our communication to protect our relationship. We've continued to prioritize doing fun things together.  
4. We've focused on being grateful and laughing. Several years ago, we made this a specific goal, and those skills have helped us tremendously.  
5. We've had to manage our expectations for what we can accomplish during this time.  
6. We've both had to make compromises to help each other with our respective responsibilities.

Whatever you do, don't go this journey alone\! If you're in a challenging place, remember that in the green room behind every brightly-lit stage are real people facing real challenges. Take heart and take courage, because you're not alone\!
