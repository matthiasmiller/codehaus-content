# **Chapter: Your Personal Freedom**

One of the most important lessons I learned was learning how to steward my personal freedom. I remember the day I was walking down the road, thinking about the things that were going on in my life, and I had this flash of revelation. Over the next weeks, I began unpacking a concept that has been the foundation of a fundamental perspective shift in how I approach my life and my choices.

Let me tell you a story.

## **The Parable of the Investor**

Once upon a time there was a village. Every time a villager turned 18 years old, he or she was given a $1000 by the chief. Every one of them knew that whatever they made or lost on that $1000 would be either greatly rewarded or greatly punished.

Some of the people in that village didn't care about the money they had been given. Sometimes when someone else would ask to invest some of their money, they would just hand it over willingly, never giving it a second thought.

Some of them would hand over their money, but not without special instructions of how to care for it and how to invest it. Some of the villagers got very angry because when others asked for their money, they wouldn't treat it or handle it the way that the villager had hoped.

Most times, they never got the money back, and over the months and years, those $1000 slowly dwindled down hundred by hundred, until at last, they were enslaved by the rich investors in their village.

The richest people were those who kept control of their own money. Some of the village members cared intensely about investing their money. They watched closely over it. They did what they could to protect it and to make it grow. And with time, their investment began to grow.

That's what it means to steward your personal freedom.

You have been given a bank account of personal freedom. Unlike money, you can never lose your personal freedom, but you can choose to surrender it. And you call allow your personal freedom to grow.

It is your responsibility to guard your personal freedom as you go through life. As you make decisions, as you continue growing, guarding your personal freedom is critical to being able to live a powerful life.

## **What is personal freedom?**

Personal freedom is your ability to make choices. Many people define personal freedom as something that is outside of their control, but that's absolutely not true.

Let me give you an example.

If you're working a job you don't like, you're forced to do things that you don't like to do. YO have to keep working to put food on the table. You can't jump ship and do something creative.

But is that really true?

Do you really NOT have the option of doing something else? In fact, the very moment you use the word stuck to describe your job, you're taking away your own freedom to feel anything but trapped in the situation that you're in.

Your language matters.

Even if you require that income source to pay the bills, even in a situation that's difficult, you have a choice. You have the choice to determine where you focus, where you put your attention.

That's personal freedom.

You might be a slave in a war camp. You might lose all control of when you get to go to the bathroom. You might lose control of what or how much you eat.

But they cannot take away your will to live. They cannot take away your perspective and outlook. They cannot keep you from finding joy in the most horrible of circumstances.

That's personal freedom.

It's the power for you to find the choice in the situation that you're in, and leveraging it to your betterment.

## **How we give up personal freedom**

We have lots of ways to give up personal freedom. Let me give you some really practical examples.

The most common example is blame. Whatever my life's situation is, I can't control it because it's really someone else's fault. Maybe it was a boss who hurt you. Maybe it was a business partner who cheated you. Maybe it was a father who wasn't there.

I'm not saying those are real, difficult situations.

But they're not excuses.

You get to choose whether you'll allow these things to hold you back, or if you'll move forward. No one has taken away your power to forgive. You hold that.

Placing blame on someone else is like taking money out of your bank account, giving it to someone else, then getting angry because they're not using it like you should.

No, to keep control of your own personal freedom, you have to be willing to make the choice of how you respond.

What else?

We limit ourselves to what other people think. However, as soon as you give into other people's perspectives and opinions, they get to determine the choices you make.

If you're bent on pleasing other people, and the people decide that the color of the day is blue, you'd better be happy with the color blue. You've given up your personal freedom and you've placed it in the hands of other people, who don't share your values or your opinions, and at the end of the day, don't care whether you live with regret.

What else?

It's up to you to develop a mindset of hope, one that says that within every situation, there is something that I can do, there is always a choice I can make. It's up to you to make sure that you don't merely give in to the situations around you, but you rise up and make a difference.

Hopelessness will rob you of the power to make powerful decisions. It keeps you trapped under your own belief of what is possible and what is impossible. To break through into a full life, you have to believe that something greater than your situation is truly possible, and you have to step out and pursue it.

What else?

Many people believe that if they were a manager, a boss, an owner, a political figure, they could have greater influence on society and on the world. They rob themselves of the ability to focus on the influence that they do have, and to grow the influence that they have.

When you relinquish influence to merely position, you give up your personal freedom to influence where you are.

Every limiting belief that you have is a transfer of personal freedom, like writing a check to a power broker. You have to decide that you're not going to put yourself under the limits that you and other people put on you.

What else?

Sometimes we become so obsessed about the future, that we lose our right to dictate the present. You cannot change the current situation by gazing into the future. Your have to live in the here and now.

## **Recap**

This is what it means to steward your personal freedom. It means taking charge of your life. It means owning it at a really deep level. It means embracing a fundamental belief that you are responsible for your life, and that nobody else should take that responsibility away from you.

It means living a life that is true to you, and true to what you hold valuable and important. It means refusing to give into anything except what is the absolute best for your life.

## **Respecting the personal freedom of others**

Guarding your personal freedom must never come at the expense of others. You are responsible to protect the freedom of others.

Power is always distorted when it's used to control, not to serve. Every choice that you make must be made with the intention of bettering not only your life, but the lives of those around.

Freedom that takes away from others' freedom isn't freedom at all. It's tyranny.

Personal freedom must be built on the fundamental belief that there is room enough in the world for everyone, that we all truly can succeed, and that none will be cheated by true success.

## **Loss of Control**

One of the worst ways to lose your personal freedom is by trying to control others. When you try to control others, it's like one of those villages spending all his time managing everyone else's money and neglecting his own.

The fundamental cry of needing to control others is that "I am dependent on how other people respond to you, so I need you to act this way." In other words, I will only be happy if you love me, and if I can control you to love me, I will truly be happy.

The funny thing is, this decision to control others is always, at its root, a mismanagement of personal freedom. It's rooted in a lie that says that I need others to act a certain way for me to have personal freedom.

It's not true\!

## **Courage in the Light of Freedom**

We have more choices in the world today than ever before, and people are inundated with pressure to make the right choice.

Every time I buy and smart phone, I have to decide which model, and which edition. I can't even buy an iPhone without comparing the models and seeing which one I need to buy.

People decide their careers with immense possibility. The world has opened up, and we have been flooded with opportunity online.

Young adults hesitate to get married, never knowing if a "more right" individual will show up later.

All of this is rooted in a fundamental fear. We know that every choice that we make, will end up making us. But that is only a partial truth.

Every choice that me make, will end up making us. But it will also open up to us the possibility of making additional choices. You can't decide where to raise your family if you don't have one.

The fundamental fear is rooted in the belief that it is primarily your circumstances that dictate your freedom. And we are unwilling to move into a separate set of circumstances for fear that we will lose our happiness, our passion, our drive, and most importantly, our freedom.

When we realize that we have the capacity to make these choices, we don't need to fear change or transition. We know that we can step into new arenas, and we know that we will be able to choose happiness. We know that within ever situation, we hold the power to choose freedom.

What decisions are you afraid of? What are you holding back from?

You cannot live under the fear of the unknown. Not every decision you make can be a fully informed decision, and you get to determine the risk that you're willing to embrace. The question is, are you willing to surrender your personal freedom to something that you can't see?

## **Freedom in Relationships \- Developing a Capacity for Love**

Your personal relationships reflect your perspective on freedom. Do you have the capacity to love others?

I watch conflict between individuals with great curiosity, because it seems every culture and every individual has a different approach to resolve them. Sometimes, these approaches are driven by broken models they've learned, or driven by emotional pain that they've experienced.

I also watch with curiosity how people response. Some people will resign themselves to not liking other people. They blame their differences on personality, on temperament.

We all know that we cannot control others, but we often resign ourselves to not love the people around us by using certain excuses.

It's so subtle, but when someone else's behavior or temperament is powerful enough to take away your love, you've just surrendered your personal freedom.

You're allowing someone else's actions to dictate and control you.

Just like Nelson Mandela spending years in his prison--his most powerful decision was to forgive his captors. It was unthinkable to the people around him, but it was absolutely critical for him to maintain his personal freedom.

You have the power to choose love in every single situation, and it's up to you whether you will surrender that freedom.
