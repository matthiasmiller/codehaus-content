## **Obstacles Create Value**

When you become discouraged by your journey, it shows a basic expectation that your journey should be easy. It shows an expectation that being able to develop a growing business, have a thriving relationship, or be a skilled communicator should be skills that come easily and naturally to you.

That's because successful people make it look easy. If you look at a great marriage, you discover two people who have learned how to master themselves in order to have a great relationship. If you look at a great business, you discover someone who has taken something from nothing and made it something big.

Because of this, we assume that everything worth having in life is going to be easy. It's simply not true.

Many consumers believe that value determines cost--that something that's worth a lot will cost a lot more. However, savvy business owners know the inverse as well--that cost determines value. You might not give credence to advice that you pay $5 for, but you will give credence to advice that you give $5000 for.

When you give $5000, you will value the advice you receive. It's worth more than the coffee you drink on the way to work and throw in the trash mid-morning.

The obstacles you face are born to instill into you the worth of what you're fighting for and what you're pushing for. Most people are not willing to push through the pain to reach what they want, because they are unsure that it will give them the benefit that they truly desire. They simply don't believe it's worth it.

However, those who push through the challenge and difficulty will begin to embrace the value of what they're pursuing. When you commit yourself to hardship and challenge, you begin to value the things others took for granted.

The best treasures are always the most carefully guarded. As you push towards your goal, your best life, you will encounter challenges and obstacles. You will encounter guards surrounding the prize and the treasure. Although these are never definitive signs, they are clues that you are getting close to the things that matter.

When the going gets so tough that you don't know whether you can take another step, you know your second wind is just around the corner. If you don't know if you can push through to the next level, you know that you're just on the brink of breakthrough. When you feel like you can't give it any more, that's when you're one more shove away from knocking down the wall.

We set off on the pursuit of our dreams, but when we encounter obstacles, rather than tell ourselves that it's not worth it, and there's nothing on the other side. You get to choose whether you will give up now, or whether you will push forward.

## **Obstacles are nothing to Fear**

We have been trained and encouraged to fear difficulty and hardship and failure. Each one of us has been trained in separate ways, and it's up to us to remove the fear from the obstacles that we face.

When we face our obstacles with fear, we immediately assume that the obstacles are bigger than we are. We fear that if we start working past the barrier, we will end up in defeat. We fear that we are not mighty enough to move past the obstacles.

Those who become paralyzed by fear are those who are unwilling to look past the obstacles and look at the greater picture. They are unwilling to look at the things that they are pursuing right now. They are unwilling to look at what they might accomplish if they were to push through the obstacle.

They are unwilling to step back and look at the span of their lives, and see how frequently they have actually overcome obstacles and barriers. If it took them two years of their life to actually develop a basic ability to communicate, why this dread over encountering an obstacle that might take six months or a year to solve?

We are afraid that facing our fears and facing our obstacles will derail us from our true purpose. We are scared that we become so deeply involved in the battle that we will lose sight of the place we will need to go. Meanwhile, we become so consumed by the power of this obstacle in our lives that we have nowhere else to go.

Many times, we hold these obstacles in awe, and we refuse to look at them except at a distance. We are unwilling to get close, to deal with them face to face.

When we fear the obstacles that are in our path, our biggest enemy is no longer the obstacle that we face. Our biggest enemy is our belief about that obstacle--that it is bigger than us, and that we are defeated already.

## **Obstacles Hold Momentum**

Many times, we measure our obstacles by the speed at which we can conquer them, giving no attention to the momentum. You can solve a hundred small problems, but if you solve a single large problem, you can get the same impact. The bigger our obstacles, the bigger the potential for creating momentum in our lives.

Science tells us that inertia is an object's resistance to change its speed. To relate this to the challenges that you face along the way, some of the challenges will not move without a lot of force. You will need to push hard to create that momentum.

Sometimes it means taking small steps, building a running start, and giving it everything that you have to get it to budge from its state of standing still. However, once you can break it lose from the place that it's sitting. You can know that, as long as you can keep it rolling, it will not stop easily.

Your biggest obstacles hold the potential for the greatest momentum.

When our only value is the speed at which we travel, we lose sight of the greatest advantage we might gain. The truth is that we must value not only the speed, but also the momentum that we carry. The more that we can maintain focus on our goal, the more that we can develop a momentum that will carry us into the future.

This perspective will keep you from becoming discouraged when you don't see visible results for the things that you're trying to accomplish. You see the value that it will create for you.

This is also exactly the reason why certain individuals move away from teams. They would rather travel alone, because they know that they can go faster. However, they cannot always go further. By definition, one person alone cannot create the same momentum as a team of people.

These individualistic people would rather travel alone than take the time to persuade groups of people. They would rather live disengaged from others than to create a movement.

The real world changers are those who are willing to stand up, work in community, develop momentum, and have the patience and endurance to shift the direction of culture. For some, this means giving their lives for a cause that the world does not yet believe in.

## **Finding the Courage**

The courage that you need to keep moving forward in the face of difficulty is born from a deep, internal belief: "The challenges I face today will move me forward." It is rooted in a deep belief that the things that you are pursuing are truly worth it, that your life truly will make a difference.

The secret to finding courage is about changing your mindset about the obstacles you face. We sometimes assume that fear is a feeling, an emotion, and that it's something that we cannot control. But most fear is usually not that.

Most fear is born in a fundamental belief. It is about a perspective or a mindset that you have about the solution that you face. As long as you can relegate fear to an uncontrollable emotion, you will live captive to it. But if you can recognize the truth within the situation that you will face, you can dismantle the power of fear and move into the courage that you need.

Finding true courage means finding true humility. It means stepping past your own ability to be right--to give up your own assessment of yourself, your potential and the problems that you face. It means looking for other people who have gone before you, looking for friends who are around you, who are willing to give you the raw truth.

You must know that you are more powerful than you realize. You recognize that you have greater capacity than you know. You must recognize that you have greater ability than you had thought.

You must have the humility to admit, that your own assessment of yourself and your own assessment of the problems you face were not accurate at all. That you were wrong in defining them as something to be feared. You must be willing to admit that you have allowed these false beliefs to dictate how you live.

You must surrender them, and exchange them for the truth.

You must be willing to embrace it, not a week or a year at a time, but for a single day and sometimes for a single moment. You must live in that reality right now.

Do not be afraid. Do not worry. Do not be anxious.

## **Do Not Fear**

Above all, do not fear.

When you're in the middle of a conflict and you don't know if you have the power to resolve the conflict, do not fear.

When you're facing a challenging business situation and you cannot find the answer for a critical problem that you're facing, do not fear.

When you're on the brink of financial disaster and you're not sure how you're going to make the next payment, do not fear.

When everything inside of you wants to turn and run from the greatness that was instilled in you, do not fear.

When you are tired of facing the crowds, when you grow weary of being an agent of change, when you are tired of challenging the status quo, do not fear.

When you feel lost and directionless, when you don't know where to go and how to keep on moving, do not fear.

When you doctor has given you a prognosis that weighs heavy on you, or when your loved one is suffering do not fear.

Know that in every one of these situations, these do not need to be the end, but they can be merely the beginning. Know that every single piece of your life that looks the worst mess can become the greatest tapestry you've ever imagined. Know that when everything seems to get as you though possible, and even then takes a turn for the worst, a new pathway will arise.

Know that gold is purified in the fire of trial. Know that diamonds are formed in the pressures of life. Know that you were put on this earth for a reason, and the greatest treasures are often hidden behind the strongest walls.

Know that you were born to shape history. You were born to be a world-changer. The challenges of life stand in defiance to you, daring you to believe that you are meant for nothing more than a simple, meaningless existence. They are daring you to believe that it's possible for everyone to succeed but you.

But no matter what, do not fear.

Know that the challenges you face are invitations into something greater--that no matter what the outcome looks like today, that these situations can become the greatest gain in life. Know that these obstacles are sometimes overcome through the simple daily choice to keep moving forward, to keep taking one more step. On some days, that is all the courage you can muster, but it's all the courage you need.
