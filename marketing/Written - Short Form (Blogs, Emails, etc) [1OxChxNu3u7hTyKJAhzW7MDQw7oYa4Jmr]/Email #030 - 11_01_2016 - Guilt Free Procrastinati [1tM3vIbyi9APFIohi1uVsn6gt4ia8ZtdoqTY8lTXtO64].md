Do you ever struggle to follow through on projects? 

Many of us do. I certainly am no exception.

For example, I have a quickstart personality with low follow-through. This means I’m a visionary. I have many “great” ideas that I usually just act on and figure out *as I go*. Who has time for research?

However, because of this, I will often end up letting go of many ideas in the process because I discover they are not worth finishing.

Thus, I have many “unfinished projects.” Things I started moons ago and still haven’t finished.

Unfortunately, I’ve often scolded myself for not following through. I feel like I am somehow less mature than other leaders because I have all these unfinished projects.

Our culture lives under the mentality that mature, disciplined people finish what they start. Whether it’s a sale, a project, or simply reading a book, great leaders follow through.

This sounds right, doesn’t it?

While self-discipline certainly marks good character, following-through does not necessarily mark self-discipline.

The “Quickstart” and “Follow Through” traits are related to personality, not character. They reflect different learning and executing patterns, not self-control. They each bring to the table both positive and negative propensities, but are not of themselves reflective of character.

So next time you didn’t follow through on a project or finish a book, instead of beating yourself up for not being more disciplined, ask yourself “Will finishing this project benefit my company? By not finishing it, will I hurt anyone?”

If the answer is “Yes,” definitely finish the project\! But if it is “No,” why continue wasting your precious time and energy trying to finish that project, book, or whatever it may be just for the sake of “finishing what you start”?

Let it go guilt-free.

And as always...

Be the Best You\!

**Self-Control** (popped into my(Chris’) head as I was going through Email Ideas)

“Like a city whose walls are broken through is a person who lacks self-control.” \- Proverbs 25:28

Matthias: BTW, love this. I think we should integrate the whole guilt thing into here, as well. “If you’re mature, you’re systematic and follow through.”

Here's something else that you can add to that email we were talking about. Most of us believe that self-control and discipline are also connected to the strong follow through.

# **1\. Follow through**

Often being following through is equated with maturity.
