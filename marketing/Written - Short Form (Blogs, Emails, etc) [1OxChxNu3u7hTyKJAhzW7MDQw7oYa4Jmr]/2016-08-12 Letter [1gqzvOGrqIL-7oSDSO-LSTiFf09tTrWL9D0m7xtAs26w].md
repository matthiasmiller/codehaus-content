Have you ever had a vacation that hit a major “reset” button in your life?

That happened to me this year. Yes, it’s the same vacation I wrote about last month.

In Nebraska, corn is more profitable than cell phone towers. Despite having no cell phone service, I habitually reached into my pocket for my phone. I was shocked to be so tied to my texts, emails, Facebook, and other mindless minutiae.

When I returned home, I resolved to change. I chose to read books instead of Facebook, journal with pen and paper instead of a keyboard, and wake up to an old-fashioned alarm clock instead of a device filled with distractions.

More than a month later, I’ve stuck to my resolve. While I expected some clarity and peace of mind, I greatly underestimated the benefit, not only for me, but for my business too.

How much are your distractions and lack of clarity are costing you? Whatever it takes, reclaim your focus. The clarity is liberating, and I promise you won’t regret it.
