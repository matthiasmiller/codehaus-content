# **The Fast Track to** **Getting Free from Shame**

**Q:	What’s this “fast track” to getting free from shame and self-sabotaging beliefs?**

The fastest way to get free from shame and self-sabotaging beliefs is to hear directly from Jesus Himself. I’ve experienced tremendous breakthrough using the Sozo prayer ministry, a ministry originating from Bethel Church in Redding, CA.

**Q:	What is Sozo?**

Sozo is simply a “facilitated dialogue” with Jesus Christ, the person who knows everything about you. It focuses on asking Jesus to identify lies and reveal truth to you. When Jesus Himself reveals truth, there’s a “rewiring” that happens that I haven’t found with any other method.

Sozo also incorporates forgiveness, allowing you to find freedom from the people who’ve wronged you.

**Q:	What if I don’t believe in Jesus?**

You don’t have to believe in Jesus for Him to speak to you or for you to benefit from a Sozo session.

Certain Sozo facilitators are specifically trained to work with individuals who do not profess faith in Christ. These specific facilitators will not twist your arm try to get you to pray a “prayer of repentance” or “profess Christ”.

Scripture has multiple examples of God speaking to people who didn’t believe in Him. For example, God gave Nebuchadnezzar dreams that Joseph interpreted. Saul had a vision of Jesus even though he vehemently denied Jesus’ deity.

**Q:	How long are these sessions?**

Sessions typically range from 90 minutes to 2 hours.

**Q:	How much does it cost?**

Fees range from $75 to several hundred dollars.

**Q:	How do I get started?**

If you want to focus on issues surrounding your business, I encourage you to find a facilitator specifically trained in Financial Sozo.

The following facilitators are available for Skype sessions. They are specifically trained to work with Christians and non-Christians alike. As mentioned, they will respect your spiritual boundaries.

**Q:	Do you earn some kind of commission?**

No.

**Q:	Isn’t Bethel Church some kind of cult group?**

Bethel has been accused of denying the deity of Christ. However, this is simply not true. Senior pastor Bill Johnson has made it very clear that Jesus Christ is God. However, he emphasizes that Jesus did His miracles through the power of the Holy Spirit, not merely because He is God. This is something Jesus Himself affirmed when defending Himself to the Pharisees. Unfortunately, some people have taken this to mean that Bethel Church denies the deity of Jesus.

I’m not looking to defend every leader, member, or teaching of Bethel Church. I simply believe they have something unique to offer with their Sozo ministry.

**Q:	I’ve had really negative experiences with other people, and this scares me.**

I’m sorry that you’ve had negative experiences, and I’m sure it was hurtful to be disappointed by people you looked up to and respected.

A church of any size will have people who misrepresent it (or more importantly, misrepresent Christ). You need to decide the right thing for you to do based on your personal convictions and the direction of your spiritual leadership.

**Q:	I still feel really uneasy about this.**

You don’t need to feel obligated to pursue this.

If you can’t pursue it in good faith, just set it aside and focus on building your relationship with Christ. Trust the Holy Spirit to lead you into all truth.

**Q:	I thought you were a reasonable guy, and you’ve really let me down.** 

I don’t expect everyone to agree with me, and I understand why you might disagree. If you have honest questions, I’m happy to chat (see below).

If you’d rather not stay in touch, feel free to unsubscribe from *The Multiplier*. If you’d rather not raise the issue with me, feel free to email [heidi@multiplyyourstrengths.com](mailto:heidi@multiplyyourstrengths.com) to be removed.

**Q:	Can I contact you if I have questions?**

Yes, I’m happy to discuss questions you might have.

Please note, however: I’ve found that theological debates aren’t usually helpful because they simply reinforce what we already believe. I have no desire to become confrontational or combative. I’ve tried it before in my life, and it’s never yielded good fruit. If that’s your approach, I’ll ask you to resume the discussion when you’re in a better place.

Please don’t let that discourage you from asking questions, however. You can email me at [matt@multiplyyourstrengths.com](mailto:matt@multiplyyourstrengths.com), and we can set up a time to discuss it further.
