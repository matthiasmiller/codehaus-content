# **Unsung Heroes and the Myths of the Heart-Centered Leader**

Over the past few months, I've noticed a trend.

Only, it's not a trend. It's a reality that's been happening for a very long time. Trouble is, the recent events have brought it to surface.

Before I dive into this trend, I need to ask your permission.

It's possible this issue will challenge you. It's possible it will make you uncomfortable. It's possible it will leave you in tears. It's possible that it will cause you to breathe a sigh of relief.

No matter which way you respond, it's imperative that you only read this having granted me permission to speak into an issue that's threatening a lot of leaders and organizations.

Fair enough?

Well, then...let's get started.

## **The Most Heart-Centered Man I've Ever Met**

Nearly a year and a half ago, I began coaching with one of the most heart-centered individuals I've ever met. I didn't meet with him for any specific outcomes. However, I knew he had something that I both wanted and needed, and that was enough to begin the coaching engagement.

The change began subtly. However, as I began to get to know him, I began to change how I viewed and approached other people. I began (quite slowly) to catch his deep heart-centered approach to interacting with other people. I began to peel back the layers that had held me back from fully embracing heart-centered leadership.

At the same time, I became more aware of my previous task-focused, pragmatic outlook on life. As I reflected on all the projects I'd been involved with, I suddenly began to realize that none of the projects were ever about the outcome.

They were always about the people who were involved with them.

The projects were only the starting point to engage with them, to influence them, to support them, and to help them move forward.

This countered my core belief that achievement was paramount. I began to realize that truly, people were my purpose.

I began making a shift in how I related with people. I discovered that many times, people's hearts were buried under layers of "good things". Interests, agendas, aspirations, activities, and more.

However, if I continued to probe, continued to dig, I'd see their heart begin to surface. The pretense disappeared, and I’d start to see their true self.

I also began to give myself permission to be myself. I let go of many of the "shoulds" of how to show up in my leadership or in life. I began to surrender obligations to appear as a certain type of individual. I had to confront the demons that protested it.

When I finally posted on Facebook, I was surprised by the results.

## **The Facebook Post I Could Not Have Predicted**

I had just finished a 2-part intensive on "Finding Your Superpower". One of the homework assignments was to post on Facebook, "What would you say I'm really good at?"

Many of the answers were exactly what I expected to hear. However, then I started getting results that I was not prepared for.

* "Loving people and seeing them in light of their true potential."

* "Making the people around you feel loved and heard."

* "Prioritizing relationships and what is important to you"

* "Loving people and drawing out the best in them."

* "Listening to people’s hearts and not just they're words when they're having a conversation with you."

* "Loving people\!\!\! Supporting them, and helping them accomplish their Mt. Everest, and encouraging them to believe\!\!\!"

Previously when I had asked this question, NONE of these answers had shown up on the list. These were BRAND NEW answers to this question.

(If you're wondering about me getting to the point, just hang on.)

This caused me to double-down on this. I realized it really WAS a superpower. And as I began to double down, I noticed certain people starting to be drawn to me...people that I had never expected.

## **Catapulted into the World of Heart-Centered Individuals**

The more that I began to listen to people and care for them, the more I discovered heart-centered individuals coming to me for advice.

Some had challenges interacting with their supervisors. Others were burned out and needed to recharge. Others needed help sorting through interpersonal conflict in their lives.

I didn't try to seek them out. I didn't try to hunt them down. I didn't try to go digging deeply.

I engaged with their hearts. I listened to them. And they came.

Unexpectedly.

And that's when I had to confront four powerful stigmas.

## **“If You Listen to Their Hearts, You'll Get Their Garbage”**

The first stigma is this: if you listen to people's hearts, you're just helping them vent in an unhealthy way.

Not true.

I've found that sometimes as leaders, we want two things:

1. We want people to talk directly to us about problems.

2. We don't want them to bring their whole hearts to the conversation.

You must choose one or the other. You can't have both.

As a leader, I have intentionally heard (and disregarded) strong input from one of my team members for a few months. Because of the level of trust I had cultivated as a leader, I knew that I could momentarily disregard his input. However, I knew I could not continue that indefinitely without destroying the trust that I had built. By no stretch of the imagination would ignoring feedback from the team be a sustainable long-term leadership model.

Imagine what would have happened if I had not been willing to at least lend a listening ear to my team member and consider their perspective. This disagreement was strong enough that it would have created significant tension, and I would not be surprised if my team member would have found someone else to talk to.

As long as I am willing to completely own the outcome of my decision, continue open discussion about the situation, and  allow continued input on other matters, this should do nothing but further deepen the trust I have with this team member.

Which do you want?

Do you want candid feedback?

Do you want to find out when things don't go well?

Are you willing to be TRULY teachable and humble, allow others to identify blind spots, and use it as an opportunity for growth?

Listening to people's hearts will do one of two things:

1. It will give you the opportunity to help them experience more wholeness, allowing them to show up with their full self to their job.

2. It will allow you the opportunity for growth by taking ownership of how your actions impact others.

And this leads us to our second stigma.

## **“If You Listen to Their Hearts, You'll End Up Babysitting Them”**

Let's break this one down, as well.

The premise behind this is that connecting to people's hearts is disempowering, and this is simply NOT true. I'll explain this more in-depth in just a moment. However, it's important to recognize something.

Ignoring issues does NOT make them go away. Instead, they linger beneath the surface, and begin to bubble up (and sometimes appear as a volcanic eruption) in other areas.

These areas can be disengagement, interpersonal conflict, poor performance, and more.

It is MUCH better to address these issues immediately. When you as a leader are emotionally healthy, you are able to coach your team members through challenging situations. As a result, you build more emotionally intelligent, resilient team members.

We want the outcome. We want healthy, secure, engaged team members. Are we ready to pay the price?

## **“If You Listen To Their Hearts, You're Encouraging Them to Stay Stuck”**

The third stigma with heart-centered leadership is this: "If you talk about a problem without a solution, your talk is useless."

I get it. I like to drive things towards action. I like them to be practical. I like things to move forward.

However, the purpose of listening to people's hearts is NOT to fix them or to somehow repair them. It's to give them the safe place to be completely themselves, in all of their brokenness, mess, and beauty. And in that place of transparency and vulnerability, we have the opportunity to demonstrate love and value for them. And that belief, validation, encouragement, and love is the force that empowers them to rise up in challenging situations and address the issue.

Furthermore, it's important to understand the power of timing.

Over the past few months, one of my mentors has continually challenged me on the issue of timing. I've realized that this is another task-driven mindset that I've had to unlearn so that I can embrace the power of perfect timing.

If you're familiar with the Scriptures, you may have heard the phrase "the fullness of time". I've come to understand that this is simply the time "when the stage is set, everything is ready, and all things have finally come together".

We would never take a walk through an orchard, pick an apple before it's ripe, and expect good fruit from the outcome. As leaders, when we push things forward to completion before it's time, we do exactly the same thing. Driving a situation to resolution before the stage has been set, before the things have come together, will yield a sour taste that leaves indigestion in your organization.

You can approach timing from an entirely different perspective as well. The one thing that keeps most of us from acting on our instincts is this: our internal editor. It says things like, "It needs to be done now. If I don't do it, nobody will. I must fix it before I forget it. If we don't fix it now, it will fester." All of those things MAY be true--however, all of those things may be false. I've found that being aware of my instincts has significantly improved the quality of my decisions. Learning to disengage my editor has significantly improved the quality of my actions.

Heart-centered leadership demands that you engage with individuals, allowing them to process situations and come to a healthy place, even when the situation cannot change.

I make no pretense of doing this with excellence. I only know that it's something that I've been growing in, and will continue to grow in.

This is NOT disempowering or enabling people's victim thinking. It is helping our team members gain the tools they need to walk with a healthy heart. It is empowering them to walk free in the midst of challenging situations.

## **“If You Listen To Their Hearts, You'll Compromise Outcomes”**

It's easy to see heart-centered leadership as contrary to the path to success. Many people have portrayed success through grit, hustle, goal-setting, and obsession. And while resilience and determination are key, they must not come at the expense of heart-centered leadership. In fact, we're seeing the rebound of this kind of thinking with the up-tick in what we call "soft skills" training.

You must decide the culture you want at your organization.

You can have an organization that is primarily analytical, cutthroat, and achievement-driven.

Or you can have an organization that is heart-based, passionate, and loyal.

If you're leading a heart-based, passion-driven group of individuals who care deeply about the work they're doing, I dare say that heart-centered leadership is non-negotiable.

So what's the value?

## **The Value Proposition of Heart-Centered Leadership**

We've addressed the stigmas. However, what are the VALUES of heart-centered leadership?

If you are a heart-centered leader, you will begin to attract individuals who are like you. These individuals will be:

* Deeply committed to the cause

* Intensely loyal to the organization and team

* Highly empathic with the people you serve

* Sacrificial with their level of service

* Passionate about the work that they do

Is it possible for these individuals to have blind spots? Absolutely\! As with all of us\!

However, few people will commit their self and their loyalty as deeply to an organization as heart-centered individuals.

Remember the trend I mentioned at the beginning?

## **The Unfortunate Trend of Heart-Centered Team Members**

Over the past month, I've interacted with dozens of heart-centered individuals. Many of them have been deeply affected by the events in the world. Many of them are in situations where their job is in limbo, or they've experienced an unusually high level of pressure. Many of them are carrying levels of responsibility that no ordinary person would ever say "yes" to.

More than ever, these individuals are feeling exposed, unsupported, and isolated.

These very individuals are most likely to sacrifice themselves for the outcome of your organization.

They are so loyal, in fact, that they will often sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of others.

They are the glue that brings cohesion to the team. They are the backbone that will carry your organization for years into the future.

Yes, they are resilient. However, it's up to us as leaders to not take advantage of their commitment, loyalty, and drive. It's up to us to provide them with the support they need during this time.

And as I looked back over my conversations, I realized that this wasn't just a trend.

## **Celebrating the Unsung Heroes**

I realized that these individuals had been there all along. I realized that I had been one of them far longer than I ever had realized.

I realized that I had been surrounded by those individuals, and many of them had contributed deeply to my life. For years, I never recognized them.

I realized that all around me, many of them have been slowly bleeding out--the toll of their sacrifice costing them their vitality.

I realized that the trend I was seeing was NOT an uptick in heart-centered individuals. The only trend I was truly seeing was that these individuals were experiencing far more pressure and far less support than ever before.

I think it's time for this to change.

If we as leaders want to build a dream team, these are the individuals that will carry us into the future. However, it's up to US to build the environment where they will thrive and flourish. It's up to us to create the protection they need to thrive and flourish.

I think it's time for us to rise up, to defend every heart-centered individual. I believe it's time to advocate for definitions of success that do not demand cutthroat achievement. I believe it's time for us to create work environments that allow people to prosper, not relying merely on benefits or work-life balance training to compensate for a lack of support.

This requires effort. It requires sacrifice. It requires intentionality.

It requires all of us to do this together.

I've crossed the line, and I can't go back.

My life is no longer purely about achievement.

My life is about the transformation I can create in people's lives.

Will you cross the line to join me?
