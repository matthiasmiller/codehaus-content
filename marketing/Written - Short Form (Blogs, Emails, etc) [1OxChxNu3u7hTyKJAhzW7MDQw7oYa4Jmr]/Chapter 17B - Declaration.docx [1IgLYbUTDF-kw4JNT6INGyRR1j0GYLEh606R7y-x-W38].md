## **Born for the Expanse**

You were born for the expanse, born to explore the world that you were placed in. You were born for something much, much bigger than the tiny world you were locked in yesterday.

The tiny world you've lived in is only big enough for one person to succeed. Someone else's promotion became your demotion, and their demotion became your promotion. You could not build wealth without robbing the poor, and you could not achieve success without breaking another.

You were not born for a world so small.

You were born to live in a world where your success empowered others to greater success, where another's promotion only creates more opportunity to win. You were born to live in a world where wealth only created more wealth, and the poor were not exploited or deceived. They were empowered to become better because of the opportunities that others created for the.

The tiny world you lived in was only big enough to live one day at a time, only big enough to meet the obligations you held from day to the next. It was only big enough to expect what you've always expected, to encounter what you've always encountered. It was only big enough for the things that you've seen. If it happened to you once, it could maybe happen again. If it happened to your friend, it was still a distant possibility. But if it hadn't happened to anyone you knew, it would never happen to you.

You were not born for a world so small. But you were born to live in a world where your dreams are possible. You were born for a world that's big enough for impossibilities to happen, for the unexpected to become normal. You were born for a world that allowed you to step into the unknown, imagine things you haven't seen, and embrace them not as a fairy tale but as a tangible possibility.

The tiny world you lived in was only big enough for the way things were always. It was governed by the rules of the status quo, the same mantra, "Follow the rules we followed in the past, and in time, the system will serve you." That world was never bigger than that system. It was never big enough to question the mantras of the day.

You were not born for a world that small. You were born for a world that invites change, that breaks free from the mundane, that always questions for a better way. You were born for a world that allows you to choose an unconventional path to success, blazing a trail where no one else has blazed.

## **Born to be a Rule Breaker**

You were born to be a rule breaker. This is not the rebellious, destructive rebel who tears down others and destroys lives. This is the rebel who refuses to think the way everyone else has always thought and acted.

You were born to think outside the box, to live an unusual life, because if you will be truly yourself, your life will deviate from the paths that others take. You were born to bring change, sometimes in subtle, quiet ways. And at times, you must bring loud, disruptive change. But it is in your heart to leave this world a better.

You were born not to criticize and destroy the old way of thinking. You were born to innovate and improve upon. You will not mindlessly discard all that we have learned, but neither will you unquestioningly hold on the things that have lost their significance and purpose.

Your will not live for other people's comfort. You will live to serve them, realizing that the best service you can do to some is to rattle them out of their own comfort. You will do this with love and care, but rattle them you must, giving them their own opportunity to choose what they will do with their lives.

You will be a rule breaker. Some will love you, and some will hate you. Some will mock you, but nobody will be able to ignore you. You will drive others to a decision point, determining for themselves their own convictions. You will force them to a decision, knowing that they cannot stand on the fence any longer.

You will face this tension with courage and maturity, knowing that while you must never needlessly create enemies, it is sometimes inevitable. You will give others the freedom to choose their response, and you will choose the upper road in every way.

## **Born for Integrity**

You will live with utmost integrity. You will not allow yourself to be drawn into silly business deals or silly relationships that will compromise everything that you are and will become.

You will question everything except the unchanging principles that allows the world to live as it should and must. You will not compromise your personal integrity, nor will you sacrifice it for momentary pleasure or gain.

You will live your life with utmost integrity and honesty, knowing that you have one person you will always have to live with, and that person is you. You know that the greatest sacrifice you can make is one that makes it impossible for you to live with yourself.

You will sacrifice your personal preferences and desires, allowing yourself to live for something that is bigger than yourself. You refuse to make yourself king of everything, knowing that in great power comes the great delusion that we are invincible. You will choose to become, rather, a servant king, who allows others to become greater than you yourself. You will not lower yourself by serving yourself, but you will live for greatness by passing it on to others.

By living as a servant, you will say "no" to the things that will destroy the lives of the people who are closest to you. You will live with the conviction that you were entrusted, first of all, to influence the lives of the people who are closest to you. When you are tempted to sacrifice them to change the world, you will remember that theirs is the world you must change first.

## **Born to Be Free**

In everything you do, you refuse to become a slave. You choose to live free, knowing that in every situation, you get to determine how you respond. You determine to choose your thoughts and your attitude, knowing that your thoughts will drive your emotions, and your attitude determines your response.

You will not allow yourself to be crushed in defeat, or to pity yourself because of a loss. You will embrace the challenge, but remember in it all, that you were born to be free. No one can take that freedom from you.

You will remember the crowds who chant the mantra of "freedom" and unwittingly become enslaved to the things they believe to be freeing. You refuse to be mastered by anything, even in the name of freedom. You refuse to use your freedom as an excuse to become encumbered and enslaved.

You will use your freedom to serve in the best possible way. You will take care that you steward your freedom to allow your influence to grow, and you will steward your freedom to protect the ones that matter the most to you.

You will inspire others to live free. You will remind them of their choice and of their freedom to choose consequence. You will not ignore the consequences of choice. Rather, you will recognize its reality. You will empower others to see beyond their momentary freedom and see the consequences of the decisions they make today.

You will live, not to be free for a moment, but to be free for a lifetime. You will live, not for your personal freedom, but for the freedom of your children and grandchildren. You will live for a legacy of free men and women, able to live to their complete and full potential.

## **You Must Die Before You Live**

You are ready for a life that is far grander than what you've ever imagined possible, but between you and it is a great chasm. You must embrace the death to reach the life that lies on the other side.

You must die to the old ways of thinking and living. They will not serve you as you step into your future. As you surrender these ways of thinking and living, it may feel like someone is taking a sword and stabbing you in the heart. You may have a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, because you've become so comfortable living for other people's expectations.

You must die to the old person you were. Other people will continue perceive you as the person you've always been. Some will wake up to the change in you, but others will always remember you for the person you've been. They will remember you for all your faults, your weaknesses, your incapability. You must refuse to defend yourself who you were. You must allow that identity to become fully dead.

You must die to the dreams you've embraced. Some of them were never your dreams at all. Some of them were the dreams of your brothers, your sisters, your parents, or your friends. Some of them were dreams that you've convinced yourself to embrace, as if somehow they would bring you success if you only embraced them. Some of them feel so real and true to yourself that you cannot recognize how deeply you've convinced yourself. These must die to make room for your true, deeper dreams. Yes, even the ones that are true to yourself must die, because unless they die, you will never be able to embrace them in the grandeur and expanse they were meant to be.

You must die to the life of living small, and you must choose to live life bigger than you've lived before. You must choose to expand your way of thinking, and believe that much more is possible with your life than you imagined. You must not leave it happenstance. You must allow the possibility to happen.

You must die to the posture of an observer. You will no longer merely watch with awe as you see others changing the world and making a difference. The observer within you must die before you can live as a world changer. You were not meant to merely watch the game. You were meant to be in it and play it.

This is a horrible, bloody process. It is painful, and sometimes filled with tears. But it is a process you must choose to embrace. It is the process of transformation, and it is the only path to become all that you can and will become.

Although it seems like a horrible death, it is a small sacrifice for the grandeur that awaits you. Like a caterpillar going through metamorphosis, you are saying goodbye to the one who crawled from one place to the next, looking for food. You are saying goodbye to so much of the many different things that felt familiar and true to yourself. But in exchange, you are receiving wings to fly. You are no longer constrained to the places your feet can carry you, but you are empowered to become so much more than you ever hoped or imagined.

This is the choice you've determined to make, and this is the choice that will give you the strength to pursue your dreams when everything turns against you. It is the strength that allows you to overcome difficulty, to look hardship in the face and command it to bow to your vision.

This is the journey that every successful man or woman has had to take. It is the path to life that is fully engaged, fully empowered, and fully maximizes who you were born to become.

You carry something that no one else has. For the sake of the world that is waiting to be changed, go out and live that life boldly.
