# **Chapter: Values**

When you move into a new territory, one of the most critical pieces is knowing to find the things that are the unchangeable in your life. These pieces can become the instruments in your life when life becomes unclear. This is one of the keys in navigating transition.

If you've already moved into a transition, you're already biased because of the situation that you're in, and you have to recognize that. It's easy to rationalize your choices because of the situation you're in. If you're not facing a transition right now, you're in one of the best positions to take a close look at these issues, because you're able to clearly define who you are and who you want to be without the distraction of the pressures around you.

As you move into a new situation, many people weigh out the pros and cons of the places they're going. They consider whether they can afford the cost of the new house they're buying. If they're moving, they consider whether they can find a job that matches their skills and pays the bills. Everyone looks at lots of different factors to determine their next step, but many of them unwittingly overlook some of the most important factors, because they don't take the time to dig below the surface.

If you ask someone if they love what they do at work, they'll nod their heads, and say, "I love what I do\!" Although it's important that your job suits your abilities, it may not be the most important factor in job satisfaction.

The DeGarmo Group has an online assessment called the Matched Values Profile, which measures how well employee and organization values align. People who passed this MVP (i.e. their values aligned with the organization's values) were 50% more likely to report high levels of job satisfaction than people who failed. Meanwhile, participants whose values didn't align were more than twice as likely to report low levels of commitment to the organization.

If values are so important to job satisfaction, why do so many people ignore this when searching for work?

The truth of the matter is that many people are unaware of their true values. They don't know what they are, much less what they are for themselves. Or they might be somewhat aware, but they've never taken the time to work through them for themselves.

## **What are values?**

Your values are the unchanging priorities that you hold.

When someone asks me what is important to me, I might tell them "reading". However, this answers very little. If they probe, they'll ask, "Fiction or non-fiction?" I'll answer, "Non-fiction." If they probe further, they can discover the specific kind of books I like to read.

After a while, we can find a common interest, and we are able to connect on a common interest. For many people, this is the primary basis of friendship and connection. This is what makes some conversations interesting.

However, this does not guarantee that we have the same values. Two individuals may be reading books on business for entirely different reasons, and even though they are reading through the same books and covering the same material, and even though they are able to discuss the same ideas, they might not experience the same connection.

Why?

In short, the things that you enjoy and are interested in are a reflection of something deeper: your values. Your values are something that you hold in your heart, things that are so important to you that no matter what situation you are in, you will prioritize them. And if you ever find yourself in a situation where you are forced to compromise them, you will find yourself in inner conflict.

For example, feeding the homeless is not a value, because it's not something that you hold in your heart. It's something that you do. Feeding the homeless reflects a deeper value--"caring for the less fortunate." You cannot feed the hungry in every situation, but you can demonstrate your value of caring for those who are less fortunate.

As another example, going to your son's softball games isn't a value, because it's not something that you hold in your heart. Again, it's something you do. The underlying values might be something along the lines of family, presence, or friendship--depending on the reason that's compelling you to go. Those values can be demonstrated in a number of different values, and if for some reason, you're not able to show up for your son's game, you can be sure that you'll find another way to demonstrate that value in a different way.

## **Why People are Conflicted**

Many people are conflicted because they make decisions that don't align with their values. They decide to work a certain job, or they sign up for a specific program. Once they commit to it, they realize that the organization or program's values are not their own.

These value differences aren't necessarily wrong. However, because they're different, they create this tension and difference. For example, you might volunteer at a non-profit whose values including being supportive, while you have a much higher value for challenging. They want to be present, be encouraging, and walk alongside. You want more than a friendship--you want to teach them the tools that they need, and dare them to live bigger lives. Even though both of these approaches are completely legitimate, you will find yourself in conflict because they don't align.

If you're unfulfilled at work, you might be unwittingly bumping up against a values conflict. Your boss has expectations based on his values that don't align with your own values. You want to do your work for efficiency, and he wants to do his work for excellence. Neither of these values is intrinsically wrong, but these differences will create conflict.

Two of my biggest personal values are empowerment and personal growth. Only in retrospect did I realize that I quit my two prior jobs because they stopped giving me the opportunity to learn and grow. Of course, the reasons I gave my bosses were completely different--because I myself didn't know the true reason why I had done this.

## **Practiced or Professed Values**

The values that you hold can either be values that you profess or values that you practice. Maybe you've ever been on a call with a company, and while you're waiting on hold for hours, you hear the recorded message, "Your call is very important to us." When they answer the phone, you speak with a stress-out agent who just had to work with a dozen really difficult customers, and he's so frazzled he can't give you the time of day.

That's the difference between professed values and practiced values.

Many of us hold great pride in professed values. We consider ourselves to be loving, kind, patience, up building people. But when we actually measure ourselves against what we profess, we find situations that either match this or contract it. You dare not separate your actual behavior from the values that you hold.

If you find yourself in conflict, you know that you do hold this value, but you're frustrated because you're not practicing it. However, if you are able to profess that value without practicing it, and still don't feel any conflict, you're creating an illusion of who you are. Ultimately, you begin deceiving yourself, causing yourself to believe you're someone whom you're not.

You have three ways to avoid values conflict, ranging from helpful to harmful:

1. You can adapt your actions to align with your values.

2. You can change your values to match your actions.

3. You can deceive yourself into believing the differences don't exist.

Ignoring the conflict is not a good way to handle it--it's a coping mechanism at best. However, at worst, you drift further and further until you no longer remember who you truly are and what is truly important to you.

If you choose to change your values, be aware that these will become your new standard for living life, and consider the implications. Some shifts in values are critical for living a more effective, more fulfilled live, whereas other values will have implications that might cause you to compromise other values.

The more that you numb yourself to these differences, the further you will drift. And the further you drift, the more painful the wakeup call will be. It's up to you whether you want to rip the Band-Aid off today, and be able to heal and bring change to your life, or whether you want to wait until you're at the end of your life, reflecting why you feel unfulfilled or dissatisfied with where you ware.

You must embrace the conflict, because the conflict will point you exactly where to go. It will keep you from shoving these differences aside, and it will move you into the right direction.

## **Determining your Personal Values**

It's important for you to determine your personal values. The question, then, is how to determine them. However, we cannot ask these questions without distinguishing between the professed and the practiced values. Because we are most familiar with whom we want to be, let's start there.

What are ten values that you hold in your heart that are important to you?

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

---

From the list above, what are the five things that, no matter the financial pressure you are under, you would be unwilling to give up?

---

---

---

---

---

Refining that list even further, what are three things that are so important to you, that even if you had to die, you would refuse to surrender from your heart?

---

---

---

Those are your professed values. Those are the ones that you believe to be most important to you.

Step right now, and go back. For every single value, ask yourself this question:

"Do my actions reflect this question?"

Evaluate the answer on a scale from 1 (never) to 10 (always). Do it now--don't jump ahead\!

Now, review your list. Where are the places where your actions do not align with your values?

These are places where you're mostly likely have an illusionary perspective of yourself. These are the places where you've convinced yourself you should be something that you're not.

## **Closing the Gap**

Sometimes we live under imposed values, and we never fully embrace them. We might model someone else's values, and because we respect them, we'll try to embrace them. But it will not be our own. Sometimes the values you profess are not values that are truly important to you--they are values that the culture or people around you have pressured you to embrace. However, because they're imposed values, they have very little power over you.

You have two ways to close the gap.

The first one, if this truly is an imposed value, is simply recognizing it as such, and recognizing that it's not a value that you truly hold. Simply recognizing that this is an imposed value and take the pressure off and allow you to look objectively.

Secondly, ask yourself if this is a value that should be embracing. You do have the ability to reshape and remold your heart, and you can choose to embrace new values. If these are values that you profess, simple ask yourself, "What actions do I need to take to integrate these values?"

Name three simple steps that you can take:

By continually seeking to integrate these values into your life, you'll find yourself developing an ownership of them and embracing them as your own.
