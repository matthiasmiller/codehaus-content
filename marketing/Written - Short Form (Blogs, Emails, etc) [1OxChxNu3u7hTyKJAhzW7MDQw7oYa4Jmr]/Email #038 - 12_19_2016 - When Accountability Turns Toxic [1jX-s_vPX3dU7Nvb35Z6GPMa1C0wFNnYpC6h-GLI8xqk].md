Accountability is essential to leadership and teamwork. Without accountability, we are left alone to struggle with our shortcomings and our whole team suffers for it. With accountability, our team is free to move forward. 

However, since accountability has too often been a method for control, we tend to react negatively to the idea.

Why does it turn sour and how can we redeem it?

I've noticed two reasons accountability becomes toxic.

1. Accountability becomes toxic when people aren't foremost accountable to themselves. Accountability with others is always meant to be a safety-net, never a tow-rope. Each individual needs to take ownership of their own outcomes.  
2. Accountability can also become toxic when people don't ask for and receive the help they actually need. If this happens, accountability is merely a way to shame each other for not measuring up or trying hard enough because it doesn't resolve the underlying issue. It only identifies good and poor behavior, which simply creates a cycle of failure.

When people are accountable to themselves and receive the help they need, they can correct their course even when they fail. When we take a healthy approach to accountability, failure is simply another part of learning and growing.

This is incredibly empowering.

So how do we detox accountability that goes bad?

**First, we must remove shame.**

Removing shame liberates people to take ownership of their own outcomes without fear of embarrassment. When people expect to be shamed for their failure, they aren’t motivated to do better, but simply *to not let others find out* next time.

**Second, we must start addressing real problems, not just symptoms.**

It’s become a cliche, but it’s worth reiterating. You cannot heal disease by only addressing symptoms. You heal disease by targeting the root issue causing the symptoms. Although surface issues show what’s wrong deep down, meaningful change only happens as we address root issues.

For example, a boss could continually reprimand an employee who always turns his assignments in late. This might result in on-time assignments, but it will like add pressure to both the boss and the employee.

The best method would be to figure out *why* he’s always late. Does he have too many responsibilities? Is he working outside of his gifting? Is he going through a hard time personally?

Understanding and helping the employee in these areas will result in better, long-term results.

By removing shame and addressing the real problems, we can detox our accountability and start developing healthy community.

Which will help you...

Be the best you\!
