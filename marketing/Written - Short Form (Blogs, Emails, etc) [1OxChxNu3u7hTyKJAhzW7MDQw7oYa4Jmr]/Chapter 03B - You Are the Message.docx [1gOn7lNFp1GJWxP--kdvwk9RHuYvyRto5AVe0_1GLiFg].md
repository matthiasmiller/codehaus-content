## **"BEING" First \- Your Life is a Message**

When you being living your life from the starting point of BEING, you begin to live your life as a message. You not only have a message to share with the world, but you ARE a message to share with the world

Have you ever sat down and read a book on \[\[example of Olympic triathlete\]\]? His life and his message are so powerful. Why? Because he is a living story, a living message of hope and inspiration to people around him.

The same is true for you.

You are a message for the world. When you're walking down the street, people see a message. When you interact with strangers, people see your message. When you interact with your friends, people see your message.

It's like you're a giant, living breathing WORD, everywhere you.

What is that message?

It might be the message that others overcome the odds. Maybe you encourage your friends to overcome defeat, to keep their eyes on success.

It might be the message that everyone deserves to be loved. Everywhere you go, you demonstrate to people that you really truly care, that you they matter to you, and that you'll help them get through every circumstances.

It might be the message of empowerment. Maybe you're the person who encourages your friends to be everything they can be, to reach for their potential. maybe you're the one who is believing in them when they don't believe in yourself.

Everything in life revolves around your message.

You can't escape it, and you can't ignore it. And your best response is to embrace it, then live it. \+Let it become part of your life.

When you show up at work in the morning, that's who you are. When you're driving down the freeway, that's how you relate. When you come home to your family at night, that's how you respond.

Every part of your life is touched by this message.

Don't get me wrong--this isn't something you figure out in a day. But it is something that you can figure out.

Here are some really practical ways for you to figure out:

* Write down some of the common reoccurring themes in how you relate with others?

* Ask your friends, "What is it that's unique about how I relate with other people?"

It's a start.

Then, pay attention to yourself. Think about it. Keep journaling.

And live your message, and let it touch every part of what you do.

That's what it means to live, not from DOING, not from KNOWING, but from BEING.

## **"DOING" Second \- Action Brings Insight**

We understand a little bit of what it means to live from the BEING. But why put DOING before KNOWING?

Here's why.

Too many people get caught up in trying to learn everything they need to do before they take action. They're so busy reading books that they're never ready to step out and take action.

In reality, you need to live your life like this:

* Ask yourself, What do I absolutely need to know to take the next step?

* Take the next step.

* Repeat.

Don't get caught in analysis paralysis.

But it doesn't stop there.

## **"KNOWING" Last \- Cashing In on Experiential Knowledge**

You have to have an open mind to learn from your experiences, and you have to be careful what you let your experiences tell you.

For example, if you're starting a new business, you might tell yourself, "This is not working, and this will never take off." It might be true, but it might be completely false. You know that with as much certainty as, "This is taking a lot of time and work to get started, but it has the potential to be something really big."

You might have a conversation with someone, maybe a prospect, and they get upset and don't want to talk with you. You might tell yourself, "I'm really bad at communicating with other people" (which might be true, be honest\!), but it might be equally true that she found out some upsetting news early that morning?

What is your experience telling you?

Most of all, what excuses are you trying to support with your experiences? How are you reshaping your experiences to make excuses for where you're at?

You see, when experiences are used rightly, they give you powerful insight not only into what you're doing, but into who you are.

## **Using Identity For Breakthrough**

As you approach learning a new skill or entering a new arena, it's important that you ask yourself the question, "Who do I need to be?"

Many people stop short of reaching their potential because they're trying to reach new levels without adjusting who they are. They're trying to approach a larger business with a small business mindset. They are trying to interact with influencers when they feel obliged to crawl into a hole to hide.

You're faced with new opportunities right now. You've got places you would like to go. Who do you need to be to get there?

I Again, if you're a business owner and want to scale to a different level, what kinds of patterns do you need to break off? What kinds of mindsets do you need to change? What shifts do you need to make in your internal core about who you are, and how you present yourself to the world?

If you're single and wanting to get married, who do you need to become to be the right "someone" for someone else? What if you lived your life with all of the positive qualities that you expect from the ideal "you" five years down the road? What if you became intent upon becoming a person of intentionality, integrity, courage, and happiness? What if you became intent upon learning how to lead, learning how to serve, and learning how to care for others?

None of us have the capacity to live anywhere but in the present, but each of us have the capacity to prepare ourselves for the future.

A vision for who you want to be in five years will pull you forward to future. I twill show you opportunities you need to be taking, and places you need to be visiting,. It will show you beliefs that you need to transform.

## **Impact through Congruence**

Have you ever tried to hit a nail with a hammer, and it glanced off instead of driving it into the wood? That's what it's like when you try to make an impact without alignment.

Everything in your life needs to live up to your core message, your core passion. Otherwise, it will be like swinging a hammer, and it glances off. No matter how much force you put into it, it won't make a big impact.

But if you do find congruence, you will swing your hammer, hit the nail solidly on its head, and you will drive it in every time.

When you find congruence with who you are, you will being making a deep, marked impact on every life that you meet?

## **Identity Starts Within**

When you think about who you are, lots of people have different ideas. But the most critical piece is learning how to describe yourself separate from what you do--from the role, the position, or the situation.

What I do on a daily basis is inspire other people to greatness. That's what burns in my heart. I believe in their dreams more than they believe in themselves.

It happens that I am, right at this moment, doing this by sitting at my computer, headphones in, and pounding away on my keyboard.

It also happens that this week, I did this by meeting with individuals and working through these very issues in their life.

All that could change.

My computer could get stolen. All my clients could quit. I could be left broke on the street. Maybe get a job flipping burgers at McDonalds.

But I can guarantee you that I would get back up, and I would make a way. And I would hope that that place would be the happiest, most motivated fast food place while I'm there.

What keeps me going?

It's this single drive--to empower others to be their best selves. To believe in their dreams. To serve them in getting there.

What is it for you?

Whatever it is, I believe in you. You have the capacity to go out and change the world, because you not only carry a unique message to the world.

You ARE a unique message to the world.
