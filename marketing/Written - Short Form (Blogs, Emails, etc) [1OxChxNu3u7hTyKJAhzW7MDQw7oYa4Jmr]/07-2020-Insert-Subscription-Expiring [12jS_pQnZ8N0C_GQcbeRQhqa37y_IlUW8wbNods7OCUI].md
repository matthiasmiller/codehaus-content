# **Your Complimentary Subscription Is Expiring**

I want to make a bold statement about your success:

**Aligning yourself with the right people and helping your people align with their natural abilities is one of the most important things you can do as a leader.**

I’ve seen my team go from a solo entrepreneur (yes, that was me\!) to a small team where my team members make comments like, “My wife is so thankful that I am working for this company.” How did this happen?

Along the way, I’ve learned the importance of a healthy, aligned team. A team where everyone is on the right seat on the bus.

This has not happened by accident. It’s happened because I have invested (and continue to invest) in my professional development every single month. Today, as I reflect on the people I’ve had the opportunity to connect with and interact with over the past few months, I’m humbled by the quality of people who surround me.

I’ve enjoyed sharing these insights with you through this leadership journal. Unfortunately, your complimentary subscription is expiring. However, I would love to continue being part of your leadership transformation.

The subscription is normally $7.99/mo. We offer a 30% discount for annual subscriptions ($69/year). As a special Founding Member thank you, we are offering **an additional 50% discount so you can receive your first year for only $34.50.**

If you would like to continue getting access to the insights that I gain through my continued mentorship, I’d love to take you along on the journey\! If not, know that my team and I wish you the best in your leadership journey.

Best wishes as you lead\!

Matthias Miller
