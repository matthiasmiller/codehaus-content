**Marketing DNA Test:**  
Somewhat similar as Birkman. One thing it does is give a clear understanding of how you are most likely to promote your business. How you’ll be most effective. Gives in depth on sales and marketing.

**Prophetic Coaching:**  
Head trash concepts. Creative ideas, understanding God’s design. Why did God put you on the planet? Understanding road block you might not be aware of. Other parts are much more systematic and scientific… this is just as effective, but with a much more level of unpredictability and element of surprise.

Matthias:

Could be series.

With series… keep in mind autoresponder sequences.

Could make this series effective, tie in Matthias’ personal story with it all. 

Perry Marshall’s burning bus series. He leads you through it with cliffhangers at the end of every email.

Focus on Matt’s story as it relates to this ^^^

NIGHTMARE STORY: Matt working solo on project, on wife’s birthday, so stressed and out of it, that he barely was even able to celebrate her birthday after he got home from work.
