# **Introduction**

My first car was a little white Toyota Camry.

Okay, I lied. It wasn't white. It was two-tone: white with rust spots. It sported one lone hubcap, and the back door on the passenger side refused to open. On the inside, the tint was peeling off the windows and the upholstery on the ceiling was falling down. Once, when I was in the middle of Texas, my automatic seat belts refused to strap me in, so I had to disconnect the wire and rewind them by hand.

I shivered in my coat in the winter, then melted in the summer. I took a lot of nighttime road trips during the summer.

I even got pulled over in the little town I lived, and the officer called in two backups. I don't want to guess what judgments he made about me. As he walked up to my window, he looked at my car and asked, "Do you know your car is making a funny noise?

Yes, I did.

But I didn't care. I didn't care what kind of car I drove, and I didn't care to spend any time or money fixing all the little problems on my car. I'm sure my friends thought I was crazy, but if I didn't mind, why should I care about what my friends thought?

I didn't realize it at the time, but it was a parable of my life.

I was living my life with battered, rusted-out mindsets and habits. I'd get glimpses of success, but something was always eluding me. All of the things that were broken felt normal, so I never noticed them, must less took the time to fix them.

That's when I entered into the most difficult season of my life. It forced me to slow down, stop focusing on what was going on around me, and start focusing on what was going on within me.

What about you?

Maybe you've just gotten a promotion, and you're trying to step into a new role. Maybe you've just gotten married, and you're finding it a lot more challenging than you'd thought. Maybe you're starting a business, or taking the first steps to pursuing your dreams.

Suddenly, everything that felt familiar now feels strange. The rules have changed, and you're left alone to try to figure out where you should be going from here. This book is about what you do when the rules suddenly change on you and how to keep moving until you get to the other side.

Don't believe the lie that you're alone. Many others are experiencing the same kind of journey, right now, and it doesn't have to be strange, scary, or confusing. This can be the greatest season of your life\!

Many people are devastated by transition (and even success) simply because they are unprepared, but it's fully possible to learn how to navigate uncharted waters. You can make sure that your promotions in life will push you forward, not pull you back. You can keep moving to the next level with a certainty that you will not only survive, but you will thrive\!

Many people are going through life in an old, beat-up car. They sit at a stoplight, and when the light turns green, they punch the pedal as the car whimpers and creeps forward. But when you've become used to living life like that, you come to expect it. You get used to all the idiosyncrasies that you live with, and you don't expect to move far beyond them.

I want to change that.

I want to give you a chance to upgrade your ride. Your car might be shiny and nice on the outside, or it might be broken down and worn out. I want you to take some time to look under the hood, dig into the engine, and give it the tuneup or overhaul that it needs. I want you to plan out your road trip, know where you're going, then hit the road\!

## **Overhaul Your Engine**

Under the hood of your car is an engine. It's what provides the power to propel your car forward. It matters little how beautiful your car on the outside--it's the engine that determines how fast and how far you can go. All the aerodynamics in the world are mere tweaks.

Right now, your life is being propelled by an engine. That engine consists of your thoughts, your beliefs, and your unique perspective of the world. Success is first of an inner job. If you want to go further and faster, you don't need stomp the gas harder. You need to overhaul your engine so that it run more effectively and more smoothly.

## **Develop Your GPS**

On one of my many night-time road trips, I was excitedly talking on the phone (probably to keep myself awake). I became so distracted that I missed the only important turnoff on the entire trip. It took me thirty minutes to realize that I was speeding away from my destination.

The fault wasn't the engine. It was my direction.

You need to develop your personal GPS--to know the things that are the most important to you, to know clearly where you want to go. You must about knowing where you're going, then making sure you're getting there.

Transition is difficult when we don't have fixed reference points--things we can use to reorient ourselves in new situations.

## **Stomp the Pedal**

Have you ever watched an inexperienced driver learn to drive a manual transmission? Maybe it was you at one time. You've watched them either rev the engine wildly because they're scared to shift up, or they stall the car in the middle of an intersection.

Many people approach life the same way. They have places they want to go, but rather than pace themselves, they stomp on the gas and burn through their fuel, trying to get where they're going. Long before they reach their destination, they've burned themselves out. Others become so anxious to get immediate results that they overextend themselves, stall out, then neglect the idea they'd been so passionate about.

Many people live life trying to go further, faster. They stomp on the gas pedal, the engine revs wildly, and they burn through their fuel, trying to get where they're going. But they never let off the gas so they can clutch and shift into a higher gear. They never realize that if they could shift their life into a higher gear, they could accomplish more things with less effort.

When you're operating at your highest level, pointing your life in the direction you want to go, that's when you can add fuel to your dreams and start executing.

## **Summary**

I have chosen to break the book into three sections:

1. Overhaul Your Engine: so you have new ways of thinking and looking at the world.

2. Develop Your GPS: so can navigate the decisions that you need to make.

3. Stomp the Pedal: so you can take serious action towards your dreams.

Only time will tell what is truly possible with your life. You have only one chance to live, so go use it well\!
