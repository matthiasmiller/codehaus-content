# **Unleashing the Power of Gravity in Your Business**

Some businesses have an almost uncanny gravitational pull. If you've experienced it, you know exactly what I mean.

While it may be rare, the experience is unforgettable. When you approach the business, you find yourself happily sucked into their vortex. Somehow, the experience is so delightful you find yourself *wanting* to do business with them. Even when they're selling to you, it feels so comfortable and right that you're excited about handing over your money. And when they deliver, you are grateful for every dollar you spent. No buyer's remorse.

(By the way, if you happen to think anyone's crazy to be excited about doling out cold, hard cash, you're doing yourself and your customers a disservice. You're selling yourself short. Way short.)

You might also have experienced businesses without that gravitational pull.

If you don't know what I mean, take a trek to the local laundromat, look for the community bulletin board and find that dog-eared business card for a handyman. The phone number is scribbled out and another number scratched above it. Any chance that handyman's getting a call from you when your wife texts you at work, complaining that the faucet is leaking and she'd like it fixed yesterday?

Not a chance in the world\!

You're more likely to hang up what you're doing, drive home, and fix that confounded faucet yourself before you have some fly-by-night creep working in your house.

Let's face it--that's not gravitational pull. That's *anti-gravity*.

By definition, most businesses are simply average--lying somewhere between those extremes. Some of them are profitable, others aren't. Yet all of them (assuming they're a sound business) could dramatically improve their bottom line by creating this gravitational pull.

In marketing, we call it "positioning".

While we can all recognize this gravitational pull, most of us find it much harder to define it. Yet we can't deny its mysterious effect.

## **When Gravity Works for You**

Anyone who's ever started a business from scratch, especially in a new space, has faced the uphill battle when gravity works against you:

* You feel like you have to beg others to work with you.  
* You oversell, trying too hard to persuade others to do business with you.  
* You tolerate any-ole customer who comes your way.

For some businesses, the transition is easy. If you're a handyman, just become known as the guy who always returns phone calls and shows up on time. For other businesses, the transition is more challenging.

However, if you're not actively working to shift the pull of gravity, you're fighting a losing battle. Once you've "got it", everything seems to become easier:

* You don't have to chase prospects. They want to work with you.  
* You get to decide who you work with or what projects you take on.  
* You don't have to fight at the feeding trough to bid the bottom dollar. People are willing to pay what you're worth.  
* You don't have to defend yourself, because people see the value that you provide.

When you've got it, the tables turn and everything becomes dramatically easier.

## **The Science of Gravity**

If you remember back to your physics classes, you'll know that gravitational pull is determined by two factors.

The first factor is proximity--how close objects are to each other. The closer one object is to another, the stronger the gravitational pull. The further they drift, the more the pull is reduced. When you drop a rock, the earth wins because the sun is so far away.

The second factor is mass--the amount of substance in an object. The more mass that an object has, the stronger the gravitational pull. The less mass it has, the weaker the gravitational pull. This is why the moon revolves around the earth, and not vice versa.

When you apply these factors to your business, you have four factors to consider:

1. The proximity to your customers or clients  
2. The distance from your competitors  
3. The mass of your business  
4. The mass of your customers or clients

Let's take a look at each of those.

## **Proximity to Your Customers or Clients**

\[star\] Although proximity can be measured any number of ways, the most obvious is this: how visible are you? Do they even know you exist?

\[star\] If you're a local business, *can they find you on Google?* Do you rank near the top? Are you visible on Facebook? What kinds of magazines are they reading? Do they listen to the radio or watch television? Even though the Facebook user base is growing, you're not going to reach baby boomers the same way as millennials.

That's hardly rocket science, and it's so simple, it would be easy to gloss over.

Don't do it.

Just because YOU know that you exist doesn't mean the rest of the world does. My friends and I often joke about "new" discoveries we make about our town...things we've never heard of before such as businesses that have been established for over 10 years, or biking trails referenced by world-famous bloggers. While we aren't natives by a long-shot, we're not exactly the new kids on the block, either.

\[star\] Don't assume that everyone knows you exist. And if you're having a hard time getting in front of your prospects, you can increase your proximity by getting close to them on multiple channels, both online and offline.

However, proximity means more than just eyeballs.

\[star\] Proximity means being able to crawl inside someone else's skin, see what they see, and feel what they feel. It means truly understanding their world--their language, their frustrations, their joys, even their daily life.

It means being able to have them look you in your eyes and believe you when you tell them, "I know exactly how you're feeling."

But what does this look like in real life?

The small town of Canon City has seen its ebb and flow of coffee shops. While some of them have had a fantastic atmosphere, they've never lasted long. However, one coffee shop has bucked the trend, choosing a different location (and different model) than any other coffee shop has chosen.

They've ditched the atmosphere and stripped down the coffee shop to one thing...a drive-through. They've proven to their customers that they understand the busy, harried, and sometimes sleep-deprived workforce, rushing to get their kids ready for school before racing out the door to make it to work on time. If they're running late, they can even call in their order when they leave the house to shorten the wait.

They sell coffee for people on the move, and they're running like gangbusters. The early morning rush keeps their baristas on their toes. While they've got a great location, they've been able to tap into something much more important. They've been able to crawl inside people's minds and give them what they really want.

However, they've been able to do something more.

## **Distance from Your Competition**

They've also been able to distance themselves from their competition. The only other coffee shop with a drive-through is ten miles outside of town, catching commuters on their way to Colorado Springs.

That’s not to say that all competitive distance must be geographic. In fact, you might choose to place yourself smack-dab in the same neighborhood as your most direct competitors, leveraging other ways to create distance between you and them.

Whenever you distance yourself from your competition, you stop fighting against their gravitational pull.

Don't get me wrong--blindly distancing yourself from your competitors can get you in trouble. If you distance yourself from your competitors and don't move yourself closer to your customers, you've lost the game.

However, if you can find the magic combination of distancing yourself from your competitor while bringing yourself closer to your customers or clients, you can increase the strength of your gravitational pull.

\[star\] You can change this by your geographic focus, the types of products or services you provide, your business model, the type of value that you bring, the unique combination of products or services you provide, or a different way of making or delivering the products or services.

## **Making it Practical**

Yes, I know that I didn't talk about "mass"--the secret to packing a strong punch when you're the underdog, or dominating the market when you're the leader. Next month, I promise.

You'll also learn how to make the mindset shift, because I'm convinced that while what happens inside of you isn't everything, it has a dramatic impact on your positioning, or gravitational pull.

(By the way, if you're a non-profit, you can apply these exact concepts to donors, volunteers, and other giving opportunities. In fact, non-profits have a great opportunity to strengthen gravitational pull.)

If you're willing to make this practical, you should take 20-30 minutes right now to:

1. Grab a paper and pen. (Yes, you should do this by hand.)  
2. Read back over this article. I've even marked the parts you need to focus on with a little "star".  
3. Write down your business's strengths and weaknesses for each question or item in the list.  
4. Repeat the process for at least one (hopefully more) of your competitors.  
5. Spend some time looking for high-leverage ways to strengthen your positioning, then go out and start implementing it in your marketing.

Only 5% of my readers will actually do this, but the ones who do will likely land themselves in the top 1% of business owners.

They'll be the ones who own the gravitational pull.
