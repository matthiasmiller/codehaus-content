Another great idea \-- What to Do When the Register Doesn't Ring...

1\. could be because there's no market (the oh-duh reason that people overlook)  
2\. could be because nobody's aware of you  
3\. as an extension, the \#1 thing that you should be doing to get sales is actively prospecting (and most people get distracted doing something else instead of this)  
4\. could be there's a market, but people don't like your product so they're not coming back for more of it
