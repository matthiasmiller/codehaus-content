// My \#1 mistake that kept me stuck in an emotional mire //

This morning I took our 1-year-old son on an early morning walk after he woke up waaaay too soon. At first he rode along contentedly I'm his stroller, listening to the birds and watching the wind through the trees.

Halfway through the walk, however, his attitude shifted...

He began to whine, fuss, and kick. And yes, he even cried a few big elephant tears\!

I immediately knew what was wrong...

In my haste, I'd forgotten to grab a snack. I knew he was HUNGRY\! 🥣

I alternated between trying to console him and rushing back as quickly as I could. 🏃

That's when it hit me... 💡

\>\>\> I could never solve his emotional distress with anything BUT food. \<\<\<

Yet, that's what we do so many times.

You see, my \#1 mistake in healing my heart was that I didn't realize that...

💥 Emotional distress is sometimes caused by a PRACTICAL issue.  
💥 These cannot be solved with a better mindset, a more healed heart, or some introspective journaling.  
💥 These must be solved by PRACTICAL changes.

This has literally cost me in YEARS of emotional health.

I remember sitting down in my boss's office, hearing him describe me as "moody", and wondering what the heck I'd have to do to fix THAT.

I felt so broken that it never occurred to me that the solution might not be inside me.

It wasn't until years later that I learned about my Action DNA \-- that wholeness must come not only in our hearts ♥️ and minds 🧠 but also in our will 👐.

When I realized that and began to align with my own unique fingerprint for getting things done, I was finally able to put to rest emotional issues that had haunted me for a long time.

Like finally frying up breakfast for my 1-year-old son. 🍳
