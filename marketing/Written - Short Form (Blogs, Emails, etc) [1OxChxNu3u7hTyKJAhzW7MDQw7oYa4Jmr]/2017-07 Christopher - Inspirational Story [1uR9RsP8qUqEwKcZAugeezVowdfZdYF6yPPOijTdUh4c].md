**Target: 240**

Cops are mean, corrupt, and just out to give you a ticket—right? At least, that’s the narrative many people want us to believe these days. 

Well, this spring an officer in Kansas City proved that narrative wrong by coming through in a big way for one lucky Popeyes employee.

According to *Today.com,* Shajuana Mays was running the Popeye’s drive-through when Donald Carter, a Kansas City police office, met her and learned that she dreamt of becoming a nurse.

After thinking about it for awhile, Carter decided he’d ask, via social media, for 300 people to give a simple donation of $5 to cover Shajuana’s school expenses. He got $13,000 in under three days. The officer surprised the Popeye’s employee with the gift at the restaurant, with a Facebook-livestream to show all the donors.

“I don’t even know how to describe it in words,” she said (according to Today.com). “It’s an emotional feeling right now that’s unexplainable, but it’s all good and happy emotions and feelings. I’m excited — I actually get to pursue something that I’ve always wanted to be doing for a very long time."

As of writing this, her GoFundMe is still live and at $15,178 \- all given in one month.

There is no limit to the good we can do when we keep our eyes and hearts open to the needs of the people around us.
