* Common Sense  
* **Why Some People Seem to Lack Common Sense**

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

Have you ever noticed how some of the most creative people also lack common sense?

I think this is because creatives are constantly thinking “outside the box.”

Here’s the thing, there are two kinds of people:

* People who naturally think “outside” the box (creatives)  
* People who naturally think “inside” the box (traditional thinkers)

If you put creatives into an unfamiliar situation, they’ll think of a new way to solve the problem, which won’t always align with common sense. They’re “creatives” after all\! They may discover a new solution to a tough problem, but they may also end up making the solution much worse than it had to be.

If you put the latter--traditional thinkers--into an unfamiliar situation, they’ll look for ways to solve the problem based on how other people have solved it or based on similar situations in the past. They may find a solution that’s already proven to work, but they may also find themselves stuck if the solution doesn’t work. They’re thinking “inside the box.” 

Neither way of thinking is inherently wrong, as long as it fits the situation. You don’t want a brain surgeon thinking up a new technique while you’re under his scalpel. Nor do you want your marketing team to only think up ideas other people are already doing.

Unfortunately, those on either side of the equation can end up feeling stupid if they don’t recognize their strengths. People who think “inside” the box have a more difficult time coming up with new, creative ideas. On the other hand, people who think “outside” the box have a harder time solving simple, commonplace problems.

Neither one is less important than the other, but trouble follows those who are functioning in the wrong role and don’t understand their weaknesses.

When creatives and traditional thinkers learn how to work together, they can leverage each other’s strengths to create synergy on their team..

I’m curious: What kind of thinker are you? Do you tend to think outside the box or do you stick with what’s tried and proven? Shoot me a reply\! I’d love to hear what you’ve learned\!

And always…

Be the best you\!
