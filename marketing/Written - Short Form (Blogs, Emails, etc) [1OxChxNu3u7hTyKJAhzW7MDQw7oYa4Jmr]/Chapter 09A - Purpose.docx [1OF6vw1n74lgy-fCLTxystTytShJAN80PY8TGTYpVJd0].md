# **Chapter: Purpose: Finding Your Why**

When you are navigating through transition, as we have already discussed, you must reorient yourself according to fence posts that don't move. That's the importance of knowing and living by your values, which are the priorities you hold in your heart. However, it's also important to know the "why" in your heart. This is your purpose.

Purpose is the deep underlying reason of why you do what you do. It is a thread running through every part of your life. It's not restricted to what you do. Your work and your actions are merely expressions of your purpose.

That's what makes purpose so powerful. In any situation, you can adapt it to match your purpose. Again, this ability gives you the opportunity to embrace change, because you know that in every situation, you can find the meaning in it.

Meaninglessness simply means we haven't found our "why", and your purpose is the answer to your meaninglessness. If you are wandering in life, it is not because you haven't found the right thing to do, but because you haven't found the right "why" to attach to.

It's easy to get this in the wrong order. When I was fifteen years old, I wrote myself a letter and put it in a time capsule, predicting what I would be when I grew up. MY predictions were astonishingly correct--that I would deviate from my true desire for a while, but that I would come back to be an author and a speaker.

Even at a young age, I knew what I wanted to do, but I had not yet discovered the "why". It turned out that the process of finding the "why" was critical in understanding what my role as an author and a speaker should be.

Your purpose is the deep "why" of your heart, and it's important for you to dig deeply enough to hear the purpose of your life.

## **But I Don't Know My Purpose**

I hear the objections, "I don't know my purpose."

The problem isn't that you don't know your purpose. The problem is that you're so aware of everything you don't know, that you're unable to see the purpose you've discovered so far. They key to discovering your purpose is to open your eyes and begin to look at the here and now.

Within your life, you have clues. It might be very faint clues, but you have clues. Pay attention to those clues, and become aware of your purpose as well as you know. You'll discover that your awareness of your purpose will continue to grow as you pay attention to it.

You might recognize something within you that is drawn to children, and you know that you love to spend time with them and make them feel valued. It's not merely an interest, but it's something deep within your heart that pulls you there.

You will clarify your purpose throughout your life. You will find certain children you are compelled to serve. But you can always clarify the specifics later. For now, you've found a thread of your purpose: to instill value into the lives of the people you meet. That's enough to start with.

You can integrate that into every situation that you're in, whether you're working in the twentieth floor in the executive boardroom, or you're serving ice cream at a corner store. Every interaction that you have, you are able to live your purpose.

While you still might not know whether you want to teach school, counsel juveniles, or run a daycare, you are still able to begin living on purpose. For now, you might not be able to work directly with children.

## **Attaching to Your Purpose**

Many people live in situations that don't seem to support their purpose. Sometimes it's really the case, but sometimes it's simply because they haven't been able to make the connection. Sometimes situations demand that we do things that seem less than ideal.

Many people lose meaning in situations that, while quite necessary to the process, seem distant from the true purpose that is driving them. When you're disconnected, you have three simple options.

First, you can learn to attach your purpose to what you're doing now. If you're working on your teaching degree, you might need to pick up an extra job to pay the bills. You might be working part-time as a fill-in secretary for a small business. On the surface, this is only a distraction from what you want to be doing: working directly with kids.

However, this job is serving to very important pieces. First, it helps you pay your way through college, and it's playing a very direct supportive role. Second, if you're paying attention, you're learning skills of management, leadership, and organization that will be very helpful in your future role, no matter the specifics.

Second, you can learn to integrate your purpose to what you're doing now. Broaden your purpose as far as you need to in order to apply it to the world that you're in. If you're not able to focus on instilling value in children, focus on doing that in your coworkers and your employer. Use it as an opportunity to find the "why" behind your "why", the purpose beneath the purpose. Find out what motivates you to demonstrate value to children. Probe for a reason that you truly can apply to your situation.

Of course, your third option is changing your situation to better align with your purpose. However, I leave this as the third option, because it assumes that you've dug deep enough into your purpose that you're not moving on because you're merely wandering. You're moving on because you found that your current situation is not supporting you.

## **The Reconnected Life**

Living by your purpose brings a sense of integrity and wholeness. Because your purpose isn't specific to your situation, it means that you can apply it to all of your life.

When you get up to go to work in the morning, you get to apply it to what you do at work. When you meet with a customer, you get to live your purpose as you work with them. When you schedule team meetings, you get to live your purpose.

When you come home from work, exhausted from a long day, you're able to live out that same purpose as you relate to your husband, your wife, or your children. When you meet with your friends, your same purpose compels you to do what you do.

You don't have to switch hats at any time during the day. Who you are at work is the person you are at home. Who you are at home is the person you are with your friends.

Many people live disconnected, incongruent lives. Because they have not taken the time to find the things that are truly important to them, and to discover the "why" behind the things they do, they move from one situation to another, constantly adapting to the situation. It's no wonder people burn out from work or are absent from their families.

You find a sense of continuity and integrity when all of life is integrated, a sense of wholeness and completion. Without it, you feel empty and lost, like you're wandering through life.

## **Purpose Isn't Everything**

Your purpose isn't everything, but it is the main thing. Not every situation will align itself perfectly with your purpose, but your purpose can align itself with every situation. You cannot control everything that happens to you, but you can change how you respond to this situation.

Many people become lost because their current situation violates their sense of purpose. However, the real problem is that it only violates their conception or expectation. Because the problem they face doesn't align with what they expect, they immediately check out. They refuse to look at their current situation because they can't see any connection. They become so focused on their purpose that they lose connection with life.

A true perspective on purpose will allow you to look at your life's situations and see the meaning within it. It will allow you to see your life through a grid that gives meaning to it, that fits into a bigger picture for who you are and who you want to become.

Your expectations will keep you from seeing life's situations in the proper light. When you forget your purpose, you will find yourself tossed here and there by the situations that arise. You will find difficulty distracting you, instilling doubt into your mind, because you lose your context for interpreting hardship.

It's only in the context of purpose that we have any grid for dealing with hardship, difficulty, and distraction. These serve only to increase our focus on our purpose, to encourage us to strive to become better at what we do.

Purpose isn't everything, but it is the main thing, and if you allow it, it will give you a reason "why" that is much bigger than the situation that you're in.

## **Creating Your Why**

Many people assume that because you're living on purpose, you live life with an automatic "why". It's simply not true. Living on purpose may be one of the most difficult, but most rewarding choices you can make.

Many people want life to serve them, and they live as a victim to their own sense of purpose. The truth of the matter is that you do not serve your purpose--your purpose serves you. You are the one who gets to wake up and determine that your purpose will compel you through the day. You are the one who determines just how much punch and how much power is in your purpose.

You're the one who creates your "why". Yes, you do take a journey of self-discovering, but at the end of the day, unless you're able to truly own your purpose and step into your best self to live it out, it's not going to be enough to keep you going.

You must learn to create your "why".

## **Purpose in Hardship**

People assume that because they have purpose, life will be easy for them. If anything, life will be harder. From the outside, life is easy when you have no purpose, because it allows you to drift from one easy situation to another. When something becomes too difficult for you, you can sidestep it. But on the inside, that life is really difficult to live. You can have a simple, easy life, but it carries no depth.

Living a life on purpose is hard. You will encounter hardship and obstacles. You will watch your friends go through life, watch as almost everything comes their way. You may be faced with the temptation to question whether what you're doing is truly worth it. You will be faced with the very difficult and sometimes painful decision to say "no" to opportunities that others will gladly take.

It might mean giving up some of your personal hobbies to invest in the lives of your children. It might mean getting up earlier so that you can serve breakfast at the soup kitchen. It might mean staying up late so that you can write one more page in the book that you're writing.

These are hard decisions, but even though these challenges are difficult, they produce a depth on the inside that nothing else can reproduce.

This is a depth of fulfillment and satisfaction in your life that your friends cannot touch. If you're living aligned with your purpose, you already know that at the end of your life, you will be able to say with conviction, "I have lived the best life I knew how, and I am certain that I have made my best mark on the world."

Your purpose does not eliminate hardship, but it gives you the clear focus and direction to consistently bust through the hardship until you rise victorious on the other side.
