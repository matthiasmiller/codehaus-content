# **Ripping the Band-Aid Off Your Shame**

"What does SHAME have to do with running teams, making money, closing deals, and getting things done?"

Isn't shame a soft, touchy-feely subject, in light of hard numbers and tight deadlines?

Not so.

You can learn the best tactics in the world, hire the best coaches, surround yourself with the brightest people. But unless you learn to actively deal with your beliefs, you'll consistently sell yourself short.

And trust me...I've spent enough time in the personal development and motivational world that I'm HIGHLY skeptical of 99% of the "positive thinking" and "motivational hype" that exists.

However, I'm also well-versed enough to know that if you can dial into that 1% that really works, you'll find leverage for your personal productivity and success.

Still skeptical?

Good\! It means you're in for a great ride\!

## **We've All Been a Little Bit Broken**

Yes, even I've been a little bit broken. Most of us just never talk about it.

More specifically, I don't really talk about it.

I haven't talked much about the shy, geeky kid who struggled to make friends during school. I could have explained why the Pascal programming language compiled more quickly than the C++ programming language. However, if I needed to start a conversation with you, I couldn't figure out how to do it.

I haven't talked much about the business coach I hired who tried to motivate me through manipulation and pressure, told me to disregard my personal ethics (and in some cases, the law), and then blamed me for my lack of results. I can physically feel my body react to that memory as I write this.

I also haven't told you the way that experience has caused me to put my foot on the brakes. The last thing I ever want to do is harm another human the same way. If that coach were in the medical profession, he should have been charged with malpractice.

I haven't told you about sitting across the desk from someone who was supposed to provide resources to support me in my business, listening to them tell me the dozen reasons why I would never succeed, then explaining that the barriers they'd just created were actually their way of helping me. Never mind that the objections they raised had absolutely no good answers. That voice rang in my head for way too long.

I haven't told you about how I managed to get my church to make an "official statement" about me without any conversations with me to understand where I was coming from. I haven't talked about how painful it was to live out Jesus' command to "love your neighbor as yourself" when I suddenly found myself emotionally distanced from my spiritual community and enshrouded in skepticism.

I haven't talked about the money I've lost on failed ventures, the deals I didn't close because of the obvious oversights on the sale.

I haven't talked about the days when I woke up with a paralyzing sense of overwhelm, sitting frozen at my desk for hours at a time, unable to do what needed to be done to keep moving things forward.

I haven't talked about these things, because it's much easier to hide behind the veneer. It's easier to paint the picture that we've achieved our destination, and we've got this tidy package of success with a neatly-tied bow on top.

It's much, much easier just to cover up.

## **We All Have Our Ways to Cover Up**

We all find our own way to slap a band-aid on our shame.

Some of us work harder than anyone else, cutting our sleep to five hours a night, making sure that we're the first to show up and the last to leave.

Some of us retreat, giving up hope, choosing not to invest in ourselves and our business because we've concluded we're not worth it.

Some of us create an intellectual fortress around ourselves, deliberately creating situations where we'll never be found out.

Some of us allow others to overpower our decisions, because we're too ashamed to admit that we're tired of having our opinions and preferences trampled on.

Some of us over-compensate for our weaknesses, proclaiming ourselves experts on a subject we know very little about, covering our shame with our boisterous proclamations.

Some of us never proclaim ourselves an expert, because we never consider ourselves good enough or smart enough to reach that level.

While the behaviors may vary, lying underneath these actions is a silent killer of success.

## **Shame Is Self-Sabotage**

Shame is a silent killer of success, one of the roots of self-sabotage. If it can't keep you from turning a profit, it will keep you from enjoying the profit you do make.

We all have different personalities, different preferences, and different modus operandi. However, shame will always distort your ideal self.

What is shame? The easiest way to define shame is to contrast it with guilt.

Guilt says, “You made a mistake.”

Shame says, “You ARE a mistake.”

No matter where you go or what you do, shame will tell you, “There is something wrong with you.”

If shame has such a profound impact, how do you truly escape its grip? How do we rip off the band-aid, allow the wound to heal, so that we can be our fullest, truest selves?

## **Your Past Is Not Your Enemy**

The self-sabotage you're facing is not caused by your past. It's caused by your interpretations of your past.

Let's use a simple example.

When you place your hand on a hot stove, you draw a simple conclusion, "Stoves are hot." This conclusion proves to be a helpful conclusion in life. It saves you from a lot of pain\! However, something else happens. When your skin accidentally brushes against a stove, your arm jerks back immediately, no matter whether the stove is hot or not.

Life is exactly like that.

Throughout our life, we all have difficult experiences. For some of them, we draw helpful conclusions. "Don't pick a fight with someone twice your size." Other times, we draw less helpful conclusions. "Don't speak up in class, or your friends will make fun of you."

Twenty years later, we're in an important meeting and recognize a problem with the direction we're headed. Even though we've grown up and moved past it, we're still back in the classroom, petrified of speaking up because we're scared we'll be mocked for our contribution.

What's the answer to getting free?

If you can rewire your beliefs about the situation in the classroom, you can rewire your behaviors in the boardroom.

How do you actually do that?

## **Identifying the Lies and Encountering Truth**

I've explored a lot of different ways to rewire my beliefs, both from spiritual and secular perspectives. Some of them I've had little success with, while others actually been quite helpful. I've frequently had major breakthroughs whenever I've discovered a new "normal", then adapted my beliefs to match that. Journaling has proven to be an immensely helpful tool in uncovering and rewiring these beliefs.

I have an invitation for my bold, courageous readers.

Last month I became fully convinced of a fast track method. It's the fastest, most effective (and safest) way to rewire your self-sabotaging beliefs and get free from shame. Within an hour or two, you can uncover significant blocks in your personal life that are preventing you from moving forward as quickly or as effectively as you know you should be able to. Just as importantly, because it's a hands-on process, you can learn a number of tools to continue this transformation on your own.

With most approaches, you must rely on your facilitator's knowledge of a full list of possible beliefs that you might hold. However, this approach allows you to rapidly dial into your broken beliefs and identify them quickly. While some approaches require affirmations or repeated enforcement, this approach literally enables you to rewrite your RAM with the truth.

This approach also allows you to clean up your mental real estate. That 5th grade bully who's been camping out in the back corner of your mind can finally be evicted, forever.

I'll be candid, however.

Some of my readers will find this approach VERY offensive and controversial, while others will wonder what the fuss is all about. If you're easily offended, don't bother. However, if you're serious about getting rid of blocks that are keeping you from moving forward, I'm making more information available at multiplier.link/shame.

Please note: I do NOT make any money off this plug. I'm sharing this information simply because it's the fastest, most effective way I've found to eliminate these beliefs. While some people may find it controversial, it's far from spooky and certainly not that weird.

No matter your approach, here's my challenge: resolve to rip the band-aids off your shame, and live fully free so that you can bring your A-game and make the impact you know in your heart of hearts you were born to make.
