Challenging Fundamental Assumptions

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }},**

Have ever watched a ten-year-old try chopping down a tree? 

Grabbing that just-slightly-too-heavy axe, they step back and give a confident swing. The axe bounces off the tree, barely even making a dent in the wood.

“It’s okay,” we tell them. “Just wait until you put on a few more muscles. Then you’ll be able fell your first tree.”

Similarly, it’s easy to assume we need more “muscle” to succeed in the business world--that we simply have to wait for us to “grow up”.  Many people run away from their problems because they assume they don’t have what it takes to solve them. 

*“Oh, I’m not a salesman--I wouldn’t be able to sell my product.”* 

*“I’m not a writer; I couldn’t keep my customers engaged.”* 

*“I’m not organized enough to run a team.”*

They cut themselves short and stunt their potential because they’ve already assumed they can’t do it.

But take that grubby, over-confident adolescent kid who swung a heavy axe at a tree and failed to bring it down.

Sure, perhaps he isn’t destined to become a lumberjack, but his failure doesn’t mean he can’t fell a tree. It may just mean he needs to re-adjust his tools or develop his skills.

Instead of assuming that he’s too weak to chop down a tree, he should take stock of the situation, asking questions to challenge his Fundamental Assumption:

1. Is the axe sharp?  
2. Is there a lighter axe to use so I can swing with all my might?  
3. Can I use a chainsaw?

Now, I’m not recommending we let ten year old boys run around the forest felling trees with chainsaws. We’ll have even greater problems if we do that\!

Rather, I’m asking you to challenge your Fundamental Assumptions. Instead of immediately assuming you have no solution and moving on (the “I can’t swing an axe, so I’ll never be a lumberjack” mentality), **approach each problem assuming that there *is* a solution and you just have to look for it to find it**.

Often, we feel as though some problems demand more effort than they’re worth. We choose to respond to these roadblocks by accepting them as closed doors.

However, this is usually not the only option we have. By accepting the roadblock, we forfeit the great success that lies *beyond* the roadblock and stunt our potential.

Learn to challenge your underlying Fundamental Assumptions, making that your automatic response.

Next week, I’m going to share some tips on how to teach your team to challenge their Fundamental Assumptions in order to find a way through any road block.

Until then...

Be the best you\!

**Fundamental assumptions**  
More thoughts \-- when people have difficulty achieving success, they often end up blaming themselves and saying “I’m not cut out for this”, when in reality all they need is a different toolset or more skills. 

If it takes you a long time to chop down a tree, you can either assume that you’re weak, or you can look for some techniques such as:

* Making sure your ax is sharp  
* Making sure you’re chopping WITH the grain instead of against it (more about splitting logs, not chopping down trees)

Are you just going to blame yourself and assume you can’t fix it, or will  you look for better ways to solve your problem?

New idea--can you train people how to question fundamental assumptions? i.e. easy for me, hard to Will

This is almost more about encouraging people to challenge their fundamental assumptions.

For example, in a “down” economy...challenge that assumption, because there are POCKETS of the economy that are doing better.

Or...certain kinds of people make poor employees, or certain types of people never change….

It all starts with a fundamental belief that there actually IS a solution the problem that you’re facing, however, it just might look radically different than you thought.

Sometimes it’s simply not worth bulldozing through a roadblock...so rather than trying to power your way through it, what if you looked for creative ways to either leverage the obstacle, fundamentally eliminate the obstacle, or fundamentally move around it?

Of course, there’s still this reality that sometimes something demands more effort than we really thing is worth it, so we may choose to respond to roadblocks by accepting them as a closed door. However, we should recognize that this is likely not the ONLY option that we have.

Other things you could explore??

* What are questions you can ask to help break free from fundamental assumptions?  
* What are other examples you could include?  
* What are ways we can identify whether assumptions are getting the better of us?  
* Any other practical tools to apply this?  
    
    
  


  
Will referenced the book “Six Thinking Hats”, so it’s up to you to take a look at that.
