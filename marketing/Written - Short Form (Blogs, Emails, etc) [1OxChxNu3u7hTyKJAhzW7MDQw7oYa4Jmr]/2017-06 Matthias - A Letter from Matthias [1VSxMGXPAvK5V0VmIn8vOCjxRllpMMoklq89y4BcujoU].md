I'm a bit of a self-discovery fanatic. Just ask my wife. I've invested a lot of time, energy, and yes, money, into understanding exactly what makes me tick. Recently, however, I’ve been shocked by a new discovery.

Many people (myself included) saw my love for variety and change, and assumed I was a very flexible person. Not true. I actually have a deep need for structure.

To make it more difficult, my productive and stressed behaviors appear almost identical on the surface. I bounce from task to task with no sense of anxiety in either situation. The tell-tale clue? My stressed behavior yields no productive results.

Even more curious, breaking the stress spiral requires that I embrace structure--which feels unnatural on the surface--so that I can unleash my own kind of magic.

This small insight is bringing a dramatic lift to my productivity.

The same is true for you. If you're not doing so already, look for the things unique to you that make you tick. You'll boost your productivity, cut back stress, and make your biggest mark on the world.
