# **Part: Develop Your GPS**

# **Chapter: GPS**

When I had my little white beat-up car, I didn't go on a lot of road trips. It was cold in the winter and hot in the summer. Most of time, I wandered here and there within the little town that I lived.

And I lived my life that way, too.

I wandered here and there, trying one thing, then trying another. It's actually not a bad way to live, if you love experimenting and getting things done.

But then I realized something.

It wasn't exploring. I was merely drifting.

I realized that I had no reason strong enough to compel me to walk in a single direction, continually pushing through the obstacles, until I reached my destination.

If I hit an obstacle in my life, I was more than happy to drop what I was doing and look for something that would improve my situation.

What about you?

How do you know where you want to be going? What keeps you pressing forward when the time gets tough? What keeps you pursuing after your dream?

Do you even have a dream?

Do you know how to stay on track in the pursuit of that dream?

Are you living for a purpose that's so big that when lesser distractions come your way, you're willing to lay it all aside and keep pushing forward?

This is the power of having a GPS--a way to navigate through life. Life is filled with difficult decisions--choices between a lesser and a greater, choices between a good option and another good option.

But the real question is, "Are you willing to go through life, pursuing not the good things, but exclusively pursing the very best things?"

Are you willing to sacrifice what it takes to have not a good family, but a great family?

Are you willing to sacrifice the discomfort of not having merely a good career, but the best career?

Are you willing to say "no" to a few good things so that you can say "yes" to the things that are deeply important to you?

You have a message within you that you carry--you are meant to change the world around you. It might be one life. It might be ten lives.

But it might be millions.

Who's to tell?

And who's to know if, at the end of the arduous journey, when you've given everything that you've got to say "yes" to the very best things in your life, you'll discover you truly have impacted millions of lives?

But step back.

It's inspiring to think of the possibilities.

But how do you get there? How do you keep pushing forward?

You have to start with the foundation--with your approach. You have to work on your inner world. You have to prepare yourself for success.

And then, you start making simple, daily choices that move you in the direction of your dreams.

## **What keeps people from getting promoted?**

Step back once again. Take a look at where you are in life.

Are you where you want to be? Have you succeeded as quickly as you wanted to? Have you progressed as fast as you hoped you might?

And have you accomplished some things along the way that you thought might be completely impossible?

Wherever you are, if you haven't just crossed into playing into the next level, it's time for you to step into the next level. It's time for you to up your game, to push on your self-imposed limits. It's time for you to push yourself.

It'll be uncomfortable.

It's disorienting when you move into a new place, and you don't know where you're going. You've lost all your points of reference.

Before my wife and I moved into our neighborhood, I would sometimes take walks through that part of town. I remember getting incredibly confused by the twists and turns, the streets that looped back and touched themselves. I had four different routes I could take, and all of them ended up at the same place.

At times, I wondered if I was merely walking in circles\!

But after we moved into that part of town, I realized that as disorienting as it seemed, it was really quite simple.

All I needed was to get my points of reference, and get oriented.

That's what it's like when you step into the next level of life. You lose your ability to tell where you're going. You're not sure what you should do. You're not sure how to prioritize. All of the things that were familiar to you are now a distant memory, and you're stuck in this situation, trying to figure everything out.

It's OK to be uncomfortable, but it doesn't have to be painful.

Many people orient themselves around their situations, and they rely on their situations to dictate whether they are doing well. When they come home from work and they've got results to show for what they've done--a tip from a customer, or a good word from their boss--that's when they know they've been living life well.

But what happens when you step into a new season, into a new realm of responsibility? How do you respond when you don't get that affirmation, because quite frankly, you're so busy trying to learn the ropes?

To make matters worse, instead of feeling like you're making progress, it often feels like you're going backward. When you were playing at the lower level, you had mastered it. You knew the rules like the back of your hand. You were competent.

And that was exactly why you needed to step into the new level.

And you have to ask the question, what are you going to do now? How will you choose to orient yourself, now that you're at this level?

You have to learn to navigate uncharted waters.

You have to learn not only the techniques. You have to go below the surface, and acquire the tools that you can use in these situations.

You have to create your own GPS.

And as you use that GPS, it will guide you through these uncertain situations. Your GPS will never, ever change--unless you decide it needs to. You can point it to a new destination. But instead of it being calibrated with the ever changing circumstances around you, it will be pointed to the unchanging destination.

And that will be the tool that will keep you on track.

But what will keep you moving forward?
