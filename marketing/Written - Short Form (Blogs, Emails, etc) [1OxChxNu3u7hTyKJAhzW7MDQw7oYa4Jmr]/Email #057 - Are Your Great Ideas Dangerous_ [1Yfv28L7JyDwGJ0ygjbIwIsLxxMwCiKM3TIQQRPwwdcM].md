Have you ever discovered an idea so good you couldn’t let it go? It’s as if you *fall in love with the idea* and never want to leave it’s side*.* You get that glazed-over, rosey-eyed look and you feel like you’re walking on air.

Unfortunately, falling in love with an idea is dangerous when it comes to business. 

Here’s why it’s a problem. When we fall in love with an idea we often end up nurturing the product, business, or employee much longer than we should. Because we’re so emotionally invested, we can’t let it go--even if it’s proving to be unprofitable.

Of course, it’s okay if you choose to be unprofitable and still pursue the idea. Just be aware that it’s just that--it’s by your choice--and by doing so, you reduce your impact on the world.

As entrepreneurs, many of us struggle with the guilt of starting too many projects and not completing them all. Yet, continuing to hurt yourself won’t pay for that guilt. It’ll just make it worse. 

Sometimes the best thing you can do is simply cut your losses and move on.

It can be hard to let go of ideas. It’s kind of like spring cleaning your office. By cutting loose your bad ideas, you’ll suddenly find yourself feeling fresh and free again.

And that’s when you can really push to... 

Be the best you\!
