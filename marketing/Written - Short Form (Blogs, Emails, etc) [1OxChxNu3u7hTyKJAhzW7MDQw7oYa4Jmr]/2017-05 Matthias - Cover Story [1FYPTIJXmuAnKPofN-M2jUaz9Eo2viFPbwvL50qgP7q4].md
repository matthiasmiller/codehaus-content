## **On the Nature of Genius**

Do you consider yourself a genius?

No, not a messy-haired, eccentric scientist and mathematician. Not a child prodigy who graduated from college at twelve years of age. Not even someone who's the smartest or most successful person in the room.

Many of us have reduced genius to a very small, narrow definition that hardly does justice to most of the world. Most people are, by definition, quite average. And yet, within each of our DNA is a specific piece--maybe even a few small pieces--that are so unique and so powerful that they overshadow our mundane parts of normalcy.

Many times, I've heard people talk about the fact that "everyone has a genius" and "everyone has a superpower". However, people have rarely shared with me exactly how to uncover that genius in myself, much less in my team.

Building a highly-engaged, high-performing team requires people who can contribute their genius on a continual basis. Yet it seems that, more often than not, many people's genius goes untapped. They spend their time and effort in activities that provide less-than-average value, and then struggle to understand why they are depressed, underpaid, and unfulfilled.

Fortunately, this doesn't have to be.

## **Genius Exists in Multiple Dimensions**

Many entrepreneurs struggled in school, either because they found school overwhelmingly difficult or overwhelmingly easy. Many entrepreneurs struggled to fit into the system and questioned the way things were done, often getting labeled as "troublemakers" or "special needs". Not uncommonly, they faced learning disorders such as dyslexia--a condition that may be more closely linked to genius than to dysfunction.

In western culture, school traditionally measures cognitive skills in a specific area--the ability to accept information as fact and to recall it as needed. And to be able to do so equally well across a variety of different subjects.

Genius, it turns out, doesn't merely exist in the ability to memorize and recall information. It also exists in the ability to think on your feet, to find a way out of a difficult slump, or to overcome unexpected challenges on a daily basis.

And genius doesn't always exist cognitively. It can exist emotionally, with an almost uncanny ability to understand the story running inside someone else's head. It can be the awareness of other people's emotional state, and the ability to manipulate their emotions to a better place.

Genius can even be behavioral. It might be a specific instinctive response we take when we're faced with a task to accomplish.

As we look to uncover genius, it's important to look beyond cognitive skill into other dimensions.

## **Finding Genius by Contrast**

Genius always stands apart from the norm, and your genius stands in stark contrast to the rest of the world. While most of the world struggles to embrace change, you willingly embrace it. While most of the world is unaware of other's emotions, you're intensely aware. While most of the world seems content with complacency, you have an innate drive to move forward.

Finding your genius means finding the places where you stand apart from the rest of the world.

Over the past few months, I've been working with a business partner on developing a new idea. At the beginning of our relationship, we started by finding common ground--places we had similar interests and experiences.

However, we didn't start building strong momentum until we actively started uncovering ways that we were different. In one of our all-day planning sessions, we spent considerable time wading through emotionally-charged conflict. (Conflict is very productive for moving things forward, by the way.)

While most people resolve conflict through compromise, we stumbled on an entirely different approach. We navigated through the conflict until we got a clear definition of the specific differences between us, using words like "scalpel" and "sword" to develop a vivid image of the differences between us.

The entire meeting had a definite momentum shift when we clearly defined these differences. It gave both of us intense clarity on each of our personal genius.

Just like this conflict, your ability to identify your genius requires you to contrast yourself against the rest of the world, finding ways that you're specifically different.

Not a bad exercise to do for your business, either.

## **Finding Genius by Magic Combination**

Once you understand how you're different, you can strengthen your genius by finding your magic combination.

Years ago, my colleagues and I took a business trip to Iowa where we were introduced to sauerkraut pizza. Whether you like sauerkraut or not, you can be sure--it's not something you'll likely find on the menu at the average pizzeria.

Is sauerkraut rare? Not particularly. Is pizza rare? Certainly not\! However, the only time I've ever seen that combination on a menu was in a pizzeria in Iowa.

In the same way, the things that set you apart are hardly that rare when you look at them by themselves. Your genius power lies in the unique combination.

Maybe you've got a unique way of looking at problems, you've got a specific genius relating to people, and you've got deep experience in not one, but two different industries. That's the potential recipe for a magic combination.

It might be a hit or a disaster in the kitchen.

## **Genius Depends on Context**

Nobody's going to buy sauerkraut pizza if their palate is calling for chicken noodle soup on a rainy winter day.

People usually look incredibly incompetent when you put them in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even the most gifted people look surprisingly clumsy when they're in the wrong environment.

Bill Gates is a genius at building organizations and making a massive impact on the world. However, make him the host of a TV show and he'll appear an utter fool.

Many times, the difference in compensation between two people and two situations is not the innate skill but the kind of problem that they solve. Solve a scratch, and it's worth the price of a band-aid. Solve a migraine, and it's worth the price of having their life back.

Just like this newsletter.

Some of my readers are thinking about how to improve their quality of life. However, a few of them are thinking about how to better position their team into their places of genius. Not only will this improve productivity, but it will also reduce turnover, cut the cost of redoing work because of mistakes, and avoid costly accidents.

Some will reap a $100 reward, while others will reap $1000...just because of the problem that they're trying to solve.

## **Genius Depends on Team**

Almost all genius self-destructs.

The analytical CFO fails because he doesn't build emotional rapport with his team. The optimistic salesperson fails because he overestimates his own abilities. The visionary entrepreneur starts a hundred things without ever finishing them. The perfectionist builds something that's twice as expensive as the market demand because the rest of the world doesn't care about that much perfection. The wordsmith writes a brilliant story, but nobody wants to read it because it's visually unappealing.

Every genius is a double-edged sword, and we need people to offset those differences.

While I've plastered my face on the front of this newsletter, my assistant prefers to take a behind-the-scenes, out-of-the-limelight position. I'm opening new possibilities and creating chaos, while she's consistently bringing order and sanity to my life. Although she's only doing what comes naturally for her, in light of my entrepreneurial nature, she's an absolute genius. And because of her natural genius, some of my ideas now have hope of actually seeing the light of day.

In each of my team members, I've found the greatest momentum in learning the ways that they're specifically different--different from each other, but just as importantly, different from me. Because those are the places where their genius shines.

## **Practical Advice**

If you're curious about uncovering genius, I have three specific suggestions.

First of all, ask eight people across different spheres of your life, "What things can I do more easily than most people?" Pay attention to their response.

Secondly, the Kolbe A Index (multiplier.link/kolbe) can be profoundly helpful piece in understanding yourself and specific team members. It's a scientifically validated measurement of behavioral instinct, something that's rarely measured or identified in assessments.

Third, keep looking for helpful distinctions between people. This article covers a number of them (starter vs. finisher, empathy vs. analytics). However, finding the right distinctions can provide

Keep learning, keep growing, keep pursuing. Search out the people and places that allow you to rely on your innate genius. As you find your people, your environment, and your unique genius, you'll position yourself to make your biggest impact on the world.
