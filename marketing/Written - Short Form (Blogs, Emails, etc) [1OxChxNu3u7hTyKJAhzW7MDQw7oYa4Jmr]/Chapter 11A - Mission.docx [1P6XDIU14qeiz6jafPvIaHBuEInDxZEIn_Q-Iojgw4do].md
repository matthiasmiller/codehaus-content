# **Chapter: Mission: Your Hands**

When you have a big dream of what you want to accomplish, many people don't know exactly what this dream should look like, or they have trouble establishing the specifics.

As you move into new arenas, the way to remain oriented is to operate, not based on your circumstances but based on fixed reference points, such as your values, your purpose, and your vision.

Each of those elements is independent of what you do. They relate to your heart and to what you see in the future. But the mission is what you do with your hands. This is the embodiment of what you do. It's how you implement it. Every life has different seasons, and you how you serve your purpose and how you serve your vision will vary based on the season of life that you're in.

However, even within each season, you have certain clues that will help you navigate what you should focus on and where you should go. Many people don't even take the time to consider the most valuable assets and the most valuable things they bring to the table for their dreams. They continually struggle accomplishing what they need to accomplish, because it's so contrary to their intrinsic design.

You have a unique and special design, and the more that you can leverage that, the more smoothly you will function. Your unique and special design is one of those guideposts that you can follow. The challenge, of course, is not to chase others' definition of success, but to follow as best as you can, the success that is natural to you.

## **Personality**

You have a unique personality. How you relate to the world around you is different from others. Learning about your own personality is a key in being able to determine what kinds of roles are the right roles for you to pursue.

Many different models exist to describe your personality, but a simple model is the DISC profile. It simply categorizes people into four quadrants:

* Task-Oriented vs. Person-Oriented

* Higher-Energy vs. Lower-Energy

## **High-Energy, Task-Oriented**

For example, if you are a task-oriented person, you derive a lot of satisfaction from measurable results. You like to get things done. Although you value relationships with other people, you prefer tasks and facts.

If you are a high-energy, task-oriented person, you will always be pushing for new things, for progress, for change. You will be pushing the envelope and accomplishing new things. You want and crave disruption. You prefer to see the big picture, because you dare not waste your time on the details.  
 You weakness, however, will be that you leave things undone, that you don't follow through with your commitments. You will find yourself sloughing over details that really need to be thought through. You will need to learn to demonstrate to other people that you value them, because other personality types will assume that you don't care because you don't communicate in their language.

## **High-Energy, Person-Oriented**

If you are person-oriented, people around you matter highly. If you're a higher-energy, person-oriented, you are the life of the party. You are the natural salesperson, the natural motivator, the natural inspirer.

Your challenge is not to live for the approval of other people. You are the life of the party, and you love being liked by everyone, making it difficult when others don't accept you or accept your influence.

## **Lower-Energy, Task-Oriented**

However, if you are a lower-energy, task oriented person, you will prefer working with numbers and facts. You like to see the way all the facts work together, and you know that details matter.

Your challenge will be your tendency to get caught in the detail and lose sight of the bigger picture of what you are doing.

## **Lower-Energy, Person-Oriented**

The lower-energy, person-oriented, also loves people, but they are the compassionate ones. They are the ones who slow down to listen to people, to show them they care. They are the ones who make sure that all the people are cared for, making people feel heard and listened to.

Your challenge is being willing to embrace conflict when necessary, and doing the uncomfortable thing when it's the right thing. It means courageously sharing the truth about situations, even when you know it will hurt others' feelings or it will introduce conflict.

## **Capitalize Strengths, Protect Weaknesses**

Even though all of us are able to adapt our personalities to some degree, we are limited to how well and how long we can do that. Doing it over an extended period of time will lead to frustration and burnout. It's important to learn how to adapt in order to gain influence on others around you, but it's also important to learn how to be free yourself in your personality.

Obviously, this means two things. First you must recognize your personal strengths. You must learn what the specific strengths are of your personality style, and you must learn to adapt to them. For example, if you love number and detail, you might not want to take a role that requires you to be outgoing, interacting daily with lots of new people. Similarly, if you like accomplishing new things and pushing the envelope as a higher-energy, task-oriented person, I beg of you, do not join the accounting department.

Many people are stuck in situations that are completely contrary to their personality. However, they justify it because they don't know any better. They burn out, trying to make themselves love a situation that they will never become better at. The problem isn't them. The problem is the situation, and moving into a situation that plays to your personality will allow you to flow more intrinsically with your work.

You must capitalize your strengths, but you must also learn to protect your weaknesses. The best way is simply to surround yourself with other personality types, and allow their strengths to compensate for your weaknesses.

## **Introvert vs. Extrovert**

Consider whether you are an introvert or an extrovert. It seems that many people today value extroversion. We value people who are outgoing, and we assume that such people are charismatic, magnetic, and successful. Both introversion and extroversion have their own unique strengths.

If you are an introvert, one of your significant strengths is your ability to process ideas. Introversion does not diminish your ability to lead. In fact, if used properly, it can bolster your leadership.

Learn to manage your introversion and extroversion, and it will serve you well. Determine to work against it, and you'll find yourself constantly fighting who you are.

If you are an introvert, seek out work that lets you be in low stimulating environments. Look for one-on-one interactions. Look for things that allow you to work by yourself in a corner.

If you are an extrovert, seek out work in a high stimulating environment. Look for group interactions, lots of activity, lots of noise, and lots of movement.

If you're an extrovert, please don't lock yourself behind a desk in the back office. Please\! You'll drive yourself crazy, and you'll end up driving everyone around you crazy\!

## **Capitalize on Your Strengths**

Just like following your personality, you must also learn to follow your personal strengths. Instead of trying to capitalize on your weaknesses, focus on your strengths.

If you focus on bolstering your weaknesses, you will not be able to bolster yourself to be someone who is truly incredible at what you do. You will merely replicate the rest of the world at a mediocre level, and you will always be dissatisfied with your results.

The truth is that successful people are intensely focused on one or two things that they are really great at. You were born with intrinsic strengths and talents, and to become outstanding at what you do, you must learn to focus your attention and energy on those things.

If you haven't taken the time to discover, take time right now to consider the things that you are really good at:

---

---

---

---

---

These are the things that you need to start focusing on. These are the things that you must devote your attention to. Don't try to be great at what everyone else is great at. Be great at something that only you can be great at.

Don't replicate success. Generate your own, authentic success.

## **Your Burning Interest**

Most of all, allow yourself to pursue things that interest you. Many people stop short of pursing everything they could be because they get caught up in other peoples' agendas.

But when you were a child, you were free to explore. You were free to be you. Nobody criticized you for having one favorite color instead of another. And all those other silly criticisms--about you needing to read instead of play a sport, or needing to love numbers when you prefer history--all of those criticisms were just wrong.

Allow yourself to follow your interest, and allow yourself to go deep into that interest. Again, hyper-focus will yield significant results, and becoming the best in your field often means focusing specifically on the one or two things that you are the best at.

Do you even know the things that interest you the most? What are the things that keep compelling you to action, to keep taking steps forward?

What are the things that you read about or do, without any instruction? What are the things that you do, that you love so thorough that you'd do them for free?

Take a few minutes and write some of them down:

---

---

---

---

---

Those are the things that you can be truly successful at.

Don't spend your life living bored. Learn to step past the status quo, learn to break out of the mold of everyone else's ideas for you, and learn to become your best self.

## **Clarifying Your Mission**

You've identified some of your personality traits, some of your strengths, and some of your burning interests. If you were to put hands and feet to your values, your purpose, and your vision, what would it look like? What would you do?

This is where you develop the overarching mission for what you do. This is where you find words to describe the specifics of what you do.

If your vision is to empower a million business leaders, your mission can be through designing beautiful inspiration quotes or by writing a book. Either one of these can fully support your vision, but one of those will more closely support your unique strengths.

If your vision is to transform culture, your mission can be to raise world-changing sons and daughters, or your mission can be to develop a technological platform to make it happen. Again, these are vastly different applications. But they serve the same vision.

The mission must be something tangible that you can do. It's no longer the overarching principles guiding your life. It's the clarification of what your role must be in this current season of life. It's giving teeth to what you really what to do.

Again, take time to reflect on some of the things that you've written in previous chapters, as well as some of the answers you've provided in this chapter. Take a few moments to consider. How does this apply to you? What are specific things that you want to focus on to accomplish this vision?

---

---

---

Take a few moments to clarify your mission statement. This mission statement may only be for a few years, or it may be for a decade. It will change, because as your season of life changes, how you implement your vision may change. However, you will always remain true to your vision.

Right now, for your current season of life, what is your mission? (Do this step\! Do not skip ahead\!)
