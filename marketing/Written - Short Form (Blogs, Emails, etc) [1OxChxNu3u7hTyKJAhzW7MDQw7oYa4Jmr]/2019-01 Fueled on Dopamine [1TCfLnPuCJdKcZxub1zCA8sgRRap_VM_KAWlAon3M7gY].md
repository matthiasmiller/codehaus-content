It’s been over 2 years since I eliminated caffeine from my life. Although I started by switching to decaf coffee, I eventually ended up eliminating all caffeine consumption because I saw the clear benefit to my mental clarity and physical energy.

When I wrote about my journey, I called it a "silent killer" because caffeine subtly yet powerfully affects so many parts of our lives. Since that time, I've been surprised to see the ripple effects throughout my life. I've become physiologically aware of the impact of sugar on my body, and I've been making small changes to improve my diet.

Without knowing it, I had been quenching my thirst with coffee. Since I've quit consuming caffeine, I've been drinking significantly more water. I easily drink 50 ounces of water before breakfast, and sometimes more. Depending on your sources, that's getting close to the "daily recommended amount".

I've also started guarding myself against blue light in the evening. This is a spectrum of light that prevents the body's production of melatonin, a chemical that tells your body it's time to relax and fall asleep. Simply put, protecting myself from blue light in the evening allows me to sleep much more deeply.

Yes, I have geeky orange glasses that let me do this.

These three changes--eliminating caffeine, drinking more water, and protecting myself from blue light at night--have allowed me to sleep much deeper and to have more consistent, sustained energy throughout my day.

On those nights I only get 5 hours of sleep, I feel better than I used to with 7\.

Those two hours are not simply about cramming in more activity or sleeping less. It's about improving my quality of life. While I value having additional time when I need it, I value having additional energy even more.

And this entire journey started six months ago when I decided to eliminate caffeine.

## **Silent Killers Have a Ripple Effect**

Silent killers are deadly not just because you can't see them, but also because they are viral. They affect many different areas of your life that aren't immediately visible.

However, silent killers aren't only physical. Just as crucial are the silent killers that are emotional.

In today's world, it's far more popular to discuss marketing tactics, productivity tools, or life-hacks, than to discuss the impact of your emotional health on your business leadership.

Just like they consume caffeine as a stimulant, people consume other substances--just as toxic--as a way to motivate themselves. Rather than destroying them physically, they allow these to eat away their emotional health.

Every New Year the local gym turns into a beehive of activity. Have you ever noticed how many of those people disappear by the end of March? What happened?

I've noticed people often look to three emotional stimulants for motivation.

## **First, they look to fear.**

Often, the fear of losing.

When they're in the gym, they're scared of losing their health, losing their good looks, losing their chance at the man or woman of their dreams, losing their reputation with their peers, or losing their opportunity to make the team.

When it's business, they're scared of losing their business, losing their clients, losing their house, losing their team, losing control...and if they notice it soon enough, sometimes even scared of losing their family.

This drug puts people in flight.

## **Second, they look to anger.**

When they're in the gym, they're angry at other people's hurtful comments, at the genetics that defy them, at the difficult challenges they face in life, and at the way they've been mistreated.

In business, they're angry at the vendors who don't meet their expectations, at their team members who never want to listen to instructions, at their parents who told them they would never amount to anything, at the customers who are always sneaking things out the front door, or at their competitors for providing a better experience.

Sometimes, when they have nothing else to be angry at, they simply choose to be angry at life.

This drug brings people to fight.

## **Third, they look to hype.**

At the gym, it means cranking up the tunes and dancing a little bit before you hop onto the treadmill.

In business, it means listening to an upbeat song before you tackle a hard project or starting your day with a motivational video--something to inspire you to action.

Don't get me wrong, there's something to be said about intentionally raising your level of energy. However, it often becomes a substitute--a way to mask an underlying issue.

If you're struggling to finish your workout, you may push through your personal barrier with a little bit of hype. However, you may also push yourself to the point of harm.

If you're struggling to finish a task at work, you may be able to complete it with a little bit of hype. However, you may also be forcing yourself out of your strengths, increasing your stress, and yes, even bringing physical harm.

Hype is the drug that puts people into a frenzy.

## **Fourth, they look to shame.**

Shame doesn’t say, "You failed" but rather, "You're a failure." It doesn’t criticize actions: it attacks identity.

When they're in the gym, it whispers to them, "You're fat. You're a loser. You'll never amount to anything. You're weak. You're unmotivated. You're a failure."

When they're in business, it whispers to them, "You're a loser. You're not smart enough to do what you do. Nobody likes you. Your voice doesn't matter. You're foolish for not seeing the crisis before it happened."

While shame motivates some to work hard to overachieve, it paralyzes others.

## **These emotions are toxic.**

All of these emotions can be powerful, short-term boosts. However, they also escalate your body into stress. Over time, they will mask what's really going on, numb you to how you're really doing, and encourage you to self-destruct. They will destroy relationships, sabotage opportunities, and cause short-sighted decisions.

Emotions are contagious.

In his book *Primal Leadership*, Daniel Goleman shares the study of colleagues in a meeting. While their emotions were varied at the beginning of the meeting, within an hour or two, their emotions converged to match the leader's emotional state.

If you're fearful, your team will become anxious as well. If you're frenzied, your team will become less strategic. If you live with shame, your team will reflect it.

Your customers will feel it when they walk in the door. They will sense it when they talk on the phone. And they'll respond accordingly.

Fortunately, your customers will also feel when things are going right.

## **We need to move from "fight or flight" to "dopamine" fuel.**

Six months ago, I didn't realize caffeine kicked me into "fight or flight". However, as I've let caffeine go, I've noticed other things do the same.

The anxiety about a big project that's not progressing quickly enough. The shame about delegating work to a team member, allowing someone who's well-suited to the task see the ways I'd completely botched it.

I've begun to see these "fight or flight" symptoms early, and I've started to fight them vigorously. Instead, there's another fuel.

It's called dopamine.

It's highly addictive and it will either work for or against you. In the right amount and from the right source, it becomes a powerful means of building momentum. However, when it's awry, it'll throw you into self-destructive behaviors.

It will either compel you to build a strong emotional and sexual relationship with your significant other or to a porn addiction. It will either compel you to take a walk after lunch, or to eat a sugar-laden Snickers bar in the afternoon. It will either compel you take a calculated risk in your business or to make a gamble on a loss. It will either compel you to have a brief conversation with a colleague or to pull out your cell phone and check for notifications.

All of those release dopamine and all of them form an addiction.

You get to choose the kind of addiction you'll build.

## **Contribution is the best motivator.**

However, you'll never tap into it beneath the noise of these "fight or flight" emotions.

As you start letting go of the fear, anger, hype, and shame, you'll find yourself slowing down. But don’t just stop there or you’ll stall.

As you start building your motivation around making a contribution to the people around you, taking healthy risks, and developing strong and healthy relationships, you'll find yourself pulled forward by a steady, strong force.

You will find yourself compelled by a healthy, even stronger motivation, and making clearer and better long-term decisions. You'll reduce your stress and may even extend your lifespan.

Most importantly, you'll be more effective doing the thing you were born to do--building a business and making a contribution to the lives of others.

Let's live our lives fueled by contribution.
