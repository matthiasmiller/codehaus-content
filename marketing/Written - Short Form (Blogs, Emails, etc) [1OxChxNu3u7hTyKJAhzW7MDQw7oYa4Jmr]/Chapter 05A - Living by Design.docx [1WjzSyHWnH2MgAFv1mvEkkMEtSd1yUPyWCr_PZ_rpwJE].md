# **Chapter: Your Design**

One of the most common responses of people, when asked on their deathbed what they regretted the most about their lives, replied, "Following other people's expectations and not being true to myself."

Right now, you have to decide whether you're going to live without regret, and whether you're going to embrace who you were designed to be.

Whenever you have a piece of machinery, you always try to get it to work the way that it was designed. When this happens, you have less wear on the machinery, and much greater usefulness and longevity.

What happens when you live outside of your design?

We as humans are incredibly capable of adapting, learning new skills, and taking on new values. However, sometimes we pressure ourselves into becoming something or someone that we are not, and that prevents us from being the best that we can be.

Learning to embrace your personal design--who you were created to be--is a critical piece to embracing an approach to life that will truly serve you towards success.

If you don't embrace this, you will be just like the machinery--gears grinding, wearing themselves down, being ineffective and doing what you were made to do.

## **Where we lose track**

There's a fine line between a mentor and an idol, and there's a finer line between learning from someone else and pursuing their success.

Your success will be completely unique to your abilities, your passions, and your values. This means that, if you're going to live with full integrity to yourself, you will never replicate someone else's success. The trouble begins when you start comparing yourself with other people.

You find a superstar in whatever field you are, and you begin to model them. At the beginning, your goal is simply to imitate them, and then your goal is to match their level of success. But somewhere in the journey, we lose track of who we are and who we are supposed to be.

We unwittingly try to start winning at someone else's game

This is where it all has to stop, and you have to turn it all on your head. You have to embrace the fact that your race is not against thousands of other people. Your race is primarily against yourself. You are not trying to be the best Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, or Mother Theresa.

You are trying to be the best version of yourself.

What are the things that make you authentically you?

## **Breaking the Inner Hate**

Do you remember the things you hated about yourself as a kid? It looks silly now, but I did. I was the kid with the pale white face and the freckles on his nose.

I was also the kid who knew was learning how to program Pascal in the third grade, but that wasn't enough to make me feel better. If anything, it made me feel worse--yep, it just confirmed that I was the geek.

Today, I've grown up, my freckles have gone away, and I'm happy to be the person who I am. But I've played this same game in my own grownup world.

I have a deep, unshakable passion for bringing change. The world needs growth, it needs movers and shakers. But for a period of my life--I hated that--because I that innate drive was threatening to people who didn't know me well.

Since then, I've tempered that drive. I've made it more palatable. I've been more sensitive to other people. I've focused more on learning how to influence other people based on where they are right now. But that inner drive still remains within me.

Something deep in my core wants to reform the way we look at life. I want to challenge our deeply-held assumptions about how we live our lives and how we look at the world. I've seen this desire first as a gift, then as a curse, and finally as a gift again.

I've had to unravel this question, "Who am I, really?" And I've had to answer the question, "Am I willing to embrace who I really am?" I've had to break my inner discomfort with who I am, with my gifting.

Wresting through these issues are exactly what you ned to do to come to grips with where you want to be.

## **Who Am I...Really?**

Somewhere between the innocence of childhood and the grownup world of adulthood, we learn to hide part of who we are. We learn that to be accepted and liked by other people., to be successful in parts of the world, we must be inauthentic. We must present ourselves as something other than who we truly are.

And as we embrace this lie, we begin to drift further and further from who we truly are, until we lose all reference. All that we know is that we have a deep emptiness inside of ourselves, that we are frustrated at life (maybe even ourselves), and that we have a gnawing sense that there is more to life than what we are living.

I have three older brothers. I was the youngest in my family, and as I grew up, I wanted to find my way in the world, but I had no clue who I wanted to be. Unwittingly, I embraced the dreams of my oldest brother, and fortunately followed them to a very quick dead-end. Unwittingly, I embraced the dreams of my next brother, and finally my last brother--chasing each one until I had reached a dead end.

People around me could see it wasn't working, but sometimes I think I was the last one to realize. When I finally realized that none of these dreams were for me, I had the ask myself this question. It was not merely an intellectual question. It was a deeply-rooted emotional question--"Who am I...really?"

"If you take me outside of my family and you allow me to be my own authentic self, who am I?"

That was literally what set me on the journey of finding out what things deeply matter to me. It is what set me on the journey of my own path, but it required me rejecting a lot of things that weren't me. Most surprisingly, the things that I had thought were valuable to me earlier started slipping away. I realized just how many dreams I had embraced that really weren't my own, and the more that I pursued my own dreams, the more that I realized that I loved being who I am.

You must first give yourself permission to completely you. Here's a little journaling exercise for you. Stop right now, and take three minutes:

* Make a column of all the things that you are currently doing or pursing that do not feel authentic to you.

* Beside them, list the best reason you can give explaining why they don't feel authentic to you.

* Ask yourself the question, "How is my perspective broken about this?"

Sometimes, we have a deep-rooted perception of a role that prevents us from embracing it. For me, it was sales. My perception of salesperson was always highly manipulative, slightly-dishonest, and definitely annoying. In no way was I able to become someone like that.

I realized that I didn't feel authentic, however, it wasn't because of what I was doing. It was about my mindset that I approached it in. I learned that as I changed my mindset of sales, what it was, who I should be, it truly was a great fit for me.

"Who are you...really?"

That's question that must burn deep and long in your mind, because the answer is buried underneath layers of obligations that you've lived under, layers of lies that you've believed about yourself. Your must learn to unravel them.

## **Am I willing to embrace who I truly am?**

One of the most common reasons salespeople have difficulty embracing their role is because of family and social pressure. Being a doctor seems smart and noteworthy and successful. Being a salesperson doesn't.

Most likely, that same question haunts you. You have to decide whether you are willing to let go of your need to impress others so that you can be truly authentic. I cannot guarantee that success or wealth come from authenticity, but I can guarantee you that you will live a life with much fewer regrets.

Underlying the need to live with someone else's approval is a much deeper, much more intrinsic need. It is the need to be unconditionally loved and unconditionally accepted, and until you receive that, you'll always be tempted to change who you are so that you become worthy of love and acceptance. You need to have supportive friends, but most importantly, you need to be supportive to yourself.

The process is painful. It means learning to accept yourself for who you are, living life as if you were completely willing to give yourself a hug at any moment. Not because you're self-absorbed, but because you know your worth as an individual, you know the worth of the dreams and destiny in your life, and because you know that you have a Creator who has spoken your worth.

The process is scary. You don't know whether these dreams that you have will work out. You don't even know if you have the right dreams. All that you know is that you are on a journey to become the best version of yourself that you can be. You are meant to stand out in the crowd, not because you are the flashiest or the brightest, but because you are so incredibly unique. And it takes boldness to be authentic.

## **Getting an outside perspective**

If you have close friends who care about you, sometimes the best thing that you can do is to invite them out to coffee, sit down, and have a conversation with them. ask them to give you feedback about who you are, at your deepest core.

You're not asking them to define you. You're asking them to give you their perspective of who you are, and the things that matter to you.

Sometimes we are so close to ourselves that we fail to see the things that deeply matter to us. We fail to see the things that, to everyone else, are so core to who we are.

Just to make it easier for you, I'll give you some great questions you can ask:

1. When you think about the things that excite and energize me, what comes to mind?

2. What are some things that I'm doing that seem out of character to me?

3. If you could use five words to describe the core of who I am, what would they be?

Probe. Ask. Wonder. Get curious.

You'll never be able to see yourself from another perspective. You will always have to find someone else who is willing to do that for you. The insights to those questions can be powerful., because they remind you of things that you've forgotten or things that you've left by the side of the road.

## **Recall your dreams**

In the book *The Dream Manager*, Matthew Kelly suggests that people make a list of 100 of their dreams. Just sit down, and just write. Don't give yourself room to analyze. Don't give yourself room to think or explain it away. Just do it.

Those dreams will give insight into some of your deepest desires. Some of the dreams may even be painful for you to consider dreaming about, because you've received so much opposition towards them. However, the dreams with which you've received the most opposition can also be the dreams with which you can make the biggest impact on yourself and on the world around you.

You were born to dream, and your dreams carry your DNA. If you forget how to dream, you forget how to be authentically yourself. You must not forget how to dream. Every single day, you must learn how to inspire yourself, because without it, you will not achieve your destiny.
