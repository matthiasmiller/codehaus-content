Let me explain:

Visions are like frogs that undergo metamorphosis. Although they start out looking like tadpoles, they turn into something very different. While retaining the same DNA throughout the process, new visions look as different from their result as a frog does from a tadpole.

Multiply Your Strengths is going through such a metamorphosis. The DNA of the original vision is still intact. I’m passionate to help people succeed, but the outworking of how I do that is changing.

In short, I am switching from a "personal development and coaching" focus to a "business services focus."

Although the core values and concepts in my emails will continue to be the same, the focus will be business. The services I provide will be related to business.

Since I am not interested in cluttering your inbox, I am giving you the heads-up and the invitation to unsubscribe.

However, if this new focus will be valuable to you or your business, the door is wide open.

Thanks for journeying with me\!

As you experience your own joys and challenges of metamorphosis, always remember…

Be the best you\!

PS: I’d love to hear from you\! How are your visions undergoing metamorphosis?
