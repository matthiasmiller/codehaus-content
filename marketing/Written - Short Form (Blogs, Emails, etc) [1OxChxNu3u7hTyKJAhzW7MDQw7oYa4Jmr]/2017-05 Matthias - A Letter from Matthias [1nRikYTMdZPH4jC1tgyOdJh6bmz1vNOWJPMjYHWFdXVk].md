**TARGET: 175**

I wrote this month's cover article at 3:00 in the morning. Nope, it wasn't some hardcore work ethic. My son woke up in the dead of night with an earache. He fell back asleep on the couch with his blanket while I wrote my first draft in the glow of my minimalistic orange-on-black, distraction-free text editor.

It reminded me that anything of value requires sacrifice. The truly great leaders not only find something worth sacrificing for, but they also invite others to make the sacrifice with them.

Our lives take on an intensity of focus and dedication when we begin to live them for something that we truly value. I'm convinced our greatest impact can happen long after we're gone. The greatest gift we might give the world is the legacy we leave behind.

Whether in our work or in our rest, let's choose to be driven not only by our short-term gain but also by our long-term impact. Even if it means waking up at 3:00 in the morning.
