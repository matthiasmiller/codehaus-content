# **Primal Chiropractics and Why Those Pesky Problems Won't Go Away**

Several years ago I began to experience excruciating pain in my back. Every night, I carefully crawled into bed to prevent the pain from shooting through my body. At work, I'd alternate between standing and sitting, trying to find relief from the constant pain.

My wife and I had a one-year-old daughter at the time. I couldn't carry her without collapsing in pain. My wife shouldered the burden--quite literally.

First time in her life that she'd been married to an old man, she told me.

At first, I thought I'd be Mr. Tough Guy. You know, just muscle through it, and it'll be okay. I'd never had serious back pain in my life, so why start now?

However, it continued to bother me. In fact, it continued getting worse. I began taking pain killers here and there to help stave off the pain.

## **The Power of Force**

Meanwhile, my wife was getting tired of carrying the kids. She (with the help of our family doctor) finally talked me into getting a chiropractor appointment.

The first one of my life.

Six months in, and my Tough Guy image was definitely crumbling.

When I finally scheduled my appointment, the chiropractor met with me and started asking questions about the pain.

She then began to massage my back, trying to loosen up my muscles. Half an hour later, she pulled one leg in one direction, held the other one, gave a healthy yank, and said, "You're good to go\!"

I hobbled out of the office, unsure what to think of the experience. I knew the chiropractor was highly trained, definitely skilled, and certainly experienced.

However, I never went back.

Why?

Most likely, the problem wasn't that she didn't have SOME answers.

The problem was that I didn't TRUST that she fully understood what was going on. And while I didn't have the words at the time, I wasn't convinced that she was solving the ROOT of the problem.

That's why I reached out to the second chiropractor--one who was getting rave reviews from many people.

## **The Power of Analysis**

As soon as I walked into the second chiropractor's patient room, I knew I was in for a different experience.

He, too, began by assessing the situation and asking questions. However, he introduced me to a new piece of technology I'd never heard of before--Sigma Instrument. This electronic device precisely measured whether my spine was in alignment, then applied gentle, calculated adjustments to get it back to alignment.

Did this method work?

To be honest, I don't know for sure, but one thing I could tell:

This doctor was serious about getting to the root of the issue instead of dilly-dallying around with symptoms.

I continued visiting him every week. Each week, he gave me basic exercises to help increase mobility and decrease pain.

Most of them improved my situation a little bit. However, when my situation didn't improve as quickly as he'd hoped, he encouraged me to get an x-ray to ensure I didn't have any structural damage in my hip and lower back.

Fortunately, the x-ray came back clear. Things slowly became better, but I still wasn't completely pain free or completely mobile.

The answer came out of the blue.

## **The Power of Strategy**

Nearly one year into my back pain, I traveled three hours to attend a conference. That evening, the speaker held a book signing. Hundreds of attendees jumped into line.

Me?

I didn't really care that much about his signature. However, I had someone I wanted to connect him to, so I grabbed a book and slipped in line.

As I was waiting in line, the person behind me struck up a conversation. It started with a simple question, "What do you do?"

As I began to explain my professional background, his mouth dropped open.

The next 3 hours, we dove deeply into cellular function, neuroscience, blue light toxicity, technology, and the wonders of the human body.

We got our autographs, then hung out in the lobby.

The venue closed up for the night, so we relocated to an IHOP around the corner.

Around midnight, as we wrapped up our conversation over green Grinch Mint Hot Chocolates, the gentleman told me, "Thank you so much for your insight. I'm a chiropractor, so let me know if there's any way I can help."

Now it was MY turn for my mouth to drop open.

"Well, you know, there's this one thing..."

I shared the pain I'd been experiencing in my back. He, too, asked a handful of questions.

He whipped out his phone, pulled up a muscular diagram. "Your hip flexors are tight," he told me. "It's pulling your lower back out of place. Search the Internet for the pigeon stretch."

I scratched a few words on my notepad, and we said goodbye.

Something inside me stirred with hope.

Why?

Not only did my newfound friend correctly assess my situation, he was able to pin-point the ROOT of my back pain.

Over the next few weeks, I began a disciplined regimen of doing these stretches. I could immediately tell a difference.

My chiropractor visits began becoming less frequent. A few months later, I stopped seeing him altogether.

## **The Problem Beneath the Problem**

This experience became a profound insight into the problems that leaders face on a daily basis.

Each time I attempted to solve my back pain, I took it deeper and deeper.

To start with, I used pain killers to alleviate the pain when it became unbearable. This simply dealt with the symptom.

Then, I began dealing with the issues with my back, trying to extend the muscles in my back to keep them in alignment.

Finally, I dealt with the real root of the issue--hip flexors that had become tight as a fiddle string because of the hours I'd spent biking.

The exercises I needed to do had nothing to do with my back. I needed mobility and flexibility in my legs. As I began the recommended exercises, my back pain began to vanish.

Every leader is on their own stage of the process:

1. Some are still denying the issue and silencing the symptoms.  
2. Some are trying to resolve the symptoms.  
3. Some are trying to do analysis and provide calculated fixes.  
4. Some are trying to find the root of the problem.

Which stage are you on?

In fact, here's an easy way you can tell. Think about the big challenge you're facing right now. How are you attempting to solve it?

1. Are you trying to use force, external rewards, systems, and policies to fix issues?  
2. Are you trying to implement what other people have done to solve similar problems?  
3. Are you doing analysis and careful calculation to figure out how to engineer the solution?  
4. Are you relying on strategy to find the root issue that's underneath it all?

I'll be honest. If you're still on Stage 1, you might not be ready to hear the lessons that I'll be unpacking. However, if you're open to moving further down the process, you'll find a depth of insight into the challenges you're facing.

## **The Professional Development Crack Addiction**

I want to warn you.

The world is full of people selling aspirin for organizations in pain. Tactical suggestions that will supposedly solve the issue of the challenges they face.

Assessments. Software. Trainings. Workshops.

By the way, this type of advice sells. When the organization is doing well, these tools often add fuel to the fire. However, when the organization has root issues that remain unaddressed, these tools become a distraction (and sometimes a hindrance) to the full health of the organization.

As humans, we have a crack addiction to easy, instant answers and silver bullets.

And there's a line of people at your door who are willing to sell those to you, all day long, as long as you're willing to buy.

Just like a crack addiction, though, it doesn't solve the problem. You must keep coming back for more.

Good for the dealer. Bad for the user.

Digging into the root issue is hard work, which is why most people don't do it. But the rewards are tremendous.

## **Letting Go of the World As It Should Be**

Chasing after root issues requires you to start embracing reality. As you move from the first stages to the final stages, you begin to surrender the urge to fight reality. You stop denying it and you start partnering with it instead.

You stop forcing people and situations to be something they're not. You start looking for what you, your organization, and your people were created for. You eliminate the things that are pushing it out of alignment, or you simply choose to step into alignment.

Let me give you an example.

Have you ever had a leader who tried desperately to convince you of a certain decision, and you wanted nothing to do with it? This is an example of someone who's fighting reality--trying to convince you of something you're not convinced of. And it doesn't work\!

What about the leader who shows genuine appreciation for you, seeks to understand your budget, your wants, your needs, your desires? As you feel understood, you find yourself opening up to this person. And you find yourself looking for ways to help the leader with his or her vision\!

That's an example of alignment.

It's an example of embracing reality.

After all, the highest level of persuasion, leadership, and influence is not getting someone to change their mind. It's helping them achieve what they were created for.

If you're unwilling to embrace reality, to let go of your need to control every outcome, these lessons are not for you.

However, if you're willing to let go of that power and control, you'll find (quite ironically) that the power and control comes straight back to you. But sometimes, you must put that out of your mind FIRST, so that you can get your head on straight.

If you're still committed to solving your problems at the root, let's dig into the definition of health and why it's so important.

## **Harnessing the Power of Alignment**

When I wrestled with my back pain, my biggest battle was not finding ways to deal with the symptoms. My biggest challenge was finding reality, then aligning myself with reality to solve the problem.

In the same way, many people and organizations struggle because they fail to recognize this single truth:

Health is a function of alignment.

Poor health means something (a disease, virus, or in my case, a tight muscle) is bringing your body out of alignment. Want to get back to health?

Find out what's bringing your body out of alignment, fix it, and allow it to come back into alignment.

In the same way, many leaders are struggling with challenges in their organization, such as:

* a declining or aging donor base  
* lack of involvement in existing programs  
* turnover with long-term staff  
* cash flow crisis  
* executive director burnout

It's tempting to start with these issues. However, these issues are only symptoms of the real problem. The real problems lie beneath the surface.

The real problems are in places that the organization is out of alignment. And as long as the organization remains out of alignment, you will continue to fight the same symptoms every single day of your leadership career.

Every successful organization has been able to first create alignment with the world that is around them. Second of all, they have created alignment with the people they have within them.

Organizations become healthy by creating alignment. When they are healthy, they will continue to naturally grow. When they are unhealthy, they'll begin to deteriorate.

The most important thing you can do as a leader is ensure that your organization and your people are healthy. Do that, and you'll see it prosper.

Neglect it to your peril.

## **The Untapped Power of Strategy**

You might be wondering, "What does this practically mean? How do you identify the places in your organization that are out of alignment, and how do you fix them?"

Trust me--we'll get to that in a future edition. I don't want you to miss using this powerful tool that you've learned.

This is not merely a tool for your toolbox. This is a lens through which you can look at the world. When you wear these glasses, you will see people, situations, problems, and opportunities differently.

Why?

Because you've just learned about a powerful tool that is often misunderstood: strategy.

Strategy is about finding the root issue that's driving all of the symptoms, finding the simplest solution for that root issue, and applying it.

It's about solving the problems of your organization at the highest possible level.

It's creating alignment with the world around you and the world within you.

It's also about giving you your life and your organization back. Of all the approaches to problem solving that I've tried, it is by far the most effective. And the easiest. And the most efficient.

It's one of the most freeing things you can possibly do. So freeing, in fact, that many people throw it out as hogwash. "Too good to be true," they say.

That's on them, though--not on you.

Before you is an open door. It will require you to think, to reflect, to challenge assumptions, to question reality. If you choose to step through this door, you'll be shocked by the world that opens up to you.

This is not merely another tool in your toolbox. This is a lens through which you look at the world. When you look at the world through these lenses, you'll find your situations coming into crystal clear focus. You'll address challenges and opportunities in your organization, with your team, and even with your family, completely differently.

Make the choice today.

You won't regret it.
