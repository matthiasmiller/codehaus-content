As a leader or entrepreneur, what does it mean to become everything that you were meant to be?

It doesn't come through simple, easy answers. It comes through challenges, trials by fire, and living life in relationship with others.

As I mention in the Real Life column, my wife and I faced some challenging situations recently. While we've never intentionally pursued difficulty, we haven't run from it either.

It's tough, especially when you face situations you can't discuss with your neighbors over barbeque. I know how isolated leaders can feel at times, like nobody really "gets" the challenges you face on a daily basis.

I hope that in some small way, this newsletter makes you feel more understood, like less of an enigma, and a little more like a real human being.

Do yourself a favor and brew yourself a fresh cup of coffee (or hot chocolate, tea, or water for political correctness) and take a few minutes to recharge and focus on yourself.

You're not alone\!
