I goofed.

Gary (name changed) is the pastor of a small church who also has a big heart for the poor. Not only does he work with the underprivileged in his own community but also with those in other countries. Being a typical entrepreneurial visionary, he tackles every new project vigorously.

He first approached us a few years ago while working on a new outreach. The vision was simple: allow people to feed the hungry for the price of one coffee drink per month. At the time, he needed nearly a thousand donors to reach his goal.

As we talked, we uncovered three specific objectives:

1. Build a fresh brand for this outreach that leverages his existing logo.  
2. Prove to his supporters that he's legit, not a fly-by-night organization buried in the back corner of a basement.  
3. Show his supporters the heart-rending yet hope-filled pictures of the people he was trying to help.

To do this, Gary needed a website that not only could meet these objectives, but was also simple enough to update himself. Given these requirements, it was a pretty straightforward project.

That's when I goofed.

As he shared his vision, I began to see its potential.

Managing a thousand donors is no small task, and securing monthly donations brings valuable income to a non-profit. Therefore, I suggested he allow his donors to set up monthly donations on his website, not only ensuring donations every month but also allowing them to streamline their bookkeeping.

While Gary had a hefty Rolodex, I suggested they look for additional ways to find donors. Most obviously, they could drop a few emails to other churches in the area, as well as pick up some press coverage.

They chose not to pursue additional publicity yet seemed interested in online donations. However, I was surprised when, a little while after we launched the website, they removed the online donations and asked to stop all monthly reporting.

I learned four important lessons:

*1\. Every consulting project needs to align completely with the client's objectives and values.*

*2\. People don’t always recognize what they really need, and you often have to sell them on their “needs” as much as their “wants”.*

*3\. Not everyone shares the vision to scale their movement.*

*4\. Most projects require ongoing follow-through to ensure success.*

Did we tap into the full potential of this project? Far from it and I learned important lessons as a result.

However, was it a successful project? Absolutely\! I developed a great relationship with Gary and his team, and we were able to provide the missing piece for their outreach.

That's a win.
