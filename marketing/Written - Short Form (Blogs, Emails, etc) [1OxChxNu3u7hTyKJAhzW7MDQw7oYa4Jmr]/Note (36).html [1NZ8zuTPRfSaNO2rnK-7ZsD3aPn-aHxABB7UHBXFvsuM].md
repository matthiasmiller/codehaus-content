# **Note**

The perceptions that we have about entrepreneurs were set by people who are not entrepreneurs. That is why there are so many flood perceptions about who successful in affluent people are, including entrepreneurs

This is really helpful because other people are describing what they see looking from the outside, and we are rarely able to know what we look like two other people. So when other people describe what an entrepreneur looks like on the outside, we don't know whether or not we match because we don't know how other people perceive us.
