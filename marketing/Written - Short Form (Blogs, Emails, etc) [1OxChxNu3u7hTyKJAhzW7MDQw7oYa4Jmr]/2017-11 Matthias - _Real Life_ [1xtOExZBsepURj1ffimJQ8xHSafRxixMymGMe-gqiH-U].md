# **Helping Your Child Stop Screaming for Donuts**

What do you do when your child is screaming uncontrollably because you told them that no, they will NOT get to eat a dozen donuts for breakfast?

The rational engineer that I am, I admit that I've certainly tried to cajole them with the power of persuasion. However, if you've spent more than two minutes with an upset two-year-old, you'll know that they won't succumb to your logical arguments when they're screaming at the top of their lungs\!

That’s because of how your brain works.

When you're in "fight or flight mode", you can't access your rational brain. After all, you don't exactly want to get stuck working through a lengthy risk analysis when a grizzly is chasing you down\!

How do you help your child calm down to get them out of "fight or flight" so you can have a rational discussion?

Neuroscience has an important concept called "emotional contagion". Quite simply, this means that groups of humans tend to converge on a single emotion. Daniel Goleman discusses this idea more in-depth in his book *Primal Leadership*, where he references studies of this phenomenon in the workplace.

Emotional contagion is terrible news when your two-year-old starts getting under your skin and you start mirroring their frustration. However, it's a powerful tactic when you can reverse the direction, and you become the calm parent who can help your child get over their overwhelming disappointment.

Tactically, how does this synchronization happen?

Several years ago, my wife and I found the answer in a 2-hour presentation on the neuroscience of joy (available at multiplier.link/joy). We learned that as humans, we synchronize our emotions through eye contact.

Today, when one of our children escalates, we have a three-step process to calm them down:

1. Get down on their level, kneeling in front of them if necessary.  
2. Provide gentle, reassuring touch.  
3. Encourage them to make eye contact with us.

As soon as they make eye contact, they start synchronizing to our state of calm. The more deeply they’re attached, the more quickly they can switch out of "fight or flight mode". Our three-year-old son can go from being completely upset to instantly calm, simply by making eye contact with my wife or myself.

If you're a parent or work with children, I highly recommend you set time aside with your significant other to watch this presentation on joy. It will change the way you parent\!
