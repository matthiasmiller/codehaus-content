# **Chapter: The Declaration**

You are facing the most important moment of your life. That moment is now. Before you, you have a choice, whether you will leave your mark on the world, or whether you will slowly disappear into oblivion. This is a choice only you can make, and you must resolve today which path you will choose. If you are ready to make this choice into leaving your mark, I conclude this book with a chapter that is dedicated to you.

You were born for greatness. Your very DNA contain the information that define who you are and who you were made to become. The circumstances you faced in life were not designed to hold you back or defeat you. They are only situations that are to serve you and propel you into a life of greatness.

You were not born to life a haphazard, happy-go-lucky life. No, you were not born to live a selfish life at all. You were born to be bigger and play bigger than you've played ever before. You were not born for the minor leagues. You were born to play in the major leagues.

You were born into an elite club, and it is the elite club of You. You are the one who defines your standard of success, and it is custom tailored to who you are as an individual. You were not born to compete with the greatness of others. No, you were born to shine as yourself, leaving a light for others who come behind you.

You were born to live outside of the mold that others put on you. You were born to be uniquely you. You were born to leave your fingerprint on history so that the world would be better because of you.

You were born to overcome.

You have the power to face your fears. You are courageous in the face of difficulty, and even though fear overwhelms your soul, you rise up and cross the line. You refuse to be slowed or hindered by your fears.

You will not allow your fears to dictate your path, but you recognize that your greatest fears often lie in the path of your greatest success. You will not relent until you lay hold of the prize that lies on the other side of that line.

Today, you choose to draw a line in the sand. It is the line between the life you've always lived and the life that you will choose to live today. And right now, you choose to step over the line.

No longer will your life be dictated by the fearful judgments of others. Your ears will be closed to the voices of critics who mock you, daring you to think of yourself as deserving of significance and success. Today, you shut out the voices that will deter you from your path.

As you cross that line, you release those people who have hurt you, abused you, and misused you. You take the deliberate decision of crossing the line, leaving those hurtful actions in the past. You will forgive, because it is only in forgiveness that you have the power to leave those voices in the past and focus on the voice that is compelling you into the future.

You refuse to allow those people into your heart until they have proven once again that they have your best interest in mind. You will release them, but you will wait for them to prove again that their voices are worthy of entering your world.

You keep them out so that you can freely let others in. From this moment on, you choose to surround yourself with people who only care about the best for you. They refuse to be swayed by your appearance, your status, or your opinion. They refuse to give you any advice that is self-serving to you or to them, and they freely give you the advice you most badly need to hear, whether it's comfortable or not.

You determine to surround yourself with a band of brothers and sisters, all committed to making a mark on history and leaving a legacy for the world. You refuse to live in isolation, recognizing that it is in community and friendship that the world is changed.

You are relentless in your pursuit, yet you never hesitate to care for the people around you. You are tireless in your work, yet you never sacrifice your loved ones for the work you love.

You wake every single day with an all-consuming purpose and passion, knowing that today, you have the opportunity to live the life that no one else will ever live. You awake, knowing that today, if you do not live to the fullest of your own potential, the world will miss what only you can give.

You spend every moment fully present, focused on the one thing that you have: the here and the now. You fully engage with the people around you, and you fully engage in your situation.

## **Born to Lead**

Everywhere you go, you lead. You inspire other people to greatness, giving them what you are receiving right now: the gift of someone who believes in them. As you create possibility, others follow. Everywhere you go, you change lives because you are willing to fully embrace the leadership that has been stewarded to you.

You will lead in difficulty and uncertainty. You will assume risk for yourself so that you can better the lives of others. You will be vulnerable when vulnerability is required. You will allow others to see your own imperfections and flaws. You will give them the power to believe that what is possible for you is possible for them.

You will lead by creating an atmosphere of anticipation. You will allow others to live, not under the weight of what might have been, but under the exhilaration of what might become. You will give them eyes to see, not the forsaken past, but the unclaimed future. You empower them to recognize the world of opportunity that lies at their feet, if they are only willing to take the first step.

You will lead by creating an atmosphere of happiness. You will know that life is meant to be celebrated and enjoyed, and that meaningful moments happen in that strange closeness we feel when we laugh together. You will show your friends that success comes when we don't take ourselves seriously, and you will be the first person to laugh over your silly mistakes.

You will lead by creating an atmosphere of love. You will give that gift to every person you meet. You will demonstrate to them that the matter, and you will give them reasons to prove it. You will show them the significance of their talents, and you will show they the story their lives are playing.

You will lead by creating an atmosphere of growth. You will create platforms for others to shine, lifting them far beyond the places you were ever able to reach. You will be secure in your own worth and value, and will freely enable others to succeed. You will give away the things that you've worked the hardest for in order to see them bring the greatest results.

You will lead by creating an atmosphere of creativity. You will refuse to be locked into the mundane, but will deliberately live in the poetry of today. You see the colors, the shades, the nuances of the life that you are living in today, and you share that with others. You will inspire others to think bigger and better thoughts. You will inspire in them thoughts that they would never have imagined without you, because you bring that atmosphere of creativity.

You will lead, not because of a position that you hold or because of permission you've received. You will lead because you were born to influence, and no one can stop you. You will continue influencing others to become better, and most importantly, to become more themselves. You will lead to serve others, and you will know that serving others requires no permission at all.

You were born to lead, and you will find others recognizing your talent. You will discover others magnetically drawn to who you are, because you are giving them something that no one else can give: You are giving them you.

You will surround yourself with giants, because ordinary people will not be able to exist in your presence. You will see and recognize the greatness of every single person who enters into your life. You will seek out and discover the genius that is buried within them, and you will breathe on that flicker of a flame. You will nurture that genius until it turns into a burning blaze. When that blazes sets the world on fire, you will not mourn because they've out-shone you. You will celebrate because you know you've done what a true leader does: you've just created something that's much bigger than you.

## **Born to Overcome**

You were born to overcome. You will face difficulty and hardship, but in the middle of it, you will be able to remain confident in one thing: who you are is sufficient. You will know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that who you are is enough.

You will not merely know it in your head, but you will know it in your heart. You will realize that you share the same elements of every hero you look up to. They, too, started in obscurity and difficultly. They, too, had immense odds to overcome and had to learn experience hardship before they reached the place they've arrived.

The world did not always recognize their potential, just as the world does not always recognize your potential. But the determination with which they overcame is the same determination with which you face in life.

No matter what comes your way, you will be granted the undying strength of heart to never give up. Giving up will be the furthest thing in your mind because you will be convinced that you will succeed. You know that you will reach the prize you are striving for, as long as you don't give up. You recognize that every detour will only serve to make you stronger. It will only empower you to achieve greater levels of success.

Giving up isn't an option. Your mind is too full of possibility to consider giving up as one of them. You know that, even if you fail, you will find new opportunity because you've found the world to be such a big place for you.

You will discover hidden answers in the moment that you need them. You will find friends who will give you the answers exactly when you need them. You will receive e-mails in your inbox which, when combined with the things you've already learned, will give you the precise insight that you need.

You will learn to live without worry, knowing that the answer will come when you need it. You will discover, in the face of immense pressure, that you have greater wisdom than you knew. In the furnace of affliction, you will discover that you have greater capacity than you hoped to imagine.

You will refuse to accept trite answers that blame your situation. You will refuse to settle for a simple, "I don't know" or "That'll never work." You refuse to put yourself into a mindset that makes you the victim of life, giving life the power of you. You know that you were born to be a solution, not a victim, and you live with the awareness that a solution exists for every problem you face. If you can't find it, you may simply be the first to discover it.

All of this will be driven by one deep, undying belief: that you were born to overcome. You were not born to be a loser, or to be the underdog. You were born to be a winner. You are able to win without trampling others, because you know the world is big enough for each of us to succeed.
