# **Chapter: Setting Your GPS**

It doesn't matter how clear your map is if you don't follow it. It doesn't matter if you have a great GPS with updated information if you don't actually move along with its directions.

One of the keys to success is simply follow-through, to take the ideas that have been given to you and use them. Most of success is not complicated, but it's easily missed.

The same is true with your personal GPS. You may easily determine the things that are in your strengths. You may be aware of your vision, but it's easy to let the things of life get in the way of actually accomplishing what you want to accomplish.

That's why it's important to learn to live your life according to a GPS, rather than according to the situation of the moment.

Consider this. If you were driving down the road, and you came across a road that was a little extra bumpy, would you turn off into a completely different direction just because of the bumpiness? Never\!

You might look for smoother routes, but it doesn't make sense to completely change your destination just because you don't like the road.

However, that's how many people live their lives. They work at a job they don't like because it's easier to keep working there than it is to move away. They settle of living a life of obligation and stress, because it's easier to stay in that position than to strengthen their decision making muscles and say yes to something more significant.

All the journaling and words in the word make no difference if you are unwilling or unable to follow your GPS. Your follow-through on what you've written is critical for it to even mean anything.

## **How to Know When You've Lost Track**

You must learn how to detect when your life is off-track. You must learn to listen to the clues of when life isn't taking you in the right direction, and when you've wandered off the path that you've really wanted.

Although we've discussed it earlier, I want to repeat these warning signs so that you can become aware of the times when you are losing your way. Unless you can detect it early, you will at best find yourself wasting time on your journey, or at worse, you will find yourself recovering from burnout.

One of the first warning signs is simply apathy, and sometimes just a sense of being lost. You've made a decision, you've moved into a role, but somewhere in the middle of all, you've lost touch with why you're doing what you're doing.

You feel like you don't belong. There's an ache within you that's telling you that there's something greater to pursue. That ache is not an ache to be silenced. It's something you must listen to and heed. It's an invitation to review what you've written in these past few chapters and look at your life, and reorient yourself.

Many people ignore this sense, for different reasons. Sometimes they are more worried about making the extra buck. Sometimes they are afraid of stepping outside what seems to be the norm. Ignoring this sense will only turn into dread--another one of the warning signs. They have no passion to get up and face the day. They have no eagerness to pursue their dreams. Many times, this is because they've resigned themselves to someone else's plans for their lives. They have become so accustomed to saying "yes" that they are unable to quit saying it, even if it means that it will suck the life out of them.

You severely limit your effectiveness if you say "yes" to things you should decline. But worse than that, you limit others' effectiveness. If you are a leader, you are implicitly leading your people into burnout. You are teaching them that they need to be doing things that they dread. You are teaching them that it's okay to live without all-out passion and engagement.

But that's not the only limitation.

When you do this, you limit others from fulfilling your position. If you are in a position that does not allow you to be fully engaged, you are a warm body in a seat that needs to be filled by someone else. Your decision to continue doing what you're doing is no less severe than you pushing someone else who is better fit for the job out of that position, so that you can occupy it.

If you find yourself with a dread for what you do, it's an early sign that you're doing the wrong thing. Sometimes it's necessary to do this for short periods of time, but you must recognize how often you are doing it, and why. If you continually excuse yourself saying, "It's just for a short time," you still have a belief system that will disempower the people around you.

This dread is a nothing but a low-grade burnout, and if it continues unchecked, you'll find yourself in a place where you're so desperate for change that you'll do anything to get yourself out of your current situation. This is why it's so critical to recognize this early, and correct the problem. It might mean the difference between being able to tweak your job description, and desperately throwing it all aside and looking for a better opportunity.

## **Stop and Ask for Directions**

The worst thing that you can do when you sense that things are not going as they should is to refuse to step aside and ask for directions. Gritting your teeth and pressing harder will not make the problem disappear. In fact, it will only make your problem get worse faster.

Don't be the guy who drives for hours in his car, looking for that perfect restaurant he was going to take his wife to, but will never get to eat at because he was afraid to ask for directions.

It's unnecessary. Have the humility to stop and check in with yourself, asking yourself where you went wrong.

## **Where We Lose Sight**

No one wakes up one morning and decides, "Today, I'm going to quit caring about the things that are truly important to me. I'm going to quit thinking about how I must live my life." However, many people wake up telling themselves, "Today I will do something that truly matters."

You do not drift because you intended to. You drift because you had no other intention. You must learn to be intentionally yourself.

Your GPS has to become the grid of the decisions that you make. Otherwise, it will be completely meaningless to you, except for the haunting dreams that you once held.

This means that when you are faced with an opportunity, you will choose to weigh it against where you want to go. Will it take you closer or further away from that? Are their hidden benefits along the way? What will it take to get you there?

This also means that when you are faced with a request, you will make the same decision. Will this take you closer or further away from where you want to go? Which decision will leave you with the most regret?

It's easy to say "yes" to every opportunity, until we realize that every "yes" includes an implicit "no". Every time that you say yes to one opportunity, you are saying "no" to another. The trouble is that we deceive ourselves that we can say "yes" to everything with no consequence.

As soon as someone comes to us with a request, we convince ourselves that we can do it. Days, weeks, and years later we realize that we've neglected the things that have mattered the most to us.

"No" is one of the most emotionally difficult words for many people to say. But it's only difficult when you don't see the consequences. As the retired business owner who has driven a wedge between himself and his kids because he falsely believed he could say "yes" to the long hours without consequence. Saying "no" would have been a lot easier when he was younger, if he would have been willing to see the consequences of his actions.

Your choices today will move you toward your tomorrow, and if you're not happy with where you are today, it's because of a choice you made yesterday.

You must learn to decide every day: "I will live by the things that are the most important to me. I will not allow myself to be distracted by things that take me away from my most critical part of my life."

## **Constant Feedback**

Many people live their lives on autopilot. They lock their steering wheel, set the cruise, and drive. They sit back and enjoy the ride, until they careen off the road. Even then, they continue driving, as long as they don't crash into anything significant. And if they do crash, they pick up the pieces as best they can and keep moving.

You know, of course, that this is no way to drive. Driving requires your attention to where you're going. It's dynamic. Without even thinking about it, you're constantly making small tweaks to the steering wheel.

It would be absurd to think that you would somehow reach your destination, only making sharp 90-degree turns. And yet, that's how many people live. They continue until they've hit a crisis, and then yank the steering wheel, hoping to get back on track with their lives. They have a job that they don't like, and the moment they see trouble coming, they yank the wheel sideways and head off into another direction.

Many people have serious collisions that could have been avoided by doing one thing: by staying calm and gently guiding their vehicle back on track. Instead, our instinct in times of danger and crisis, when we see ourselves headed for trouble, or sliding for a ditch, is to grab the wheel and yank it as hard as we can in the other direction. We over-correct.

Similarly, many people see themselves in crisis situations and they overcorrect. They yank the wheel to one side or the other, and the next thing they know, they've brought complete and utter chaos to their situation. This could all have been avoided if they had been paying attention.

Living by your GPS must become a way of life for you. It must be something that you weigh yourself daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. It must become a habit. If you spend time now focusing on it, it will become second-nature to you. However, you must take the time to focus on it now to develop that.

## **Some Seasons Require Closer Attention**

Some clear, sunny days, all you need to do to drive is roll down the top of your convertible, set the cruise, turn on the radio, and drive. In the same way, some seasons of life will allow you to just run, giving it everything that you've got.

However, you also know that when you're driving your car in inclement weather, you pay special attention to the conditions. Whether it's rain or snow, you know that you must take special care as you drive.

In the same way, some seasons of your life will require you to pay special attention. If you are in a very busy season of life, you must take special precautions that you will not commit to somethi9ng that you should not commit to. If you are in a situation where people are asking for you to take on a lot of responsibilities, you must pay special attention to the decisions that you take.

If you are in the middle of a transition, you must pay special attention to yourself to make sure that you manage the transition well, that you can remain oriented to the things that are important to you.

If you are in the middle of difficulty and hardship, you must also pay special attention lest you let the difficulty and hardship get the better of you. It may be tempting to compromise what matters to you, simply because the journey is difficult.

During these seasons, you must pay special attention, lest you drift off-course.
