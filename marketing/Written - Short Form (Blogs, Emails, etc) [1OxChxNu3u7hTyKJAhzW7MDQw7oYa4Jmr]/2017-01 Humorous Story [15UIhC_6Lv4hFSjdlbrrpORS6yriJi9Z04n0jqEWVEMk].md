FUNNY STORY

As the manager of a self-storage business, Jerry has a deep reserve of amusing stories. For example, one of his tenants rode a bike to work every day and decided to leave his cat in the unit. Jerry didn’t realize what was happening until he walked past the unit and heard the neglected cat howling inside\! He had to explain to the tenant that this was a self-storage, not an animal shelter\!

Still, that was nothing compared to the morning Jerry opened a unit only to be greeted by a black-and-white calf staring blankly at him. The calf's mannequin-like stillness and broken ear quickly proved it a leftover mount from a taxidermist who had recently vacated. Never one to pass up some fun, Jerry quickly loaded the calf on his golf cart to surprise his wide-eyed boss. Since the previous tenant didn’t want the mannequin-calf, it became a loser’s trophy at football watch parties, dressed up in team colors. Moo-ve over losers\!
