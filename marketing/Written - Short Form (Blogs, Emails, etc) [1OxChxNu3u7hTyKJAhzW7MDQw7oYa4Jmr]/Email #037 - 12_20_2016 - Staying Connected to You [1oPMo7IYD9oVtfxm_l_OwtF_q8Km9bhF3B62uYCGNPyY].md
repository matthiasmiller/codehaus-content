Whenever entrepreneurs become disconnected from their vision, they begin to drift aimlessly, which is a dangerous place for any leader to be.

For example, when most people make New Year’s resolutions, they write them down and then forget about them. A few weeks or even months later, they’ve forgotten why they’re doing what they do and lose all motivation to continue. That’s why the gyms are so full in January and so empty in March.

When we become disconnected from our vision, we often feel a loss of momentum and start looking around for something new to do. This gives us a temporary boost of energy, but it often leaves us feeling like we’re moving in circles without clear forward progress.

As entrepreneurs, we’re on the hunt for the next kill--the next idea, the next venture, the next business, the next opportunity. As we mature, we find ways to curb that desire. However, by doing this, we can also end up separating ourselves from the very thing that makes us come alive.

How do you stay connected to your vision? How do you avoid being distracted by a hundred other shiny ideas?

I’ve found it’s actually not that complicated.

Every morning, I’ve made it a practice to review my vision. This isn’t a mystical “purpose statement,” but simply a clear picture of where I want to go.

And that’s the context which frames the actions of my day. It not only provides the safeguards against distractions, but it also provides a tremendous amount of energy knowing exactly why I get up every single morning.

If you’re having trouble staying connected to your vision, I encourage you to check out [Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planning course](https://ew295.isrefer.com/go/charfen1/mys/). Yes, that’s an affiliate link, and here’s why.

I’ve invested in a lot of training over the past few years but this has by far given me the most results the quickest. It’s specifically designed for visionary entrepreneurs. If that’s not you, that’s okay--it’s not for you.

Regardless, I encourage you to make a habit of reviewing your vision every single day. If you don’t have a vision that energizes you and motivates you, build one that does. If your days don’t line up with that vision, find a way to make your day a stepping stone to that vision.

We were all born for more than mediocrity, and as we continue taking action towards our unique contribution to the world, we will all help each other…

Be the best you.
