**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

How often would you say you’re one hundred percent satisfied with what you’ve accomplished in a day? Do you always feel ecstatic when looking at your to-do list in the evening?

Maybe sometimes, but I bet not very often.

To-do lists can be helpful because they allow you to track your accomplishments and ~~cross things off~~ your agenda.

But if you’re a Type A, go-get-em kind of person, you likely come to the end of each day with a few things still unfinished.

This can be discouraging, to say the least. 

Those last two uncrossed bullet points plague your subconscious mind. And they bring with them a host of little lies.

*“You’ll need to work harder tomorrow.” “You have so much to do and so little time.” “Wake up earlier.” “Skip lunch.”*

Sound familiar?

Here’s the unfortunate yet also wonderful news about life:

**You’re probably much more aware of everything *you’re not doing* and probably not paying attention to the amount of progress you’re actually making right now.**

When was the last time you made a list of everything you *are* getting done? Did you sit down in January and think through everything you accomplished last year? 

We only think about those last two unfinished items on the list. We don’t see value in tracking our success, so we don’t.  

Instead, we mentally list all the ways we’re “missing it.” By doing so, we give ourselves the wrong impression of our progress, which quickly leads to discouragement. We look at how much we’ve missed and assume we’re just crawling along at a snail’s pace, while our goals only slip further and further away.

I know this because I’ve missed things too.

I've got an awesome software project I haven't launched yet along with critical sales funnels that I haven’t developed. There are incredible people with insight and value who I could be connecting with--I have their info, they’re within reach--but I haven’t. I’ve missed them. I don’t have the time or the focus.

As I think about these things, I could feel really discouraged and frustrated. I could pound my fist and scold myself for sleeping in too long too often or taking time to help a friend. I could rearrange my schedule and shave a few minutes from family time or needed rest.

Or, I could take a few minutes to remember some of the big things I have succeeded at. Things like playing a small part in starting a tech center in Canon City or building out the infrastructure and support I need to allow my life to get consistently easier on a daily basis. This included hiring an assistant and continuing to develop Chris, my content marketer--all things I consider high-value accomplishments.

When I take the time to review what that I'm already doing, I realize I'm making much more progress than I'd thought. This helps instill confidence that I will achieve the things I'm reaching out for. 

Have you taken the time, recently, to remember the things you've accomplished? Take a few minutes and allow yourself to recalibrate your perspective and gain fresh motivation to keep moving forward.

Recognizing the progress you continue to make will instill the confidence and motivation that will allow you to...

Be the best you\!
