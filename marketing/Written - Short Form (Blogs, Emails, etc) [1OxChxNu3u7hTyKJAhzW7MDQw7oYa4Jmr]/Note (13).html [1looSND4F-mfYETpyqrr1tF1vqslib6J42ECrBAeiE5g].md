# **Note**

a lot of people play whack a mole with their problems

they think everything is tied to a simple cause and effect. they see a problem, and they immediately try to resolve it

however, their solution has unintended consequences

for example, many people fall behind, and they see working harder as the solution to their problem

however, working harder has a number of unfortunate side-effects

one of them is that "action drives out thought"

they end up with stress and burnout, rather than effectively solving their problem

however, if they don't work harder, they end up with other problems

if someone walks up to you and tries to sell you a golden ticket, it's probably not the answer. it's probably much more complex than that.

that's not to say you should ignore it, because they probably have something very important to say. it's just that it's probably an answer that cannot quite stand on its own

if you want to find the solution to the problem, you have to look at the whole picture. you have to see the unintended consequences of your decisions. you have to look at the system as a whole.

another example is the issue of lawmakers. someone gets injured, and immediately people put in place a policy. but they don't see the unintended consequences of that policy. many times, it ends up being counterproductive because it keeps th good people from doing the good

if you want lasting change, you're probably not going to get it from simple changes. probably it will come through systemic changes. it's going to come from a more in-depth overhaul of how you approach your problem.

time management for example, is not just a simple tweak

With that they see a catch 22 because they cannot adjust more than two variables at once.  You must learn to look at multiple areas...
