Have you ever worked under a leader who not only demanded certain outcomes, but required a particular game plan to achieve them, as well?

It wasn’t just a matter of getting the right result. You had to do it the right way, too. Thus, they micromanaged everything you did.

These are the tell-tale traits of poor leadership.

When it comes to pursuing results, there are generally two types of leaders: Shepherds and Gardeners.

We want to be like Gardeners in our leadership, not Shepherds.

Here’s the difference:

* *Shepherds have to prod and guide their sheep every step of the way. Gardeners cultivate the soil and surroundings so their plants have a healthy ecosystem in which to grow on their own.*

* *Shepherding requires the leader to drive things forward. Gardening merely requires steady care so the plant can bear fruit on its own.*

* *Shepherds lead through hierarchy, but Gardeners lead through nurturing healthy environments.*

* *Shepherds focus on assigning tasks and getting them done. Gardeners focus on growing people who deliver successful outcomes.*

* *Within a Shepherding environment, failure means delay, thus failure is reproachful and feared. Within a Gardening environment, failure becomes an opportunity to learn and thus contributes to ultimate success.*

* *Within a Shepherding environment, the leader takes the initiative. Any creative followers are threatening and considered out of line. Within a Gardening environment, individual or communal initiative is encouraged.*

* *Shepherd leaders are the top of command, any disagreement is punished. Whereas Garden leaders encourage and even invite disagreement in order to arrive at the best decision.*

* *Shepherds move dumb sheep from place to place. Gardeners want their followers to think for themselves. They value each one’s perspective.*

To be perfectly clear, being a Gardener does not mean abdicating responsibility for the outcomes. It means finding a better, more effective way to lead.

Wealth and success result not merely from achieving tasks. They come from creating healthy and thriving ecosystems in which people can try, fail, learn, and grow. This changes the definition of leadership from prodding to nurturing.

If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on the cultural changes you need to make to get the right results.

This will free up your employees and your company, allowing all of you to get your best work done. And when you are getting your best work done, you are able to...

Be the Best You\!

**Ecosystems (this could be a 2-part series)**  
Wealth and success is about creating ecosystems that are healthy and that thrive. This changes the definition of leadership.

The Shepherd

- Think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things  
- Requires you to drive things forward  
- Puts you in the hub of the wheel and everything circles around you  
- Herds sheep/moves people to get to a certain place  
- Focused on assigning tasks and getting them done

The Gardener

- Focuses leadership on creating a culture where things get done  
- Allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.  
- Focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own  
- Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results  
- What makes a healthy environment?  
* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself  
- When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a byproduct of that.

If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.
