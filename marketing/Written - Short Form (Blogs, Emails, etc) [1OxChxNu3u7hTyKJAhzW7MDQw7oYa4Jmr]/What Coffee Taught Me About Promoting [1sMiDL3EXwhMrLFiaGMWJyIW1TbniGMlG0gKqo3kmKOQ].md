**What Coffee Taught Me About Promoting My Business On Facebook**

Don’t get me wrong…6 months ago I was a hardcore caffeine addict. I lost count of how many cups I drank in a day. I’d been drinking coffee since I was a pimple-faced eighth-grader.

But then something happened that dramatically changed my health and entrepreneurial life…

I literally woke up one morning with ZERO appetite for coffee. I went from intravenous caffeine consumption to 100% decaffeination, almost overnight.

To tell you that my life changed is no understatement…

What does this have to do with your business?

**Well, this wake-up call gave me an important insight to growing not just my business, but any business…ESPECIALLY businesses that are on Facebook…**

Now, you might think that quitting caffeine solved my problems. Truth be told, some things started getting better.

When I quit coffee, I started drinking more water, my shoulders started feeling looser, I started sleeping better at night, and I didn’t have crazy crashes in the afternoon. This one decision started a chain reaction that ended up in my wife and I making massive improvements to our diet.

Other things just got worse…

Trouble was…now that I didn’t have caffeine, what was I going to replace it with?

**That’s when I discovered the chemical called dopamine**.

It’s the “feel good” chemical…something that you get when you help someone in need, or go for a walk outside, eat a candy bar in the middle of the afternoon, or (like I did for years) drink a meticulously brewed cup of freshly-roasted Java.

Add some sugary syrup, call it a Latte, and you’ve got a double-powered dopamine machine.

Makes ya feel pretty good, eh?

Love that feeling\!

**That’s when I stumbled onto a realization that unlocked important insights.**

I realized one morning that I wasn’t just a marketer or a consultant. I was that barista. I’d already gotten into the habit of serving up delightful drinks that kept my tribe coming back for more.

Every email that I sent gave them a touch of satisfaction but a hunger for a little more.

Every newsletter that I sent made them look forward to the next one.

Even my clients would start with the most basic option on a contract, then ask if they could upgrade to the full-priced option.

And I was nowhere close to tapping the full power of what I was doing.

I realized I could create something just as sweet, just as sugary, just as delightful to the taste-buds…something just as addictive as that caffeine…something that kept people coming back for seconds…

And something that wouldn’t leave them with a mid-afternoon crash.

**Business Tip**: Did you catch thatnotice what just happened? Don’t miss what I said. If you would quit reading this post and take 5-10 minutes to figure out how to become the barista for *your* market, it might be the best 5-10 minutes you’ve spent on your business this week.

**What does dopamine and lattes have to do you with your business?**

Your marketing can be just as sweet, just as soothing, just as delightful to the taste-buds as a tall Caramel Macchiato. And something as mundane as swinging a hammer, tinkering on a car, penciling out numbers, working through family law, or caring for the sick can be every bit as engaging and interesting.

Chances are…your business is EXACTLY that addictive already…

The people who know you best are already standing in line, coming back for more, and more, and more… You know that what you’re delivering is absolutely rock-solid. If you can get someone to taste your drink, they’re hooked.

(If not, you need to quit reading RIGHT NOW and don’t sleep until you’ve figured out why they’re NOT hooked. You have a problem that no marketing can ever solve.)

But does your marketing do you justice? Do you have that same depth of flavor in how you present yourself to the world?

**Don’t fall prey to one of the biggest tragedies in business–undiscovered gems that get buried beneath the marketing noise of companies that are, quite frankly, inferior.**

I don’t want it to happen to you. I want you to have the same experience, where you…

* **Have people excited when they see your ads**, because they find them so engaging and downright delightful…where they feel like you’ve actually *helped* them every time you sell.

* **Stand out from the crowd in a “all look the same” marketplace**…when they scroll through Facebook, you catch their eye and they start thinking of you differently from your competitors.

* **Measure the *actual* cost of acquiring a new customer**….so you know exactly how many nickels, dimes, or Ben Franklins it costs you to get someone in your door or on the line.

* **Have a marketing plan that you can truly feel proud of**…have squeaky-clean marketing so you don’t need to go take a shower after looking over your marketing material (even if you have unusual preferences that “most” marketers would consider OK).

* **Have people know the REAL quality of the services you provide**…where they *want* to buy because they know you’re going to keep your promises.

* **Have the relief of people *calling you* because they want to work with you**…instead of chasing down a few people you don’t really want to work with because you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel.

If so, I’ve got a special offer for you. This MIGHT be the thing for you, but here’s the thing…

I’m not asking you to buy a bag of coffee. I’m asking you to buy a coffee-maker.

Something you can flip a switch and just let the water drip, drip, drip….until your coffee pot is full of a fresh tasty brew. Or something that whirs and bubbles and gurgles until it produces a beautiful, frothy latte.

**It’s like buying the coffee maker that lets you get your daily fix for $0.08 instead of $2.10.**

And no need to wait in line endlessly, either.

If you want to know how much it’ll cost, you’ll have to wait just one second, because here’s what will happen:

1. We’ll [schedule a 10-minute call](https://secure.scheduleonce.com/MultiplyYourStrengths) just to make sure we’re actually a good fit. (As I said, if you don’t have a rock-solid product or service, this isn’t for you.)

2. Then we’ll schedule a second call (30 minutes this time) so I can learn more about your business.

3. I’ll write a blog, just like this (except not about coffee…well, unless you want that\!)…something you can use time and again to keep people coming back to you.

4. I’ll find a picture that will help you promote your company

5. I’ll set up a Facebook ad and show you how to manage the budget (it’s not hard when you know how)

**A great ad is easily worth $649 (or more). **In fact, in some situations, that’s how much you’d have to pay as a *retainer*.

Why is it worth that much?

Because it’s like buying a coffee maker.

Turn it on, and just let the water drip through….and you get to figure out how much you want to spend on advertising for a month.

**The good news is that you can have this for less than $649.**

Instead, you can have it for a *fraction* of what this is actually worth. Of course, you’re welcome to keep wrangling with words, finding pictures, tinkering with Facebook Ads, and making up headlines, hoping that your customers will take a sip.

Or, you can pay $147 and have us do all of that for you.

We’ll even make a deal with you….if you try out the ad and either:

1. Your $147 investment doesn’t pay for itself in 30 days, or…

2. You’re not 100% happy with the ad (even if you don’t like it that I let a typo slip in, which can actually HELP your ad)…

…Then I’ll give you a 100% hassle-free refund. Which means you’ve got absolutely nothing to lose.

Oh, and you’ll still get to use the ad if you like.

Literally, no risk. Better than risk-free, actually.

All you need to do to lock in the special price ($147) is [schedule a 10-minute call](https://secure.scheduleonce.com/MultiplyYourStrengths) so we can figure out whether it’s a good fit.

In case you think I’m borderline delusional with this offer, I’ll clue you in with a little story. You see, I used to hang around this coffee shop where the barista would come out with a tray of sample-size lattes. It didn’t matter if I’d drained my latte and told myself I was done. Some of those samples were so delicious that I found myself thirsty for…

Well, you get the picture.

Are you ready to give that same experience to your target market?

Listen, I’m a straight-forward guy, and I don’t pressure, haggle, or nag. I don’t work with people I don’t think need my help. I’m kind to a fault, and I know people sometimes take advantage of that. I want to help as many people as I can, but if we’re not a good fit, I’m just going to tell you “no”.

Can we be honest with each other?

I hope so\! So go ahead and [schedule that call](https://secure.scheduleonce.com/MultiplyYourStrengths) and let’s get started\!

PS: Please note…this offer is truly limited. I don’t plan to do this for more than 7 people, and if I do, I’m going to be raising my prices. I’m aggressively amping up my dopamine-writing-powers, so I’m not sure how much it’s going to be yet, but they could easily double or triple. [Schedule that call](https://secure.scheduleonce.com/MultiplyYourStrengths) now\!

PPS: If you’re a larger business, you may actually get MORE value by investing in multiple posts. This will let us create three posts (using different angles) and test them with multiple headlines and pictures, reducing your ongoing cost. Now, *that’s *something you can have for $649. However, [we’ll need to talk first](https://secure.scheduleonce.com/MultiplyYourStrengths)\!
