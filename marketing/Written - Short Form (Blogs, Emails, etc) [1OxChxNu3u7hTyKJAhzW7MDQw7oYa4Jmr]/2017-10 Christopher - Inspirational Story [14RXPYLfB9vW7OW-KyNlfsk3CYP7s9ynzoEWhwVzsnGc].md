**Target: 240**

Two months ago, the city of Toronto decided they needed a new set of stairs in the Tom Riley Park in Etobicoke, Ontario. The problem was, according to FoxNews.com, several people had fallen down a “poorly constructed” pathway. However, the city was estimating the project would cost $65,000.

That’s when Adi Astl, a retired mechanic, took matters into his own hands, hired a homeless man, and built the steps for only $550 (for materials).

By the time the FoxNews article was written, Mr. Astl’s wife said she had already seen that the steps were being put to good use and were helpful to the community. Astle told Fox that “...the safety of the people is more important than money. So if the city is not willing to do it, I have to do it myself.”

What we loved about Mr. Astl’s act of service is that demonstrates perfectly what good business is: an exchange that benefits everyone involved.

The community benefited from a safer park. The taxpayers benefited from a much more cost-effective solution. The homeless man received a “hand up” with this opportunity to use his energy and talent at work.

When we read this story, we just had to take a moment and smile because we happen to believe that a profitable business is one of the most effective ways to change the world. We’re grateful for business owners and entrepreneurs like you who do that, every single day.
