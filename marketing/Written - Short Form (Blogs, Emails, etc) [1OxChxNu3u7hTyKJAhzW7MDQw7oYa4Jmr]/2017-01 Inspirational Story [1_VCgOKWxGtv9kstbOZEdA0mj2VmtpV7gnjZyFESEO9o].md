**TARGET WORD COUNT: 240**

Life can feel overwhelming, at times. Whether it’s a low month for your business, the regular day-to-day struggles of raising a family, or just the divisiveness of national politics and culture, life can become discouraging.

That’s why it’s always important to seek out the things that bring light within the darkness.

Like when an eighth grader shares his lunch with a friend in need.

Dylan Duran from New Mexico asked his mom to start making him two lunches for school. When his mom inquired why he needed two lunches, he explained that his friend at school only brought a fruit cup with him every day. Dylan wanted his mom to make lunches for both of them.

Dylan’s Mom, Josette, happily made two lunches for the boys. Having been homeless herself at one point, she understood how lonely times of trouble can be and she immediately wanted to help.

According to Today.com, the boy now receives meals under the federal reduced and free meal program. But I think Dylan and his mom brought far more light into the boy’s life than merely a meal \- they brought friendship and kindness. Through their own struggle, they shone a light which told the little boy, “You’re not alone.”

One small act can make a world of difference. Let’s be like Dylan. Let’s be ready and willing to shine our lights even in a dark season.
