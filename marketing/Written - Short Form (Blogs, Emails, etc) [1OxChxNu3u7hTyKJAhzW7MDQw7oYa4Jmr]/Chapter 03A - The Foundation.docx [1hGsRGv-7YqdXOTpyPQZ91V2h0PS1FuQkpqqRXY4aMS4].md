# **Chapter: Your Identity**

This is one of the most critical pieces of knowing where to go from here--your identity

Answering the question, "Who are you...really?"

The reason that transition is so difficult for many people, although there are lots of reasons, is that they become attached to their circumstances, and they use their circumstances as their measuring stick.

When their circumstances are doing well, they are doing well. However, when their circumstances are not doing well, they suffer.

The question of who you really are needs to be settled at a deep level. Not merely intellectually, but emotionally as well.

You were assigned worth and value by your Creator, and nothing and no one can take that away.

Perhaps the easiest way to look at this concept is by looking at all the WRONG places we look for our identity.

## **You Are Not ... Other People's Opinions**

Many people get caught up in the trap of listening to other people's opinions. What does my family think about me? What do my friends think about me? What do my customers think about me? What does my boss think about me?

These are great questions to ask, but usually they have a hidden hook.

Somehow, we manage to take these questions and attach them to our self-worth.

If my boss is mad at me, I'm less of a person.

If my friends don't want to hang out with me, they must think I'm boring or worthless.

Again, it's never the right answer to ignore these issues. But the conclusions that you draw from them is super-important.

Whenever you start questioning your own worth, you open yourself up to all kinds of doubt and confusion. If your worth is dependent on other people's opinions, you'll spend a lot of time nursing your wounds of rejection.

## **You Are Not ... Your Failure**

I strive for excellence. I want to do e4verything to the best of my ability.

But sometimes, even my best ability falls completely short. NO matter how hard I try, it's still not good enough. No matter how I project my plans, how careful and thoughtful I am to plan, I get blindsided by something. Sometimes the things I care the most about are the things I seem to fail most miserably in.

But there's a conclusion I refuse to make from this.

I refuse to believe that I am less of a person because of it.

I have to pull that hook out of failure. When I become certain of my own value and worth as an individual, apart from my achievements and my failures, I am free to fail,. and rather than needing to tast6e the bitterness of defeat, I can get back up again and keep moving forward.

I am always more likely to move ahead when I am sure of my own worth as a person.

## **You Are Not ... Your Possessions**

What about the car you drive? The house you own? What does that say about you?

It turns out, less than we'd like to think. Some of the most impactful people in the world have owned simple homes and no car at all. Some of the wealthiest people live without a visible display of pomp and power.

Why?

Because they've realized that possessions, though useful, really don't have the power to define anyone. (Well, they shouldn't, at least.)

## **Our Broken Foundation**

As we approach the issue around how to bring transformation, it's really important that we look at how we LEARN and how we approach learning.

In the Western world, we approach learning in three steps:

1. We get to KNOW. We gather information, we do research, we go to school. Maybe we watch Videos on YouTube or read blogs if we can't afford to get any other training.

2. We get to DO. Well, most of the time, at least. We try to take all the information we've learned in the classroom and we try to apply it in real life. That's when everything that we learned in theory has to become practical.

3. We get to BE. By the time we are done, once we have built our business, once we have succeeded at our career, we get to be BE someone meaningful.

I think it's completely backwards. I'd like to turn this completely on its head.

Here's why.

In other cultures, young adults are apprenticed under older, more experienced individuals. In fact that's how I was taught computer programming. I've worked with individuals who are much, much smarter than me and who have all kinds of more knowledge and technical theory. But when it comes to designing software and writing great code, I outshine them.

I'm not trying to brag. I'm trying to make a point.

I've got years of experience doing it, and experience trumps theory every single time.

How many young business owners get taken by some hip, new marketing strategy? They take the course, learn the ropes, and try to implement it. Then they fail.

Why?

Because they expected theory to be able to carry them through, and they're still in the process of developing experience.

We need to change how we approach education. This is not merely about acquiring knowledge, although that's critically important. It's not merely about acquiring experience, although I think that's equally important.

It's about changing how we view our learning.

We need to integrate transformational learning. We need a learning style that does not merely feed the intellect, but that results in all of us being transformed. Learning is not merely about doing more or knowing more. It's about BEING more.

We've got this whole thing turned upside down. I'd like to propose a shift in how we approach this. I think we should turn it on its head, like this:

1. Everything starts with BEING someone. That means developing success on the inside. That means developing a sense of purpose and direction. That means developing an internal sense of congruence.

2. From there, you move into DOING. Yes, I know--before you spend your time learning? Hang on, and I'll defend myself.

3. Finally, as we step into action, we developing a KNOW. This is not merely an intellectual knowledge. It's a deep knowledge informed by who we are and informed by our own experience.

What do you think of when you think about who you are? Have you ever had a stranger walk up to you and ask you, "Who are you?

It's funny how we respond.

We respond with, "I'm Matthias, and I'm a business and leadership coach?

I've just shared with him my name--a label for myself--and what I do (also a label for myself).

But if I'm not that, who am I?

The reason many of us never dig deep is because we're not sure where to start, or how to answer the question of really, who am I?

We're too busy pursuing success to realize that success isn't going to come from the things that we do. Rather, success starts here and now in how you live your life.

## **Why Unconditional Acceptance Is Crucial**

Everyone's talking about self-worth today. Why all the talk about it?

Because it's significant.

You have the freedom to believe in yourself, and you'd better use that freedom well.

You have enough challenges in your world without being your own worst enemy.

Lots of people have advice on how to deal with negative self-talk. My is simple: treat yourself kindly.

If you'd yell at your friends and tell them what horrible people they are because they're not performing at a level you'd like them to, well--you've got your own set of problems. But if you wouldn't do that do your own friends, why wou8ld you put that pressure on yourself?

We are all looking for acceptance and a place to belong.

You're going to have to learn to place your worth and accepted in something besides all of these things. Your possessions will let you down. Your friends will let you down. Certain the opinion of the crowds will let you down.

Let them go.

Learn to embrace the worth you have as an individual, and allow nothing to rock that.

And from that posture, learn to develop yourself to becoming the best person you can possibly because.

Approach life unafraid, knowing that your own perceived value as a person will propel you to go further and go faster.

How do you push through the questions and the doubts? How do you achieve success?

Success always happens before you start.

If you doubt you'll succeed, you probably won't. If you believe you can do it, there's a good chance you will.

If you're looking for acceptance at the end of your journey, it'll elude you when you get there. But if you embrace it before you start, you'll have it your whole life long.

If you're looking for happiness when you achieve your accomplishments, you'll always be miserable and will never be able to find it. But if you choose to be happy now, you will always have something to celebrate.

If you're waiting for your big break to be grateful, you will go through your entire journey being ungrateful for the many blessings you already have, and when you get to your journey's end, even if you achieve success, you will have nothing to be grateful for. even that will not be enough.

You have to decide from the very beginning how you're going to live.

If you're waiting for more money before you can give, you'll never develop a habit generosity. If you're waiting for more money before you start saving, you'll never develop a habit of saving. You'll always live at the maximum of your ability.

You have to start with the now.

You have to reframe how you think, and you need to start developing your habits now.

Live with the same mindset you would have if you were successful, and you will find yourself following those thoughts, driving those decisions, that eventually bring you the results that you are looking for.

This is the power of living from your identity

You don't derive your worth, your happiness, your gratitude from the circumstances that you're in. You're free to be happy in the best of times and the worst of times.

The important benefit is that when you are in the worst of times, trying to find your way out of whatever desert you're in, your mind isn't clouded by questions of self-doubt, unhappiness, worry, or ingratitude.

You're free to focus only on this: what will it take to allow me to keep moving forward?

## **How to actually do this**

Yes, you tell me, this sounds great, but how do you actually accomplish this?

For me, this has been a simple journey, going through life day by day, living with an awareness that not of my thoughts are supportive to where I want to go.

Some days I feel like I can't get up and write another paragraph in my book. I want to give up. Toss in the towel.

Some days I feel like I can't make one move on my business, that this is never going to work.

I see warning signs. I'm not accomplishing what I need to accomplish, but I push through, and I keep going.

But before I do that, I do something else. I step back and I look at my thoughts. What am I thinking? What am I feeling?

Most of the time, I have a subtle believe that this will never work, or that I'll never achieve the results that I have. And Instead of focusing on the payoff, I focus on the risk of losing everything I've poured into.

sometimes I'm scared of being embarrassed. like many writers, I'm afraid of what other people will think when they actually see this book.

That's when I take a good, hard look at these thoughts, and I ask a few questions:

* Are they true?

* Are they helpful?

* Would I tell my friend this?

* What if I listen to this thought and it ends up being true?

* What if I listen to this thought, and it ends up being false?

That's the litmus test.

And if the thought isn't helpful or supportive, I don't try to force it out of my mind. I just ignore.

Thoughts are like brats. They don't like to be ignored, and if you ignore them, you take the fun right out of their game.

But I do something else. I shift my focus. I start looking at the opposite perspective.

What if this WILL work?

What if people will love this book?

Or, what if it doesn't achieve everything that I had hoped, but look at what I've learned in the process. And even more than what I've learned, look at the personal transformation I've experienced in the process.

That's the journey.

Day by day, you become aware of thoughts that aren't supportive.

Some days it's easy. You ignore them, laugh them off, and keep going. Other days, you grab them by the throat and cast them down to the ground.

## **Identity is a Fight over Truth and Lies About You**

But there's one question that goes way deeper than merely the thought. It's the question of, what does this thought tell me about my perception of my identity.

I'm scared of writing another paragraph of my book. On the surface this looks like a simple, silly fear, and it's easy to dismiss it as one.

However, on a deeper level, underlying the surface, are a few silly beliefs about myself:

* I'm not that interesting.

* I'm not that significant.

* I'm not worth someone else's time listening to me.

* I'm not skilled at what I am doing.

Although the thought was about my book, the feelings I had were actually about myself.

Wait.

So I'm allowing my insecurities about writing to dictate who I am as a person?

Really?

I'm not going to write a book because I believe that I'm boring?

And there's starts the journey, not only the attack on the thoughts you think, but the redefining work at the very core of your heart--your perception of your identity.

It is answering the question of, "who am I, really?" When I realize that I have a deep-rooted belief that I'm not that interest or not worth someone else's time, I get to start reshaping my perception of who I am.

That's when I pull out a special trick.

It's not complicated, but I'll pull out a sheet of paper and make a list of all the wrong things I'm believing about myself in one column. Then, in the other column, I will make a list of all the truth that I should believe about myself. For example

* I am interesting and engaging.

* I am significant

* I am worth other people listening to me.

* I do have skills other people will benefit from.

And then, whether consciously or unconsciously, I start absorbing those trust.

Some days, I will read these statements aloud, just to remind myself. Other days, I will wait until I question myself, and then I'll remind myself what I really am.

But when I do this, my brain goes on super-strength radar, watching out for these silly lies that I believe, not about my circumstances but about myself. And whenever it seems them, it puts up its guard. And then it subtly reminds me to focus my attention on the truth.

Your definition of "I AM" is probably your most important answer in your whole life, and it's a foundational belief that will shape you and drive you toward your destination.

If you find yourself constantly tossed around, you have to take the time to resolve this.
