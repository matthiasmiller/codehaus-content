# **Title**

The drift that people experience is just a deceptive version of "line upon line" and 'precept upon precept'.

growth comes through a series of concessions that opens up the possibilities for new beliefs.

the same with drift.

but you have to make those concessions to avoid dismissing truth as non-sensical. a lot of people would dismiss me because they don't understand where i'm coming from, because they haven't seen the trail markers of my growth.
