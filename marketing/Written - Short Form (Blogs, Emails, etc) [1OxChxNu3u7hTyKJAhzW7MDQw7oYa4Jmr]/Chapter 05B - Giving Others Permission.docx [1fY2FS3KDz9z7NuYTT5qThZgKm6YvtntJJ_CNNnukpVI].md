## **Empowering Others to Be Themselves**

How do you learn to completely be yourself?

It is important, as you approach this, to approach your personal development from the sense of serving other people and to break free from the sense of entitlement that is so prevalent.

The best way to learn to be yourself is to give others that permission first. You might never get others' permission to be yourself, but you can give yourself that permission. And the easiest way to learn how to give that permission is by offering to give other people that permission.

Here are some practical ways to give other people permission to be themselves.

## **Truly Value Others Interests**

When I began my coaching classes, one of my first lessons was developing listening skills. I realized, much to my horror, how poor my listening skills were.

One morning, I was talking with a friend over breakfast, and he asked me if I had any experience with a particular online retailer. I said, "Yes. Why?" He told me the story of his headache purchasing a new piece of electronics from them. As he was telling the story, I immediately found myself digging through my memory, trying to recall the similar poor experience I had when I ordered from the same retailer.

I caught myself, realized what I was doing--I was breaking one of the most fundamental principles of listening. I was listening for myself in his story, and I was truly more absorbed in my own experiences than I was in his.

I have no idea how it impacted my friend--probably he's got more friends like me, and hopefully he's learned that I can do better than that. However, it left a deep impression on me.

That day, I renewed my challenge to listen deeply to other people--to pay attention to the things that matter to them. I became committed to live in the present in my conversations, and to allow myself to become engaged with the other person's interests.

as I began to recognize other people's interests, I started giving myself more awareness of my own interests. I began to value my own interests more, because I realized how unique and individual they are. I realized that, rather than to try to find people who share my interest, I can use this tool of listening to value other people's interest.

this is all an attempt to break a simple lie that we tell ourselves, "Your interests don't matter." and breaking that lie in your interactions with other people will help you to break that lie in your own life.

No matter what situation you are in, this is a simple way you can change. We become dissatisfied because it feels like our life is incongruent. We are unable to express our interests at our workplace or at home--and yet, we are unwilling to make the cultural shift that we require. It's a double standard.

No surprisingly, letting go of that double standard allows you a greater level of satisfaction and sense of congruence, because even if your life is not fully aligned with your interests, it is aligned with your value for aligning yourself with those interests.

## **You are Amazing**

In a world of pressure and achievements and activity, it's sometimes easy to forget that you are amazing just for being you.

My wife and I constantly remind each other of that. It's that one phrase that we use the most, second to "I love you". It's a simple reminder to remember what we offer the world, that we hold something special that the world needs, and that despite all of the challenges that we face, we are still amazing\!

And you are amazing, too\! To prove my point, here's another journaling exercise:

1. Take out a piece of paper and list 3-5 skills that come more easily for you than people around you

2. Also list 3-5 skills that you've developed that many people around you haven't developed.

Many times, instead of filling out our "assets" column, we simply fill out our "liabilities" column. We focus on everything that we are lacking, instead of focusing on what we have.

The truth of the matter is that you were put into this world to fill up what other people were lacking, and you were surrounded by people who need exactly what you have to offer.

For the past three months, I've been consistently blown away by the wisdom in the people who surround me. This isn't because I've suddenly decided to find a group of wiser, more intelligent friends. This is because I started looking and listening for the "amazing" in them, and as I have, my life has been dramatically affected.

You, too, are surrounded by people who have unique talents and insight that are very different from you. Sometimes we must first believe we ourselves are amazing before we can see it others. Sometimes we must see it in others before we can see it in ourselves.

Sometimes we're so blind to our own strengths that we can't see it in ourselves. The trouble with our blind spots is that we can't see them, and the problem with being deceived is that we can't tell what it happens. It's absolutely important for us to have people around us who can help us out. If you can't see your own strengths, I ask you to find people around you and ask them this question:

"What is one thing that comes really easily for me that most people struggle with?"

You have to take it at their word. We often take it for granted that our strengths are also the strengths of the people around us, but it's not true. And that's why it's so helpful to get someone else's perspective.

## **You are Important**

You were born to be a critical piece to missing problem, and learning to embrace that means learning to embrace the simple reality that you were born to solve a problem.

You are critical to the success of someone, and learning how to embrace who you are is part of what empowers you to be that critical piece. However, you cannot become that answer unless you acknowledge that you are a critical piece.

it's not just that the world is a better place because of you. the world would be a worse place because of you. if the world were a puzzle, you are a piece that the world needs to complete the picture, and no one else carries that part of the picture..

you challenge, then, is learning to be who you were meant to be so that you can perfectly fit that piece of the puzzle. it might mean wandering across the enter puzzle, looking for places where you fit, or almost fit. However, each step and each attempt will bring you closer to where you need to be.

## **You are Valuable**

My wife loves puzzles, and she'll buy them from the thrift store just because she loves to put puzzles together. Of course, buying puzzles from the thrift store is a huge gamble, because you don't know until you've practically completed the puzzle whether you have any missing pieces.

That's why you pay $2 for a puzzle instead of $25.

If you had to put a price on that last puzzle piece, that piece is worth $23.

You are that puzzle piece. You are not merely amazing, not merely important, but you are valuable. Who you are compounds the value of the people around you.

Remember my conversation with my friend? The reason I wanted to go back and redo that conversation was because I realized I communicated something I didn't want to communicate. I realized that by brushing off his story, I was subtly telling him that I didn't care about the things that mattered to him. In other words, I didn't demonstrate that he was valuable.

I engage in conversations sometimes that are far from my interests. However, I do it for a very specific reason: I do it to communicate value to other people. I want them to know that they are like that last puzzle piece--that they are valuable.

I want you to know that, too. You're not valuable because off what you have to contribute, or because of your intelligence. You are valuable because of the intrinsic value of a human life--you are valuable just for being you.

Valuable simply means "having value". And to really learn how to embrace who you are and were created to be, you need to embrace the fact that you are valuable. You need to, quite frankly, learn to value yourself.

Some people are so scared of arrogance that they are unwilling to put any value on themselves. Others are so scared of being undervalued that they become arrogant.

Your job is to do two things: value yourself, and value others. That is exactly what will keep you from becoming arrogant or a doormat.

## **No More Excuses**

I must make one final warning. Many people make excuses for bad behavior and bad attitudes because it's "just the way I am". This is nothing more than a bad excuse.

You cannot blame your personality for your negative attitude. That's part of you that you can change. It's not "just the way you are". You get to choose your attitude. If you find yourself believing that your personality is intrinsic to who you are, start looking for an excuse, because it's likely hiding right under your nose\!

You cannot hide behind the fact that you're not a natural.

No Olympic athlete was born a natural top-performer. Of course, children are naturally drawn in certain directions, often corresponding to their personal talents. However, anyone who has achieved any measure of greatness has invested days, months, and years into who they are today.

The fact that you're not a natural leader is simply an excuse to avoid becoming a better leader than you were yesterday. This is not intrinsic to who you are. Many of the talents that we suppose are inborn are talents that are actually learned at a very young age. While the exact role of leadership may vary for you, the skill of leadership will serve you very well, no matter where you are.

The truth is, I can argue that I'm not a natural at writing. When I was in elementary school, my mother would worth with me on my writing assignments, because I would be frustrated to the point of tears. What's natural about a kid who can't even write a simple paragraph for a writing assignment? How is he supposed to someday first write a kid's book, then a full-length personal development book?

Here's why.

That kid also had a sixth grade teacher who believed in him, and challenged him to write and illustrate his first book. (Believe me, you don't want to see it\!) It didn't win any awards by any means, but that's exactly what it took for me to unlock my love for writing. From there, it took off, and I've been writing ever since.

But I'm not a natural.

What's your excuse? What are the things that you're not a "natural" at? Any chance that those pieces, especially if they keep haunting you, are actually part of what you were created to do and be? What if you've simply embraced a limiting mindset that keeps you from pushing forward? What if you believe it simply because nobody else saw that potential?

Will you be the first to see that potential in yourself?

Give yourself that privilege, because you truly are amazing, important, and valuable.
