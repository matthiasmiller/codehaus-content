# **Dancing on the High Wire:** *An Unconventional Look at Productivity*

Two individuals sit in an office. The first person's desk is buried under stacks of papers. He shuffles papers to find his ringing phone. As he picks it up, he awkwardly digs through the pile of papers to find a sticky note and pen to scrawl a quick message. The moment he hangs up the phone, he dashes down the hall to pour himself a cup of coffee.

The second person's desk has a few stacks of papers, although by comparison, it's neatly organized. His phone buzzes. As he picks it up, he too reaches for a notepad and pen to scrawl a quick message. However, as he hangs up the phone, he calmly stands up and strolls down the hall to pour himself a cup of coffee.

If you had to guess from this description, which individual would you consider to be the most productive?

Tough question from a brief snapshot, eh?

Is it the individual with frenetic mannerisms or the individual who is calm, focused, and deliberate?

Let's take a look at what productivity actually means and why conventional approaches to productivity don't work well.

# **You can't see productivity until it's over.**

In business and life, you have two kinds of metrics:

* Metrics you can measure immediately.  
* Metrics you can't measure until after the fact.

As a simple example, even though revenue is a critical number in your business, you can't measure that until it's occurred. However, as long as you have a steady pipeline, you can measure the number of leads you reach out to on a daily basis.

The "to do" list works the same way. It simply captures your productivity "after the fact" based on the things you accomplished. While you have some control over the outcomes, it still leaves you vulnerable to situations that require coordinating with other people.

When you get to the end of the day, you can review your list and see the things that you've accomplished. However, it provides you with no feedback regarding the things you need to change to make tomorrow a better day.

## **We've been lied to about the productivity equation.**

To make matters worse, you may have been influenced by the conventional view of productivity. This productivity equation goes something like this: "productivity \= amount of activity \* length of time". If you need to get more done, get up earlier and stay up a little later. Move faster between appointments.

Many of us, when we find ourselves under pressure, will attempt to cram more activities into a shorter period of time.

While this approach works well for small, incremental improvements, it often leads to unsustainable work habits because it requires us to operate at high energy levels all of the time. This isn't sustainable for any human.

To make matters worse, many times the amount of effort we exert doesn't end up dramatically changing how quickly things are accomplished.

If you're like many of us, if you reach the end of the day with many things left undone on your list, you'll wake up the next morning and simply resolve to redouble your efforts with every last bit of your willpower.

Unfortunately, as you find that your willpower doesn't always drive the outcomes on your "to do" list, you'll also find your motivation starting to wane. In fact, if you continue this pattern over time, you'll find it taking a physical toll on your body.

If you can't measure activity sustained over a length of time, what are things that you can effectively measure?

## **I've found three core drivers for productivity.**

I want to make something very clear: I'm a student of productivity. While I don't pretend to be a guru master, I've seen a dramatic increase in my own productivity. Many people are surprised at how little time I spend creating this newsletter.

While I’ll share part of the secret with you in a moment, I wasn’t content with my level of productivity. A significant part of my focus last month involved actively expanding this to other parts of my business and life.

With that in mind, I've found three metrics that drive the outcome of my productivity. Whenever these score at a low level, I find myself spinning my wheels and getting very poor results.

These metrics are:

1. Priority \-- is this outcome actually important for moving my business forward?  
2. Clarity \-- how clear am I about the outcome I want to achieve and how to reach it?  
3. Engagement \-- how strongly does this task fit my mode of working?

These are simple metrics that you can score from 1-10 that will, in large degree, determine your level of productivity.

If you've read books on productivity with additional principles or metrics, I need to add one more caveat. I don't even pretend to give you a full picture of productivity, because there's absolutely no way I can fit it into this article. I'm just painting a piece of the picture, so run with me for now\!

## **Metric \#1: Do the right thing.**

This is simple yet difficult. Focusing on the high-priority, critically important tasks requires an almost obsessive focus on the outcome you're looking to create.

To make matters worse, these tasks almost always invite significant resistance, which I talk about more in my video multiplier.link/resistance.

This is one of the hardest things, yet it's almost always possible to determine this before you start the task. And it's a metric that, at some point in the future, will clearly drive other outcomes in your business.

Let's be clear: focus on the most important things, and you will make more money.

## **Metric \#2: Clarify what you need.**

It took me years to understand that lack of clarity kills productivity.

When I get stuck on a project, I've learned to start specifically looking for areas where I lack clarity. I start reaching out to other people to help clarify the missing pieces.

You don't need to have a crystal clear picture of the future. However, you do need to have a crystal-clear picture of today. Every day.

There's absolutely no way I can cover in a simple newsletter article how crucial this is and how it typically shows up for individuals. I simply urge you to spend the time asking yourself this question: "How clear am I about the *what* and the *how* that I'm pursuing?"

## **Metric \#3: Fit the task into your mode of working.**

Over the past few years--and even over the past few months--I've found tremendous insights about the things that allow me to highly engage with my work.

While some of the tactics may apply to you, I find that many times, these tactics are intensely personal. That's why I believe many productivity hacks fail, simply because they're suited to a certain type of individual. True engagement demands that you become self-aware about the places where you can create your results.

Rather than prescribe a set of tips, I want to give a few glimpses into what works for me.

First of all, I love to be put on the spot. While I do best with some level of preparation, I do my best work in the moment under someone else's eyes. My most creative ideas come when I'm spontaneously working on a problem.

I can't explain to you how I do it, or why it works. I just know that it does. It's part of my magic that I can't explain. In fact, I've started generating all my content this way. Even though you can't see it, I produce this newsletter as a "live performance". I sit down, I write, and I get it done. I leave it to my team to edit it.

For some of you, this would drive you crazy. However, it's the only way I have to get the insights that I've encountered out of me onto paper.

Second, most people assume that because I love to be put on the spot, I'm unstructured. Not true.

I have an incredibly high need for structure. I've created a schedule that supports me, and whenever my schedule gets disrupted, it always throws me sideways.

I value time--my own and others. Most people don't know that I'm usually tempted to send an "I'm going to be late" text when I'm going to be two minutes late for an appointment. If you've ever scheduled a phone call with me, you know that I'll do everything I can to call you precisely at the scheduled time.

Last of all, I've become deeply in tune with my motivation. Rather than wasting precious space on describing that, I want to make it clear...most of my innate motivation was buried underneath years of conditioning, thinking, and believing that kept it locked inside. That's why last month's newsletter on shame has been such a game-changer.

If you're going to be fully engaged, you must understand your innate interests and motivation, and you need to deliberately move into that place as much as possible.

Put all these things together, and you've got my spin on my own magic--something that for this edition of the Multiplier, we're going to call "Dancing on the High Wire".

Because that's me. That's how I function. That's how I'm most productive.

## **What about you?**

If you're serious about increasing your productivity, I challenge you to go beyond merely scrutinizing your effort, activity, and time. Dig deeper.

Be committed to your priorities. Stop tolerating ambiguity. And become a student of yourself--your mode of working, your motivation.

When you do that, your productivity is not something that's left to chance. It's something that you can deliberately control and create. And that's how you're going to make your unique mark on the world.
