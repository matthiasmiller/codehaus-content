This edition of *The Multiplier* is probably the most raw version you've ever read. I’ll admit, I’m a little scared, but I think you’re going to love it.

The past few months, I felt life piling up on me. Last month, during a 90-minute Skype session, I uncorked major pieces of my life. It's been life-changing. That was the inspiration for this month's letter. You're bound to see more of those outcomes unfold over the coming months.

I also recently realized I needed to make a few adjustments to *The Multiplier*. We're including a "Real Life" column, simply because business and entrepreneurship extend far beyond the office. This month, I'm sharing a tactic my wife and I use almost every day to help calm our children when they're upset.

Lastly, by the time this lands in your mailbox, Thanksgiving is only a few weeks away. Do yourself a favor and reflect on the good things you’ve encountered this year.

And thank you for who you are and for the contribution you make in the world\!
