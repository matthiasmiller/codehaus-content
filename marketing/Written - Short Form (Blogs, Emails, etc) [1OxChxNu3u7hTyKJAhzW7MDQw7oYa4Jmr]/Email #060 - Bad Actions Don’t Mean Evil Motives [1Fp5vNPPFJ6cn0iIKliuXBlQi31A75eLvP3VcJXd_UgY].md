* Bad Actions Don’t Mean Evil Motives

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

Did you ever read those “choose your own adventure” books growing up? You know, the ones where you get to the end of the chapter and it tells you to turn to page 59 if Janet chooses Option A, but if she chooses Option B, then turn to page 65? They used to be a big deal back in the day.

Well, today I’m going to tell you a “choose your own adventure” story, only this time you get to be the protagonist.

Imagine you’ve been hired as a lead salesperson at a new tech company. You arrive at work Monday morning ready to conquer anything the week throws at you.

Marching to your new workspace, you greet your coworkers, Tyler and Ame, who are chatting up a storm by the espresso machine. Making a mental note to bring your own personal mug tomorrow, you round the corner and nearly run over your new manager. 

“Good morning, ma’am\!” you say, trying to forget the awkward near run-in.

“Mornin’,”  she mumbles.  
   
A little taken aback by her lack of eye contact and low energy, you brush it off and don’t think much about it the rest of the day.

But then the next day, the scene plays itself out again. This time, your boss greets you with an air of a warm smile, but the contortion on her face betrays her real feelings toward you. After several days, just saying “Hello” becomes down right awkward.

Flabbergasted at what you could’ve done to set her against you already, you’re certain she hates you.

Now here’s your choice:

1. Continue assuming that she hates your guts. Uncertain about what’s wrong, you mull it over in your head until you’re convinced she has a vendetta to make you miserable. You discuss it with Tyler and Ame. “Yes,” they agree, “she’s got some marks against you.” Taking this to heart you begin to resent her for it until you openly confront her one day with the full force of your bottled frustration. You eventually walk out after a nasty Steve Jobs style power-struggle.

	  
or you could...

2. Take an opportunity to meet in her office and  just get curious. Ask if there’s anything you’re doing wrong and how you could improve. It may or may not be your fault but at least you’ll know for certain. And you’ll know how to correct ship, if possible.

What do you choose?

Granted, the story may be a little over-dramatic, but you get the point: functioning out of assumptions is a dangerous habit.

And when we do assume, we’re often much quicker to assume negative motives rather than positive motives behind actions we don’t understand.  Whenever we do this, *we destroy trust.* **And without trust, we self-destruct even our most valued relationships.**

The only things we can actually measure are people’s actions and words. Even if someone *does* or *says* something hurtful, we still cannot assume their motives. They may not be doing it because they’re militant. In fact, most likely, they’re doing it ***because they feel pressured and uncared for***.

This doesn’t excuse their hurtful deeds. Every one of us has a responsibility to do good to others. But just because they are responsible for their actions, doesn’t mean we have a right to assume the worst about their motives.

To do so would not only shoot our own businesses in the foot, but it would ruin our relationships as well.

Believe the best about your fellow man and you’ll continue to…

Be the best you\!

Imagine you’ve been called into your boss's office. Trying not to look nervous, you manage a weak I-have-nothing-to-hide smile. She returns the smile and closes the door before going back behind her desk.

There you are, fidgeting with your own fingers, trying to remember what you did.
