Remember when you were a kid, how you’d plop your quarter on the counter at the corner store in exchange for a hard piece of brand new bubble gum? You’d pop it in your mouth and wrap that tough gum around your tongue, blowing until you were red in the face just to get a bubble as big as you could.

Then it would POP\! and you’d peel the sticky mess off your face and out of your hair.

Businesses are like bubble gum.

Just like that brand new piece of gum, they will explode in your face if you grow them too fast with too little support.

As entrepreneurs, we are hungry for results. We love to jump in head first at warp speed to either “go big” or “go home”.

This simply isn’t sustainable. Of course you want your business to grow and make money fast.

But if you only focus your attention on getting as many customers as you can, you won’t give them the quality attention they deserve. 

Instead of having a small number of happy customers who are willing to open their wallets, you’ll have a large amount of disgruntled customers and employees who will simply walk away.

And you’ll be left picking the bubble gum off your face and out of your hair.

It's tempting to race from crisis to crisis, doing the most urgent thing. However, your goal in business isn’t merely results. Your real job is to create and grow a scalable business. 

And that’s something that demands more than just your hustling. It demands strength and reinforcement.

When you grow like that, you’ll have the confidence that you’re strong for the long haul.

What’s more, you won’t be stuck picking the sticky mess out of your hair.

And always remember, be the best you.
