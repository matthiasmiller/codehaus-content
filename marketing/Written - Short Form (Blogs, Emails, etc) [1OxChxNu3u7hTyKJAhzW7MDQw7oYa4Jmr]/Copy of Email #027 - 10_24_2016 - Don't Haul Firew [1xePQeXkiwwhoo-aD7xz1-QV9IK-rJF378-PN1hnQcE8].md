**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

Can you believe winter is just around the corner? If they haven’t done it already, many people are scrambling around chopping and hauling loads of firewood to fuel their furnaces so they stay warm all season long.

Thank God, I don’t depend on a wood furnace to stay warm because I’d have no way to haul it all to my house. VW Jettas aren't exactly ideal for transporting large loads of firewood.

However, if I invested in a brand new F-150, I’d be able to haul firewood no problem.

What’s the difference?

My Jetta wasn’t designed for that kind of work. The F-150 was.

If you want to get the most use out of a tool, you have to use it how it was *designed* to be used. While you can load a small stack of wood in the back of my Jetta, you’ll have better results loading them into a big truck like the F-150. 

The actual *design* of the vehicle dictates what it does best.

If you’re stuck with a problem (i.e. hauling wood), the best question is not *“How do I get more wood in my car?”* but *“How can I redesign my car to carry wood?”* 

That’s when you end up with a truck.

Sometimes we do the same thing with ourselves. 

We put a “load of wood” in our “trunk” and then berate ourselves for not getting anywhere in life. 

In reality, we just need to learn to function according to our *design*. When we learn to do this, we get the greatest leverage for our efforts.

Yes, we can operate outside our design and get things done for awhile, but our effectiveness is limited.

We’ll always have the ability to improvise outside of our giftings in a pinch just like I could use my Jetta to haul wood--in a pinch. We can even get good at “packing the trunk” to its max efficiency, but the best way to get things done will always be to focus on operating the way we were designed.

For example, someone might be especially skilled at relating with people one-on-one. Does that mean they can’t learn how to communicate and move large audiences of people? No. Of course they can learn how to do that--and even be successful at it. But their “sweet-spot,” their forte where they wield the most influence, will be one-on-one.

So how were you “designed?” What jobs and talents do you especially excel at and enjoy? What are some ways you could rearrange your life to best function efficiently?

I’d love to know the areas where you can...

Be the best you?

design is power; simplicity and functionality are driven by design in software development

so with you

when you operate by design, you gain power

*Comments \- so several thoughts:*

* The marvel of the iPhone is in its design. You cannot take any device and dramatically simplify it without fundamentally reworking its design. How something is designed is one of the greatest drivers of a) how well it works, and b) how simple it is.  
    
* The way to get the most use out of a tool, is to use it how it was designed. While you can load a stack of wood in the back of your car, you’re going to have better results loading them into a truck. The actual DESIGN of the vehicle dictates what it does best.

* If you’re stuck with a problem (hauling wood), sometimes the best question is not, how do i get more wood in my car, but “how can I redesign my car to carry wood?” And that’s when you end up with a truck.

  * Sometimes we do the same thing with ourselves. We put a load of wood in our trunk, and we can’t figure out why we can’t get anywhere in life. We need to learn to function according to our DESIGN, and when we learn to do that, that’s where get the greatest leverage for our efforts.


* When we operate outside of our design, yes we can do it for a while, but we greatly limit our effectiveness, and we set an example for others to do it.

Just some thoughts...not sure if that articulates it well?
