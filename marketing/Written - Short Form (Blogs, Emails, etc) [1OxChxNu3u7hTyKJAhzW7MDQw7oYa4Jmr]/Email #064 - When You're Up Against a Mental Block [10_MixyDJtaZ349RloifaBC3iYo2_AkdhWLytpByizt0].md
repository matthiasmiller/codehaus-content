Have you ever had a problem that, no matter how much you obsessed over it, you simply couldn’t find a good solution?

This happens most often in my business, but it can even happen in training my kids or working through a tough relationship. All of a sudden it seems like all the good ideas are used up and I’ve slammed up against a wall.

There’s many tricks to making this entrepreneurial “writer’s block” a thing of the past. 

But today I have a different angle for you to try. Think of it as  It has helped feed my mind with idea seeds that continually sprout into a vast resource of ideas.

Here’s four easy steps I take to producing great ideas.

**Step 1: Read great books**  
The more ideas you have floating around in your mind, the more likely two of them will collide into a fresh solution. 

This doesn’t mean reading all of the latest business guru books (although that is a viable option). Sometimes a simple novel or biography brings the brightest sparks to the imagination and gets it rolling in a direction it has never gone before. 

Don’t waste your time reading good books. Don’t even waste your time reading *entire* books. Read the best parts of great books\! Ask your friends or mentors what their all-time favorite books are (or what fascinating read they’ve just picked up) and read those.

**Step 2: Have inspiring conversations**  
Ideas almost never spark while you’re isolated. Sure, a new thought may come to you while hiking in the Rockies, but it probably developed from a random conversation you had with a buddy over burgers and fries. Especially buddies who are in a different field doing really interesting work.

This week I listened to a presentation by an *electric company*. Not normally fascinating, until you pull back the layers and discover there’s actually a *lot* of interesting principles at play.

Don’t underestimate the power of outside experience and perspective to spark innovation.

**Step 3: Write your best ideas down**  
You simply can’t remember every idea that crosses your mind. But why waste them? Get them down on paper (or in Evernote) so you can always go back to them and rehash them later. 

Truth is, you’ve probably forgotten some of your greatest ideas.

Even if you never return to your archives, the simple act of writing them down will help burn them into your memory.

**Step 4: Try more ideas than you can succeed at**  
You’re never going to succeed if you’re avoiding failure. Have an idea that you like? Try it\! Not only will you learn something new through the process, the journey may take you into a whole new realm of ideas.

Solutions are ideas no one has ever thought of before. The more ideas you have, the more solutions you’ll discover. So do what it takes to create as many ideas as you can, and as you begin failing forward, you’ll start building a list of ground-breaking solutions\!

And as always…

Be the best you\!
