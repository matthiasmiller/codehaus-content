# **Nonprofit PIVOT \- Making the Leap to an Unknown Future When the World Has Permanently Shifted**

If you’ve read my latest leadership journal (or kept your eye on the news), you know that the world has shifted.

Permanently.

When COVID-19 blows over, the world will NOT go back to normal. Here’s what’s certain:

* Some organizations will thrive.  
* Some organizations will survive.  
* Some organizations will fail.

Of the ones that thrive, what will be their distinguishing characteristics?

At a glance, it seems the answer is making an immediate shift to digital fundraising to cover the loss of events cancelled because of COVID-19. For some organizations, this is **exactly what they should do**.

However, it’s not ALL these organizations should do.

When the world has shifted and your organization does not adapt, **even the best digital fundraising campaign will not be able to save you**.

Stephen Covey said it well: “If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.” You must get to the **root of the issue**.

Even if it means facing the truth head-on.

I’m launching a 1-day PIVOT virtual intensive on **Thursday, April 9, from 7 AM to 2:30 PM MDT (9 AM \- 4:30 PM EDT)** to help nonprofit leaders navigate through these times.

## **My Promises**

I’m working feverishly on a more specific agenda and schedule. However, I have a war chest of tools that I will be pulling. Here’s what I can promise you:

* You’ll get the SPECIFIC TOOL you can implement to help you resist the tremendous pressure and reactivity that has dramatically increased over this time. This is something I’m *doubling down on right now*.

* You’re going to get pulled “out of the weeds” of the pandemic and get a clear perspective of the TECTONIC SHIFT that’s happening and how it applies to you. You’ll be able to make stronger, better decisions.

* You’re going to get the FRAMEWORK to think about not only these changes, but also to help you lead your organization into the future. (There ARE more significant shifts coming to your organization this coming decade.)

* You’ll get a STRATEGIC TOOL to best position yourself amidst the changing landscape of other organizations. This is a tool that I’ve developed **in collaboration with Richard Koch, author of *The 80/20 Principle*, which has sold over a million copies.**

* You’re going to get CLARITY into which organizations (businesses or nonprofits) will do well, and which ones will fail during this time.

* You’ll understand the CORE FOUNDATION that underlies your connection with funding sources and your long-term identity, even amidst the changing times.

* You’re going to get NEW IDEAS and INSIGHTS about how you can pivot and cooperate with this change.

* When you sign up, I’ll be offering a VIP PASS that will not only include networking with high-quality leaders but will also include a SPECIAL PRIVATE MENTOR GROUP on **Friday, April 10 from 7 AM to 11 AM MDT (9 AM to 1 PM EDT)** for organizations who really NEED this to work. *This bonus itself could be well worth the price of admission alone.*


I will NOT promise you that this will magically save your organization, double your revenue overnight, or provide some pixie dust solution, but…

I’m going to BEND OVER BACKWARDS to make sure you get maximum value from the event, with a guarantee that nobody else would make.

Let me be clear.

If you’re looking for **mere tactics**, I’m NOT your guy.

But if you’re looking for things that will stand the test of time, keep you grounded during times of pressure, and help you navigate into the unknown, I’m here to help.

Listen…

The last thing I usually do is talk about myself and what I’ve accomplished, but I also know that there are people who NEED to be in this event who will NOT take me seriously unless I do.

## **Who I Am**

Here’s what you need to know about me:

* I’ve spent the past five years studying under one of the world’s highest paid (and accurate and integrous) business consultants, applying those lessons into real-life situations.

* As mentioned previously, I’ve collaborated with a highly successful business strategist and investor who worked for some of the top consulting firms before starting his own strategy consulting firm.

* When I revealed the framework that I’m going to reveal at the event, I had an internationally-recognized coach message me privately and write, “Dude...I love your outcome...my question is **where is the camera**? You are so close to **what I’ve been thinking but not able to get it down** when it comes to entrepreneurs and small business.”

* I’m the author of the \#1 Amazon bestselling book *Winning Together*. It’s a parable of the power of collaboration. You can read it tonight, and start applying it tomorrow.

* The past five years, I’ve actively **honed in on my unique ability**, and I’m confident and CLEAR on the places where I deliver the absolute top value. This event is ENGINEERED around that unique ability.

* I’m obsessed about getting people the outcome they need. I am NOT coming from a classroom or an ivory tower. I’ve got bruises and scars from the real world. I know how much the RIGHT advice can help at the RIGHT time, but I also know how devastating the RIGHT advice at the WRONG time can be. I viscerally know the pain of investing into professional development (MANY TIMES MORE than this event) and walking away with NOTHING to show for it except money out the door and a notch on the belt of discernment.

Enough from me.

## **What Others Say**

Here’s what others have said about me.

From Frank Sinclair, Chief Encouragement Officer, Dream Again Business Consulting

He is not comfortable inside the confines of a traditional problem solver. His amazing and creative mind is constantly uncovering new and better ways to help you reach and exceed your goals. Here is the greater separator of all, his heart for his clients exceeds the unrivaled intellect.

From Brad Rowland, Board Member, Fremont Economic Development Corporation:

From the beginning, it was clear that Matthias is an innovator at heart, deeply committed to excellence, and actively creating positive change within the community. I can't imagine having done this project without his expertise, and I'd highly recommend him to any nonprofit who's looking to open up new opportunities for their organization.

From Mark Davy, CEO, Private Leader, Inc:

I have had the privilege to work with Matthias and collaborate with him in meetings. He consistently provides a sharp strategic mindset, problem solving insight, resourceful advice, and an encouraging attitude and spirit. I enjoy working with Matthias and continually seek to include him in my work.

And there’s more, but I had to cut it off somewhere.

I’m sure you’re wondering...

## **What Will This Event Cost?**

I’m sure you’re wondering what this event will cost.

First, some context....

Right before the pandemic hit the United States, we were ready to launch an in-person 2-day event **with THE SAME KIND OF HIGH QUALITY material for $1499**. We had strong interest in the event before we even launched.

We had to cancel the event.

Even turning it into a virtual 1-day event, I believe we could legitimately charge $999 for this experience, and it **could be some of the BEST money** you’d spend on professional development this year.

Yesterday afternoon, as I was wrapping up this offer, **I decided to charge $499 for this event**. I’d nailed down the price, sent it to my copyeditor, and we were getting ready to send it out and start promoting this event.

Then something happened last night.

I had this thought, “What if I **lowered the price to $99** so that I could help more people?”

Immediately, I was interrupted by fear and self-doubt. “What if people don’t take it seriously and actually apply it if I practically give it away? What if it’s SO cheap that they disregard it?”

Then I started thinking back to my past.

I thought about the excuses that I’ve used in the past to stop getting the help that I really needed. I thought about my own barriers I had to overcome to be willing to invest in the mentors who have helped me move forward. I thought about the **gifts of radical generosity** that I’ve been privileged to receive.

I also thought about the people I wanted to serve.

I thought about the lives that would be impacted if I *didn’t* get training into the hands of as many people as possible.

That’s when I made the decision to eradicate every possible excuse. I decided to **open up the doors for as little as $29**.

This is for the **same kind of high quality material we were going to charge $1499 for**. Because of opportunities that unexpectedly opened up to us this past week, we’re **adding more to our arsenal**, and you’ll even be **getting significantly BETTER content** than what we’d originally planned.

This is NOT for organizations who are trying to figure out how to spend the last dollars of their budget. This is NOT for organizations who are unwilling to invest in themselves and apply what they learn.

This is for organizations who are COMMITTED to learning, taking action, and adapting as needed to move forward. It will apply for small startups and large organizations alike.

Remember what I said about eradicating excuses?

I recognize that we live in an unstable time, and you have a responsibility to your donors. Because of that, I’m doing something that I’ve rarely seen for ANY event, and I’ve NEVER seen for a nonprofit event.

## **The Unbeatable Guarantee**

For this event, I’m offering a **110% guarantee.** The conditions are simple.

If your organization has at least $100,000 annual revenue, you show up to the event, and the value you get in the first **two hours** does not rival what you’ll get from many conferences in the **two days**, you can just log off and shoot us an email.

We’ll not only refund your money, but we’ll also **pay you an additional 10% of your registration fee** for the hassle. (You may need to allow up to 90 days for the refund.)

The burden of proof is 100% on me. You’ve literally got nothing to lose.

As I said, I’m committed to obliterating excuses.

## **What Next?**

I’ve done absolutely everything I know to remove every single barrier to you getting the help you need to move forward during this time.

I don’t want you to look back at this time a few months from now and regret that you didn’t take advantage of this. I do NOT plan to make this material available for this price ever again.

## **P.S.**

Sometimes I hear people say, “I’m too busy for this kind of thing.” The real reason many people are busy is because they haven’t prioritized the CRITICALLY IMPORTANT pieces.

The most important things in life are not the things you find time for. They’re the things you MAKE time for.

One of my mentors once told me, “If you’re asking if you have time, you’re in the wrong mindset.” And I’ve repeatedly rearranged my schedule based on his advice.
