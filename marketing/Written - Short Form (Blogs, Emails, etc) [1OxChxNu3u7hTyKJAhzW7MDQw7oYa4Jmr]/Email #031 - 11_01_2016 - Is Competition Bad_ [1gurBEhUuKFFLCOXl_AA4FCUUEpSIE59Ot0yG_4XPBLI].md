Have you ever been around people who take competition too seriously?

It seems like there’s always that one jock who turns your casual back-yard Thanksgiving football into the Super Bowl.

“Chill, bro, it’s just a game\!” you shoot back.

Or maybe you’ve felt the heat at work. Perhaps you feel as if your job is a rat-race to the top with employee against employee vying for approval from the boss.

Does it feel like people resent you for doing well? Whether it’s workplace success or ordinary good deeds, people give you sideways glances for being the “teacher's pet” or “goody-two-shoes.”

Unfortunately, because of our bad experiences, we falsely conclude that “Competition is not good\!” We don’t want to make our coworkers jealous, so we quit trying as hard to please the boss. Or we hate being the “goody-two-shoes” at church, so we avoid letting people know about the homeless man we took in for month. 

Competition can be a good and playful motivator to build camaraderie and get things done. But when “winning” becomes a personal evaluation, it gives room to unhealthy competition. In such an environment, people’s feelings will get hurt if you outperform them because they feel their worth has been devalued.

Unhealthy competition develops when people start linking their value to their performance. 

Next time you’re tempted to say “My workplace is too competitive\!” make sure neither you nor others have attached worth to performance.

Don’t strive to prove your value, strive to help others.When that’s your focus,, whether you’ve “won” or “lost” you’re a success.

And never forget…

To be the best you\!

# **7\. Competition**

Healthy Competition cannot exist in an environment where worth is measured in performance. Because to beat you is personal. People's feelings might get hurt if you outperform. And if you beat them, they might believe they are less than you. 

This affects teams, business owners, entrepreneurs, etc.

The more you have at stake personally, the more likely you’re going to enter a “fight or flight”, do or die, kind of state. And that actually works AGAINST you.
