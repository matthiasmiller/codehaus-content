There's something called the "Observer effect" that observing a situation changes the outcome. This is because the instruments required to measure it interfere. For example, if you want to measure the speed of your team, the things they have to do to track their time might slow them down. It can also influence feedback--unfortunately, people will give more transparent feedback when they know that the parties at stake aren't listening or watching. You must increase transparency to reduce the "observer effect".
