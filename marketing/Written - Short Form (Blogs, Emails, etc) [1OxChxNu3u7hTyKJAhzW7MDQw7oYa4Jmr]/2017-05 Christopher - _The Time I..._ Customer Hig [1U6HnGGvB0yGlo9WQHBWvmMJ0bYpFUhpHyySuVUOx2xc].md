**Target: 400 *Customer Highlight***

Eric Hunsberger was snowed under with paperwork when we first started working together. 

Tired of always trudging through the days when he lost a piece of paperwork, misplaced a customer's phone number, or forgot about another project when he estimated a customer's shed delivery date. He knew there had to be a better way. There had to be a solution that would allow him to manage this workflow without adding more complexity to his already crazy life.

That's when he sat down with our team to discuss options.

When we talk with a potential client, we always begin with trying to understand the business processes, systems, and workflows. Although software can never replace healthy business systems, it can provide a strong support for the business systems.

Eric explained the entire sales and fulfillment process, from the inbound call, the bids and proposals, the signed agreements, the build schedule, to the delivery process. We clarified as many details as possible, identifying areas in the business with unclear expectations and responsibilities.

We developed a custom software solution tailored specifically to Eric’s needs. It didn't take long for him to start seeing the measurable benefits of the system. Most importantly, he started having peace of mind with his work, since he was eliminating many of the small yet challenging issues that pulled him away from his most important work--making sales.

Now that he had a checklist for his orders, the crew had everything they needed on their work orders and didn't have to wait in his office for 10 minutes while he wrapped up his sales call. And if they did have questions, he could simply pull up the invoice on his computer and remember the answer in minutes.

He started providing more accurate timeframes to his prospects. He could see the outstanding work orders and could accurately estimate when a shed was going to be delivered. He was also able to see when his sales pipeline started drying up.

If he needed to reach out to any lead, new customer, or past customer, he could easily find them and review all their order details. When he wanted to follow up, it only took a few clicks, not a few minutes of shuffling through stacks of papers to find the invoice.

With a little help, Eric was able to crawl out from under that paperwork snow-bank and start getting results. Not only did Eric simplify his life, because of this, he was also able to help more people simplify their lives by getting the storage they needed.
