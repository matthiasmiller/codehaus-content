# **Silent Killers**

Over the past few months, I've shared some of my personal journey of changing some of my habits that have been part of my life for years. Two months ago, I significantly cut my caffeine consumption. Whereas I would regularly drink a few cups of coffee a day, I've switched to one or two cups of decaf. Some days I don't drink any coffee at all.

With that, I've seen significant benefits. I've started sleeping much better at night. I've started drinking more water. In fact, I've found that many times when I thought I craved caffeine, I was simply thirsty. My body needed more water to function well.

Last month I sent an email to my brother John Allan, an extremely talented and creative software engineer, about my experiment. In my email, I mentioned that caffeine takes a toll on your adrenal glands. This immediately got his attention.

He decided to eliminate caffeine from his diet. He was unaware of how much caffeine he had been consuming, and he decided to quit cold-turkey. (By the way, he doesn’t recommend this. Consider gradually reducing your caffeine intake over a two week period. If you have your last coffee on Friday morning, it’ll allow you to feel good that day, while giving time over the weekend to start the detox.)

He was sick for two weeks. At first, he couldn't focus. He was irritable. He was depressed, and his  muscles ached. He was only able to work 2-3 hours each day. After a week, he just had low energy. And all of those are powerful triggers for wanting to brew a big black cup of coffee.

However, once those two weeks were over, he returned to his normal, happy self--with more energy than he had before. His systolic blood pressure dropped 8 points, from prehypertension to normal. He started dreaming more at night, evidence that his body is entering a deeper rest state than before.

He told me later, “That email added a few years to my life.” He wasn’t joking.

Sound extreme? Perhaps.

Or perhaps not\!

It might simply be a magnification of what many people do to their bodies every single day. Ironically, I’m writing this article at a local coffee shop. I ordered a 16-ounce decaf americano. Three-fourths through my cup, I’m feeling quite jittery. I actually had to ask the barista to make sure she made decaf (yes, she had). Three months ago, I could drink a 20-ounce caffeinated latte without feeling jittery. Now, decaf coffee has enough caffeine to stimulate my body *more* than that 20-ounce caffeinated latte. (Five hours later, I still felt the effect of the caffeine.)

How is a caffeine habit anywhere *close* to beneficial?

Most interesting, however, was the insight my brother shared from the book *Caffeine Blues*. In it, the author pointed out that years ago, smokers argued smoking wasn't harmful. Why? There were no clear, immediate side-effects.

Time has proven otherwise.

Today, most people don’t talk about the negative effects of caffeine, either. Specifically:

1. Caffeine continually suppresses your body's signals that it's tired. Essentially, your body works harder to tell your brain, "I'm tired. I need to sleep." To make matters worse, caffeine has a life cycle that often results in restless sleep.

2. Caffeine reduces blood flow to your brain by 30%. Cut caffeine from your life, and you’ll automatically boost your advantage over your competitors through your clarity of thought.

3. Caffeine introduces a “fight or flight” response. While this helps us focus on short-term tasks, it introduces stress hormones and turns off the part of the brain that focuses on long-term strategic thinking.

 Sound like a recipe for disaster?

Sure is\!

Any coincidence that the largest coffee chain also serves coffee with the highest level of caffeine? It's a matter of simple economics. The more people rely on coffee, the easier it is to create a reliable stream of revenue.

Sound a little controversial and bit too much like a conspiracy theory? I would have said the same thing if it hadn’t been for my own experience. And my brother’s. And I wouldn’t have to search far to find others with similar experiences.

Here’s the critical question. How many serious symptoms will you notice when you start drinking caffeine?

Some people may simply find they don't sleep as soundly as they did. However, this isn't a big concern because it has an easy solution. Just grab a cup of joe on your way to work. Jolt yourself awake. Meanwhile, the problem self-perpetuates.

For other people, the problem may be more severe. If you quench your thirst with another caffeine burst, you may find yourself slightly dehydrated, lowering your cognition and even causing muscle pain.

What's my point?

The most obvious point is this:

## Your best work will always come when you're fully rested.

This means getting a good night's sleep and taking regular time away from your business. The economy is moving away from surviving with grind alone. You've got to make the shift from simply working harder, to being able to integrate solid thinking into your life.

You can't do that when you're depleted of sleep, water, and healthy nutrition.

I'm convinced the future belongs to those who are able to live with their eyes wide open.

However, there’s a much deeper point.

Most of us spend our lives looking for quick fixes that undermine our success.

Smoking is a “quick fix” for feeling down. In the short-term, it boosts the release of endorphins in your body, making you feel good. In the long-term, it will kill you.

Caffeine is a quick fix for frustrated, tired, and stuck entrepreneurs. For adrenaline-hungry hunters, it’s the perfect way to boost your hustle and get more done, at least in the short-term. Ironically, it actually *prevents* the kind of thinking required for long-term effectiveness. Unless you start pulling those "silent killers" from your life, you'll never start seeing the *real* silent killers that are out to get you.

## **Your greatest threats aren't always obvious or immediate.**

The greatest threat to your future may not be your failures, but your successes. According to Jim Collins, pride and over-confidence are often the greatest threats to a company's success.

Why?

Because it blinds them to reality.

The telegrapher on the Titanic was too preoccupied with his daily tasks, sending and receiving messages for the passengers, to recognize the importance of the notice that they were approaching an iceberg.

Sounds a little like life and business, eh?

Nose to the grindstone. Focused on moving ahead. Unable to see the fact that you're rapidly approaching an iceberg.

It might be a relationship in crisis. It might be a son who needs your attention or a daughter who's struggling through relationships with her peers. It might be your wife who's facing challenges at home, and you're too busy to recognize it.

It might be your personal health. Too focused on getting things done, you're unaware of the toll that the early mornings and late nights are taking on your body. Too busy for a workout, you don't notice the gradual deterioration of your health.

It might be your spiritual well-being. Too worried about maintaining your business, you no longer have time to disconnect from work and recharge. Somewhere you've lost touch with the real reason you were in business, and you're slowly losing your edge.

It might be your emotional health. You might not notice that you've drifted away from the role that refuels your personal energy. You might not realize it's costing you much-needed emotional energy. You may find underneath the surface you've got unresolved issues slowly bubbling to the surface, showing up at the most inopportune times.

It might be with your team. Obsessed with other problems you face in your business, you might not notice one of your most important team members is losing interest in her job. In a rush to find someone to fill a crucial role, you may miss that they're a complete misfit for the job.

It might be with your business. Focused on getting the next contract, you may fail to recognize a competitor who is eating away at your market share. You may be preoccupied with fulfillment, not realizing you've sacrificed quality and relationships with your customers until months later, you find your referrals dropping because of the quality of your work has dropped.

As entrepreneurs who thrive on quick, improvised solutions, we sometimes opt for the quick, short-term fix in the pressure of the moment.

It might be a brutal one-hour workout, damaging your body instead of improving it. It might be a rushed weekend away with your wife in a desperate attempt to reconnect. It might be a last-minute meeting to attempt to salvage your employee's role at work, offering a raise in hopes of enticing her to stay. It might be a hustle to meet unfulfilled orders, putting unrealistic expectations on your team.

While these appear to be great solutions and provide a sense of satisfaction, they bring a high long-term cost.

## **Silent killers lie beneath the "band-aid fixes" of our problems.**

Symptoms are easy to identify and easy to solve. If your back hurts, take a trip to the chiropractor.

However, finding the underlying cause is a much more difficult task. If your back hurts, it may be because of your low-quality mattress, your unhealthy posture at work, or your harmful workout habits.

If you can identify the cause, you can eliminate the pain without fear of long-term repercussions.

If you're feeling down, the answer may be in going for a jog or building a better relationship, certainly not in an addiction. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, the answer may be in clarifying your vision, taking strong action, drinking a large glass of water, maybe even sleeping--not reaching for another cup of coffee. If your team morale is suffering, the answer may be in understanding and clarifying your team member's needs, not offering them rewards or threatening them with punishment.

To get to the root requires attention, insight, and most of all, humility. It takes humility to admit that you made a mistake, mistreated your employee, neglected your family, or failed to make the forward progress you'd hoped for.

However, humility will give you the power to look beyond the surface, cut through to the deep underlying cause, and build a business that will outlast you.

More importantly, it will give you the power to build a life that will outlive yourself. Settle for nothing less than a life that will matter long after you've taken your last breath.

Here's to humility and to a life lived with our eyes wide open\!
