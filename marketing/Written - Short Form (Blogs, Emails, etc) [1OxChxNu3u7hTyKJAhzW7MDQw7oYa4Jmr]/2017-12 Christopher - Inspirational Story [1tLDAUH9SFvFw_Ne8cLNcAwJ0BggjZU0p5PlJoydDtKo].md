We often look at our problems as something to be fixed as soon as possible, resolved, and put behind us. What if we would take a different perspective and use our difficulties as an impetus for innovation?

In China, smog is a huge problem. People walk around with masks over their faces and check the smog index before leaving their homes. Smog harms lungs, aggravates asthma, even causes heart attacks. However, an innovative entrepreneur decided to take on the challenge of smog. After some research, he discovered that smog in China is largely composed of carbon particles, the same substance that under pressure becomes diamonds

He brainstormed a huge air purifier that would filter out the carbon and purify the surrounding air. The particles would then be compressed into small diamonds. 

The world’s largest portable air purifier became a reality- a 23 foot attractive metal structure that filters 30,000 cubic feet of air an hour, creating a clean air bubble for people to come and enjoy. It sits in a park, beautifying the landscape as it purifies the air. The tower is portable. It has travelled from the Netherlands to three different cities in China, and soon will go to India.

And the carbon filtered from the smoggy air? It’s compressed into diamonds, which are then sold to finance more air filters. 

What if the intractable problem you face actually holds your key to an innovative breakthrough?
