Have you ever experienced a business’s gravitational pull? It’s uncanny\!

You waltz in, unawares, and quickly find yourself sucked into their vortex--and happy about it\! It’s so delightful you find yourself *wanting* to dole out cash to them. Even when they're selling to you, it feels comfortable and right to be handing over your money. (And if they deliver on their promise, you’re grateful for every dollar you spent.)

But maybe you’ve experienced the opposite: a business with no gravitational pull whatsoever.

If you don't know what I mean, take a trek to your local laundromat, look for the community bulletin board and find that dog-eared business card for a handyman. The phone number is scribbled out and another number scratched above it. Any chance that handyman's getting a call from you when your wife texts you at work, complaining the faucet is leaking and she'd like it fixed yesterday?

Not a chance in the world\!

You're more likely to hang up whatever you're doing, drive home, and fix that confounded leak yourself before you have some fly-by-night creep working in your house.

That's not gravitational pull. That's anti-gravity. And it pushes customers away.

Most businesses are simply average--lying somewhere between those two extremes. Some of them are profitable, others aren't. Yet all of them (assuming they're a sound business) really could dramatically improve their bottom line by *creating* this gravitational pull.

In marketing, we call it "positioning".

While we can all recognize this gravitational pull, most of us find it much harder to define. Nevertheless, we can't deny its strong effect\!

When gravity it works against you, if feels like you have to...

* Beg others to work with you.  
* Oversell...try too hard to persuade others to do business with you.  
* Tolerate any ole customer who comes your way.

For some businesses, the transition is easy. If you're a handyman, it’s as simple as becoming known as the guy who always returns phone calls and shows up on time. For other businesses, the transition is more challenging.

If you're not actively working to shift the pull of gravity, you're fighting a losing battle. Once you've "got it," however, everything seems to get easier:

* You don't have to chase prospects. They want to work with you.  
* You don't have to fight at the feeding trough to bid the bottom dollar. People are willing to pay what you're worth.  
* You don't have to defend yourself, because people see the value you provide.

When you've got it, the tables turn and everything becomes dramatically easier.

Over the next few weeks, I’m going to talk more about what it takes to create a gravitational pull in business.

It comes down to two factors (just like physics): proximity and mass.

**Proximity** is all about being as close to your customers and as distant from your competitors as possible.

**Mass** is about who--regardless of size--can actually pack the biggest punch.

Master these two things and customers won’t be able to resist working with you.

And when customers find you irresistible, you’ll have found how to…

Be the best you\!
