Samantha (name changed) works for an insurance company that handles real estate transactions between sellers and buyers.  
   
Recently, she was working away at a thick stack of documents with a buyer at the closing table. Although the wife decided to stay in the lobby with their three children to minimize interruptions, the two energetic younger children kept running between the lobby and the closing room to say “Hello” to daddy. He finally closed the door, explaining that he needed to concentrate, and asked them to please stay in the lobby with mommy.

However, once the door was closed, they raced around the office, climbed under the receptionist’s desk, and jumped from the sofas to the coffee table all while Mom sat by making idle threats.

Just then, another closer who had also worked with the buyer throughout the process came in to say “Hello.” Assuming the children belonged to the seller she good naturedly joked as she left the room, “Don’t worry, the kids don’t come with the house.” 

After she realized they were the *buyer’s* kids (not the seller’s) and her feeble attempt to backpedal only multiplied the embarrassment, she learned the hard way that a straight apology is always best for great customer service.
