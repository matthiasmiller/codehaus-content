Do you ever find it difficult to keep the people under you engaged in their work? 

Many leaders, whether businessmen, pastors, or moms at home, struggle to help their followers take ownership of their responsibilities and stay deeply engaged in their work.

Many leaders focus on motivating their people to do certain tasks. They act like shepherds who steer their sheep to the right destination. 

This makes sense to most of us, because it sounds like real leadership. After all, doesn’t this create the desired outcomes? For many, it is the only kind of leadership they know.

However, this approach creates a nightmare for the leader. One stray sheep--one employee mistake--stalls the entire flock and delays progress. Worse yet, when sheep wander from the path, they cannot find their own way back home.

Instead of acting as sheep herders, great leaders act as gardeners. They focus on creating healthy habitats where plants grow naturally on their own.

Great leaders don’t herd. Great leaders nurture. As gardeners, they create healthy habitats, ecosystems where their followers can thrive. Just like a well-tended garden bears robust fruit, healthy ecosystems within a company grows people who deliver successful outcomes.

As a leader, you want those under you to thrive on their own. Great results come from employees who take ownership of their work without you micromanaging their job for them.

Be a gardener, not a shepherd. Focus on helping your employees thrive where they’re planted. This will encourage them to take ownership of their responsibilities, resulting in positive outcomes.

How have you nurtured healthy ecosystems for your followers? What were some of your successes? What were some of your failures?

In next week’s email, we’ll explore deeper what exactly separates a gardener from a shepherd.

Until then…

Be the best you\!

**Ecosystems (this could be a 2-part series)**  
Wealth and success is about creating ecosystems that are healthy and that thrive. This changes the definition of leadership.

The Shepherd

- Think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things  
- Requires you to drive things forward  
- Puts you in the hub of the wheel and everything circles around you  
- Herds sheep/moves people to get to a certain place  
- Focused on assigning tasks and getting them done

The Gardener

- Focuses leadership on creating a culture where things get done  
- Allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.  
- Focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own  
- Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results  
- What makes a healthy environment?  
* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself  
- When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a byproduct of that.

If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.

Most people think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things, which is only partially true. You can either focus your leadership on that, OR...you can focus your leadership on creating a culture where things get done.

One approach requires you to be driving things forward.

The other approach allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.

One approach puts you in the hub of the wheel, and everything circles around you.

….

Another example \-- the difference between herding sheep, or moving them to get to a certain place

vs. a gardener who is focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own.

….

Another question to go with this...what are the things that make the difference between a gardener and a “driver” (for lack of a better term)?

* Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results, vs. focused on assigning tasks and getting them done

  What makes a healthy environment?


* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself

  When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a by-product of that. If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.
