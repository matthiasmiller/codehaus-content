# **Ready, Fire, Aim**

## **The Unexpected Line of Fire of an Entrepreneur**

It's funny the clues you discover in childhood.

When I was five years old, I would frequently take a pen and paper and sketch out a design for a new invention. I specifically remember the day I sketched out a machine to automatically assemble sandwiches, excitedly showing it to my brothers and sisters.

If I'd only taken my machine to market, I could have started a chain of custom sandwich vending machines. Walk up, choose your toppings, swipe your card, and walk away with your lunch, just the way you want it.

I didn't invent it for any reason at all. It was just a fun idea for a little five-year-old.

As I grew older, I discovered I could express myself much better verbally than visually. Rather than sketching images, I would simply sit at my desk at home with a piece of paper in front of me, pen in hand, and try my best to articulate a new idea I had. I would write out the major ideas, fill in additional details, then draw connections from one idea to another.

While I didn't realize it at the time, these experiences pointed me to two core skills: developing a vision and creating the strategy to fulfill it.

## **Art Meets Science**

As I moved into middle school and high school, I discovered the world of math and logic. It was a tight, highly controllable world--one with predictable outcomes. Learn the rules of the system, and you can play within the system all you please.

Eventually, this led me to dive into software engineering, coaching, and digital marketing--three seemingly unrelated fields. However, they all share a common thread: *they force me to obsess about the laws of cause and effect*.

Over time, I began working to develop my personal vision. As an engineer, I knew exactly how to find a destination, then work backwards from there to find the steps required to achieve it. That's the essence of every piece of software--to take any kind of input and robotically produce the correct response.

I assumed that success demanded simple, robotic actions that would lead me to close in on my goals. Program yourself to do certain actions every day, and you would inevitably achieve results. And if it wasn't working, the best answer was just to redouble your efforts and work harder to close in on the target.

Grit your teeth and push harder.

I became frustrated at my incapacity to achieve the outcomes I was looking for, and I finally stopped and completely rewrote my mental software.

Rather than focused simply on the outcome I was trying to achieve, I took a step back and began to question the assumptions about what was working and what wasn't.

I stopped programming myself to be a robot, and I began programming myself as a next-generation "adaptive learner." I began rewriting my piece of software to continually evaluate what's working and what isn't. When things weren't working, I quit assuming it was merely circumstantial or merely a lack of effort.

## **The Obsessive Experimenter**

Over the past few years, my life has turned into a living experiment. I regularly try new ways of looking at the world, new ways of living my life. I tried different mindsets, different perspectives, different strategies, and even different tactics.

My goal is simple--to prove or disprove each of my hypotheses. If I find something that works, I do everything I can to understand exactly why it works. I try variations of it--not merely to find a better way, but as a way to isolate exactly *why* it works the way it does.

If you have a perfectly working system, unless you know exactly *why* it works, you'll never be able to fix it when it breaks or replicate it again.

However, experimentation cames at a cost.

Every once in a while, the level of uncertainty in my life spikes beyond my level of tolerance. Even though I have a high tolerance for uncertainty, when it rises too high I sometimes wonder if I'd be better settling into the *status quo* and fitting myself into the life that everyone else seems to be content living.

Sometimes, I'm haunted by this nagging thought that I'm giving up right before I hit success--as if somehow the formula for success is:

effort \* time \= success

If that formula is true, every single person sitting in a cubicle is facing imminent success every single day. We will see a surge of millionaires rising from the workforce. Every person hitting the gym for 4 hours every day, pushing their limits every single day, will inevitably become world-famous athletes.

I've come to doubt both effort and time as the *primary* drivers of success.

## **The Missing Formula for Success**

Even though effort and time are important clues to success, they are secondary to finding an approach that actually *works*.

I have to admit--my experimental approach to life has gotten me into trouble...a lot. Do you remember my fear of giving up on projects before I hit the finish line?

It's not entirely unfounded.

I had a difficult conversation with a former client earlier this week. To be honest, I'd been frustrated with myself that I hadn't achieved the outcome I expected. However, as I talked, I learned the problem was only in my perception and that several years later, he was still experiencing benefits from my work. Although it was a difficult (if somewhat vulnerable) conversation, it was well worth it for this single lesson:

\**Feedback always beats assumption.*

When you're experimenting, feedback is the most valuable thing in the world.

If you can reliably get early feedback that something may work, it will give you the confidence to move on.

If you can reliably get early feedback that what you're trying isn't working, it will give the choice of pivoting--either finding a new approach for your project, or abandoning the project entirely.

Lack of feedback may be the biggest time waster in the world.

Success does not merely require time and effort. It requires finding a healthy way to continually question yourself and your assumptions to find what will or will not work.

## **Fighting Through the Mental Blocks**

Before I close, I want to share a little confession.

The past few weeks, I've faced severe mental blocks with a number of projects I've been working on. I'm not talking about little moments of spacing out...I'm talking about literally being unable to *think* about the next step forward.

If you've ever experienced it, you know it's the most frustrating thing in the world. And it's not something that's merely solved by redoubling your time and effort. Sometimes the worst way to solve a problem is to obsess over it.

I'd experimented with little tweaks here and there, and I even tried pushing harder at times. Even though I reached out to my colleagues for feedback and support, I still wasn't asking the right question. Because I didn't know the question, I failed to ask for more help.

This afternoon I climbed into my car to drive to Starbucks to focus on this article. When I was pulling into my parking space, I had a spontaneous thought...a hypothesis about why I'd hit this roadblock. With it came a new boost of hope, because I finally had *something* with which to experiment.

## **Success Isn't a Straight Line**

"Success," they say, "is never in a straight line."

Perhaps the most important skill you can have is to be an adaptive learner. Not only is it difficult to learn from life's situations, it's difficult to learn the right lesson.

Life would have you believe that when circumstances don't work out, when your projects fail, when you don't see the outcomes you intend, that it's a problem with you, your level of commitment, or your effort.

However, I believe that hustle and grind have just as much (or maybe more\!) to do with a tenacious hunt for answers that work, than they do for a time and effort invested in a project.

Thomas Edison succeeded not merely because he spend hours working on the lightbulb. He succeeded because he experimented a thousand different ways, isolating different things that didn't work.

When you're on the path of experimentation, it's easy to distrust yourself or to distrust the process. However, you get to choose.

You can have the certainty of a destination that the rest of the world is following, or you can take the risk that you can set out to find a better world and a better way.

Keep it up, don't give up...because brighter days *are* ahead\!
