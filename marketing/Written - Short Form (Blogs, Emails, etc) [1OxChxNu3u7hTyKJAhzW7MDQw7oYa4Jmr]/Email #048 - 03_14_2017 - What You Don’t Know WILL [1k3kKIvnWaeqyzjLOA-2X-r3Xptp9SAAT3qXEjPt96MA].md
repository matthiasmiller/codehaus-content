The brand new Civic lurched back as Seth stomped on the gas and veered around the SUV in front of him.

“Slow down, Seth\! I’d rather be late than in a wreck.”

“You know the boss hates it when we’re late,” Seth shot back. And his coworkers continued bracing themselves against the seats as he weaved his way through the miserable L.A. traffic.

“By the way, Ryan,” Seth said adjusting the mirror to look at the 30-year-old. “Did you grab that folder the boss asked us to bring?”

“Yup\! Got it right her--watch out\!” Ryan screamed at the driver.

Hearing Ryan’s yell, Seth swerved hard left into the median but not before smacking the side of a large truck. The car crashed into the median barrier with a screech and explosion of airbags.

The pounding in Seth’s chest drowned out the sputtering of the wrecked Honda and the groaning of his startled passengers.

“What on earth were you doing?” Ryan demanded from the back. Seth’s knuckles turned white gripping the steering wheel.

“I’m sorry,” Seth replied. “I never saw him.”

“Check your blindspots\!” is one of the first rules we learn as new drivers. 

Yet, it doesn’t only apply to driving. It’s also one of the first rules in relationships, as well. No matter what relationship we’re talking about--business, friendship, romance--we all have blindspots.

“You might have them, but I don’t,” some of us could be tempted to say.

Which is exactly why they’re called *blind spots*. 

Like blind spots on the road, blind spots in a relationship can be devastating if we don’t check them constantly.

Blind spots in relationships are the habits you do, phrases you say, gestures you make that affect people without you knowing. For example, you may have a habit of interrupting people before they finish speaking a thought, the tone of voice you use under pressure, or the way you hold your breath when you’re anxious. This can have detrimental affects on your communication (and it could even destroy your relationships). Yet if no one tells you, you may never realize you do it. It’s a blind spot.

So what do we do about it?

Well, we can do a couple of things.

**First, we can invite feedback from others.** People who know us can help expose the areas of weakness we can’t see on our own. Just as Ryan exposed one of Seth’s blind spots and informed him of the presence of a truck, so our friends can expose the weaknesses we can’t see ourselves. Most times, we need to specifically ask for feedback.

**Second, we can share personal information about ourselves.** Sometimes, our friends can’t see our blind spots because we hide too much of ourselves from them. When we become more transparent and reveal more of what’s going on, we allow them a deeper perspective. While this can be uncomfortable, it often uncovers blind spots that would otherwise have gone undetected.

Blind spots are detrimental not only to our progress as leaders, but to the growth in our businesses as well. Do what it takes to constantly “check your blind spots” and you’ll always…

Be the best you\!

Feedback from others

**Other**  
Other blind spots can be so hidden, not even our friends can see them. This is an unknown area or, you could say, “Untapped Potential.” We can reduce these areas by sharing information about ourselves with a trusted mentor or friend. Giving others an inside look into our lives will expose any “new” blindspots and decrease our areas of “untapped potential.”
