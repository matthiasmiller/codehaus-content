We're halfway through the year, and summer's in full swing\! By the time this lands in your mailbox, we'll be back from our summer vacation, recharged and ready to take on the second half of the year\!  
Recently, I was thinking about my childhood summer memories--cooling off under the neighbor's center-pivot irrigation in rural Kansas, lugging five-gallon buckets for water fights, building rivers and dams in our shaded sandpile, and of course, fighting over who'd get the drumsticks from our charcoal-grilled chicken dinners.  
Those are fun memories. However, as I grow older, I realize how easy it is to let time slip away. Last fall, my wife and I realized our summer got away from us, so this year we've decided to be much more intentional about making memories.  
It doesn't mean taking more vacations. It means being more intentional about doing things as a family--going to the zoo with friends, having friends over more often, taking our kids to watch the parade.  
Don't forget to pack your summer to the brim...with long-lasting memories\!
