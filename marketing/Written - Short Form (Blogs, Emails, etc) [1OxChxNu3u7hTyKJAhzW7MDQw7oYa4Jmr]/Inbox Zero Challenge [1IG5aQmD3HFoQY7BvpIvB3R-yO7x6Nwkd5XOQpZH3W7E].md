# **The Inbox Zero Challenge**

For the past few years, I’ve obsessed over how to take back control over my time. I’m bombarded with requests for my time, focus, and attention.

And it’s not slowing down.

That’s why I declared war on one of my worst enemies: the constant barrage of emails.

Yes, we’ve made some big blunders along the way…

Had a few nail-biting moments..

Made a few apologies...

But we’ve finally beaten this thing into submission.

Net result?

When I asked my team to figure out how much time I spend on email every day, I realized that we found a way to **very conservatively give me an hour back** every single day.

Maybe even two.

(Confession: It’s why I’m writing this insert at the last minute with a completely clear head.)

In June we’re launching a 3-day **Inbox Zero Challenge** where we pull back the curtain…

Because I’ve found many leaders who are stressed and overwhelmed…

Too much to do and not nearly enough time to do it…

Things continually falling through the cracks…

Important things not getting done because others set the agenda…

Ready to break from the pack?
