**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

All of us face days--perhaps even months or years--where we must fight for hope.

I have a question for you:

How bad would your situation get before you completely gave up?

If you felt stuck, with no way out, how soon would you just give up and die?

Well, that’s exactly what Dr. Curt P. Richter wanted to find out through an experiment he did back in the fifties. 

His subject? Rats.

Richter did a series of experiments on testing how long rats would swim in jars full of water with no way of escape. He found that wild rats after realizing there’s no way out died within 15 minutes of being placed in the water.

Now, humans are much more complex than rats. But I think we've all had the feeling that we’re swimming in circles with no path of escape--and it’s tough to keep going.

However, Richter also found that if he removed the “hopelessness” of the situation, the rats survived much longer. He did this repeatedly by holding the rats and putting them back in, thus giving the rats hope that there was an escape.

Richter noted that “after the elimination of hopelessness, the rats do not die.” In fact, many of them could swim for days\!

I posit my question to you again: What level of “hopelessness” can you withstand?

What level of failure would it take to derail you?

You see, hope was the only difference between the rats that died and the rats that survived and swam for days. Though they possessed the same strength and vitality, the rats without hope quickly gave up and died.

In life, we don’t always get to feel those “hands of hope” pulling us out of the water, letting us know that everything will be okay if we just keep swimming. But that doesn’t mean they’re not there.

If you feel yourself swimming in circles, waiting for that hand to lift you out of the water, keep swimming\! Don’t give up hope\! Help is coming\!

And always...

Be the best you\!

P.S. I’m serious about these questions. What does it take for you to begin losing hope? What have been the “hands of hope” in your life? Shoot me a reply, I’d love to hear your story\!

Maybe a practical post of how to hang onto hope in the middle of challenging situations?

How level of failure does it take to derail you? Because even successful people have faced bankruptcy...a financial crisis that would be evidence to most people that they’re on a deadend road. Although some encountered it multiple times, it was also sometimes the last thing that happened to them before they started their upward climb.
