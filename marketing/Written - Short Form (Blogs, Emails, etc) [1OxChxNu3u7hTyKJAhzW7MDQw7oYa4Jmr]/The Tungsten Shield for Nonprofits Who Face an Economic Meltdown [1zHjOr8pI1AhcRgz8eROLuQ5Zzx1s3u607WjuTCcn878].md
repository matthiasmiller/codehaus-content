# **The Tungsten Shield for Nonprofits Who Face an Economic Meltdown**

This entire week, I've been thinking about you.

Our team already had a new edition of the leadership journal queued up, and I told them, "We need to set that one aside and write one especially for these people."

And this edition is exactly that. A little different than usual. Me sharing my heart with you all.

## **Your Head Space Is Your Most Valuable Real Estate**

Two weeks ago, just as people were starting to reach out for help, I ducked out of the office for a week-long sabbatical. Great timing, eh?

I'll admit--it was one of the most challenging times away from the office that I've taken. However, it reminded me of a few important lessons, especially in times of crisis.

First, family really does matter. It's easy to say that we care for our loved ones, but love is often spelled with T-I-M-E and S-A-C-R-I-F-I-C-E. When we intentionally step away from our responsibilities to focus on the ones closest to us, it not only helps reinforce to THEM that we care about them, but it also reinforces to US what is most important to us.

Second, you really do need to put on your oxygen mask before helping other people. It's true that self-care is gaining an increasing narrative in our culture. However, self-care is more than just an event. It's living a healthy lifestyle where we take in so we can pour out.

Third, and maybe most importantly, rest is the weapon of an intentional leader. Listen, I understand there are times when situations demand long hours and extreme efforts. However, those should only be SITUATIONS. Those should not be long-term. If you continue to deprive yourself of sleep, it's a clue that you might be using a short stick to lift a large rock. Look for higher leveraged ways to achieve what you're trying to accomplish. Furthermore, rest is the building block that leads us into the final lesson.

Fourth, you must take ownership of your mental real estate. The most valuable real estate in the world is in your heart and your head. After my recent trips to the local grocery store, I came home feeling dirty and grimy--not from the fear of the virus, but from the anxiety and fear that I felt around me.

If there's ever a time to take MEASURED input of the news, it's now. For me? Even during these times, I'm keeping it to the VERY minimum of news consumption. It’s just not helpful for me.

Rest is a powerful weapon for resetting our hearts and minds. It allows you to lead from a place of power and intentionality.

And I'm certainly NOT expecting you to agree with me on this. However, if you don't, I am asking you to consider:

Would you rather be a leader who makes a few, critical, powerful, clear-headed decisions, or one who makes hundreds or thousands of mediocre ones?

But there's something else that I realized.

## **We Get to Be Strong and Weak During This Time**

I want to be clear.

As much as I fight for clarity of thought and peace in the middle of this craziness, I'm not perfect.

For example, last night was a rough night with one of our kids.

Such a little thing in light of everything that's going on in this world. But it's real to me this morning.

What about you?

Do you have a pebble in your shoe that you're ignoring? More importantly, do you have people around you to CARE about the challenges that you're facing?

We're in a time when other people are looking to US to keep our cool, to keep calm, to make clear-headed decisions. If you've walked into a grocery store in the past few weeks, you know just how DESPERATELY people need practical and emotional leadership.

There are times you get to be strong.

But there are also times you need to take your mask off. Wear your heart on your sleeve. Be yourself, with all of the challenges, fatigue, questions, and doubt that you may be facing.

Remember what I said about this being a little different than usual?

I've got this CONVICTION that many of you reading this need to be reminded of this:

That you've got this.

You're going to make it.

Your effort is being SEEN and VALUED.

You matter.

Yes, we'll talk about some practical implications for this in a moment. But we dare not forget about you.

You've got broad shoulders. You're probably carrying MORE than your fair share during this time.

In the midst of the panic, the challenge, and the demands, it's easy to shut off your heart to the people around you.

It's easy to shut off your heart to yourself.

Don't do it.

You were born for this. You're leading for a reason. You've got this.

But there's one more thing.

## **Letting Go of What "Should Be"**

We were getting ready to launch our first live events in May. Not happening anymore. We're doing a few other things instead (which you can see in the included insert).

I want to be absolutely clear: the world is shifting.

Not only that, the world has ALREADY shifted.

In a recent focus group with millennials, one of them observed, "The organizations that worked with us and worked through our feedback are growing. The ones that aren't are declining."

This shift is bigger than just COVID-19, and it's very possible that this is the final nail in the coffin for organizations who refuse to change or adapt.

If you want to lead effectively, you must not only lead with a clear, open mind and with a free, open heart. You must lead with a surrendered, open WILL.

I appreciate organizations who develop long-term plans. However, those plans MUST adapt to fit the times. We are living in an age of reduced friction and increased acceleration.

Just imagine how long this virus would have taken to reach the United States if it had happened one thousand years ago? Instead, it's spread across the globe in a matter of weeks and months.

One of my mentors pointed out that we are living in a time of some opportunities suddenly opening and other opportunities suddenly closing. Almost overnight. I completely agree.

And this is why you must live with a surrendered will.

If you are determined to achieve your mission in the way that you've always done it, you may continue to survive for a period of time. However, you're risking your entire organization by refusing to adapt to the sudden changes that are coming to you in this next decade.

They might not be global pandemics. They might be election upsets in your region. Even MORE changes in tax laws. Board members suddenly resigning.

I don't know exactly WHAT it will be. Hopefully, it will NOT be global. But it might. And it will likely come where you least expect it.

So what are the shifts that already have happened?

## **Fuel on the Virtual Fire**

I'm present in different online communities, and one of the trends that I'm seeing is that the OLDER DEMOGRAPHIC is reluctantly getting online. They're doing live videos on social media for the first time. They're joining video conferences for the first time. They're signing up for virtual events for the first time.

Nonprofits are ALREADY pivoting to virtual events, and some of them with booming success and high participation. I just interviewed the owner of an agency who specializes in virtual summits, and there's a lot of opportunity in that space right now.

And yes, part of this surge is a momentary bubble because of everyone being at home and finally having discretionary time to consume content. It's hard to predict exactly what this will look like a year from now.

Yes, it might cool down, but it will almost certainly NOT go back to where it was.

When people return to work, they'll discover that they've already broken down a significant barrier to remote work. Employees will be more likely to request that opportunity, and employers will be more likely to provide that.

Certain organizations will have expanded their supporter base, now only practically reachable through digital means. Even if they continue doing in-person events, some of them will already have made the leap to the digital space.

Not because they wanted to.

Because the world shifted, and they HAD to.

It's shifting the fundraising world. We're already seeing a major upshot of fundraising consultants who are focusing on helping organizations go virtual.

You'll see organizations running towards virtual fundraising, events, teams, and even programming. Some of them will experience incredible success, and others will fail to make it work. Once the path has been proven, many organizations will likely move this direction because it seems easy, simple, lightweight, and low overhead. I expect you'll see this increase dramatically.

However, if you wait 5-10 years, you may find the market flooded with virtual fundraisers and events. It will create a new opportunity for what has always worked \-- creating live, in-person experiences to support your organization.

The exact same thing happened to direct mail (you know, things like this that get printed on paper). It got left by the wayside for email letters and social media. Yet it still works. If anything, it's MORE effective because people are receiving significantly LESS mail.

(It's why you should do a print newsletter, by the way.)

Just like direct mail, I expect the same thing to happen with events. It will create this space for organizations to create unique, high value experiences that stand out.

Just like direct mail, I expect small, long-standing organizations to continue with the conventional approach. The digital campaigns and communications will move from MEGA organizations to LARGE organizations to MEDIUM organizations. Most likely, we'll start to see an upshot of startup nonprofits who are digital-first--and not just by stumbling across them in the news or online. We'll likely see them in our own backyard.

Let's get one thing clear.

I can't guarantee you that the SPECIFICS of these predictions are true, but they're VERY credible. And most importantly, I make them to emphasize that the world has ALREADY shifted, and things will NOT return to normal.

And while the shift towards the virtual world is most clear, there's another shift that's underway.

## **The Rise of Social Entrepreneurship**

As the friction decreases with the rise of the virtual events and fundraising, the world will increasingly shift towards larger nonprofits continuing to grow, while smaller nonprofits continue to shrink.

In addition, I personally believe we've already started to see a shift in what donors are looking for when they contribute to an organization. They are expecting to receive more value than ever before.

I believe this is actively creating a space in the market for social entrepreneurship, and the organizations that figure this out will be at a significant advantage ten years from now.

Yesterday, I consulted with the founder and director of a non-profit that is focusing PRIMARILY on virtual training. For the organizations that are willing to make this change, this will be a HUGE leap forward for them.

Again, some organizations will make this shift. Others won't.

It will create space for startup organizations who are willing to do the hard work of innovation.

Again, it's not clear to me how quickly this will happen, but it's very POSSIBLE that some organizations will choose to pivot towards this model during this time because it can create a much higher level of sustainability and resilience in the market that we're in.

(There are a LOT of ways that your organization may be able to pivot towards this, but we don't have room in this newsletter for this.)

There's one more factor that's critical for non-profits to consider during this time.

## **The World OUTSIDE Has Shifted**

Businesses that were bustling a few weeks ago are listening to the sound of crickets. Some of them will bounce back immediately, some will close their doors permanently, others will weather the storm, and a few will have the most dramatic surge of growth in their history.

For many businesses, what was true about them a few months ago is NO LONGER TRUE of them today.

If you pay special attention, it creates opportunities for new partnerships that will help sustain you during this time. However, as I mentioned, it's quite possible that it will close (or pause) other partnerships that you've developed.

However, it doesn't just apply to business.

It affects your clients. For some, it may only affect them in the short-term. For others, the challenges they face take on significantly new dynamics, even in the long-term. You may find other organizations rise up to help meet those needs, while other organizations close down.

It affects your donors. Again, it may have a short-term impact. However, it may also have a long-term impact on the things that they see as important. Some may be able to contribute more than before. Others may need to scale back their giving.

## **What Does This Mean For You?**

If I could have one gift, it would be to sit across the table from you and hear your perspective and your experience. Different regions, different people, and different organizations will all be affected at different speeds and different times. However, we can expect certain patterns to emerge.

I would also love to help you find the specific path forward through the challenges you're facing. I'm doing that the best that I can through the pages of this leadership journal, and for now, that will have to do.

If you want more support, I’ve included a special insert to help you move forward. I urge you to read it.

I want to leave you with this encouragement.

As you navigate these challenging times, continue leading with your eyes wide open. Live with an open mind, open heart, and open will. Lead with courage.

Let’s continue to support each other as we navigate into the future that’s emerging now.
