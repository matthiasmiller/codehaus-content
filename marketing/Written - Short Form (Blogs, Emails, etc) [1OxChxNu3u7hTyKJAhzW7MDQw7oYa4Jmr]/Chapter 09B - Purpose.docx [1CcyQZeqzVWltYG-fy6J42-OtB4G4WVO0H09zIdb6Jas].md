## **The Purpose Exercise**

Clarifying your purpose means digging into who you are as a person, finding the things that matter to you, and defining and clarifying them. It's partially an intuitive process, and partially a hunt through your past, looking for the things that are significant to you.

Think of it like this: if you could summarize the focus of your whole life into a single action phrase, what would it be? Being able to condense your whole life and your whole focus into a single phrase gives you incredible clarity as you move through life.

Let's start the process now. What are the actions that inspire you the most? Remember to choose words that can be applied in various situations, that aren't strictly related to the specifics of how it's accomplished. (We'll cover that later.)

Take some time to journal. If there were one specific focus that you wanted your entire life to have, what would it be?

Don't skip this step, even though you're anxious to keep reading. If you haven't done it yet, go back and do it.

Think back over your life and think about the things that you've experienced. Some of those experiences resonated with you, and they practically shouted out, "Yes\! This is what I was born for\!"

Take a few minutes to think about some of those situations, and write them out:

These are simply clues into what it means to live your purpose. Your next challenge is simply to combine these thoughts into a statement that describes your purpose. What is it that, uniquely to you, gives you meaning in what you do?

Here are some examples:

* To empower people to use their abilities to live their lives with excellence

* To challenge the status quo and introduce people to new ways of thinking and living

* To develop a culture of freedom in every environment I am

* To develop young leaders in every sphere of society

What is it for you? It doesn't have to be perfect. My first one was only sixteen words long, and I've since take the time to expand it and grow. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it does need to be something that resonates with the "why" of your heart:

## **Living by Your Purpose**

Everything that you do is meaningless without the answer of a greater question, "Why does this matter?" And that answer is impersonal if it isn't asked as, "Why does this matter to me?"

But if you live your life with a purpose, if you know the "why" behind everything that you do, the challenges that you face and the seeming distractions that you face will carry an answer. It will either bring you closer to you "why", or it will be able to bring a "why" into your situation.

If your purpose is to develop young leaders, it doesn't matter whether you're teaching elementary school, taking care of young children, working at a fast food restaurant, or in a meeting in a board room. You have the opportunity to leverage your role to develop leaders all around you.

Of course, developing a leader who is 5 years of age looks a lot different than someone who's 18 years old, or someone who's 35 years. But each of those stages of life are critical for the development of a leader, and no matter where you find yourself, you have the opportunity to move towards that.

## **When you've Lost Your Purpose**

It seems our society today loves to joke about Mondays, only sometimes I know people are more than serious. I love getting off on work on Friday afternoon, but I also can't wait to get back Monday morning. Some mornings I can barely pry my eyes open, but I can't wait for my feet to hit the floor.

But this isn't true for everyone, and it hasn't always been true for me.

Some days, I dreaded going to work. I had to force myself to get out of bed and to get moving. Once I got to work, I would make myself a cup of coffee, check my work e-mail, and respond to as many questions as I could, and then meet with my manager--all before doing any significant work.

The trouble was, the only reason I'd found for doing this work was something that didn't resonate with myself. I didn't have any compelling reason for myself why I should get up in the morning and go to the office and work.

Maybe that's you right now. You're going through life, going through the motions, trying to keep motivated to move forward.

The problem is usually not the specifics of what you're doing, as long as you have a reason why you're doing it and you have a plan to move to something better. Knowing why you do what you do is living with purpose, and having a plan to align yourself better with that is living on purpose.

Most people do not lose their purpose. They lose their patience. They find a big vision, embrace it, and begin the process with vigor. But it's only a matter of time before their vision dies. The problem, of course, it not truly that their vision died, but that they forgot the reason they were doing.

They became impatient. They didn't have the discipline to keep reminding themselves of why they were doing the things they were doing.

Living life with purpose means being intentional, especially in projects that take a long time to accomplish, to bring yourself back to the "why" of what you do. Sometimes, this might mean doing it weekly, or even daily. But sometimes, especially in difficult seasons, it might mean reminding yourself ever hour, or every few minutes, the reason why you're pushing through the difficulty to get to the other side.

## **Serving Someone Else's Purpose**

We are often told how important it is to seek your own purpose and do your own thing. However, we are rarely reminded of the importance of learning to serve someone else's purpose.

Your life is a process of development and maturity. Some people were born with an innate desire to push beyond the barriers others have imposed around you and to develop a life of their own. They are the ones who break the rules about how things have always been done and discover new ways to do things.

Many of these people take on a journey of their own, never fully learning how to follow a leader besides themselves. Although this propels them into action and into the future they create, it never forces them to develop the healthy interdependence of a team. They've never discovered how to navigate within the scope of someone else's boundaries, and how to live fully free as you learn to serve someone else's purpose.

Breaking the attitude of entitlement is critical in the path of pursuing your purpose. Without it, you will destroy everything that comes in your path, and you will destroy the people who withstand you. It doesn't mean that you don't relentlessly pursue your purpose, but it means that you're able to see possibility in differences.

If you find yourself serving someone else's purpose, don't get trapped in either of these traps. Don't believe that you must stay forever to learn every lesson you must learn, but also don't believe that you must leave immediately if you will be able to embrace your own purpose.

## **Congruence and Community**

If you are a leader of any organization or business, your leadership will always be the most congruent when your personal purpose aligns with the purpose of the organization. Your leadership will, by very nature, carry your DNA, and you will best be able to cast vision when it's aligned with who you are as a person.

If values are the things that pull groups of people together, purpose is the thing that points people in the same direction.

Unless you have congruence, you will always have the danger of undermining the true purpose. For example, you might have a personal purpose of developing leader. If you are a manager in a company that manufactures furniture, you can use your role to develop the people around you as leaders. However, while developing leaders is critical to the financial success of your business, the business may not see it as important to their purpose.

Your challenge, then, is to find ways to connect your personal purpose with the purpose of the organization you're serving, without undermining the purpose of the organization.

Of course, it might also mean that, at some time, you may look for other ways to better align with your purpose. If you own the business, you can establish your personal DNA through the organization. And while the business does manufacture goods, it is simply a part of the bigger game of life that you're engaged in.

## **Purpose in Leadership**

As a leader, you need to develop the ability to connect your people to their "why" and remind them of that connection. That's the essence of motivation: to give them a reason to act.

If those following can fully embrace the "why" of what you're doing, they will naturally resonate with you. These are the individuals who will be most fully connected to the purpose you hold.

However, other individuals will not be as deeply connected. They themselves are leaders, and they are in your organization for a bigger reason. They have their own big "why" that they are answering, and you are only a part in that. The challenge, then, is being able to continue providing them room to develop their "why" within your organization, and as soon as you fail to do that, you've given them reason to move on.

These individuals are always significant contributors, and if they weren't, you could simply move them along without any further thought. Many of them do want to be engaged in your organization as long as you can provide them the opportunities they seek. As a leader, if you can find ways to connect to their purpose without compromising integrity with your purpose, you create long term engagement.

The challenge is, and always will be, "Can you create an organization where these individuals will refuse to leave because they know you're creating the best opportunity they can imagine?"

These individuals have a "loyalty" switch that's buried deep within them, and as long as that switch is flipped to "on", they will give you everything that they've got. But if that switch flips to "off", they will be searching for new opportunities. Your job as a leader is to monitor their loyalty, and see if you can derive mutual benefit by providing the things they are looking for and need.

## **A Life Transformed By Purpose**

How would your life be different if you lived every single day on purpose?

Imagine waking up in the morning, and your feet hitting the floor, and you could not wait to see what the day would hold. You know that today is another day of you answering you "why". You are responding to the question that most people wait to ask until they die. You are answering the question, "Why was I born?"

Imagine every single day being an answer to that question, and when you go to bed at night, you would be able to say, "That\! That is the reason I was born\!"

Imagine having a reason to which you tie your every move, your ever decision. Imagine having an anchor that, if it won't pull you into action, it will push you into action.

That's the power of a life transformed by purpose. Yes, finding it is a journey and a process, but it's one that's well worth it if you're willing to pay the price.

That journey for you must start today\!
