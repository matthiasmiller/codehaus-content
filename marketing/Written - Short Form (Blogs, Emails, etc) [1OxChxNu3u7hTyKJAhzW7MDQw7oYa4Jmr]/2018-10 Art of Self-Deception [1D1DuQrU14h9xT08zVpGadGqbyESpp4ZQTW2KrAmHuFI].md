# **The Art of Self-Deception**

## ***Three Keys to Avoid Being Blind to Reality***

Nobody likes having the wool pulled over their eyes. In any kind of deception (and especially in business), the feeling of betrayal runs deep.

Yet what happens when we are the ones pulling the wool over our own eyes?

It’s tough to talk about. It’s much easier to discuss profitability, customer satisfaction, employee retention, or productivity. However, talking about self-deception is just as important--perhaps even more important.

Self-deception is a deadly disease, and it’s one that people don’t talk about often enough.

We all have worked with people in the grip of self-deception. It's easy to name numerous failing businesses that persist despite the cold reality that they are mere months, maybe even weeks, from closing their doors.

We've all worked with someone who was so certain of themselves they refused to take any feedback. They persisted until they slammed their head against the wall...and when the blood was running down their face, they still persisted\!

We've all talked with someone who refused to deal with the deeper issues. Every conversation centered around a surface issue. No matter the conversation you have with them, your gut has this unshakable sense that the truth has been deeply buried. Not only did they bury the truth; they threw the map of its location into a burning inferno and obliterated it from their memory.

We’ve all worked with someone who managed to say the right words, time and time again, dodging the real issue, yet without taking any action or making any visible change.

That's the art of self-deception.

We’ve seen it happen with companies, friends, employees, bosses, and leaders. It’s everywhere, and it's a debilitating disease. Worse yet, it's *never* visible to the person who has it.

This means that if you think you’re immune to it, you might actually be suffering from it.

It's the awkward moment when the executive walks into the boardroom wearing a white shirt with an ugly mustard stain from the juicy burger he had for lunch. Everyone else can see it, but he's oblivious.

The trouble is, what happens when *you're* the one with mustard on your shirt?

And what if it’s worse than just a mustard stain?

That's self-deception. The worst part of deception is that you've got no idea that you've been deceived.

Fortunately, there *is* an answer. It just demands humility to embrace it.

### **Key \#1: Embrace the Cold, Hard Reality**

As much as people try to run from reality, nothing is quite as refreshing as the facts. They speak for themselves.

Last month, I participated in a business building challenge, meticulously measuring my level of activity throughout the entire month. At the end of the month, as I looked back over the numbers, I realized they weren't anywhere *close* to as high as I had thought.

Cold, hard reality check.

And a big lesson for me.

We all have little stories we tell ourselves in our minds, telling ourselves how hard we work, how much we do, how happy the world must be with what we're producing.

As entrepreneurs, we are a driven breed, pushing the envelope, going where no man has gone before. Convinced in our minds of the possibility of the future, we LIVE in the hope of a brighter future. We don't take failure personally. Instead, we persevere through incredible difficulty to get to the place we know we need to be.

Those stories that we tell ourselves are convincing. Believable, even.

In fact, they're *exactly* what we *want* to hear. However, they're not always what we *need* to hear.

We all can get stuck in the echo chamber of our own minds, convincing ourselves that everything's fine when it's all really falling apart.

And in those moments of our self-deceived stupor, it's an invitation into an ice bath of cold, hard facts.

Yes, I do mean having an active pulse on critical business metrics such as profitability, revenue, the number of leads, close rate, and employee productivity. However, I believe it needs to go deeper than just that.

Money is a reward for helping people, which means profitability simply explains how well you've done that. More than anything else, it demonstrates the health of your business.

However, profitability does not directly point to a solution for a failing business. With a number of notable exceptions, many profitability goals actually work against themselves. Even well-intended efforts at growing revenue can become self-defeating. Sometimes they invite a short-term fix at a long-term cost.

A slouch in employee productivity doesn't mean cracking the whip and lengthening hours if the processes themselves are broken. Increasing profitability does not mean cutting costs if customers are dissatisfied because of a rude employee.

In addition to measuring these numbers, you should also determine the core, driving numbers for your business. These are numbers such as:

* What's the level of trust we established with our prospects?  
* How many delighted customers did we serve?  
* How many times did we make improvements based on our employees' input?  
* What was our level of transparency and vulnerability within the organization?  
* How much of our effort was spent on things that meaningfully moved things forward?

The closer you can get to the heart of the issue...to the numbers that really move your organization forward...the better you can keep yourself in check with reality.

## **Key \#2: Invite Feedback**

Beyond just facing the cold, hard facts, teachability is the second great key to avoiding self-deception.

While I don't have the time to explain it thoroughly, the Johari principle provides some of the best explanations for blind spots, untapped potential, and the importance of transparency and candid feedback within a team.

How many times in the past week have you told someone, "I was wrong\!" Your ability to admit your mistakes and take ownership of them is directly correlated to your ability to avoid self-deception.

How many times have you asked someone, "What do you see that I need to change?" And then, rather than dismissing it as "someone else's opinion," you took it seriously and actually *changed* the issue they confronted?

Take it one step further and ask the people around you, "Do you feel like I admit my mistakes, invite feedback, and make changes in response to others?"

Then sit back, bite your tongue, and listen to their answer.

*Warning: if you're not teachable, you’ll immediately react and try to defend yourself. Don’t kill the messenger\!*

Listening well is one of the most unselfish things you can do.

It requires you to slow down time, let go of your own agenda and be fully present in the moment. If you’re an A-Type entrepreneur who spends most of the day racing from one thing to the next, I’ll place a pretty good bet that you’ve got disgruntled team members who feel like they’re not being heard. You’ve got to slow yourself down so that you can communicate, fix the problem, and pick up momentum.

Most importantly, as you listen, stop trying to formulate your response. Don’t prepare your defense. Don’t figure out how to respond. Don’t even come up with great stories from your past where you’ve felt the same way.

Get curious. Don’t be judgmental of their responses. Ask questions. Repeat back what they said, and ask if you understood correctly.

Once you’ve done that, you’re ready to take the next step to breaking free from self-deception.

## **Key \#3: Take Action**

As a hyper-curious entrepreneur, I've dived down rabbit holes that have distracted me from achieving the things that are most important. I've sat through hours of webinars, read stacks of books, and talked with dozens of people. Don't get me wrong--those have helped me tremendously.

However, I've noticed a little trap.

No, a huge trap\!

While I have little tolerance for uninformed action, I have to admit that learning itself can become an addiction. When we read a new concept or idea, it’s easy to feel like we’ve accomplished something when we haven’t actually done anything at all.

Yes, as I write this article, I’m well aware that some of you will get up and walk away without implementing any of it. You might even tell yourself, "I got great insight into my leadership." However, nothing will change.

It's like a little vaccine that immunizes you against the poison.

Chances are, you've got mail sitting by your desk. Your phone is likely buzzing with a text. Your inbox is exploding.

You've got many things that are demanding your attention.

The choice is yours: will you walk away, assuring yourself that this doesn't apply to you, or will you deliberately confront yourself?

It doesn't have to be complicated. It simply demands action. Would you let me help you?

Recently I wrote a booklet to help leaders and business owners learn how they can hand off important tasks to others. The purpose? To free up precious time that should be invested in something else. 

Before you request your complimentary copy, let’s make sure it’s worth your time. Ask yourself the following questions. 

- Do I have regular tasks that are consuming my precious time?  
- Would my life be more fulfilling if I could free up 5 minutes of my day for the rest of the year?  
- Am I looking for ways to scale and grow my business?

If you answered “yes” the any of the questions, message me to request your free copy of the booklet Risk Free Delegation. I’ll gladly send you a pdf or print copy\!
