**TARGET: 175**

Do you ever feel like your success is a fluke? Maybe if people really knew you, they wouldn't be so impressed?

You're not alone.

Last month, I picked up a book I'd bought months before and I hit something that stopped me in my tracks. The author shared the F.O.R.M. acronym for developing rapport: people love to talk about their Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Motivation.

While hardly original, this simple concept gave me a burst of hope. You see, I've had more than my share of awkward attempts at small talk. Yes, even at writing a personable letter for my newsletter.

Every entrepreneur has places they feel grossly incompetent. It may be poor social skills, disorganization, difficulty with numbers, a string of failures, or dyslexia.

Yet those same entrepreneurs appear strikingly brilliant with the right people and tools to succeed.

I want every edition of this newsletter to give you the same thing I experienced: a burst of hope that, despite your quirks and limitations, you do have the brilliance to make your mark on the world.

Happy reading\!
