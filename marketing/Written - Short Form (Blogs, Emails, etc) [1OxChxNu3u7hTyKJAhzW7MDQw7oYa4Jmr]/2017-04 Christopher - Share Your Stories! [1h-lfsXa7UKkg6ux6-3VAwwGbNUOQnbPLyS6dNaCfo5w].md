**Target: 150**

With every issue of *The Multiplier*, we are committed to bringing uplifting and insightful content. Not only do we want to provide insights to unlock business growth, but we want to saturate the publication with positive encouragement as well.

That’s why we’ve included the inspirational and humorous columns. In the past, we’ve shared everything from an inspiring story of middle-school kids sharing lunches with their peers, to *Best Buy* employees encouraging a young customer who couldn’t afford a game console, to self-storage managers driving around with a calf mount in his golf cart.

Now, we’d like to hear from you\! What are your stories? 

Whether from a professional or personal perspective, we’d love to hear and share the stories that remind you there’s still good in the world. If you have a story that keeps your friends rolling in laughter or gives you the encouragement to move on, we’d love to hear it\!

If you’re interested, email any stories to stories@multiplyyourstrengths.com with “The Multiplier Stories” in the subject. (Make sure to let us know if you’d prefer it anonymized.)

Thank you\!
