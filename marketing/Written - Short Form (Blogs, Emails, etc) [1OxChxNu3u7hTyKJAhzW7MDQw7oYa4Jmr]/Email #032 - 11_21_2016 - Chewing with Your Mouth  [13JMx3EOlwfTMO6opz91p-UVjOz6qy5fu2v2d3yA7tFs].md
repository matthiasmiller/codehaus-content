Have you ever noticed how some people seem incapable of seeing their own flaws? They continually do things that hurt the people around them. It’s like they never stop to think how their actions affect others.

Take, for example, people who chew with their mouth open.

I hate listening to this. 

Whatever that slurping and chomping noise coming from your mouth is, please make it stop\!

These people have eaten food every day for their entire life yet they still insist on chewing with their mouths open\!

Of course, this could be for several reason:

1. Perhaps they don’t realize it’s impolite and gross. Perhaps their parents never bothered to explain it to them or just didn’t care.  
1. Perhaps they simply don’t know they do it. No one ever told them and they haven’t checked.  
2. Or maybe, they just can’t help it. Some people can’t help but chew with their mouths open simply because of they way their mouths are shaped.

What does this have to do with business?

We all have negative traits that go beyond common place irritations (like chewing with your mouth open). We have habits and behaviors not altogether healthy. Sometimes we can see them on our own, but many times we can’t and we need others to help us.

We call these “blind spots.”

Some people (like me) get so excited about a vision they tend to forget about the details involved in actually pursuing that vision. It is especially bad when we run over people who are more detail oriented. The flip side is that detailed people can sometimes squelch the big ideas of visionaries.

Neither one is intrinsically bad. In fact, they are both good and necessary to balance each other out on a team. If the visionary isn’t able to see, on his own, how he runs over people, he needs others in his life who will show him.

This is how we grow, learn, and excel. And it’s one reason why it is so important to work and live in community. We need other people in our lives to help us grow past our blind spots.

Here’s a challenge to move you past your blind spots:

Take a close friend, coworker, or a family member out for coffee. Ask them to say one thing they appreciate about you (to soften the blow) and one thing that irritates them about you. 

You might be surprised by both answers\!

In any case, you’ll learn and grow and be able to...

Be the best you\!
