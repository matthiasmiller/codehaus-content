# **Introduction**

## The Story Behind this Booklet

When I first came across Richard Koch’s article on the Gravity of Competition, I knew it was an idea that I wanted to take ownership of. I spent the next months (over a year, actually) thinking about this idea and ways I could apply it to myself.

In his article (which you can access at multiplier.link/koch-gravity), Richard argues against the common conception that the goal of business is to maintain a lead over your competitors. A lead implies connection, that you are tied to your competitors. Instead, your goal is to create distance. If you can separate yourself from the competition’s gravitational pull, you can create your own race where you are position to win.

I may have appreciated this article more because of a certain quirk. I grew up as the youngest child of a large family, and my older siblings would often talk me into playing competitive games with them. I lost countless Checkers games to my brother as a child.

I can’t tell whether it’s my personality, a character flaw, or simply the fact that I lost so many games as a child. Regardless, I found that I hated to play games without a clear certainty that I was going to win.

While I hardly consider this attitude great sportsmanship, it’s been a very supportive attitude in business. Many entrepreneurs, drawn by the thrill of the chase and their love for competition, have found themselves dragged into an intensely difficult battle as their competitors drag them through the mud to create a profit-sucking business.

## How to Read the Book

I have taken his concepts and expanded them in this booklet. I encourage you to take the time to read through it, and spent time in a quiet place reflecting on how you might apply this to your business and your ventures.

Keep a notepad or journal beside you and take notes. Be sure to take action.

We’ve also developed the Gravity of Competition Scorecard, which is available to you for free online at [www.gravityofcompetition.com](http://www.gravityofcompetition.com). 

You can take this scorecard at any time.

This scorecard will help you determine not only how you stack up against the competition, but it will also uncover ways that you can leverage your uniqueness against your competition. It will also show you opportunities to further differentiate yourself from your competitors.

As you read this booklet, allow yourself to sit back and to think and reflect on our business. Thinking strategically is one of the most difficult, yet rewarding things you can do to grow your business.

Use this booklet as a fuel for your reflection. May you reap its rich rewards.

# **Unleashing the Power of Gravity in Your Business**

Some businesses have an almost uncanny gravitational pull. If you've experienced it, you know exactly what I mean.

While it may be rare, the experience is unforgettable. When you approach the business, you find yourself happily sucked into their vortex. Somehow, the experience is so delightful you find yourself *wanting* to do business with them. Even when they're selling to you, it feels so comfortable and right that you're excited about handing over your money. And when they deliver, you are grateful for every dollar you spent. No buyer's remorse.

(By the way, if you happen to think anyone's crazy to be excited about doling out cold, hard cash, you're doing yourself and your customers a disservice. You're selling yourself short. Way short.)

You might also have experienced businesses without that gravitational pull.

If you don't know what I mean, take a trek to the local laundromat, look for the community bulletin board and find that dog-eared business card for a handyman. The phone number is scribbled out and another number scratched above it. Any chance that handyman's getting a call from you when your wife texts you at work, complaining that the faucet is leaking and she'd like it fixed yesterday?

Not a chance in the world\!

You're more likely to hang up what you're doing, drive home, and fix that confounded faucet yourself before you have some fly-by-night creep working in your house.

Let's face it--that's not gravitational pull. That's *anti-gravity*.

By definition, most businesses are simply average--lying somewhere between those extremes. Some of them are profitable, others aren't. Yet all of them (assuming they're a sound business) could dramatically improve their bottom line by creating this gravitational pull.

In marketing, we call it "positioning".

While we can all recognize this gravitational pull, most of us find it much harder to define it. Yet we can't deny its mysterious effect.

## **When Gravity Works for You**

Anyone who's ever started a business from scratch, especially in a new space, has faced the uphill battle when gravity works against you:

* You feel like you have to beg others to work with you.  
* You oversell, trying too hard to persuade others to do business with you.  
* You tolerate any-ole customer who comes your way.

For some businesses, the transition is easy. If you're a handyman, just become known as the guy who always returns phone calls and shows up on time. For other businesses, the transition is more challenging.

However, if you're not actively working to shift the pull of gravity, you're fighting a losing battle. Once you've "got it", everything seems to become easier:

* You don't have to chase prospects. They want to work with you.  
* You get to decide who you work with or what projects you take on.  
* You don't have to fight at the feeding trough to bid the bottom dollar. People are willing to pay what you're worth.  
* You don't have to defend yourself, because people see the value that you provide.

When you've got it, the tables turn and everything becomes dramatically easier.

## **The Science of Gravity**

If you remember back to your physics classes, you'll know that gravitational pull is determined by two factors.

The first factor is proximity--how close objects are to each other. The closer one object is to another, the stronger the gravitational pull. The further they drift, the more the pull is reduced. When you drop a rock, the earth wins because the sun is so far away.

The second factor is mass--the amount of substance in an object. The more mass that an object has, the stronger the gravitational pull. The less mass it has, the weaker the gravitational pull. This is why the moon revolves around the earth, and not vice versa.

When you apply these factors to your business, you have four factors to consider:

1. The proximity to your customers or clients  
2. The distance from your competitors  
3. The mass of your business  
4. The mass of your customers or clients

Let's take a look at each of those.

## **Proximity to Your Customers or Clients**

\[star\] Although proximity can be measured any number of ways, the most obvious is this: how visible are you? Do they even know you exist?

\[star\] If you're a local business, *can they find you on Google?* Do you rank near the top? Are you visible on Facebook? What kinds of magazines are they reading? Do they listen to the radio or watch television? Even though the Facebook user base is growing, you're not going to reach baby boomers the same way as millennials.

That's hardly rocket science, and it's so simple, it would be easy to gloss over.

Don't do it.

Just because YOU know that you exist doesn't mean the rest of the world does. My friends and I often joke about "new" discoveries we make about our town...things we've never heard of before such as businesses that have been established for over 10 years, or biking trails referenced by world-famous bloggers. While we aren't natives by a long-shot, we're not exactly the new kids on the block, either.

\[star\] Don't assume that everyone knows you exist. And if you're having a hard time getting in front of your prospects, you can increase your proximity by getting close to them on multiple channels, both online and offline.

However, proximity means more than just eyeballs.

\[star\] Proximity means being able to crawl inside someone else's skin, see what they see, and feel what they feel. It means truly understanding their world--their language, their frustrations, their joys, even their daily life.

It means being able to have them look you in your eyes and believe you when you tell them, "I know exactly how you're feeling."

But what does this look like in real life?

The small town of Canon City has seen its ebb and flow of coffee shops. While some of them have had a fantastic atmosphere, they've never lasted long. However, one coffee shop has bucked the trend, choosing a different location (and different model) than any other coffee shop has chosen.

They've ditched the atmosphere and stripped down the coffee shop to one thing...a drive-through. They've proven to their customers that they understand the busy, harried, and sometimes sleep-deprived workforce, rushing to get their kids ready for school before racing out the door to make it to work on time. If they're running late, they can even call in their order when they leave the house to shorten the wait.

They sell coffee for people on the move, and they're running like gangbusters. The early morning rush keeps their baristas on their toes. While they've got a great location, they've been able to tap into something much more important. They've been able to crawl inside people's minds and give them what they really want.

However, they've been able to do something more.

## **Distance from Your Competition**

They've also been able to distance themselves from their competition. The only other coffee shop with a drive-through is ten miles outside of town, catching commuters on their way to Colorado Springs.

That’s not to say that all competitive distance must be geographic. In fact, you might choose to place yourself smack-dab in the same neighborhood as your most direct competitors, leveraging other ways to create distance between you and them.

Whenever you distance yourself from your competition, you stop fighting against their gravitational pull.

Don't get me wrong--blindly distancing yourself from your competitors can get you in trouble. If you distance yourself from your competitors and don't move yourself closer to your customers, you've lost the game.

However, if you can find the magic combination of distancing yourself from your competitor while bringing yourself closer to your customers or clients, you can increase the strength of your gravitational pull.

\[star\] You can change this by your geographic focus, the types of products or services you provide, your business model, the type of value that you bring, the unique combination of products or services you provide, or a different way of making or delivering the products or services.

## **Making it Practical**

 In the next chapter, we’ll talk about "mass"--the secret to packing a strong punch when you're the underdog, or dominating the market when you're the leader. 

You'll also learn how to make the mindset shift, because I'm convinced that while what happens inside of you isn't everything, it has a dramatic impact on your positioning, or gravitational pull.

(By the way, if you're a non-profit, you can apply these exact concepts to donors, volunteers, and other giving opportunities. In fact, non-profits have a great opportunity to strengthen gravitational pull.)

If you're willing to make this practical, you should take 20-30 minutes right now to:

1. Grab a paper and pen. (Yes, you should do this by hand.)  
2. Read back over this article. I've even marked the parts you need to focus on with a little "star".  
3. Write down your business's strengths and weaknesses for each question or item in the list.  
4. Repeat the process for at least one (hopefully more) of your competitors.  
5. Spend some time looking for high-leverage ways to strengthen your positioning, then go out and start implementing it in your marketing.

Only 5% of my readers will actually do this, but the ones who do will likely land themselves in the top 1% of business owners.

They'll be the ones who own the gravitational pull.

## **Building a Business that Packs a Punch**

What's the difference between businesses that have strong market appeal and seem to win in the marketplace, and businesses that don't?

The law of gravity is at work not only in physics, but also in business. It's a measurable force that's at play as you build your competitive advantage. As you remember from your physics class, the law of gravity has two components: distance and mass.

When you're evaluating your competitive advantage, you’ll again  need to look at these four specific factors:

1. The proximity to your customers or clients  
2. The distance from your competitors  
3. The mass of your business  
4. The mass of your customers or clients

In the last chapter, we discussed the first two items, related to distance. The closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients.

However, being close to your target market has little impact if you don't have another crucial ingredient: mass. Without it, you cannot attract your target market. And without it, they will not be attracted to you.

So what is mass, and how do you build it?

## **Size Does Not Equal Mass**

The definition of mass is quite simple. Mass is simply the amount of matter in a business. However, within that definition is a simple nuance that's worth uncovering.

Apart from matters of distance, why does the sun hold a stronger attraction than the earth? If you're in elementary school, the simplistic answer is that the sun is bigger than the earth. However, that's not entirely true.

When it comes to gravity, the issue at stake is not size but mass. The amount of space occupied does not equal the amount of matter.

Why is this important?

As businesses grow, many of them begin to occupy increasing amounts of space. They begin to take over their market and capitalize on their economy of scale. However, unless they're careful, they increase their reach without increasing the strength of their business.

That's when they become vulnerable to disruption. A smaller company discovers how to significantly increase the amount of value they provide, and even though they lose by a space advantage, they have strength within their small ranks, and they begin to win the market.

This is an important rule to remember in business: mass does not equal space occupied. This is about who packs the biggest punch.

You can have Goliath companies that occupy all kinds of industry real estate, but when you look inside, they've got very little fighting power. Meanwhile, you can have David companies that are much smaller on the surface but pack a powerful punch.

Without offering up specific names, some of the large advertising firms have a broad presence but provide extremely sloppy and poorly managed ad campaigns for their clients. It's not uncommon for well-educated, savvy consultants to easily outperform these big companies.

While on the outset, these companies appear to have the upper hand, they are often Goliaths who are inwardly rotting away. If you’re going to knock the giant off the hill, you must change your perspective from merely “size and scale” to “mass and impact”.

## **Building Mass**

When you begin to look at your business from the perspective of mass, not merely size, you begin to measure based on the impact you're having on the market and the value you're providing to your people.

This means a deep hunt into the places where you can provide a tremendous amount of value, with a proportionally small amount of effort. If you make this a practice, it becomes a virtuous cycle that turns your business into a lean, toned muscle machine instead of deteriorating into a flabby giant.

Even when you're facing a giant, if you remain creative, you can likely find ways to increase your value. You must look for cracks in their armor, places where they're weak, and capitalize on them.

What are specific ways that you can increase mass?

\[star\] You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority. You might produce hard, results-oriented case studies, or simply capture testimonials from your happy customers or clients. You might leverage a story of overturning a sacred ideal within your industry. You might seek out other platforms to establish your credibility with interviews, books, articles, etc. It's worth something to do business with someone who's respected in their industry.

\[star\] You can provide guarantees. Many businesses are scared of offering guarantees because they're afraid people will take advantage of them. However, many times the benefit far outweighs the cost. You might guarantee freshness, quality, timeliness, or effectiveness. If you're in an industry where business owners scoff at guarantees (or if you doubt whether you can offer one), you probably have a ripe opportunity for a guarantee.

\[star\] You can find ways to delight your customers. Hunt for the right spot for your team members. Make sure the person on the phone has a smile on their face (yourself included\!). Make sure the people doing fulfillment have the detail and follow-through required. Have a team member send reminder text messages or phone calls.

\[star\] You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service. Find ways to get better results at a substantially lower cost. Automate the pieces that are human. Humanize the pieces that are automated. Reduce the response time. Find a way to improve the results.

\[star\] Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider. To borrow the words of Margaret Thatcher, "If you have to tell people you’re \[a person of integrity\], you aren't." However, if you can prove to people that you have integrity (especially in businesses that require high trust), you've just increased the value you provide.

Again, you must measure yourself by the value that you provide to your customers or clients, rather than your size.

## **Your Mindset Matters**

While we've just covered practical ways to increase your gravitational pull, I'd like to discuss one more angle: your mindset.

Don't buy into the nonsensical lie that says if you just change your mindset, you'll start attracting high-quality buyers. Not exactly true. That's why I started with extremely practical ideas first.

However, even if you're a practical thinker, don't dismiss the importance of deeply-rooted beliefs. When they move from merely an opinion to a deeply-held conviction, they will alter how you communicate and present yourself. They will affect everything from your marketing, to your communication with your customers, and even your physiology.

Two core convictions are important.

The first conviction is that no single deal will make or break your business. Believing otherwise is to diminish the quality that made you an entrepreneur in the first place--your ability to innovate, to solve challenging problems, and to create opportunity where none existed before. It will also pull you from the place of healthy power that allows you to make winning negotiations.

Have I lost deals that I thought I really needed at the time? Absolutely\! The more desperate that I was for the deal, the worse I positioned myself. The stronger my conviction that I didn't need the deal, the better my negotiation. Even in the deals that I lost, when I embraced this conviction, I found that the loss only strengthened my own positioning. (And often, better opportunities awaited me.)

The second belief is simply having an internal conviction of excellence, a healthy pride about what you do--knowing that you do really great work. Having a conviction of the value you provide to people, knowing that you are exceptional in your work, will create a gravitational pull around you.

These beliefs drive a core emotion--confidence. That confidence, when rooted in truth and the reality of who you are and what you have to offer, will fundamentally alter the way that you do business.

## **Making it Practical**

Just like I encouraged you in the last chapter, you should take 20-30 minutes right now to make this practical.

Here's how:

1. Grab a paper and pen. (Yes, you should do this by hand.)  
2. Read back over this article. I've even marked the parts you need to focus on with a little "star".  
3. Write down your strengths and weaknesses--the places you provide immense amounts of value, and the places where you find yourself weak.  
4. Spend some time looking for high-leverage ways to strengthen your positioning.  
5. Make an action plan, then go out and start implementing it in your marketing.

I expect less than 3% of my readers to actually complete the exercise. Thinking strategically about your business is challenging, because it flies in the face of our Protestant work ethic. However, those who do it will likely land themselves in the top 1% of business owners.

Be the one to own the gravitational pull.

# **Breaking Free from Gravity**

## Introduction

In the past two chapters, we discussed why we are drawn to certain businesses and why certain businesses get sucked into profit-sucking competition.

If you’re starting your business, you might be able to avoid entering these kinds of markets to begin with. However, how do you escape the gravitational pull if you already have an established business? Just as importantly, how do you extract customers from your competitor’s gravitational pull?

The secret lies in a special power. It’s the power that enables entrepreneurs to think outside the box, change the status quo, be a bit contrarian, and actually leverage gravity to their favor.

The secret is in the power of lift.

## What is Lift?

Don’t worry. I’ll skip the science lesson here. Lift is pretty complicated to understand, much less to explain. To put it really simply, an airplane wing creates “lift” because changes the speed and direction of the air.

This means there are two critical elements:

1. Changing the speed of your environment  
2. Changing the direction of your environment

Lift is a unique power because even though you are moving in one direction, it also propels you in another direction, allowing you to overpower the gravitational forces.

How can the principles of lift benefit your business? We’re going to look at lift in two ways:  creating lift for your business and creating lift for your customers.

## Breaking Your Business Free from Gravity

How can you utilize the power of lift to extract your business from your competitors’ gravity?

For this example, think of your business as the airplane and your environment as the air. You can create lift in two ways: you can go faster than your environment or you can go in a different direction than your environment.

## Increasing the Speed of Your Business

To change the speed of your environment, you must make speed your 

Let’s start with the first option: speed. You must look for ways to move more quickly than the market. To be effective, this means that you must leave a wake behind you that increases the speed of the market. While it’s possible for your competitor to follow your wake, this wake can also create significant turbulence for your competitor.

As you increase the speed of the market, you create an upward pull, allowing you to break free from your competitor’s gravitation pull. The converse is also true: if you are moving more slowly than the market, you may find your business falling (or sometimes crashing) to the ground.

When you focus on speed, it’s especially critical to streamline your business as much as possible to reduce drag. You must reduce friction as much as possible in your marketing. Diffuse objections before they appear, gain any “unfair advantage” in building trust with your market, and (perhaps most importantly) finding ways to sell in invisible ways.

However, you must not only friction externally. You must also find ways to reduce internal friction. As the business owner, regularly eliminate noise from your life, and teach your leadership team to do the same. Develop your people to operate in their sweet spot, allowing them to produce the maximum output with the least effort. Streamline cumbersome business processes. Regularly cut off the fat of politics and bureaucracy. Implement business processes that prevent your most expensive mistakes. Build your business into a well-oiled machine, take off the rough edges, and give yourself every advantage possible in the market.

As you consider speed, it’s important to remember that doubling velocity actually quadruples lift. Even small, seemingly insignificant changes can have a tremendous impact. Where can you double your speed to quadruple your results?

If you are moving in the flow of the market, you must be streamlined to be able to move as quickly as possible. You must make it as easy as possible to move forward, or you’ll find it very difficult to create lift. Unless you streamline, you’ll be creating drag and allowing yourself to get sucked into your competitor’s gravity.

What are practical ways to increase the speed of your business?

Take time to prioritize, and take care of your priorities first. Spend the first hour of your day working on the most critical task in your business, and you’ll find your productivity skyrocketing. Teach your team to do the same, and you’ll multiply your efforts.

Delegate things that can be done by others, so you can concentrate on the things that can be done only by you.

Bring order to your chaos. If you can’t do it yourself, you owe it to yourself and your business to find someone who can. As entrepreneurs, we’re constantly restless, constantly moving forward, and constantly creating chaos. You may think that you just don’t have time to deal with the papers, bookwork, and schedules that are constantly piling up and shouting for your attention. However, putting good systems in place and delegating work as necessary, perhaps utilizing some software tools, will create a ripple effect that will create speed in your business.

Finally, make sure everyone on your team is doing what they are good at and what they enjoy. If you can capture that, you’ve harnessed two powerful forces: innate genius and innate motivation. Productivity skyrockets when this happens.

Let me give you a practical example of a local consignment shop. Consignment shops typically require consignors to set up an appointment to consign their items. For years, the shop followed this system. While it worked, it required consignors to match their schedule with the shop’s, and the shop could only meet with a limited number of consignors.

The shop owners realized that more consignors mean more product, and more product means more money. The shop decided to change directions slightly. In addition to accepting appointments, the shop began offering bins for consignors to drop off their items. Consignors could stop by at any time, drop off as many items as they could fit in a tote bin, fill out a simple card with their information, and be on their way.

This dramatically streamlined the consignment shop’s operations, and the flexibility enabled many more consignors to drop off their items. It was a win-win for both the store and the consignors. This slight change in their business model reaped big results. 

## Changing the Direction of Your Business

If you find yourself wearying from constantly struggling to increase your speed, take heart. You have another choice: you can change direction.

When most entrepreneurs attempt to disrupt the status quo, they commonly make the mistake of trying to reverse the direction of the market. This is much like the airplane trying to change the direction of the wind. It’s likely to create a lot of drag and little or no lift. In the worst case, it will send you crashing into the ground.

While you as a business may choose to a 180-degree turn from the market, it’s crucial to remember that it is the *business* that is making the turn-around, not the market. In order to get lift, you only need the market to adjust slightly based on your contrarian approach. The greater your propulsion, the more power you have to change the direction of the market and to increase lift. However, this requires you to be aware of exactly how difficult it can be to turn the direction of the market, as well as your capacity to invest.

It is much easier to be a contrarian business, while only asking the consumers to slightly change their buying behaviors, than to ask consumers to make a dramatic change to their behavior.

In order to get lift, you only need a slight change of direction. If you can face the flow of the market and create even a small change in the market, your business can fly.

Let’s discuss some practical examples.

When Henry Ford first invented the car, the market was focused on one thing: better carriages. However, Ford pursued a very different and very contrarian direction: horseless carriages. Don’t miss the fact that this was a major turn in the market, and it brought unique challenges to adoption.

However, while this was a significant shift for the market, it’s also important to remember that buyers were already paying for methods of transportation. Ford was introducing a shift in the *kind* of transportation. While the leap from driving a car instead of a carriage was non-trivial, the leap from *building* a car was much bigger.

It’s also worth noting that when Ford’s competitors began to appear, he began increasing the speed of his business, introducing the assembly line and streamlining his operations. These decisions were critical in him securing his position in the market.

What about more modern examples?

With the rise of the Internet, businesses everywhere are moving to online marketing, and with good reason. Google, Facebook, and other advertising platforms have made it both easier and cheaper to reach people than ever before. However, while the market is moving in that direction, some businesses have returned to traditional advertising, even using “outdated” direct mail to build their business.

Why does it work? They’ve chosen to move in a different direction from the market, and they’ve influenced their leads to change their behavior slightly--sit down to read a piece of paper, instead of scrolling their Facebook feed.

To make it practical, one of the best things you can do is look at your business and market with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, “What’s the bandwagon, and what is *everyone* doing?” More likely than not, this question will yield clues to ways that you change the direction of your business and create the lift required to escape your competitors’ gravity.

## Helping Your Customers Go Faster

Lift not only allows your business to pull from your competitors’ gravity, it also allows you to extract customers from your competitors’ gravitational pull.

In this situation, think of your customers as the airplane. By helping them to increase their speed and change their direction, you create lift that propels them in a different dimension, allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of your competition.

How can you use speed to create lift for your customers? The answer is simple: find ways to allow your customers to move more quickly.

The easiest way to explain is with a few practical examples.

Make it easy for customers to come to you. Do you have an website? Make sure it’s intuitive and user friendly, and make the important information easy to find. Do you have a storefront? Make sure your hours match what your customers need. Make it easy for them to find what they need, and make it easy for them to pay.

You can help them move more quickly by removing friction, as well. A loyalty program reduces the friction of buying from you.

Above all, top notch, friendly customer service is the grease that cuts through the friction of all kinds of business disasters--a defective product, a particularly difficult shopping experience, an unfortunate experience beyond your control. In each situation, the customer service enables you to move quickly.

Here’s a practical example of increasing your customer’s speed to create lift.

A local real estate company uses an innovative way of retaining customers while furnishing a service to them. Their customers sometimes have a couple months between selling one house and closing on another, or they’ve sold their house and are waiting for the perfect home to come on the market. The real estate makes rentals available to their customers. In a town where property managers often require a 12-15 month lease, they will allow their customers to end their lease anytime with just two months’ notice as long as they buy their next house with them.  

Fulfilling a customer need? Check.

Creating future business for the real estate office? Check.

This arrangement allows the customer to move more quickly, not only by allowing them to move into their new home more quickly but also by removing significant friction when buying a new home. By helping their customer move more quickly, they create lift for their customer, pulling them away from the competition, while addressing an important need. 

The arrangement benefits everyone.

You might have to rethink the norms. For example, a local preschool class benefited greatly from simply shifting their schedule half an hour later to accommodate nap times. By reducing this friction, it created a lift for their attendees, pulling them away from competing activities and allowing them to attend.

## Helping Your Customers Change Direction

Remember, lift is also created by changing direction. You can use this law to pull customers away from your competition.

Most obviously, you can create lift in your customers by helping them shift their thinking. All sales, marketing, and advertising are, at some level, attempts to influence people’s thinking. We all understand the overt persuasion of a used car salesman. However, many people fail to fully appreciate the value of the much subtler, yet much more powerful shifts of thinking.

The seed that you might plant in your customer’s mind might be the educational pamphlet they received in the mail. It might be the blog post they read that you posted. These might be strictly informational. In fact, they might have little branding and no strong call to action. However, they may shift your prospect’s thinking away from your competitor, putting the wind in their wings to escape that gravitational pull.

You might influence your customers to think about “lifetime value” instead of “upfront cost”. You might change their focus, causing them to think about problems they’ve ignored for far too long and to anticipate the possibilities of finally solving those problems.

You might simply change the direction of their focus, allowing yourself to be more visible and more known to them.

However, perhaps the most powerful tool is helping them change the direction of their lives. At every point of the process--whether it’s in marketing, sales, fulfillment--you find a way to deliver transformation.

Consider the example of a public speaking class.

The marketing materials inspire individuals with confidence, while providing them a simple tip to improve their public speaking. The sales conversations provide insight and clarity into their personal objectives as a public speaker, as well as honest perspective on the best way for them to achieve it. The classes themselves instill them with confidence and a much broader toolset of communication.

At every stage of the process--even before they’ve become a customer--you’ve begun to change the trajectory of their lives. You’ve started to turn them away from their plateau and started to influence them towards becoming a better person. And that influence, when properly used, will begin to pull them away from your competitors’ gravitational grip.

You will receive a fully customized report, showing your Gravity of Competition Score, as well as personalized feedback for your specific results.

Once you complete your scorecard, you are welcome to reach out to me for a complimentary 20-minute Gravity of Competition consultation, where we can dig into specific questions you have about this booklet, your scorecard, or your business.
