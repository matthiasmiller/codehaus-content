**Target: 175 Words**

I wrote this issue's article somewhat sheepishly, knowing that I'd probably broken every deadline in our monthly schedule. I'm sheepish, but not entirely remorseful. (Shh...don't tell my team\!)

Why?

Maybe we have TOO much of a team spirit, and I know that the rest of the crew will cover for me. :-)

But of course, that's not all.

I've been heads-down on a number of exciting projects (which I'm not allowed to talk about yet). Unfortunately, these projects have taken much longer than I anticipated, so here I am, finishing up the newsletter way past my deadline.

I've also spent a week or two on vacation--spending time with family, catching up with old friends, making memories, and enjoying life. My wife and I have focused on making weekend memories with our family this year, and it's true--life with kids is a blast\!

That's what summer's like at Multiply Your Strengths. Real life. Bumps in the road. But we're moving forward, making memories, and loving the ride\!

Thanks for riding along with us\!
