Intro:

Hello there, Matthias here\!

As one of my most faithful subscribers, your feedback is important to me. That's why I am beginning an annual "reader's survey." This is the first time I've ever done anything like this with my email list, so I'm really excited to read everybody's feedback\! The feedback and answers you guys give in this survey will greatly influence future content for my weekly emails\!

That's why your feedback is so important to me because it will tell me what exactly you WANT. So, in light of that, thanks for taking the time\!

Enjoy\! And, as always...

Be the best you\!
