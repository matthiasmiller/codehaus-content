# **4\. Thoughts on Procrastination**

From Linda Rose:

I've read the warning about perfectionism frequently, but in the housekeeping arena. FLYLady says that perfection is the biggest enemy of good housekeeping. We think we don't have time to do it right, then we don't do anything. One of her mottos is, "Housework done imperfectly still blesses your family." which I have adapted to my situation, "Housework done incompletely still blesses my home."

From Me:  
I'm just getting back from vacation, and I was struck by how profoundly this touches a lot of people's struggle with procrastination. Great way to cut to the root of it. Thanks\!

# **5\. Wealth and Lack**

The belief that it takes money to make money, is often rooted in lack from an attempt to become rich. Wealth can create value from existing resources.

# **8\. Emerging Markets**

a lot of people don't understand that markets have a continue growth cycle, and that there is always a young, emerging market. People who feel like they are missing opportunities, are simply not noticing the emerging markets. Emerging markets have a huge growth potential, and it's the people on the front end of these that are able to capitalize.

There's almost a prophetic ability to be able to detect which ones will work, and which ones won't.

**10a. Dramatic Ideas:**  
I think there are a lot of times that we think a dramatic course of action,  
or a radical wild and reckless action will give us the breakthrough that we  
need. Most times we don't recognize that it's just a blind leap of faith  
that is unsupported.

**10b. Followup to Dramatic Ideas:**  
Perhaps one of the reasons that we like dramatic ideas, even if they are  
risky, is that they give us a sense of momentum and they give us a sense of  
hope. Even if it is a false hope.

Include interesting observation about alcoholisn and addiction.

# **12\. Leadership and big picture**

As a leader the closer you are to the day to day operations , the more likely you are to be blinded to the big picture strategic shifts you need to take.

# **13\. Leverage when applied**

Leadership is a leverage tool as a ROLE not as a skill. The skill doesn't matter until you can employ it. Followers creates leverage more than rhe skill of leadership does. 

Once you have the ROLE, that's when skills will increase that leverage.

# **14\. Circles of Possibility**

The drift that people experience is just a deceptive version of "line upon line" and 'precept upon precept'.

growth comes through a series of concessions that opens up the possibilities for new beliefs.

the same with drift.

but you have to make those concessions to avoid dismissing truth as non-sensical. a lot of people would dismiss me because they don't understand where i'm coming from, because they haven't seen the “trail markers” of my growth.

This is the concept behind the “circles of possibility” training that they did.

# **15\. Spotlight**

Some people are scared of the spotlight, because they are afraid that when they get in the spotlight people will see that they are not as successful as they appear. They are afraid that people will begin to see their flaws and will doubt their confidence in them

This is a variant of the imposter syndrome. The only difference is that it happens before success comes.

Many times this is a ridiculous fear because these people do not actually get the spotlight that they anticipate. Why not wait to worry about this problem until they actually reach that point?

**16\. HEROISM: Kids vs Adults**

Contrast the believability of a child vs. the skepticism of the adult?

As a kid, we believe we can be anything, because we believe in our own greatness.

As adults, we don’t believe that we can be anything anymore, because we believe in our own failures too strongly (?).

For example, a child will imagine and believe they can be Thomas Edison. An adult will not compare themselves with Thomas Edison, until there’s a way that they can realize that he accomplished his successes as a “mere mortal. Adults tend to discredit themselves and their potential success.

# **17\. Head trash**

A lot of people feel greedy asking for money.

Some people started making money once they stopped giving stuff away.

If your prejudice is that people in the country club are vain, it'll work against you. The truth that children believe is the conversations they overhear at the top of the stairs.

People who grow up without money can easily for judgments about wealthy people, often even a victim mentality of the wealthy.

Some of the head trash you face is trying to be benevolent and help other people

# **20\. Vulnerability and Teachability**

So one of the things that I realize was that teachability requires you to recognize that you're wrong, which is a form of vulnerability. This means that teachability is actually something is required for protection and support (inspired by Alex Charfen), but it is difficult to receive

There's a high cost to freedom, and it's usually not "free". THe people who thrive on change often neglect to calculate the deep cost of change. Change \*has\* to bring an ROI.

# **23\. The right problem**

It is not only important what skills you have. What is almost as important is what PROBLEM you solve with these skills. Applying your skills to a different problem can yield 10-100x results.

# **24\. Cloud Computing and Labor**

At work we have worker bees and band directors, and we can spin up new EC2 instances.

What if you had the same thing for the manufacturing industry? Like Mechanical Turks, only different.

This is a little bit like the latest shark tank, where they ship product to a central location.
