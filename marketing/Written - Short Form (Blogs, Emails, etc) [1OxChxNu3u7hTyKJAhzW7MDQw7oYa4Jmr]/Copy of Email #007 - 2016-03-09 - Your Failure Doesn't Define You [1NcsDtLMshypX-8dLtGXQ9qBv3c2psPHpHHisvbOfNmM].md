Tom spent his nights and weekends hunched over his workbench. All he needed as a working prototype. With that, he would change the world forever. But for now, Tom spent hours every day meticulously filing one worthless patent after another.

He was a nameless failure.

Perhaps you feel the same way: spending your nights and weekends trying to pull the pieces together, spending your day in meaningless busywork, and living on the hope that some day, you will find your answer.

Don’t lose heart, though\! Tom, the Nameless Failure did eventually find success. It took two years of relentless research and thousands of failures, but he did it.

Tom, the Nameless Failure, is better known by his full name: Thomas A. Edison.

Thomas Edison is no different than you.  
   
Like Tom, you strive for excellence, doing everything to the best of your ability.

Like Tom, your best still falls short, no matter how hard you try. No matter how carefully you project your plans, something still blindsides you. Sometimes the things you care most about are the things you seem to fail most miserably at.

But there's a conclusion you must refuse to make from this:

Refuse to believe your failure reflects your value, or that your history determines your future. Reject the lie that you are less of a person with less potential because you failed.

By refusing to believe these lies, you dodge the punch that knocks most people out. Failure isn’t an obstacle in your path. Rather, it propels you forward.

When you become certain of your own value as an individual, apart from achievements or failures, you are free to fail. Rather than needing to taste the bitterness of defeat, you can get back up again and keep moving.

So live out of your worth, keep failing forward, and be the best you\!
