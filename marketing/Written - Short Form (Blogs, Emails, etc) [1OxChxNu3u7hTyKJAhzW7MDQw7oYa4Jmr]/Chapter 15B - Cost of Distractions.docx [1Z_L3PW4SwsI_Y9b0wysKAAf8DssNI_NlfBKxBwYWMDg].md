## **The Cost of Distraction**

Growth always happens when you work to your capacity. You do what you can now, and continually doing what you can will grow your capacity to become more than you can be today.

Entering into the plateau is your opportunity to continue expanding your limits. The deception of the plateau is that it feels like you're not advancing. It feels like you're stuck in the same place when you're actually becoming familiar with your situation and developing the capacity to grow to the next level.

Jumping to another idea when it feels like you're in a plateau has a big cost that you may not be aware of.

## **Lost Skills**

People who have become excellent in their field have developed a very narrow focus. They are not worried about being the best at everything. They have intentionally become the best at one thing.

Trying to break through a plateau by changing your focus has a significant long-term cost. All of the initial energy you poured into the project now gets redirect elsewhere, only some of it will be used much less efficiently and must less effectively.

Your internal resume goes from saying that, "I completed this marathon" to "I trained for a marathon." If you adjust your goal to a shorter race, all is not lost, but if you look for a more interesting challenge to pursue, chances are that you will not be able to fully utilize the training.

That's not to say you can't derive value from mixing unrelated experiences. In fact, that's a very powerful tool. And if you're headed in a direction that does not support where you want to go, it's your responsibility to redirect your course and deal with the cost.

However, more often than not, we simply become bored with the road that we're taking, and we forget everything that we have been pushing for a fighting for.

You must change your perspective of the time that you spend in your plateau. You must recognize that this is an invitation for you to begin to further hone your skills, to dig deeper into the person you want to become.

The more drastic the distraction, the greater the cost.

## **Lost Motivation**

Just as importantly is the psychological cost of moving to another project. You've got to manage your own perception of what happened. You might tell yourself that it was a failure, a dead-end, something you weren't able to accomplish. Or you might tell yourself that it was a detour, an indirect step to where you ultimately wanted to go.

Even though we often allow distractions to pull us away because we are in search of motivation, this will actually undermine your motivation. Your motivation is not something that you mysteriously find. It is something that you are responsible for generating. It's like a muscle that you can build, and if you continually look for another opportunity whenever it becomes difficult, you will find that muscle wasting away.

It's never worth getting stuck in a situation that does not serve us well. Many people are working jobs they dislike simply because they do not have the courage to step out on a new venture.

However, many people are also leaving jobs they once loved and that will one day take them closer to where they want to go, just because they are unwilling to will their way through the difficulty and challenge.

What you hear is absolutely true: sometimes you must give up quickly and easily, but other times you must push through to the very end. Some ideas, even if they materialize, simply will not change the world. But other ideas will not change the world until you've wrestled them to the ground and given them absolutely everything that you have within you.

Some people will advise you to ditch your plan, and they may be correct. Other times, they may be completely wrong.

Experience and wisdom will tell you which ideas are worth pursuing, and which must be abandoned.

## **Lost Significance**

Perhaps the greatest cost of abandoning your greatest plan during its plateau is the loss of significance. In every economy, price corresponds to value. The things that are most valuable are the things that have the highest cost associated with them, and the things that cost the most are also the things we associate the most value to.

It stands to reason, then, that the things that matter the most in life are the things that will cost us the most. The things that hold the greatest significance to us will demand our full attention, our full dedication, and our full effort.

Abandoning an idea that is worth pursuing robs you of the significance buried within that idea. It's like deciding to plant a forest, then planting an acorn, watering it, and then uprooting the sapling because it's taking too long to grow. The fruit of your labor becomes undone.

Your ability to push through to the next level requires an ability to keep pressing through the plateau.

## **Small Change or Big Change?**

Many people become frustrated when they hit a plateau, and their instinct is to introduce significant change. However, many times they look for changes that completely disrupt them from their goal. Rather than trying to improve upon their career, they choose a different career altogether. Rather than trying to build upon their marriage, they settle for divorce and try again with someone else.

Small tweaks will not get you out of the plateau, because playing at the next level requires more change than that. You need significant upheaval and change.

However, the big changes that you need are not changes in your direction or your dreams. The big changes that you need are learning to play at a completely different level.

Life is like a game, and each level has slightly different rules. Each level of success comes with different requirements, different rules. Often this requires learning a completely different way of thinking, a completely different way of living.

How, then, do you develop the courage and the stamina to keep pressing through the plateau? Here are several simple tips.

## **Trust the Process**

First of all, live with patience. Realize that not everything will come to you in an instant. The things that have the greatest benefit also often require the greatest investment of time. Nature will not take an acorn and give you an oak tree overnight. It requires nurture, focused attention and care.

Don't allow yourself to become careless with the things that you're doing through your plateau. Continue giving it the same focus, the same attention, and the same effort

Simply recognizing the temptation to become distracted will allow you to keep a stronger focus during this time. Remain aware of the distraction, and actively fight against it.

Second, embrace the process, recognizing that the process will carry you to the finish line. Recognize that the process is worth every bit as much as trophy, because the process itself is what makes it possible to become who you want to become.

## **Push Yourself Deeper**

Third, determine to push yourself deeper. Even in the middle of a plateau, when it feels like you've hit the ceiling in your job or your role, you get to determine how much deeper you go.

One of the best challenges for me has been learning to influence organizations where I hold no form influence. "Leadership," in the words of John Maxwell, "is influence, nothing more, nothing less." Rather than blaming the people around me for having such a stifling environment, I intentionally developed myself internally. I developed a resolve to enjoy the situations I was in. I resolved to intentionally build deeper relationships and care more deeply for the people around me.

Other times, I intentionally pursued changes in my role so that I could have a more challenging role--something that would push me to become a better person. Even though the change may not come as quickly and as drastically as it will during other seasons of life, it allows me to internalize the lessons I have been learning, and it allows me to go deeper in the places that I have been.

Determine to push yourself deeper. Learn what you can, change what you can, and embrace the process that you're in.

## **Push Yourself Higher**

Fourth, determine to live your life ready for the next level. Start living your life with the rules required for the next game. Determine to live as if you were ready for the next level of success.

Learn the rules that you need to play at the next level, and start integrating them into your life. Many people expect that successful people live differently because they are successful. Rather, people are successful because they live differently.

You will not be able to reach for the next level until you begin intentionally changing the way that you think and live.

## **Don't Fall for Illusion**

The illusion of the plateau is that you're not making any progress and that you're not growing. This may be completely true, but it may be nothing but an illusion. The question is simply, "What's your point of reference?"

Two ships at sea headed directly for each other, will not be able to gauge how fast the other ship is moving. In fact, it appears that the other ship is not moving at all. Why? The ships are lined up perfectly, headed in the same direction.

In the same way, if you remain focused on your end goal, you may fall for the illusion that you're not making any progress, because you're always lined up with where you want to go.

To break this illusion, just start reviewing the things that you've been doing to make forward progress. If you're actually stuck in a plateau, you will have a list of things that have actually hindered your progress. However, it may be that you are simply unable to recognize the places where you've been making significant progress in your life.

## **Which Ideas Should Die?**

The big question, of course, is which ideas should live and which ideas should die. Of course, this is a complex question, and you may not have all the answers you need to answer it. But here are some simple questions you can ask yourself:

* What is the likelihood of this actually succeeding?

* If I do achieve this, what's the likelihood that it will give me the results I desire?

* If I fail, what intellectual, relational, or financial capital will I have built that I can use for my next idea?

* Will a failure leave me richer or poorer (intellectually, relationally, or financially)?

Simply put, you get to way the amount of risk you are willing to take on. Some ideas are actually a lot less risky than they appear because they will leave you with a wealth of knowledge, resources, and insight that would have been impossible to gain any other way. However, you must measure whether that wealth will serve you in your future.

It may be that the risk is high, but that the reward is great, and that you're willing to put it all on the line for the reward. There's a fine line between courageous and foolhardy, and it's easy to become intoxicated by our own genius and great ideas.

If you are careful with your approach, you can have a venture that will serve you well both in success and in failure. However, you must be deliberate and intentional to make that happen.

## **Final Warning**

If you're in the middle of a plateau, be aware of your own tendency to discard the things that you've developed and built. This is not a warning against change, but rather a warning against change that takes you in a direction you do not want to go, simply because you were unwilling and unable to motivate yourself during the difficult times.

Embrace the process, and the process will carry you to the end.
