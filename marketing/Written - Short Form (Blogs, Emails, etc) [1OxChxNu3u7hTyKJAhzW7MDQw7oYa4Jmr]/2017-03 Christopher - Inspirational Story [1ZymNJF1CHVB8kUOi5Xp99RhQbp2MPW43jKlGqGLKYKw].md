* The Best Customer Service

Have you ever walked into a store and been made to feel like a sale waiting to happen?

In an age so driven by sales and profits that customers become mere numbers and stats, it’s refreshing to hear about businesses who curb the trends and see their customers as people again.

A Best Buy in Long Island, New York did just that this past Christmas. Thankfully, it was all captured on video for us to see as well.

According to DailyMail.co.uk, the Best Buy employees began noticing a teenage boy coming into the store every day to play the display Nintendo Wii U. Quickly catching on, they soon hatched a plan to surprise the teen with his very own Wii U console.

At first the young man hesitated to take the gift. However, he eventually accepted it and the employees drove him home to his parents.

These kind employees have demonstrated that, even amidst the hustle of busy seasons there’s always time for generosity.
