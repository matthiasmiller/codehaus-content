# **What’s Your Unique Leadership DNA?**

Every leader has a set of qualities that are unique to them. These include their instinctive strengths, their communication style, and their unique way of getting things done. It is their *modus operandi*.

Unfortunately, many leaders don’t know exactly what those are. Studies have demonstrated that working *with your grain* instead of against it is one of the most powerful tools to:

* Reduce stress  
* Increase efficiency  
* Increase fulfillment

It’s a secret of mine that I probably haven’t talked enough about. For years, I’ve used the Kolbe A™ Index as a tool to get x-ray vision into the instinctive strengths of myself and my team members.

I’ve obsessed over making this change first for myself, and secondly for my team. It’s freed me up to focus on the highest priority projects without getting buried in the day-to-day administration. It’s also caused my team members to make comments like, “My wife is so thankful that I am working for this company.”

Along the way, I’ve learned the importance of a healthy, aligned team. A team where everyone is on the right seat on the bus.

During the month of July, I’m paying for individual indexes and interpretations **for a limited number of subscribers**.
