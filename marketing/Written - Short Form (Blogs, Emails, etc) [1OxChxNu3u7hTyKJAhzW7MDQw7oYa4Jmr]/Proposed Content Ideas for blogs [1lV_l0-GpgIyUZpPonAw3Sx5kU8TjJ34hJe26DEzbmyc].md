How I come up with Unique Content:

* I read a lot and let the ideas sit in the back of my mind.  
* I look for other angles on existing ideas.  
* I look for combinations of ideas, where one idea meets another, and it puts it in a whole other light/perspective.

**Advertising:**

*This is primarily in the context of a local business.*

* ~~Branding vs. Targeted Advertising \-- branding builds awareness and familiarity; targeted advertising is focused on targeting specific people~~  
* ~~Measuring Your Advertising \-- do you know your advertising ROI? Are you tracking your advertising results in different media? For example, do you know how many responses from a newspaper? (You might mention Call Tracking services.)~~  
* ~~Building Referral Systems \-- referrals are only as powerful as you make them. If you are getting some word-of-mouth, you can get more by having a system to ask for referrals. For example, common approach is a referral discount, or you can simply ask people if they know of others who would be interested (more for a service business maybe than retail?)~~  
* ~~Targeting on multiple platforms/media. Create a presence to become visible wherever the person looks. This is not just about Facebook vs. Google, but it’s also about doing both online and offline advertising.~~  
* **~~(Matthias)~~** ~~Advertising vs. SEO \-- the pros and cons (?)~~  
* ~~Why Just Posting to Facebook Isn’t Enough. If you have a business page, your customers might not be seeing your posts. You need to promote your posts to make sure your customers see it. It’s a cheap way to get in front of your customers.~~  
* ~~Hate selling? You’re being selfish. (Ben Angel)~~  
  * ~~If you think selling is selfish, it implies that you think that what you’re selling doesn’t help people, or doesn’t help the people who buy.~~  
  * ~~Or you’ve bought into the mindset that marketing/selling~~  
  * ~~There’s something in people’s mindsets that selling is a selfish profession.~~  
* ~~Refuting this idea that if you build it, they will come. Build a better mousetrap, etc. That building a quality product is all the advertising/marketing you need.~~  
* ~~Know your audience~~  
  * ~~What language do they use?~~  
  * ~~What’s unique to their interests?~~  
  * ~~What are related interests? …~~   
  * ~~Get in their head~~  
* Brainstorms  
  * **\>\> Biggest problems people face with PPC/Advertising? (Or mistakes people make?)**  
    * If you think you’re going to do it in-house, here’s what you’ve got to watch out for…  
    * Make sure that you’re tracking conversions. Otherwise, you will pay for ads that don’t get you any calls.  
    * Make sure that you have compelling ad copy, emphasizing benefits (instead of features).  
    * Make sure there’s a clear call to action.  
    * Make sure that your staff is available to take calls whenever the ad is active.  
  * Build a community among your audience  
    * “Business as family” idea?  
  * **\>\>\> 4 Mistakes to Avoid When Buying Online Advertising**  
    * Assuming all ad campaigns are created equal. (The difference between ad campaigns can be astronomical.)  
    * Going with the first person you meet. (Just because you haven’t met the person who can help you doesn’t mean they don’t exist.)  
    * Going for the lowest price. (You need to evaluate cost per quality lead, or even cost per conversion...you can often actually lower your costs by spending more for skilled advertisers)  
    * Remaining committed to a suboptimal decision. (Or maybe “Close your eyes to new information and perspectives that you haven’t been aware of before.”) This is an issue of decision fatigue, and you might just want to get it over with, instead of doing the due diligence (or having your team do the due diligence) on what these people have to offer.

**Systems:**

* **~~(Matthias)~~** ~~Your business is only as effective as your systems. To be effective, systems must model what naturally happens in business, and they must continually be improved. The goal of systems is to get all the busywork out of the way so that people can do their job effectively.~~  
* ~~When you’re looking at your business, there are two ways to look at it. You can be IN the system, or you can work ON the system, but you can’t do both at the same time. You will never fix a system that you live in permanently.~~  
  * ~~This is why it’s important to step ‘outside’ of your business to look at it as a whole.~~  
  * ~~Review the systems:~~  
    * ~~How is your system for finding prospects working?~~  
    * ~~How is your system for converting leads into sales working?~~  
    * ~~How is your system for fulfilling these orders working?~~  
      * ~~This might include your payment processing and bookkeeping~~  
      * ~~This might include scheduling clients~~  
      * ~~This might include scheduling employee time~~  
      * ~~This might include phone-call reminders?~~  
    * ~~How is your system for getting feedback from customers?~~  
    * ~~How is your system for staying in touch with customers?~~  
* ~~How to find the places you lack systems:~~  
  * ~~Lots of decision-making on routine tasks~~  
  * ~~Lots of mistakes~~  
  * ~~Lots of repeat questions~~  
  * ~~Unclear who’s in charge (?)~~  
* ~~Building good org. charts:~~  
  * ~~Defining clear responsibilities, and empowering people to fulfill them~~  
  * ~~Make it clear who people are accountable too, and never have more than 5-7 people report to a single person.~~  
  * ~~This doesn’t mean building “silos” where people are independent, but it does mean making it clear what the expectations are and who is responsible for fulfilling them.~~  
* **~~(Matthias?)~~** ~~Examples of How You Can Use Business Solutions. For example, you could use the example of different ways we use the MYS AppHosting.~~  
  * ~~Tracking project workflow~~  
  * ~~Tracking project time/costs~~  
* **~~(Matthias?)~~** ~~Example of NHM Using It~~  
  * ~~Wonder what the cost was of replacing it with a person?~~  
* **~~(Matthias?)~~** ~~Business Metrics~~  
  * ~~The 80/20 says that not everything is equal. There are things you can eliminate to increase the average.~~  
  * ~~The gut sense only works well when starting a business. After that, it starts to lie.~~  
* Two Ways to Fight Fires  
  * Way 1-One-off apologies and fixes  
  * Way 2-Systematically fixing them so they don’t happen again  
  * Personal example of me repeatedly selecting the wrong option at checkout when purchasing a business listing. All of our systems are designed for a specific format, so I need to contact customer service for support to either access a different format or get a refund for the wrong purchase.  
  * Solution? Clearly delineate the steps to follow, then actually use that...and that problem will never occur again…  
  * It’s also actually EASIER for me, because I don’t have to spend time trying to think/remember which option to choose.

**Masterminds**

* ~~Your Friends Might Be Pulling You Down \-- You are the Average of the 5 people you associate with the most~~  
  * ~~Within a mastermind, because you are actively sharing insight with each other, you are all actively growing.~~  
  * ~~Thus, the average of the group keeps increasing, and you get to take the journey with them.~~  
* **~~(Matthias)~~** ~~Emotional Piece/Story \- Going it alone can be lonely...wrap up with the admonition to surround yourself with people who can help (and maybe soft pitch the mastermind?)~~  
* **~~(Matthias)~~** ~~The Smalltown Business Manifesto (?)-- The Mission behind Canon City \-- that the entrepreneur is the one who creates these possibilities, and that business is the perfect vehicle for the transformation that we desire in this town.~~  
* The importance of other people \-- Johari Window \-- you can’t see your own blind spots  
  * Transparency reduces what you see that others don’t see (hidden/private)  
  * Inviting feedback reduces what others see that you don’t see (blindspots)  
  * Both of these reduce the potential that’s hidden from yourself and others.  
* Why Collaborating Increases Wealth (Black Wallstreet)  
  * *Please fact-check this information.*  
  * Basic idea: because of discrimination, they were forced to do business with themselves. Became known as “black wallstreet”  
  * Burned down by hate crime.  
  * After the fact, someone did research and discovered that the dollar passed through the hands of every person 100 times.  
  * The reason is that every exchange of money *increases the wealth of both parties*. This may be a good time to include Daniel Lapin’s story of the vendor and the kitchen table.  
* You gain the greatest insights by being around people who are OUTSIDE your normal circle.  
  * We tend to “groupthink” and meld into the group we’re a part of.  
  * For example, see the basic concept in [http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-first-wife-explains-what-it-takes-to-become-a-billionaire-2015-4](http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-first-wife-explains-what-it-takes-to-become-a-billionaire-2015-4)  
  * Also see the basic concept of Richard Koch’s Superconnect \-- that your greatest insights actually lie at the fringes of your network  
* Alex Charfen \-- entrepreneurs need a high level of protection and support. But many of them don’t get that. In the words of Arlynn Miller (if we can use this quote), “Accountability is one of the best gifts that you can give yourself as a leader.”.  
  * To be effective and to do everything that you want to do, you *must* have the protection and support to keep moving forward/
