# **Beating Organizational Conflict Before It Eats Your Lunch**

Recently, a team member of a nonprofit admitted to me, “I don’t know how to interact with other people on my team.” As I began to probe into the team dynamics, I discovered different individuals with different abilities:

* One person excelled in improvising solutions to meet deadlines  
* One person excelled in dotting i’s and crossing t’s  
* One person excelled in aligning with the organization’s vision and mission

Despite the talent within the organization, they’d begun to experience challenges interacting with each other and moving the organization forward.

As I was listening to this story, I realized something that happens all too frequently in organizations of any size.

Conflict often centers around individuals' areas of strength.

It's not hard to see why.

## **The Two Types of Conflict**

When you have people who are excellent at what they do, they are almost ALWAYS operating at a level that's difficult for others to relate to.

And if you have a healthily diverse team, you'll have strengths and weaknesses that are at odds.

You'll have the visionary who's always arguing with the compliance and legal team.

You'll have the task-driven achiever who's always frustrated by the social butterflies who are making sure that everyone's taken care of.

And you can fill in the blanks for your organization.

It's important to realize that there are two types of conflict in this type of situation.

I've just described the NATURAL conflict of strong abilities interacting with each other. This has ONE kind of solution.

However, there's a second conflict that's less commonly talked about. It's the EMOTIONAL conflict of strong abilities interacting with each other.

That has a completely DIFFERENT type of solution.

Before we get into the solutions, I want to dig more deeply into the EMOTIONAL baggage people experience with their strengths.

## **The Question that Shows Your Talent**

Here's a little clue into being able to figure out someone's areas of strengths. Ask the simple little question:

"What did you get in trouble for the most as a kid?"

I can list of a whole list of things that got me in trouble as a kid:

* Finding a creative way around a rule--that actually aligned with INTENT but not the actual rule.  
* Finding creative uses for almost ANYTHING--seeing the possibility everywhere I looked.  
* Imagining new possibilities when I should have been in class listening to the teacher drone on about ancient history.

Today, I can see my creative, visionary, problem-solving drive.

I couldn't see that as a child.

As I got older, I started hearing comments like:

* "Why can't you just pay attention to the details?"  
* "Why can't you work on long, tedious projects?"  
* And my favorite: "You're moody."

Heh.

You want to know something?

All of those deficits are strengths that I utilize on a day-to-day basis in my leadership.

Fortunately, those comments no longer hold a sting. Not today, but they used to.

## **The Shame of Being Strong**

As I've watched people over the years, I've noticed that many of them carry a chip on their shoulder about their strengths.

They've had a boss that berated them for their behavior. Sometimes they simply experienced the silent crushing weight of working a job they weren't built for.

Sometimes they've had siblings (who were quite different from them\!) make insidious comments about their weaknesses. (And when you're a child, you don't realize that these comments come mostly from THEIR insecurities, not your own weaknesses.)

Sometimes it's a teacher who needs to enforce a certain curriculum requirement--and all you're aware of is your inability to reach the unattainable standard.

Sometimes it's the parent looking over your report card.

Oh, and if you do have a chance to step into the limelight of your strengths?

The jealous classmate whispers to their buddy across the row, finding something to nitpick to put you in your place.

The coworker who did NOT get the promotion starts to gaslight you and undermine your leadership.

What about children who had people TRY to help them to excel in their areas of genius...but never REALLY got to know them?

Now they're hyper skeptical of anyone who wants to help them find their area of genius, because they've been pigeon-hold and manipulated in the past.

That's just the beginning.

## **Let's Go Ahead and Redefine the Law of Attraction**

We've all heard the term the "law of attraction". Well, I'm going to borrow that term for a second and completely redefine it. (Sorry about that\!)

I'd like to simply use it to describe the way that:

* certain problems seem to be drawn to you.  
* you seem to be drawn to certain situations.  
* certain people seem to be drawn to you.  
* you seem to be drawn to certain people.

It's important to note a vital point. As long as you're in an unhealthy place, you'll attract unhealthy situations and people.

It's a pretty classic situation...

We've all seen those people who have this way of surrounding themselves with the worst possible people. When they step into a room, they immediately pick them out and start a conversation with them.

This is NOT what I'm talking about. And if you find yourself doing that, it's well worth taking the time to consider why you're doing it. Chances are (but not guaranteed) that this is a place where you need to get healthy. If you solve that first, all the rest of this will start making sense.

How about some real-life examples?

I regularly have people coming to me and describing a conflict on their team. I ask a few questions, quickly pull apart the situation, and explain to them why people are behaving the way they are. I tell them responsibilities they should start doing or should stop doing. They feel a weight lift off their shoulders.

Why do these people who are weighed down with responsibilities and team conflict come to me? Because I hold a SOLUTION. It's a clue into my strengths.

(The way you can tell, by the way, is if you start empathizing with them, it's NOT your area of strength. If you help them change their perspective or behavior, it probably is your strength.)

One of my friends is the most low-key person you could imagine. Not the type of person to get her feathers ruffled. You'd think she'd surround herself with a bunch of friends who share her low-key approach (and I'm sure she does have friends like that). However, you want to make a guess which people are most drawn to her?

It's the people who are most excitable, most likely to get sucked into drama.

When they are around her, she does NOT empathize or affirm their drama. Instead, she brings HER strength into the situation and helps them self-calm and regain perspective.

Another friend finds himself pulled into all kinds of conflict resolution. Once again, he doesn't get sucked in. He doesn't affirm the prevailing "victim thinking" that's prevalent in those situations. He listens to each perspective, he challenges people's perspectives, and he helps them get past their differences to work together.

Why?

Because his area of STRENGTH is as a peace-maker.

I could go on and on. But let's get back to the more important questions, which are:

* What's YOUR story?  
* Who are the people who are DRAWN to you?  
* Who are the people YOU are drawn to?

This requires thought. It requires intentionality. If I could challenge you to do one thing, it would be this: Take this paper, grab a pen, and set aside at least 10 minutes to list out answers to those questions. You'll find them tremendously revealing.

Oh by the way, lest you think this is some kind of therapy exercise or has no real impact on your goals...

I find that a LOT of people in the nonprofit sector have trouble saying no, and taking care of themselves.

Any idea why?

Maybe it's because to work in this sector, you HAVE to care about something greater than professional achievement. You're drawn to people or situations that need your help. You're loyal to a fault. You hate letting people down.

And guess what?

Those types of problems, situations, and people are DRAWN to you.

This is not just about feeling good about yourself or adding on layers of guilt. This is about understanding YOURSELF, freeing up your time so you can focus on what matters, and making sure that you help the people you really want and need to help.

And in case that’s not enough of an impact, let's take a look at multiplying this.

## **The Magnetic Force of Your Team**

Each of your team has the same bent.

Just this morning, while I was talking to one of my coaches about leadership style, I realized I've made a dramatic shift in my own leadership style.

We've all been in situations where we've been told to act a certain way, be a certain way, look a certain way.

My first employee was NOT the type of employee I needed at the time. He was hard-working and committed, but it just wasn't the right fit. He and I both spent a LOT of energy trying to fix it. Finally, we both realized it wasn't a good fit and he moved on. (It was actually a tough decision for him, because we'd set up such a great team culture.)

Since then, I've become increasingly aware of people's magnetic force. 

* The team member who can't help but notice typos and errors, or write up to-do lists to get things done.  
* The team member who can't help organizing things, prioritizing things, and telling people what to do.  
* The team member who can't help but talk to people and figure out ways to help them.  
* The team member who's 10 steps ahead of everyone else, thinking of the next thing.

We don't pretend to be perfect, which is exactly why we're always optimizing this and improving it.

One of the FASTEST ways to increase the productivity of your team is to rearrange them so they do what they can't help but do. Some of them will resist the change, because they can't imagine being in a place that's BETTER. Admittedly, sometimes you have to work through practical issues such as compensation.

However, if you're willing to do this, you'll be shocked at just how much an individual can truly produce. (You'll also be shocked at how much someone can love the things you so passionately hate.)

Sounds like a wonder world, right?

Not too fast\! Because as you start moving people into the proper place, things can start to move sideways.

## **Create a Great Environment and the Sparks Will Fly**

Remember what I said about two types of conflict? Anytime you've got two people with different strengths working on the same problem, you'll end up with conflict.

I'll let you in on a little secret.

Behind closed doors, my team and I fight sometimes.

Well, we don't exactly yell, hit, punch, call names, or throw ourselves on the floor in an all-out two-year-old temper tantrum.

But we do disagree.

Sometimes quite strongly.

And sometimes it gets VERY uncomfortable.

They'll dig in their heels because they see something that I'm missing. Other times, I'll call them out on something that they're missing.

You can feel the tension rising in the room. We all put our cards on the table. We look at the situation from each other's perspective, and we get to move forward more powerfully than before.

And I'm PROUD of how my team interacts. When they push back, they always address the issue, not the person. They do it respectfully, even if it's done forcefully. And they're grateful for feedback that makes them better (as am I).

I mean, hey--let's face it. I write their checks, so I get to call the shots at the end of the day. I can blow past them and do whatever I jolly well please. Who's to stop me?

But that's not why I have them on my team.

I've got them on the team because of their STRENGTHS, and because their strengths are DIFFERENT from mine.

That's why I invite conflict. However, this kind of conflict is only productive when you have one specific trait:

HUMILITY.

You have to have a culture where people can take lessons from each other, when they surrender their ego, when they genuinely want not merely what's best for themselves or best for the organization, but what's best for EVERYONE.

That's one of the most powerful keys in turning this kind of conflict into productive conflict.

However, sometimes you poke a stick into a hornet's nest and you discover that there's a whole lot more going on under the surface than you imagined.

## **From Conflict to Crisis**

Remember what I said about how my team addresses conflict?

They address the issue, not the person.

And remember what I said about people experiencing pain around their area of greatest strength?

That's where conflict gets messy.

Even though YOU can very intentionally address a specific issue, the OTHER person might not hear it like that.

If they've experienced shame over their areas of strength, they're much more likely to perceive your suggestions for improvement as:

* invalidating their worth as a person  
* disregarding all the things they're doing right  
* suggesting they're not good enough for the job  
* and hundreds of other ways (EXCEPT how you meant it)

In many cases, this prevents them from accepting the help or guidance they need because they're afraid of looking stupid or insufficient.

Let's jump back to the story at the beginning.

As I talked with this individual, we discussed two sides.

On the first side, we discussed the PRACTICAL aspects. Why the executive director behaved the way he or she did. Why the other team member's personality lent to certain communication style. And why all of that broke down the others' trust in this individual.

On the other side, we discussed the EMOTIONAL aspects. More likely than not, buried within the conflict were hurt feelings, misconceptions, and misunderstandings based NOT on the situation at hand but on situations each person had experienced in the past.

I'm convinced that building high performance teams relies not only on finding people with the skills and genius to do the work, but also on helping build healthy people.

Many leaders self-destruct because they're unwilling to address the issues of the heart that prevent them from reaching their leadership potential. It might not be trendy to talk about this in the productivity-driven world, but it's critical.

Next time, we'll take a deeper look into exactly HOW you build a culture that allows people to move past their challenges.

For now, I simply want you to start developing an AWARENESS that many people have experienced shame or pain around their areas of strength. When you realize this, you can begin to develop compassion (which is really a form of humility) to help them become all they were born to become.

And you can help your organization thrive in the process\!
