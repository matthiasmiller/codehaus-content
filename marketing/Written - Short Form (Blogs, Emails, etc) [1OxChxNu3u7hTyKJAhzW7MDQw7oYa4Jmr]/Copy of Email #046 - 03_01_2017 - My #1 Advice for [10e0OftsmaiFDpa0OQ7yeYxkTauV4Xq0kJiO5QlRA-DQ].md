* **My \#1 Advice for Beating Distractions**

**{{ subscriber.first\_name }}**,

My assistant Chris is a writer. That’s a big part of his job. (I’m even training him to do some copywriting for *MYS*).

As a writer, he knows well the struggle against distractions. Even if he turns his computer on airplane mode, the World Wide Web is just a few clicks away. From Facebook to text messages to YouTube to other writing projects, there’s a ton of interesting--maybe even important--things that call his name when he sits down to write.

But no matter how important those things maybe, they’re still distractions. If he’s writing, the most important thing for him to do is *write*. In that moment, nothing is more important.

So what’s my advice to Chris? (He’s the one who suggested writing about this, by the way.)

**Dedicate a specific timeslot to spend purely in *Intentional Focus*.**

Most of the pressure of our “to do” list ends up coming from the mental space it occupies--the nagging feeling of “I need to get it done.” 

Oftentimes, it’s actually not that complicated. It usually comes down to either delegating it to someone else or just plain getting it done.

It’s easy to let distractions rule your day instead of focusing on the core business-building activities. Unless you actively and intentionally focus on your high-value activity, it will take a back burner.

That’s a death sentence to your business.

Imagine if the Secretary of Defense spent most of his time planning speeches and attending parties and only a few hours everyday actually creating important defense strategies. The country would be in deep peril\!

I don’t want my business to be in deep peril\! So I’ve begun developing an important habit. I take an hour everyday to intentionally focus on whatever is most urgent or highest on my priority list.

Since the most important work is often difficult, I’ve found it’s *easy* to get stuck rearranging your desk, taking out the trash, checking your email… doing anything to avoid the important task at hand.

Yet the important task at hand is *important.*

Spending an hour in intentional focus is both exhausting and exhilarating. Although focusing on high-value work can “put you in the zone,” it can also use up a lot of mental and even physical energy.

So how do I actually make it work?

I’m not perfect yet. Like I hinted, I haven’t been consistent in it. But I’ve definitely learned many valuable (and practical) lessons along the way that have revolutionized my productivity during those focus hours.

But I’ll get into all of that--including the practical lessons I’ve learned--next week.

Until then...

Be the best you\!

**Highly valuable, Intentional Focus**  
Taking an hour or two to get done what you’ve been procrastinating

I’d like you, Matthias, to expound more on the 

1. value of doing this and   
2. maybe some of what you’ve learned through  
3. Some tips on how to do it well

Find a reasonable timeslot to focus specifically on it and just *get it done*\!

**Value**

* Most of the “weight” of things that we have to do ends up coming from the mental space that it occupies, the nagging thought that “I need to do it”. Oftentimes, we should either delegate, or do it.  
* Also, it’s easy to let distractions rule your day instead of focusing on the core business-building activities. Unless you actively and intentionally focus on your high-value activity, it will take a back burner.

**How to do it well**

* Set a time frame that works well. If you’re in your office, set an hour. Drink water and use the restroom before, so that you can stay at your desk. Do NOT get up until the hour is up.  
* If necessary, turn off your wireless and completely silence your cell phone.  
* Do it in the morning when your energy level is the highest. This is when it’s easiest to concentrate. If it’s more than 1 hour, do it early in the week when you’ve got the most mental energy after the weekend.  
* Be careful doing this just because something “needs to be done”. You may be better off delegating instead.  
* This world is wired for distraction. Eliminate reactivity as much as possible. Getting crystal-clear on what needs to be done and a realistic expectation when it can happen is key.

**What I’ve learned**:

* The most important work is often difficult, and it’s EASY to get stuck rearranging your desk, taking out the trash, checking your email...anything to avoid the important task at hand.  
* Spending an hour doing this is both EXHAUSTING and EXHILARATING. If you’re really focused on high-value work, you should find yourself slipping into the zone, but you’ll also find yourself spending a lot of mental and even physical energy doing it.
