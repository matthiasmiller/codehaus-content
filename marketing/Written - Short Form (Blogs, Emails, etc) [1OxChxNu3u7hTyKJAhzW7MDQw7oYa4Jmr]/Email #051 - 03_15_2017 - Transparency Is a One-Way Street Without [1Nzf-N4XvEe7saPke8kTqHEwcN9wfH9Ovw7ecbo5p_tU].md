Over the past several weeks we’ve talked about two dangers: *Blind Spots* and *Control Freaks*. Existing blind spots are liable to kill us; being control freaks are liable to destroy our teams.

The only way to avoid either pitfall is to become ***Lifelong Learners***.

I’ve already written about three ways we can be more transparent right away. (It’s the first step to rebuilding any relationship, vanquishing blind spots, and resisting the control freak).

This week, I’m inviting you to…

***Invite Feedback.***

Transparency is worthless if we’re not willing to learn from it.

Picture your life in two halves. One half represents everything everyone knows about you: your quirks, funny habits, and personality. The “Common Knowledge” stuff. The other half represents the stuff only *other* people know about you. These are the blind spots and since you can’t see them, they can be lethal.

That’s why it’s so important to be a Lifelong Learner and *invite feedback*. It’s like asking passengers in a car if they see any vehicles careening your way before you pull out on a busy highway. You ask because the passengers have a better perspective on the surroundings. They can see things you can’t.

There are many ways we can continually invite feedback from others, but today I’m only going to share two of my favorites.

**1\. Build a culture of informal honesty**

Here at *Multiply Your Strengths*, we’ve striven to create a culture where we can freely give honest feedback, even if unasked for. This is made possible because we all want to grow and see each other grow. However, it also presents several pitfalls we should be aware of.

Giving honest feedback can be painful for both the giver and the receiver. That’s why the first thing we must do is detach performance from value. Otherwise, we will take criticism personally and allow it to affect our self-worth. Second, honesty must include intentional feedback when we see positive growth, otherwise we’ll weary of criticism.

**2\. Assemble an intentional Circle of Lifelong Learners**

As important as informal feedback is, just having a few conversations at the water cooler won't get you the full way to your potential. The best way get to your fullest potential is to gather a group of trusted friends and mentors who can speak intentionally and decisively into your life. What they say may be hard to swallow at times--and you may choose at times to disregard it--but it’s the quickest and most effective way to grow.

Feedback is crucial to growing as a leader and entrepreneur. Transparency won’t work without feedback and feedback won’t work without transparency.

Like I said, feedback is also a very important part of the MYS tribe of *Lifelong Learners*. We’ve realized how much we need your feedback regarding these emails in order to make them best serve you\! Would you mind taking a few minutes to fill out our 2017 Reader’s Survey?

This will help us be the best “us” so that we can help you to...

Be the best you\!

Inviting Feedback

**2\. Inviting feedback is an invaluable tool as it helps you learn about yourself and come to terms with personal issues in ways you can’t on your own**
