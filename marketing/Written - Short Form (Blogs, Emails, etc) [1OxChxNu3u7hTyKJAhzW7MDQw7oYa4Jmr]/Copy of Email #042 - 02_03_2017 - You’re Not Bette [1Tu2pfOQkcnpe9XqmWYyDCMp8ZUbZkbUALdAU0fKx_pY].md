*“I suppose it’d been better if I’d never been born at all\!” George Bailey muttered.*

*“What’d you say?” the angel asked.*

*“I said I wish I’d never been born\!” George yelled.*

This conversation sparked one of the most memorable redemption stories in film history.

George Bailey, the protagonist of *It’s a Wonderful Life*, received his wish. He got to see the world as if he’d never been born.

From rescuing his kid brother who later saved hundred of lives in World War 2, to giving hope to a struggling friend, to saving the infamous *Building and Loan* which benefited the struggling poor in Bedford Falls--George Bailey had a profound impact on the world around him. An impact many people would’ve never felt had he never been born.

Last week I promised to begin breaking down the three reasons why your work matters, even if you can’t see it.

This week, I’m delivering on my promise and I want you to know…

**You’re probably not aware just how much you’re helping other people, *even now.***

George Bailey wasn’t extraordinary. He never went to college, he never made it big in business, and he barely even survived financially without his friends. All he did was live life from the goodness of his heart. 

You are George Bailey.

Unlike George, however, you haven’t had the privilege of seeing what the world would be like without you. You aren’t able to see just how radically you have transformed not only your local community but also the lives of people across the globe.

So when you’re in that place. When you’re dragging yourself out of bed, questioning whether your work makes any difference at all--remember the little things. 

Remember the energy that came to your customer's eyes as he realized you could provide the financial advice that will help him get out of twenty years worth of debt. Remember the steady income that you are providing for your employees. Never forget that simple cup of water you gave to the thirsty homeless man or the words of life you spoke into an aspiring entrepreneur. Remember, as Clarence wrote, “no man is a failure who has friends.”

And always remember to...

Be the best you\!
