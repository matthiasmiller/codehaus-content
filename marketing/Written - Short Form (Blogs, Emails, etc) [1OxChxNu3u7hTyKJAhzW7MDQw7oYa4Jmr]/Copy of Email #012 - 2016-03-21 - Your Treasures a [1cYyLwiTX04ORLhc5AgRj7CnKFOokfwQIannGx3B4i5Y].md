Most of your ideas are going to be bad. But that’s okay. 

Here’s why:

Brainstorming is like metal detecting. Most of what you dig up is worthless, but every now and then you find a treasure. If you refuse to dig up bad finds, you will never find exceptional ones.

In order to unearth good ideas, you must be willing to voice the bad (no matter how embarrassing you think it is). Sure, some of your ideas will be as exceptional as mud--digging for treasure is a dirty job, after all.

But the goal of brainstorming isn’t to find a hundred good ideas, but to find one exceptional idea that will take you far.

Your best ideas will only be found when you’re willing to dig up any idea--no matter how bad it may turn out. 

You must dig for the gold, but when you find it, it’s worth millions more than the dirt that surrounds it. However, you won’t find it on the surface. You have to dig for it\!

In order to find and refine the best ideas, be willing to invite feedback, criticize the idea, try it out, and maybe even fail. It’s the only way you’ll find and refine gold.  
   
Always remember, be the best you\!

P.S. What’s one crazy idea you’ve been kicking around? I’d love to hear it\!

# **80/20 Greatness**

So many times we think we should be able to get a great answer every time, but the truth of the matter with ideas is that 20% of them will be killer. So be free to share, to be criticized, to learn, and then trust that those 20% will really pay off.

	Explanation \--  
So the 80/20 rule says that 20% of your ideas will account for 80% of your success. Regardless of the numbers, it means that some ideas are really powerful, and be extension that a lot of your ideas will be (for lack of a better word) lame.

Regardless of the numbers, the concept still stands/

Part of the process of finding that one idea that yields high results, is being willing to “air” and “voice” all the other bad ideas (and maybe end up looking a little stupid) so that you can find the 1 good one

The goal of brainstorming, then, isn’t to find a 100 good ideas, but to find 1 exceptional one.
