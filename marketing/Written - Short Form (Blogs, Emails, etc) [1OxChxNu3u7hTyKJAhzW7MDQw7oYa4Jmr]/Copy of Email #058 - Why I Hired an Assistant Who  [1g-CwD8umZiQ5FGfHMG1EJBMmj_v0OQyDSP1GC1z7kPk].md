Most of the time, we attract people like ourselves. Doers attract doers, thinkers attract thinkers, and so on.

Here’s the ironic thing about entrepreneurship, though: it’s when you work together with people different from you that you can actually start ***multiplying*** your combined efforts. That’s when you create synergy.

It seems unnatural, but it’s true: the people most *unlike* you in your business are the ones who can often draw out your talents and multiply them. 

Let me cut past the business coach mumbojumbo: the hard truth is that we’re all just bad at some things and the sooner we accept that, the faster we can grow.

I’m a quick-start visionary who spends a lot of time in the clouds thinking about the big-picture and looking for the next goal to pursue. As hard as I try to pay attention to small, yet significant details, it will never be my strength. It’s hard to see the bumps on the road when you’re in the clouds.

That’s why I hired an assistant who loves details and crossing actions off lists.

We’re incredibly different, but together we accomplish way more than either of us could alone. 

*That’s* synergy.

As an entrepreneur, it’s absolutely *imperative* you stop doing things you’re bad at. If you’ve got any cash flow at all, it’s costing you money and focus to try to do it yourself. Even if you don’t have a cash flow, you’re likely losing money by missing better more profitable opportunities.

But it goes beyond just your team.

I tend to gravitate toward working with people who like to think big and create vision. However, that’s not where I usually produce the most *value*. Most times, I find myself providing the most value to people who are quite different from me.

That’s why I’m doing something special. I’m looking for a few people who:

1. Can’t wait to get up in the morning just to WORK\!  
2. Are really good at what they do  
3. Don’t like to sell or promote themselves  
4. As an optional bonus (but not a requirement), like facts and figures

Hint: those are people who are *very* different from me.

If that’s you, I’ve got a unique way I want to add value to you. I’m looking for a handful of people that I can advocate for. If you’re interested, you can [learn more here](http://multiplier.link/meet) \[insert: multiplier.link/meet\].

Until then, just remember...

Be the best you\!

There are people who love to implement. 

Approaching it from the angle of that there’s a… there’s a complimentary side to that. If you’re someone who’s really good at what you do...you’re offering a solid product, but your offering … we serve people like you.

Getting more perspective on how complimentary gifting spawns energy. Knowing what they’re good at, staying in their lane… value of partnering with someone whose strengths lie in a different angle.
