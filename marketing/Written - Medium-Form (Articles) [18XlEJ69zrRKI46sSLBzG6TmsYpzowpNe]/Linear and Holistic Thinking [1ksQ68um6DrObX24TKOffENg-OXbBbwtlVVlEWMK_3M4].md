# **Linear and Holistic Thinking**

Software developers typically fall into two camps.

The first kind of developers think very linearly. They are step-by-step thinkers. They think in terms of steps and sequence. They are fantastic at making sure that software is functionally correct--that is, that it actually does what it's supposed to do.

The second kind of developers think holistically. They think in terms of parts and relationships, not in step-by-step actions. They are fantastic at making sure that the software is cohesive. They make sure that all the parts of the software fit together.

Of these, I believe that the first kind of individual is more commonly attracted to software develoment. I frequently felt out of place beause, while I learned strong linear thought, I much prefered the holistic thinking. My colleagues often told me that my code was elegant. It had a poetry to it.

Each kind of developer has a corresponding weakness. A very linear thinker will get the job done, but it might not always be done in the most elegant way. A very holistic thinkiner will find an elegant, cohesive way to get things done, but they might miss the minute details in the process.

If you can pair these individuals together, you get a powerful combination. They can cover each other's blind spots. The best years of my software development career was working side-by-side with a linear-thinking developer. We frequently grabbed the keyboard away from each other when we saw the other making a mistake that fell in our blind spot.

How does this apply to business?

A linear thinker can quickly see and recognize tasks that need to be done. They are always pushing these things forward.

A holistic thinker can quickly see where specific tasks fit into the big picture. If they don't see a way to fit them into the big picture, they'll push until they see the connection.

You want a healthy balance of each.

Your linear thinkers will keep others from overthinking what needs to be done, and they'll just make sure it happens.

Your holistic thinkers will keep others from creating tangled messes by making sure that the business is well-designed from the inside-out.

If you are struggling with getting buried in the weeds, you should find a holistic thinker who can help you get out of the weeds, gain perspective, and see what you're missing.

If you are struggling with redesigning everything without getting anything done, you should find a linear thinker you can drive your project in a sequence of next steps.
