# **Before You Start**

## **Getting the Most from This Booklet**

The culture around us has given us a toxic perspective of time. The reason so many people struggle with their time is simply because they’ve embraced the *status quo* teachings. If you want better results, you need a better perspective.   
This booklet has two parts: the foundational mindset and practical habits. Both are vital. Ideas mean little without action, and actions mean little without the “why”.  
Before you get started, I want to make sure you get this most of this guide. This guide is deceptively short, and for a specific reason. I wanted this guide to be accessible. Rather than a hefty book to pore through, I wanted to give you something short you read, absorb, and later review.  
While you read this booklet, you will be tempted to say, “Oh, I already know that,” or, “That doesn’t really apply to me.” Please don’t assume that. Even though I’ve chosen to live my life by these principles, I continue to remind myself why I do what I do.  
I mean it honestly when I say these ideas have changed my life, and I fully expect they will change yours as well. You may be tempted to skip over certain ideas simply because they’re brief. However, I want to remind you that sometimes powerful ideas are expressed in only a few paragraphs.  
I highly encourage you to grab a pen or highlighter (and maybe a cup of coffee), and set aside some time to process this booklet. If you do that, you will set yourself up to get the most out of it.  
Once you’ve done that, carry on\!

# **Part 1: Laying the Foundation**

## **“Busy” Is Everywhere\!**

Do you ever wonder why “busy” shows up in so many conversations?  
Last night, I went to the local florist to pick up flowers and some fudge for my wife. The clerk fumbled with the paper and tried to start a conversation. “How was your day?” She paused momentarily. “Busy?”  
She could have asked me a hundred different questions. Yet she asks me one: “Were you busy?”  
I’m notoriously bad at small talk, so I answered with a simple “yes”. Behind my simple answer, however, my mind was doing gymnastics:

*If “busy” means being active and productive, then yes, I absolutely was busy\! However, if “busy” means being overcommitted, driven by other people’s demands, and stressed by the demands on me, I was definitely not busy. What do you mean by “busy”?*

For many, “busy” is a badge of honor. It proves to everyone that they’re productive, creative and successful. To say they’re not busy implies that they’re lazy, unproductive, and failing.  
For others, “busy” is a prison. It explains why they can’t do the things they want to do.  
The truth is we all have twenty-four hours in every day, and we spend every minute of every day doing *something*. Busyness is not about how much time we have, because we all have the same number of hours in every day. Busyness is about how we spend our time.  
Just talk with your employee. If he works until midnight to meet a deadline, he’s busy. If he comes home from a concert at 1:00 AM, he’s just enjoying life.

## **Busy Is the Symptom of a Disease**

Busyness is the symptom of an insidious disease that denies the choices we have.  I believe the feeling of being “busy” comes from the sense that *we are out of control* and that *we are living someone else’s agenda*.  
One of the most invigorating feelings is being able to spend your waking hours on your agenda, knowing that you’re doing the things that matter the most to you. You might still spend your day serving other people, responding to other people’s requests, fulfilling other’s obligations, or grinding through unpleasant tasks. However, when you’ve set your own agenda, these make you feel productive, not busy.  
We are all in control of our choices. Even the most challenging situation offers you the opportunity to embrace a perspective of control and empowerment. You have the power to recognize that even though parts of the situation are out of your control, you get to choose to face the challenge, to determine your own perspective, and make the most of the mess you’re in.  
The suffocating feeling of busyness is evidence of a belief that your life has drifted outside of your control. Shifting your perspective, recognizing the power you hold to change your situation, is the first step in breaking free.  
My wife and I believe so firmly in the importance of our perspective that we have practically removed the word “busy” from our vocabulary. It is not a denial of reality. Rather, it is a reinforcement of our personal beliefs that we have the power to choose how we spend our time, and that when we make poor decisions, we deal with the consequences.  
As a result, even though my wife and I are engaged in many different activities and both live a very “full” life, we would be hard-pressed to call ourselves “busy”.

## **Time Is a Silent Killer of Entrepreneurs**

Time seems to be the mysterious killer of many entrepreneurs. It seems many of them burn out before they reach their prime, somehow unable to meet the demands.  
They never reach the pinnacle of their career because their personal lives crumble under the weight of the expectations. If they somehow manage to stand up under the weight of the expectations, their effectiveness is hindered by their growing responsibilities.  
Let’s face it: it’s a tough road.  
Many entrepreneurs succeed because they are hyper-responsible, high-achieving individuals. They are willing to go the extra mile, to do the extra work required to get things done and make things happen.  
While this is a powerful strength, it can quickly turn into a debilitating weakness. This same drive introduces a subtle trap that snags them in its grip.  
The trap comes through a positive, empowering belief: “We can do that.” It is the same belief that empowers you, that gives you the choice to control your destiny. It comes through a belief that drives confidence and that provides surprising results to those who embrace it.  
This same belief, when overextended, denies an important reality. Whether as an individual, a team, or a business, you are incapable of responding to every opportunity that awaits you. This raises two important questions:

1. Exactly where are the bounds of your capacity?  
2. Exactly what needs to be within those bounds?

Unless you honestly answer those questions, the same work ethic that propelled you into financial success now threatens to keep you locked into this same level.  
If you’re not careful, it could even destroy you.

## **The Time Management Delusion**

Many people try to solve this challenge with better “time management”—cutting corners here and there to save a few minutes. You can learn many wonderful techniques that can literally save hours off your week. However, it can also lead you into a rabbit hole.  
Many people think of time management as the *speed at which you get things done*. If you walk a little bit faster to your truck, you can save a few minutes off your sales call. This focuses on “efficiency” by getting your tasks done more quickly.  
While these can be helpful tools, they often leave you feeling busier than before because you must always get more done in less time.  
You can get a much more dramatic shift by changing your focus. Rather than focus on the *speed at which you get things done*, you can focus instead on the *results you get for your effort.* This is a focus on “effectiveness”.  
Unless you are vastly inefficient, you will not get significantly better results by working faster. Instead, focusing on effectiveness introduces a new dimension to your approach, which is *leverage*.  
Effectiveness is about finding the one or two small factors that drive your success. These are high-leverage activities that require less effort and produce higher results.  
Let me warn you.  
If you’re not careful, you’ll disregard the importance of these few paragraphs. These aren’t philosophical ramblings.  
This one shift in perspective has brought the most significant change in my performance. Don’t let the simplicity of the idea fool you with its impact. If you’re thinking, “Oh, I understand that” or “I don’t need to know that”, I challenge you to jump back and reread the above paragraphs several times.  
Yes, it’s really that important, and here’s why.

## **Ain’t No Such Thing as Equality**

There ain’t no such thing as equality. The only equality you will ever encounter is the equality of human worth. Every single person has intrinsic worth and deserves to be treated with value and respect.  
Besides that, it doesn’t exist.  
In your business, not every idea, project, customer, or employee should be given the same amount of attention.  
The reason is simple: there’s no such thing as averages. It’s quite easy to see:

* Your best idea can easily be ten times better than your worst idea.  
* Your best project can easily be ten times more effective than your worst project.  
* Your best employee can easily be ten times more productive than your worst employee.  
* Your best customer can easily be ten times more profitable than your worst customer.

As business owners, it’s easy to believe that we must devote the same resources to each project and must invest equally in every employee. It’s easy to believe that every task on the “to do” list deserves the same amount of focus, intention, and commitment.  
It’s not true.  
While every single person has the same intrinsic worth and the same intrinsic potential for greatness, not every person brings the same value to your organization.  
Spend an hour a week with one employee, and they’ll become a strong leader in your organization. Spend an hour a day with another employee, and they’ll still cost your business money every time they show up at work.  
Spend a thousand dollars on one advertisement, and you’ll get two customers. Spend a thousand dollars on a different ad, and you’ll get twenty, two hundred, or two thousand.  
When you stop treating everything as equal, you start to approach life differently:

* Not every e-mail needs to be answered.  
* Not every phone call needs to be returned.  
* Not every project needs to see the light of day.  
* Not every request needs to be fulfilled.  
* Not every person needs one-on-one mentoring.

This is not about dropping your responsibilities, being careless, or overlooking your team.  
It is about taking a proactive response to your priorities as a leader.  
For you and your organization to reach the full potential, you have to dedicate your attention and energy to the parts of the business that ultimately matter. Anything outside of that is robbing your time and draining your energy, distracting you from your vision.

## **Darwin’s Insight into Time**

The answer to your constraints comes from an unlikely source, Charles Darwin, whose theory deals marvelously with your time constraints.  
It’s about the survival of the fittest.  
A lush ecosystem will never reveal to you the toughest and most enduring animals. However, harsh desert environments with limited food and resources will quickly reveal the forms of life with an unbreakable quality.  
As counterintuitive as it seems, more time and money do not always offer greater opportunity.  Narrowing your focus and tightening your constraints are sometimes the best tools in uncovering the greatest opportunity.  
In a world where all time and all resources are at your disposal, it makes little sense to measure the effectiveness of your actions. However, when your resources are limited, you are forced to strictly evaluate what part of your work is the most effective.  
The best solution for managing your time is not about extending your day for more time.  
It’s not about chasing after more resources.  
It’s about allowing only the fittest to survive.  
It’s about letting the bad ideas die.  
It’s about letting the best ideas take the lion’s share of your time.  
If you embrace your constraints, they will lead you down the path of your best work.

## **Turn Your “No” to a “Yes”**

To take Darwin’s theory a little further, your life is full of dinosaurs trying to eat each other’s lunch. The dinosaurs you feed will become bigger and stronger, eventually overtaking the other dinosaurs.  
If you say “yes” to everything, you’ll start squeezing out the things that matter to you. However, if you say “yes” to the right things, you’ll squeeze out the things that are only a distraction.   
When your mission is unclear and undetermined, you have no reason by which to turn down other people’s requests. However, when your life is compelled by a strong “yes”, it becomes easy to say “no” to other opportunities:

* If you have a strong “yes” to your family, you can turn down the job that requires you to leave them for days or weeks at a time.  
* If you have a strong “yes” to yourself, you can turn down the extra hours and responsibilities that prevent you from properly caring for yourself.  
* If you have a strong “yes” to your mission, you can easily say “no” to the requests that are distractions from where you need to be.  
* If you have a strong “yes” to your vision, you can easily say “no” to the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that continue to present themselves.

Again, the answer lies in a shift in perspective.  
The question is not whether you’re saying “no”. The question is, “Are you saying ‘no’ to the right things?” Are you unintentionally saying “no” to the things that ultimately are the most important to you, simply because you haven’t strengthened your “yes”?  
No man ever says to himself, “I’d like to wake up tomorrow morning twenty pounds overweight, feeling sluggish and burned out.” Nor does a woman ever say, “I’d like my kids to grow up feeling slighted because I never had enough time for them. I like my daughter to be a teenager before I start spending time getting to know her.”  
That’s not what happens. Instead, we tell ourselves, “I don’t want to let down my team, my business, or my friends. I need to do my part in making this a success.”  
Many leaders are more scared of saying “no” to their board, their boss, or their team than they are afraid of saying “no” to themselves, their family, and their personal vision. Every single “yes” that you give offers an implicit “no” to something else. The question is merely, “Are you saying ‘yes’ to the right things?”  
The *only way* to be able to say “no” without a shred of guilt is becoming crystal-clear on the things that are important to you. It’s impossible to feel guilty for saying “no” to something lesser, and saying “yes” to something greater.  
It’s hard to feel back for not answering an e-mail when you’re working on long-term objectives that will transform business growth. It’s hard to feel bad for not answering the phone when you’re in the middle of strategic mentoring with your successor.

## **Take a Vacation from the Guilt Trip**

You need to take permanent vacation from the guilt trip.  
Many people find it difficult to let go of their work without feeling some measure of guilt. Often, this comes from a deeply-rooted religious and cultural value for hard work. After all, “idle hands are the devil’s workshop.”  
If you’ve grown up with a Protestant work ethic, you’ve got a little voice in your head that says that the harder you work, the more pleased God will be with you. To make God proud, you must continue working harder and pushing yourself to our breaking point. It also tells us that helping others is the highest good, and that true selflessness is responding to the needs of everyone who asks of us.  
Meanwhile, the cultural voice says that the harder we work, the more valued and respected we become to our community. Those who are poor are lazy and were simply unwilling to do the hard work that was required. Then we must continue working harder, because if we don’t, we will lose everything that we’ve worked for.  
Though we may not verbalize these beliefs, they are embedded within much of the religious and cultural fabric of our day.  
That’s not to say hard work isn’t important, because it is. However, work was never meant to overtake our lives, and it was never meant to impose guilt upon us for being unwilling to sacrifice our lives to it. We were never meant to play the martyr for someone else’s crisis.  
Let go of the guilt. Now.

## **Live from the Big Picture**

Ironically, one of the best ways to break free from busyness is to deliberately step away from the activity.  
One of my most powerful practices is a morning ritual I hold. I’m an early riser, but I intentionally avoid waking up to work of any kind. I’ve learned that how I start my day determines the direction of the rest of my day.  
Every morning I stumble into the kitchen, get my wife’s coffee ready, and pour myself one or two huge glasses of water. As I rehydrate, it’s my chance to slow down time.  
This leads me into my time to pray, meditate, contemplate, revisit my vision, and refocus on where I want to go. I remind myself what I’m about and why I’m here. It’s my chance to check my mindset and my attitude.   
It seems that while I’m in the fog of waking up, I get to see my life most clearly and I get to see what’s truly most important. What started as a 15-minute routine has turned into an hour. That time is the turning point for my day. It determines the outcome of the rest of my day. It’s my chance to get the big picture and set the momentum for the rest of the day.  
If I don’t take that time, I easily fall victim to the tyrannies of busyness throughout the day. However, if I take those few minutes, I can focus my day on the things that truly matter and that truly bring results.

## **Permission Not to Be Busy**

In light of the cultural pressure towards busyness, you’re the only one who can give yourself pressure to break out of its grip, completely guilt-free.  
It’s time to take a vacation from the guilt trip.  
This is not permission to be lazy. This is not permission to ignore the people around you, or so somehow selfishly pursue your own best interests at others’ expense.  
It means relinquishing the guilt that overwhelms you when another person “needs” you or is in crisis without you. It means relinquishing the guilt behind the voice that says, “You need to be doing more. You have to keep pushing yourself relentlessly.”  
It means letting go of the fear of not having enough, not doing enough, and not being enough. It means letting go of the need to fit in, to follow the crowds wherever they may go.  
It’s about permission to be different, to break the *status quo* so that you can end up somewhere entirely different.  
This is about permission to become deliberate in choosing the opportunities that are right for you. It’s permission to say “no” to certain responsibilities and certain opportunities, so that you can become everything you were meant to be.  
It’s permission to pour yourself wholeheartedly into your work and your vision, knowing that it will continue you serve you, not enslave you.  
It means permission to spend a weekend with your family, no need for excuses and no need for guilt.  
It means permission to quit work when it’s time to quit, even when you have a thousand things that could yet be done.  
It means permission to approach life from a radically different perspective, measuring not by the work you put in, but the results you get back out.  
It is permission to live free from the bondage of busy to make the biggest impact you can on the world.

# **Part 2: Making It Practical**

Now that you understand the mindset, I’d like to share some of my personal habits. These are not theoretical ideals—these are habits I embrace because they bring tangible benefit to my life. They’ve helped me, and they will help you if you let them.

## **\#1. Don’t wake up to your phone.**

Most of us use our phones as alarm clocks, but it encourages us to wake up to our texts, emails, or (worse yet) news and social media. This is a fast track to a reactive mindset. When I sleep, I leave my phone in another room and wake up to a good, old-fashioned alarm clock. The difference in clarity is stunning.

## **\#2. Create a keystone habit to start off your day.**

For me, it means getting my wife’s coffee ready, then drinking a one or two massive glasses of water. This simple act sets me up for the rest of my morning routine. These small habits can cause a domino effect, creating a "muscle memory" for a healthy mindset and emotional place to approach your day. Athletes use these kinds of habits for reason\!

## **\#3. Don't work for the first hour in your day.**

Your time is way too precious to start your day off with work. The first hour of my day is literally the most important part. It's my time to reconnect with my vision and set the most important priorities for the day. It's also the time I get my most powerful ideas on how to move forward, which I’ll explain.

## **\#4. Journal with a real pen and real paper.**

We live in an electronic age, and we often forget how to slow down, become proactive, and focus on the things that matter. Journaling longhand has helped me do that.  
The simplest way to start is by writing one gratitude item every day. If you’re willing to take it further, spend time journaling about your challenges and potential solutions. Journaling is one of the best ways for me to get insights into challenges I face, or get ideas on how to move forward.  
I also write out my day’s priorities longhand. This forces me to think about my agenda, encourages me to be proactive, and it reinforces the agenda in my mind as I start my day.

## **\#5. Schedule your creative work early in the morning and early in the week.**

Your highest levels of creative energy are before lunch, particularly on Monday and Tuesday. Use that time to do your best, most creative work. This is the best time to focus on whatever provides the most value to your business. If you have meetings, save them until Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon.

## **\#6. Don't check e-mail before lunch.**

E-mail immediately puts you on somebody else's agenda and distracts you from the one or two most important things that you should focus on today. Unless your work demands it, you should probably check e-mail only once or twice a day.  
*To be perfectly honest, I have to admit that I don’t honor this 100%. However, I used to always start my work day by checking email, and I don’t do that anymore. Because of that, I’m able to spend my day focusing on the \#1 thing required to move things forward.*

## **\#7. Use focus@will.**

I have stretches of time when I need to be highly focused and at the top of my game. Whenever I need to get into a creative zone, I use focus@will. This service provides background music that's specifically mixed to help you focus without distracting you. (Yes, even most instrumental music is distracting to listen to.)  
While this doesn’t apply to every business owner, you might consider this for team members who work on intense, creative projects.

## **\#8. Put your phone on "Do Not Disturb".**

Just like e-mail, text messages and phone calls put you on someone else's agenda and distract you from the things that are most important. If you’re in a meeting or need to focus on a highly creative task, put your phone on “Do Not Disturb”.  
If your business requires you to take calls and respond to texts, hand your phone to your secretary or salesperson and teach them how to screen your calls. Maybe you need to consider hiring an assistant to screen your calls and schedule your work.

## **\#9. Exercise a minimum of 20 minutes every day.**

Yes, that’s a minimum. If your role demands you to be active, you’re might already doing that. However, you might also benefit from more.  
Exercise is a great way to stay energized, alert, and help manage the natural stress of life. I’ve tried exercising at different times of the day, and each has its benefits:

1. Exercising in the morning helps you wake up and get the day started.  
2. Exercising in the afternoon helps you push through the afternoon slump and reset your focus.  
3. Exercising in the evening (after work) allows you to disconnect from work and transition into “home life”.

The best time varies from person to person, and from season to season. Choose a time that works best for you, but make sure it happens. If you’re in this for the long haul, you owe it to yourself, your family, and even your business.

## **\#10. Get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep each night.**

Yes, you can laugh at me\! I understand that each person seems to need different amounts of sleep, but don't fool yourself into some kind of superhero who doesn't need sleep. You’ll make better decisions, and ironically, you’ll get more done. If you doubt me, rest assured that Brian Tracy makes the same recommendations for salespeople.  
Do this especially when you're doing creative work or have a lot on your mind. Getting enough sleep not only leaves your mind sharper the next morning, but it also helps you process and remember important things that happen to you. Your mind relies on your sleep to process all of the stimuli you get during the day.

## **\#11. Leave work behind on the evenings and weekends.**

Disconnecting from work is critical. Unless you have strong boundaries around your work, it will creep into the rest of your life. As difficult as it is, it's well worth the effort. The better you disconnect, the more effectively you will reconnect on Monday morning with fresh energy and fresh ideas to tackle another week.  
In fact, your best ideas will often come when you are specifically not thinking about your work.

## **\#12. Be fully present in the moment, with the person you're with.**

This is a simple but powerful habit.  
When you're with your friend, be fully present. Don't think about the next thing to say or the next thing to do. Just be there. When you're at work, don't be vacationing at the beach or snowboarding down the mountain. Just be there.  
Everywhere you go, be fully present and trust that being fully present in your current situation will not rob you of other opportunities.

## **\#13. Deliberately write down your “wins”.**

Have you ever tried to buy a vehicle that “almost nobody else drives”? The moment you leave the sales lot, you start seeing the car everywhere\! Our minds filter the world based on what we’re looking for.  
The same is true for your successes. When you begin to look for the things that are working for you, you’ll start *finding* more of them.  
Don’t review it in your head or type it into your computer. Use a pen and paper to write down the places in your life where you’ve moved forward, and you’ll start seeing more opportunities to move forward.

## **\#14. Start small, then keep experimenting and learning.**

Everyone’s different, so it doesn’t make sense to replicate what everyone else is doing. Learn from other people, experiment with what works for you, and decide which techniques work for you.  
Most importantly, don’t try to implement all these ideas. Start small. Pick the one that takes the least effort and will yield the greatest result.
