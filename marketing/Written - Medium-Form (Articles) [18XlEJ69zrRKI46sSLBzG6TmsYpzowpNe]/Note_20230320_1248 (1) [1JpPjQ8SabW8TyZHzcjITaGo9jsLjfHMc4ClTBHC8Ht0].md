| Speaker 1: | So here's another fascinating take on coding and business because refactoring is a natural part of the process. What makes refactoring be necessary? Well, it's the process of growth. It's a change of requirements, a change of direction. It's a continual cell scaling process. And it's absolutely critical to continue doing refactoring to make the code base as flexible and as nimble and useful as possible. And if you do not refactor, you end up with something that's called brittle code, which means that you'll try to make a change and all these other things will break because of that.  |

| Speaker 1: | So what do you do in the process of refactoring? Well, you look for commonalities. You look for things that have not been updated in a long time. You look for things that should be simplified. You look to clarify, to tease apart things that have... Those things used to be one thing and it grew into three things, but now you split it apart into three things. You move part A that had been under this umbrella into a different umbrella. You remove... Sometimes you completely redefined how something is done and you transition out of that way into the new way. And you delete old code that is no longer necessary because of all those changes and requirements.  |
| Speaker 1: | So in business it's like it's moving people from one place to another. It's scaling departments, it's building down departments, it's firing people, it's rearranging things, but ultimately, rearranging the components of the business to align where the business has grown to. Splitting apart responsibilities, people who are doing too many things at a time, and creating and reorganizing and restructuring that and getting the business into a healthier maintainable place. And if you don't do this, your business is going to break one way or the other. Code tends to break when you have refactoring. You have to do testing, you have to be careful, and you have to take these things piece by piece. But if you don't do it, then it'll break a different way, which means that you're going to hit some kind of growth plateau.  |
| Speaker 1: | And the same is true in business where if you don't take the time to refactor your business, you don't take time to restructure it, reorganize it, and get things off of people's plates and split positions, and all of those things, then you're going to encounter a different type of breakage, which is simply like your business will become brittle and will become resistant to growth. And you won't be able to grow or make those types of changes that you need to. So interesting perspective on refactoring as well.  |
