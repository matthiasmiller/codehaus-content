# **Low-Level vs. High-Level Language**

The first software languages were very simple. They basically had a series of step-by-step instructions with the ability to:

1. Read information  
2. Write information  
3. Modify information (i.e. do calculations)  
4. Jump to a different step

If you were to break down the process of a clerk entering information into a cash register, it might involve something like this:

1. Wait until a customer walks up  
2. Look at the customer, smile, and say "hello"  
3. Pick up an item off the counter.  
4. Run the item past the scanner.  
5. Put the item in the bag.  
6. Are there any items on the counter? If so, return to step 3\.  
7. Otherwise, press the "Total" button on the cash register.  
8. Announce the total to the customer.  
9. Wait for the customer to pay.  
10. If the customer pays in cash, enter the amount of cash in the cash register, then press "Paid".

Of course, you can get much more specific. You could spell out the details of: \- Where to turn your head \- What specifically to look for \- Which muscles to engage to use your hand to pick up an item \- Which muscles to engage to move the item closer to scanner \- How much force to use when pressing the buttons on the cash register

If we did that, we'd have an inordinately lengthy list of tasks. It would almost be impossible to comprehend all the pieces.

We might also expand this list with all of the possible exceptions: \- What happens if a customer walks up without any items? \- What if the scanner doesn't work for an item? \- How do you handle vegetables that need to be paid? \- What happens if the customer doesn't give you enough cash? \- What is the best order to scan and input items?

This in-depth list is the equivalent of the early methods of programming. It took many laborious instructions to achieve what you wanted to achieve.

With time, different individuals developed higher-level languages. In short, these languages identified common patterns. They condensed a dozen instructions down into one.

Today, we see the rise of low-code and no-code solutions. These solutions take thousands (maybe even millions) of instructions and turn them in a small handful of instructions.

How does this apply to business?

The seniority of a person is in their ability to be able to describe and understand a very complex task in a simple sentence.

If you have an experienced marketer, you can tell them that you need to launch a new marketing campaign. They immediately know that it will require hundreds of specific action steps to make that happen.

If you give the same instruction to an inexperienced marketer, they will be unable to complete your request. They'll be completely lost.

This means that your level of detail must match the level of experience. If you have highly inexperienced team members, the best way to work with them is through tactical delegation. You have to guide them through the step-by-step instructions of everything that needs to be done.

If you give this level of detail to a senior marketer, they'll be bored to tears (or outright insulted).

Second of all, you need to be able to find the common building blocks in what you do. The reason we can effectively tell people how to do something is because we have some basically terminology that encapsulates many actions. For example:

* Run  
* Walk  
* Shout  
* Whisper

The more that you can identify those components in your business, the more quickly you'll be able to train people on the most common pieces. This will make your training process easier.

In fact, an exercise you should do right now is try to identify the most common patterns that are in play in your business. YOu are almost certainly missing training and delegation opportunities because you do not recognize the repeated patterns.
