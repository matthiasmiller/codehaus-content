Part I - The Systems Perspective

The Lens for This Training
Your business is a system
If it’s about a system, it’s about your business.


What Are Systems?
Every system has three STEPS:
External Input
Internal Transformation
External Output


What Are Systems?
Every system has three COMPONENTS:
External Input
Information
Actions
Internal Transformation
Information
Choices
Actions
External Output

The Myth of the Operating Manual
Building effective systems is more than step-by-step instructions.
Good Developers think step-by-step
Great Designers see all the parts and how they interact
See Also:
Why You Can’t Scale When Working in the Business


Great Systems Simplify the Step-by-Step
Creating automation with Zapier involves:
Answering simple prompts to connect your accounts
using plugins written in easy-to-learn languages like JavaScript or Python
which are languages written in a harder-to-learn language called C
which gets translated to impossible-to-understand “machine code” (1’s and 0’s)
All systems create leverage to make a lot of work easily executed.

Great Systems Contain More Systems
When you get a computer, you have:
An operating system (Mac or Windows)
That runs software suites (like Microsoft Office)
That has individual software (like Microsoft Word)
That has individual modules (like Spell Check)
That has individual features (like word highlighting)
That has specific functions (like checking a word’s spelling)
That has code that is further broken down into sets of instructions
Which led me to… 

Great Systems Interact Outside Itself
Systems are only meaningful when they interact outside themselves.
See:
Godel’s theorem
Businesses in the market
Etc


The Underlying Structure of Systems
All systems have an underlying structure. It’s in:
Org Charts
Computer Files & Folders
Website Navigation
Continents, Nations, States/Provinces, Counties, Cities, Postal Routes
McDonald’s Drive Throughs
And more. What is that structure?

Trees Are the Language of Systems

Overloaded Systems Want to Divide
All growth halts without division.
For example:
Tree branches
Overworked staff
Stagnant/flooded market

Growing by Dividing
All tasks/roles start as:
A series of steps
That continue to grow
You recognize the natural divisions
You split them into roles
Each part continues to grow
This is biology. This is systems. This is organizations.
Thus:
Delegate the most overworked part of the system.

Growth Fault Lines
Three places where delegation breaks down:
NO ACTION - so there’s nothing actually to delegate
NO PATTERN RECOGNITION - 
NO DELEGATION

Systems Are Fractal




Systems Are Inherently 80/20
Systems are inherently 80/20.
They follow the rules of Stable vs. Unstable Systems (90/10 vs. 70/30)
They follow a variant of the power curve.

Overview Questions
Questions?

Communication
Every piece of communication is on a scale:
Broadcast communication
Targeted communication

Communication Bandwidth
Every system has a maximum bandwidth for communication.

Broadcast Communication
Low friction, low quality, high bandwidth
Communication attempts to continue, regardless of available bandwidth
Requires end users to filter out what is relevant to them
Gets lost when it exceeds the maximum bandwidth
Either filtered/prioritized by the user (radio) or by the medium (Facebook)
Examples:
Lost emails
Social media


Targeted Communication
High friction, high quality, low bandwidth
Communication slows based on available bandwidth (“Can I get a meeting?”)
More easily prioritized for essential vs non-essential communication
Examples:
In-person meetings
Some kinds of email / postal mail


Interaction
Broadcast communication will slow down targeted communication

Problem with Email
Email combines BROADCAST and TARGETED communication.
Your first rule of business is to DIVIDE these apart.
Your second rule of business is to DIVIDE those even further

Radio Silence
The difference in broadcast and targeted communication is why:
You can email a dozen people, get no responses, but have almost everyone sign up if you text them directly
You should specifically call out ONE bystander if you need help in an emergency

Internal vs External Communication
Every healthy system has two areas of communication:
INTERNAL communication
EXTERNAL communication
Examples:
Everything that happens inside a department vs outside
Everything that happens inside a business vs. what the customer experiences


Complexity by Communication
The Complexity of a system is proportional to:
NUMBER of people you communicate with
TIMES you need to communicate with them
TYPES of communications you have with them



Simplified Systems
A simplified system removes as much external communication as possible, without compromising the utility of the system.

Source of Truth
Two competing but important realities
Healthy systems require a single source of truth
Healthy systems require redundancy

Communication Questions
Questions?

System-Based Decision-Making
Non-intelligent systems are ONLY designed for anticipated events.
Systems become overbearing when they universally apply decision-making to inappropriate situations.
For example:
Only send recurring invoices over $X
Pre-approved all refunds under certain conditions



Questions to Ask
The decision-making process involves questions such as:
What are BOUNDARIES that we need to enforce here?
What is too much?
What is too little?
What is too frequent?
What is too infrequent?
What are the POSSIBLE SCENARIOS that could happen?
What should happen in the EXCEPTION CASE?


System-Based Execution
System-based execution is for predictable, repeatable actions
It must be able to be clearly defined
It can be based on:
Machine automation
Human automation

80/20 Email Mindset
Remember that:
Email is a COMMUNICATION tool
It is NOT a PROJECT MANAGEMENT tool
Because of that, things are ordered by:
Recency/Urgency
vs. Priority


80/20 Email Management
Wherever possible, automatically Filter Into:
Unpaid Invoices
Receipts
Subscriptions/Read Daily
Subscriptions/Read Weekly
Subscriptions/Read Monthly
Categories:
Personal Review
Unsubscribe everything possible. Periodically unsubscribe from week/monthly.

80/20 Email Filtering
Add filters for individual subscriptions that match on the address / unsubscribe text, then puts them into the right subscription folder
Add filters for partners, team members, and the most important clients


80/20 Email Triage
Three questions to ask:
Is this Informational or Actionable?
Do I have enough information?
Is this a current priority?


80/20 Email Q&A
Questions?

Where to Start?
Two questions:
Where do you start?
What do you do?

Time X-Ray
Our Time X-Ray process walks you through your activities and shows you:
