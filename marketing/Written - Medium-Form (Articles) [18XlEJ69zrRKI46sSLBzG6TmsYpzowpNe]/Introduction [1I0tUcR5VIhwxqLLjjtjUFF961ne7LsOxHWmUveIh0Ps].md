# **Introduction**

I've been intrigued by systems as long as I can remember.

When I was five years old, I knelt by a shelf in the lunchroom of my parents' bulk food store. I had a pen and a blank 8.5x11" paper.

On it, I sketched out a sandwich-making machine. It even had a special arm for people who wanted mustard on their sandwhich.

I remember the pride of showing it to my childhood hero Arlyn, thinking about all the work it would save. I imagined using it for a restaurant someday.

By the time I was nine years old, I was writing software code. It started with silly programs, like a police radar detector and a Winnie-the-Pooh text editor. However, by the time I was 13, I had written my first instant messenger to help a deaf software developer communicate with the rest of his team.

I mastered the craft of software development, and I become one of the top developers at the company. Then, I hit a wall.

Bored, frusrated, and restless, I began hunting for the next step.

I became an executive assistant at a non-profit, sitting in senior leadership meetings. And then, a few years later, dove headfirst into business.

Even though my father owned a retail business, I knew that would never work for me. It spent nearly ten years going deep down the depths of business--sales, marketing, and operations. My brother and I started a business to build custom software for small businesses. I discovered I had a unique superpower of understanding the workflow and designing custom software to help the business track profitability and become more efficient.

Most recently, my focus has shifted from mere software systems, to the business systems themselves.

All my life, I've lived and breathed systems.

This book is an invitation in my mind

On Thursday, June 2, 2022, my friend Ricky asked me a simple question about my work. In that one-hour lunch conversation, I realized just how deeply this had affected me.

I spent an entire hour after that conversation recording my thoughts on an audio transcription.

Here's my short goal: \- Explain basic principles in software development to business people \- Show how these basic principles can practically improve your leadership
