| :---- | :---- |
| Matthias: | Hey, Mike.  |
| Speaker 2: | Hey. Ready to get going?  |
| Matthias: | Yep. Ready to get going. Well, it looks like-  |
| Speaker 2: | I'm glad you're recording. That was one thing I was going to ask you to make sure you do it. Don't want to lose anything.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah. Yep. Turned it on automatically because I didn't want to lose it. Hey, Justin.  |
| Speaker 1: | Hey, how you doing?  |
| Matthias: | Good, how are you?  |
| Speaker 2: | Hi, JJ.  |
| Speaker 1: | Good. How you doing, Mike?  |
| Speaker 2: | Good.  |
| Speaker 3: | Hey Jay. Hey, Jonathan  |
| Speaker 1: | Hey there.  |
| Matthias: | Hi, Kelly.  |
| Speaker 4: | Hey.  |
| Matthias: | We're going to probably give folks just about another minute or so to hop on before we really dive in. I know I sent this question by email, but if any of you have particular things, I know there's kind of this, hey, we're not sure exactly what we're in for, but we think it's going to be good aspect to it. But if you have something specific that you're like, this would absolutely be worth my while. I would love to have you share verbally or drop it in the chat or something like that. So that'd be fantastic. Welcome, Mark. All right, so we're going to go ahead and jump in. There were a bunch of people who said that they were going to be able to make it, but we'll see whether or not they hop on. So without further ado... Cool  |
|  | Let me pull this up. So today we're going into delegation systems and the email deep dive, and hopefully this will be a pretty interactive time. Feel free to jump in and interrupt, and I'll try to keep my eye open on the chat and all of those good things. I wanted to just start a little bit with the inspiration before this. First of all, if you do have specific things that you want out of this, it would be tremendously helpful for you to say, "Hey, I really want X or Y. There's some of the things that came through in some of the messages." And also, once again, feel free to jump in with some conversations or with questions as we go.  |
|  | So I committed to doing this, and this is one of those put together this parachute on the way down. And week and a half ago, I had a conversation with a friend of mine over lunch, who was like, "So what it is it that you actually do?" And I really want to understand why some websites scale and some websites don't, and why is it so expensive to have millions and millions of video views, et cetera, et cetera. And it uncovered this whole line of thinking, and I realized that there's been this whole way of thinking about the world and thinking about processing systems that's been deeply innate. And that conversation really helped to bubble a lot of those things up to the surface. And I say it, innate not strictly because somehow I was born with it, but because, well, we'll get to that in a moment.  |
|  | The email actually originated from, it's kind of a deep dive that I've been doing around what is my artistic selling proposition? And I realize that I'm in this kind of strange place where I think systems are actually part of my art that I create, and it's part of what I invent. My first invention was as a four-year-old, which I did not actually create, but as a four-year-old, I sketched out this sandwich making machine, and I just thought about how much easier and better the world would be if we could all automatically make sandwiches without any kind of labor or any involvement like that, and how amazing it would be for the restaurant and all of those types of things. So from a really young age, I was always kind of looking to get out of work and to do less and just a bit of hopefully productive laziness that set in early on.  |
|  | Along the way, I've been working with my brother and I have been developing custom... Well, let me take one step back from that. My background is in software development, wrote software to help banks, insurance companies manage bond investments and was part of a major initiative to take a Windows only product and make it natively available on the web, allowing the windows and web platforms to interact and also do this whole thing without breaking anything. Massive undertaking, but it's positioned the company now to put themselves smack dab in the middle of a fantastic network. As a result of that work. I've been working with my brother to take some of these same software billing skills and apply them to businesses where we basically take a look at business process and we build custom software around the business process to help streamline it. So from age eight, when I first started programming, and throughout most of my career, I've been living and breathing systems and systems have become deeply ingrained within me and how I think and how I operate.  |
|  | There are a variety of reasons for that, but all of these forces have combined and I've realized that this has gone way deeper than what I've actually realized at first. So that's the precursor in context. So where do we want to go today? There's two things that I want to unpack. The first is just the systems' perspective, which is how do you look at the world from a systems' perspective and have something that is deeply visceral where you look at something and you can see the system that's at play, you can see the system that should be at play, you can see where the bottlenecks are, where the issues are, the challenges, et cetera. And this is that massive brain explosion that I had a week and a half ago after going out to lunch with my friend.  |
|  | And the second part of this, and this is just assembling that body of knowledge into a single cohesive unit. In the second half I'm going to go into more of a practicum, how do you actually apply this? Or what are the actual tools, examples, all of those parts? As well as how to kickstart this whole process and taking whatever time for Q and A. So part one, systems perspective. I think one of the things that's really helpful to understand is that this is coming from the perspective of your business being a system. And if it's about a system, it's about your business. So in this first section, I'll be talking more broadly about systems, but if you have this kind of secondary line of thought, thinking about your business and how these things apply, I think you'll get some helpful insights along the way.  |
|  | I think if you boil down a system to its three basic steps, there is some kind of external input, there's some kind of internal transformation, and there's some kind of external output. Now, this can be as simple as a fulcrum where you put your foot on a board, and that's the external input. The fulcrum provides the transformation and it lifts something really heavy on the other end, and that's the external output. Now, this also applies to business. There's some kind of external input. There is a customer who shows up, they provide you with some kind of input, financial, plus informational, plus all of that. There's some kind of internal transformation and you provide some kind of value or some kind of output on the backside of this. When you're sitting at a coffee shop, customer walks in, they place an order, that's an external input, and there's the process of making the coffee, and then there's the process of delivering it.  |
|  | The process of making the coffee is the internal transformation. The process of delivering it is the external output. So within these pieces, there are three primary components that I see. There's the information that's involved, there's the choices that are made, and then there are the actions that are made. And borrowing the famous kind of tactical triangle perspective, these are the three components that are deeply entwined within a system. So you can't have any meaningful system without information that's being processed. It's not really a meaningful system without some kind of... Well, I guess there are meaningful systems without decision making, but within the context of what we're looking at here, decision making becomes part of it in the actual execution. So you have external input is information, or in some cases energy coming in. There is a internal transformation where there is a series of decisions and choices that are made to provide some kind of action, which provides external output back out to back to the person. Any kind of questions or feedback or anything on that piece of it?  |
|  | All right, so I want to talk to you. So in this whole process, I came to understand that I looked at systems from a different perspective than some of my peers did when I was doing software development. And this is the myth of the operating manual. I think building effective systems is more than building some kind of step-by-step instructions or some kind of operating manual, because if I observe good developers across a scope, good developers think in linear, step-by-step fashion. Like, what are the tasks that need to be executed in order in to make something happen? But great designers see all the parts and they see how they interact. And I think that's the difference between this tactical perspective and this systems perspective. And I think this is also one of the reasons why it's difficult to scale when you're working in the business, because when you're in the business, you're focused on the step-by-step tasks that need to be executed.  |
|  | You're thinking very linearly. And when you step back from the business, it gives you the opportunity to look at pieces in relation to the whole. It allows you to see how they interact. Yes, I will be happy to provide the slides \[inaudible\] with the recording. So what are some traits of great systems? Great systems simplify the step by step process. So one of the places this becomes super clear is in software, these layers of instruction that are very granular. Down at the bottom, you have the ones and zeros, and then there are languages that are really complicated, but make it a little easier and then less complicated and even more easier. And then there's apps that hide all the programming practically from you.  |
|  | So Zapier's a great example. You can enter some simple prompts to connect all your accounts, super simple, but there's layers upon layers underneath that because underneath the prompt, there are plugins that use the easier to learn languages like JavaScript or Python. And JavaScript and Python is predominantly implemented in a harder to learn language called C, and C gets translated into this impossible to understand machine code, which is essentially the ones and zeros to make it all work.  |
|  | This is not that dissimilar from how a business operates because when somebody comes to you and they say, "Hey, I want a..." If you walk into a coffee shop and say, "I want a caramel macchiato and I would like it decaf, and with this kind of milk." There's a certain set of steps that are hidden from you that the barista goes and implements. So that one simple instruction just ballooned into one to two dozen different steps of what actually needed, or half a dozen steps maybe, of things that need to be done in order to provide your coffee, and this is how... So every great series of systems hide and simplify the step-by-step process. And by doing so, they create leverage to make work more easily executed. Now this line of thinking also applies when you're working with different levels of, say, a corporate ladder or different organizational hierarchy where the people at the bottom of the tree are working very on a much more tactical, task driven basis.  |
|  | But as you go up the tree, there's higher level instructions and higher level initiatives that encapsulate a lot of effort and a very small amount of space. I think it's also helpful to understand that great systems contain more systems. Again, computers using computers as a great example. If you're running an operating system like Mac or Windows, then there are software suites like Microsoft Office that has have individual programs within that, such as Microsoft Word, which have individual modules like spell check with individual features like word highlighting, with specific functions like checking a word spelling and literally putting the highlight underneath it. And each of those is code that is broken down further and further into sets of instructions. We see this within a business. The whole business is a system, but the marketing department is a system. And within the marketing department, the Google AdWords and Facebook are systems.  |
|  | And within the delivery process, there's all of these systems that are all at play. And not only that, the business itself is part of a bigger system, which is called the economy, which is called the the local economy, the national economy, the global economy. So systems relate with systems and it means that systems are only meaningful if they interact outside of themselves. So there's Ethereum that says that there's no... Sorry, I should have gotten this, but in essence, systems need context outside of themselves for them to be truly meaningful. And as I mentioned just now, an example is businesses within the greater market.  |
|  | Now there's an underlying structure to systems, which means that if you can start to recognize the underlying structure, you can start to identify where systems are at play. You see it in org charts, you see it in your computer files and folders. You see it in website navigation, you see it in continents, nations, states of province, counties, cities, postal routes. You see it in McDonald's drive-thrus and more, what is that structure? And trees, I believe, are the language of systems, which makes sense when you flip them, well, there's the global system, but if you flip them on it's head, then you have an org chart and this whole concept that you have, you have some kind of node, some kind of piece, some bigger whole that is divided into smaller parts, which is divided into smaller parts or some kind of one thing that's responsible for more things, which are responsible for more things. That is the foundational structure of systems.  |
|  | And when you're able to recognize, when you're able to look at the work that you do from that perspective, when you're able to look at your business from that perspective, when you're able to look at any number of things from that perspective, I think that starts giving you the framework to see and recognize systems where they exist, yeah, where they're at. There's this rule that overloaded systems want to divide. And if you try to grow a system past its capacity, it gets to an inordinate amount of complexity. It will stall, it break, and it will begin to lose its function until you divide it and give it the freedom to subdivide and continue to grow.  |
|  | If you look at a branch, as a branch grows, it will continue to grow. It'll sprout new branches, new branches, new branches, et cetera. You see this with overworked staff that if you take somebody and you run them at 110% capacity, there's going to become a time at which they're going to crumble, they're going to stop performing, they're going to break down, they're going to, fill in the blank. And what they want to do is they want to divide their responsibilities in one or more parts so that the responsibilities and the work achieved can actually continue to grow. We see the same thing within a stagnant or a flooded market. So if you have a market that's saturated, that's completely flooded, it's an invitation for fragmentation, for division, which leads to growth.  |
|  | Somebody comes in, carves off a segment of the market, does whatever they want to do, and suddenly instead of just one market, there's two markets or more. We see this in terms of responsibilities. So all tasks and roles that grow start as just a series of steps, these things that are doing. And as they grow and grow and grow and grow, you reach this point where there's this breaking point and then you get to evaluate and say, "Well, what are the big categories of things that are happening as part of this role or these responsibilities?" And it allows you to carve off those pieces and then allow those individual parts to continue to naturally grow.  |
|  | It's biology, it's systems, it's organizations, it's I think, pretty much natural law. And there's an implication of this, which I don't know if we'll touch on later, but we can touch on now, which is one of the most useful ways and useful places to delegate immediately is finding the most overloaded part of your system and looking at where those natural dividing points are and delegating out of that particular spot. And so along with that, there are fault lines that you... Here. Live on the fly as promised. So what are things that cause growth to stall out? Actually, I was going to skip this slide, but since we're here, what are things that cause it to fail? If you don't have any kind of action, it's impossible to systematize and grow. If you're not able to recognize the patterns of the work that's being done, you're not able to break those pieces apart. And certainly if you can't delegate and spin those off, then you're stuck.  |
|  | So systems are like trees and systems are also fractal, which I mentioned earlier. There're systems within systems and systems have systems and you can zoom in very closely into a system and you can zoom out very macro level in a system. Becomes a very useful way of looking at the world. Sorry. So as a result of that, as I was working on this on Friday, I realized that most of my work in systems and my best work in systems has always been related to tree structures and it's always had this 80/20 element to it.  |
|  | And so I think systems are inherently 80/20 or inherently follow the Pareto principle. I think they follow the rules of stable versus unstable systems, which mean means that when they top like a 90/10 ratio, they become unstable and I think they follow the very end of the power curve. So this sent me down the rabbit hole, which said, I believe there's a whole set of math that's related to systems and management. And there is. So there's a whole set of questions that because organizations are tree structures, because they're fractal and because they apply the 80/20 principle, there's a whole set of questions that you can ask that can give you perspective as far as scalability, margin, expansion of workload, tying back into scalability, stability based on management efficiency and labor overhead, or how many management layers you need to support a certain level of work output.  |
|  | So I put together this little tool. If you have an organization of 100 people and you have two levels of management. In this particular case, we're using a formula with approximation, but it requires approximately 10 direct reports per management position, which is the very upper end of where you might want it to be. So we have 100 people, 11 of which are in management, and 89 of which, this is assuming an equal distribution across the entire organization, 89 workers. The management structure has 88/12 efficiency.  |
|  | If you increase the organization size to 120, you increase to an average of 11 direct reports and you start entering these upper bounds of the ratio between the work that's being done and the management that's required to actually get the work done increases. If you want to have, let's say you have two levels of management and you are willing to go up to an average number of eight direct reports, that allows you to scale up to a structure that has 73 people, including 64 people who are workers, 12% management overhead, and 88% going towards the work that's actually being done.Interesting questions to go down that management rabbit trail. Any questions from any of that so far? Cool.  |
|  | So way back when we took a look at the different components we took a look at, there were three components that I had in the triangle. One was communication, one was decision making, and one was action. I think one of the things that's really helpful to understand in terms of systems is that there are two kinds of communication that lie on a scale. One is broadcast communication and what is targeted communication.  |
|  | And I think it's important to realize that these two types of communication happen very differently. Great idea, Kelly. And you can access that tool. So with that, you have to understand that any communication system has a maximum bandwidth of communication. There is a volume, whether it's because of the person who's on the other end, whether it's because of, for whatever reason, there's an issue of maximum bandwidth. So broadcast communication is a one to many, broadly broadcast targeted communication is one-to-one higher friction. So take a look at broadcast communication. It's low friction, lower quality, and high bandwidth. So you can communicate a high volume of information in a very short amount of time, but communication works differently when you've maxed out the bandwidth.  |
|  | Communication attempts continue regardless of available bandwidth. So even if you've maxed out the bandwidth, there's still an attempt to continue to communicate and it requires end users to filter out what is relevant to them, and if it exceeds the maximum bandwidth, either you have to, I mean, sometimes you can recognize it on the broadcasting side and you can choose what you actually actually put out or just straight up this communication gets lost. A great example is all the times when you're sitting on a Zoom call and somebody makes a comment about needing to go reset the routers so that they kick off their teenage kid off the games so that they can get their bandwidth back.  |
|  | I mean, this is a case where there's this overload of communication, predominantly in this case, broadcast communication that is using up the bandwidth and causing data to be lost, signals to be dropped. So it can either be filtered or prioritized by the user. A good example is radio where you get to tune into the station, but even with that there's limited bandwidth. You can only listen to one radio station at a time or it's by the medium. So we all remember the days of Facebook when you could see everybody's posts and all these things, and people have gotten used to this by now, but we also remember all the arguments about how Facebook was evil and they're now hiding people's posts and et cetera, et cetera.  |
|  | Well, in reality, Facebook had reached its maximum capacity on broadcast communication and there was no more capacity. And so they took it into their hands and said, "Hey, we're going to filter and prioritize what is being communicated to benefit us, rather than just allowing these choices to be made randomly based on chance." Another example is lost emails, and we'll get to this in a little bit, but the reasons why people's emails get lost is because there's this noise of broadcast communication.  |
|  | Targeted communication is very different. It's high friction, it's high quality and it's low bandwidth. Communication slows base on the available bandwidth. So if you don't have the available bandwidth, the communication slows down. Classic case in point, can I get a meeting? No, you can't because I don't have bandwidth for a meeting. It's more easily prioritized for essential versus non-essential communication. In-person, person to person, personal emails, sorry. In-person meetings is what I meant to say here. Certain kinds of email, postal mail, those are examples of targeted communication. There's a specific person or specific set of people that you're wanting to reach and it's done with intent. Large volumes that broadcast communication will slow down targeted communication. This is one of the reasons why emails get lost in the inbox, is because there is this barrage of broadcast communication and the actual targeted communication isn't being communicated. So your first-  |
|  | **Section 1 of 4**	\[00:00:00 \- 00:29:04\] |
|  | **Section 2 of 4**	\[00:29:00 \- 00:58:04\]*(NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section)*  |
| Matthias: | So your first rule of in business when dealing with your email, which we'll get to this more in depth, but your first rule of business is to divide this between broadcast communication and targeted communication. If the only thing you implement right now is set up filters for all of your broadcast communication and go squirrel them away everywhere else, and set up your filters for email that you know is targeted information, you've immediately solved a major constraint in your communication bandwidth in your email. This is also why the difference between broadcast versus targeted communication is also why you can email a dozen people and get no responses, but if you actually text people directly, then you get them all to sign up, because broadcast communication adds to the noise, targeted communication cuts through the noise. It's also why if you're ever in an emergency, you should ask one bystander to help you, instead of saying, "Hey, would somebody please help me?' "You in the blue shirt, help me out."  |
|  | So there's the targeted and broadcast communication, but then there's also the internal versus external communication, and every healthy system has two areas of communication, internal communication and external communication. So internal communication is communication that happens within the system, it's what the system needs to have within itself so that it continues to function, but then there's the external communication, which is how it interacts with the outside world. So you have everything that happens within a department, and all the department people within the department are talking to each other, but then the department needs to talk to somebody else and to another department, and that's external to the department. So it happens on a department level, it happens on a business level, there's all of the conversations that happen within a business, there's conversations that are external, where we're talking with customers and how the customer experiences it.  |
|  | As a system grows, as it grows to its capacity, the more the communication within that sphere continues to grow. So all of a sudden you have this whole department that's chattering with each other, and there's this noise, and it's relevance decreases and you increase the amount of broadcast communication. And so people stop hearing what they need to hear, they stop comprehending all of those things, and the weird thing is, we already told you, we sent this email, we did this, we did that, but it's not getting through. Why is it? Because the system has maxed out its communication bandwidth, people are overwhelmed, and that's one of the signals that there needs to be some kind of segmentation and breaking apart of some roles, some tasks, some responsibilities, when the noise of the communication increases too far.  |
|  | The complexity of a system is proportional to the number of people you communicate with, so if you want to reduce complexity, everybody in department A is talking to everybody in department B, that's a lot of people talking to each other. Reduce the number of people who have to communicate with each other, you'll lower the complexity. The number of times you have to communicate them. Are you communicating with them constantly, or is it daily, is it weekly, is it monthly? Reducing the number of times that you need to communicate will lower complexity. And the types of communication that you have with them. Are you communicating with them about a bajillion different things or is there small categories of things that you communicate with them? So reducing the number of people, times you need to communicate, and the types of communication will help lower the noise within an environment. And by the way, broadcast communication and noise in environments is one of the reasons why people don't get creative inspirational ideas. And so if you're not getting enough creative inspirational ideas, then reduce the number of people you communicate with, and reduce the times you communicate with them, and reduce the types of communication that you have with them.  |
|  | A simplified system removes as much external communication as possible without compromising the utility of the system. I think there is a thing of over optimization, where you optimize a system so far that it becomes unstable, which is what we see at the moment that you've got 10 or more direct reports, you've crossed the threshold into an unstable system and you've optimized it too far and it's going to break. Awesome, Jay? Along with this, with communication information, you have to understand that there needs to be some kind of source of truth, which are two, apparently competing, but important realities, that healthy systems require a single source of truth and healthy systems require redundancy. So one of the challenges that we often solve in terms of software is everybody has different ideas about when this product is going to be delivered or when this thing is supposed to happen or some other thing.  |
|  | There has to be one source of truth for, what is the state of this thing? And the more variants you have in that information, the more trouble that you create operationally. Healthy systems also require redundancy. I think just because you have a source of truth does not mean that you need to have a single point of failure. What happens if you put all your scheduling information into a single Excel spreadsheet and you lose the spreadsheet? Well, there's ways to have redundancy so that you don't lose a spreadsheet, even though you have a single source of truth. So questions on communication? Good. All right, system-based decision making, I want to distinguish between human decision making and complex decision making versus system-based decision making because... Yes, Jay, go for it.  |
| Jay: | Before we leave that, I just wanted to comment. When you talked about do we want to improve communication that we have to eliminate the number of people or things that we're doing, that is a critical thing for getting memos or for understanding, because you have to have some time to stop and think about new ideas and what you're looking for out of the people or the audience that you're trying to connect with. And that just made me realize that there are groups of people that I have to limit the number of people in that group that I communicate with in order to have a better impact on the group. So thank you for sharing that.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for the feedback, Jay. All right, so system-based decision making, there's a difference between intelligent decision making and non-intelligent decision making, and I'm going to basically categorize system-based decision making has as decision making that's designed for anticipated events. So systems have become overbearing when they universally apply decision making and actions to inappropriate situations. We've all been part of a chat bot, or part of some kind of phone experience, or some kind of customer service experience where, "Well, here's the rule, and so because this is the rule, this is what's going to happen and shame on you for asking anything different, and we're going to smack you over the head and make you follow this procedure." The reality is that when you build systems, they can only account for things that you can already anticipate, and if you anticipate any exceptions to that, then you can account for the exceptions and then handle the exceptions how the exceptions should work.  |
|  | But there's some situations within business that I think can be helpful just as examples. As you're building out business process, there might be that certain recurring invoices only get sent over a certain dollar threshold or that refunds are always pre-approved under a certain set of conditions, or that there's a certain amount of discretionary money that can be spent to keep a customer happy, or any number of boundaries. So here are questions to ask regarding this kind of system-based decision making. I think one of the ways that you can detect a lack of this is when there's a lot of fires to be fought, a lot of questions to be answered, there's a lot of things that come bubbling to you for a response and feedback.  |
|  | So some helpful questions to ask around these are what are the boundary conditions that we need to enforce here? What is too much? What is too little? What is too frequent? What is too infrequent? Let's enumerate the possible scenarios or the common scenarios that could happen in this particular case. What should should happen in the exception case? Et cetera. Don't really have a whole lot to add to that, system-based execution is also designed for predictable, repeatable actions, must be clearly defined, I think it's fair to note that it can be based on machine or human automation, and if you look at that from the context of a business, not all tasks should be automated by machines, there are some tasks that should be automated by people instead of machines. This is the surface of this whole thing that I kind of unpacked, is kind of going into this, and I don't know, any part of this that would be helpful for you guys to go deeper into.  |
| Speaker 5: | Can you just go back to questions to ask for just a moment? Okay, let me just read this again, it was too fast the first time.  |
| Matthias: | Yep.  |
| Speaker 5: | Okay, thanks.  |
| Matthias: | Yep. And I think if there ever is a encore to this or a sequel to this, I suspect there's some really interesting things about how you work with systems and how do you refactor systems, how do you rearrange parts, how do you prevent systems from breaking in the middle of changes, and those types of things. So part two, where this actually gets practical, and I think this is probably the piece where I struggled the most to be fully transparent, it's almost like a fish and water kind of problem, and so hopefully this is as thorough as it can be. It's probably not as thorough as can be, hopefully it's still helpful and hopefully together we can continue extracting.  |
|  | If you look at business as a system, it's a really simple system, it's a way of attracting customers, it's a way of fulfilling those, it's a way of repeating that if possible. It's like extremely basic thing, and then in addition, there's all of these supporting functions that go along with that that don't really fit in that, but nothing else can happen without that. And like I mentioned before, systems are fractal, so each of those have systems within systems. One of the things that I think can be helpful to understand in how to start looking at delegation is understanding that there is a, once again, systems are fractal or organizations are fractal. At the upper end of the org chart, there is the highest value work that's being done, and there's this continual push down the tree or down the chain of lower value work, and there's this continual push out to the side of things that shouldn't be done. And at the very bottom, if you optimize from top to bottom, at the very bottom you have low value work. The lowest value work is almost always requires the least level of sophistication, of training, of decision making, and it usually ends up being the easiest part of the entire process to automate some level.  |
|  | So I want to talk a little bit about delegation styles and how to delegate. I think one of the challenges that shows up sometimes is really around this. I have this stuff in my head, but I don't know how to get this stuff out of my head into somebody else's heads so that can actually do something practically with it. So each of us has a preferred teaching style, speaking, writing, diagramming, and doing and demonstrating. So some people prefer to verbally explain what's going on, some people prefer to have some kind of written communication. Here's the article, or here are the steps, or here's the information. There's the diagramming, the flow charts, the structure, the connections, like show me how will these pieces fit together, and by doing that, I can help you understand. Or there's the, Come watch me, look over my shoulder, watch me do it somehow or other, and I will be able to teach you to do it that way, but don't ask me to use words to explain or don't ask me to write it down on paper."  |
|  | And similarly, there's corresponding learning styles, which is do you prefer to learn by listening? Do you prefer to learn by reading? Do you prefer by looking at visuals and flow charts? Do you need to know how a thing is structured in order to learn? Or do you need to actually be kinesthetically engaged? Do you have to watch, and to do, and get your hands on something? And so with that, there's a question of, well, not only do you want to know the teaching style and the learning style, but you also want to know if you're looking at implementing process within a business, you want to understand what format do you want it in? Should this be picture? Should this be video? Should this be text? Should this be audio? Should this be fill in the blank? How should this be structured? And I think it really comes down to a matter of priorities.  |
|  | So what's more, most important? Is it most important for you to be able to offload quickly and quickly create these kinds of processes that other people can take over? Is it important for you or them to be able to quickly update them and modify them, keep them up to date? Or is it more important that for it to be fast for them? Do they need to be able to quickly consume it the first time or do they need to be able to quickly come back and review it and fill in the gaps? So with that, that determines the retention style. Do you want your processes documented as spoken words, written words, charts and diagrams, or videos and pictures? So kind of moving through this fairly quickly, does that line of thinking make sense to you guys? You good?  |
|  | So then once you understand that, you can understand what tools you want to use for that, and there's a whole set of tools that you can, such as recordings, transcriptions, using your phone, whiteboards, charts, mind maps, documents, chat, text message, email. So here is another tool set that I put together around delegation style, which is around the question of how do you prefer to teach? So let's say that somebody prefers to teach by diagramming and outlining the structure, and the most important thing is that we need people to be able to continually come back and look at this and review it, and they're delegating, but they're delegating to somebody who prefers to learn by listening. So this is a little bit of curveball at the end.  |
|  | So your preferred style is diagramming, and diagramming is the style that is the fastest to continually review and come back to. And because that's your preferred style, you don't need to translate it in order to put it into a business process. So you can build out your diagram, invite other people's feedback to finalize it, but because you're delegating it to somebody who's preferred style is listening, they may need help translating this into speaking. And just some quick tips on tools that you can use such as recording phone or Zoom calls, or Otter and Rev transcriptions. So you may put together a flow chart of how this functions and then record yourself explaining this, or they may have somebody record their explanation and they may keep that as their resource or go-to on that particular resource.  |
|  | Or we can start over and say, I prefer to teach by writing and now let's do I prefer to teach by speaking, and I want this to be fast to continually update, and I'm delegating it to somebody who does best by watching and doing. And so your preferred style is speaking, but writing is the style that's fastest to continually update, so you'll need to translate from speaking to writing. The best way to do this, use Otter or Rev to turn your speech into text and edit in its final form. And you may need to help somebody who's translating this into demonstrating or doing, or they may be able to go through those instructions and be able to translate it themselves and get it into their muscle memory. So once again for speaking, capturing these by recorded calls or transcriptions, for writing, again, it depends on whether you prefer the initial draft to be kind of dynamic, or whether you're trying to put together a finished product right out of the gate, but this could be assembled from more documents, chat transcripts, text messages, emails, et cetera.  |
|  | And then for demonstrating and doing, it could be that you go ahead and get that recorded as a step-by-step instructions, and then as a secondary level, you do some kind of delivery recording or include pictures or videos that people can visually see what's going on. Kelly, your question?  |
| Speaker 6: | If this doesn't seem germane, by all means skip it, but you made me think of the fact that if I build a spreadsheet in Google sheets or something, it's come out of my brain and so how it works and what its intentions are is clear to me, but I'm also aware of how painfully disorienting it can be to suddenly be confronted with a spreadsheet built by someone else. So maybe the simplest analogy in terms of what you just described is that for me, having someone talk through, saying like, "Here's here and here's why it's here." A minute of that probably spares me 20 minutes of angst and confusion.  |
| Matthias: | Yep, yep, that's a great example. Any feedback or questions from you guys on delegation style? Good. All right, so then what actual tool sets do you use to put these things together? There's actually something that is better to start with, which is I think anytime that you're building out tools or resources for your team to be able to implement process, delineate it, structure it, there's a few pieces that are important. I think it should be easy to access, it should be easy to search, easy to categorize, easy to update, and if it's hard to get to, it doesn't become part of the central workflow. If it's hard to find what it is you're looking for, again, it has very low utility. If there's not some kind of logical order or structure to it, then things just kind of fall apart and become disorganized, and when there's no way to update these things, then well then what's your plan?  |
|  | So Kelly, in your example, here's this spreadsheet. So you can have this spreadsheet living here, you can have the audio file, and if you want transcript, right beside it, named identically to the file. That's a very simple way to make it easy to access, easy to search, easy to categorize, and if you're dealing with audio and you have a transcript, then it actually makes it quite easy to update because you can modify the transcript and then go off the updated transcript, and you have a new audio version of that. As far as actual tools, I think anything can work, anything can fail. We've seen people use things like Google Drive or Dropbox, Notion, Process Street. We are a custom software shop so we use our own database platform and our own project management tools, our own wiki email reminders to tie these pieces together.  |
|  | So as an example, when we're spitting up a new task in the project management system for client engagement, we're able to copy the template from our documentation over here, and the template lives within our business documentation and it gets copied into the task of the project. We go through, check things off, get things done, and if there are any changes, then we go back. If there are any issues that come up that can be fixed with better process, then we go back into our documentation and say, "Hey, after we complete step three, we should also do this other thing and make sure that this issue doesn't happen again." Within the wiki, we have a tree structure, not surprisingly of documentation, and I'll get into categories of how we do that, different things we document, different types of training, job descriptions live there.  |
|  | And then we also have this tool set around email reminders, this is predominantly useful for administrative types of tasks, but it's also useful for other types of things as well. So every third Monday of the month, here is these set of tasks that need to be done for that, and this can be tied into project management system, there are other ways to do this, but having those recurring reminders. So as I kind of broke down, what are the different systemization tools that we use along the way within the process? Again, software is something that you think is something that's highly custom, but there's actually a lot of repeatable process within the process. So what are some of the tools? Here's a list and I'm going to just go through them one by one and talk them a little bit one at a time.  |
|  | Checklists. Checklists are great tools to verify work, look for things that can go sideways, things that are really important that actually happen. Did the money make it to the bank? Once we signed on a client, do we have all of the relevant materials from the client? Once we've fulfilled on a project, what are all the things that actually need to be done? And so we have some variant of this or actually multiple sets of this. In the onboarding process, there's like these reusable checklists, but then even within the projects that we deliver, there's certain checklists that we build out that are specific to the project that we build out and go over before it actually ends up being delivered to the client  |
|  | Templates. What are places where we're often building the same thing twice, or writing the same thing twice, or putting the same thing together multiple times. So certain types of emails that are constantly being sent the same way because some of us are marketers, this isn't rocket science, we're familiar with this idea, but what are certain types of client documents or certain types of reports that we're putting together similarly that are basically the same thing, the same way, different times? There's certain templates that we use within our system design process that become reusable.  |
|  | Training for onboarding. So I think one of the questions here is what's the baseline skill that you will hire? There's no reason hiring somebody with this specific where the expectation is they have this specific knowledge. Obviously you don't have to have any kind of training for that, but what do you want them to know about your culture, what do you need to know about the process, and what about job specific skills that they need to develop along the way? And this is something that deserves a spot in the slides, but one of the things that's incredibly useful when it comes to building out systems and process is the rule of three, which is basically that you should never try to systematize, or automate, or do anything like that until you've done something at least three times. And because what what's going to happen is you do it once the first time, and you're going to do it kind of right, and then the second time you're going to realize that there's this other thing that's kind of different, and by the third time you've actually recognized that, well, here are the things that are the same about everything, and here are the things that are different, and these are the things that I can extract, and these can actually be repeatable, and I can handle this off to a VA. One of the places I see people going...  |
|  | **Section 2 of 4**	\[00:29:00 \- 00:58:04\] |
|  | **Section 3 of 4**	\[00:58:00 \- 01:27:04\]*(NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section)*  |
| Matthias: | List off to a VA. One of the places I see people going sideways with virtual assistants is trying to take these one-off tasks that they've barely even mastered themselves and trying to break it down into something that's very tactical for a virtual assistant to do, and then the virtual assistant goes off the rails and nobody knows why. So the rule of three is tremendously helpful. So this particular piece, depending where you're at, has perhaps less relevance than for some others of you.  |
|  | Knowledge base, this is one of the things that we opted to do, which is having our training actually serve as a knowledge base as well. And so the training process can be, our entire training, you can go through the slides of the training and go through the individual pieces of the training, or you can search the search for specific pieces of information that you need, such as there's product knowledge that you need.  |
|  | Process and process documentation. These are little one sheets of things that need to be done repeatedly and can be handed off by somebody else. And if they're actually documented, then somebody else can take it over. And so it's a simple document that has a clear title and single sentence overview and multistep instructions, and here's how it takes and you just can't screw it up. And if it's wrong, then you go fix it and tweak it and update it. And it's a living document.  |
|  | Email reminders. What are things that need to be done on a recurring schedule? What are the things that easily get forgotten because they're infrequent? And what are things that happen on a calendar basis, not a project basis? Different things happen on different timelines, and so keeping your eye out for those things can free your mind from keeping track of all of that.  |
|  | Job descriptions, again, there's not really that much to add to this. General categories and expectations for the roles, process for periodically reviewing and updating the job descriptions as well. I might add some of the process documentation if you're not actively using it. Sometimes some things are used more actively than others, and so if it's not actively used, sometimes it can drift out of date.  |
|  | And there's a whole bunch of additional software tools that you can use, such as survey tools, or Zapier, Google Scripts or spreadsheets, or can write something custom if you want to, or a bajillion other ways to do that.  |
|  | Any questions on the, I guess the tool sets on that? I think one thing that did not make it in the slides that I think would be helpful to note that I think there's a lot of value in finding the low hanging fruit and pursuing what I would call tactical delegation, which is basically when you look at your total span of things that you're doing, and you break that apart and you find the low hanging fruit that you can hand off, breaking that, the lowest value work that you're doing is the work that you should offload first and is usually the easiest work to actually offload. And those are the pieces that can be most easily broken out into some simple, repeatable process that can be handed off to somebody else.  |
|  | So what are types of categories and examples that we have within our documentation? I think there's two ways to think about this. What is the department or what part of the business does this fall into? And so we categorize a bunch of stuff from that perspective. What are the things that are documented regarding marketing or sales or delivery and fulfillment or client support, sporting functions, role training. Mark, Process Street and other SaaS tools for workflow? I don't have a good resource for you on getting a decision towards third party processes and tools, but I will be happy to follow up on that and get back to you.  |
|  | So what are some examples of things we put into our sales documentation? What are common objections? How do you frame people's perspective when they're looking to buy? What are proper analogies to use? What is the most important sales training that really matters the most? Information about delivery, fulfillment, the product. Practical things like how do you take payment? How do you hand off once you've made a sale? How do you hand off the client to the next person? What's the process for following up with leads.  |
|  | Delivery and fulfillment, there's certain internal tasks that need to happen and it ties into the project management. What's the onboarding process? What's the onboarding call agenda? What are the call schedules going on from that? What's the pricing on the upsell and or next step for the client?  |
|  | Client support. Once again, we have templates, certain types of common issues that people face or internal tutorials and troubleshooting. How do you troubleshoot client client issues or product documentation? What are specific features that clients need to use? I know this is a little different because we're coming from a software standpoint, but these are still documenting those common client questions. And if you want to, some of these can be made available to the client, and give them easy access to that.  |
|  | Supporting functions, I mean, what's your hiring process? This is just super high level and there's people who get way more sophisticated than this, but what's your interview process? What's your job listing process? How do you create a job listing? How do you know when it's time to hire? Let's go way back to the beginning. And by the way, what accounts do you need to create for them, and what's their first day look like and all of that. What are all the legal pieces that need to happen? Internal tutorials, what are specific tools that we use as a team? How do you request paid time off and a bazillion other things? We have a daily and weekly check-in process with our team. How do those work? We use virtual reception for our calls, so there's a very detailed process about how inbound calls get handled, job descriptions, which I mentioned earlier.  |
|  | Any questions on those broad categories, on these categories? Okay, let's talk about email. Email is probably one of the things that showed up the most frequently is, "Hey, we need help with this. This is overwhelming. How do we fix this?" I think there's some basic mindset things that come into this or just perspective that come into this that's super helpful. One is you need to understand that email is a communication tool, it's not a project management tool. And email is prioritized by recency and/or urgency not based on actual priority. And the more that you rely on your email inbox to prioritize and manage your tasks, the more likely you are to become reactive because it's not intended for that, it's intended for communication.  |
|  | I talked earlier about this whole thing of your email has two types of communication. It's broadcast communication and it's targeted communication. And the more you can do to filter those out, then the more you can cut through the noise and get to the root of it. So you can set up automation for unpaid invoices to, there's certain sets of invoices that we routinely come in, send them them to a filter so you can review them on a ongoing basis. If there's receipts, send those to where they need to go so that those are archived appropriately. I've broken my subscriptions into daily, weekly, and monthly. And if it's not something that I should look out daily or these things that I really value this, and it's quality input on maybe not exactly every day but on a regular basis and weekly is lower quality input, and periodically I'll put my head in there and see what's going on, what's interesting.  |
|  | And then monthly is one of those things that I probably should have unsubscribe from. But for whatever reason, there's this little thing in the back of my head that I want to give myself permission to say subscribed. And so I put it in the monthly and if you don't make it on that list, then I'm sorry, you're out. And then by the way, who are all the people who really deserve high access to me directly? And their emails can go to the top of the list. And so there's a personal review folder where all of those things go in and unsubscribe from everything is possible and really ought to unsubscribe or review the weekly and monthly things well and certainly daily, but it's probably less likely to change than the weekly and monthly.  |
|  | So the 80/20 filtering is ad filters for individual subscriptions. And it's useful to match on the address, on the from address as well as the address and unsubscribed text so that you actually are filtering out real broadcast mail and not personal email from the list owner, and you put them in the right subscription folder. Then you add folders for partners, team members,, and most important clients or long-term clients into your personal review folder, that's actually where they need to go. And you can help this process by a very simple, easy step, and I don't pretend to have taken this super far, but a very easy next step is having an assistant pre-process some of that email and go through an unsubscribe for things that you don't be subscribed to and keep your eye open for important things and such.  |
|  | And I think the other piece, so that, just by doing that, you do nothing more than that. You've separated broadcast communication, meaningful broadcast communication, and you've prioritized broadcast communication and you've separated it from targeted communication that you actually want to pay attention to. And then you have this other bucket over here that's just noise and probably 95% of it, you don't actually need to do anything with or you need to unsubscribe or just get rid of the noise, but you've created some segmentation. Now, how do you effectively deal with the things that you actually need to deal with? And this is probably stuff that any other great productivity guru will or any great productivity guru will tell you. And it just took me a while to catch on, I don't know.  |
|  | But to some of the helpful distinctions for me has been knowing whether something, is this something that's act just informational in nature or is this actionable in nature? If it's just informational, then send it away and well, if it's actually back up, if it's informational, is it something that needs to be filed away somewhere? Is there someplace where I need to come back and find this? And if so, then it's a short email to my assistant to say, this needs to be filed away. Or if it's informational, now I know it, then it can disappear and I can always search for the email later. If it's actionable, then when and how does that need to be actioned? Does it need something in the calendar? Does it need something in the project management system or does this require some immediate follow up and let's set up a call or fill in the blank.  |
|  | One of the things that I found myself for whatever reason, perhaps personality, perhaps who knows why? I often found myself getting stalled on trying to make decisions on emails where I did not have sufficient information. And I think one of the things that has become really useful for me is to allow other people to shoulder as much of the responsibility as possible. And where there's insufficient information, putting it back on their shoulders to get the information that I needed in order to make a decision, or if there's some follow up required to put that off on other people's shoulders certainly where appropriate. But having that as a lens has been tremendously helpful.  |
|  | And then last of all, is this actually a current priority? There's two sentences in that? One is, if we don't do anything about this, will the problem go away? And sometimes problems do, or is this something that's a perceived, it was top of mind. It's not actually current priority, it's just showing up on the radar because just showed up on somebody's brain and it's looking at it now. So going back to some of the previous discussions about email not being project management. And for sure, there's way more that I could be doing with email if I really chose to. This is, I've landed on a happy medium for where I'm at as far as touching email but not getting buried in it, so that's where I'm at.  |
|  | Any questions on email? Good. All right, so where to start? So let's say that you actually want to begin working on systematization. You want to implement more process, you want to delegate, you want to offload, fill in the blank. Where do you start and what do you do? And so this is the part of, here's the invitation to go deeper I guess. And one of the things that I did, I did over the last about 60 days is we build out a time x-ray processing tool where we walk through your activities and we get an accurate perspective of your time and break down your highest value activities, your lower value activities.  |
|  | So highest value activities you should focus on, including the ones you should start doing, or you want to start doing. The lower value activities of what you need to let go of, and the measurable impact to your stress, weekly schedule and hourly impact, output. One of the things that we found is that unlike the carry around a time sheet for and keep track of all your time from 15 minute intervals and do that for a week so that you come back at the end and you actually see all these times where, all these things you shouldn't be doing, which can be quite helpful, but this is the collapsed, condensed version of that where we do this within about an hour and the pattern very strongly emerges. And usually there's this 80/20 of how you're spending your time that requires focus. And there's a question of, yeah, so it's this guided process plus software tool that we walk through to get that.  |
|  | I've been doing a handful, this is something that I pre-sold. We had an executive director whose last six months were focused specifically on delegation, and not doing things he shouldn't. And with that, there were a few finds that we had. One was a meeting that he was hanging on to that he needed to let go of and adjust. And because of the impact other people, he just had not yet started looking at options for what to do with that. And there were also a series of meetings that he was part of it that he realized he really didn't actually need to be a part of.  |
|  | We had a salesperson who, no lie, was spending 19 hours a week fixing other people's problems, process problems, operational problems, all of these other things, and playing the savior in the business. And when she recognized what she was doing, she realized that her somewhat aggressive sales goals that her sales manager had set would be completely doable if she would stop trying to fix operational problems that weren't actually her fault. And so just setting some boundaries around how she's planning to spend her time, got her completely changed her mindset on her work and her sales goals.  |
|  | There's another operations manager, so this is not something that we've implemented, but finding a way to increase the hourly value by 49%, these are self-reported approximations, getting stressed at about half and getting a overall time at the job by 21%. So that's the time x-ray. If that's interesting to you, send me an email, we can talk about that. So that was much less than three hours. That's the end of what I've put together here. Completely open to go as long as you guys want. Questions about systematization, about process, about delegation, automation, any of that around email or around more blue sky things like artistic selling propositions or about... No, I don't know. Anything really. So feedback, thoughts? Yes, Jay.  |
| Jay: | So what was your perceived outcome for monetizing what you're doing today?  |
| Matthias: | So the perceived outcome for monetizing is, well, so there's two pieces of this. That's a fair question. I think number one, I think the time x-ray, doing the time x-ray and walking through that process is one potential avenue. To be honest, going into this, I wasn't planning to monetize really in any way or even make any kind of offer whatsoever. I was like, "These are cool people and they're going to help me get this stuff out of my head, we should go spend some time together."  |
|  | Going deeper, there's this question of, there's the, okay, it's the classic of, "Hey, I think I'm good at something, I should be able to teach other people how to do this." And well yeah, you can, and you can get an insight into how my brain works, but there's also how many years of having this been molded by probably someone who falls into the non-conventional engineer perspective and develop this visceral, unusual, unique ability of looking at things that only emerge because you're you. So the other avenue or path is just working more directly in terms of how do you, beyond just what we talked about, even more practical nuts and bolts, how you actually get this stuff done so that you can implement this.  |
| Jay: | Yeah, because one of the things that I do is when I see a situation, I look at ways that it can be monetized and I see what you have developed as there's multiple things that you could put into just a little bit more automation, some of the systematizing that you already have, the basics in place that could turn into a revenue generator, a profit generator for you that would not require time away, as much time away from your existing business. So I think you've really put a lot of time and effort into this, and I think what you've done is very valuable.  |
| Matthias: | So I would love to have you expand your line of thought a little bit more if you'd be open to that.  |
| Jay: | Well, I'd have to go back through the slides because there were just different things that stuck out. But one is the time x-ray, that is something that could be a tool that could be automated where people could do it like a self test, and then you could review that and get back to them with some challenges, some ways to improve what they're doing. Then to take that a step further, you could even get people that already have a coaching business or something like that and then do a white label for them, for that product, for that industry and give them a complete exclusive for that industry if they maintain X number of customers going through it or something like that so that you're compensated each time they use it. And if they don't use it enough, then you use it, give it to somebody else.  |
|  | And just using a thing that's popped in my mind was I've used many VAs from the Philippines who are articulate, speak English well, even have a master's, and you can get them to do a lot of things. By offering to go in and set up an email filters for people that are "too busy to do it themselves," then I mean, there's just ways to expand on the systematizing that builds credibility with what you're doing and it solidifies them into becoming a client that will just line basically with, it's a different subset of what Perry does. I mean, I listen to everything that Perry has to do right now, even though it doesn't apply to me because he's bringing ideas and so he has an audience of thousands of people like us that you could develop your own audience and then share more things.  |
| Matthias: | Yep. Great. That's helpful. I appreciate it, Jay. So there's more, go ahead.  |
| Kelly: | Matthias, I was just going to say there were a lot of big ideas. I was seeing all kinds of things in your first slides that jumped out at me as like, "Oh, this is a meme quote," you know what I mean? Where you see six words and you're like, "Dang, that's a lot to think about." So I guess I just want to affirm that what you've recognized about your unique context, tying different things together, that does to somebody like me that has lived a life in a completely different context, it's landing for me is really interesting and fresh and a whole different perspective or angle. So thank you for that. And yeah, I'll be intrigued by listening to the replay again, riding my bike and letting it all soak in a different way.  |
| Matthias: | Sounds good. Appreciate it. Got a-  |
| Speaker 7: | I'll add onto that a little bit.  |
| Matthias: | Go for it, thank you.  |
| Speaker 7: | So if I take the sections, so you had systems introductions and we have the stuff and then it's the actual tools and the techniques. If I just look at the tools, this last piece more or less, the tools, systematizing email, doing things like that, standalone, if I took a standalone, I don't see a lot of differentiation there between what a thousand other people do. So what I would look for, what I'm suggesting you do is look at that first section like Kelly was talking about, lots of things in there, but what are the differences that having those mindset, that systems mindset and the subparts of the system mindset make in doing the prioritization, doing efficiencies and everything else. Because that's the actual difference, the differentiation between you and the bazillion of efficiency and time people out there that are just recommending the same stuff.  |
|  | So in going through it, first part was strong, but it didn't really get that connection about why I should consider, the tool is separate, right? Because that's a cool thing. The x-ray is a separate deal that's separate, but all the rest of them, it just didn't have the connection there. If I just take any one of those slides say, "Okay, in this, what's the differential for a client or a customer or anyone I want to influence about having a systems view versus just taking those tips?" Which if I Google, I'll find them. I mean just in generic form, I'm not saying the next level and you're talking to somebody and implementing, it's not going to be there. I'm just saying in the way you presented it today, right? There's all this cool stuff up front and I get the other and it's like, "Well, I'm not seeing it."  |
|  | And so that's where I think, and now when you having done it today and you go back to recording is think about or your notes is okay, and what Kelly said and what others have said, "Oh, that's a gem that Jay said," and things that Kelly's looking for are, the things. So what are the things that stand out, but what are the implications? I'll give you an example. So you mentioned earlier, I can't remember if we talked about that or not, the idea about refactoring and how that's applied to software assistance, but how it can also apply to organizations. Well, guess what? Every single change that leaders make in an organization involves refactoring of some level, so that's a huge area and a huge.  |
|  | **Section 3 of 4**	\[00:58:00 \- 01:27:04\] |
|  | **Section 4 of 4**	\[01:27:00 \- 01:54:30\]*(NOTE: speaker names may be different in each section)*  |
| Speaker 7: | Right? So that's a huge area and a huge implications for systems thinking if I go back to it. So there's lots of things like that. I'm just, I'm not dissuading you from talking about the email and everything else from an efficiency standpoint, but maybe to Jay's point, and maybe if you leave the X-ray as a intro tool or some way to get into the Matthias universe, and then the coaching consulting needs to be something that's differentiated from all the vast number of others. So that was a little bit long, but that was kind of the overview of as I was thinking through it and listening to what you're saying.  |
| Matthias: | So if I can talk it back to you, it's kind of like... I think there's this frustration that I've had with most of the teaching, which is here are the tools to go do it, but there's not a lot of, how should I actually be thinking about this as I approach it? And then when I think about doing a training, it's like, well, how do I actually make this practical if I don't go recap all of the how-tos of what everybody else is already talking about?  |
| Speaker 7: | Well, so let's take one of those how-to. So for instance, if, let's take the reverse, maybe if just as a thinking possibility here, I take all those how-to, well maybe for each one of those, how-tos you put a statement about, if you don't do this with a systems perspective, here's all the bad juju that can happen, right? Here are all the errors and the holes that you can fall in.  |
|  | Now you can go backwards from that and say, okay, you can do the connection and do the other stuff because there's all that stuff that's not going to happen. I mean, a great example from a systems point-of-view is someone will take the current vogue topic of transformation. Everybody wants to do transformation, but they only want to change a little bit of this process over here without thinking about the big picture of does that affect everything? They'll just take some tool from somewhere, apply it, and hey, they're not getting the results. They go, "Why?" Because they didn't consider the connection to the rest of the organization as a system.  |
|  | Okay? So that's what you're describing about the tools. But that is what then I would focus and make obvious, and I didn't make it as obvious as I should had earlier. When you're talking about the tools and the how-to make it different about, hey, if you do this well, you might make this impact, but guess what? You're missing all these other things out here by not taking the system's view, especially if you're doing it on a larger level or one impact on a larger level.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah.  |
| Speaker 7: | Did that help?  |
| Matthias: | Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's helpful. I got one question in the chat, "One person business. Currently, I want to expand. I've gone as far as I can by using occasional freelancers. I develop e-commerce websites and digital ad campaigns. What are the typical problems I need to avoid by expanding? Best/recommended management systems, Asana, et cetera. Can see that some of your slides are very relevant to my situation."  |
|  | Well, here's something that's really interesting regarding expansion. Sorry, wrong one. This guy. Let's say that your organization size is two and you have one level of management. Well, you have two people and one worker, and your management structure is 50% management and 50% work.  |
|  | And now is it true that you can split your time doing some work? Yep. But you're going to be surprised how much time you start spending actually running the machine. So one of the mistakes that people make with this is not having enough margin early on. You need proportionally higher, the smaller your business, the more margin you need proportionally in order to scale because, well, first of all, as soon as you introduce your first team member, you introduce a significant amount of overhead, management overhead and you don't get economy of scale until you actually grow past that point.  |
|  | And on top of that, if you're just starting out, hiring the wrong person is horribly expensive. And even if you do get the right person, it's still costs money to get them onboarded enough to speed with what needs to happen. So those are some typical problems I think to avoid.  |
|  | Recommended management systems. Oh goodness, and I think to Mike's point, this is probably where I feel like not only am I not that differentiated, I'm probably not even the best person to ask. I think...  |
| Speaker 7: | So let's put it in the form of what he should be asking you. So the question to be asking you is that, when I think about this, what are the processes I need to put in place for a business system that has employees rather than just me, and then pick the tools later based on what those processes are? Right?  |
| Matthias: | Sure. So the way that you should start thinking about this is you have a business developing e-commerce websites and digital ad campaigns. So how clear are you on, is the flywheel turning actively bringing in new clients? Is that consistent? Is that stable? Is that reliable? Is that a system that is currently working? Is your sales process currently working?  |
|  | And then there's this question of what does the fulfillment and delivery process look like? So what is your onboarding process and what is your ongoing support process? And then looking at across the scope of those things, where are you?  |
|  | I mean, so if your sales and marketing systems aren't stable, then you're going to introduce a lot of instability into your business, adding operational overhead, adding to your operations without beefing that up. And then looking, I would look across those. And again, the time x-ray I think is a great way to go about this, but where are the places where you're spending low value work and are you wanting to expand strictly by... Honestly, the easiest place to start is finding the low value work that you can offload across those things. Or what are the things that are time-consuming that can be automated?  |
|  | And I mean, I would start by doing that. Now the other approach you can take is just go find somebody who's better than you at running ad campaigns and build the sales and marketing machine and feed these leads off to them. But I don't know, that's how I would go about thinking about the issue, Mustafa.  |
| Mustafa: | Thank you Matthias, for this is great. So keep the same slide and it's a question related to the question you just got. So I'm a one person everything. What I try to do is to delegate what I don't want to do. Let's say I want to print 200 copies of testimony booklet, I send it to a company or UPS or whatever. Now I start to struggling by they are not on time, and I need the stuff to be done on time.  |
|  | Now hiring somebody to be working with me, for me, it's a pain in the neck. I don't like people, I like to do stuff by myself because I get the idea, just go do it. I don't like, wait, what if, excuse, all that stuff. So backing up with this, how can I overcome this?  |
|  | Because I don't want, as you said, low value. I don't want to do low value stuff. I want to spend most of my time thinking and applying my ideas because I think I have greater days and they work. When I execute them, then I struggle with executing them because I don't have somebody to help me. I don't have the time to do them.  |
| Matthias: | So the one thing that stands out from your question is this whole conversation is about how do we build simple repeatable process that continues? And what I'm hearing you say is, "What I actually prefer to do is an art form." And so you not actually, this is what it sounds like to me is you're not actually looking for somebody who can dot the I's and cross the T's. What you're looking for as much as that is a dancing partner of somebody who can dance with your crazy ideas and go pull them off.  |
|  | Or you switch your mindset to, or yeah, you switch your mindset to let's go back over these successful ideas that I've had and these creative ideas that have worked. And let me look for ways that I can turn these into something that can actually be repeatable. Again, this is just inferring from what you're saying, but it sounds to me like the idea of that kind of bores you, but there are people who would be, I don't know, again, there's different ways to approach this. There are people who would be delighted to have an idea that actually works and to take that working idea and to do it five, 10, a hundred times over until indefinitely. Is that your question?  |
| Mustafa: | Yeah. Well, let's say I had the idea as you know, the traveling thing, right?  |
| Matthias: | Mm-hmm.  |
| Mustafa: | It was great. I even want to announce it to my patients. A lot of them asked for it because everybody now is literally traveling. They need this. Now I need to print that. I need somebody to be on top of it. I cannot leave what I'm doing to go printing. So I go to say, "Hey, UPS take this, give me 200 copies." "Okay. In two days." In two days I call nothing yet. 10 days now, nothing. So the idea is not executed because I have no control on this. So should I hire somebody to be having all that stuff to do it or just delegation like what I'm doing is the right thing?  |
| Matthias: | I mean this is-  |
| Mustafa: | That's an example.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah. I think the question I can't answer is where do you want to go with it? Are you wanting that part of the business to become something that's repeatable, that becomes a part of the business that continues to grow? Or do you-  |
| Mustafa: | Yes.  |
| Matthias: | I mean, okay. So then what's the hesitation on finding somebody who can... What's the hesitation? There's some kind of hesitation about, I guess where's the hesitation with finding somebody to do that or with, I mean, is it a question of whether you should find somebody? Is it a question of who that person is? Is it a question of should you just have better selection of your printing company?  |
| Mustafa: | Well, should I hire somebody to take care of this trivial stuff? That's my question. Or I just keep looking for a better company?  |
| Matthias: | Well, I think regardless, I think almost at any stage that there is always opportunity for trivial things that you can hand off to somebody else. And so I don't know if it's specifically this. Let's chase down and see whether you can get these booklets printed or whether it's go take care of all of these other trivial things like housekeeping or bookkeeping or all of the other trivial things that need to be done.  |
|  | I think it depends on the quality of the person that you find. And it depends on the... And it's also easier if you have, I also think initially, this is my opinion. Initially, it's easier to find those things that need to be done repeatedly and find somebody who can learn how to do those things repeatedly. And you don't have to be explaining yourself over and over again.  |
|  | And so if you can save yourself an hour every week by things that you're already spending an hour on every week and they need to be done every week or multiple times a month, I don't feel like I have a good answer for what. But but you can almost certainly benefit by finding somebody to offload some of those low value tasks too. Jay?  |
| Jay: | Yeah, just one small nugget of advice for Mustafa. Using a virtual assistant here in the US initially to hand, this is somebody who already knows how to get multiple office things done. So even though you might wind up paying $25 or $35 an hour for that person, it will help you determine what types of things that you can let them do. And the more things you get off, eventually, you might have a dedicated person that does those kinds of things specifically for certain task.  |
|  | But the more things that you can offload to a virtual assistant here, number one, you're not hiring an employee. So if you're having a cash flow, you just cut that person off this week or this month, but instead of having an employee or bringing somebody in to work with you, it's keeping your brain clear because it sounds like you like to work alone and think and then pass it off to somebody or something like that.  |
|  | So using a virtual assistant where you can just email them that says, "Hey, get this thing printed," and they do that, or, "I need a graphic for this," or something like that. And so it's a learning curve for them and for you. As you find that you can push more and more things away, it frees your time up to do the things that are important.  |
|  | And that's one of the things that Matthis brought out earlier that just hit me, is that we have so many things crowding for time in our mind and with things that need to be done that are urgent, but not necessarily as important as what you're doing. So if we start doing the important things and taking the urgent things and push him off to somebody whose whole job is doing urgent things, and that's what a virtual assistant is handling printing for you and printing for Matthias and printing for several other people at the same time. And so they're not trying to think about how to make their business better. They're just working. So that's-  |
| Mustafa: | Here's my issue. I tried two companies before for virtual assistant. Never showed up on time. The first meeting I was like, if you already don't show up pre-work, how I'm going to trust you with my work?  |
| Jay: | That's a very valid question. So maybe third time's a charm and maybe it takes five times and that's better than hiring an employee that doesn't show up or it shows up late four days in a week to the office. So it's better to have a virtual assistant that you can get rid of than somebody that you've hired that's not working.  |
| Mustafa: | Okay, I'll look into that. So they can do the work even if they are not around me?  |
| Jay: | Oh, absolutely. Yes.  |
| Mustafa: | Okay.  |
| Jay: | Here's an example. I have a bookkeeper who is a certified financial analyst who is a fractional CFO and she took a series of books for a small company and just made it work great. But I've never met the lady and I'm in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She's in Denver, Colorado. But she has transformed my life and she communicates directly with my CPA, she helped us do insurance for worker's comp, I mean, there's just all kinds of things that I never knew that somebody could do. And she says, "Oh, I can do this, or I can do that," and just go do it.  |
| Mustafa: | Okay. Yeah. I will look into this again today. Thank you.  |
| Jay: | Sure.  |
| Matthias: | Good.  |
| Jay: | Sorry, Matthias. I didn't mean to-  |
| Matthias: | No, it's good. I appreciate that. Something else that came to mind while you were talking as well is I think in an ideal situation, making one step back. And if you have somebody who can say, "Hey, I need these booklets printed and I need them in two days," go find somebody who's going to do that. That's one step better than saying, "Hey, let's go to UPS and figure out how to get UPS to print these booklets, because it's like, yeah, clearly that's not happening.  |
| Mustafa: | Yeah, it's a great business idea, helping entrepreneurs get their ideas done or execute. That's a great business idea. Somebody can do that you'll earn a lot of money.  |
| Matthias: | I think it would be helpful to hear from the first part, this is kind of going back to Mike's comments, but what are the gems that you heard and you're like, "That needs to be framed or highlighted or emphasized"?  |
| Mustafa: | This slide is a gem for me.  |
| Matthias: | Sorry. That was it?  |
| Mustafa: | I like this one, this slide that we are on now, 80/20 management.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah.  |
| Mustafa: | It's great. And there was another one when you talked about communication. That was great too. That's very, very effective.  |
| Matthias: | The-  |
| Mustafa: | Yep. This one. No friction. Low, high. Yes. That was great too. That was great.  |
| Jay: | So for yourself, have you thought about a DSP.  |
| Matthias: | In this particular aspect of it? I mean, have I thought about it? I kind of feel like I'm, in this particular aspect, I'm actually kind of hunting for what it is I'm looking for.  |
| Jay: | Yeah. Because of your expertise in systemized systems and codes, it's almost like you could put together, and I don't know what the total package looks like yet, but you have the beginnings of a package to go and work and help coders or coding teams become more efficient.  |
| Matthias: | Yep.  |
| Jay: | And I don't know what that looks like anymore, but I know how Perry works with all of these different people except he's bringing value. And I think if you're really, he keeps talking about being the king of a niche. And I think the more you bring it down into people who understand systems, but they're using Mustafa's deal. They're so busy working that they can't get things done that they need done, but yet they're needing somebody to come in and help them put it together.  |
|  | And I think you have the framework and you can talk to coders and understand their language. And as Perry says, you can read a page out of their journal because you've been there. So you have the ability to get inside their head and write the copy or let somebody else write the copy that brings out those pain points.  |
| Matthias: | So everything in part one is censored in some degree to make sense to people who are not coders.  |
| Jay: | Okay.  |
| Matthias: | Because my basic process was I'm going to digest for an hour and here's all the software coding equivalence, and we're going to boil them down to the basics. And then how do I communicate this to other people? But if I were to go to a, I think perhaps my hesitation with software companies, it's like, well, are they wowed by systems? I don't know.  |
|  | But it could be that what they're wowed by is, "Hey, we live in systems all day and everything I need to know about how to run my business is right in front of me and I already know this stuff. But nobody ever was actually able to extract it and articulate it in the way that you can."  |
|  | And I think perhaps I could replicate those same sets of aha's of talking about machine code and Zapier is probably more interesting to them than it is to you guys. And there's refactoring, like Mike mentioned and other things like that. It's definitely worth the look. Anybody else have gems in the highlights things that these were the best parts of it?  |
| Speaker 8: | Can you just spin back to some of the very first slides for me quick because I have a feeling...  |
| Matthias: | There's that, this, there's this guy.  |
| Jay: | That was good. Whoa. Can you back up one second?  |
| Matthias: | Yeah.  |
| Jay: | The difference between a developer and a designer, that was a key takeaway that a lot of people, again, these guys who are designing websites under see all the parts, the people who are actually building the thing, all they know is they need to build another step and great designers are not great developers.  |
| Speaker 8: | Oh, back up there. Oops, there. Yeah. This I thought was really interesting. Right? And I know there was a slide later where you had the header and the subhead and both of them struck me as super, a ton of concept in just a few words.  |
|  | There. That was it. That, yeah, that's one of them at least, that overloaded systems want to divide. I've never thought about that concept ever and it's really interesting. And all growth halts without division. Same idea said differently, but really provocative to me.  |
| Matthias: | There was a communication piece and then there is that second part too. Okay. Cool. Anybody else? Anything else? Are we good? Okay. Well, going once-  |
| Mustafa: | You put effort on this. You can tell that you really, really put different thought in was really great. You made it simple. This means you mastered the information. I like that.  |
| Matthias: | Simple.  |
| Mustafa: | Yeah, you made it simple. I'm a person who doesn't understand all of that stuff. I understood.  |
| Matthias: | Yeah. All right. Well appreciate you guys. I'm going to get this uploaded and I'll get the email sent out to you guys afterward.  |
| Mustafa: | Thank you very much, Matthias. \[inaudible\].  |
| Speaker 8: | Yeah. Thanks, Matthias.  |
| Matthias: | You're welcome. Yep. You're welcome. Thanks. All right, bye.  |
| Speaker 8: | Bye.  |
