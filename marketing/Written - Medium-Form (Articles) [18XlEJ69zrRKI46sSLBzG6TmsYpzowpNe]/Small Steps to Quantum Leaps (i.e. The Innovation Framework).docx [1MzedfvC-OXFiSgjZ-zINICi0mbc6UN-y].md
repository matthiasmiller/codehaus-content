# **Small Steps to Quantum Leaps**

## The **Proven Innovation Framework** That Moves You to Something You've Never Seen Without Recklessly Risking What You've Always Had

# Preface

Quite some time ago, I was working on a software project that had an
unusually high level of complexity. I was only one of a handful of
developers even capable of making the required changes\--and all of them
were too busy to take it on.

As I'd been working on the project, I began to recognize that I was
repeating the same pattern as I was working through this intractable
problem.

In the back of my mind, I realized that I'd been learning different
important lessons on how to solve really difficult problems regarding
innovation, change, and quantum leaps. I'd gotten stuck multiple times
on this project, so I wanted to take more time to articulate the
process, providing myself tools to keep the project moving along.

Most surprising to me was how deeply this pattern ran through my life.
Looking back, I've consistently found myself on the **scene of major
transitions**. These examples include:

-   Starting to work for a software development company just as they
    > were moving to an entirely platform, a massive undertaking that
    > involved deep technical changes as well as significant changes in
    > development culture

-   Starting to work for a nonprofit only months before their first
    > major leadership transition in 20 years, working alongside the
    > leadership team through the transition

-   Joining a local economic development corporation just as they were
    > starting a local tech initiative, the first of its kind within the
    > state of Colorado

Each of these were major transitions that other people set in motion,
not something that I specifically sought out.

These patterns played out not only in these significant seasons of life.
They also played out in smaller, less dramatic changes and transitions
on the scene.

I recognized that this same approach could be applied to other
challenging problems, including complex organizational restructuring,
restructuring a marketing strategy, migrating a company to adapt to
industry changes, and even undergoing deep personal identity shifts.

Since then, I've continually returned to this framework to help me
understand how to make strategic decisions in my business.

Before we unpack the toolset, let's lay some philosophical groundwork.

### Why All Systems Tend Towards Chaos

Almost every system ever designed started with simplicity. Do something
logical given the current needs, then continue to adjust as the needs
change.

Here's an example:

When you look at the road systems of today (especially in the older road
systems), you'll notice that it followed a simple pattern: find the most
efficient path from one town to another, accommodating for hills,
mountains, valleys, rivers, and streams. Because of the available
toolset, the simplest approach accommodated the path that was easiest to
build, even if it was a longer, curvier, more roundabout path.

This was a great approach (and simple!) in the beginning. When there
were only a few communities and transportation methods were limited, it
made sense to build it like this.

However, as more communities, towns, and cities began to spring up,
people needed to adapt. In addition, they had additional tools available
to them to build roads where they wanted them to go, not just where the
landscape allowed.

As this happened, the complexity began to increase. They began to build
more roads, and the best roads were between the communities that needed
the most connection with each other. Because the cost of changing these
roads is cost-prohibitive, many cities and towns are not designed to
handle this level of complexity.

The same is true in business.

When most businesses start out, they begin by gauging the market needs
and offering a variety of services to a variety of people. This works
while the business is small. However, as the business grows, this leads
to an incredible amount of complexity and chaos in the business.

In addition, many entrepreneurs have a notorious bent towards creating
complexity. As they identify new opportunities and ideas, they continue
adding to their existing business. They add product lines, but never
remove old ones. They hire people, but rarely fire. They set up systems,
but never remove them. They add customers, but not never let go of them.

With time, these things become increasingly complex and inefficient. It
becomes time to simply. At times, it requires moving to a fundamentally
new model.

Reality is continually evolving. Disruption happens when someone is
willing to reexamine the issues and design a new system that models
reality more accurately.

## All Complexity Started With Simplicity

Almost all complexity began with simplicity.

This introduced a concept called the Network Effect, where each
additional city added an exponential amount of complexity. (We'll talk
later on how this applies to other problems.)

This problem is exaggerated when you're working in capital- and
labor-intensive projects like road construction. The cost of changing or
moving a road is extremely difficult, and if your area is expanding at a
rapid rate, you never question your approach. You continue building
roads just to keep up.

The point is this...

As the number of roads increased, the MODEL for placing those roads was
no longer the best or most efficient model. To make matters worse, tight
construction made it almost impossible to adapt even the busiest roads
to increase capacity.

Herein lie a few of our first important lessons.

## Lesson 1: Complexity creeps up on you.

Complexity rarely comes knocking on your door. In fact, most times, it
starts out with SIMPLICITY and as the situation continues to expand, all
changes continue under the original paradigm.

Many people wake up TOO LATE. All of a sudden, they're surrounded by
winding roads with severe traffic jams, and there's almost no way to
reverse the situation.

## Lesson 2: Complexity is often a factor of incremental growth.

The more incremental the growth you experience, the more likely you'll
encounter broken systems. This is more likely to happen with incremental
growth.

If someone walked into your office and told you, "You're going from a
\$1mil organization to a \$10mil organization tomorrow," you would
immediately radically rethink your approach.

However, if that happened over the span of 5-10 years, you'd be less
likely to question the model of what's going on until it was seriously
broken.

Plateaus (or growth barriers) are actually your friend, because they
demonstrate where you've failed to adapt to the new system required.

## Lesson 3: Solving complexity almost always requires rethinking the model.

Almost all complexity comes from a model that is broken. At one time,
everything used to fit into a simplistic model. However, as times change
or adapt, that model has remained fixed.

While you can incrementally ADAPT to a new model, you cannot merely
TWEAK your model. You need to almost completely revamp how you think
about the issue, and once you've done that, you can start implementing
incremental change.

## Lesson 4: The most significant breakthroughs almost always require relinquishing effort and lowering noise.

The software project pushed me to make a shift away from effort to
awareness. It was impossible to simply power through it. It required the
creative space of problem solving.

The only way to address these issues was to stop exerting effort. It
required me to rest. It required me to sometimes think of something
*different and unrelated*. It required me to go on walks and bike rides.

It was a test of creative discipline, albeit a different kind of
discipline. Once I made the shift, I began making the connections and
getting the insights required.

Most change requires a fundamentally different approach or perspective
of the world.

## The Process for Resolving These Issues

When most people encounter these issues, it's WAY past the time they
should have fixed it. There are problems (and often SEVERE) problems
because of it. It's a PR crisis because of an unaddressed equity issue.
It's a financial crisis because they can't cash flow their growth. It's
a burnout problem or staff retention issue because they can't adapt
resources to match needs.

The goal of simplification is to REDUCE THE VARIABLES of any given
system. For example, you can often tell the quality of a culture by the
LEAST number of conditions you have to remember.

If you have a culture of innovation, you don't have to encourage people
to keep thinking of new ideas. If you have a culture of empathy, you
don't have to have policies for make sure people are cared for. Etc.

For example, if you're in customer service, you might have developed all
kinds of policies, such as:

1.  What items can be returned for a full refund

2.  What types/resolutions require manager approval

3.  The script used to answer the phone

Etc cetera

In this case, customer service has a definite rules-based approach.
Again, this can be helpful in specific situations. However, it becomes a
problem because **each exception provides exponential complexity**.

Here's where I believe the whole thing starts.

## Step 1: Get a clear picture of your target model

I think the most important process is getting a clear picture of how you
would organize or design your solution, based on WHAT YOU CURRENTLY KNOW
about the situations you're addressing.

At this stage, you don't worry about figuring out all the details of how
to make the transition. Just make sure that you can develop a cohesive,
sensible model that addresses what you're trying to do.

For example, a business that has added all kinds of products, etc over
the years may look to find common themes, most successful products, etc
and develop a simpler, more consolidated product line that makes sense
with the company vision.

Or a business that's had different people grow into different roles.
Sometimes, people are taking care of too much stuff, or they're in
positions that they shouldn't be in. Sometimes you need to introduce
another layer of leadership.

The goal is to identify the BIG PICTURE design of what you're moving
towards.

*The difference between conventional planning and the current planning
model is that traditional planning is built around nailing down every
last detail. In a static environment or a predictable market that works
very well. If you\'re putting together a piece of software, and it\'s
very simple and straightforward without a lot of variables, then you can
spec out most of this stuff from the get go. This is one of the reasons
why phases are so important in projects. You don\'t know what you don\'t
know. You might roll out a project, only to discover that the market
leans in a different direction or something like that. Because you\'re
creating something new, something that hasn\'t existed before, you
don\'t have the capacity to evaluate it until it\'s actually in the
market. That\'s how it really is in the software world.*

*Now, in a very static environment, something like banking, you actually
want to have the highly detailed plan because there isn\'t a lot of
change and it is very straightforward. It\'s very complex, but there\'s
not a lot of variables, it\'s very static. So you can use a static plan.
In a lot of conventional businesses you can do that. The more innovative
the business, the less you\'re able to do that. Innovative businesses
require an iterative approach. It also requires this whole approach that
I\'ve been talking about in my article. It\'s a completely different way
of looking at the world. Some people might say, "hey, you\'re not
planning if you\'re doing it this way." Actually you are, but it\'s a
completely different model of planning.*

*Something else to consider. Most planning is on the details, but not
anchored on the outcomes. The 80/20 of event planning is determining the
outcomes of the event. Most of the other details around planning become
noise without it. This is my hangup with most planning.*

*For example ;-) .... Handwriting on envelopes is a means to an outcome.
Discussing the best way to do that is an exercise in standard
management. The outcome is open rate. Shifting focus to the outcome
allows an 80/20 question of the best and easiest way to do that. One
idea is to print the headline on the back of the envelope. You don\'t
get these types of ideas from conventional planning. I have
instinctively questioned these things but this is codifying what I
naturally do.*

## Step 2: Build the minimalistic shell/foundation that you need to start the transition.

It's easy to make the mistake of over-engineering this, but you'll need
to put whatever basic foundation in place.

If you can start by doing this in a place where you don't need to do any
transition, this is by far the easiest way to get started. Start in
places where you have a completely clean slate, because this allows you
to test the assumptions of what you actually want.

In the product example, if you're wanting to move from one training
platform to another, you could consider creating a pilot product on the
new platform the prove that you understand what you need and that you've
created the process correctly.

In the leadership example, if you're getting ready to spin up a new
department, you could start doing it there. However, it's pretty rare
that you'll have that big of a leap that you'll want to make.

## Step 3: Pick an isolated piece of the puzzle to move over.

The challenge with these types of issues is that they are often
intertwined, so no specific piece will be absolutely simple.

However, you have to choose a place to start, so start with the place
that's most easy to implement the new changes. This gives you a clear
objective and limits the complexity of what you're trying to do.

In addition, because complexity has a NETWORK EFFECT, starting at the
simplest place exponentially reduces the complexity impact of the
remaining issues, even though the others are notoriously difficult to
crack.

In the product example, choose one specific product to phase out, or
choose a set of products to combine into a single offer.

In the leadership example, choose one department or section of the
company to implement these changes.

This has the added advantage that you will learn lessons from doing it
that can be applied elsewhere.

As you REMOVE a piece from the puzzle, you will EXPONENTIALLY DECREASE
the complexity.

## Step 4: Get x-ray vision into what's REALLY going on.

Here's the thing.

Most complex systems are a black box.

Things go in, things come out, and people aren't sure exactly why or
how, but somehow it works.

One of the best places to start is to start IDENTIFYING what's really
going on. This is NOT about value judgment or best practices. This is
simply about: if this happens, then that happens, what should the
outcome be?

In the product line, you might want x-ray vision into what the product
does, or if it's a course, what the course teaches. Or how much it
sells, etc.

In a leadership role, you may want to start by defining each person's
current responsibilities. For example, you could have them start by
spending a few weeks detailing all of the things that they're involved
in, and summarizing them as part of the process.

*The other fascinating thing about this whole thing is the power of the
subconscious. I've frequently gone off and done other things, come back,
and had the solution in my head. This is becoming shockingly frequent.*

*This is one of the reasons why it's so horrible to be pushing yourself
to the limit, because it gives little or no ability for your
subconscious to work \-- OR for you to connect with Memos about your
work.*

*There\'s a few other keys to this:*

-   *Have a feedback loop built in, so that you know that the changes
    > you're making are working. (equivalent to unit tests)*

-   *Having a way to measure progress. The clearer the better. I think
    > it's helpful to know what % of the way through the plan you are,
    > but in lieu of that, even being able to see where you've come from
    > is huge (like my insertion point spreadsheet)*

-   *When deciding the next big piece to work on, part of the challenge
    > is deciding how to slice and dice it. There are different ways to
    > do it --- you can examine several pieces, then see if there's a
    > pattern there that can be deduced. The other thing, sometimes
    > there are logical breaks or divisions. You might have to carve off
    > pieces multiple times to get to where you need to go.*

-   *When you identify an aberration, one of the best ways to solve it
    > is as a one-off, then see if it's a pattern and apply that pattern
    > to other places*

*Instances:*

-   *I also did this with InvLinkWeb.*

## Step 5: Start eliminating exceptions.

*Here are a few more lessons on the insertion point job. One of them is
that as soon as you run into an exception, isolate and deal with the
exception to standardize it and solve that issue. When you introduce
exceptions into whatever else you\'re trying to do, you dramatically
increase complexity. So isolate the complexity, deal with the exception,
and everything will go faster for you. Now, here\'s the other thing that
I\'ve noticed. For a while, I thought this was just a productivity issue
of not being able to cut to the chase on some of these issues. But I
think there\'s also this element of when you\'re in the swamp land it
can be very disorienting, because you don\'t necessarily know where the
bottom of the swamp is. You don\'t necessarily know what the right path
forward is. So you end up wandering in the swamp, and it feels like
you\'re not necessarily getting momentum or things aren\'t going as well
as you\'d like. But there was a mindset shift for me that when you\'re
in the bottom of the swamp, and you\'re wandering around, and you don\'t
feel like you\'re making progress, it\'s okay. It may be disconcerting,
but it actually can be a very powerful time for you. And it may be more
productive than you know. Maybe the times when I just felt like I\'m
struggling, I\'m just digging around in the bottom of a swamp. Once you
find the bottom of the swamp, there\'s something solid to it. And maybe
that was that feeling especially with this last round of trying to clean
up these section break insertions. I wandered around for a while and all
of a sudden, it was like I hit pay dirt and everything started coming
together. These are my thoughts on that. super fascinating.*

*There\'s another dynamic to the whole troubleshooting process, which is
the whole concept of debugging. There are some things that you can only
catch in real time that you can\'t see any other way. One example of
this is the nuances of how people relate with each other, or the nuances
of people\'s emotions or responses in the situation. Another aspect is
that people rarely remember all the actual details. When you\'re
watching real time, you can observe the facts. If you understand what
facts and details you\'re looking for, you can actually observe them
when you need them. Whereas after the fact the only thing that you can
really, truly be certain about is the outcome that you\'ve achieved. So
that\'s why having somebody accompany you through the process can be
such a critical piece of it. It\'s also why it\'s so much more valuable
to watch something in real time. It\'s also one of the reasons why
planning can be problematic because planning predicts but planning is
still not real time. And there\'s some things that can only be
determined and fixed in real time. There\'s some things that cannot be
fully determined beforehand by planning because there\'s other variables
but when you\'re in real time, all those other variables are playing a
part.*

Once you get the x-ray vision into what's going on, you can start making
clear, sensible adjustments without anything falling through the cracks.

Here's one of the reasons this is important. Sometimes, you can make
changes by completely stopping the show, then restarting again. However,
this comes at a big risk:

1.  Your new approach isn't guaranteed to approach

2.  You have dramatic downtime in the process

By taking incremental shifts, you can test your changes as you go and
minimize disruption during the process. Again, there are some times when
it's best to completely revamp things (and no, I'm not sure when that
is), but you're not afforded that in every situation.

When you identify a change that will be potentially disruptive, it
allows you to build safeguards around that.

## Step 6: Finalize the transition

As you continue making the small changes, you'll find that the big leap
(while still being a leap) is actually not as difficult as you first
imagined.

One of the best ways to find additional problems is simply by "staging"
the transition, and you'll find remaining unresolved issues.

However, if all of those gotchas have been cleaned up, it's an easy
shift.

## Recap: Toolsets

Here are the common places people get stuck:

1.  They don't have a clear picture of how it should look.

2.  They try to transition the WRONG THING (they've mis-identified the
    > simplest item)

3.  They try to transition MORE than just an isolated portion,

4.  They don't have TRANSPARENCY into what's really going on now

If you're stuck, you should review this list and determine which one at
fault.
