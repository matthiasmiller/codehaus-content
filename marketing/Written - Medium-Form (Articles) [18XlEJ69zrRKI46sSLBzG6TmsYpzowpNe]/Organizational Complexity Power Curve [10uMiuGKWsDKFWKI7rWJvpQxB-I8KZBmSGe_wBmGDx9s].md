Practical Questions,,,,,,,,
- How far can I scale with the current management structure?,,,,,,,,
- How much margin will I need to create to scale to the next management structure?,,,,,,,,
- How many direct reports will I need ,,,,,,,,
- What is the management efficiency?,,,,,,,,
"- WHat is a manager's output, relative to the work created in that department?",,,,,,,,
- How many management layers do I need to support a certain level of work output?,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
- This is why you can't reasonably support more than 9 people -- something happens when you slip into a 90/10 system,,,,,,,,
-This is also why you need high margins to scale early,,,,,,,,
"- Given X number of workers and X number of direct reports, how many managers / management layers do we need?",,,,,,,,
