# For the LADIES..

For the LADIES...  
If your husband is overworking &  
not paying attention to you or your kids...  
It's NOT time for you to shut up, give up, or disappear.  
I don't know whether this makes me the LEAST qualified...  
Or the MOST...  
But it really doesn't matter.  
It just needs to be said.  
The first year of our marriage, I worked as an independent contractor. I landed in business completely by accident.  
I've been in stress before and since...  
But it was probably one of the most stressful times of my life.  
Four months after we got married,  
At a home-cooked dinner with my newlywed bride on her birthday  
I was so red-lined with stress  
that I left her sitting at the table &   
went to bed.  
Difficult to recount, but true.  
The \# of hours were fine.  
The level of stress wasn't.  
Overwork at its finest.  
Talk about a low moment.  
Fast forward 10 years.  
I'd taken on the biggest client of my life.  
Stopped working out.  
Difficult situations in my personal life...  
Couldn't see my path through them.  
One day, I stood across from my wife at our kitchen counter.  
She looked me in the eye and told me,  
"You need to get into therapy"  
WARNING:  
Not all therapists are created equal.  
But I was fortunate to have great people in my network.  
I got a brilliant referral that was perfect for me.  
I'd done a lot of personal and professional development along the way.  
I had learned to work 5 days a week, not 6\.  
But this went event deeper.  
I started getting to the root of a lot of dysfunction  
personally,  
in business,  
in family life,  
in marriage.  
Things I had never recognized before as 'not normal'.  
Yes, I'm far from perfect husband...  
(Ask my wife lol)  
Yes, still days I want to check out...  
But I'm grateful for the work I've done to clean up the root issues that keep me from showing up the way that I want.  
And I think  
I'm seeing progress.  
So if you're a LADY and your man is burying himself in work...  
Know this...  
It's an easy place for us men to hide.  
And work is an 'accepted addiction'  
It's a 'worthy coping mechanism'  
But it doesn't have to stay there.  
And you don't have to stay emotionally distanced from him.  
I'm not a fan of false hope...  
But do know...  
My life changed because of  
\- an opportune comment  
\- at an opportune time  
from my wife.  
Yes, I had to be willing.  
I had to put in the work.  
But I needed someone to hold up the mirror  
so I could see what was going on.  
Please hear me...  
I'm not telling you to stay in destructive situations...   
But you might be the one he needs to hold up the mirror.  
And if he is,  
don't back down, shut up, or disappear.  
Because whether he likes it or not...  
No matter how it lands in the moment...  
He needs it.  
And of course, when he's ready,  
I'll be happy to introduce him  
to a way of life & business that is 'easy & light'.    
PS \- And for those of you GENTS who broke the rules and read this anyway...  
Take the brave step..  
slay the dragon that's driving the need to overwork.  
Check on your friends to make sure they're okay.  
Get around friends who will make sure you're okay.  
It might be awkward.  
It might be uncomfortable.  
But it beats the alternative.  
Let's be the change.

# The 90/10 Mentorship Blend

MANY MENTORS tell you:  
\- spend 90% of your time doing what I tell you  
\- fill in the last 10% to make it work for you  
THE BEST MENTORS tell you:  
\- spend 90% of your time doing what worked for you  
\- let me help you with the last 10% to get it to work for you  
In a recent consultation with a client about their sales process, it wasn't about ripping it out and replacing it with "a proven process"  
(which by the way, those are ripped off, copied around, fatigued, and more)  
Instead, it was a simple tweak and shift that made them respond with...  
"You've just paid for our call 10X."  
Expertise is always in the nuance.  
And seeing clients win just makes happy...

# “WHAT IF I’M NOT LOOKING TO SCALE?”

“WHAT IF I’M NOT LOOKING TO SCALE?”  
Growth is not the only thing I focus on…  
In fact, it’s not what I start with.  
It’s always:  
\- what do you /really/ want?  
\- what’s getting in your way?  
Every business goes through cycles:  
\- growth  
\- disruption  
\- stabilization  
Growth might not be your goal.  
In fact, growth might be the worse thing for you to do.  
Your approach might not be as dramatic as me…  
Killing off an entire (major) line of business.   
But then, it might.    
It might also just be as simple as:  
\- taking things off your plate  
\- making things more efficient  
\- helping you stabilize  
I spent quite a few years specifically in ops, putting systems, processes, and infrastructure in place. And with AI, all that becomes significantly easier.  
Most folks struggle to wrap their heads around what in do…  
Which is why I’ve been doubling down on  
stories from my day to day life  
AND, finding new ways to actually explain what I do and how I do it  
In the meantime…  
This question came up,  
And I thought I should answer it.

# ADDICTED TO DOING THINGS THE HARD WAY 

ADDICTED TO DOING THINGS THE HARD WAY   
One of the terrible things about poverty & a struggling start...  
You get used to the bitter taste of defeat in your mouth.  
All kinds of statements get fed to us:  
\- life is hard   
\- life is a struggle  
\- tough to get by  
\- you've got to work for what you get  
Listen to me very carefully...  
We'd never believe these things  
if there weren't a bit of truth in it  
But the folks I see struggling have taken it to a new level  
You get accustomed to your pain   
For many, hard work & struggle is an easier addiction than  
\*\*insert your vice of choice\*\*  
But it numbs your senses  
It keeps you circling back around the same thing  
Sometimes, it takes someone boldly but kindly prying your fingers from the things you've gripped so tightly  
And it's only in the letting go...  
That you can embrace something new.  
I've found that when we've obsessed over a thing that's hard...  
We grit our teeth  
Focus all our mental energy on getting through it  
And on surviving  
We often miss the easy way  
And most people want to trust that there's a path that's "easy and light" AFTER they've put in the work...  
I'm going to grit my teeth..  
And wait until it gets better.  
Can I let you in on a little secret?  
The people who've gone far down that road  
have experienced heartache  
in some of the most precious parts of life.  
Sometimes the first step through a business challenging is taking a breath...  
leaning back...  
letting go...  
yep, taking a nap...  
And seeing new options emerge.  
Business is not a classroom  
where someone else sets the rules  
& there's only 1 right answer  
Many times,  
there are several...  
maybe even thousands...  
of ways to get to where you want to go  
But you'll never find them when your work is nothing but struggle...

# For the past 6 months, these speakers have been playing quiet instrumental worship music nonstop in my office.

For the past 6 months, these speakers have been playing quiet instrumental worship music nonstop in my office.  
Since doing this and making other adjustments to my office space, I had to stop and reflect this past week on the level of ease I’ve been experiencing with client and personal projects.  
I’ve been experiencing a deeper peace and more insights in my work…  
Just gonna say it again…  
If Jesus says, “my yoke is easy and my burden is light”…  
It’s gotta look like something\!

# LINEAR vs ORBITAL MARKETING 

LINEAR vs ORBITAL MARKETING   
Linear marketing \= for simple, straightforward offers   
\- find a hungry audience  
\- filter them based on need  
\- make an offer  
\- overcome objections  
\- get them to buy  
\- measure/test/improve   
Straight line from A to Z  
\*\*\*  
Orbital marketing \= for complex, multidimensional offers  
\- not a 'sales funnel' but a 'universe or planet'  
\- works by 'gravity and attraction', not 'offer or persuasion'  
\- starts with breadcrumbs & expanding scope  
\- find the opportunity & capitalize on it; rinse & repeat  
\- works by values alignment vs. problem alignment  
\*\*\*  
If there's any question, I fall smack dab in the latter...  
I've had all kinds of labels slapped on me...  
most of them good   
some of them bad lol  
I'm too stubborn  
& too easily bored  
to be shoved into a specific box  
Might change in the future  
But not right away  
AND, for those of you who've struggled to know where I fit & what I do, good news is this...  
I've been finding better & better ways to articulate this..  
In the meantime, everything I do is to give you a glimpse into what life is like within my 'universe or planet'.  
PS \- I thought I'd give you guys my 'seriously listening' face    
PSS \- no, if you have to ask, I already know the world doesn't revolve around me lol

# MANAGING EXPECTATIONS W/ VENDORS & CONTRACTORS

MANAGING EXPECTATIONS W/ VENDORS & CONTRACTORS  
In my experience, primarily two kinds of engagements:  
\- advisory  
\- execution/delivery  
Some companies do one, the other, or both.  
An advisory engagement is simple. "Here is my situation. Tell me what to do." Examples are:  
\- website review (i.e. for conversion optimization)  
\- Facebook/Google audit  
\- tax strategy  
\- strategy consulting   
\- software design/prototyping  
\- building design / architecture  
\- etc  
Lots more examples, I'm sure.  
This is simple: get expert advice on what you should do. Most times, it's just a matter of giving them thorough access & deep visibility, and let them tell you whatever they deem necessary.  
\*\*  
Execution is a different animal. In this case, you've got clear deliverables.  
\- need these N changes created/tested on our website  
\- same thing, but for your advertising  
\- build the building in this blueprint  
\- software tool that does X, Y, and Z  
\- N kinds of widget X delivered by Z timeframe (i.e. inventory/product)  
\- etc  
In this case, you need to be explicitly clear on what you're looking for. If you're not sure you've got everything you need to communicate up front, go find someone who can help you fill in the details.  
(The exception is when you're willing to deal with a large amount of variability, either in budget, scope, or quality. More on this later.)   
When the project is delivered, it's as simple as reviewing what you asked for & seeing if you got it. And if not, you've got a simple way to keep your contractor accountable for what the promised. Because you have it in writing, right?  
(If you are a service provider who takes on projects without putting some of these things in place, you're burning through $$$ in a very painful way, by the way. You're underselling. You're undercharging.)  
\*\*  
Even if the same company is doing both, I can't think of any situation where these two lines have been blurred and it's been a great experience.  
i.e. worst case scenario:  
Do you really want someone building a house, then circling back in 6 months and $600K+ later, to find out if they built you what they wanted?  
And the people who do both in a seamless way have at least /internally/ teased these two pieces apart. Even in an agile approach (jumping back & forth between the two), you still have clear distinction between these "what to do" and the "doing it". You still have clear expectations, even when they're continually recalibrated.  
\*\*  
No harm in not knowing all the specifics of what you're outsourcing.  
BUT, if you're hiring someone to execute & you've got no way to measure the outcome or pressure-test the deliverable...  
Watch out\!  
And if your contractor is any good, they'll push back on scope creep and tell you kindly but firmly that you had uncommunicated expectations, and that they'll be happy to meet them once you agree what that should look like & you pay the appropriate $ amount  
I don't care /that/ much if you're talented or not, as long as you can:  
\- deliver what you promised  
\- on the timeline that you promised  
\- barring any disruptions outside your control   
\- and I don't have to help you problem solve things in your scope  
QA isn't my favorite, but at the same time...  
I really don't mind holding folks accountable to what they promised.  
Clear communication.  
Clear expectations.  
Clear boundaries.  
Clear accountability.  
Management still makes money.  
PS \- if you're a service provider, you do well to read & ingest this. Implement some of this & you've got a shot at winning over clients w/ your customer experience. This is part of the 'underpinning' of why it matters so much to overpromise & underdeliver.  
PSS \- I'm cleaning up an mess for a client of mine, so if they're reading this, yep \-- I've experienced a ripple effect of me breaking some of my own rules. Always, always, always...room to level up.

# FUN FRIDAY FACT: personality assessments show you how you see yourself, but they may not show who you were created to be

FUN FRIDAY FACT: personality assessments show you how you see yourself, but they may not show who you were created to be  
CASE IN POINT: Little Jonny stands quietly in the corner & doesn't voice his opinion. "Oh, he's an introvert," they say.  
But what they don't know is that Little Jonny was the youngest of 4 brothers. And whenever Little Jonny tried to express his opinion, he got run over by his dad, his mom, or one of his brothers. Little Jonny was left to pick up the pieces.  
Today, Little Jonny has crawled inside himself, and can barely bring himself to engage with other people because of how he's been conditioned to respond.  
So...  
Is Little Jonny an introvert?  
Or was he conditioned to respond,  
And when people observed his behavior,  
They just assumed introversion?  
PS \- Little Jonny is a made up person lol. But to be fair, this is derived from real-life conversations with friends of mine.... so ya know, creative extrapolation.

# the skeptic paid me money, then he told me...

"I was skeptical when you talked about offline marketing in your email. But as we're talking about it, I'm realizing that's where my customers are at."  
\- Quote from a private consult with a business owner  
In this case, digital channels are working, and well worth continuing to run. However, they're not reaching the entire market.  
A substantial part of the market looks to be pretty easily reachable elsewhere, and it's 100% worth putting money to the test.  
(Cue some Marketing Gooroo: "Oh, everyone you need is on Facebook. You just need to \_\_\_\_\_...")  
One of the favorite things about restructuring my business at the beginning of the year was the freedom to completely let go of incentive to encourage clients to move in any direction that wasn't absolutely the best for them...  
My favorite thing from this consult?  
This owner had some brilliant 'goodwill' offers to include in his offline marketing...  
Sometimes as business owners, we feel insecure in embracing values-aligned sales and marketing. And while sometimes these are 'money blocks', sometimes these values are exactly what drives success in the specific market we're in.  
If it's clear that clients can win like this, I love nothing better than affirming business owners in values-aligned sales & marketing. Do more of what already works, and add fuel to the fire of what they're already doing\!

# \>\> weight lifted off her shoulders

\>\> weight lifted off her shoulders  
For my business owner friends feeling the burden of overwork...  
Jesus said, "My yoke is easy. My burden is light." But what does this look like in PRACTICE?  
I recently had a consultation with a business owner. I've changed the details.  
She's burning the candle at both ends. Some weeks, she's so overwhelmed & her brain is so fried from all the responsibilities that she doesn't have space to think.  
(This is a difficult & dangerous place to be. You need to FORCIBLY create space to break free from the current level you're at, or you'll always be on the same hamster wheel. This is one of the big battles I've had to face, and it's one of the big things I fight for with overworked clients.)  
We started walking through the current issues she's wrestling with in her business.  
A few things that turned up:  
1\. Permission reaffirmed (NOT granted, it was there) to build this business any way she pleases. I flipped a few of her advisory questions ("What would do you?") back into "What do you want?" and "What would you instinctively do?"  
It's not that specifics don't matter, but more often than not, there are 100 ways to get to your destination. Do it in the way you are GOING to do it. Not the way you "should but won't" do it.  
2\. She got clear on the \#1 thing that she loves about her role (and is extremely skilled out), giving her permission to hand off everything else.  
3\. We found a simple way to turn up lead flow to make sure business doesn't drop w/ lower focus during a sprint season   
4\. She kicked off a conversation to delegate 2 of the most mentally-draining responsibilities  
NOTE: Mental drain has an exaggerated impact at higher levels of impact. Sometimes it's those 5-minute tasks or 30-minute conversations that cost you 4 hours of productive energy.  
Net result?  
A feeling of relief that was so tangible you could feel it on the call.  
Easy yoke &  
Light burden is NOT just a lofty ideal.  
It can be a practical reality.  
BUT,  
it requires a willingness to embrace it.  
Will you join me?  
From one friend to another,  
Matthias   
PS: Yep, sometimes I take my calls outdoors\!

# The One Secret to Success I've Never Discussed 👇 (at your own risk)

PART 1--  
If you've been following me for a while, you know that I've been speaking pretty openly about the problems I solve & my perspective on business.  
Earlier this year, I made an intentional decision to stop holding back. But there's one secret to my success I've never discussed.  
\>\> WARNING: Continue at your own risk. \<\<  
You might disagree.  
You might think you've wrapped your head around it.  
You might dismiss it.  
If you're open, I invite you to listen in...  
It's quite simple:  
It's Jesus.  
It's friendship with God.  
For most of my career, I've shut up about that side of my life. I've heard too many statements like:  
\- "The only people who screwed me were 'churchgoers'."  
\- "If a salesperson says 'the Lord blessed me', put your hand on your wallet and run."  
\- AND, I've both seen and experienced these situations up-close. I want nothing to do with them.  
And yet...  
Yesterday, one of my spiritual advisors looked me in the eye and told me, "If there's a counterfeit, there has be a real. You're the real thing. Be the real thing." And for the first time in a VERY long time, I finally felt free to talk about this    
Trust me...  
I won't get bent out of shape if you're not on the same page.  
Just forgive me when I'm off 'talking to myself' LOL  
But I'd be a liar if I didn't say...  
Not a chance I'd be here if it weren't for that.  
This is more than an ideology.  
This is more than principles.  
This is more than culture.  
This is more than identity.  
This is more than 'church'.  
This is a PERSON.  
Power does not come from principles.  
It does not come from an ideology.  
In fact, a lot of things are taught as "Christian"...  
...when it's little more than a HUMANISTIC RELIGION.  
And it's destroyed a lot of people.  
Jesus never had trouble with the devil.  
He got killed because of the Religious Leaders.  
(PS \- what makes you think you’ll escape them if Jesus didn’t?)  
So when I tell you some of that stuff is dark,  
I'm not messing around.  
(see Part 2\)  
PART 2--  
So what does "FRIENDSHIP WITH GOD" really mean?  
It means letting go of the safety nets.  
It means letting go of self-protection.  
It means letting PRAYER be the foundation.  
It means letting CONNECTION be the foundation.  
It means moving from WORKING to WALKING.  
It means allowing your SPIRIT to be stronger than your HEART or MIND.  
It means letting go of YOUR agenda and getting onto GOD's.  
And when you've built most of your life on humanistic thinking...  
It means slowly, carefully, surgically disassembling much of it...  
And descending the mountain you've been climbing...  
Going through the valley...  
So you can get onto the mountain He's got you for.  
I've had religious leaders look me square in the eye and tell me, "I'm not ready to do that." (Then what are they doing??)  
I know...  
It's painful.  
It's scary.  
I also know it's worth it\!  
Meanwhile...  
I've had to unlearn much of what I thought about 'prayer'...  
...to understand a friendship with God that shakes the world.  
I've got story after story of ways that God has divinely orchestrated:  
\- deals  
\- relationships  
\- finances  
\- timing  
\- and more  
When I was in startup mode, investing deeply into growth, pushing myself to the edge, waiting for big checks to land... (not recommended)... He saw me through every single step.  
When I took an \~80% revenue cut that I wasn't really prepared for, He guided me through that.  
When I hired a team member that I shouldn't have, He woke up me up one morning with a thought so loud it could have been a stage whisper. "Fire \_\_\_\_." If I had kept that employee, I would have tanked my business.  
He routinely gives insights when I'm working with clients that do not fall into the realms of 'rational logic'.  
He's brought clients to my door when I really had no other marketing plan.  
Listen...  
I'd like to think I'm a smart guy...  
I'd like you all to think that too LOL  
But I don't see & predict all situations.  
I've learned (and keep learning) to bring decisions to Him \-- because He sees things I don't.  
And as I've continued to grow in this friendship, I've found myself spending so much more of time my time in this place of His peace, real love & acceptance, and tangible presence.  
Can I be honest?  
Having been an insecure, hardworking, lonely, desperate person...  
..that it feels GOOD to be in that place??  
It's made it far easier to:  
\- work on my true priorities  
\- let go of overwork  
\- rest  
\- be more productive  
\- get in the groove of who I'm supposed to be  
\- make grounded & wise decisions  
Yes, I love:  
\- motivation  
\- working to strengths  
\- smart business moves  
But what has really amplified it all?  
It's been friendship with God.  
You can win everywhere else.  
But without it, you've got nothing.  
Who am I?  
I am a friend of God.  
I am a friend of you.  
I’m here to help you find friendship with God while you win in business.  
Will you join me?

# Pros & Cons of learning from INDUSTRY EXPERTS 👇

"Should I stick to learning just from my INDUSTRY EXPERTS?"  
Not a right and wrong here.  
Just depends on your goal.  
And it may be more nuanced than you think  
Pros:  
\- learn proven tricks of the trade  
\- 'copy and paste' from success  
\- have people who speak your language  
Cons:  
\- exponential shifts come outside your industry  
\- easy to live in an echo chamber  
\- easy to accept the industry as 'normal' or 'the way things are'  
I don't think it would be possible for me to get the results that I have if I were not multi-faceted, diversely skilled, with exposure to different industries.  
For example...  
One of my clients wanted to work with me because of my prior experience within their industry. And I'm sure that was an asset...  
And yet...  
The results that I got specifically came from OUTSIDE the industry.  
Here's why:  
Every industry develops its blind spots. I don't care whether it's:  
\- automotive  
\- realty  
\- construction  
\- tech  
\- marketing agencies  
\- consulting  
\- retail  
The only way to address those blind spots is by going OUTSIDE the industry.  
And when you do, you are no longer in the same arms race, trying to do the same thing better...  
You've got an advantage that puts you a few leaps ahead...  
Remember my post recently about COMPETITION? It fundamentally puts you into the same category.  
Success follows putting yourself into a LEADERSHIP position...including creating categories when necessary.  
The answer might not be either/or.  
The answer might be both/and.  
Dial in steady growth with consistent input from industry expertise.  
But if you want to break from the pack...  
Be willing to throw some gasoline, gunpowder, dynamite, or your explosive agent of choice with the things you discover outside your industry.

# 3 people:

3 people:  
\#1 takes off like a rocket ship  
\#2 has no visible change  
\#3 also has no visible change  
What you can’t see?  
\#1 has no root system to sustain   
\#2 is stagnant  
\#3 is putting down roots  
The statement is often true..  
If you want to grow tall,  
You need good roots.  
Someone asked me today about ROI on my learning.  
Some of it was bad.  
Some of it was quick.  
Some of it will take time but be dramatic.  
Not every big win is now.  
Know the difference between…  
Being in the wrong place  
At the wrong time  
For the wrong thing  
Or  
Just needing to put down roots.  
If you’re not seeing progress,  
But you’re in the right place,  
And you’re putting down roots,  
Then,  
Keep going.  
Your time is coming.  
You’re going to stand tall,  
If you persevere.   
I’m cheering for you\!

# Crazy 2 weeks

Crazy 2 weeks  
Latest opportunities are not clients but partnerships  
Not low 8-figure caps  
But mid 8, or even 9  
With potential bolt-ons for MRR/SaaS value multiplier  
Biggest limits for my clients \= size of their thinking \+ ability to execute  
One of my clients told me to my face, "My one complaint about you is this..."  
(deathly silence)  
"You don't sell yourself hard enough."  
If you're a business looking to grow and scale at any level, yesterday was the best time to start working with me.  
Today is second best.  
Tomorrow might pass you by.  
I've heard folks say (to me & behind my back) they can't afford me. I can't answer that without knowing more about your situation. But I do know this... I have a habit for doing what I'm paid to do.  
And in the times when it's not been the case...  
\- it's been because there were other, bigger issues standing in the way that needed to be fixed first  
\- so that I could get to the thing that I was paid to do  
(Simple logic to figure out what happened to people who hired me to pay for myself in $ back to the owner's pocket.)  
The folks who brought me in as 'leverage' in their business, got a quick & solid return on their investment... even if they choked on the price tag at first.  
And yes, I have a small number of businesses I can't serve because of competitive interests...but that's a small number, & I will let you know.  
I've also heard some folks have held back because they can't wrap their heads around what exactly I do...  
Bottom line, I've been in almost all aspects of business (strategic & tactics, sales & marketing, operations & finance, hiring & firing) across multiple industries, and I've run in some really good circles for a long time...  
I'm a fan of easy...  
Let's just have a simple conversation about what's going on in your business & see if I think I can reasonably help.  
If you'd like to connect over phone, video or coffee, drop me a line.

# I'm a recovering addict...

I'm a recovering addict...  
...of the acceptable (even celebrated) addiction:  
》Overwork  
For years, I struggled to enjoy  
\- Weekends,  
\- Vacations,  
\- Days Off,  
\- Quietness  
Always going.  
Always pushing.  
Always feeling behind.  
Until I started doing The Work.  
Which isn't a Work,  
But a Walk.  
Our family went camping with friends this past weekend. Yes, I've learned a lot about what makes a great camping experience for me.  
But I was surprised how easy it was to leave work behind.  
No racing mind  
No desperately pecking away at a keyboard   
No trying to journal out the plan to the next level  
No worry about the challenges I'd face when I get back.  
Maybe no big deal for many of you.  
But clear signs of growth myself   
The key to overwork is not working less.  
It's killing the hungry dragon that compels you to overwork

# BEYOND THE TOP, pt 0

I heard the applause across the auditorium. Time froze for a moment. For a moment, I felt the world sway around me as I took it all in. This had been the moment I had been waiting for.  
At the same time, I felt a knot in my stomach. A question bubbled up so quietly yet so vividly.  
"Is this all there is?"  
While the rest of my freshman classmates took things in stride, I poured everything I had into my classwork.  
We used a self-paced curriculum. My only limit was myself.  
While the rest of my classmates raced down the basketball court, I hunched over my schoolwork. I regularly skipped break time so that I could push just a little bit harder. I'd keep my eye on the clock, turning up my own urgency to move faster.  
Often after school, I'd duck into the basement, turn on a classical Vivaldi CD, and go for round 2 of my homework.  
And it paid off.  
Every student needed to complete an absolute minimum of 5.25 units to graduate with the most basic diploma.  
That year, I completed 10.5 units of credit.  
I'd 2X'd the minimum.  
Not pulling C's and D's, by the way.  
I can't recall exactly how many B's I pulled..  
I do know that I got A's nearly across the board.  
Today, my classmates, parents, and teachers celebrated that achievement.  
Here I was...  
\- outworking everyone else  
\- outperforming everyone else  
\- and getting the public recognition for it  
I had done everything I thought I should do.  
I had hit the bar I thought I should hit.  
The other students may never have wanted my lifestyle...  
But I knew I was an academic envy.  
I hadn't even considered the financial payoff...  
I had cut my high school career one year shorter,  
Saved my parents a year of private high school tuition,  
And replaced it with a year of solid income.  
Easily a 5-figure payoff.  
Not bad for a 15 year-old kid back then.  
And yet...  
I felt this knot in my stomach.  
I'd done all this.  
I'd achieved an impressive feat.  
I'd gotten the recognition.  
Was this ALL there was?  
For one of the first times, I felt a bitter taste that I would later become familiar with.  
I had climbed to the very top.  
And when I looked up & looked around,  
this haunting question came looking for me.  
"Is this all their is?"  
Maybe you've been there...  
You've climbed to the VERY top...  
Others envy what you have.  
And yet, you have this nagging question...  
"What is BEYOND the top?"  
If so, this series is for you.  
Because I didn't learn my lesson then.  
I didn't know what lesson I needed to learn.  
I just knew that I wanted to get out of school to prove the answer.

# WHAT DOES MATTHIAS DO?

"WHAT DOES MATTHIAS DO?"  
I realize I haven't been completely clear about exactly what I do. I could probably describe it different ways, so let me give me my best shot at breaking it down.... AND THEN, I'm going to ask you for your feedback.  
When you first saw the iPhone, did you think about how elegantly it was designed, how easy it was to use, and how seamlessly everything worked together?  
Love it or hate it... it's what it's been known for.  
NOBODY looks at an iPhone and thinks, I want to understand:  
\- the engineering   
\- the design   
\- the manufacturing  
\- the processor  
\- the battery  
\- the blah  
\- the blah  
\- the BLAH\!  
When people ask me what I do, they expect an answer like, "I make batteries for iPhones."  
In business speak, that would be things like:  
\- I run Google ads  
\- I fix sales teams  
\- I write apps  
\- I make websites  
\- I do taxes  
Then, they get REALLY confused when they find out that I have helped companies:  
\- build out a full BOOK of SOPs & templates  
\- break from 5-figure to 6-figure deal sizes   
\- break sales records month after month  
\- implement 8-figure accounting processes  
\- beat prior marketing with a new campaign  
\- build a team with exceptional job/role fit  
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT\!  
Marketing \+ Sales \+ Operations \+ Finance \+ a touch of HR \= ?\!?\!  
Yep, I literally grew up in business. I signed my dad's paychecks when I was in high school. I've spent 30 years going deep in a lot of different areas of business. I don't know all the details about everything, but I know a lot of details about a lot of things.  
I know what it takes to make an 'iPhone-quality' business. One that:  
\- has growth & momentum  
\- feels at home to the business owner   
\- runs seamlessly  
\- is elegantly designed   
I know how to hunt down the places that will make you money, and help you focus on that, while making it less of a headache, not more.  
Also, I've done a large amount of work for myself around PEOPLE development. I often end up working with my clients in some capacity to help them become the kinds of PEOPLE who can manage what they're moving into.  
Most people do NOT want to know the specifics of exactly how I do everything that I listed above. (Except for my amnesiac readers...but that's different\!) The people I work with primarily want the RESULTS that come from that.  
And because of the depth of my consulting and the types of results that I get for clients, I end up working with non-competing companies.   
THIS DOES NOT FIT MOST PEOPLE'S BOXES.  
Most people want to know whether I:  
\- advise  
\- consult  
\- manage  
\- plan   
\- do   
\- coach   
\- teach  
In almost all cases, it's YES. It's a blend of all of the above, based on what I'm willing to do and what (by professional opinion, not by whim) is necessary to get the results we need.   
Most people want a title for me.  
In fact, nearly everyone in the consulting world tells me to 'niche down, specialize, and scale'. I don't want to do that. I want to find scale-worthy companies and help them grow.  
It drives some people crazy that I don't have a title. If you absolutely must have a term for it, the closest I've gotten to has been:  
\>\> Comprehensive Business Consulting \<\<  
Never knowing everything.  
Never perfect.  
Never done  
Always learning.  
Always growing.  
Always bringing my best.  
Always looking to bring returns.  
That's me.  
If you're building after an Android-style business, no harm. I might not be your jam. But if you're looking for an iPhone-style business that runs smoothly, makes good money, and continues to grow...  
...whether we work together or not...  
...I'd love to chat.  
PS \- The question I promised...  
Does this explanation of what I do make sense to you?

"NO" is one of the most powerful 80/20 words, but many people can't deal with the tension between the "NO" and the "YES"

# Just another slight rant for you guys  

Just another slight rant for you guys  

I keep seeing folks slow down their progress because they 'can't afford' help or expert advise. This is NOT a sales pitch \- it's a lifeline to folks who are struggling more than they should, given their expertise & good-heartedness.

I think few things are more expensive than the opportunity cost of 'not knowing what you're doing'. Or, of not seeing the opportunity right in front of you. Or worse, fainting before the finish line, or chickening out at the moment of triumph.

One of the biggest reasons people don't make these kinds of investments? Your lizard brain wants to keep you safe, and your rational brain doesn't have any way to justify these kinds of investment.

(BTW, some folks use intimidation & fear around opportunity cost etc to pressure people into buying like this. RUN from those folks. It's nothing but a train wreck.)

On evening when I was feeling particularly grouchy, I complained to my wife about how much I was spending in mentorship. We had food on the table & a roof over our head. I'd been on a steady path of becoming a better husband & father (still have a ways to go yet\!). I'd been seeing steady progress in the business. BUT, some of the checks made me wince...

She asked me, "Well, is it going to pay off?"

I didn't have to think twice.

100X yes.

BUT...my lizard brain wanted to keep me safe. Most of us love having investments that go like this:

\- $100k asset

\- Acquirable for 10% of asset cost

\- Generates returns of $12% / yr

\- Payoff in \_\_\_\_ yrs (\*\*too lazy for the maths lol)

OR a mentorship / coaching program that goes like this:

\- Here's the paint-by-numbers

\- 1000s of people have done this successfully

\- If you follow the process it will work

Ironically, some of us like to be beaten up and told what horrible people we are, and if we'd just get off our seat and into action and massively execute, we'd solve our problems.

(All lies. It's dysfunction. Again, RUN.)

So I get the hesitation...

I've made a lot of mistakes along the way.

I've made invested into mentorships that were misaligned at best, unethical (or even illegal at worst \-- other story lol). I've also hung onto mentorships WAY past their useful life.

Good news? I learned a thing or two about how to value 'intangible' business investments, and you can learn a thing or two.

Here's how I value these things:

\>\> Do the people share enough of my values that I'll be able to execute on the advice I'm given?

I've been in some pretty toxic coaching environments. Those have ALWAYS gone horribly because they needed me to listen to them for their ego, success rates, and retention/upsells. I needed to ignore them for moral & LEGAL reasons.

(Yep, I had a coaching program early on that blatantly told me to break the law as part of a 6-figure sprint, and got made when I refused. Suddenly I was the problem\!)

\>\> Does this mentorship seek to conform me to THEIR ideal, or does it create space to embrace my current & future TRUE SELF?

Conforming to others' ideals is a short road to self-sabotage, and it's expensive. Just heard of an owner sitting on a multi-$MM deal, but tapping the brakes because he doesn't feel free to show up as his true self.

\>\> Does this mentorship use shame, intimidation, gaslighting, and ego flexes to motivate their people? (see values)

Do I need to explain this one?\!

\>\> Can this mentorship help me avoid a knuckle-headed decision that would cost way more than the fee?

THIS is one of the best ways. It's far easier to have wise folks poke holes it your idea, than burning a hole in your pocketbook with a dumb idea.

\>\> Can I live with a 12-month experiment on this, if nothing but the lessons of who I should or shouldn't listen to?

If you can't, you should go seek out SOMETHING that you can afford to take a risk on.

\>\> Once I've done those 12 months, if I've experienced growth through this past year, what's the likelihood I would have experienced it without this mentorship?

Most times, there were critical points of failure. "If I hadn't had this conversation with "Grandma B", and if my colleagues wouldn't have lovingly but strongly challenged me, would I have gotten to where I am?"

\>\> Does this put me around the types of people who, through a hallway conversation, can give me insights that can unlock another level of growth in the business, fulfillment for myself, or some itch that I've been trying to scratch for years?

Inspiration is powerful, my friend. I love the friends of mine that I can jam with for no business reason, but it's one of the most insightful, invigorating types of conversations.

\>\> Does this person/group have a history of helping people who I'd enjoy hanging out with?

Nope, they can't help everyone. But if they've got a track record of success with people you'd like to hang out with...what are you waiting on?

\>\> What's the likelihood that this will put me in touch with people who can make more $, either as a partner or client?

Just a heads up...

Partnering or serving people who pay $ to avoid knuckle-headed decisions is WAY better than the alternative.

\>\> Can this mentorship grow with me?

If not, you'd better jump in & get right back out. Or maybe, never get in at all\!

BOTTOM LINE:

Once you've checked some basic boxes, the biggest thing you need to do is stop figuring out HOW it's going to pay for itself. Just make sure you're comfortable enough with the cash flow. And figure it out well enough that your rational brain can justify it.

I remember the first time I paid $3000 for a 1-hour consult. I practically soiled my pants. "Will my Zoom connection work? What if my Internet drops? Will I get my value? Will I know what questions to ask? Will I be able to make the most of it?"

I don't remember all the specifics of that call, but I remember that call gave me a single mindset shift that I still use and still return to today. It's a principle of success that I use when I work with clients, and it's saved me 10X what I paid for the call.

I used this to answer a question in a private group, and one of the veterans chimed in with, "This is advice that EVERYONE should be following, no matter how long you've been in business."

That's the VALUE of good mentorship.

So...

You on the fence?

Check the boxes.

Calculate the downside & upside.

Figure out how to cash flow \+ justify it.

Then get on with your game.

This is NOT a sales pitch to work with me.

I might not be the right person for you to work with.

I'm just sick of people staying stuck.

I can offer a lifeline, but I can't help you grab it.

The rest is up to you.

GO, GO, GO\!

# a brief 'screwtape letters' on vision & leadership...

I had 9 minutes before my next call, so here you go\!

If you're a visionary, here's a play by play on how to ruin vision for the folks around you....

1. Hang onto unresolved trauma and insecurity. Let it guide your decisions.

\- Look outside of yourself for the latest shiny object.

\- Whenever someone suggests an idea, take it and run with it, even if you don't believe in it.

2\. Verbally process as broadly as humanly possible.

\- If you're in a staff meeting, talk about changes that could completely disrupt their worlds.

\- If you don't have buy-in from the team, drop a comment about what you plan to do.

\- Do it just enough that you force their hand, but not enough that anyone can call you out on your motives.

3\. Stop as many things as you can in their tracks.

\- Get people amped up and excited running in one direction, then redirect all their energy in a different direction.

It doesn't matter if they're motivated by wrapping things up & completing them. Keeping them on their heels makes it an exciting ride.

Plus, it makes it that much harder for them to form a coup against you.

4\. Make it an exciting place to recruit into.

The healthy people will leave, so you'll have to have a way to replace them. Make it an exciting place for people to come to.

It takes unsuspecting folks a good bit of time to figure out what's going on. If you can lengthen it, great. If not, just make sure you've got a good recruiting pipeline.

5\. Capitalize on the short time people are there.

Since people will only be there for a short time, work them as hard as you reasonably can. They're going to leave anyway, so make the most of it.

No need to pay too much attention to their skillsets, interests, or aptitude. Again, just make sure they stay excited and get the job done.

6\. Build a strong sense of loyalty, especially to things that don't work.

Loyal people are...loyal. And when you get them emotionally attached to something that doesn't work, they'll give their lives to figuring out a way to make it work.

You want them to feel progress. But if you find them getting too close to something that actually works, you need to find a way to sabotage what they're doing.

Change the requirements.

Change the direction.

PS \- If you are in an environment like this, please reach out to someone for help. You deserve better.

PSS \- This does NOT apply to healthy organizations that are in a form of transition or change. Post coming on how to navigate the unknown in these cases.

# "I don't know what my vision is, and the word 'vision' has been ruined by past experienced."

"I don't know what my vision is, and the word 'vision' has been ruined by past experienced."

Fair enough...

And while you're sorting through that, consider this...

All that you're really after is an ideal world.

What is noticeably present?

What is noticeably absent?

Some folks will pressure you to spell out all kinds of detail...

But if certain details don't matter to you,

Why force yourself to spell it out?

Most of us have relegated vision down to a very, very small circle, thanks to the wonderful leadership consultants & coaches who encourage us to think this way.

I'm grateful for them..

I think just think it's incomplete.

During our conversation, a sketched out an early version of this.

I can't call it the 5 Levels of Leadership because, well..

That's already taken by some guy named John lol

BUT, let's walk through this.

Many of us start our leadership journey with SURVIVAL. Nothing else is working. We're at rock bottom. We've got to figure out how to make it work. It's focused on our NEED.

Then, we discover that setting goals can help us stay on track with what want. We set GOALS. We double down on ACHIEVEMENT.

And then, this magical moment when we unlock this thing called 'leadership'. We discover how to sell a picture of the future, and we call it a VISION. We sell people on an opportunity, get them hyped, and bring them along.

However, this breaks down...

Just to be completely blunt, not every vision deserves to see the light of day.

Go watch Shark Tank or American Idol and find out how some of these visionaries fared.

(I rest my case.)

And if you are good at selling visions that aren't feasible or can't be executed upon, you're going to burn your people out.

For me, that's when I left most of the conventional leadership advice aside. Fortunately, I had the chance to learn not merely about opportunity but about investment-level thinking, strategy, and finding effective paths forward that actually WORKED.

And I lived there for quite a few years. It was a good place.

But it wasn't the BEST place. I hired a few mentors (working one-on-one) to start sifting through what was going on. Each one attacked the problem from a different angle.

That's when I started tapping into a completely new level of leadership and living for myself.

INSPIRATION.

Your world will shift when you no longer start living for the future, living for what works, but you start living INSPIRED.

And something changes when you stop surrounding yourself with people based on what they can DO. Instead, you surround them for who they ARE.

And you shape them into healthier versions of themselves...

Not a CULT,

But a cultURE.

Their values.

Their habits.

Their language.

Their experiences.

This is the place where you can let go of a lot of specifics.

You can even let go of a lot of generalities.

Build the culture & protect the culture.

Then bring in OTHERS for the strategy, vision, and more.

For some leaders, the specific details of the growth plan matter less. But their ideal world has lots of specific detail around the culture, the people, and the enviromnent that they create.

Can I be bold enough to say...

That's not only 'vision'

But it's more powerful than conventional 'vision'?

I'm not alone here, by the way. Folks much smarter than myself have emphasized this. As Drucker famously said, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."

Many of us have never been in an environment where the culture was strong enough & healthy enough \-- and with the necessary subcomponents \-- to create this positive momentum.

But I bet if you stepped into it, you'd never want to leave.

The question I have for you is...

Where are you on this journey?

And what's the next step for you?

# With a little plot twist to my UNQUALIFIED series...

With a little plot twist to my UNQUALIFIED series...  
Last Wednesday, I got to grab a photo with a man whose name, perhaps more than any other, is synonymous with 'leadership'.  
This may be more honest than I care to be, but...  
Years ago, I binged on John Maxwell's content. Between moving away from those environments I'd been in, and seeking more intellectually challenging content, I haven't paid much attention to him over the last number of years.  
I've also been around enough 'celebrity influencers' who've ridden an economic wave to become 'Godfluencers' to know: all that glitters is not gold.  
So suffice it to say, I was open but skeptical...  
(Yep, sometimes I wish I wouldn't be this honest lol.)  
But then, if the guy coaches Fortune 50 CEOs, has a lengthy waiting list with international prime ministers & presidents, and more...give the guy a break lol  
He touched on some brilliant insights, such as:  
\- how to disqualify prospects that 99% of the world would be dying to work with (brilliantly executed at his level)  
\- how to use the 80/20 of the 80/20 to create cascaded influential changes  
\- the unstoppable nature of well-packaged fundamental principles that actually work  
\- the impact of fragmentation on our current work cultures  
But what resonated most deeply was the message of his life:  
\- his unassuming manner  
\- his brilliant communication  
\- his deep understanding of people & culture  
\- his commitment to making faith conversations follow results & having them by invitation-only   
Whether or not I'll get back to binging on his content, I don't know...  
But I do know the profound impact of spending an afternoon with him and 200 other leaders as he pulled back the curtain on how he lives his life...  
A great postscript to the UNQUALIFIED series\!

# what I wish everyone knew about problem solving & troubleshooting...

When people first start working with me, they often make general statements like, "This isn't working."

OK sure, but:

\- what's not working?

\- what is happening?

\- what should be happening?

\- (if appropriate) why do you think it's happening?

Not trying to be rude..

Just managing bandwidth..

Just triaging priorities..

If you can't give me 3 minutes to capture the real problem, it's probably not worth my energy to look for a solution.

This has a broad application:

\- technical issues

\- personnel issues

\- process issues

PERSONNEL \--

"It's not working out with Joey. We should fire him."

OK, maybe\! But..

\- what's not working?

\- what is happening?

\- what should be happening?

Oh, and does Joey know the above information? If so, what's the real reason Joey isn't doing what he needs?

\- do you expect Joey to care about things he doesn't naturally care about?

\- do you expect Joey to act in a way that's stressful and unnatural?

\- or does Joey simply not care?

It might be Joey's responsibility to perform...

But it was YOUR responsibility to fill the role w/ the right person.

TECHNICAL \--

"These automations aren't working."

"Great, can you give me an example?"

"No, because I just blow past it."

"No problem. When you can give me something specific to go on, we'll take a look."

PROCESS \--

"We keep having problems with our employee time sheets."

"OK, great. What's the problem?"

"I don't know, I just hear complaints about it from the employees and from the accountant."

"Wanna go have a chat with them to find out?"

Pretty sure it'll be an easy solve once you actually find out WHAT the issue is, and you take the time to get to the root of it...

THE 2 WAYS to get STUCK:

How to get stuck 101:

1 \- Overthinking means getting stuck in your head, overanalyzing, waiting to pull the trigger when you've 80% or more of the information you need.

2 \- Underthinking means making an emotional decision when you've got the non-critical 20% of information, and you haven't gotten to the root of it issue

It's often surprising how easily the solution is when you properly diagnose first.

And one of the sources of pride is when I have clients who...like one of my star estudiantes...who sent me an email clearly answering the above questions. My reward? A prompt, decisive solution.

# candor in sales \-- and why if they don't bring it, you should...

I've been in a few sales conversations over the past few months that have been misleading at best, manipulative at worst.

EXAMPLE 1

I got a message from someone I sorta know saying, "Hey, I want to show you how to get your content in front of a lot more people for free." Because I kinda know the person I thought, "Sure, why not?"

On the call, the conversation moved quickly into, "How much revenue are you making?" I know how this person's been trained in sales. I can predict where this is going.

I stop the conversation. I called them out on whether I was actually a fit for their service, first.

They agreed I wasn't.

And they never fulfilled on the promise that got me on the call.

EXAMPLE 2

Someone's looking to book podcast guests. Again, someone I'm loosely connected with, so the trust factor's slightly higher than normal.

I get on the 15-minute call, we chat for a few minutes, and I hear:

"I'm looking for experts. You're not an expert." Sure thing lolol

Then the conversation shifted:

"My audience doesn't want you as a podcast guest, but \[after catching wind of something I mentioned\] you would be a good fit for this program over here that I do as well. I'm well known in the \_\_\_\_ community and I can solve this problem."

Even if you could...

I've got folks in my corner that have a distinct advantage over you...

They know me at a level you'll never be able to get to

Not interested in downgrading my support, first of all..

Second of all...

You made a promise to get me on a call.

Then, you not only spoke down to me, but you flipped the script.

EXAMPLE 3

I had a refreshing example, as well...

Genuine conversation with someone.

Openness about what they could offer.

Freedom to determine whether it was a good fit.

Not a go now...

Maybe not a go ever...

But for the right person, I might be open to sending a referral.

NOW GRANTED...

As you can see, not every conversation is like this...

But in many of these situations, I've been the one to bring candor, truth, and reality to the conversation.

I can tolerate a lot of things. But I don't tolerate manipulation.

If you use manipulative language or tactics, I'll assume there's a culture behind you that tolerates and possibly even supports that behavior.

I understand...

Some folks have been taught this way.

And they just need permission not to sell like that.

And I'm totally cool w/ giving people the opportunity to change.

(and some do\!)

I had a disagreement with one of my friends on their sales approach (you know who you are   ) and I respect you for the way you handled it...

Just wanna say...

If you've got a product or service that you need to rely on dishonesty and manipulation to sell...

Ya might want to get another service.

And a different way to sell

PS \- sucks for all the newbies in the space that are getting suckered into it. I've been around some 'record numbers' that focus on first-time, uneducated buyers who have no clue what they're getting into.

Great for a short-term cash grab.

Bad for a great night's sleep

Bad for a long-term play.

# do your customers thank you for marketing to them?

do your customers thank you for marketing to them?

I helped a client build out an email marketing sequence. Here's how we did it:

 \- break down sales conversations into logical sequences

 \- craft engaging 800-1000 word 'reading from their diary' stories

 \- use a headline \+ intro \+ "here's where you're at on the journey" as a hook to opt in

(Yes, we had multiple entrypoints into our funnel.)

Of course, I could get deep into the technical details and break all that down into tactics...and maybe I should\!

Let's jump ahead to the results:

\- Marketing agency & client's employees raving about the quality of the content (comes from powerful, vivid, aligned storytelling)

\- Responses from prospects like "Very well done on the story\! Great marketing method. Keep up the good work\!"

\- 47% open rate within 12 hours on the latest mailing

This client has some of THEIR best clients staying on their toes to make sure they get all of the marketing materials that are put out...

If it sounds like I'm bragging about what we pulled off, maybe I am just a little bit... but I'm also really proud of & happy for the client, because their in an industry that has mostly soulless marketing. The zigged when everyone zagged, and they're winning because of it.

My OPINION:

\>\> With the blind adoption of AI, speaking straight to the heart, soul, and mind of your prospects with laser focus has never been stood out more.

The question for you is...

Do YOUR clients thank you for marketing to them?

If not, why not?

# UNQUALIFIED Part 6: the call to 'unqualified' people like you & me

When I sat down to write last Monday, I hadn't intended to share all of these stories. Looking back over them, I'm incredibly grateful for each of these experiences...

Not because of the pain...

Not because of the challenge...

But because of the outcome.

I don't hold ill will against anyone...

Increasingly, I've found compassion for those involved..

And I hope that my capacity to love others well, will only increase.

Each of these experiences (and many others like it) pointed me closer to where I really needed to be.

I've doubted for years that I had what it takes...

\>\> "I'm not a leader."

\>\> "I'm not a visionary."

\>\> and more

Like many of you, I've felt grossly unqualified...

As I've started doing the work...

As I've spent more time w/ friends who see the gold in me...

Who actually BELIEVE and LOVE me for who I am...

I'm not trying to be a leader.

I'm not trying to lead leaders.

I'm trying to be ME...

And I'm welcoming others to come along on the journey.

I've spent years holding back, hiding, fearful of missing out on financial opportunity, afraid of giving away too much, and more.

I finally said, "Screw it. I'm done fighting for my share of the pie. It's not helping me. " Shae has a wonderful way of describing this shift. I'm wrapping my head around what it means to be a "DISTRIBUTION CENTER".

I stopped holding back. I stopped worrying about people swiping my ideas online. I started showing up as...ME.

And with that, I'm rewiring all kinds of rules.

This is not just about money.

This is not just about scale.

It's INSPIRATION & IMPACT.

Yes, I know how quickly change has come to some of my clients, both individuals and clients. I'm pretty determined about doing my part to make sure the people who work with me get a financial return on working with me.

But it's not the only thing, and it means I have the freedom to turn the rules on its head:

\- Some of y'all can't afford me (true facts) but some of y'all will still end up working with me.

\- Some of y'all can afford me, but you're in your head about the payment vs the ROI, and you'll stay put.

\- And I've had folks in the past who wanted to write a check, and I couldn't get past how they did business, and I refused to work with them unless they changed.

I would rather give away 1 free call and have someone sing my praises for 4 years, building what they were put on this earth to build, rather than miss out on what could have been if that person had said 'yes'.

Don't get me wrong...

Those free calls are pretty few and far between.

Lots of folks do very little with free advice.

But if I've got the nudge to do it, I'm absolutely going to do it.

It drives the traditional business folks crazy, I'm sure.

But I've always driven the conformists crazy.

Last week, I took a few minutes to type out a bit of my vision, and I realized...

After years of being 'not a visionary'...

After years of being 'not a leader'...

I have an incredible amount of vision that I'm burning to see come to fruition.

I don't have what it takes to make it happen...

But I know it needs to happen...

I know it's going to take people like you.

Both to help me build out the vision I have...

And to build out the vision that YOU have...

So this is a request for help...

If ANY of this resonates with you..

If you want to be on the radar in some way for what I'm looking to build...

Or if you feel like what you're building is part of what's taking shape here...

It doesn't have to be clear.

It doesn't need more action now.

But would you drop a comment below?

You might feel unqualified...

But maybe those are exactly the people we need...

# putting constraints on your business (on purpose)

putting constraints on your business (on purpose)

On a recent client call, my client and I dug into their sales process.

They had just finished putting a lot of time, money, and energy into overhauling their marketing. Yet, they still weren't seeing the results they were hoping for in new business.

Just as we were about to wrap up the call, I pointed out to them:

"You've successfully moved the constraint in your business from MARKETING to SALES."

I could sense the relief for them..

It took them from "it's still not working" to "we've made significant, measurable progress".

Here's the reality...

Every business will always have a constraint. The question is...

\- Do you like who's imposing the constraint?

\- Do you like where the constraint is?

REGARDING WHO:

If you don't intentionally choose where the constraint is, you'll let it be determined by the market, seasonality, vendors, employees, banks, or anyone else who can impact your business\!

If you make an intentional choice, you can direct the business to move the constraint to where YOU need it to be for the season you're in.

REGARDING WHERE:

This comes down to a simple question:

\- do you prefer to hustle to make sales to keep your people busy?

\- or do you prefer to have a backlog of customers waiting?

And if it's the former, you might take a look at how you can hack your own motivation (or the motivation of your sales team)...

But again, up to you...

Bottom line:

1 \- if you move your constraint to operations..

2 \- it means you have a lead time / wait list..

3 \- allowing more measured, controlled growth

And as long as it's justified in the customer's mind (premium provider, etc), it'll improve your position within the market.

Conversely, overbuilding fulfillment can be a major time & money drain. True for startups. True for companies looking to scale.

LOTS of nuance here...

Because strong fulfillment is a prerequisite for retention & referral...

But it still goes back to...

It's not about IF you have constraints.

It's about WHERE

and WHO controls them.

# UNQUALIFIED Part 5: I don't like where the self-appointed leader is taking me

Stepping down from my role in the church created a vacuum.

I needed purpose.

I needed something to throw myself into.

Years earlier, I had sold a Marketing & Strategy Deep Dive for my brother's software development company.

One thing led to another...

\- I helped him with his marketing copy, breaking into a new market

\- I helped him design the sales process

\- I helped him with his software design

\- I helped him build out a team to handle sales, design, support, and implementation.

On one hand, it was new and exciting. He lived on the other side of the globe, and I'd often talk to him from 8pm to 12am.

Looking back, I loved the process of building the business. I couldn't have cared less about software. In fact, I wrote software, built systems, and developed processes to distance myself from the day-to-day as much as possible.

When I needed purpose, I threw myself headlong into two things:

\- trying to scale the software business

\- trying to launch new offers

I'd spent enough time around business strategists that I knew I had major flaws in my business. But rather than embrace the truth, I simply worked harder and spent more money to try to fix it.

I jumped into a new, shiny coaching program by folks who'd managed to hit the market at the perfect time.

Meanwhile, I doubled down on 'scale':

\- I hired a local team to grow a local team (then had to let them go soon after)

\- I built out training modules for the design process

\- I built out internal coaching calls for my team members

\- I built out templates and SOPs to save even more time.

\- I created a way to manage my inbox to keep me out of it.

The mystery? Things seemed work...sort of. And yet, every time I stepped away from the business, the more difficult it was to get back into it.

Looking back, I was avoiding the truth.

I was in a business, but I didn't love it.

I'd self-appointed myself as the leader.

But I didn't like where I was taking me.

Of course, all was not lost...

I discovered some things I was exceptionally good at...

And some things that I absolutely loved:

\- I loved the process of building business

\- I loved helping other people succeed

\- I loved the process of building people & teams

\- I loved streamlining processes to make things go smoothly

\- I had a knack for finding constraint in the business

\- I could tease apart a business, and within 1 day know within 80% accuracy of everything the software entailed

\- I did great work on big, innovative projects

\- And more

It took some time for me to hit the wall. But when I finally stopped hiring 'sellers' and started hiring 'truth-tellers', I was confronted my own demon:

I had built a business that people applauded.

I had built a business with strong skills I had.

I had built a business that I hadn't been called to build.

Laying aside all ego of having a 'real business', I sold off part of my business to my brother.

On January 1, 2024, I woke up to team of:

\- myself

\- my part-time project manager

\- my super-part-time personal assistant

As much as I could, I took the pressure off to figure anything out. I love consulting, and I continued to do consulting to pay the bills.

As I've allowed space to hear myself, I've come to realize something profound about my vision & desire for this next season of life...

# UNQUALIFIED Part 4: fired from my first real leadership role

Fast forward a few years...

My wife and I had gotten married.

We had settled into a small local church.

During that time, I wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo.

\- I asked questions.

\- I challenged assumptions.

\- I invited change.

Whether because of immaturity, ignorance, or reasons beyond my control, I ended up hurting folks in the process. It wasn't my intention, and the folks who chatted with me about it were quite generous.

With time, it became clear to me we'd never fully agree.

"No problem," I thought. "That's not the goal. I'll simply make sure, to the best of my ability, that nobody can deny that I love them."

I didn't do it perfectly. In fact, I'm sure I missed the mark more than I know. And yet..

To me, it was the undeniable foundation of everything that Scripture taught, backed by Jesus. One of my strongest dissidents once told me, "The problem is that you're not only persuasive, but you're also likable\!"

I took it as a compliment.

Over time, my wife and I were asked to take a 2-year licensure, with the possibility of serving long-term on the pastoral/leadership team.

We accepted. I filled out the required paperwork, and soon after, I joined the church's leadership team. When I got assigned a preaching schedule, I joined Toastmasters and started honing my public speaking skills.

Life was humming along.

Not without glitches.

But it felt like positive momentum.

That is...

Until my position came up for review.

The denominational leadership reviewed my application with a fine-toothed comb. "You were vague on your position on divorce and remarriage." The denomination held a minority view called "marriage permanence".

Without boring you with the specifics...

I didn't find the position to be airtight. It seemed to contradict bigger themes in Scripture, and what little research I did made me question the doctrine's foundation.

I didn't see a path of 'honest inquiry'. I felt the need to study was to change ME, not to find the truth. I doubted that any argument would change the denominational position.

Over the next few months, I had conversations with the rest of the team, as well as multiple leaders within the denominational network about this topic.

I didn't mind living with ambiguity. To me, it was a non-essential doctrine. As such, I didn't have a strong sense of urgency to resolve the differences of perspective.

But that wasn't true for everyone.

One January morning, I let the leadership team know that I needed to miss our regular meeting. My wife and I were in the middle of a particularly challenging situation with a foster placement, and I needed to be available for my family.

Sleep deprived as I was, I juggled family, work, and church responsibilities as best I could.

I never got the minutes for that meeting.

A few weeks later, the night before our next regular meeting, I got a heads up. "We'd like to discuss this topic at our meeting tomorrow."

Fair enough.

I entered the meeting expecting a conversation. Instead, I was met with the simple message:

"You need to get off the fence. For you to be on the leadership team, you need to agree with our doctrinal position."

A shock when through my body. I'd been completely caught off guard. I'd been prepared for a conversation, not an ultimatum.

I knew the issues was nuanced enough that I wouldn't be able to ever fully agree with their position.

It was over. I left the meeting reeling.

In an bizarre state of loyal denial, I told myself (and others) that we'd mutually agreed for me to step off the leadership team.

It wasn't true. It took me over a year to finally admit to myself that it wasn't mutual.

I'd held my first real leadership position. And I'd been fired from it.

Not for reasons of incompetence. Not for reasons of moral failure. Not even for my immaturity.

But because I hadn't been able to agree with a doctrinal position that, regardless of its accuracy, research would later show had political underpinnings.

And to be completely clear...

Many of those involved in the situation later told me...

"I'm sorry, I wish we had handled it differently."

But nonetheless... The shift had happened.

Things weren't the same for me after that.

I'd been overlooked for leadership.

I'd been trained for leadership.

I'd been fired from leadership.

I moved on from working in the cubicle...

I moved on from working in the nonprofit...

I moved on from working in the church...

I stepped into a new world... A new arena... A place where my skillset would be valued...

BUSINESS.

The question remained...

What if I appointed MYSELF as the leader?

# beating burnout 

Burnout comes in different ways for different reasons. Some practical examples:

\- It can be physical. It can be as simple as consistently getting too little sleep.

\- It can be emotional. It can be as simple as forcing yourself to chase an outcome you don't care about.

\- It can be mental. It can be as simple as continually worrying about outcomes, or overtaxing your mental abilities.

\- It can be conative. It can be as simple as fixing machines when you'd rather be using your brain, or sitting in meetings when you'd rather be swinging a hammer.

Each of these have more versions as well. It came come from more complex physical issues. It can come from being around people who constantly degrade & shame you.

For most people, "Am I burned out?" isn't helpful. Most of us aren't flat on our backs, physically incapacitated from doing work.

Better questions:

\- If I continue on this path, will I burn out?

\- What level am I on the path to burn out?

And then you can ask:

\- Why am I burning out?

\- What do I need to change to fix where I'm headed?

Simple answers like "Go take a 1-week vacation" are great, but that's not universal.

Properly diagnose.

THEN, prescribe the cure.

# UNQUALIFIED Part 3: trained to lead, but not a leader

I loaded my most important belongings into my beat-up white Toyota Corolla that my brother had bought from a friend for $1. I had:

\- a duffel bag of clothes

\- my laptop

\- and a Pearl drum kit

Yep, the essentials\!

I had to maneuver the bass drum into the passenger seat. I barely got it in.

I'd signed up to volunteer at a nonprofit for food, lodging, and a $100/mo stipend.

The first few months, I sorted junk metals, cleaned up the premises, and changed oil in cars. With my prior experience, I quickly moved into the office.

Within the first 5 months, I had moved video production in-house and produced two promotional videos:

\- One to recruit staff

\- One to raise fund.

Within the first 9 months, I became the director's assistant.

\- I sat in on leadership meetings.

\- I assembled policy manuals.

\- I ghostwrote fundraising letters.

\- I corresponded with the board.

\- I oversaw public communications

\- I assembled the annual meeting agenda.

\- I helped with 5-year projections and plans.

I was privy to all the inner workings of the organization, even some privileged personnel issues.

"It's front row training for leadership," I was told. For the first time, I felt this glimmer of hope.

"Maybe I'm born to lead."

But as time went on, my responsibilities started to drift. I became increasingly isolated.

\- more tech

\- more video editing

\- more administrative work

And no surprise...

\- The organizational value of having tech expertise at an 80% discount far outweighed the value of a director position that could be filled elsewhere.

Supply and demand.

And yet, it meant:

\- less strategy

\- less leadership

\- less human interaction

\- less purpose

Our team watched Marcus Buckingham's video series on strengths. I read and summarized Daniel Pink's book Drive for the director.

I felt the pull to lead. I felt the longing to use my unique strengths to make my greatest contribution.

Oddly, it never occurred to me to ask for change. I had come to assume that my requests would be denied, that accommodations would be bandaid fixes.

It wasn't worth trying.

Leadership positions opened up. I had fleeting thoughts, "If I'm being trained & mentored for leadership, maybe that could be me." But my name never came up, and I never put myself forward for them.

Maybe it was easier to be overlooked than experience what might feel like outright rejection.

Today, it's clear I was being redirected. I couldn't see where I was going. I only knew that I needed to move on.

So here I was...

\- Burned out

\- Making a fraction of what I made before

\- With no path forward within the organization

I remember sitting down with the director, looking him in the eye, and saying, "I need to make more money. I'm quitting."

I had learned a lot.

I had experienced a lot.

I had gotten a taste of what leadership involved.

I wasn't prepared for what came next.

# UNQUALIFIED Part 2: When your values & talents keep you from being promoted

My first 'real job' was as a software developer.

I'd started coding when I was 8 years old. For a kid in rural Kansas, getting a job as a software developer was a dream come true.

Paid better than almost any other job. The only places I could maybe have done better would have been at the right sales role or owning the right business.

But age 18, neither of those were on my radar.

(Even though I had started my own micro-business at 13.)

I got accolades from folks within the company. I got to build some pretty amazing things during that time. I worked on a large-scale project that's the reason the company is alive and flourishing today. And as I said, I got paid well for my age and location.

Sounds like the dream job.

Except...

At the time, the company culture didn't have room for someone like myself. The values that I saw celebrated were:

\- compliance

\- order

\- logic

\- pragmatism

\- execution

Get on the treadmill.

Crank things out.

Even though I consistently introduced improvements into the platform and development process, I found myself at odds with those values.

\- Too creative.

\- Too interested in building new things.

\- Too idealistic.

\- Too much of a big picture thinker.

To start with, I only saw these values differences in the type of work that I did.

One day, however, I encountered this values difference head-on. I found myself in the middle of a discussion regarding software design.

In the middle of the conversation, I realized that no matter how good my argument was, I was going to lose. The conversation had shifted from power to force. It was no longer about the best approach. It was about a power dynamic and who was going to win.

I lost.

I left that conversation with a kind of pent-up anger that I had never experienced before. I grabbed my shoes and went on a 1-mile run to blow off the steam.

I knew I had never encountered anything quite like it.

I knew I didn't like it.

But I had no idea it wasn't normal,

or that I didn't have to tolerate it.

Everything around me said it was a great job.

I liked the pay.

I liked the people.

So they must be right...?

And I conceded until 1 specific summer day.

I brewed myself a cup of some of the best freshly-roasted coffee. I walked downstairs in our office. The bitter air conditioned cold stood in start contrast to the coffee.

I paced the floor, frustrated at my situation. Finally, I made up my mind.

Something had to change, and I would make it happen. This much seemed clear:

\- I didn't have the traits that made me 'promotable'

\- I was too skilled to move to another department

\- If neither of us had figured out an acceptable solution yet, it wasn't going to happen.

I felt the death of a dream...

The dream of being in tech...

The dream of being celebrated for my unique ability...

The dream of having the success I watched my colleagues have.

With the bitter taste of capitalism in my mouth, I turned 180 degrees and went in a very different direction...

# For quite a few years, I had a Makoto Fujimura painting as my desktop background.

For quite a few years, I had a Makoto Fujimura painting as my desktop background.

I can't remember specifically which painting it was. It was something similar to Charis (pictured below).

I didn't know what drew me to his art. I just knew it resonated with me. When I recently picked up his book on Culture Care, I realized why.

Take one simple concept:

\- Generosity leads to generative work. And generative work leads to generational impact.

\- But SURVIVAL is its enemy.

We're taught to pursue systems, metrics, KPIs, goals, and more. We should do hard things, focus, and push. 

BUT...

If it comes without generosity...

Without the space for creativity...

Without feeding our souls...

It will contract.

It will keep us captive.

It will close in on itself.

You'll have short-term gains with long-term losses.

Create systems for sustainable short-term wins.

Create culture for long-term, generational impact.

As in art, so in business.

# UNQUALIFIED, pt 1 ... When who you are isn't who you 'need' to be...

This is for all of my misfit friends...

For much of my life, I've been in environments that have demanded me to be something that I'm not.

I grew up in what I would call a high control religious group & with dysfunctional dynamics.

I've resisted saying it out loud for a long time...

\- what will YOU think of this?

\- what will THEY think of this?

I'm not here to make statements about the group...

I have sibling who didn't experience it the same way as me...

And I dearly love and want the best of these people (today more than ever)...

And yet...

I can't escape my own experience.

I resented the politics.

I resented the control.

I resented what felt to me like a superficial religious experience.

I saw the things that were broken in the system...

And I tried my absolute best to make the most within it...

But I felt so powerless against it.

When a child so desperately needs to hear...

"This is who you are"

The system told me...

"This is who you are NOT"

Never enough.

Never smart enough.

Never good enough.

Never kind enough.

Never hardworking enough.

Not good enough for yourself.

Not good enough for your peers.

Not good enough for your 'authorities'

Not good enough for God.

Too emotional

Too intellectual

Too creative

Too visionary

I had no idea that this was about to spill over into my first real work experience...

# why partnerships don't work & how to fix them

why partnerships don't work & how to fix them

1 \- the overeager partner 

antidote: hit the brakes by getting clear on requirements & expectations

If partnership is a sales process,

this is where sales is a disqualification process.

What are the things that MUST be true:

\- timeline

\- delivery

\- values

\- contribution

\- M.O.

\- track record

Also:

\- Consider to stop looking for OPPORTUNITY and start looking for SOLVED NEED

2 \- the disinterested partner 

antidote: step on the gas by aligning with the other person's needs

This includes things like:

\- the outcome

\- the work required

\- the financial upside

\- the financial investment

\- what it's like to work together

\- priority vs. 'everything else'

If other people are affected:

\- stakeholders

\- team members

\- family members

\- clients

Then, extend this to what those folks want...

... as well as what the partner wants for those folks.

IN SHORT:

Partnerships are sometimes a response to a feeling of insecurity, incompetence, and more.

Other times, it's a response to a healthy desire to do things the easy way instead of the hard way.

It's like sales...

just with an amplified impact.

If it goes well, it can go extremely well.

But buyer's remorse runs equally deep when it goes wrong.

# "I can't decide" can mean a lot of things.

"I can't decide" can mean a lot of things.

But it might mean...

You're not looking at what you really want

You're trying to choose between 2 second best alternatives.

And you're ignoring CHOICE \#1. 

But because of

Fear

Doubt

Insecurity

Arrogance 

You won't entertain it.

What's the choice you really want...

... that you might not be acknowledging?

# if you're an EMPLOYEE, you're on your own for this

if you're an EMPLOYEE, you're on your own for this

(and no boss ever told me this)

It's the myth of the 'heaven on earth' workplace, and here's what I mean...

Every business is, at some level, optimized for profitability.

It's a sliding scale between 'do good' and 'make money'. If they slide too far to 'do good', they're no longer in business. If they slide too far to 'make money', they burn bridges with employees, customers, vendors, and more.

I know some folks on both sides.

The secret that the 'extreme do-gooders' don't tell you is that a) they're in a market that allows them higher profit margins, and b) they're using it as a recruiting tool for top-tier talent.

They also don't tell you (but you can be sure) that if they know anything about business, and you're working for them, they're making money on you...

What it means for you?

If you're burning out...

If you're not making what you need to make...

If you're not happy with where you are...

It's on YOU.

Yes, some bosses will work with you to make adjustments, but every boss has limitations just how far they can make the shift.

Sometimes, they've got such strong assumptions about your identity and capacity that they can't fathom any a place you might succeed.

(Happened for me.)

Based on my observation, 4 things make an exceptional work experience:

\- you've got working competence (and/or can grow it)

\- you don't have to 'go against the grain' to get the job done

\- you're innately compelled to do the work

\- you're in a great culture & environment

Many of the people who say you "can't have it your way all the time" haven't experience what it's like to "have it your way most of the time".

Over the years, I've been helped a number of friends make a change...just a few examples:

\- from construction to tech 

\- from nonprofit volunteer to top-performing salesperson w/in 1yr

I've even had spouses express deep gratitude (with tears) that their bread-winner finally found a role that fit them..

All of these have a theme...

They stopped waiting on their employer to save them...

They let go of who they 'should' be...

They embraced who they are when they're free to be themselves..

They found an opportunity with breathing room in the market...

I've been studying people for as long as I can remember. I've been told I've got an uncanny knack for figuring out what makes people tick.

(I'll let my friends figure out if it's true?)

I've had people courageously make changes.

I've had people freak out & stay stuck.

Biggest difference? How willing they were willing to humbly & courageously face their fears, and let someone walk with through past the discomfort into their new arena...

Up until now, I've only done this for friends who specifically asked...

Recently, I had someone reach out for some support in making a career shift.

I made them what I think is a drop-dead no-brainer offer...

But again... I might be wrong lol

And I figured if I do it for one, why not do it for more?

This is one of those, extremely affordable, fun, and potentially life-changing offers...

If you're an employee & aren't sure you're in the right lane...

If you're burning out & stuck...

If you want to talk to someone who's been on both sides...

Hiring the wrong people..

Or BEING the wrong person...

Drop me a line, I'd love to chat

# Conversation Notes

Today, this comment reminded me of something that I've taken for granted.

Several years ago, one of my mentors firmly instructed me, "You're going to have a lot of people coming into your life. You need a way to keep notes with everyone you meet."

I started immediately.

I notes from conversations with 391 different people. If you and I spoke in the past 4 years, I probably have some breadcrumbs from our conversation.

Some of these notes are dozens of pages long.

For others, such as clients and close friends, I don't bother taking many notes at all. I know and can easily remember what's going on in their life.

It's a simple format:

Big Header: Person's Name (and company/desc if requird)

Small Header: Latest Conversation Date

Bulleted List: Conversation notes

Small Header: Prior Conversation Date

etc

Why go to the trouble?

I care about what we talk about. I care about what I learn. I care about what's going on for them.

So I take notes.

Just a practical way, in my mind, to value other people, their time, their expertise, and our relationship.

# how to run efficient meetings

how to run efficient meetings

(tactical post)

First, differentiate between meetings,  ceremonies, and social gatherings. 

Ceremonies are cadences with a fixed, recurring agenda.

One of the best meetings I ever implemented was a financial heartbeat ceremony which includes:

\- review of financial transactions

\- review of income statement and balance sheet

\- review of cash flow forecast

\- review of unbilled time (esp. important w/ a service based team)

\- review of A/R (special attention outside balance sheet)

I can't tell you how many train wrecks I avoided with less than 90 minutes a month. I can't tell you how many team members I kept myself from firing, as well, when they made a goof. Lol

This extends to planning (weekly, daily standup, quarterly, etc), project management, etc.

Then for meetings...

I'm not often disciplined in preparing for them, but I love being part of them if they're well prepared. The best meetings I've been part of have consisted of:

\- a clear agenda

\- clear proposals (including options, considerations, and proposals)

\- all supporting materials

Then, the meeting was orchestrated so all participants could digest the information, formulate questions,  before launching into discussion. 

Finally...

Not everyone bonds over productive, efficient conversations. For those folks, there are social gatherings. 

They can literally be a separate event. (Golf, anyone?)

Or, they can be what many people call "a meeting".

Relaxed.

Free flowing agenda.

Rabbit trails.

Verbal processing.

Joking, catching up, personal updates. 

Efficient? Not immediately...

But if it serves to create team cohesion, it might be worth it.

That said...

No matter what I'm doing, I'm always looking to do it better. I'd love to hear some ideas for improvement\!

# the real work that I do 

the real work that I do (not software, marketing, or sales)...

In everything that we do...

\- there's always the work that people see

\- and then there's the REAL work that's underneath it

On Thursday, I got on a call with a client of mine. We'd just wrapped up a few projects, and we needed to stake out our next sprint.

During our discussion, my client tells me, "I think we should launch Project X as a one-off project, then look at how to bring it into the rest of what we're doing."

Whether it was ego...

Or my natural pressure-testing...

Or my curiosity...

(I'd like to think it wasn't ego...)

I drilled into the pros and cons between letting it run standalone vs. bringing it in immediately. I got to the other side of my questions and said...

"I agree completely."

For as long as I can remember, I've been working to encapsulate what I do for my clients. Thanks to some great mentors, I've given up on needing to distill it into a single pithy statement. Those of you who've been following along get a pretty clear idea of what I do.

However, as I've reflected on this conversation, I realized that this reflects one of my proud moments...

Yes..

I love getting clients results.

I love seeing them win.

I love seeing them step ahead of the competition.

I love seeing them build moats around their business.

But I had to pause for a minute when I realized that I might have accomplished my true work, which was this...

I watched my client reach a new level in how to think...

how to problem solve...

how to diagnose...

how to prioritize...

how to build...

The results come because of insights and outside knowledge.

The results stay because of knowing how to think & how to manage.

# The Double-Edged Sword of Extraordinary Talent...

Over the weekend, I got a message from a salesperson. "I can't believe they invested in me like this."

Their company just approved funding to free this individual up to do what they do best...

To SELL.

(Smart boss, in my opinion.)

I love watching clients win.

Here's why I'm particularly excited.

This individual is a genius in their own right...

But they've wrestled with the double-edged sword of genius.

When you're exceptionally strong in one area, you've got equal and opposite gaps in other areas.

Many owners are too busy trying to:

\- put square pegs in round holes

\- drive forward with another goal

\- make sure the numbers add up

They miss the fact that they might have powerful talent that's untapped, right in front of them.

Many of these talented team members have:

\- gone through the school system

\- gone through multiple employers

\- wrestled with things that look "easy" for others

They've been beaten down because they're not well rounded.

They end up internalizing the belief that something is wrong with them...

BUT....

Put them into an environment where their talent is valued...

Put them into an environment where they're supported...

THEN...

Watch them soar.

Yes, it has to be the right fit...

But with the right fit and the right investment...

You can have an extraordinarily productive & loyal team member

# unconventional but powerful way to solve hard problems

Ever had a head-scratching problem you absolutely couldn't solve? I had that happen for me last week...

On Thursday morning, I met with one of my clients. They told me, "We've got 5 problems we'd like to solve. We need solutions for them ASAP."

I had solutions for the first 4 by the end of the day. However, I kept hitting my head against the wall on the 5th.

Here's my OLD response:

\- Freak out

\- Work harder

\- Muscle through it

\- Stay up late

\- Stress out

I've figured out that my job as a consultant isn't to meet the client's deadlines. It's to give them the best possible outcome given the situation.

And my job as a consultant is to collaboratively figure that out, then help them achieve it.

The NEW response?

\- Take off Friday for high-value, strategic work

\- Knock off work early on Fri

\- Take off Sat & Sun to hang with my wife & kids

\- Sleep in Mon (well ok, 6:30am, but still...)

I think you can see what a raging, desperate workaholic I am lol...

The outcome?

\- This morning, I fired up my computer, pulled up our meeting transcript, reviewed a few things, and within 10 minutes, knew exactly what needed to happen...

Was the exact timeline the client wanted?

Nope.

Was it the best possible outcome for the client, given the situation?

Yep\!

I've found that when most folks face a problem, they roll up their sleeves and try to muscle through it. Fine by me if you prefer that approach...

Years ago, one of my mentors told me to use this exact strategy...

\- "If you're stuck on a problem, set it aside. Go play with your kids. Pick it up when you're ready to."

Everything inside of me resisted that advice. "You don't understand...I need to keep pushing this through\!"

It's taken me a while to purge this from my life...

But I've found it far more effective to find the exact location of the problem, wind up, and apply maximum force to that exact location...

# scaling is about a smaller business, not bigger

scaling is about a smaller business, not bigger  
(here's why...and the scaling gooroos won't tell you this)  
Scaling to exit (either by sale or by being absent) is the Holy Grail of business  
And many folks want scale for a bigger business  
But that's backwards  
Your aim should be a smaller business...  
And here's what I mean  
Your business always drops to your level  
...your skill   
...your mental state  
....your emotional state  
That means if you try to grow your business past who you are, you will self sabotage...  
\- you'll create unhealthy culture   
\- you won't follow through   
\- you won't delegate and wmpower  
\- you'll get distracted  
BUT...  
If you fix your inner game  
\- deal with mindset  
\- deal with identity  
\- deal with emotions  
\- deal with skill gaps  
The number of people who can most radically help with this is incredibly small, in my opinion. But if you say yes to the process...  
You'll get to a point where you're asking yourself...  
"It's the same business.  
But why does it feel so small?  
The business hasn't changed, my friend.  
You have.  
And you're ready to scale.  
You have a runway to scale your business without self sabotage.  
And that's when you reach for the gas and the match, and you put the fuel on the fire...  
Gooooo\!

# "why do you wear those funky shoes?"

"why do you wear those funky shoes?"  
Probably one of the most common questions I get from strangers...followed with...  
\- "are they comfortable?"  
\- "where do i get them?"  
\- "do you run in them?"  
For the past 7 years, I've worn Vibram five finger shoes. My wife bought my first pair for my birthday, even though they violated every sense of fashion. I've worn them almost everywhere... church, work, conferences, meetings, and more.  
Here's why I love these shoes:  
\- they fit like a glove; not constricting, not loose and obnoxious (in fact, wearing them has allowed my feet to return to their natural, healthy shape).  
\- they let me feel the ground beneath me \-- the rocks, the grass, the dirt, the bumps in the sidewalk. It's keeps me connected to my environment  
\- they're unique; I know only a handful of folks who wear them on a consistent basis. It's a simple way to stand out.  
\- they're easy; I love the lace design. Nothing extra to mess with. Just get them on, slide the tab, and go\!  
\- they're fun; all my prior pairs were dark, and my latest pair is full color because.. vibrant color is an expression of joy.  
\- while the jury's out regarding actual stuides, I personally think they're good for balance, mobility, and agility  
Once again, here are little clues on my work with clients... reread the list and consider what it would be like if the same could be true of your life and business...  
Because that's exactly what I do...  
And it's exactly what you get from a life by design....

# Retaining top sales talent \[how to\]

LinkedIn Post Content: 

Retaining top sales talent \[how to\]  
I've heard it said...  
"Yeah, that's just the sales guy. They're always asking for stuff."  
Or...  
"They're always complaining."  
"They're moody."  
Or are they?  
These are all phrases I've heard about salespeople. Sometimes, entire company cultures have been built around these ideas.  
Trouble is, outside of a sales-founded company, sales folks are sometimes taken for granted and misunderstood.  
Let's break down why.. For starters, what are the traits of an exceptional salesperson?  
\- highly aware  
\- emotionally attuned  
\- conscientious about backing promises  
\- looking to serve the customer  
\- (what would you add?)  
In a supportive environment, these traits translate to a drive to close deals, hit goals, and help the company grow. However, I've also watched top sales performers flounder because they weren't supported. These same traits can take on a negative form...  
\- critical  
\- moody   
\- hesitant to sell because of operational challenges  
\- over sensitive to rejection  
This is a dual responsibility. The salesperson needs to own their own energy, state, skills, and time. And the business needs to support them.   
I got to chat with a salesperson recently about how to retain top sales talent. Here are some tactical highlights.    
What would you add?

This is a dual responsibility. The salesperson needs to own their own energy, state, skills, and time. And the business needs to support them.   
I got to chat with a salesperson recently about how to retain top sales talent. Here are some tactical highlights:  
\- Give them an honest ear. They're in direct contact with the people who are considering buying from your business. Don't write them off.   
\- Train them, then give them a clear place to get their questions answered. Make a habit of documenting new questions as they come up.  
\- Make sure your operations are in order, and that you can deliver on the promises you've told them to make. Do not saddle them down with soothing disgruntled problems because you can't manage operations.   
\- Give them a process they can execute on and implement.   
\- Build tools to save them time. Close rates are directly proportional to the time spent with qualified prospects.  
\- Build a bridge between them and marketing. ( Marketing says, "We've just found a new source of leads that are 1/4th the cost. We're hitting our quotas." But can your sales team book appointments? Do they stick? Are they actually qualified lead?)  
\- Similarly, hold marketing responsible for their job.  
\- Review their activity and performance, and provide specific guidance and insight into areas for them to focus on.   
\- It goes without saying, make sure it's possible for them to pay their bills based on reasonable performance.  
In the black and white, analytical, numbers focus of business...  
Sales and customer success are areas that stand in stark contrast.  
It's not either/or.  
It's both/and.  
Reason \+ Emotion  
It's a culture that must exist for sales to thrive, and it starts at the top.   
What lessons would you add?

# Culture & Skill Translation

Culture & Skill Translation  
(simple way to increase effectiveness as a leader)  
Recently, one of my mentors challenged me...  
Have you thought specifically about taking values you express in business into your personal life?  
It goes without saying:  
You don't run a family like a full on business.  
You don't run a business like a full on family.  
However, we've got pockets of skills in the different areas of life:  
\- communication  
\- planning  
\- self-disclosure  
\- storytelling  
\- analysis  
\- sales  
\- listening  
\- adapting  
\- change management   
\- project management  
\- and more  
Sometimes we relegate some of these skills to a certain part of our lives, forgetting how to apply them elsewhere.  
The more we can reduce them to their fundamental essence, the easier they can be applied in other contexts.  
But when we become fully aligned with ourselves, we bring OUR unique culture into every arena of life. And within that culture, we can translate skills to work in that context.  
Borrow from work.  
Apply at home.  
Borrow from home.  
Apply at work.  
Yes, it takes wise discernment to know what or how to apply it. It takes practice to refine it.  
But translating healthy culture and skill is one of the fastest ways to increase your effectiveness as a leader...

# Nice desk\!

Erica walked into my office and handed me my DoorDash lunch. She paused, then exclaimed, "Nice desk\!"  
"Oh, thanks\!" I told her. It caught me off guard. To be honest, I couldn't recall anyone complementing me on my desk before. She reminded me just much I'd taken my desk for granted.  
However, I didn't really dig in until my peers probed me. "What is it specifically that you love about your desk?"  I listed all the things I had done to make sure that I love my desk.  
I came up with 14 things:  
1\. I can stand 90% of the time & move around on calls  
2\. Electric motors quickly raise and lower the desk   
3\. The frame is durable & doesn't shake.  
4\. I plug in 2 cords to get my laptop connected to everything  
5\. The 43" 4k display lets me split 3 windows across  
6\. The drawer organizers give me storage for things I want nearby  
7\. They also raise the monitor to eye level, reducing strain.  
8\. The cable organizers underneath the desk hide the clutter.  
9\. The desk's wheels allow me to easily roll it around.  
10\. It has ONE cord going to it to power everything.  
11\. The CenterCam helps me "make eye contact" on Zoom.  
12\. I drink from a custom designed mug.  
13\. I use custom branded slate coasters.  
14\. I've got plenty of workspace on both sides of me.  
This is just one part of my office...  
My Desk.  
Almost every other part of my office has a specific purpose in its design. It's one of my most intentionally designed spaces.  
And the reason why I've designed My Desk like this? It comes down to what I love.  
\- I love things that are clean, simple, and minimalistic.  
\- I love things that are efficient and don't waste my time.  
\- I love things that are practical, not getting in the way.  
\- I love things that allow some flexibility for the person & moment  
\- I love things that are innovative, if they can support my goals.  
\- I love things that are personalized, made to fit me.  
\- I love things that are strong & durable.  
\- I love things that are designed to reflect their purpose.  
They say that how you do one thing is how you do everything...and what I've listed above are all the things I love about what I do in my work\!  
So thank you Erica for my lunch, a complement, and a reminder of why I love doing what I do\!

# Egyptian kings, revolving doors, & six-figure losses

\>\> Egyptian kings, revolving doors, & six-figure losses \<\<  
A gentleman sidled up to me at an event, and asked, "I'd like some free advice."  
I chuckled and told him, "You know the value of free advice." Undeterred, he told me:  
"I'm looking to hire a \[specialist position\], but I'm not sure if it's 1 position or 2\.  
"Also, I'm not sure what I'm hiring for. I don't know if I know anyone like that.  
"I just want people to \*\* go get stuff done and leave me out of it."  
We chatted for a bit, and afterward I shot him an email inviting him to dig deeper into this, including markers for behavioral traits that would help him definitely answer his question.  
In this case, the company culture doesn't support the means I offered to reduce the risk in this hire...  
Anytime you're dealing with employees, one of the biggest costs & risks is turnover and retention...  
\>\>\> The cost of the mishire is easily a 6-figure cost to any business, especially in this kind of role. \<\<\<  
Now, this isn't the only way to resolve retention. I've seen three common ways to address it:  
PATH 1: embrace it by building a revolving door...  
If you celebrate hustle, grind, and burnout, and if you can attach a 'larger than life' mission with a 'larger than life leader' or 'once in a lifetime opportunity'...  
You can create constant stream of people who are willing to sacrifice their health & wellbeing to whatever it is necessary...  
And 2-3 years later when they burn out, you've got a line of folks who are waiting to get in.  
One of the telltale signs of this culture, by the way, is when flesh blood is celebrated more than the veterans. Be very, very cautious if spot this entering a culture. WARNING: You're on a conveyor belt, and it's path is OUT.  
PATH 2: prioritize WORK, with people as the means, with an irresistible PAY & WORK STRUCTURE.  
The most effective way to fix retention in this case, is by making employees codependent on the business. You hire warm bodies, employ them at a lower level of skill than their highest capability, and pay them at a fair rate for THAT skill.  
This creates a negative spiral, and they start to doubt their highest capability. They'll feel dependent on the employer for their payment. They'll doubt their true selves, and that there's an opportunity for them outside the 4 walls of your company.  
This isn't a new strategy, by the way. Go back and read the story of Pharaoh and the nation of Israel. Pay attention to how Pharaoh tightened the screws, and how it impacted the people after they got out of Egypt.  
Is it healthy? No. Does it work? Absolutely, until...  
They walk out. Then, they're gone for good. I've helped people walk out of these types of environments. I've watched opportunity after opportunity open up for them after they left.  
Why? Even though I've never shared this story publicly, I've been in this kind of situation. I know what it tastes like, looks like, feels like, and sounds like. After helping one of these individuals get out of their prior employment, they read my story and said, "Now I FINALLY know why it felt you completely understood what was going on."  
Sadly, this is an act of courage that not everyone is willing to take. However, if you recognize yourself in this kind of situation and you're open to taking small steps out of it, PLEASE reach out to someone who cares & who can help.  
PATH 3: prioritize PEOPLE, with work as the means, using an irresistible CULTURE  
This is an environment where people are free to show up as their best selves, bringing their talent to the table, and engaged in a mission that is bigger than themselves  
If you want to do this while making sure your business is profitable, it means you have to screen your people aggressively. You might take 1000 candidates down to 3\.  
You need to define a criteria for their values, their skills, their natural talents & behaviors, and their internal drive. Then, you need to screen by those.  
(BTW, that's a list that's worth clipping & saving.)  
Oh, and you're looking for a needle in a haystack. You're looking for the top \<1% of the task force. You also need to pay them 20-30% above the average job market.  
And yet....their output & contribution far exceeds any of the extra cost & effort involved in getting there.  
AND...they're an absolute joy & pleasure to work with.  
Is it a lot of work? Yes. Is it far superior? Yes.  
Not only is it worth the effort, both financially and personally...  
I believe it's the RIGHT way to do business.  
Yes, business must have boundaries.  
Yes, business must be profitable.  
Yes, employees must get the results they were hired for.  
AND...  
You can have a healthy culture where people thrive, difficult conversations can be had openly & honestly, and the business is profitable & growing.  
If I'm completely honest, it's one of the things that makes me most proud & excited about the people I get to work with on a daily basis....

# recent lessons about software & tech tools

LinkedIn Introduction \--   
For those of you who've been watching, a major software company in the marketing space just launched a lawsuit, claiming a violation of a patent against a company taking over market share. 

It triggered a few observations from the past 30 years in software.  Well more than a few, maybe \- this one got away from me, so you can read it here:  recent-lessons-about-software-tech-tools.  Sign up for my newsletter while you're there, and you'll get these in your inbox.  

\-----

For those of you who've been watching, a major software company in the marketing space just launched a lawsuit, claiming a violation of a patent against a company taking over market share.

It triggered a few observations from the past 30 years in software:

\>\> QUICKBOOKS \-

As a teenager, I remember the first time it hit me that QuickBooks had a monopoly on the market. On one of their updates, I started seeing cracks in their armor that made me suspect they were more eager to defend their monopoly than to create a software product they were proud of.

Years later, they launched QuickBooks online, and they've continued their drive to move people onto the platform. When I first moved onto it, it had limited functionality, the user interface keyboard-averse, and it was slow.

This stood in stark contrast to a software project I was involved with early in my career, just as it became clear that "web apps" were the way of the future.

We had two rules:

1\. It needs to be a native web interface that folks loved to use

2\. We had to share as much code as possible with the existing product

This meant we couldn't simply "copy and paste" the software product. We had to make changes to support the web interface, while making sure the Windows platform didn't fail.

While I don't know the internal decision-making or culture of Intuit, it became clear to me there were two types of software companies:

\- those who build software for a money grab

\- those who capture market share with superior software

\>\> CLICKFUNNELS

Fast forward quite a few years, and I found myself in the market sphere. ClickFunnels came on the scene.

Over the years of working with software, I've developed instincts about software. From my experience, a software's architecture or design determines 60-80% of its quality, both in the short-term and long-term. The rest comes from skilled, experienced developers, attention to detail, and quality control. And when a project is a on a tight deadline, both areas often suffer.

When CF first came out, it felt like a "let's get this to market as soon as possible" product. This is a fine decision, depending on the intended lifespan of your product. However, it ignores a critical fact about software, which I'll get to later.

Early on, I saw enough issues with the page builder and their static website publishing to make me wonder about the underlying quality of their software (functionality & architecture). I'd had enough experience to know some of the challenges involved creating well-designed page builders that are a) easy for non-technical users to use, b) have the necessary features, and c) allow cost-effective feature changes & fixes.

Having said that, CF had a few genius pieces:

\- building a cult-like following around funnel hacking

\- making it easy to share funnels with others, inviting signups

\- strong marketing on the frontend to onboard folks

\- loss-aversion techniques to keep people subscribed

Nonetheless, some of my peers had concerns about it:

1\. CF came from a culture of "funnel hacking" (that is, reverse-engineering marketing campaigns)

2\. CF implicitly created a mass reservoir of marketing campaigns, with insight into what worked & what didn't.

The only real safeguard for its users was the equivalent of G's "Do No Evil" mantra.

Then came CF 2.0.

It was a ground-up rebuild of CF on a completely new platform, according to CF support pages. (Q: Why wasn't it completely rebranded?)

A skilled software architect will tell you this:

It's inordinately difficult & expensive to rebuild a software product from the ground up. It's fun, it's exciting, but it comes at a cost.

By the time CF released 2.0, they had spent years refining and fixing all the little glitches and issues in CF Classic. I'm sure their developers were tired of making these fixes.

The trouble is, with fixes like these, you can spend 1 day (or more\!) to make a minor 1-line change to fix major issues for specific situations. And it's impossible to take these fixes into account.

Furthermore, it's almost certain that CF changed the underlying structure of how they store pages. This makes migration imprecise, and from the window I've gotten, this has been a challenge for CF users.

But then, there came...

\>\> GHL

When it first came out, GHL sales were driven by affiliates, and it's (still) priced lower than many of the alternatives. Again, a great move to build up a user base and gain adoption. It gave a great incentive for agencies to onboard their clients within GHL.

Not surprisingly, it had much of the same glitchiness of a "let's push this out to market" product. However, they had no previous version their users were comparing them to, and users were generally more tolerant because they knew they were getting in on a beta product at a low price.

And, they managed to hit the market around the time of CF's shift to 2.0, and got to take over part of CF's market share over that time.

Side Note: The marketing space still needs a content-first page/funnel/site builder that allows speed of creation without sacrificing long-term maintainability. AI will help eventually...or it will make pretty but unmaintainable websites. If I had the chance to dive in an redefine this space with the right team, I 100% would...

Ironically?

CF, the company founded on the idea of "funnel hacking" and "copying", got (partially) copied. And now they're launching a lawsuit against GHL

This is a bit of a tell about where the digital marketing industry has come from...

\>\> From SHINY TACTICS & SHORT-TERM TOOLS

The digital marketing community has been fueled by near frictionless startups, which has also meant near frictionless demises.

Lots of startups and shutdowns.

Many of these software tools were built to meet a short timeline, and because of that, they had to sacrifice longevity. Some of these tools (not CF or GHL) were built on lifetime deals, creating an unsustainable influx of cash. Most of these are now defunct, unless they were offshoot products of successful companies.

For contrast, this is VERY different from the AWS infrastructure that was built & refined for years to support the Amazon infrastructure, then opened to the public only after having been pressure-tested in the most extreme conditions.

I think the industry is shifting, and we're already seeing signs of...

\>\> The ONLINE BUSINESS "ERPs"

"What's an ERP?"

Common question when I move from manufacturing or larger-scale businesses to digital marketres & online businesses. In very simple laymen's terms, they're the "all-encompassing, single software solution for your whole business".

This is what GHL and CF are after. It's new territory. And as evidenced by the lawsuit, it's a valuable piece of territory in the digital landscape.

I believe we'll see players enter and exit this space. (GrooveFunnels, anyone?) We'll see a handful of them remain. They'll compete with each other against market share.

The entrenchment with these companies is deep. It's one thing to migrate your website. It's another thing to migrate your entire company.

We're going to have companies sign on with one company, then discover a critical feature that they need to have to make their business work, and need to either a) change their business model, b) jury-rig a solution, or c) migrate to a different platform.

Because of the vast feature set and social proof (plus, these are built by marketers), it's relatively easy for folks to walk in the door. It's incredibly difficult for folks to walk out.

And because of the entrenchment, once they've secured market share, they're motivated to serve their biggest clients. However, most of their users simply need to be okay either waiting for fixes & changes, or adapting to the solution they pick.

The biggest concern is this. When you've got companies that:

\- have been built on speed to market

\- are sustained by client entrenchment

\- are motivated by shareholder profits

...they are negatively motivated to make enhancements or changes. First, they don't drive the bottom line. Second, changes are already inordinately difficult.

The additional concern is that these companies treat the data ethically. With great power, comes great temptation. (Dr. Robert Epstein stories, anyone?)

The alternative for users will be microsolutions \+ zapier (or custom solutions).

Which brings up one final point:

\>\> LOW-CODE & INTEGRATIONS

This will create an opportunity for low-code & integrations for companies who aren't ready to get into the all-encompassing software solutions. One particular gap this this:

\- It's an incredible amount of work to document low-code solutions & integrations.

This makes them difficult to maintain. And the more complex the business & the automation, the more difficult it becomes. And the more likely that tweaks create unintentional consequences.

For example: a simple shift in marketing strategy can create challenges in the automations that support a sales team's daily process. (True story, from yesterday).

(Yep \- I've got a solution for someone who cares. I just don't care /enough/ to pursue it on my own.)

\>\> CONCLUSION

Online businesses are maturing. I believe we're seeing the shifts in the industry that happen as this evolves.

The people who've been willing to invest in a long-term business with built-in moats that can adapt through ongoing change? Good on them\!

The ones who've been living by the "copy and paste" culture within parts of the online world? At some point, it'll become too complicated, too complex, and too expensive to copy and paste. They'll have to jump ship to other opportunities where they can pick off opportunities to replicate.

Bottom feeders exist everywhere.

Just don't be one.

And don't be a feeding ground for them.

That's it for now.

Happy Wednesday\!

# how to beat an economic recession

how to beat an economic recession

(& what to do now to prepare)

You need to know an economic recession is not a war. It's a chess match. Economic cycles are forces of nature, like an earthquake, hurricane, or tornado. You don't try to control them or mitigate them.

Instead, you figure out how to use them to your own advantage. You can either build your company to be resilient against them, build to capitalize on them, or allow yourself to get swept away by them altogether.

In the good times, you'll find a lot of companies floating along, doing ok \-- but mostly succeeding in spite of themselves.

It's the downturns that really prove businesses. That's when you'll find out which were actually built on a strong foundation, with great systems, great people, great customer base, and a great value proposition. You'll see which ones were simply shells built with optics & a wall of mirrors.

If you're waiting to navigate this until the downturn, you're going to be too late. 

It takes discipline, but you'll 100% want to keep your eye on companies who have:

\- agility

\- cash reserves

\- world-class systems & customer experience 

These companies have a VISCERAL feeling associated with them, and if you haven't ever experienced that, you should do whatever you can to find what it's like to be in that place.

And if you can keep that experience from getting into your ego, it'll become a north star. You'll be able to smell out opportunities that other people are missing.

Few things make me happier than seeing a client who's committed to being world-class. And few things make me more frustrated than seeing folks pass on simple, inexpensive tweaks that create an "average" customer & employee experience.

Still, at the end of the day, it's not my choice...

It belongs to my clients...

But for every one who's willing to say "yes", I'm going to go all-in and do everything I can to make sure they're positioned to win.

# how to get stuff done without selling your soul

Carousel Introduction:  
8 Ways to Increase Your Capacity for Getting Stuff Done \- Without Selling Your Soul

\---

how to increase your capacity for getting stuff done...

(without selling your soul)

In answer to the question \- if I have limited mental space that I give to my major clients, how do I find the time to do everything else?

I used to have a warped perspective of productivity \- just a matter of running harder, running faster, setting tighter deadlines, and more...

Truth is...

Most people are profoundly unproductive... myself included lol

But you need to realize we all have finite (but abundant) resources:

\- time

\- money

\- energy

the one I personally care about the most is the energy

b/c something that sucks your energy

\- will suck your time, b/c you will procrastinate

\- will suck your $ b/c you you'll underperform

Focus on energy (lead metric)....and the money+time will follow (lag metric)

so with no further ado, here are my rules for high productivity:

1 \- get a good project manager and/or executive assistant. 

My assistant is my second brain \- she manages all my stuff in ClickUp, gives me the views I need, helps manage deadlines, facilitates calls w/ clients.

2 \- work in your zone of genius

This has been years in the making, but I've kept honing in on my zone of genius. I've gotten to work with some incredible people to help uncover this.

When you do this, you're probably 10x as productive with 10% the energy drain...

So I really rarely come home from work feeling drained.

PS \- studies show (no reference here) that it's more harmful for you to come home from work stressed, than it is for you to be gone for long hours. Still don't believe in long hours, but...

3 \- Energy & Alignment \> Money

Probably the hardest thing to let go of... money doesn't serve you...

I've made decisions around money that many people wouldn't have been willing to make... it's a short-term down turn...

But I guarantee it's a slingshot...

\- case in point, went from a well-paying client who wasn't getting results & w/ challenges in our communication...

\- to a new client who's been better to work with, and we've been getting really great results...

I don't commit to deadlines unless I'm confident I can hit them...

If I hit a wall on a project, I set it aside... let it percolate... many times, I've woken up to the answer, or got it on a walk, or had a conversation that gave me the insight I needed..

I rely heavily on "pull" energy not "push"...

4 \- feed your soul

I've got a pair of expensive headphones... made my Beats Studio3 sound like mud... it refuels my soul...

I take calls from my assistant by walking around the neighborhood... it refuels my soul

I hang out in art galleries...

because it refuels my soul

I pay attention to how I'm doing internally, because for me, it's a huge determiner of productivity

5 \- calendar everything

if it's going to be done, it needs a calendar event

My time for clients is already blocked out...

I can rearrange

I can adjust my flow

But I cannot commit more than the time that I actually have

6 \- set boundaries around availability

I like to work in blocks \-- big projects, big focus...

Days assigned to clients. Minimal fragmentation.

Not everyone is like this, but I am

If I love a client, I might work until 2am...

But all my clients come with a cap

They don't get all of me...

7 \- hand off your email

My problem w/ email wasn't that I needed an assistant, it was that I needed an organized life. I've got a Google script that presorts 95% of my email, and usually my assistant & I can get through our email in just 10 mins a day.

I take the time to write personal emails to my clients, business partners, and prospects b/c I believe relationships matter. But everything else? offloaded\!

PS \- just as example, receipts are automatically uploaded to G Drive for my bookkeeper

8 \- prioritize

Not everything is important.

Not every text message gets a reply

Some emails wait 4 weeks for a response

I do things based on what's important to me.

I am NOT the answer or the savior or the silver bullet for everyone

Nor will I ever again allow myself to try

When clients want more, the conversation shifts to, "this" or "that"? I decide "how much", and as long as I can provide what they want, they get to decide "which one"

IN CONCLUSION...

I'm guessing there are things that I'm not mentioning here that are absolutely true... and I just take them for granted...

But I figured a partial, good answer beats the perfect answer you never get to read

# SCALING with long-term benefits...

SCALING with long-term benefits...  
Over a year ago, I did a deep dive on SYSTEMS in business...  
This is considered one of the pillars of scaling.  
And lots of folks talk about how systems will set you free.  
Not enough people talk about the fact that:  
1\. Good systems will also set your people free, whereas  
2\. Bad systems will lock up your people & throw away the key.  
So, what's the difference between them?  
I think these are the essentials to know when creating systems:  
1 \- the system should ALWAYS make it easier for people.  
And it depends on the outcome of the role:  
\- it should make your financials more accurate and helpful,  
\- it should make your salespeople spend more time talking with qualified prospects,  
\- it should make your marketing more on track,  
\- it should make your support staff be more responsive & helpful,  
\- it should make HR be able to onboard people more quickly & effectively.  
If a system gets in the way of getting the job done, there's a word for that... BUREAUCRACY. Notice the words BURY and CRAZY in there? Don't be BURIED IN CRAZINESS.  
2 \- the system should ALWAYS have an outcome that it's optimizing for.  
Go back to \#1 for the list. But unless you know the outcome that you're after, you'll tailor it for the wrong thing. Legal & Compliance have different needs than Sales. Different companies have different needs at different stages of growth.  
Some of my deepest disagreements have been with the people who argue for "systems for the sake of systems" without knowing the outcome that the system needs to achieve.  
3 \- the system should ALWAYS have a purpose.  
It might not be monetary (but in business, it often will). It might be designed to reduce stress, free up time, open up focus, avoid distractions, avoid loss, and more. But... if there's no benefit... then why are we doing it?  
You also get to decide the timeframe. You get to decide whether you want short-term, mid-term, or long-term benefits. For example, you might have something in place in your business that ensures that people will buy from you again in 2 years — even if it means cutting your immediate profit margins. That's a long-term play. Please don't get confused about ROI just because you don't see it tomorrow.  
You might also have something in place that keeps you from tanking your business, or from losing your shirt on a business deal gone wrong. Huge ROI, even though many entrepreneurs go through 1-2 failure cycles before looking at problem prevention (that's a big opportunity, by the way — especially if your competitors aren't considering it).  
Unhealthy contingencies \= paranoia  
Healthy contingencies \= wisdom  
4 \- the system should ALWAYS be adaptable.  
If the people using the system don't have a voice in the end game, you end up with TYRANNY. Systems rule, people become subjects. Keep it up, and your healthy team members will move on. The ones who remain will be TIRED. (Yep, just reframed how you see TYRANNY.)  
Write it down: systems make great servants, but terrible masters.  
5 \- the system should support YOU.  
In almost every case, the bottlenecks of the business go from top-down. Business owners are often the bottleneck in their own business. It's not selfish to build the business around YOU, because if you don't, you'll have a negative impact that ripples all the way down from you. My employees have a FAR better life (and my clients get FAR better results) because I prioritize what is important for ME.  
As you grow and scale, it becomes impossible to create the perfect fit for everyone. However, if you only create a 60-80% fit (find the right people for the roles, tailor the roles as needed), I think you'll be surprised how many people see this as going "above and beyond." The fewer responsibilities someone has, the more tolerance they naturally have for these types of things.  
6 \- most businesses need a PURGE cycle...  
Get rid of all the systems that aren't serving you and your business. Simplify. Get rid of experiments that have clearly failed. Double down on the things that are working.  
EXAMPLES  
Some practical examples:  
\- Several months ago, I created an awesome plan to generate content. Lots of great steps, lots of great process...but it completely killed my creative energy. I'm rebuilding it from the ground up... And yes, there's a system to my content creation...but it's tailored to ME. (Meaning, a few of you could swipe and adapt, but likely none of you could exactly replicate it.)  
\- One of my clients felt overwhelmed by weekly meetings. He changed his cadence. "Team members, you are allowed to keep recurring meetings on your calendar, but don't add them to me until 1-3 days before." For him, it was important to feel the openness of his schedule.  
\- One of my clients needed more visibility for their sales team in their followup process. One simple tweak to the automation, and they could easily tell how they needed to modify their script based on where they were at.   
I probably have lots more examples buried in my mind, if I'd only take the time to dig it them up...  
What would you have to add?

# This is what happened with my sister, Julia Ruth

This is what happened with my sister, Julia Ruth. Her colleagues kept asking why her brother wouldn't just give her consulting for free. The truth is, I would have. However, she wouldn't let me do it.    
She knew one of the greatest currencies—people who believe in each other. At the time, I was just starting to surround myself with people who deeply believed in me and saw my contribution in business. All I did was pass along what I was receiving to her.    
I held up a mirror to her unique ability, helped her stop doing the things outside her responsibility, and run with it.    
And she did the same for me.    
When I came to the difficult end of a great opportunity, she cheerfully told me, "I KNEW YOU WERE BETTER THAN THAT\!" And she just KNEW that I was on the cusp of something bigger and better when we said our last goodbyes.    
I miss her like crazy.    
But I'm so grateful for the friends I have in my life today. I don't know where I'd be without the support and friendships of some of the most wonderful humans I can imagine.    
Surround yourself with giants.    
Not to become one.    
But so someone can hold up the mirror and show you who you already are.

# PROFIT ENGINEERING 

PROFIT ENGINEERING 

It's amazing what happens to a business owner's level of stress and clarity when they know that their business is on AUTOPILOT.  Consistently profitable and cash-flowing, no matter the seasonality of the business.

I got to see this firsthand recently while working with a client on profitability and cash-flow constraints in their business.

You see, I believe the DESIGN of a business has a greater impact on profit and cash than merely operations.

Here's what it means for you:

If you've got your thinking cap on...

And a few hours for high-value thinking...

Here are some fantastic questions to ask yourself:

\- What needs to be TRUE for me to consistently profit?

\- What needs to be TRUE for me to consistently have cash?

\- What assumption, if it FAILS, will drain my profit?

\- What assumption, if it FAILS, will drain my cash?

This will tell you:

\- What processes to create

\- What outcomes to monitor

\- What safeguards to put in place

Excellent leadership is keeping your eyes open...

Seeing both warning signs and opportunities as early as possible...

...and making sure when either comes, they don't take you out of the game.

# another critical business lesson from enterprise software development

Another critical business lesson from enterprise software development

Years ago, I worked for a software company. The users complained about it being sloooooooow. As a software engineer, I got tasked with fixing the problem.

Three rules:  
\- It had to be fast.  
\- It had to be memory-efficient.  
\- It had to work lol.

NOBODY cared about how I did it. They DID care about the fact that I took a key report from generating in 8.5 seconds down to 5.5 seconds (35% less time).

Instant? No.

Solve my part of the problem? 100%.

How did I do it?

I found a more efficient approach, then altered it for my situation and made it even better.

Here's the lesson.

In software, you can make incremental changes by making small tweaks and improvements. However, you only make exponential changes by changing your fundamental approach. It's a matter of substantially rearranging work to achieve the same outcome.

The same is true in business. It's the premise behind "10x is easier than 2x."

The only way to get exponential results is to swap out the engine with a different one that gets the same (or better) results in less time...

I've gotten in the trap of trying to do more of the same thing, faster, to get bigger and better results...  
And it's just that...

A TRAP.  
It feels safe...  
But it's not.

If you're anywhere close to red-lining...  
Or if you've been there for any period of time...

You've got to either slow down or  
swap  
out  
the  
engine.

# Negotiation

Recently, I spoke with an individual who wasn’t happy with the deal they negotiated for themselves. I myself have had some deals I walked away from, and others I wish I had. So, I thought I would share some tips on negotiation:

1\. Go for what you actually want, not what you think you can have.

2\. Be willing to walk away. It not only strengthens your position, but it’s also healthy for you.

3\. Listen to and watch for red flags in the other person (gaps in character, communication breakdown, lack of follow-through).

4\. Consider extreme cases (extreme success or extreme failure). Can you survive both?

5\. Consider cash flow, not just profit (don't bankrupt yourself on success).

6\. Have your criteria for what a good deal looks like before you walk in.

7\. Stick to your guns, unless you are completely OK with any compromises.

8\. Slow down if you are attached to a specific outcome (either fear or excitement).

9\. Use your voice in negotiation.

What else would you add?

# ideas person?

If you're a visionary or ideas person,

and you're wondering what to focus on...

two things will help you:

1\. Go through the process of shedding the things that are not "you."

2\. Build a scorecard or process for evaluating your ideas.

Left Brain \+ Right Brain.

Re \#1, many of us get distracted because we're working on something that's not aligned. Get aligned, and focus will be much easier.

For \#2, a very simple approach is to step back, take a look at what you're looking to build, and see if it fits. You can take it a step further with specific things to evaluate before executing on a new idea. My assistant and I have implemented this for ourselves.

PS: It's perfectly acceptable and healthy to have space for crazy ideas. When these start intruding on the health of the business or on real, aligned progress... That's when you know you've got a problem.

Your vision and ideas...

Do they center and focus you...

Or are they distracting you?

# problems I solve

Someone challenged me to get more specific on problems I solve. Here's an example from today:

The client is racing against the clock, trying to get financials out to stakeholders. They've got dozens of invoices that are categorized wrong. The accounting staff has their backs against the wall.

We could do it manually...

Push the deadline...

Or we could create a way to speedily enter these invoices, then do some magic to cross-check the invoices against accounting.

Oh, and we can do the crosscheck in a way that lets us quickly dial down into exactly where the discrepancies are.

Expensive? Maybe not, considering the time savings, guaranteed accuracy, and the fact that the client can hit a critical deadline.

Outcome? The client stays on track. The stakeholders make better decisions about their business with good financials.

PS:

I had to be pushed to share this, and here's why. Most folks read this and say, "Oh, he's the accounting guy."

Believe it or not, this is the exact skill set and unique ability I use to spin up sales and marketing to get a company to scale on client acquisition.

I've stopped trying to explain how my brain works to most people...

You don't have to trust me that it does...

But my clients do, and so far it's serving them quite nicely. 😉

# What people won't tell you about scale:

What people won't tell you about scale:

\- Even though you gain efficiency in parts, you lose efficiency in others.

\- Cash hides problems.

On the first point... 

Low overhead is the Holy Grail of nonprofits, for example. But would you rather have a $100k/yr nonprofit with 1% overhead, or a $100MM/yr nonprofit with 20% overhead? Even though the former is more efficient, the latter has a bigger impact. 

There are two reasons for this efficiency drain, and it's because of the 80/20 rule. 

Let's say that you were looking for someone who needed help. Go down to the street corner, and you'll find one in 5 minutes. But the next one might be a 10-minute drive. The one after that, a 20-minute drive. And so on. 

The same is true for donors. One phone call will immediately yield someone to contribute. But with time, you'll start making 10 phone calls for every 1 donation. Then 20\. And so on. 

Yes, marketing can expand your reach. But it simply moves the line; it doesn't remove it. 

The same is true in business. There's a point in market saturation where it's impossible to make any return on additional marketing. 

It's also true in acquisitions. Charlie's Almanac talks about the Berkshire portfolio being increasingly focused on ordinary businesses at ordinary value. The amount of funds they have deployed and the businesses they have acquired have hit a point of diminishing return. 

There is one point in scale where it's about doubling down on what works. 

There's another point in scale where it's about expanding the total addressable market or the meaningful opportunities for the market to spend money with you. You need to know where you're at. 

Beware the wild-eyed "scale at all costs" because they'll leave a trail of burned cash behind them.

On the second point... 

The larger the business, the more the challenge shifts from increasing revenue to avoiding hidden and unnecessary profit drains. 

Big numbers give you clues. 

Smaller numbers give you insights. 

20% net profit on a business sounds good until... 

You discover that 25% of the revenue comes from a product line that does not contribute to the core business and has a negative 50% net profit by itself. 

But nobody notices, because the wildly profitable product is covering for the other product that is a massive strain. 

Yep, these are things I think about when I kick my brain into neutral. These two principles can save you a lot of pain at scale. 

Of course, happy to help break it down further if needed..

# ...Re: Big Government Intimidation Tactics...

...Re: Big Government Intimidation Tactics...  
(and some FTC ironies)  
Three years ago, I had accumulated a $21,019 penalty from the state of NY because of failure to comply with worker's comp. (The fun of having a remote team.)  
It came from a misunderstanding of what I thought my payroll provider would do...and what they actually promised to do...  
I got the first notice in the middle of the pandemic. I wasn't doing well mentally. I was scatterbrained and trying to get things working in the business. The unopened notice had slipped into a box in the corner of my office, and I went down a lengthy path of avoidance...  
Nope, not the proudest moment of my life.  
But an honest one.  
Finally, a year or so later, I mustered up the courage to call them up and figure out what could be done. They offered to settle for $6,400.  
And they offered 0% financing for up to a year.  
I took the 6-month financing because...free up cash with free financing...why not?  
FIRST CLUE: They throw a big sticker on the penalty to try to use fear to motivate people to call.  
THEN...  
Earlier this year, I got a letter from them telling me my insurance had lapsed. IMMEDIATELY, I called up my insurance provider and asked them, "What's up?"  
"You're good," they said. "Just fill out this form to prove you were covered. You can do it online."  
I did that.  
I missed a call from the NY board. It got flagged as spam, and I didn't see it for a while.  
A month after I cleared my name, I got a notice that I owed the state of NY $18,000 for a lapse.  
I checked their website, confirmed that THEY had a record of the coverage. Then, I sent an email to their support asking them what was up.  
Yep,  
This morning I got an email that they rescinded $18,000 off my account balance, leaving $0 due.  
Not a PC question but...  
Just curious...  
If a FOR-PROFIT business used this technique to scare their clients into a sense of immediate urgency...  
How long until the FTC would come knocking on their door to change their behavior?  
Happy "I'm not paying NY $18,000" Tuesday\!

# does your marketing fit?

Many business owners resent sales and marketing because they're doing it in a way that doesn't fit:

\- THEM

\- THEIR TARGET MARKET.

Yes, you may have sales aversion. It's a real thing.

Yes, you may have an internal conflict with profit & making money. That's also a real thing.

AND, it's possible that you simply have an aversion to the way everyone is telling you that you SHOULD do marketing and sales.

When I was hanging out in the software engineer tribe, they would frequently complain very loudly about the sales and marketing folks. AND YET, even the most staunch engineers had a very specific way they liked to be marketed to and sold to. Most of them completely missed the techniques that were being used on them.

Often, the best sales and marketing is very intentional and nearly invisible. In fact, I see one principle underlying the best marketing & sales campaigns:

\- Go find the people who need what you have.

\- Market & sell to them the way they ALREADY buy and the way they WANT TO buy.

I'm a big fan of stacking the odds in your favor.

Win by the path of LEAST resistance.

(If you prefer uphill battles, that's up to you. 😉)

Your hangup with sales and marketing might not be with sales and marketing....

It might just be with how you've seen it.

And it might just be with how you've seen it TODAY.

That's my rant for today. 😉

# MYTH: "Competition is good for the consumer." 

MYTH: "Competition is good for the consumer."

I remember as a young kid in rural Kansas, watching tank after tank of corn syrup go rumbling down the railroad tracks. Capitalism at its finest? Or competition at its worst?

Take a look at the food industry, and I think it's clear that competition isn't actually the best for the industry.

Where has the drive for more convenience, more enticing flavors, and lower costs actually gotten us as healthy humans?

Competition is good to reinforce one thing: the mindset of WAR. It's US vs. the Enemy. Often coming from the people who have something to prove.

It's far better for a business to completely sidestep the competition. And, I'd argue, that often it's actually better for consumers when that happens.

BTW... Have you ever stopped at a bazaar in a foreign country, surrounded by 12 shops selling the same thing? What was the sales experience like? You can almost hear the whispers behind the scenes... "Mr./Ms. Rich is here. We've got to get them to buy before anyone else does. They've got the money." You walk away, feeling like you're swatting away flies that are feeding on a dead, smelly carcass. Not a great vibe.

We got the same thing in the US, only worse. It's subtle. We don't always find out about the harm until AFTER the sale. Sometimes, it's YEARS later.

OBJECTION: What about the people who don't deserve to be in business?

My take: Every person is unique. Every business is unique. Poorly run businesses have missed their fingerprint & design. OR, they haven't matured enough to sustain it.

Stop trying to copy everyone else.

Find YOUR design.

Find YOUR business blueprint.

Then take it and RUN with it.

Innovators, leaders, and world changers know how to learn from the rest of the world... without sacrificing their own identity or handing it off to someone else. And you can only do this when you're running the race against YOU. Find your lane.

Run with it.

Have a Day\!

# Let's jump into some hot water...

Let's jump into some hot water...

I've heard it said it keeps us clean\!

Years ago, I got to pitch a software solution to a business owner. I nervously and excitedly put together a mini-presentation, set up an appointment, and went over my value proposition. No go. Even though I would do things differently today, I lost the sale before I ever made my pitch for two reasons:

1\. I didn't know we were competing against FREE.  
2\. We had fundamentally different perspectives on business.

What I've learned since then...

Every business owner falls into one of two camps:

1\. Function & Profit, or  
2\. Experience & Expression.

Some business owners prioritize \#1: Cold, hard, objective facts. Black and white answers. Basic math to make decisions. Sniff out the money and go make it. Find the opportunities, and get as much cash out of it as you can. If you can pay someone $6/hr from a foreign country to avoid a $2k/mo software subscription, do it. Many of these will start a business or close a deal just by sneezing. And while everything can be taken to an extreme... But I have ZERO problem with people who are inclined that way.

Other business owners prioritize \#2. They're OK with ambiguity and uncertainties. They're comfortable with unanswered questions. They're in business because they view it as an artistic creation. Cash is the scorecard, but it's not the game. What's the game? The game is creating an exceptional product and an unbelievable culture. It's giving customers an incredible experience.

Business is not just about the /function/ of getting things done. It's about the /experience/ and /expression/ of what gets done. These folks often have a much slower start in business. They have to fight to know what to charge, and to keep themselves from going bankrupt. They've fought against their instincts to get rolling. In fact, they've got to LEARN many of the behaviors and patterns that come naturally for person \#1.

BUT, once they've got their start, I'm convinced they have a superior advantage. They viscerally know what their employees want. They know what their customers crave. They instinctively move towards the future that's being created. They can't always explain why they do what they do. They can't always explain how they do what they do. But they do it. And it works.

For years, I tried to be Type \#1. For years, I tried to win over Type \#1. And then... Years later I realized... The business owner I mentioned? He's Type \#1. Any price tag, compared to $0, was a no-go. And myself? I'm Type \#2. Different perspectives. Mixing like oil and water. Now... When I work with clients, I absolutely dig into things like:

\- ROI,  
\- effort & reward,  
\- probability of success

because these are the ways that I can best serve my clients... and I'm driven by seeing them succeed... But I also dig into more than just numbers. Whether I'm looking at:

\- a business process,  
\- a software solution,  
\- a marketing campaign,  
\- a job description,  
\- a strategic plan,  
\- an individual in a specific role,  
\- an entire department,

I instinctively ask the question: "Given these two options, which one will give us the results we need, while also allowing us to build the elegant, beautiful business that we're looking to create?"

If that's NOT you... and you're a Type \#1 business owner... Embrace it. Find your tribe. Find those businesses that fit your M.O.

I genuinely want you to succeed... No chance I want you to burden yourself with trying to fit yourself into my mold. And if you find yourself enjoying my posts... considering what it would be like working with me... chances are you fall smack dab into Type \#2.

And if we haven't yet, I hope we sometime have the joy of working together. And for sure, if we haven't met or talked lately, I hope that we can be friends.

# Your focus, energy, and mind space 

Your focus, energy, and mind space are some of your most valuable assets. 

A while back, I got a reMarkable tablet on an almost-whim. I use it for two things: 

\- a scratch pad 

\- a zero distraction word processor 

Recently, after a morning walk, I had an epiphany for a marketing challenge that I'd been wrestling with. 

I stopped by the local coffee shop, grabbed their $2 coffee, threw on my headphones, and pounded out a first draft before my first meeting of the day. 

Controlling your digital addictions can be as simple as making little shifts in your environments and tools. 

Environment \+ Emotional & Mental Health \> Willpower 

Plus... 

Nothing beats the feeling of kickstarting your day by taking a big bite out of a strategic project.

# What You Can't See

What You Can't See

What you don't see takes you out...and...

what you don't see keeps you in the game.

Here's what I mean:

We all have things happen to us that we can't predict. Change is happening so rapidly (AI anyone?), there's no telling exactly what will come our way.

Walk with the wise,

so that you'll be wise.

Lots of hype about AI and economic cycles.

It turns out, humans are pretty bad at predicting the future, even though we have some historical patterns that are good at showing us where we're at.

If you walk with the unwise, enjoy the rollercoaster of fear and excitement as you chase one thing after the other\!

If you walk with the wise, it's no guarantee you'll escape bad situations, but you're much, much more likely to see the punch that could take you out.

If you walk with the wise, you're also much more prepared to respond when you get the punch that could take you out.

Things like:

\- Key team member quitting

\- Sales drying up

\- Skyrocketing costs

\- And more

Conversely...

What you can't see is also what will keep you in the game. That's the foundation.

Fun fact:

\- The deepest foundation accounts for 21% of the building (from the bottom of the Petronas Towers' foundation to the very top of the building).

\- The foundation for the tallest building accounts for only 6% of the building. (From the bottom of the Burj Khalifa's foundation to the very top of the building).

The biggest difference? The Petronas Towers are built on poor soil, and the area is known for high winds.

Lesson:

\- The ground you build your foundation on matters. A lot.

\- The depth of your foundation depends on a) where you're building, b) how tall you need to go, and c) exactly what you're building.

Few people pay attention to the foundation...

But a strong foundation can keep you from being taken out by:

\- The size & weight of what you've built

\- The winds that come against you

\- The shifting ground of where you've built

What is this in business? It's things like:

\- Solving root issues for customers

\- Embracing continuous improvement

\- Building a defensible competitive advantage

\- Creating redundancy in your business

\- Embracing excellence in all that you do

\- Embracing shifts in economic & market trends

\- Developing a listening ear for wisdom

\- Doing the inner work that causes so many people to sabotage their life & work

\- Processes that eliminate human error & allow them to do what humans do best

One example:

I recently consulted with a business owner who's in a great niche that's hot and is taking almost no marketing whatsoever.

Just some Facebook Marketplace posts, lol.

He's looking at a $1MM run rate, up substantially over last year with little effort. However, he's wanting to lock in the market.

My advice?

(Besides some non-conventional advice that no agency would have given him...and that he was skeptical about until he paid for our consulting session...)

My other advice?

Ride the wave.

But put something in place to keep tabs on profitability, including what it costs to generate a customer. And make sure that number stays below the "lights & sirens line".

And if he finds the market has shifted (might be 1 year, might be 10, maybe 100), he's gotta be ready to push the eject button.

Could be that once it cools off, he'll have a nice cash cow printing off dollar bills for him...

Could be he needs to get out entirely...

But:

\- If he gets his ego involved, or

\- If he stops paying attention,

It's not gonna be pretty.

Only 1-2 other people may ever know that he's got this spreadsheet that he's keeping his eye on.

But that is just one example of a foundational tool that can save his hide years from now...

And it's completely hidden.

Fundamentals.

Foundations.

That's how you win in a world of extreme change and uncertainty.

# A $10,000/hr return on investment

A $10,000/hr return on investment

Invitation for a few people, absolute max of 5...

Over the past number of years, I've been working with the top 1% of businesses. I helped one client reach the enviable \#1 market position with double-digit growth. They added six figures of revenue in a matter of months, putting a squeeze on the competition.

I've helped other clients gain massive efficiencies in their operations. I've advised business owners recovering from six-figure failed investments. I took a salesperson to 2X her company goal in her first year in sales.

I've gone deep in a lot of different parts of business:

\- Eight-figure accounting

\- Marketing attribution & analytics

\- Sales workflow & KPIs

\- Operational systems

\- The human side, such as turnover, engagement, job/role fit

I'm working on an offer to help seven-plus figure companies find profit drains & hidden revenue.

My personal goal is to find an absolute minimum of $20k to the bottom line (NOT revenue) within a two-hour consult. And if I find a dumpster fire, I'll tell you.

You'll walk away with a simple one-page plan outlining our findings.

I'm only doing a few of these to:

\* Gauge interest

\* See if I enjoy them enough to do more of them

I plan to charge $2k for this engagement (10x ROI). As I pilot these, I'm offering them for $500.

If you are (or know) a seven-figure business owner who'd benefit, please do both of us a favor and drop a comment or send a DM.

# burnt popcorn and flight simulator

Years ago, my friend and I were hanging out at his house after school. His mom was gone, and we decided to make microwave popcorn. We were busy playing Flight Simulator, so he ducked out and threw it in the microwave.

It didn't take us long to lose ourselves in what we were doing. The next thing we knew, the smell of burnt popcorn filled the house. He leapt from his chair and dashed for the microwave. He threw the bag in the trash and made a few attempts at clearing the air.

Minutes later, we heard his mom pull into the driveway. She burst through the door, asking, "What happened?\!" She had smelled the burnt popcorn from outside the house...and needless to say, it wasn't the welcome she'd been expecting, lol.

Despite our horrible culinary skills... I loved playing Flight Simulator. I loved the fact that you could put yourself into a world, see what it was like, hone your skills, and test the consequences.

I was also fascinated by the multi-axis input of a joystick—I knew a lot was happening under the hood. Fast forward nearly 30 years... I realized I use these same simulator skills in my consulting.

Jump into a world. Take a 360-degree look around. Simulate different situations, paths, and approaches. Find the one with the best outcome and least downside. Then... Jump back out and make a recommendation. 

And I try to avoid burning the popcorn or scaring the mom while I do that, lol.

# Why people hate salespeople...

Why people hate salespeople...  
(hint: because they're sick of manipulation).  
Let's break it down.  
If sales is a transference of CONFIDENCE and TRUST...  
Then you can supercharge this in 3 ways:  
1 \- brazen untruth ("It's wrong, but I don't care.")  
2 \- inflated ego ("People are stupid or weak.")  
3 \- spirit of excellence & genuine desire for others' best ("I want you to succeed. What we offer is the best. I share power with you.")  
You can sucker a lot of people with \#1 and \#2. If all you care about is speed and a money grab, it 100% works. (Not recommended)  
But you can't create a healthy, sustainable culture with it. And you can't win over your absolute BEST, highest profitability, clients with it. Healthy people can smell this from a mile away.  
If you go with \#3...  
You'd better be sure to make sure you've got your operations and delivery dialed in. If you've got dialed-in systems to deliver a best-in-class product or service, I'm willing to put my bet on these kinds of salespeople...  
They've got the ability to build genuine rapport. People can tell they won't lie and they care. And they carry strong CONFIDENCE and TRUST.  
They will bend over backwards for you because they know the exceptional experience your customers can expect.  
BUT:  
The moment your operations/delivery start breaking down, they'll hold back. That's when they'll start selling LESS than other salespeople.  
More work? 100%\!  
But in the end, I found that building on excellence is far LESS work than building a business on any other foundation.  
I'm sure there are some great stories on this 😉

# Uncommon trait of some of the best sales folks I know...

Uncommon trait of some of the best sales folks I know...

Not:  
\- tonality  
\- product knowledge  
\- objection handling  
\- mirroring  
\- wording  
\- energy

(not to downplay those)

But:  
\- time management and efficiency

This won't be a surprise: high performing salespeople spend a lot of time talking with qualified prospects.  
It's why I often address "little complaints" from salespeople... especially when it's about saving time. Get rid of the incidentals so they can focus on the essence.

It's also why some of the best performing salespeople I know will:  
\- develop a series of questions to qualify prospects and narrow down what they are looking for  
\- test effort/reward based on where prospects are at (sacrificing short-term goals if it makes sense, for long-term wins)  
\- cut as much busywork as possible from the day-to-day

The thing I love about fundamentals and management is, they're so easy and so unappealing.

Much better to chase shiny objects.

Sometimes you've got to enjoy winning through the path of least resistance.

# living by priority, not reactivity

THE NAPOLEON RULE  
Last week, I received a text from a client's team member about a technical issue they were running into. I redirected them and told them if they couldn't find the answer, we'd take a look this week.  
When I asked them about it, they said, "Oh, I forgot about that\! It's working now\!"  
This is a perfect example of the Napoleon Rule \-- a perfect example of living by priority, not reactivity.  
Here's how Ralph Waldo Emerson describes it:  
“\[Napoleon\] directed Bourrienne to leave all letters unopened for three weeks, and then observed with satisfaction how large a part of the correspondence had thus disposed of itself and no longer required an answer.”  
Too many of us disrupt our lives for something that will resolve itself.  
Wisdom will tell you what will, and what won't.

# unfunnel

Over the past year, I've had conversations with my mentors and peers about a concept I call the UNF\\\*\\\*NNEL. It's simple: Take conventional marketing assumptions and turn them on their head. Here's one.

Conventional Market Research:

1\. Go find your customers, prospects, and target market.

2\. Interview them.

Unf\\\*\\\*nnel Market Research:

1\. Make genuine friendships with people.

2\. Let them share what's really going on in their lives.

3\. Don't do it with any agenda other than friendship.

Any guesses which of these approaches will resonate the most with your ideal client?

Also, any guesses why "Confessions of an Advertising Man" is one of the copywriting books that resonated with me the most? 😉

Being human is the new advantage.

# building a business that's as easy as possible

building a business that's as easy as possible  
(a list worth saving)

your business:  
\- work in growing markets  
\- solve bigger problems  
\- ensure bigger results  
\- align more closely with what customers are asking for  
\- attract world class clients by shared values  
\- do less, far better

you (as "el jefe"):  
\- spend more time in your unique ability  
\- think "who not how" (including partnerships)  
\- learn to discern  
\- become more human (whole-brained leadership)  
\- resolve emotional trauma & psychological blocks  
\- tap into divine wisdom

each of these are 80/20 levers  
use multiple levers to multiply ease

# more money is made or lost on management than on marketing

\[Controversial opinion?\]

More money is made or lost on MANAGEMENT than on MARKETING. The more I've worked with businesses, the more I've moved to the conclusion that many businesses make or lose more money from poor management than from marketing... And it's waaaay more interesting for most people to talk about good marketing than it is good management. (10x your leads, anyone?\!) It's a sign of maturity though, so if you're reading and even slightly nodding your head, you should enjoy this one\! 

REAL EXAMPLES: (identifying details withheld to protect the innocent)

\- Missing sales goals because: a third party took responsibility for growing the ad budget. And then they failed to follow through, which starved the sales team.

\- Bringing in a 2IC (second in command) with over a dozen unfinished projects that were up to 2 years old. Not to mention,  there were uncollectible invoices and unmanaged contracts.  Add on top a lack of accountability with team members, and emotional spending by the owner.

\- This one was yours truly... One of my most painful losses in business came down to a domino effect of poor management on my end and on my client's end. I lost about $40,000 when I was just starting out and had zero margin to lose anything at all... Pocket change for bigger companies, but a kick to my teeth as a fledgling freelancer. \[NOTE TO SELF \- this would be a perfect case study on "worst management practices"\].

So, what are the traits of GOOD MANAGEMENT? I think it fundamentally falls down to three things:

\- Are my people happy/fulfilled?

\- Are my people working on the right things?

\- Are my people doing things right?

1\. HAPPY/FULFILLED \- Hiring & retaining is really expensive. You've got to find the right person, train the right person, and cut profits while you're doing that. It's not news that people estimate this as a multiple of the individual's annual salary.

Flipside: Note that it's about making sure they are HAPPY/FULFILLED, not only about keeping them around. And it's completely possible they'll never be happy in your business. Business growth hurts retention—different people have different needs. Some people are great for high growth, some for slow growth. Some are great for big business, some for small business. Unless you have a pretty static business environment, you're likely to impose turnover on your team.

Example: I recall Cameron Herold (author of the book "Second in Command") talking about his role as a 2IC. He spent 6 years as the COO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK. However, he admitted that he would never be able to fit most 2IC roles. It only worked because he was in a high-growth company...

2\. WORKING ON THE RIGHT THINGS \- This doesn't need to be complicated,  just making sure your team is actually working on the right priorities. 

3\. DOING THINGS RIGHT \- This, too, doesn't need to be complicated, but do people have a measurement for success? Do you have a way to review to make sure that these things are actually getting done?

Now...

LOTS of detail that could go under each of these...

But it's a simple rule of thumb...

If you eat & breathe sales & marketing...

Go find yourself someone who can help you build the foundations that will stabilize your empire...

If you're one of those folks who has management dialed in, you've got a great chance your customer experience, product quality, service quality, and more... is substantially better than your competitors...

You're probably a minority, and you SHOULD double down on marketing...

You've got a competitive edge, and you should capitalize on it.

People WANT to work with someone like you...

Or...

If you don't want to grow, cap your business at whatever level keeps you happy...

Keep taking money to the bank...

Build the business you love.

But wherever you're at...

Build your competitive edge...

Keep your competitive edge...

And make the most of the benefits.

# "I thought I was the only one who thought like that."

"I thought I was the only one who thought like that."

Tuesday evening, I got to fulfill one of my wife's bucket list dreams: seeing the Spurs play in person. Too bad she couldn't go along\! 😬

(So far, it looks like our marriage will survive the bump, lol.)

I love hanging out with my friends.

It's great seeing players in the zone...

I can imagine the satisfaction of draining a free throw when you've got a whole arena booing you...

(Confession, though: I was cheering for the Nuggets...)

What struck me?

Yes, the arena was full of energy...

But it was also strangely numb.

I'm used to being around people who are:

Grounded  
Engaged  
In the flow  
Alive

It made me wonder...

How many of the fans are living vicariously, medicating their own insecurities and lack of fulfillment with a sports team? Needing someone else to win because they're not winning themselves?

I'm sure it's not universal...

But I'm also sure it's a thing, even if subconsciously.

When I shared this in a conversation this morning, I heard:

"I thought I was the only one who thought like that."

I might be weird here, but I'm not the only weird one, lol.

So here's the thing...

It's tempting to live vicariously.

It's tempting to just survive.

But you were born to win.

Make sure you're in the right game.

And when you beat your opponent in a tight game, 105 to 100...

I'll be here for you, cheering my head off...

GO, GO, GO\!

# shopping carts, mirrors, and child-like curiosity

This winter, our kids were playing down in the basement. In the midst of the hubbub, one of them grabbed a toy shopping cart and ran full speed into a big mirror.

Then backed up and did it again.

(Name omitted to protect the offender lol)

The parent in me knew this was a teaching moment…

The Kolbe consultant in me also knew… Our child instinctively tests the durability of tangible objects.

Part of growing up is learning to properly discern when it’s the right thing to use your instincts.

Same is true for you and I.

When we’ve got a superpower, it’s easy to use it to solve every problem.  
If you’re good at sales, it’s easy to double down on sales.  
If you’re good at marketing, it’s easy to double down on marketing.  
If you’re good at production, it’s easy to double down on fulfillment.  
If you’re good at finances, it’s easy to double down on analysis.

Same is true for your company.

Right now, your company has an instinctive behavior that it uses to solve problems. If you’ve got a persistent problem that hasn’t been solved, chances are you’re reverting to your instincts. You likely need a shift of energy and focus to fix it.

Stop slamming your shopping cart into mirrors. You’ll break things.  
Stop focusing on marketing and capitalize on the pipeline you have.  
Stop focusing on sales and start making customers happy.  
Stop focusing on production and start building a new campaign.

The battle is not knowing how to use your strengths. It’s recognizing when you’re overextending them.

It’s why I rely on other people to give me an outside perspective on my business. It’s why I provide this for business owners as well.

Just curious… What's your shopping cart? And what’s your mirror?

# the cold war you didn’t know you were fighting

“I wish I could fix our employee turnover,” my friend told me. He sat across the table from me with his coffee and leaned back in his chair.

I’ve heard this story before. I’ve watched people turn to wages, benefits, awards, recognition, incentives and more to fix the retention issues. Of course, it goes without saying that you need to have a fair, livable wage for your team members.

However, turnover happens for many different reasons. One common blind spot is around culture.

Jim Wilder, in his book Escaping Enemy Mode, makes a fantastic distinction. At any given time, we as leaders are operating from one of two modes:  
Relational mode  
Enemy mode

Enemy mode happens anytime we disconnect ourselves from relationships.

This comes in many forms:  
ignoring other people’s needs (“leave me alone, I’m typing an important email\!”)  
saying and doing all the stupid things when we get frustrated  
an all-out cold, calculated war to destroy other people (in the most extreme cases)

To make matters worse, most of us don’t recognize that we’re in “enemy mode” when we’re in it.

The trouble is, enemy mode is quite popular in business (as well as politics, nonprofits, and religious institutions). It’s actually quite effective for getting short-term results. 

Leaders who learn this early often end up relying on it to get things done. However, it requires you to manipulate people through shame and fear.

It utterly destroys trust and relational capital. As a result, the relationship ends prematurely. (And if it doesn’t end, you have a dysfunctional, drama-filled relationship that sucks the energy out for everyone.) This downside far outweighs any potential long-term benefits from its short-lived impact.

Let me be very clear: This is not about personality.

This is about being an emotionally healthy, emotionally intelligent leader.  
If you’re facing issues with retention and turnover, it’s worth taking a look at how much of your day you’re spending in “get it done, forget about people” mode.

Leadership is whole-brained. Rational and emotional. Excel in both, and you’ll win.

# my wife called it a cult symbol :-/

I recently stayed up way past my normal bedtime trying to nail down some AI-generated artwork. My wife liked the first two pieces I came up with. When I texted a draft of the third piece to her, she looked across the room at me and said, “That looks like it’s a cult symbol\!”

Needless to say, I took it back to the virtual drawing board and tried again.

Lately, I’ve been giving myself more permission to explore art, and here’s why: art is the reflection of life. Art is the inspiration for systems and structure.

Where I come from, having a functional, working business was enough. It was never enough for me. I wanted to help build businesses that were elegantly designed. Not just functional. But beautiful. People in their zone of genius. Things working like clockwork. Customers who feel delighted by the experience.

It’s not everyone’s goal. But it’s mine. And that of most of the people I work with.

# solve the wrong problem, make the real one worse

Some time ago, I sat down with a business owner. I asked them a handful of questions. In 10 minutes, I realized they had optimized a department that wasn’t the bottleneck.

In doing so, they made the root problem 4 times worse.

Even though a simple discussion cleared it up, it’s still strikingly easy to get lost in the weeds. It’s a somber reminder that if you solve the wrong problem, you’ll make the original problem worse.

For example:  
If you think you need more leads to make more money…  
but you’re actually losing money in fulfillment…  
Then you’re going to double your sales…  
while actually draining your bank account…

When it’s laid out like that, it’s easy to see. Most of us, though, have blindspots.  
You need to stay anchored to these questions:

What’s the real bottleneck in our business?  
What do we need to do to fix it?  
If that’s not where we instinctively go, how do we keep myself on track to fix the root issue?

Solve the root problem.

Solving anything else just makes it worse.
