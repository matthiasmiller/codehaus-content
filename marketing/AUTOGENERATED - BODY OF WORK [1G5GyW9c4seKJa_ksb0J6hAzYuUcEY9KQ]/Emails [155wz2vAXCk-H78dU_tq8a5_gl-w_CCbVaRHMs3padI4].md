# Email \#003 \- 2016-03-08 \- The Rat Race of Being Someone Else

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Let me reveal a little secret about myself.  
I am the youngest of the four brothers in my family. This means I had many options to follow, growing up: I could become Lil’ Wes, Lil’ Ellis, or Lil’ John Allan. So many options\!  
Believe it or not, I actually tried that\! As much as I love my brothers and admire their examples, I realized I don’t want to be a Lil’ Somebody Else\! I need to be Matthias.  
I need to be who I was created to be, doing what I was created to do...(which every youngest knows is to Rule the World).  
Truth be told, nobody has led the mobile revolution by knocking off the iPhone. No one has overturned the coffee market by imitating Starbucks.  
To become a leader, you must disregard the hundred-and-one different things you can never be. You must find the one thing only you can be.  
To get there, you have to be okay with trying and failing and trying again. You must be okay with getting it wrong sometimes and learning through your mistakes.  
What you offer the world is unique. You only win when you settle into who you are and offer yourself at your best.  
Becoming a better version of your competitors is a rat race you cannot win. You can’t be your competitors, let alone beat them at being themselves. So be your best self and you’ll create a race you can win every time, because no one can beat you at being “you”\!  
Dr. Seuss put it best: “Today you are you\! That is truer than true\! There is no one alive who is you-er than you\!”  
You are not your brothers; you are you. So be the best you\!

# Email \#006 \- 2016-03-09 \- Entrepreneural Warfare and a Band of Brothers

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
The paratroopers of World War 2 will always be remembered for their courageous feats which led the way for D-Day. However, they would never have survived Normandy without air-support and back-up. Thrown headlong into the chaos of a warzone, teamwork was not a matter of convenience. It meant survival.  
Entrepreneurs face threats to their business, every single day, both inside and outside their business. The small business survival rates speak the cold reality:

* Nearly 66% of businesses survive the first two years.  
* About 50% of businesses survive the first five years.  
* Only 33% of businesses survive more than ten years.

Starting a business is a lot like going to war.   
The life of an entrepreneur is a test of vulnerability. Unless you can trust other people to provide protection and support, you will be decimated.  
Entrepreneurship takes courage and perseverance through pain.  
Gather people around you who believe in and will fight with you. Trust that your family, friends, or partners have your back when you’re under fire.  
It demands vulnerability and humility, but that’s where courage and freedom are found.  
Don’t take these comrades for granted. Keep them close, show gratitude, and reciprocate the support.  
Friends like these enable you to be the best you.

# Email \#008 \- 2016-04-12 \- Addictions, Time, and Debtor's Prison

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
I have an addiction.   
I can’t say “No” to people.  
Between work, family, and church, I have plenty to keep me busy. I rarely actually have time to help with odd requests thrown my way.  
Yet, I don’t like saying no\!  
“Of course I’d love to grab coffee and share some business tips with you.”  
“Change the color on your company logo? I think I could squeeze that into my spare time.”  
“Come over for dinner Friday night? Sure. We don’t have any other plans\!”  
“Sure thing, Honey, I’ll grab eggs and milk on the way home.”  
High value individuals are always in demand. People everywhere asking “Can you help here, contribute there, or teach me this?”  
As a high value person, it is important for you to learn the art of saying “No”. Otherwise, you will end up stacked with obligations with no time to explore and create.  
Instead of having time to take that refreshing walk where you finally understand how to navigate through a tough relationship, you’ll be stuck working on unrelated side-projects for a friend who asked nicely.  
Or, even worse, that 15-minute appointment to share business tips over coffee will go longer than expected and you’ll be late or totally miss your next appointment. Potentially hurting your reputation of keeping your word.  
This doesn’t mean becoming a self-centered scrooge: it means grasping an honest understanding of your time limits and setting clear boundaries. By trying to serve everyone you’ll end up serving no one--and burning out in the meantime.  
Don’t sentence yourself to time debtor's prison. Define the boundaries of your time, and commit within them. Give yourself the freedom to explore and create.  
And always remember, be the best you\!

# Email \#014 \- 6/3/2016 \- Why Aren’t You Achieving Your Goals?

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever needed to catch a flight but had no way of getting to the airport? Your ticket, though it gives you permission to get on a flight and explore incredible places, is entirely contingent on your being able to get to the airport. Without that ride, your ticket will be worthless.  
That’s exactly what it’s like to have a vision.  
For years now, Taylor has wanted to build a space in his Los Angeles neighborhood where kids of all ages can hang out, study, and discover.  
He envisions an ice-cream shop to support a safe but fun-filled youth center.  
There is just one problem: it’s only a vision. Without a plan, it’s like a ticket to Fiji with a taxi ride to the airport.  
Taylor’s vision has incredible potential, but without a plan of how to make that happen, the power of the vision will be left untapped.  
Here are three tips my team and I have found helpful for developing a plan:  
   
\#1 \- Write down where you want to end up  
Yes, it’s true--written goals really are that much more effective\!  
Taylor’s goal: to open a self-supporting ice-cream shop and youth center.   
Perhaps your goal is to generate 30% more revenue than last year or open a locally themed coffee shop.   
Whatever it may be, get it down on paper so you can see where you’re headed.  
   
\#2 \- List what attaining the goal will demand (Survey the Landscape)  
At this point, consider anything even if it’s far-fetched. You just want to get true understanding of what reaching your goal will demand.  
Taylor’s vision will require a building practically located where young people can hang out for an afternoon. As well as one either large enough to hold a youth center or close enough to open land or other buildings which he can eventually grow into.  
A list for Taylor should include details such as: 

* Ideal building location and cost  
* Necessary supply stock and cost  
* Number of employees required to run such a business

If you want to generate 30% more revenue for your business, your list may include: 

* Determining which ad campaign is most effective (and at what cost)  
* Finding ways to increase customer loyalty and lifetime value  
* Offering higher ticket items to give greater opportunity to upsell  
* Eliminating low-profit or no-profit items from your business  
* Determining your best customers and finding more ways to serve them  
* Spending more time prospecting for new clients

Get specific on the things required to get the job done.  
   
\#3 \- Create an Action Plan  
From here, you have a good start to creating an action plan. You know where you want to go, you know what it requires. Now, how specifically are you going to get there? What are the next steps?   
Does it mean networking for the next few months and building a team of partners and advisors? Does it mean hiring someone to help you with your responsibilities? If you’re just starting out, does it mean pulling the trigger and quitting your day job? If so, how are you going to support yourself until you’re profitable?  
For Taylor, an Action Plan could involve:

* Researching what it takes to run an ice-cream shop and community center (Surveying the Landscape)  
* Educating himself about the art of ice-cream making and business start-ups  
* Networking with local businesses and entrepreneurs  
* Getting feedback from the local youth about what they want in a ice-cream shop  
* Finding the ideal location  
* Researching options for loans and potential sponsors

An action plan should also include a tentative timeline with monthly, weekly, and daily goals, showing him what he should be moving toward week by week.  
Above all, it demands clear, deliberate steps forward and requires the full support of your peers, mentors, spouse, and team. Although we sometimes fail at this, our team’s best results have always come from consistent, repeated movement because of specific goals and objectives we’ve set for ourselves.  
So what is your big vision? How do you plan to get there? Send me an email back, I’d love to hear it\!  
And as always, be the best you\!

# Email \#018 \- 08/19/2016 \- "Oops...About Last Week's Email"

Titles:  
“Oops...About Last Week’s Email”  
“Oops, About Last Week’s Email”  
“Whoops, We Missed Last Week’s Email\!”  
“Well, That Was Awkward” (A little cliche, imo)  
{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Perhaps you noticed something a little different about last week’s email: there wasn’t one.  
I didn’t plan to mention it. Chris, who’s responsible for scheduling the emails, went on vacation last week and forgot to schedule it. However, he encouraged me to write about, and we agreed it was a great story to share.  
Here’s the deal: While I could have dug out the password, logged in, and double-checked that Chris scheduled the email, I didn’t do that because I believe it implicitly destroys trust.  
We build accountability through ownership, not through micromanagement. I work with people to take ownership of projects, which is exactly why Chris suggested we candidly talk about it in this email. That’s the level of ownership he has taken--he quickly took initiative to clean up his mistake, and he’s making sure it won’t happen again.  
Building a team means trusting other people, which means, quite frankly, they will sometimes make mistakes and let you down.  
However, here’s what I’ve learned: leadership becomes significantly easier when I choose to rely on my team, give them whatever support they need, then turn them loose, trusting they’ll find the best way to achieve outcomes. In fact, I’m learning to shut my mouth because most times, Chris has better ideas than I do.  
What about you?   
If you struggle to trust your team, perhaps you’re leading them incorrectly or perhaps you’re simply holding onto the lie that says “it’s faster to go alone” or “I can do better than others.”  
It’s only as you learn to lead effectively by trusting your team that you and they will be able to...

# Email \#040 \- 2017/01/12 \- Why High Expectations Are Hurting Your Team

Title:

* **Why High Expectations Are Hurting Your Team**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
People like us have an uncanny confidence that we can achieve anything. However, sometimes our expectations are just plain too high.

You probably already know this if you’ve ever set out on your own to develop a new talent but eventually gave up after the miserable first try.  
My friend Daniel tried multiple times as an adolescent to teach himself guitar, but he always quit after the first several hours, far short of his lofty goal.  
This is how many of us go into entrepreneurship: overestimating how quickly we can succeed--and underestimating how much help we’ll actually need.  
Why is this?  
The reason is surprisingly simple: many of us have never learned how to ask for or receive help.   
Whether it was instructions, games, or just life, we felt safer figuring things out on our own. As a result, we developed poor habits of doing everything ourselves.  
Those habits kill our momentum.   
They kill our momentum by undermining healthy leadership and delegation.   
We skip over important details and dump projects into our poor employees’ laps expecting they, too, can figure it out on their own. We expect them to get it right the first time.   
Obviously, this is unreasonable. It’s frustrating to both the leader and the team.  
To effectively delegate, leaders must slow down and give their team the support they need. This can feel like a harrowing transition and be frustrating at first as the new employee learns the ropes of his new role. But it in the long run, it actually increases speed and efficiency.  
When you break from your sense of unhealthy independence, you are free to support your team as they take on new responsibilities. You’ll be thrilled to see, as they develop, that you regain speed with even greater momentum.  
When people are functioning in their sweet spots and your team has momentum, you are all able…  
To be the best you\!

* When You're Up Against a Mental Block...4 Steps to Getting Creative Ideas

Have you ever had a problem that, no matter how much you obsessed over it, you simply couldn’t find a good solution?  
This happens most often in my business, but it can even happen in training my kids or working through a tough relationship. All of a sudden it seems like all the good ideas are used up and I’ve slammed up against a wall.  
There’s many tricks to making this entrepreneurial “writer’s block” a thing of the past.   
But today I have a different angle for you to try. Think of it as  It has helped feed my mind with idea seeds that continually sprout into a vast resource of ideas.  
Here’s four easy steps I take to producing great ideas.  
Step 1: Read great books  
The more ideas you have floating around in your mind, the more likely two of them will collide into a fresh solution.   
This doesn’t mean reading all of the latest business guru books (although that is a viable option). Sometimes a simple novel or biography brings the brightest sparks to the imagination and gets it rolling in a direction it has never gone before.   
Don’t waste your time reading good books. Don’t even waste your time reading entire books. Read the best parts of great books\! Ask your friends or mentors what their all-time favorite books are (or what fascinating read they’ve just picked up) and read those.  
Step 2: Have inspiring conversations  
Ideas almost never spark while you’re isolated. Sure, a new thought may come to you while hiking in the Rockies, but it probably developed from a random conversation you had with a buddy over burgers and fries. Especially buddies who are in a different field doing really interesting work.  
This week I listened to a presentation by an electric company. Not normally fascinating, until you pull back the layers and discover there’s actually a lot of interesting principles at play.  
Don’t underestimate the power of outside experience and perspective to spark innovation.  
Step 3: Write your best ideas down  
You simply can’t remember every idea that crosses your mind. But why waste them? Get them down on paper (or in Evernote) so you can always go back to them and rehash them later.   
Truth is, you’ve probably forgotten some of your greatest ideas.  
Even if you never return to your archives, the simple act of writing them down will help burn them into your memory.  
Step 4: Try more ideas than you can succeed at  
You’re never going to succeed if you’re avoiding failure. Have an idea that you like? Try it\! Not only will you learn something new through the process, the journey may take you into a whole new realm of ideas.  
Solutions are ideas no one has ever thought of before. The more ideas you have, the more solutions you’ll discover. So do what it takes to create as many ideas as you can, and as you begin failing forward, you’ll start building a list of ground-breaking solutions\!  
And as always…  
Be the best you\!

* Staying Close to Your People  
* **The Difference Between You and Your Competitor**  
* Why You're Different  
* What Makes You Different?

Three emails on Gravity:  
Email 1: Introduction  
Email 2: Proximity  
Email 3: Mass  
{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Do you remember when you first learned about gravity as a kid? It was so basic, yet so hard to understand. What is gravity? What keeps us on the earth? Why does the moon revolve around Earth instead of any other planet? And why don’t we all go--Earth, moon, and Mars--all go crashing into the sun?  
Just like gravity in physics, it can be hard to understand in business as well. Why does it seem like some businesses attract customers effortlessly while you grind away to get a few? Why does it feel like you have to beg others to work with you and you eventually have to tolerate any customer who comes your way?  
It seems complicated, but (just like physical gravity) it’s actually pretty basic. Gravitational pull is determined by two factors: proximity and mass.  
The first factor, proximity, has to do with distance--how close objects are to each other. The closer one object is to another, the stronger the gravitational pull. If they drift apart, the pull is reduced. (Which is why the moon revolves around Earth instead of Mars.)  
Proximity can be broken down into two more specific components (well do mass next week\!).  
Proximity to Your Customers or Clients  
Although proximity can be measured any number of ways, the most obvious is this: How visible are you to your customers? Do they even know you exist?   
If you're a local business, can your customers find you on Google? Do you rank near the top? Are you visible on Facebook? What kinds of magazines are they reading? Do they listen to the radio or watch television? Even though Facebook’s user base is growing, you're still not going to reach baby boomers the same way you reach millennials.  
Obviously this isn’t rocket science, but it's so simple, we can easily gloss over it. Which we can’t afford to do\!  
Just because YOU know you exist doesn't mean the rest of the world does. My friends and I often joke about "new" discoveries we make about our small town--such as businesses established over 10 years ago. While we aren't natives by a long-shot, we're not exactly the new kids on the block, either. Yet we’ve never heard of these places.  
Don't assume everyone knows you exist.  
However, proximity to your customers doesn’t just mean getting in front of people’s eyeballs. It also means being able to crawl inside someone else's skin to experience life as they experience it.  
Again, take my hometown for example. While Canon City has had some fantastic coffee shops in the past, they never lasted long. Until one shop bucked the trend, choosing a different location (and different model) than any other coffee shop before it.  
They ditched the stereotype and stripped the coffee shop experience down to one thing: a drive-through. They've proven to their customers they understand the busy and sometimes sleep-deprived workforce, rushing to get their kids ready for school before racing out the door to make it to work on time. If they're running late, they can even call in their order when they leave the house to shorten the wait.  
While they've got a great location, they've been able to tap into something much more important. They've been able to crawl inside people's minds and give them what they really want.  
But they’ve also been able to do something more.  
Distance from Your Competition  
They've also been able to distance themselves from their competition. The only other coffee shop with a drive-through is ten miles outside of town, catching commuters on their way to Colorado Springs.  
When you distance yourself from your competition, you stop fighting against their gravitational pull.  
Don't get me wrong--blindly distancing yourself from your competitors can get you in trouble. If you distance yourself from your competitors and don't move yourself closer to your customers, you've lost the game.  
However, when you find the magic balance between distancing yourself from your competitor while getting closer to your customers, you automatically increase the strength of your gravitational pull.  
Combine that with an increased mass and you’ll be a customer magnet--but we’ll save that for next week.  
Until then, continue to…  
Be the best you\!

* Partner with People Unlike Yourself  
* Business Magic  
* Team Magic

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Most of the time, we attract people like ourselves. Doers attract doers, thinkers attract thinkers, and so on.  
Here’s the ironic thing about entrepreneurship, though: it’s when you work together with people different from you that you can actually start multiplying your combined efforts. That’s when you create synergy.  
It seems unnatural, but it’s true: the people most unlike you in your business are the ones who can often draw out your talents and multiply them.   
Let me cut past the business coach mumbojumbo: the hard truth is that we’re all just bad at some things and the sooner we accept that, the faster we can grow.  
I’m a quick-start visionary who spends a lot of time in the clouds thinking about the big-picture and looking for the next goal to pursue. As hard as I try to pay attention to small, yet significant details, it will never be my strength. It’s hard to see the bumps on the road when you’re in the clouds.  
That’s why I hired an assistant who loves details and crossing actions off lists.  
We’re incredibly different, but together we accomplish way more than either of us could alone.   
That’s synergy.  
As an entrepreneur, it’s absolutely imperative you stop doing things you’re bad at. If you’ve got any cash flow at all, it’s costing you money and focus to try to do it yourself. Even if you don’t have a cash flow, you’re likely losing money by missing better more profitable opportunities.  
But it goes beyond just your team.  
I tend to gravitate toward working with people who like to think big and create vision. However, that’s not where I usually produce the most value. Most times, I find myself providing the most value to people who are quite different from me.  
That’s why I’m doing something special. I’m looking for a few people who:

1. Can’t wait to get up in the morning just to WORK\!  
2. Are really good at what they do  
3. Don’t like to sell or promote themselves  
4. As an optional bonus (but not a requirement), like facts and figures

Hint: those are people who are very different from me.  
If that’s you, I’ve got a unique way I want to add value to you. I’m looking for a handful of people that I can advocate for. If you’re interested, you can learn more here \[insert: multiplier.link/meet\].  
Until then, just remember...

* **The Leaning Tower of Trust**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Trust is the foundation of any relationship. Every other aspect of a business, organization, or movement leans on trust and collapses without it.   
Remove trust from a business and customers won’t buy. Remove it from a marriage, and the partners starve of intimacy.   
Movements implode to meaningless babble, churches split to smithereens, and neighborhoods devolve into chaos when trust is destroyed. The only way to rebuild a business, marriage, or any relationship is to rebuild trust.   
Like the leaning Tower of Pisa, relationships tilt and eventually fall unless they’re founded on trust.  
Building a firm foundation of trust requires many materials, including time, dependability, and freedom. But one ingredient stands out above the rest like a frame holding everything together: transparency.  
If you dismiss transparency in a relationship, trust is weakened and liable to bring everything down on top of you. It’s one thing to feel like someone is trustworthy. It’s a whole other thing to know someone is trustworthy because they’re open and transparent. You can see them as they really are.  
Not everyone deserves to hear everything about your life. Transparency comes in layers. But living like you have nothing to hide, will do more to build trust in your relationships than anything you could ever try.  
You know what’s even better? Actually living with nothing to hide.  
Right now, you can probably think of one thing that you need to share with your spouse, business partner, team member or friend. Do it.  
Now.  
Only when you are able to live transparently can you…

# Email \#063c \- Building a Business that Packs a Punch

Title:

* Building a Business that Packs a Punch

Three emails on Gravity:  
Email 1: Introduction  
Email 2: Proximity  
Email 3: Mass  
{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
What's the difference between businesses that have strong market appeal and seem to win in the marketplace, and businesses that don't?  
The answer is simple: Gravity.  
The law of gravity is at work not only in physics, but also in business. It's a measurable force that's at play as you build your competitive advantage. As you remember from your physics class, the law of gravity has two components: distance (or proximity) and mass.  
We talked about proximity last week. This week, we’re talking about the second factor, mass.  
Mass is the amount of substance an object contains. The more mass an object has, the stronger the gravitational pull. The less mass it has, the weaker the gravitational pull. This is why an electrically charged balloon sticks to your head instead of your head sticking to the balloon. Your head has mass, the balloon just takes up space without any actual mass. (This is also why the moon revolves around the earth, and not vice versa.)  
We said last week that the closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients will be. However, being close to your target market has little impact if you don't have mass. Without it, you cannot attract your target market. And without it, they will not be attracted to you.  
So what is mass, and how do you build it?  
(By the way, if you're a non-profit, you can apply these exact concepts to donors, volunteers, and other giving opportunities. In fact, non-profits actually have a tremendous opportunity to strengthen their gravitational pull.)  
Size Does Not Equal Mass  
Mass is simply the amount of matter in a business. However, within that definition is a simple nuance that's worth uncovering.  
Apart from matters of distance, why does the sun hold a stronger attraction than the earth? If you're in elementary school, the simplistic answer is that the sun is bigger than the earth. However, that's not entirely true.  
When it comes to gravity, the issue at stake is not size but mass. The amount of space occupied does not equal the amount of matter.  
Why is this important?  
As businesses grow, many of them begin to occupy larger amounts of space. They take over their market and capitalize on their economy of scale. However, unless they're careful, they increase their reach without increasing the strength of their business. They bloat like a balloon  
That's when they become vulnerable to disruption. A smaller company discovers how to significantly increase the amount of value they provide, and even though they lose by a space advantage, they have strength within their small rank and they begin to win the market. They pop the balloon  
This is an important rule to remember in business: mass does not equal space occupied. It’s not about taking up more space than the next guy. It’s about who packs the biggest punch.  
The mass of your customers or clients  
Building Mass  
When you begin to look at your business from the perspective of mass, not merely size, you begin to measure based on the impact you're having on the market and the value you're providing to your people.  
What are specific ways that you can increase mass?

1. *You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority.*  
2. *You can provide guarantees.*  
3. *You can find ways to delight your customers.*   
4. *You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service.*   
5. *Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider.* 

Again, the business that measures itself by the value they provide to the customer (rather than the size of their company), will be the one who owns the gravitational pull.  
Be that one.  
Be the best you.

Proximity: The closer you can get to your customers, while distancing yourself from your competitors, the stronger your pull on your customers or clients.  
\--  
You can have Goliath companies that occupy all kinds of industry real estate, but when you look inside, they've got very little fighting power. Meanwhile, you can have smaller David companies that are much smaller on the surface but pack a powerful punch.  
Without offering up specific names, some of the large advertising firms have a broad presence but provide extremely sloppy and poorly managed ad campaigns for their clients. It's not uncommon for well-educated, savvy consultants to easily outperform these big companies.  
You might see a Goliath whose inwardly rotting away.  
\---  
What are specific ways that you can increase mass?

1. You can provide credibility, notoriety, or authority. You might produce hard, results-oriented case studies, or simply capture testimonials from your happy customers or clients. You might leverage a story of overturning a sacred ideal within your industry. You might seek out other platforms to establish your credibility with interviews, books, articles, etc. It's worth something to do business with someone who's respected in their industry.  
2. You can provide guarantees. Many businesses are scared of offering guarantees because they're afraid people will take advantage of them. However, many times the benefit far outweighs the cost. You might guarantee freshness, quality, timeliness, or effectiveness. If you're in an industry where business owners scoff guarantees (or if you doubt whether you can offer one), you're probably in a ripe opportunity for a guarantee.  
3. You can find ways to delight your customers. Hunt for the right spot for your team members. Make sure the person on the phone has a smile on their face (yourself included\!). Make sure the people doing fulfillment have the detail and follow-through required. Have a team member send reminder text messages or phone calls.  
4. You can innovate ways to provide a higher quality (or higher value) service. Find ways to get better results at a substantially lower cost. Automate the pieces that are human. Humanize the pieces that are automated. Reduce the response time. Find a way to improve the results.  
5. Become the person of integrity, the trusted provider. To borrow the words of Margaret Thatcher, "If you have to tell people you’re \[a person of integrity\], you aren't." However, if you can prove to people that you have integrity (especially in businesses that require high trust), you've just increased the value you provide.

Three emails on Gravity:

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever experienced a business’s gravitational pull? It’s uncanny\!  
You waltz in, unawares, and quickly find yourself sucked into their vortex--and happy about it\! It’s so delightful you find yourself wanting to dole out cash to them. Even when they're selling to you, it feels comfortable and right to be handing over your money. (And if they deliver on their promise, you’re grateful for every dollar you spent.)  
But maybe you’ve experienced the opposite: a business with no gravitational pull whatsoever.  
If you don't know what I mean, take a trek to your local laundromat, look for the community bulletin board and find that dog-eared business card for a handyman. The phone number is scribbled out and another number scratched above it. Any chance that handyman's getting a call from you when your wife texts you at work, complaining the faucet is leaking and she'd like it fixed yesterday?  
Not a chance in the world\!  
You're more likely to hang up whatever you're doing, drive home, and fix that confounded leak yourself before you have some fly-by-night creep working in your house.  
That's not gravitational pull. That's anti-gravity. And it pushes customers away.  
Most businesses are simply average--lying somewhere between those two extremes. Some of them are profitable, others aren't. Yet all of them (assuming they're a sound business) really could dramatically improve their bottom line by creating this gravitational pull.  
In marketing, we call it "positioning".  
While we can all recognize this gravitational pull, most of us find it much harder to define. Nevertheless, we can't deny its strong effect\!  
When gravity it works against you, if feels like you have to...

* Beg others to work with you.  
* Oversell...try too hard to persuade others to do business with you.  
* Tolerate any ole customer who comes your way.

For some businesses, the transition is easy. If you're a handyman, it’s as simple as becoming known as the guy who always returns phone calls and shows up on time. For other businesses, the transition is more challenging.  
If you're not actively working to shift the pull of gravity, you're fighting a losing battle. Once you've "got it," however, everything seems to get easier:

* You don't have to chase prospects. They want to work with you.  
* You don't have to fight at the feeding trough to bid the bottom dollar. People are willing to pay what you're worth.  
* You don't have to defend yourself, because people see the value you provide.

When you've got it, the tables turn and everything becomes dramatically easier.  
Over the next few weeks, I’m going to talk more about what it takes to create a gravitational pull in business.  
It comes down to two factors (just like physics): proximity and mass.  
Proximity is all about being as close to your customers and as distant from your competitors as possible.  
Mass is about who--regardless of size--can actually pack the biggest punch.  
Master these two things and customers won’t be able to resist working with you.  
And when customers find you irresistible, you’ll have found how to…

Follow up to Idea Babies Email  
{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever discovered an idea so good you couldn’t let it go? It’s as if you fall in love with the idea and never want to leave it’s side. You get that glazed-over, rosey-eyed look and you feel like you’re walking on air.  
Unfortunately, falling in love with an idea is dangerous when it comes to business.   
Here’s why it’s a problem. When we fall in love with an idea we often end up nurturing the product, business, or employee much longer than we should. Because we’re so emotionally invested, we can’t let it go--even if it’s proving to be unprofitable.  
Of course, it’s okay if you choose to be unprofitable and still pursue the idea. Just be aware that it’s just that--it’s by your choice--and by doing so, you reduce your impact on the world.  
As entrepreneurs, many of us struggle with the guilt of starting too many projects and not completing them all. Yet, continuing to hurt yourself won’t pay for that guilt. It’ll just make it worse.   
Sometimes the best thing you can do is simply cut your losses and move on.  
It can be hard to let go of ideas. It’s kind of like spring cleaning your office. By cutting loose your bad ideas, you’ll suddenly find yourself feeling fresh and free again.  
And that’s when you can really push to...

Justine Musk once told us to forget making a billion dollars and become passionate about providing what the world needs. She said to pinpoint what only you and you alone can offer to the world. To take two things--fields, hobbies, genres--that you’re a master at and combine them.  
This certainly seems to have worked well for her ex-husband. Elon Musk, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time, has degrees in both physics and economics. So then, according to Justine’s advice, it shouldn’t surprise us that he’s revolutionized the car, space, and financial services industries (Tesla, SpaceX, and Paypal).  
This is the essence of any great innovation. And it’s certainly not limited to only entrepreneurship. Chefs do it all the time when they mix and match the most random ingredients to create the latest palatable rage.  
Take a moment to stop and consider two or more things that you’re really good at. How could you take those two strengths to provide what your customer needs?

# Email \#060 \- Bad Actions Don’t Mean Evil Motives

* Bad Actions Don’t Mean Evil Motives

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Did you ever read those “choose your own adventure” books growing up? You know, the ones where you get to the end of the chapter and it tells you to turn to page 59 if Janet chooses Option A, but if she chooses Option B, then turn to page 65? They used to be a big deal back in the day.

Well, today I’m going to tell you a “choose your own adventure” story, only this time you get to be the protagonist.  
Imagine you’ve been hired as a lead salesperson at a new tech company. You arrive at work Monday morning ready to conquer anything the week throws at you.  
Marching to your new workspace, you greet your coworkers, Tyler and Ame, who are chatting up a storm by the espresso machine. Making a mental note to bring your own personal mug tomorrow, you round the corner and nearly run over your new manager.   
“Good morning, ma’am\!” you say, trying to forget the awkward near run-in.  
“Mornin’,”  she mumbles.  
   
A little taken aback by her lack of eye contact and low energy, you brush it off and don’t think much about it the rest of the day.  
But then the next day, the scene plays itself out again. This time, your boss greets you with an air of a warm smile, but the contortion on her face betrays her real feelings toward you. After several days, just saying “Hello” becomes down right awkward.  
Flabbergasted at what you could’ve done to set her against you already, you’re certain she hates you.  
Now here’s your choice:

1. Continue assuming that she hates your guts. Uncertain about what’s wrong, you mull it over in your head until you’re convinced she has a vendetta to make you miserable. You discuss it with Tyler and Ame. “Yes,” they agree, “she’s got some marks against you.” Taking this to heart you begin to resent her for it until you openly confront her one day with the full force of your bottled frustration. You eventually walk out after a nasty Steve Jobs style power-struggle.

	  
or you could...

1. Take an opportunity to meet in her office and  just get curious. Ask if there’s anything you’re doing wrong and how you could improve. It may or may not be your fault but at least you’ll know for certain. And you’ll know how to correct ship, if possible.

What do you choose?  
Granted, the story may be a little over-dramatic, but you get the point: functioning out of assumptions is a dangerous habit.  
And when we do assume, we’re often much quicker to assume negative motives rather than positive motives behind actions we don’t understand.  Whenever we do this, we destroy trust. And without trust, we self-destruct even our most valued relationships.  
The only things we can actually measure are people’s actions and words. Even if someone does or says something hurtful, we still cannot assume their motives. They may not be doing it because they’re militant. In fact, most likely, they’re doing it because they feel pressured and uncared for.  
This doesn’t excuse their hurtful deeds. Every one of us has a responsibility to do good to others. But just because they are responsible for their actions, doesn’t mean we have a right to assume the worst about their motives.  
To do so would not only shoot our own businesses in the foot, but it would ruin our relationships as well.  
Believe the best about your fellow man and you’ll continue to…  
Be the best you\!

Imagine you’ve been called into your boss's office. Trying not to look nervous, you manage a weak I-have-nothing-to-hide smile. She returns the smile and closes the door before going back behind her desk.

Many business owners build their companies to meet their own needs.   
To their own demise.  
The hard truth is that your customers don’t care whether you make a lot of money, fulfill your calling, or any of that. All they’re thinking about is their own unmet needs.  
To be successful in any line of work, you have to focus on what your customers need.  
Justine Musk (the first wife of billionaire and serial entrepreneur Elon Musk) put it like this: “Shift your focus away from what you want (a billion dollars) and get deeply, intensely curious about what the world wants and needs.”  
In other words, ask yourself what your customers want. What are they hungry for and itching to get their hands on? How can you uniquely provide that for your customers? What sets you apart? Are there ideas you could mesh together to create brand new solutions that stand apart from any other competition?  
In business, unselfishness is richly rewarded. Build your business strategy around what the customer wants and you’ll be unstoppable.

Do you ever miss the simpler days of childhood? The days when we didn’t have to worry about showing up to work on time or communicating clearly with a team of employees or year-end strategy evaluations. Sometimes I miss those days when my biggest problem was trudging through one more grueling hour of social studies.  
I miss those days only because now I have twenty years’ worth of perspective and new problems that make washing the dishes seem like play-time. Yet, back then, working my way through a mountain of crusty dishes seemed like a real problem that I couldn’t wait to get away from.  
A big lie we tell ourselves when advancing to the next level is that our problems will finally disappear once we level-up.   
While our life should continually be getting better, the fantasy that we’ll eventually arrive at a plateau where all our problems are gone is simply not true.  
Whether it’s when we’re becoming an independent adult for the first time, developing a new skillset, or scaling our businesses, we will always have problems.  
Every new solution introduces new problems.   
We experienced this when we decided to bring our print publication, The Multiplier, in-house. It did solve a lot of problems. Instead of being dry stock content produced by professionals, it became a fresh, personal letter from our team. At the same time, it produced problems of efficiency, teamwork, and communication that we’re still developing solutions for.  
Just like growing into adults required us to face more responsibility, an opportunity to grow our print publication became an invitation to a new set of bigger problems.  
Unless we’re willing to embrace problems, we’re not cut out for business. (Or we're doomed to live in a business stuck with the same set of problems on an ongoing basis.)  
Trying and failing doesn’t always mean we tried the wrong thing. Often, the solution was correct, but it introduced problems we didn't anticipate.  
As leaders, entrepreneurs, and creatives, let’s stop searching for a problem-free utopia\! Instead of looking for a respite from problems altogether, let’s begin anticipating and embracing the new problems that every level of growth brings.  
As you take on bigger and bigger challenges, you will continue growing yourself to...  
Be the best you\!

If you're in business to avoid problems, you shouldn't be in business. Every solution introduces additional problems, the growth is always an invitation to a set of bigger problems. Unless you're willing to embrace that, you're not made for business, or you're made to live in a business that is stuck with the same set of problems on an ongoing basis.  
If you tried something but failed, it's not always because of what you tried. Sometimes it's because the solution was correct, but it introduced problems that you didn't anticipate.

Over the past several weeks we’ve talked about two dangers: Blind Spots and Control Freaks. Existing blind spots are liable to kill us; being control freaks are liable to destroy our teams.  
The only way to avoid either pitfall is to become Lifelong Learners.

I’ve already written about three ways we can be more transparent right away. (It’s the first step to rebuilding any relationship, vanquishing blind spots, and resisting the control freak).  
This week, I’m inviting you to…  
Invite Feedback.  
Transparency is worthless if we’re not willing to learn from it.  
Picture your life in two halves. One half represents everything everyone knows about you: your quirks, funny habits, and personality. The “Common Knowledge” stuff. The other half represents the stuff only other people know about you. These are the blind spots and since you can’t see them, they can be lethal.  
That’s why it’s so important to be a Lifelong Learner and invite feedback. It’s like asking passengers in a car if they see any vehicles careening your way before you pull out on a busy highway. You ask because the passengers have a better perspective on the surroundings. They can see things you can’t.  
There are many ways we can continually invite feedback from others, but today I’m only going to share two of my favorites.  
1\. Build a culture of informal honesty  
Here at Multiply Your Strengths, we’ve striven to create a culture where we can freely give honest feedback, even if unasked for. This is made possible because we all want to grow and see each other grow. However, it also presents several pitfalls we should be aware of.  
Giving honest feedback can be painful for both the giver and the receiver. That’s why the first thing we must do is detach performance from value. Otherwise, we will take criticism personally and allow it to affect our self-worth. Second, honesty must include intentional feedback when we see positive growth, otherwise we’ll weary of criticism.  
2\. Assemble an intentional Circle of Lifelong Learners  
As important as informal feedback is, just having a few conversations at the water cooler won't get you the full way to your potential. The best way get to your fullest potential is to gather a group of trusted friends and mentors who can speak intentionally and decisively into your life. What they say may be hard to swallow at times--and you may choose at times to disregard it--but it’s the quickest and most effective way to grow.  
Feedback is crucial to growing as a leader and entrepreneur. Transparency won’t work without feedback and feedback won’t work without transparency.  
Like I said, feedback is also a very important part of the MYS tribe of Lifelong Learners. We’ve realized how much we need your feedback regarding these emails in order to make them best serve you\! Would you mind taking a few minutes to fill out our 2017 Reader’s Survey?

Have you ever had an itch on your back that you couldn’t reach on your own? You’re forced to either lean against the wall and scratch it like a feral grizzly bear or ask a friend to itch it for you.  
There’s no question about it: We need other people in our lives. Whether it’s to scratch our back, point out unbearable personality flaws, or to catch otherwise-overlooked details in the budget, we need a community. Every lasting business and every deep relationship depends on the support of a committed community.  
In light of that, I wanted to share a quick illustration with you that will help tie together everything we’ve been talking about the past five emails. It’s called the Johari Windows. Created by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham (whose combined names became “Johari”), it was designed to help people see how they can better their relationships with themselves and others.  
The concept is pretty simple. The left two boxes represent everything you can see. The top two boxes represents everything others can see.  
You can see it in this illustration:  
The Common Knowledge box contains all the facts, traits, and habits other people--including you--already know about you.  
The Blind Spots box holds the information (facts, traits, habits) everyone else knows about you, but you can’t see. To eliminate blind spots, you must receive feedback from the people who can see them. This is typically those you work or live with.  
The Private Information box is the private information people don’t know about you because you haven’t shared it with them.  
The Untapped Potential box contains all of the information (facts, traits, habits) you can’t tap into because neither you nor anyone else can see it.  
All you have to do to become a Lifelong Learner and tap into your fullest potential is increase your transparency and invite feedback. As you can see in this illustration, when you do that, your Common Knowledge increases, while your Untapped Potential decreases.  
At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I’m going to say this again because it is so important to your growth as an entrepreneur, leader, and person.  
Increasing transparency, inviting feedback, and embracing change is the only way to become a Lifelong Learner.  
And only when you’re a Lifelong Learner, will you…  
Be the best you\!

* How Fast You Grow Is How Fast You Go  
* Grow Faster, Go Faster

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Five months ago, I made a decision in our marketing that caused quite a few hiccups and, for a while, ended up slowing us down.  
   
Over the past four weeks, we’ve talked about being Lifelong Learners.   
In particular, we’ve noted two traits that help us overcome blinds spots and avoid becoming the dreaded control freaks. That is, of course, to be transparent and invite feedback. Either is essential to serious personal growth.  
However, there’s a catch: being transparent and inviting feedback will only get us understanding and information. They won’t actually make a lasting effect over the long haul. They’re completely useless unless we...  
Embrace Change.  
You might say embracing change goes without saying. Unfortunately, all too often we resist change rather than embracing it.  
We’ve tried to do our best at embracing change within our company. For example, in the beginning days of our print publication, The Multiplier, we outsourced to a company that provided stock content. However, we heard from our readers that they connected the most with personal content. So we brought The Multiplier in-house.  
Ever since then, we’ve been publishing it as a team. All the content is written by either me or my assistant Chris, who then delegates the proofreading and design to the rest of the team.  
Doing this definitely put more work and responsibility on all of our shoulders. Sometimes we barely make the deadline--and sometimes we’ve even missed it\!  
Embracing that change has definitely been uncomfortable\! Yet, we’re learning and growing together as a team, we’re representing our business much more clearly, and, most importantly, our readers are enjoying much better content as a result\!  
There’s no science to “embracing change.” As much as I’d like to, I can’t write out a two or three step formula for you too follow.  
This is because it’s not a formula you can execute on. It’s a mindset that you have to embrace.  
You must decide that you will embrace growth and improvement, even if it’s uncomfortable. After all, that’s what made us entrepreneurs in the beginning.  
At the end of the day, resisting change is to plant our feet in the shallow valley of “today.” There’s no movement or momentum, no progress or success without change.  
So whether it means changing our business strategy, changing our product, changing our attitudes--no matter what it is, we embrace healthy change. And we do it readily.  
Only when you are transparent, inviting feedback, and ready to embrace change are we able to…  
Be the best you\!

Title:

* **The First Tool to Restoring Any Relationship**  
* **Three Ways to Becoming More Transparent**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Nobody likes to work under a control freak. (Neither does anybody set out to be one\!) Yet they’re commonplace.   
In the last email, I said the only way to avoid becoming the dreaded control freak everybody hates was to adopt the three traits of a Lifelong Learner, the first being...  
Transparency.  
Transparency is a major buzzword these days and too often overrated. Nevertheless, it is an important trait to develop. So how do you actually go about building it?  
Without transparency in a relationship, we get stuck behind our own facades: public personas that don’t reflect who we really are. These facades separate us from each other like walls between neighbors. They inhibit communication, teamwork, and camaraderie.  
So, again, how do you develop healthy transparency?   
First, realize that transparency comes in layers. Not everyone deserves to hear everything about your life. However, there are a few things you can start doing right now to develop transparency and build trust in your relationships.  
1\. Share insignificant details about your personal life  
People are drawn toward people they know personally and can relate to. For example, your son's t-ball career may not seem significant to your employees or coworkers, but sharing that small detail of your life can break down the walls distancing yourself from others. The fact that you have a son who plays t-ball just like their son or daughter reminds them you’re a real person with an actual life, not just a money-making machine.  
2\. Readily admit when you’re wrong and someone else is right  
There is no virtue in being obstinate. If someone else’s idea is better than yours, admit it\! Seeing their ideas and contribution appreciated will prove that you’re a safe person to work with. (And that they play a critical role in the success of your business.)  
3\. Talk about the things that inspire or discourage you  
Closely related to the first one, talking about your own personal struggles or ambitions can go a long way in building camaraderie with people. More importantly, though, it gives them opportunities to speak into your life. If no one knows what discourages you, holds you back, or gives you an extra boost of momentum, no one can help you overcome those roadblocks. It’s lonely, discouraging, and greatly impedes your progress.  
That’s why transparency is essential to building successful relationships in any arena of life. It’s the weld that holds relationships together. Without it, failure is inevitable. And those dangerous blind spots we talked about several weeks ago? They will be there until you develop transparency.  
Transparency is the first step to becoming a Lifelong Learner.  
Do what it takes to tear down any walls between you and others around you by striving to be as transparent as possible. It will do more than anything to help you…  
Be the best you\!

Email 2:  
1\. You build trust by sharing personal information/struggles/joys/ambitions with people  
Axed:  
3\. Ask questions about other people’s lives  
This might not immediately seem related to “transparency,” but it actually plays a significant role. Asking others about themselves stakes a surprising amount of vulnerability. This is why people generally trust those who (at the very least) seem interested in their lives. Ask your employees or co-workers about their dreams and desires. It may not (currently) be to stay with your company, but their trust in you will sky-rocket if they know you care about those details and want to help achieve them.

As we know, it’s just a stereotype: true in a few cases, but not across the board. Thankfully, rising to success doesn’t mean you have to become a control freak (or any sort of freak for that matter). In fact, the alternative is as simple as changing your mentality.  
Leaders become “control freaks” out of insecure ambition. They only see one route to achieving their goal, therefore, any “rerouting” an employee or partner attempts to make is a threat to a highly-cherished ambition. Not only that, but other perspectives are an insult to their intelligence.  
Control freaks see only one path--their path--and because they’re driven, they won’t let anyone deter them (or their companies) from that path.  
Nobody wants to become a control freak: they’re hard to work with and disliked. So how do we avoid becoming one?  
The only way to dodge a life as a control freak is to become a Lifelong Learner.  
Lifelong Learners are defined by three traits:

1. They’re transparent: they disclose information about themselves  
2. They invite feedback: they ask others to critique them and their work   
3. They embrace healthy change: they make adjustments according to what they discover through intentional critique

No matter how valuable your end-goal may be and no matter how efficient you’ve made your strategy (or path) to get there--you can only gain by hearing criticism and learning from it.  
If you are free to admit areas where you’re growing or need to grow and invite feedback from those closest to you--and learn from it--your momentum will be unstoppable.  
I’m going to focus on each of these traits over the next three weeks. Digging in and exploring what it really means to become a Lifelong Learner (and escape exile as the loathsome control freak).  
In the meantime,   
Be the best you\!

The brand new Civic lurched back as Seth stomped on the gas and veered around the SUV in front of him.

“Slow down, Seth\! I’d rather be late than in a wreck.”  
“You know the boss hates it when we’re late,” Seth shot back. And his coworkers continued bracing themselves against the seats as he weaved his way through the miserable L.A. traffic.  
“By the way, Ryan,” Seth said adjusting the mirror to look at the 30-year-old. “Did you grab that folder the boss asked us to bring?”  
“Yup\! Got it right her--watch out\!” Ryan screamed at the driver.  
Hearing Ryan’s yell, Seth swerved hard left into the median but not before smacking the side of a large truck. The car crashed into the median barrier with a screech and explosion of airbags.  
The pounding in Seth’s chest drowned out the sputtering of the wrecked Honda and the groaning of his startled passengers.

“What on earth were you doing?” Ryan demanded from the back. Seth’s knuckles turned white gripping the steering wheel.  
“I’m sorry,” Seth replied. “I never saw him.”

“Check your blindspots\!” is one of the first rules we learn as new drivers.   
Yet, it doesn’t only apply to driving. It’s also one of the first rules in relationships, as well. No matter what relationship we’re talking about--business, friendship, romance--we all have blindspots.  
“You might have them, but I don’t,” some of us could be tempted to say.  
Which is exactly why they’re called blind spots.   
Like blind spots on the road, blind spots in a relationship can be devastating if we don’t check them constantly.

Blind spots in relationships are the habits you do, phrases you say, gestures you make that affect people without you knowing. For example, you may have a habit of interrupting people before they finish speaking a thought, the tone of voice you use under pressure, or the way you hold your breath when you’re anxious. This can have detrimental affects on your communication (and it could even destroy your relationships). Yet if no one tells you, you may never realize you do it. It’s a blind spot.  
So what do we do about it?  
Well, we can do a couple of things.  
First, we can invite feedback from others. People who know us can help expose the areas of weakness we can’t see on our own. Just as Ryan exposed one of Seth’s blind spots and informed him of the presence of a truck, so our friends can expose the weaknesses we can’t see ourselves. Most times, we need to specifically ask for feedback.  
Second, we can share personal information about ourselves. Sometimes, our friends can’t see our blind spots because we hide too much of ourselves from them. When we become more transparent and reveal more of what’s going on, we allow them a deeper perspective. While this can be uncomfortable, it often uncovers blind spots that would otherwise have gone undetected.  
Blind spots are detrimental not only to our progress as leaders, but to the growth in our businesses as well. Do what it takes to constantly “check your blind spots” and you’ll always…  
Be the best you\!

Other blind spots can be so hidden, not even our friends can see them. This is an unknown area or, you could say, “Untapped Potential.” We can reduce these areas by sharing information about ourselves with a trusted mentor or friend. Giving others an inside look into our lives will expose any “new” blindspots and decrease our areas of “untapped potential.”

* High Level Productivity  
* Top Level Productivity  
* 5 Focus Tips that Actually Work\!  
* Focus Hour

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
As a leader, your time is your most precious resource. Because of this, your ability to get things done quickly and efficiently is a life-changing tool.  
Yet, if you’re like me, when it comes right down to getting stuff done, distractions are always around the corner. Like a vicious dog, ready to pounce and shred your productivity just when you’re least expecting. This eats up your time, drains your mental energy, and creates more hurdles and frustrations for you to overcome every single day.  
Being able to lock away your distractions becomes an an indispensable tool for any entrepreneur.  
Of course, we already talked about this in last week’s email. This week, like I promised, we’re going to dive deeper and discover some valuable tips on how to effectively set aside time to intentionally focus on the important things.  
So here we go.  
As we’ve noted, important work is often the most difficult. Therefore, it’s EASY to get distracted doing anything other than the important task at hand.  
That’s why, recently, I’ve been nurturing a habit of spending an hour a day to focus intentionally on those difficult but important tasks.  
This can be both EXHAUSTING and EXHILARATING. Focusing intentionally on high-value work can help you “zone-in” and get things done. Unfortunately, it also takes a lot of mental and physical energy to do.  
So how can we make the most of the exhilaration while minimizing the exhaustion?  
How to Focus Well  
1\. Set a time frame that works for you.   
This is crucial to getting the most out of your focus time. If you’re in your office, set aside an hour for a specific task that is important to get done that day. Remember to drink water and use the restroom ahead of time, so you can stay at your desk the entire hour.  
This is important because in order for this hour to work, you must NOT get up until the hour is over. So find a good time and be ready to stay put.  
2\. Turn off your Wi-Fi and completely silence your cell phone.  
If you find yourself picking up your phone or checking your email, you’re going to slow down and start thinking about other things. This will kill your momentum.   
If you want this focus hour to actually work, take it seriously and turn off your Wi-Fi and your phone. Those emails and texts can wait.  
3\. Do it in the morning when your energy and creativity levels are the highest.   
This is when it’s easiest to concentrate. If you do more than an hour, do it early in the week when you’ve got the most mental energy after a restful weekend.  
4\. Don’t do it just because a task “needs to be done”.   
If you’re doing it simply because it “needs to be done”, it’s a clue that you may be working on the wrong thing. While it might be important, it’s probably not the \#1 priority. You may be better off delegating it.  
5\. Eliminate reactivity as much as possible.   
This world is wired to get you distracted. Getting a crystal-clear vision on what you need to do and maintaining realistic expectations of when it can happen is key to succeeding during your focus hour.  
This hour is not set aside for replying to emails, answering phone calls, responding to texts, or running errands for stuff other people could get. There’s a time and place for that. That time is not during your focus hour. Make this hour about getting the important, high value stuff done.   
(At times, your most important work may involve some email. However, do it with caution--it’s easy to get sucked into your inbox and sidetracked from what you’re working on. Usually, however, emailing could happen at a lower value time, such as at the end of the day or week.)  
Your effectiveness as a leader depends on your ability to get important things done. Take the time to intentionally focus. Experiment on what works best for you. Then knock that high-value “to-do” list out of the park.  
Do this and you’ll be well on your way to...  
Being the best you\!

Highly valuable, Intentional Focus

* **My \#1 Advice for Beating Distractions**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
My assistant Chris is a writer. That’s a big part of his job. (I’m even training him to do some copywriting for MYS).  
As a writer, he knows well the struggle against distractions. Even if he turns his computer on airplane mode, the World Wide Web is just a few clicks away. From Facebook to text messages to YouTube to other writing projects, there’s a ton of interesting--maybe even important--things that call his name when he sits down to write.  
But no matter how important those things maybe, they’re still distractions. If he’s writing, the most important thing for him to do is write. In that moment, nothing is more important.  
So what’s my advice to Chris? (He’s the one who suggested writing about this, by the way.)  
Dedicate a specific timeslot to spend purely in Intentional Focus.  
Most of the pressure of our “to do” list ends up coming from the mental space it occupies--the nagging feeling of “I need to get it done.”   
Oftentimes, it’s actually not that complicated. It usually comes down to either delegating it to someone else or just plain getting it done.  
It’s easy to let distractions rule your day instead of focusing on the core business-building activities. Unless you actively and intentionally focus on your high-value activity, it will take a back burner.  
That’s a death sentence to your business.  
Imagine if the Secretary of Defense spent most of his time planning speeches and attending parties and only a few hours everyday actually creating important defense strategies. The country would be in deep peril\!  
I don’t want my business to be in deep peril\! So I’ve begun developing an important habit. I take an hour everyday to intentionally focus on whatever is most urgent or highest on my priority list.  
Since the most important work is often difficult, I’ve found it’s easy to get stuck rearranging your desk, taking out the trash, checking your email… doing anything to avoid the important task at hand.  
Yet the important task at hand is important.  
Spending an hour in intentional focus is both exhausting and exhilarating. Although focusing on high-value work can “put you in the zone,” it can also use up a lot of mental and even physical energy.  
So how do I actually make it work?  
I’m not perfect yet. Like I hinted, I haven’t been consistent in it. But I’ve definitely learned many valuable (and practical) lessons along the way that have revolutionized my productivity during those focus hours.  
But I’ll get into all of that--including the practical lessons I’ve learned--next week.  
Until then...  
Be the best you\!

I’ll be the first to admit struggling with procrastination. In fact, I procrastinated writing for this month’s edition of The Multiplier so much that I turned my three in articles late. I can happily say I did better for the next edition\!  
I’m sure you’ve never done this, but if you have, let me tell you about the reality check I experienced recently.  
Reality check  
Most of the time when we’re procrastinating, we’re simply exaggerate the magnitude of whatever we’re putting off. In fact, the mental space it occupies actually becomes greater than the actual task.  
When we run into this, we should do one of two things:

1. Either offload whatever we’re procrastinating  
2. Or find a reasonable timeslot to focus specifically on it and just get it done\!

Of course, you could also decide not to do the task. Ever.  
Think of your mind as a storage unit or, even better, as RAM on a computer. There’s only a certain amount of space available in your mind for you to process projects, ideas, relationships, and so forth.  
Just like RAM on a computer, if you leave a task “open,” it will slow down your mental energy and eat away mental capacity for other important tasks.  
To be highly effective leaders, we should be intentional about either “closing down” or “completing” any open tasks so we move on and succeed at even more important tasks.  
There’s too much important work to do for us to get caught in the draining habit of procrastination.   
If you find yourself caught in the procrastination swamp, do what it takes to pop out of it as soon as possible so you can free up your RAM and put your mind to more important tasks.  
And of course, this will help you to increasingly…  
Be the best you\!

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
How often would you say you’re one hundred percent satisfied with what you’ve accomplished in a day? Do you always feel ecstatic when looking at your to-do list in the evening?  
Maybe sometimes, but I bet not very often.  
To-do lists can be helpful because they allow you to track your accomplishments and cross things off your agenda.

But if you’re a Type A, go-get-em kind of person, you likely come to the end of each day with a few things still unfinished.  
This can be discouraging, to say the least.   
Those last two uncrossed bullet points plague your subconscious mind. And they bring with them a host of little lies.  
“You’ll need to work harder tomorrow.” “You have so much to do and so little time.” “Wake up earlier.” “Skip lunch.”  
Sound familiar?  
Here’s the unfortunate yet also wonderful news about life:  
You’re probably much more aware of everything you’re not doing and probably not paying attention to the amount of progress you’re actually making right now.  
When was the last time you made a list of everything you are getting done? Did you sit down in January and think through everything you accomplished last year? 

We only think about those last two unfinished items on the list. We don’t see value in tracking our success, so we don’t.    
Instead, we mentally list all the ways we’re “missing it.” By doing so, we give ourselves the wrong impression of our progress, which quickly leads to discouragement. We look at how much we’ve missed and assume we’re just crawling along at a snail’s pace, while our goals only slip further and further away.  
I know this because I’ve missed things too.  
I've got an awesome software project I haven't launched yet along with critical sales funnels that I haven’t developed. There are incredible people with insight and value who I could be connecting with--I have their info, they’re within reach--but I haven’t. I’ve missed them. I don’t have the time or the focus.  
As I think about these things, I could feel really discouraged and frustrated. I could pound my fist and scold myself for sleeping in too long too often or taking time to help a friend. I could rearrange my schedule and shave a few minutes from family time or needed rest.  
Or, I could take a few minutes to remember some of the big things I have succeeded at. Things like playing a small part in starting a tech center in Canon City or building out the infrastructure and support I need to allow my life to get consistently easier on a daily basis. This included hiring an assistant and continuing to develop Chris, my content marketer--all things I consider high-value accomplishments.  
When I take the time to review what that I'm already doing, I realize I'm making much more progress than I'd thought. This helps instill confidence that I will achieve the things I'm reaching out for.   
Have you taken the time, recently, to remember the things you've accomplished? Take a few minutes and allow yourself to recalibrate your perspective and gain fresh motivation to keep moving forward.  
Recognizing the progress you continue to make will instill the confidence and motivation that will allow you to...  
Be the best you\!

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Over the past several weeks, we’ve been talking about how much your work is making a difference. Last week, I told you the story of George Bailey and how his simple life altered the fate of many.  
This week, I have a question for you.   
It seems simple, but it brings some pretty big perspective.  
How often do you think about farmers?   
Do you think about vegetable farmers as you snap off the end of a nourishing carrot? Last night after taking a bite of that delectably tender steak, did you call up any of the cattle ranchers in Texas who helped raise it to perfection?  
Probably not.  
Yet does that mean you’re ungrateful for their work? Of course not\! Many of us couldn’t grow our own vegetable gardens if we tried, let alone raise our own beef\! We are incredibly grateful to those who work in agriculture because they play a pivotal role in society.  
And here’s my point: The most important work is often the most difficult and the least visible.

Agriculture is hard, often back-breaking labor. Millions of men and women across the country spend their lives and fortunes trying to provide the rest of us with decent produce and edible meat and dairy. Yet, very few of them are honored or applauded by the general public. Some are even scorned.  
You, my entrepreneurial friend, are a farmer in your local economy.  
Just like a farmer, you don’t always see the fruit of your work until you’ve tilled the soil, planted the seeds, irrigated your crop, and prayed for the sunshine to bring it to life.  
Innovation and leadership can be excruciating work and few people ever stop to appreciate it.   
The gentleman strolling down the street past your business doesn’t think about the mental drain it takes to create a master product. No one else is thinking about how to solve dicy conflict on your team. Few people notice the tension on your face as you wait for a customer to finalize the large purchase order you needed weeks ago. The president won’t give you a medal for spending long thankless hours balancing budgets, running payrolls, or calling prospects.  
Everyone wants to be part of the harvest. Who doesn’t enjoy seeing the visible results? Yet without your grit and determination, Entrepreneur, there is no foundation for success. No harvest. No results.  
What you do is hard work, but it’s crucial for economic growth.   
Because you’re a farmer.  
Don’t be discouraged. You’re changing communities. You’re changing lives. And, whether big or small, you are even changing the world.  
Keep being the best you\!

* Matthias

PS: What about you? What are your projects where you’re digging the dirt and praying for rain? What about the places you’re celebrating the harvest? I’d love to hear your story\!  
\---  
Matthias:  
(You can talk about how everyone wants to be part of the harvest and the visible results. And how it’s the grit and determination of the entrepreneur that provides the foundation for that.)  
Well, when I think of it in the context of leadership, dealing with some of my mindset, some of my emotional baggage, etc is not something that lends immediate visible progress, but it's hugely valuable to moving forward.  
Some of the most difficult questions about your business, your longterm direction, your positioning, etc. are also examples of very difficult, yet very important work  
And given some of the direction you’re going, it’s also the training, the preparation, the process, the growth, etc.  
innovating and creating new methods to increase production.

“I suppose it’d been better if I’d never been born at all\!” George Bailey muttered.  
“What’d you say?” the angel asked.  
“I said I wish I’d never been born\!” George yelled.  
This conversation sparked one of the most memorable redemption stories in film history.  
George Bailey, the protagonist of It’s a Wonderful Life, received his wish. He got to see the world as if he’d never been born.  
From rescuing his kid brother who later saved hundred of lives in World War 2, to giving hope to a struggling friend, to saving the infamous Building and Loan which benefited the struggling poor in Bedford Falls--George Bailey had a profound impact on the world around him. An impact many people would’ve never felt had he never been born.  
Last week I promised to begin breaking down the three reasons why your work matters, even if you can’t see it.  
This week, I’m delivering on my promise and I want you to know…  
You’re probably not aware just how much you’re helping other people, even now.  
George Bailey wasn’t extraordinary. He never went to college, he never made it big in business, and he barely even survived financially without his friends. All he did was live life from the goodness of his heart.   
You are George Bailey.  
Unlike George, however, you haven’t had the privilege of seeing what the world would be like without you. You aren’t able to see just how radically you have transformed not only your local community but also the lives of people across the globe.  
So when you’re in that place. When you’re dragging yourself out of bed, questioning whether your work makes any difference at all--remember the little things.   
Remember the energy that came to your customer's eyes as he realized you could provide the financial advice that will help him get out of twenty years worth of debt. Remember the steady income that you are providing for your employees. Never forget that simple cup of water you gave to the thirsty homeless man or the words of life you spoke into an aspiring entrepreneur. Remember, as Clarence wrote, “no man is a failure who has friends.”  
And always remember to...  
Be the best you\!

Sometimes life gets us down.  
We get involved in a personal conflict. We overextend ourselves with too many commitments. We face disappointment from working hard on a project and not seeing the anticipated results. Sometimes, we simply lose interest in our task at hand.  
You can probably list a dozen more reasons why we get discouraged about life and feel like our work doesn’t matter.  
The past few weeks, I’ve faced challenging situations that left me stuck staring at what felt like a turtle's pace. If I’m not careful, it can really get me down. I question whether my work makes any difference. I start to believe my entire life will be spent in this mire.

3. You’re (probably) much more aware of everything you’re not doing...and probably not paying attention to the amount of progress you’re actually making right now.

Don’t lose heart\! Your hard work is making a difference\!  
Keep it up and keep…

This is an invitation to unsubscribe from my mailing list.  
Let me explain:  
Visions are like frogs that undergo metamorphosis. Although they start out looking like tadpoles, they turn into something very different. While retaining the same DNA throughout the process, new visions look as different from their result as a frog does from a tadpole.  
Multiply Your Strengths is going through such a metamorphosis. The DNA of the original vision is still intact. I’m passionate to help people succeed, but the outworking of how I do that is changing.  
In short, I am switching from a "personal development and coaching" focus to a "business services focus."  
Although the core values and concepts in my emails will continue to be the same, the focus will be business. The services I provide will be related to business.  
Since I am not interested in cluttering your inbox, I am giving you the heads-up and the invitation to unsubscribe.  
However, if this new focus will be valuable to you or your business, the door is wide open.  
Thanks for journeying with me\!  
As you experience your own joys and challenges of metamorphosis, always remember…

# Email \#039 \- 12/21/2016 \- Why some People Seem to Lack Common Sense

Title:

* Common Sense  
* **Why Some People Seem to Lack Common Sense**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever noticed how some of the most creative people also lack common sense?  
I think this is because creatives are constantly thinking “outside the box.”  
Here’s the thing, there are two kinds of people:

* People who naturally think “outside” the box (creatives)  
* People who naturally think “inside” the box (traditional thinkers)

If you put creatives into an unfamiliar situation, they’ll think of a new way to solve the problem, which won’t always align with common sense. They’re “creatives” after all\! They may discover a new solution to a tough problem, but they may also end up making the solution much worse than it had to be.  
If you put the latter--traditional thinkers--into an unfamiliar situation, they’ll look for ways to solve the problem based on how other people have solved it or based on similar situations in the past. They may find a solution that’s already proven to work, but they may also find themselves stuck if the solution doesn’t work. They’re thinking “inside the box.”   
Neither way of thinking is inherently wrong, as long as it fits the situation. You don’t want a brain surgeon thinking up a new technique while you’re under his scalpel. Nor do you want your marketing team to only think up ideas other people are already doing.  
Unfortunately, those on either side of the equation can end up feeling stupid if they don’t recognize their strengths. People who think “inside” the box have a more difficult time coming up with new, creative ideas. On the other hand, people who think “outside” the box have a harder time solving simple, commonplace problems.  
Neither one is less important than the other, but trouble follows those who are functioning in the wrong role and don’t understand their weaknesses.  
When creatives and traditional thinkers learn how to work together, they can leverage each other’s strengths to create synergy on their team..  
I’m curious: What kind of thinker are you? Do you tend to think outside the box or do you stick with what’s tried and proven? Shoot me a reply\! I’d love to hear what you’ve learned\!  
And always…

* Toxic Accountability  
* Detoxing Accountability  
* Accountability Detoxed  
* Healthy Accountability  
* When Accountability Goes Sour  
* When Accountability Goes Toxic

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Accountability is essential to leadership and teamwork. Without accountability, we are left alone to struggle with our shortcomings and our whole team suffers for it. With accountability, our team is free to move forward.   
However, since accountability has too often been a method for control, we tend to react negatively to the idea.  
Why does it turn sour and how can we redeem it?  
I've noticed two reasons accountability becomes toxic.

1. Accountability becomes toxic when people aren't foremost accountable to themselves. Accountability with others is always meant to be a safety-net, never a tow-rope. Each individual needs to take ownership of their own outcomes.  
2. Accountability can also become toxic when people don't ask for and receive the help they actually need. If this happens, accountability is merely a way to shame each other for not measuring up or trying hard enough because it doesn't resolve the underlying issue. It only identifies good and poor behavior, which simply creates a cycle of failure.

When people are accountable to themselves and receive the help they need, they can correct their course even when they fail. When we take a healthy approach to accountability, failure is simply another part of learning and growing.  
This is incredibly empowering.  
So how do we detox accountability that goes bad?  
First, we must remove shame.  
Removing shame liberates people to take ownership of their own outcomes without fear of embarrassment. When people expect to be shamed for their failure, they aren’t motivated to do better, but simply to not let others find out next time.  
Second, we must start addressing real problems, not just symptoms.  
It’s become a cliche, but it’s worth reiterating. You cannot heal disease by only addressing symptoms. You heal disease by targeting the root issue causing the symptoms. Although surface issues show what’s wrong deep down, meaningful change only happens as we address root issues.  
For example, a boss could continually reprimand an employee who always turns his assignments in late. This might result in on-time assignments, but it will like add pressure to both the boss and the employee.  
The best method would be to figure out why he’s always late. Does he have too many responsibilities? Is he working outside of his gifting? Is he going through a hard time personally?  
Understanding and helping the employee in these areas will result in better, long-term results.  
By removing shame and addressing the real problems, we can detox our accountability and start developing healthy community.  
Which will help you...  
Be the best you\!

# Email \#037 \- 12/20/2016 \- Staying Connected to Your Vision

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Whenever entrepreneurs become disconnected from their vision, they begin to drift aimlessly, which is a dangerous place for any leader to be.  
For example, when most people make New Year’s resolutions, they write them down and then forget about them. A few weeks or even months later, they’ve forgotten why they’re doing what they do and lose all motivation to continue. That’s why the gyms are so full in January and so empty in March.  
When we become disconnected from our vision, we often feel a loss of momentum and start looking around for something new to do. This gives us a temporary boost of energy, but it often leaves us feeling like we’re moving in circles without clear forward progress.  
As entrepreneurs, we’re on the hunt for the next kill--the next idea, the next venture, the next business, the next opportunity. As we mature, we find ways to curb that desire. However, by doing this, we can also end up separating ourselves from the very thing that makes us come alive.  
How do you stay connected to your vision? How do you avoid being distracted by a hundred other shiny ideas?  
I’ve found it’s actually not that complicated.  
Every morning, I’ve made it a practice to review my vision. This isn’t a mystical “purpose statement,” but simply a clear picture of where I want to go.  
And that’s the context which frames the actions of my day. It not only provides the safeguards against distractions, but it also provides a tremendous amount of energy knowing exactly why I get up every single morning.  
If you’re having trouble staying connected to your vision, I encourage you to check out Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planning course. Yes, that’s an affiliate link, and here’s why.  
I’ve invested in a lot of training over the past few years but this has by far given me the most results the quickest. It’s specifically designed for visionary entrepreneurs. If that’s not you, that’s okay--it’s not for you.  
Regardless, I encourage you to make a habit of reviewing your vision every single day. If you don’t have a vision that energizes you and motivates you, build one that does. If your days don’t line up with that vision, find a way to make your day a stepping stone to that vision.  
We were all born for more than mediocrity, and as we continue taking action towards our unique contribution to the world, we will all help each other…  
Be the best you.

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},

Do you ever find it hard to balance long-term vision with short-term day-to-day planning?  
If so, you are just like many entrepreneurs.  
Entrepreneurs often get caught in one of two places:

1. Heads stuck in the clouds of a big-picture vision  
2. Snowed under with a thousand small details

The problem with \#1 is you end up transfixed by the big-picture without ever implementing a plan to get there.  
The problem with \#2 is you spend a tremendous amount of time and activity meandering through life without ever arriving at your destination.  
A 5-year plan is too broad of a target to be able to get strong clarity. Who knows what could change in the next five years? There’s no specific path to follow.  
However, if you just show up every day with nothing more than an inner sense of where you want to go, you’ll be so reactionary you’ll never make meaningful progress toward your goal. There might be a path, but no long-term destination.  
To reach your destination, you must create both long-term and short-term plans, zooming in-and-out from the big picture to the specific details every day.   
Reviewing that long and short term perspective every day enables you to make much better decisions on your daily activity.  
It has certainly helped me. The planning system I’ve been using recently has made such a tremendous difference for me, it’s too good not to recommend to others. Most planning systems feel overwhelming and stifling, but this one is lightweight yet very effective.  
Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planner Course addresses how to not only articulate your vision but also break it down into manageable day-to-day tactics.  
This time of year, I get pitched a lot of goal-setting advice. This is the first one I’ve felt like I could actually integrate into my life on an ongoing basis (not just as a hyped-up New Years event). That’s why I signed up as an affiliate, because it has worked wonders for me.  
Nevertheless, like I said last week, it’s not for everyone. This is specifically designed for busy entrepreneurs and overwhelmed visionaries, though it does require you to engage with the content and develop specific daily habits. If you are feeling a disconnect between your big-picture vision and your day-to-day tactics, and nothing else seems to be helping, I encourage you to check out Alex Charfen’s Momentum Planner Course.  
It may just work for you\! (If not, you’re covered by a full refund for 60 days.)

“Just a few more minutes of sleep,” Brian moaned still half asleep.  
The sheets twisted around his body as he rolled over to look at the clock, again, which now read: 6:46 A.M.   
“Ugh\!” he thought. “I’m still so tired\! I don’t need to start work until eight, so I’ll skip my jog and sleep another fifteen minutes.”  
The rationale seemed logical and the sleep so much more desirable than the exercise at the moment. Later in the day, however, as he looked at the developing pouch around his midsection, he scolded himself for being lazy and recommitted to his morning exercise routine. Just as he had done the day before, and the day before that, and the day before that…   
You get the picture. Brian is a procrastinator.  
Have you ever been in Brian’s situation? Perhaps you are right now\! Perhaps there’s some other pressing task you are avoiding by checking your email. To be honest, there are some distractions tempting me from focusing on this email.   
We all struggle to feel motivated at times.   
Sometimes we’re like Brian, struggling to get out of our comfortable beds, so we rationalize why something doesn’t need to be done now and indulge in a few more winks.  
Other times, we’re distracted by good things, like organizing our desks or checking our email. But all of these should take lower priority if the accountant needs a financial report done by noon and it’s 11:15 A.M.   
If you’ve been in this place, take heart\! You’re not alone\!  
“I know this article is due tonight, but I’m just not motivated to write\!” “I know we need more sales calls, but I don’t feel like getting rejected a hundred times\!” “I know relationships are strained at home, but calling a family meeting seems so stressful.”  
We’ve all mentally acknowledged “such and such” needs to be done, but struggled to find the drive or desire to do it.  
In reality, these moments of procrastination probably have little to do with “laziness” or lack of motivation (or whatever you chide yourself for).  
Rather, they often result from a lack of clarity.  
Momentum and motivation plummet when we forget what we’re striving toward and (more importantly) why we’re striving toward it.  
We come up with a million excuses. “My mind will be clearer tomorrow.” “I’ll watch just one more episode.” “I need to clean my desk.”  
During these moments, we should remind ourselves what we actually need to get done.

* *“I need to make 10 sales calls.”*   
* *“This order needs to be shipped by Friday.”*   
* “I need to write a letter to my parents.”

And often, we may need to dig even deeper to the “Big Why.”

* *“Making these calls will promote my business, which is helping to create jobs for people in need.”*  
* *“Fulfilling this order ahead of time will delight my customer and they’ll be more likely to support my business in the future.”*  
* *“Writing this letter will encourage my parents, because they have been so lonely lately. They deserve to hear from me.”*

If you find yourself struggling with motivation, instead of beating ourselves up over it, take some time to remember “the what” and “the why.”  
It might only take five seconds. It might mean dedicating one morning to journal. Maybe a walk to clear your head is all you need.  
In fact, I’ve started doing that every single morning. Why don’t you do the same?  
It is important to keep a razor sharp focus on “the what” and “the why” so in every moment you can strive to...

# Personality and Breakthrough

I’m going to be honest with you: I think most of what we’re taught about motivation is nonsense.   
There has to be something that allows me to access the "Lion" or "D" within me to get the results that I need to get. How can I train myself to move into different arenas?  
Also, how can I learn how to honor and enter into the "Beaver" or "C" personality type? This is a key about what I don't enjoy Church or some aspects of it. This is why I find it so utterly boring at times. There is little or no activity or change. This is also why some people get so restless in church and other situations. It takes years to get to the punchline.  
There is also a dramatic shift in the emotional state of the service. One of the reasons why people don't share in family altar is because of the lowered emotional state of the service. You can see people getting stuck in anxious boredom.   
There is also a high need to technical accuracy and official endorsement etc.   
What if I would invest considerably more effort in thinking about how to contribute to the church? What are the raw actions that are needed? If I can tap into this at will, it would give me a huge shift.  
This is where personal development meets spirituality.  
The message today was about choices and the long term impact of those choices. I had a hard time picking that up.  
Wow, so I would also say this is a lot of raw, unfiltered processing. :-)  
I think the huge thing for me is “Harnessing Your Natural Grit” or Flipping the Motivation Switch or something like that. Deadlines are the things that really kick it into action, and if it’s not that, it’s sometimes having a new project with a TON of momentum.  
However, the deadlines have been useful for me. For some people, the best way to approach it is to build it. For others, it’s to experiment. Other people have to get the facts. Whatever it is, we need to help people get into the zone.  
When you can find that, you can “flip” your switch on or off at will. It puts you in charge of your motivation.  
Personally, I think there are a lot of nonsense views about motivation. Everyone is motivated. You just have to understand where and how.  
If you put researchers in charge of an organization, it will slow down. If visionaries/entrepreneurs run it by themselves, they will take into utter chaos.  
The key is learning how let people be themselves  
A person with a typical type C personality appears to lack emotions, does not usually assert themselves and wants to pacify others.  
Type D personality, a concept used in the field of medical psychology, is defined as the joint tendency towards negative affectivity (e.g. worry, irritability, gloom) and social inhibition (e.g. reticence and a lack of self-assurance).  
NOTES:

* *Different people are motivated differently*  
* *Clarity is crucial, whenever I have lack of clarity is when I get bogged down*  
* *For Matt, urgency is important, but it’s not that way for everybody*  
* *A lot of people say we’re motivated by rewards, sometimes that’s the case*  
* *You push through your day job to do your own thing. That’s what’s motivating you to push through your day job/lose sleep*  
* *Some people are very motivated to start projects, some are motivated to finish projects. Kolbe angle, some people are motivated to start new ideas, some people are motivated to prioritize and systematize*  
* *Some people are motivated to see tangibles, to see the finish project, build a house and see the actual product*

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Do you ever struggle to feel motivated in your day-to-day routines?  
If so, you’re not alone\! Many of us feel the same way.  
“I just wasn’t motivated to get started on work today.” “I don’t feel motivated to sell my product.” “I’m motivated to pursue relationships.”  
We mentally acknowledge that “such and such” needs to be done, but there’s no drive, no desire--no motivation--to do it.  
I’m going to be honest with you: I think most of what we’re taught about motivation is nonsense.   
The reality is, everyone is motivated. We just don’t always understand where and how.  
For example, we visionaries do well at leading organizations because they have a strong idea of where they want to go. But we often get bogged down in the details along the way.  
We know where we want to go, but we lack motivation to do the things that will get us there.  
So if we run the organization by ourselves, we will take it into utter chaos. Thus, we need more detail oriented people to help us research, plan, and execute the important details.   
However, if you put these researchers in charge, the organization will slow it down.   
The key is learning how to let people be themselves, while also stretching them to grow and learn.

* Stop Being Reactionary

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
It’s often tough for entrepreneurs to focus on the big picture of their big goals. Because of this, we often find it difficult to stay proactive in taking the small steps that keep our business moving forward toward our goal.   
We face an assortment of demands every day--deadlines, emails, text messages, random drop-ins from friends or customers--and we get lost in the chaos. Instead of being proactive in taking the important small steps, we become reactive to all the demands constantly assaulting our attention.  
To help navigate this chaos, a few years ago I started implementing a basic morning routine. I knew a routine would consistently set me up for daily success. However, I didn’t have the structure I needed to sustain it. In fact--I have to admit--I didn’t want the structure to maintain it because structure felt limiting, cold, and lifeless. And so, the routine faded away.  
I’ve struggled with this off and on, but nothing has ever really worked and I’ve constantly moved from routine to chaos, then back to routine.   
That is, until recently.   
This past month, I’ve started using a new planning system designed by Alex Charfen. It’s designed to:

1. Help me focus on what’s most important  
2. Help me resolve any issues slowing me down  
3. Help me focus on the places where I’m winning  
4. Remind me to be grateful for all of the good things that happen to me on a daily basis

Your focus determines your direction. Not only that, whatever you focus on is what you’ll see more of.   
For example, when most of us reach the end of the day with a conventional “to do” list, we’re more aware of the places where we failed or the things we didn’t get done than we are of the things we accomplished and how we moved forward.  
Once I started using Charfen’s system, I found myself being more proactive not only in how I spent my day, but also in solving small issues before they became big ones.  
I usually hate affiliate products. They’re cheap, salesy, and presented as the “cure-all for everyone.” However, I signed up as an affiliate for this for one reason: It’s a planning system that actually works for entrepreneurs.   
This is not necessarily for everyone.  
This system is specifically for visionary entrepreneurs who have tried and failed at conventional planning systems but are still willing to actually give this program a go.

# Email \#020 \- 08/19/2016 \- 4 Tips to Thinking Outside the Box

Title:

* **4 Tips to Thinking Outside the Box**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Last week I gave the illustration of a ten-year-old cutting down a tree in the forest. I stressed the importance of challenging underlying assumptions and thinking outside the box. This week, I’m going to share how we as a team break out of assumptions to find the best approach.  
Whether you’re working by yourself or with your team, I believe these will be helpful to you as well.  
Tip \#1: Find the real problem you’re trying to solve  
Most times, the problem we focus on is only a surface problem. When you dig further, you find that you’re actually trying to solve a much deeper problem. Regarding last week’s example of cutting down a tree, you might ask yourself a series of questions:   
Do I need to sharpen my axe?

* Do I have the skills and resources I need to solve this problem?  
* Am I in the right environment to work through this problem?

Do I need a chainsaw instead of an axe?

* Could other software help me solve this problem?  
* Could I hire someone to do this for me?

Does this tree even need to be chopped down?

* Rather than find a better tool, should we let this customer go?  
* Is this a problem that deserves to be solved?  
* Should we consider discontinuing a product or service that doesn’t line up with our focus?

Tip \#2: Find the real outcome you’re after  
Taking the third question further, decide what outcome you really want in the end.  
For example, why do you need to chop down that tree? Do you want to make a clearing for a house? Do you need firewood? Are you hoping to build a boat?  
Continue the train of thought until you come to the real reason.   
If you need to cut down a tree in order to have wood to build a boat, ask yourself why do you need a wooden boat. Why not use fiberglass? Why do you need a boat at all? Do you need to transport something across water? Can you use an airplane? Can you build a bridge? Are there any routes around the water that would take more time, but save resources?  
Do you catch where I’m going with this?  
With each assumption (i.e. “I need to cut down this tree...”) there’s an underlying reason (i.e. “...because I need a boat”). Keep digging until you find the real reason and....  
Tip \#3: Explore alternatives  
The deeper you dig for the real reason, the more broadly you can explore alternatives.  
If you need to get from point A to point B...  
Could you fly an airplane instead of building a boat? If airplanes are too expensive, could you build a bridge? If you can’t fly an airplane or build bridge, would it be better to hire someone else to build a boat so you can focus on what really lines up with your vision?  
Tip \#4: Start now  
What are the decisions you are facing right now? Do you know the Fundamental Assumptions behind them? Take time to discover the assumptions you’ve already made and the underlying reasons behind them.   
This will enable you to make the best decisions, find the best routes forward, and make the best use of your time.  
And when you are making the best decisions and following the best routes, you can…  
Be the best you\!

\--------- \-------- \--------  
Several concerns about this article:

* *It’s a bit long, and while the hike example is great, it’s different from the other examples that you mention, which makes it feel like we’re disconnected because of that. That example could almost be a challenge as a final email in the series, challenging them to look for places in their business where they need to step back...thoughts??*

You would then start it out like, “Last week I shared the story of … cutting down a tree in the forest. This week, I’m going to share how we as a team break out of assumptions to find the best approach.  
Thoughts??  
Fundamental assumptions  
New idea--can you train people how to question fundamental assumptions? i.e. easy for me, hard to Will  
Other things you could explore??

* What are questions you can ask to help break free from fundamental assumptions?  
* What are other examples you could include?  
* What are ways we can identify whether assumptions are getting the better of us?  
* Any other practical tools to apply this?

Will referenced the book “Six Thinking Hats”, so it’s up to you to take a look at that.  
Thoughts:

1. Talk about HIKE and how we tried to teach the guys to think outside the box to solve problems.  
2. Bring 3 points on how to teach a team to challenge their assumptions  
3. One of the big questions is going all the way back to the ultimate OUTCOME that you’re after--are you just wanting to cut down a tree, or what’s it for? To make a clearing for a house, build a boat, make a fire, or…?  
4. Intentionally exploring alternatives \-- if we didn’t have X and we had to do Y, how might we accomplish it? It’s not necessarily about finding a workable alternative, but finding ways to think outside of your current way of thinking, that opens you up to new ideas.  
5. Your ability to think outside the box comes down to how well you’re able to get down to the very root of the issue and the problem that you’re trying to solve.  
6. When an issue arises: Stop, Think, and Question  
   1. Is my axe sharp? (e.g. “Could other software help me solve this?” “Am I in the right environment to think and work through this problem?” “Perhaps charcoal-grilled pizza would satisfy my customers or set me apart better than wood-grilled...” etc)  
   2. Can I use a chainsaw? (e.g. “Could I hire someone to do this for me?” “  
   3. Is this a tree that needs to be chopped? (e.g. “Can we let this customer go?” “Is this a product/service that lines up with our focus, or should we discontinue it?”

Tree for boat to transport. Could we use plane? Is what I’m bringing already there?  
Maybe we can’t afford flying it in, but it gets us thinking about pack mules, etc.

# Email \#033 \- 11/22/2016 \- How to Fight Unhealthy Competition

Title:

* How to Fight Unhealthy Competition  
* Good and Bad Competition  
* Good vs Bad Competition  
* When Competition Turns Toxic

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
A couple of weeks ago I wrote about healthy and unhealthy competition.  
When people’s worth is measured by performance, healthy competition is smothered. But when worth and performance are disconnected, healthy competition thrives and camaraderie goes up.  
If someone extracts their worth from their ability to win, competition becomes very nasty and unattractive.  
So what do we do when we find ourselves in such an environment?  
We can do two things to fight an unhealthy competitive environment.  
First, we can step back and evaluate our own mindset.  
Are we linking our self-worth with our performance? When we “lose” or “fail,” do we see ourselves as less valuable or do we see an opportunity to learn and grow?  
Second, we can nurture a healthy environment around ourselves.  
Let the people around you know you value them no matter how well they perform. For example, you could bring encouraging notes or gifts for your coworkers (or friends or family) to remind them they have value whether they win or not.  
Third, we can remember some people thrive on competition while others don’t.  
We should make the necessary adjustments in our work systems so everyone can thrive and do their best.  
Trouble doesn’t come from competition, but from letting failure (“losing”) define us. So turn unhealthy competition upside-down and remind yourself and those around you that there’s more to life than winning.  
As always, be the best you\!

* Matthias

We should give them the how-to in doing this:  
\- Don't be tacky  
\- Don't be overt, but subtle. being overt will ruin it.  
\- Tell them by leaving encouraging notes, unrelated to their performance

* Chewing with Your Mouth Open and Why It’s Important to Live in Community

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever noticed how some people seem incapable of seeing their own flaws? They continually do things that hurt the people around them. It’s like they never stop to think how their actions affect others.  
Take, for example, people who chew with their mouth open.  
I hate listening to this.   
Whatever that slurping and chomping noise coming from your mouth is, please make it stop\!  
These people have eaten food every day for their entire life yet they still insist on chewing with their mouths open\!  
Of course, this could be for several reason:

1. Perhaps they don’t realize it’s impolite and gross. Perhaps their parents never bothered to explain it to them or just didn’t care.  
2. Perhaps they simply don’t know they do it. No one ever told them and they haven’t checked.  
3. Or maybe, they just can’t help it. Some people can’t help but chew with their mouths open simply because of they way their mouths are shaped.

What does this have to do with business?  
We all have negative traits that go beyond common place irritations (like chewing with your mouth open). We have habits and behaviors not altogether healthy. Sometimes we can see them on our own, but many times we can’t and we need others to help us.  
We call these “blind spots.”  
Some people (like me) get so excited about a vision they tend to forget about the details involved in actually pursuing that vision. It is especially bad when we run over people who are more detail oriented. The flip side is that detailed people can sometimes squelch the big ideas of visionaries.  
Neither one is intrinsically bad. In fact, they are both good and necessary to balance each other out on a team. If the visionary isn’t able to see, on his own, how he runs over people, he needs others in his life who will show him.  
This is how we grow, learn, and excel. And it’s one reason why it is so important to work and live in community. We need other people in our lives to help us grow past our blind spots.  
Here’s a challenge to move you past your blind spots:  
Take a close friend, coworker, or a family member out for coffee. Ask them to say one thing they appreciate about you (to soften the blow) and one thing that irritates them about you.   
You might be surprised by both answers\!  
In any case, you’ll learn and grow and be able to...  
Be the best you\!

Title:

* Is Competition Really the Problem?  
* Is It Bad to Be Competitive?  
* **Is Competition Bad?**

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever been around people who take competition too seriously?  
It seems like there’s always that one jock who turns your casual back-yard Thanksgiving football into the Super Bowl.  
“Chill, bro, it’s just a game\!” you shoot back.  
Or maybe you’ve felt the heat at work. Perhaps you feel as if your job is a rat-race to the top with employee against employee vying for approval from the boss.  
Does it feel like people resent you for doing well? Whether it’s workplace success or ordinary good deeds, people give you sideways glances for being the “teacher's pet” or “goody-two-shoes.”  
Unfortunately, because of our bad experiences, we falsely conclude that “Competition is not good\!” We don’t want to make our coworkers jealous, so we quit trying as hard to please the boss. Or we hate being the “goody-two-shoes” at church, so we avoid letting people know about the homeless man we took in for month.   
Competition can be a good and playful motivator to build camaraderie and get things done. But when “winning” becomes a personal evaluation, it gives room to unhealthy competition. In such an environment, people’s feelings will get hurt if you outperform them because they feel their worth has been devalued.  
Unhealthy competition develops when people start linking their value to their performance.   
Next time you’re tempted to say “My workplace is too competitive\!” make sure neither you nor others have attached worth to performance.  
Don’t strive to prove your value, strive to help others.When that’s your focus,, whether you’ve “won” or “lost” you’re a success.  
And never forget…  
To be the best you\!

* Matthias

# 7\. Competition

Healthy Competition cannot exist in an environment where worth is measured in performance. Because to beat you is personal. People's feelings might get hurt if you outperform. And if you beat them, they might believe they are less than you.   
This affects teams, business owners, entrepreneurs, etc.  
The more you have at stake personally, the more likely you’re going to enter a “fight or flight”, do or die, kind of state. And that actually works AGAINST you.

Tom spent his nights and weekends hunched over his workbench. All he needed as a working prototype. With that, he would change the world forever. But for now, Tom spent hours every day meticulously filing one worthless patent after another.  
He was a nameless failure.  
Perhaps you feel the same way: spending your nights and weekends trying to pull the pieces together, spending your day in meaningless busywork, and living on the hope that some day, you will find your answer.  
Don’t lose heart, though\! Tom, the Nameless Failure did eventually find success. It took two years of relentless research and thousands of failures, but he did it.  
Tom, the Nameless Failure, is better known by his full name: Thomas A. Edison.  
Thomas Edison is no different than you.  
   
Like Tom, you strive for excellence, doing everything to the best of your ability.  
Like Tom, your best still falls short, no matter how hard you try. No matter how carefully you project your plans, something still blindsides you. Sometimes the things you care most about are the things you seem to fail most miserably at.  
But there's a conclusion you must refuse to make from this:  
Refuse to believe your failure reflects your value, or that your history determines your future. Reject the lie that you are less of a person with less potential because you failed.  
By refusing to believe these lies, you dodge the punch that knocks most people out. Failure isn’t an obstacle in your path. Rather, it propels you forward.  
When you become certain of your own value as an individual, apart from achievements or failures, you are free to fail. Rather than needing to taste the bitterness of defeat, you can get back up again and keep moving.  
So live out of your worth, keep failing forward, and be the best you\!

* “Finishing What You Start” and Why It’s not a Sign of Maturity  
* The Bondage of “Finishing What You Start”

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Do you ever struggle to follow through on projects?   
Many of us do. I certainly am no exception.  
For example, I have a quickstart personality with low follow-through. This means I’m a visionary. I have many “great” ideas that I usually just act on and figure out as I go. Who has time for research?  
However, because of this, I will often end up letting go of many ideas in the process because I discover they are not worth finishing.  
Thus, I have many “unfinished projects.” Things I started moons ago and still haven’t finished.  
Unfortunately, I’ve often scolded myself for not following through. I feel like I am somehow less mature than other leaders because I have all these unfinished projects.  
Our culture lives under the mentality that mature, disciplined people finish what they start. Whether it’s a sale, a project, or simply reading a book, great leaders follow through.  
This sounds right, doesn’t it?  
While self-discipline certainly marks good character, following-through does not necessarily mark self-discipline.  
The “Quickstart” and “Follow Through” traits are related to personality, not character. They reflect different learning and executing patterns, not self-control. They each bring to the table both positive and negative propensities, but are not of themselves reflective of character.  
So next time you didn’t follow through on a project or finish a book, instead of beating yourself up for not being more disciplined, ask yourself “Will finishing this project benefit my company? By not finishing it, will I hurt anyone?”  
If the answer is “Yes,” definitely finish the project\! But if it is “No,” why continue wasting your precious time and energy trying to finish that project, book, or whatever it may be just for the sake of “finishing what you start”?  
Let it go guilt-free.  
And as always...  
Be the Best You\!

* Confessions from History Class

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
I have a confession to make. This probably won’t make me sound intellectual. In fact, it may make me sound a little ignorant, but...  
I hated history in school.  
I hated dates. I hated needing to learn so many names, places, wars, and events. None of it made much sense. I despised the rote memorization it took to learn it all.  
I’ve realized, lately, why history was so hard for me: I never understood why I had to learn it, why it was important. It was just a class full of useless facts.  
You see, I learn through patterns and ideas, through making connections and discovering reasons--not by memorizing a list of facts. If I want to remember something, I have to have reason to remember it. I have to know the “why” behind that name or war.  
For example, if my wife tells me where to find something in the kitchen, I will invariably forget it unless I have a mental “reason” why it’s there.   
“The paprika is in such-and-such cupboard because that’s where all the spices are. The spices are in that cupboard because it’s a convenient spot when you’re making food.”  
In history class, my teacher taught me facts alone, disjointed from the reasons, motives, and principles behind them. Naturally, I had a difficult time fitting it all into my context of learning. Whenever I was forced to simply memorize information without a “bucket” to put it into, I almost always failed.  
For example, did you know President Jefferson was able to acquire the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 at a low price because the French dictator, Napoleon Bonaparte, desperately needed money to finance his wars against the British, fought from 1803 to 1815?  
Often, these facts are presented through American history and European history separately. But when presented as a story, they stick much better in your memory because you understand the reasons and motives behind the facts.  
Because I didn't receive this, I often felt out-of-place and incompetent in history class. However, I didn’t realize these weaknesses were the flip-side of my strengths:

1. While I struggle to memorize facts, I often hunt out the principles and reason behind them.  
2. While I struggle to understand the past, I’m always thinking about future.

I’ve spent years cultivating this ability to make connections, see patterns, and hunt down real reasons. I’ve found that whether it is history, business, or interpersonal relations, many people will simply give you facts. Few people will give you the why behind it all.   
By learning patterns and principles, you can learn how to make effective decisions much more easily. This is high-leverage decision-making.  
Many of us spend too much time beating ourselves up for our natural weaknesses, rather than looking for ways to capitalize our inborn genius.  
So what about you? What are the natural weaknesses you’ve obsessed over? More importantly, what are the natural strengths? How can you partner with others to shore up your natural weaknesses?  
Shoot me an email, I’d love to know\!  
In the meantime, always…  
Be the best you\!

* Matthias

Learning \- Facts vs Principles  
I realized lately that I learn based on patterns, ideas, connections and reasons.  
My history teacher was teaching me based on facts, and I had a difficult time fitting that into my context of learning. Whenever I was forced to memorize information and I didn’t have a “bucket” to put it into, I almost always failed.  
If my wife tells me where to find something, I will usually forget unless I have a mental “reason” why it’s there.  
Many people will teach you facts, but few people will teach you reasons. Teaching the principles/reasons/connections will teach you HOW to think and how to problem solve.  
When you start to see PATTERNS, you can learn how to more effectively make decisions much more easily. This is high-leverage decision-making.

# Email \#028 \- 10/24/2016 \- Are You a Voice or an Echo? 

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever gone “caving”?   
I’m told it’s pretty fun--as long as you don’t mind crawling into the earth through a small hole and navigating around tight spaces.  
Usually, the cave eventually opens up into a large chamber where you experience one of the most distinct features of a cave: The Echo.  
We’re pretty familiar with the echo, whether in caves, canyons, or cathedrals. Of course, with every echo you need something to provide sound: The Voice.  
When it comes to business and leadership, there are a lot of echoes bouncing around out there. People constantly mimic and duplicate what has already been spoken or done.  
Echoes are not original. They don’t pioneer new borders or develop new strategies. They’re always one step behind the voice.  
The people who really bring about progress are the voices, the ones saying new things then echoed by a hundred different people.  
Many parrot famous teachers and influencers, but few actually take established ideas, make them their own, and continue to build on them. If you do, you are a voice, an originator.  
As we discover the perspectives and talents unique to us, we become the fresh voice for solutions to the problems facing our community, industry, or team. We push the boundaries a little farther in places they’ve never been pushed before.  
We progress forward.  
If we would each grab ahold of the best ideas, combine them to make new ideas, and express them through the giftings uniquely given to each of us, we could together push the world forward.  
This is how you can uniquely...  
Be the best you\!

Voice or Echo  
I once had someone tell me that I would mature into become a voice, not just an echo. I didn’t understand what they meant. Since then, I’ve come to realize that as we discover the things that are unique to us, we start sharing that message. Many people can parrot a famous teacher, but few people can take ownership of ideas, enhance them, and make them their own. But if you do, you can become a voice, not just an echo.

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Can you believe winter is just around the corner? If they haven’t done it already, many people are scrambling around chopping and hauling loads of firewood to fuel their furnaces so they stay warm all season long.  
Thank God, I don’t depend on a wood furnace to stay warm because I’d have no way to haul it all to my house. VW Jettas aren't exactly ideal for transporting large loads of firewood.  
However, if I invested in a brand new F-150, I’d be able to haul firewood no problem.  
What’s the difference?  
My Jetta wasn’t designed for that kind of work. The F-150 was.  
If you want to get the most use out of a tool, you have to use it how it was designed to be used. While you can load a small stack of wood in the back of my Jetta, you’ll have better results loading them into a big truck like the F-150.   
The actual design of the vehicle dictates what it does best.  
If you’re stuck with a problem (i.e. hauling wood), the best question is not “How do I get more wood in my car?” but “How can I redesign my car to carry wood?”   
That’s when you end up with a truck.  
Sometimes we do the same thing with ourselves.   
We put a “load of wood” in our “trunk” and then berate ourselves for not getting anywhere in life.   
In reality, we just need to learn to function according to our design. When we learn to do this, we get the greatest leverage for our efforts.  
Yes, we can operate outside our design and get things done for awhile, but our effectiveness is limited.  
We’ll always have the ability to improvise outside of our giftings in a pinch just like I could use my Jetta to haul wood--in a pinch. We can even get good at “packing the trunk” to its max efficiency, but the best way to get things done will always be to focus on operating the way we were designed.  
For example, someone might be especially skilled at relating with people one-on-one. Does that mean they can’t learn how to communicate and move large audiences of people? No. Of course they can learn how to do that--and even be successful at it. But their “sweet-spot,” their forte where they wield the most influence, will be one-on-one.  
So how were you “designed?” What jobs and talents do you especially excel at and enjoy? What are some ways you could rearrange your life to best function efficiently?  
I’d love to know the areas where you can...  
Be the best you?

* The marvel of the iPhone is in its design. You cannot take any device and dramatically simplify it without fundamentally reworking its design. How something is designed is one of the greatest drivers of a) how well it works, and b) how simple it is.  
* The way to get the most use out of a tool, is to use it how it was designed. While you can load a stack of wood in the back of your car, you’re going to have better results loading them into a truck. The actual DESIGN of the vehicle dictates what it does best.  
* If you’re stuck with a problem (hauling wood), sometimes the best question is not, how do i get more wood in my car, but “how can I redesign my car to carry wood?” And that’s when you end up with a truck.  
  1. Sometimes we do the same thing with ourselves. We put a load of wood in our trunk, and we can’t figure out why we can’t get anywhere in life. We need to learn to function according to our DESIGN, and when we learn to do that, that’s where get the greatest leverage for our efforts.  
* When we operate outside of our design, yes we can do it for a while, but we greatly limit our effectiveness, and we set an example for others to do it.

# Email \#013 \- 06/03/2016 \- Building a Business that Lasts

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
I have a question for you:  
How big is your business? Is it a living, growing organism capable of surviving without you? Or, if you were taken out of the picture, would it fall flat and die?  
Most people go into business asking, “What can I do to make money?”   
Of course, this always makes them the king of the game and when they are taken out, the game is over.  
A tradesman, for example, who sets out to sell his own service, naturally builds a business around his skillset. This means the business only makes money when he shows up.   
Unfortunately, leaders who run their businesses like this tend to micromanage their team because, in their minds, they are the experts.  
If you’re interested in creating an organization that outlasts and outgrows yourself, ask the question, “What can anyone else do to make money? And how can we utilize it to make a business much bigger than any one of us?”  
It is difficult to get out of the “do it all yourself” mode because we fear that if we stop, everything will come to a grinding halt.”   
The fact is, most of us overestimate our level of skill while underestimating others’ ability to do what we do.  
By allowing those under you to take the initiative and think creatively, you cultivate an environment of contribution within your business, producing something much bigger and more capable of surviving the “elements” of economics than if you did it all yourself.  
As you allow your employees to grow and create, your business thrives and you can focus your personal time and energy on the things important to you.   
And thus, you will be the best you.

* Matthias

Leadership  
If you start by doing it all, you will have to transition to another role as a leader. This is a fundamentally different role.  
When most people go into business, their first thought is the question, “What can I do to make money?” This always puts them in the center of the chessboard. If you’re interested in creating an organization that outlasts and outgrows you, you have to ask the question, “What can anyone else do to make money?”  
Common example is tradesmen, skilled workers, etc who want to go on their own to sell their services. They naturally build a business around what THEY are capable of doing. This means that they build a business that only makes money when they show up, and it means that they are much more likely to micromanage their team because (in their minds) they are the experts.  
One of the reasons it’s so difficult to get out of this mode (where you do it all yourself) is because this brings with it a mindset/fear that if I stop doing what I’m doing, everything will come to a grinding halt. Also, most of us overestimate our level of skill, and underestimate other people’s ability to do what we can do.

* Your Focus Is Charging You Rent

* A House Divided

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
“A house divided against itself cannot stand.”  
We’ve all heard this quote. We all agree it makes sense. Whether civil war or fractured management, division will always weaken a nation or an organization.  
This is never truer than when it comes to the focus of your business.  
Many of us think our focus is unlimited. We think we can give our attention to multiple pursuits and goals while still getting positive results.  
But stop and think about the real, physical focus of your eyes for a second. The notion that you could possibly “split” your focus in multiple directions is foolish. It is impossible for your eyes to focus on two places at one time, let alone three or four places\!  
The best we can do with our eyes is shift focus quickly between two different locations. But constantly switching your focus back-and-forth handicaps you from moving toward either location.  
The same is true in business.  
We’d like to think splitting our focus 50/50 between two projects will simply take twice as long, with no time lost in the end. However, in actuality, it will likely take 3 times as long or longer. The more you split your focus, the less valuable your focus becomes.  
In order to get great results you must maintain an almost obsessive focus.  
This is because focus has a compounded effect, giving it exponential power. The more you’re focused on something, the more likely you are to notice other side effects which spring from it.  
Further, I would argue that focus is more important than time. The value of your time is entirely contingent on how you spend your time. If you spend an hour working on a project which in the long run does not push you further toward completing the ultimate goal of your business, you’ve wasted that hour.  
The question I ask more than anything is not, “Do I have the time for this?” but “Do I have the focus for this?”  
Mental space is a limited resource. Don’t give it anything which won’t deliver. Any projects, activities, or thought processes you give your focus to, should pay their rent in order to take up your mental space. The more you want to grow, the more you will find yourself obsessing about what things you allow to occupy that space.  
By only allowing the ideas and projects which will propel you to your goal to take up space in your mind and focus, you can do your best work.  
This obsessive focus will bring your best results.  
And as always, be the best you\!

* Matthias

Matt’s Original Memo  
Focus \--- Proposed Subject has the concept of “not getting buried by distractions” or … not being reactive, interrupted by your phone, etc etc  
Singular focus always beats multiplied effort.  
A divided focus is very expensive.  
We all have limited resources, and many of us think that our FOCUS is an unlimited focus, allowing us to spread it across multiple things while still getting positive results.  
However, focus has an exponential power to it. Splitting your focus 50/50 between two projects does NOT mean that the projects will take twice as long. More likely, it will mean it will take 3x as long. The more you split your focus, the less valuable your focus becomes.  
Getting great results and outcomes often comes from an almost-obsessive focus, because it’s through that focus that you get dynamic results.  
Also, focus has a compounded effect, because when you’re focused on something, the more likely you are to notice other things on the side that will benefit it.  
I would actually argue that FOCUS is more important than TIME. The question I ask more than anything is not, “Do I have the TIME for this?” but “Do I have the FOCUS for this?”  
Mental space is a limited resources, and things have to pay their rent in order to be there. The more you want to grow, the more you will find yourself obsessing about what things you allow to occupy that space.

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Marj is a hard-working woman. She always has been. It’s her grit that has kept her alive this long already.  
And it’s her grit which enables her to work a fulltime job to support her kids--both under the age of six--while attempting her hand at entrepreneurship.  
Unfortunately, on top of the many obstacles she overcomes everyday, Marj has an even greater problem. She’s not a people person. This is problematic since her boss has recently asked her to take on a project that requires working with a team.  
“I just don’t do well working with people,” she vents to her friend after hours. “I work hard and I get things done--a lot more than some of the others in the company. I can’t stand it when people get in the way of me getting things done.”  
“Right,” her friend agrees. “But if you can’t get along with your coworkers, the boss is going to be understandably displeased.”  
“Well, what can I do about it?” she says. “It’s just my personality.”   
Let’s pause the story for a moment.  
Last week we talked about whether our inability to do a job or respond a certain way is always because of our personalities or if they’re really habits we’ve developed over time and could improved.  
If something is really “just your personality” then you are stuck with it and unable to change. This would obstruct the progress of any business, not to mention relationships, marriage, or mental health.  
So how can we tell when something is simply part of our personality and when it’s something we can change or improve?  
There are three questions we can ask ourselves to help us clarify the difference.  
1\. What’s the outcome?   
Before we can identify whether something is a habit or a personality trait, we need to step back and figure out what we are actually trying to accomplish. In Marj’s example, the outcome she pursues is being able to connect with people and establish a relationship so they can work together.   
Therefore, she needs to be a “people person.”  
2\. What are my expected behaviors?   
The trouble, however, begins with Marj’s perception of a “people person.” She assumes a “people person” is someone who talks with everyone in the room and is the life of the party. She assumes a “people person” magically gets along with everyone, never gets frustrated with other people, and never faces relational conflict. She also assumes being a “people person” requires her to spend hours sitting with them in their living room, chatting about their life.  
In our story, Marj is frustrated with herself because she’s attempting to become a “people person” according to her stereotype. She ends up modeling behaviors unnatural for her.  
But are these stereotypes true? Could the woman who enjoys talking to one or two friends at a party be just as much of a “people person” as someone who talks with everybody?   
Is Marj’s driven personality really what hinders her from working well with others?   
Her personality is not the problem. Rather, the problem is her assumption of how a “people person” behaves.  
3\. What are my natural behaviors?   
Once you identify your natural behaviors, you can tell the problem is really in your expectations about your behaviors. It’s not a problem with your outcome.   
Being relational with a few people is being a people person. Taking a few moments to connect deeply with another person, then moving along to another task, is being a “people person.” While the amount of time does matter for some people, the quality of time and Marj’s level of presence has a greater impact on the outcome. Being present and actively listening is key to connecting with other people.  
Let’s explore a few examples.

* You might struggle with feelings of rejection when you relate with others and conclude you’re not a “people person.” The outcome you want is to be able to freely relate with others, without taking it personally when others don’t want to relate with you. You want to be free to negotiate relationships with others. Likely you taught yourself to say “I’m not likable” when people choose not to spend time with you. This is not a matter of your personality. It’s a matter of having a wrong belief about your relationships.

* You might assume you’re not a “people person” because you’re introverted. Again, this is a false assumption. Introverts aren’t energized by being around lots of people. However, they are often exceptionally skilled at building deep, lasting relationships.  
* If you want to jog every morning and struggle waking up, you might conclude you’re not a morning person. The outcome you want is to be able to exercise every morning. Rather than conclude you’re not a morning person, you might actually be motivated by having someone to do it with you. Thus, you might choose to find a friend who is willing to jog along.

* You might assume that because you’re not outgoing, you’re not a “salesperson.” In reality, however, the outcome of a salesperson is simple: “making a sale.” While you might not be the outgoing, extroverted salesperson, you might discover other, more natural ways for you to achieve the outcome: making the sale.

Clearly understanding the difference between the outcome, your expected behaviors, and your natural behaviors will help you understand the difference between your personality and your learned behaviors.  
This doesn’t mean working against the grain. It means re-evaluating what you’re truly after, and finding a way you can reach that objective while being true to who you were ultimately created to be.  
When you finally use your innate strength to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you will truly be able to…  
Be the best you\!

NOTES:  
A friend and Matt were praying. Standing in hallway praying, someone came through. Said hi but clearly didn’t want to impose or interrupt.  
Conflicting needs: 1\. I have a deadline, 2\. I don’t want to impose myself, need for privacy, 3\. We’re not here to be a clique  
Can you separate the outcome   
Are there people who’ve changed from not-go getter to being a go-getter. Are there people who have succeeded at being a salesperson while still being shy?  
NOTES:

1. Am I confusing the behaviors (“talking with everyone in the room”) with the outcome (“being a people person”)?  
2. Have other people changed their behaviors to become a “people person” while being completely themselves?  
3. Can I learn new behaviors from those people that let me be a “people person” while being completely myself?

Have you ever had someone tell you they can’t do something because of their personality?  
Perhaps they say “I’m not naturally talented at sports,” as the reason they won’t play tennis with you.  
Some might claim “I’m not a people person,” to explain why they can’t get along with people or why they don’t go to parties. Others say “I’m not a ‘go-getter,’” to explain why they’re slow to tackle a project.  
Sometimes this bleeds into our businesses as well. We can give an endless number of reasons to excuse ourselves from doing our job.

* *“I’m too shy to be a salesman. I don’t have the personality for it.”*  
* *“I’m a driven person. I don’t have the personality to care for people.”*  
* *“I’m a pessimist, it’s hard for me to look on the bright side.”*

Sometimes we waste away precious time explaining our undesirable outcomes as a matter of “personality”--time we could spend developing the necessary talents for better outcomes.   
It’s true, we will never excel at certain roles because they don’t align with our God-given giftings and inclinations. However, most times it’s simply a matter of making small changes in our habits to bring about better results.  
The question is no longer, “Does this fit my personality?” but instead, “How can I get the right outcomes by changing my behaviors while harnessing my natural strengths?”   
For example, are you really naturally incapable of playing tennis or are you simply disinterested? Are you really incapable of looking on the bright side or have you merely trained your mind to draw attention to the negative?  
Many of the things we blame on our personality are really habits we’ve formed over a lifetime of practice. They could be traits we developed on our own or traits our parents subconsciously taught us through example--either way, they are not embedded in our DNA.  
Next week, I’ll share some tips on how to discern between personality traits and learned habits.  
Until then, keep asking yourself, “Am I doing (or not doing) this from my God-given personality or am I merely using it as an excuse?”  
And as you chip away at negative habits and form better ones, you will increasingly…

Personality vs. Learned Traits  
Most of us spend WAY too much time explaining our undesirable outcomes as a matter of “personality”, not recognizing that much of the time, there are small things we could do that would change the outcomes, such as:

* I don’t have a personality for sales.  
* I don’t have a personality to care for people.  
* I don’t have a personality to get things done.  
* I don’t have a personality to look on the bright side.  
* More ideas??

Or, “I’m not naturally talented at sports.” … which is often just a reason that we give ourselves for our poor outcomes, or our lack of interest or even commitment.   
At the end, these all become limiting ideas.

* Healthy Delegation  
* Not All Delegation Is Created Equal  
* Not All Delegation Is Equal  
* Good Leaders Delegate  
* Good Leaders Delegate Well

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Most leaders know they need to delegate. Unfortunately, many leaders have been burned by delegation because their employees neglect their tasks or are unable to fulfill them. This brings the responsibility back on leader who has to pick up the slack. And this robs him of precious time he doesn’t have.  
If this is you, perhaps it’s because you’ve been delegating wrong.  
There are two styles of delegation: Task-based delegation and Outcome-based delegation.  
Task-based delegation expects the employee to fulfill a check-list of tasks. Rather than communicating clearly what outcome he wants, the boss simply says, “Please go do tasks A, B and C. I’m here to tell you what to do.”  
Because the employee doesn’t know the desired outcome they can’t troubleshoot solutions around any problems they encounter. Thus, they have to go back to the leader who will then come up with a solution and give further instructions.   
This treats people like little machines. It’s prone to burning not only the leader out, but the follower as well.   
Task-based delegation inhibits creativity and initiative, which completely smothers potential for explosive growth.  
There is a better alternative to task-based delegation.  
Outcome-based delegation places ownership for the outcome on the individual employee. Rather than saying “Go do A, B, and C,” the boss says “These are the results we’re looking for. You have the freedom to find whatever path serves you and the business best. I’m here to help wherever you need it.”  
Sharing responsibility in a healthy way encourages your team members to take ownership. This encourages creativity and initiative among followers and frees leaders to focus on the tasks only they can do.  
This is when explosive growth happens.  
Do you find it hard to delegate? Have you ever been burned by delegation? When has delegating been especially freeing for you as a leader?  
Tell me about it in an email\!  
And as always...  
Be the Best You\!

* Matthias

Delegation is not merely handing off your “to do” list to somebody else

* Solution:  
  1. The most primitive rule of delegation is clear communication of expectations  
  2. There are two kinds of delegation:  
     1. Task-based delegation \-- Go run this errand, take this to the post office. This ends up treating people like little machines, and is more prone to burning them out.  
     2. Outcome-based delegation \-- where people are responsible for and vested in an outcome (such as overseeing/streamlining office work), which always directly ties back to moving the business forward  
  3. The difference is NOT that the person doesn’t go to the post office. The difference is that it’s based on the person’s own initiative, and it’s tied directly to the outcome.  
     1. Task-based delegation \-- The boss might say, “please go to the post office and get stamps to mail off these letters”  
     2. Outcome-based delegation \-- letters need to be mailed. The person may choose to stop by the corner store (which is closer) to buy stamps and drop them in a dropbox. OR, they might choose to always have extra stamps on hand, so they can consistently spare themselves the trip to the post office….or they might question the “how” even further, and start emailing certain things instead of snail-mailing them and follow-up with a text to let the person know, etc  
  4. Another way to say it:  
     1. Task-based delegation says, “Please go do tasks A, B and C. I’m here to tell you what to do.”  
     2. Outcome-based delegation says, “These are the result that we’re looking for. You have the freedom to find a path that serves you and the business the best. I’m here to offer help wherever you need it.”  
  5. Outcome-based delegation does NOT work with “tell me how to do it” people, so you have to find people who are able to think on their own and are willing to question how they’re doing it.  
* Further, sharing responsibility in a healthy way encourages your team members to take more ownership, not less.

Original opening:  
Sadly, many leaders are so busy, they lack time or energy to move their organization forward. Usually, this because they don’t delegate.  
It is understandable that leaders would struggle to delegate because they likely know exactly how they want things to be done. In their minds it is easier to do it themselves. This fills their time with odds and ends other people could just as easily do.   
Leaders should focus their time and energy on what only they can do, and delegate the rest.  
Unfortunately, many leaders simply hand off their “to do” list to somebody else, without communicating clearly what outcome they want. This is not good delegation.  
In fact, there are two styles of delegation. One is task-based and the other is outcome-based.

# Email \#023 \- 09/14/2016 \- 5-Star Leadership

Title:

* How Great Leaders Truly Lead … or maybe some reference to the prior email’s subject somehow?  
* The Difference Between a Shepherd and a Gardener Leader  
* Lead Like a Gardener  
* Garden Leadership  
* Nurturing Healthy Business Ecosystems

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have you ever worked under a leader who not only demanded certain outcomes, but required a particular game plan to achieve them, as well?  
It wasn’t just a matter of getting the right result. You had to do it the right way, too. Thus, they micromanaged everything you did.  
These are the tell-tale traits of poor leadership.  
When it comes to pursuing results, there are generally two types of leaders: Shepherds and Gardeners.  
We want to be like Gardeners in our leadership, not Shepherds.  
Here’s the difference:

* *Shepherds have to prod and guide their sheep every step of the way. Gardeners cultivate the soil and surroundings so their plants have a healthy ecosystem in which to grow on their own.*  
* *Shepherding requires the leader to drive things forward. Gardening merely requires steady care so the plant can bear fruit on its own.*  
* *Shepherds lead through hierarchy, but Gardeners lead through nurturing healthy environments.*  
* *Shepherds focus on assigning tasks and getting them done. Gardeners focus on growing people who deliver successful outcomes.*  
* *Within a Shepherding environment, failure means delay, thus failure is reproachful and feared. Within a Gardening environment, failure becomes an opportunity to learn and thus contributes to ultimate success.*  
* *Within a Shepherding environment, the leader takes the initiative. Any creative followers are threatening and considered out of line. Within a Gardening environment, individual or communal initiative is encouraged.*  
* *Shepherd leaders are the top of command, any disagreement is punished. Whereas Garden leaders encourage and even invite disagreement in order to arrive at the best decision.*  
* *Shepherds move dumb sheep from place to place. Gardeners want their followers to think for themselves. They value each one’s perspective.*

To be perfectly clear, being a Gardener does not mean abdicating responsibility for the outcomes. It means finding a better, more effective way to lead.  
Wealth and success result not merely from achieving tasks. They come from creating healthy and thriving ecosystems in which people can try, fail, learn, and grow. This changes the definition of leadership from prodding to nurturing.  
If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on the cultural changes you need to make to get the right results.  
This will free up your employees and your company, allowing all of you to get your best work done. And when you are getting your best work done, you are able to...  
Be the Best You\!

* Matthias

Ecosystems (this could be a 2-part series)  
Wealth and success is about creating ecosystems that are healthy and that thrive. This changes the definition of leadership.  
The Shepherd

* Think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things  
* Requires you to drive things forward  
* Puts you in the hub of the wheel and everything circles around you  
* Herds sheep/moves people to get to a certain place  
* Focused on assigning tasks and getting them done

The Gardener

* Focuses leadership on creating a culture where things get done  
* Allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.  
* Focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own  
* Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results  
* What makes a healthy environment?  
* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself  
* When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a byproduct of that.

If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
All of us face days--perhaps even months or years--where we must fight for hope.  
I have a question for you:  
How bad would your situation get before you completely gave up?  
If you felt stuck, with no way out, how soon would you just give up and die?  
Well, that’s exactly what Dr. Curt P. Richter wanted to find out through an experiment he did back in the fifties.   
His subject? Rats.  
Richter did a series of experiments on testing how long rats would swim in jars full of water with no way of escape. He found that wild rats after realizing there’s no way out died within 15 minutes of being placed in the water.  
Now, humans are much more complex than rats. But I think we've all had the feeling that we’re swimming in circles with no path of escape--and it’s tough to keep going.  
However, Richter also found that if he removed the “hopelessness” of the situation, the rats survived much longer. He did this repeatedly by holding the rats and putting them back in, thus giving the rats hope that there was an escape.  
Richter noted that “after the elimination of hopelessness, the rats do not die.” In fact, many of them could swim for days\!  
I posit my question to you again: What level of “hopelessness” can you withstand?  
What level of failure would it take to derail you?  
You see, hope was the only difference between the rats that died and the rats that survived and swam for days. Though they possessed the same strength and vitality, the rats without hope quickly gave up and died.  
In life, we don’t always get to feel those “hands of hope” pulling us out of the water, letting us know that everything will be okay if we just keep swimming. But that doesn’t mean they’re not there.  
If you feel yourself swimming in circles, waiting for that hand to lift you out of the water, keep swimming\! Don’t give up hope\! Help is coming\!  
And always...  
Be the best you\!

P.S. I’m serious about these questions. What does it take for you to begin losing hope? What have been the “hands of hope” in your life? Shoot me a reply, I’d love to hear your story\!

How level of failure does it take to derail you? Because even successful people have faced bankruptcy...a financial crisis that would be evidence to most people that they’re on a deadend road.

1\. The 10-Year-Old Lumberjack  
2\. Challenging Trees and Felling Assumptions  
3\. You’ve Got What It Takes to Chop Down that Tree  
Challenging Fundamental Assumptions  
{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Have ever watched a ten-year-old try chopping down a tree?   
Grabbing that just-slightly-too-heavy axe, they step back and give a confident swing. The axe bounces off the tree, barely even making a dent in the wood.  
“It’s okay,” we tell them. “Just wait until you put on a few more muscles. Then you’ll be able fell your first tree.”  
Similarly, it’s easy to assume we need more “muscle” to succeed in the business world--that we simply have to wait for us to “grow up”.  Many people run away from their problems because they assume they don’t have what it takes to solve them.   
“Oh, I’m not a salesman--I wouldn’t be able to sell my product.”   
“I’m not a writer; I couldn’t keep my customers engaged.”   
“I’m not organized enough to run a team.”  
They cut themselves short and stunt their potential because they’ve already assumed they can’t do it.  
But take that grubby, over-confident adolescent kid who swung a heavy axe at a tree and failed to bring it down.  
Sure, perhaps he isn’t destined to become a lumberjack, but his failure doesn’t mean he can’t fell a tree. It may just mean he needs to re-adjust his tools or develop his skills.  
Instead of assuming that he’s too weak to chop down a tree, he should take stock of the situation, asking questions to challenge his Fundamental Assumption:

1. Is the axe sharp?  
2. Is there a lighter axe to use so I can swing with all my might?  
3. Can I use a chainsaw?

Now, I’m not recommending we let ten year old boys run around the forest felling trees with chainsaws. We’ll have even greater problems if we do that\!  
Rather, I’m asking you to challenge your Fundamental Assumptions. Instead of immediately assuming you have no solution and moving on (the “I can’t swing an axe, so I’ll never be a lumberjack” mentality), approach each problem assuming that there is a solution and you just have to look for it to find it.  
Often, we feel as though some problems demand more effort than they’re worth. We choose to respond to these roadblocks by accepting them as closed doors.  
However, this is usually not the only option we have. By accepting the roadblock, we forfeit the great success that lies beyond the roadblock and stunt our potential.  
Learn to challenge your underlying Fundamental Assumptions, making that your automatic response.  
Next week, I’m going to share some tips on how to teach your team to challenge their Fundamental Assumptions in order to find a way through any road block.  
Until then...  
Be the best you\!

* Matthias

\---------  
Fundamental assumptions  
More thoughts \-- when people have difficulty achieving success, they often end up blaming themselves and saying “I’m not cut out for this”, when in reality all they need is a different toolset or more skills.   
If it takes you a long time to chop down a tree, you can either assume that you’re weak, or you can look for some techniques such as:

* Making sure your ax is sharp  
* Making sure you’re chopping WITH the grain instead of against it (more about splitting logs, not chopping down trees)

Are you just going to blame yourself and assume you can’t fix it, or will  you look for better ways to solve your problem?  
New idea--can you train people how to question fundamental assumptions? i.e. easy for me, hard to Will  
This is almost more about encouraging people to challenge their fundamental assumptions.  
For example, in a “down” economy...challenge that assumption, because there are POCKETS of the economy that are doing better.  
Or...certain kinds of people make poor employees, or certain types of people never change….  
It all starts with a fundamental belief that there actually IS a solution the problem that you’re facing, however, it just might look radically different than you thought.  
Sometimes it’s simply not worth bulldozing through a roadblock...so rather than trying to power your way through it, what if you looked for creative ways to either leverage the obstacle, fundamentally eliminate the obstacle, or fundamentally move around it?  
Of course, there’s still this reality that sometimes something demands more effort than we really thing is worth it, so we may choose to respond to roadblocks by accepting them as a closed door. However, we should recognize that this is likely not the ONLY option that we have.  
Other things you could explore??

* What are questions you can ask to help break free from fundamental assumptions?  
* What are other examples you could include?  
* What are ways we can identify whether assumptions are getting the better of us?  
* Any other practical tools to apply this?

When it comes to what drives entrepreneurs, more often than not, we lean toward two extremes:  
We’re either:

1. All about people, but can’t make money   
2. All about money, but can’t keep people

It takes a healthy tension: Without people, you can’t make money, but without money, you can’t help people.  
Let me tell you a true story about Casey, who runs a coffee shop in Los Angeles.  
He’s an easy-going businessman frequently giving discounts, coffees “on the house,” and going the extra-mile to find his customers the cheapest deal, sometimes throwing in a bag of goodies with a wink and no charge.  
On one hand, he could take this too far and give too MUCH away. He would certainly have a lot of friends and happy consumers, but not a lot of money to grow his business and make his cafe even better.   
On the other hand, he could focus on all the profits being lost through the free coffees and discounts and become stingy, not giving anything away. Perhaps he would break even, but his customer loyalty would be low and there would be little reason for customers to choose his shop over the one down the street.  
As it is, Casey deftly holds the tension by being generous while also being responsible. This creates an atmosphere and rapport with and among customers that keeps them coming back, even when the most loyal of them admit they could get tastier coffee only a few blocks away.  
The same can apply not only to customers, but employees as well.   
Casey could nurture great team-dynamics that keep employees happy and excited to work, while neglecting the financial demands or quality of product. Or he could focus on the finances and product quality, and neglect the team-dynamic that keeps employees invested in the shop.   
A healthy business takes obsessing with growing people AND with growing numbers. Through this, customers will remain loyal, employees happy, and profits up.  
So, where are you right now? Do you need to focus on building your people? Or do you need to focus on building your profits? Either way, I’d love to hear about it\!  
As you live with the tension between people and money...  
Always, be the best you\!

Matt’s Original Memo:  
Business people often lean toward two extremes.  
Either they’re:

1. All about people, but they can’t make money.  
2. All about money, but they can’t keep people.

It takes a healthy tension, because without people, you can’t make money. Without money, you can’t help people.  
It takes an obsession with growing people AND growing numbers.  
Sometimes entrepreneurs will run away from profit because they want to “be all about people”. Profits (in their truest form) are the just rewards for helping people, and the best system is always a SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM.  
Where are you right now? Do you need to focus on building your people? Or do you need to focus on building your profits?

# Email \#012 \- 2016-03-21 \- Your Treasures are Buried Under Your Bad Ideas

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Most of your ideas are going to be bad. But that’s okay.   
Here’s why:  
Brainstorming is like metal detecting. Most of what you dig up is worthless, but every now and then you find a treasure. If you refuse to dig up bad finds, you will never find exceptional ones.  
In order to unearth good ideas, you must be willing to voice the bad (no matter how embarrassing you think it is). Sure, some of your ideas will be as exceptional as mud--digging for treasure is a dirty job, after all.  
But the goal of brainstorming isn’t to find a hundred good ideas, but to find one exceptional idea that will take you far.  
Your best ideas will only be found when you’re willing to dig up any idea--no matter how bad it may turn out.   
You must dig for the gold, but when you find it, it’s worth millions more than the dirt that surrounds it. However, you won’t find it on the surface. You have to dig for it\!  
In order to find and refine the best ideas, be willing to invite feedback, criticize the idea, try it out, and maybe even fail. It’s the only way you’ll find and refine gold.  
   
Always remember, be the best you\!  
     \- Matthias  
P.S. What’s one crazy idea you’ve been kicking around? I’d love to hear it\!

# 80/20 Greatness

So many times we think we should be able to get a great answer every time, but the truth of the matter with ideas is that 20% of them will be killer. So be free to share, to be criticized, to learn, and then trust that those 20% will really pay off.  
	Explanation \--  
So the 80/20 rule says that 20% of your ideas will account for 80% of your success. Regardless of the numbers, it means that some ideas are really powerful, and be extension that a lot of your ideas will be (for lack of a better word) lame.  
Regardless of the numbers, the concept still stands/  
Part of the process of finding that one idea that yields high results, is being willing to “air” and “voice” all the other bad ideas (and maybe end up looking a little stupid) so that you can find the 1 good one  
The goal of brainstorming, then, isn’t to find a 100 good ideas, but to find 1 exceptional one.

# Email \#015 \- 06/21/2016 \- My team made me write this... 

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
I almost watered down this email because it felt egotistical and self-centered. (You’ll see why in a moment.)  
However, my team encouraged me to share it with you, so I’m going to take a risk and share it with you.  
Are you OK with that?  
In the past month, I’ve read 6 books, gave PowerPoint presentations on 2 of them, shared insights from a third, done 6-7 hours of online training, and spent 10 hours in solitude (processing and strategizing).  
Why? Because I know my limitations. By getting input and wisdom from other people, I can expand the boundaries of what I can do. By imitating what other people are doing well, I increase my value as a leader.  
In the last month, I’ve spent 5 hours in masterminds and engaged in 5 intentional conversations specifically focused on challenges or limitations I was facing. Why? If I’m not actively growing myself, I’m actively limiting my business.  
The growth of your sphere, whether an entrepreneur, CEO, or secretary, will increase only as you grow personally.  
Many people hesitate to invest hard-earned money (or time from a busy schedule) into personal development because it seems like a weak investment with little return. However, the truth is that spending $1000 on personal development could easily yield one idea that returns 10x your investment. Your goal is not to internalize every aspect of the training, but to capture the one piece that is most relevant and helpful and leveraging it as much as possible.  
Personal development is a long-term strategy. Simply by growing 1% every day (excluding weekends and generous vacations), you will 10x your abilities by the end of the year. Grow 2% every day and you’ll 100x your abilities.  
Most people overlook it because the results aren’t always immediate...but they’re always there.  
Don’t settle for where you’re at:   
Be the best you\!

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
By the end of the month, I'll have spent 5 hours in mastermind, taught lessons from 3 books I've read, done 3-4 hours of online training, 10 hours in solitude/strategy  
Background (do NOT put this in the email): talked with some friends of mine who are super-hesitant to cough up dough for a business mastermind. I think I’ve personally invested more money than any of my peers into some form of personal development, and I think it’s paying off.  
Random ideas….  
If you’re not actively growing yourself, you’re actively limiting your business.  
Most people hesitate because it feels like a “soft” investment. The truth is, may spend a $1000 and make a 10x return based on 1 idea of that. Your goal is not to make money off ALL of it--the goal is to capture the part that’s most relevant and helpful.  
This is a long-term play. If you take 5 weeks off, grow 1% every weekday, you’ll 10x your abilities by the end of the year.  
The first $1 (or even $1000) you spend on personal development is the most difficult. However, as soon as you start seeing the benefit of it, you’  
Leadership is leverage, and your ability to lead will always grow your impact.

# Email \#011 \- 2016-03-31 \- Lied to by the truth: When experience is your worst teacher

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Alex just took out a loan to make his payroll. His wife's bloodshot eyes remind him his worrisome tossing and turning keeps her awake at night. He's faced with racing thoughts he can't seem to control, problems he can’t stop spinning around, and an empty feeling in his gut he can’t medicate away.  
His experience in business hasn’t been fun, to say the least. What seemed like a fresh new vision, has turned into a whirling nightmare. And it’s taking it’s toll on his health, on his bank account, and on his marriage.  
“This will never work,” he decides. “It will never take off. I can’t get noticed by new customers. I can’t get referrals from old ones--this just isn’t working. I’m giving my best, but my customers must still not be satisfied. I’m a failure.”  
Experience will teach you more than a thousand books ever will. But depending on how you interpret your experience, what you learn may be valuable or detrimental. It is vital that you pay attention to what you let your experiences tell you.  
For example, what Alex is feeling may be true, to some degree. His customers may not be satisfied, even though he is giving his best. But that doesn’t mean his venture is a failure. There may be open doors for opportunities all around him and this struggle may simply be the hallway leading him to those doors.  
He could either let this lack of referrals be a discouragement or extra motivation to build deeper relationships with his customers so that they want to give referrals. It could either end his career or force him to discover new and more effective ways to gain referrals.  
The things you learn from your experience does not rely strictly on your circumstances but on your perspective of that experience.  
Alex could say with just as much conviction, "This is taking a lot of time and work to get started, but it has the potential to be something really great. So I’m going to stick at it and find effective ways to get those referrals."  
What about you?   
Maybe you’ve had a prospect get upset during a conversation and refuse to talk with you.   
"I'm really bad at communicating with customers" you tell yourself, spending the rest of the day discouraged. But later you learn her mother was recently diagnosed with cancer and has little time to live.   
Are you a bad communicator? Did you respond wrongly? Possibly, but it certainly wasn’t a business-damning failure. And it certainly wasn’t worth spending the day discouraged. Correct any mistakes, write a thoughtful sympathy card, and turn it into a relationship building opportunity.   
Instead of letting the experience simply inform you that you’re a bad communicator: Use it to identify your weakness and let it teach you how to communicate better and how to redeem even your mistakes into opportunities.  
It is important we find ways to create wins for ourselves, such as turning a discouraging conversation into a relationship building opportunity.  
What is your experience actually telling you?  
Learn from that, research and explore it, and give yourself permission to grow.  
When experiences are used rightly, they give powerful insight not only into what you're doing but into who you are.  
And always remember, be the best you\!

# Email \#010 \- 2016-03-31 \- The Curse of Over-Education

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
American education demands that we get our education before we start our career. While this is true for brain surgeons, it's generally false for entrepreneurs.  
Last week I wrote about how important it is for us to live from who we are: “Be Yourself,” as we’re often told. Living from who we are (being), brings clarity about what we are supposed to do.  
“But,” one might say, “before I do anything, I should learn all the in’s and out’s of accounting, leadership, business development, sales, and a hundred other things I should know, right?”  
Actually, not necessarily.  
Most of us get detained learning everything we think we must know before pursuing our vision. We get so busy reading books, we never step out and take action.  
In reality, we should live our lives like this:

1. Ask: “What do I absolutely need to know to take the next step?”  
2. Take the next step.  
3. Repeat.

We as entrepreneurs are often held back by indecisiveness--we’re afraid of hurting our business or revenue by making the wrong decision. But needing to correct a mistake is better than doing nothing at all.  
Don't get caught in analysis paralysis. You’ll find that taking the next step will unlock more answers than a thousand books.  
Always remember, be the best you\!

# Email \#009 \- 2016-03-31 \- Why Being Yourself Isn't Just Hocus Pocus

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
If you’re like me, you’ve probably been told at some point to “Just be yourself.” But what does it actually mean to “be yourself” and why does it matter?  
Think of yourself as a book that everyone you meet is reading. When you walk down the street, people judge you first by your cover, and eventually by your contents if they get to know you. As you interact with strangers or friends, they see the unique message written on the pages of your life.  
People are naturally curious and want to hear your message. They want to know what you care about, what is burning inside of you waiting to come out.   
However, sharing your message is terrifying: What if people don’t like it? What if they critique it, dismiss it, and toss you aside? So it’s easy to shut the covers and try to fake a message you know the world will like.  
But people sense very quickly when we’re lying to them. As frightening as it may be, you must learn to just be yourself. Open up those pages and let people see who you really are and what you care about.  
This is what it means to Be Yourself.  
However, sometimes we don’t even know, ourselves, who we are. That’s why it’s important to slow down, step back, and evaluate who you really are: what actually lies inside the covers of your life.   
What is your message? Because once you know your message--that fire burning inside your chest--you will be able to be yourself, speaking and living your message with clarity and precision.  
Everything in your life revolves around your message (because you’re a book\!).  
You can't escape or ignore it. You must simply embrace it and let it drive every part of your life. Live it 100%. Let it define who you are at work, how you respond in relationships--even how you drive on the freeway.  
   
Finding Your Message  
You won’t find your message in an instant, but you can begin discovering it by:

1. Writing down what breaks your heart and what excites it--this shows where your passion lies.  
2. Noting the patterns in how you relate to others, asking your friends for their perspective--this can reveal your giftings.  
3. Taking time to process life and clear your mind. This may mean journaling, taking walks, going on vacation, detoxing from electronics and media, spending several hours or days alone. This allows new vision, creativity and perspective to surface that otherwise would not have fit into the crowd of thoughts in your mind.

Pay attention to yourself. Think about it. Keep journaling. And as you learn what your message is, live it out, letting it touch every part of what you do.  
And soon you’ll experience the freeing, transformative power of being the Best You.

# Email \#005 \- 2016-03-04 \- Hustling Towards a Sticky Bubblegum Mess?

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Remember when you were a kid, how you’d plop your quarter on the counter at the corner store in exchange for a hard piece of brand new bubble gum? You’d pop it in your mouth and wrap that tough gum around your tongue, blowing until you were red in the face just to get a bubble as big as you could.  
Then it would POP\! and you’d peel the sticky mess off your face and out of your hair.  
Businesses are like bubble gum.  
Just like that brand new piece of gum, they will explode in your face if you grow them too fast with too little support.  
As entrepreneurs, we are hungry for results. We love to jump in head first at warp speed to either “go big” or “go home”.  
This simply isn’t sustainable. Of course you want your business to grow and make money fast.  
But if you only focus your attention on getting as many customers as you can, you won’t give them the quality attention they deserve.   
Instead of having a small number of happy customers who are willing to open their wallets, you’ll have a large amount of disgruntled customers and employees who will simply walk away.  
And you’ll be left picking the bubble gum off your face and out of your hair.  
It's tempting to race from crisis to crisis, doing the most urgent thing. However, your goal in business isn’t merely results. Your real job is to create and grow a scalable business.   
And that’s something that demands more than just your hustling. It demands strength and reinforcement.  
When you grow like that, you’ll have the confidence that you’re strong for the long haul.  
What’s more, you won’t be stuck picking the sticky mess out of your hair.  
And always remember, be the best you.

# Email \#004 \- 2016-03-07 \- Skip Bobby and Get to Work

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Bobby is a typical five-year-old who can’t stay focused on an activity for even five minutes. His mom takes him to the playground to burn some energy while she does paperwork. But Bobby, whose mind never lacks creative adventures, skips from tree to bush to squirrel, and his Mom is the one burning energy.   
Last week he was intent on defeating Captain Blackbeard back at the playground. But that was last week’s adventure. There are way too many trees to climb, villains to find, and new adventures to start for Bobby to stay at the old, boring playground.   
Let old Blackbeard have the monkey bars. The five year is moving on to something more exciting.  
Ever felt like a Bobby? So many customers to pursue, budgets to balance, and employees to manage. It’s easy to drift into cyberland to retreat from the follow-ups and budgets. Constantly bouncing from idea, to distraction, to responsibility, back to distraction, you feel you’re getting nothing done but exasperated exhaustion. Now it’s midnight and you need to wake up in six hours.  
You keep telling yourself you need to be more disciplined and focused, but you find yourself meandering to activities more interesting or engaging at the moment.  
Meanwhile, nothing really gets done.  
So, how can you stay focused on the present?  
The ability to be “present” is built directly upon your ability to build practical boundaries around your life, work, and emotions.   
Take advantage of the boundaries already built for you:

1. Turn your cell phone on “Do Not Disturb” so you can focus on strategic tasks.  
2. If you find yourself distracted by social media or email while doing computer work,  use an app like “Self Control” (for Mac users) or “Cold Turkey” (for Windows users) to temporarily block certain websites.

Intentionally disconnect from your work at the end of the day, and choose not to check your e-mail on the weekend. Do what it takes to cut distractions from your life\!  
Most importantly, develop “Strong Yes’s.”  
Every “No” can be overpowered by a stronger “Yes.”  
Don’t say “No” to Facebook. Say “Yes” to a productive day, a successful business, and a free evening with family. Yes, even say “yes” to rest\!   
Those e-mails will still be there when you get back to work on Monday morning.  
“Strong Yes’s” overpower distractions and enables you to make the most of each opportunity by living 100 percent in the moment.  
When you live fully in the present, you are free to give life your full attention, do what you really love, and know that life will take you where you want to be. Be kind to yourself and live in the present\!  
Your best you is in the present: be the best you\!

# Boundaries, Presence, and Worry

I have a theory that the ability to be present is directly connected to being able the draw solid boundaries in life, including having solid emotional boundaries, work/life barriers, and strong yeses.  
\*\*\*Content for another email  
And that worry is often just trying to solve something you cannot solve in the present, and a poor boundary with your problems. When you relegate your problems to when you can solve them, you can trust both the work and creative process to resolve them. 

# Email \#002 \- 2016-03-04 \- The Entrepreneurial Crash and a High School Work Ethic

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
My colleague Josh reminisced to me about his high school days. His fellow classmates would constantly fluctuate between working hard and slacking off.  
One week they’d party as much as they could and the next week they worked overtime to cram for the deadline. The second the deadline was over, they’d kick back and relax until their laziness caught up with them, and they would start their next race against the clock.   
Sometimes we inadvertently adopt a high school work ethic. We sprint hard for a while making sales and completing projects, only to crash from exhaustion.  
It’s crucial that we find a sustainable pace for the long haul, asking questions like:

* How do I balance “tangible results” with “mundane management”?  
* What are absolute essentials that only I can do?  
* Who do I need to train or hire to do some of my work for me?  
* How many hours do I need to rest physically and mentally per week so I don’t crash a few weeks or months down the road?

No one can sprint for extended periods of time. Find the pace that works for you and do whatever it takes to stay in the race for the long haul.  
And always remember, be the best you.

* Matthias

# Business cycles and pacing

Josh told the story this morning about how when he was in high school, some of the students would go back-and-forth between high privilege and low privilege. This is a lot like some business owners where they go from a boom to bust sales cycle. This is more than a treadmill, because a truck noble actually stabilize you because you set the pace at which you're willing to go.  
However, if you're unable to pace self, you will run at sprints and then wear yourself out. This is the same kind of effect that happens to runners when they don't pace themselves. But the key is to learn how to pace yourself and follow that pace at a sustainable rate.  
This is another way of looking at the 30 mile march by Jim Collins

# Email \#022 \- 09/13/2016 \- Why Great Leaders Aren't Actually Like Shepherds

Title:

* Great Leaders Don’t Herd  
* Great Leaders Aren’t Shepherds  
* **Why Great Leaders Aren’t Actually Shepherds**  
* Great Leaders Nurture  
* How to Get Your Followers Producing  
* How Great Leaders Get Results  
* Be a Gardener, Not a Shepherd

{{ subscriber.first\_name }},  
Do you ever find it difficult to keep the people under you engaged in their work?   
Many leaders, whether businessmen, pastors, or moms at home, struggle to help their followers take ownership of their responsibilities and stay deeply engaged in their work.  
Many leaders focus on motivating their people to do certain tasks. They act like shepherds who steer their sheep to the right destination.   
This makes sense to most of us, because it sounds like real leadership. After all, doesn’t this create the desired outcomes? For many, it is the only kind of leadership they know.  
However, this approach creates a nightmare for the leader. One stray sheep--one employee mistake--stalls the entire flock and delays progress. Worse yet, when sheep wander from the path, they cannot find their own way back home.  
Instead of acting as sheep herders, great leaders act as gardeners. They focus on creating healthy habitats where plants grow naturally on their own.  
Great leaders don’t herd. Great leaders nurture. As gardeners, they create healthy habitats, ecosystems where their followers can thrive. Just like a well-tended garden bears robust fruit, healthy ecosystems within a company grows people who deliver successful outcomes.  
As a leader, you want those under you to thrive on their own. Great results come from employees who take ownership of their work without you micromanaging their job for them.  
Be a gardener, not a shepherd. Focus on helping your employees thrive where they’re planted. This will encourage them to take ownership of their responsibilities, resulting in positive outcomes.  
How have you nurtured healthy ecosystems for your followers? What were some of your successes? What were some of your failures?  
In next week’s email, we’ll explore deeper what exactly separates a gardener from a shepherd.  
Until then…  
Be the best you\!

*  Matthias

Ecosystems (this could be a 2-part series)  
Wealth and success is about creating ecosystems that are healthy and that thrive. This changes the definition of leadership.  
The Shepherd

* Think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things  
* Requires you to drive things forward  
* Puts you in the hub of the wheel and everything circles around you  
* Herds sheep/moves people to get to a certain place  
* Focused on assigning tasks and getting them done

The Gardener

* Focuses leadership on creating a culture where things get done  
* Allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.  
* Focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own  
* Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results  
* What makes a healthy environment?  
* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself  
* When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a byproduct of that.

If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.  
Most people think of leadership in terms of getting people to do certain things, which is only partially true. You can either focus your leadership on that, OR...you can focus your leadership on creating a culture where things get done.  
One approach requires you to be driving things forward.  
The other approach allows you to create an environment that drives things forward.  
One approach puts you in the hub of the wheel, and everything circles around you.  
….  
Another example \-- the difference between herding sheep, or moving them to get to a certain place  
vs. a gardener who is focused on creating the correct environment where the plants will naturally grow on their own.  
….  
Another question to go with this...what are the things that make the difference between a gardener and a “driver” (for lack of a better term)?

* Focused on growing people, so they will get the right results, vs. focused on assigning tasks and getting them done  
  What makes a healthy environment?  
* Freedom to fail  
* Freedom to take initiative  
* Freedom to disagree  
* Freedom to think for yourself

When you create the proper ecosystem, the successful outcomes come as a by-product of that. If you’re not getting the results you want, rather than focusing merely on the surface level, focus on cultural/ecosystem changes you need to make to get the right results.
