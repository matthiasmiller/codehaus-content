The Kolbe Index (Instinct Test) is unique. It does not measure intelligence, personality or social style. It measures the instinctive ways you take action when you strive.	

Your result will describe your natural strengths – your modus operandi (MO).	

There are **two responses for each** question – **MOST and LEAST**. Choose ONE response for the way you would MOST likely act if you were free to be yourself, and then choose ONE response for the action you are LEAST likely to take.

There are no right or wrong answers. If you are not sure which option to choose, ask yourself what you would do, "if free to be myself."
