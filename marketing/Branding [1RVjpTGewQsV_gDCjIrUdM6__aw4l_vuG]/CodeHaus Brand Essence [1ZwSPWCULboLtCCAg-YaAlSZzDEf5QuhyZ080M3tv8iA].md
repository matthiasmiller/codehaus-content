# **Brand Essence Document**

Structural Outline & Reference Guide

*Based on Parmee's NeuroBrand Framework*

# **Framework Overview**

The NeuroBrand framework organizes brand essence into **three core pillars**: Authority, Leadership, and Community (Connection). Each pillar serves a distinct function in how clients perceive and choose to work with you.

| AUTHORITY (\~30%) | LEADERSHIP (\~40%) | COMMUNITY (\~30%) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| *Trust & Relevance* | *Vision & Differentiation* | *Connection & Resonance* |
| What need are you fulfilling? Are they clear on what they get from you? | Why your way vs. alternatives? What you stand for/against? | Who are you as a person? Why do they resonate with YOU? |

# **Document Structure by Section**

## **1\. Core Positioning**

**Pillar:** Authority  **|  Curriculum:** Weeks 1-2

**Purpose:** Establishes what you do, for whom, and the core problem you solve. This grounds everything else.

**Components:**

* **Tagline:** 2-5 word encapsulation (e.g., "Financial truth for manufacturers")  
* **Fuller Version:** 1-2 sentence elevator pitch that expands the tagline

# **BRAND ESSENCE SUMMARY**

# **CORE POSITIONING**

## **Tagline**

Financial truth for manufacturers.

## **Fuller Version**

*"I'm a Fractional CFO who delivers financial truth for manufacturers \- the hard conversations AND the execution to make it real."*

## **Differentiator**

**"Others advise. We execute with intention."**

# **BRAND POSITIONING STATEMENT**

I’m a Fractional CFO for manufacturers who value excellence and need financial clarity to scale confidently. I specialize in financial systems and visibility. I build the financial infrastructure that reveals profitability truth \-- without being captive to the limitations of Excel spreadsheets, fragmented software, failed implementations, or manual processes that keep you flying blind.

# **BRAND CORE MESSAGE**

## **Short Version**

*"Manufacturers are flying blind \- making critical decisions without the systems to see what's actually happening, and lacking the support to make the tough calls their business needs."*

## **Full Version**

*"Manufacturers are flying blind on their financial reality \- they can't see what's actually profitable, what's draining cash, or where to focus because their systems fragment data across Excel, disconnected software, and manual processes. And even when they sense what's wrong, they lack the clarity or support to have the hard conversations and make the tough calls that would change it."*

# **PHILOSOPHY: THE 3 PILLARS**

1\. INSIGHT (Financial Truth)

Seeing reality clearly. From guessing to knowing. From blind to seeing what’s actually profitable, what’s draining cash, what’s working and what isn’t. “You can’t change what you won’t see.”

2\. CONVERSATION (Courageous Dialogue)

Speaking truth clearly. Hard conversations about what the numbers reveal. Kind but honest dialogue about strategic direction \- including when people, products, or customers aren’t contributing. “You can’t fix what you won’t discuss.”

3\. ACTION (Disciplined Execution)

Building truth into systems. Engineering discipline applied to financial infrastructure. Iterative execution \- build, prove, expand. Systems that fit your business and evolve with it. Working systems over perfect plans. “You can’t benefit from what you won’t do.”

# **METHOD: THE ADAPTIVE ENGINEERING CYCLE**

**ASSESS → BUILD → DEPLOY → PROVE → REPEAT**

### **1\. ASSESS**

Find where it's actually broken (not 6-week audit, find the constraint)

### **2\. BUILD**

Engineer the fix myself (not recommend, not delegate \- I build it)

### **3\. DEPLOY**

Get it in their hands working (not "go live and good luck")

### **4\. PROVE**

Real results before moving on (not theoretical \- actual profitability insights)

### **5\. REPEAT**

Next constraint

## **Key Differentiator**

*"Most consultants analyze, recommend, and leave. I assess, build, deploy, and prove results before moving to the next piece. You get working systems, not action plans."*

## **Execution Philosophy**

***"I'm not here to just talk about what needs to happen. I'm here to make sure things actually get done. Change happens. Things get measured. Decisions get made."***

# **BRAND AMPLIFIERS**

## **Amplifier \#1: Enterprise Expertise Meets Human Understanding**

*(What you BRING)*

I bring enterprise-level systems engineering \- I've co-architected fully custom ERPs and built solutions across a dozen industries. I take this same engineering-like precision to cutting through the noise of numbers and finding the true story of what's really going on. But I've also experienced the crushing weight of unforgiving systems that don't fit reality. This combination means I know how to engineer systems at scale AND ensure they align with how your business actually works, so your people can thrive, not just survive.

## **Amplifier \#2: Knowing, Being Known, and Courage**

*(Who you ARE)*

I believe manufacturers don't just need better systems \- they need someone who will truly know their business and have the courage to tell them what others won't. I create the space for leaders to be known, not just advised \- and I'll walk alongside you through the hard conversations that are both intimidating and liberating. I co-create WITH you, not do it TO you. I believe embracing truth and reality is the most solid foundation for a healthy, growing business

## **Amplifier \#3: Iterative Execution**

*(How you WORK)*

I'm execution-focused, not merely advisory. I don't analyze and recommend, I make sure to deliver on working systems where change happens, things get measured, and decisions get made. I use an iterative approach over full system overhauls: assess where it's broken, build the fix, deploy it, prove it works, then move to the next constraint. Lower risk, faster value, compounding improvements. I think in layers \- when I build part 1, I already see how other parts will integrate.

# **CORE BRAND PRINCIPLES**

### **1\. Financial truth over financial advice**

You can't engineer what you won't face. Reality (even painful) beats delusion every time.

### **2\. Your business deserves the same engineering discipline you apply to your products**

If you engineer to the thousandth of an inch, your profitability systems deserve equal precision.

### **3\. Working systems beat perfect plans \- build in minimum viable doses**

Iterative building with real feedback trumps 6-month transformation projects. Only plan as much as necessary, no more. Execution reveals what planning can't predict.

### **4\. Systems should conform to your business, not vice versa**

Software exists to serve your operations, not the other way around.

### **5\. Continuous improvement applies to business systems, not just operations**

The same constraint-based thinking you use on the shop floor works for financial infrastructure.

### **6\. Engineer for simplicity, build from concrete reality**

Complexity is the enemy of execution. Systems tied to real business objects (products, customers, orders) work better than abstract frameworks. Add sophistication only where it creates value.

### **7\. The hardest conversations are often the most important ones**

Avoiding the truth to protect feelings costs more than facing it together. Reality spoken with courage, curiosity, and kindness is the foundation for healthy, lasting change.

# **BRAND'S VISION FOR THE FUTURE**

*I see a future where manufacturers run their businesses with the same precision they engineer their products \- where everyone has accurate, real-time access to the few critical financial truths they need to excel at their job. Where leaders have the courage and support to face reality together, and hard conversations happen early, not when it's too late. No drowning in data. No flying blind. Just simple, engineered systems that reveal what matters, when it matters, for the people who need it.*

# **BRAND CREDIBILITY**

## **Enterprise Systems Engineering Background**

* Helped develop core infrastructure for financial software used by top US banks and insurance companies to manage trillions of dollars in investments  
* Deep expertise in building systems where failure isn't an option

## **Manufacturing & Cross-Industry Expertise**

* Co-architected fully custom ERP systems and implemented full accounting/ERP integration for manufacturers  
* Built financial and operational solutions across 12+ industries, for companies from $10M to $100M+ in annual revenue  
* Understand what works at scale and what breaks under pressure

## **Owner/Investor Mindset with Deep Client Partnership**

* Run my own business with skin in the game \- I make payroll, take financial risk, and live with every decision I engineer, just like you do  
* Did the work of a Fractional CFO long before I had the title \- financial strategy, systems implementation, profitability analysis, and the hard conversations that come with it  
* Built tools that others said would never succeed, because I was able to fit the tools to how people actually work. People \- not merely technology \- are a make-or-break factor in any system.

# **ORIGIN STORY: 3 PIVOTAL MOMENTS**

## **Moment \#1: The Foundation (Age 8 → Age 14\)**

I started coding at 8 years old. By 14, when my dad's accountant bailed, I convinced him to move from paper to QuickBooks. I learned payroll, taxes, reconciliation \- and built my first SOPs so he could run reports without me. I automated sales tax imports. Within a year, I'd trained my replacement. That's when I learned: systems thinking applies everywhere. Good financial systems give you precision control. Bad ones leave you flying blind.

## **Moment \#2: The Calling (The Convergence)**

Working with a $10M+ manufacturer on accounting automation, something clicked. I shared my excitement at a peer group, and one guy said he got tears in his eyes hearing someone who actually LOVED accounting. I realized I was the "Moneyball guy" \- I saw patterns in numbers others missed. Then it hit me: software engineering principles apply to business, finance, and operations. Manufacturing is where it all converges \- systematic, repeatable, precision-driven. Everything I loved came together in helping manufacturers engineer their business systems with the same discipline they engineer their products.

## **Moment \#3: The Liberation (Surrendering to Truth)**

I spent years trying to be what everyone told me I should be \- sales expert, marketing expert, growth expert. I told Josh Long, an exceptional business consultant, about the work I'd been doing. He told me point blank: "You do know you've been doing the work of a fractional CFO?" The self-protective ego fell apart. I could finally surrender to being who I actually was rather than all the things I felt pressured to be. I could deliver financial truth for manufacturers \- and that was enough. That was everything.

# **NEW PARADIGM (DRAFT)**

OLD PARADIGM: Truth Avoidance

“Financial truth is dangerous \- it exposes problems, creates conflict, and requires painful changes. Better to manage around it, stay high-level, and avoid the hard conversations.”

NEW PARADIGM: Truth Seeking

“Financial truth is oxygen \- seeing it clearly, speaking it courageously, and building it into your systems is the only path to real health and growth.”

# **TOOLS \+ ABILITIES FRAMEWORK (DRAFT)**

***YOU build the tools → THEY gain abilities they didn't have before***

## **Phase 1: ASSESS**

**Tool:** Breakdown analysis showing exactly where data/visibility fails  
**Abilities unlocked:** See where they're actually flying blind; Prioritize what to fix first based on impact

## **Phase 2: BUILD**

**Tools:** Custom operational systems that capture accurate data; Automated data flows between systems; Validation rules that enforce quality  
**Abilities unlocked:** Generate accurate cost data by product/customer; Track profitability in real-time instead of months later; Trust their numbers are right

## **Phase 3: DEPLOY**

**Tools:** Working dashboards/reports accessible to their team; Real-time financial visibility  
**Abilities unlocked:** Price products based on actual profitability data; Make hiring decisions with confidence; See which customers/products are profitable

## **Phase 4: PROVE**

**Tools:** Demonstrated ROI from deployed systems; Validated financial insights  
**Abilities unlocked:** Make strategic decisions on financial reality; Stop flying blind on specific areas

## **Phase 5: REPEAT**

**Tools:** Next layer of systems addressing next constraint; Expanded financial infrastructure  
**Abilities unlocked:** Continuously improve decision-making with better data; Scale with confidence instead of chaos

# **Brand Enemies — Matthias Miller**

*Common beliefs or teachings you are opposing. Not people or companies, but ways of thinking that are problematic in your space.*

*Purpose: Polarity and differentiation. Brand enemies act as a filter for your clients—people who resonate with your way of thinking come in; people who don't, self-select out.*

---

## **1\. Savior Thinking**

**The belief:** Something or someone external will rescue you from your problems—the right software, the right hire, the right consultant, the right vendor. You just need to find it, buy it, and your problems will be solved.

**How it shows up:**

* "Once we implement \[ERP/software\], everything will work"  
* "We just need to hire a \[controller/ops manager/sales leader\] and they'll fix it"  
* "The consultants will figure it out"  
* "This vendor promised it would do exactly what we need"

**Why it's harmful:** It outsources ownership of your problems. You stop doing the hard work of understanding your own business—seeing what's actually broken, having the hard conversations, building the capability internally. You become dependent on external saviors who don't have to live with the consequences.

And when the savior fails (which they often do), you're worse off than before: you've spent the money, lost the time, and *still* haven't faced the underlying reality. So you go looking for the next savior.

**What you stand FOR:**

* *You* have to own the truth of your business  
* I work *with* you, not *for* you—I co-create, not rescue  
* I build capability that stays when I leave  
* No saviors. Just disciplined, iterative work on what's actually broken.

---

## **2\. Reality Avoidance Culture**

**The belief:** You can manage around uncomfortable truths—that avoiding hard numbers, hard conversations, and hard decisions somehow protects you or your business.

**How it shows up:**

* "As long as we're profitable overall, we're fine"  
* Not looking at product-level or customer-level profitability  
* Avoiding conversations about underperforming people, products, or customers  
* Staying "high-level" to avoid facing specifics  
* Numbing with busyness, achievement, or overwork instead of facing what's broken

**Why it's harmful:** Reality doesn't care whether you acknowledge it. Avoidance doesn't make problems smaller; it compounds them. The manufacturer who won't look at product-level profitability doesn't stop losing money on those products—they just don't know they're losing it until it's too late.

Avoiding reality is the root of most destruction. You can't change what you won't see. You can't fix what you won't discuss. You can't benefit from what you won't do.

**What you stand FOR:**

* Truth as the prerequisite for meaningful change  
* Financial truth over financial advice  
* Reality (even painful) beats delusion every time  
* Seeing clearly, speaking courageously, acting decisively

---

## **3\. Armchair Sherpas (Analyze-and-Leave Consulting)**

**The belief:** Advisors who analyze, recommend, and leave are providing real value. Strategy decks and recommendations equal progress.

**How it shows up:**

* Consultants who deliver reports but don't build anything  
* Recommendations without execution  
* "Best practices" that don't account for your actual situation  
* Mentors selling maps to places they've never been  
* Advisors who've never made payroll, never watched an implementation fail at 2am, never had to live with the consequences

**Why it's harmful:** Analysis isn't action. Their advice sounds good but isn't pressure-tested. They've never been in the valley—they're comfortable on the peak, pointing at paths they've never walked.

And their fear of real engagement is contagious—it teaches clients that analysis is the same as action, that having a plan is the same as having results.

**What you stand FOR:**

* Skin in the game  
* I assess, build, deploy, and prove results before moving on  
* Working systems, not action plans  
* I've been in the valley. I know what it costs.

---

## **4\. Enemy Mode Leadership**

**The belief:** Hard business decisions require disconnecting from people—that you have to choose between relationships and results, and "real leaders" choose results.

**How it shows up:**

* Making decisions about people purely through spreadsheets  
* Treating employees as resources to be optimized  
* Avoiding relationships to stay "objective"  
* Believing that caring about people makes you soft or less effective  
* "It's just business"

**Why it's harmful:** It destroys trust, drives out your best people, and ultimately undermines the very results it claims to pursue. The manufacturer who disconnects from relationships to pursue results ends up with a spreadsheet for a culture.

Enemy mode—disconnecting from relationships to pursue results—destroys everything it touches. You can't build a healthy business by treating people as obstacles to efficiency.

**What you stand FOR:**

* Integration of head and heart  
* Hard conversations done WITH people, not TO them  
* Courageous dialogue that's both kind and honest  
* Leaders who toggle fluidly between analysis and relationship  
* You don't have to choose between results and humanity

---

## **5\. Systems as Masters**

**The belief:** The right software, the right ERP, the right system will solve your problems. Technology can replace human judgment.

**How it shows up:**

* "The software will tell us what to do"  
* Rigid processes that don't allow for exceptions  
* Employees who can't think outside the system  
* Blaming the software when the real problem is undefined requirements or lack of ownership  
* Systematizing everything until people become robots

**Why it's harmful:** When systems become the master, your best employees leave and your best customers feel like they're talking to robots. You end up with people who can't think for themselves—dependency instead of capability.

Systems can fail in two directions: they can enslave people by trapping them in rigid structures, or they can replace judgment by pretending every situation fits a flowchart. Systems make great servants but terrible masters.

**What you stand FOR:**

* Systems that free humans to focus judgment where it matters  
* Technology as servant, not savior  
* Good systems handle predictable scenarios so humans can focus on everything else  
* People \+ systems \+ courage together

---

## **6\. "Whatever Gets the Job Done" / Black-and-White Thinking**

**The belief:** Business is purely mechanical. Find the next task, execute it, move on. Every problem has a clear, linear solution—just follow the spreadsheet, the process, the flowchart. Efficiency over meaning. Numbers over nuance.

**How it shows up:**

* Leaders buried in tactical work who never step back to see patterns  
* Treating decisions as math problems with one right answer  
* "Just give me the number"—without asking what the number *means*  
* Reducing complex situations to binary choices  
* Expecting data to tell them what to do, rather than inform judgment  
* Dismissing intuition, relationships, or "soft" signals as distractions from "real work"

**Why it's harmful:** It misses what's actually happening. Functional thinking asks "what needs to happen next?" but never asks "what belongs together?" or "what's the pattern underneath?"

The manufacturer who only sees the P\&L misses that their best customer is about to leave. The owner who decides purely by spreadsheet ends up with a spreadsheet for a culture. You need holistic thinking to see the structure *and* functional thinking to work within it—not one or the other.

**What you stand FOR:**

* Whole-brained leadership  
* Integration of analysis and intuition, data and relationship  
* The numbers tell you *what*; judgment tells you *so what* and *now what*  
* Strategic leaders toggle consciously between seeing the structure and working within it

## **BRAND ENEMIES REFERENCE TABLE**

| Brand Enemy | Core Belief You Oppose | What You Stand FOR |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Savior Thinking | External solutions will rescue you | Ownership, co-creation, no saviors |
| Reality Avoidance Culture | You can manage around uncomfortable truths | Truth as prerequisite for change |
| Armchair Sherpas | Analysis and recommendations equal value | Skin in the game, working systems |
| Enemy Mode Leadership | Results require disconnecting from people | Head and heart integration |
| Systems as Masters | Technology can replace human judgment | Systems as servants, not masters |
| "Whatever Gets the Job Done" | Business is purely mechanical and linear | Whole-brained leadership |

---

## **HOW TO USE BRAND ENEMIES**

**Remember Parmees's guidelines:**

1. **Be vocal about WHY you're opposing them** — Don't just call them out. Explain what harm comes from this way of thinking.

2. **Don't make enemies the CORE of your message** — Stand FOR something, not just against. Enemies are a filter, not your identity.

3. **Educate, don't attack** — Come from a place of helping people see what's problematic, not from anger or superiority.

4. **These should feel natural** — If you find yourself wanting to rant about it, it's probably a real enemy. If it feels forced, it's not yours.

| Brand Enemy | Supporting Parables |
| ----- | ----- |
| Savior Thinking | Mentor who didn't reveal full cost; Hands-off client; Bankruptcy that could have been avoided; CEO who trusted wrong expert; 3 years to fulfill 6-month promise |

## **CHARACTER TRAITS (Fortitude, Resilience, Persistence)**

### **The Math Competition in Third Grade**

In third grade, I couldn't attend a math competition because of money. For years, I interpreted this as a story about lack—what I didn't have, what was denied to me.

But looking back, I realized the story was actually about math. One of my classmates told me she expected me to get the book on shortcut math when she saw it—because that's who I was. I was the kid who saw patterns in numbers.

The constraint wasn't the point. The gift was.

**What it illustrates:** The difference between a scarcity narrative and an identity narrative. You can tell the same story as "I was denied opportunities" or "I was already becoming who I am."

### **The Accounting Integration That "Couldn't Be Done"**

I took on an end-to-end accounting integration for a manufacturer—a project others said couldn't be done. An OG in the industry acknowledged that integration would work better than the alternatives, but warned it might cost just as much as other approaches.

I did it anyway. And it worked.

**What it illustrates:** When others see impossibility, sometimes they're just seeing complexity they haven't organized yet. Elegant solutions reveal truth.

---

### **The Software Report: 8.5 Seconds to 5.5 Seconds**

Years ago, I worked for a software company. Users complained about a report being slow. I got tasked with fixing it. Three rules: fast, memory-efficient, works.

Instead of tweaking the existing approach, I found a fundamentally different algorithm and adapted it for our situation. The report went from 8.5 seconds to 5.5 seconds—35% faster.

Nobody cared how I did it. They cared that it worked.

**What it illustrates:** Incremental improvements come from small tweaks. Exponential change only comes from fundamentally rearranging how work gets done.

---

## **VALUES (Integrity, Truth-Telling, Craftsmanship)**

### **The $40K Management Failure (The 200% Loss)**

I took on a software project that ended in a 200% loss—meaning I would have been better off taking a 4-month vacation than doing the work. Hundreds of hours invested, and the project actually cost me double what I would have earned if everything had gone perfectly.

The failure wasn't technical. I built custom tools before the position was fully defined. I stepped into a role that didn't align with my strengths. I created an overly complicated solution to an undefined problem. I tried to rebuild before the requirements were defined.

What I thought was a technical or project management failure was actually a misalignment failure. The client and I had different expectations, different visions. We were misaligned from the start, and no amount of technical brilliance could have saved it.

**What it illustrates:** Management matters more than marketing. Alignment precedes execution. You can't build the right thing if you haven't defined what "right" means. Solving the wrong problem makes everything worse.

---

### **First Boss: The Values Clash**

My first "real job" was as a software developer. The company culture celebrated compliance, order, pragmatism, execution. I was too creative, too interested in building new things, too idealistic, too big-picture.

One day, I found myself in a software design discussion. In the middle of the conversation, I realized that no matter how good my argument was, I was going to lose. The conversation had shifted from finding the best approach to a power dynamic about who was going to win.

I lost. I left that conversation with a kind of pent-up anger I had never experienced before. I grabbed my shoes and went on a 1-mile run to blow off the steam.

I knew I didn't like it. But I had no idea it wasn't normal—or that I didn't have to tolerate it.

**What it illustrates:** The moment I recognized power-over dynamics. Values and talents can disqualify you from promotion. Environments that demand you be something you're not will eventually force a choice.

---

### **Candor in Sales: Bringing Truth to the Conversation**

I've been in sales conversations that were misleading at best, manipulative at worst. One person promised to show me how to get content in front of more people for free. On the call, it quickly shifted to "How much revenue are you making?" I knew exactly where it was going.

I stopped the conversation. Called them out on whether I was actually a fit for their service. They agreed I wasn't. And they never fulfilled on the promise that got me on the call.

I can tolerate a lot of things. But I don't tolerate manipulation. If you use manipulative language or tactics, I'll assume there's a culture behind you that tolerates and possibly supports that behavior.

**What it illustrates:** Truth-telling isn't just a value—it's a filter. If the only way to sell something is through manipulation, get a different product and a different way to sell.

---

## **HOW YOU THINK (Systems Thinking, Seeing Patterns)**

### **Coding at Age 8 → QuickBooks at 14**

I started coding at 8 years old. By 14, when my dad's accountant bailed, I convinced him to move from paper to QuickBooks. I learned payroll, taxes, reconciliation—and built my first SOPs so he could run reports without me. I automated sales tax imports. Within a year, I'd trained my replacement.

That's when I learned: systems thinking applies everywhere. Good financial systems give you precision control. Bad ones leave you flying blind.

**What it illustrates:** The foundation of everything I do now was already forming in childhood. Systems thinking isn't something I learned—it's how my brain has always worked.

---

### **Burnt Popcorn and Flight Simulator**

Years ago, my friend and I were hanging out at his house after school. We decided to make microwave popcorn while playing Flight Simulator. We got lost in the game. The next thing we knew, the smell of burnt popcorn filled the house. His mom smelled it from outside when she pulled into the driveway.

Despite our horrible culinary skills, I loved Flight Simulator. I loved that you could put yourself into a world, see what it was like, hone your skills, and test the consequences.

I realized I use these same simulator skills in my consulting: Jump into a world. Take a 360-degree look around. Simulate different situations, paths, and approaches. Find the one with the best outcome and least downside. Then jump back out and make a recommendation.

**What it illustrates:** How I approach complex business problems—immersive simulation before commitment. And I try to avoid burning the popcorn while I do it.

---

### **Rest Solving What Grinding Couldn't**

A client gave me 5 problems to solve. I had solutions for 4 by end of day. But I kept hitting my head against the wall on the 5th.

My OLD response would have been: freak out, work harder, muscle through it, stay up late, stress out.

My NEW response: I took Friday off for strategic work. Knocked off early. Took Saturday and Sunday to hang with my wife and kids. Slept in Monday.

I fired up my computer, pulled up our meeting transcript, reviewed a few things—and within 10 minutes, knew exactly what needed to happen.

Was it the exact timeline the client wanted? No. Was it the best possible outcome given the situation? Yes.

**What it illustrates:** Rest beats grinding. If you're stuck on a problem, set it aside. Go play with your kids. Pick it up when you're ready.

---

## **WHY YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU BELIEVE**

### **Tears in His Eyes at the Peer Group**

Working with a $10M+ manufacturer on accounting automation, something clicked. I shared my excitement at a peer group, and one guy said he got tears in his eyes hearing someone who actually LOVED accounting.

I realized I was the "Moneyball guy"—I saw patterns in numbers others missed. Then it hit me: software engineering principles apply to business, finance, and operations. Manufacturing is where it all converges—systematic, repeatable, precision-driven.

Everything I loved came together in helping manufacturers engineer their business systems with the same discipline they engineer their products.

**What it illustrates:** Finding your calling. Being seen for who you actually are. The moment you stop fighting your nature and start leaning into it.

---

### **Josh Long: "You Do Know You've Been Doing Fractional CFO Work?"**

I spent years trying to be what everyone told me I should be—sales expert, marketing expert, growth expert. I told Josh Long, an exceptional business consultant, about the work I'd been doing.

He told me point blank: "You do know you've been doing the work of a fractional CFO?"

The self-protective ego fell apart. I could finally surrender to being who I actually was rather than all the things I felt pressured to be. I could deliver financial truth for manufacturers—and that was enough. That was everything.

**What it illustrates:** Surrendering to truth about yourself. Liberation from performing. Sometimes someone else has to name what you've been avoiding.

---

### **The Year Mentorships Fell Away**

Over the course of one year, I watched mentorship after mentorship fall off—not because of dramatic failures or blowups, but because they were distorting my inner knowing. Each one was trying to fix me rather than know me. And the more I stayed in them, the further I drifted from myself.

The pattern became undeniable: most mentorships are attempts to fix, not to know. They start from "you're broken" and shape you toward someone else's image. They're the paid version of armchair Sherpas—selling maps to places they've never been, or worse, places you were never meant to go.

**What it illustrates:** "You don't need to be fixed. You need to be known." Mentorship that distorts is worse than no mentorship. The cost of staying too long is losing yourself.

---

### **The Shapeshifter Who Forgot Which One Was Real**

I became a master shapeshifter. Professional Matthias for clients. Spiritual Matthias for church folks. Intellectual Matthias for academics. Fun Matthias for social settings. Driven Matthias for business partners.

I forgot which one was real.

Three years ago, I made a decision that many would call "business suicide." I stopped trying to convince anyone to work with me. No more persuasion tactics. No more overcoming objections. No more fake urgency. No more being who they needed me to be.

Instead, I started showing up as myself. Messy. Questioning. Sometimes uncertain. Always real.

I did lose clients. Revenue dropped. Some months were scary.

But something else happened. The right people started finding me. People who didn't need me to be perfect. Who valued truth over polish. Who were tired of pretending too.

**What it illustrates:** Pretending costs more than authenticity—you just pay in different currency: your soul, one compromise at a time. When you're everything to everyone, you're nothing to yourself.

---

## **SAVIOR THINKING (Brand Enemy Illustrations)**

### **The Mentor Who Didn't Reveal the Full Cost**

I've hired mentors expecting them to solve problems I couldn't solve myself. More than once, I discovered they couldn't address the basic issue I was facing—their persuasive marketing had painted a picture that didn't match my reality.

One time, they didn't reveal the total cost upfront. By the time I understood what the full solution would require, I'd already committed—and I couldn't afford to finish. I lost everything.

**What it illustrates:** Savior Thinking cuts both ways. The savior often believes their own marketing. And when the true cost is hidden—whether in dollars, time, or complexity—you end up worse than if you'd never started.

---

### **The Hands-Off Client and the Perfect Storm**

A client hired me to fix a problem but stayed completely hands-off. I got buried trying to fix what I knew, but didn't have the support or context to address the full scope.

It was a perfect storm: a mentor who encouraged me to take the project, a client who hired but didn't manage, and my own determination to make it work even when the writing was on the wall.

I should have walked sooner. I didn't.

**What it illustrates:** Savior Thinking isn't just about expecting *others* to save you—it's also about being cast as someone else's savior. No one can fix what the owner won't engage with. The savior dynamic fails both directions.

---

### **The Bankruptcy That Could Have Been Avoided**

A friend recounted a tragic manufacturing bankruptcy story. Angry customers. Hate mail. Staff members grilled for the owner's contact information. Employees walking out with large pieces of equipment.

Quite a few things went wrong. But I couldn't stop zeroing in on one piece that seemed absolutely avoidable: the software that should have shown them what they needed to know—and didn't.

**What it illustrates:** The savior (the ERP) failed silently. By the time they knew, it was too late.

---

### **The CEO Who Trusted the Wrong Expert**

A CFO researched multiple ERP systems before leaving on good terms. The owner hired a CEO who made the ERP decision based on a national brand and a personal bias toward sales.

After rollout, it didn't integrate with operations. The employees in operations hated the software and wouldn't use it.

**What it illustrates:** Savior Thinking at two levels—trusting the CEO to make the call, and trusting the brand to deliver. Neither knew the business well enough to choose wisely.

---

### **3 Years to Fulfill a 6-Month Promise**

A company purchased an industry-specific ERP. The vendor promised a critical feature "in 6 months." Three years later, no sign of it. The vendor signed on more users than their infrastructure could support. Users regularly saw a "spinning throbber of death."

**What it illustrates:** The savior oversold and underdelivered. And once you've committed, you're trapped.

---

## **CLIENT TRANSFORMATION (What's Possible on the Other Side)**

### **The 66% Pricing Discovery**

A client's team had been pricing raw materials off the wrong dimensions—charging only 66% of what they should have been. When we built the visibility to see it, they also discovered they'd been buying overpriced materials.

Two truths, hidden in plain sight. Once they could see, they could act.

**What it illustrates:** Financial truth isn't about blame—it's about sight. You can't fix what you can't see.

---

### **The Warning They Kept Ignoring**

I had a client where I kept raising warnings. Repeatedly. They ignored every one. Eventually, I walked.

Sometimes the hardest truth isn't what the numbers say—it's that people aren't ready to hear it. You can't force someone to face reality. But you also don't have to stay and watch the crash.

**What it illustrates:** Truth-telling has limits. You can offer it. You can't make them take it.

---

### **The Senior Leader Who Was Poisoning the Culture**

A client had a senior, long-tenured team member who was disrupting the culture, undermining leadership, and not carrying the full weight of responsibility. Everyone knew. No one acted.

I helped them name it. Have the conversation. Make the decision.

They went from lying awake, stressed about their situation, to waking up early with vision for their future.

**What it illustrates:** The hard conversation is often the doorway to freedom. What keeps leaders stuck isn't lack of information—it's lack of courage to act on what they already know.

---

## **PARABLES BY CONVICTION (Reference Table)**

## **ORIGIN STORY MOMENTS (The Arc)**

*Note: These are the overarching character arc, distinct from parables.*

### **Moment \#1: The Foundation (Age 8 → Age 14\)**

I started coding at 8 years old. By 14, when my dad's accountant bailed, I convinced him to move from paper to QuickBooks. I learned payroll, taxes, reconciliation—and built my first SOPs so he could run reports without me. I automated sales tax imports. Within a year, I'd trained my replacement.

That's when I learned: systems thinking applies everywhere. Good financial systems give you precision control. Bad ones leave you flying blind.

---

### **Moment \#2: The Calling (The Convergence)**

Working with a $10M+ manufacturer on accounting automation, something clicked. I shared my excitement at a peer group, and one guy got tears in his eyes hearing someone who actually LOVED accounting. I realized I was the "Moneyball guy"—I saw patterns in numbers others missed.

Around the same time, a lunch with my friend Ricky crystallized something else. He asked why YouTube streams well but private sites don't. As I explained it, I realized: everything I'd learned in software engineering—systems thinking, architecture, scalability, iterative building—I'd already been applying to business. How I do one thing is how I do everything.

Manufacturing is where it all converges—systematic, repeatable, precision-driven. Everything I loved came together in helping manufacturers engineer their business systems with the same discipline they engineer their products.

---

### **Moment \#3: The Liberation (Surrendering to Truth)**

I spent years trying to be what everyone told me I should be—sales expert, marketing expert, growth expert. I told Josh Long, an exceptional business consultant, about the work I'd been doing. He told me point blank: "You do know you've been doing the work of a fractional CFO?"

The self-protective ego fell apart. I could finally surrender to being who I actually was rather than all the things I felt pressured to be. I could deliver financial truth for manufacturers—and that was enough. That was everything.

# **Brand Personality**

## **Brand Personality:**

	•	Direct by conviction — says what others won’t, not to provoke but because clarity is the job

	•	Care through clarity, bond through building — hard truths are how trust gets built; relationships are forged in the doing

	•	Systems thinker — sees patterns across domains; connects engineering precision to business reality

	•	Teacher from the trenches — leads with experience, not theory; beside you, not above you

	•	Thinks in 3D — moves between numbers, operations, and people without treating them as separate planes

## **Core Ideas**

	•	Management by numbers — you can only manage what you measure

	•	Systems thinking — the business as interconnected layers, not silos

	•	Facing reality — the courage to stop avoiding uncomfortable truths

	•	Stories as teaching tools — parables from the trenches, not theory

# **Visual Identity**

Minimal. The work, not the lifestyle. Office, desk, shoes, tools of the trade. No flash — substance over performance.

Intellectual Lineage

Drucker. Goldratt. The thinkers who built frameworks from real operations, not abstractions. Ideas that came from the floor, not the ivory tower.

Category (emerging)

Financial reality. Systems thinking. Business engineering.

Not fully resolved yet — letting it sharpen through content. For now: A Fractional CFO who brings systems thinking to manufacturers.

# **Client Criteria**

## **Shared Beliefs My Clients Must Hold**

**1\. The truth is useful, not threatening.** They see hard data and honest feedback as tools, not attacks.

**2\. Change happens when the owner takes ownership of the problem.** They locate responsibility in themselves, not in circumstances, employees, or the market.

**3\. Transformation requires facing uncomfortable truths about yourself and the business.** They’re willing to look at what’s broken — including their own role in it.

**4\. Financial visibility is a strategic asset, not just compliance overhead.** They want insight to make better decisions, not just clean books for the bank.

**5\. Treating people well is good business, not just nice ethics.** They lead without tyranny and see team health as connected to company health.

**6\. Work serves life — it doesn’t consume it.** Family, health, and rest aren’t obstacles to success. Overwork isn’t a virtue.

---

## **What My Clients Must Be Willing To Do**

**1\. Open the books — fully.** Give me complete access to financials, not curated summaries. No hidden accounts, no “we’ll get to that later.”

**2\. Have the hard conversations.** Discuss uncomfortable realities with me, with their team, with themselves. Not deflect, minimize, or delay.

**3\. Implement what surfaces — not just discuss it.** Act on insights. My work produces clarity; they have to do something with it. No endless “let me think about it.”

**4\. Give me strategic permission, not just task lists.** Let me diagnose and prescribe, not just execute their pre-decided solutions. Trust my expertise enough to be influenced by it.

**5\. Stay in the room when it gets uncomfortable.** Not ghost, not fire me for telling the truth, not retreat into defensiveness when the data reveals something they don’t like.

---

## **What My Clients Must Already Have In Place**

**1\. Revenue that supports the investment.** Typically 

10M–

50M, but the real test is: can they afford the engagement without strain, and is there enough operational complexity that my work produces clear ROI?

**2\. Existing momentum.** The business is already moving — selling, producing, operating. I’m not building from zero; I’m aligning what’s already in motion.

**3\. A real leadership seat for me to occupy.** They have (or will create) the structural space for a strategic finance role. I’m not wedging myself into a bookkeeper slot or fighting for relevance.

**4\. Some financial infrastructure, even if broken.** Books exist. Reports exist. Data exists — even if messy or misleading. I need raw material to work with.

**5\. Cash to invest in the engagement.** Not theoretical future money. Actual liquidity to fund the work without it feeling like a crisis.

---

## **What Would Disqualify Them**

**1\. Victim mindset.** They blame the market, employees, circumstances — anyone but themselves. “Rescue cases” who want me to save them from problems they won’t own.

**2\. Controlling or rigid leadership.** “My way or the highway.” They’ve already decided what they want and just need hands to execute it. No room for my diagnosis or strategic input.

**3\. Condescension or arrogance.** They look down their nose at me, dismiss my expertise, or treat me as a subordinate rather than a peer.

**4\. Price-shopping or scarcity mindset.** They haggle on every dollar, treat fees as costs to minimize, or are white-knuckled about cash in a way that poisons the engagement.

**5\. Emotional immaturity or toxicity.** Narcissism, manipulation, inability to handle feedback. The leader’s dysfunction is the real problem, but they won’t see it.

**6\. Wanting tactics without transformation.** They want hacks, templates, quick fixes — not the deeper work of actually changing how the business operates.

**7\. Unwillingness to act.** They ask for advice but never implement. Endless discussion, no movement. They want to feel productive without doing the work.

**8\. Disrespect for boundaries.** They expect 24/7 availability, push past stated limits, or treat my time as infinitely flexible. If I say “I don’t work weekends” or “I need 48 hours,” that’s not a negotiation.

# **Beginner Content Themes**

## **Internal Organizing Frame**

**Separation vs. Integration**

Everything flows from this single tension. All dichotomies are expressions of it in different domains.

This is your internal compass—the lens you think through—not necessarily language for posts. But it explains why you see what you see:

* Feature/task thinking \= **separated** (each tool, each piece in isolation)  
* System design thinking \= **integrated** (how pieces connect, what's the whole)

Your Intellectual Authority reframe ("it's not a tools problem, it's a design problem") is really saying: *You're thinking in separated pieces when you need integrated design.*

## **1\. Strong POVs (Brand Enemies \+ Tensions)**

### **How Separation Shows Up in Relating to Others**

| Separation | Integration |
| ----- | ----- |
| Ego | Union |
| Competition | Being Yourself |
| Enemy Mode | Relational Mode |
| Answer Guy Trap | Walking With |
| Ambition at All Costs | Rest in Disciplined Execution |

### **How Separation Shows Up in Thinking**

| Separation | Integration |
| ----- | ----- |
| Linear-only | Linear \+ Holistic |
| Logic-only | Logic \+ Emotion |
| Facts-only | Facts \+ Experience |

### **How Separation Shows Up in Building**

| Separation | Integration |
| ----- | ----- |
| Function-only | Function \+ Expression |
| Profit-only | Profit \+ Well-Designed |

### **Brand Enemies (Your Six)**

These are your strongest POVs—ready-made content pillars:

1. **Savior Thinking** — The belief that software, a hire, or a vendor will rescue you  
2. **Truth Avoidance Culture** — Managing around uncomfortable truths instead of facing them  
3. **Armchair Sherpas** — Advisors who analyze, recommend, and leave without skin in the game  
4. **Enemy Mode Leadership** — Disconnecting from people to pursue results  
5. **Systems as Masters** — Tool worship that replaces human judgment  
6. **"Whatever Gets the Job Done"** — Purely functional thinking that misses patterns and meaning

## **2\. Personal Insights (Stories & Lessons)**

| Story | Surface Lesson | Deeper Principle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Software Engineering Days | Systems thinking. Focus on how things are organized. Diagnose and troubleshoot. | *The engineering lens applies to everything—not just code.* |
| Client Manipulation | I don't tolerate hidden agendas. Open communication matters. I'll walk away. | *Truth is non-negotiable. Relationships require openness.* |
| Co-Architect ERP | Start with the biggest value piece, then dial it in. Source of truth \+ full traceability. | *Find the constraint first. Build from there.* |
| QuickBooks with Dad (Age 14\) | SOPs can end phone call interruptions. | *Systems create freedom. What you build can give others their time back.* |
| Design Business | How to prioritize ROI. | *Not everything matters equally. Find what moves the needle.* |
| My Own Business (highs/lows) | The value of good management. | *You can't outsource ownership of your own business.* |
| Desert Season / Losing Gigs | Embrace truth no matter where it leads. Find truth-tellers and don't let go. | *When the conventional playbook fails, you have to find your own way.* |

**Note:** When turning these into content, connect the specific story to the broader principle. The story is the hook; the principle is what people take away.

## **3\. Trainings/Teaching (Frameworks & Principles)**

### **Core Frameworks**

**Prioritization Process (Deciding WHAT to work on)**

1. Step back  
2. Look at the big picture  
3. What is the constraint?  
4. What part will give the biggest ROI (including effort)?  
5. Rinse and repeat

**Adaptive Engineering Cycle (HOW to execute)**

1. **ASSESS** — Find where it's actually broken (find the constraint)  
2. **BUILD** — Engineer the fix  
3. **DEPLOY** — Get it working in their hands  
4. **PROVE** — Real results before moving on  
5. **REPEAT** — Next constraint

### **Supporting Principles**

* **Napoleon Rule** — Let problems sit; many resolve themselves without intervention  
* **Business Profiling** — Software profiling applied to business (finding bottlenecks)  
* **Moving the Constraint** — Reframing "it's not working" as "you've successfully moved the bottleneck"  
* **The 4-Question Diagnostic** — What's not working? What is happening? What should be happening? Why do you think it's happening?

### **Developed Concepts**

**Linear vs. Radial Prioritization**

Gravity speaks to us about priority. We've been told that priorities live in lists and checklists. It's not true. Priorities are radial, not linear. Only a few things matter. And the things nearest those things matter more than anything you can put on a list. Just like gravity. Proximity matters.

The reframe: *Priority isn't position on a list. It's proximity to the center.*

This connects to "What actually moves the needle." Most people make lists. You find the center of gravity and work outward from there.

*→ Connects to: Methodological Authority (how you prioritize, part of Business Engineering)*

---

**Answer Guy Trap**

The belief that there's a perpetual motion machine—if you just have the right answers, systems, frameworks, everything runs forever.

| Answer Guy | Walking With |
| ----- | ----- |
| Creates dependency | Builds capacity |
| Solves, fixes, answers | Accompanies through |
| Pretends certainty | Embraces "I don't know" |
| Perpetual motion until breakdown | Sustainable presence |

The answer guy creates dependency—people need you for the next answer, the next solution. You become their perpetual motion machine until you break down.

**The Alternative:** "What I commit to you is walking with you through whatever comes." Not solving, not fixing, not having the perfect framework. Just walking alongside.

**Your line:** *"We're so afraid of being wrong that we pretend we can't be."*

*→ Connects to: Visionary Authority (fighting against consultants who create dependency instead of building capacity)*

Linear vs. Holistic Thinking

Linear Thinkers:

	•	Approach problems step by step, methodically

	•	Brilliant at making sure things actually work

	•	Handle edge cases, details, nothing breaks under pressure

	•	Ask: “What are the next steps we need to take?”

	•	Excel at: operational excellence, process improvement, getting things completed

	•	Weakness: can create technical debt, execute the wrong strategy efficiently

Holistic Thinkers:

	•	See patterns and relationships everywhere

	•	Quickly understand how pieces fit together

	•	Their work has elegance, cohesion

	•	Ask: “How does this connect or relate to everything else?”

	•	Excel at: strategy, design, keeping orgs from busy work that doesn’t serve the mission

	•	Weakness: can redesign endlessly without shipping, miss crucial details

The Insight:

	•	Each type has a corresponding weakness

	•	When paired together, magic happens—they cover each other’s blind spots

	•	Most organizations unconsciously favor one over the other

	•	You need both perspectives, often in the same conversation

Your Teaching:

	•	If you’re buried in tactical details → find a holistic thinker

	•	If you’re struggling to turn ideas into progress → partner with a linear thinker

→ Connects to: Separation vs. Integration (Linear-only is separated thinking; Linear \+ Holistic together is integration)

# **Authority Angles**

## **The Three Pillars**

### **Pillar 1: Methodological Authority — Business Engineering**

**Internal definition (for you):**  
Business Engineering is applying systems design thinking to how a company actually runs—building the structure, visibility, and priorities that let you run by truth instead of guess.

**External definition (for others):**  
Business Engineering is designing the layer that most businesses are missing—the structure underneath the tools, the visibility into what’s actually happening, and commitment to what moves the needle.

**The three layers:**

1. What’s the underlying structure of your toolset  
2. What happens in the day-to-day  
3. What actually moves the needle

### **Pillar 2: Intellectual Authority — The Problem Reframe**

**What they think:** The problem is their tools. Wrong software, missing features, people not using it right. They need better tools or better syncing between tools.

**What you see:** No one ever designed the system. They’re bolting tools together, syncing data between them, hoping it produces clarity. But syncing broken pieces just gives you synchronized brokenness.

**The reframe:** You don’t have a software problem. You have a system design problem.

**What they’re missing:**

* The underlying structure of the toolset  
* What actually happens day-to-day (not the process doc—the reality)  
* Commitment to what moves the needle

Most people—vendors, consultants, internal teams—think in features and tasks. You think in system design.

---

### **Pillar 3: Visionary Authority — The New Paradigm**

**The old way:** Buying tools and hoping they produce clarity. Feature thinking. Bolting things together without architecture. Flying blind—not because you want to, but because no one built the design layer.

**The new way:** Systems that give you real visibility, and the leadership capacity to stand in the face of what you see.

**The vision:** Visibility is the beginning. The real work is building the capacity to face what it reveals.

**Fighting for:** Manufacturers who run by truth instead of guess—and have the backbone to act on it.

---

## **Integration**

**The throughline:** Design → Visibility → Capacity to act on truth

| Pillar | What it says | Angle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Methodological | Business Engineering—structure, visibility, commitment | The HOW (what you build) |
| Intellectual | It’s not a tools problem, it’s a design problem | The WHAT (what you see that others miss) |
| Visionary | Visibility is the beginning; capacity to face it is the real work | The WHERE (where it leads) |

All three pillars point at the same core idea: manufacturers need someone to design the layer that gives them visibility, and then the backbone to actually face what it shows them.

---

## **Content Test**

All content should tie back to one of these three:

* Post about a client who finally got reporting working → **Methodological** (structure)  
* Post about why ERPs fail → **Intellectual** (design problem, not tool problem)  
* Post about a hard conversation with a client about what the numbers revealed → **Visionary** (capacity to face truth)  
* Post calling out Savior Thinking → **Intellectual** (buying tools to avoid the design work)

---

## **Parking Lot**

**Unconscious competence:** Reading people, understanding what makes them tick. Shows up in helping clients build capacity to face truth—not just building systems, but building leaders who can stand in what the systems reveal. Not sold directly. Delivered through the work.

This is the “hidden curriculum”—they buy the system, they get the leadership growth as a byproduct. It explains why *you*specifically, not just “a fractional CFO.”

# **Week 6: Messaging with Precision**

## **Positioning Lead**

**Lead with:** Fractional CFO for manufacturers

**Differentiator:** You design and build what’s needed (not just advise)

**Outcome:** They stop flying blind

Clients don’t care about your methodology. They care that the problem gets solved. The building is just *how* you deliver what other CFOs can’t.

---

## **Top 3 Messaging Mistakes (Self-Audit)**

### **Mistake 1: Speaking to the problem YOU know, not the symptoms THEY experience**

**Parmee says:** Don’t use “coach speak” or fluffy terms. Meet them where they are.

**Your risk:** “System design problem” is YOUR language. “Flying blind” is closer to theirs—but their actual words are things like:

* “We need to replace these Excel sheets”  
* “We need better pricing”  
* “Business is chaotic”  
* “We’re not getting everything out of our production team”

**Action:** Lead with their symptoms. Introduce your reframe after you’ve earned the right.

### **Mistake 2: Speaking to the wrong level of awareness**

**Parmee says:** They may not know what you solve is what they need.

**Your situation:** Your best clients aren’t avoiding data—they genuinely want visibility but can’t get it. They’ve tried (software, consultants, hires) and failed. They’re aware they have a problem. They’re just not aware it’s a *design* problem, not a *tool* problem.

**Action:** Validate their experience first (“You’ve tried. It didn’t work.”), then reframe what’s actually broken.

### **Mistake 3: Focusing on WHAT you do, not the transformation**

**Parmee says:** Paint the before/after. The mechanism matters less than the outcome.

**Your risk:** Getting too deep into Business Engineering, the Adaptive Engineering Cycle, or technical details before they care.

**Action:** Lead with the transformation: “Stop flying blind. Know what’s actually profitable. Decide from clarity.”

## **6 Ingredients of Effective Messaging (Self-Audit Tool)**

Use this to audit your content:

| Ingredient | Question to Ask | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Relevance** | In 3 seconds, can they tell this is for them? | Lead with manufacturer language, operational symptoms |
| **Specificity** | Do you vividly describe what they’re going through? | Use their words: “Excel hell,” “can’t get reports,” “pricing feels like guessing” |
| **Tangibility** | Can they picture the concrete outcomes? | “Know what’s profitable,” “stop leaving money on the table,” “sleep at night” |
| **Emotional Connection** | Do they feel seen, heard, held? | Your parables, your origin story, your “I’ve been in the valley” credibility |
| **Shared Values** | Do you have common ground? | Truth is useful, not threatening. Precision matters. No saviors. |
| **Trust** | Repeated exposure to your knowledge/insight? | Content that demonstrates your thinking—not just your services |

---

## **The Core Insight**

Every “want” your clients express points to the same root problem:

**They can’t see what’s actually happening.**

* Can’t see where time goes → waste  
* Can’t see production reality → underperformance  
* Can’t see true costs → wrong pricing  
* Can’t see profitability → bad decisions

“Flying blind” isn’t just a metaphor. It’s the literal diagnosis.

---

## **Want → Need → Desire (Language Bank)**

This is your messaging fuel. Use their words (Want), connect to what you actually do (Need), paint the outcome (Desire).

### **Row 1: Reporting / Excel Hell**

| Want (their words) | Need (what has to happen) | Desire (the result) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “Replace these Excel sheets” / “Get better reporting” | The structural layer designed and built—connecting tools, capturing what matters | Know what’s actually profitable. Decide from clarity, not gut. |

### **Row 2: Chaos / Inherited Mess**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “Organize the business” / “Clean up after prior ownership” | Someone to see the whole picture, find where it’s broken, and fix it | Stop feeling like everything is chaos. Have a business that runs, not one that runs you. |

### **Row 3: Wasted Time / Operational Efficiency**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “Our employees are wasting too much time” / “We need operational efficiency” | Visibility into where time actually goes—tracked, not guessed | Stop bleeding hours. Know where the waste is so you can fix it. |

### **Row 4: Production Tracking / Underperformance**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “We’re not getting everything out of our production team” / “We want to track what they’re doing” | A system that captures production reality and connects it to profitability | See what’s actually happening on the floor—and know what it’s costing you. |

### **Row 5: Pricing Confidence**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “We don’t know how to price” / “We need better pricing” | Visibility into true costs at the product level—materials, labor, overhead | Price with confidence. Stop leaving money on the table (or worse, losing it). |

### **Row 6: Excel Limitations**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “Excel is too complicated” / “We’ve hit the limit of what Excel can do” / “Our Excel guy left” / “The vendor is AWOL” | A real system that doesn’t depend on one person’s spreadsheet wizardry or a vendor who won’t return calls | Something that actually works—that you control, that scales, that doesn’t break when someone leaves. |

### **Row 7: ERP Hell**

| Want | Need | Desire |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| “We need a new ERP” / “Our software doesn’t work” / “Issues coming in faster than they’re resolved” / “The vendor won’t call us back” | Start strategic, not tactical. Clarify what you actually need before buying the next tool. | Escape ERP hell. Software that thinks like you think. A system your employees actually want to use. |

**Client language from ERP hell:**

* “Mediocre at best and has a lot of glitches”  
* “Looks user friendly, but when you start working in it, it’s not”  
* “The spinning throbber of death”  
* Features promised “in 6 months” that never came  
* Integrations that don’t work  
* Customizations incomplete or broken

---

## **Core Message Options**

**Symptom-first (their language):**

“You’ve bought the software. You’ve hired the people. You’ve worked with consultants. And you still can’t get the visibility you need. The problem isn’t your tools—it’s that no one designed the layer underneath them.”

**Outcome-first:**

“You can’t fix what you can’t see. I build the visibility layer so you can.”

**Reframe-first:**

“You don’t have a software problem. You have a system design problem.”

**Transformation-first:**

“Stop flying blind. Know what’s actually profitable. Decide from clarity instead of chaos.”

---

## **Connection to Authority Angles**

| Their Want | Your Reframe (Intellectual) | Your Method (Methodological) | The Outcome (Visionary) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Better tools, better reporting | It’s not a tools problem—it’s a design problem | Business Engineering: structure, visibility, commitment | Visibility is the beginning. Capacity to face what it reveals is the real work. |

---

## **Client Language to Use**

**Their words (use these):**

* “Excel hell”  
* “Can’t get the reports I need”  
* “Business is chaotic”  
* “Cleaning up after prior ownership”  
* “Employees wasting time”  
* “Not getting what we should out of production”  
* “Don’t know how to price”  
* “The software doesn’t do what we need”  
* “Our Excel guy left”  
* “The vendor won’t call us back”  
* “Issues coming in faster than they’re resolved”  
* “It looked user friendly, but when you start working in it, it’s not”  
* “We’ve hit the limit of what Excel can do”

**Your words (introduce after earning the right):**

* “Flying blind”  
* “The design layer”  
* “System design problem”  
* “Structure, visibility, commitment”  
* “You can’t fix what you can’t see”  
* “Start strategic, not tactical”

# **UNUSED NOTES:**

Piece 2: THE BELIEF MAPPING (Belongs... Somewhere Else). The paired beliefs that show HOW truth avoidance / truth seeking plays out:

| Truth Avoidance (Symptom) | Truth Seeking (Expression) |
| ----- | ----- |
| "As long as we're profitable overall, we're fine" | Know exactly which products/customers are profitable |
| "You have to accept some level of flying blind" | Engineer systems that reveal what matters |
| "Avoiding hard conversations protects relationships" | Hard conversations are the foundation for healthy change |
| "Advisors tell you what's wrong; you fix it" | Execution, not just advice |
| "Software alone will solve our problems" | People \+ systems \+ courage together |
| "It's the team's fault / software's fault" (scapegoating) | Own the truth \- stop passing the buck |

# **Session 1: Profit Mapping — Working Notes**

## **Session 0 Reflection: What Brought Me Here**

**What brought me to this program:**

* Feeling stuck moving forward  
* Parmee has one of the most sane approaches to branding & content I've found  
* The insanely low price put me over the edge

**What this reveals about my own buyers:**

* They come feeling *stuck* — not always with a specific problem, but a felt sense of being blocked  
* They're filtering for someone who feels grounded, not hype-driven (rejecting Savior Thinking and Armchair Sherpas)  
* Trust was already building; price just removed the final barrier

---

## **Exercise 1: Identify Your Disconnects**

**1\) Building what YOU want, not what buyers want**

* Historically showed up with me writing about whatever was on my mind  
* I don't actually know if what I offer is what they're searching for

**2\) Positioning with too broad a scope/promise**

* Possible — may need to make it more tangible

**3\) Not adding context around pains/frustrations**

* Have good client language documented but not actively using it yet  
* Things are on pause at the moment

**4\) Trying to capture everyone instead of someone**

* Don't know for sure what the exact triggering moment is

**5\) Not mapping expertise ↔ market need**

* Not yet — that's why I'm here

---

## **Exercise 2, Part A: Your Expertise**

### **What I actually DO (gut answer):**

* Build custom databases and reports  
* Build projections and pricing models

### **Outcomes I've reliably delivered:**

* Product-level pricing visibility  
* Employee performance visibility  
* Accurate and current accounting

### **What I can do that most fractional CFOs can't or won't:**

* Literally build the reports and get data from other systems

### **From the Brand Document:**

* "Most consultants analyze, recommend, and leave. I assess, build, deploy, and prove results before moving on."  
* Co-architected fully custom ERPs, built solutions across 12+ industries  
* Automated data flows, validation rules, real-time financial visibility

### **The Hidden Curriculum:**

* Unconscious competence around people and what makes them tick  
* Clients say I project courage  
* Known for technical ability BUT also for truth-telling and hard conversations  
* **They come for the systems. They stay for the truth-telling.**  
* This is "not sold directly — delivered through the work"

---

## **Exercise 2, Part B: Market Demand (Research Findings)**

### **Exercise 4: Conversations Lens — Real Language from Real People**

**Sources:** Merv, Hostetler, and others

**Actual phrases heard:**

* Excel/spreadsheet problems  
* "Disorganized"  
* "Some of the guys are slow" (production performance)  
* "I can't talk to the guy who made my spreadsheets" (single point of failure)  
* "Ran out of Excel capacity"

**The pattern:** These are visibility and control problems disguised as tool problems. They think the issue is Excel or "the guys" — I know it's a system design problem.

**The honest gap:** I've built my business through relationships and referrals, not through content or search. So I've never needed to know how strangers talk about these problems.

---

### **Exercise 5: Search Lens — What They're Actually Googling**

**ERP-related searches are huge:**

* "Manufacturing ERP implementation"  
* "ERP implementation problems/challenges/failures"  
* Key stat: 55-75% of ERP implementations fail to meet their objectives

**Job costing / pricing:**

* "Job costing manufacturing"  
* "How to get accurate job costing"  
* "Pricing for profitability"

**QuickBooks limitations:**

* "QuickBooks not enough for manufacturing"  
* "Outgrowing QuickBooks"  
* Forum posts like: "I am starting to get very frustrated. I CANNOT FIND ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO USE QUICKBOOKS ONCE IT IS SET UP."

**Language from forums and articles:**

* "Can't see which jobs are profitable"  
* "Spending too much time in spreadsheets"  
* "Staff synchronizing inventory manually"  
* "Different departments using different information"  
* "Numbers don't match up"  
* "No real-time visibility"  
* "The vendor won't call us back"  
* "Issues coming in faster than they're resolved"

### **Key Insight: The Tool vs. Design Gap**

**They're searching for TOOLS (ERP, software, QuickBooks alternatives) — not for PEOPLE (fractional CFO, consultant).**

* They're not typing "I need a fractional CFO"  
* They're typing "why is my ERP failing" or "QuickBooks not working for manufacturing"

**The Intellectual Authority Reframe:**

* What they search for: "ERP implementation problems" / "QuickBooks not enough"  
* What they think: The tool is broken. I need a better tool.  
* What I see: No one designed the system. They're bolting tools together, hoping it produces clarity.  
* My reframe: You don't have a software problem. You have a system design problem.

**Content strategy implication:** Lead with their problem (the search term), then bridge to my solution (me).

---

### **Exercise 6: Purchase Lens — What They're Already Buying**

| They Buy | What They're Hoping For |
| ----- | ----- |
| ERPs / Software | "This tool will finally give us visibility" |
| ERP implementation consultants | "These experts will make the tool work" |
| IT consultants / vendors | "Someone technical will fix the integration" |
| Controllers / bookkeepers | "Clean books \= clarity" |
| Full-time CFO (if they can afford it) | "A senior finance person will figure it out" |
| "Excel guy" (internal) | "Someone to make the spreadsheets work" |
| Peer groups (Vistage, EO) | Referrals, advice, "who do you use?" |

**What this reveals:**

1. **They're buying tools and tool-implementers** — but nobody is designing the layer underneath. The ERP consultant knows the ERP. The IT guy knows integrations. The bookkeeper knows debits and credits. But nobody owns the *whole system design*.

2. **They're buying narrow specialists or expensive generalists.** A controller is too narrow (compliance, not strategy). A full-time CFO is too expensive. They don't know there's a middle option.

3. **They're stuck in the Savior Thinking loop.** Buy tool → tool doesn't work → blame tool → buy next tool.

4. **"Fractional CFO" isn't on their radar** — because they don't know that's the category.

**The gap I fill:**

* See the *design* problem (not just the tool)  
* Actually *build* the infrastructure (not just advise)  
* Cost a fraction of a full-time CFO  
* Stay until it works (not analyze-and-leave)

**But they don't know to search for me.** Content must intercept them where they're already spending — ERP frustration, QuickBooks limitations, job costing pain — and reframe toward design.

---

## **Exercise 7: The 7 Core Drivers of Change**

**Ranked by relevance to my ideal clients:**

| Rank | Driver | The Feeling |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | Overwhelm/confusion | "Data everywhere, clarity nowhere" |
| 2 | Feeling stuck | "We've tried everything, nothing works" |
| 3 | Physical/emotional discomfort | The stress of not knowing, sleepless nights |
| 4 | Lack of confidence | "I don't trust my numbers" |

**Key insight: The spouse feels it first.**

The owner normalizes the chaos. They numb out. They cope by working harder. But the spouse sees:

* The stress they bring home  
* The sleepless nights  
* The distraction at dinner  
* The weight they're carrying

The owner might not name it. The spouse *feels* it.

**Connection to Brand Enemy: Reality Avoidance Culture** They're not avoiding the numbers because they don't care — they're avoiding because facing it feels worse than carrying it. Until it doesn't. Until the spouse says something. Until the body breaks down.

**Possible trigger moments (Context):**

* Spouse finally says "something has to change"  
* Health scare  
* Key employee quits  
* Near-miss with a big customer

**The hidden curriculum connection:** They buy the system — but what they get is permission to finally face it.

---

## **Summary: The Profit Mapping Triangle So Far**

**A. Expertise:**

* Build custom databases, reports, projections, pricing models  
* Design and implement the infrastructure layer other fractional CFOs only advise on  
* Hidden curriculum: truth-telling, courage, walking with them through hard conversations

**B. Demand:**

* They search for tools (ERP, QuickBooks, job costing software)  
* They don't search for people (fractional CFO)  
* They're buying tools and tool-implementers, stuck in Savior Thinking loop  
* Real need: system design, not another tool

**C. Context (still developing):**

* Trigger moments unclear — possibly spouse pressure, failed implementations, key employee leaving, health/stress breaking point  
* Emotional state: stuck, overwhelmed, stressed (often not named by owner, felt by spouse)

# **Session 1: Profit Mapping — Working Notes (Part 2\)**

## **Exercise 8-11: Zone of Applicability (Your Profit Pocket)**

### **The Formula:**

"My work helps \[person\] who are at the point where \[trigger moment\], to \[specific outcome\]."

### **Exercise 8: Outcome I Deliver Consistently**

They stop flying blind. They can see what's actually profitable — by product, by customer, by job — and make decisions from clarity instead of gut.

### **Exercise 9-11: Trigger Moments Identified**

**Primary triggers:**

* The Excel guy quit (fragility exposed — single point of failure)  
* The ERP implementation failed (the tool didn't save them)  
* They realized they're losing money on a large batch of orders every month (painful discovery)

**Other possible triggers:**

* The vendor stopped returning calls  
* They lost money on a "profitable" job and didn't see it coming  
* A key employee or customer left and exposed a blind spot  
* The spouse finally said "something has to change"  
* They tried to get a report and realized nobody could produce it

### **Zone of Applicability Statement (Final):**

"My work helps manufacturers who are at the point where their Excel guy quit, their ERP implementation failed, or they've just realized they're losing money on a large batch of orders every single month — so they can finally see profitability by product and customer, and make financial decisions from clarity not guesswork."

---

## **Exercise 12-13: Reframing from Nice-to-Have → Need-to-Have**

### **Exercise 12: The Three Levels**

**A. Aspirational Desire (Nice-to-have):**

* "Run the business with the same precision we engineer our products"  
* "Have real-time financial visibility"  
* "Be a well-oiled machine"

*This is true — but it's not urgent. Nobody buys "someday."*

**B. Active Desire (They're thinking about it now):**

* "We need a better ERP"  
* "We need to replace these spreadsheets"  
* "We need better job costing"  
* "We need to track production performance"

*This is where they're searching. They're in motion — but pointed at tools.*

**C. Most Pressing Problem (Need-to-have):**

* "We're losing money on jobs and don't know which ones"  
* "Our Excel guy quit and nobody knows how anything works"  
* "The ERP failed and we're worse off than before"  
* "I can't tell if we're actually profitable"

*This is where the pain is real. This is "need to have."*

### **Exercise 13: Reframed Positioning**

**Old positioning (from Brand Essence Doc):**

"I'm a Fractional CFO for manufacturers who value excellence and need financial clarity to scale confidently. I specialize in financial systems and visibility. I build the financial infrastructure that reveals profitability truth..."

*This is aspirational. It leads with what YOU do and who YOU are.*

**New, demand-aligned positioning:**

"If you've tried getting profitability visibility from your software, your spreadsheets, or your bookkeeper — and it's still not working — the problem isn't the tools. It's that no one designed the system underneath. I build that layer — so you can finally see what's profitable and make decisions from clarity, not guesswork."

---

## **Exercise 14-17: Demand-Mirroring Messaging**

### **Exercise 14: Mirror Their Beliefs**

*What do they currently believe about their problem?*

* "We need better software"  
* "Our ERP just needs to be configured right"  
* "If we could just find the right person to manage the spreadsheets..."  
* "Our bookkeeper/controller should be able to figure this out"

### **Exercise 15: Mirror Their Fears \+ Emotional State**

*What consequences do they fear? What are they feeling?*

**Their emotional state isn't primarily fear. It's:**

* **Determination** — "We're going to figure this out"  
* **Frustration** — "We've tried things and they haven't worked"  
* **Uncertainty** — "Will my people come on board?" / "Can we actually change?"  
* **Underlying financial anxiety** — not always rational, but it's there

**The fears that do exist:**

* Staying awake at night — not about "what's missing" but about the weight of the team, the decisions, the responsibility  
* Looking like a fool with the endeavors they take on (ERP, new hire, consultant)  
* Being left behind in the modern era  
* Competition overtaking them  
* Team not buying in  
* General financial anxiety

**Key insight:** The owner is in determination/frustration mode — head down, pushing through. The spouse (or the body, or the 2am thoughts) is where the fear lives. The owner might not admit to fear. But they'll admit to frustration.

### **Exercise 16: Mirror Their Desires**

*What results do they desperately want?*

* Know my numbers are right  
* See what's actually profitable  
* Stop guessing  
* Make decisions and know they're the right ones  
* A business that's well run, well organized, and runs without them  
* Not be left behind — be modern, capable, competitive  
* Team aligned and rowing in the same direction  
* Stop carrying this alone

### **Exercise 17: Demand-Mirroring Message (First Draft)**

You've tried the software. You've built the spreadsheets. You've hired people who were supposed to figure this out. And you still can't see what's actually profitable.

You're not behind. You've just been solving the wrong problem.

Everyone keeps selling you tools. But tools don't give you answers — they give you data. And right now, your data is scattered across systems that don't talk to each other, spreadsheets that only one person understands, and reports you're not sure you can trust.

You want a business that's well run and doesn't depend on you for everything. But right now you can't even see what's happening clearly. And some nights you lie awake carrying the weight of it — the team, the decisions, the responsibility that's all on you.

The fix isn't another tool. It's finally building the system that connects everything — so you can see what's working, what's not, and make decisions from clarity instead of guesswork.

**To test:**

* Read to a past client or two — see if they nod or look confused  
* Pay attention to which lines they repeat back — that's the language that lands  
* Notice if "the system that connects everything" makes sense or needs to be more concrete

---

## **Session 1 Summary: The Complete Profit Pocket**

**Expertise (What I do):**

* Build custom databases, reports, projections, pricing models  
* Design and implement the infrastructure layer other fractional CFOs only advise on  
* Hidden curriculum: truth-telling, courage, walking with them through hard conversations

**Demand (What they search for):**

* Tools: ERP, QuickBooks, job costing software  
* Not people: They don't know to search for "fractional CFO"  
* The reframe: It's not a tools problem — it's a system design problem

**Context (Trigger moments):**

* Excel guy quit  
* ERP implementation failed  
* Realized they're losing money on large batch orders  
* (Possibly) Spouse pressure, health/stress breaking point

**Zone of Applicability:**

"My work helps manufacturers who are at the point where their Excel guy quit, their ERP implementation failed, or they've just realized they're losing money on a large batch of orders every single month — so they can finally see profitability by product and customer, and make financial decisions from clarity not guesswork."

**Demand-Aligned Positioning:**

"If you've tried getting profitability visibility from your software, your spreadsheets, or your bookkeeper — and it's still not working — the problem isn't the tools. It's that no one designed the system underneath. I build that layer — so you can finally see what's profitable and make decisions from clarity, not guesswork."

# **Session 2: The Psychology of Brand Positioning**

## **From Informative to Insightful Training — Working Notes**

---

## **SECTION 1: The Perception Principle**

### **Exercise 1: Emotional vs. Logical Rewrite**

**Logical description:** "I help manufacturers build financial systems."

**Emotional rewrite:** "I help manufacturers stop feeling overwhelmed and flying blind — and finally feel confident, grounded, and clear."

---

### **Exercise 2: Brand Perception Snapshot**

**1\. Current perception:** "Noticeably absent" — starting closer to zero than negative. No wrong perception to undo.

**2\. Desired perception:** "The guy who actually builds financial systems for manufacturers" (technical \+ financial \+ execution)

**3\. Emotional reaction:**

* What YOU project: Incisive, clear, true  
* What THEY feel: Confident, empowered, aligned, trust

---

### **Exercise 3: Value Ladder**

**Functional value (what you literally deliver):**

* Software systems  
* Financial reports  
* Financial cadences  
* Accountability systems  
* Profitability visibility by product/customer

**Emotional value (how they feel after):**

* Confident  
* Courageous  
* Clear

**Identity value (who they become):** From "business running on hustle, gut feel, and duct tape" → "a real business with real systems that actually knows what's happening"

*Key insight: The system is the excuse to grow up. They hire you saying "I need to see my numbers." But when you build the system and they can finally see reality — that's when they step into being a real business.*

---

## **SECTION 2: The Psychology of Positioning (8 Principles)**

### **Exercise 4: Cognitive Fluency — 10-Second Brand Test**

"I'm a fractional CFO who builds financial systems for manufacturers — so they can finally see what's actually profitable."

---

### **Exercise 5: Relevance Heuristic — 3 Relevance Anchors**

1. **Frustrated by:** Software that doesn't give them answers, spreadsheets only one person understands, not knowing which products or customers are actually profitable.

2. **Deeply desire:** Clear visibility into what's driving profitability and where to focus when things aren't working.

3. **Secretly worry:** Being exposed as not the leader others perceive them to be — running a business on gut feel and duct tape, hoping no one notices.

---

### **Exercise 6: Association Building — Three Brand Associations**

"When people think of me, I want them to think of:"

1. **The truth teller** — kind but direct  
2. **The doer** — do what matters, stay until it works  
3. **The systems guy** — rigorous but human

### **Exercise 7: Mere Exposure Effect — Sustainable Cadence**

* 3 short-form posts/week (visibility, relevance, quick wins)  
* 1 long-form piece/month (intellectual authority, SEO, intercepts tool searches)  
* 1 newsletter/week (repurposed content \+ light commentary)

*Principle: Consistency \> intensity*

---

### **Exercise 8: Psychological Consistency — Recognition Pattern**

"My consistent brand cue is **the reframe** — showing you what's actually going on underneath the surface problem so you can finally fix it."

**Brand promise (related):**

"You showed me what was actually going on — and now I can do something about it."

*The recognition pattern shows up in content. The brand promise is what they say after working with you.*

### **Exercise 11: Category Positioning — Define Your Category**

"I want to be the go-to person for **financial systems for manufacturers**."

*Per Parmee: The category is the expertise lane — the box they put you in. Outcomes (clarity, profitability visibility) show up in messaging, but the category is the space you dominate.*

## **KEY THEMES EMERGING**

**The Reframe (Intellectual Authority):**

* They think: tool problem (ERP, software, spreadsheets)  
* You see: system design problem  
* Your reframe: "Here's what's actually going on underneath"

**The Identity Shift:**

* Before: Running on hustle, gut feel, duct tape  
* After: A real business with real systems  
* Secret fear: Being exposed as not the leader they're supposed to be

**The Hidden Curriculum:**

* They buy: the system  
* They get: permission to face reality \+ courage to act on it

**Your Differentiator:**

# **Session 2 Additions for Brand Essence Document**

*Add the following content to the end of the Session 2 section in the Brand Essence doc*

---

## **SECTION 3: Building Your Inner Brand Identity**

### **Part 1: Category (completed in Section 2\)**

"I want to be the go-to person for **financial systems for manufacturers**."

---

### **Part 2: Mission & Paradigm Shift**

**Old paradigm:** "People believe if they just get the right software or the right hire, they'll finally understand what's profitable and how to grow."

**New paradigm:** "Software gives you data. It doesn't give you answers. Someone has to build the layer that turns data into clarity."

**Shift:** "I help them go from drowning in data → to knowing what's actually profitable."

---

### **Part 3: Core Message & Authority Angles**

**Core Message:**

"Numbers will tell you where to look — if you're willing."

**Authority Angles:**

1. **Why ERPs and spreadsheets fail** (and what to do instead)  
2. **Accounting beyond the books** — using metrics to see what's happening across the business  
3. **The courage to face your numbers**  
4. **Building accountability into the system**

**Throughline (not a separate angle — it's how you approach all four):** Head and heart together. Rigorous but human. Systems that serve people, not the other way around.

---

### **Part 4: Values, Beliefs & Philosophy**

**I believe…** dealing with reality is a far softer approach than ignoring it.

**I value…** intellectual rigor with kindness to people.

**I refuse to…** compromise truth for the sake of optics.

**I stand for…** systems built for humans, not humans squeezed into systems.

---

### **Part 5: Mechanism → Solution → Offer**

**Mechanism Statement:**

"My unique method is called **Find It, Build It, Prove It.**"

"It works because I find the real constraint, build the fix myself, and prove it works before moving on. No recommendations that sit on a shelf."

"It helps people stop flying blind and finally see what's actually profitable — with working systems, not advice."

**Transformation:**

"The transformation I deliver is: from drowning in data and guessing → to knowing what's profitable and deciding from clarity."

---

## **SECTION 4: Mapping Outer Audience Psychology**

### **Audience Psychology Map**

**Identity — "They believe they are…"**

* Determined, hardworking business owners who've gotten this far on hustle and grit  
* Leaders carrying the weight of responsibility for their team  
* People running on gut feel and duct tape (even if they don't say it out loud)

**Identity — "They want to become…"**

* "A real business with real systems that actually knows what's happening"  
* The leader others perceive them to be (not exposed as winging it)  
* Someone empowered to step away from the business

**Values — "They deeply care about…"**

* Their team  
* Excellence  
* Being modern, capable, competitive — not being left behind

**Desires — "Emotionally, they want to feel…"**

* Confident  
* Clear  
* In control  
* Not carrying it alone

**Beliefs — "They currently believe \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ about their problem."**

* "We need better software"  
* "Our ERP just needs to be configured right"  
* "If we could just find the right person to manage spreadsheets..."  
* "Our bookkeeper/controller should be able to figure this out"

**Objections — "They hesitate because they fear…"**

* Being exposed as not the leader they're supposed to be  
* Looking like a fool with endeavors they take on (ERP, new hire, consultant)  
* Team not buying in  
* Another thing that doesn't work

### **Audience Motivation Sentence**

"My audience wants to feel **confident and in control** by achieving **clarity on what's profitable** so they can finally **lead their business instead of just running it.**"

## **SECTION 5: The Message Bridge (PSI)**

### **Build Your PSI**

**Audience Desire:** They want clarity on what's profitable so they can lead their business, not just run it.

**Your Positioning Promise:** You help them go from drowning in data → to knowing what's actually profitable — by finding the constraint, building the fix, and proving it works.

---

### **Predominant Selling Idea (PSI)**

"My work exists to prove that **clarity doesn't come from better software — it comes from building the system that turns data into answers** — so that **manufacturers can finally see what's profitable and lead their business instead of just running it.**"
