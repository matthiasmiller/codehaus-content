Matthias Miller  01:38
Good morning. Hey, good morning.

Speaker 1  01:45
It's a drizzly day here in Kansas, which is it's been dry for like, month and a half. Oh, my, that's good getting a bit of rain.

Unknown Speaker  01:56
Hey, good morning. Good All right,

Matthias Miller  02:05
yeah, well, we're gonna have to break out, or at least our jackets, maybe even our coats here, so first day of the season, I know.

Speaker 2  02:20
So you guys back and from Christmas vacation, ready to ready for 26

Matthias Miller  02:31
Yes, yep. Or I think I think 26 was ready for us before, probably before we were ready for 26 but,

Speaker 2  02:42
yeah, your family stay healthy? Or did you also get hit by the flu? That was, there's a lot of flu around here.

Matthias Miller  02:53
We managed to avoid it. So I don't know. It's pretty unusual to have folks coming from, I don't know what is it? Four different states and all, you did not give each other something. Yeah, good. Did you guys get? You guys get hit?

Speaker 2  03:13
We did some. I know did you drew

Speaker 3  03:16
little bit. Not too bad. Actually. Jury's still out.

Speaker 2  03:20
I think ours seems like, I don't know, reminds us of covid, like, just, just kind of drags on and on, congestion, low grade fever, some headache and soreness and the congestion just wants to you kind of think, Oh, you're better. But then you you do something a little strenuous. Oh, okay, I'm not ready for that. Yeah, good. Well, we don't have, I think the best thing today is just going through the incidents I didn't even I know, okay, I know there's two specifically that through two of the old late strife payments and AR that you added a few situations that I think we're down to, rather the less than 1% edge case issues. So I would suggest we start there and then go from there. I think it's yeah fixed AR report, 8011 and 738, I think it's those 280. Eat it. I.

Speaker 2  05:05
Um, I agree with your note, though, group not allow write outs before invoice date. You're saying,

Speaker 3  05:19
Yeah, we had talked about that some Okay, and I was thinking we were doing it, but it was still allowing me to so maybe it's just something that dropped.

Matthias Miller  05:31
It's not something that where we're pushing the date up to the invoice date, is it?

Speaker 3  05:41
It didn't do it for me. It just, I plugged in an old date and it, it accepted it.

Matthias Miller  05:54
We had, let's see. Okay, let's take a look. Uh,

Matthias Miller  06:04
okay, this has had no sales tax and it was canceled. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:28
we have the it's a reversal, but there's a difference in on the 15th.

Speaker 3  06:47
Over, go to the the sales tax row would be referring to the history there

Matthias Miller  07:00
we never had,

Speaker 3  07:01
is this just prior to the dating to that change, so it wouldn't be pushing that history.

Matthias Miller  07:16
Okay? So we created the we filled in sales tax on the 15th and then Seth, why wouldn't we have a history row?

Speaker 1  07:36
It was probably canceled before, so we weren't doing daily at this point, and I bet it was canceled before did the monthly, right?

Matthias Miller  07:46
That's, that's fair. I mean,

Speaker 2  07:53
so is this would be a historical one off or, like, moving forward, this would no longer happen. Correct? Is that something we can just well? Is your thought?

Speaker 3  08:08
Yeah, I mean, you'll see it itself, brags 25th that's, you know, it fixed itself. So is your thought drew that we just won't worry about it. I Yeah, and then I think the next one like, notice there's part of it. And then here's the other No, that doesn't add up.

Matthias Miller  08:31
Let's go this next one, somehow we have a sales tax adjustment before the invoicing date. So we have invoice at 512,

Unknown Speaker  08:47
invoice date change,

Matthias Miller  08:49
yeah, I'm pretty sure, I mean, it was Miss built.

Unknown Speaker  09:00
Yeah, right there. Okay,

Matthias Miller  09:02
yeah. Did we change the invoice date from February 28 to 512

Speaker 3  09:12
and so then that let the old write off, which we must have gotten rid of the write off.

Matthias Miller  09:26
Or is this not the one the building was Miss built, they agreed on an $800 refund. But what happened? What? What did they get in February?

Speaker 2  09:54
Or was it tied to a different This was probably tied, originally tied to a different building.

Matthias Miller  10:05
Here, we took it, Dwayne, Dwayne relinked it. That's right.

Speaker 2  10:09
So the billing that was wrong probably went into inventory, and then this, that is probably invoice,

Matthias Miller  10:19
I mean, but shouldn't we have just canceled this invoice? And I don't know, we don't have a good way to transfer payments. That's why you don't link payments to the sales order. But anyway, I mean, but ideally, wouldn't we have canceled the original invoice to the building, freed up the building as as a, as a, as a lot building, and then I uh, and then created a new invoice and created a negative payment to zero this out and a corresponding positive one over in the other one, and link the two apply credit of one towards the other. Maybe it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2  10:57
Okay, this is way back when we started. Maybe this is a flaw in our design. When, when we said that's correct, well, they still do. They have the building and the invoice are one in the same. So when something like this happens, it gets really confusing. We said, We want this so that you can say the customer still has their invoice, their invoice number, 793, and here's the amount they expect to pay. The product they got. They're saying it's defective. They just want a replacement. So we said, Well, okay, fine, we've got the payments and everything. We'll just disconnect the old building and create a new building, link it to this, and we're good to go. But this because, in some ways, to the customer, like, it's still the same invoice. But then that, well, that, I don't know. I mean, this is how often have we had a situation like this, where we invoice or we change the invoice date? Probably, I mean,

Matthias Miller  12:14
does it? Does this one self correct as well? Over time?

Unknown Speaker  12:18
6319, minus 196

Matthias Miller  12:25
minus it looks like that. 128 that's off by five cents, plus the five cents like the sum of these here come out this zero sum. I somehow,

Matthias Miller  12:56
like, Here, let's do this

Speaker 2  13:00
63 Yeah, that that does 6196 plus dollar 28 minus five cents does equal to 6319

Speaker 2  13:18
I mean, I'm unless you guys think it's it's disagree, I would be comfortable saying, Well, this is enough of a one off that we just it all, it all. We just carry on, but setting ourselves up for

Speaker 3  13:44
no, I think these are probably all that way. I just want to make sure that they're not things that we're going to be repeating. Whereas I guess this one is one where we could maybe be well, but

Unknown Speaker  13:59
I mean Matthias, your your suggestion of creating a new invoice? I'm not, I'm not opposed to that. I'm just trying to

Matthias Miller  14:11
no it actually. I mean, what do you consider it from a in some ways would be nice is if you could, if Dwayne would have invoiced it under the original date, but, but that's also not quite act. I don't know. Is that accurate?

Speaker 2  14:34
Oh, okay, but, but, okay, good point. I think I might have seen this one before, one that was similar. Why did why did it? Why didn't we leave the invoice date, the original date? Was it right? We can we not invoice before the building Bill date? I mean, is that what it was? Is that what forces like, right? Yeah, that would be most appropriate is if we say,

Speaker 3  15:06
yeah, it messed up our inventory number. That's why I removed it,

Matthias Miller  15:10
right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:14
This is spaghetti.

Speaker 2  15:17
We are at a point and it where most of our things are like that. You cannot just the days of making a quick, simple change are no more. Yeah, which is is good. I mean, that's, that's

Matthias Miller  15:35
kind of what you want. And yet,

Speaker 2  15:41
what did Dwayne say yesterday morning? Josh is doing this. I don't know if you've seen it or not. This, this whole rework of of pricing with price sheets. And Dwayne said, this is, there were two opposing like, it gives us everything we need with maximum flexibility. Or, I don't know that they were kind of contradicting terms you don't often hear in the same sentence, but it's that's kind of what everybody wants, something that just works yet allows them to change it however they want to,

Matthias Miller  16:23
kind of like, I want a seat belt that keeps me alive in a crash but lets me walk through the, you know, move around the car at will as well.

Speaker 2  16:37
Well, I mean, I'm fine with just leaving this one as is sure,

Matthias Miller  16:42
the way I would conceptualize it in my mind, maybe I'm wrong. It's not ideal for the customer, but it's basically you would invoice originally, you would cancel it. Now you've got credit from the customer sitting in a customer deposit. Ideally, you'd have a way to transfer that from that invoice to a new invoice that then gets delivered, and a way to cross link them and maybe for the customer to say, here's the new invoice number this, you know, this supersedes, yeah, I don't know the original one.

Unknown Speaker  17:18
It's almost a retrieval invoice or something.

Matthias Miller  17:22
I mean, I mean, there is, there's not that much difference, yeah, conceptually the first one, it's not that much difference between this and a retrieval. I mean, if it were, you can tell what kind of world we've been living in lately. I mean,

Speaker 3  17:39
essentially, it is a retrieval. You just didn't have to go pick the first have to go pick the first

Speaker 2  17:44
one up. Well, they, they did, didn't they? I mean, oh,

Matthias Miller  17:47
I don't know. They probably tried to deliver, and then the customer is, like, that's not right, yeah, if it's, if it's missing windows or extra windows or something, I don't know,

Speaker 2  17:59
agree with your, with your what you said, Matthias, is there a good way to that we could have done that at this point. Like, I mean, canceling the original invoice, easy the the credit. Like, moving that as credit over or

Unknown Speaker  18:16
like, Do you Do you have a

Unknown Speaker  18:24
I don't know what you

Unknown Speaker  18:27
could probably make one.

Matthias Miller  18:30
Probably could this

Speaker 3  18:33
is, this is one of those things that gives us maximum flexibility.

Matthias Miller  18:38
Yeah, exactly. And said that I close our eyes. I mean, yeah, I think, I think something like a customer deposit that allows plus or minus values and and then just carefully cross cross reference, so you don't

Speaker 2  18:58
create headaches. Probably the deal here is, even though, if we for figure out the perfect plan of attack here when this time comes, once or twice a year, the chances that it'll be done like that are,

Matthias Miller  19:12
yeah, so I've, I have a little, this is back of my brain, back of my mind. But you know, if we would take the wiki and create a little custom LLM have a little AI tool that reads out of the wiki. You could then just say, Hey, I have a building that is returned, and we're going to replace it. How do I handle it? And go look it up and say, Oh, you have documentation over here that says you should do x, y and z. So, yeah, that's

Unknown Speaker  19:44
that might be useful, huh?

Speaker 2  19:47
Don't. Don't leave that idea to Gabe. He's he, he says that should, couldn't we do things like or even with the farmer, you call him to assist all that. Data that's in there. And you say, how much, how many 10 white buildings have we built this year in North Carolina? And it, it the AI goes, writes the report and and spits it out. Or, you know, obviously some much more complex things, but

Unknown Speaker  20:21
like to Hello, Gabe, let me check. Yeah, I'll be right with you.

Matthias Miller  20:30
Please state your request again. Yeah. I mean, the biggest thing with with AI is having the reason why AI is so good at coding is that you've got, I don't know, billions or trillions of lines of code out in the wild that it can look at, to learn from. And I think that, I mean, the biggest thing generally with AI is giving it the information of how it's going to go about doing this. And I think the, I don't know, probably the best way, is to, well anyway, we're a little too far down the totem pole to get that in the next few months to have list. Yeah, I think that's tell Gabe. That's, he's definitely, that's definitely toe wiggling

Speaker 2  21:25
works. Wow. Okay, even if that were possible, I question how valuable it would be. It'd be the type of thing where I'm being a little like, how much it's how much more effective would you be with your time if you had a tool like that? Or would you just do a lot of things you could because, just because you could that you think are cool, but really don't. You could spend a day digging around, pulling cool reports and say, but then at the end of the day, what would you do different than your business? Like, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:00
Well, I find it relatively rare. I've talked about this manufacturer. We've been doing production floor data, and we ran numbers by employee, because it's not really good data, but it's pretty good data. There wasn't any, like, what that guy's really that fast? I mean, like, it's just, I mean, what are you going to Yeah, we all know that if you just talk to your dealers, or you just talk to the builders, we all know that I don't know the the green 10 by 12 was really hot the last six months. Like, are you really going to find something that it can be helpful to find outliers, but you do have to be a little Yeah,

Speaker 2  22:48
but you can also still your or tilt your research, your findings, whatever direction you want to, even if it's even subconscious, or, like all the art of finance, like if you're going to look for if you already think that a certain type of building is profitable, or we do a lot of it, then it's most likely what you're going to find, like an interview, like you're looking for 10 by twelves, and say, Oh, we did a bunch of 10 by 10s and 10 by fourteens. Those are odd sizes. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:18
Those just, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
Okay, enough of a ramble.

Matthias Miller  23:25
Sorry if one little, one little note, there's a the, what is it? The CFA, the the really complicated financial investing certification that set you remember what it is. Investor tools people take. Joel took it anyway, one of the they have one on on financial biases. That's a really, really fascinating rabbit hole to go down. So anyway, onwards.

Speaker 2  23:53
So we, we agree that, why was he said they have one on financial what

Matthias Miller  23:58
biases like? What are, what are, what are different types of biases that you have when you look at at finance. I mean, it's, I mean, simple one is sunk cost. I mean, that's one that's so hard to mean, bad ideas creep up on you, and then pretty soon you look at the price tag and you're like, well, I could never let go of that money. I already have it in here. And in reality, what you need to do is cut loose and stop digging the hole deeper if you're not going to get out. I mean,

Speaker 2  24:31
that's that that reminds me of the, oh, it's been maybe, maybe a year ago, one of your, your silver loom stories, where the guy hired his smart nephew to create software, and after many, many months and and dollars, he finally cut the plug on it and put it all his sunk costs.

Unknown Speaker  24:56
Yep, that's i.

Matthias Miller  25:00
Seth is getting the brunt of all the nephew stories.

Speaker 2  25:05
This was a Long Ranger. It wasn't part of it. He wasn't part of it.

Matthias Miller  25:10
He was a part of a team when he was 12, or something. He was 12. That's hilarious. Yeah. Alright. So then this one here, this one doesn't have sales tax history. Was this one also before? Do you remember when we started nightly runs? Wow, look August, 22

Unknown Speaker  25:31
I would say September, October,

Speaker 1  25:35
sounds about right. I You,

Speaker 1  25:47
yeah, like second week of September. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  25:58
this one didn't correct it. So, right,

Matthias Miller  26:01
not yet it will,

Unknown Speaker  26:06
yeah, but when, oh, it's not

Matthias Miller  26:13
what invoice, it's paid. Wait, why did it not? Let's go to the Why didn't it get included in your sales tax liability

Matthias Miller  26:32
review missing sales tax liabilities for Indiana? Let's go find this guy, see if he exists. He does not exist. Should he not? I would expect him to show it Well, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:50
Virginia, what

Matthias Miller  26:53
wait this one is, I'm sorry, thank you. That would make a difference. All right,

Unknown Speaker  27:07
what's his proposed sales tax? Vendor, just expression evaluator.

Matthias Miller  27:17
Yeah, he's not tied to and why is that?

Unknown Speaker  27:24
Well, he has no address. Is that? What

Matthias Miller  27:30
accounting company we got that they have it if it's not tax state? No, that's why he doesn't have a tax date.

Speaker 1  27:40
So it's the little, isn't it, the little asterisk beside tax rate in there. Yeah, that's why.

Matthias Miller  27:49
Why would we just ping? We can't ping tax drug because we don't have an address.

Speaker 2  27:54
But drew you thought it goes it falls back to the dealer. That's what I thought.

Speaker 3  28:00
But that might just be for Ohio, because that's destination. I mean, it's based, here's destination based Josh. Josh wrote up

Speaker 2  28:09
tax to our logic and in the wiki, I think, or in an incident that might actually be helpful, if you're the AI guy,

Matthias Miller  28:21
exactly. Will be the incidents too, and I'll find it

Matthias Miller  28:30
looks like tax jar. I think it's look for jar, current figurator, retail sales, sales tax notes, the from address based on the shipping address. We tell about shipping separately, but this one probably wasn't able to ping because we don't have a destination like an actual address.

Speaker 4  29:02
I Well,

Speaker 2  29:11
okay, so we need to add an address and then texture. So should we, but we have lots of times when we don't have complete address. So why is that? Is that because it's destination based or source based?

Speaker 3  29:30
I mean this, I think this is, Oh, does it? Is it a North Carolina dealer?

Unknown Speaker  29:38
Yeah, it is. So

Speaker 3  29:40
the North Carolina dealer is trying to make it be destination based, and we have no destination or something. There's no There's no delivery task either. Is there like, Wasn't there something?

Matthias Miller  29:59
Just. It's a window. I mean, this looks like the kind of thing that was picked up somewhere, but maybe not it.

Speaker 2  30:07
I'm sure it was. Do we have a dealer of cherry stone structures? I wonder what would happen if we see if you have a deal or

Unknown Speaker  30:19
just switch it to Cherry stone.

Speaker 2  30:21
Yeah, yeah. And now see if we can ping. Oh, the tax rate change. Well, is that what? Oh, no, it was there.

Matthias Miller  30:35
Would I have to ping here? It was 269, yay.

Speaker 3  30:38
I think so. Well, I don't know if you do that doesn't make a difference.

Unknown Speaker  30:47
Do we still need an address on this?

Unknown Speaker  30:49
Yeah, we need to wait. Okay, now refresh.

Matthias Miller  30:52
Now, let's see what's well, it likes us now. Okay, so now I guess we could now change it back to,

Unknown Speaker  31:04
where was it? Well, no, that's fine, the dealer,

Matthias Miller  31:12
all right. So then, then let's

Unknown Speaker  31:15
write off the 18 cents while we're at it.

Matthias Miller  31:22
I A as of the when do you want it as of payment date,

Unknown Speaker  31:32
that's what I Yeah, yeah, payment date.

Matthias Miller  31:38
No underpayment. Overpayment.

Unknown Speaker  31:43
Yeah, you think tax

Matthias Miller  31:49
Wait, what am I doing? Drops

Unknown Speaker  31:51
the tax rate drops as an overpayment.

Unknown Speaker  31:53
Yeah, it's an overpayment, but you got to go negative. Okay, do

Matthias Miller  32:06
if they overpaid for tax, aren't you technically supposed to remit the additional tax that they paid to the state? I'll close my mouth now.

Speaker 3  32:15
Yeah, you are. Well, this should take care of that. Because, well, no, we don't have history. I think this one doesn't matter. But if there would be, if there would be history, it would take care of it, because it would say, Oh, we paid the wrong District, 269, you know, like it's a district change. So I'm not sure, right? Like, we didn't collect any tax for Virginia, but they didn't know they were either.

Matthias Miller  32:48
So okay, so do we need something? Okay, so this was, how do we find Shouldn't we have some way to so how do you

Speaker 2  33:11
fix this? You just write a journal answer for the 269 and then the 18 cents you just pay, or the the 252 or whatever you just paid.

Unknown Speaker  33:21
That's what it does when we have history.

Speaker 2  33:23
Yeah, but since we don't have history, what's going to happen here? Do you have to write a journal entry?

Speaker 3  33:28
Well, what? What are the transactions on this already? See, it'll

Matthias Miller  33:32
it'll add history tonight, and it'll breeze it. It'll lock it, lock in this rate. It'll update this guy to the new rate

Speaker 2  33:47
you're saying that would all take care of it. So I think so okay,

Matthias Miller  33:52
but do we need a way to find

Unknown Speaker  34:01
unpaidable, taxable items.

Matthias Miller  34:05
Yeah, would it be something without a taxable state? It's not that's taxable. I mean, even tax exempt. I mean, when do you have invoices that you don't want to report, like, even if, I mean, if it's if it's been invoiced. I mean, if it's invoicing, cancel in the same period, fine, but, but any other invoice you need to report it. What I'm confused about, Seth, maybe you know this better than I do. Why did this not why didn't it get shown in the report?

Unknown Speaker  34:44
Because it doesn't know which vendor.

Matthias Miller  34:50
So could we just show it if the vendor is blank, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  34:55
I mean, it won't work. It just have to throw an error. But I.

Matthias Miller  35:01
But then at least drew would see it, yeah,

Speaker 2  35:05
I mean, or is it too rigid if we force entering an address? No, would that wouldn't have fixed us anyway. Would it if we force you to always put in a bill to address or a ship to address Yeah, it's

Speaker 3  35:23
probably gonna make much money after people but, but the problem, like with the Virginia dealer, it's no problem to not have the address. So if you would do some you know, say, Oh, this is a North Carolina dealer. We have to have an address, because we have to have a destination. If you could do something like that, that might work,

Unknown Speaker  35:56
they'll tell me, there's that many with issues.

Unknown Speaker  35:58
No

Speaker 3  36:01
old, have no fear. I did notice that the warning, the tax warning thing, went away like I haven't had any with warnings in the last while, but I thought it was just with the change that you made having some other means to take care of?

Matthias Miller  36:28
Well, I would say we do have some issues

Matthias Miller  36:40
there as recent as like here's another One where you

Matthias Miller  36:51
don't have a tax date.

Unknown Speaker  36:58
How not?

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Well, let's

Matthias Miller  37:11
we tried to ping two weeks ago and it failed, or something happened. And

Matthias Miller  37:24
well, let's do this. What's your problem?

Matthias Miller  37:33
Well, that's real helpful.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
So do we have an address that's not hooked yet?

Unknown Speaker  37:58
You know, they're a stripe company, or I know is that mean they're

Unknown Speaker  38:01
on 16? That's great. Is

Matthias Miller  38:05
that the right state? Michigan? Where was I is

Unknown Speaker  38:15
Indiana. Is Indiana.

Matthias Miller  38:18
It's in Michigan. I

Unknown Speaker  38:23
that does make a difference. How

Matthias Miller  38:38
do you like now?

Unknown Speaker  38:49
Yeah, wait, right India, but there you go.

Unknown Speaker  38:57
We're selling it.

Matthias Miller  39:00
Is it Indiana? Oh, we're happy now,

Unknown Speaker  39:06
but it should be using a,

Speaker 2  39:09
why is it not using a Michigan tax rate? Like, shouldn't it, since it's going to a Michigan address?

Speaker 3  39:16
Um, not if Indiana? No. I mean, okay,

Speaker 2  39:21
I think this could be helpful. Josh on one of the self development incidents, he he put some texture logic that we'd asked about or about that. Pretty sure it's a site. Well, yes, there we go

Matthias Miller  39:46
for orders without a stint. We use the dealer's addresses, origin, destination. Here we do unless. We pick it from lot, and so then. So basically, if it has a stint and it's not pick up from lot, we try to go from this, from the store, from the origin to the destination. Then it gives us the zero tax rate. Then we tax it using the dealer's address.

Unknown Speaker  40:25
So what kind of site prep? Did this one have?

Unknown Speaker  40:32
Delivery? Standard delivery?

Speaker 2  40:36
Okay, I thought it may be two story building.

Speaker 3  40:40
Well, technically, if it's a two story building, it shouldn't be taxed, and the use tax should be enabled.

Speaker 2  40:48
But, yeah, that's that's another, another issue, some other things. But I wonder, if you look at modification history, there's a chance that, well, no, that the delivery method changed.

Matthias Miller  41:07
I don't know the delivery method would be in the building,

Speaker 1  41:12
didn't it? Just try to ping with the dealer and the store's addresses, and it failed. Is that? Address was invalid,

Speaker 2  41:24
but, but now it should go to to the Michigan address, should it not?

Unknown Speaker  41:29
Is Indiana a source?

Matthias Miller  41:32
Indiana is still a source. So if, if Indiana doesn't have destination based, or however that is,

Speaker 3  41:44
like, if Indiana is supposed to be source based, but they're, I don't like, normally you don't charge sales tax for something shipped out of the state.

Speaker 2  41:57
Well, I think we set it up to where I know. But do we have, do we pay Michigan to go?

Speaker 3  42:02
Yeah, yeah, we do now, um, but that's supposed to be stuff coming from a Michigan lot, but it there is things that they show up and as Michigan thinking,

Matthias Miller  42:20
shipping a building. Michigan use tax typically applies in the destination bill. Yeah. Sales

Speaker 2  42:34
Tax usually applies to justice buyer takes to live in Indiana,

Matthias Miller  42:42
directly. To Michigan. The transaction adds an out of state delivery. So Indiana sales tax normally is not charged unless the structure,

Unknown Speaker  42:59
unless you're doing it, as I'll show you, sales tax.

Matthias Miller  43:06
I don't understand why this is charging. Oh, wait, go back. Hold on there. Which one

Speaker 3  43:21
means, in practice, if the Indiana seller has nexus in Michigan, the seller should charge Michigan sales tax, which is what I expected, yeah, which is what that's where we are at, and that's what we should be, yeah.

Speaker 2  43:32
But why is it not doing that? When we ping, should it not ping Michigan rates?

Speaker 3  43:37
Well, is Michigan? It's because, if we're collecting for Michigan, but

Unknown Speaker  43:43
if Michigan

Unknown Speaker  43:47
is two, are arguing in here,

Speaker 2  43:49
I think if Michigan source based, then it would would flip back to Indiana.

Matthias Miller  43:54
Are we sure it's not this?

Matthias Miller  44:02
You should we're not getting a zero tax rate back?

Speaker 2  44:08
What if you enter this address directly into Can you just enter it in tax jar? That's what we're doing here, right? Yeah, 6% does it say? Does it tell us whether Michigan is source or destination?

Matthias Miller  44:31
AI would let's ask texture see if they have a list of this Michigan

Matthias Miller  44:42
by any texture, destination based,

Unknown Speaker  44:48
yeah, so, I mean, we should be,

Speaker 2  44:52
we should be charging the 6% rate, paying it to Michigan,

Matthias Miller  44:57
but they're wanting it is use tax, right?

Unknown Speaker  45:01
Yeah, where does that all sit? Well,

Speaker 2  45:03
yeah, but since we're you can only do use tax on a structure that adds value to your property, where it's real property or and we haven't, I think you need to. You may need a special contract for that is, we just, we haven't done that yet for you. But okay, I'm curious, if we look at, I'm sure we had other, we had a number of other sales. We have, we have an Indiana dealer

Speaker 1  45:35
that's a different building. Well, the second half of your good boy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank that'll get very confusing that four states involved.

Matthias Miller  45:44
Wow. Thank you for paying better attention to me.

Speaker 1  45:49
Um Sorry to interrupt mark, but I didn't want to leave false facts flying around.

Speaker 2  45:54
Something to do with this building being a bill on site, I'm not sure, but, but I'm sure we have other buildings sold from an Indiana dealer into Michigan. And I'm curious what those would show.

Speaker 3  46:08
Sure they're showing Michigan, but,

Unknown Speaker  46:12
and then we also have some Michigan. We have a dealer in Michigan selling a Michigan so

Matthias Miller  46:19
Okay, so let's do so accounting company equals shed time and so tax state equals Michigan and not is NA is a so invoice date

Speaker 1  46:38
You want to you trying to find ones that are who are actually sending to Michigan? Do you look at shipping?

Matthias Miller  46:48
Oh, right. Actually, I want to. I just want the so shipping state, yeah, and has. Well, if shipping state is that we're not sending windows over there, I'm pretty sure, or not likely. Okay, so then let's reverse, sort by this. Okay, so this guy is an example. Wait, is the one?

Matthias Miller  47:19
This one. This one's in Indiana. Okay, here, let's do this. Let's add a column for sorry, that's a tax state crank. Okay, here's one for Michigan.

Unknown Speaker  47:39
Yeah, three, vendor delivery. This one was sold by a

Matthias Miller  47:42
Michigan dealer. Okay, so let's do so,

Matthias Miller  47:55
dealer field. So, dealer, dealers. Date, you. Indiana, and it's shipped to Michigan and it's invoiced

Speaker 1  48:07
the subset dealer, dealer Name field, right? Because Josh names levels, weird things. Okay, here's a blank

Matthias Miller  48:19
tax exempt. Well, and so tax exempt. I mean, they're all getting sent to Indiana. Let's do this, because we just live. Why not? Why?

Speaker 2  48:37
Like we would have thought so you're barely paying any the only Michigan tax you're paying is

Speaker 3  48:44
from the Michigan dealer, which is incorrect. This seems

Matthias Miller  48:56
I mean, yeah, we're paying it to Indiana. That'd be a nice little correction. If we getting how far back to go?

Unknown Speaker  49:04
I don't think we'll do that one historically.

Speaker 2  49:07
But why? Okay, what, what is correct like is, is tax starting correctly? Or are set up here, or are we missing something?

Speaker 4  49:16
What I'm going to get? Good? Well, okay, if, but I,

Speaker 2  49:22
I can't remember these. These is Indiana source base. If Indiana source base, does that mean then? But then you also have to say, Well, where does the sale take place? Where does the where's the actual transfer of ownership happen?

Matthias Miller  49:42
I Okay, but here Where is

Speaker 3  49:53
one off? So, like both of them are destination based, and so they both would be thinking. That it should be the ship to address.

Speaker 3  50:07
Well, that's like right there people bought in Indianapolis stores taxing and rates, but when shipped to Kentucky, follows Kentucky's for us. I

Speaker 2  50:23
Hmm, what's the on this building? It's, it's, this is being delivered, right? It's not,

Matthias Miller  50:32
well, I mean, is there a train? There's a transit task for it,

Unknown Speaker  50:37
yeah, is this

Unknown Speaker  50:40
starts in Indiana, goes to Michigan,

Speaker 3  50:50
and it should be. I mean, even if we say, well, we are doing the delivery, and so the customer takes delivery at his location that would the location of the sale would be in the it would be Michigan. Then Anyway, okay, all of it points to, it should be Michigan.

Speaker 2  51:13
Well, okay to ref or to, I guess we could now. We could go look at building solar North Carolina, shipped to Virginia. I mean, that should we should be paying Virginia sales tax? Are you paying a lot of

Speaker 3  51:29
Yeah, but more so than we we bring them back to yeah, definitely more than this year.

Matthias Miller  51:38
I mean, that goes to Virginia.

Speaker 2  51:44
So what's the what's the difference here? Like they should, they should be handled the same, because all four of these states are destination based. I believe. I mean, I think Ohio and Pennsylvania are kind of the exceptions in this area. Or I know Ohio is sort of space, so why would what's different on these?

Matthias Miller  52:10
I, I would, I? It seems to me like the obvious next step is logging the texture. If we can do a manual give me a tax rate, I'm going from x to y, and what's the tax rate. And if we could do it manually in tax charter, that would be an easy next step, if not asking Josh and say, Hey, Josh, we're confused. Why this is happening. Can you tell us whether we're hitting a zero tax rate on the first call or not? Those, to me, seem to be like the next useful pieces of information

Speaker 2  52:55
and logging into tax. So that's something that Josh or Dwayne would need to do somebody that has access to, yeah,

Speaker 2  53:09
this is the type of thing that gets me fits because, you know, it just, it just works like you don't even notice if it's barely notice if it's wrong. You keep happily going along and it like,

Matthias Miller  53:25
Yeah, it's true.

Speaker 2  53:26
Also looked at like Ohio, that West Virginia. And we have some, some really interesting he's got that deal down in the corner. He's in Pennsylvania, I think,

Speaker 3  53:40
well, but he's technically on West Virginia soil, I think, is it okay? But a lot of the stuff goes to Pennsylvania, and then we pay paying West Virginia sales tax. The,

Matthias Miller  53:59
well, okay, and then the write offs. Where were we? The payment methods. We had added a way to say that certain things happen. I mean, we can make it hit accounting, oh, no, we can't. No, we can't. When is accounting date editable? Second?

Matthias Miller  54:52
Do we adjust sales tax liability for bad debt?

Matthias Miller  55:01
Yeah, so for underpayments, we could, we could have underpayments wait to hit until on or after the invoice date, if you want, and so you could enter it before, but it's not going to hit

Speaker 3  55:15
accounting until then. But what's the what's it going to say? Because if you So, what's the report like?

Matthias Miller  55:24
What would it be? AR report?

Speaker 3  55:27
AR report, what's it going to say? Is it going to show the owner after invoice date?

Matthias Miller  55:36
Does the does the AR report use the accounting date, or does it use the payment date? We want it to match it should use the

Matthias Miller  56:23
it should reflect that date. Yeah, it should match, I think we added this. I mean, we added this, and just never set setting.

Unknown Speaker  56:38
So on both of those, anything that

Speaker 2  56:48
would it just be those two really just sales tax liability for bad debt.

Speaker 2  56:59
You know, we're only concerned about, okay, when we say write offs, we want to do that for both overpayments and on payments. Like if it's a minimal overpayment, we want to do owner after invoice date, not do

Speaker 3  57:24
Yeah, because, I mean, you wouldn't, you shouldn't. Shouldn't really be saying something is an overpayment before you ever invoice it. Well, that's, I mean, I think deposit then at that

Speaker 2  57:36
point, how much work would it be to just stop it on the sales order like that would be the most correct way of doing it. If somebody tries to to date something before the invoice date, then you

Speaker 3  57:55
but Wasn't there something with something they do in Dwayne's office that they were wanting to be able to just take care of it while they're there,

Matthias Miller  58:07
if you're getting a check and you know, like, right? But it hasn't, but the invoicing process hasn't, if AR is processing it before the invoicing process got it, there's your spaghetti thread.

Speaker 2  58:29
So we probably should just go back and fix it on just, I mean, is that something true that you actually just look at and set it on the payment types? What do we want to try and do it now? Just think through.

Speaker 3  58:42
Is it think if we just set it on the payment types, if that works,

Matthias Miller  58:47
but doesn't that mean that we you need to be able to adjust the we should just let you edit accounting date regardless, right? For anything it

Speaker 3  59:03
should only be on those that are those write off,

Matthias Miller  59:10
I know, but I mean it will we'll let you edit it and then come in and change the write off ones to be on or after invoice date, whatever, whatever you want it to be.

Speaker 2  59:24
So you're saying to switch the accounting date on the ones we wanted to do that. Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  59:33
You can either force it to be the invoice date, or you can force it or change it be on or after, whatever you want.

Speaker 2  59:38
It seems like on or after would be because sometimes literally after, well, yeah, oftentimes after, but you drew which, which of these, we would change

Unknown Speaker  59:52
all the underpayments.

Speaker 3  59:54
It's adjustment for overpayment and for underpayment and the building as donation.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
And what's the one where we sent the money back?

Speaker 3  1:00:04
The CVS building adjustments should also be

Matthias Miller  1:00:09
we can change this one to on or after right away. And the building is a donation. Is that okay if it updates historical accounting transactions? Or do you want to wait until you clean up 2020, or lock 2025,

Speaker 3  1:00:27
I would think this should be okay now. What are the other because I know we fixed a bunch already.

Speaker 2  1:00:34
You need the yeah adjustment for customer or payment as well, right?

Matthias Miller  1:00:38
Yeah, we can't do that. Stuff will make, somebody will make sure that you can do that next week. But we can change the these two are the only ones that we can change at this point.

Speaker 2  1:00:50
Oh, good, okay. And what are the other ones that we need change? Customer Well,

Speaker 3  1:00:55
customer overpayment, the CBS ones, because technically we should not be. You know, the sale had those adjust how much of the sale because it's taking it out of building sales. So we shouldn't take it out of building sales before we actually have the building sale.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
Okay, well, I'm going to go ahead and save this and just all payment methods specify counting date after this is live Drew. Are you going to do it? Yeah, to update these payment methods to be on slash. We got this, yep, this this guy. We got this guy. We got

Speaker 4  1:01:53
this guy. This is okay, yeah, delegated. Sounds good,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:05
good. Anything else on the ER one

Matthias Miller  1:02:09
who's going to reach out to Dwayne or Josh?

Speaker 2  1:02:12
I can do that. Just put my Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:02:22
This. Is something else to consider, though, is

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
me, I can't lie. Lie up if I think

Matthias Miller  1:02:58
we need to do that. I mean, we need to do that, otherwise we'll have any way to catch and that'll handle that'll handle sales tax warnings. I mean, do we need to also, or could we, or should we just show anything with sales tax warnings?

Speaker 1  1:03:21
I'm not, I'm not sure that it matters. It should be the same thing, okay, well, we could just do the ones with sales tax warnings.

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
It basically be always include in your in your if statement or whatever, confirm the all items it's

Speaker 1  1:03:44
if it's after tax start date, include it if it's after a tax start date and it might have changes, sure,

Matthias Miller  1:03:56
right? If it's after the

Speaker 1  1:04:00
oh, wait, but you're saying you need to ignore the vendor.

Matthias Miller  1:04:08
Where's the vendor? Well, I'm saying

Speaker 1  1:04:12
the vendors in the repeat list, because it might be there might might match on multiple I think theoretically, like if the jurisdiction changed, it's actually, I'm not sure how easily we can Well, should we just create a separate report? Then we might have to, I'm not sure how we can easily get it in here without a fair bit of work. Yeah, we could add a preference or something to this report, SURE TO THE.

Matthias Miller  1:05:08
A pretty good attitude, sub pain. I don't really care, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:05:17
and that would just that would essentially be any that are missing, just if they're missing a

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
vendor, I would just do anything

Matthias Miller  1:05:26
with a warning, because the warning, it warns if there's a missing vendor or aren't warnings are warnings something that has to have to be cleaned up, or they just something to

Speaker 3  1:05:39
be ignored. Warnings are usually when I see them. Yeah, they haven't been shown, I guess.

Matthias Miller  1:05:47
So I would, I would do anything with a I would show anything with a warning, because, I mean, the mismatch rates we should handle. So.

Speaker 1  1:05:57
But do you want, if someone runs with a specific vendor, do you want to show all items at? That's what I'm wondering.

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
I don't know. What I would probably just do is like group by,

Speaker 1  1:06:21
include all with warnings grouped by vendor. Have ones that don't have a vendor at the top, and ones that yeah, match, match the as prop vendor next, and then everything else. Yep, that's good. Okay. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
Okay, good. And we're good with this as a sub pain rate of,

Matthias Miller  1:06:55
I think, I mean, I think that's actually

Unknown Speaker  1:06:57
probably just as good. I mean, I like that.

Matthias Miller  1:07:01
Are you good with that drew you pop up view vendor liabilities, and you'll get a pain down here with half your screen will be warnings, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:07:14
it'll still show the little you still have it in a column with the warning, it's already there,

Speaker 4  1:07:19
yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be the same, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
It's just that we don't have these ones falling through the cracks.

Speaker 3  1:07:29
Yeah, suddenly quit. I thought maybe there was

Matthias Miller  1:07:36
some things working so well, I

Speaker 3  1:07:39
know that. Wow, we just fixed it so that always bangs and everything works, alright?

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
Well, we made it through. We're making great progress on this list. Made it through one already.

Speaker 3  1:07:52
How soon? How soon is that warning? Are those warnings going to show up next week, the following week,

Speaker 1  1:08:05
for sure, by the following week, I can try to get it by. It shouldn't be that hard. It's an hour to knock out. I can probably get it in this week, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:08:14
if it can be weekend, that'd be fine. Okay, you're paying sales tax. What the 19th? 19th, 20th?

Speaker 1  1:08:22
No, we can, for sure have it by then, and I'll pro I'll probably just knock it out today or tomorrow so that it's out of my hair.

Matthias Miller  1:08:33
Live by January. Coded by No.

Matthias Miller  1:08:43
Reporting discrepancies.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:47
Yeah, drew this was

Unknown Speaker  1:08:56
one bad hitter. I

Matthias Miller  1:09:05
thing, those things that are treating the 1818, difference.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:10
So we have,

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
then we reverse the bad debt on 731

Speaker 3  1:09:53
is she got attached to something different.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
So weird date. I.

Matthias Miller  1:10:07
Okay, so let's go connect transactions. So we had

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
what Wait, what new transactions?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
Well, something is definitely an issue.

Matthias Miller  1:10:41
Missing an account somewhere.

Speaker 1  1:10:47
Let's do this. You just evaluate so account impact and look at it.

Matthias Miller  1:10:51
Can't we just run the Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:55
fine. Make it easier.

Matthias Miller  1:10:58
I mean, why do it the easy way, when you can get the hard way sales tax adjustment. We have a sales tax adjustment for 1818. Does not have an account. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
so this would be a tax adjustment,

Matthias Miller  1:11:37
sales tax liability and use tax, accounts receivable, add debt, debit for payment,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
credit for payment. Wait a minute, debit,

Matthias Miller  1:11:57
sales tax adjustment.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
Oh, no, it

Matthias Miller  1:12:04
doesn't look like those are the wrong notes. Is

Speaker 1  1:12:09
it bad debt related or not? I was found out. Oh yes, it would, don't we do some

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
the bad the adjustments, bad debt sales tax adjustment, debit, for payment, okay, account, company, impact, payment, debit, amount, that payment method. We don't have a it's because we we have bad debt, but we don't have a bad debt payment method on the transaction so, or on the Sales Order anymore?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:57
What? What happened to it?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00
I mean, David, hang on.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:04
Shannon, right off, 1819,

Matthias Miller  1:13:10
they got a check. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:13:16
can you reverse the write off and add the check instead of just replacing or not you guys, you guys care that would make the accounting work better. We have the

Matthias Miller  1:13:43
this would be 1819, and then we would have on today's date we would have, then we would adjust customer for payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:03
Wait. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:08
Well, it's not zeroing out. Do we have

Matthias Miller  1:14:20
or wouldn't it zero out.

Speaker 2  1:14:27
We're just going, Okay, but what? What actually happened here that we're trying to replicate?

Matthias Miller  1:14:34
We didn't think we were going to get paid, so we put in a write off, and then they send a check. I'm like, Oh, they paid. I guess we don't need to write it off anyway,

Speaker 1  1:14:47
but that makes our wait. We don't. We don't allow multiple bad No, but there aren't multiple bad debt. Sorry, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
You have adjustment for customer.

Speaker 3  1:15:05
Does the underpayment? One, 529, need to be negative.

Matthias Miller  1:15:13
The adjust for customer underpayment must use a negative amount. It says it does. I overpayment must use negative wait. I am so confused.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
I wonder if this

Unknown Speaker  1:15:33
bad warning or something

Matthias Miller  1:15:35
okay, because if I change this to zero, it works,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:40
yes, it says it must use a negative amount either way.

Matthias Miller  1:15:49
That's probably

Speaker 4  1:15:54
yours truly. I'll fix it

Speaker 3  1:15:59
so, so So, how is that correct? Like, there's, that's that can't be correct there. What's in now, right?

Matthias Miller  1:16:07
How are we, how are we coming up with that?

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
What it says the balance, the amount owed? Oh, what's payments and write offs.

Matthias Miller  1:16:31
So we are including bad debt here. Let's do this. We are including bad debt. So the bad debt subtotal is, we know we don't have literal write offs. It's a bad debt row.

Speaker 1  1:16:56
That's if you're not including bad debt, which you are, we're including the bad debt tax subtotal, if we'd let it, if we'd save it like this and then let it run, then wouldn't zero out like as we're using the tax to help calculate it. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:17:21
Why is it off by the entire amount? Oh, we're using the tax row.

Matthias Miller  1:17:36
Okay, the bad debt subtotal. The bad debt subtotal. Is zero,

Matthias Miller  1:17:57
because we take the difference between that, because that is zero. I mean, there is no bad debt.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:01
What happens if you evaluate that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:11
answer because

Matthias Miller  1:18:13
it was reversed? And so we're using $1 dollar amount for this. I

Matthias Miller  1:18:27
You can't just change this here to be a zero and have that.

Speaker 3  1:18:34
Could we just do it that way? Because then it would give you the account. We give you the account.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40
I mean, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:18:46
1819, on 529, 731, and so that would adjust. I mean, your 731 amount should and

Matthias Miller  1:19:02
the other adjustment we don't need anymore, I think. So,

Matthias Miller  1:19:18
okay, so

Speaker 3  1:19:52
So basically, if somebody had a bad debt, they just have to there just has to be a warning that tells them to zero it and right. New Line.

Matthias Miller  1:20:01
I think, I think we'll, or straight up, require it,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:08
yeah, yeah, require it, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:15
Okay. I mean, does that here to add an error, but

Matthias Miller  1:20:19
you could do a warning on, warning on, warning on, on save if it seems like this should have, I mean, it should have shown up, shown up on, wait, wasn't there? Weren't we supposed to look at why this thing isn't showing?

Speaker 1  1:20:40
Oh, yeah, that rings a vague Bell. All right.

Speaker 3  1:20:58
Well, isn't that because the bad debt line didn't have an account.

Matthias Miller  1:21:02
Okay, well, let's, let's go try it if we,

Matthias Miller  1:21:14
yeah, see, still, actually, but we have one that we know should be producing an error. So let's go sales order model.

Speaker 1  1:21:27
It's just looking at your it's on silver limb values record the keys that are cached. Is problematic.

Matthias Miller  1:21:39
We're not looking at those, those

Unknown Speaker  1:21:42
which I would still think that should be on there.

Matthias Miller  1:21:46
Well, let's go look at go to lists.

Matthias Miller  1:21:55
Okay, so we would expect this guy, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:01
we voices. And sales orders

Matthias Miller  1:22:06
kind of think I'll be in there. This guy's not in here.

Speaker 1  1:22:15
Why is nothing showing up in the report? Even when we have all these guys,

Speaker 3  1:22:20
I know why. No, never mind. I got a email with with the accounting error thing, and the report was empty. Yeah, supposed to only send when there's something in it, but maybe it is just to send occasionally.

Speaker 1  1:22:38
Well, I wonder if the reports, the feels like the reports having trouble, but,

Matthias Miller  1:22:44
yeah, the report is having trouble. I'm pretty sure. Well, I still think we're back to, let's go at this guy. I think we have enough other errors in this, in the system to thank you. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:02
That's one of my favorite air messages.

Speaker 3  1:23:12
So Simon The Time Travelers Club, they meet here last Thursday. That's awesome. Okay, Thursday, yeah, meet here last Thursday, or something about the regular meeting is here last or was? It's not was, but it was, you know, we will be last Thursday. So when we have a meeting,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:36
oh, the next Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:23:41
And then this guy redated to a refund date.

Matthias Miller  1:23:52
So the fee got changed. Well, who?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
So I think I probably switched it back.

Matthias Miller  1:24:03
Okay, well, let's go. I

Speaker 3  1:24:05
re dated it. But if you, if you look in there, you can see,

Matthias Miller  1:24:17
I mean, that just looks like somebody messing with dates. You shouldn't, right.

Speaker 3  1:24:26
Well, but I think we had an issue. I mean, it could be, but we had an issue with when you would enter a refund, then the stripe thing would tie out like it would redate the the fee to the original for the original to the to the refund date.

Matthias Miller  1:24:55
I think the issue Josh's recent work. I suspect at least i. Highly suspect Josh's recent work to fix straight refunds should prevent that. I relatively I'd be relatively comfortable thinking saying this. This seems likely a one off issue and if not, it's very likely that Josh's refund stripe refund fixes will help. Is going forward. I think, I think my opinion diminishing return is trying to chase this particular one, and let's see if it shows

Speaker 4  1:25:43
up again. That fair? Yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:25:47
Wait, hey, we got two. Got through two?

Speaker 2  1:25:53
Well, I guess, okay, there's nothing. Feels like nothing on fire from from our site. Is there anything you're waiting Well, I know there's some things, but are there things that you're waiting on us that we should look at, or should we just wrap up the meeting? We're almost at the top of the hour, and

Matthias Miller  1:26:13
no, I mean, the biggest thing on from my end is cash flows whenever you get to it. But I'm not expecting you guys to push that hard right now,

Speaker 2  1:26:22
cash and Seth, you're waiting on payroll, right? Some things not necessary.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:28
Oh, yes, I have questions on that payroll incident

Matthias Miller  1:26:31
that we should we also have. We also have questions about deposits too. All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:38
do you guys? Do you

Matthias Miller  1:26:42
guys have a few minutes? Yeah, yeah. How terrible would it be if you would have to hand enter a deposit total, and we would make a field for deposit total, instead of auto calculating it based on what's on the deposit

Unknown Speaker  1:27:01
and then you would warn if it's wrong.

Speaker 2  1:27:03
I mean, what's the I mean, not, not terrible, What? What? Why the change? Is it as a way to double check that, yeah, what's the thought?

Matthias Miller  1:27:15
It's well, says, you can explain the we're wanting to use deposits in only as well, but I forget the use case there, why this is so useful so well.

Speaker 1  1:27:29
There we link it. I don't remember for sure why. We just thought it'd be safer if you have to enter it and then getting it to match.

Matthias Miller  1:27:39
I think part of it is on their end, they like, Okay, you get a stacks checks. You feed it to the check reader, you get a ticket back. You take the ticket in, you enter the ticket. What's the total? And this is my understanding, what's the total? Oh, the total is, you know, 2453 36 and then you go add everything in and make sure that it all ties out. I think that's the rationale in that case, completely sure, a reconcile type of thing. It's a reconcile,

Speaker 1  1:28:08
although we could, if you all don't really want that, we could also could conceivably have a field change expression that just stomps it in. It would display a calculated value and then have it stored under the hood. I think we could. We could also just have an operations, yeah, whether

Matthias Miller  1:28:27
it's auto calculated or entered, yeah, you could what. We could also just have a system configuration to switch between auto calc versus entered, although, like your process would be to go create the deposit, record, link, a whole bunch of sales, order payments, and you might not necessarily,

Speaker 2  1:28:56
I like to. I like the process of because we've recently had somewhere the actual deposit, where the total was wrong simply because we missed, say, we missed entering a one of the payments, and in most cases, we have the total. So we would either before you start or after you're done with the payments, you're forced to enter that before you can save the deposit, is my thought. And then right now the double check is simply, does my source document total match with the total I end up with after putting in all the payments? And that's easy to just miss that this will force you to you find a number somewhere, you enter it or your total, you enter your payments, and then if the two amounts don't match, then it forces you to figure out what happened. I'm I'm fine with just making that changes. I think it would be good process change anyway. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:03
Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:30:04
don't make many, so it doesn't really change much for me. But I think a lot of our use cases, though,

Speaker 3  1:30:14
is the the total, like when they're looking at document somebody sent them said we deposited this. That number is just calculated off of the sum of what they add to and what I'm thinking is their document could just as easily give them the wrong total and therefore be still be wrong.

Speaker 2  1:30:34
Well, it could, but we recently had one for fifth direct work, the document total was correct. Okay. Well, they got confused was we had a double payment on a single invoice. They never entered the double payment on that invoice. And so they were like, 2000 the deposit was 2000 less than what the bank statement showed. And so that that would have caught, caught this one? Yeah, I think you would also, I mean, there is some of that where you I think it would be a good thing to have, yeah, I'd say, let's just make the change.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:15
You'll get it for free because we're doing

Unknown Speaker  1:31:19
it for Dwayne. What else do? But

Speaker 1  1:31:23
what would the work? When do we warn them? Like, if you're linking sales orders, at what point would we warn if your total is different?

Matthias Miller  1:31:31
So if you would, you would you have the you enter the total, you would show the difference in red if it's different or something, and then we create an accounting impact error. If the I mean, like, we would use the Enter total in the transaction somehow, I think we would try to force accounting impact to fail. Okay, and but

Speaker 2  1:31:51
if at all possible, I wanted to stop at the point they save where the amounts don't match it, they can't proceed further.

Matthias Miller  1:31:58
Well, the problem is that you create the deposit record in here, in here that you create, that you create the deposit record and then add sales orders to it.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:14
Well, but, but if we, if we have,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:16
like, essentially, it's saved before you ever add your sales

Unknown Speaker  1:32:21
orders to it. Of how we link.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
We could show,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:29
can you show something here, you know, your intended total or something.

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
See, I mean, we could show the

Matthias Miller  1:32:46
we could show a amount and a difference column that would just be in the total. Would that work? You might not see it until it's until you save. It might not Refresh until you save.

Speaker 2  1:33:05
So you do this, but then do you have to save again? Do you have to save the deposit record again after you've linked these? Well, what I'm what I am concerned about is if we do a Delta transaction that says when the amounts are different, then it creates a transaction for that. They just, just complicates things. So now we have a a double transaction saying,

Speaker 1  1:33:36
miss, I think you would throw an error accounting impact would throw an error if they're different. I mean, we'd have to go track it down.

Matthias Miller  1:33:44
We would try to create, intentionally, try to create a mismatch transaction, to force accounting impact, to throw an error, so so that there's a stop gap somewhere that these get addressed.

Speaker 1  1:33:56
Mismatch transaction, meaning numbers aren't lining up, so it doesn't create a transaction like

Matthias Miller  1:34:01
debits and credits don't match. Use, use one one total for the debit and one total for the credit. And then if, if it's not tied out, it can't push to accounting.

Speaker 2  1:34:11
Well, could we add a system switch to so if this proves to be cumbersome, that we could just go back to not forcing that total up, like if we had a, if we had a system switch, and then error show up in accounting. Impact discrepancy is that I'm, yeah, I think that's good.

Matthias Miller  1:34:34
Well, somebody's, if we require it, when you set up the deposit, that means they would have to come up with the total number that they expect first, or they're going to have to put in zero and know to come back to it, which that seems like a user error. If they, I mean, that's that doesn't seem

Speaker 2  1:34:51
okay, the stop gap would be, if they come back to it, it will show them similar to like our vendor invoices right now, whether we're we're. An accounting transaction, whether we're matched or not,

Matthias Miller  1:35:05
it would show a difference of some kind here that says, hey, it's not tying out.

Matthias Miller  1:35:18
I would rather, yeah, if you're game to try it, I would rather just try it, and if it creates trouble, then let's we can avoid planning for a contingency that we don't know exists. Let's figure figure out a way out of the corner when we get there.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:38
I like it, good. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:35:42
Um, it payroll questions

Speaker 1  1:35:46
the top one in the section, yeah, there. So my question is down there, it seemed the first one's employee compensation. We don't seem to use the hourly wage towards labor costs, which is for salaried employees working in incentive production.

Speaker 2  1:36:09
Oh, that's okay. Is that we built that so that if we have salary employees working in production, that we can say he's still going to pay paid salary. But yes, hourly is, yeah, you're saying we've never used it, did you? I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:36:26
think we have what I could see. Let's get rid of

Speaker 1  1:36:34
it. And then company compensation settings. I was trying to figure out if we can, I think we need to keep this actually, because we we essentially want to freeze the production pool or the incentive pool. But for oh, this is that I was wondering whether we could just automatically calculate always. But I think no, the answer is that we want to freeze it for sure. So I think I'm answering myself as I come back to

Speaker 2  1:37:07
it, I think I mean freezing. So occasionally in history, we'll say, Oh, this building should have been reported as being built on this day, right? The Pool doesn't change, if

Speaker 1  1:37:18
you wouldn't exactly, yeah, yeah. So I think I got confused, because under the hood, it's called an override. It's, I mean, it's sort of an override, but it's really more the frozen value rather than so I might go rename a few things under the hood so that it makes more sense. But that's why I was getting confused. You're exactly right. Break times don't appear to be used. Do we want to keep them around, or can we remove them? Okay, and 1099, it's on, it's in the Configure payroll on the builder. I think this is,

Speaker 3  1:37:57
would it be something if you have subcontractor time that you want to

Matthias Miller  1:38:01
No, it's paying owner, owner rent or something, then you could just create a fat payroll check and pay the owner's rent or whatever that it's something like that mark. Does that ring a bell? Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:38:16
And we have, we have one or two situations like that where we're paying, okay, we do have, we have Noah Miller where we're paying, yeah, we do. We have him paid or being paid like, it's a long, confusing story, but it's, it's vinyl structures. Rents the shop pays rent to him for for using his shop. So they pay like $22,850 a week. So I'm wondering if we could, currently we have that set up as a recurring vendor invoice, which you pay.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:02
But could we, would this allow us to make that part of his

Matthias Miller  1:39:12
this the town of payment is gonna, it's gonna come out of payroll.

Speaker 3  1:39:17
I mean, not gonna hit the right account. It's way simpler to let 1099, payments be to vendors and payroll be to employees, and not try to mix the two. But I mean, unless there's something with with how you're calculating labor on a particular project or something like that, but something separate, like rent that has nothing to do with labor, I would definitely want to keep separate.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:44
And you're treating that as a 1099 the way it is, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:39:49
because we so the settings are for recurring 1099 payouts.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:54
You're sayings are for that.

Speaker 1  1:39:56
Yeah, if you open up a, I don't know if we built it to work. If it's just the framework there and

Matthias Miller  1:40:02
it's built to work, okay, pretty sure

Unknown Speaker  1:40:06
I'm not.

Speaker 3  1:40:07
The settings are for people who know that they should be employees and are being used as 1099 contractors. That's the case.

Speaker 1  1:40:18
Our excuse. These are blank on every single company out there.

Matthias Miller  1:40:24
Yeah, it's like which week of the month and how much and what is it for. But, I mean, but yeah, we're not gonna, it's not gonna hit accounting properly.

Speaker 2  1:40:32
Recurring vendor invoices are doing exactly this. No, let's give it

Unknown Speaker  1:40:38
perfect. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:40:43
and then verification report. Open the especially the employee verification report. Okay, what you run it for? You might want to specify company so it's faster, yep, maybe it's coming. Yeah. Well, there it is. There we go. What production is you wanting to show the right at the top there, I put in the total incentive production for now, but I wasn't sure. Do you just want the total production? Do you want to differentiate between incentive and fixed pay, which is essentially full amount pool?

Speaker 2  1:41:20
Okay, up until now, we've just been showing total incentive production.

Speaker 1  1:41:26
I don't think we really differentiated between No. Up until now, it was total production. I think because we didn't, Josh added that field to differentiate between whether it's incentive or fixed pay, which is pool, non pool,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:42
okay, but up until then

Speaker 1  1:41:47
and but we hadn't updated, these reports are still just showing the whole production amount, not they weren't respecting that field, correct.

Speaker 2  1:41:55
Okay. Do we own the weekly build sheet? Have we build out that now? Already where? Where it shows,

Speaker 1  1:42:01
I'm not sure if Nick got to it yet. It's, it wouldn't be in the live system. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 2  1:42:10
we, we do want, no just, just what you have here, total incentive production, perfect. I could see that. Yeah. I

Speaker 1  1:42:26
and you might want to look at the other verification reports make sure they look what you look like, what you'd expect for different numbers. But I think it, I mean, I think it should be good.

Speaker 2  1:42:41
You're saying the new ones, the ones that are have just gone live the last week or two.

Speaker 1  1:42:45
Yeah. So, like, Here I show, if you keep it, stay at the top there. I'm sorry. Like, total production. I have it broken down, and I we can consolidate that again if you want, but have it split apart to show all the details.

Speaker 2  1:43:04
What is the difference between incentive production, actual and for pool

Speaker 1  1:43:08
that the four pool is the frozen. It's like if you would change a build date or something

Speaker 2  1:43:15
the actual I prefer to just make or remove that I'm just always, just for pool, which would be the moment, right? Yeah. And then the fixed pay production would be, it's the second line that Nick's adding on the weekly build sheet. Or the build sheet like the, yeah, it's the

Speaker 1  1:43:37
respecting Josh's new field. Yeah. I any,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50
I mean, just looking at it briefly, yeah, I like it, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:43:57
And then scroll down Matthias, yep, this i We had differentiated between the employee facing side and pool facing side. We don't need that anymore, now that we removed that one field, so it's just the incentive pool payroll and the fixed pay payroll.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:20
Okay, you're saying there was another field in here.

Speaker 1  1:44:22
Yeah, the incentive pool side was split into two parts because there was part of it was what we told the employee, we're paying them, and part of it was what we're pulling out of the pool, which was potentially different.

Speaker 2  1:44:37
Yeah, good. I like this. The other thing on this, this, nobody ever uses this employee breakdown thing, the great idea like finessing this each week and saying, oh, Adam was instead of 95 five, he was 92.5 nobody does that like we had anticipated so that can. All go away the

Unknown Speaker  1:45:01
bottom, the very bottom part there.

Matthias Miller  1:45:05
Or this, do you still want to show the whole thing? Or do you want to just get rid of the corrections?

Speaker 2  1:45:14
Get rid of all of that. We look at that quarterly and say, Are these accounts still correct? And just update it quarterly. This is straining at nats now that in hindsight, we're seeing this.

Speaker 1  1:45:33
Do not make a note. Yeah, I think that. Do a

Speaker 2  1:45:50
good with I just discovered this morning set some of those payroll user reports that you created for me for looking at, like doing annual reviews or looking at a period of payroll production totals is they're broke. Now that we with

Unknown Speaker  1:46:07
some of these, I'm sure they are.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11
Should I just create an incident for them?

Speaker 1  1:46:15
Or, yeah, that'll work. That's why we have standard reports, because it would have been, that was it would have been working. Yeah, we can definitely get them fixed up. Should we standardize them? Or do you want them to stay user?

Speaker 2  1:46:40
Probably stay using more for confidential. Sure there's also permissions that would solve that. But maybe we could to the permissions thing and start using that properly, or we

Matthias Miller  1:46:57
could also make them standard and not put them on the menu and just give you the you can find them in the standard folder.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:03
I like that sounds good. We

Speaker 1  1:47:09
could put them in a confidential folder, in the standard folder, so that no one looks there. Do not look here.

Matthias Miller  1:47:14
Exclamation mark. Exclamation mark.

Speaker 3  1:47:18
We'll just give it a name, like if a R something. I exactly,

Speaker 1  1:47:25
great, standard, boring report, dot r 20, exactly. Okay, anything else we should look at some point we could consider moving ahead with the that one Matthias is hovering on the payroll data from QuickBooks. Sean has the imports and records and stuff in place, so we can, if we get the contact names to line up between assist and QuickBooks, then we can import those records that Aaron or the spreadsheet there and showed us from there, then we still need to figure out how to take that and turn it into transaction. But I think that's probably an hour or two of Matthias building out, or maybe me, I don't know, building out an import to do that.

Speaker 2  1:48:14
So it's step one you need to get, you need us to get the names to match whatever we're showing in a CS must match exactly, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:48:24
what's in QuickBooks for it to import, or manually edit the file every time. Or we add some sort of mapping across which we can do.

Speaker 2  1:48:34
No, let's not do mapping. Matthias very happy amounts of our time trying to map compass purchase orders to be kind of like, like you're even worse than that. Your Life list of birds, you would keep it in Latin, but you tally it and whatever.

Speaker 1  1:49:01
Oh, yeah. Or try to use all the names from like the early 90s or the early 1900s and,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:07
yeah, that would be even better. And then you say long tail duck.

Speaker 2  1:49:21
Can you add it to do for just yeah, for assign it to Aaron, and I'll talk with him on what we need there. But assign it to Aaron and I

Speaker 2  1:49:43
Yeah, assign it to Aaron, and send an email to Aaron and I, as you remember, and then we'll, we'll get started that. I think that's going to happen pretty quickly, because Aaron's anxious to, yeah, get this off of his plate and get it working better than Yeah. Yeah, so,

Speaker 1  1:50:01
and there's, there's imports are on the menu if you go to accounting, yeah, so you might have to, I don't know if you have to set up the payroll line items, but then it's just the import, QuickBook, payroll report line items would do, oh, I think you just import it. It'll add those categories there, then and then you need to say, which

Speaker 2  1:50:33
are you saying? We could, as it is today, we could already import

Speaker 1  1:50:38
if once you get the contact names lined up, yes, then the imports should all work correctly, okay. And then the only thing from there, then is, once we have the QuickBooks data in the system, then we need to figure out how to convert that into an accounting transaction. But I think, I think that's probably like, maybe I'm wrong with us, but I'm thinking it's like an hour of your time or something to

Matthias Miller  1:51:02
I think so. I mean, I think it's pretty straight forward.

Speaker 2  1:51:07
Yeah, I think so. So Seth, do you need us to manually change the names so they match, at least for the first one, run the imports, and then you have the imports, and then you're going to figure out what, how to take the import and turn it into an accounting transaction.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:23
That would be great. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:51:25
ideally, you'd also have the the accounting Well, no, you don't need our accounting transaction. Do you that we that you

Speaker 1  1:51:33
showed us an example one. So I think, based on that, we could probably do it. Does that sound right? It sounds

Speaker 2  1:51:40
right, but yours is going to be more detailed, like, broken out per employee, rather than all lumped together or put pieces of it are, I think

Matthias Miller  1:51:48
pieces of it are, I think, once again, go ahead

Speaker 2  1:51:53
Well, rather than, like, there's a huge chunk here in direct labor, like,

Matthias Miller  1:51:58
yeah, it's plan was to sign those to contacts and have one line per employee.

Speaker 2  1:52:04
So if there's 20 employees here, you'll have 20 line items, and then you could look in accounting history, you'd have ways of seeing how much net pay did we pay out?

Speaker 1  1:52:16
Yeah, and it should be pretty drop dead simple once we've got the data in.

Matthias Miller  1:52:22
And then you can reconcile your end of year. You can reconcile your payroll provider against your accounting system. Make sure that your net pay actually matches.

Speaker 3  1:52:31
Yeah, the primary checking though, don't split that, because that is how it comes out.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:37
Yeah, I understand. I mean, I

Speaker 3  1:52:41
just thought about automatically know that these six go together, see rooms like,

Speaker 2  1:52:53
good. Well, this, this is amazing to me, that this would be easy to do. To me, it seems this would be really hard to do, but okay, we'll get some imports in here, make sure the names match, get some imports in here, and then let you know once that's done. And then we'll have to, long term, work with Whitney to just update the names moving forward.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:21
Well, you're saying update her names.

Speaker 2  1:53:24
Yeah, have her names. My thought is, ask her to change the employee names to match with as a contact sentence

Speaker 2  1:53:39
is, I would drag my feet because you're usually doing payroll on in QuickBooks. Well, no,

Speaker 3  1:53:45
because split so if, yeah, it's going to split up your W twos and Because suddenly, then she has reported X payroll for, for, for Mart, a, you know, whatever like, if she makes a change, then that's going to affect her. W2 reporting,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:08
sounds like they didn't build it

Speaker 3  1:54:11
very well. Well, that could be, this is QuickBooks we're talking about. But actually, I think it's more of a government problem, but

Unknown Speaker  1:54:22
that makes sense. I You can if you have a

Matthias Miller  1:54:25
legal name change

Speaker 3  1:54:26
with trying like it'd be worth finding out, but just right off, my hunch would be, oh, that's gonna act like you have a different employee, and it's gonna because, because you're making submissions to the government throughout the year for the certain employee. So you can go change the name in QuickBooks, and it will historical change that name. What the submission online looks like, like to the government? That's that's where the problem well, it's. She gonna then have to be like, oh yeah, this, this guy's Now S instead of a or whatever.

Speaker 2  1:55:05
If we can't change, if that doesn't work, then we can come back and change, then the contact names

Speaker 3  1:55:12
and assist. That's what I'm thinking. I would rather change the contact name and assist. Just it's for the same reason, you know, if she overpaid something, you don't go try to fix it. I mean, you have to fix it on that end, but you don't like, as far as the numbers, she's got the law, even if she's wrong.

Speaker 2  1:55:37
I mean, there's, there's cleanup, I know there's cleanup I'd want to standardize on both sides. So that's why, if, if she can change, that would be great, but if not, like, some you have a middle of nature. Some you don't, there's a employee, like, yeah, and that's okay, that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:53
I definitely wouldn't send that to the

Speaker 2  1:55:56
government, that that is, is because of a at one time, a limitation on the contacts, where he's also a hauler. And I know there's stuff made so that you can merge, merge contacts, merge, all right, coach and the employee into one. We've never done that, but that's all kinds of fun stuff. Yeah, this

Matthias Miller  1:56:21
will, this will be fun,

Speaker 4  1:56:24
yeah, all right, good, good. Okay, thank you guys. Thank you. Okay.
