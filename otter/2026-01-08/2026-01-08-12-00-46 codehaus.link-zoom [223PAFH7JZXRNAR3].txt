Unknown Speaker  01:26
It, howdy, howdy.

Unknown Speaker  01:35
Oh, stop it.

Speaker 1  01:38
Please be the right thing. Yeah, okay, can you do me a favor before we go any furthers,

Speaker 2  01:45
share screen with control. I think I just don't laugh at this. But Matthias, Matthias,

Speaker 1  01:59
Matthias, can you jump in here and make sure that the

Speaker 2  02:05
automated task is set up now as to run

Speaker 1  02:14
whenever it's supposed to run for him every Day, whether we're logged in or not.

Speaker 3  02:19
Oh, I mean, yeah, okay, perfect. Not even laughing,

Speaker 1  02:31
because I, I don't know why it took me so long to find the the OS password, but it took me forever, and I just literally just found it. I just want to make sure that we're set up this. That means that things should run at every 4am every morning, and should push it

Speaker 3  02:48
to assist, correct, should, yeah, all right, sweet. All right.

Unknown Speaker  02:57
I can check that off my mental list now, which my mental list lately has been failing me. So,

Matthias Miller  03:10
all right, do I need the sharing anymore? No,

Unknown Speaker  03:14
I'll stop stalking you. Stop stalking me.

Matthias Miller  03:17
Okie, dokie, Smokey, let's go.

Speaker 1  03:22
Let's go. The goal today is to get contracts pushed and start working on payments. That's the goal today.

Matthias Miller  03:30
Contracts are a baby,

Matthias Miller  03:42
right? So let's go to test only. Let me share my screen. Shall I?

Speaker 3  03:50
Would you please? Would you please? Would please?

Speaker 1  03:54
Did you see the email from explore pay, wondering where we're at?

Matthias Miller  03:58
Yeah, I didn't know if I was letting you can reply if you want to. I don't know where, but your reply probably is going to be more courteous than mine. Mine's just like, give me an agenda for what we need. We don't have anything. What's your agenda? What do you need from us? Can you please give it an email and then let's figure

Speaker 1  04:15
it out. No, I think what you should reply with is just say, here's where we are. We do not we are good. We do not need a call.

Matthias Miller  04:21
I'll need to check in exactly where we're at, but I'll do that.

Speaker 1  04:25
But yes, that's the I mean, we need a I don't know where we're at. I don't know where Jonathan's at. I was, I was fiddling around with with the payment window the other day, and noticed that it seemed like something was connected with explore pay,

Matthias Miller  04:48
yeah. I mean, there's definitely connection happening somewhere. I'm not sure the extent of it. I should do another code review of his stuff. Again, it's been a few weeks since the last one feels.

Speaker 1  04:58
It feels like from. Development standpoint, I feel like we have, we have holiday hangovers. That's how I feel. I'm not saying that you guys feel that way. I said that's how I feel. I don't know why I feel like this, this holiday. I must have just decided I was going to toss work out of my brain and just go on holiday. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:26
we should probably remove that,

Unknown Speaker  05:29
except one column.

Matthias Miller  05:38
Okay, so then

Unknown Speaker  05:41
field is not editable. When is the field not editable?

Matthias Miller  05:51
We should probably do this. That would probably make a little bit more sense.

Speaker 3  05:59
I'll run that in blurt. A friendly thing i

Matthias Miller  06:24
Okay, well, we created 570, more tax. Rate is not a number that seems like a little unfortunate. It's not seem like peach Ridge as much of a rate,

Unknown Speaker  06:48
looks like the state what the

Speaker 3  07:06
with the world. So we have

Matthias Miller  07:10
but it's missing. 475, 567, hang on,

Speaker 2  07:16
475, now for into the next two columns over is the county rate, 2250,

Matthias Miller  07:26
and then the other rate. So we have it takes us to seven, 13% what?

Unknown Speaker  07:34
What is the other rate? 13%

Speaker 1  07:45
give me a favor. Give me, give me the account number that you're looking at right there.

Matthias Miller  07:53
I don't know Jeffrey Carter, Jeff hurry, J, E, F, F, E, R, Y,

Unknown Speaker  08:00
said last name, Jeffrey Carter. Carter,

Matthias Miller  08:05
oh, we need to look at the harder, harder guy.

Unknown Speaker  08:10
Oh, yeah,

Matthias Miller  08:16
what is the city tax and city tax rate? I

Unknown Speaker  08:23
his tax rate in in here is showing 7%

Speaker 2  08:33
NC, okay, tax zone, TJ, something something something, contract, maintenance

Matthias Miller  08:44
tax, city rate. Wait, why is this giving a

Unknown Speaker  08:52
tax, county rate, city?

Matthias Miller  09:01
Well, I mean, we should probably put in the city rate here, not

Matthias Miller  09:12
okay now it's now we're safe. Yeah, that's going to help. I

Unknown Speaker  09:23
Jeffrey Carter

Matthias Miller  09:29
and the other rate is the total rate, not the contract other taxable tax rate, wait is that is the other tax, tax zone.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
Tax zones, other taxable.

Matthias Miller  10:03
So is that, but that can't be the is it really 7%

Unknown Speaker  10:12
Hang on, I'm hanging

Speaker 1  10:15
does it give me there was, does it give me the ID of the tax zone in somewhere as TJ? Something, something, something, I can get you that.

Unknown Speaker  10:29
TJ 0351,

Speaker 1  10:32
I'm hunting this tax zone. TJ, 0351,

Matthias Miller  10:38
come on. Oh, that's not Yeah, because the full tax rate's 7% that's got to be, right? The county rate is actually not. It literally is. The county rate literally is.

Speaker 3  10:55
That's weird, though there's we're missing. It's point

Matthias Miller  11:01
0475, 475, percent, and then the county rate.

Speaker 1  11:05
I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you a screenshot of the sales tax table, because I don't know what, what. I think the other thing we could just pretty much disregard. I think it'll make a little bit more sense Once you see the table. There's a table,

Unknown Speaker  11:40
table, um,

Speaker 1  11:40
so he has a total rate, a state rate, accounting rate, city rate, and that's it. There's no other others, whether it's taxable or not. Other is, this is the but I don't understand why there's a number in there, in your other category column.

Matthias Miller  11:58
Well, because he pulled the other taxable field,

Matthias Miller  12:08
or he pulled it off of he thought this was a something I don't know,

Speaker 1  12:13
but I think we can disregard it. No, yeah,

Matthias Miller  12:20
okay, now, now, let's go back to that haha, guy, haha, our heart, because I still wasn't getting the 1200 or, whoops, I did not want to do

Unknown Speaker  12:33
that. We do. We ever figure out the 1930

Matthias Miller  12:36
well, okay, I wasn't coming out to an even 100. Was it supposed to or was it, I said, stop it, or, because I'm coming out to 14 8070

Unknown Speaker  12:50
on the cash down,

Unknown Speaker  12:58
14 8070 as the cash down, wait a minute, stop it, stop it, Stop

Speaker 1  13:13
it. So let me see. Where's my cookie.

Unknown Speaker  13:18
Later. Glado, well,

Speaker 1  13:33
there's that $19.30 yet that we hadn't accounted for, that which seems to be applied to nothing. So I don't know what even what to do with it. So it doesn't I'm pretty I'm I'm

Speaker 2  13:47
fairly certain that I don't know who ASB was.

Matthias Miller  13:56
It is tied to the receipt. There's a 1930 on the receipt.

Speaker 1  14:05
Okay, here's what I would say that we do beings that that $19.30 Well, wait a second, the $19.30 also gets spent at the very, very end as well. So we do need to account it for, yeah, but it gets spent off of nothing too. So obviously there was this random dollar value that got assigned in here that I don't know what to tell you to do with.

Matthias Miller  14:30
Do you can you see anything on your end? Well, okay, keep in mind he's 2021

Speaker 1  14:37
Yeah, so we could theoretically ignore him completely. Because he closed out. Oh no, he closed out in 520, 2024, so that's why we were including Yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:50
yeah, 1930 so where's the 1930 this guy is where we you. Like, the only thing that we have to time in here is the receipt. How does, how does it

Speaker 1  15:09
show this here, I'm going to show you, I'm going to I'm going to show you how RTO pro shows this. I'm going to show you all of the supposed valid transactions. And then I'm going to show you this little bottom piece where it was, I don't know what, what exactly was going on here. Here's the bottom piece.

Matthias Miller  15:25
Then the contract is blank here, and the payment history is on the account. So apparently you can have deposits that are linked to the account.

Unknown Speaker  15:40
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  15:47
Well, that's fun.

Matthias Miller  15:51
That is real fun. The

Unknown Speaker  15:56
question is, how much of an outlier is this?

Matthias Miller  15:59
Well, let's do this. Wouldn't, wouldn't we want to see.

Matthias Miller  16:10
How do we know it's a deposit again, it's if it's a

Unknown Speaker  16:24
if the total, if this number

Matthias Miller  16:29
is non zero. So let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  16:36
Where's my sum?

Unknown Speaker  17:14
Steps, it is invalid resource data on history.

Matthias Miller  17:28
Hey, let me know. See, I know you would, I mean only like,

Unknown Speaker  17:37
I don't know, 6000 I

Matthias Miller  17:45
like, here's Denise

Speaker 1  17:47
MC kibben. Can we? Can we add another grouping here so we can see how many customers this is to group by account number or contract number or something, so that we can, so we can get an idea of what this is do.

Unknown Speaker  18:11
This let's do

Speaker 2  18:16
and then do totals only. So we, oh yeah, okay, number,

Matthias Miller  18:21
oh yeah, no, you need to do

Unknown Speaker  18:26
call column, and then we show,

Unknown Speaker  18:39
okay, fine. It is now.

Unknown Speaker  18:56
Okay, well, it's growing.

Matthias Miller  19:08
Maybe, okay, I guess it's a rolling sum. We're seeing, 97

Unknown Speaker  19:18
No, those are those guys. Wow.

Speaker 3  19:31
Silly, silly. Okay, Run, little buddy. Run. What? When 2500 2500

Unknown Speaker  19:50
that what accounts,

Speaker 1  19:53
yeah, but I'm, but I mean, what I was, what I was trying to get my hands on, is like. Like accounts like har that we got to figure out,

Unknown Speaker  20:08
which, I guess there's really no good way to know that

Matthias Miller  20:11
is there. Well, I mean, it's the if the transaction date is,

Matthias Miller  20:20
assume if there's no transaction, none of these transactions happen after the cutoff date. What are we doing? January one of 24 Sure.

Matthias Miller  20:54
1300 can we? Can we look up some of these, like, Give me something to look up. What in the hang was Walter. Jeannie. Walter, doing,

Unknown Speaker  21:10
get a, get a. You got an account number or contract number

Matthias Miller  21:15
3174, account 3174, okay. Ew.

Speaker 1  21:24
Painful. We got A's and B's and I don't even, oh, man.

Speaker 1  21:47
Well, go over to your, go over to your, your your history report and put in that 3174, and then gross out. Well, I

Matthias Miller  22:20
mean, it's not like you have to do it right the first time. What the hang were they doing?

Speaker 1  22:33
Francine botched this one up. Somebody botched this up. Bad.

Matthias Miller  22:47
This is where it would make is there a world in which we could eliminate receipts that happen on is it the same day and zero out.

Speaker 1  23:02
There's a whole bunch of stuff that's like, crossed out and deleted, and I wish we could just ignore these. How can we identify them that they're

Speaker 3  23:10
we have a way to identify deleted ones somehow. Well, not necessarily.

Speaker 1  23:16
Look for receipt number 020084700, 84700, yeah, so what? What makes this guy unique? Like, whoa, okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:30
Oh, there's two of them.

Matthias Miller  23:33
I did not mean to do that. Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:40
No. B, what's the B? The B, the B,

Speaker 1  23:48
read off several the B read the numbers, Read the receipt numbers off of the B, ones, 02008, because, I mean, there is a couple B, but then there's P's also that are crossed out. I was reading x's for a win, huh?

Speaker 3  24:02
And x's and x's, I don't know what the x's are. X's are something.

Unknown Speaker  24:17
It's like this thing got loaded and thrown out several times,

Speaker 1  24:24
3174, I have no idea. Okay, actually, let's go. Let's go read notes. What happened? Somebody tell me what happened here?

Matthias Miller  24:37
It was a mix up there. It was going on the wrong contract, because when they quit, it went on the a contract instead of the B contract.

Speaker 1  24:46
Okay, so on 625, 2024 Francine says wrong serial number on was on the contract and there should have been serial number 3153, reversed history and spent purchase reserve that. In the deposit, deleted serial 2617, and attached 3153, and added the payment history back into the account through the back end.

Unknown Speaker  25:10
Well, that made it ugly.

Speaker 1  25:15
So they had the wrong building attached, and the only way that they could get it, they had to go kill the account in order to attach the right building.

Matthias Miller  25:28
Okay, well, here's if

Matthias Miller  25:35
I had to be

Unknown Speaker  25:37
we have a we have a much better solution, don't we detach the building and put the right one on. Yeah, for real.

Matthias Miller  25:49
RTO Pro has the concept of a non contract customer deposit.

Unknown Speaker  25:55
Ew, I think,

Matthias Miller  25:59
like when you do this stuff, I'm going to guess at some point the contract became unavailable. It had to put the money somewhere so you don't lose it, probably.

Unknown Speaker  26:13
So that's weird.

Speaker 1  26:54
What we need to do is we need to come up with a bulletproof way to programmatically evaluate these things and always come out with the right answer.

Matthias Miller  27:09
Well, it seems like one of the ways to do this. I mean, if we can just pick the right contract, we can just throw the security deposit on the right contract. It seems like

Unknown Speaker  27:25
I did not follow that. Wait a minute,

Matthias Miller  27:33
like we're gonna run into

Speaker 1  27:35
well, okay, so when, when? When you reverse, I presume that when you're well, maybe it is security deposit always lives on the on the customer record level. Because if she really, truly did this, where she reversed the whole thing, and it would have reversed into the deposit, like when in RTO Pro, their concept is, when you reverse a purchase reserve, it reverses into the deposit account.

Matthias Miller  28:09
Okay, if I buy two contracts from you, can I put a security deposit on one and not the other one? Can I say, hey, that security deposit I gave you, I want to use it for this building

Unknown Speaker  28:24
over here. Oh, good question.

Matthias Miller  28:25
Hold on. I mean, I mean from a from a contractual standpoint, primarily, ah,

Matthias Miller  29:05
growth of all terms of this agreement. I mean, it seems to be tied to the agreement.

Speaker 2  29:10
I am okay. So let's go to the let's go to the deposit table.

Speaker 1  29:24
In your source data. And let's see if it's let's, is it tied to a is it tied to contract and account, or just account?

Matthias Miller  29:40
Well, let's go to let's see once what the schema says.

Matthias Miller  29:53
So we have description transaction.

Speaker 1  30:00
Good number, no you want, no you want. Customer deposits or

Unknown Speaker  30:08
customer no

Matthias Miller  30:12
guess or deposits. Deposit an account in a store.

Speaker 1  30:15
Deposit Account and store, so. So I think the deposit account goes with the customer, and not with the contract,

Matthias Miller  30:25
but legally, the way this contract is written,

Speaker 1  30:29
legally, it should go with the contract. 100% that's not how RTO pro thought about it. And so therefore, hence, the reason that you can move money into a non contract, connected amount, good,

Speaker 3  30:46
okay, the oh, this is ugly.

Speaker 1  30:56
We have the correct model. The deposit amount lives with the contract.

Matthias Miller  31:01
Okay, so I think the question is, can we properly infer are all receipts always what's the question I'm trying to ask?

Unknown Speaker  31:14
Are all

Matthias Miller  31:16
receipts always for the same count number? That's the question I'm trying to ask. Let me let's go find out. I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  31:29
Don't think I fully understood what you said, but you

Matthias Miller  31:32
don't think it's true.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
I'm making a judgment call and not even understanding what you

Matthias Miller  31:40
said. Okay, so we have this guy,

Unknown Speaker  31:44
we have so ultimately, what I'm looking to do,

Matthias Miller  31:50
let's group by the

Matthias Miller  32:08
I group by receipt. We are going to do totals and subtitles only going to sort by we're

Matthias Miller  32:25
contract, remove you. Because why do you have to always bug me and then remove duplicate sorts? Then we're going to do one. And here's a sum, okay, I'm

Speaker 3  32:45
Yeah, then we're going to do a Type list,

Matthias Miller  32:57
and we're going to make you fat.

Matthias Miller  33:07
We're going to exclude blanks. See now, as soon as you load, we're going to sort you. Ah, I said, sort you. We're sort by total. We're going to do negative one so that biggest one's at the bottom. Okay. Ah, try to mess with me. Now.

Matthias Miller  33:44
In the extreme cases,

Matthias Miller  34:02
I see what's going on with this guy?

Unknown Speaker  34:05
Maybe trans.

Matthias Miller  34:12
My contract set Mel green, 10727, he that's one of them. Yeah. Contract account,

Unknown Speaker  34:28
205 Mel green, 205 Yep.

Matthias Miller  34:31
What happened on September, the October 6 of 2009 of 2009

Unknown Speaker  34:40
October 6 of 2009

Unknown Speaker  34:47
let me get these old ones out. Okay,

Speaker 2  34:53
okay, he heard, he Wow. He had a bunch of buildings. He had. 12345, buildings, five contracts.

Unknown Speaker  35:13
Check number 9174,

Matthias Miller  35:26
okay, is there a way?

Unknown Speaker  35:35
Yeah, five contracts. You got them right there.

Matthias Miller  35:38
Could we do something like, if, if if you have a blank contract, then we on receipts With blank contracts, we tie it out

Unknown Speaker  35:57
for the earliest

Matthias Miller  36:06
basically the lowest, hokey with it, with the contract. We just pick a contract, we stick with it.

Matthias Miller  36:20
Or do we, or do we need to take a look at when it was paid out? Do we need to look at the other way to do it is say, go to okay, if you have any receipts that don't have a contract, then go find the earliest, the case, the earliest instance and the latest? No, they're not tied to the same receipt number.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
Can we test, can we test your theory on something?

Matthias Miller  36:48
I do have one question. First, these, there's no way to link the Okay, sure. Test my theory. Like, I mean, like, basically what you would do here is we have this one's just bonkers. So this one's not tied to anything we take the receipt net, but see it's not tied by receipt number. So we don't know, we don't know when this money comes out.

Unknown Speaker  37:21
Now we could see,

Matthias Miller  37:26
okay, here's an idea, if we have a history without a contract, wait, no, this is fine. This is actually not the problem. It's it was this other guy who's a problem because we don't know which of the contracts we actually want to deal with, and we don't know when they're actually going to use this. No.

Matthias Miller  38:07
The main thing is, if you okay, but let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  38:13
Let's also check

Matthias Miller  38:18
this only matters. Okay. Here's the next question. Do you ever have a security deposit tied to a customer?

Unknown Speaker  38:46
Okay, what's the Boolean in your question?

Unknown Speaker  38:49
I don't even know,

Matthias Miller  38:54
because theoretically, you want, I mean, with their model, technically, I don't know if this happens, but technically, you could rent a building, put down a building deposit, rent another building, put down another building deposit, or whatever, and then you literally

Speaker 1  39:12
could close out all the contracts and leave a deposit, or leave it, leave money in the

Matthias Miller  39:16
deposit you start with, and then you can close out your

Speaker 1  39:19
have A, I actually have a SQL string, a SQL report of this. Where is this guy?

Unknown Speaker  39:34
No,

Matthias Miller  39:56
I thought I did effectively what you want to know. So, oh, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  40:15
what just happened.

Unknown Speaker  40:21
Well, that was weird. I just crashed it. I love his stupid whatever.

Unknown Speaker  40:42
Okay customers with deposit balance with no active agreements. Currently, I have three

Unknown Speaker  40:52
that have,

Speaker 2  40:55
that are customers with no active agreements. Okay, where's my account number? Okay, let's look up 39250,

Unknown Speaker  41:19
she doesn't have a

Unknown Speaker  41:30
wellness. Strange. Why is this report saying that she has a She doesn't want deposit balance?

Unknown Speaker  41:55
Oh, my ma'am. I'm

Unknown Speaker  42:12
seems like this should be easier. I

Matthias Miller  42:50
it does seem like it should be, doesn't it? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  43:11
I don't understand why this is saying that that's so dumb these guys don't have deposit balances.

Speaker 2  43:35
Select from customers where deposit is greater than zero and account not in select from contracts where status like open, huh? Yeah, well, how might we do greater or less than see if it likes that? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:58
It didn't like that.

Unknown Speaker  44:06
Yeah, I don't know why it's doing that. Oh,

Speaker 1  44:32
and like every single one of these comes when, pretty much a situation where something was tried to fit be fixed.

Unknown Speaker  44:51
Well, if it's okay, let's, let's,

Matthias Miller  44:57
let's pace, because why not? Um. Um, it seems to me like

Speaker 1  45:11
I wish. I wish there was a way to identify these payments that, like he shows them, crossed out, obviously something was done with them in the back end history, something or other. I wish there was a way to to identify that so that we could just disregard those transactions, because that would actually simplify it.

Matthias Miller  45:28
Okay, if we would just discard which transaction? Cleanup transactions, where it's just added and removed.

Speaker 1  45:33
Yeah, cleanup transactions, but it doesn't seem like there's anything that defines them as a cleanup transaction.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
I that I can see

Unknown Speaker  45:54
which, which, who are you on?

Speaker 3  45:57
I'm on the Lisa. Jeannie Walter, oh. Jeannie Walter, oh. Jeannie Walter, what's the account? Number? 3174, so 14.

Matthias Miller  46:16
I mean, theoretically, what you could do, would this get us in trouble?

Unknown Speaker  46:21
If you would, by account

Matthias Miller  46:27
look for all security deposits

Matthias Miller  46:39
on the same day. That total out to each other.

Speaker 1  46:50
Well that could, if you would, you would probably get really, really close to

Matthias Miller  46:56
No, but you still have this guy, like, randomly this 1488 shows up. Yeah, because you got to account for this difference.

Speaker 1  47:09
And there's, there's one, there's a bunch on 617, 24 Well, 617, 513, four, eight, where they they reversed a bunch of transactions.

Matthias Miller  47:23
A what a giant, absolute malarkey. It really is a case of, hey, we got to squirrel away some money somewhere. How do we do it?

Unknown Speaker  47:42
Go to, Okay, hang on, good,

Matthias Miller  47:48
genuinely, genuinely,

Matthias Miller  48:01
okay. Here's how you have to do it. You start with where this, the security deposit gets used, and you figure out, because we should be able,

Unknown Speaker  48:20
well, maybe not. What happens

Matthias Miller  48:23
if you have a security deposit? Well, and if a security deposit is used on multiple transactions, you just pick the contract with the biggest payment amount of or whatever something, and hope that security deposit never spans multiple. And if you do, it spans multiple, then you have to split it, and that's painful. But then you work backwards from there, and you you then say that money paid into this security deposit, I think you have to have a completely separate import that looks at each security deposit. Well, just for security deposits, because you're going to have to split you you're gonna have to figure out what it got used for, and it could have gotten used for multiple contracts. And so you're gonna have to and then reverse engineer when you're paying into the security deposit.

Speaker 1  49:36
What? What that is? What? And there's no history on the deposit table, like there's no way that we can, we can cross reference some of this history. He just straight up updated the deposit record. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  49:59
Do. I mean, the bottom line is that he Okay, here's, could we do? Okay? This is janky. I hate it, but maybe it's a way to do it. What if we had a customer a $0 could we create $0 rental contracts for security deposits for customers like this and and you would have to allow your security deposit to go negative, but at the end of the day, it would all kind of work out. So

Speaker 1  50:43
yeah, so then, how would you how would you use the how would you use it to pay off a contract?

Matthias Miller  50:52
Well, in your payment, you would pay out of a out of the dummy contract into the real security deposit con. Well, you would do it in the payment. The payment would be paying for multiple security deposits, or would be sorry, it would be tied to multiple contracts, and it would pull security deposits out of one contract and use it to pay for another one.

Speaker 1  51:21
Can you reliably identify these deposit transactions? Because I understand where you're going with that. Because essentially what you're doing is you're using a contract to build the history of the of the deposit record.

Matthias Miller  51:36
Well, of the non contractual deposits, not all deposits, just non contractual ones. Oh, gotcha

Unknown Speaker  51:46
so you Okay, okay. I mean, in theory, it makes sense.

Matthias Miller  52:04
The weird thing is, I think you're going to end up with, no, it's going to work, because he's not adding that in. He's using that on the payment, right? You okay?

Speaker 1  52:26
So essentially, what you're saying is you're going to go do basically payment history on any amounts of money that are not tied to a contract. So you can track the ins and outs, and then if we end up with with money there, then you in order to pay, in order to make your payment match up for the contract that he then paid for you then suck it for one contract over into the other.

Matthias Miller  52:45
Yeah, I don't even know if you suck it into the other. I think you just, you just the payment record itself just gets tied out to two different contracts. You're paying for two contracts. You're paying for your dummy the security deposit contract, and you're paying for your actual building contract, and they balance each other out, and you have a $0 payment. Or, you know, whatever,

Unknown Speaker  53:18
I'm open to it, as long as it's defensible.

Matthias Miller  53:22
Well, defensible to who an attorney?

Speaker 1  53:25
No, I mean, as long as when, okay, I can accept a lot of this risk internally. But what I'm saying is that when we go, when we go do this for other clients, import, as long as we can quantify, quantifiably explain exactly what's taking place and why it's taking place. And it balances out, I'm fine with it, long as I can explain.

Matthias Miller  53:54
Here's the explanation. Okay, you know how when you sign that paper contract, it says this security deposit is for this contract can be used, maybe used to cover the liability of this contract. You understand you get that? Yeah, yeah, that makes sense, all right, so you know how legally that's you can't really use it for something else. Yeah, yeah. Well, here's the thing. RTO pro said, screw the paper. Like, this is just, sometimes it's, it's the customer deposit goes to contract. Sometimes it just goes to the customer. Well, we're, we run a tight ship around here. We said, Man, that sounds wow, like that's, that's just not right. We don't know what to do. It really, legally has to be tied to a contract. So we've said, Well, the best thing we know to do, because RTO pro just dropped the ball. You have to be a lot less pejorative and derogatory than this. We said, well, we're just going to create a contract, because that's and we'll just use. Have a contract that just lives for the security deposit that hangs out in outer space. We don't know where it's supposed to go to there is no contract assigned to it. In fact, you can pull up our to pro if you want to see you see this payment here. Where does that that's not tied to a contract. I mean, it got paid to that one. It came from this other one.

Speaker 1  55:17
Can we generate a contract that does not have repayment terms? I would

Matthias Miller  55:22
just generate a $0 contract

Unknown Speaker  55:25
and put it in the security deposit.

Unknown Speaker  55:27
Yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  55:31
I mean, let's try it. What the heck?

Unknown Speaker  55:34
What the heck.

Unknown Speaker  55:37
I mean, all right, idea you had yet.

Matthias Miller  55:41
I mean, I think it should work. I guess I wouldn't have recommended it. I suggested if I didn't have some plausibility, have some plausibility.

Speaker 1  55:49
It's not ability or the thought that it would work. It's the part we missed that when it just doesn't work.

Matthias Miller  55:56
Yeah, no lie. Okay. So now we need a

Speaker 1  56:00
What does Addison say? Never contribute to malice, what is just sheer incompetence. Okay, fine.

Matthias Miller  56:10
People are stupid.

Unknown Speaker  56:11
This is true.

Matthias Miller  56:15
Unfortunately, I am also in that category

Speaker 1  56:18
of what people being stupid? No, people. Well, you know, as long as you don't get the the account tag of being stupid, you'll be good, right?

Unknown Speaker  56:30
Well, that's fair.

Matthias Miller  56:36
Where is my sum? Sum? A contracts primary, I should have a sum here, paid down,

Matthias Miller  56:57
CRA amount. That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking at the this guy, wanting this guy,

Unknown Speaker  57:10
this guy, And

Matthias Miller  57:19
we're gonna go right back here. We do new global macro. We're

Unknown Speaker  57:36
gonna face this kind of stuff in the future. And I think we have a

Unknown Speaker  57:41
rock solid, defensible platform that you can

Speaker 1  57:46
be audited by the SEC and be able to trace the money. This right here, I don't even know how you trace the money.

Matthias Miller  57:52
Oh, it's a, can you imagine an audit, if somebody you know, I mean, it's not even, I mean, it's like, can you imagine all of these 2500 contracts, 3000 whatever the 1000s are, pull out the contract, prove that you made a mistake, prove that security deposit actually belonged over it was a bookkeeping it was all right. So RTO, let's do Seth. Seth and Dwayne. Can you have someone stand standard? Is this macro? Okay, so then we have, we should probably go ahead and save this as service contracts, non contract security deposits.

Unknown Speaker  58:55
Jasper, who's Jasper,

Matthias Miller  58:57
intern, hey, a free work. Free work, exactly, all right, so we have, if not is NA or zero, this and is NA, RB, source, data, history, contract, I'm

Matthias Miller  59:25
okay, let's start with that silver loom, ID,

Unknown Speaker  59:34
RP, source.

Speaker 2  59:41
stores.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
A marks My words I

Speaker 3  1:00:48
did not want to do that. You doofus,

Matthias Miller  1:00:59
okay? The customer. This would be

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
source data.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
The asset. Do you have to have an asset? Assets required, isn't it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
for the contract? Yeah, probably.

Matthias Miller  1:01:34
So ideally, we would have one asset.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:37
You'd have to spin up a $0 asset,

Matthias Miller  1:01:41
and that could be shared across all company. I mean, each company could have their own, right, a single, single security deposit asset.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
Can you share a single asset across multiple contracts?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
Probably force it in there. Well, if we can force,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:02:14
I would almost rather create a scenario where on imported records we don't require an asset. Ooh, or at least these types of

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
I like the idea. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
Okay, we're going to do no Asset

Matthias Miller  1:03:01
overwrite the F value,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
Max expression,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
Oak State I don't get how

Matthias Miller  1:04:00
balloon tax soon? Oh, This gray.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
Well, we don't have tax. I

Matthias Miller  1:04:27
it's a security deposit that's that makes it easy. Contract ID, ha, ha, okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:04:54
hello. All right, I will give you the short version, not the i. Not the long version, but short version is that when you sign a contract, the security deposit is for that contract. RTO Pro, on the other hand, says, well, sometimes you need to squirrel money away and move security deposits between accounts, and so let's just let you assign. Let's just have you allow security deposits not tied to a contract.

Speaker 1  1:05:22
Why don't ask why it's, it's, it's just useless information.

Matthias Miller  1:05:31
Stop asking questions, like just put your head down and work. Go dumb, follow the rules. So my proposal, what I'm planning to do is create for any of any, any customers who have this, create a contract with something like a like a customer, deposit, 1234, ID, and create, Sorry, create a contract that captures all this free, $0 contract, not tied to an asset that gotcha all this stuff, just so that we have a place to finish.

Speaker 4  1:06:07
Yeah. And then was pull it from this. Why a history record would ever replace a replace an asset? But that makes that Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:06:20
yeah, that's, you know, there's, there are reasons.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:29
So anyway

Speaker 4  1:06:34
sounds good. See you in eight minutes, then eight minutes sounds good. Also, I wrote, I very much appreciate your marks, my words, comment that brought me great joy. Just lost it over here, anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:06:52
contract resolution, how do we know if it's, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:28
Okay, well, we'll table

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
that contract status

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
that'll get handled.

Matthias Miller  1:07:36
So this will just do an RTR.

Matthias Miller  1:07:44
Guess you could do an RTR. It's probably better just to do this, because it's better supported at this point, this would be a standard contract.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:05
The CRA amount,

Matthias Miller  1:08:16
security deposit amount, we'll start with Zero, I think, and then Add payments to it.

Matthias Miller  1:08:43
Contract date,

Matthias Miller  1:09:30
contract terms, which terms to be, what on it

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
isn't that in the data.

Matthias Miller  1:09:41
I mean, this is for the fake contracts. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:52
yeah, because we don't have a zero term,

Matthias Miller  1:09:55
we'll do a 60. I don't know though a 36 month would be the say. Fist. Sure, I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
don't know why you say that, but okay.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
I mean, like most people would have, everybody has a 36 not everybody would have a

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11
60, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
It doesn't really matter. Anyway,

Speaker 3  1:10:17
okay, pay off discount.

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
Cash price percentage, can this be 100

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:10:36
sales tax stake is nothing. Rate is NA, nothing, Na, nothing.

Speaker 1  1:10:45
Do we have, do we have a, do we have a sales tax exempt function?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:55
Not at this point, I don't think,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
and it's something we're going to need to address. Okay, is this?

Matthias Miller  1:11:07
Do you like this format? Do you want to format it differently? Do you want underscores in here?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:13
No, what you had is fine.

Matthias Miller  1:11:20
Look at that. That's a thing of beauty.

Speaker 1  1:11:23
So this would be all customer deposits you are pushing into a contract record, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:31
Why do we have some?

Matthias Miller  1:11:40
Yeah, they came in since last night.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:43
Oh, probably

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
two, eight. No, that's 24 not 20. But no, well,

Matthias Miller  1:11:53
with the transaction, but are you sure that? No, never mind. That's dumb. I didn't say that. I

Matthias Miller  1:12:15
Why do we not have 4483,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:19
store, two, customer.

Matthias Miller  1:12:28
We weren't able to create the account for some reason, and I don't know why, yet, I'm just

Speaker 1  1:12:33
gonna guess missing Do we have a missing customer account?

Matthias Miller  1:12:36
It's probably a validation error or something that it didn't like. And I'm not in the mood to get distracted to chase that at the moment, but it would be good thing to chase.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
But that's something Nick could chase.

Speaker 3  1:13:04
Yeah, yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
Well, that's not looking good RP source contract. Well, it's not the RP source contract. We need

Matthias Miller  1:13:36
the Okay, now we actually need this guy.

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
All right, we can't run it but, but then over here, what we would do on the payment side.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:05
Here they come. All right, well, that's progress. We were closer. We were closer. Boom.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
You guys, hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:28
Howdy. Howdy,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:32
all right, well, happy 2026 happy 2020.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39
Going Live, and this year,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
this year, when you say it that way, that makes

Speaker 1  1:14:48
it, that makes it feel a little bit more real than a couple days ago.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:53
Yeah, it's coming up.

Speaker 1  1:14:58
It's kind of like the inevitable. Feeling as you crest the top of a roller coaster, top of the of the climb in the inevitable, you suddenly realize that I'm about to go really, really fast and go down Scary, scary things, and there's nothing you can do about it, about right? Probably going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride these contract imports, Nick we're still not there yet. Just saying

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
there's something you want me to do about that.

Speaker 4  1:15:31
No, just make snarky comments and send them to Dwayne time to time.

Matthias Miller  1:15:37
Yep, snark and humor are welcome in large doses.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:41
Well, marks my words.

Matthias Miller  1:15:50
All right, so I don't really feel like, you know grand state of the world is, it's it's here. I think everybody's kind of gotta shake the cobwebs out of the holiday sugar craze and days and and maybe you guys are better at it than we are. So most of what Dwayne and I have been focusing on Dwayne and Nick and Dwayne and Nick and Dwayne and I have been focusing on is data imports, fun, latest, latest little tidbit from that is that apparently in RTO pro security deposits can be tied out directly to the customer instead of directly to a contract. And so we're going to have to create fake contracts to time out to get the import in. So anyway, hey, Jasper, welcome Dwayne. Do you have anything? And Dwayne and I are hoping to get our heads together. Actually, we were planning to, I don't know Dwayne got his tickets, but we're planning to get our heads together for a couple days in a couple weeks, and hopefully, hopefully have enough progress in the imports that we can start. What I personally want to do is start ripping deep into spring. Well, I don't know, move towards spring priorities, really, mid late? Yeah, I don't know, February. Maybe we won't get much past that, but

Unknown Speaker  1:17:23
start pushing, pushing through some of that.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27
So here's what I have to say. In January 16 of 2025

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
I wrote down a number of things I was praying about. One of those things that I wrote down

Speaker 1  1:17:40
is I said, I need a salesperson for our company, and I need a salesperson like and I named two individuals in that note that I wrote down. The one individual, I put a tag right behind it that says, this seems impossible that we could ever hire an individual like this because of where he currently is, and what he's currently doing, and the caliber of salesperson this this individual is that was before we even had the idea that we were going to go off and build software. That didn't come until about July of that same year, mid beginning of December, this individual and I are really good friends, by the way, just, just so you know, we're not, we're not disconnected individuals. We're very close friends. I've joked to him many times that if he ever decides to leave where he's currently at, I want to, I want to hire him. And it was always a joke. The beginning of December, the person that I said it would be impossible to actually hire. Texts me and says, what would it look like to come work for you guys, to which over the Christmas holidays, right after Christmas, after my family was here, him and his wife flew in here, and we spent the next about three days hammering out what it would look like for him to come sell our services as a company and the software. If this individual, which I can't name him yet, because he's not, he's not, we don't have it completely finalized. If this individual comes on board, he has extensive RTO industry knowledge. He comes from a rather large size rent to own company, and he is going to make more work than I know what to do with.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:30
It will cause a good problems.

Speaker 1  1:19:31
It will cause a problem. I said to him, I said, here's the deal. I can't afford you, so the only way you can come work for us is you got to go bring enough work to actually pay for yourself. For yourself. And to which he said, I can do that. So here's the deal. We sat down, Leanne and I, after they left, Leanne and I sat down and did 2026, projections. And. Planning and, yeah, it's if, if it goes where I expect it to, based on this individual's history as a as an individual, that can, that can bring on RTO clients, that can bring on potential RTO companies for management, I'm going to, yeah, we, I will be the our company. We will be the bottleneck as to how fast we can grow. What that means is that we've got to get this project done, and we got to get it done. The sooner the better. Because he's like, I want to start, I want to start talking to RTO clients. And I'm like, you do know we're not done, right? He's like, Yeah, I know you're not done. Like, but like, come on. Like, let's go. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what that means exactly yet, but my my projections, I would have been really the day we reached 30 clients, I was going to be really, really happy. I think that I expect to do that. We let no let me put it this way, we will. I expect him to bring, put up clients to us at a rate that we will have an onboarding problem pretty heavily so there's my interesting news for the end and beginning of the year. I, I am super excited, because what it means is that potentially, this individual will be buying into our company. And he's always wanted to be, he always, he's always wanted to have ownership in a company, because his in a long conversation that we had, we talked a lot about the fact that he he feels like he's spent a lot of time growing other individuals companies, and yet he's never grown anything of his own. And so this would be an opportunity for him to come and grow and be a part of growing something of his own. And so, yeah, super, super, super excited. Matthias is dying to know who it is, and I can't, I can't quite say yet. So the moment, the moment I'll put this is the last thing I'll say about the moment we say out loud who it is, and the moment we are allowed to say it to the industry, it's going to make some very interesting waves in the industry. It just will. I'm just hoping I'm not going to make an enemy out of the company he's leaving from. So that's the only that's the only bad part.

Speaker 4  1:22:32
Oh, exciting times. Has he seen the software what we have so far? Yeah, yeah. Impressions are overall positive.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42
Then, well, or what? I actually,

Speaker 1  1:22:48
okay, I can't say that. Then, if I said that out loud, then Matthias would know exactly who it is. Yes, he has seen the software and they he's he's there. He is quite impressed. Yes,

Speaker 1  1:23:07
I should make, I should make Matthias sign an NDA, and then I could just say things

Matthias Miller  1:23:12
out loud. I told you, I'm happy to it's like Christmas after Christmas, all the secrets going around about, you know, man, that's funny. I think Dwayne, I think you do a better job at TED Talks than I do if you want to put teeth behind, like, right guys, come on. Like, there you go.

Speaker 1  1:23:32
Well, it I will say this. I we like, there's a speed that we can go at, like, obviously, it's like, there's only so fast that you can that you can resolve a lot of this import stuff. But it's like, I, what I want to say to you guys is that the pressure is on. There is we. I already have a rather decent list of people, fairly large size companies, that I think will onboard the moment I can say that I have onboarded myself, and I've successfully onboarded, you know, X amount of of companies. And here's what the process has been that is going to I feel like release the floodgates to move forward on this, and because it, it's really until we've done this, like until we've successfully onboarded ourselves and we've onboarded some other companies, there's always going to be kind of a hesitancy, you know, from individuals, to really pull the trigger on this. But when, when we do, I have no doubt, like, as I was, as I was going through and building contract definitions as I was going and building, just putting a lot of manufacturers and dealers and working on sales reps and linked individuals like this kind of level of capability to track your client. List as an RTO company to have very clear understanding of what governs what, and especially as we walk through kind of parsing the the history data, we're going to come out on the other side of this with a defensible history. I'm still confident, even though some days between between working with Nick for a while now. Now, Matthias has got his biggest some days, I'm not so confident we're going to be defensible at when it's all said and done, because RTO Pro is a mess. I mean, it is. It is hard to, you know, you know, if Matthias and I are struggling over here to make sense of this, you know, it's a bit of a mess. But I feel like once it's done, we will be very defensible. And, man, I really cannot, I cannot wait. And so far, our to Pro has not kicked us out of our current processor. We're still processing with clearance, and we're kind of just sort of playing a gamble right now. So if I if there's one huge motivation, it is this. It doesn't have to work perfectly, but we do need to be able to process credit cards. And if we can process credit cards, I'll limp a lot if I can have two things, like, if we can process credit cards and we can be in and customers can process their own credit cards as well. So yeah. I mean, it's,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:23
there's pressure here,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
hey, well, shall we give our updates?

Speaker 4  1:26:37
Sorry, I took, I took all the time. It's just fine. I mean, it's clearly been holidays, so we haven't it's slowed down a lot. Then the last week or two, it's ramped up a fair bit. Again, I don't think I really have a lot to show. I've been working through the client proposal, getting actually, I do have something to show. Let me show the items I have, the jobs I have queued up. These are the 18 or so jobs that we're hoping to knock out in the next week and a half. I'd love to have them mainly done by the end of next week, but it's, it's those early January items. We can't there's no way we can have them done this week, hopefully largely by the end of next week. I don't know for sure. It's largely Okay. Depreciation, calc is the one really big piece in there. Other than that, it's a good number of cleanup items. And then hex, getting checks and deposits are probably two of the bigger pieces in there, and giving those to link with bills and payments and all of that. So that's where a lot of our work is. Sean's done a bunch of work to try to refactor checks from assist and make sure that's still working there, while giving us something usable here. Yeah. So most of my time has been spent on specking out those jobs and helping Sean, and then I'm starting in on the sales tax liability so that we can file sales tax.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:08
Yeah, that's my side.

Speaker 5  1:28:13
I've been working on finishing out the authentication flow. And so I'm going to share my screen and we can walk through that.

Speaker 5  1:28:26
So we've got a new customer here. They have a contract ID here, copy that, and then we'll give them an email address.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
So now,

Speaker 5  1:28:46
so now they can go to their register, and this is pulling the the branding from, well, it isn't from their rental co yet. That's one training piece, but that is pulling it from arc. I just have the abbreviation as the full one here, but Dwayne's awesome rent a rent to own company. So it's pulling the branding from this over here and popping it into the page here. So if we paste in their account number and their email address, but we will make an error on the email address, so it says register, says account not found. We'll fix it. So now we're at the verification page. Let me just go to modification history to grab which grab the thing, because I don't want to actually be sending emails to people just yet. Paste this in again. We'll do the wrong code. Complain,

Speaker 5  1:30:09
I've got Terms and Conditions. I'll make this a bit wider and scroll, but gonna have to do some special formatting for that. Except Terms and Conditions. We're gonna we're gonna set a wonderful password. And then we're in. And right now, I don't have any of the meat of this thing filled out. I did the nav bar according to what Justin wanted. But you know, these are fairly basic pages at this point with each you know, the white window here being the new stuff. So if we log out, go back to log in, we've got our email address here trying to make a incorrect password. So you can see what that looks like. Found. I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:03
we can log in one remaining thing if we putting in something that should not be valid, and now we go to reset our password.

Speaker 5  1:31:25
Now we've got a new code here. Here's where we set our password, set the password hash, and with this one, Dwayne The salt is right inside the thing. I know you love hearing about salt, so there's no pepper with this one, and that is a legitimate thing, adding pepper in as well. So so we go back, put in our verification code, and then we can set a new password, and then once that's set, and we can continue to the site. And you can see back here, we changed the password that saved on their contact record. So yeah, got the full authentication flow working. There are a few things such as, now that we figured out that each each whiskey instance is specific to each rental company that massively simplifies a lot of things, because it's really difficult to always know which rental company they're talking about. For example, if you do something and you log out, we've cleared your cookie, we have no idea who you are anymore. And so there's no good way to show you a specific rental company's login page. So, so we cleared all that out of the way, and that's massively quite a lot of things. I have some cleanup left to do, but I'm pretty close to I think next thing I'm going to work on is getting the auto pay running. What I've heard that's the next bigger, next biggest priority. And then as far as all the content on these pages, I would, you know, Justin has completed all this mock ups, and I would love it if you Matthias And Dwayne would go through them. I mean, if you, if you are signing off on them right away, that's great, but I assume that you would maybe want to go through them and see if it's all ready to code, or if there are still some changes that you want to see. Just let me know

Speaker 1  1:33:31
at what point, at what point, Jonathan, is any of this accessible from an actual URL so that I so that I can start showing it to people

Speaker 5  1:33:43
I am, I mean, I just finished this morning, got all the last things connected, and so today, potentially, I could make sure that the test whiskey is updated and is running correctly, and then at that

Speaker 1  1:33:58
point, it's Not a huge rush. I just know that. Well, I will say, as soon as you can tie it actually into an actual rent to own company record for the for the branding, so we can fiddle around with the branding as well. That would be, that'd be super fun. But yeah, this is, oh man, I cannot wait. Cannot wait. It is so vastly, so vastly better looking than

Speaker 6  1:34:23
than what people are used to. It's just like, oh yes please.

Speaker 5  1:34:27
And something I should mention. I mean, you could probably see from how the form was formatted, but it's this is very, very mobile friendly when you zoom in, once it gets to full width, it stays at like, about 90% width to keep this little bit margin on the side, but it stays very useful all the way down. Nice big buttons for people to click on.

Speaker 1  1:34:47
That is key. It has to be. I mean, judging by the amount from the like, from our from the marketing side of of true point, judging by the amount. People that actually use mobile devices versus computers. It's so vastly far and above that, yes, mobile is has got to be next, next to, like the top, you know, the most priority when it comes to how we view things, because who who goes and uses a computer anymore, except for people who actually use

Speaker 5  1:35:21
it for work? So on that note, the way that I have the nav bar working is, once you get in small enough, such as mobile, mobile, probably more like this or something, then we have where the full menu pops out for navigation. When you close it, it collapses up to the top bar, which would always be visible. Yep, makes sense.

Speaker 5  1:35:47
Lovely. I have only been back in the office three days after a 10 day break for Christmas, so most of my zrt work has been knocking out a bunch of reviews and then also doing some more work with handling NSF means on payments.

Speaker 4  1:36:08
Yes, my work has consisted of standardizing a couple dashboards the company, overview one and the past due one, as well as all reports that were linked to it as well. And also, another big one was renaming products to assets in the system. So that's I finished a dev input for that today, so I think that that's all done and renamed over. And yeah, as Seth was saying, for the biggest thing that I've been working on recently has been standardizing the check system to use in CRT. And, yeah, I finished up some dev inputs on that today. There'll probably be a little bit more work, but yeah, that's very, very close to done. And as far as going forward, I got a job from Seth today to link history records to contracts. So that's going to be my highest priority, to get that done. And then after that, probably the checks jobs we've gone to, those for zrt that's and then Jasper's been dipping his toes in a few zrt jobs. So hopefully in the coming months, he'll, coming weeks, he'll start picking up more of a load and help us push through this big pile of things.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:31
Good. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:37:35
once again, welcome Jasper. You just kind of trial by fire. Go meet everybody, find out what's going on. Not understand anything. I mean, whatever, like, it's all kinds of stuff floating around in the project. But good to glad you could join us. I'm excited to have you part of the project. And, yeah, welcome

Speaker 3  1:37:54
anything else? Good, awesome. Well, thank you guys, thanks guys, see you. Next week, see ya, see ya.

Matthias Miller  1:38:07
Dwayne. Do you have to drop immediately, or do I spend a little bit more

Speaker 1  1:38:12
time on the I do need to drop. I have I got to talk to Jimmy in about five minutes. So yeah, let's, let's drop.

Matthias Miller  1:38:21
What's your next availability?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:30
I have availability tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:36
I have availability Tuesday, Wednesday,

Matthias Miller  1:38:43
tomorrow, I'm open anytime after I do 930 to one, anytime.

Speaker 1  1:38:58
930 to one, how about this? Let's do a presume you're talking Eastern. Yeah, Eastern. We can stick one in 930 to 11, all

Matthias Miller  1:39:14
right. And then you mentioned Tuesday. My Tuesday is going to be really super wonky.

Speaker 1  1:39:21
I could do Monday. I could do Monday anywhere

Unknown Speaker  1:39:30
from 1130 to 211.

Speaker 1  1:39:34
30 I'm also fine if you just want to go into Wednesday and book two of them.

Matthias Miller  1:39:44
Two I could do. Okay, here's the thing I'm going to be working, probably working from home with our youngest. She's likely going to play by herself a lot, but I don't know how conducive it is the whatever I'm going to have to drop off here and there, but I could you. Potentially do a Tuesday. I could probably do a three to 430 if you wanted to, if we could work on a small screen, and if not, let's on Monday, on Tuesday, I could do, I could do one to two and one to two on Monday. I could do three to 430 on Tuesday, or we do two time slots on Wednesday again.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:29
Let's do two. Let's do Monday and Wednesday.

Matthias Miller  1:40:32
Okay, I'll send those out as well often.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:36
That way I got some time in there to get some other things done. Okay, and you said one on one tomorrow, right? Tomorrow, that's what I meant. One spot

Matthias Miller  1:40:50
tomorrow, correct, 930 day. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:53
awesome, good. Thank you, sir. Yep.
