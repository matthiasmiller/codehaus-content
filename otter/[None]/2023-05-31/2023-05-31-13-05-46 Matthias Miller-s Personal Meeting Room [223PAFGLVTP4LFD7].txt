Unknown Speaker  01:32
Howdy howdy, howdy howdy Why is my closet door hanging

Unknown Speaker  01:39
up in that it's hilarious

Unknown Speaker  01:52
were you working from today

Matthias Miller  01:54
co working space downstairs in my office okay, my wife volunteered to bring me lunch on the local Mexican joint so I wanted to be close to the door so you can run out and grab it

Unknown Speaker  02:16
ah

Matthias Miller  02:17
well which do you want? Which do you want the rant session or the let's go right through this session

Speaker 1  02:24
we're gonna read you can't record it so well we should probably just do work otherwise we will burn up a whole entire who knows how much time with

Unknown Speaker  02:41
with

Speaker 1  02:43
some very angsty feelings that I have right now and it probably wouldn't be valuable much of much

Unknown Speaker  02:48
value but in times

Unknown Speaker  02:59
so you're gonna get me started aren't you

Matthias Miller  03:02
know I'm getting rid and closing them but Windows to get started

Speaker 1  03:08
I'm just I'm hacked off at Gabe right now if you had some burning on your mind that you wanted to get done then you should have put it into the the dev priorities call you can't just go Sideswipe something and decide to hijack or expand

Matthias Miller  03:30
fun times well you know, no business gets away from clients and customers. Well actually some do. Here's what here's the

Speaker 1  03:42
deal is whatever they want to do is going to impact things that Josh is gonna have to do anyway. And so I have a feeling Josh is gonna be like, Oh, well, do you want to do this or do you want to do that and so maybe it'll solve itself.

Unknown Speaker  03:56
So itself okay, well, payroll numbers a side note on payroll numbers.

Unknown Speaker  04:10
And Mark as Mark talked to you about deleting our old data

Matthias Miller  04:15
Yeah, that was on the agenda. No, he has not talked about that. Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1  04:20
Well, pretty much pretty much any timecard stuff that we've done in the past we just need to

Speaker 2  04:26
delete I have no idea. Okay, I have a very good idea. New incident

Matthias Miller  04:40
type change request, assignee Seth, hi code CFP, billing type, time and materials, solution provider USA. Clear out old payroll data in live system all this It's your screen. I mean, this is just this includes time cards and the information tied to buildings, etc. This does not include configuration

Speaker 1  05:23
there was, I don't think there was anything tied to buildings, it was predominantly timecards.

Unknown Speaker  05:29
Was it actually this simple?

Matthias Miller  05:32
It's really that simple.

Unknown Speaker  05:42
Is it really that simple? I'm suspicious that is the, you know,

Speaker 1  05:50
what do you know what really scares me about this whole payroll thing? What

Unknown Speaker  05:58
else had a word for this? Was it? Something is

Speaker 1  06:04
project rot, or what's the word for this?

Speaker 2  06:09
Project? Right? Yeah. I'm really scared of project rot on this. But mostly,

Speaker 1  06:18
mostly because I haven't I have not given payroll much thought, in what, year and a half, two years. And it's like, oh, yeah, I'm supposed to go back there and the cobwebs and remember how to do some of this stuff and what it's supposed to do and how it's supposed to do it. And Seth would just set with just grin because he's like, My code is so good that you just don't have to remember he just input the information.

Unknown Speaker  06:44
He didn't quite say that at one point, but it was close.

Matthias Miller  06:50
Well, it's fine, except we have a moving target called business processes of change. And nothing to enforce that they stay on track.

Speaker 1  07:00
Yeah, and that, and that's the scary part. It's like, okay, so the reason we went and did that we went back to alter nonproduction. Time was for build on sites. Well, since since build on sites have happened. Well, now we've got things like, you know, a bunch of other non production stuff, and hopefully, it'll encapsulate for that just fine. And maybe it won't, and I don't know, and what about when we go out and build, you know, are we going to want to do something separate for two stories versus, you know, regular build on sites? I don't like there. There is so many things that have happened since that point in time. That project Rob is is really scary.

Unknown Speaker  07:37
Yeah.

Speaker 1  07:42
But I guess the only way we're going to know is if we get into it.

Unknown Speaker  07:45
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  07:57
So

Speaker 1  07:58
I guess there really isn't such a thing as just shoving a

Unknown Speaker  08:01
project.

Matthias Miller  08:04
Well, I mean, in what universe? Is there actually something that should be a project you you're

Unknown Speaker  08:09
you're right, you're right. When's when's one setback on boards?

Matthias Miller  08:20
first week of June, I think it might be next week. Okay, that's my preferred way of dealing with that.

Speaker 1  08:32
Yeah, and maybe it's that if we start afresh and we start punching in stuff, that's, you know, that's fresh and don't worry about old stuff. And but like, there is, there are there are verification reports that I don't think we ever quite got built out.

Matthias Miller  08:49
Oh, yeah, they said that just design something and we'll tell you if we like it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  08:59
I'm really, really scared. Like, we're opening up a can that's gonna go like this. Oh, we got to do that. And that and that. And so the next thing you know, sets back to college and we're still not done.

Matthias Miller  09:12
Well, but I think some of this comes down to probably a tight fisted maniac to stay on track maybe. Like let's prioritize.

Speaker 1  09:24
Well, okay, So rule number one on this project, if it if it revolves around code, if it revolves around anything to do with reports or verification reports, etc, etc. That's Nick work that like we need Seth for the inner workings of it like it's the wiring, it is not going to be the dressing.

Matthias Miller  09:44
Yeah, it's the calculations that hey, we should be

Unknown Speaker  09:50
paying this guy about

Matthias Miller  09:52
10 times what you're getting paid and this other guy's getting too much money, what's going on? Kind of thing.

Speaker 1  10:00
And then maybe it's that we should just have a call with Mark about that and just say the three of us the four the three of us need to agree right here right now that we're going to have to be religious about

Unknown Speaker  10:15
staying on track because

Speaker 1  10:18
we've got we don't we don't want to go well, we'll just take it around again to

Unknown Speaker  10:21
set comes back from college. Again. Agreed.

Matthias Miller  10:30
Well, that would be as simple as a quick email mark. And I think he's going to be very, very bought into that.

Unknown Speaker  10:42
He's liable to be the one that derails it so yeah,

Matthias Miller  10:50
I do think he's, I think so. I think I've maybe increased a few small tweaks and pushing back on things. And I think he's, you've worked

Speaker 1  11:00
with enough now that you know, when when you're about to go off the rails, so

Matthias Miller  11:04
and he does, he does even if even if he has a proclivity to go off the rails, he still values not going off the rails. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  11:13
Great. Great. So

Matthias Miller  11:16
we got that in our favor. RTO calculator to work as part of the dealer portal.

Unknown Speaker  11:25
What's that? So

Speaker 1  11:28
right now we have an RTO calculator is a standard something or other? That's very manual input. And I really want to turn it into something automatic that we can have up there that you could I get Okay, here's here's the here's the short story I had a spreadsheet RTO calculator that got us sued. And it was documented it was documentation that a dealer misused All be it you know, there's really not really any way around. But what what I want to do is I want to give dealers a way that they can have a customer walk into their office, the customer says that building on a lot, you know $3,100 What would be RTO costs you know per month on that and they could quickly run those numbers without having to do a full on quote, I get asked for this all the stinking time and you know for right now for the last little while I just have said no I'm not giving you anything cost me too much

Unknown Speaker  12:25
money the last time around. So but

Speaker 1  12:30
if we have it as part of the software where they can punch in $1 value in based on who they are and what district they're in and what they would normally get for RTO options based on who they are. They could calculate 2436 4860 month contract

Unknown Speaker  12:45
dollar value. Does that make sense? Yeah, but I'm wondering

Matthias Miller  12:56
okay, good. So we're still gonna have I mean, yeah, we're gonna have shared logic we're gonna have two ways to do this one is through the configurator and one is through

Matthias Miller  13:09
this thing whatever this thing is let's give it a shot

Unknown Speaker  13:13
guess share your share your your screen

Unknown Speaker  13:27
where am I? And you know what, you know what recording Yeah, do this guy. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:40
Okay, but what we need to know is

Unknown Speaker  13:47
dealer or sales rep.

Speaker 1  13:51
It would be sales rep because that's, it's we're going to we're going to quantify who they are in the same way we do everything in the CRM cockpit stuff Yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:19
This doesn't include tax.

Unknown Speaker  14:23
Yeah. So

Speaker 1  14:27
what what I'm probably going to say is when that,

Unknown Speaker  14:34
okay,

Speaker 1  14:35
when you run a report, we can put a preface on their other report that's whenever they run it. It says you know, we just put a bunch of disclaimers on so you can't really, you know, if you print it out, or you know, something it's going to have we're going to put some disclaimers, like in the preface or the probably in the preface in in the footer. But once once we get this thing working, I'll handle it. Some of those.

Unknown Speaker  15:02
Alright, so is the ship to zip code?

Matthias Miller  15:12
Is that how you want to handle it? Are you going to calculate shipping?

Unknown Speaker  15:17
You're gonna exclude shipping? I think.

Speaker 1  15:22
I think at this point, we're just going to say, What in the disclosure, I think what we I don't think the zip code is relevant, I think we just want to know, we want to know approximate RTO numbers, and we'll say, in the disclosures, this does not include shipping this does not include sales taxes, you know, we're just gonna say a bunch of things it does not include

Unknown Speaker  15:44
we just do like this

Unknown Speaker  15:52
ship to state.

Speaker 1  16:04
Now, what we could say is we could auto us, and more, I'd be more interested in saying we auto assign the state based on the dealership. So basically, whatever state the dealership is in base, okay, whatever, whatever, dealership, the sales rep is assigned to that address becomes the address that we would theoretically use for calculating, like the state and so forth. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  16:35
I'm like that.

Unknown Speaker  16:45
Which I'm not that user. But

Unknown Speaker  16:50
you got the picture.

Speaker 1  16:51
Yeah. So CRM cockpit currents. And I got back, let me see that. Oh, you're just gonna pop in there district as the state as the state to us.

Unknown Speaker  17:01
Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  17:05
No, no, it wouldn't be that it wouldn't be the district it would be. I would say the dealer fields,

Unknown Speaker  17:13
the

Speaker 1  17:16
what is it contact state or whatever, whatever, whatever. The dealer record comes at a dealer contact. Oh, shoot, I'm drawing a blank here. What whatever the address, whatever the state of the address of the dealer that this the sales rep is assigned to their

Speaker 2  17:32
dealer state. I'll get there sooner or later.

Unknown Speaker  17:41
Hey.

Speaker 1  17:55
So if Tibbett auto assigns that, are we going to allow them we wish they would still be able to hit the drop down and then change to a different state contract?

Unknown Speaker  18:02
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  18:07
So they change their state, it would automatically design Yeah, that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  18:12
Okay, so then,

Matthias Miller  18:14
are we doing anything like this, then you need the RTO type in the terms? Right. Yeah, the terms

Speaker 1  18:21
would be, well, no the terms. Okay. The terms you're going to use this as just columns of calculation. We're just going to basically, I'd say we just like you, we do a printout of say, here's the $24.24 month dollar value, the 36 month or the 48 month dollar amount and the 16 month already so based on whatever terms are allowed for the contract of the state that's being called then that becomes a column

Unknown Speaker  18:45
of calculation.

Unknown Speaker  19:07
reckon

Matthias Miller  19:09
we'll probably have to validate the terms after they select it. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  19:12
that we can. I guess we could limit it to

Unknown Speaker  20:05
We can't do that

Unknown Speaker  20:24
we can't do both

Speaker 3  20:38
so sorry it wasn't surance I said even when I'm winning What am I doing

Unknown Speaker  20:42
support I went

Unknown Speaker  21:18
well looks like we do the hard way

Unknown Speaker  21:57
anything else gonna go on here

Speaker 1  22:07
no because we're going to do that yet no I don't think so. So just yeah that

Unknown Speaker  22:11
okay

Matthias Miller  22:17
like there's all these other things like

Unknown Speaker  22:25
this disallowed terms and disallowed types

Matthias Miller  22:31
well just all types of things were handling like Max price errors

Unknown Speaker  22:39
hmm ignore those for now

Unknown Speaker  23:03
we have the input

Unknown Speaker  23:11
this isn't actually total it's more like

Unknown Speaker  24:29
well this is way deeper than I thought we were gonna have to go

Unknown Speaker  24:46
What's the term

Unknown Speaker  24:59
you We'll do this

Speaker 1  25:46
you know what, why don't we go about the action let's let's go back this way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way

Unknown Speaker  25:50
simpler. Okay,

Speaker 1  25:53
let's do this really actually really simple this is way deeper than I thought we're gonna have to go. Let's just Let's just hard code the divisors so you can put in your amount you can and if you put in your amount and and what else we want to put in basically then we can spit out columns that says divided by this, this

Speaker 2  26:11
this and this and this what your monthly payments will be I think we're, we're working way too hard for this.

Unknown Speaker  26:22
Okay, so go back to the original calculator

Unknown Speaker  26:30
so rather

Unknown Speaker  26:31
than than punching it, okay, so

Matthias Miller  26:33
we can still grab those it's not a problem to grab those they're currently the

Speaker 1  26:41
divisors are the same for everything so why don't we rather than rather than asking for the divisor let's just punch it in like hit us the Can we can we the terms I guess it would be our to terms is that what the field

Unknown Speaker  26:55
is? Yeah, there you go.

Matthias Miller  26:59
Would you still want to know which ones are available and which ones to show?

Speaker 2  27:03
Yeah, I guess Yeah, exactly. I thought so.

Unknown Speaker  27:25
And when

Speaker 1  27:26
they have the ability to put CRM Yeah, it's probably you're probably

Unknown Speaker  27:31
if it's worth doing it's worth

Unknown Speaker  27:32
doing right I was just gonna chase a really simplistic method

Matthias Miller  27:38
whether we should push this into standard components then sooner rather than later

Unknown Speaker  27:43
Yeah, cuz this thing's gonna get used

Unknown Speaker  27:54
I'm gonna grab some water here a bit

Unknown Speaker  28:08
usual

Speaker 2  28:32
I don't know if I can make it or not the one the one that would or JPEG one I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  28:57
it's fun being triple booked.

Unknown Speaker  28:59
You get a lot of things done.

Matthias Miller  29:03
No DW F support

Unknown Speaker  29:13
we can

Speaker 1  29:14
actually do it. Do we want to support it or notch? How hard is it supported?

Unknown Speaker  29:21
For going to do this let's do it

Speaker 1  29:26
right I guess. You already got your teeth sunk into this thing.

Unknown Speaker  30:14
Do we use?

Unknown Speaker  32:51
That's how you do that I've wondered that already.

Unknown Speaker  33:57
Morning

Speaker 1  36:00
I just I just hit the mute no use there you go there you go I just I was like keep hitting South Carolina's like why are all those cops no that's right you don't have stuff going on contract

Unknown Speaker  36:14
Wait What's the what's the secondary amount? Monthly Payment

Unknown Speaker  36:37
Missing

Matthias Miller  37:49
You know not sure I want to say this is lawsuit proof but

Unknown Speaker  38:00
why why is there

Unknown Speaker  38:01
why is the financing base changing

Unknown Speaker  38:12
I'm confused

Matthias Miller  38:16
because we're doing contract by monthly payment

Speaker 1  38:18
okay just go go back go back to standard just go to the standard contract

Speaker 2  38:25
okay 5001 thing

Unknown Speaker  38:49
didn't want to do that last year

Unknown Speaker  39:29
you know

Speaker 1  39:31
this is maybe this is just dangerous. We built this thing we can mess around with it doesn't necessarily say we put it on the I got to think this one through. Here's here's the problem. This is this is where this is how we got screwed on the lawsuit. Well, okay, if I would, if I would have been allowed to go to court if I wasn't for working for Amish people if I've been allowed to go to court either one. But where they did a calculator thing like this had the customer sign in and then did an arch Do a contract completely different. And then when the customer got the RTO contract is like, this is not what I wanted, but that's what you signed in. So we tried to enforce the contract, but they then they held up this other piece of paper is like, well, this is what I also signed. And so I wanted this over here. I guess we still run that risk.

Matthias Miller  40:20
Well, this is not I mean, you can have you can have a footnote on this. I mean, this is not a don't get me started on legal contracts. But anyway, but this is not a this is an estimation in your final this is only an estimation This is not a commitment. You know, this is whatever blah blah blah

Unknown Speaker  40:50
I guess we could you could go through

Speaker 1  40:51
and add estimate in front of that estimate dash in front of every single number no matter how you printed or copied or whatever you always have estimate in front of it

Unknown Speaker  41:10
you could

Unknown Speaker  41:21
all right. Well

Matthias Miller  41:24
this takes us at the end of our time, I'll let you decide what you want to do with it. I do think it should be do think I do think it should be maintained within standard

Unknown Speaker  41:35
components.

Matthias Miller  41:40
I do think we need to consider edge cases where yes, this you know, edge cases and or disclaimers.

Unknown Speaker  41:48
Well put it

Speaker 1  41:50
tell them where you're going to put it. I want to think about it before before we make this thing standard and before we go and put it anywhere where anybody can ever use it

Speaker 2  42:01
I mean it's it's really twice there you go is it in your folder and put it in the ports user share sales profile, you put it in Salesforce, okay. All right. Good enough for now.

Speaker 1  42:24
What else did you have on your list? What? How much? How much? How many minutes do I have left?

Matthias Miller  42:30
Oh, you gotta dry I should drop I've got other stuff on my list but we can talk biggest thing is switching folks over to the switching North Carolina over to the new portal um

Speaker 1  42:51
had been so hit down with so many other things and I completely forgot about it

Unknown Speaker  43:00
Well, you know what, I'm

Unknown Speaker  43:01
very tempted to Everybody wake up tomorrow, and that's where they are.

Matthias Miller  43:05
I mean, I don't have a problem with that as long as I mean. Well, I kind of have a problem with that because I have a call agenda a specific agenda for the call tomorrow and I really don't want it disrupted.

Unknown Speaker  43:16
Okay, with what went sideways, but

Speaker 1  43:21
yeah, but nobody, everybody like the numbers of people that are currently using it. Nobody's gone sideways. So I mean, aside from aside from the people who are gonna be like, I don't know how to find things now though. It's okay. All right. I'm gonna make a note. When do you want it done Friday night? They'd wake up Monday morning to probably

Unknown Speaker  43:45
okay

Unknown Speaker  43:53
I'll get it done.

Matthias Miller  43:54
Okay. Sounds good. stuff. We can hit later,

Speaker 2  43:59
I guess. Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you, sir.
