Matthias Miller  02:02
There you go. SBC, dot. Here we go, Matt. Hi, good morning. Hey. good morning. Got George is right here? Should, should I go straight to the Yeah, straight to silver. Lim eight. Yes. Question for George, what's the date? What date are you of orders? Are you working on right now? We're getting ready to that be the 19th calendar. Hey buddy, right now I'm working on five, five through 516, okay, and I've still got a group there that I'm not not complete yet, in the 12th and the 16th. 12 to here. I mean, I'm gonna bump it out to the 12th. That's alright, let me know when you're ready to well, how do I get on a silver loom? SPC, dot. Silver loom.io, OH. I Oh, I lost, you going on there. Never mind. SPC, dot.io, yeah, yeah.io, yep, it's right there. All right, here we go. Lynn, when you got it, hit Share, minimize it. Oh, we got here. Select, share, good All right, so everything got cleared out of the cut list of the print schedule. So if you, if you just want to go back to the home home screen, and we could send some orders over and, uh, uh, yeah. Back to the home screen. Uh, yeah. Like, there's, there's a tab open just to the right here. Home, silver limb, business, like you can just close this, close this tab out this one. Yeah, okay, got it this one? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, okay. Well, just type it in again. Put an spc.at the beginning. I missing a period.

Speaker 1  05:01
I was I was I was take, I took a shortcut. I mean, I,

Matthias Miller  05:09
there you go. I

Unknown Speaker  05:12
don't see you anymore.

Matthias Miller  05:15
I don't know where I'm at here. There you go. Found me, not all who wonder or lost jump over to the home screen or the Home tab

Matthias Miller  05:41
and hit the orders.

Unknown Speaker  05:47
Well, every time I do that, it goes your the visual goes away. I'm not sure what I have wrong here.

Matthias Miller  05:59
I don't know

Matthias Miller  06:07
it's

Unknown Speaker  06:13
sorry, would you say new orders? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:15
go to new orders. I

Matthias Miller  06:27
All right, so let's find, let's find a few of these to push across, or whichever ones you want, unless you want to go back and pass and look at the MX 10, or one of those that had a little funky or there's, there is actually an MX 10 down, down On the 20th,

Matthias Miller  07:00
right there, that it's at the top now.

Speaker 1  07:05
Or my next one right here, Meridian. Okay, so I'm meridian. Or what are we doing? This one hit

Matthias Miller  07:15
Generate materials list. Or if you want to throw a few more over, you can

Unknown Speaker  07:23
just ready to go over right now.

Matthias Miller  07:27
Well, if you want to play around with Okay, so let's take a step back. MX 10 has MX 10 has some unique stuff. So if you want to play around with that one, we could send it across. If there's something else you want to send over, we

Speaker 2  07:49
can what was the other one we were working on? It was and there was a one other one, uh,

Matthias Miller  07:54
let me see if I can find it. Um,

Speaker 1  07:58
48 that's a 60, but it was the it

Unknown Speaker  08:05
was

Speaker 1  08:07
man should easy remember that I

Matthias Miller  08:26
give me well, I'm almost got To hear, wait

Unknown Speaker  08:34
a minute. No,

Matthias Miller  08:39
the rzc one,

Unknown Speaker  08:43
wedges. Yeah, that was wedges.

Unknown Speaker  08:49
I don't think there's any upcoming right now,

Matthias Miller  08:53
I'll be back. No, there's, there's not how uh here, let me, let me, let me, let me go. Let me go back, date, back to where we were, minimum, sage, day 414 we had been on 414 Well, if you want to not lose it, let's send this one over. Since we're here, how am I sending this from? From this right now, hit Generate materials list to the top right? You

Speaker 1  09:18
saying, if I click the item, then generate materials this, or what? Yeah, yep, like the item. Do you see where I'm at? Okay, so this, then this, yep, okay,

Matthias Miller  09:33
all right. And then the, I pulled in a bunch of old orders. So the r, z, C, where is this one? There's one on the 17th, 417, up, up. Yep, some more. In order, right? There one that the one? In Yep, RCC, 112

Unknown Speaker  10:03
so just do that and then generate materials list,

Unknown Speaker  10:06
yep, containing,

Matthias Miller  10:11
all right, then let's go over into the start with the sizer cut list. Take a look.

Matthias Miller  10:22
Okay, drag the drag that bottom divider right under the scroll bar. Just drag it down. Just a little bit more. Sorry, down. If you go, if you move your mouse right underneath the scroll bar, you can, you can size, size the bottom part. Down. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  10:40
up a little bit. Oh, okay, right there,

Matthias Miller  10:42
right there. There you go. And just, and just pull that all the way down. Okay, yeah, all right. So I guess you can't really see it here, but I did make these were changes, mostly under the hood, to be able to manage, manage stuff better, and so it's frustratingly little visible changes, but it's it is going to be more maintainable long term. When you send things over to the cut list, it groups them into into chunks like they are going to show up on the printout. So if you on the sizers, it groups them by this the size or size, or the can't size, can't length and can't notes, and they automatically get grouped together. And those, I guess we should probably, we should probably actually go back and grab some more orders where we've got, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  11:52
go ahead, sorry, yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:55
grab, grab some more orders where we could maybe take a look at, look. Let's just go back to New orders and grab a bunch, a bunch off the top or something. Well,

Speaker 1  12:08
shouldn't those be in here? The ones we send over or done, they're not in here. Hang on. Let me take a look. Probably because, I mean, I don't know

Speaker 1  12:26
less, Brewer on schedule for Danny. You got Brewer schedule? Well,

Matthias Miller  12:30
the RCC one doesn't have, doesn't use a sizer, true, right? So it's not so if you go over to the selling list, you should, you should see him,

Speaker 1  12:46
which is not here, okay, right.

Matthias Miller  12:49
So be on the menu, yep, okay. So here you Yeah. So here you see the the that actually needs to be changed.

Matthias Miller  13:11
So here there's, there's alternating row colors on the in the sales order number and so, if you so under L and M, those two, by default, get scheduled together because it's the same same raw material

Unknown Speaker  13:37
And it's the same dimension

Matthias Miller  13:39
in the same the,

Speaker 1  13:45
well, I mean, okay, sure, in the sign that makes sense, in the sawing cut list, I guess support in the in the sizers cut list,

Matthias Miller  14:00
then it's based on, on the can't,

Unknown Speaker  14:03
well, it should be based on dimensions first,

Speaker 1  14:12
because we don't want to change over the gangs. The gang saw

Matthias Miller  14:17
right by thickness, by the by the yield,

Unknown Speaker  14:23
first by thickness, then by width, then by length.

Matthias Miller  14:36
I mean, but you you combine varying lengths, so it's not length,

Speaker 1  14:41
right? Well, um says, well as a Yeah, but for thickness, first, when we, when we organize the gang souls, or the size or cut lists, we want the same thicknesses to be back to back.

Matthias Miller  14:59
Okay? Do you. Want that's fair, and then, and then, do you want the same? Will you put the same width in the same job? Or those will be broken out into separate jobs?

Speaker 1  15:13
Same, sorry, the same width and the same, it'd be still be separate job if it's, if the width change, like, if it changes from so, like, if we have half but three and a half, we're going to run a bunch of half by three and a half jobs, back to back to back. And if there's half by five and a half, we'll move the head up to five and a half. Then we'll run half by five and a half. And then, then, if it's then we'll go to, like, another thickness after that. Yep,

Speaker 1  15:54
that's the sizers, because of the setup it takes. Yeah, a lot of set up those the blades for the thickness.

Unknown Speaker  16:08
Now, sorry, sorry, Matt, go ahead, you're saying so something

Unknown Speaker  16:17
must be

Matthias Miller  16:20
and do you will you reuse the same? When you cut a can, you always cut it the same thickness and width. You never cut cans to different. I mean, I'm assuming the answer,

Speaker 1  16:35
no, we do. We you. I mean, we use, yeah, like a three and a half by six. We can cut that into 716, by three and a half, half by three and a half, 916 you know, all the sizes that are by three and a half by three and a half.

Matthias Miller  16:58
So in this particular case, so these are ordered by,

Matthias Miller  17:10
I don't know, I feel like there's a little bit of a communication gap. I don't know how to how to bridge it.

Matthias Miller  17:22
On the sizer side, we're grouping it based on the CANS that you're using. And so if you have a set of cans that you're using, that's where everything, everything gets grouped under those cans that you're that you're sizing

Speaker 1  17:37
um, yeah, but that's not what we wanted to do, okay, we've all, I've always wanted to group it by thickness, and then this the cans that are used, the thickness dictates, or what. You know, the guys in New York, they just have to bring in whatever cans are needed.

Unknown Speaker  17:59
Um, all right?

Speaker 1  18:03
Because that's not a setup thing. They just, they just grab the cans and bring them in so like they don't have to, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:16
does that make sense, man? I mean, I know we Yeah. More,

Matthias Miller  18:21
that's, fine. Yep, it does.

Matthias Miller  18:30
So these would need to be okay. So this will happen. I'll change it to happen automatically, but if you click the second, like the second row, or one, either one of those, sorry, the under Ellen L and M, yeah, click that. Okay, hit move items. Top right, top

Unknown Speaker  18:58
right. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:02
And hit leave it blank to move it into separate work order, which split, which is going to split it apart. So continue.

Speaker 1  19:12
Oh, well. I mean, okay, let me, let me just like, what are, what are we trying to do

Matthias Miller  19:17
here? Okay, go to bullet first. First First of all, sorry, let's, let's go to the, let's go to this. We gotta go to the sizer. Let's go to the sizer and pull it. Let's start. Let's start there. Otherwise it's just, well, no, the sizer only has a single item, so it's not relevant there, right?

Speaker 1  19:40
You want to move some stuff over there. Should move some more stuff over Yeah,

Matthias Miller  19:44
let's move some more stuff over to this to the sizer.

Unknown Speaker  19:51
All right, we could do

Unknown Speaker  19:54
stuff here. I.

Speaker 1  20:02
Can I do multiple Can I send multiple items? Yep, buy it, hold it and scroll down. Hold it, yep, hold

Matthias Miller  20:11
and scroll control, click any of those

Speaker 3  20:17
and then generate materials list. Yep,

Speaker 1  20:41
we're getting a bigger screen for George. I don't don't have it yet, but anyway, gonna happen that. So this is organized by, yeah, see that

Matthias Miller  20:59
that's but that's not grouping those. This is, I'm,

Unknown Speaker  21:06
well, here the three and a half bites are together.

Matthias Miller  21:08
Well, technically not. For some reason it I mean, they're going to

Speaker 1  21:17
be we have to have the solace. Have to be grouped by dimension, thickness, first, width, second, and if thickness and width align, then

Speaker 3  21:35
mean dimension. Well, sorry, yeah, go ahead. Hope she can do that in sort over, though, can't you, yeah,

Speaker 1  21:42
or exactly sad, you can do it in sort order. But you were making an automatic you were going by, can size Matt, like auto.

Matthias Miller  21:51
That was, that was the that was the that was the intent. And something's obviously

Speaker 1  21:56
vocal about that, because I heard you say that before then I did say that it needs to be ordered by thickness and by dimension. But sorry, I don't. I didn't. I should. I mean, I wasn't. That's fine, um,

Speaker 1  22:18
I mean it's yeah for for our I mean, it doesn't make it's too choppy. Yeah, we're going to lose time if we do. But, yeah, we can't. We have to keep set up the gang saw for half inch, then we run all half inch, then we set it up for inch and 516 then we run all the inch and five six. That's the way we've Yep, and, I mean, we do change over. Sometimes we'll run one job and then change over, and that does happen. And we'll run half inch, and then three hours later we're back one half inch, and that's just because of the schedule and or something came up. Yeah, it does vary. But to group it by thickness, as many as we can of the same thickness back to back is the fastest, most efficient way for absolutely yeah on the sizes, on the would you say the same thing applies in the sawing area? George like

Speaker 2  23:15
no, it's going to be more date than Yeah. It's going to be date more in that cut like this, all cutting area and all that, do you

Speaker 1  23:25
need to group like the items in the sawing list? Matt does that like, sort of needing, at least in a generic way, to group?

Matthias Miller  23:36
Yes. So would you want those broken apart by date

Speaker 2  23:42
on the sawing, I think so, yep. We're always working from the early state to the latest data and sewing

Matthias Miller  23:54
right now, and that's typically a date of time, yep, yep.

Speaker 2  24:02
Now when you say a day at a time, Matt, what do you not, well, you

Matthias Miller  24:06
would, you would like, if you push, if you push a bunch of orders together, alright, or push a bunch of orders across, and let's say you had had two orders that you use one by six by hardwood like and and their due dates are three days apart. Do you want them to automatically group or because they're three days apart? Do you want them the the ones for the 17th group together, the ones for the 20th group together, probably

Speaker 2  24:40
going to group because, like, if I do a bunch of instant seven sixteenths, they're from earliest to latest date, but they're still grouped together. But it's going to be like the 12th of May, 13. Say, you got an inch and seven for the 12th of May, you got one for the 13th of May. They're all grouped, but they start from. The youngest date to the oldest, right? Because the way I'm doing it now,

Matthias Miller  25:09
and I, and I think, I think this got, got lost in the rework as well, but the on the on this, but on the sawing, we're only the the primary grouping is by raw material, right? Or, or are you also wanting to batch together by thickness and width? Raw material plus thickness and width?

Speaker 2  25:40
Well, the way I have it now, like I'll do inch and 716, but three and a half cutbacks. And then it'll be like 30 inch and seven, three and a half, 20 for 515, 20 piece inch and 716, but three and a half, 20 for 516, I'm just giving you some runs. And then after that, then I'll go to the next, I mean next thing as far as what dates coming up or

Speaker 1  26:06
but does that answer your question? Matt, what was your question? Can

Matthias Miller  26:10
you? Can you explain that again,

Speaker 2  26:14
like right now? I give it a heading of inch and 716, by three and a half cutbacks, so that would be in the raw material, info, sewing. And then after that, then I do the like, give it everything. Like the youngest there always states the latest date. Say there's a half dozen inch and 716 but three and a half pieces of lumber or sizes, but you have say dates from the eighth to the 12th. It'll start from the eighth. And I just, I just group all of them together, because

Speaker 1  26:49
it's engine seven a year and a half and it's coming out of those cutbacks.

Matthias Miller  26:55
Yep. And that's all that's all spelled out in the raw material info, right?

Speaker 1  27:05
So grouping, grouping the thicknesses, even in the sawing area, would work too. But then dates, it's the same thing. I guess if you anything that gets pushed across could be grouped by thickness, by thickness, first, whether it's in sewing or in the sizes, right? George, because you're controlling what you're pushing across. And then, does that? Excuse me, and Matt, I think your question was earlier, do we want everything separated by dates? So then, does that, are you saying Matt like, well, if you separate him by date, would that mean that the everything for the eight would be cut? So you cut all the inch and 716 for the city eight, and then you cut the half inch for the eight, and then you go to the ninth. Now you go back to inch and 716 for the ninth, half inch for the night, you know, like, sort of this, yeah, and

Matthias Miller  28:06
you could obviously rearrange them, but that's how it would come in. That's how it

Speaker 1  28:10
would that's how it would cross, which is fine, right? George, that's fine, because a lot of times that you don't have every size every day. So, so I think your sort that order that you're talking about, if you do thicknesses first and then date like, that's that's good, okay?

Speaker 1  28:42
Right? Or in the gang saws George, do you want sickness to override date? Do you want date to even be a fax or, like, everything that you send over? Yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  28:56
gonna have a date. Because I don't want

Speaker 3  28:58
to work what stuff it will happen from that one. I mean, so. But

Speaker 1  29:01
do you want to auto generated eat one day at a time? Or do you want, like, everything that you send over that's half inch is all lumped together no matter what the date is? Okay? So dates shouldn't affect the site, like, if it's sent to the size or list, right then the date shouldn't Separate the same thicknesses, right?

Matthias Miller  29:29
All right, okay,

Matthias Miller  29:39
so I

Unknown Speaker  29:49
so emergency or

Speaker 3  29:58
buying. Them, huh, didn't bring anything down. 40 ones for the 128. 40 ones, 41 bottle blocks, towers, okay, 20 eights can take them down. Where are they? Somewhere around here before, yeah, they gonna take over here. Take around, but sure.

Matthias Miller  30:31
All right, so think that's

Speaker 3  30:38
building down there, does? He usually builds them up here, yeah, 40 ones on 28 Well, 28 we do that on there. 40 ones. We already saw them do that.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Go ahead, Matt. We're just sorry. We're just all right.

Matthias Miller  30:55
Yeah, no worries. I'm just chasing some stuff on my end. So I think, I think I see give me ones.

Matthias Miller  31:18
All right, so Then I

Matthias Miller  31:29
this one i

Unknown Speaker  32:03
Lots of land

Speaker 3  32:17
and salon I

Unknown Speaker  32:26
backwards. Well, I

Matthias Miller  33:00
here All right, So I think,

Unknown Speaker  33:21
feedback Okay,

Speaker 3  33:40
oh, No, the meeting here was the management team with a

Unknown Speaker  33:51
lot money. No, but I'm saying about the computer

Unknown Speaker  34:00
thing yesterday and

Speaker 3  34:05
internet stuff, emails, yeah, overall, he said he was supposed to fall in the Morning. And then we do, like, Scout these lists mostly, man, we want him to do email and stuff, but, yeah, he hasn't followed yet. I call him next,

Matthias Miller  34:34
all right. Well, I mean, I can make these adjustments. I'm slightly worried that there's still things getting lost in translation. But I don't really know what to do besides make these adjustments and just circle back around, which I could do. In about,

Unknown Speaker  34:56
yeah, that's fine, Matt.

Matthias Miller  34:58
In about, I. I don't know, 510 minutes or 1015 minutes, just

Speaker 1  35:04
call me. That's fine. I got a bunch of stuff. George is leaving at 11 here, and you and I can roll for it. Then that's fine. Okay, yeah, that's good. Appreciate it. Alright, man, thank you. Yep, yep. You bet.
