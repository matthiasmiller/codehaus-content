Unknown Speaker  07:44
How do I pull How do I get it make. Hey Matt you there. Hey. here, okay, So, what am I doing here? Oh, why that goes away. I lost the silver limb. We should. We should. What's that we should bookmark the homepage that would make your life easier. You find I knew how to do that, that would be, there's there's a little oh one, yeah, share your screen. I can show you what's that. Share your screen, and I can show you am I not sharing it? Not yet. I did missing one button or something. Okay, now, if I get this top thing to go, can this go away up top. There it goes, yeah. You drag it around. There you go. Hit the little star on the top, right beside the key, yep. And then name it what you want. Name is silver. I mean, so sure, silver limb program, that's our program, SPC program. Sure that works. You don't care. Get It Done, done. So then, when I want to go there again, I do here. Go there quick then.

Matthias Miller  10:06
Now, well, if we go now, if you go to all bookmarks, we could actually move that onto the bookmark bar. So if you click that, there you go, right there. There it is. Okay, got it

Unknown Speaker  10:20
all right, nice. I'll learn something today. That's good. I learned something yesterday, too. Have you learned anything today yet?

Matthias Miller  10:35
Oh, my goodness. I hope so. I Well, let's go into the sizers cut list. Okay,

Matthias Miller  10:54
just looking any better.

Speaker 1  10:58
I mean, sorry I I'm not like, quite sure what I should be looking for. Like, in other words, what do you want me to see

Matthias Miller  11:09
so at this point, I mean, if you jump into the brewer schedule, I mean, basically everything should be based it should be as it was. So if you go into the brewer schedule, okay, yeah, and I schedule all of these things, just for kicks and giggles. I mean, okay, we are not showing the cuts right now. Okay. I don't know why this is taking a giant step back. I am pretty confident the changes I made were important to make, and I'm also open to because it's a goof on my end, I'm open to not billing them, considering how close we are to capping out the budget. But

Matthias Miller  12:06
something feels off with the project, and I can't put my finger on it, okay?

Speaker 1  12:10
Well, I mean, it my feeling and is we were, like a week ago. We were real close. We were working on those little like, that wedge nuance we were working on, the taking the raw material, sizing it down for different raw material, on the next phase, which, like all that stuff, was good progress. And then, yeah, so. And then, when you had the I don't know ideas, or, I wasn't 100, I wasn't tracking all of that with you, but, you know, I thought, well, I don't know, but, like the format, or, sorry, the way that things are appearing, or, like, really close to, I mean, I'd like, pretty good i or, in other words, like, was just shifting a couple things around yet, is what I yeah, what seemingly, seemingly, and from my perspective, I don't know. I don't know the the the nuts and bolts of all of this. I know there's a lot, a lot there, and so those are where. That's where I don't always, I don't, I try to speak from my perspective with respect to what's happening in there.

Matthias Miller  13:36
So I think we are okay. So what's the like? What's not to like in right here, right now? So, yeah, let me take so up until last Friday felt like great momentum. Biggest, biggest. So if you go back, there's the biggest, biggest functional change that you can actually see, and that's that's maybe one of the frustrating things, is that there's not a lot of visible momentum. But if you back up to the previous screen. I don't understand. I suspect it has something to do. I don't understand why there's not any automatic can't length or can't calculations going on. Um, sure, that's confusing, confusing to me, but you can put in the size or can quantity here. So if you jump over to the size or can't quantity, you can pop in, you know, get down a little bit, you can pop in 20 here, yes, or whatever,

Unknown Speaker  14:36
yeah. So what do you? Excuse me,

Matthias Miller  14:42
what are you saying? Matt, if you pop in a can quantity here, like 20,

Unknown Speaker  14:46
okay,

Matthias Miller  14:50
and you, and you hop over into the printout, or you, or you see it now on that screen. Now it's showing 2020, of those cans in the description. If you pop into the schedule. Uh, either way. Right now, it's showing that, where are we now, right there. So that is the biggest functional change, as long as they didn't break a whole bunch of things along the way. Okay? So I guess my question is, I'm what, what is, what really is next steps here,

Unknown Speaker  15:31
okay, is this, sorry?

Matthias Miller  15:34
Well, I think, I think there's two potential things, first of all, one, did I break anything? Is there anything unclear? Because there is now the concept of work orders, where we're grouping similar items together, which I changed based on our discussions, and you can move them apart and move them around. So that's a thing. So which, which I have not shown anybody, how to do that. I could walk you through that if you want to. But it's, it's moving those things around. It's the camp quantity, which I showed you. It's making sure that nothing broke in the process, and figuring out whether this is actually good enough that George can literally start using this to do his scheduling. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  16:17
so, I mean, I have to kind of play with it, probably a little bit here, if that's okay.

Speaker 2  16:22
Yep, that's fine.

Speaker 1  16:30
You were, what were you saying about can quantity a minute ago, or size, or can't size?

Matthias Miller  16:36
So the what I was saying a minute ago about the camp quantity is that we're supposed to have automatic calculation that figures out right. And for some reason that's not calculating, and I'm not completely sure why yet, okay, but I can take a look into that.

Unknown Speaker  16:56
Are you confident that can be resolved? Yes,

Matthias Miller  16:58
yes,

Speaker 1  17:00
sure. Yeah, I'm stretching that. Okay. This is me nit picking, but some of these small things, like, Can some of these be centered? Or you're just needs to go right, I guess? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  17:18
what do you well just

Speaker 1  17:20
by six, that text probably needs to go to the right edge of the box, like, like everything else. But anyway, sorry, I'm just

Matthias Miller  17:28
that's not, I mean, I'm I'm not. I noticed order items should probably be just a tad wider too.

Speaker 1  17:36
Uh, yeah, yes, I can I do that right now. Well,

Matthias Miller  17:40
you can, it won't, but it won't save, won't save, okay, but I'll do it on my end, alright, so that's right aligned. Try to think. See if there's mentions.

Speaker 1  17:48
Should probably write out. I mean, you want those right aligned? Everything else is so, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  17:57
let me see if there's any other, I mean, order item. Um, sort orders right aligned, but, but those first columns are otherwise left aligned. And then we get to work order, can't notes, which is left aligned? Which I think makes

Unknown Speaker  18:14
sense? Where, yeah, sorry, work

Matthias Miller  18:17
if you size or can't notes,

Speaker 1  18:20
um, we second here. Where are you? Farther, right? Oh yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:28
those guys, all that stuff and that, that could be a little bit wider.

Speaker 1  18:35
Yeah, sure, yeah, I'm gonna get George that bigger, bigger screen. So, um, yeah, so, little bit of nitpick stuff there, um, silver. Okay, so I'm looking at here's silver number scheduled. Yes, that could be centered, right? That's scheduled, yes or whatever. Yeah, center that one. I like that. Sort orders, right, completed is right. Order items

Matthias Miller  19:12
completed would make sense to center as well. Then, yeah,

Speaker 1  19:15
perfect, perfect. And sort order would be centered as well. I like that okay, and even like, if there's ones that we can like inventory pieces could be centered, because that's so what about just doing all the ones where we're entering data, just center those. We could size our candidates should be left, right, just should be, yeah, see miscellaneous prep could probably be centered as well.

Matthias Miller  19:52
Inventory pieces

Unknown Speaker  19:55
and Brewer could be centered. Or right because the next door neighbor

Matthias Miller  20:10
can't size, can't quantity, size or length, can't quantity, can't notes you want center?

Speaker 1  20:24
Um, probably left is fine there, because start on, yeah, left is good. I like that.

Matthias Miller  20:31
What about miscellaneous prep?

Unknown Speaker  20:34
Think that could be centered.

Matthias Miller  20:36
And then, do you want the for sign? Do you want the raw material? The raw materials same, similar place with that centered as well,

Speaker 1  20:43
sewing raw material. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, raw material

Matthias Miller  20:51
and then grammar centered as well.

Speaker 1  20:55
Yeah, think so. Okay, let me go back to that. Do you have all that? Matt, so Okay, let me go back to this page. Well, while we're on the subject, so this page here, like here we have the can quantity 20. It's kind of like lost in these numbers here, like, that needs to be very obvious. Um, you know that 20 number needs to be very obvious.

Matthias Miller  21:39
Um, so how, what's the best?

Speaker 1  21:42
Well, here, here, one thing here I would love to see would be this 10% waste that equals 33 could just be gone. Be gone, yeah, because we have the 33 down here.

Matthias Miller  21:59
Okay,

Speaker 1  22:01
and, then so just the equals 33 and then parentheses next to the W, do

Matthias Miller  22:11
you want the Do you still want the space in the in there? 10% space? W,

Speaker 1  22:17
yeah, I like that. Well, what do you think? I don't

Matthias Miller  22:21
care. Yes, you're the expert here on this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  22:26
Oh, if I'm the expert, I'm

Matthias Miller  22:29
well, I mean, my point being,

Speaker 1  22:33
yeah, I guess I have a good idea what works here.

Matthias Miller  22:38
It's this is more workflow, business stuff than it is. Yeah, I might have some ideas, but,

Speaker 1  22:45
right, sure, so there and then that, W, then parentheses. Is it possible for you to always, there's always, like, three spaces there before the can quantity, yeah,

Matthias Miller  23:03
give me here. Let me, let me, let me find where I'm at, and I can make these changes real time. And then it does nothing. There's nothing to and

Speaker 1  23:10
then the can quantity should be like, I don't know, underlined, or if you say 20 dash space, three and a half. There's another dash after the three, but it just that that number needs to stick out. It needs to be, it's, it's normally the No, oh, I know what. George always circles it right now on the cut list, well, he doesn't. When we did him by hand, we always circled the 23 and a half by 610 foot that always got a big circle around it. And like when you looked at that paper, it was pretty obvious. Anyway, doesn't have to be circle, but that 20 needs to pop out.

Matthias Miller  24:11
We could put double underscores on either side.

Speaker 1  24:15
Sure. I mean, that makes sense, something like that. Yep,

Matthias Miller  24:19
let me, let me see if I can.

Unknown Speaker  24:24
That makes that could, that could be good, man,

Matthias Miller  24:29
I could. Let me see if I can find a size or schedule, put some together that you can get a visual at least,

Matthias Miller  24:50
except if it's blank, obviously, I.

Unknown Speaker  25:41
Oh, Hang On. I

Unknown Speaker  26:13
Michael, Michael, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:31
yeah,

Speaker 1  26:36
I have No idea. I have no idea. They take chip orders. No, the ladies take chip orders. John supervises the area. That's all I know. Are they from? Last winter? I

Matthias Miller  27:15
Oh, that's the key description right? All Right? I

Matthias Miller  28:40
All right, let me know if you see that text,

Unknown Speaker  28:55
yeah, yes, okay, yeah, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Matthias, all right, back on the sizers cut list page. Well,

Speaker 1  29:17
anyway, yeah, back on the sizers cut list page we're going to do scheduled. Do we go, are we going to roll? That is, do you have dimensions going right right side

Matthias Miller  29:32
as well? We let's see, yes, dimensions right side. Yeah,

Speaker 1  29:35
perfect. Alright, so I'm just looking through here, so scheduled, the functionality of that, I don't think we had any issues there. Did we with the yes,

Matthias Miller  29:45
no, I don't think so. Sort Order. Does that still work? Yes, it's now. The little nuance that on scheduled sort order and completed is that we are now thinking these, thinking of these, in concepts of work order. Work Orders. So if you have two of them that are grouped together, and you schedule one of them, it's going to schedule both of them at the same time. So okay, hold on. So like sawing, if you have the same sawing, if you have the same raw material, the same thickness, width and date, then it's going to group into the same work order. You schedule one, it's going to schedule all three, yeah, however many. Does that make sense? Yep. And if you want to split it apart, you can, that's what the move items does. Or you can move it around. But that's

Unknown Speaker  30:38
yeah, moving items use. Where's that?

Matthias Miller  30:41
The move items here. So the button on the top right, oh, so that'll move the selected row. You click move items. And I don't think there are other work orders currently open. If you hit the drop down, you can see, but so that's how you that's how you can split things apart and move them around so there is no other so if you, if you Hit Continue, yeah, yes. And now refresh

Speaker 1  31:21
right here. Yep, reload the bit.

Matthias Miller  31:25
Reload the page. All right. Now you'll see, all right, I don't know which one that was, yeah. Now you'll see

Speaker 1  31:30
those. Well, there was nothing highlighted. No, you did

Matthias Miller  31:34
have one row highlighted. It would have been the two and a half by two and a half by 60. So now click on the two and a half by two and a half by either the 48 or the 95 okay, and then hit move items and then hit the drop list here. That's not the right one. Then this hang on,

Matthias Miller  32:15
which One twist I

Matthias Miller  32:37
now something i

Matthias Miller  33:14
i thought that one was on the same Never mind we don't Have any. We don't we don't actually have anything 27 we yanked it from 23 and then we yanked 23 All right, never mind that that I thought we had some ones that were grouped together, but I don't,

Unknown Speaker  33:38
okay. I don't

Matthias Miller  33:39
think we do so, but, but that's anyway, that's, that's the detail, but we, we can keep going. Besides that all that works just like it always did.

Speaker 1  33:50
Um, okay, so where are we at here? Sorry, back on this schedule work. Sort Order. So, okay, sort order the work orders the work orders are. It is everything has a work order number. A work order is only going to include multiple items if they're the exact same size and species, right? What? Okay, so will that only include items that have been sent to the sewing list? Yes, okay, that's when it becomes a work order Correct. Well, if I send, say, if I don't, if I have multiple sides, but I only send one of them to the sewing schedule is never going to there's no is it? That's the only one. It's going to be network order, right? Yep, correct,

Matthias Miller  34:47
yeah, we could if you want to, well, and we can't do that. We can't automatically send it over, because you need a review process to fill in missing items. Handle all those

Unknown Speaker  35:03
automatically send what over.

Matthias Miller  35:05
You can't automatically send things over to the sawing list because you might have new products in there. Otherwise you could.

Unknown Speaker  35:21
Sorry, I'm not okay automatically,

Matthias Miller  35:28
in a perfect world, if everything were set up and you never had any new product, which is in the perfect world, but you get it, then we could, we could just immediately add all sage orders to the sewing list, or for everything in the next two weeks, automatically at it. Yeah, because but, but because we want George manually reviewing those and fixing any missing items

Speaker 1  35:49
and using inventory deducting in stock items, inventory in it. Okay, right. Sure. Gotcha. Um, um, okay, completed on that's nothing there we need to do order, quantity, due, date, single item, pieces, dimensions, total pieces, inventory, pieces needed, uh, size or waste. And if I want to adjust size or waist, I do it, what right here? Yep, okay, and then what's default on size or waist is it always 10. It's 10 unless you edit the item, which is in the item itself, right? If I, if I edit this particular order, what would remain that way until I either re edit it or the order is done?

Matthias Miller  36:53
Yes, and, and if you get a new order, then the new order is going to be 10, or whatever that item that's

Speaker 1  37:00
the default. Got it perfect sizer, additional count.

Matthias Miller  37:05
That's for scalpy, perfect

Speaker 1  37:10
size or can't pieces length is in inches, and yeah, then you, you did that so that it would deduct, like, if we tell it, hey, we're going to cut 240s out of a 96 it's going to cut 240s and we're going to throw away 16 whatever. It's still going to get 240s

Matthias Miller  37:26
Right, right.

Speaker 1  37:29
And then whatever we do with the rest of the can, like George is going to tell that, hey, save that 16 inch block off the back end. Doesn't matter with the program. It's going to get to 240s um, there could be a scenario where we do like, for example, Matt, sorry about this phone. For example, Matt, we've done. Let me think for a second. We'll run, say, 714, yeah, 14 footers, right? So we're going to cut two three footers and two four footers out of a 14. So 236 is in 248 we're going to tell this thing. We're cutting 36 is out of 40 Sorry, sorry, sorry. I think I said that right. I'm going to cut 236 inch pieces and 248 inch pieces out of a 14 footer. So two threes and two fours out of 14 is a perfect yield. But I'm cutting the threes out of a 14. It's going to say, well, you can get four three footers out of a 14 footer. What am I? Is there an override at that point that I can do? Yeah, I just have to, basically, that's what it worked out. On the other Yeah, we can work that out.

Matthias Miller  39:04
Miscellaneous prep is how you work it out. Correct,

Speaker 1  39:07
exactly? Yeah, we talked about another scenario along that line. Ish, yep, I think that's good. Matt. Um, quantities 20, because I entered 20, but it's usually going to normally, it's going to be automatic. It's supposed to be automatic. It's not working. I can come, can I come in here and change these items for one, just like I do the size or waist. I can change this here as well.

Matthias Miller  39:37
So this will change the work order, the entire work order. So if I have this batch I want to cut this batch out of eights, then I could do that. But if not, then I need to. So then. But if you don't want to change the entire batch, which what you got to do is you got to move this one. If I just want to cut this one out of eight then I got to split it. Off into new work order, and change that work order to be out of eight, and then I can add whatever I want to onto that by eight work order.

Speaker 1  40:07
Sorry, you lost. I'm sorry, man, you're saying this when you say this order, the one that's highlighted on my

Matthias Miller  40:14
or the this, this row, let's say I want to, I want this, this item. I want to cut out of eight. I don't know which one you're talking about, the one you're let's say the highlighted

Unknown Speaker  40:22
one, yeah, yeah, 120 inch.

Matthias Miller  40:28
Okay, right? There's, there's no other, there's no other poplar coming out of 120 inch. So, so it's just, this is the only thing on this work order. So you can just change it to 96 Right?

Speaker 1  40:45
Right. Now I can change this to 96 and it'll cut this order out of 96 Correct? Just like I changed the waste factor, I changed the can't length, it stayed that way until the order was done unless I change it again. But when that order came through again, it said 120 again, because that's what's in the settings.

Matthias Miller  41:07
That's right now, if you have three things that you're cutting that's the same size out of the same the the CANS apply to the entire work order, because you're cutting multiple items out of the same cans. And so if you have three things that you're cutting out of the can, and you want to keep two of them out of out of out of 10 footers, and you want to change one of them out of an eight, then you gotta break that one out into a different Yeah, work order. Does that part make sense? That

Speaker 1  41:42
makes sense. But how am I? How am I where am I going to see those three orders that are those three items that are on that work order? How am I going to be like, oh, there's those three items. They're all

Matthias Miller  41:54
going to be grouped together. They're all going to have the same Well, I mean, you can scroll to the right if you want to page or, okay, here, yeah, you can see the work order ID.

Speaker 1  42:03
Yeah, they're all going to be grouped together on the brewer schedule, but also here on this page, yes, and, but what you're just, what you just told me, is, if I change one of those, it's going to change the other two as well, correct? So if the if one, if the the three middle rows here were in that category all the same work order, right now, I would change one to 120. Others would change right along with it, right? And then, if I wanted to only change one, I would have to go to move highlight that one, go to move items. Yes. And where would I put that item? Move it? You would just

Matthias Miller  42:45
break it out into a new, new work order, which lets you change that. So now you have two work orders, the one for the old two and one for the for the one that you're working with, and you change the work order for this one over two. So what I wanted to be able to do, I wish I could. I could maybe change the heading colors. I didn't think about this.

Speaker 1  43:07
Listen, I'm with you. I'm with you. So far on this scenario, okay,

Matthias Miller  43:11
what are you so the only concern I have is that there's not good visual feedback as far as what applies to a work order and what applies to the the line item, and also,

Speaker 1  43:28
sorry, sure, individual feedback,

Matthias Miller  43:34
like looking at this, it doesn't, it's not immediately obvious that size or can quantity is a work order item, but inventory pieces is a like a line item, like a Hang on,

Speaker 1  43:46
sorry, size or can't quantity is a word item,

Matthias Miller  43:53
yeah, can't lengthen and can't quantity apply to the entire work order. Okay? Because, and they have to because, because of mixed cuts,

Unknown Speaker  44:05
that's fine, right?

Matthias Miller  44:09
And so as long as George is fine learning how these pieces play together, I guess my point is just Alright, at the risk of getting a little philosophical, but there's two things in software. One is, how easy is it to learn? And the other thing is, how easy is it to use? Yeah, and this is going to be a learning curve the way it is now, well,

Speaker 1  44:34
but he knows that he knows the data. That's one thing. Matt is like, when you look at this, yeah, data, he just needs to know, where's this, where's that, where's that thing. And okay, like he knows what he has to do. So you're you, it's not gonna be too bad.

Matthias Miller  44:50
Okay, yeah, so, so the other thing that could be useful that I played around with, and I don't have a good way to do it, but is, you. If you scroll all the way to the left, you notice the alternating colors. The sales order number,

Unknown Speaker  45:07
no, because they're all same here.

Matthias Miller  45:11
Background Color, yes,

Speaker 1  45:13
dark light, dark lightish. Not much difference. But I would love, I actually appreciate that, because it separates lines. But, yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:24
well, so these are actually separating work orders from each other.

Speaker 1  45:28
Well, then can we shade it a little more?

Matthias Miller  45:32
Yeah, do you Yes, we can, totally. Can.

Speaker 1  45:35
One's just kind of light blue, and the other one's very light blue, like,

Matthias Miller  45:42
I don't know, let's, let's do. I mean, that's easy, right? So, so then the other thing I can do, I can't put those alternating colors on fields that you can edit, but I could put those alternating colors on, okay, this is, you're tell me if this is, this might be,

Speaker 1  46:03
what do you what do you mean by feels that we can add it? You mean like the columns,

Matthias Miller  46:07
huh? Yeah, but we could, but we could add these same alternating colors on total pieces, but

Speaker 1  46:14
they're bordered by the color Matt your little, your little, those little windows are bordered by the color.

Matthias Miller  46:25
Okay, let's say you're scrolled all the way over. And I want to know, is this the only item on a on a work order? Or are there different is there more than one on a work order? There's not a quick visual for me to say which, which one's the case. Okay, right? Is this this is probably too dark.

Unknown Speaker  46:44
My look. Are you doing on my screen? Text

Matthias Miller  46:46
message, okay, I'm gonna guess the answers, yes.

Unknown Speaker  46:52
What do you mean by too dark? Which

Matthias Miller  46:54
part are you too dark of a background on the grays, the Grays

Speaker 1  46:58
behind the blues, yeah, yeah, but we need to identify the whole way across the line. Not so. What if? What if you colored it Matt? What if you colored it by work order, like I'm you see my screen? Yeah. 22 is a dark. Is a darker blue. 20 is a very light blue. I mean, that's simple, can we? Can we? But then when I click on something that's that C has to, it has to be different from that, right, right? It does. Can use, like, a yellow tone or, I mean, yeah, green, a green, maybe something I don't care. Green, yellow, blue, green, blue, light, green, light, blue, dark green.

Matthias Miller  47:54
I'm going to take over your screen and share and you can that's all you have

Speaker 1  47:58
to do. Would be, attach the the colors with the work order numbers on the right. And then every, every, every work order has a different color. Every other one is different,

Matthias Miller  48:08
okay, but if we, if we, if we wanted to, we could also put it on some of these middle pieces, where you were, where, like it's points of reference. Sure, is that helpful or not?

Speaker 1  48:20
Well, maybe, I don't know that there's any that need highlighted, but that's a good thought, if

Matthias Miller  48:29
you're the main reason being, if you have to scroll like crazy. Yeah, that's the

Speaker 1  48:35
Yeah. One thing liked about the other setup, which whatever I we kind of picked out those colors that we had in that Excel setup. It was very pretty, pretty friendly on finding what you what you were looking for, and visually like seeing what was there, um, I see, yeah, so you're giving us, yeah,

Speaker 1  49:12
yeah. I mean, I don't know what should be where, but, or, you know, I don't know what should be what at this point.

Matthias Miller  49:20
I mean, do you literally just want it on either end? Sorry, I put this one

Unknown Speaker  49:24
on the wrong way across.

Matthias Miller  49:27
So okay, let me, let me try one other thing. I don't, I don't know if this is going to work, but let me try one other thing. And I was thinking. I was thinking, there's some issues with the platform, and that's why. Okay, so if we do so, I can do it the whole way across, but when you edit it, the background goes away, and so it's some kind of platform issue that, yeah, I.

Unknown Speaker  50:01
It can be fixed or not.

Matthias Miller  50:04
It's not going to be fixed in the near it's not going to be fixed in the near term, I could pursue getting it fixed.

Speaker 1  50:13
You're saying you can put the color there, but then it's going to go away.

Matthias Miller  50:18
As soon as you click on it, it goes away for good, yeah. Well, until you refresh, yeah. Except for these columns, where we where we had, it kind of stay in there. Another. Here's one other option. Let me show you one other idea, hopefully not getting too i To not getting whiplash from all the different ways we could tackle This.

Matthias Miller  50:58
But we could, we could do something like

Matthias Miller  51:11
just little anchor blocks. And we could even then, if we wanted to, let's try this.

Unknown Speaker  51:32
I got my

Matthias Miller  51:38
we could put that's maybe not the right color, but we could put kind of a bar down the middle that gives you a visual of of whether you're in the same or different work order.

Unknown Speaker  51:57
What if you just can you do a thin line? Yeah. I guess in black line between work orders all the way across,

Matthias Miller  52:06
oh, Between work orders.

Unknown Speaker  52:10
That stays there. I

Matthias Miller  52:38
I think I um.

Matthias Miller  52:46
We could group them by work order, but that, that, that we could, we could do. We could do blank lines between group order, between

Unknown Speaker  52:58
do? What blank lines?

Matthias Miller  52:59
Blank, lines between work orders. What

Speaker 1  53:02
did you say? Blank, blank, yeah, just as thin line.

Matthias Miller  53:07
Well, not blank. Rose, I can't add lines.

Speaker 1  53:12
Um, are we gonna lose too much? Well, is that gonna me? Yeah, I that gonna we could try it.

Matthias Miller  53:33
Should we try it? We try it? I think that's, that's, that's,

Speaker 1  53:38
yeah, you're saying you can't keep a color there. Well, the if you do a color the whole way through, like a light blue, then the next one's a dark blue, like work order by work order, but then depends where you click on, some of that color is going to go away, but the rest of the color is going to stay. Is that right? Yeah. Well, what's that matter? Okay, then I know where I was already. I was, Oh, I was playing around there already. Like, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  54:06
All right, if you're happy, I'm happy,

Speaker 1  54:10
well, how much of it is going to go away? Well, any

Matthias Miller  54:15
anything that you can't edit? Um, so, single item, pieces, dimensions, total pieces,

Speaker 1  54:23
anything that I cannot edit is going to go away. Sorry,

Matthias Miller  54:27
I got that backwards. Everything you can edit is going to go away. Well,

Speaker 1  54:33
that's all right. I mean, most of that is not editable already, right? Well, I don't know. Hazard can't

Matthias Miller  54:40
description, yeah, maybe half, yeah, it's prep subtype in this guy.

Matthias Miller  54:55
So then, so we could do that, and then we can go back to the. You.

Unknown Speaker  55:01
I like to see what that looks like. Alright,

Matthias Miller  55:03
so then let me get rid of the blank lines. If

Speaker 1  55:07
you give me three or four minutes sometime in here, be great.

Matthias Miller  55:13
All right. Well, just let me know when. Well,

Speaker 1  55:15
whenever you have I'll keep throwing work at you here.

Matthias Miller  55:19
Okay, I mean, like, like, that's what it's gonna look like.

Speaker 1  55:24
That's what's gonna look like. Because, I mean, I gotta increase my view here. Sorry, here, oh, here. Okay, no, I'm good. Okay. Where are we at? Here, all right, now I can only see some. Okay, that's fine. Matt, oh, we're looking at here. I want to what? Why is this going high low, bro,

Matthias Miller  55:50
here, let me, let me size it down for you so you can actually, I

Speaker 1  55:53
just need to see it better. That's good. All right. Okay, so I

Speaker 1  56:05
the scheduled and the sort order completed that's going to go away, and size or count and hand size, length, quantity, size, or can't notes that can go away. Am I all the way to the right?

Matthias Miller  56:33
And then these guys? I don't know, but I scrolled right on my end. You might have to go right on yours too.

Speaker 1  56:40
I'm all away. Is that the work order number? Okay, yeah, Miss prep will go away. Cut list subtype can go, I mean, it's, what are we doing, green and nothing, then green, then nothing, yeah. But

Matthias Miller  57:01
if you want to, we could do green and yellow or green

Speaker 1  57:04
and No, no, no, well, maybe green and yellow. Yeah, that's fine. Let's do that at

Matthias Miller  57:14
least try and see what it looks like.

Speaker 1  57:16
Kind of unfortunate that we can't run it the whole way through, but, but same time

Matthias Miller  57:22
I can, I can take a quick look and see what it takes. There might be still one workaround that I haven't Yeah, but sorry, red, green. What is yellow? The primary colors for yellow?

Unknown Speaker  57:41
Yeah. Man, I don't know

Matthias Miller  57:49
your chat GPT will put it together for me. It's my yellow, yellow in a similar tonal range, red, green, right, red and green. I i

Matthias Miller  58:06
All right, okay. And then you click on it, and then, boom, wait a minute, it is not just the same work order. It's the whole section or something. I don't know what it is, just when you click on it,

Unknown Speaker  58:34
you

Matthias Miller  58:40
uh, in some ways it would be easier to read if you just, well, let me, let me throw this out. Then you tell me, if you just started out like this, right,

Unknown Speaker  58:56
we would survive. And

Matthias Miller  58:58
then I can chase it. Is a bug in the platform. I can chase why it's not working and then and see what, see if I can get platform teams to fix it. So I would think they

Unknown Speaker  59:17
Yeah. And then when you go, when you highlight a row,

Speaker 1  59:26
some of it, like, where there's no color, yeah, it kind of changes the color. It like, I don't know, yeah, it'd be neat if that was the same all the way, and not just a combination there, like shaded Tim might it's tinting, it's tinting the other color. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  59:52
it is tinting the other color. What might work better is if we I mean, there might be a different color besides. Yellow that would work like if we would do red green.

Speaker 1  1:00:07
I do like that yellow and that in that green, that's a good offset. And it's, it's kind of like the wood and the it's kind of like the wood and the leaves of the tree, and it's I don't I like it,

Matthias Miller  1:00:25
all right, if you're happy enough, then I'm happy enough, and I'll see what, what can, can, what can work?

Speaker 1  1:00:34
Yeah, kind of like our logo, man, black and white and the nice green and a wood color.

Speaker 1  1:00:46
I mean, I think the functionality of all this, with the moving some of my stuff right and left, and then, if I go to, well, can I go on the screen here? Can I start using this again? Or, am I? What am I? I'm on your screen. You're

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
on my screen. You want to jump over to your screen? Or do you want to?

Speaker 1  1:01:09
I don't know, Brewer schedule, go to there again.

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
Here, hang on. Yeah. So here

Speaker 1  1:01:17
we're Yeah. Okay. So there you go, yeah, 30. I mean, I think that's good. That's good, man, I can see it. I think

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
slot and Snake wild. But by quarter inch deep.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:55
Yeah, I mean, I

Speaker 1  1:02:07
I yeah, I mean, it's, this is the quantum pieces right here.

Speaker 1  1:02:21
I mean, I don't want, I'm not going to nitpick right now. It's not a good time to nitpick. So I'm not going to do that, like underline this or but I, you know, anyway, I think about that stuff. Yeah, man, I don't. Hey, I don't. I mean, I think you, you did. Let me try to think here, if you could figure out that auto can't deduction thing or the can't counts, right? Yep, that would be, that's going to be pretty big. We're going to have to get in here, start using it. I mean, I don't see anything else right now. Okay, okay, I don't. Let's go to sewing Yes, sewing list. Let's just look at that sewing schedule, the printout of the sewing schedule.

Matthias Miller  1:03:14
Hang on. There's one thing here, raw material, info. Sawing is gonna have to be more like that. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
yeah, it's a

Matthias Miller  1:03:25
lot of room here, huh? Lot more on that than on the other one, yeah, what's that? Yeah, there's a lot more room on song than there's on the sizing schedule,

Speaker 1  1:03:34
sort order completed on and then that, that whole, that whole spiel with, like, sending um, changing the raw material data, or do you feel like that's all

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
taken care of, like, the the wedges and stuff, or something else? Well, like, Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:03:57
so like, raw material on one soul, right? The can't, the raw material and I saw is what was cut on the first whatever. So

Matthias Miller  1:04:05
there's two ways we can handle it. And I'm not completely settled on the way that I did it, but what I did is if, if you do not, if this is the same, if, if you do not change the saw that it's on and it's the same basic recipe that you're using in there. Then when we translate into from, from, order, quantity, time, single item, pieces, the total pieces will auto adjust based on on the saw yield.

Speaker 1  1:04:40
Now the way we I'm not I'm not kidding. 100% what thought up here. Um Sorry, but you're saying,

Matthias Miller  1:04:52
Let me, here's what I wish I would have done. I wish what I would it would have and I think it's probably a better way to do it. Tell me what. You think when you go from Sage to the cut list, we automatically adjust the single item pieces based on the saw yield

Speaker 1  1:05:11
sage to cut list. Automatically adjust single item. Sorry. Say that again. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:05:21
so when you in the item, we got two different saws running. And so when we go from Sage and we translate it over into one line item per saw, then if the first saw doubles it, then instead of saying we need two pieces, we'll say we need one.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
I'm sorry, Matt, every time you say something different, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:05:46
sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. Let me do it again. Same way.

Speaker 1  1:05:51
Just repeat the text. Sometimes I can't talk. Fair

Matthias Miller  1:05:54
enough. So our brain, I understand. I understand. So when you take it from the sage order, over onto the silver

Unknown Speaker  1:06:05
line cut list.

Matthias Miller  1:06:06
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
So there's two ways we could do it, and the one way I just like the literally last one I said, was for saw one because saw one doubles the output. We could say this, it only needs a single item piece.

Speaker 1  1:06:27
Oh, so, so one's never just going to double the output, like they don't really

Matthias Miller  1:06:34
or saw two and whatever. But if saw two, does then saw one and saw two would have half the single item pieces?

Speaker 1  1:06:42
Yeah, I know, but that doesn't always like, they don't automatically split the lumber, like, like we do different setups, you know, like our sizers, they have different yields based on what we set it up for. Even our Ripper planer, we can split a one inch into two half inch, but we can also run a whole bunch of one inch through that without splitting it like it doesn't automatically split.

Matthias Miller  1:07:14
Well, I mean, the split is still defined based on

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21
based on the order,

Matthias Miller  1:07:24
based on this.

Speaker 1  1:07:27
Sorry, show me, yeah. Show me what you're saying on the saw multiplier you at here. Okay, the split is defined by, okay, yeah, here we go. It's the saw multiplier which means I have to come in here. Quantities, one, half of 612,

Speaker 1  1:07:56
so raw material. One, by six hardwood is these, the mode of what is the multiplier, saw one yield?

Matthias Miller  1:08:12
Is that saw two doubles the yield. So that means, so what? So

Speaker 1  1:08:18
one doubles yield, because we have point five right here, the knot, oh, saw two multiplier is two. What do we come up with? The yield number here is that this?

Matthias Miller  1:08:31
This one? Yeah, so this is this quantity divided by the saw two multiplier, right? And then this raw material quantity is this quantity divided by the saw one multiplier, which we don't have a saw one multiplier,

Speaker 1  1:08:52
right, right, the multiplier is right. So that's is that that's based on, this is particular item data here, right?

Matthias Miller  1:09:08
That is correct. So when this item gets sent across, the question is, how do we want to handle it when it gets pushed across,

Speaker 1  1:09:21
pushed across to from the order to sewing schedule Correct. How do you want to handle what part of it?

Matthias Miller  1:09:30
Well, the adjusted quantities.

Speaker 1  1:09:35
Um, so let's send that one across here. Well, we don't have

Matthias Miller  1:09:39
one. Do we I have, I think I have one of my

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
on that old one on the 14th, I think, or 17th of April. Okay, here's

Matthias Miller  1:09:49
this one. And I'm also, I'm, it was rzc, and it was the MX 10.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
I MX 10, Yep, alright, so I'm going

Matthias Miller  1:09:59
to send the. Over, okay, now, sawing All right, so MX, 10,

Speaker 1  1:10:14
scheduled order, five and 250, and 20, boom, boom. Let half inch blenders. There's the so it has the same

Matthias Miller  1:10:31
work order that is not. Hold on. Well,

Speaker 1  1:10:39
I'm not. I mean, I don't know what you're saying. If, because it's a three and a half and the other one's 40, that shouldn't be the same work order.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
Is that what you're saying? Man, uh,

Matthias Miller  1:11:01
yeah. Well, that is an issue.

Speaker 1  1:11:06
Well Or no, well, not. It's not no. Send it to the cut list. Once we're doing the

Matthias Miller  1:11:13
thickness, we are just grouping by thickness, all right, so if we pull the sewing schedule

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
thickness and can't and

Matthias Miller  1:11:23
the raw material sickness

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
and can't size, actually, that's actually fine.

Matthias Miller  1:11:32
All right, oops, here it is. All right, so why sawing list? Okay, now I'm really confused because we got these all scheduled.

Speaker 1  1:11:48
Yeah, I love to see it on there right now. Oh, my goodness. All

Matthias Miller  1:11:54
right, here's your four to five minutes.

Speaker 1  1:11:55
Four to five minutes. Thank you sir. I'll be right back. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:12:16
Appreciate it. Hey, Quick thing I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
Thank You. I

Speaker 1  1:16:22
That's not the right one. I A day for Michael, or John Glenn. copy, yeah, can one of you guys run on to see which car alarm is going off in the parking lot, and let Tina know You can call somebody you shut off. Thank you. Applause. Yeah, Matt, I'm good. I mean, I have stuff to do. If you're into it. Let me know if you if you got a little bit more. Yeah, you're good. You're good. I got Good. Yeah, i Hey, Matt, do you have? Do I have five minutes or so yet? Yeah, okay, thanks. I'm gonna Perfect. Oh, shoot, I need that's my Oh, here I can stop by sharing. You can just There you go. All right, I can do what I want right now for A little bit. Yeah, here i Oh, here we go. Yeah, Madam, how about how much time do I have now?

Matthias Miller  1:23:19
Depends if you want to jump back in. I'm taking a look at the can't stuff, but if you want to take another five or 10 minutes, it's fine. Or we can jump back into the can stuff again for the

Speaker 1  1:23:27
size. If I have five to 10 I do that. Okay, let's do it. I'll be Right. I'll be back real soon. You

Matthias Miller  1:34:05
Hey, buddy, hey, all right, well, I got the can calculations working again, except There's one here that is, we, we, we need? Well, I don't know. Maybe this is right. What you seem, right? This one here, it says we need 724 kids. Which

Unknown Speaker  1:34:36
line you on that? I'm sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:34:38
this one right here. Do you see it?

Speaker 1  1:34:41
Yeah, we're cutting low, 60 or 40, say, for pieces. Okay, wait. We need, we need to

Matthias Miller  1:34:51
produce 400 pieces, but we need 724 cans to do it. Oh, I don't

Speaker 1  1:34:59
see the. Answer yet, oh, there. Wait a minute. What do we got here? Which we need? 4042. Is the order seven pieces, 294, 323, and 724 cans. So let's go into the data. Does the data page show us the riddle? Yeah. Let's do item, item page.

Matthias Miller  1:35:35
Let's Yeah. Let's go into the item. I

Matthias Miller  1:35:44
so this one's the

Matthias Miller  1:35:53
there's one to slot, one to not this is the seven.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:00
That's the non slotted

Matthias Miller  1:36:02
here. It says, I wonder a better place to go would be

Matthias Miller  1:36:21
if we go into

Matthias Miller  1:36:28
let's Start by seeing how many you

Matthias Miller  1:36:38
See it's saying, I

Matthias Miller  1:36:48
size replaces and

Matthias Miller  1:37:23
sky, 47

Matthias Miller  1:37:36
let's Take it back to where it was.

Matthias Miller  1:37:43
47 divided by 23 that's going the wrong way. I

Matthias Miller  1:38:18
So it's saying we need a 47

Matthias Miller  1:38:30
can't Hear No, we need. Yeah, it's saying we need. I,

Speaker 1  1:39:11
Hey, Matt, I have a I need to get together with two guys for about 10 minutes before 430 here. Yeah, um, so you care if I do that now and then, get back on with you. Yep, okay, um, can I hop off my computer? Is that right? Yep, that's fine. I
