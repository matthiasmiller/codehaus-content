Howdy. Howdy. Pardon my chewing.

Unknown Speaker  00:38
No worries. Um, um, that

Unknown Speaker  00:43
was an interesting conversation.

Matthias Miller  00:46
Yeah, he and I talked a little bit yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  00:52
What about what

Matthias Miller  00:58
about them, whether they do RTF software and how he feels about

Speaker 1  01:01
it, yep. So I'd say probably a good 45 minutes of explaining RTO and he had Joel on and really sort of making the case for RTO. That was funny. It was so much fun because it was, it was totally not where I thought we were talking about. And so when I finally figured out what we were, the questions he was wanting to know, I just laughed. I said, this is not what I was expecting today, but this is gonna be fun. So

Unknown Speaker  01:41
that's awesome. It

Speaker 1  01:44
was actually a lot of fun because I I've had this conversation so many times that it was just fun to have it again, and, and, and, yeah, it was just fun.

Matthias Miller  01:58
That's good. I love it. You guys come to any confusion conclusions? Well,

Speaker 1  02:05
I think I convinced them that they wanted to build RTO software. So, yeah, that's a that's a good conclusion. Now the question is, can I afford it? So

Matthias Miller  02:16
well, that's another fun question. So here I'm going to do this. So.
