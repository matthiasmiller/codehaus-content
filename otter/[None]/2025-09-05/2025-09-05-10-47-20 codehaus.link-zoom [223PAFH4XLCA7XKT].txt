Unknown Speaker  04:05
Not going to say anymore. That's.

Matthias Miller  05:39
There we go. Hey, there we go. Sorry, I had a I downloaded the comment browser and decided to let it greet the calendar invite for you. And apparently, even computers aren't as smart as they need to be.

Unknown Speaker  06:00
Well, we tell them what to do, right? Tell

Matthias Miller  06:03
them what to do. And it went off. And it's a little AI agent thing so you can watch it create the event. Yeah, it'll, it'll look good first glance, but obviously, nail it.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
Here we are. Yeah,

Speaker 1  06:25
um, I have a couple things on my side. What do you have on your side?

Matthias Miller  06:28
I mean, biggest thing for me is going into, kind of going over the historical, the assembly tracker stuff and, yeah, yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  06:41
I think my biggest I have, yeah, that I want to, but John's having a couple issues, and I'm guessing they're operator errors, but I'm not exactly sure. Can we look at those quick? Yep, hopefully it's quick. I'm not screen share.

Matthias Miller  07:14
Oh, sorry, no, you do it on your

Speaker 1  07:16
score. Well, don't matter. Okay, what do i Where's my tab to share? I don't know. Seeing it?

Matthias Miller  07:25
Sorry, it should be a green button somewhere on the zoom window.

Speaker 1  07:29
It's not there right now. Here it is. I got, I had to go full. Okay, got it, you know? Yeah, okay, that'll Oh, okay, here we go.

Speaker 1  07:52
This guy's a little Get out of my way. Always go. All right, I need to go. I'm trying to find I'm forgetting how to go into items. I want to look at a specific item history,

Matthias Miller  08:13
to the assembly tracker. Okay, and then hit the title up top assembly tracker with the drop down arrow.

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Oh, crackers. All right, yeah.

Speaker 1  08:40
This guy, John's saying he's still having issues in here with an entry,

Speaker 1  08:57
we have matching sage orders that I can look at. Let me just remind me, Matt, down here at the bottom, these are unresolved, or these are sage orders that have not been attached. Or what are these at the

Matthias Miller  09:14
bottom? Yeah, have a remaining balance in some capacity.

Unknown Speaker  09:18
Yeah. So up top is

Speaker 1  09:26
history? Well, I guess I should look at that. Is there any of these with remaining balance?

Speaker 1  09:45
I mean, there's not, how's that, because he was saying that he he wasn't able to attach sides and ends or something like that. Back to the order, but I'm not seeing it here anywhere.

Matthias Miller  10:06
He he sent me a text. The other morning, I sent him a text back, trying to trying to clarify, and it didn't make sense to me what he was, the worker number that he gave me just I couldn't see what what he meant.

Speaker 1  10:21
He said, Okay, the work of, sorry. The Work Order Number was this, top, 112833,

Matthias Miller  10:27
okay, and this was

Speaker 1  10:38
242, minutes. They completed 20

Unknown Speaker  10:53
what,

Matthias Miller  11:01
but he has partial work order there.

Matthias Miller  11:15
I expanded this list more broadly.

Speaker 1  11:20
This list needs one little thing. The years are running together.

Speaker 2  11:25
They are running together. How is Yeah? Is

Unknown Speaker  11:37
that a simple thing you can do right now?

Matthias Miller  11:41
Not without pushing an update. No, okay,

Unknown Speaker  11:45
um, if I go back here.

Matthias Miller  11:50
So the latest 120 25 like the latest one I'm seeing with an open quantity, is for June 19. But you're saying you have this other one.

Speaker 1  12:06
So 18 one? Well, here's Where's something I'm seeing. Look at this. John, Matt, like here was 828, the day before they were doing pallets size and ends. Let me open that he attached it. Yeah, he did the 20 right there, right there he he said they were completed, which they weren't. This should have been a time entry only. So now we go back and he's trying to keyhole this. The rest of it, apparently, seven to nine, which is the next day, seven o'clock, and he's saying another 20, which God picking dude.

Matthias Miller  13:02
So how did it even I'm not even sure how the system would do that. I thought I'd

Unknown Speaker  13:08
block that, but maybe not.

Speaker 1  13:09
Apparently it's locked. It's not taking it. It's it won't take another 20, but he's trying to attach this to the original 20. Right? That right there. If I go like that, darn that's not right. So let me.

Unknown Speaker  13:26
Let me just do this.

Speaker 1  13:33
So I go back here, this obviously should have been displayed nothing. And save because it was, let me look here, yeah until 430 so that was the end of the day. Save that back over. Now we go here, and we say 20, and now we say, wherever it's at no it's not showing. Why is

Unknown Speaker  14:14
it not showing?

Speaker 1  14:19
Now we have the partial now we have the partial work order down here, right?

Matthias Miller  14:24
Yeah, that's, that's what it was supposed to be, and he had put that in there. I didn't, I didn't think the system let him wait a minute. It's just wait a minute.

Speaker 1  14:36
Well, the sage order might not be there anymore, because it was sold now, right.

Matthias Miller  14:42
Let's go back. Okay. Do we know what sage order it should have been for? Was it? Is it the one that's hanging out open?

Speaker 1  14:51
There's none. I mean, I'm not unless I can, there's not open anymore for whatever he he had took, he took. It with the 828, entry, and I just delete, I just,

Matthias Miller  15:07
is that? I mean, is that? Is that the sales order? Well, let's do this. Let's go find out. Let me do this. This guy,

Speaker 1  15:20
I'm not tired of it seriously. I mean, at some point I just, at some point, I gotta do something different, make some changes.

Matthias Miller  15:33
Yeah, I don't disagree.

Matthias Miller  15:40
8029, let's go find out what is going on with that sales order. Okay, here we're seeing it is showing a balance. Okay, I did admittedly here, let me. Let me check my other thing. Let me make sure the update didn't,

Unknown Speaker  15:55
didn't mess anything up. I

Unknown Speaker  16:04
max, okay, have I a little bit of lunch? Want

Matthias Miller  16:07
to have a minute Absolutely? Thanks. Go for it. Yep, so that's the work that's showing.

Speaker 1  16:16
But yeah, he entered the quality completed when they did the first leg instead of when they did the assembly leg, okay?

Matthias Miller  16:28
And I think I might have, I hate how complicated this is, that we should be a way to simplify some of this sage words. Okay, so this is this one we're going here.

Matthias Miller  16:55
It's not stock, so the minimum due date must be due on or after it was completed. So it was completed on the 29th and that One should qualify. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  17:30
five, what Is opponent? What Is

Unknown Speaker  18:14
it I'm I'm So

Unknown Speaker  19:20
I landed

Matthias Miller  19:46
what are these items? Ladies?

Unknown Speaker  19:57
Okay. This is the

Unknown Speaker  20:24
Guy.

Unknown Speaker  20:40
There it is,

Unknown Speaker  20:52
there.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
There, because

Unknown Speaker  21:58
John

Speaker 1  22:00
Murphy, that burger right? Do you have silver or not at all? How many? How many pallets were you trying to enter on burger? Oh, 3.5 how many like? How many more needed? And

Speaker 1  22:34
well that that order number that you, that you gave you use that for 58 on on Wednesday, right?

Speaker 1  23:00
Okay, that's what 126 yesterday. Yeah, gotcha.

Speaker 1  23:14
Well, I don't know why San quantity needed 133 because

Speaker 1  23:24
wow, okay, I'll find out next. Yep,

Speaker 2  24:47
yeah or the.

Matthias Miller  25:55
Is there? Is it going to be an issue for anybody if I kick off an update and log people out,

Speaker 1  26:01
let me check with Joe. George. Okay, right back. Right. How long would that take?

Matthias Miller  26:12
Five to 10 minutes at most.

Speaker 1  26:43
Yeah, good to go. Matt, right. Well, hang on, I'm on it. Let me close out. Well, I mean, does it matter?

Matthias Miller  26:51
It doesn't matter, as long as you have anything you need to save.

Speaker 1  26:54
No, I don't. I'll close I'll close out anyway. I'm just looking at stuff. I do you

Unknown Speaker  27:08
need a little bit of time on your side

Matthias Miller  27:10
of Yeah, I mean, it'll take, yeah, once, once the update's done, we can, I'm picking it up right now. There's not much to do until it's done, and then we can take a look at it.

Unknown Speaker  27:20
Okay. Um, does that make is that keep you busy?

Matthias Miller  27:29
I know I can keep we can jump elsewhere, for sure.

Unknown Speaker  27:33
Oh, okay, um, well, he has another item there. Where, like

Speaker 1  27:43
the the the quantity ordered, the quantity needed, is different than it's different than where he's at. And I'm guessing that's probably a result of numbers getting scrambled in previous entries,

Matthias Miller  28:07
I'm gonna guess. So, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  28:13
Because is anything coming off automatically, or is it it's just his numbers.

Matthias Miller  28:26
I mean his, no, not more than I mean,

Speaker 1  28:29
sorry, any the quantities that are deducted from Sage orders are they always done manually?

Matthias Miller  28:38
Yeah, yes.

Speaker 1  28:40
So if the number scrambled, it was scrambled manually, like a A roll number was entered or whatever. Yeah, so what be a simple way to go back? We should be able to go back and look at well, question is, do the do we do we still have the sage order number history, like in other words, can we easily see where is there a simple way to figure out where the number got scrambled?

Matthias Miller  29:17
Yeah, we can, as soon as we get

Unknown Speaker  29:19
This. Yep, sounds good. Sounds good. That's good. Matt,

Speaker 1  29:53
if you're if you're working, I'm going to eat if you're not working, I'm going to fire another question at you. Fire another

Matthias Miller  29:59
question. Hi,

Unknown Speaker  30:01
how you doing? Pick up first. Well,

Unknown Speaker  30:10
I think,

Matthias Miller  30:13
oh, I don't know. Man, we're getting ready for the we're going to be at the shed Expo, and so we're taking that book, wrote it this summer, and I am so I think I would like to think, personally, I'm doing fairly well, but and the family is doing well, I'm grateful for that. I'm I I'm I feel like I'm finding my way, but boy is it harder than what i

Unknown Speaker  30:51
What's that I said?

Matthias Miller  30:52
I would like to think I'm finding my way, but boy is it way harder than what I anticipated? Yeah, so

Speaker 1  31:01
what you mean in what and what, just in what pursuit,

Matthias Miller  31:06
in the in the pursuit of business, primarily, yeah, like being in with my brother wasn't really working, and you really should have more of a I think logic says you should have a little bit more of a plan when you pull the record or pull the ejection lever.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
So there you go. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  31:44
Are you still with them,

Matthias Miller  31:47
still contracting for him? Yeah, but we're not. But I, I sold off my team and some other stuff to him, so

Unknown Speaker  32:01
you did what I'm sorry

Matthias Miller  32:02
I sold off. I sold off my software team over to him, okay, and so they saw him on some projects for me and stuff like that. I sub on some, some of his, some of his projects, but, yeah,

Speaker 1  32:17
what does that mean? Like, you have some uncertainty going forward, or what

Matthias Miller  32:21
it's been. I'm just trying to nail down a good my biggest problem. I mean, there's been a series of problems. The problem, you know, the immediate problem, is just keeping, keeping the lights on. That sounds a little extreme, but keeping the lights on. But what's the problem for that? Well, the problem for that is a flow of clients. Well, what's the problem with that? Well, it's solving a very clear, definitive problem and having a way to find those people who need that. Well, what's the problem with that? Little problem with that is that I have finding, well, it's, it's finding and nailing down that has been, that's been the problem. So it goes a few layers deep, and hopefully not over complicating it, but goes a few layers deep.

Speaker 1  33:28
So, am I like? Am I is it? So, is it like lining up some work or whatever that's like, sort of marketing, sales, type of work that you

Unknown Speaker  33:42
are in need of or something like that. Am I hearing you right? I'm not sure. I think I

Matthias Miller  33:48
mean what step number one is just baseline, enough baseline consulting word to make it work, and then, but then from there, where's the opportunity to systemize and replicate? And so part of the issue is I have this experience in the shed industry, just as an example, but and I got some inroads, but the annual Expo is where everything happens. And I've never attended, never really had a reason to going to be doing a booth, a session, all that jazz. So hopefully that turns into something, but it's it's more than that. It's like, if you put me in my completely natural geeky state, or in my perfectly natural state? Yeah, yeah. I'm a bit of a geeky, I don't know, you know, quasi visionary, quasi CFO type system, slash, I don't know what kind of person I am. I don't think to the right kind of person with the right kind of problem. Yeah, it's very interesting, but it doesn't really read well on big, flashy billboards and posters, postings and signage.

Speaker 1  35:10
Yeah, man, aren't you? You're the guy that you can organize and create systems and processes with like digital, I would say like, not just digital, right? You're, you're more than digital, for sure, um, but that that's, isn't that what you're like, that's what that's your strength.

Matthias Miller  35:42
It is, yeah, I think, yeah, I think you're right. Well, like, how much,

Speaker 1  35:48
no, and I hear where you're at. So like, if for you to repeat that process again and again. Like, would you, like, do you enjoy what you're doing with me, with us here? Is that? Like, sorry,

Matthias Miller  36:00
my number Generally, yes. My one frustration right now is we don't have big enough okay, I'm this weird place where I do actually enjoy the detail and having things check out, but I also love speed at the same time. And so my number one frustration right now is the fact that we like when it's like driving around with the e brake halfway on. Yeah. And so do I enjoy this? Yes, I think it's awesome. You know, if there's a frustration right now, it's just that we can't move faster, which I think you feel at the same. You know, feel similarly. So the part of me wants to say, All right, well, let's, let's rip out the, you know, whatever engine we have. Let's take a look at the parts. How do we put this thing back together again? So that, and what does that need to look like? And there's a lot of things that could be but

Speaker 1  36:56
Matt, to that point, if I may, the engine. I don't think there's anything wrong with the engine, because every time we've had to, every time something's needed cleaned up or clarified or however added, you've always done that. Yeah. So anyway, and you were saying, what else? Where else were you going with that?

Matthias Miller  37:23
Well, so yeah, and I Okay, here's another fun thing. I'm launching a podcast with a friend of mine. Launched on Wednesday, just this is just to prove your point. He offered to pay for an assistant to publish the podcast. I think I'd have to go back and check. I should actually check right now, let me see what I got. First got the text from Haley. We went from, we went from just having zoom recordings, just podcast recordings, to publish and Okay, August, in four weeks we we hired a podcast assistant on board of the podcast Assistant. Assistant got the process nailed down and got her first, first podcast live, like, literally got the show live with with a very part time assistant that stuff I love. Like, just put the stuff in place. Find the smart person, the smart, conscientious, hard working person who's got the skill set to get it done. Go give them the tools that they need, put in the basic process, supporting process that they need, and just go make it happen. That's the non technical side of it. On the technical side, how do you manage information like you're trying to do? How do we pull it all together? How do we structure and organize it? How does it fit into the workflow and people who are using it? Yeah, so you're not wrong. I just don't know. I just don't know how to I've struggled for eons on what's the shiny way that you bottle that up and package it for people?

Speaker 1  39:13
Well, man, don't, don't you? I mean, to look, this is you take it for one it's worth it's just me and my whatever. 48 years of whatever, I've been doing, losing, winning, some of everything. But I've done some different things, and I'm not the smartest guy around. I need, I need, I don't want to do stuff alone. Safety animal to the counselors, two or three is a good start. My opinion, you in our 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, like kind of the the. Kind of evolution of man, or however you want to say, this sort of the trajectory of us as humans. We kind of, like, end up owning more and more things as we get older. And like, to me, you're an owner, like, I know this is inevitable. You know this is inevitable. I'm going to bridge back. I'm going to bridge back to this company, right? But like you, I thought you would okay. Let me just say it this way, because this is the best way I know how right now, like, if you would be on my owners, like, as an owner with me here, or leadership level, executive team, whatever, and help me, like, flush out this crazy, unorganized mess that'd be, Oh, good grief. I'm, I'm just like, I want to throw up sometimes, because I just, it's just lack of organization, and you have the tools and the skills. Good grief, yeah. Anyway, I'm trying to get out of the bunny trail of this company for that, for this conversation, but don't do you have? How do I say this, I'm not trying to impose anything on you. Do you have? Well, a question would be like, Do you not have a desire to be like? Have stock equity in companies where you would bring that, you would bring some of that organizational oversight and nuts and bolts and, yeah, help set up systems and delegate, and then get that one right, and then go to another one and do, like, I don't know, and then keep some equity. Keep something isn't that you?

Matthias Miller  42:02
Yeah, I think, I mean, I think I would enjoy that. I don't know what keeps me from pushing for that,

Speaker 1  42:12
yeah, yeah. Well, okay, so the question, I'm just Yeah, sake of time or whatever, but I do. I mean, I love, I love this conversation. I don't, yeah, I don't know. I've really, I don't know. There's been a few people on my journey that usually always keep me like, help me to remember that it's possible and it's going to be okay, and we're going to get the job done. And like right now, on this stretch of my pathway with this organization, you're one of those individuals, one of maybe less than a handful. Um, I, um. Yeah, like, oh, man, I'm trying to quantify, like, what would be the value of you coming here? And I know you have family things going on there, and all of that connections, and that's not simple and all that, but what would be the value of you coming here for enough of days or weeks, whatever to get this thing flying? And I'm in the I'm I'm also at the point of closer and closer where, like, potentially, like, switching up some, some seats, type of responsibilities, at least, like, type of stuff, like, I'm right, I'm right there. I'm like,

Unknown Speaker  43:58
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not trying.

Matthias Miller  44:05
Maybe we need to revisit it, and maybe we need to frame those number of days in the right way. If those number of days are okay, here's something I've done, something that I've I've had great success with other companies has been going in for a number of days and literally asking 1000 questions of key players everywhere. And taking that, taking that and that surfaces all kinds of problems, because nobody, nobody has the big picture, but the guys in the shop know there's this frustrating thing that keeps going on forever, because who knows why it just does, because it's the way it's always been and and whoever's in charge, it gets lost somewhere. Whatever you do that, you dive. Deep and then where I failed with people historically. I mean, like one company straight up, they just don't have cash. Another company, I just need to be better at putting myself in there and selling the roadmap. But in my mind, that just becomes the roadmap. Like, just chip away. What is the next big thing? Let's go get that thing done, Delegate own the project, hold people accountable, solve roadblocks, and until you actually get that thing done, you rinse and repeat. You if you have conversations like that, you will, you will easily surface six to 12 months of work of things that are glaringly obvious in the company that need to be cleaned up.

Speaker 1  45:44
Well, we're working in that direction here. I mean, I'm not, I hope I'm not being saying this wrong, but I have a really good I mean, I've been all around this company. I can't, I can't spit spit out everything in one sitting, but I have a really good handle, I feel like, on what the priorities are and they need to be, and how and what all needs to tie it out with this programming. And I like it needs to be set up in a practical way. And then people, somebody in each they got to figure out who does what, but like how operator errors can only go on for so long, and you got to do something different. So, like, you know what I mean? Like, it stinks when it's like, oh, maybe it's something that Matt needs to fix or, Oh, maybe it's not like this, back and forth for weeks and weeks. Um, it's not an accurate reflection on your, on your on what you've done. I don't think, I don't feel that way at all, because there's a lot of stuff on our part where it's just the learning pains and the growing and all the different like, gosh, man, you know, you did have a good point to one day. I because you said, if you were to come here for like, couple days straight, what was the what was the greatest drawback that you mentioned?

Matthias Miller  47:37
Well, I think the biggest drawback is that, I think this is what I said, is that we find one or two glaring issues, yeah, and we can't, like, we can't move past them, like we have to get those resolved before we can make more meaningful progress.

Matthias Miller  47:57
I mean, there's, I don't know at what point this needs to happen. I mean, like, some of this stuff is also just because we're running lean. Like I rolled out an update. I broke part of the update. If you go back in your work order, it's updated now, if you go back in the latest work order, and they're now sorted by date and the nine for the 80298, sales orders in the list, and you can select it and tie it out, and we're all good. So error on my part, we're not doing doing enterprise level testing on these things. So things do slip, slip through like that, yeah, but we can get them fixed and turn around. So yep. Anyway, I don't know. I appreciate the feedback noted.

Unknown Speaker  48:44
Well, yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:46
I think what you're saying, though, if I could, if I could throw this last thing in, is that I would be the perfect sidekick for a guy who wants to do turnarounds.

Speaker 1  48:59
That's me, man. Yeah, like that. That's at least right here, right now, right here, right now. And, yeah, I felt the same way in Colorado. Like, you know, all the I'm a visionary, and I go, I just, I've always had a lot of ideas. I have ideas for Latte Love, like, let's skill that. Let's do roast our own beans. Let's move the let's make a sit in area and change the drive through to drive through, and move the walk up window to the next door building, and then create a nice outside space. And like, let's scale the let's patent our syrups and skill, the skill a thing, and do franchises and make it like Chick fil A and just like, that's all set up, that's all, like, upfront work, like I have, like, gosh, prison Anyway, whatever. Like all these, and I know they're not terrible ideas. I know they're not bad goals. I feel like they're kingdom. Um, like, for the I want to build a kingdom in in this way, because work is important. We all need work, man, and it needs to be healthy, and we need to have be having some fun out there. But, um, I guess I just happened, like my wife has kind of Latte Love. That was the thing she was involved with before I got to know her. And this business was started by my grandpa. Prisons been around forever. I don't know I have a construction background, so projects I love, projects like I like the, I don't know the whatever, just the planning and the brainstorming and delegation and like, some of those things. And then figured, like, I don't want to be the guy that's doing the same thing every day for five years, 10 years, whatever. I want to do stuff. Yeah, I want to empower people. Draw people. I want to, I want to draw people up like, see, see talent. The business owner is telling me two days ago, the other night, he's just like, anymore. He's like, when I hire I don't even, I don't even go for skills. He said, I just, I try to hire the right people, the right person, character stuff, and I know they're going to be a good fit in my company. And some of that skill stuff is just taught now. I have to get better at that. But anyway, sorry, uh, you, did you say 130 Matt was like a cut off.

Matthias Miller  51:39
I have the the calendars do that. I've got another I've got a two o'clock so, but I can go for another 1015, minutes. Go pull up the assembly tracker. Pull up the top work order. If you want to drive John crazy, tell him you just went in and selected just the the Yeah, go, go find the iron shot if you want to drive him, you know, driving crazy, tell him you just don't tell him. I didn't update. Just tell him you went in and you just selected the sales orders work right. Yep, top one, right there. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  52:22
Uh. Scroll down

Matthias Miller  52:26
sage, and then there's a nine drop the sage order ID right here open, yep,

Unknown Speaker  52:34
and not sure which one it's supposed to be.

Unknown Speaker  52:42
It's gotta be the 80298. It's the only one is 813, is not tied out yet.

Matthias Miller  52:53
These are, this is showing the full that one actually is tied out. The drop down is showing the full list because of date?

Unknown Speaker  53:04
How do I know if they're tied

Matthias Miller  53:05
out or not? That's a great question. Go down to nine. Oh, the 904, sorry, not the date order anymore, though. That is bizarre. It's due date. No, this is order. I'm confused. Try that. No, 911 try the 911 that's what

Unknown Speaker  53:25
it dropped to the bottom when I when I selected it, you

Matthias Miller  53:28
selected it. That one says it needs 10. Um,

Unknown Speaker  53:34
let's try this.

Matthias Miller  53:36
If you blink out the quantity and put 20 back in there. What is it? What does it pull up?

Unknown Speaker  53:44
Oh, 20.

Matthias Miller  53:54
It doesn't, it doesn't autofill. No, okay, maybe I misread, maybe a bit higher. So it says 80298, it says it has

Speaker 1  54:11
80298, that needs 20.

Matthias Miller  54:15
Oh, there you go. Never mind. That is right. So that would be the right one. I mean, presumably that is the right one.

Speaker 1  54:20
What does this other guy say, for 911 why does it say, well, it is only 10. That must be the order, you know. I mean, for 911 it must be 10. Yep, again, I guess. Anyway, hopefully that's what it is. Seems like we and then I link this to down here, right?

Matthias Miller  54:39
It already is linked. It is linked, yep, just hit save,

Unknown Speaker  54:44
okay, what's 9.17

Matthias Miller  54:47
that is a total hours from

Speaker 1  54:49
Okay, that one I don't need to hit link.

Matthias Miller  54:53
No, the link is to view. Is the link

Speaker 1  54:56
to view? It to that work order? Yeah. Uh, if

Matthias Miller  55:01
you want to jump back and forth between

Speaker 1  55:02
automatically linked like, okay, no,

Matthias Miller  55:06
somehow, I don't know how he did it. Somehow, John linked complete sales orders together. And I'm not quite sure how he did it.

Speaker 1  55:19
Well, remember, I came in here and deleted the quantity.

Matthias Miller  55:22
You deleted the quantity. But he, yeah, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  55:28
okay,

Matthias Miller  55:30
but if you go back to your other screen and save it,

Speaker 1  55:34
oh, shoot, I don't Did you?

Matthias Miller  55:40
No, no. Hit the hit the it's the tab open to the left of this one

Unknown Speaker  55:46
tab

Matthias Miller  55:48
on your browser.

Unknown Speaker  55:51
Tab

Matthias Miller  55:53
go up to now. What I mean is click on the there's a go all the way to the top of your browser screen. It has a little shows you what page you're up a little bit further all these different pages you have open. So go. It's, it's like,

Speaker 1  56:15
there you go. I gotcha see this one. Save that. Yep, save it, we're good. Now, if I go to

Unknown Speaker  56:28
now, it should be gone from your warnings.

Unknown Speaker  56:32
What's that?

Matthias Miller  56:35
Now? It should be that should be cleared up.

Speaker 1  56:41
Are there any Oh, warnings, I should look at that. Oh, shoot your session. Okay, it's fine. Uh, warnings. Fab. Rule time at, yeah, it's not there. So we're good. Um, the other one he had was burger. And see here,

Speaker 1  57:14
this guy, oh, down here, Matt, I have open order for Yeah, uh, open order, 818, 711, 623, um, this guy right here, 12918, um, um is saying quantity order. 184, he entered the 58 that were assembled on probably Wednesday, the third, yep, nine, three. These guys worked until 430 and they did 58 and so the balance of the 184 should be 126 he's trying to enter 126 for the next day. But the quantity needed is, I don't know. I'm guessing Well,

Matthias Miller  58:17
well, that means we have, okay, go back. Let's get the sales order number for this one.

Unknown Speaker  58:25
Yeah, it's 80294,

Matthias Miller  58:28
then go back. I wrote that down

Speaker 1  58:30
here somewhere. Yeah, I got that. Okay, 126,

Matthias Miller  58:42
127, okay, so if you go up to the assembly tracker, hit the drop down, punch in the so number as well. Oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  58:54
Perfect. 80294.

Matthias Miller  59:00
Yeah. Okay, so you assemble 127 plus 58 which comes out to,

Speaker 1  59:07
well, here's the problem. Need to use the wrong order on this one.

Matthias Miller  59:12
Well, right? I mean, principally, seems like it, yeah. But this is split between two orders, which is really weird, which probably means he's got another one on 802, 92 that's the wrong order as well.

Speaker 1  59:30
I mean, I was sure that's what it was going on, but I don't know

Unknown Speaker  59:34
it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  59:43
well, that's where I'm yeah, what?

Matthias Miller  59:51
I mean, I shouldn't laugh. I mean, this is exactly the issue we ran into with the spreadsheet. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  59:58
right? I.

Matthias Miller  1:00:00
Accuracy is not high on the list of patterns, I should say.

Speaker 1  1:00:13
So it needs to when you go back through and connect it to the right, you

Matthias Miller  1:00:20
got to trace the burger all the way back to when, when it went off course, and figure out when to go sideways.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:27
If I go, if I if I do this, what do we say? Well, let's do this.

Speaker 2  1:00:42
Yep. And

Speaker 1  1:00:51
I'm like, again, I'm down here. I'm looking at now is everything in here from January one or not. Down here, this

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
one doesn't this one doesn't show since January one. I've got another version that does for cleanup purposes. We can,

Speaker 1  1:01:13
well, that's fine. MATT Like, what is? What does this go back to

Matthias Miller  1:01:17
six, June 23, due date or something like that.

Speaker 1  1:01:22
Well, this up here does goes to Yes. Okay, start at the top. Here we like, what's what's shoot? What am I doing here? This isn't hard. What's disturbing is, like, I've got 818, order. I Miller, 241, assembled, 15 assembled 140, like 49 here, this is all since this is all the stuff that needs cleaned up, right? Yeah. So, how do I go? How would you do this? Working backwards?

Matthias Miller  1:02:05
Well, I would, I don't know how I would do it for sure. I might start with, like, if you scroll up, I'm going to assume that this that 79676, is just prior to

Speaker 1  1:02:16
that's a different number order there. That's a different what.

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
Yeah, you're right. I would probably, I mean, probably just start going through these so numbers and find out either, either search by these so numbers or just go, go back, go back to the earliest ones he entered, and start double checking all the so numbers on the, on the on the on the burger work orders, the earliest ones he

Speaker 1  1:02:54
entered. You mean since, since the 23rd Yeah, which is like here,

Matthias Miller  1:02:59
yeah, start here. Well, this one here, June 23 came, actually came in from the it looks to me like it came in from the Excel spreadsheet. But like the, but if you go up like the June, you know, June

Speaker 1  1:03:17
here, here. Look at this. Look at this. They did seven to 430, they

Matthias Miller  1:03:27
did this. This is where, okay, the the pluses here. This is where I merged multiple days together. So I had four day, three days, 172 22 and 184 and I linked them all out for total, 378, this is part of the automatic ranking,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:45
and they're all coming off of this order,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:51
correct. Wait, did I do that?

Matthias Miller  1:03:54
111, I mean, that might be a me problem. I thought it was cross checking the I

Speaker 1  1:04:16
Matt, I got, I'm gonna run to the k, oh, go ahead. I got P, I'll be right back. Where do you need me?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
Ah, drop soon.

Matthias Miller  1:04:25
But let's Yeah, what's that? So I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to drop it a few actually, I'll take a break too. See, in a minute,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
okay? One minute. Yep, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
Hey, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:06:08
all right. So this was the case where he and I crossed paths a little bit. He had tied it out to a sales order, and then I had merged it because this was this had been imported. So I'm going to go see basically what needs to I want to See how, what other places we crossed over. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:01
you a bummer. All right, here's what needs to happen.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:17
Great. Now and

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
it's only if, here I'm

Speaker 2  1:07:52
okay, there we go. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:04
these are going to need To clean up. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
Miller to 378,

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
I mean a good one here. He and I crossed paths. I was cleaning up. I was I was doing automatic linking out to order, and he had tied it out to sales order or I. Was linking, I was linking sales orders together, if they're back to back days, like we had discussed. He already had linked this one out to a sales order and so

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
that the sales order.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
Um, what's that? Matt, what'd you say broke up.

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
You refresh the screen, you can see my changes. Let's do that. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
Okay, the links here, is that accurate? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:10:46
I don't know if that's accurate. These are just, I added automation that that takes back to back sales orders, or, for historical purposes, goes back to back and links back to back sales orders together. Because these were, these were subsequent weekdays, like we talked about,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
yeah, and so,

Matthias Miller  1:11:06
quite possible that the 172 and the 22 should be tied out the, you know, there's specific work orders for those as well.

Speaker 1  1:11:15
Well, I think we're on where I'm concerned. A little bit is in realize what time it is, 158, here. Let's

Speaker 1  1:11:29
see, bam, bam. It's the well, it's no, it's here. It's here. Three here. Did that change at all? Like, there's still these open these quantity discrepancies, right? Here is what

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
completely and that's again, I think, yeah, go ahead. I think what I would just do is just go back through the work orders, fix up the link them out to the right sales orders, and then let's go from there like we know that's wrong. We know it's wrong right now,

Speaker 1  1:12:04
right take these one at a time. If I open this up

Matthias Miller  1:12:13
sales order number and you can find that, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:18
So if I start it right here that's connected to each of these guys for whatever reason,

Matthias Miller  1:12:31
for whatever reason.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:35
I gotta drop. Okay, Matt, um,

Matthias Miller  1:12:38
do you want to text me if you want to,

Speaker 1  1:12:42
well, what do you I mean, I'm okay with, I mean, we're making progress, right? I I'm bullish on that, right?

Matthias Miller  1:12:52
But then, but then, I think we're ready to start digging into what is, what does it take to clean up those 4000 old orders?

Speaker 1  1:12:58
So we gotta, yeah, yeah, let me know

Matthias Miller  1:13:02
when you want to. Can you can you just text me some availability?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
Yeah, how much time do you want to spend? Do you have a couple hours sometime?

Matthias Miller  1:13:17
Yeah, Tuesday, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:13:18
know if we need it for Tuesday, when afternoon, evening. What?

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
1212, 30 to 230

Unknown Speaker  1:13:28
Yeah, Eastern or your time. Eastern time or your time.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
Sorry, can't hear you. Eastern, okay, all right, sounds good, whatever.

Speaker 1  1:13:45
Thanks. Man, Matt, thank you. Man, appreciate you. Hey, likewise. Pray about this. I don't know. Could could you see it at all happening? You spend some time here.

Matthias Miller  1:13:59
I have probably more thoughts, but yes, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
Yeah, see ya. See.
