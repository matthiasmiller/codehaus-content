All right. So here's the idea. Have a Zapier integration that ties into a whiskey and basically you have a few things like some triggers to get a list of fields and levels and maybe even levels by field. And then you have

Unknown Speaker  00:24
a The update has a like it prompts for a match subset. It prompts for prompts for the subset and it prompts for

Speaker 1  00:50
a key field so that you can identify what the key field is in case is imagine update. And then and I guess it It assumed it's not atomic now. I don't know how I feel about that thing. It's actually unfortunate if it's not atomic, we could say that you will actually would be better to put that into the ZAP so that people know it's not atomic. Now in the case of calendar events, what I I would have to see what the unique ID is and how that gets formulated and how that needs to work here. Now the other option would be to have the actually like this better. What if we had a way to? Maybe this wouldn't actually require any kind of special handling. If we had an X 30 for this app. Then I'm trying to think yeah, then you don't have to format the input Jason. Beyond some very basics, I think. And then you you'd specify the everything in the Ask prompts. And then the x 30 can handle it all. atomically I actually like that idea. I think that can actually be built out with very little additional development required

Speaker 1  02:33
because you don't actually want update record logic is too complex and too low level for that. I really think that's the way we should go. I think the next step for me is to dig in some time. So I guess what do I need? I need to know what information is coming from this app, what information I actually want in the in the event and to have extra a and have somebody create the x 30 for me. And then, and then I can actually try tying, tying things together.
