Unknown Speaker  00:17
Sir. So

Unknown Speaker  00:29
you're at the poor house, aren't you?

Speaker 1  00:37
Alright, so if I read your success but open the expression about your here. And

Unknown Speaker  00:48
where did you open? How did where did you do that?

Speaker 1  00:51
Well, you can do this. You can hit Ctrl semicolon X.

Speaker 2  00:56
But I mean, we're, we're How are you getting? How are you getting that subset that drop in there like that?

Unknown Speaker  01:01
Just copied it from?

Speaker 2  01:03
Ah, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, then

Speaker 1  01:07
if I build a sales order attached to the sales orders not attached to building, so.

Speaker 2  01:15
So I think I think this is where we were refining for the dealer being a dealer that we deliver. No, it's not. Where do we refine for dealing buildings for?

Unknown Speaker  01:35
Dealer the idea?

Speaker 2  01:40
Is it in the main subset? That would seem awfully funny that if we weren't doing that in the main subset?

Speaker 1  01:53
mean, you're gonna have days off and stuff that aren't tied to it? To deal at all? Well,

Speaker 2  01:58
exactly, it well, and I really want days off to be not too tied to anything. No dealer, like, no stun No, Sid.

Unknown Speaker  02:09
So I don't know what you're after here.

Speaker 2  02:13
So this one, this this day off, I think it's one of the ones I sent it down, they were trying to get this thing to show up. So they went and attached a sales order to it.

Speaker 1  02:24
So whilst so than this one, you should just detach the cylinder, but you still have the problem with sales orders that don't have a building attached to it. So

Speaker 2  02:35
so is the stuff that I dropped in. So there isn't a transit station or transit building field is district x and the same thing down below in transit stun and building transit field at a building build date that stuff.

Speaker 1  02:51
This is everything's fine, except your check checking if your sales order this will fail if you have a sales order that doesn't have a building.

Speaker 2  02:57
Got it? Oh, ah. So if you have a sales order that doesn't have a building attached.

Speaker 1  03:06
Got you. So either changes to transit, Stan, or change this to what's something about the sales order? And what you're after that?

Speaker 2  03:14
I don't know what I'm after they're either dealer in network. I understand the dealer and network part, but I don't understand why we're looking at it from a building side. That's counterintuitive.

Speaker 1  03:25
I mean, it seems like what you want is a transit. So field. So dealer,

Speaker 2  03:37
dealer network. Yeah, that should that should that should be it. Now she's not evaluates true. All right. I think I gotta think about that wind. I don't understand why we're evaluating the sales order for something that's on a building. No, no. Okay. Well, no, that should fix it. If that if that resolves my issues, then. Yeah, I'll push I'll push this logic to Nick then to refine the scheduling subset. Sweet.

Speaker 2  04:22
Yes, I just want to make sure I understood that whole expression evaluator. So you open whatever record you're trying to get to show up, you copy the subset from the report, open up the record, go the expression evaluator and evaluate until you figure it out. Why it's it's got it. That makes a ton more sense. Okay. That makes Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Perfect. Thank you very much.
