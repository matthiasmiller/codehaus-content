Unknown Speaker  00:41
Morning Good Morning

Unknown Speaker  00:44
Good Morning

Unknown Speaker  01:19
testing

Unknown Speaker  01:20
Hey

Matthias Miller  01:21
Hey Joel aim

Unknown Speaker  01:28
turns out sound works better when the headsets on

Matthias Miller  01:32
difference

Matthias Miller  01:44
good well I don't have any profound ways to start off this meeting besides the fact that Mark probably are tired of my voice already so anything before we dive in

Unknown Speaker  02:07
not here no

Speaker 1  02:09
one inspiration we the list I had to send today was rather short so I think that's a good sign like we don't have this laundry list of things that need done urgently so that's that's awesome. Yeah, that's great.

Speaker 2  02:33
Okay, well I can just jump in and go down the list. We've got a few new things other than that we're just I think doing is it done in priority so handling historical reconciled transactions for Matthias

Matthias Miller  02:45
I got sucked off in other projects no change. Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 2  02:50
About the add view view checks link to vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  02:55
let me see if it says

Speaker 2  02:57
it was live it was a link not a bug. And Jonathan was fixing it

Matthias Miller  03:04
should be fixed and guessing.

Speaker 3  03:07
Let me go find out. Still a button probably hasn't been updated since then.

Unknown Speaker  03:15
Okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  03:19
I know that's weird, huh? No, something's wrong. It was updated on the 11th you

Speaker 3  03:25
to fix it before that let me I need to follow up with that

Unknown Speaker  03:36
okay

Unknown Speaker  03:45
okay, oh

Matthias Miller  03:48
nevermind he got derailed John, Joel, Jonathan was having trouble with his local copy crashing constantly.

Unknown Speaker  03:59
Can

Matthias Miller  04:00
I have him touch base with you if you still need something?

Speaker 4  04:05
Sure. Although I wonder if I had one issue with that that has been fixed I mean, but that was several weeks ago. So maybe it's different issue but yeah, all right. Well, I'm

Unknown Speaker  04:19
gonna try again

Speaker 2  04:26
Okay, sounds good. I think this next one for Joel the add column for the general ledger account and see if any speed also hold on just second. Is this the same thing speed up general ledger and transaction report. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  04:43
that's the one I was thinking of.

Speaker 2  04:45
This is the official one. So Okay. This one

Unknown Speaker  04:52
and that one no progress but can it is is on my radar and let me double up on

Unknown Speaker  05:14
sounds good?

Unknown Speaker  05:18
Where are we keeping in to speed

Speaker 2  05:21
as the Gold Age towards the top there?

Speaker 4  05:25
Can you put it out one week from today? And I'm I mean just

Unknown Speaker  05:41
reflecting what we're trying to accomplish rather than historical sins

Speaker 2  05:51
I will move into one. Okay, and then we will not have the duplicates. Okay, sounds good. So we're out a week from today on that one. For drew we have allowed deactivating right off reasons

Unknown Speaker  06:09
don't remember the

Speaker 2  06:14
this was the whole conversation. Boy Drew, you said we should look at this and test it before closing. You think

Speaker 2  06:30
huh, Matthias, Matthias was going to make a quick report and send it to Drew

Speaker 5  06:35
Yes, yeah, I have that report. Um, we were wanting to the issue was that if we deactivated something it would it would mess up all the ones that use that reason that right.

Matthias Miller  06:59
It would. No, those should be fine. Anything historical will be fine. It just makes it it should just make it not be visible in the list.

Speaker 5  07:07
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So it's not like I have to change the stuff on that report. So I know where they are. Yeah.

Speaker 1  07:20
What was that the reason for the report so that you could see the frequency of how often they've been used?

Speaker 5  07:27
Yeah, there's like 10 or so that use that premium one that's got issues. I haven't done anything with them. But But yeah, I was looking at it and like, do I need to change all of these first before we disconnected are so historic little bit fun while you're saying? Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 2  07:52
so does that mean we can close this out? Or do you want to keep it?

Unknown Speaker  07:56
I would say you can close it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  08:09
Okay, Joel, we had the Add cash flow statement.

Speaker 4  08:11
Again, one week, please. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
Yeah, excellent process. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:27
Okay, I'll switch it to May 23. vendor credit memos for Matthias.

Matthias Miller  08:34
We're gonna conversation this morning. And this can go out about probably two weeks from today. At a minimum for my part.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 2  08:51
How about the friendly way to lock historical transactions for in accounting impact?

Matthias Miller  09:01
Did we end up reviewing this page? I was happy with the design or do we need to still take a look at this. It's been too long since we talked.

Speaker 1  09:10
I can't remember that. We didn't review it. But

Speaker 1  09:18
I feel like this was something that we could put or should push out. Probably beyond credits and refunds just I mean, we talked with with Larry about it. And he said, You know, that's just the reality of when it was all paper. You know, you're literally had you closed. He said now if you look at things year to date. Now there's logical changes that it will continue to change slightly as you go through the year and so it's Don't get hung up with closing out a month. I mean,

Speaker 5  10:09
yeah, what he did say we could look at is making sure that we're not like, they don't have the ability to write backdate checks or, like silly things that shouldn't be happening as far as just like the system, make sure the system can't do something to get dates way off, you know, like over the end of the year, if you happen to put 23 in instead of 24. It should be way too far out of range. And it should tell you just some things like that, which I think there are some of that stuff built in already. So

Matthias Miller  10:51
I mean, some of it ends up showing up eventually. Yeah, somehow, but I'm not aware of any specific warnings like if you enter in a transaction more than three months out of range, or, you know,

Speaker 5  11:06
that's probably some of the things that we should look at when we look at that. Just looking at throwing ends and things in the system that makes at least errors don't happen. As like,

Speaker 1  11:18
sure errors is not not allowing backdating which I think we covered most of these already like that allow backdating of invoices and it checks Beyond Today. Right.

Speaker 5  11:34
He there was something about sales orders. I think the invoicing was up today but the checks would not because somebody could have written out and check. Like but invoicing would have been like it for sure shouldn't be able to go into the prior period where you've you know say prior month where you've paid sales tax like so invoicing backdating sure that

Matthias Miller  12:01
sales sales orders to sell sales orders back dated before today. Although payments would I mean there's any number of dates I feel like this is one of those things that looks simple and there's gonna be a few details. I mean, vendor invoices you need to and vendor invoices, just backdate up to the prior period or up to the prayer reconcile?

Speaker 1  12:25
Well right now vendor invoices can be backdated to I think they can be back dated to it okay, if they're attached to a purchase order they can. They cannot be backdated prior to receipt date of product or services like the date

Matthias Miller  12:57
What if we do this? Restrict back I'm going to create a new incident restrict backdating of sales orders vendor invoices and checks. Well checks and deposits. And then let's need to discuss details. So this one here goes out. Big beginning of July. Yeah. And then what priority Do you want the backdating restriction

Speaker 1  13:34
well in relative to other projects or

Speaker 6  13:37
or what? Yes. Well,

Speaker 1  13:42
I think it's it should come after credits, refunds and sales tax improvements. I forget what we call it on our 24 development priorities list that those for sure those three should come before

Matthias Miller  14:01
that. Okay, so this this one really is

Unknown Speaker  14:07
more like August

Speaker 1  14:08
would you disagree too? I mean, we've been running with with what we have now for four and a half months and no nothing has gone sideways because of it. I mean, it might have saved you.

Speaker 5  14:29
Yeah, I mean, it's there's not been huge issues at all.

Unknown Speaker  14:34
August September

Unknown Speaker  14:38
and we're not closing the year for taxes. Right

Speaker 2  14:51
so if you're creating a new incident, what are we doing with this incident?

Matthias Miller  14:57
Well, so do you want to do anything besides restrict Going, when are you fine? Do we need to handle closed periods at all? Well, it's just one of those things where q4, we're going to suddenly start getting worried.

Speaker 5  15:11
Yeah, there's, there's an element that he talked about as well, that I think would be good is basically it closes for certain user levels. So, so we come to the end of 24. And, you know, we go into January about two, three weeks, and then we close it for we close 23 Or we close 24 For like, regular data entry. But it still stays open for making all of your adjusting entries and all of that. So he called it a soft, close, but where, because at that point, we don't want them making any backdated entries at all.

Matthias Miller  16:00
So I understand we have six to seven months before we literally have a gun to our heads, and we need to have this done. But I'm also well I'm nervous. Wow. Before we have the figurative gun to our head, but with real threat, yeah. Work on my language here. I am slightly nervous about I'll just when you bump it out to August and September, let's just huh. We're going to feel the pain in December. Let's make sure we address it before we start feeling the pain or we're all going to be I would like to avoid as much of the 23 Crunch December as we can.

Unknown Speaker  16:50
Mark

Matthias Miller  16:52
Good. Glad we're on the same page.

Speaker 1  16:57
Not bump it out again once we get to August September.

Speaker 2  17:04
So for the sake of clarity on this one on incident 90 to 60 and my bumping this to say August 1 along with the new one you're creating or Are we closing this? What's happening with this?

Unknown Speaker  17:15
Well

Matthias Miller  17:18
bump it bump it up to September open both out to September. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:24
I think and then we'll just okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:36
That's not you.

Speaker 2  17:39
Okay. Sounds good. Okay, the next year we have we covered with Joel, that one is a duplicate. The next one from Matthias is fees slash premiums with write offs.

Matthias Miller  17:52
My understanding is this still requires this is a design or feedback from you guys. I don't think we ever really nailed it down.

Speaker 3  17:58
So this is a question of priority on y'all stand. Well,

Speaker 1  18:03
I think this is going to tie in with the refunds discussion.

Matthias Miller  18:08
Okay. So that bumps it out to mid?

Unknown Speaker  18:13
I don't know mid June

Unknown Speaker  18:18
June 13.

Unknown Speaker  18:19
June 3 13. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  18:26
How about validate against unlinked ledger accounts for vendor invoices. aromatize.

Matthias Miller  18:44
Do you want people to do you want to keep people from creating vendor invoices for GL accounts that aren't properly configured in accounting? And how much of a priority is it?

Unknown Speaker  19:02
Currently, how

Unknown Speaker  19:02
do how do you find out about? Like, how do they show up now?

Matthias Miller  19:10
Drew's wreck I think drew you reconcile and you find something missing?

Speaker 5  19:15
Yeah, that's correct. But that doesn't necessarily mean that I then realized that it's because an account is disconnected. It's just it's missing. So I just assumed that it never wasn't.

Matthias Miller  19:30
Well, fair. And we've got so we do have error reports. Somewhere we have a job written up to send you error reports job or email. I don't know where it is.

Speaker 2  19:42
Yeah, that's right. daily email. Yeah. Let me see if this got down into is it one of these new four tasks or invoice or in? Well,

Matthias Miller  19:57
if there was a comment on that job? Maybe that was the Answer to the job we have probably is what that task is for is just doing the email

Speaker 2  20:05
yeah we what we landed on okay so there needs to be an action item here to actually set that email up

Unknown Speaker  20:18
yes

Unknown Speaker  20:27
we keep the date where it's at

Matthias Miller  20:35
reducing

Speaker 1  20:37
Good to hear Yeah, I mean if it sounds good

Unknown Speaker  20:42
besides changes for labor intensive buildings

Matthias Miller  20:48
I mean no change here. Marcus is still an appropriate priority

Unknown Speaker  20:54
okay, what was the

Matthias Miller  20:58
labor intensive effective date and then don't recalculate if labor intensive effective date and amount were specified before billed?

Unknown Speaker  21:09
Well if they're specified yeah

Speaker 1  21:14
okay, I'm trying to remember what to set to build and build date of labor tend to specify

Matthias Miller  21:22
this has something to do I think with on site buildings that you can you add a labor intensive effective date and have it affect the production pool during the week that the onset was built even if built even if it wasn't entered until next week or something like that? Is that sound ringabel

Unknown Speaker  21:47
No, it

Speaker 1  21:50
got blank but it sounds like something we should look at but not too early tonight. I'd say can we bump it till August 1

Speaker 2  22:07
Yep, sounds good. Okay. With is take write offs from source bank account doesn't

Matthias Miller  22:18
I mean this is contingent on the refund and other write off discussion isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  22:28
I think so. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:30
This is also June 13

Speaker 2  22:45
Okay, um income statement for pole barn revenue cogs

Unknown Speaker  22:58
let's see we had Chronos

Matthias Miller  22:59
take priority so okay, I'm gonna guess refunds do as well So Mark, is this in August September, October

Speaker 1  23:13
I would should should we change this to to my my court and maybe leave the leave the date for right now and leave it as the like there's leave it here because of the manual process we want to start doing

Unknown Speaker  23:34
Sure.

Speaker 1  23:37
Okay. I think be good to just keep it there for a minute

Unknown Speaker  23:40
Okay sounds good.

Speaker 2  23:46
Let's see investigate or create the process for moving payments from one sales order to another a coffee investigate at this point.

Unknown Speaker  23:57
This is one of those things that

Matthias Miller  24:01
I think is I wonder if we can my My thing is my schedule is looking pretty famous last words pretty light so this this in some ways would be nicer to have this further up the list and keep it on my radar as a as a filler if if it actually ends up being that way but

Unknown Speaker  24:30
yeah, that's fair.

Unknown Speaker  24:36
Where would you like to move it?

Matthias Miller  24:39
Just like maybe June 1. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  24:45
How about allowing company specific signature adjustments actually

Matthias Miller  25:00
nevermind, let's kill the June 1. Let's leave June 1 is the pillar stuff at least for my stuff, I'm ending banking credit card balances is about right. You guys want to move

Unknown Speaker  25:19
What's the date on July 1?

Unknown Speaker  25:22
Diversity?

Speaker 5  25:23
We could leave it there for now. I don't think we'll get to it by then. But and it doesn't need to be here. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  25:35
Can we move that into Drew's court? Because it's really is this one it's not clear. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  25:42
Exactly what we need

Speaker 1  25:46
if we go back if you did you change, also change that whole Barnes. thing to my court if you haven't. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  25:54
no, I missed that. Thank you. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  25:58
Perfect. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  26:09
Well, okay, Did we skip company specific signature adjustments, or did we just not need to change anything on that? Just

Matthias Miller  26:16
leave it there. Okay, that's far enough out and

Unknown Speaker  26:19
it's filler support

Speaker 2  26:21
for importing transaction line items that is in Drew's court where we clarifying the benefits of it

Unknown Speaker  26:34
check numbers in the right place. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  26:36
this is payroll right

Speaker 1  26:45
Oh, I think that wasn't true in my court too.

Speaker 5  26:52
Figure out how to just kind of work with it for now. Wasn't that kind of the conclusion? Yeah. Rather than get it in the mess of stuff that's a lot more important. Simply

Speaker 1  27:03
just close it out here and we bring it up when we Yeah,

Speaker 5  27:06
like next March or April or so please.

Matthias Miller  27:12
Okay, so yeah, I think I think on our end we said we said our stuff is done and so I'm going to close out the incident or on our end as well. Sounds good

Speaker 2  27:31
Okay, great. When you're done with that device, it's the streamlined vendor invoices needing payment

Matthias Miller  27:40
when isn't intuitive, what do we say?

Speaker 2  27:44
Yeah, Drew said he knows how to use it so we were pushing it to July requires

Matthias Miller  27:49
discussion so I think unless you guys know that you want to talk about it? I think it's doesn't this maybe you're missing some business in your court? Doesn't this record discussion with you guys to find out where we actually went?

Speaker 5  28:07
It could be now it I think I think we'll run into readjusting this whole situation a little bit with those credit memos and how that should all be done as well. You know that'll

Matthias Miller  28:21
can we there to do like he does around or just close it out and say

Speaker 5  28:32
how much how much work are you going to need as far as how to incorporate credit memos into that whole thing of paying invoices and what that looks like on that page? Like Do we need a discussion session for that?

Matthias Miller  28:54
I mean, we might need at least a brief discussion on that yeah

Speaker 5  29:01
because we could we could maybe bring it into that and just look at what changes I'm gonna write to this page.

Unknown Speaker  29:10
I'm fine with that

Unknown Speaker  29:18
which that should then be what next?

Unknown Speaker  29:25
Yeah. Should we change the date on it to keep it

Unknown Speaker  29:29
in the ballpark says

Unknown Speaker  29:30
discussions?

Unknown Speaker  29:33
It couldn't be. Well,

Speaker 5  29:38
Matthias, are you going to be available the first week of June you just said not for early morning meeting or? Yes,

Matthias Miller  29:44
I'm available the first week of June I just will not. Not Not before saying o'clock Mountain Time.

Unknown Speaker  29:58
was the third gain, or do we need to do?

Speaker 5  30:03
Well, I just do we want it before that catch up on where that program is going or is that not going to even be helpful? Just put it on the 13

Speaker 1  30:17
Thirteen's? Yeah, I just put it on the 13th

Speaker 2  30:22
on the 13th Sounds good. Um, let's see, Drew, are we still working on? Can bank two sheets integrate with all banks?

Unknown Speaker  30:32
Um, we're not working on it.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
Okay. Like?

Unknown Speaker  30:39
Yeah, I mean, in a way, you might as well just take it even off.

Unknown Speaker  30:44
You just say take it off. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:46
we're all about reflecting reality stuff. Okay.

Speaker 2  30:55
You put it in the not to do pile. I have one of those. Not to do. Fantastic. All right. Matthias sales order accessory to general ledger accounts.

Matthias Miller  31:10
Can you pull up the comments? Yeah.

Speaker 2  31:18
Quick Fix not require review processor permissions are saying, Okay.

Matthias Miller  31:24
I mean, okay, I'm not sure why this isn't my my court, did we decide that we want to do this? I thought this was a or was this a? Is this a we don't know, if we want this business process? Or is it's a we know we want to and

Unknown Speaker  31:40
we should go do this

Unknown Speaker  31:48
well, wasn't

Unknown Speaker  31:49
this because of

Speaker 1  32:00
that you have some accounts that weren't in the right place?

Speaker 5  32:04
It was yeah, it was because these miscellaneous we I think it had to do with refunds or something we had to open it up to be able to write a line to do a refund or something.

Speaker 1  32:22
But this is this is just saying when you have accessory GL accounts on a sales order how do we how do we make sure they get posted to the right revenue?

Unknown Speaker  32:36
Yeah

Speaker 1  32:39
What does this have to do with refunds?

Unknown Speaker  32:52
So

Speaker 1  32:54
I think the initial thought on this was buildings go to buildings, delivery goes to deliver like that line item and then you know discounts go to discount. How do we handle where they freeform, you know, whether been or a, what have you? And to bring a little bit of structure to that I would own so what happens right now if no, there was discussion on we could continue letting them do free form and we could just create some mapping. Look at the most commonly used things that are entered map them to the correct account. But what are some

Unknown Speaker  33:55
right now?

Speaker 1  33:57
What happens currently, Dino Mathias, like an accessory GL account. What happens today? Do they do

Matthias Miller  34:06
buildings? In the main whatever the main income account is? I don't remember how much customization we have in the income account. Yeah,

Speaker 5  34:14
yeah, I remember what it was. We had building materials going to buildings. But that's okay.

Matthias Miller  34:23
But that's a different issue than this. That's that's a misconfiguration of your

Unknown Speaker  34:33
like we have

Unknown Speaker  34:36
here is it

Speaker 1  34:37
miscellaneous sales orders. Is it not? Maybe

Speaker 5  34:41
it was on miscellaneous sales orders going? It was? Yeah, it was miscellaneous sales orders. We're hitting, still hitting buildings. That's what

Speaker 1  34:50
it was. But wasn't it Okay, was that a software issue? Or was that because they weren't selecting an account

Speaker 5  35:00
No they would select account and account but it would override it it would override what they selected and it would always go to buildings because buildings was the main income account and so what usually Matthias is you you open it up so that it takes what they enter and then that review process is is what we just eliminated yeah that's what it was. It's all coming back now.

Speaker 1  35:29
Close it out because we don't we don't have a review process maybe in the future we want to bring it back but right now when we're scrutinizing that what do we call it that one report finished goods inventory by so yeah, we'll see so yeah, I didn't say what close it out. Okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  35:54
Remember all that processing to get to that point?

Speaker 2  36:00
Test in your memories there is change reconcile report to show all unreconciled transactions

Matthias Miller  36:09
This is either a close drusen close it we'll keep working it and see if he can refine what it's what he's looking for. So I would 9768 Can we just do that?

Unknown Speaker  36:26
Just close it

Matthias Miller  36:30
drew is that still how you feel about it?

Unknown Speaker  36:33
You mean just closing out? Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and pause

Unknown Speaker  36:40
okay

Unknown Speaker  36:46
Okay excellent.

Speaker 2  36:54
Let's see budget amount on parent account from an email. I can pull up an email if we need some background on this too. For the parent child account budgeting issue, let's circle back at the end of September so I guess maybe still at September we can leave it

Matthias Miller  37:10
that's still September. Yep. Fantastic.

Speaker 2  37:13
So we just have four new ones we've got the reconcile reconcile export takes too many pages 9904.

Unknown Speaker  37:34
This got

Matthias Miller  37:37
delayed because of a platform bug that kept Jonathan from doing things and I will bump the email and get him to

Unknown Speaker  37:47
try again.

Speaker 2  37:51
When do you want to put a date on this? Or when what date should we put on this?

Matthias Miller  37:55
He's out for a

Unknown Speaker  37:56
few weeks? June 1

Unknown Speaker  38:05
Okay, sounds

Speaker 2  38:06
good. How about the sales order credits and refund refunds 9907

Matthias Miller  38:16
So credits and refunds this one we have we're gonna change this one just to be no this is sales order credits and refunds. We're going to talk about it maybe as early as June 13. Okay

Unknown Speaker  38:42
put this in the June 30 date then

Unknown Speaker  38:46
this is what it's all hinging

Speaker 2  38:49
make sense? Quick vendor invoice entry.

Matthias Miller  38:56
This is from the from the transaction reconcile. Right. Joel Do you know offhand do we allow client specific buttons in reports

Unknown Speaker  39:15
we have columns see

Unknown Speaker  39:20
I don't know offhand.

Speaker 3  39:26
Let me see. We're not still using a custom reconcile report for zfp are we? I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  39:52
Although it's possible that we might actually move back in that direction for some other reasons which would

Unknown Speaker  40:01
resolve this a things fairly easy. But yeah, I'm not seeing any client specific stuff? Well, we could

Matthias Miller  40:22
mean there's way janky ways to work around it. You could have a dummy or 20 in the base accounting system, and just have the label be blank, which would hide the button for the clients. If you're okay with that as an approach, we could

Unknown Speaker  40:44
we could just but

Matthias Miller  40:50
no, no, it's easier than that. We use a add a custom,

Unknown Speaker  40:57
a custom URL macro.

Matthias Miller  41:00
That references component which path is a piece of Sure. It will just have a custom reconcile button and customer. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  41:10
Good. Yep.

Matthias Miller  41:17
Time timeframe for this Drew?

Speaker 5  41:22
ASAP? Um, I don't know. I was just thinking if you're waiting on Josh, for the credit thing, then I don't know, can this get squeezed in before that before you do your part of that or not?

Speaker 1  41:41
And the reason this is is very saying ASAP is because it would greatly speed up his

Unknown Speaker  41:48
process. And

Speaker 5  41:50
yeah, the the more current we become the more of an issue we run into AP and duplications if we don't if we can't create vendor invoices for them,

Matthias Miller  41:58
right? Yeah, this is perfect.

Speaker 2  42:05
Limits. Oh, yeah. Last one, disallow and deleting deposits with linked payments.

Matthias Miller  42:12
This is one of those things that I think falls into the category of where this would be nice to have. And technically, it's a way better. It's it's technically accurate. And we ran into it one time, and we might never run it into again for a year. We do you guys care enough to fix it? That we should I don't think it's a lot of work. But

Speaker 1  42:34
what happened? Where are we? Or wasn't he somebody deleted it? Yeah,

Speaker 5  42:38
the deposit was deleted, but the payment still said it was deposited. And so and you can't change the deposit, you can't change the payment without deleting it from removing it from the deposit. But there was no deposit there and

Unknown Speaker  42:55
payment was stopped. Yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  42:58
contact fast.

Speaker 1  42:59
How much work is would there be? It's,

Unknown Speaker  43:05
I don't know.

Speaker 1  43:07
If this is another one of the things that would fit in the category of the one we just talked about, like these are the things that can take a lot of time for grooming. If you could fit it in before the third game, then go for it

Unknown Speaker  43:29
the situation may not arise then we never know when the situation is gonna. We don't

Unknown Speaker  43:35
So success here Matthias is if we never

Unknown Speaker  43:41
if we never need it. Yeah, exactly.

Matthias Miller  43:44
All right. Um, in the interest of jewels time, is there anything on the agenda that we need to talk talk with him about?

Unknown Speaker  43:54
Through creating vendor invoice check printing? No. Absolutely.

Matthias Miller  44:04
Anything else in the project management side?

Speaker 1  44:10
Thank you thank balance sheets, but like budget budget reports. That's all done. Talked about cash flows.

Unknown Speaker  44:23
No, I don't think they're great. Okay,

Speaker 2  44:27
let me get all this updated. I'll send new reports to everybody and guess have a good day.

Matthias Miller  44:34
Awesome. Thanks.

Speaker 4  44:37
And am I understanding correctly that there's nothing for conversation for me right now?

Speaker 3  44:45
I think we're. Thanks. So I think we're good. Yeah. All right.

Speaker 4  44:49
Well, good seeing you all.

Unknown Speaker  44:52
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  44:53
Terrific rest of the week.

Unknown Speaker  44:57
Thanks, Joe. All

Matthias Miller  45:04
right could we take a few minute break here before we dive into the word

Speaker 1  45:14
do we want to be alive in 25

Matthias Miller  45:20
I mean 1120 is fine by me unless like just a quick break

Unknown Speaker  45:24
it'd be good RIGHT?

Unknown Speaker  49:31
All right, thank you for that

Matthias Miller  49:38
alright jumping into the agenda check printing I have not had a chance to take a look at that today I'm printing vendor invoices when doing reconciles that will require an update but I can take a look at doing that

Unknown Speaker  49:51
today or tomorrow.

Speaker 1  49:55
Okay, but which one creates or requires an update to We just got a duplicate I think of of the one that we asked

Unknown Speaker  50:10
to have priority for the 13th

Matthias Miller  50:14
check printing I don't know for sure it might not but if it's if check printing is

Unknown Speaker  50:25
urgent

Matthias Miller  50:27
well I guess if if check printing is urgent then I can see if we can get by without an update.

Speaker 1  50:36
I think we should because you have ever got all those checks in there for this week that typically go out Wednesday right? Whatever to print it and go out Wednesday and

Matthias Miller  50:57
all right, I will I can take a look at that. Um

Speaker 1  51:03
Is that true? Do you need your heading out your 12 Is that Well you're not doing the printing right but you still I'm

Unknown Speaker  51:12
not but they would have the office they would

Speaker 1  51:15
just wondering do you need like once that once we get to that it's good to go Matthias

Speaker 5  51:24
lets you know yeah unless he like if it's just a matter of sending a special you know special link to a special report to make it happen or something like that we could just have you send it directly to Nelson was doing what kind of fix you're talking

Matthias Miller  51:41
about? I mean one way or the other if you would like me to be in contact with Nelson about the fix I can I can email you at Nelson about it. Yeah,

Speaker 5  51:50
might as well just do that just copy him in on anything

Unknown Speaker  52:03
okay,

Speaker 1  52:03
what does that look like? Do you have any idea

Matthias Miller  52:07
I'm just taking a look at it now a little bit

Matthias Miller  52:40
it's doesn't look super complicated but the way it is it's probably actually easier not to create custom links for you guys.

Unknown Speaker  52:48
I will

Matthias Miller  52:51
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  52:54
you're thinking today sometime?

Matthias Miller  52:56
i Yeah, today's today's some time for sure. I think anyone we wrap this up I might actually be able to get it done before one year time but okay. If not that by end of day to day some some time for sure.

Unknown Speaker  53:14
That would be if it doesn't need an update

Matthias Miller  53:18
I can do without an update.

Unknown Speaker  53:20
Okay

Unknown Speaker  53:22
great. Yeah

Matthias Miller  53:29
greeting vendor invoices when doing reconciles we talked about this probably could also get this done in time for an update this weekend. Shouldn't be I should be able to gonna happen FTI calculations by so report. Is this a user report?

Speaker 1  53:48
Yeah, it's not a standard report yet. I think you call it FTI calculations by Sal report you

Unknown Speaker  53:59
are and you're wanting additional columns dealer column

Speaker 1  54:05
that's not much a standard report but right now it's

Unknown Speaker  54:16
let me take a look at what's

Unknown Speaker  54:27
not a fast report by any means.

Speaker 1  54:34
Because about it as well. So question on this is rather than me bothering Ben or drew to sent me that report when we do off dates. If we turn it into a standard report, then Josh can easily add it to the to the thing he built where we can download reports in real time.

Unknown Speaker  55:01
Oh, no

Speaker 1  55:02
system is like, what would it take to turn this into a standard reporter?

Matthias Miller  55:13
Well, I mean, it's getting this right. And then it's not it's it's pretty inconsequential to turn it into standard report.

Speaker 1  55:22
Okay, let's hold off on turning it into a standard report until we've, yeah, that's it, give it a week or two.

Matthias Miller  55:30
So what type of

Unknown Speaker  55:34
let's see. See. So

Matthias Miller  55:39
4021 When they team,

Speaker 1  55:44
the basic revenue accounts, I want to show there or have a column for all revenue accounts. I think these are just a few that we might have missed.

Matthias Miller  55:55
So really, what you want is you want to show all revenue accounts, even if there's no transactions for it? Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  56:05
Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 1  56:07
maybe doing I mean, the idea would be to show all revenue accounts. And even if we add a new revenue account, which is inserted called No.

Speaker 3  56:20
All right, Consider it done. It's not to do and

Matthias Miller  56:27
then transactions would be all. You want any transactions that are not linked to a building or sale, we would already have a row for every building and sales order, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1  56:41
And the use case here is this report is quite helpful in breaking down the income statement, like at least down to two cogs. And so we can look at where did all of our income come from? But the totals are not usually not quite tying out with the income statement because of some legit transactions that we have.

Unknown Speaker  57:07
Right? Yeah, just

Unknown Speaker  57:11
two or three transactions usually.

Matthias Miller  57:15
Okay. I think it's fair timeframe on this? I mean, I don't really foresee any issues gonna get done the day to be honest.

Speaker 1  57:26
But and this does not require an update, or does it sends it to us,

Matthias Miller  57:35
I mean, the user report doesn't, if we want to be late, if we, if it's time sensitive and urgent, we can push it as a standard report for Josh, and I'm gonna guess Josh isn't gonna be able to add it to whatever he's got going on until next week anyway. But let's keep

Unknown Speaker  57:52
it as a user report. And I take you get it by, like, end of day Friday, is that

Unknown Speaker  58:00
I think that's tall. And I'm starting that,

Unknown Speaker  58:04
how about end of day to day,

Matthias Miller  58:07
I give it a shot. I got a cancellation today. So I'm out for the middle of the day. But I've got some time at the end of the day. So I think I've got a pretty good shot at that. The reason

Unknown Speaker  58:17
we've got it got Callum shed time here tomorrow, and I want to spend some time on right through that. So that'd be nice to have. But yeah.

Unknown Speaker  58:29
All right. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  58:35
On the transactions by contact, this means you want to search for two accounts, I want to look for everything in the checking accounts. So for example, I want to find everything in primary second, and the secondary checking accounts that are in all those, any of those, and I want to filter by it also has to have at least one of these other ones as well.

Speaker 5  59:02
Well, we already have this, this report, um, it's just a just adding like account selection, the subtype, we were able, you had made it where we have to go through and like each one, each account we want to see the effects and then you had made a user report I think, or somehow it went away and quit working now but where you can just select the subtype and it shows all of administrators it selects all the administrative expenses and so it's really just that and an all accounts selection. Just bring back in those selection options.

Matthias Miller  59:50
Do I get a bonus if I get this done by today as well?

Speaker 1  59:54
Yeah, sent me your your address and favorite

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
Sounds good all right well that's easy. I think surprise surprise when I get into it but make sense

Speaker 1  1:00:20
mean I know this is a little clunky but that all accounts selection rather than requesting a whole bunch of reports to try and break this down I said Well, let's let's go to just all accounts that can drop it into I can create myself a template in Excel and just pull out like setup selections we're gonna look at all transactions in this date range or everything that starts with 62 or 64 or what yeah so

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:00:59
that's sounds straight word enough and then for those transactions when you're searching for

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
let's see, hang on,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
let me buy but sorry good

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
when you are showing all accounts are you wanting to see which line item do you want to see in the report?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
Or do you want to see just the action?

Matthias Miller  1:01:42
Yeah, or can we just show I mean, or do you just want all all transactions

Speaker 1  1:01:47
Well, can you can you just bring up that report and we can we can take a quick look at it right now we're just we're just showing the expense side

Matthias Miller  1:02:00
what we're showing whatever side that you're searching for which you would only ever search for the expense side but if you wanted to search by an asset side or even primary checking that's what you would see

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
oh come on let's it's that's why it's taking so long

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
there's a date range here where we've got quite a few transactions that we can

Speaker 3  1:02:49
wonder if we've got oh your company key part system like the financial account the accounts if is in a vs accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:03:16
okay, this might still take a little bit of

Speaker 3  1:03:25
new transit we had Transaction Date index I don't know if we have anything like that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
carbon birth verify dates trans by date and system ID that would make it faster

Matthias Miller  1:03:52
I mean currently the way it would it is now

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57
it will

Matthias Miller  1:04:00
we we should be sorting by transaction ID here but it's just

Speaker 1  1:04:09
okay is this if you do all train all transit are all accounts all accounts. So we have it going into AP and then coming out of AP.

Matthias Miller  1:04:19
Here it looks do this date source string number source string count transaction ID

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
and let's see if we can do

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
find range

Unknown Speaker  1:04:49
so what messages that you should have if

Speaker 5  1:04:57
you need to go back raw material the Second and Third moments are well I don't have a good way of knowing until I you know like first month you know like that will be right but the next model you know it's each makes adjustments

Speaker 1  1:05:18
a month do all math correct and they all end up at the same but if

Speaker 5  1:05:24
if none of them need adjustments at all but if any of them need adjustments then it adjusts everything everything after that everything after that was wrong okay, what

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
ellipses are not supported and find range well that's probably not

Speaker 6  1:06:20
yeah we need several ways, we need to cross check few things like

Unknown Speaker  1:06:34
so,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
here

Matthias Miller  1:06:39
I mean this is if we just leave it as is, then it would show up like this twice, like by date first. Transaction ID good.

Speaker 1  1:06:49
Maybe we should instead of saying all maybe we should do tell me if this is wrong, but maybe we should exclude all the liability

Unknown Speaker  1:07:02
accounts and everything else

Speaker 5  1:07:07
you because really what you want to show is the stuff that hits the expense and asset accounts primarily, equity equity, Randy kind of nice. Yeah, wow. Okay, revenue.

Speaker 1  1:07:23
We probably wouldn't use revenue since we already have that on the other report, but I think I would include it here. i

Unknown Speaker  1:07:29
If you removed only the liabilities? I'd be curious to see what then you

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
most situations you wouldn't have

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
the two sides of a transaction?

Speaker 5  1:07:46
Well, right, I mean, because most transactions have a liability in between it's accounts payable, or it's the credit card or Ipsy. Yeah, like there's something in between this that's gonna make it one that show up multiple times places

Matthias Miller  1:08:05
but you would still see the bank half of the account of the liability and you would then see the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14
other half so

Matthias Miller  1:08:15
we could do a what if we did something like

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28
a campaign

Matthias Miller  1:08:30
and then also you could filter and you could then sub filter by

Matthias Miller  1:08:49
I'm not going to I'm not going to go to the work of making it actually work.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:54
But

Speaker 3  1:08:56
But would you would hear this is this needs to change

Matthias Miller  1:09:08
so then, you would go in here Well, here let me let me let me actually

Unknown Speaker  1:09:19
let me do this. So you can

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
think there are several ways that that will be nice. Part of this process should be

Unknown Speaker  1:09:40
this thing is just a little bit clunky yet. I

Speaker 5  1:09:42
don't think this function right here. The difference. I mean it shows the difference, but I don't have a way to figure out what number I need to put in here from the adjustment needs made. Like

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
to where it will calculate on

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
So that's what we're talking about it

Unknown Speaker  1:10:04
basic function

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
all right, if you can, like, excuse the approximations, but you could filter by account types. And then if you want to further filter by that by

Speaker 1  1:10:35
checking or whatever, you could do that, right like this, this shows all the child accounts in the accounts on the right.

Matthias Miller  1:10:44
Yeah, this would filter by this list. And if you wanted to further filter it down, and then or you could

Speaker 3  1:10:59
count types, one, one, and then we have something like accounts to multi multi.

Speaker 3  1:11:20
40, we did 30, sinnissippi, 100 reps. 10 150 7100 107, B, one and one, one. And one and we're actually going to let's not rename this so that we can actually look at what it would look like. Oops.

Matthias Miller  1:11:45
So you end up with something that looks kind of like this.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:53
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:12:02
So yeah, I'd say just let me know, ones that live and ready to go. And then I'll probably okay with with you. And then I'll just reach out to Ben for men, unless you want me to just tell you what, there's three reports and looking for right now, but which is basically one. One for each company from January one through April 30. And showing all accounts, except I could send you an email, but showing all accounts exempt. Liabilities, and

Unknown Speaker  1:12:45
probably the Yeah, that I can just

Speaker 1  1:12:58
Should I just send an email to you, Ben? On? Yeah, go ahead and send me an email.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:04
Yeah, like, that'd probably work best.

Matthias Miller  1:13:06
Alright, then I'll send an email to whenever when this is done to mark and Ben. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:19
Good. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:23
Is this gonna be a user report or standard?

Matthias Miller  1:13:29
I haven't. I haven't decided if I want to go to the work of making it. I mean, it will end up being stuck. We will end up making the transactions by contact report report

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
be

Matthias Miller  1:13:47
whether we use this use report in the short term, I'm not sure but long term. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:50
Standard.

Matthias Miller  1:13:57
Good, good. Awesome.

Speaker 1  1:14:00
Thanks, Ben. For the reports. You've been helping me. Yeah. Hopefully. Short term. I know you've got things that are more

Speaker 1  1:14:15
better fit for your your skill level, but the short term it's, it's helping. Yeah, we'll go ahead and be the VFL. Good, I think that's all we have. Anything else? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:36
Good to hear. Yeah. Sounds good. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:14:41
Thank you. Cool. Awesome. Thanks.
