Unknown Speaker  00:56
Yo yo yo.

Matthias Miller  01:01
What else this illegal.

Unknown Speaker  01:08
Each bin moi Vien, ich,

Matthias Miller  01:10
Bin moi Vien. I just about said, Kio, Bucha, that's, that's the slang. What's up in Bangla?

Unknown Speaker  01:23
Uh, how's,

Speaker 1  01:24
how has y'all had some snow sometime real recently? Hadn't you, uh,

Matthias Miller  01:30
two or three weeks ago?

Speaker 1  01:31
Uh, was that long ago? I don't, I don't pay close enough attention to my family chat.

Matthias Miller  01:39
My wife got done writing a letter of recommendation for your sister

Unknown Speaker  01:42
two,

Matthias Miller  01:45
well, they're changing her title, and for some reason, she needs three letters of recommendation to change her title, but do the same work. I have no idea. Morning, guys, that's not bureaucracy. I don't know what is

Unknown Speaker  02:03
I didn't realize she was working for the government, I'll tell you, yeah,

Speaker 1  02:18
I would, well, now that's not true. I I've been around, I've been around mission organizations to realize how political they can get. So,

Matthias Miller  02:28
yeah, I mean, it's under the agency, so who knows if it's, I don't know if it's which side it's coming from, but anyway, oh, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  02:34
didn't think about that.

Unknown Speaker  02:39
Mark. Hey, Drew. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  02:43
We miss anything interesting.

Matthias Miller  02:48
No, just talking about bureaucracy and Moab writing letters of recommendation for Dwayne's sister. He's working works out

Speaker 1  02:58
she needed three, three letters of of a recommendation, or to change her title inside of the same organization,

Matthias Miller  03:07
doing exactly the same work.

Unknown Speaker  03:11
So what? What is the work she does?

Matthias Miller  03:14
Uh, she's a policeman, supervisor with a buster with the new horizons. So New Horizons has two entities. One's like the nonprofit, but then they also have a licensed foster agency, and she's a caseworker slash voicemail supervisor in there. So

Speaker 1  03:38
yeah, I didn't, I didn't think about it. I suspect it comes from the it probably comes from the the state side of, you know, the agency side of, they probably require some things like that, versus the actual organization.

Unknown Speaker  03:57
Yeah,

Speaker 2  03:59
good. Well, I see we have scheduled for an hour today. I think somebody had cut off time, which I think that'll be, yeah, that we should be able to cover what we have an hour. So let's cover upcoming meetings. First, I got your responses. Got responses from Beth Matthias, so we'll assume that that works for Dwayne. And I guess it doesn't. Um, so 12 five and 12, it'll 12 five next Thursday, just typical Thursday meeting. And then we selected 1211 be the following Wednesday. That was a week we had Tuesday, Wednesday, and you'd said both of those days work. So

Unknown Speaker  04:53
what? What time? Mark, 930

Speaker 2  04:55
day. You should have gotten an email with with these meetings. Updated. I did okay. So, yeah, 930 to 11, if that works for

Unknown Speaker  05:06
Yeah, that should, that should be fine. And

Speaker 2  05:08
then the 19th, I believe that's on a Thursday again.

Speaker 2  05:18
And then the 26 no meeting that week with Christmas and then, oh, I still have those wrong. I have both, one, 224, I'm going back in time. Said that.

Speaker 3  05:34
Yeah, I gave Josh's fantastic time. Travel is not response.

Speaker 2  05:41
January, 2, 25 no meeting, and then the 925 will resume regular meeting.

Speaker 1  05:51
I think, I think we should address that as part of our 2025 projects, we should address time travel.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Well, let's get a get a real past and we don't know what it would cost. Yeah,

Speaker 1  06:09
I say we elicit Marty McFly and see what happens.

Matthias Miller  06:15
I'm gonna say Elon is gonna be busy getting rid of government departments, so I don't know that he's available to help. He

Speaker 1  06:23
probably would be the if anybody's going to solve it, he'd probably be the one. But, yeah, he's gonna be a little busy for the next couple years, as if he wasn't already,

Speaker 4  06:31
I'm behind times. What's he supposed to be doing?

Matthias Miller  06:35
He's supposed to head up the Department of government efficiency, really, which is an unofficial advisory departmental role, but it's basically what, what happens when an entrepreneur comes in into a bureaucratic organization, we take a look at Twitter and X, can we fire 80% of the government and still?

Speaker 1  06:57
Wouldn't that be amazing? So poetic.

Speaker 4  07:00
I mean, not something that the Senate and stuff has to approve, because it's not official.

Matthias Miller  07:06
I'm guessing something like that. I don't know. I mean, certainly any actions that he takes has to be approved. But

Unknown Speaker  07:14
Right, right, but not his position.

Unknown Speaker  07:18
So, so it's, yeah, anyway, so

Speaker 2  07:22
you mentioned Twitter. So is that actually what happened? Like 80% of the employees?

Matthias Miller  07:30
Yeah, most of it, a lot of it was staff due to due to censorship or moderation, content moderation, but just also a lot of unnecessary people, I guess so. I mean, valuation has definitely taken a hit, a substantial hit. He's lost subscription revenue, but, but, but he now owns a social media platform that holds the, at least the, I think largely does, I don't know how much is. I always have some level of skepticism, but holds the idea that we have one kind of public square social media that's not filtered and has its algorithm highly tilted by leftist agenda. So

Speaker 1  08:21
the latest rumor, which would just be funny if it actually happened, is that there is talk of Elon Musk buying MSNBC and and there was, there was apparently some back and forth on on Twitter x with Joe Rogan and Elon Musk that says, Joe Rogan says, I want Rachel Maddow. Rachel maddow's job, I wear the glasses and everything, and sit there and tell lies just like her, just the comic relief of some of this stuff. But wouldn't it be hilarious if he actually came in and bought MSNBC? This would just be so funny. It's going to be entertaining for the next four years, if nothing else. Yeah, I have to, I have to think back in 2015 when, when Hillary and Trump were running, and I asked a friend of mine, I said, so who do you going to vote for? And he said he's voting for Trump. He said, either way, it's going to hell in a hand basket. But at least with Trump, it's going to be entertaining. It's kind of the same way for for 2025 it's going to be like, Well, who knows what's going to happen, but it's going to definitely be entertaining.

Matthias Miller  09:38
Well, this is way more entertaining that a subsequent term would have been,

Unknown Speaker  09:43
oh yeah, no kidding.

Speaker 2  09:49
Yeah. So, so is, Will Elon keep his like? Will he's stay on as CEO at the other companies that he has during like, during this? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  09:59
He only needs, like, four or five hours of sleep at night. He works the rest of the time. I mean, he should be good,

Speaker 4  10:08
but this is not an official position. He doesn't have to get out of all his others.

Matthias Miller  10:13
Oh, even if it would be. I mean, he bought Twitter and was running Twitter on top of everything else he was doing. So, yeah, I don't know the guy is slightly super human. Well, I mean, I'm sure his standards for family life and things like that are probably a little different than yours and yours and mine. You got to take it, take the time from somewhere. But he does take the mandate to populate the earth fairly seriously as well. So anyway, good gracious, that's off topic

Unknown Speaker  10:55
political bonding trail.

Speaker 2  10:59
So even with, even with 80% of the people no longer at Twitter, it still works just as well like from it.

Unknown Speaker  11:08
Well, a lot would say it actually works better.

Matthias Miller  11:13
There's an equal number of people that would say that it's worse. But the real core audience for Twitter. Yes, they're on board, and they're introducing, one of the reasons for introducing, they're introducing a subscription model. One of the reasons is that it's really hard if you have to verify your account with a credit card and a phone number. It's really difficult to okay, it's easy to spoof free accounts and make it look like it's lots of different people, but it's really hard to get a wide variety of credit card numbers that aren't and phone numbers that aren't all somehow linked together. And so that, you know, just solving some of that from a technological standpoint, it's just a way better solution. And in my opinion,

Speaker 2  12:07
where would you start with, with making the government more efficient? Like well,

Speaker 1  12:15
actually, Milton Friedman, this is quite a number of years ago. Milton Friedman had a whole paper written and interviews that went along with this. Milton Friedman's a pretty entrenched economist, and he has basically a whole list of government agencies that should just go and I have a feeling it's when the roadmap came out. I haven't specifically read across the roadmap that Vivek and Elon put out, but it's kind of close to what Milton Friedman said should happen. So it's like Department of Education. There's well, and the interesting one that's that I really find really, really interesting is this idea that we're not necessarily going to shut some of these agencies down, but we're going to move them out. Going to move them out of Washington and move them out to, you know, other states, and then require people to come back to work. And the comment was made that, well, that'll eliminate half the workforce for the some of these agencies right there.

Matthias Miller  13:19
That's true. Who has the added benefit of, if you relocate some of these into Nebraska, Kansas, I mean, you guys want them there, but it's it's good for some of these states that don't have have as much economic stimulus.

Unknown Speaker  13:41
That's interesting. Wow,

Unknown Speaker  13:47
yeah, it'll be. It'll be fun watching.

Matthias Miller  13:54
We're all sitting there who's, who's the 20% or who's the 80% who's leaving the call here, not coming back anyway.

Speaker 2  14:07
Good. So if we go to the agenda, handling retrievals, have you and Josh talked, I guess it would have only been Thursday or Friday since we've last off.

Matthias Miller  14:18
We have not. I was waiting for Josh to reach out the Atmos at the time.

Speaker 2  14:26
So let's go to the paper cut projects 1099, through you looked at that this morning.

Speaker 5  14:32
So it looks like the columns are functioning well, but we're not pulling any data, and there's only one way that we found that pulls anything in. I think that was all companies, 1099, vendors, and all accounts or something pulls in just a couple. Are

Speaker 3  14:57
you running with? Okay, let me see. I mean running with it completely blank, besides the date range gives a whole bunch. As

Unknown Speaker  15:07
soon as you select the company, it's going blank. Okay, let me see.

Speaker 5  15:21
But even even with this, there should be 100 more, um,

Speaker 3  15:30
although earlier, we were showing ones that never had amounts, I don't I think we were incorrectly showing a whole bunch, but maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker 5  15:37
Well, yeah, that was definitely the case.

Matthias Miller  15:40
So you think there's 100 you think there's 100 people using 100 vendors, using 1099, accounts.

Speaker 5  15:52
I would think it's a lot more than this. I mean, I got across all the companies. I mean, across all three companies. I got 1-234-567-8910, 1112, 1314,

Unknown Speaker  16:07
in these accounts.

Speaker 5  16:12
But I mean, a bunch of these are agencies,

Unknown Speaker  16:16
I think everything, yeah, or all the ones that showed up

Speaker 5  16:21
like and then when I actually select for the company of ABC, they all go away

Unknown Speaker  16:28
somehow.

Matthias Miller  16:31
So, but, but you still don't think this is you still think it should be way more than this.

Unknown Speaker  16:35
I think so.

Matthias Miller  16:38
Well, let's go take a look. I

Unknown Speaker  16:52
Okay, so these are the three ones. So let's do let's do GL in each of these. Let's do one line, one line, one, one, all right.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
I mean one two here. Let's sort

Unknown Speaker  17:19
things earlier. Make it easy.

Matthias Miller  17:25
123, we got four in real estate, ABC, 1-234-567-8910,

Unknown Speaker  17:38
and two.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
There's one like United States LLC, that one was not, you weren't seeing report. Were

Unknown Speaker  17:52
you right that one isn't

Speaker 2  17:56
added to shock and lanes were not on the report. Now is that?

Unknown Speaker  18:12
Sure it's the wrong one.

Speaker 5  18:14
But I mean, it should like, technically, if you don't select vendor and you don't select account, it does it. I mean, it should show everything, that every single transaction shouldn't it, because we

Matthias Miller  18:24
haven't, we haven't been, we haven't been, and we have a good way of showing totals for that, because that's why everything was showing up zero, because we were sending all the debits and all the credits for all vendors, for all transaction transactions, and they All zero out. So you're looking, you're looking for vendors in non 1099 accounts. Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  18:49
Well, I mean, the

Speaker 5  18:52
having both 1099 vendor and 1099 account be blank and include all isn't really a an option, like, I mean, it's not a it's not a thing that I would need to do. What I would be looking for is I want to find all the vendors in these accounts. So I would select based on the accounts. Then I leave the vendors as blank for all, because I want to find some that I might be missing. And then I would switch the other way and say, okay, all these vendors, where else are they showing up in other accounts? So I'd select something for the vendors accounts blank, like, that's, that's going to be the the two ways that I would use it.

Unknown Speaker  19:38
So you want,

Matthias Miller  19:41
well, that's that's different than what we have been doing. I mean, the basic idea then is, go find, find the universe of vendors. And the universe of vendors could be any vendor that has is tied to a 1099 account, whether they're flagged or not, or any vendor that is flagged as a 1099 account. It, and then go, and then, I mean, it's really, where are those people?

Unknown Speaker  20:10
Now, could we

Matthias Miller  20:13
okay? But then why

Speaker 6  20:16
check dating range, trans and contact modeler, G subject accounts? Companies in string is this for sure?

Speaker 3  20:33
Well, that's what I was trying to figure out. Why we'll see. I was trying to debug that, but we don't actually show we don't have any rows, so I also tried that, and I was just showing The records found.

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Oh, well, let's do this. Then I

Unknown Speaker  21:34
Yeah, so stuff we need to move that. I

Matthias Miller  21:45
so that's why they're not showing up for other stuff. But let's talk a little bit about okay, but then why?

Unknown Speaker  21:59
I know why?

Unknown Speaker  22:06
Well, what accounts that we pay for? 1099, well, I

Speaker 5  22:08
think most of the stuff that I've actually flagged, whether accounts or vendors, is ABC stuff. I don't really have gone through the other companies that I think all the vendors at the accounts I have the same for all the companies, but there should be more chance like that is to, you know, like all the Self Storage

Unknown Speaker  22:28
maintenance and all the different this is

Matthias Miller  22:36
from 23 Oops.

Unknown Speaker  22:44
I'm confused.

Matthias Miller  22:48
We have a GL account, 23 transactions. Talk about time travel. What am I missing? January, one, December five, I don't know. Seth, I think we had trouble

Unknown Speaker  23:05
that one's weird. For that one? No,

Matthias Miller  23:08
you'd have to take blame for it, but maybe, if you want to but fix it, either fix it or delegate it. It would be useful. Let me grab it. What is going

Unknown Speaker  23:20
on? Is this a general ledger out of say, like the income statement, or the

Matthias Miller  23:28
sort of accounts?

Matthias Miller  23:34
I can't use settings here, because it's a

Speaker 3  23:37
report, look so, so it's on what did you have it set to you today?

Matthias Miller  23:44
I had it set with a front from date. Oh, date, rain on the 24th but I wonder what happens if I do? I sent you the link to you in screenshots, you can see if I put it in end date, it works. So something's wrong. Diversified services now let's see if these are showing up right. Diversified services,

Unknown Speaker  24:14
yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:19
I mean that looks right. Stephanie, are you here? Yeah. Okay, so what if I have an idea? What if you what if we change the right pane here to group by show all transactions in the date range, but group by 1099, service accounts and 1099, non service accounts, I yay.

Unknown Speaker  24:49
Explain that again.

Matthias Miller  24:52
Let me see if I can just illustrate. Well, this is just transaction IDs, okay, so when you run the. Port, it would show you all 1099, oh, that, except it doesn't include 299 vendors.

Speaker 6  25:08
Well, if we hang on, sorry, give me a minute. Let me, let me. Let me. Get this straight. It's a vendor and I

Speaker 7  25:36
if this report would show all contacts who have any transaction in the date range

Matthias Miller  25:51
here, here's how to make it clear. Here we go. We have two total columns, 1099, total and all transactions total, which, sorry. Okay, let's go along for the ride. So you have two total columns, and you select one, and then you see, oh, here are the 10 and nine transactions, and here are the non 1099, transactions. And then you can drill in and go take a look and reconcile everything out, and we include anything in here. If you blank out the the minimum amount, we would show anything in there that has a total in either column, right, right. Okay, now that's all fine and good, except if you're literally looking at all transactions, well, those total to zero. So

Speaker 7  26:45
then we could, can you pull from only

Speaker 5  26:52
the expense accounts? Or, well, but expense or assets, account, asset accounts? Yes, yes. Or what

Matthias Miller  27:01
if we just did it really simply, what if we just did a count? Here's the number of non, 1099, transactions, and just count the number of transactions.

Unknown Speaker  27:21
Or what

Matthias Miller  27:25
like for here, like air works here, is there one that you expected to have some non 1099 stuff

Speaker 5  27:37
that works would have, right? Okay, I mean, they would definitely have non 1099,

Matthias Miller  27:42
so we do something like transactions,

Unknown Speaker  27:47
like contact. Well, that's not what I'm looking for. Transaction Search. I

Unknown Speaker  28:03
Let's do this. I don't

Unknown Speaker  28:12
know this shows me exactly what I want, 295

Matthias Miller  28:17
so here it shows there's 11 here. So then it would show 284 non 1099, transactions. So you wouldn't see the total of the transactions, but you could see the how many of them there are.

Speaker 5  28:36
And then do away with the accounts button. I mean the accounts filter on the Ask prompt or not well. I mean, what are you changing up for that? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  28:57
no, fair,

Matthias Miller  29:00
yes, you would do away with it, because then you would show anybody, anybody who has, that has is either is marked, I would say the report. You would change the report to show anybody who's marked as a 1099 vendor, or has transactions in a 1099 account,

Speaker 2  29:34
and then any other transactions, like for airworks here the 284 would just show you have a column that says two and 84 other transactions are right outside of

Matthias Miller  29:52
but to your point, we could. We could also just filter by liability, expense accounts.

Unknown Speaker  29:56
That'd be fine. I.

Speaker 5  30:06
If I can get a report, so that I because I will need to know which 1099, accounts a report is of I would that become just a like? Basically, it would just be a selector as to which accounts do you want, not an all option. How would that work?

Matthias Miller  30:38
You mean which specific?

Speaker 5  30:40
Yeah, like you just select deal account, give me the NEC accounts, or give me the miscellaneous accounts. We would

Matthias Miller  30:49
just make these be visible all the time, and you can choose Blank if you don't, if you don't,

Unknown Speaker  30:59
if you don't care. I here?

Unknown Speaker  31:10
Am I making it too complicated, complicated, like,

Speaker 5  31:17
I really like how this is or the idea of it, if it goes blank, you know, if, if both of them being empty for all does not work, that's fine, actually, because I might as well pull up The other reports, if that's what I'm looking for like.

Speaker 6  31:49
So walk me. Walk me through how you would idealize again this. You just want a way to run this report on non 1099 accounts for any contact who is flagged to the 1099

Unknown Speaker  32:12
vendor, right? Just like

Speaker 5  32:13
this, right? I want to be able to do that. Okay, wherever they might be,

Unknown Speaker  32:21
and then

Unknown Speaker  32:25
so I want for the accounts I want,

Unknown Speaker  32:29
basically,

Speaker 5  32:33
well, I mean, it could be like an all option brings in any of them, the no often brings, specifically not in accounts, which isn't full, but I can, it's be easier to see what it actually is. What is there to say? Oh, yeah, this one was on the account already. But then also we would be able to select between the two different counties. And then if, if vendors is all, then I then, then I want to look at, okay, now, where am I in? What else is in my 1099 accounts of people that should be flagged and aren't,

Unknown Speaker  33:14
you know, right there, yeah.

Matthias Miller  33:17
So really, the only change is that, if we bring back 1099, accounts, blankets resolve to literally mean all again and and change it to some ask, live, lib, sorry, which one liability and expense accounts? Um,

Speaker 5  33:38
I think it would be asset and expense asset liabilities, then you're going to be pulling in the like Accounts Payable transaction, right,

Matthias Miller  33:46
right, right, right, right. No, that's obvious. Wow, that is obvious. Okay, thank you. Um, so pulling asset and expense accounts for totaling and that's really all that needs to change,

Speaker 7  34:02
right? Should be okay. That should

Speaker 5  34:05
work. I'm trying to think, if we're ever, yeah, I mean nothing, that's a lot. Well, no, if we're paying somebody interest, but that's going to be an expense account. The actual loan payments, not in line. It's just the interest. Yeah, I think that should work. Well,

Matthias Miller  34:30
you're going to catch everything. I mean, well not. I guess you could have a Never mind. Okay, change the totaling to asset plus expense, fix the company filter. Is there ever reason you actually want to run this for all companies? No, I. I'm going to say required company selection. All right,

Speaker 2  35:09
this as a, as a user report first, just for Drew to use and make sure before we, before we make it a standard report. Or is that I we,

Matthias Miller  35:24
we could that's, that's up to, that's up to you. Seth,

Speaker 5  35:31
I don't think I'm going to get to it this week. So, okay, I don't know if that makes a difference.

Matthias Miller  35:38
Well, will you get to reviewing it this week.

Unknown Speaker  35:40
I could do that, if I have, yeah.

Speaker 3  35:46
I mean, in that case, we can just make it a user, I mean, create a copy as a user report for this week, and you can review it and see if it looks good and

Unknown Speaker  35:54
if it does. So we can Yeah,

Speaker 6  35:58
and so we can get our heads together later this morning. Sure. Yeah, sweet, good.

Speaker 2  36:09
So two payment type, I think we talked about that last week you were going to verify whether payment this payment type correct will handle still under handles both situations. Have you had a chance to look at that? Or do you have

Speaker 6  36:32
does the best of our knowledge and ability and understanding?

Unknown Speaker  36:36
Okay, so unless

Unknown Speaker  36:38
I'm good with that

Speaker 2  36:43
accounting impact for use tax. I forget exactly what that was. I think just some changes which

Speaker 3  36:50
well it was making. So we actually have accounting impact for use tax. I don't think we did. Is that right as I recall? Yeah, I think so. Or at least, yeah, we

Speaker 2  37:02
haven't used it yet, but not we could not, okay, so now we could go ahead and use it. We have it up.

Speaker 3  37:11
Should be, yeah, good. I have, I mean, I need to add something to the scheduled task yet, but I have an email to do that. So once we're off the call, I'll update something, and then it'll get stuff done. Okay, okay,

Speaker 2  37:28
so then you could, you could do those three or four buildings, then you need to pay use tax.

Speaker 2  37:41
Four and five, I don't know that. Is there anything? No, those have gone live. You haven't,

Speaker 5  37:47
yeah, never any of anything. Number five is done good. I checked that one out. Nice.

Speaker 3  37:56
Cuz Dwayne, you can also let us know if you find if you're having any trouble with sales tax validation, we reworked it. It should be, should be much less problematic, hopefully,

Unknown Speaker  38:09
okay, but I want to

Speaker 3  38:13
hear if there's pain points. And yeah, I think we, I, I now have a better idea for next time I'd go in and try to do stuff with sales orders, what all I can do and not do and so,

Speaker 2  38:32
so see exclusion of closing transactions. I think that's probably the that's still the top priority on this page. So I

Speaker 3  38:42
haven't, I haven't gotten to that. I don't think I'll be able to get to it this week. Probably I'll work on it next week with Joel.

Matthias Miller  38:50
Okay, and I was going to propose that, perhaps that one, and maybe this is the wrong scope, this one might that one might not actually be a paper cut, that might actually be a big project, but

Unknown Speaker  39:07
you have a feel for the size of that set.

Unknown Speaker  39:12
Um,

Speaker 3  39:15
I mean, with the reports, it's touching, I'm gonna guess it might not be super small.

Unknown Speaker  39:21
I'll put it up

Speaker 3  39:24
ahead, yeah, number one at the top, and given it affects your end stuff, it's probably good to get done sooner rather than later. Good.

Unknown Speaker  39:37
So,

Speaker 2  39:39
tax, charter, pink dealer address. So Josh made a change. He said he took a stab at it. You should let him know if something is not working. So I

Unknown Speaker  39:50
said, How can we verify this is not working correctly? I didn't know. Is there an easy way we could look at some shifts? Right? If there is, we could if. That we can just keep going and let us and watch for these if they pop along. But,

Speaker 3  40:12
I mean, I think we could create a report to just see if the to show any sheds direct ones that are invoiced that where the tax address doesn't match the address from the dealer.

Matthias Miller  40:25
Well, there should be some that didn't ping. We saw someone really want the addresses on last week, working together,

Speaker 3  40:36
which, with this change, they should be fine now, yeah, well, yeah, if they let me see, some of them might have to be reaping or something. Um, they're

Speaker 2  40:45
you going to look at that Seth, if you want to just keep your eyes open and I

Speaker 3  40:51
can, I'm trying to check I

Speaker 3  41:09
are sheds direct ones, Anyone that's marked as legacy

Speaker 2  41:13
Could be, yeah, okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  41:44
I guess I could share my screen while I throw something together. Um,

Unknown Speaker  42:04
anything you change around. None of those,

Speaker 5  42:11
yeah, I mean, they're all stuff that'd be nice to be done, but it's not,

Speaker 6  42:16
not urgent. I I

Unknown Speaker  42:24
need a little bit more details on the COI, like, or it feels a lot like,

Speaker 3  42:33
wait, I can't actually check the tax field, can I? Because

Matthias Miller  42:38
it so, why don't we? Why don't we take a look at it later this morning. That'll

Speaker 3  42:41
be, yeah, I was just realizing in my head, I was thinking to compare the tax address, but we don't actually have, no, we don't so, yeah, we'll look Matthias, and I'll take a look at it later this

Unknown Speaker  42:58
morning. Basically, I What?

Unknown Speaker  43:05
Yeah, with number eight, I mean, a report to go along with it that just shows all our 1099, vendors, I guess.

Unknown Speaker  43:22
Well, I guess the first question

Unknown Speaker  43:24
I had an on, but the COI is,

Speaker 2  43:31
if your focus is on explosion of closing transactions, is, is it? Should we go through any of these others? Do you want to look at some of these to fit in or, or if you're not going to get to them, then I'd say we just don't do.

Speaker 3  43:50
What are we calling next? Next Thursday? A Thursday in a week and a half? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:01
we should, what

Speaker 3  44:03
were you saying? I was thinking we could look at one or two, but not very many. What are you thinking? Matthias,

Matthias Miller  44:09
I think because you're working with Joel, there's some variability in his availability. Yeah,

Speaker 3  44:14
we said we should have work lined up for you. Yes, yeah. So I think we look at two or something. We should be good to go.

Speaker 2  44:23
Okay, so eight, let's look at eight and eight, nine. So show COI, which is certificate of insurance on vendor type. Now, Drew, can you explain? Oh, I should say on vendor, vendor, right? Record, vendor, record, can? Can you explain the use case for COI so a

Speaker 5  44:51
if you have a subcontractor working for you, if they you're responsible for their insurance. If they don't have any, you. Yeah. So we want to be able to mark the vendor as that we have the certificate of insurance, so that when we do an audit, or, you know, an insurance audit, that we can see which ones to exclude, and don't have to go hunting for everything. So basically, it's just simply a checkbox that you say on the vendor. You say, we have this CUI and then make so that they can be attached to the vendor, which we might already have. That function, attaching, bringing documents to the vendor. You're not sure. Do you do you think we want specific attachment for COI, and then, if that, I mean, I'm afraid, if we have that people are just going to throw other documents anyway. But

Speaker 2  45:53
there's also, don't you have, like, an insurance number that you want to pull in on reporting as well? No, not necessarily. It's not like a 1099, right? So it's just,

Unknown Speaker  46:03
it's just,

Speaker 5  46:05
it's proof you're holding, proof that they have, that they're covered, so you don't have to So, and then they ask you to submit those documents sometimes, which you'd have to just go to the vendor

Unknown Speaker  46:17
submit that.

Matthias Miller  46:19
But on your end, don't you want to track how good it's, how long it's good for, like your certificate through?

Speaker 5  46:26
Yeah, an end date would work at an end date,

Speaker 2  46:32
like a good example, I think, would be work holder, transport Dwayne. I mean, you would have workload or transport would have their own certificate of insurance. So vinyl structures is not their insurance is not covering that, but they are, you know, some of the one or two man operations that you know occasionally haul or do handy or do subcontract work for them.

Speaker 2  47:09
So is it as simple as just adding a field on the band director and Matthias? Is your thought like what the date you added and the end date, or the just the end date, expiration, expiration,

Unknown Speaker  47:25
yeah, I mean, it

Unknown Speaker  47:32
just

Matthias Miller  47:35
depends how through you want to be. You can do that, or you could have a row per so. COI that shows entry date, good through, I don't know what the right term is, expiration date, and then place for the attachment. And then every time you add one, you would just

Unknown Speaker  47:58
add another row pretty

Speaker 7  48:02
well. I don't know that there's, you don't need that.

Speaker 5  48:06
I mean, I guess if something would come up about some historical question, it would be good, you know, because generally, they're good for a year.

Unknown Speaker  48:15
So you

Speaker 5  48:18
know, if it's the end of this year, and the incident was beginning of last year, and you've already gotten your new one, you've kicked the old thing off. And

Matthias Miller  48:26
probably the main reason for doing that is that somebody doesn't just go update the day without recording the actual proof,

Unknown Speaker  48:32
right, right? And

Speaker 2  48:35
if it doesn't cost a lot more to do it that way, I think that would be, yeah, the ideal. But how are we doing? W9 attachments, like, do we have a specific place for those? I think it might be worth a few minutes. Is just one of you shakes chair your screen and we look at a vendor specifically kind of what,

Unknown Speaker  49:01
what going to show there.

Unknown Speaker  49:14
Works again.

Matthias Miller  49:17
So here we have, at least, don't actually have a

Speaker 6  49:20
here. Do

Unknown Speaker  49:24
we have any What were you actually attached to? Very,

Unknown Speaker  49:28
very few.

Matthias Miller  49:34
Make sure there's not something specific for Yeah, we don't have anything specific pretending to be meaning. So my thought was we would add a section.

Unknown Speaker  49:48
Well, do we want

Matthias Miller  49:56
to push these two s3 or not? I.

Speaker 1  50:00
Uh, not going to be an it's not going to be enough to really merit that. I mean, I would, I mean, argue with me. It would seem like a checkbox, a date, and then drop your documents in the document

Unknown Speaker  50:15
archive. So,

Speaker 1  50:17
I mean, that's, that's just my I mean, I don't like, I don't think these are going to you're not going to generate enough traffic on this type of thing to warrant, I think tying up to s3 but

Matthias Miller  50:28
maybe I'm wrong. Do you need more than one w9 on file? No. Okay, so my proposal would be add a button beside uses 10 and 10 and nine for w9 and just be a little memo that you can drop, attach the 10, the w9 to. And then we have a section called certificate of insurance that has an RG of entry date, expiration date. And then another memo. When you select a row, the memo underneath it would pop up for you to drop your drop it into.

Speaker 2  51:03
Good the executive notes and the notes. Is there a reason? Like, could we get rid of the executive notes then and use that for do we need both? Yeah, is it a levels thing?

Matthias Miller  51:16
I mean, executive notes, let's see.

Speaker 3  51:18
Tatum notes is probably going to have data restriction on it. So

Matthias Miller  51:25
executive notes does have information that's only visible to

Unknown Speaker  51:32
good let's, let's leave that as is.

Matthias Miller  51:34
But I'm not sure if that's that might have been by some of these look like that's just accidental. Nobody really like that doesn't look that doesn't look confidential to me.

Speaker 1  51:47
Are those are executive notes and regular notes standard to the contact record? Yes,

Matthias Miller  51:51
I think so, yeah. Now there are a few where we do have both,

Unknown Speaker  51:57
yeah, but I promise you, most likely, most people don't know what the difference is.

Matthias Miller  52:05
Here you get something special with your picture. I mean, like that one includes compensation information, so that might might have been intentional, but 99% of these anyway. So if you ever want to clean it up, cold, rainy day, we could

Unknown Speaker  52:29
never rains in the office.

Matthias Miller  52:34
If it does, you're getting buckets and calling

Unknown Speaker  52:38
more important work.

Unknown Speaker  52:42
Good. I think that proposal is good. What do you

Speaker 5  52:44
think Drew? Yeah, one other use case for it would be, then on the transactions by contact list or report to just have a column that just, you know, notates if the COI, if we have a COI, you know, if that field is checked,

Unknown Speaker  53:07
okay, of entry date expiration.

Speaker 5  53:11
I mean, I guess you could say if it's not overdue, like if it's if today's date is less expiration date.

Speaker 2  53:19
So is your thought you would, you'd select your subcontract account, and basically anything that it's basically the total of this subcontract account, less any that we have insurance, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  53:36
Because this is where I'm gonna,

Speaker 5  53:39
if we don't have the column, I'll pull this and then go look at all the subcontractors and see if we have it for them.

Matthias Miller  53:47
So do we potentially this is the standard report. Standard accounting report. Seems to me like this makes more sense as a subcontractor report.

Unknown Speaker  54:06
Yeah, that would work too.

Speaker 2  54:11
So, but is it literally that it's like, pick these call on the subcontractor report? Are you planning to hard code your account selections you would still,

Speaker 5  54:27
like, here I just go and select the subcontractor accounts,

Matthias Miller  54:33
like the three or five accounts, yeah, yeah. You just want to fill the bank account.

Speaker 5  54:38
That's what I that's what I do for, like, when I would actually be needing that COI information, then I just select the accounts that I want to pull out of, you know, and then it works for that. So I

Matthias Miller  54:51
would have a proposal that we have a COI verification report and folders by accounts, folders by date range, and it shows COI stuff. Status, which is either current, expired

Unknown Speaker  55:06
or missing.

Unknown Speaker  55:08
Okay, is that that would work

Unknown Speaker  55:14
through insight support,

Speaker 1  55:19
yeah, but do you want it as a column that's going to show up on every transaction?

Matthias Miller  55:26
No, it's just a report.

Speaker 1  55:27
Oh, you're sorry. You're That's right, you said you're going to break this out into its own report. Got

Unknown Speaker  55:32
it? Yeah.

Speaker 2  55:39
So do you have the information you need for that report with us?

Speaker 6  55:46
Yes, can mirror the transactions by Yes,

Speaker 2  55:55
I mean, I'm sure you thought of that. But if they have some that are, if we have on that report, if we have a current, if we have a contact with a current COI, then I don't know, we'll want to exclude that, like this first impressions garden center. If they were, then we'd want to, I don't we could create a second column, set of debits and credit credits, and move that over there, or is the number at the bottom is really all you're concerned about. Like you would say, 20,000 in subcontract labor in this in this time period, less the 1500 that have their own insurance, right?

Matthias Miller  56:40
Well, we just let you filter my

Speaker 5  56:42
report. You were talking about Matthias. Was that just going to be a vendor report that just tells us, here's your vendors that have and here's their COI status?

Matthias Miller  56:50
No. I mean, it doesn't, don't, don't, technically have to look at all transactions over date range. And I mean, because first impressions might be insured for their march vendor invoice, but not for their September one. So it has to be by transaction. My proposal is that we add a filter by COI status, a multi select Filter, so you can just maybe

Unknown Speaker  57:17
this is, yeah, that would work. And then

Matthias Miller  57:21
you can, you can run the whole thing, go look through it, make sure it looks sane, and then rerun it and say, Hey, I just want to look at, I just want to see whatever expired or it started missing.

Unknown Speaker  57:39
Good, here. Yep,

Speaker 6  57:44
I'm sending that, sending that out to everybody. Well, not Dwayne, but everybody else.

Unknown Speaker  57:53
Good. And

Speaker 2  57:55
then nine, editable Status column, quick enter of entry invoice. Is there more that's needed on that group?

Speaker 5  58:03
It's, I don't even think there's a stat the Status column at all. They just automatic, they default. They just automatically go to prepaid unverified. So I'd still want prepaid unverified defaulted. But like to be able to put in paid so that they don't come through on their verification reports on stuff that's not that they're not wanting to see.

Matthias Miller  58:32
Basically, we don't have a column for it yet, but we need a column so that you can switch it in. Okay? Mark, just a small nitpick, if you could say something like add editable column to quicken enter render invoice, just to make it clear

Unknown Speaker  58:48
and editable column to quick vendor invoice, quick and quick.

Unknown Speaker  58:54
Yeah, quick enter rendering voice, you

Unknown Speaker  59:03
good,

Unknown Speaker  59:06
anything else?

Matthias Miller  59:08
Well, I think I think if Seth runs out of work, I think 10 and 11 look pretty

Unknown Speaker  59:17
straightforward. I Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  59:25
Good here. Good one.

Speaker 2  59:27
One last question on the size of exclusion of closing transactions, we've still got the dealer commissions. Thing that we was our number two priority on our dev call, which I think the dealer Commission's thing would be a big project again. Can we get to that this year yet?

Matthias Miller  59:57
What's your thought? Is it? Which comes for stealer commissions or retrievals,

Speaker 2  1:00:08
dealer commissions. I think because it, it'd be really nice to have that start, you know, at the first of the year, same as like payroll, you don't want to start that mid year or whatever, but I don't know if that's I have a feeling that one's going to get big and messy when we start looking at at properly handling

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
power port sales. But and

Matthias Miller  1:00:43
I'm also going to say that it depends how compliant each of the districts want to be with their compensation model for everybody,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:55
like the Holy Grail, you can't I mean, you can't touch that. You have to build software. Well, everything?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:02
Well, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:03
that's fine. Reminds me of the payroll module.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
I mean, I would,

Matthias Miller  1:01:14
the way I would look at it is, if we really, really have to,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20
is there a way that we could,

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
could we cut this thing drastically in the scope and give you just enough for what we need to really effectively start on The new year and then, and then be able to add on to it. And I don't know how to answer that without really digging through what we have. I think it's basically what we do is we would have Dwayne start recording commission payments

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01
in assist,

Matthias Miller  1:02:04
but then even that we could back Enter,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
that's, it's obnoxious.

Speaker 2  1:02:16
Well, we're just, we're trying to make some decisions on like, what, what are for 2025 what should be? You know, what do we want to do with software development, 2025 and

Speaker 2  1:02:36
there's no short, quick answers on that, as far as like if, if we drastically cut scope, how would that look? That's,

Matthias Miller  1:02:55
I'm not even sure. So here's the way I'm looking at it, even if Seth gets done with with, Okay, we got Thanksgiving, so realistically, we're not planning on on the closing transactions being done much before the sixth. And that leaves maybe a week or two to go implement dealer commissions. I mean, Seth is good, but it's not that good. There's nobody that good. What

Speaker 2  1:03:27
if we said on, I mean, like when we get the initial decide, were we saying three to four weeks? Is that kind of

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
I don't even remember.

Speaker 3  1:03:40
I mean, I'm not gonna be working that much from about, I mean, I'll be working some, but not for it wouldn't be good to have a project like this from like the 20th to the eighth of January, or something with Christmas, and then I'm, we're going to Bangladesh.

Matthias Miller  1:03:58
So I'm going to guess, by the time we deal with all the fallout, and especially if we actually implement this thing, we're looking at easily, looking at added to probably three month timeline before we get all this stuff wrapped up. That doesn't mean that, once we get implementation, that we don't have that set doesn't have capacity for other stuff, but there's going to be things like, we got to run payroll this week, and we don't have this one thing that we wanted to talk about that we need. So it's it is not realistic to get done before the end of the year. No,

Speaker 2  1:04:36
that that's that case is the to be realistic, we're looking at like a two to three month project.

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
Yeah, with, with one of those months, probably parallel with something else, or month, month and a half parallel some something else. There's still. Development that can happen. But I would guess it's a month of roughly a month of initial development, and then a month or two of testing and revisions and tweaking and changing, and we meant this not that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16
good, I guess is what we need. So. Good,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:18
good, good.

Matthias Miller  1:05:22
Awesome. Well, have a happy Thanksgiving.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
Yes, yeah, all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:27
thank you. Bye.
