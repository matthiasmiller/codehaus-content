Just the fact that you've already had that argument. How do you relate? I'm a Christian. I love Jesus. Okay. So, Matthias here's the beauty. And, and, and the blocks are always up here, okay? We're not going to argue doctrine, okay, but I'm just gonna I'm just gonna put on the table the theory that the kingdom is already here. We're not We're not waiting for some moment. We are it is now so when you guys get to the position when the lawyer releases the resources, you already got a leg up on not meeting the reward. Okay, I've been to Africa. And I have I have felt the temptation that the kids are so poor, I remember when I would go into the store. And you could buy these. They were they were actually technically the theme pads for school back in the day in the 80s that cost five shillings. And when we gave those to the kids it was it was such an incredibly awkward, heartbreaking moments. Because at that time, it was 20 shillings to the dollar. So you figure that's what five cents. So these were the equivalent of about a penny and American penny a penny a penny, the penny that we drop on the ground and don't even care and these kids embraced it. So you guys have already overcome the temptation to feel like you're the big supplier and you're not all you are is the conduit. You're not the supplier you're the conduit, the see you guys have already got that down and I really do think that's going to bless them. I really there is no reason I should have known that. There's not none whatsoever. And I could have drawn a blank and had I would have honestly told you because I'm comfortable with who I am. I don't have to make anything up. that would that would be my right to make it up to fabricate it. But there's a reason there's a reason that God let me know that something that touches chambers in your heart that nobody else has ever touched. That was the price of admission right there. Can I get a high five
