I just realized that when I am trying to get something done and I hit a roadblock that it's often fear and one of the responses that I have out of fear is the plan.

Unknown Speaker  00:20
And if the plan is too simple and I still fear it I complicated

Unknown Speaker  00:26
so oftentimes in the places where I'm trying to plan I'm actually afraid in the places where I'm trying to plan and am unable to plan I'm unable to plan because

Unknown Speaker  00:40
because the

Unknown Speaker  00:40
plan would actually give me clarity

Unknown Speaker  00:45
and I can't have clarity because clarity will force me out of fear.
