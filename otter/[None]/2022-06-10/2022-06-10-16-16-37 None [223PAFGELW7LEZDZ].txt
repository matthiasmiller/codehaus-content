So one of the things that this also means is that if you want to experience the efficiency gain, then you can actually calculate your estimated efficiency gain based on the number of categories that you're creating. So if the only thing you do is you create it so if it's if email is 9010, which I suspect it is, and you divide it in half, then you're going to have a x percent increase in, in performance and and if you create it into five categories, and and then that actually allows you to spend less time on the most important pieces and allow other things to fall through the cracks. I think the question is, what really, really, really needs to be done, and certainly, but certainly what ends up happening is that you have a greater guarantee of actually doing the things that really drive value. And and so, you know, 50% if you split it in half then then then if you if you throw if you throw a rock, what's the likelihood that you're going to hit something that's high value, but if you divided into five categories, and then then you know that you're practically guaranteed that you're going to be working on some of the highest value stuff when you're when you're working on those things.
