Unknown Speaker  07:50
You, bro,

Unknown Speaker  07:51
yo, how you doing?

Unknown Speaker  07:55
Good, good. How are you?

Speaker 1  07:56
Hey, I should put it up on the big screen. Maybe. Yes. Hold on, sorry, Matt, yes, sir, yes, sir.

Speaker 2  08:05
Got it, yep. Cool. All right. Well, plan it soon like I'm just with Matthias here. Do you have any questions about the program? All right,

Speaker 1  08:22
here we go, sharing. Oh, if we need share or not, but I'm Anyway, okay, um, I can hear you fine. So I guess I'll stick to current situation. I don't think we even tried that base yet?

Speaker 2  08:42
Well, we get to that whenever you want.

Matthias Miller  08:49
Well, do you have stuff on your list? I've got a bunch of stuff we can run through too

Speaker 1  08:53
anything. I don't, personally, I was off yesterday trying

Unknown Speaker  09:00
to think, I don't.

Speaker 1  09:04
I can't even remember our last conversation at this moment. Um, but just that, George is asking about the the boxes for sewing, schedule,

Unknown Speaker  09:20
song, tracking, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:22
I've been Yes,

Matthias Miller  09:25
I Well, that's I can, I can add that to the schedule. Then we need to talk a little bit about some of the changes that are going to be required to start inputting that.

Speaker 1  09:35
Yeah, so when adding it to the schedule, and do you also have to create another page for him to input? Is that right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:49
The basic issue is that currently in the sewing schedule, we're grouping items together based on dimensions, miscellaneous prep and. Customer, is there anything else, and due date, and so that's how it gets printed, okay? And that's how we're going to ask them to log their time for each of those. You know, if we have, if we have the, if we have the same thing for different customers, then, which rarely would happen, but they'd have to track their time separately. If we've got different miscellaneous prep, those get tracked separately. But basically what we want, what we end up needing, probably in my what makes my life easiest is if the work order almost exactly represents what gets printed out, or exactly represents what does get printed out.

Speaker 1  10:51
Sure, and that, yeah, where he would basically do exactly what the guys out there are doing, except he would do it on the digital copy. Yep. That'd be fine. Yeah, I don't think it, yeah, that sounds actually very simple.

Matthias Miller  11:14
Yeah, it's gonna take some a little bit of rework. I don't think it's, it's, it's not great, but it's not awful. I think it's the right thing to do the other thing. Then, as far as being able to print off multiple schedules, and this might be a question for him, if we can do this, but if we could have, if we could, I if we could schedule items for a specific date. So I don't know if this works for things like the brewer, where he's got builds multiple cut lists, but say, do we want to schedule this stuff for the I don't know what I'm not in front of my you know, the 18th, and this one for the 19th, and these for the 20th. And then he could print those off separately and go back and deal with it that way. But we need, we need a way for him to be able to do those, do multiple ones ahead of time

Speaker 1  12:27
for him to generate multiple schedules ahead of time.

Matthias Miller  12:31
Yes, currently he's marking them out as complete so that he can go create a new one.

Speaker 1  12:37
Oh, wait on a song, on his, on his,

Matthias Miller  12:42
on the brewer. I think it's the brewer, something like that,

Unknown Speaker  12:48
really. And he, yeah, but they,

Speaker 1  12:52
he'll print off a couple pages. But I mean, when you say complete,

Matthias Miller  12:57
I thought he does. I thought he I was thinking in one of these, he prints off a page at a time or something.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  13:12
So we gotta, we gotta get, we gotta get that ironed out with him at some point.

Unknown Speaker  13:16
Well, yeah, see if he's over here.

Unknown Speaker  13:38
Oh, I think he just, think he just ran it

Unknown Speaker  13:41
ran out for something, but I didn't,

Speaker 1  13:50
yeah, that does, I don't understand. I mean, yeah, I don't understand that because I thought that he was able to well print off multiple pages, for sure. Are you talking about the sewing schedule? It's like the, not the actual, the sewing schedule itself, day after day, maybe, like he'll do it a day's schedule, maybe, and then before he prints off

Matthias Miller  14:19
another one. Maybe that is what it is. I don't know. He marks

Speaker 1  14:24
complete everything that was done, then he'll go back and redo it for tomorrow type of thing.

Matthias Miller  14:30
It's, it's something where he's doing multiple multiples ahead of time,

Speaker 2  14:36
multiple Okay, yeah, okay. I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  14:44
Well, so,

Speaker 1  14:49
yeah, he was just asking about it. So I mean, probably work best for you to got you and George to you.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Work that out. I can get with him.

Speaker 1  15:04
And okay, I'll let him know he was asking. So, yeah, last set.

Unknown Speaker  15:18
No, otherwise we were Yeah, price. We were on the pricing.

Matthias Miller  15:24
And so one question I had on the pricing thing, I didn't have a to have a chance to put in the silver loom, but I did come up with a pricing model that gets us a lot closer. But one of the questions is, do we know for sure that we've got all the fasteners put in for all the items?

Speaker 1  15:46
I don't know of any fasteners that we are using or have used recently that are not in that system? Okay? We just did a create with a door. So we I added hinges and clasp classes like the latch part. I had a hinges in class for that crate. Otherwise, I'm not aware of any. I would need to. That's a anyway, George, question, so I mean, I don't, I think, you I don't think I wouldn't expect him to say, oh, yeah, we're using those. But I didn't think it mattered. I just called it this or that or whatever. No, he wouldn't say that. So no,

Matthias Miller  16:37
so I added a few more factors, which is, what's the longest board length? What's the widest board length? What's the thickest board, excuse me, as well as some complexities, such as number of fasteners per part, number of parts per board foot as a measurement of complexity. And it takes it up to about here. Let me see if this is it. Median error is six to eight minutes per item. So now on a on a large order that comes out fairly dramatically, like that's that could be up

Matthias Miller  17:29
to anyway, that's, that's, that's a lot,

Unknown Speaker  17:33
is that six to eight minutes per item,

Matthias Miller  17:38
that's, that's the, that's how on, that's the that's how, how far off they are, generally across the board, either above or below. Oh,

Speaker 1  17:57
okay, based on the data that we've collected, yep against your formula, yep.

Matthias Miller  18:08
So the biggest one is off by 7x okay, so one of the things I did to normalize it was, let's look at the median order quantity. So what was the median size of the order, and also what was the median time per item, in hopes that that excludes some of the craziest typos as a as a part of that Yeah, but it's and it it means that we got, I mean, it definitely got better, but it's still Not out of 700 items we still have.

Matthias Miller  19:02
We still have over 100 that are off by 100% or more.

Unknown Speaker  19:12
We have.

Speaker 1  19:14
Are we talking? Matt, sorry, but clarify. We're only focusing on assembly expected, assembly time correct. It's not it's not pricing, it's not scoring, it's just assembly time

Matthias Miller  19:33
that is correct

Speaker 1  19:34
and being off by 100% Yeah, that's a little scary, but oh, she's Wow.

Matthias Miller  19:43
But like, how do we I don't know how to dial like, I don't know what the factors are at this point. I mean, if we have more factors, we can throw at it well, or we can start looking at the worst ones.

Speaker 1  19:54
Can I see it somehow? Or I need a visual what the fact? What are the. Factors that you've yeah factor and I could pretty quickly identify any glaring missing ones.

Matthias Miller  20:16
Pretty sure. Okay, I'm going to send this to you in a guy in the chat, and you can pull it up. Okay,

Speaker 1  20:36
sorry, I go little chat bot in the bottom there. Yeah, click at,

Matthias Miller  20:45
yep, click. I'm sorry. Not that one. There's a it's on the zoom window somewhere. I can email it to you too, if it's easier. Actually, hang on. You can't pull this up. Actually, yeah, you should be able to pull

Unknown Speaker  21:05
it up. I'll see. Let me. Let me email it.

Unknown Speaker  21:09
We'll see anything else.

Matthias Miller  21:22
Sorry, okay, give it. Give it about 20 seconds. Should be in your email. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  22:12
is milk. Method came through

Unknown Speaker  22:21
items for pricing analysis,

Matthias Miller  22:23
yep, okay, some of these just straight up, shouldn't be in here. Can

Speaker 1  22:29
you see my screen? Yep, okay, ah. Can I shrink some of these boxes? Yeah, yeah. Median, ship, median, assembly time, median, total, median, does that mean average or the middle? It's the most sense.

Matthias Miller  22:54
It's the it's the middle or the average of the middle. If there's two middle,

Speaker 1  22:59
wait, layers of random, okay, max length, Max thickness, Got it, max width,

Speaker 3  23:12
four feet. Parts, parts, now, fastener. Fasteners, screws. Now this

Unknown Speaker  23:41
guy's trying to call me again. Shoot

Speaker 1  23:51
that wrong. Let's see. I'm trying to get it all together here. Sorry. So good.

Speaker 1  24:12
Was this all fasteners out here now? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:21
Torx, angle, okay, all right, gotcha. So

Unknown Speaker  24:32
we're saying the difficult, the difficulty,

Matthias Miller  24:39
it's it's a combination of layers of random, max length, Max thickness, max width, board feet, parts, and then the specific and each fastener has its own.

Speaker 1  24:51
Well, how's comes random is in this just.

Matthias Miller  25:00
It in, I don't know. I must, it doesn't, because the fasteners would increase. So,

Speaker 1  25:07
yeah, are there? Well, this is difficulty measure. Are there equal? Is there equal weights on all of this

Matthias Miller  25:15
stuff? No, okay, it's all different weights based on what gets us the closest to what we think happened in the past. Yeah,

Speaker 1  25:26
well, did it get in your estimation? Did it get better when you added, yeah, medians and length, thickness, width, I think so yeah, got a little bit better.

Unknown Speaker  25:44
It did. What are

Speaker 1  25:49
we what? What are some of those outliers? Then of 100% sure.

Matthias Miller  25:56
So let me go. Gonna have to sort these out. So one is the NH 7270,

Speaker 1  26:07
okay, so what you're saying, then, is that actual? NH, what do you say? NH, 270 Yeah, let me open another page here,

Matthias Miller  26:23
like we we predicted Something like 260 and it's actually 50 minutes each guy.

Speaker 1  26:49
Did you say 70270? Yeah. Okay, that's a very common one that we do a lot of, which is the 48 by 32 palette,

Speaker 1  27:09
what is your so? So 100% off in which, which component,

Matthias Miller  27:13
well it would have it predicted. This model predicted it to take five times longer than it does.

Unknown Speaker  27:20
Yeah, based on board footage.

Matthias Miller  27:30
But these are also repairs. It looks like well

Speaker 1  27:34
or no, why? I don't know why that's in there, Matt, I don't. Oh, my, was that in there? I don't think it should be. I mean, we make these new this is the item code that we use, okay, this is a non heat treated the other item code is the heat treated one. It's a stock it's a stock item,

Unknown Speaker  28:01
huh? Okay, so, oh, man, that stumps

Speaker 1  28:12
we set up when we mass produce these things. That's the only

Matthias Miller  28:17
like if you go to the assembly analysis, I mean not unless I have something wrong in my calculations. I'm not, you know me. I'm not beyond that. No.

Speaker 1  28:26
But the reality is, Matt, this guy here, it's, it's flush, it's got a block that's got it. The runner is made up of inch and a half by three and a half 48 flat, not a two by four, but inching up a three and a half inch and up a three and a half by 48 flat with nailed fast into three blocks which are flush on the end, flush on the sides. Two blocks are flush on the end, the other one centered flush on the sides. Flip it over. Then you attach this 13/16, by three and a half by 48 that's flush on all four sides. So you're throwing these nails into it pretty fast. And after you then you take eight, one by 630s, one on the corners, one flush on each end, both sides, and then fill in the it's almost like a solid top. You got a little bit of wiggle room with the dimensions. You throw the six in the middle and bump and flush on the sides. And, I mean, you can it's just a quick method. Man, it's an easy they're easy to make. One thing about them is the runners are wider. So we're nailing into a three and a half inch wide runner versus a. An inch and a 16th inch and 516, inch and seven thick, runner, wide, however you want to say it like so it's easier to hit that three and a half inch mark than a inch and 516, for example. I mean, Nick, you can buzz through these guys. It doesn't make them more it doesn't necessarily make them less valuable because of all the material that's in them well, but

Matthias Miller  30:36
the assembly time, but again, if you're looking at Fair, fair market value, or whatever you want to call it, there's more material value, but there's less assembly time.

Speaker 1  30:45
Yeah, and we're not talking about, right? But I Okay, so maybe because what you're what we're talking about is a 48 by 30. Surface overall, 48 inches by 30 with two stringers. So it's a small table. These two guys are working closely together. Everything's flush is one part that makes it easier, but the small surface area overall makes it easier as well. In other words, you don't have to walk back and forth to go get your goodies. You don't have to, um, so it's it's more board footage in a smaller cubic space.

Unknown Speaker  31:47
Yeah, so yeah, with it so, so the more fast,

Speaker 1  31:57
the more faster, as you do in a smaller space, the easier it gets potentially

Matthias Miller  32:03
like but we don't. We don't have a measure, I mean, the longest board, board dimensions, maybe as close as we get, but we don't have a good way to 100%

Unknown Speaker  32:21
Matt, I can't So,

Matthias Miller  32:23
oh, this is no, it's, it's more like 5x No, hang on, this one is this one's like 4x

Speaker 1  32:35
They're doing it four times faster than expected.

Matthias Miller  32:40
Yeah. Yeah, five times faster, sorry, five times faster.

Unknown Speaker  32:56
That's they're not, but they don't make these well.

Speaker 1  33:16
I So Matt, there's too much I think there's too much value being placed.

Speaker 1  33:39
Maybe last tough one. I mean, because you have 100 fasteners, you might do a small crate with 100 fasteners, gonna take way longer, just because it's much more complex, much more nuanced. Not saying that it should take longer if you did 100 of them. But this is just a frequent flyer that it's a lot of lumber. And there's another factor here that I need to look at real quick.

Unknown Speaker  34:16
If you look at

Unknown Speaker  34:22
nh 70270, bam, bam, continue.

Speaker 1  34:31
Historical quantity assembled, 3001 43 we needed 2734,

Matthias Miller  34:41
that is actually that's interesting, because if you do it based on order size, not assembly quantity, because there's stock we are doing average. Order size. Median order size is seven.

Speaker 1  35:03
Oh, so when we set up and do them, we're at, we're not doing just seven, mostly not. I mean, if you Right, yeah, can you do median assembled amount out of here? Yeah, although some of these knee cleaned up there.

Matthias Miller  35:22
Well, I mean, but again, the hope with median is that gets us pretty close.

Speaker 1  35:28
This is one of the most inaccurate. This thing screwed up that it, I mean, here you got eight hours and seven assembled. That's way off two and a half hours. One, eight and a half hours three, what he got here? Seven hours four. It's way screwed up. He got them butchered. Rest of the numbers. Look close. Oh, la, la.

Unknown Speaker  36:01
Oh, nice needs cleaned up all of this right here.

Speaker 1  36:14
I mean, he lost information, and these are ones where they did runner blocks and and he was saying he didn't do these pluses over here, or, yeah, wait, Amanda did that so it this information is goofy.

Unknown Speaker  36:30
Anyway, shoot,

Matthias Miller  36:33
I don't see. I wonder. I wonder if some of these that are off

Unknown Speaker  36:40
are okay,

Matthias Miller  36:44
I wonder if some of them are. Well, what else that explains that one? There's another major Well, some of these are actually calculating like they should be negative, which I don't know exactly how to handle that.

Unknown Speaker  36:59
What do you mean they should be negative,

Matthias Miller  37:02
like the predicted minutes. It falls so far outside of the scope of like, it doesn't fit the mold that it estimating a negative assembly time, which obviously doesn't make sense. But one of those is, let me find

Unknown Speaker  37:32
it.

Matthias Miller  37:39
Hang on the ARSP 46 by 44

Unknown Speaker  37:43
Yeah, these guys are some of this. We didn't even have

Unknown Speaker  37:50
46 by 44

Matthias Miller  37:51
Yeah, but we only have one. We don't have a lot of data on it.

Unknown Speaker  38:01
10 needed 10 assembled. Excuse me,

Speaker 1  38:16
yeah, because it's a sample palette. They're small. It's just a little itty bitty. I mean, it's a machine palette. For whatever reason, they get these special orders, and they they order these things for that to accommodate these orders.

Unknown Speaker  38:45
What's it so are sorry?

Matthias Miller  38:47
Are all of the SP sample palettes?

Speaker 1  38:51
Armstrong, yeah, shouldn't we flag? Sorry? No, no, they're not. Forgive me. Forgive me, man, I'm Armstrong specials. They're not. They're all the Armstrong specials. The data is like it, we almost ought to throw it out like for real. The guy, they're not gonna if they do Armstrong specials too often. They they're not making incentive like, they're just not they're these things are

Matthias Miller  39:28
they're just weird. One Eye, oh, they're

Speaker 1  39:30
not weird. They're just, or, I don't know he they, they should make it look easier than like,

Matthias Miller  39:41
Okay, what about the MX 33

Matthias Miller  39:58
one? So that's just a low quantity. That's probably

Unknown Speaker  40:07
where is,

Speaker 1  40:11
Yeah, how'd I get to the item? Can't I get to the item data from this window?

Matthias Miller  40:19
Yeah, you should be able to hit the ellipsis on there. No, actually, you could do it. You go into this view sales order, and you could pop into there from there and click the item code.

Unknown Speaker  40:36
There you go. Wow.

Unknown Speaker  40:40
144 by 50, okay, half by 40 by 53.6, that's not exactly right, but it's okay. Um,

Speaker 1  41:07
anyway, what? What it's it's showing, I'm not with you, sorry. It, what's it showing, Matt,

Matthias Miller  41:18
it's showing, it's expecting it to take four to five times longer than it actually does.

Matthias Miller  41:39
But again, we don't have that much data on it. Did they really? No, no. Look at this seven times 30 minutes, two guys. I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 1  41:56
Is that because, yeah, because they they started, I don't know, somebody said, I mean, this, this is so, okay, this is simple hair. It's, it's three runners. Set them on your wherever table. Put a piece of fasten a corner board, fasten an end board, one on each end, maybe a couple other ones. Square it up, spread out the random across the top, and bombs away, nil. They nail away and fast, at random. And then it's, what did it say? 200 some fasteners. And I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's simple, there's, there's this, it's, it's, it's simple. In in most of its

Unknown Speaker  42:54
it's, it's simple, it's more simple.

Matthias Miller  42:56
But we don't have a way to quantify that in the item data,

Unknown Speaker  43:00
solid, solid top is easier for these guys

Unknown Speaker  43:10
some, sometimes.

Matthias Miller  43:14
So would it be? Would it be something like, what's the biggest square footage, or what's the what's the largest square footage? Item like the 40 by 50 has

Unknown Speaker  43:34
what Say? Say it again.

Matthias Miller  43:39
What is the largest square footage, piece of lumber, not by surface area.

Speaker 1  43:59
Your calculation is showing that it should take

Unknown Speaker  44:04
longer, right?

Speaker 1  44:07
Based on average numbers across the universe of stressor power company, it should this should take longer. Well, is that because there's 30 minutes of setup time, and it took them less than the setup time. Is that? Well,

Matthias Miller  44:25
it would take 15 I think so time doesn't set up. Time get divided. Set up. Time gets divvied out. So they would have had

Speaker 1  44:31
15 minutes setup time each. Yes, nine minutes, nine minutes to assemble it. Do

Matthias Miller  44:46
you think that's accurate?

Speaker 1  44:52
Well, I'm saying it's nine plus the 15, but the setup times way less than that on this, on a guy like this. I mean, if the forklift.

Matthias Miller  45:00
Yeah. So the other way to do this would be, let's include setup time in our estimates.

Unknown Speaker  45:17
Estimate as far as

Matthias Miller  45:19
let's look at total clock time,

Unknown Speaker  45:23
okay, okay, and

Matthias Miller  45:33
see if that gets us any closer, and see if that normalizes a little bit for

Speaker 1  45:37
in that case, yeah, but then you're going to have to divide, divide out the like, the larger the quantity, the easier.

Matthias Miller  45:51
Oh, we already do that. There's already efficiency gains based on quantity,

Speaker 1  45:58
all right, so just include a setup time to,

Speaker 1  46:06
yeah, that's the thing with them. Armstrong specials, there's a lot of setup time In those.

Unknown Speaker  46:19
So then we would want to

Speaker 3  46:20
median,

Unknown Speaker  46:59
So then we would do recorder assembly time.

Unknown Speaker  47:37
Wait a minute. I

Matthias Miller  48:31
i am doing it off of assembly time. I goofed on that. No, it's not assembly time for

Matthias Miller  49:18
it is based on this, and I think we had a conversation about it, but we had a conversation about including the setup time. Okay, I don't, I don't know way, way back, but anyway, bottom line is that does include the setup time.

Unknown Speaker  49:41
Another one,

Speaker 1  49:44
and that one I should have taken longer.

Matthias Miller  49:47
We would have expected it to take longer.

Speaker 1  49:52
Yeah, so what does that mean? In your opinion, Matt, like it because.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
Most products of similar

Speaker 1  50:05
amount of fasteners, overall length, board footage,

Matthias Miller  50:17
oh, man, we don't have a, I mean, in my mind, there's, I don't know what all to peg it on, but there's two pieces that we're missing. One is, what is the actual finished dimensions? Because that has an impact, or maybe that's most of what it is, what is the actual finished size of the palette, and that would then differentiate between pallets and crates as well. Although you would get some, you would get that with some, with with board footage.

Matthias Miller  51:00
But it would differentiate between huge, you know, ones that are all accessible, and ones that you got to run around for. So,

Speaker 1  51:18
like, I guess you could say the it was a lot of board feet, and it was minimal amount of parts. I mean, minimal. It was three

Unknown Speaker  51:31
lot of board feet, minimal amount of parts, lot of fasteners, only three parts, lot of boards, a lot of board feet and a lot of fasteners with very little amount of parts.

Matthias Miller  51:48
So board feet per part. And I thought, I thought it ran, let me see if it, if that actually did, for sure, get included in this per

Unknown Speaker  51:57
part. And I

Unknown Speaker  52:06
Yeah, board feet per part is a factor pretty big.

Matthias Miller  52:16
Does faster per part or,

Unknown Speaker  52:22
I mean, you can't how you it's,

Unknown Speaker  52:26
I mean, it could be, I mean,

Matthias Miller  52:30
yeah, does the largest surface area matter? Not necessarily, I

Unknown Speaker  52:39
don't know,

Matthias Miller  52:42
but the finished palette size would, wouldn't it

Unknown Speaker  52:47
mean, yeah,

Speaker 1  52:52
yeah. But if it, if it would have wings, it'd be a lot harder. If it would have sure different sizes, top and bottom, it would be harder. I mean,

Matthias Miller  53:04
that's almost where you have to start labeling the the lumber for what it's used for.

Speaker 1  53:16
I mean, the more, the more fasteners per part, and the more board footage per part

Speaker 1  53:30
makes it easier. I mean less parts to whatever sort your pieces out of three piles of material. You got a whole bunch of board footage, you got a whole bunch of fasteners, and you got three piles of lumber, and everything's flush.

Unknown Speaker  53:54
I mean, that makes it, yeah. Do you

Matthias Miller  53:59
mean the types of fasteners, or the total number of fasteners,

Speaker 1  54:02
these are hand nails, right? So it's hand nails, right? That's before easier. I mean, it's taking that into consideration in it. Yeah, okay, why? Why? What is telling? What is what is it off there? Saying, wait a minute, because of that right there, it should take longer. What is that? Is it fat amount of amount of fasters. I

Matthias Miller  54:44
Yeah, it's the amount of each kind of fastener.

Unknown Speaker  54:58
Well, the random.

Speaker 1  55:01
This is a random top when you're doing random that is much easier to install and fasten on a board foot by board foot

Unknown Speaker  55:18
flow, then

Speaker 1  55:21
everything else needs spaced. Normally, right spaced or held to the edge. But once you get them end pieces and fasten on a random on a random top, they'll spread the random out, smash it up against one end or the other, and just pop up, pop up, pop up. And then when they get down to that last piece that flying one in the pile that fits in there, and they put it down, and then he, one guy will go first, and he'll make everything flush on his end, and he'll kneel, and the other guy's like, whatever. I mean, all the way down the line.

Speaker 2  55:58
So once you Yeah, random width simplifies the it

Speaker 1  56:07
simplifies the process of many fasteners. In other words, random makes it easier the more footage that comes out at random, the easier the job is. If that took, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  56:32
for sure, that's a big one there,

Matthias Miller  56:37
and that that gave me, that was one of the factors I added, that gave a, I don't know how much of a boost, but that did give just including the layers of random. Did include

Speaker 1  56:49
a boost board feet of board feet of random, instead of layers of random.

Matthias Miller  56:57
We could, yeah, we could,

Speaker 1  57:00
because that would be a better gage of, yeah, because layers is kind of irrelevant to the different sizes, but the percentage that's random is is relevant to the difficulty factor, right?

Matthias Miller  57:32
Do we know for sure that most of the random is, I mean, I'm only seeing a handful of random in here, yeah, so that that would also throw things off. If that's not in there, say, I if we're not, okay, if I go back to the item search, and I search for RW in the raw materials, we still have a bunch of items where it says RW in the raw materials, but it's not marked as random,

Speaker 1  58:10
and that's because they're taking like there's items we're taking. We're using the random width lumber from the yard. But we're, we're running it through the the planer, pen, do Ripper, planner. What do we call that thing? Edger. And do edger, yeah, calling anyway. And we're, we're shaving three and a halfs and five and a halfs out of the random so the yield is three and a half and five and a half.

Matthias Miller  58:45
Yeah. But some of these we have, we have, like, a seven, eight by 40 by 48 Okay, coming out of random width, yeah. I mean, there's stuff like that. That's not

Matthias Miller  59:02
an another one, one by 40 by 48 coming out of random width.

Unknown Speaker  59:06
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  59:23
So if the yield, I

Matthias Miller  59:29
mean, there's a lot of these looks like, but if the So, if the yields Not, not three and a half or five and a half, then it's probably, probably needs to be switched over to you.

Unknown Speaker  59:48
To being random, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2  59:55
like, like a product you're saying.

Matthias Miller  1:00:00
If you have a piece of lumber where the yield is not three and a half or five and a half, right, and it's coming out of random, then it's producing random, yes, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Matthias Miller  1:00:16
Well, I mean, we have just, we haven't gone through and updated the random width and all the check I mean, the random with check boxes and all this stuff yet, all right, in my opinion. And so that's going to, if it genuinely makes a big difference in production time, that's going to throw it off as well. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:00:38
So does that mean we need, we need to go through there and take care of that. Well, I

Matthias Miller  1:00:45
don't know how much of an impact it makes, but

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:16
I mean, does it? Are we? Is this helping

Matthias Miller  1:01:22
solve Well, I think, I think the biggest thing that we could easily add

Matthias Miller  1:01:41
is maybe differentiating Between crates versus palettes and doing a finished final dimensions.

Matthias Miller  1:02:14
I mean, you're inherently going to have more complexity. I mean, you are going to have more board footage, but board foot by board foot, you're going to have more complexity of crate than you are in a

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
right palette. Well, we weren't able, we're not able to,

Speaker 1  1:02:33
we're not able to discern the cube size of the finish besides the finished product, right? Our current data, right?

Matthias Miller  1:02:49
There's a lot, there's a lot of them that have some kind of dimensions in them, right?

Speaker 1  1:02:58
Crates typically do have a three, 3x or 2x

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
description, yep. I

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
mean, there's a lot that's 2x or 3x

Speaker 1  1:03:13
I mean, that's, I don't know any crates that don't have a 2x description. When I say 2x i guess I'm referring to 2x between three numbers, right? Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:03:39
So could we okay? But then we also have cases where,

Speaker 1  1:03:47
yeah, it Yeah. Well, you're, were these outliers? Still outliers before you added the other stuff?

Matthias Miller  1:04:03
Adding the other stuff narrowed it down, for sure.

Speaker 1  1:04:09
So we just need to narrow down more. Or are we saying? What are we?

Matthias Miller  1:04:13
I would think, in my mind, go ahead,

Speaker 1  1:04:16
no. Well, something like the 70270 that we looked at, or the Armstrong specials, for that one, MX 10, with a whole bunch of random and very simple to put together. Shoot, yeah, man, that thing should take five to 10 minutes period. Get the lumber, set it out there. I mean 10 minutes the whole thing, I'm set up and everything for one like setup time, barely any whatever, 1015, minutes total. I mean, took them 24 anyway, these outliers so far that we're finding or legit out, like, is it okay for them to remain outliers?

Matthias Miller  1:04:59
I. I think, yeah. I think the question is, how much human judgment Do you want to involve in this?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
And, yeah, good question. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:05:17
And, and also, if we would put a floor on this to say, no matter what the math says, nobody can ever assemble assemble a palette in less than whatever the number is, five minutes, 10 minutes. I don't know what the number is that would that would help some of the outliers, just because these are so efficient that

Speaker 2  1:05:49
but that one should have took longer because of all the fasteners in it, right? Matt, am I right and because of the more footage.

Matthias Miller  1:05:59
But if it's a, if it's a highly debt, but okay, density matters a lot, right? Board footage is the total material, but density has an inverse relationship, and I think that's where, if I if I could pick and choose, if there's any way that we could, if we could group items based on palette, crate board, bundle blocks, whatever, whatever these things are, if we could categorize them that way, and we could, we could put some kind of finished dimensions on it,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
Right, right.

Matthias Miller  1:06:38
I would think that's a huge lift relative to the effort to do it.

Speaker 2  1:06:46
We should set we. Okay. Are we? Are we? Is it

Speaker 1  1:06:54
easy enough to categor to come up with some categories? Yeah, okay, let's do that. We have to do that.

Matthias Miller  1:07:02
So pull up the items list, ones, IV category, yeah, I, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:07:09
I'm the wrong. Where am I at? Oh, this is your I'm on the wait, no, I'm not.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:16
Anyway, here, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:07:21
Okay, yeah, all good. So let's just go in here and start going through the descriptions and come up with some categories. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:35
don't know what all these I mean, there's lumber,

Matthias Miller  1:07:37
nope. Like, actually run it, and then you can go into the description,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:42
hang on when you Oh, okay, I'm sorry, gotcha.

Matthias Miller  1:07:48
And you can just start going through, down, through here, like, what's this? What's this gate with? I'm gonna assume these are just pallets and crates, but what's this gate? AND gate with? Fly, I

Speaker 1  1:08:01
wish I could say man, 84 handset, fasteners. I have to ask everything. Everything else here is pallets. The 1x is a palette. The 2x is a crate bot. Bottom line, it's a palette or skin. We're going to call it a palette, or it's a or it's a top, or it's a, whatever it is. So it's a want 1x 2x c gate is one. We have to manually unpack that. Everything else, 1x 2x now here, that's lumber. So forget lumber, right? So we said, Right? Lumber, lumber, lumber. 1x there's a crate. 2x one two, whether it's a top or whatever it is, it's a 1x it's a it's a frame, it's a palette, it's a it's that. It's not create. Here's a frame. I'm gonna call this like, I want to put this in a patent, the category of shipping. No, it's a palette support. It's kind of like a bundle block. It does its own unique thing. It's not a pal, it's not a crate. It's a

Speaker 1  1:09:32
it's a frame man. It's like, you know, it's something that you whatever it is. It's a shipping part. Is what it kind of is the shipping part. I've called it that. I tell people, we do pallets and crates and shipping parts, because bundle blocks and, you know, T supports and all these things, man, those are, there's a cap, like, that's a shipping part, whatever that is, you. Unless it's not assembled.

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
Maybe it's not so would you want? Would you want caps and bundle blocks just to go under shipping part

Speaker 1  1:10:09
here ati 30, that's lumber. 340 that's lumber. Say it again. Matt, yeah, shipping parts, sure. Bundle, bundle blocks. We'll just throw it in there. Bundle blocks. What was that other 1p? Seek, bundle blocks, gates, caps, because I haven't seen anything different, other than at this point, support, anything. It's a support or a cap, bi directional palette, 40 by 30, whatever with that's basically a crate lumber.

Speaker 1  1:11:05
This burger one. This is a bunny trail a tiny bit, but this 48 by 4232 that means the top has a five inch wing. On each side, the bottom is flush. Runners are 32 inches apart, or 32 inches outside to outside. So that's a little funky. This 122 120 by 36 that's because the runners are 120 the deck boards, the lead boards, hang out over the end. So it essentially now I think they call that a one. So 124 two inch wing nail. I think they're doing it's a little weird, but they're trying to make the pallets longer without adding runners, without adding dimension to the runner, because the runner's coming out of a 10 footer. Go figure. 120 so if we make the runner 124 now we got to pay the, you know, company for a 13 or a 14 footer. So instead of doing that, they're just hanging the heading board out over the edge. Long to all to say, makes it a little harder. It's another wing. Wings make a difference. Flush makes it easier, right? That's something that we

Matthias Miller  1:12:30
so, is there what? What's a good way to represent this? When we, if we want to put in the finished dimensions, do we say includes, you know, you know, wing none, yeah, yeah, likewise, and, or what's the

Unknown Speaker  1:12:48
it's a flush

Speaker 1  1:12:55
top or bottom. Flush top, flush bottom, like the single face palette. Or sometimes we'll call it a skid. It doesn't have bottom boards. It just has top boards, or a top top only, bottom only, something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
Oh, man, top deck, bottom deck.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
So single face

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
makes a difference. Two Face palette makes a difference. Speaking of two faced, never mind. That's just not good timing for that.

Speaker 1  1:14:01
Blush or wing makes a difference. Like, yeah, what we would call flush, or what we call wing, it's not we'd have to go through here and add it right?

Matthias Miller  1:14:20
You would just do this, something like you'd have a width and then include swing, and then you'd have the secondary dimension there.

Speaker 1  1:14:34
Well, I'm not sure, like there's no pallets that are gonna that are gonna look just like that. 4842 32 but they're not written up that way. Oh, you know, it's sorry. It's just yeah, the many layers of 4050, years of doing this stuff with that without. System. But for simplicity, single x, double x, let's ignore this wing conversation for the moment. Yep, and shipping parts. I'm at B so far, some of these I'm trust are going to be lumber with the three x's, like the two and a half, three and a half, 34 that's definitely plastic palette. I don't know if he sold any of those. I was our new salesman. He had a gig with these guys and was going to sell him these plastic pallets. And found some and now they're sitting down the hall. Would think Brio bought any,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:47
maybe, like, maybe, like 10 um,

Speaker 1  1:15:58
36 by 82 is OSB top. I'm not sure what that is, Matt that looks to me like it's a palette with an extra piece of so I would send along with it. Maybe it's what seems like, yeah, around here,

Speaker 1  1:16:21
crate, crate, crate. When it says kit, it's usually knock down like it's not an assembled crate, but it has the sides and the ends and the top or top boards or sideboards or end board, whatever it takes to make the thing, but it's not assembled here.

Matthias Miller  1:16:45
There's, there's partial assembly, yep, yep.

Speaker 1  1:16:53
Create kit. Create kit. So, yeah, that's,

Matthias Miller  1:17:00
there's a crate, typically, that would only be, that only makes sense for crates, right? You don't do any kind of palette kit or, I mean, I don't know why you would do

Unknown Speaker  1:17:07
that, right, right, right? And there's all these palettes.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
Wait a minute. DH, 100 So Matt, that's messed up.

Speaker 1  1:17:25
That's can't be, right, that's a typo or something thrown there. Let me check out later. DH, 100 So Matt, it's 50 by 44 i

Speaker 1  1:17:46
All right. Wedges is lumber, crates and pallets, bundle blocks shipping. Part board is lumber bundle blocks are all shipping parts

Speaker 2  1:18:07
that 52 inch bundle block. I'm not sure why

Speaker 1  1:18:13
I'm I'm pretty sure that should say one by six by 52 not sure why it doesn't I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:18:27
I'm so confident that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
I'm just going to do this. Yep, collar,

Speaker 1  1:18:46
shipping port, shipping parts, collars or shipping parts,

Speaker 3  1:18:57
same, same. What's going on? On, go

Speaker 1  1:19:07
forward is number here's one. Matt 24 by 40 and four by three. What is that?

Speaker 1  1:19:30
That's some kind of a crate. I don't think that dimensions are right. No, there's no way the dimensions are right.

Speaker 1  1:19:55
That don't make sense. Let me check I'll check out later. Fa, five, eight.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:59
Wolf. So, 585124, before the quarter. 124,

Speaker 1  1:20:10
by 48 and a quarter by three and a half back when was the last time I talked to you? Matt Friday, 586,

Speaker 2  1:20:28
roll. 120, 401, 48 okay, that might

Speaker 1  1:20:38
be the chalk this up as a crate. 3x i think that's safe. Is this a crate? Is my question to for all intensive purposes, if not, let Matt know it's a 2x so we're going to call it a crate. Matt, same as every other one, right? That fits GMA, that's just, that's nothing that applies to our conversation. Raggles, raggles, golly days, I don't know what that Is. G 3m with rivals, G 3m

Unknown Speaker  1:21:25
g3 m1,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:33
rivals,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:45
g3 and two.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03
All right, some laser lumber

Unknown Speaker  1:22:10
create some lumber. Lumber

Speaker 1  1:22:15
should be telling us, this is our lumber. Kids. Yeah, lumber should identify that wedges, that should be lumber, some crates, lumber. I don't think I'm gonna worry about the block power situation. Some are called Block balance. Some, pretty sure, some are called block out. So it's kind of irrelevant. Um,

Speaker 1  1:22:57
hitch basket, crate. I turned 21 fasters, yeah, it's a crate. Um, 2x are crate, and if it's age crate, it's crate, I guess, yeah, yeah, um, yep. Um, crates and lumber. There another krB, it's a crate. Lumber should

Unknown Speaker  1:23:23
still needs MH, yeah, lumber or crate.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:30
Point negative is a stage number,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35
lumber, lumber that's crate. Create.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:42
A New Holland.

Speaker 1  1:23:51
This is lumber. Lumber. Lumber base is some kind of a looking at what that is. 24 fasteners,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:09
two Matthias.

Speaker 2  1:24:17
Oh, it's a it's a palette. Okay, so we're gonna, we're gonna call base. If it's base, it's palette,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:26
it's called base, it's fits in palette category,

Speaker 1  1:24:35
got it? Yep. If it's called a block, it fits in the lumber category, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
Bin side, we're gonna say that fits in the palette category, simply because it's got.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
Oh, it's two, two. It has two parts, and

Speaker 1  1:25:07
it's a square assembly. So palette category, there's lumber, lumber, lumber, bunch of lumber here. T support ships, shipping parts. I

Unknown Speaker  1:25:26
Yeah, yep,

Speaker 1  1:25:28
we have crates. HT, we've ignored that the whole time. Crate support is not a crate, man, he gets is that the first create support we've seen? I

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
believe first one I remember seeing, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:25:47
so that is a shipping part. How you want to do once that, but support, maybe, spreader, lumber kit.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
There's no assembly on that thing. Yeah, there's no fasteners,

Speaker 1  1:26:13
and it's lumber. We're going to keep it in the lumber category, but it does get packed.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:27
Oh, shoot,

Speaker 1  1:26:30
like we cut five different sizes of lumber. And then when they order these things, we'll go pick out. And there's a certain way we pack them in a in a bin, side, in a, basically in a box. We pack it in there nicely, and then they and we ship it to the New Holland, and then they do whatever they do with that material. I'm just saying that's because, again, it's, it's not just cut the lumber, stack it on a pallet, chip it, it's cut it and stack it and then some of this has another step. Which lumber kit, I guess, could be a different category. Yep. All right, we have crates, crates, lumber. There's a palette rear leg. You with me on that to shipping part?

Matthias Miller  1:27:35
Palette, never mind the end gate. Is the end gate. Palette, still?

Speaker 1  1:27:42
Palette, yeah, yep. This model 20 9p base. Actually, there's two in a row. There's another one too. Oh, it's a base, but it has five parts. So it's got all these parts right here. So it's kind of like it's many layered palette. It's a palette with extra layers. I guess we'll call it a palette, yeah, let's call it palette. That's fine. That's fine.

Speaker 2  1:28:15
Just hit back. What's that?

Matthias Miller  1:28:19
There you go. That's it, yep,

Speaker 1  1:28:21
put it in the palette category. Same with the next one. That's a base. Same thing. Create, Create 3x should be a crate. Crates. Create blocks. Oh, boy, that's not lumber, but it has fasteners. So can you shipping parts? Is what it is. These are blocks, blocks with fasteners or shipping parts,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:57
yep, okay, do

Unknown Speaker  1:29:04
rear leg is a shipping part, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:10
HT, Bin side goes with pallets,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:16
crate, crate, excuse me, sides.

Speaker 1  1:29:25
Model 72 side and gets two four parts. It's it's a frame like it's a single it can go in the palette category, but it's a side so I don't know if it should have its own category or not. I don't feel like it should.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:57
Um truck Cha. Is that a first chalk?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:03
Yeah, um, it's lumber.

Speaker 1  1:30:10
Chalk is lumber, no fasteners. This front leg is lumber because it doesn't have fasteners. I

Unknown Speaker  1:30:24
lumber, block block, the two blocks are lumber.

Speaker 1  1:30:33
Excuse me, there's no fasteners. Shipping support is a shipping frame.

Speaker 1  1:30:45
A lumber kit. Man. This thing has 276 fasteners and it has probably 15 parts. That's legit. It's a kit. I mean, it's,

Matthias Miller  1:31:04
we have a section four lumber kit anyway, so,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:06
all right, that's fine. Whoa,

Speaker 2  1:31:10
that's got its own. Man. I think there's seven prints, seven different prints with this thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:20
Gracious, what's

Speaker 1  1:31:21
our price one here? Let's see we're at price in here,

Matthias Miller  1:31:27
if you go to the top, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:31:31
um, I think we were low on that. Yeah, we're definitely low on that? Well, yeah, we we are, we're. There's way too many cuts. There's way too many for every when we do pricing. Matt man, I'll tell you what parts is gotta be factored in pricing. Yep, different amount of part gots, because that's a sort of that's a different setup for every saw. And then every time you do a

Matthias Miller  1:32:07
every time, well, should number of saws be a factor?

Speaker 1  1:32:10
Absolutely, absolutely raw material, absolutely saw one, saw two, blah, blah, blah, yes, sir.

Matthias Miller  1:32:16
100% would it be the total number of saws used across the whole Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:32:22
yep, yep, including sizer, right, yep, yep, okay,

Speaker 1  1:32:33
two by four. What's going to be lumber? Round Miller. That's a crate. 436 half a fasteners on that puppy dog. Let's look at that for a second. 10 parts, no price. Cow.

Matthias Miller  1:32:49
We haven't sold it in the last year and

Unknown Speaker  1:32:53
a half. Okay, well, I don't know what happened there, but All right, we used to do a bunch of them.

Speaker 1  1:33:04
New Holland's down, man, that's nuts. I don't know what's going on in the world, but,

Matthias Miller  1:33:11
dude, I had, this is anecdotal, but I know a guy who left, it's a long story, but he left the financial firm he had been with because and they had this big spiel, and he wasn't allowed to let his clients invest in John Deere because of some kind of weird political game between the two companies or something. I don't know what it was, and John Deere has been up for the last last number of years as a As a side note.

Speaker 1  1:33:57
Side is a palette category. NH, 17. We did that before, right? Yep, I think so. Sides, palette, chalk is lumber. Front leg, this is lumber to know. If there's no fasteners, make sure that's what they got on there. Cut list only. Okay. No block, block. Those are lumber lumber shipping support is shipping parts, yep, IDM lumber kit. That's another one of those kit man. That is a

Unknown Speaker  1:34:47
Shazam too. That's a full on kit man,

Speaker 1  1:34:50
that is, that is under priced to the kilt 15 parts that thing is. Insane. 276 fasteners for fifth, yeah, bro, we Yeah, that ish domestic double shipping part, domestic, square shipping part, export, double shipping part. I don't know if you just want to label these shipping parts somewhere in a shape or form, but I don't think we use this language anywhere else. But I mean, we sure could, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:39
Yep,

Speaker 1  1:35:42
yeah, if we need to categorize items when we enter them from here on out, well, that's another that should fall on me. Um, if we have to do that, okay, back to the let me where we at. NH, can I grab a couple minutes real quick to catch Rick before you

Unknown Speaker  1:36:07
totally Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:09
work, call me back. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:04
All right, dude, all right. Um, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:22
Haven't done that for a long time either.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:25
77 Miller feet, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:37:27
a big palette, okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:38
2x is create wedges is lumber. Wait, three pieces of nail. What is this?

Speaker 1  1:37:58
Cut list? An assembly, but there's no fasteners.

Matthias Miller  1:38:04
Well, it's possible that might just be a holdover.

Speaker 1  1:38:16
Oh, that hasn't gotten corrected. Yeah, sure. Hey, Dan, um. Well, it needs faster information, so

Speaker 4  1:38:28
me, boy, here I go. Paper space

Unknown Speaker  1:38:34
fine for

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
this. List and assembly.

Speaker 1  1:38:46
I'm thinking this is going to be shipping part, but do you need me to how you going to determine that? Just by me?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:59
I forget. Can we? Can we put it

Matthias Miller  1:39:04
in the description,

Speaker 1  1:39:09
maybe what's in the ship, or we could category at this point,

Matthias Miller  1:39:16
we got stuff like palette, support blocks, Cates, colors, the domestic expert, this stuff we talked about, blah, black, blacks with fasters, rear leg, front leg, no. Front leg was lumber, if it doesn't have fasters.

Speaker 2  1:39:40
I mean, good. No, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:39:43
I mean, I can make a note, note for this, and if we add a category field, yeah, then we can come back and fix it.

Speaker 1  1:39:54
That's fine, because I might give it a name because we didn't shipping poor. See Dave, shipping ports. We didn't Matt, we did not necessarily call them. See high road. They don't have certain categories, do they?

Matthias Miller  1:40:12
Matt, not? No. I mean, there's no, there's no categorization whatsoever for this stuff.

Speaker 1  1:40:20
Thank you. Hey buddy, good week. Have a good night. See bud. Yeah, so that'll have to be specific. I'll have to let you know. See Augustine, alright, I made a note of that. See you. Mel, have a good night, bud.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:42
How let's

Unknown Speaker  1:40:45
it's going to be lumber, PP, 105 cut list in a perfect

Unknown Speaker  1:40:55
we got some great,

Speaker 1  1:41:01
yeah, these are gonna single x pallet category. See guys. See Steve, have a good night.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:12
Great. We had this before crate kit, am I? Yeah? Right? Did we call it that separate category?

Matthias Miller  1:41:26
What did we do? Crate kit? Yeah, not that. Not the crate kits, the lumber kits we did, but we should, probably should do crate kits as a separate one.

Speaker 1  1:41:37
Well, the guy just passed me here, shoot 33 by 36 two parts. Wait a minute. Man, that is a what?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:01
Guy? Random width. See that nice?

Speaker 1  1:42:06
That is a that's nothing but a palette. It's part of a kit. Same thing, Matt, we're gonna have to categorize that separately, so I'll come back to that. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:17
Oh, good.

Speaker 1  1:42:20
Systematic. We're trying to systemize

Matthias Miller  1:42:26
RW what? What if? What if, just in the interest of time and where we're at, what if we would take a first pass at categorizing this stuff based off of this, remember where we're at, we're in the in the remys and see how far this gets us. Okay? Or am I short circuiting too much?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:53
I don't think. I mean, I

Speaker 1  1:43:00
don't think so. I mean, I don't think so. I don't know how many more we had to go, 859, a creek didn't make a new hair. Quite great kid,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:15
but should

Speaker 1  1:43:19
be in palette category. I mean, if, if we can, because if we say, if we say, here's our categories, then going forward, we categorize everything and stick it in one of those boxes, right? Yeah, if we say, here's our categories, and we still have a bunch of stuff out there. I mean, I'm finding value going through this list, but I don't, if you want to,

Matthias Miller  1:43:51
I don't mind. I mean, if there's value, let's, let's do it. I don't know that I'll be able to, I'll be able to get 95% of what you're saying. I probably won't be able to nail with

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
100% accuracy. I When you say, Yep, I'm,

Matthias Miller  1:44:04
that's fine. I'm, I'm, like, I'm taking notes of how to categorize stuff. But

Speaker 1  1:44:09
Right, right, yeah, I got you. I get it.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:16
Well, a

Unknown Speaker  1:44:25
box kit. I mean, that's, I just don't know if it's knocked down or what. I mean, it looks like a crate to me. It's got nine parts, 112, fasteners.

Speaker 1  1:45:01
I guess? Oh, my, I'm not, yeah, how is so expensive? I don't know. Matt Box Kit. Where was I? Right here? RWf, 3620,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:20
20.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:27
That is interesting compared to,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:32
huh? I don't know how that price.

Matthias Miller  1:45:40
Hey, maybe it's a one place we're getting lucky with Remy fair.

Speaker 1  1:45:48
That's got to be a crate. Create some pallets based on axes. That's what we're gonna send that stuff.

Speaker 3  1:46:02
She question,

Speaker 1  1:46:07
question, question, and look, I got top frame with top frame that's going to be palette category with the loose thing, something there, probably, I'm sure Drexel got it.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:21
Well, yeah, it should be fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:30
Single x palette, single x kit, kit to single x we're going To palette category, all this. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:46:45
857, out of eight.

Speaker 1  1:47:03
Treated with strap hinges. Strap hinges needed.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:12
I mean, that's like a little

Unknown Speaker  1:47:15
six parts.

Speaker 1  1:47:18
It had some weird stuff going on. I forget they, I think they, Oh,

Speaker 1  1:47:27
I'm pretty sure they were, like, putting some kind of wheels on these things so they had, or they were hauling something with wheels, so put some blocks on top of the palette to keep something in place. I mean, it's a it's a fancy palette with extras like so does that mean it can't just be called a palette? I mean, that's where parts well, there's going to be outliers, again, I guess, right. So number of parts is going to be, like most pallets don't have six parts, so

Unknown Speaker  1:48:11
we'll leave it, yeah, palette, category. And then if we get to that point, we'll figure it out. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:25
this lumber. Yeah, Zoom has a bunch of different lumber here. Oh, I wanted lumber. Oh, boy,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:38
here we have snow. Mat.

Speaker 3  1:48:54
SP, 75 SP, 75 ht, SPC, 75 ht,

Speaker 2  1:49:21
um, yeah, see Jerry, you too, bud. Thank you, sir. Um,

Speaker 1  1:49:37
Bin inside we call that's a palette, palette category.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:44
Single x's, lumber,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:49
shoe with fasteners,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:53
shipping part.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:00
Three ports,

Speaker 1  1:50:02
shipping, part mix, good support that's going to be in the lumber category, cut list and assembly.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:19
I ah, darn, definitely,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:43
I can't be right, it's gotta be lumber.

Speaker 1  1:50:57
HT Kobe sled kit, sled kit, hit, hey, Levi, I'm not sure, Matt, what this 24 a drill.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:11
What did you say? Yeah, I was just kidding. No,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:22
I'm not sure what this is. This looks like a

Unknown Speaker  1:51:32
drill strip.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:35
He's got washer's legs.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:40
It's a kit. Because what do we say? Create kits, right? Something like that,

Speaker 5  1:51:46
yeah, yeah, it's a kit. Is that? What it would be,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:51
yeah, something like that, yep, 1x or 2x or lumber

Speaker 1  1:52:02
down through here. Yep, wave is crates. And lot of crates and lumber. They don't have any weird names. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:20
Yeah, okay, all right, we'll

Matthias Miller  1:52:25
give it a shot off of that.

Matthias Miller  1:52:35
Okay, so we got pallet palette kit, create kit, lumber, lumber kit and shipping parts. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:52:44
we have a palette kit.

Speaker 1  1:52:48
Is that what you said you have seven, seven. Okay, palette, palette kit, lumber and lumber kit, create and create kit and shipping parts.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:02
Okay, okay, sounds good, all right. And I think

Speaker 1  1:53:12
question couple here, no, no, I have just, I'm just gonna say, I was just gonna say, I have couple questions here.

Matthias Miller  1:53:18
And does it make sense? Sense to you to start fielding the creating separate fields for the dimensions, for crates and palettes like

Matthias Miller  1:53:37
and use that as part of the score or not? I

Unknown Speaker  1:53:44
set you use using

Matthias Miller  1:53:48
to put make inputs for the for the size of the crates and palettes.

Speaker 1  1:53:59
Yes, okay. And how would you, how would you create? Would you just two times the size for the pallets and three times the size for the crates?

Matthias Miller  1:54:13
Yeah, yeah. I think so. Because each Yeah, I think so,

Speaker 1  1:54:21
okay, yeah, sure, yeah, all right, yeah, I'm with you there. Man, is that just making it more complicated?

Matthias Miller  1:54:33
Maybe? Well, it's possible it is, but it's also, I don't feel like, here's what I feel like. I think if we get the if we get some of this categorization down, we can, we can put together a model based on what we have. I think it should cross your fingers, but I think it should give us another 10 to 20% increase in accuracy, and then six to 12 months. From now, once we get better assembly data, then we should be able to rerun it off of that, yeah, and continue fine tuning it. Yeah. Do

Matthias Miller  1:55:24
All right, well, I think I got my my work cut out, cut out for me.

Speaker 1  1:55:31
Your your question earlier, oh, with George. I need to let him know about getting together with you.

Matthias Miller  1:55:43
Yeah, I mean, I can. I'm in mind, just reaching out to him and and setting up a, Hey,

Speaker 6  1:55:51
I'm in a pine right now. So I'm getting enough to get the one load for Tuesday.

Speaker 2  1:55:56
That's it. They can't. That's what he said. That's your number three. So get

Speaker 1  1:56:10
back from Florida. Do you have a second for Matt's on here?

Unknown Speaker  1:56:19
Out i Hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:23
it's quitting time, pal,

Matthias Miller  1:56:24
not Colorado. It's not, it's only three o'clock. Man, it

Speaker 6  1:56:31
is for you, though, did MERV ask you about the yield, number of people start time and finish time?

Matthias Miller  1:56:39
Yeah, I got, I'm going to have to make, I'm going to try to push an update either tonight or tomorrow night that gets those boxes out on the on the cut list, alright? And then I'm going to have to do some work so that you can start inputting some stuff.

Speaker 6  1:56:53
Now, will that will then blanks and stuff automatically be there once I make, generate to the cut list.

Matthias Miller  1:57:01
Yeah, it'll just, just like magic, alright.

Speaker 6  1:57:05
And then are you going to do, I'm probably overlapping what MERV already asked you, but are you going to have some type of program for me to add all that information in?

Matthias Miller  1:57:16
Yeah, I will, it'll, it'll be, it'll be grouped. Yeah, it's gonna take me a little time to get get through all of that. The one question I did have which, if, when you're doing multiple cut lists at a time, like scheduling multiple out ahead, could we, could we give you a way to do that on a per day basis that you can print off, like, I don't know, one for the one for the 18th, one for the 19th, one for the 20th, and you could go back in and and close those guys out. Would that? Would that work for scheduling ahead so you don't have to mark them as complete before they're done?

Speaker 6  1:58:02
So where would that be? That would be where?

Matthias Miller  1:58:06
Well, when you, when you go to schedule a schedule items on the cut list, you would say, What day am I scheduling for? And and then when you schedule those they would get scheduled to that specific day, and when you go to print, it would go printing for that specific day. And then you could later, then you get scheduled for the following day or for a different day. And that way you could still, well, I guess we got two options. One is, one is that, that way you could then schedule print out that cut list. Schedule another one. Print out that one and have multiple ones printed out ahead. The The other option is just creating a three page, five page cut list, however long it needs to be. That's way out in advance.

Speaker 6  1:58:59
Yeah, the only time I do like multiples is when I'm taking a day off, like this Friday, I'm off. Okay? I'll make multiples, but like during the day, I don't I'm just trying to figure out like, if I make like, if I have one at the end of the day. And we're only halfway through that, that specific cut list and we drag it into the next day with the, you know, mean, the other half a page. How does that? How would that work? If I had, can we?

Matthias Miller  1:59:33
Could we just have it? I mean, does it work? If I was thinking you mentioned something about needing to go back in and mark items complete, so that you can, you can do a fresh cut list. But am I? Am I just,

Speaker 6  1:59:46
yeah, yeah. When I do, like, say, I can usually average, like, depending on how much is in the cell, I can average, like, 12 to 13 to a page. I don't run pages if I don't have to, because it just, I think it's going to. Throw these guys off out here in the floor if I do like one day I did have a page and a half because we're at the end of the week and that's what was left.

Matthias Miller  2:00:13
But well, is there a way that we could

Speaker 6  2:00:18
well, once I get done with them 12 on that cut list, that's when I hit complete.

Matthias Miller  2:00:25
So is there a way that we could I don't know. I don't have a good, any just brilliant ideas of how to do this yet, but if we gave you a way to put everything on the upcoming schedule but break it into logical pages so it's not so that you can give them one page at a time. Would that be? Would that solve the need?

Speaker 6  2:00:58
I think so. It's either that or like, if we put the blanks in all the yield and people and all that that's given it, that ain't, don't have the date in there, though it does.

Matthias Miller  2:01:12
Well, that's going to make so that you get less on a page, right?

Speaker 6  2:01:20
I think, try, let's try that. See how it, you mean, just try it and see what happens. Okay, I'm sort of following you. I'm a little like, you know. I mean, I'm, you lose me a little bit. But I think, you know, man, if we can try it, see what it i

Matthias Miller  2:01:43
When, when do you?

Matthias Miller  2:01:52
This is just on the on the gang saws, right? That you're doing one page at a time?

Speaker 6  2:01:56
Yeah, because the saws, I'm running them, like full. I mean, there's, like, we can tech on the sewing shop right now. I don't have all that per, like, designated numbers or when I want to do it, because there was so is so overwhelming right now. So I'm pretty much have everything running for the soul shop. It's just the get the Keystone and Brewer, yep.

Matthias Miller  2:02:26
Alright, let me, let me see what I can do once and then, and then, we can, we can, we can

Speaker 6  2:02:33
like open like up in the header. When you do the soul list and you open it up, it's got the, is there the dates up in that left hand corner?

Matthias Miller  2:02:47
Yeah, well, it's got the, it just shows today's date at the very top. But it doesn't repeat on a per page basis, but we could, and it has got Keystone or Brewer, yeah, Keystone or Brewer. So

Speaker 6  2:03:07
is that something would be put or were you thinking of putting it?

Matthias Miller  2:03:22
You would want that repeated on each

Matthias Miller  2:03:32
on each page, if you could. Is that right? What are you putting on the date? And then we you

Speaker 6  2:03:43
I mean the date for that I'm printing it off is there. So should the date

Speaker 1  2:03:48
go on on the schedule as it is shared with the floor, or should the date be attached to the completion of that job or work order.

Matthias Miller  2:04:04
Well, eventually, when we put it back in, we'll want completion.

Speaker 1  2:04:08
So if you put the date on the schedule before you hand it out, what does it other than historical, looking back,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:20
sorry, I'm not. I wasn't. I'm not quite I was wasn't.

Matthias Miller  2:04:24
The main thing, the main thing, it helps, is that the guys in the floor know that they're not. They're they're not working off an old, old copy or something. Probably right?

Speaker 6  2:04:38
Well, usually I'll hand write a number to the page up in the right hand corner that come up in the five hundreds for the Keystone a month, and just hit 600 this morning in the in the brewer. And that's sort of that way. We're not skipping pages because we had that issue before that they were. Skipping pages. They were grabbing one when I had multiple pages there, right in the wrong one, and that's what I just started putting numbers on the top right corner just to keep them flowing in order.

Matthias Miller  2:05:22
Well, I mean, what's the, what's the if we, if you had it print multiple pages, how would you in an ideal world, how would you want the second page to print? I i

Unknown Speaker  2:05:46
Just like the heading on the first

Matthias Miller  2:05:47
page, just having that heading repeated on,

Speaker 6  2:05:51
yeah, just like a whole new and, like I said, I mean, if I'm at the end of the week and I got a page and a quarter, I'll print the whole whole thing off, yeah, sometimes, like they're the job descriptions on the one page, and then it goes to the pieces on the other page, which makes a little if they're not watching what they're doing, yep, but I just fit on 12 to 13. Sometimes I can get 14 on her, just depending on how much info is in the size of prep,

Matthias Miller  2:06:25
Yep, alright, let me see what So,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:37
Matt, want to ask you a question. Alright.

Matthias Miller  2:06:42
Well, on this, let me, let me see what we can do. Let me see what, what simple solutions I've got, and then we'll go from there.

Speaker 1  2:06:49
Sounds good. Matt, question, what? What's the reason for turning off multiple pages or multiple whatever's,

Matthias Miller  2:06:56
well, we need some kind of, well, the reason is just to make it, make it more readable for them, and then not to we don't want to market currently, the only way to do it is you print a page. Full market is complete. Do another page. Full market is complete. Do another page full. And the main reason for doing it that way is just controlling page breaks, between making sure the page doesn't break, between groupings and putting the header on subsequent pages.

Speaker 1  2:07:33
Okay, I'm not fully understanding all of it. I kind of do, but yeah, that sounds fine, Yep,

Speaker 6  2:07:40
yeah, yeah. The only reason why I dump it off there right away is because I have, I mean, it's going from the thinnest to the thickest. It's gone. There's all kinds of dates in there. So you're gonna, mean, you might have one. It is like, I found one this morning. It was, they threw it on there. And when I added to the Generate to the from new orders. It was for the seventh, but it was way down. It was way down the list. Now I think it's because it's in thinnest to thickest. That's why I sent it. You know me and three quarters should we down the page,

Matthias Miller  2:08:18
but then we should change how it it seems in that case, we should change how it sorts. If that's the issue. Well, here we're using sort orders, and that's going to override any other kind of order that we have, right? I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:08:54
answers,

Matthias Miller  2:09:06
yeah, I mean, there we do by Can't size, and then by

Matthias Miller  2:09:16
length, thickness, sizer.

Speaker 3  2:09:20
Expression,

Matthias Miller  2:09:42
should we be doing it by due date first before? Well, I guess if you're putting in the sword order, it doesn't really make that much difference, right?

Speaker 6  2:09:57
Because I think we go by date and it's just going to jumble. Everything. Even worse yet, I like it from thinnest the thickest, really, even if it don't define the dates. I mean, the dates could be all over the place. Yeah, I don't know. Here's a question. If you go from thinnest to thickest, can you do the date? Like, say you have November, 4, fifth, sixth and seventh in 716, can you make it that it goes, Yeah, but it's going by length too, the longest to the or the shortest to the longest. Yeah. I'm thinking if you could do like the date of 716 from the earliest to the latest. But that's not going to work if you have say, 2425 26 and 27 inch, because that's going to throw that You follow what I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:11:17
okay, good job, man. It's

Speaker 6  2:11:21
beautiful. I'm thinking, Can you do it away, Matt, that you can do date earliest, the latest in the thickness, and don't worry about the length.

Matthias Miller  2:11:36
So if we, if we just, if we looked at, I mean, you basically look at the earliest and then group all the, like the earliest thickness, basically, right? And then group all the, all the that thickness together, right, right? Is that what you're thinking? Yeah. And then, anytime you throw something on here,

Matthias Miller  2:12:17
and then, and then, if you So, if you have a certain thickness due at a certain date, all of that thickness, regardless of length, would all get would all get pulled together, right? Okay, I think that,

Speaker 6  2:12:39
and another thing that's happening. Like, you have multiple like, I have yellow and green, yep. Like, I can see, like, if I have 1316, 350 nines, it gets slotted. And 1316 350 nines that don't, they're the groups that get grouped. But I'm still having other ones that are no they're no matching length. I think are the same thickness, but they're not the same length, so I'm not sure why that is. You know, me putting them together in the same color, what I do is highlight that that specific size. Move items. Yes, I want to move it and then it splits it up. But for some odd reason, it's there's multiples, like High Steel, that it's doing it that way, and that's fine. Meridian today was fine with 98 but then there's some that's like off the wall, that shouldn't be grouped together in them colors,

Matthias Miller  2:13:41
if you follow. All right? Yep, I am. We're gonna have to fix that on the sawing side for tracking anyway, and I'll take a look at fixing that on the on the sizer side as well. All right.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:04
I would love if

Unknown Speaker  2:14:14
the answer is yes,

Matthias Miller  2:14:15
the answer is yes. Okay, great,

Speaker 6  2:14:19
like when he walks around because wheels are spinning.

Matthias Miller  2:14:22
Yeah, that's exactly because, see, I mean, I would love if the cut list scheduling thing would be a closer replica to the printout, because I think, I think that would simplify your life. One question was, how much, how much do you use the scheduled versus unscheduled items like, as far as sending stuff over to the cut list and saying, No, I don't want to cut that right away. I want to, I want to hold off on that or or that kind of stuff.

Speaker 6  2:14:56
No, the only way I do that is I just give it a different. Uh, what do you call that sequence number like? From one, yeah, one to 10, one to be in, yeah, earliest 110 to be in. That's what I don't like. If I have it in there and I want to plug something in there, say another date comes in, hit it. So, yeah, I just put I just change them numbers. Is

Matthias Miller  2:15:21
there any, I guess my question is, is there any reason to force you to say, like, to send it to the cut list and then say, oh, on top of that, you also have to schedule it so that it shows up? Or can we just remove the scheduling step completely, and anything you send over shows up on the cut list

Speaker 6  2:15:38
and you get, you mean, get rid of them numbers.

Matthias Miller  2:15:41
No, you would keep the numbers for ordering purposes, but send everything but, but do you use the ability to hold back certain items from the cut list?

Speaker 6  2:15:59
I'm just going by earliest date. I mean, I might have 20 inch and five sixteenths, and if I have enough time, I'm going to cut down 20. But if I don't, I'm going to do the earliest dates and then jump to another one. That's the earliest dates and another thickness, yeah. But if I have the capability of staying on it, then I'll, I'll try and hammer on it, but if not, but I just don't, you know when I don't usually send anything over, and then all of a sudden, backtrack. I usually do that before I actually even send it over, yeah, like, moot and adjust my numbers. Like, if I want to put something in number three, I'll put it number three, and then I'll just tell me move everything down, or change in numbers. Yep.

Matthias Miller  2:16:54
All right. I mean, if you only send stuff to the cut list when it's ready to literally be printed and you just put it in the right order. We could save you some hassle by not needing to click the the schedule box. But if you're using the schedule box, and let's not

Speaker 6  2:17:19
Yeah, I would say, leave a schedule box there.

Matthias Miller  2:17:22
Okay, I'm happy, yep, oh, I can't. I'm just sometimes get obsessed with simplifying, and let's not make life harder by simplifying good.

Speaker 6  2:17:37
Now, did you make like, yeah, what if I put a new item in and it's orange, yeah, I usually went and saved it and then back arrow and then hit to get rid of the orange or get rid of the yellow box up on the top of that, the heading, yeah. And then it goes, When does that automatically get rid of the orange color, because it seems like the orange color is going before I hit that the turnaround circle.

Matthias Miller  2:18:09
It's possible it might be a, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  2:18:13
didn't know if you added something there or not.

Matthias Miller  2:18:15
It's possible it was some, some work that was done on the silver loom platform that made it automatically refresh. I didn't do it, but it's, it's possible that that, yeah, all right,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:30
all right. All right,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:37
good. All right, I'm not sure.

Speaker 6  2:18:42
All right, yeah, just catch up to me when you're, you're with that yield and persons and how many people and start time, finish time. Like I said, I'm not. No. Jim is starting it, but I knew you were working on it, yeah?

Matthias Miller  2:18:58
Well, give me those that'll that'll start printing either tonight or tomorrow night or sorry, either tomorrow or Thursday, probably, depending on when I when I run that update. Alright, thanks. Thank you, George, see you. Man, Yep, see ya.

Speaker 2  2:19:19
Thanks. Man, Hey Matt, yes, sir, we'll solve more problems tomorrow. Don't be late now. See stuff to do.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:32
Implementation. Dude,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:37
yep, are we okay?

Speaker 1  2:19:39
We're done with that thing, right? So let's just okay. Sorry. Are we done with that subject?

Matthias Miller  2:19:46
Yeah, we're done. Yeah, we're done with that. Yep, exactly. Keep going.

Speaker 1  2:19:50
I have, I have back work to do there on those item numbers with George. I have other lists of things that I didn't get to with George yet, so I'll try to get that done tomorrow morning. I. Um, where's it going with this? Give me a couple seconds here.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:09
Yep, we were talking about, Oh, crap, sorry.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:18
We were talking about,

Unknown Speaker  2:20:23
oh, my goodness,

Matthias Miller  2:20:31
we have been Go ahead. Okay, big picture. What we've got pricing, which ties into scoring, selling, tracking, which, that's all mostly on my plate, right? Prints. I did have a couple of questions. One is, could we, could we work with, I don't mind doing this with Amanda and looping you in, but could we set a goal to put in either a certain number of items or a certain number of folders every week on the prints. And just say, every week our our goal is pick a number, whatever we think, think we could, think we can do, and hit that number and start tracking that. Yeah.

Speaker 1  2:21:08
Let me talk to her about that tomorrow morning. That way it's I could get some commitment from her or her, her and Tina together. Yeah. Why don't we set a goal for a number of prints, yep, per week, and

Matthias Miller  2:21:32
something that they can if it's something they can commit to, then it's hopefully not overwhelming, but it still gives us a target we start making progress towards it. That's right. And and then do we want a we had talked about setting up a weekly, I would love to do a weekly schedule and updates that we roll out if we can. And also we talked about having a weekly, kind of weekly check, check in on different, different pieces that need to be rolled out. And I don't know if we need to do that yet, but yeah, I don't, I don't know what that should look like.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:20
I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  2:22:25
I don't know that we need to do that right now. But if it's

Speaker 1  2:22:33
Sorry, I'm I'm not sure, Matt, I don't have an answer.

Matthias Miller  2:22:36
No worries. Let's not, let's not stress.

Speaker 1  2:22:39
Okay. Well then the other thing, if that's okay, well, the other thing I was thinking about, I know what it was. It was around the we were narrowing. We were narrowing.

Speaker 2  2:23:00
Oh, we're narrowing down something. What the Harry was it?

Unknown Speaker  2:23:07
Was it was with the pricing thing? Was it these? What's that? Was it with the fasteners?

Matthias Miller  2:23:16
One question you had raised was, well, no, you'd we talked about that.

Unknown Speaker  2:23:25
You had to. It had to do with,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:30
assuming I want to get that from well,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:42
well, there's something I wanted. Oh,

Speaker 1  2:23:50
my word I had it earlier. I'm sorry. I just can't let me look at something here, Matt, I gotta look at somebody else's report. For nine was our last pay period. It was 29 six to or 10 six to 1022 I'm pretty sure. Yeah, it was 10 910, 910, 22 so

Unknown Speaker  2:24:13
10 925,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:18
have you enter? Yep, to 10 to 25 I want to look at. Come on, 10, 910, 22 and the primary is day two.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:52
We came out, 428,

Speaker 1  2:24:59
I read. Day was well, 10 days, so 342, 842, nine, and then the Friday, the wait. Friday was the 10th. We were down that Friday to 17, and Friday the 17th, somehow we managed to eke out 36,000 in five hours. So there's a variation in so 428, and 10 days. And then this Pat, this, this one here is 1023, to 10. What's today?

Matthias Miller  2:25:47
It's the fourth. I'll say 9393,

Unknown Speaker  2:25:54
11. 311 Thank you. Slash. 11, three day

Unknown Speaker  2:26:08
like that. Is it okay with that? Yeah, it's okay with that.

Unknown Speaker  2:26:19
Hang on. What happened? Oh, what I do here?

Matthias Miller  2:26:24
Oh, what did I do? Uncheck or delete that, blank it out, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  2:26:30
How do I delete it?

Matthias Miller  2:26:33
Backspace, delete or uncheck the item,

Unknown Speaker  2:26:36
back space, got it? I

Matthias Miller  2:26:46
Yeah, come on. Yep. There goes.

Speaker 1  2:26:51
Well, Friday, that Friday, we only eked out 9000 and this Friday, weeked out 20, and somewhere along the way, we are behind. We're below on incentive, because we're only averaging 294, divided by eight. Come on 294, divided by eight. We're only averaging 36,000 a day. And last one, we average 43 a day. Now we're 37 what's the difference? Scary. I'm scared to I'm scared to go here, but it there's got to be a discrepancy in the pricing, because the guys are all out. I mean, they're all working assembly time, hours, 750 actually write this stuff. Oh, we should go, Okay, let's do this. Let's do this.

Speaker 1  2:27:48
Let's go back. What am I doing? I don't want to go back. Did we backspace? Let's go like this, 10, nine, continue.

Matthias Miller  2:28:10
Couldn't you break this down by

Matthias Miller  2:28:19
couldn't you break this sub categorized by item and look at look for any really low dollar per hour stuff.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:32
Probably, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:28:37
that seems to me like the fastest way to find something I

Unknown Speaker  2:28:45
lumber price.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:49
I mean, our scoring is not we know that's

Matthias Miller  2:28:52
off. We know that, yeah, that's completely

Unknown Speaker  2:28:54
but this dollars per hour thing is 350 it's consistent. Concerned. I mean, sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead. No. What were you gonna say?

Matthias Miller  2:29:07
Well, I mean, look at the 1024, not only did you have a short day, you had a really low dollar per hour, right output. So if you break it down by item, let's see one of the items that pulled down

Speaker 2  2:29:19
hours 34 i Wait a minute, how we only do 34 hours?

Unknown Speaker  2:29:28
Didn't think there was that many guys off that day.

Matthias Miller  2:29:37
Well, that's something to investigate. I

Speaker 1  2:29:45
Where are we at? Items, okay, here, 1024,

Speaker 1  2:29:57
Eric Austin, Mickey, that's on the machine. Machine one hour. Stephen Julio work four hours. Brian, four hours. These guys work four hours. Benjamin Hiero, Benjamin Hira or five. What did Austin and Mickey and Eric do the rest of the day? I What done?

Unknown Speaker  2:30:34
I go, but I it's over. I can look at it. Oh, yeah, but yeah, do you have a minute? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:30:45
you don't think. You don't think the you don't think the pricing thing is, I'm sorry you don't. No, go ahead, dude, like you don't think the breakdown by item would be a good thing to look at. So here.

Speaker 1  2:31:03
So in other words, you're saying primary day, secondary item, yeah, okay, board feeder

Unknown Speaker  2:31:10
code, code, what is board feet for?

Matthias Miller  2:31:16
Though, that's that's groups by the number of board feet per item rounded to the nearest whole board foot. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:31:32
All right, so then here, what I'm looking for is like the Armstrong, the second Armstrong. There the FA 359

Unknown Speaker  2:31:42
what are the

Matthias Miller  2:31:45
high volume? Yes, sort by that. And then let's look for high volume, those with a low dollar per hour, like, let's see 880, at the bottom. So the quantity, I mean, like the FA 359, we're cranking out 254, at only 166, an hour, right? That's going to pull it down.

Speaker 1  2:32:09
That's the fabric. That's the fab roll down to hog. Wait 12 hours.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:17
Yeah, for sure,

Speaker 1  2:32:22
they are 66 I mean, there are six hours there.

Matthias Miller  2:32:26
That's not as the burger 3.5 is the other one that's worth taking a look at. I'm less concerned about the three to three five and seven hours once you start getting up to 12 hours time, multiply that out, right? That that price difference really shows up, and then you've got, I don't know, so then the other ones, like the New Holland, that guy sick,

Speaker 1  2:32:55
that's been size, or whatever that is, MX, 10. Okay, so we did incentive on this round burger, 3.5 again. I mean, our range is insane, Matt,

Matthias Miller  2:33:12
look at this. Look at that. That Remy down at the bottom here. Yeah, yeah. But then look at, let's look at higher volume. Let's look at the CW 12, right? That's, that's one to look at.

Unknown Speaker  2:33:28
There's a lot to look at. I don't have

Matthias Miller  2:33:31
there is a lot to look at. But some of this stuff is also a question. Sturdy bill. Okay, not to be too I don't know what's what's upsets of compulsive and what's just good data gathering, but some of this stuff, you could go run fast forward through footage, if you got stuff of the guys out in the shop and see if there's glaring issues about how they're assembling stuff,

Unknown Speaker  2:34:05
say that again about the footage.

Matthias Miller  2:34:08
Do you if you have security footage? Do you have security footage in the shop? No, okay. I mean, some of this, this stuff, is a question of, yeah, is it, you know what? What is, what is the problem? Are they? Are they literally slow, or are they and, and some of this stuff is kind of hard because you don't know until the next time this order pops up to go, keep your eye on it. This is a little, it feels a little big brother ish to me, but, but it would be really useful to be able to go back and just run through, just do it. Fast forward to the assembly and see how it actually ran. Like, are there obvious problems in the shop floor? Yeah.

Speaker 1  2:34:58
But then, like, here's one. This b1 this is a crate that we did 16 hours to do one. Yeah, it was a new design. We had a hinge and a door and all the things. So a lot of the cost of it was, actually, was just labor cost, you know what I mean? Yeah, material cost was, oh, less than 30, can't remember, maybe 30% of the price. And we gave them a discount on labor and done us a favor. But that's Matt didn't feel like we didn't lose money on it, we made some money on it, but that was just assembly generated value, right? Some of it is because assembly is only part of it. You know, you're going to generate more power. We don't actually every, yeah, everything doesn't have to come out. Not every equal in a set in assembly, dollars per hour. It just

Unknown Speaker  2:36:08
because assembly doesn't capture everything,

Matthias Miller  2:36:12
no, but it gives you a good rule of thumb on where to look.

Speaker 1  2:36:15
It's a lot. It's a lot of it number of parts. Again, like we said, the number of saws, number of cuts. That's a big one. Well, this was still a good week, if you're looking at this stuff. But, man, some of these are these numbers. All are they're just all over. So 1022, was the last day, and now we're into this week. First day, we did 46 so that was a good day. Second day was that 9001 here. There just wasn't a lot of hours that day, which don't make sense at all. Doesn't make sense. Third day, 42 average date per hour.

Matthias Miller  2:37:03
There's a lot of small jobs on here too. That's an interesting factor,

Unknown Speaker  2:37:09
right here, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:37:11
like, I mean, just look at there's only three jobs that hit 10 hours, right?

Speaker 1  2:37:18
20,040 5040, 90. 90s, with that. CW, three. Here they did 240 an hour, the other, the other time they did 100 and something an hour. I mean, that's

Unknown Speaker  2:37:36
big difference. That is a big difference.

Speaker 1  2:37:40
Here we have again. AR, 507, 11 hours, 151, I don't know what to do with all this stuff. Man, that was a good day though, 52,000 total generated here.

Unknown Speaker  2:37:55
Where are we at? Here? Wait. 1029, 42,000 2000

Matthias Miller  2:38:13
isn't this also let's see. Okay, even on 1031 given the number of hours you're running, that's a good day.

Speaker 1  2:38:26
Well, dollars per hours is really good. 435, yes, Friday. Hell's Friday. That's the, really, the key number, right there.

Matthias Miller  2:38:35
But then, well, some of this stuff on the third, if he hasn't put his stuff in yet, that might, that might go up yet. But is there a way, in my mind, if you want to put this into a management process, there should be some kind of baseline that says, do we have $1 per I don't know. This isn't exactly right. Maybe it is. Do we have $1 per hour? Should we do we should have $1 per hour that that is the break even, like no incentive, and then and then, like a a 5% incentive and a 10% incentive just for management purposes, so that, from a management perspective, you can start taking a look at any days that drop below these targets and start problem solving for those Yeah,

Speaker 1  2:39:38
a With the right group of people and the right implementation from the

Unknown Speaker  2:39:45
top down. Yes,

Speaker 1  2:39:49
there's other things that have to happen before we get to that. Well, fair, I'm just saying I mean, kind of sad but true. I. Fact, because, um, but again, that's absolutely as a man is a great management tool.

Speaker 1  2:40:14
Shoot man, I'm not sure how to, takes me all over the place. So we dollars per hour generated on machine versus generated on by hand, on hand work.

Unknown Speaker  2:40:29
It's, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:40:39
I don't know,

Matthias Miller  2:40:47
but isn't it if, if you're if the number of guys you normally have a machine versus number of guys you normally have on hand work, you should still get a pretty stable dollar per hour on a daily basis.

Unknown Speaker  2:41:00
No, yeah, we generate more value on a machine,

Matthias Miller  2:41:06
sure, but if, unless you've got, unless you're moving machine guides over to hand,

Speaker 1  2:41:13
well, this is like the one, yeah. Oh, sorry, yeah. So, so a couple of the machine guys aren't here every Friday, on Fridays, and two of those guys aren't here Fridays. One of them's not here Mondays and Wednesdays either. So the one machine never runs on Friday, typically.

Matthias Miller  2:41:42
Anyway, I guess. But isn't that a good when it

Speaker 1  2:41:47
comes to when it comes to setting a goal or a baseline, like you kind of shoot

Unknown Speaker  2:42:01
the target. The target is not

Speaker 1  2:42:07
necessarily the same on machine as it is on hand work, or probably shouldn't be like the machine work target should be higher.

Speaker 1  2:42:31
I don't know, because we're not factoring in the cost the machine, cost, what it costs to run the machine, and we're not factoring that in,

Matthias Miller  2:42:43
no, but all we're doing is, but for the incentive program, we're not factoring that in either, right? So we're just so this is a very just right this. This is not a rocket scientist thing. This is just a right look, if we could have the, you know, drilling down deeper, are we only running the machine three days because we don't have the work or because we don't have the guy work? Okay? So then this still goes back to capacity issue, where you got to get more orders.

Speaker 1  2:43:20
Well, it Yeah, it does, but it begs the question, no, I guess it doesn't. Should you generate the same value on hand as you do on a machine? I guess probably not.

Unknown Speaker  2:43:33
No, you shouldn't.

Speaker 1  2:43:36
A machine needs to generate more value than just manually. You

Matthias Miller  2:43:44
well, and is it, that's a fair question. And are you over incentivizing the guys, if, if guys on, I mean, if you're happy, we have historically said overall we're happy with, with that, with that labor percentage, great, right? So that's a fine labor percentage overall. But if you, if you go to 80% machine as a blend of business, yeah, then all of a sudden you're going to be overpaying these guys on incentives.

Unknown Speaker  2:44:15
Give me a second real quick. Yep.

Speaker 2  2:44:21
Yeah. I'm with Matt. Yep, oh, we're almost done. I'm in a meeting. No, no, okay, all right, yep, thank you. Okay, gotcha All right, yes, sir,

Speaker 1  2:44:51
yeah. So if they like, if, if the labor was always was allocated to machine work more for whatever reason i. Then the value generated will go up. Oh, well, it's a win for everybody. Who cares. All right? Who cares, right? I mean, we're saying it's a percentage of it's a percentage of sales, winner all around, if it goes up, right? I mean,

Matthias Miller  2:45:20
as long as you don't, as long as you don't price, as long as you can still price your machine pallets off of your 12% labor, you're good,

Unknown Speaker  2:45:27
yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:45:30
if, if it's competitive and you can't, then you start eating into profit margin, because everybody knows you can generate more with machine.

Speaker 1  2:45:40
Do you think that if you were pricing it, would you say that machine overhead number should be higher than Well, yeah, is he doing that? Do you remember

Matthias Miller  2:45:54
there are machine overhead, different machine overhead values

Unknown Speaker  2:45:57
in his spreadsheet? Yeah. Okay, I'm

Matthias Miller  2:46:01
not quite sure how all that gets generated, but there are Yeah. So anyway not, does not need to be solved today, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:46:13
That's right, okay, um,

Speaker 1  2:46:20
I still didn't get whatever anyway. I gotta let it go.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:26
This stuff, all right, big, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:46:29
big rocks, I mean, it's all about, I think big rocks are categorize these things for better, pricing, get, get sawing, tracking. We said prints. I also think looking seriously at at driving, like, what do we need to put in place? Pricing probably ends up being a critical thing to get in place. Pricing and design process put in place so that we can actually have somebody driving demand on the sales side, is that that's all big picture, right?

Speaker 1  2:47:09
I think, yeah, but yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm trying to hang on, on the capacity side, and that

Unknown Speaker  2:47:19
feeling overwhelmed with it, yeah, at the current moment of Day of time.

Matthias Miller  2:47:27
Well, yeah, yep. Let me know if there's pieces that yeah, I can, I'll keep running with this. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:47:36
the implementation process is, is the is going to be

Speaker 1  2:47:43
continue, yeah, we're going through a spiel with a well, that Remy thing, that's like,

Unknown Speaker  2:47:52
I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 1  2:48:00
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on there. And then, yeah, then I overheard unfortunate, well, I don't know if it's unfortunate, fortunate, whatever. Fortunately, I overheard a Rick in a conversation with somebody just this disclosing information, financial stuff here that should never have talked about and, yeah, just really bad mouthing myself. Dad, filers, you know, we're taking money out of the company, and employees are being abused.

Unknown Speaker  2:48:47
And, yeah, it was, it was, it was pretty rough.

Speaker 1  2:48:56
But, you know, puts on his nice face and stuff like that. When he's here, working around. Well, when I'm around, at least he's trying to but it was like, it was like, I'm I was just like, I'm done, I'm done, but I can't just be done. I can't just, you know, close the door,

Matthias Miller  2:49:22
because of the practical implications, right? Right? Well, let's, let's fix the practical implications as fast as possible, right? Because it's not going to get better. How?

Speaker 1  2:49:41
How, how could on the on the accounting. Pricing is huge. Pricing is big. Communication in here is big. I think George is at the right place, uh, Rick and Tina, my word. A too many, way too many mistakes. I it's, it's just overwhelming. It's like, anyway, practical ways to

Speaker 1  2:50:18
pricing system. Matt, I don't know that there's anybody that I could bring in here, like, off the street, that's going to come in and be able to do just all of a sudden run with a pricing thing, like, I think it's going to have to be between you and me, if, if it, if, if Rick is out of the picture, don't you think

Matthias Miller  2:50:45
I would be because of how much custom you do, you probably are right.

Speaker 1  2:50:56
So we, if we figure out this labor, if this category, yeah, this, I'm sorry if I'm being way too impatient. That's but I'm I'm impatient, and I'm impatient by nature. I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  2:51:08
I love working with impatient people. They're my favorite people to work with.

Speaker 1  2:51:12
Well, I'm glad to hear that, because I I want to. But again, we get that figured out, then we get the pricing. They labor. Assemblies, piece of it. Then we got the sewing. Yeah, we're on the right track. And then just like that, we're gonna have a pricing protocol I'm gonna write. I'm gonna have to, like, keep riding the ship until and I can. It's not like, I can't, like, there's not, you know, it's not like the boats on fire or something like

Matthias Miller  2:51:46
that, okay, but you do have a guy destroying culture from the inside out. Correct, who doesn't own pricing anyway, right now? Correct, like, we could, I could put a dart board on my wall and come up with just as good pricing as what he's doing.

Speaker 1  2:52:05
When are you ready to start? I'm sorry. I'm not. I didn't mean that, like, in a manipulative way. I just mean,

Matthias Miller  2:52:14
I mean, I don't know. I mean, like, How bad is it? How bad is it to just say we already know pricing is off the table. We don't have to have a system. We can say the next thing that needs to be priced. We slap together Excel spreadsheets that are just as good as the one he has. It's not right, but it's not worse than what we had,

Speaker 1  2:52:41
so it's not, but okay, but that's great, but, but I'm just saying but, because pricing is only a piece of that conversation. If we do that, the Tina may well like get ticked off and whatever. I don't know what she would do. I have no idea, but let's just say she get pissy. Either She's here and she's pissy or she leaves for whatever, she walks out. We have customers now calling who are used to talking to one or the other, who all of a sudden, that's the a little scary.

Matthias Miller  2:53:23
There. They're gone. They're not able to talk to who's

Speaker 1  2:53:27
answering the phone. Who they talk to? They talk to Amanda. They talk to George.

Matthias Miller  2:53:34
Amanda's not there all the time. George isn't the guy to answer all those questions.

Speaker 1  2:53:39
He's got his hands full. He needs to train Cecil on a cut list. He dumb. It just feels like I gotta get through this stuff. I gotta, we gotta. It feels like we're not. It's not. Maybe it's the grace of God that that I don't have to do something like I don't have to, have to do it. Yeah, yep, it's, it's, it's like, it's weird. I mean, it's not, nobody's coming to me and saying, Hey, you're like, I don't know about this guy, you know, he's like, telling me stuff, and I don't like what he's saying. Like, nobody's nobody's doing that, but it's like an environment where it's okay. He's got my nephew, kind of a like, influenced about it, and my nephew's, oh,

Matthias Miller  2:54:41
I'm telling you, it'll be well, let's, let's, let's, all right, keep pushing.

Speaker 1  2:54:50
All right. Sorry, man, yeah, we're gonna keep pushing. I'll do what I can tomorrow. Um, John had a question about an item carriage, four. Yeah, or email you about that.

Unknown Speaker  2:55:03
I've seen. What's that not that I've seen

Unknown Speaker  2:55:10
look at so many tracker

Speaker 1  2:55:15
Well, I had it here, and I'm trying to be whatever carriage. Whatever, here we go. Item carriage four. Here we go. Carriage four continue. They did 50 of these guys last week, I guess so. What happened is they shipped the 50 the people needed a couple boards added on the bottom or something like that. And so they kept the five of them and sent 45 back here to the shop. We took those 45 added a couple boards, and I guess shipped them back again, and John's like, hey, how do I enter this? Adding two boards on carriage four.

Matthias Miller  2:56:07
Just link them all three together, right? That's all you can do. I mean, what else is it? No, sorry. I mean,

Speaker 1  2:56:18
just, just link it to this. Yeah, 10 four makes sense. What? Yeah, come on. All right, it's all good. I gotta make a note on that one. Okay, so, Matt, I appreciate you. I don't know what's, what's your week look like, but we'll, we'll touch whenever, huh? Is that alright?

Matthias Miller  2:56:43
Yeah, that's right, I got, yeah, I'm going to be, I've got a block. Sorry. I've been under the weather this week. So I've been, I haven't been full on like I normally am, but Thursdays are going to be, I'm throwing as much other stuff on Thursdays as I can. So Thursdays is usually going to be the out of pocket days.

Speaker 1  2:57:08
Sounds good. Thursday is my Flex Day. I like that. I can, yeah, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  2:57:13

Speaker 1  2:57:14

Matthias Miller  2:57:19
