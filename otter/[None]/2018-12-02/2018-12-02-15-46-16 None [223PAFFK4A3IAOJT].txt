Whatever you feel most familiar with are comfortable with is the place you call home. For example, if you're most comfortable with the church that has a lot of religiosity and rules than any church that has that will feel like its home. I realized that this morning when I went to the terrace Bible Church, one of the things that made it feel like home was the presence of God's Spirit and the presence of God's love. It was a tangible love and immediately felt like home because I had been so familiar with God's presence and God's Spirit get the thing that made it feel like whoa, is that I realized that the musicians and all the people involved in the church were dressed modestly. And even though they weren't dressed

the same way as Mennonites,

Unknown Speaker  00:51
there was something that really felt at home

Unknown Speaker  00:53
to be with that

the last thing that made me feel at home was the ground in this in the Word of God.

Speaker 1  01:02
And I realized that I am familiar with that I'm acquainted with that I'm hungry for that. And that was the third aspect of being what made it feel at home.

Speaker 1  01:12
These things feel at home not just because of God's presence or just because of God's people, although it is that but one of the things that makes it feel at home is the fact that I have familiarize myself with things and the more that I familiarize myself with these things more these things feel at home and it feels like this is where I belong.
