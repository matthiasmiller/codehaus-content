Unknown Speaker  00:35
Yo, yo, oh,

Unknown Speaker  00:41
somebody should fix the ceiling tiles behind you.

Unknown Speaker  00:44
Yeah, no.

Unknown Speaker  00:48
Looks like somebody fell through the roof.

Matthias Miller  00:52
He was like, like I'm working from like a shady warehouse or something.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
You're downstairs in the co working room. And

Unknown Speaker  01:00
then over here.

Matthias Miller  01:03
It's somewhere. It's like across the hall. I've got shared office space. And I just got off a call that I didn't really feel like sharing with my colleagues. So

Unknown Speaker  01:13
one of those kinds of fun

Speaker 1  01:22
was it was a super positive call, like, I don't want you to hear how much money I'm about to make, or was it a very negative call where you had to? Which which side of the coin? Was it?

Matthias Miller  01:38
It was pretty. It was it was on the positive side. It was, I wouldn't say it's probably in the middle there. But I don't know who it is. At some point, I get nervous about a guy who's on volunteer salary during too much stuff about the inner workings of my business.

Speaker 1  02:04
Gotcha, gotcha. Well, you could always go around in a different office.

Matthias Miller  02:10
I'm upgrading my rent picking him out. He doesn't he doesn't know I'm responsible for it, but his landlords moving him out.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
Gotcha. Which works?

Unknown Speaker  02:30
All right, you want to do with Easter first?

Unknown Speaker  02:35
Let's do the easy stuff.

Speaker 1  02:36
So I want to re do well. Okay. In preparation for some things I'm going to ask Josh to do, I want to go ahead and make a change to the sales report on the dealer portal. And I want to get rid of all that categorization of timeframes of how close it is to actually being built, etc, etc. And because it was predominantly done in order to not have someone update builder notes prior, or like, in a certain timeframe before being built. But we're but since you change the x 30. If it's within five days, we're telling you anyway that you can't do it. Got it? Do you have any? Do you have any issues with that?

Unknown Speaker  03:23
With taking out the grouping? Taking?

Unknown Speaker  03:26
Yeah, taking out the grouping.

Unknown Speaker  03:30
Oh, thanks. So.

Speaker 1  03:32
So sales in quotes, where it's like getting ready to build not ready to build, I don't know is does it have any value? Well, here's, here's what I want to do. I am going to, we're going to be asking Josh to to do some kind of pending status on a sale to a conch RTL contract is signed this thing of it becoming a sale and then the customer doesn't sign and so on and so forth. So I want to just go ahead and group them as a secondary categorization of pending RTO contracts. But I don't want to add it to a whole nother group in here of all these other, you know, groups that are going on.

Unknown Speaker  04:11
It's thoughts the

Speaker 1  04:25
You look like my wife when she's reading something else when I'm talking to her.

Matthias Miller  04:28
Sorry. I just had this thing pop up. That's true. Why have you started calling me out on that? She's like, you hear what I said? I'm like,

Speaker 1  04:39
the best part is when she goes, Yes, I did. And this she repeats back to me verbatim what I said. I'm like, Yeah, but you were not listening. But I just repeated it back to you. That doesn't mean you're listening. And so anyway, doesn't count doesn't count.

Matthias Miller  05:03
Okay, my online team likes being on top of where buildings are at one way or the other. Okay? So you think you think why you want

Speaker 1  05:11
to just make? Do you think it's going to be too crowded? If I just go ahead and make another pending RTL contract? Okay, back up back up. Let me do this. Oh, you did? Wait a minute, I could I could give it a, you actually did this thing where you actually colored the bar based on a macro, which I probably could just call or the bar or something. I don't know what all of this color is just kind of annoying.

Unknown Speaker  05:45
I don't know that we need coloring. I don't need coloring in any coloring.

Unknown Speaker  05:52
So we don't know

Matthias Miller  05:53
if you have a pending or to contracts. doubled the coloring? And you're you're proposing adding a pending or to contract section? Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy. That's, that's great. No problem here.

Unknown Speaker  06:03
All right,

Speaker 1  06:05
I'll mess around with it. Next thing as an FYI, I probably should have told you this. But you may have already figured out I took down the configurator button. Because there is no configurator pages anymore. Josh pulled down the configurator pages. Because we were having noodle heads, Marcus was kept creating cancel buildings only to find out it's not an actually an issue with going to the the old dealer portal configurator pages where you could the sales report and it didn't work anymore. The the quotes page did not exclude canceled quotes. It's just a mess. So we took it down. Everything comes through the dashboard now.

Speaker 2  06:47
Tracking now, yes. How do you do? So the configurator link? I mean,

Speaker 1  07:02
everything so other can have the what is the config page? The link on there drives you right into the to the to the Configurator.

Matthias Miller  07:14
Oh, you create it from a configs from a configuration.

Speaker 1  07:17
Everything's coming out of there, rather than having the old the old whiskey pages.

Unknown Speaker  07:26
Oh, oh, I get it.

Speaker 1  07:30
So if you go, if you go to the old insight dash whiskey dot app posting thing, it'll tell you that those pages no longer exist. And here's the link to go to which lips your back to the insight that app posting dogs on page.

Unknown Speaker  07:46
Yeah, makes sense.

Matthias Miller  07:48
Cool. What's up?

Unknown Speaker  07:49
What's Ohio doing? What do you mean? They're using the same thing,

Speaker 1  07:56
just not the CRM. I had to I had to resist being really snarky yesterday, because something broke on high level where a report broke in. And they're like, Well, can you do something about it? I'm like,

Unknown Speaker  08:13
No,

Speaker 1  08:14
I can't. And I should have just said if you were using our CRM I good but I can't Sorry. That's kind of Ah, okay, where's my email? Where's our lists?

Unknown Speaker  08:32
What did I do?

Unknown Speaker  08:33
What did I do? Hmm?

Unknown Speaker  08:58
Huh, come on.

Speaker 1  09:00
Okay. A bit a bit. A bit of you. We already talked to the plant information stuff. What's right earlier today, we had to do some sort of compliance testing, right?

Matthias Miller  09:12
Yeah, I do. I mean, I need to do it for myself, first of all, to get access to it. And I mean, you guys could start doing it the same thing. But I can start playing around with test data

Unknown Speaker  09:21
on my

Unknown Speaker  09:22
end as well.

Unknown Speaker  09:29
Where you can like put it in the test system or something.

Unknown Speaker  09:33
What are you What are you thinking?

Matthias Miller  09:36
Yeah, well, we can I mean, until we get compliance nailed down, we can we can have the test system be. We can do it with test data, which isn't, isn't ideal, but it's a start, you know, figure out how we're going to integrate to do the automation into accounting. I don't know if that makes sense.

Speaker 1  09:59
So Who's Who's responsible to do the compliance is that Yeah Is that mean

Matthias Miller  10:07
you guys are going to you guys are you're gonna have to do it on the truepoint so on the inside so

Speaker 1  10:18
so what what what do I need to make that happen

Unknown Speaker  10:23
yeah

Matthias Miller  10:25
in Canada with

Unknown Speaker  10:27
me

Matthias Miller  10:32
somewhere there the compliance checklist but others need in order to get production access no oh and just go through that

Unknown Speaker  10:43
so reach out to Whitney

Unknown Speaker  10:45
yeah username and password and go from there

Unknown Speaker  10:56
fun yep sometimes we're headed by oh

Matthias Miller  11:14
have you played information you got that?

Speaker 1  11:17
Yeah. The unseen the unseen art to Pending thing I just probably need to talk to Josh I don't think you really want to get into the Okay. Is there any accounting stone

Unknown Speaker  11:30
to talk about

Unknown Speaker  11:38
are you pretty burned?

Unknown Speaker  11:41
So you're breaking you're breaking up say it again.

Matthias Miller  11:44
Mark seems pretty burned out on accounting again

Speaker 1  11:52
because it's a huge frickin project you're holding your finger up. That's kind of a cool let me take a screenshot of that window shift. There we go. Now don't run away just yet. Got it. Perfect. Man. I was just I was just in time. Just in time. Here's here's you gotta see this. There you go. There's that should be your that should be your new Facebook profile page. So we want our picture fake Facebook profile picture.

Matthias Miller  12:26
Run it through some kind of AI thing.

Speaker 1  12:29
In sharpen it. Yeah. Okay, you were saying Marksburg on accounting. I said it's a big friggin project. Then what did you say?

Unknown Speaker  12:40
Oh, no. That's it. He'll

Matthias Miller  12:43
get a break in July. If we can hold out that long.

Unknown Speaker  12:48
Break in July. What's

Matthias Miller  12:51
what's come out for a week? We can July. Gotcha. We got to I don't know if you did I tell you. We gotta get on the way. No. Why surprise. probably tell you that.

Unknown Speaker  13:02
Congratulations.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  13:11
So so you're she's due in July? Yeah. It's a long time overdue for telling.

Matthias Miller  13:21
I have something like

Unknown Speaker  13:23
eight months overdue.

Speaker 2  13:26
overdue. Boy or Girl. Girl. All right. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Congratulations. That's that's exciting.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
Yes, it is. Is

Unknown Speaker  13:39
you have how many biological how many adopted?

Speaker 2  13:43
First bio? I have adopted. First biological child. Yeah. And how many adopted? Five? Wow,

Speaker 1  13:54
so the baby, the baby becomes a biological child. Nice.

Unknown Speaker  14:08
Well, that's exciting stuff. Yeah. Nice.

Unknown Speaker  14:12
Yeah. What else we need to talk about?

Unknown Speaker  14:16
Um,

Speaker 1  14:18
I don't I don't really feel like attacking this whiskey or anything. I don't think you do either.

Matthias Miller  14:23
I mean, I kind of feel like it's low pay off. Okay, good. I'm gonna strike it and you can bring it back if you want.

Speaker 1  14:30
Someday. Someday, but we've got nothing to do.

Matthias Miller  14:35
That is the biggest laugh of the century.

Unknown Speaker  14:43
It's so

Speaker 1  14:46
you said Mark was burned out in the county. What's the what seems to be the bottleneck like what's the is it just is it just that it's a big freaking project or is it? Is there other things

Unknown Speaker  14:57
involved? I

Matthias Miller  15:03
don't know what he's got on his plate, he's got too much on his plate. I don't have visibility into it, I can just tell you he's got too much on his plate.

Unknown Speaker  15:16
I

Speaker 1  15:16
disagree. I well, I know, I know how Gabe is with accounting and 90% of the work is just keeping him on the rails of not going off and making it super complicated. And I don't know that Mark's very good at keeping Gabe on the rails. And Mark tends to be fairly complicated in his own thinking. So I feel like every time I hear about some of his accounting stuff, I'm like, gosh, that's your, like, we've got they just updated, like all the GL accounts, and they're a mile long. I mean, part of it's like, you know, we're trying to use an old system to be till we move over to the actual GL accounts, but it's like, Is that necessary? Do we have to have so many categories? Like, is that normal? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  16:07
Yeah, I haven't looked and open to those financials. And I'm here for a lot less analysis. Basically, I get, here's my look, I'm not at the level that they're at. So it's not even pretend anything, but you know, I've got a weekly cash flow, call that we do cash finance call that we do. About 20 minutes, run through a bunch of numbers. And in so that, if numbers are often like there's something screwy here, let's go find what's screwy. And it's been burning a hole in my brain the last 24 hours and found I found about a third of it on the call and probably another third of it on just when I went digging deeper there's a third of it that I haven't found yet, but you know, it's the only need as much information as what you need in order to manage effectively make sure you're making money.

Speaker 1  17:06
So in my opinion, the best money they would ever have spent is to every single call have Larry Troyer on because it would go twice as fast and it would be twice as concise. Yeah. Because every single call that you ever get on with Larry Troyer, it is just like, it is straightforward. And some of it's just that he knows accounting inside and out and backwards and forwards but it's still it's like, every single time that he's been on a call with them he's like, Well, why do you want to do that? Like if you're not doing this then or if you're not thinking of it this way then it's kind of a useless number. But I see it I see Gabe and Mark spin out on some of this stuff where it's like they are chasing their tail over a number that's just super complicated and it's like yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:46
why

Speaker 1  17:49
so that's my fairly high level analysis and just from working with these guys for a while now

Unknown Speaker  17:58
makes sense?

Matthias Miller  18:03
I can't except I don't think there's the kind of stuff we need to talk about because I don't know changing sales report on the dealer already talked about that. Okay, so we got all your stuff cleared out

Speaker 1  18:15
Yeah. Oh, the only only thing I didn't put on here which I thought of earlier today is if we can take 10 minutes and I can understand how to write include if language and what its possibilities are and not possibilities are then I can go off and do a several things like the sales order addendum stuff and some are to contract stuff but I just need to make sure I had my head wrapped around how to write include if stuff

Unknown Speaker  18:50
USA more running the test system if you want to play around with it. Include if condition contents okay.

Speaker 1  19:03
What is what this include anything Oh is that so everything in between the include if and then include end are is your contents? Can you write can there be expressions in the middle there? So there be expressions in the contents if you will?

Unknown Speaker  19:32
Oh, he's here today

Unknown Speaker  19:39
okay, so yeah, you can write expressions in between.

Matthias Miller  19:43
All right, do nested include ifs and if you are concerned about lying

Speaker 1  19:49
way, way, way, way, way, back up. You can do nested include ifs.

Unknown Speaker  19:55
Let's do this. So then this would be

Matthias Miller  20:11
and then if you're concerned about linebreaks, you might want to do some

Speaker 1  20:14
include end acts like the the parentheses. Is that right? Yeah, gotcha. So you could have a whole bunch. So for every include if there needs to be include end. And the last include end is ties to the first one. Got it? Yep. All right. Okay, that makes sense. Now, my brain perfect.

Matthias Miller  20:33
And then sometimes you'll get blank lines in there, depending how you include, if include end to end goes. And so if you want to work around that, you just

Unknown Speaker  20:44
do something like that, I think.

Speaker 1  20:49
Like, what was their month? It's coming. Now that's delayed for some reason. That's weird. What in the world still hasn't come through yet? I got the I got the little. Okay.

Speaker 2  21:03
Nope. What the world didn't come? Shows you got it? Nope. What did you write, tell me what you wrote.

Matthias Miller  21:17
If you just like, depending on line breaks, then you're gonna want to put the include if on the same line as the prior.

Unknown Speaker  21:25
Like you'll do like,

Matthias Miller  21:28
Preface. And then on the same line, do include lb, include IV, et cetera, and enjoy your stuff. And then do include and and then do the footer right after include and Gotcha. If it gets too technical about where the line breaks go. I don't feel like getting into the nuances of

Unknown Speaker  21:49
In other words, just play around with it.

Matthias Miller  21:52
Walking around with line breaks if you

Unknown Speaker  21:53
need if you got weird spacing. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1  22:00
All right. Well, that I mean, that answers. Okay, that makes more sense. I was got it now. It makes sense. All right. I'll mess with that. Okay. Cool.

Matthias Miller  22:16
I don't know that this stuff made it in. Do you care whether the Online team gets access to the transit tasks report?

Unknown Speaker  22:33
What transit task report? Are you saying?

Matthias Miller  22:38
Pull it from a building tilt, pull that from a building record, but then they could filter for me? Because technically, they would have access to view all

Unknown Speaker  22:45
transit tasks.

Speaker 1  22:50
Wait, so do you? Do we have does does does this have access to the building record? What keeps people from changing things on the building records?

Speaker 2  23:03
I don't know. They have access to the building record? I don't know. Other than that. I don't think we have editing permissions though.

Matthias Miller  23:14
I mean, Marissa showed a screenshot of the building record. So apparently she got in there somehow.

Unknown Speaker  23:19
Um,

Speaker 1  23:23
but I had to go back to the permissions and see how that whole thing were? Because I think I don't know. I don't know. I'd have to go back and think through it. And you want to give them access to the transit task based on a building? Yeah. I mean, as long as you're not editing anything, I don't know that I care. Do

Matthias Miller  23:47
you care if they see transit tests for? I don't know. Other districts that they go searching?

Speaker 1  23:57
Well, so let's write let's write a let's write a. Well, I mean, good lord, like, Hey, I guess if you drop a stent number in what hit that hit the drop down said dig it

Matthias Miller  24:11
literally show everything.

Speaker 1  24:15
Well, I mean, what value would that bring? So I'd say let's, let's

Unknown Speaker  24:27
is that the same one? That's that's tied to

Matthias Miller  24:31
this the same one tied in here.

Speaker 1  24:33
Okay, so here's my concern is that if you do it for the Online team, it's doing it for everybody now. So do I want markets going and looking through transit tasks? Oh, goodness, no.

Unknown Speaker  24:53
Should we

Matthias Miller  24:56
give a transit task report that's available elsewhere? Well,

Speaker 1  25:01
yeah but then you're punching instant numbers you got to go search for something which is kind of lame

Speaker 1  25:15
well, okay, let me ask this what are we what what is what is wanted? What is wanting to be known? Can we expose the information in a different way?

Speaker 1  25:41
Because if you, if you the middle screen, scroll to the to the right, there is there you go. Now, I imagine are they looking for more information than that? Don't know, oh ask. Yeah, let's, let's see, let's see if we can define if we can define it and figure out a good way to expose it. I just get really nervous about dealers having access to transit tests, and potentially making a change to something and then it's like, hilarity ensues. And

Matthias Miller  26:21
that's more like tragedy ensues. But thanks for the

Unknown Speaker  26:25
well, hilarity ensues is Josh's version. So

Matthias Miller  26:28
do you have any more feedback on fears creative?

Unknown Speaker  26:36
Two factor,

Speaker 1  26:38
you can turn, okay, I've been in there fighting with Facebook, because I'm trying to add users and suddenly Facebook doesn't allow you to add users anymore without a secondary admins authorization. And we'll have a secondary admin. I don't know what their deal is. So but what I do know is you can turn on two factor authentication for everybody. That's it's a switch, you can turn it on and force everybody to do two factor authentication.

Unknown Speaker  27:01
Okay.

Speaker 1  27:05
So I mean, if we want to find I am beating my head against the wall with Facebook, because I don't know how to add, I need to add some, some individuals to because I went in and changed the old heritage, backyards, Facebook pages over to truepoint backyards, pages. And but I can't add users. It keeps telling me you need a secondary authorization for this. And I'm like, Who is this going to? Like? I don't know. I'm confused.

Matthias Miller  27:37
What so we're gonna have duplicate true SharePoint pages.

Speaker 1  27:41
No, no, the the two heritage ones that were in there, I turned one into truepoint backyards. Fort Wayne and tripoint backyards. Plymouth, I think well, the Plymouth Plymouth there was a Plymouth one but it was a heritage ones are turned into truepoint backyards, Plymouth and the other heritage one, I turned into truepoint backyards. Fort Wayne.

Matthias Miller  28:08
Okay, well, we got a whole bunch of CRM stuff for next time. Which can be just that next time. And I will make sure this gets into somehow, I'm not sure if these guys 20 2306 2120 21

Unknown Speaker  28:30
right now. But

Matthias Miller  28:35
one thing to talk about is when you create a contact in the CRM, you have to go manually create an opportunity, so you can go find the contact again.

Unknown Speaker  28:44
Yeah, we should fix that.

Matthias Miller  28:47
I think the only I mean, the answer is probably an X 30 that lets you

Unknown Speaker  28:51
read both, I guess.

Speaker 1  28:54
Wait, hold on a second. You cannot Oh, hold on backup rewind. You can have users as part of multiple user groups. So why don't we can Should we have a secondary This is where we go test the secondary restricted user panel where you know you could have we could have a secondary like higher level something or other

Unknown Speaker  29:21
so you can have the Online team

Speaker 1  29:24
they're gonna they're gonna need well yeah I don't know it's a concept I'm not sure how necessarily to go about it but if we can, if we can add, okay, we've got

Unknown Speaker  29:38
three former well,

Speaker 1  29:42
too, we have one extra potentially one extra restricted user dealer platform. If we said hey, you guys if you want to go see transit test go over to this other I don't know that's that seems cumbersome. Or maybe they just odd now we're back to splitting them again. Oh for pizza yeah

Matthias Miller  30:03
yeah exactly this is

Unknown Speaker  30:05
a mine this is a my

Matthias Miller  30:08
keep better track of site check dates repair dates delivery dates so coordinate with customers and gather feedback after successful visits

Unknown Speaker  30:21
okay, but you lost me

Matthias Miller  30:25
this is this is why Marissa wants access to the transit tasks

Unknown Speaker  30:27
you check discord today check this career

Unknown Speaker  30:34
works I'll be checking

Unknown Speaker  30:36
online team miracle Doom

Speaker 1  30:38
NO NO NO NO NO pop General. No, so keep it a track repaired dates to the big dates. Okay well, okay, so why don't we Why don't we build a custom why don't we just build a report that's tied to a button that you select the sale you want to go check and you click the button and it opens up the report and we can we can expose the information

Matthias Miller  31:12
so you're fine with using this report as the basis

Unknown Speaker  31:16
just limiting it yeah, um,

Speaker 1  31:20
so if we if so if we if we tie it to if we tie it to an Ask prompt that is not visible so they can't go research you know, you can't just go search start searching any stuff yet. So maybe it's a maybe wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, you have a you have a panel down the bottom right hand corner can you tie it off to that?

Matthias Miller  31:45
Yeah, we could so this would be coming off the sales order. Yeah.

Speaker 1  31:49
Oh, wait, is that is that is that panel from? That's from the main report isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  31:55
Can we tie it to that?

Matthias Miller  31:58
Is it from the main report let's find out if it is from the main report

Unknown Speaker  32:04
that's not from this recording so we do

Speaker 1  32:08
so we can build we can build a limited transit task report that has no searchability except for the ones you click on.

Matthias Miller  32:16
Well we can even we can even why not give you the SOA D but also.

Unknown Speaker  32:55
I love it when a plan comes together

Unknown Speaker  33:38
don't you

Matthias Miller  33:38
go we don't need a detail screen because they don't get a detail screen. That's right. So we do this as a shared

Unknown Speaker  33:50
sales portal sales portal view

Unknown Speaker  33:54
and this is a

Speaker 1  33:56
fine just call it sure there you go that's it

Matthias Miller  34:03
add you to my favorites.

Unknown Speaker  34:04
You are my favorite user group online at this no no it's okay. And then here this is

Unknown Speaker  34:33
should probably be one single pane where you're talking about

Matthias Miller  34:45
then don't

Speaker 1  34:48
Alright, now let's let's go make it okay, what do we actually need in here from from a you need let's let's trim some columns. Okay, fine. steppin Sid scheduled date completion date assignees and start so we should probably ought to compile the if you can concatenate the start name and start address and the end name and address or actually it's probably just do we need start address we don't need started just just to end address and name and and address

Unknown Speaker  35:26
will will will will

Speaker 1  35:51
takeout takeout status because it's rarely used a whole lot. And we probably should put in some notes either well, do we want scheduling notes or internal notes? I don't know. Okay, yeah, fine. You can concatenate them

Unknown Speaker  36:12
I don't know what you want

Speaker 1  36:13
transit notes Yeah, transit notes and scheduling notes as long as we can D notate which ones are which otherwise it could be confusing

Matthias Miller  36:25
Well,

Unknown Speaker  36:27
those are internals. So transit notes are internals.

Unknown Speaker  36:49
Resist scheduling notes

Unknown Speaker  36:56
Yeah,

Speaker 1  36:57
scheduling notes, or actually don't call them scheduling Notes column driver notes. Just because scheduling notes can be somewhat confusing to them

Speaker 1  37:17
right things you're sticking this in a small pain that bottom right I wonder if you want to concatenate together the sales order in the skin as to as one row? I don't know. Do we? Maybe not.

Matthias Miller  37:29
That's even do you even need it?

Speaker 1  37:34
No, no, no you don't because you're clicking a row get rid of it

Unknown Speaker  37:43
let's do this

Unknown Speaker  37:52
yeah

Unknown Speaker  38:06
how's that? Oh no, dump it

Speaker 1  38:12
it's kind of confusing just you're already clicking on on the road out in the front. So

Matthias Miller  38:21
yeah, yeah, but this doesn't this doesn't refresh to match that's the weird thing

Unknown Speaker  38:29
that's my great

Speaker 1  38:30
way would it make sense to swap quotes and and transit tasks? Would it mentally make more sense to have trans Tasman top right hand corner my or better yet? Do we want to do we want to siphon off and make quotes its own page

Matthias Miller  38:50
why wouldn't we?

Speaker 1  38:51
Yeah, let's make quotes its own page and put the put the logo on the bottom and the transit test in the top

Speaker 1  39:13
although if you wanted to add if you wanted to add a group to name the if you had a group called scheduling scheduling records or something just so you can see what what the pain actually is? Sure.

Matthias Miller  39:37
refer somebody finds out that it's broken.

Speaker 1  39:44
It's funny. So the other day I went, I meant to copy a base building definition and rework a bunch of stuff into something else, and ended up forgetting to copy and just started reworking. The entire thing and it's it was like Designer Series base building definition and but about 10 Five minutes in I'm like wait and I've done a whole ton of work and I'm like quick fix it before somebody else figures out that I broke it

Unknown Speaker  40:16
that's plenty me you're well we want the this guy first of all let's get this guy out

Speaker 2  40:34
no we went so paints the sky and the quotes we got

Unknown Speaker  40:51
okay and then on the recent sales we got sub pains Oh whoa How do you get so many sub pains

Unknown Speaker  41:12
you know basically like

Matthias Miller  41:13
screwing stuff up I mean that's the bottom line

Unknown Speaker  41:18
that screw some more things up that was kind of cool

Unknown Speaker  41:24
Okay, so let's go

Matthias Miller  41:28
so we got sales okay, and you were gonna say we're gonna call this thing

Speaker 1  41:36
a scheduling scheduling. Just call it scheduling. Just make a make a group called scheduling

Matthias Miller  41:49
Okay, and then we get quotes, but about a boom,

Speaker 1  41:51
come back to sales. Oh, there we go. Okay. Okay, can we can we do can we take the assignee go to the back the report take the assignee and wait a minute. Why do we why are we including the customers name when it's already when it's already on the sales information that you just clicked? Do we need the end customer information? We're just trying to I'm trying to get as much information without having to scroll the window is what I'm after. Okay, let's let's dump the end information and push the completion date and the assignee date on the other side of notes so that you can see whether it's a if you don't like it just say so and I mean

Matthias Miller  42:45
well this is admittedly a small screen so most people in this is should be a little closer to what it is and we should do a new line new line

Unknown Speaker  43:00
yeah

Speaker 1  43:02
all right. Go back to your smaller screen again. Okay, click on yeah there you go. Um,

Unknown Speaker  43:07
to to do tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu yeah okay

Unknown Speaker  43:16
well that should that should give her some information okay

Unknown Speaker  43:22
we'll do this good to

Speaker 1  43:23
go to select Marissa as your your dealer to look at

Matthias Miller  43:31
so when your site checks

Unknown Speaker  43:32
show up then same place

Speaker 1  43:36
it's got its port go down to that 14 wide that was built them that down down down David Smith There you go. Escort escort delivery probably one of those was converted from an escort to a from a site check Jeunesse carpet yeah so

Matthias Miller  43:51
but but a site check would be on a quote wouldn't it

Matthias Miller  44:01
not necessarily. And your site site check before you sell

Speaker 1  44:10
I don't know how they're handling that. I'd have to do ask you how they're how they're doing it before before a sale. I mean, I don't know that we have any based off of quotes we could easily find out we could add we could add the the the scheduling report to a quote window and tied into a quote and see if it see if there's anything shows up I don't know. I'm not sure how they're handling that.

Unknown Speaker  44:58
Well there you

Speaker 1  45:00
So there is someone prep that's an Indian go back and are you on trying to test level or on quote on which level are you on?

Speaker 2  45:12
Okay there you go here we go here's a few so check

Speaker 1  45:17
all right well I mean if you want to go out to the river that was a while ago let me see the next one to three zero 50 Which

Matthias Miller  45:27
return that's still a while ago 510 A lot hall I don't know that they're getting tight out. I will tell her I'll add that to the agenda agenda for later

Speaker 1  45:39
if they're requesting based off of quotes it may be that they're actually tying it off not to the actual sales or but only because you can tie it off just to a building and then maybe they're just tying up the buildings I don't know.

Matthias Miller  45:58
So should we be passing in the building and the sales order try that

Matthias Miller  46:11
easier to do a whenever will report those playing around with

Speaker 1  46:17
well if you if you build it but if you built a transit task report to to pass off of a quote then you'd pass in the building and not the not necessarily sad because I am suspicious that logistics department is not tying it out to both sales order and because I think if I'm not mistake there may be logic in the in the scheduling report to eliminate anything that may be a quote potentially.

Unknown Speaker  47:03
613 site check

Speaker 1  47:06
that's a sale go back in and exclude for do your Sales Order field is quote

Unknown Speaker  47:22
that says it's not that was

Matthias Miller  47:28
here I'm seeing I saw ID so why.

Speaker 1  47:30
Wait, I don't think you I don't think you you filtered for quote only.

Speaker 2  47:34
Oh, and sorry. Yeah, there you go.

Matthias Miller  47:43
Gonna see this?

Speaker 1  47:48
Well, okay, that one we have to let's, let's see if we can quantify, talk to Marissa and see if she knows how, if if they're doing them based off of quotes, or are they doing them because there is a there is a if you sell a building, that's a 14 wide and you can request or you can select the shipping type to be delivery plus site check, which will generate a site check record. If they're doing it pre sale? I'm not sure I'd have to go ask logistics department how they're handling some of those. If we can figure out how they're handling them then potentially we can filter it and and build something for it

Unknown Speaker  48:43
okay all right. Well

Matthias Miller  48:54
we wish you Happy quarterly planning

Unknown Speaker  49:04
oh wait,

Unknown Speaker  49:11
why don't you out? You're out in July sometime. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  49:16

Unknown Speaker  49:19
and I'm uh, I'm out in July as well. So

Unknown Speaker  49:23
I'm planning to do I'm nowhere to be found anything.

Unknown Speaker  49:31
Well, then leave your phone and computer. Well,

Matthias Miller  49:36
I can install some things on my phone. Well,

Speaker 1  49:42
I will say lately here. I somehow ruined my phone. Two days ago. I dropped my phone on the corner and the screen decides to be black now. I've got another one coming. But one it's really interesting how much more you can actually get done if you don't have a phone to look at and to is really annoying if you don't if you if your phone's over there bleeping and like, you gotta go try and find your computer to see what a text message or what came in it is aggravating this can be but

Matthias Miller  50:10
you know, the very act of having a wise friend by the way wife's phone is now in production right now and I broke my phone on the way to the airport. So I don't have a smart dumb phone right now but the very act of having that for a few months has has helped to curb the end just resetting the phone and that installing a bunch of stuff is really helped career

Unknown Speaker  50:29
wise phone how to spell.

Matthias Miller  50:33
Go to tech Lestat calm. But the new one that I'm getting is

Speaker 1  50:42
less.com Why is no kidding. Learn more?

Unknown Speaker  50:49
Wait, you have one of these?

Matthias Miller  50:52
I don't have the new one. I had the old one. Which actually like pretty pretty well. But they don't. They're not I don't know when they're coming out. Well, winter, their net their their second edition isn't coming out for another six months.

Speaker 1  51:08

Speaker 1  51:23
Can you have you? Can you add any apps like signal or anything?

Speaker 2  51:30
Huh? What's it What's is it an Android platform? Yeah, it's a custom Android.

Matthias Miller  51:40
And then I just send you the link to the one I'm getting

Unknown Speaker  51:47
light phones?

Unknown Speaker  51:53
Well,

Unknown Speaker  51:54
let's talk about a simple webpage.

Unknown Speaker  51:58
Oh, I have seen this thing

Matthias Miller  52:06
I thought I was getting I don't remember now if I order it or not.

Unknown Speaker  52:10
That's kind of embarrassing. Dude, I

Speaker 1  52:11
said something to Daniel today that his mind wanted to explode. But you know what I think it's going to happen in the future. Maybe we should go ahead and plan for this. But you know what's going to become a thing in the future. Internet cafes, again, you're going to have, I think you're going to have a whole subset of people that are going to that are going to get rid of all technology. They won't have computers, they won't have phones, they won't have anything but they'll want to use the internet periodically. And they would pay to come in and actually use a computer to research the internet. How much

Matthias Miller  52:43
my sister's not that far from that she's like, only really need as a cellphone except for these few times when I need a computer. And it's so obnoxious. I don't want to buy a computer. I'm thinking about buying an iPad.

Unknown Speaker  52:53
And like and I think

Speaker 1  52:58
we're I think we're about five years away from really scary AI stuff. And I just that was an arbitrary number. So just FYI. But I think once some of this really scary AI stuff happens. I think you're gonna see a whole subset of culture that's going to decide to get rid of all electronics. Yeah, I would be tempted to join them.

Matthias Miller  53:23
Well, I've enjoyed the times I have so

Speaker 1  53:29
yeah, but there are there are going to be times where you just want to go in and use a computer like

Unknown Speaker  53:38
great.

Unknown Speaker  53:43
Dude, did I did I tell you about?

Unknown Speaker  53:47
Are you familiar with Jordan Peterson? Yep.

Speaker 1  53:50
Did you have you heard of the project that he and this other guy are working on where they are turning the King James Bible into a large language model?

Matthias Miller  53:59
Well, no, you mentioned you talked to me about

Unknown Speaker  54:02
the letter talked about the second thing where they're they're turning a bunch of his books into a large language model. So do when they when the King James Bible comes out as a large language model? I want to get my hands on it.

Unknown Speaker  54:17
Yeah. When they're talking,

Speaker 1  54:19
they're talking about including some other works along with it. Now that's that could get interesting depending on your on your denominational belief system, but do it like the King James Bible as well really what they really need to do is they need to take a number of conservative translations and put them together into a large language model.

Unknown Speaker  54:41
That would be sick.

Matthias Miller  54:46
You guess with the law of averages to eliminate the bias?

Unknown Speaker  54:51
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Interesting Very interesting.

Speaker 1  55:03
I think it's going to make some it's going to, if it if and when it becomes if it becomes public availability, it's going to make some waves. It's going to make some serious ways.

Matthias Miller  55:13
13 years from now 15 Or even less than that. The whole crowd that's angry about plagiarism in evangelical circles.

Unknown Speaker  55:28
This will give them something to harp on All right. We're gonna go home. Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  55:41
so what oh, it's only 330 for you.

Unknown Speaker  55:44
So I'm gonna 330 Cool. Later, man, amen.
