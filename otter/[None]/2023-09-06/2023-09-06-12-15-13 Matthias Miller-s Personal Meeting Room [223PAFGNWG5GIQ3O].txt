Unknown Speaker  00:48
been with us

Unknown Speaker  01:05
Ben can you hear me

Speaker 1  01:28
can you be able to hear me? Yeah I can hear you can you hear me? Oh that might work better is that better now? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:42
I was talking to you through my air pod but listening through my computer monitor and you know yeah generally making a fool of myself

Unknown Speaker  01:59
all right I know what you're looking at

Matthias Miller  02:11
you ready to send me a gift certificate for a chiropractor thank you

Speaker 1  02:18
it's a second paging I do a handstand yeah so

Unknown Speaker  02:33
okay so

Matthias Miller  02:41
meanwhile I think I have my building Impact Report working again

Unknown Speaker  02:47
that's pretty exciting

Unknown Speaker  02:51
oh and not only that

Matthias Miller  02:54
second page is upside down

Unknown Speaker  02:57
that's awesome.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
Download it and run it in circles for a while. You

Matthias Miller  03:07
might even have started this thing of like

Unknown Speaker  03:12
printing off their stuff just

Matthias Miller  03:16
sometimes when you're smack dab in front of it it's easier

Unknown Speaker  03:29
a

Unknown Speaker  03:37
nice

Speaker 2  03:40
that you kicked off the update. There's Austin working on stuff. I think it must be Austin because I didn't kick one off. Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  03:48
That means I can actually show off the building reporting There

Unknown Speaker  03:51
you go. If we get to that

Unknown Speaker  04:04
talk again.

Unknown Speaker  04:05
Hey, back again.

Matthias Miller  04:06
Back again. Thanks for bumping it back. I got to wrap up the building Impact Report well

Unknown Speaker  04:17
because of that, so

Unknown Speaker  04:22
good. So good.

Unknown Speaker  04:32
I got some background.

Matthias Miller  04:35
I got your email. Margaret got your email about the priorities meeting and is Is it good enough? Do you want a written update that Dwayne can send out tomorrow evening or just a verbal update

Unknown Speaker  04:51
in the meeting

Unknown Speaker  04:53
Ah

Speaker 3  04:59
don't think it would would be good to have to have a written update, but you'd rather just do horrible. That's

Matthias Miller  05:04
sorry. I'll give it I'll give it. I'll give it a shot to get a written update out. And let me ping Dwayne and let him know that he should be looking. Looking for that

Unknown Speaker  05:24
all right.

Unknown Speaker  05:26
So what I've got on the agenda is

Matthias Miller  05:36
also payroll module. I'm thinking not next week, I'm out Wednesday to Friday, or end of day Wednesday to Friday. So I'm thinking payroll module will probably be the following week. So still aiming for I think for sure, end of December, or sorry, end of September, but it'll be the last two weeks of September that we'll be working on payroll module.

Unknown Speaker  06:01
Oh, you said you're gonna be out next week. He said Wednesday afternoon to

Unknown Speaker  06:07
Thursday and Friday.

Matthias Miller  06:08
Yeah, my Wednesday afternoon, which means that I can do our one o'clock Eastern call, I will not be able to do our end of day check in. And I will not be able to do a Friday check in.

Speaker 3  06:22
Okay, and I am going to be out I just realized when I got orders message, I'm going to be out next Wednesday as well. So I was gonna ask if we could do it. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  06:36
obviously not. Can we?

Unknown Speaker  06:39
Did you want to do? I'd be fine.

Matthias Miller  06:49
My day, Tuesday is pretty wide open. And I was going to block out a bunch of time to work on accounting stuff. Is Tuesday an option for you at all up until 4pm? Or

Unknown Speaker  07:04
not?

Speaker 3  07:07
Do it didn't even I should have looked at my schedule earlier. Like, how's your next week look like?

Unknown Speaker  07:14
I think I can do that on steroids. And kind of, I'm gonna probably good it's gonna mean that I get less. Less homework done until well,

Speaker 3  07:33
okay, here's maybe this is a good thing. So I'm gonna be out Friday. I'm hoping to get on a better schedule soon. But I'm going to be off this Friday. So what if we would drop Friday and then plan to do next Tuesday? So we do Wednesday, this week, next Tuesday, for next week and then get back on regular Wednesday Friday schedule, which what we've done one one Wednesday, Fridays.

Unknown Speaker  08:05
Okay, that's

Unknown Speaker  08:08
although that works.

Speaker 3  08:09
And Tuesday time. Are you thinking through we would just you would be here all day. And we could do the 10 o'clock check in and then yeah, the same day. Let's

Matthias Miller  08:24
see. Hi. Look at this. This is that works. smashingly brilliantly.

Unknown Speaker  08:34
Here, hang on, let me make sure I'm just this Why should people sign up to my schedules? Make sure I don't

Matthias Miller  08:42
do things like shouldn't. Okay, so then that one, this event? And does Dwayne want to still want to be invited on these calls?

Unknown Speaker  08:56
I'm not sure. I think I asked him and he said

Unknown Speaker  09:06
let me ask him.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
I'm talking to him tomorrow. thing. Yeah, we need to prepare for the party. I'll ask Dwayne.

Matthias Miller  09:16
I mean, if he if he likes to see what's going on, that's I'm fine with that. But okay, so good. That works perfectly. So, Mark, you and I will talk at one on Monday and then we'll do our Wednesday schedule on Tuesday. I'm taking off this Friday and next Friday. And then the week of the 11th 18th. I mean,

Speaker 1  09:40
we will be back on normal schedule. Whatever that is.

Unknown Speaker  09:49
Oh, I see.

Speaker 3  09:53
Well, on the 22nd I have another wedding. I have three or four weddings here in the next So, the 22nd will not work. So why don't we just as planned for the 20th?

Matthias Miller  10:08
Okay, do you still want is Drew Are you going to still be in on the 22nd? I don't mind doing a check in with Drew there's or leaving it open to check in with Drew if there's stuff to go over? Or do you just want to take it off? 22nd

Unknown Speaker  10:26
I think Brent is the ones where we're

Unknown Speaker  10:27
at till then

Unknown Speaker  10:37
I mean, depending on where we're at, it would make a lot of sense. But it's, there's probably no use or no need for you to come in here. But you just do it from home as well.

Speaker 3  10:49
We just play it by ear. We're going to keep it open for now. Matthias, do you mind just to send out as a scheduled for the next from now through the 22nd of what we've discussed, or do you have notes or do you want

Matthias Miller  11:08
here I will be if you don't need it quite right away. I can have Audra send that out tomorrow morning.

Unknown Speaker  11:13
That's fine that we were just

Unknown Speaker  11:15
I'm concerned that we're all doing the same thing. All the different. Yeah.

Speaker 3  11:28
Okay, and then just making a note payroll module you said planned for sometime between 18th and the 29th of September? Those changes?

Unknown Speaker  11:38
Yes. Okay. Good.

Unknown Speaker  11:47
Okay. Okay. You know, like that, okay.

Matthias Miller  11:58
Any, let's see. So then the other thing is we've got on the on the agenda is

Matthias Miller  12:12
you had questions about entering assets, which we can take a look at, I hand it off. Joel is working on some of these changes. I'm not quite sure there are some holiday things so I'm not quite sure if we'll have it well, no, we're moving which we're going to have by Tuesday that's fantastic. So we should be able to have those those acid changes hopefully by Tuesday

Unknown Speaker  12:47
and

Matthias Miller  12:51
so if we want to take a look at the counting impact we we could as well or the building accounting impact with the variance changes

Speaker 4  13:10
so is one of those accounting what we're running into there wasn't able to link any transactions to the particular asset issues he talked about smarterme

Matthias Miller  13:22
No, you should still be able to link the link that out

Unknown Speaker  13:26
and I thought you had done it this morning I could not find

Matthias Miller  13:31
Do you have a transaction transaction

Unknown Speaker  13:38
No.

Matthias Miller  13:41
So what you would what you would do is you're

Unknown Speaker  13:44
granted one like I would have been but so yeah, either one of those.

Matthias Miller  13:57
See if these links Okay, now obviously you wouldn't have a link transaction so it would be under ABC if you would

Unknown Speaker  14:08
know I don't want to export

Matthias Miller  14:18
it would be sorry, well, let's just do this. This is what you would do is it's, it's on the transaction line underlined detail if you select it each each setting here is let me let me show this you can see. So this shows this shows additional detail for this line down here. You should be able to Ah okay, like that right there. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:55
Yeah, that will help.

Speaker 3  14:57
So now, walk us through what We've been scratching our heads trying to figure out how do we enter any existing asset? I know we talked about this during the design process and we thought it was all like it all made sense then like if we look at the one I circled that Bird's Mouth not sure so we basically have with it cost 7200 And it the useful life is seven years and will the end of useful life is May 2024.

Unknown Speaker  15:38
So,

Matthias Miller  15:41
I mean do you want to be walkthrough doing it right now?

Speaker 3  15:44
I think it would be helpful because it makes sense the notes say to enter an existing asset, you enter a journal entry transfer from equities Well, I had let's let's just walk through the steps were okay.

Matthias Miller  15:59
What kind of AI Id do you want for this guy?

Unknown Speaker  16:04
I don't care just Anything's fine. We're just testing so the MN

Matthias Miller  16:10
burns mouth monster. birds mouth not sure. All right, so the date put in the service would be also be

Speaker 1  16:21
we're gonna say 625 17

Matthias Miller  16:27
asset class production equipment and fixtures. So we're going to start with that and then we're going to do a new transaction for ABC and it's going to be it would be a we're going to what asset or what account would this go under

Speaker 3  16:56
the asset itself? Like you mean were you Yeah, store the acid it should be under what is it other assets

Unknown Speaker  17:09
then there should be there

Unknown Speaker  17:19
was an asset account for them?

Matthias Miller  17:22
We got 10. If the conflicts we got two other asset accounts.

Unknown Speaker  17:29
Is this supposed to be

Unknown Speaker  17:30
equipment and then

Unknown Speaker  17:34
production equipment? Yeah. Okay. So

Speaker 3  17:42
that property plant and equipment PPE comes from a very professional looking example from someone from App posting or it looks like investor tools it used or

Matthias Miller  17:58
interesting side note, there is an accounting book that Joel keeps talking about and he keeps I don't know if I've mentioned this to you

Speaker 5  18:11
or not conversation notes book

Unknown Speaker  18:21
What was it from

Unknown Speaker  18:25
you all to me

Unknown Speaker  18:30
what is the one that that we were looking for Financial

Unknown Speaker  18:34
Intelligence

Unknown Speaker  18:38
it's probably more scholarly than that

Matthias Miller  18:44
Joel it's

Matthias Miller  18:52
it's fair to say it's probably not a for dummies book

Unknown Speaker  19:11
the highlights

Matthias Miller  19:30
Well, I'm gonna have to ping him. I know there's a very specific book that he's been referencing that I thought

Unknown Speaker  19:36
might be interesting

Unknown Speaker  19:51
okay

Matthias Miller  19:56
so then this would become coming out of wouldn't 30 3018 So the 18 owner's equity also for 7200 And then this one should be assigned to this asset. Alright, so theoretically, yeah, maybe we should probably go ahead.

Speaker 3  20:19
Why does it come out of Owner's Equity that's only one we're entering existing like entering new a new asset when

Unknown Speaker  20:29
we go on to cash or whatever.

Matthias Miller  20:33
So if we do an asset value of 7200 times I mean a salvage value 5% that would put us at 360 End of useful life would be six.

Unknown Speaker  20:44
Wow, this one doesn't have any salvage value.

Unknown Speaker  20:47
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  20:50
Which right or wrong and

Matthias Miller  20:53
so then here this is showing end of useful life as June of 24.

Speaker 3  21:02
And, okay, this is because I think your calculations

Unknown Speaker  21:09
are probably only go to the first

Speaker 3  21:11
next month, which is fine. That's why I'm showing me a month earlier. I would say this is

Matthias Miller  21:23
then asset depreciation, well, we can't can't enter any depreciation expenses. So right that's, that was broke. Right? Right. So so that if you go here, here's showing so here you're seeing that I mean, that's that is the process well, it's not quite the process though. There's one other thing we need to do

Unknown Speaker  21:52
because we have

Matthias Miller  21:57
my poor brain hurts, but it would be how much I mean what is we need to also adjust where it's current depreciated value so this would be a nutrients action as of

Speaker 3  22:21
last, but yeah, let's say we're doing it for if we can pretend we're doing this for January 1 are setting up for 2024

Matthias Miller  22:32
So we do 1231 I'm not quite sure how this is going to work but so 24 We would have six months 70 to 7200 divided by seven divided by 12

Unknown Speaker  22:51
is no

Matthias Miller  23:00
times six so the remaining value should be that and this would be 7200 minus so theoretically this is its current depreciation as of end of year assuming I did my math right so then the the depreciation

Speaker 3  23:29
so here's why we're do we use the like it on the balance sheet it should be part of accumulated depreciation that's been incurred up to now

Speaker 4  23:45
launder other assets or something like that?

Unknown Speaker  23:49
Yeah the same way

Unknown Speaker  23:53
globally the lab and huh we well oh eight 111

Matthias Miller  24:07
Okay, so then this is a let's do this. The asset would be under what do we say the asset 1207. It's easier for me to think through. So this would be a credit which means this would be a debit

Unknown Speaker  24:29
and not

Matthias Miller  24:34
I think these are supposed to be tied out to the asset as well if I'm thinking correctly.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
So then we post it.

Matthias Miller  24:47
It's increasing its value with changes depreciation, consider this an impairment loss.

Speaker 4  24:53
And then you need to swap law swap the debit and credit because because

Unknown Speaker  24:59
one of them is a contra account that

Unknown Speaker  25:07
way but debiting the

Matthias Miller  25:10
this will increase the asset value you be sure oh

Unknown Speaker  25:27
oh no it's not the assets owner's equity that we put it against the asset should maintain its value correct

Matthias Miller  25:48
since increasing well this makes me wonder well let's go see how this works I don't know how this works and depreciation expense

Matthias Miller  26:06
let's go figure that appreciation about asset remaining useful month's asset book value minus I'm not sure though I think we are expecting it to come out of the asset which I mean what I'm going to do this just for the sake of experimentation to see what

Unknown Speaker  26:38
no

Unknown Speaker  26:52
$20 versus

Unknown Speaker  26:56
20 coming from is that

Matthias Miller  26:59
it's because it's not recognizing any depreciation up until this point so it's from now through the for the following 10 months so it's trying to depreciate it across 10 months because it doesn't recognize any historical depreciation so this thing has

Unknown Speaker  27:21
asset value

Speaker 2  27:27
is the asset purchase cost minus the recorded depreciation

Matthias Miller  27:42
we can't calculate depreciation correctly because we can't tie it out to expense accounts.

Unknown Speaker  27:56
So we need a way to fix

Matthias Miller  27:59
that sorry let me check one more thing though asset recorded depreciation

Unknown Speaker  28:06
asset by

Matthias Miller  28:10
yes so what we would so what this should be so I think owner's equity doesn't you know this this transaction I think this is how the adjustment should be set up. Let me try something

Unknown Speaker  28:29
we're going to

Matthias Miller  28:45
let's see if we can let's see if we can get just a little crafty to make this one work

Unknown Speaker  28:59
asset

Unknown Speaker  29:02
accumulated

Speaker 5  29:05
depreciation will mount let's make this and

Matthias Miller  29:11
editable screen report okay and then we're going to do button we're going to modify select records

Speaker 5  29:26
we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  29:37
this would be ABC and

Speaker 6  29:44
in my honest in my alright

Unknown Speaker  29:50
he was actually the second

Unknown Speaker  29:55
but that first

Unknown Speaker  29:56
one's wrong

Unknown Speaker  30:02
but it isn't help which may not be for my exporter Milan grna or lightning

Unknown Speaker  30:22
do the cumulative percentage

Unknown Speaker  30:25
yeah

Unknown Speaker  30:31
okay and then this guy

Matthias Miller  30:39
so this is actually the accumulated depreciation and the expense account

Matthias Miller  30:57
what expense account do you want to use going forward

Unknown Speaker  31:06
is this a monthly amount?

Unknown Speaker  31:09
Yes it's the

Speaker 3  31:15
but yeah it's inventory production overhead and then depreciate it's on the balance

Unknown Speaker  31:26
sheet this one

Unknown Speaker  31:34
yeah

Unknown Speaker  31:41
70 pounds and failing deform keep paying for

Unknown Speaker  31:56
see this works

Unknown Speaker  31:59
what don't you like you're missing that you're missing that.

Unknown Speaker  32:05
Still? Let's actually do let's just do this precision expands depreciation count

Unknown Speaker  32:34
bomber.

Unknown Speaker  32:35
Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  32:38
we're just gonna have to, I think, sadly, we're just gonna have to wait. But it should I buy this. If this is the way I understand it. This is how I'm able. Yeah, this is how it should work. Or this is how it should be set up. Where the appreciation? Wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  33:06
Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  33:11
No, because this is this is not quite right. You're going to have to have additional rows for

Speaker 6  33:23
lunch. So we can take someone put them on tamper by cedar tempered stone know how many he saw that it was not a strong candidate.

Matthias Miller  33:50
Nevermind, this. This is right. This is right. I'm sorry. Okay, I think this is how you how you needed to set up, just have it set up. So you have the accumulated depreciation linked to the asset ID. And once we get that in a column right here, then we'll recognize that as depreciation for this asset. And then I mean, it's not going to say at that point, it's actually going to take

Unknown Speaker  34:21
three seats.

Matthias Miller  34:24
It's going to want to depreciate it at $51.43 a month, because it's still seeing 10 remaining months in useful life, not dog, but if we put that number is going to steadily increase until January 1 And then once we start running January 1, you'd have six months of useful life and it would be

Unknown Speaker  34:53
back to the

Unknown Speaker  34:56
8571

Unknown Speaker  35:04
Are you? Are you clear on? Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  35:07
think so

Speaker 3  35:08
entering and this this these fixes can we expect those? This weekend or whatever you? Are these more

Unknown Speaker  35:19
substantive right in small amounts?

Unknown Speaker  35:26
For more we can even

Unknown Speaker  35:40
you would

Matthias Miller  35:41
want it by Tuesday morning, right?

Unknown Speaker  35:49
That yeah, that would be ideal, but

Unknown Speaker  35:51
okay.

Unknown Speaker  36:04
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  36:07
Okay. There you go. So that's that. I will check with Joel to see if we can get that in before. I mean, I don't see any reason why we couldn't have those fixes. There. There are some potential issues with opening up. There's a little bit of research he needs to do to make sure that we don't have unexpected side effects by opening up the those expenses to asset accounts. But that's, yeah. Chase that.

Speaker 3  36:40
So we're at almost three o'clock, but you do you want to talk through some of the we have time, if you want to talk to the FBI. The FBI allocation changes that you made? No,

Matthias Miller  36:59
I'm gonna have to do this in my local

Unknown Speaker  37:02
system.

Unknown Speaker  37:09
Go ahead, share that.

Speaker 5  37:17
I lost myself, you know, I need to get rid of me at least she's running into trouble with payment accounts not being able to get those payment accounts.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Okay,

Matthias Miller  37:38
so, yeah, here. Here is, here's one, it's a little bit made up, because I adjusted some of the dates, but it was built prior to the period. And raw materials was applied before it was delivered. And production overhead was applied after. And I think production labor was maybe never reconciled. So if it's record reconciled before then we are crediting raw materials, ie decreasing raw materials value, we are debiting FGI raw materials, ie increasing on the date that the cost was applied on delivery, we are then crediting slash decreasing FTI. And we are debiting slash increasing the cogs expense by the variance amount, as well as doing the same thing for the finished goods. asset and the cogs expense account for the amount of for the standard cost. Then, I mean completed buildings is production labor isn't doesn't have anything fancy. That's because we haven't done the actual cost. On the production overhead, we're applying the variance. Well, here's the here's the standard production variance. And then on the production overhead here, we did the costing after the building was delivered and we have a negative variance. And so in this case, we're actually debiting a increasing production overhead as of the date it was applied. And we are crediting slash decreasing the cogs expense for production overhead as of that date

Speaker 6  40:01
But hopefully not.

Unknown Speaker  40:12
So yeah, even each bow, but they decided they thought

Matthias Miller  40:20
then there's a similar type of scenario that we can take a look at with

Unknown Speaker  40:26
the diagnostic mode.

Unknown Speaker  40:29
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  40:40
Let's go see if we can find one that's built but has I don't know if we get one that's built that has a variance? Actually, I don't think we do because of the timing of Yeah. Because of the timing of how the costs were applied

Unknown Speaker  41:09
Oh, my goodness.

Matthias Miller  41:12
Does that look right? Or do you just want to shrug your shoulders and say, yeah, it looks about right. But we're going to take a magnifying glass to it when

Unknown Speaker  41:25
I need a little bit of time to digest. So what you're doing, we're saying here, eight, eight building costs were applied. That's when the building was built. Right? In theory?

Matthias Miller  41:43
No, the building was built prior to this date. And it was built prior to us having an FDI allocation. Now we could for the sake of example, let's actually do this because we love

Matthias Miller  42:05
it's my own system, I can do it, I can do what I want. Let's do a button to do by selected records.

Matthias Miller  42:22
Built date, let me see if I can, can you see if I can override the build date? Ah, okay, we are going to so this is this is not accurate to what the skin actually happened with the skin. But for the sake of example, we're going to say it was built on the third raw material cost was applied. On the eighth, it was delivered on the ninth. And production overhead was applied on the 15th and production labor, we don't have any actual costs yet.

Speaker 3  43:00
Okay, when you say ply, you're saying we know the actual costs that were incurred? And we apply the cause. We know that we now know the costs that were incurred for that period, we apply the cost and then it does it's the transactions Okay, and we're saying raw materials we were I get them confused but $99.28 too high or too low on what we allocated.

Matthias Miller  43:30
Yes, we were too low in what we allocated

Unknown Speaker  43:35
okay. So, then we increase.

Unknown Speaker  43:42
So,

Speaker 3  43:44
so, this was before it was delivered. So, we we took more out of raw materials and added more to the finished goods inventory raw materials, the same amount and then the building was delivered. So then we that gets interesting. So the building was delivered the day after. And so, okay, what why are we showing I had expected those would, it would now show instead of 9028 and 1026, who just showed instead of four transactions, it would just show two transactions on eight nine for raw materials like it would is that in theory, what would happen like the billing record would update and it would now say the raw materials is 1026 plus 9828, whatever that is? About 1124

Unknown Speaker  44:46
E. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:48
I mean this these are line items this these will be line items on a single transaction in fact, I think

Speaker 4  44:56
so as when it moves from raw material. was the cost of goods? It's still keeping the variance and the original amount separate

Matthias Miller  45:08
on separate line items within that transaction.

Speaker 3  45:13
It won't combine those. But on the building, right, wow.

Matthias Miller  45:20
On the building record, it looks like this, you would see the 1026, you would see the 9028. Sorry, you will see the 1116. See the 9028?

Unknown Speaker  45:35
You would see that 1116 28.

Speaker 3  45:39
Okay. But on the accounting impact, you're always keeping the variance and the standard, as separate line items just brought it makes more sense that way, then you don't have to worry about while there's probably a multitude of reasons what for that? Which is fine.

Matthias Miller  46:07
Yeah, I mean, the only real reason is, well, yeah, I mean, you know, there's a big reason. And if it makes more sense to collapse, collapse knees down.

Speaker 3  46:19
Well, this is the type of thing that once we trust that it's working, nobody's ever going to drill into this level of detail unless they suspect to problems. Exactly. Good. So then on eight, nine, we also have completed buildings, which is the labor portion for 45 coming across.

Unknown Speaker  46:44
And then we have production overhead, moving the cogs as well at $81. And then, finally, on the 15th, when we do the allocation for a we apply for production overhead. We, yeah, we were all $5.52. So we we increase increase the cogs or maybe decrease the cogs and I can

Matthias Miller  47:25
decrease it in this case.

Speaker 3  47:29
So if we, if we, if we had we looked at a an income statement the day before or before this update, then it would have moved five, the cogs would have decreased by 52. And our finished goods on the balance sheet would have increased by 52. Because we actually took too much out of the finished goods. So we're putting that that makes make sense. This if

Unknown Speaker  48:06
looks right to me.

Speaker 3  48:08
This is my inbox. Transactions are going to happen anytime that the building is built or invoice or we do apply costs. True.

Unknown Speaker  48:27
It's true.

Speaker 3  48:30
Like the part that makes me most, I mean, this is exciting to be where we're at. But how are we going to make sure that it how do we ensure that we're not? Right it's it's it continues to work or that it's it's working and it's being maintained accurately? The

Matthias Miller  48:57
answer to that, I think is regression testing. Where basically what we would do let's and I want to I want to add this here because I think it's pretty important to pursue this would actually be a good project for Josh.

Unknown Speaker  49:29
We're okay.

Matthias Miller  49:31
Investor tools faces this problem. And everybody likes to think that math is definitive and certain which it is sometimes. But if you're working on a bond, and you're, I mean, some of this stuff comes down to here is a model to calculate some kind of a value of a bond at a given point. I am not technical enough To know this, but it's not a definitive it's it's more about modeling and getting a number that is useful, most useful, and most closely reflects reality versus something that literally you can define as this is what it is. And one of the ways investor tools, so, and we've got clients who will painstakingly go through these calculation changes during an update, and they want to be able to say, well, this number shifted by this much, can you explain to me why, and so what investor tools has put into place is, they've got hundreds, maybe, I'm sure it's 1000s, maybe even more than that, of scenarios that run every single night. And what it does is, here's the trusted here are the trusted calculations. And then we're going to rerun those calculations, and they had better match. And if they don't match, then there's some kind of error report that gets triggered. And some developer has to go take a look at it. And either they say, yes, we've looked at this, take a look at this very closely, this change is actually good. Or they say, Oh, this is the problem. And we have to go fix some adjustments that we made to the calculation to get it to get it to where it needs to be. And so it's effectively a form of automated testing, for software. And so what I would envision us doing with the accounting impact, is we take some version of the, of the database of the, yeah, some version of the database, freeze it, and continually apply, calculate and apply accounting impact back to that, and make sure that every time that we apply it, we perhaps start with a blank system, we'd, we'd apply it once, make sure we like it, and then take it repeatedly take it through that applying process and make sure that it continues to produce the same results. And if at any point, it produces different results, then it hollers at us and we take a look at it something like that.

Speaker 3  52:06
Well, because what I'm most concerned about is that we have a definitive number say on the balance sheet for finished goods inventory and our cogs on an income statement for a period of time so that we can look at it and with confidence know like where are these numbers

Unknown Speaker  52:25
are coming from? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  52:35
Good, well, this is

Unknown Speaker  52:39
this is exciting, I think we're so, the changes did the required changes or the proposed changes on on this our winner those when do you anticipate these changes

Matthias Miller  53:07
this will be I tried taking it live now and then I realized that it actually requires an update. So, to be able to view these changes for sure by Tuesday to be able to actually apply these changes, I should have time this afternoon yet to automatically create these accounting trends to create the process to automatically create these accounting transactions. So if not Tuesday, then when I mean if not today then yeah, I will be able to have that as well. So that you can go ahead and automatically create create these transactions and look at the balance sheet and the income statement impact like through through actually have it pushed across to accounting I will not be able to do that for AP by them but at least for sorry, I will not be able to do that for AR by then. But we will be able to do it for buildings. So

Speaker 3  54:15
okay, what just making trying to make sure I understand what this update this next update does on FDI allocation is reporting but is it also impacting okay?

Unknown Speaker  54:37
Is it impacting accounting differently than what it what it does now? If we will right.

Matthias Miller  54:49
Call right now you right now you can't even apply it to accounting. I completely broke it and it's not working but it will be taking this Let me let me make one other adjustment and this might clarify on the diagnostic side exactly how this works. But what we'd be looking to do is

Unknown Speaker  55:15
our Li, then date

Speaker 3  55:20
diagnostics, where are these diagnostics? Or is it within the transaction themselves? I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  56:23
I don't even know if the main grouping is necessary anymore.

Unknown Speaker  56:41
Building now might be

Matthias Miller  56:47
okay, so what the diagnostic basically?

Unknown Speaker  56:56
What don't you like about me?

Matthias Miller  57:03
So, so basically, what we have now is the report that shows what transactions would be entered. So this would be one transaction with these line items dated on the third. This is one transaction with these line items dated on the eighth, this on the ninth is on the 15th. So, the only part that's missing is go create a transaction go create this transaction, well go make sure go sync this up with accounting. If there's a transaction there that shouldn't be there, go wait it out. And if there's a nutrient transaction that needs to be created, go create it if there's a transaction that needs to be updated, go update it. So that process does not exist yet. That's

Unknown Speaker  57:54
that's the only piece it's really missing. Why don't

Speaker 3  57:55
we what do we access or where will we access this diagnostics report?

Matthias Miller  58:03
It will be on the building accounting impacts

Speaker 3  58:09
and well that like obviously will have multiple buildings being built every day. But will that will it be separated for per building in the diagnostic mode,

Matthias Miller  58:25
in the diagnostic mode it is in the non diagnostic mode it's basically well it's actually oh hang on, I broke it in the in a non diagnostic mode, it just

Unknown Speaker  58:40
looks like this.

Matthias Miller  58:45
But then in the diagnostic mode it it breaks it out. So all the buildings will be grouped together sorted by this so if I do run it on all standards

Matthias Miller  59:04
then you'll see here this is building one, this is building two.

Unknown Speaker  59:14
This is building three etc. Well actually this is actually building this is actually building three

Matthias Miller  59:28
and then the diagnostic also shows the account subtype and the account parent. Give a little bit more visibility into

Unknown Speaker  59:36
the BS. Okay

Unknown Speaker  59:43
well, so

Speaker 3  59:46
looks like we're gonna have a bunch of testing come next week, Pastor advancement, financial FDI allocations, and accounts payable from what Josh showed us this morning. You can do test like we can, we can start doing testing on that. Today already right. So good.

Matthias Miller  1:00:18
I don't know what you guys think. But I think it's exciting to start seeing some of this progress.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:23
Yeah. No,

Speaker 3  1:00:25
I do. Yeah. It seems like there's Yeah. Me. Seeing this progress is exciting. So

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
good. Well, I, that's, that's all we had. So I had. Okay. Well, I think that's,

Matthias Miller  1:00:50
I think one of the questions, I think Josh will probably check in with you guys. But you know, one of the questions from the project management side on our end is, how you guys are doing on testing how much capacity and I think we'll keep pushing ahead, on our end, keep pushing stuff through, but yeah, just, I guess, keeping that in mind. As we're looking to hit the September 30, deadline on, there's gonna be a lot of testing in these next three weeks, if we're gonna get all of these projects pushed through by by September 30.

Speaker 3  1:01:32
And Europeans, which I think it's a valid concern is, is that we have enough capacity to test all of these to efficiently, right? Correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:43
So what

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
do you have any suggestions or options or?

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
flow we can we can test up as well as we can internally, but I think you have to have somebody like, Drew testing this stuff. You have to Yeah, I mean, you, you. Here's, there's, there's kind of two types of types of testing. One is one is like, technical testing, which is, did we do what we did? Does it do what we designed it to do? We respect it out to do, but then there's the integration testing or the end user testing, which is does this actually meet the accounting requirements and that has to be done by somebody like Drew I don't, I don't think there's any, there's anything like that, I think the main takeaway that I would have is we should have an eagle eye to a you know, protect drew from needless distractions as much much as possible be, we'd like to have as much heads up and then be as responsive as possible when there are issues that come up. So that so that so that the lack of fixes doesn't end up you kind of feel like we're getting we might be getting to the point where we're testing in your side could be the constraint of the project. And so basically, what we want to want to do is that we don't unnecessarily delay that on our end just keeping an eagle eye and get these fixes rolled out as fast as we can. Let's

Speaker 4  1:03:25
there was there is the, from the income statement or the balance sheet, there's the link to go to the ledger and that I'm getting an error coming in there where it's not wanting to fill in the actual account let me take a look

Unknown Speaker  1:03:59
so once again

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
that one is go to the balance sheet

Speaker 4  1:04:31
No, that's Yeah, like that. So then I just put in the account that I actually want it there, you know, finds it just fine, but

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
okay. I will

Matthias Miller  1:04:46
keep these open. These opens I can see where it is, and I will I'll chase that. Get that fixed for you by should be able to get that fixed for you by Monday as well. By Tuesday.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:06
Good anything else?

Speaker 3  1:05:10
The I received an invoice this morning's a bunch of five and $10 charges for little fixes. One of them was the again, we could have looked at it as well. But those two subtypes, reworked in all caps. I was just curious, has that actually been done

Matthias Miller  1:05:29
already? Quick, you know, that's just just some preliminary work that's been done on that. Basically, we're working on asset management fixes first and foremost, Cash Flow Report, Joel has designed all the parts up until the actual reporting and that's off to development. And he's now working on the actual designing the actual reporting piece, which will go for development. And then just based on based on conversation, I mean, based on what we could see the actual format of the income statement balance sheet where the lease contract would have the least impact that the cash flow has an impact on how you configure your chart of accounts. And so that's still scheduled to happen this month, but it's third in the queue for the stuff that Joel's managing and yes, those $5 adjustments are just various miscellaneous

Speaker 3  1:06:36
it's kind of exciting to see the development updates come through with do you get those true every Monday morning? I think it might be helpful if you do like you send out the automated development updates every Monday morning and you see foreign names on there working on

Unknown Speaker  1:07:02
cigar cigar

Unknown Speaker  1:07:04
announcing it right yeah, daily I

Matthias Miller  1:07:11
know that's the proposal

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
goodness I don't remember where it is.

Speaker 3  1:07:21
It's gonna be Monday I think Monday morning at like six or seven minutes

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38
until I

Matthias Miller  1:07:38
set it up I'm confused where I put it disabled to ask

Unknown Speaker  1:07:44
you to digest

Unknown Speaker  1:07:52
I'll take a look. Oh, AD and if

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
if it's helpful you're calling it so wiggly assist development update.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
Oh, I know what it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:15
Here we go.

Matthias Miller  1:08:19
It makes actually going to be BBC CB Okay, I'm gonna have to add you. Yeah, I'll add you as a contact get you added to this list. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:08:30
Good. Good. Then we'll look for that schedule from Audra. Today or tomorrow just

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
to make sure we're all same, so

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38
should be coming tomorrow.

Matthias Miller  1:08:40
Good. Okay, awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you.
