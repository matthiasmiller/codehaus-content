Unknown Speaker  00:51
Good morning

Unknown Speaker  00:58
been with us

Unknown Speaker  01:42
double check that

Speaker 1  01:48
marketing send some get an email, email make it a change to

Unknown Speaker  01:54
right I haven't seen anything come in

Speaker 1  02:44
well as the council has been saying that I don't have extra time to fix my counting

Unknown Speaker  03:09
Good morning

Unknown Speaker  03:10
wholesalers. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Do it minute spring

Unknown Speaker  03:29
Oh right.

Speaker 1  03:32
Mark's calling in or listening in with you listening and what are you doing right here? All right. Hey, Mark. Good morning. All right. Trying to think I don't have many. So I got started working on the building Impact Report. And making sure we handle variances appropriately, which we talked about, which basically means having a transaction having a transaction dated as of the date that the actual costs are applied, when the building is built, then we see credit to source account and debit the finished goods account. If it's accurate, it's built, we credit the source account and we debit the variance account

Unknown Speaker  04:35
we're going to do this work with the various backends

Speaker 1  04:41
it'll be in the same it's mapped to the same account so ultimately it'll go into the cogs expense. I probably shouldn't care this much but I still distinguishing between between the actual expense account the variance account for our purposes so that we can Yeah.

Speaker 2  05:03
Was that Matthias, you said, you think we should? should not put it to the same account?

Speaker 1  05:08
No, it's fine. If you do, I'm just internally keeping those two separate, separating the the two accounts. from a coding perspective, and I'm still keeping support they sit, let them be separate. I think in some ways it makes it makes more sense. Well, it's 61 and a half dozen of the other, but I think conceptually makes it a bit more sensitive to keep those separate. And it's pretty much ideological, and it's no practical implications. So

Speaker 2  05:47
well, we could do that. I mean, at least to get started, I don't know.

Speaker 3  05:54
You're saying keep that you're getting them separate in the cost? thing? Yeah. If we put the same account in there for the variance, that doesn't make any difference? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:05
it's fine to give the same account for the variance. It doesn't make any difference to me.

Speaker 2  06:12
And we see the difference, or can we, if we do a reconciliation, we'll be able to see the transaction. Like the variance transactions, basically, how far off we were.

Speaker 1  06:28
The various transactions will also show up on the basis you applied actual costs.

Speaker 2  06:37
One of the days that we applied actual cause, which is okay, we changed that logic to say, Great, thank you. That date is is typically the the last day of the period that we're reconciling Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  07:01
Um,

Unknown Speaker  07:05
let's do this. FTR as we go into this guy,

Unknown Speaker  07:15
we did because he just

Speaker 1  07:30
you would have to currently, when you apply those costs,

Unknown Speaker  07:35
this dental that

Speaker 1  07:41
currently defaults to today. We could change it to default to the exterior end date. That would be that would make more sense.

Speaker 2  07:54
Yeah, if it would default to the Okay, should it be the last day probably shouldn't be the last. So here we go. Period and date is 531. I think most times that's what we're going to want to not want it to show six one. Right? Like because that's that's the Yeah. Let me

Unknown Speaker  08:18
make a note here before a

Unknown Speaker  08:32
student goes on

Speaker 3  08:44
you want to talk with everyone because you'll want all those variants on the balance sheet and

Unknown Speaker  08:52
the income statement for that

Speaker 2  09:00
so the only change we're making is the default. So that true only to remember.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Yeah. You're just getting that point as mine I think if we can reduce that.

Unknown Speaker  09:17
Just getting to that place of getting it in there.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
Okay, good. Noted. So are

Unknown Speaker  09:33
we doing should we be testing? What should we be doing with with FTI testing currently? Well, currently, unfortunately,

Speaker 1  09:49
there's very little for you to set up so I'm hoping to have something for you to test by Friday. You know, at least on the building side of things. Pretty All still being able to have that report show up correctly. I'm not all the way there. So sadly, there's not. There's really nothing you can do at this point.

Speaker 2  10:14
And that's, that's good. We have lots of other things I believe, to work on. So but just Yeah, great. Well,

Speaker 1  10:22
I think this is the game game of, I don't know what exactly it is. But maybe you're not the one that people are waiting.

Speaker 3  10:37
One question about this. So I was putting costs into our SDM companies shutdown manual company in the accounting side, can we push buildings from shed time into sort of a manual company?

Speaker 1  11:01
Yes, to do that, you will have to create a new FGI allocation record that was initiated by manual company and accounts. Well, I mean, you can't do it yet, but you will be able to.

Speaker 3  11:16
Right. Right. And so those buildings should be available if I just make that allocation. No, that

Speaker 4  11:23
was over there. Yep, you got allocations, apply the action costs

Speaker 1  11:31
you should all just work work smashingly awesome. Leave things in life like that. Yeah.

Speaker 2  11:49
So through with that you could you should be able to do all your testing on that.

Speaker 3  11:55
On that shutdown, man. Yeah. Yeah, we'll keep it out of the actual Yeah. accounts for that company.

Speaker 2  12:05
But how do you move like how do you move those building and building into shit time manual like if they're in the shed time company, but how would you be doing that we'll update the billing records like what each individual building right does it do create duplicate of that of each building

Speaker 1  12:29
on can't have separate actual costs between sheds having said that

Speaker 2  12:38
yeah, we have separate actual costs but the buildings like do we have two sets of building records one on the shared time company and one on the shared time manual? And maybe you

Speaker 1  12:54
know, you'll have to you'll have to figure out what actual costume to use and push that over technically, what you could do is you can go apply dead time manuals actual cost, push that over and then apply the ship time actual cost. And just if your actual costs are different between the two accounting companies then just just make sure you know which actual costs are applied to the building and you push it over think we allow that

Speaker 3  13:42
we would create the shed time allocation last would that if there is a difference? Would it just be why the differences the variance just like before and so are our variance numbers off of standard costing would be the wrong of course but we would have still have the right amounts tied to those buildings. Right final cost

Speaker 1  14:19
Yeah, if you would, correct so if since I've manual has the correct actual cause, you apply that to to the buildings, you push that across this entire manual obviously since I mean it's fine. Then you just got across to your main shed time accounts. And correct your your shutdown account might not zero out because of differences in your actual costs. That will be but it should balance out where your variance and your stuff petrol costs are offset by the same amount. Well, I mean, obviously, would this is the counting? Silly statement? But

Unknown Speaker  15:09
yeah, that's the

Speaker 1  15:11
road. So if I'm understanding correctly, the answer is yes, that would work.

Speaker 2  15:17
You're using the manual set time manual. We're using that to create our to find what our actual costs incurred were. And then we're going to take that number of 50,000 for production labor, and apply that on the main company, learn well done, can you talk to you as soon as possible? Today,

Speaker 3  15:42
I was thinking we would make we would, we would do the allocation Showtime menu. But then that the reason we're doing it in the manual is to make so that we're not messing up the actual shutdown of company records. But if we're going to apply those variances to those building records, and then

Unknown Speaker  16:17
we'll be we can blank out. If you if you need me to

Speaker 1  16:25
think it's kind of up to you what you want to do on the accounting side. I think regardless, we're going to, we were open to the possibility of just deleting everything, all transactions in the accounting companies, we need to start over. And even on the building record, if you need to, kind of unapplied those actual costs from the billing records at any point. That's fine. We can it's not we don't really have a way for you to easily do that. But yeah, I can go in and, and clear those out for you.

Speaker 3  16:57
Well, we might just have to do it that way, though. Or we can actually do our stuff in the shutdown manual and I'll have to do is come back and

Speaker 2  17:04
look at what those costs are those totals and I think that should work. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
I mean, that's sounds great to me.

Speaker 2  17:14
Now, you've already applied some fictitious actual costs. Prior

Unknown Speaker  17:23
do we

Speaker 2  17:25
Okay, no, that was for that was an earlier pick time period. We're

Speaker 1  17:29
looking at a later July. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:33
July so

Unknown Speaker  17:34
yeah. Okay, we're I think we're good on that. So just a quick note in the size we have Josh called

Speaker 2  17:44
hour ago, and he has some accounts payable stuff that he wants to walk to show through where he's at with that. We scheduled that for 1030 which is coming up here in 10 minutes. And the other thing that we are you'd mentioned asset management should be live with the next update I'm assuming that has happened I was Drew and I looked at it for about 10 minutes before this call so

Unknown Speaker  18:17
I don't know is that can you show us the the basics of that and then if you get time to you could probably will probably poke around with this until our taking call this afternoon I mean

Speaker 1  18:43
the singles is probably about as well documented in the

Speaker 1  18:54
year let me actually I should have updated the test system so you can play around with this

Unknown Speaker  19:00
so

Speaker 1  19:00
after you say is there a is there an asset up or what company are you going to be adding assets under

Unknown Speaker  19:11
probably start with

Unknown Speaker  19:13
of don't know

Speaker 2  19:16
our thought was to test in one and then work on setting all up for all three so

Speaker 1  19:23
Okay, well we'll we'll do this we can delete this guy after you save it name they put in service so it needs a name

Unknown Speaker  19:36
and it was put in service on nine one so once you put it into service

Speaker 2  19:48
station we have is is from our is from your design proposal after changes proposed by Joel so I think I think most This seems pretty straightforward.

Unknown Speaker  20:05
Why not have expense accounts for this?

Speaker 1  20:18
We did not take this through our standard testing yet. So well, you can't actually select these, these

Unknown Speaker  20:26
have any asset accounts in there

Unknown Speaker  20:31
that you don't believe to be this depreciation is,

Unknown Speaker  20:34
right. I mean, that's we got

Unknown Speaker  20:38
ran past

Speaker 1  20:42
I need to take a look into what's going on there. We also have, you know, we have the asset classes, which specifies useful life in years. And you would have to define before you use this little ellipsis, and I don't know that, oh, here it is, under accounting configuration, you can get to two. And you can do a news transaction for the sale, I thought there was supposed to be a link for the which which should have the use the remaining balance?

Speaker 1  21:22
I'm not seeing the link to create a new purchase transaction.

Speaker 2  21:30
Man, I think the according to the design proposal would be linked to the actual purchase in the accounting system.

Speaker 1  21:39
Yeah, so basically, what you would actually do is I don't mean, this is not the right account, this is a debit and $5,000 and you haven't bank credit for $5,000, this would normally automatically get created from the vendor invoice and where we were at, we might want to talk about that this afternoon. But then you would assign the that's the wrong one, you would assign this line item to the forklift asset. And then when you come under here, it recognizes that transaction and sees the cost us $5,000. And the depreciation would start calculating based off of

Unknown Speaker  22:31
off of that

Speaker 3  22:37
though, you have to create the asset and then you can create the transactions and apply them to that so.

Unknown Speaker  22:48
So we don't really have a way to

Speaker 1  22:55
if you I mean, think effectively what you're gonna have to do, let's say that you have some kind of opening balance equity or something on other asset, I think what you just ended up doing is do a GL entry from asset to asset allocate. Like this one was purchased, let's say, July 1 was our go like date, then, and we would have had some kind of other, I don't know, I don't know exactly how you're planning to do it. But opening balance equity or something like that too quick to get your initial balance on the asset, you would then just do a GL entry to the debit and credit of the asset value. And

Unknown Speaker  23:43
will probably just be at an equity account

Unknown Speaker  23:50
that's fair, right?

Speaker 1  23:55
I don't know. Sorry. I'm not an accountant. But it's something like that. And if that proves to be just inordinately complex, then we'll talk and I think you'd also have to take into account depreciation to date, you know, original asset value, depreciation to date is

Unknown Speaker  24:26
so I mean, is it premature for us to be testing this?

Speaker 1  24:31
Well, it looks to me like I'm gonna go ahead and delete this. Okay. It looks to me like we've got issues with this. So I don't know how you can

Speaker 3  24:42
we actually have a depreciation somebody has or we even have a depreciation expense account. Yeah, we do.

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Those but we'd have to look for sure.

Speaker 1  24:56
I'm gonna go into you give me about a minute with

Unknown Speaker  25:00
have accumulated depreciation accounts

Speaker 4  25:11
and expense

Speaker 1  25:28
Okay, so well let's take a look at your counseling. So, first of all Barnes and Noble search for

Unknown Speaker  25:43
offset

Unknown Speaker  25:46
accumulated depreciation

Speaker 2  25:48
should be one in production overhead should have depreciation and then

Unknown Speaker  25:55
Yeah, ya like it was one

Unknown Speaker  25:57
appreciation rolling stock.

Speaker 1  26:00
So this is a this depreciation is under

Unknown Speaker  26:03
bonds the man

Unknown Speaker  26:10
on under sales expense, so we're

Speaker 3  26:16
knowings all around buildings improvement appreciation is the issue.

Speaker 1  26:23
The issue is we're expecting a subtype of depreciation

Speaker 1  26:33
so we can either I mean, we can let you assign, I think one option would be just letting you assign it to any type of expense account. And ignore the subtype.

Unknown Speaker  26:51
If you want to,

Speaker 2  26:53
well, some of them would be expense accounts, others would be like the ones on the balance sheet on production overhead with the on the balance sheet. area.

Speaker 1  27:06
So you actually just want a full list of all accounts and just choose where you want it to go.

Unknown Speaker  27:13
I think so it's so this is

Speaker 3  27:18
some of the finished goods. And from there, they'll move to cost of goods, some of expenses.

Unknown Speaker  27:25
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  27:30
We'll take the handcuffs off, let's do whatever you want.

Speaker 2  27:37
So does that mean? Does this need to go through an update cycle? Or is it something you're doing? Okay. But should we know that we

Unknown Speaker  27:51
can we put the assets in once. Without that

Speaker 1  27:56
you can still put the start putting the assets in for sure. You can try it out to expenses, you could start creating the transactions that get the get these initial values and you can put into asset classes. It's just that you can't do the allocation to

Speaker 2  28:16
one, one thing I noticed on the asset class record, I thought we were going to so we have the assets class, we have useful life. I thought we were also planning us to go to salvage value there rather than on the each individual asset. That the reason I thought that would be helpful as like rolling stock, like forklifts or whatever if we, if we apply to use the useful life or the salvage value on a per asset basis, we're going to be had the potential be all over the place like one we're going to say, Can yours depreciate it to 5% another to two years later we'll say 15 years I think

Speaker 1  29:10
so your salvage value as a percentage, I was thinking of it as $1 value. So the dollar value here would be based off of the percentage of the

Unknown Speaker  29:22
of the cost on the asset class.

Speaker 2  29:26
Yeah, which that could create some problems on entering existing assets. Depending on how we do transactions,

Unknown Speaker  29:38
is there gonna be an override button or something?

Speaker 2  29:43
I'm thinking keep us consistent. To keep the consistency in the asset class records will have useful life and a salvage value as the percentage of The initial purchase price

Speaker 1  30:06
all right and then then do we need a checkbox or something that says overwrite asset salvage value that lets you stomp in

Unknown Speaker  30:18
games candied apples on the individual

Unknown Speaker  30:22
or individual asset.

Unknown Speaker  30:26
I don't know what to do

Speaker 3  30:31
when we could just do a journal entry. Like we could put in the original value thing, and then we could journal not sure how it would work. Yeah, well, well, we could journal out

Unknown Speaker  30:50
all that value that's

Unknown Speaker  30:50
already behind. Smile journal at all our

Unknown Speaker  30:59
budget for the four

Unknown Speaker  31:07
we can do

Speaker 1  31:13
one question, you only need acid and expense accounts here. Right? I mean, I can't see any other revenue equity and liability don't make sense but

Speaker 3  31:28
right, that should be done. Ya. Because it will not would not go directly the cost of goods from here?

Speaker 1  31:58
I'm not sure I understand the full details. Well, I think you guys have a meeting with Josh, I actually have another meeting that I need to drop off. Where can we? I'm going to are we still good for 130 this afternoon?

Speaker 2  32:15
Yeah, we should meet so hopefully we can get that thing and have Yeah, pick this up again. 130.

Speaker 1  32:21
All right. I'll check with Joel about using expense in any expensive asset accounts. And are you guys good? comfortable enough with the salvage value percentage on the asset classes to go ahead and just run with that? Does that need further discussion?

Unknown Speaker  32:42
Yeah, I'm comfortable with that.

Speaker 4  32:47
Alright, sounds good. We'll talk then. Thank you.
