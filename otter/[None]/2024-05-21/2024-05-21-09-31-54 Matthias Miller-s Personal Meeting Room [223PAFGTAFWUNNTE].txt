Speaker 1  00:21
Katie has just come to you with your restore and says Are you done today? Well, he left me a voicemail I think in regards to transit, which is going to be scheduled for delivery today

Speaker 1  00:40
oh, wow was Yeah. My last name is Peter saying let us forgive her storage sheds. Okay sounds good.

Speaker 1  01:03
Salad Hey How many is that? Shouldn't be 10. Perfect. Alex, when you say transm I thought it was just one and I was like, Oh, it should be 10. Yeah, as long as

Speaker 1  01:27
perfect. Yep. And I will have a chat ready for and when he comes.

Speaker 1  01:36
934 34 Okay, sounds good. And Did y'all get our tax exemption? I think about that in last time.

Speaker 1  01:52
I will have that check. Ready? When do you think you'll be here?

Unknown Speaker  02:04
Okay, yeah, I'm available.

Speaker 1  02:11
Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  02:21
All right. You want to do this? Do you want to join and connect? So you get screenshare? You can follow along or the we got a list put together as we just want to just go through here?

Unknown Speaker  02:39
Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker 2  02:41
All right. All right. Yes, so let's, let's just run through this.

Unknown Speaker  02:54
Tell me to give a little bit of a structural overview.

Unknown Speaker  02:56
Yep. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  02:57
No, that's fine. The attention here is we're just reviewing where we are right and making any adjustments as we need to, is that what we're what we're planning on for this meeting with ice? Yep. Okay, sounds good. So, if you haven't seen this before, even if you have our overall goals are here. And so number one goal is to grow revenue by 50% in 2024. So as you start to look at this to hopefully make it clear, this would be our first objective is the monthly target breakdown. And so the tasks that go underneath this objective are basically the deliverables or whatever we need to do to make happen to get to this monthly target breakdown. So there's a little bit of logic in the in the layout. So if we start at the top and say, our goal is to grow revenue, then we can start up here, the first objective is the monthly target breakdown. And then two, we just go through the list, then how do you want to dig down through the list? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:55
let's just go down through the list. Okay. Sounds great.

Speaker 3  03:57
So as far as the monthly target breakdown, goes the spreadsheet for creating monthly targets for 2024. How is that task going? happening?

Unknown Speaker  04:07
We've got that done. Okay, great.

Speaker 3  04:11
Is there anything we need to put here that hasn't been put here?

Speaker 2  04:15
Or you're not aware of anything? No. So

Speaker 3  04:19
I think generally, we're actually we've completed that objective. Okay, great. Yeah. Overall, monthly reports. Set up monthly reporting, including all important KPIs.

Matthias Miller  04:31
Okay. So I, I need to have a let me let me let me do this. We need to have an email account a user storage should email account set up for Jamshed and he he's a guy who's going to be

Matthias Miller  04:56
for him, Jamshed just J am SHPD okay

Unknown Speaker  05:07
okay

Speaker 3  05:14
good. I can fill in some of this stuff later so don't spend time on it. Did we figure out who's responsible for creating and maintaining the KPI tracking spreadsheet?

Matthias Miller  05:23
We're gonna do liquor studio so that's irrelevant.

Unknown Speaker  05:27
Okay

Unknown Speaker  05:32
so liquor studios taking over the spreadsheet Yes. Okay

Speaker 3  05:43
sure I spelled that right but okay, can update that great email account set up for Jamshed What else do we need to do for monthly reporting

Matthias Miller  05:56
all right and then there should be a let's do two sub points one is a liquor studio for Google ads and which should be assigned to me and then a liquor studio for HubSpot which would be delegated to Jamshed.

Unknown Speaker  06:26
Okay that look right yep.

Unknown Speaker  06:31
Okay sounds good

Unknown Speaker  06:38
technical improvements or startup tasks are we got anything else

Matthias Miller  06:45
I would so try to think if there's anything that we really have I don't think there's anything really current at this point the website speed I think is the website speed is about as is is I think we take into that about as far as we're going to equal time being okay

Speaker 3  07:14
great, this will be an ongoing objective I assume so I won't close it out per se right now.

Matthias Miller  07:20
That's a good spirit. I think I don't know if this false enter under. Yeah, I think I think this is right. Okay.

Speaker 3  07:33
Sounds good. So we're not going to wind up doing this Okay. Sounds good. All right. Number two is marketing improvements. So we've got track and report marketing improvements we don't have any tasks under that at the moment would you like to add any

Matthias Miller  08:03
Goody This is orderly in your court the little mini Facebook ads then as

Unknown Speaker  08:10
far as I'm sure to that's operating as we want it

Matthias Miller  08:12
continuing to get those things is it Kyle are calm working with I think it'd be it'd be good to capture this one is work with Kyle to to get Facebook lead posting to increase lead flow at lower cost

Unknown Speaker  08:35
okay

Matthias Miller  08:38
the other one and that would be in Cody's court.

Unknown Speaker  08:42
Okay.

Matthias Miller  08:44
The other one we

Matthias Miller  08:53
review website conversion rate

Unknown Speaker  09:01
okay that for you.

Matthias Miller  09:08
Yeah, I might just send an email to Okay. Do you know when you remember when that went live? Cody was not the better

Unknown Speaker  10:00
I believe that it went live

Speaker 1  10:07
I don't know the exact date and it went live. But I do know that it was a customer use development. That bill was sent to me on the ninth. So I'm guessing that they had that done. Between the sixth eighth of my conversation on that one.

Speaker 3  10:28
Talking about me. Yes, sir. You're fine.

Matthias Miller  10:38
Okay. I guess that's good enough. Yeah, I think and then also go to you, we're gonna have a conversation with with the shut app on Google app

Unknown Speaker  11:03
performance, yes.

Unknown Speaker  11:10
Yep.

Speaker 3  11:17
Looking good. Yep. All right, generate lead flow at 3% of Max or max total revenue. So we got a lot of tasks in here. Just figure out how many of them are actually still. We find an accept the baseline lead flow for 2023.

Matthias Miller  11:35
You got that base of projections, you can close out

Speaker 3  11:40
the initial the initial marketing process audit to capture tasks and improvements.

Unknown Speaker  11:48
You can close that out.

Speaker 3  11:49
How about Facebook ads initial work out as well. get additional support on media buying.

Matthias Miller  11:59
Let's close that out.

Unknown Speaker  12:07
But a

Speaker 3  12:10
Yeah, okay. We're not doing cold email. So we've got campaign for hunting around bad experiences with tents. I think these were some ideas we threw in I'm not sure if these were actually going to be tasks. But you can tell me where you want to put on the guests.

Speaker 2  12:24
Oh, put them on on the backburner. Okay, we basically

Speaker 3  12:28
just going to kind of wait on any of those potentially.

Matthias Miller  12:35
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess that's up to you. That's up to you, Cody. Whether you're wanting to Evergreen, I guess I think you're going pretty well. You're going after evergreen types of of ads at this point. When you say evergreen, like non seasonal? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  12:51
At the time being. Yeah, that would be you know, any and all taxes are at this point. But like if we as we get closer to fall and Christmas, we can start seeing the whole targeting. Okay. Sounds good. And those that have access to our references? Awesome. Okay.

Speaker 3  13:16
Create a seasonal tab seasonal ads task and just kind of lump all those. Okay, give Dwayne access to Colorado Springs Facebook page. Yeah, that's done. Okay. Alternate lead sources we've got sub tasks we've got lists of property owners out of state appended with purchase purchase date

Matthias Miller  13:43
I think the whole this whole section most of the I think the most interesting part of this I don't know

Speaker 3  13:57
is this also a potential idea type

Matthias Miller  14:01
it is and I would be inclined to property owners in particular has I think isn't if if it if we do test it is more interesting to test around September October okay

Matthias Miller  14:29
okay and then for the other ones I think these

Matthias Miller  14:41
I think we just backburner the other three okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:47
That seems fair.

Speaker 3  14:55
Okay, good deal. Copywriting improvements was its own objective I believe and we'd have you'd said you follow them. But Marin, is there anything else that needs to know? Just close this out? Copywriting in general? Yeah. Okay. Great. Okay, we were on to sales improvements. We've got tracking and recording sales improvements. Is there a team dashboard getting put together?

Matthias Miller  15:23
This is this the jam ship task? Okay.

Speaker 3  15:30
So it's in progress, but it's going to go in Yep. Okay. Anything else that needs to go under here? No. Establishing metrics for high performance sales team. We've got the draft for ask for referral early and often.

Unknown Speaker  15:59
should probably talk about at some point. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:05
How about the metrics for the high performance sales team? Is it still in progress?

Unknown Speaker  16:09
It is in progress. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:13
Anything that needs to go under this at this point in time? Well, thanks. So decreasing lead response times we have SMS automation

Matthias Miller  16:24
that's broken again for Dave. Okay. But I'm inclined to wait until we can get him over to we're switching him up elsewhere.

Speaker 3  16:40
Okay, yeah. Where do we need to put anything under decreasing lead response times other than this task?

Matthias Miller  16:53
I don't think so. About sales. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:03
I think we should add some sub point to

Matthias Miller  17:14
include a dashboard metric for first outreach relative to the creation time

Unknown Speaker  17:24
you say that again? Sorry.

Matthias Miller  17:26
First outreach, okay. Relative to lead creation. Okay,

Speaker 3  17:32
so lead creation there we go. Did I put that in the right place? Or did you want to put this under the tracking and reporting? It could go under the well it's either one decrease of lead response time okay. Now that's fair. Okay. How about sales improvement implementation? We've got some closed stuff in here we've got don't default close date for new deals new deals sorry. Okay. About should we look at financing for on sites pull barns or referral for financing sources as

Unknown Speaker  18:13
you're considering new voicemail this is just a voicemail scripts like Hi Bill, I had a note here you might be looking at a shed Are we still working on voicemail scripts

Matthias Miller  18:33
can you give it a sales meeting agenda tag that have been floated past pass test again

Unknown Speaker  18:38
but I can make one

Speaker 3  18:45
There we go. Created the about review buildings on a weekly sales call.

Matthias Miller  18:56
I'm not sure exactly what it was after here you can work it out to do

Speaker 3  19:00
yeah okay no no it's it would be nice to have better sales training that is focused on selling products not just services.

Matthias Miller  19:13
This is probably also back to do there just really isn't that many great it's an idea can go into the idea category but there's not really any great

Unknown Speaker  19:30
okay.

Speaker 3  19:34
Pushing deadline date to HubSpot for two week warning review.

Unknown Speaker  19:40
This would have to be coming from the shed app I don't know that they're going to do

Unknown Speaker  19:45
talk about today's

Matthias Miller  19:49
video would be to once the sale is closed and to have shut out order information have shut up sinking. Okay, The Big Blue Sky ideal world would be when you when you sell it on shut app, it pushes the closes the deal pushes the closed day pushes a deal value and pushes the deadline day over. And then if we have a deadline date in there, we could have a two week warning LTB

Speaker 1  20:21
because I said I'm gonna say they do have the two week automation but they set that up themselves.

Matthias Miller  20:24
Yeah. But I don't think this is within this is within scope. Shut up to that go do it and we're not going to do it. So I think this is a I think this is a not to do. Okay, we've got to we've got a good enough work around now.

Unknown Speaker  20:47
Okay, sounds good. But can we do for note taking for the sales team, especially de voiced Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

Matthias Miller  21:03
Do you think it's worth getting him set up with Google Voice on his computers that you could take notes and HubSpot typing it out?

Speaker 1  21:14
Maybe was talking about that obviously, is that just kind of join the call?

Unknown Speaker  21:21
It'd be it'd be after the call.

Speaker 1  21:28
That's something that can be elicited from all weekend. You take notes on?

Matthias Miller  21:32
Well, they've got they've got the HubSpot has the AI center no fees. No Dwayne's using the AI transcription or summarization, but I don't know if Dwayne is or Davis. We could we could I mean,

Speaker 1  21:49
if if explains using in essence so within HubSpot, yeah.

Matthias Miller  21:54
Let's let's change this to the sales team meeting agenda to make sure that make sure Dave knows how to use the AI summarization. Okay.

Speaker 3  22:12
We'll update that task. See.

Speaker 3  22:21
Okay, good deal. And when we go through this again next month, I will filter out the complete tasks since it's the first time we're doing it. I left everything in just add a could not connect call disposition.

Speaker 2  22:46
In this position, none of those three are done. Okay. The dispositions

Speaker 3  22:53
box hold this position. Okay. There you go. There we go. Okay. Figure out how to get emails going out appropriately for new leads.

Matthias Miller  23:04
I think what we've Yeah, that's done. Okay. We've got a test to do it.

Speaker 3  23:12
Move. Left voicemail, no answer to the top.

Unknown Speaker  23:16
This is done. Okay.

Speaker 3  23:23
Okay, and then you should all be done, I believe. Sales improvements. Great. Okay, production. Moving on. track and report customer success. Consider repairs with pressure treated posts. sure where that belongs. Just have one there

Matthias Miller  23:48
we go, that's just something that came in came up in conversation somewhere along the way, about a common cause for repairs and I don't know that. To me. It's outside of scope. It just kind of captured it for

Speaker 1  24:03
repairs have dwindled as flooded they're not as common anymore. They I think they've been better on that. There's still a few that some of them are legitimately just one. Okay. One day studs was Jamie put in studs that clearly should not have been used

Unknown Speaker  24:22
better. Yes. So

Speaker 1  24:24
he's actually doing that right now. pressure treated post that's kind of the porch something I came up with

Matthias Miller  24:32
a book but that is not not to do. Okay. We're done. We it's

Speaker 1  24:38
very uncommon. They're so bad that we have to replace them every once so often as a standalone post. It can work. But yeah, it's true. To learn 300 buildings.

Unknown Speaker  24:48
Yeah.

Speaker 3  24:51
Is the intention of this to have Is there a way to track common customer complaints was that the was at the idea here?

Matthias Miller  24:59
Are they out Because I think if we're talking dashboards and ways to monitor I think an ideal thing would be to monitor how many quality reviews we get out the backside. Okay,

Speaker 1  25:12
that I've seen we've been getting a lot of good reviews I think in the last two months we've done three to four or five star reviews.

Speaker 3  25:19
Okay. Is that customer success? Anyway? Where would that be? Yeah. Or is that still production?

Matthias Miller  25:30
The customer sucks Oh, it would be customer success. Okay. Tracking report Customer Success sounds like a tracker like a customer success thing not a production thing right.

Speaker 3  25:43
So I production we had clarified was the Meet promise dates. So one promise dates must be accurate to inventory must be managed meet production deadlines. And then customer success was turned customer satisfaction into consistent public online reviews to meet marketing goals. I don't know I think what you just said actually probably does fall under production. Right? Or, I mean, are you trying to? are you monitoring reviews for production problems? Or just for general satisfaction?

Matthias Miller  26:13
No, no, what we want? I mean, what we're looking for is I view this as an extension of marketing in some sense. So how many happy reviews are we getting out?

Speaker 3  26:30
Yeah, okay. So I would say customer success then yes. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  26:35
It would be under production to track and report Customer Success should go under.

Speaker 3  26:41
Let's duplicate that might just be a duplicate let me see what's in the project plan did I just messed that up? When I was track and report customer success? I don't know. That's what we called it. So what should we be tracking and reporting? Actually production

Matthias Miller  27:02
Yeah, I mean, this requires a follow up conversation. Okay, if when how weather etc. But yeah, guess what it would Okay, the I mean, the the foundational premise is we're we're telling our salespeople to make promises we're making customers happy by meeting promises that's the end the production is the how of making promises or keeping raise the house keeping promises

Speaker 3  27:44
so the interplay between the two basically here if salespeople are making promises that production can't deliver on then that's what we need to find. Yep. Okay. Yep, makes sense. So we had quote accurate promise dates under here so we had build building status and deadline dates can we scrape and pull a report on these

Matthias Miller  28:10
I think that's an interesting but not super high priority thing to take a look at okay

Speaker 3  28:19
just leave it as is as low than questions were coded as production see the promise states and why is the promise stayed out so far? I

Matthias Miller  28:27
think that does production see is the only relevant question yes you do. Yeah, you can close that out.

Speaker 3  28:33
Okay great so think we're below can be just kind of apps that loves to tell me what I just did. I don't know if I can turn it off customer success then so tracking reporting on Customer Success monitor how many quality reviews we get out the backside I just added and then track buildings completed by promise date. Are we working on this one?

Matthias Miller  29:09
We need to this is an idea that we need to make sure that we're actually wanting to do Okay,

Speaker 3  29:15
is it a meeting agenda discussion?

Unknown Speaker  29:20
Cody and I just carry okay.

Speaker 3  29:26
Okay, second one is create a guideline for post sale follow up deliver email template with Tom's number.

Unknown Speaker  29:34
Add this to the it

Speaker 1  29:36
was already in the order that they sign on sign that paperwork that they get that is on page three. Brilliant. That's great.

Speaker 3  29:45
All right, well, I'll just say it's done. Consider post delivery follow up call by the salesperson.

Matthias Miller  29:52
We've got that in the follow ups between sale and delivery. We've also got

Speaker 3  29:59
great Was there any documentation that needed to happen there? Or is that? Have we created the guideline for post sale? Follow up? Is that done? Question? Or do we say it's in progress?

Matthias Miller  30:20
I don't think there's any

Matthias Miller  30:27
we need to know we should document the deadlines. Yeah, we should

Unknown Speaker  30:34
document the wet and catch them. The

Matthias Miller  30:36
post sale follow up process. Okay.

Speaker 3  30:43
Okay, sounds good. I guess that might tie into the creating accountability for the post sale follow up. We don't actually have any subtasks under this one right now. Do we need to add any

Unknown Speaker  31:01
issues?

Speaker 1  31:01
What kind of things how we can tie that information to whether they can get it quickly?

Unknown Speaker  31:12
Would it make sense to drag the document that actually,

Speaker 1  31:14
it's a lot of seems like access communication?

Unknown Speaker  31:19
Will they have visibility? Do they have a

Speaker 1  31:22
delivery page waiting to give them access to be differentiated? So make them drivers as well? Which I don't know, but I mean, if but that's the thing, the delivery schedule has not been accurate, either. I've seen someone who's had some schedule one some days, and they don't go out that day, or vice versa, where he does a lot that day, but it's not scheduled. So it's rather difficult to correct that 100% accurately.

Matthias Miller  31:52
Although there was some kind of change recently where they said that they can get access to or they can start seeing so Tom stuff.

Speaker 1  31:59
Not from my knowledge on this assertion something that I know about which I mean, if they can, it's not hearing anything, I'm fine with that. But I didn't change anything. I'm very good.

Matthias Miller  32:16
Let's, I'm not sure of the how, at this point, we want to do this. I would. I think it's something that ideally would still happen, but requires some thought, I don't know.

Speaker 3  32:30
Okay, I will leave as is for now. Let's see we have a couple dangling here. Consider matching leads on phone numbers, that probably belongs somewhere. Let's see sales improvements. Maybe? Yeah, unless it's done already.

Matthias Miller  32:50
Unless it's done already. I'm not sure what the Do you have context for that?

Speaker 3  32:56
Let's see. There's a attachment maybe.

Speaker 3  33:07
Or it was just an email that you sent me with that subject line. So it's a blank attachment? Oh no, it looks like maybe it was just a single line

Matthias Miller  33:16
market is not to do and if it

Unknown Speaker  33:22
seems fair. Does this property radar thing belong here?

Matthias Miller  33:30
That should be under the alternate lead sources. Okay. task

Unknown Speaker  33:40
which was under marketing improvement. I was looking at lead sources. Okay. I gotcha.

Matthias Miller  33:51
Later, related to the list of property owners with purchase data pinned.

Speaker 3  33:58
Okay, gotcha. Now, it'll take a little bit of a careful drag and drop so I'll do it after we're off the phone. And then for Yoda shed sales process in doesn't make a lot of sense does it?

Matthias Miller  34:22
I think it needs to be put incorporated into the sales process. You can say to me, okay, it would be part of the sales

Unknown Speaker  34:31
Should we add to the documentation? Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. I will also drag and drop that one are we looking at oh boy, hello, I'm sorry, computer Don't be mad at me. Establishing metrics, something like that. improvement in limitation.

Unknown Speaker  35:02
Improvement implementation.

Unknown Speaker  35:04
Okay, sounds good. Well, I think that's it then. Is there anything else we need to be looking at

Matthias Miller  35:16
I mean, this is all me this is all in Cody sport. You cool you're handling it but I do think we should just for the sake of documentation, track the Allah where migration is that is a bigger project that we're trying to get wrapped up and done.

Speaker 3  35:36
Where are we putting? That's marketing improvements, sales improvement, improvements, okay.

Speaker 3  35:48
Okay, is there anything we would want to specifically look at? Where did it go?

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Where did it go? That's weird. It's still there. Okay. Fair enough. Is there anything we need to look at?

Speaker 3  36:10
Under here? Anything specific you'd like to add is a milestone to click off the box or click off as a task or?

Speaker 1  36:24
Oh, go watch on that our migration? None other than just putting numbers over that. That's my hold up. I set that process in motion, but then it was rejected because there was some for billing telephone number that was incorrect. So I have to call and mitigate that. That's the task for today. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  36:48
no, that sounds good.

Speaker 2  36:54
Okay. All right. Well, I think, yeah, I think this does it for what we need here. Like

Matthias Miller  37:06
could you have like to chat a little bit about Big Picture priorities are on the same page there but keep things from falling through the cracks. Awesome.

Speaker 3  37:19
need me for anything else? That looks so great. All right. Well, I will talk to you guys later.
