fastest way to get out of your own head. As the leaders, when we're trying to delegate more effectively, it's easy to get caught up in, in a dialogue

Unknown Speaker  00:11
in our own head, that we don't

Unknown Speaker  00:13
get a

Speaker 1  00:14
clear picture of what we should be doing or how we should be changing our leadership to become more effective.

Speaker 1  00:24
It's really, it's, it's important to learn how to get out of our own head. And the fastest way to do that is to invite feedback from others

Unknown Speaker  00:34
would like to share two examples with you.

Unknown Speaker  00:38
First of all, as a leader,

Unknown Speaker  00:44
oh, let's see, hang on.

Unknown Speaker  00:48
As a leader, we're not

Unknown Speaker  00:49
always sure how we come

Unknown Speaker  00:49
across the team members. And,

Speaker 1  00:54
and a simple tactic that we can use is to invite feedback when we're delegating tasks to team members. And ask them

Unknown Speaker  01:04
how we're doing, if

Speaker 1  01:05
there's additional detail as they require, or if we're providing too much detail.

Unknown Speaker  01:10
For it is there ways that we communicate

Unknown Speaker  01:13
more effectively,

Speaker 1  01:16
building feedback into your team interaction.

Speaker 1  01:21
and allowing your team members to provide feedback on your leadership is a fantastic

Speaker 1  01:27
and allowing your team members to provide feedback about how they experience your leadership is a fantastic way of getting out of your own head.

Unknown Speaker  01:38
The second example is working with

Speaker 1  01:42
a mentor or business coach to enable you to get out of your own head and provide outside perspective.

Speaker 1  01:51
We none of us can see the things that we can't see. And we rely on other people to provide that perspective for us.

Speaker 1  02:04
My business coach recently pointed out and area recently pointed out a blind spot

Unknown Speaker  02:12
in my leadership,

Unknown Speaker  02:13
that

Speaker 1  02:18
that if left unaddressed, will, will threaten the long term, the longevity of the foundation that I'm actively building right now.

Unknown Speaker  02:32
He is also able to derive feedback,

Speaker 1  02:36
ideas, and is able to

Unknown Speaker  02:41
bring clarity and closure

Speaker 1  02:45
to situations or challenges that I face.

Speaker 1  02:54
As leaders, it's tempting to buy into the idea that nobody knows as much as we do. And that nobody understands the world that we live in. And while it's true that the challenges that we face are truly unique

Speaker 1  03:09
when we buy into that, why we run the risk of creating a world that exists only in our own head, and we disconnect ourselves from the reality of leadership.

Unknown Speaker  03:21
This week, let's commit

Speaker 1  03:24
to being open and transparent to inviting feedback, and doing whatever it takes to get out of our own heads so that we can make the impact that we were born to make
