Aha, epiphany and well, here's the reason why me because I'm uniquely suited to product development and this was my education. I've already paid the price for education. I knew the cost of what it takes to learn and I've been it was a result of this. I've been able to do all of these other things. And by the way, you can check out all the various projects and I specialize in solving these challenging problems that don't have definitive solutions.

And let's go have a conversation.
