I was listening to a pre Marshall roundtable discussion about the 27 year old who was in with circling the drain. And one of the things that Barry mentioned was that you can't do something meaningful if anyone can do it. And one of the things that hit me is that the way to get meeting on a team and to get a sense of belonging on a team is by contrasting what you do, and how you contribute, versus what the rest of the people contribute. And that's actually what gives you meaning. And that's what makes you stand out. I think one of the things that valuing people is valuing the things that are unique about them, it's been really interesting to watch to that I feel like I have a unique gift or unique perspective of being able to pull out things that are unique about people. And this is kind of what's your, what sets you apart, this is your fingerprint, this is your thumbprint. This is your DNA. And there's a kind of a prophetic side to it. But there's also,

Unknown Speaker  00:53
you know, a learn side to it as well.

Speaker 1  00:57
So that was thought number one. The other thought that I had was this whole thing about working with Josh and of course, I'd want to change the name and,

Speaker 1  01:03
and all of that, but working with him realizing that

Speaker 1  01:10
realizing that as a leader, you have to learn how to lead people the way they want to be led. And some people want to be led

Unknown Speaker  01:19
and want to work in

Unknown Speaker  01:22
different ways.

Speaker 1  01:25
Some people prefer working alone, some people working whatever, but like, it's a simple exercise. And it's actually it's actually really simple but it's also you know, can be challenging sometimes to get out of your head and start focusing not on how you would want to be managed but on how they

Speaker 1  01:43
want to and sometimes even have a need to be managed so

Unknown Speaker  01:48
yeah, very interesting. But
