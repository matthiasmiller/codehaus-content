Unknown Speaker  05:16
sir. How's it? It's going? Good.

Matthias Miller  05:21
Good. Exciting about sim biz.

Unknown Speaker  05:24
Yep. I mean, yeah.

Speaker 1  05:27
Now I need to do the drudgery of trying to document the incident. But hey, I'll try to get to that. There you see me?

Matthias Miller  05:36
There you are.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
So let's see. I'm

Speaker 1  05:50
trying to think what significant things were he was he was he sent me a voice message today. He was trying to figure out now is it does it? I think it was just kind of wondering, Will I mean, will we even be in the ballpark or not? And I said, well, the tough thing is we really need to do the design, high level design to figure out whether we can provide it in the application or whether they need a custom layer. But and I said, you know, if it's if it's in the application, this stuff is not complicated. This is not a lot of fields and data.

Unknown Speaker  06:24
Yeah. So.

Speaker 1  06:28
And I mean, I said, I, you know, I think it's more than 20,000. If it's in the application, you know, let's say 30 to 30 to 50. If it's in the application, and then obviously, if it's the custom layer, then then it may well be more than that. So that was helpful. And I don't know if but I said, usually, I mean, usually when I just do a spitball number, then all you know, that's the, you know, the top numbers two or three times as much as the bottom number, because it's just too hard to guess. And he understands that so. But he's at least willing to go ahead with design, and I said, there's no obligation. A well, and he was really appreciative, almost taken aback that we're offering it. Yeah, but really appreciative. And I was I told him, you know, well, I, there's, there's really two reasons why I'm in white, if we did that, first of all, we were interested in Sindbis. I mean, we, I've been interested in getting a growth ring started here and growth growth group and, and I, I'd really welcomed the opportunity of partnering with them in software. But, and, and even if it's not the right fit, and hopefully that just the experience itself will give them a sense of what it's like to work with us. But also beyond that, then they've done a bunch of work already to get to the point where they are today. So I'm hopeful that this will, you know, it won't be super tough to, to give them I mean, to do a high level design for them. So, I mean, I actually think, in some ways that the challenge is going to be more on figuring out how can we actually give them the user interface they need rather than gathering requirements?

Unknown Speaker  08:06
Right. So, um,

Speaker 1  08:11
and I said, and he was kind of wondering about schedule, I said, Well, you know, if you if schedule is critical, you may want to consider rubato. We are, you know, we're good at what we're doing. But we're not, I mean, but But we, you know, we, you know, we need to get on to Matthias, his calendar. And, you know, there's just a process here. And so I said I would, you know, if you're needing it. Well, I think it's reasonable to expect that we'd have a solution live this year, but it's not going to be in the next few months. Yeah. And he was okay with that. So, but I'm glad to have set that expectation. So I just think No, I just it's I just think that's we'll have to keep telling people that reminding people of that so there's a

Matthias Miller  09:13
song I came across yesterday. Yeah.

Speaker 2  09:19
And might be appropriate here. See if I

Unknown Speaker  09:29
don't know if it's gonna want to capture the sometimes

Matthias Miller  09:36
slow is the right speed.

Unknown Speaker  09:41
That's great. Oh, wow.

Speaker 2  09:45
Yeah, good. But I'm just, I'm, well, I'm really eager

Speaker 1  09:52
to see this thing go forward. So I mean, can you imagine and being able to put software in front of these people

Matthias Miller  10:03
of these guys. Oh, yeah, for sure. Um, you know, the other crazy thing that happened? Yes. December, you know me I do crazy things. Yeah, there's this company, this company called workplace prayer, and their team of intercessors. All they do is they just pray, pray for business. Wow. Wow. I hired them in December. That's great.

Unknown Speaker  10:28
So interesting.

Matthias Miller  10:31
Interesting. You can either do it as a tax deduction, or is there also marketing consulting? Or a consulting company? So you can also just write it off as a business expense if you prefer? Sure. So

Unknown Speaker  10:42
what is it workplace?

Unknown Speaker  10:45
Workplace prayer workplace.com.

Matthias Miller  10:50
website was just like, I looked at their website, and it was just like, I don't I

Unknown Speaker  10:53
don't you know, like, I don't even get ahead.

Matthias Miller  10:59
Maybe I'm missing something. I didn't see the FAQ and stuff. But I finally email it was like, how do I actually get started, like, posters were anyway. I feel like their websites a little. Yeah. Came through recommendations of a friend of mine. So also out of the Do you remember Dave Fisher with the shed yard?

Speaker 2  11:21
Hey, Fisher with the shed yard. He was in Colorado Springs. He airily

Matthias Miller  11:26
to cancel with him. I did a concert with him a long time ago. Well, he reached out to LinkedIn out of the blue and said, Hey, I'm starting a ship company. Eric talks about

Unknown Speaker  11:34
you. And

Matthias Miller  11:38
do you want to do you want to talk he's looking at tying together their 3d visualizer into panda doc, and their CRM, high level CRM basically doing a bunch of integrations? So it would be pretty much end up being a me gig. But he sure he made some kind of comment about me being hard to reach, get a hold of and hard to find. Find me Bailey messaged me on LinkedIn to get a hold of me.

Unknown Speaker  12:11
That's great.

Matthias Miller  12:13
I told him Yeah, I like working with a small number of clients. I'm not gonna apologize. Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 1  12:20
Interesting. So do you think it's gonna be a high dollar thing? Will it overwhelmed you or is it just exciting?

Matthias Miller  12:30
I'm not sure yet. Yeah, sure. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do discovery with him and figure out technology stack and what's actually going to be involved in and what the interesting thing is, he's in Pennsylvania right now. And so it could be an interesting avenue for

Unknown Speaker  12:47
additional consulting,

Matthias Miller  12:50
as well. And that's really the part of it. That's interesting to me more

Unknown Speaker  12:53
than straight up the tech.

Matthias Miller  12:57
Yep. But it sheds unlimited. I. There's some pieces I don't know exactly that have completely nailed down what parts of development I enjoy and what parts that don't Sure. But typically, integrations and automations are things, especially when I can build if I can build checks and balances around it. It's not something that I mind by incurably. So we'll see.

Unknown Speaker  13:24
Yeah, yeah. Good. Interesting. Yeah. Good.

Matthias Miller  13:30
Well, so for starters, we can get Ben to go through the mockups and start making that. Yes. The data that we were talking about? Yes, exactly. Exactly. I

Unknown Speaker  13:41
think that would be a great beginning point. And yeah. Let me do this.

Matthias Miller  13:57
Ch CC. Are you on the Cha Cha?

Speaker 1  14:00
Yes. Ch chat. Yes, I am. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:07
Simba is B. By the way, what is the prayer place cos

Matthias Miller  14:16
they get different levels, they have their 300 bucks a month plan depends depends. They basically say just go based on the size of your business. Like if you're just solo starting out, do 100 up to 300. And then

Speaker 2  14:27
they've got to oh, I forget what the higher higher number is. Yep. Interesting.

Matthias Miller  14:37
800 1000 or something like that. Oh, 500 I don't even know

Unknown Speaker  15:05
And then are you thinking

Matthias Miller  15:05
CCI just billing CCI straight? 3500

Unknown Speaker  15:09
are you wanting to

Matthias Miller  15:12
do some other type of arrangement?

Unknown Speaker  15:16
Um,

Speaker 1  15:17
that's a fair question. Let me think. I didn't know I wanted to keep moving things forward I figured I'll talk to you and ask how we should do it. The well it'd be 3500 minus 20%

Unknown Speaker  15:33
the so you're

Matthias Miller  15:36
well sure well remember there's no royalty Am I being

Speaker 1  15:40
there is no royalty intro vendor intro vendor No. Well it might depend on the invoice is set up actually.

Unknown Speaker  15:50
So we could

Unknown Speaker  15:52
we don't have to pay royalty intro vendor

Unknown Speaker  15:56
okay so

Speaker 1  16:31
I I'm just thinking out loud Would you would you consider doing this one on with your normal rates but on time and materials just I'm hopeful is less than 30 and I'm well first of all I moved ahead with it so I'm totally fine with you if we say you know the $2,800 or whatever

Unknown Speaker  16:56
and but

Speaker 1  17:00
if it's take significantly less Do you think there's it's likely to take significantly less than a normal high level

Speaker 2  17:06
are not necessarily you mean well, where it's like half as much time yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:16
probably not are anyway go ahead.

Matthias Miller  17:18
I don't I don't think it's half okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:23
I could be mistaken Sure.

Speaker 1  17:35
Okay, fair let's just do the 20 100 But then let's also take this into account a little bit with Well, I mean, this will be worked for band for one thing. And maybe when we talk through the details of covering band and covering this we can talk I mean, we can look at is that fair?

Unknown Speaker  17:54
Are we sure? The

Unknown Speaker  18:00
and we do we should talk about Ben Ben to

Matthias Miller  18:04
get that on my list. Perfect. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:30
Okay, I guess um, I mean if

Speaker 1  18:46
would you what would you how would you feel about just doing your time and materials but at your at your full rate?

Unknown Speaker  18:56
Good for rates.

Speaker 1  18:58
What was the work that you do for whenever you're, you're billing me for

Unknown Speaker  19:03
work. Well,

Matthias Miller  19:06
I'm billing you at 105 Still, okay. So no, I'm not doing it for that. Okay. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:16
I don't think that's I think that's I think that's too low. I mean, what's the pitch to

Unknown Speaker  19:34
the the,

Unknown Speaker  19:34
the pitch,

Matthias Miller  19:36
pitch to me. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:38
let's do 2800 Leeton and call it good. I'm fine with that.

Unknown Speaker  19:45
The cover? No.

Speaker 1  19:47
Yeah, because I took the game. I said I'd cover it. So let's just leave it at that.

Unknown Speaker  19:57
I mean, if

Matthias Miller  19:57
I would have given input I probably would have pushed back towards charging Something

Unknown Speaker  20:00
for it. Uh huh. But yeah, I don't

Matthias Miller  20:06
know. I'm happy to be argued with. I don't know exactly.

Speaker 1  20:11
Yeah. Yep. I'm the business owner, I'll I'll take the risk. I'm

Matthias Miller  20:16
comfortable with that. So.

Unknown Speaker  20:28
So the way you do that is

Speaker 1  20:33
well, easiest way to do that is just to is just to bill me a flat rate 2800 on one of your invoices, I think, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:45
I'll do that. Yeah, that'll work.

Unknown Speaker  20:48
What's your schedule like?

Matthias Miller  20:52
Well, most of it from now to the end of the week, the month is a tad crazy. February is

Speaker 2  21:02
probably an option. Sure. So it's a bit slower.

Matthias Miller  21:05
Yeah,

Speaker 1  21:07
I'll connect you up and you can work out details on schedule. I'd love to have the indepth done by do you think can we get the stuff done by the end of April?

Matthias Miller  21:19
Do you think? I don't know without asking Tim where he's out on his stuff. Okay. Okay. BBSes dragging along and

Unknown Speaker  21:27
right. What's happening with thinking right now?

Matthias Miller  21:33
Last I heard we were waiting on some updates to be able to deploy stuff. There was some double codes or something that is awesome emails about double codes and stuff that we

Speaker 1  21:40
were reading, but just just on the high level thing. What's we did phase one and two. And do you know, do you know what we're what they're planning what the plans are for three and four,

Unknown Speaker  21:54
or whatever. Okay, okay.

Unknown Speaker  22:03
So,

Speaker 1  22:04
and what does your overall schedule look like? We've got EVs here, and we've got to obviously affordable Barnes. What else is on on your on your plate

Matthias Miller  22:22
affordable ones for you like for the next couple of months? Okay. I mean, it kind of depends with I mean, I haven't barely been able to schedule a call with Mark because he's tied down with other stuff. He wanted to wrap up some last pieces and we barely been able to talk I know that assistant stuff is going to take my time.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
What stuff assistant stuff right? Yep. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  23:16
So I mean, it's moderately open. It's not December at least some of it was horrible.

Unknown Speaker  23:30
Okay,

Speaker 1  23:31
okay. So I'm, well, I'm trying to think where do I look when I want to see what are high level designs, upcoming high level designs and upcoming in depth designs.

Unknown Speaker  23:45
See if

Unknown Speaker  23:51
we see what we get here. Okay, we're doing

Matthias Miller  24:00
there's, well, we don't have any high level designs. I don't know that we even have any in depth designs at this point. Okay. We have here's Tim's calendar. He's got phase three and up design and was aiming to start phase four on the 24th Okay,

Speaker 1  24:18
so he's okay. So this is what I was looking for. So Z TK is coming up right away. Okay. What does he have for February?

Unknown Speaker  24:28
Nothing at this point. Okay. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  24:35
Um, great. So.

Unknown Speaker  24:49
So we do need to be praying in business, don't we? Now, the,

Speaker 1  24:56
the and from my side of things I have Have the just on the development side. I've got the accounting thing right now. And all I really hope we land TVs that would be a blow if we wind. But yeah. And then that ties, that's going to be a big one. A big, huge but but it's not tiny either.

Unknown Speaker  25:22
Yeah. And

Unknown Speaker  25:24
okay, okay

Unknown Speaker  25:32
good. Can I tell you what pretty

Matthias Miller  25:34
Marshall salesperson said about

Unknown Speaker  25:38
their business climate that they're seeing now?

Matthias Miller  25:42
She said that they've seen higher than usual price resistance and hesitation? Sure I'm surprised there's a lot of a lot of people that are scared. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
And so we are I think

Matthias Miller  26:00
it's hard to know exactly what cause I mean, last year was slow. This year is not looking super speedy. I mean, I think one question would be, well, what do you do with these development? What do you do with your developer resources? That's really the big question.

Speaker 1  26:21
worst case scenarios, I go back to investor tools and say, Do you need more clients go work? That one's not hard to do. So I'm not super scared of. of. I'm not super scared yet, actually.

Unknown Speaker  26:41
So how,

Matthias Miller  26:44
how much are you personally willing to get involved in driving the retail offer forward?

Unknown Speaker  26:56
In what way

Unknown Speaker  26:56
what would i What? In what way?

Matthias Miller  26:59
I don't know. Just I don't know. I was talking about it, seeing where things are at coming up with plans to push it forward. Like basically more than anything else, just keeping it front and center?

Speaker 1  27:10
I don't mind. I don't I don't mind being a consultant and being on phone calls. So that that's probably the extent of my I mean, I mean, short of short of some kind of business interest, that's probably the extent of what I'd

Matthias Miller  27:27
want to do. What's does does it have significant besides covering Ben's shortfall does it have

Unknown Speaker  27:34
Do you see it having

Matthias Miller  27:38
significant business benefits

Unknown Speaker  27:39
crafters if you bring in leads that's I mean, that's the okay to

Speaker 1  28:05
any I mean, so every lead that you bring in is just gold. Well, I'm in for a long term, I every lead how the lead isn't cold, the land of deals gold. But so so in that sense, it is a, you know, it's a little bit like say a newsletter or something like that, but where it but it also is an extra income stream.

Unknown Speaker  28:29
Right. So

Speaker 1  28:33
But beyond that, the intangible is that people think of, you know, our thinking our direction when they're when they for, it's a little bit like it is with having Steven kind of available to where we've been able to we're helping people find solutions one way or another. And Stephens a less perfect example, because of his roped us, but but, you know, we've been able to hand people off and it might circle around back. I mean, now the downside is, you know, we've handed people to Rubisco. And then that reference of a reference goes and tries to build a system with them. And anyway, so they boomerang back. boomerang back. Yeah. Although, okay, so, but see, if you would have had an independent web, if you'd have your own web team or Josh would have had your own web team and something would have come up. You might have said, you go talk to code. So So one reason to keep providing more and more of these services in house is that we have fewer the bad boomerangs happening.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
Yeah. The

Speaker 1  29:44
so so there's kind of a market and intangible marketing thing of, of these are the software people and I think that's pretty valuable actually. So we're not just the big software people. We're the software people Now, the downside is the the split focus and the energy it takes to get it going and stuff like that. But in some ways, the upside is these are people we're talking to anyway. So and and they can't, they can't figure it out anyway. So in some ways, we're saying you pay us to help you figure it out, and then we'll, we'll either and then you pay us either to go a different direction, or you pay us to go with customer software. So I mean.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
You know,

Speaker 1  30:38
I, although Steven wouldn't have wanted to do it, I mean, there's part of me that wonders if we should have kept the Excel stuff in house.

Unknown Speaker  30:48
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:50
I could see that. But on the only But

Speaker 1  30:53
the flip side on the sell side is so much messier than the retail side, because on the retail side, we're clearly saying we're not the right fit. Let's help you find somebody that is, here's something we believe in. And on the Excel side is just kind of this cringy. Like, I mean, it's almost an I mean, it's almost antithetical to I don't know what what the analogy is, it's like a monastery offering a dating service or something. I mean, you either gotta go one way or the other.

Unknown Speaker  31:23
So,

Unknown Speaker  31:23
I mean,

Matthias Miller  31:25
if you if you could isolate operations and branding. Yeah.

Speaker 1  31:32
Keep me. Well, we thought we were keeping in the family. So anyway, but keeping it in the circle of companies? Yeah, I think it is intriguing. So, yeah.

Speaker 1  31:47
And it's, it's nothing to say that, you know, if Steven really decides to go independent, that we can't say, Okay, well, that's, that's fine. Let's now Now let's do our let's go do our thing.

Unknown Speaker  31:59
And or

Speaker 1  32:03
we, or we find someone who's less of a of an entrepreneur and more of a, you know, I just want to I love working on Excel spreadsheets. So we just probably, the business might not have grown as fast, but it would probably wouldn't a better fit for what we're wanting or doing.

Speaker 1  32:29
Yeah, anyway, um, so what are your thoughts on but but I don't think you should push into retail software just because it's good for code crafters.

Unknown Speaker  32:39
So yeah, the I'm not

Matthias Miller  32:46
completely sure yet.

Unknown Speaker  32:49
Whether this is a yeah, this is

Matthias Miller  32:52
a brilliant business, I can build on the back of let's build that processes. Let's build out automation. Let's build systems. Let's do this. And let's hire assistants. And let's go get this thing off the road. off the ground. I think it has the potential to be that kind of a business. I'm still not completely sure if that's the right formula for me, though. Ah, sure. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:15
that's probably where my biggest question is.

Speaker 1  33:19
You mean, whether this is the right kind of is the right kind of business for you. Right.

Unknown Speaker  33:29
And even, you know,

Matthias Miller  33:33
questioning things like, am I actually all that good at starting things? Or am I?

Speaker 2  33:40
I mean, sorting things, it's hard for anybody? Sure.

Matthias Miller  33:47
So, is that better? Is it better just to find something that's already working? And I have thought of not suggesting I do all of these things, but like Shane's rental

Unknown Speaker  34:01
rental business. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  34:04
That's something that is highly needed here. Sure. There's, there's a monopoly. They're not that good. Have you had something like that? Yeah.

Speaker 1  34:20
i Well, Shane's kind of worked himself out of a job, but on the other hand, he is he's really expensive. I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  34:34
He is.

Speaker 1  34:36
I think I think customers like him better than the investors do. I've got one with Shane and like, three or four with golden rule, Benji, but I kind of Yeah, I mean, it works. It's fine. But I think Benji's approach Well, first of all, Benji, Marvin has always been lean. And then I think Benji is not quite as lean as Marvin was. But Benji's approach is much more roll up your sleeves and really keep your hand on the pulse. Yeah. And her finger on the pulse. And so I, I kind of

Unknown Speaker  35:15
think that that is, I mean, you really

Speaker 1  35:22
do want some really senior with a lot of involvement, worrying about this whole thing all the time. And and I think that there's a sense in which I think, I think Shane has those people, but I just think it's no one's like the hungry owner. I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  35:41
So but I don't know, I mean.

Speaker 1  35:49
So in some ways, maybe, although partnerships are just are just hard to do. Or dangerous. In some ways, if you could provide the brains and operations and you'd have that hungry owner ish, or maybe it's employee but is, you know, compensated like an owner.

Unknown Speaker  36:08
That

Unknown Speaker  36:12
Yeah, something like that could be interesting. Well,

Matthias Miller  36:16
surely there's even that would you look from within assistance. There's

Unknown Speaker  36:21
a one in 1000

Matthias Miller  36:26
who are probably willing to work for a moderate wage, and are highly conscientious.

Unknown Speaker  36:34
Mm hmm.

Matthias Miller  36:38
Kind of thing. I mean, this is one of those things, I've kind of become resigned to that.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
I work best

Matthias Miller  36:48
telling people to take care of themselves rather than pushing them so sure. I'm gonna use that my favor. Yeah, I can either become I'm never going to be a hard driver. So yeah, yeah. So you're really becoming readily selective about who I work with.

Unknown Speaker  37:01
So the mess with that?

Unknown Speaker  37:05
Yeah. Makes sense. Makes sense. So so so are you wondering if you should table the the software side of things?

Matthias Miller  37:21
Well, I'm already running the ad. So okay, you know, there's that.

Unknown Speaker  37:25
There's that Okay. Um,

Unknown Speaker  37:34
the?

Unknown Speaker  37:58
Are you thinking? Oh, I asked. Well,

Speaker 1  38:02
I think I'm thinking this is, I mean, I kind of think this is a, it should be a good fit for your, I mean, you've got a lot of irons in the fire. That's I mean, and that, you know, at certain points, you start in circuit start breaking flipping for you. So I think you do need to watch that. But it feels to me like this is the, this is a fairly a fairly easy income stream for you to add. One because it, you're working with the kinds of people you're used to working with who are working with technology workers. And you actually have been available and you could probably pick up others, then it's, it's in a parallel field that may and so there's some there's synergy there. And, and it's not well, I'm sure that early on, particularly, it'll pull you in, and even ongoing, they'll probably be questions, you know, like, I'm, you know, I've got this option and this option, this option, and what do you think, or that kind of thing, but it's not rocket science. No. So And okay, here's the other thing. It really really leverages your deep experience. So here's where I think you shouldn't do property management because you would get the systems right but but you're not Wes. You can't.

Matthias Miller  39:36
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean property management. I mean, equipment rentals. Oh,

Speaker 1  39:45
oh, I thought you were going to become a landlord.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Go. Go buy a backhoe and put it in a locked lock and said the website for access and set up the maintenance plans and I don't know how The only problem is I don't know what I don't know. Sure. No, I don't want to go into property management. That's a Doggy Dog.

Unknown Speaker  40:08
I just did not.

Matthias Miller  40:09
I thought you were brave enough to see that one coming? No, I did see.

Speaker 1  40:14
Okay, but it's still my point. Yes, that if you'd be really, really good at construction, and you like working with day laborers, then Property Management might be kind of fun. Right? You're good with software and you like working with with with tech people, ideas, people. And so my kind of thing. I kind of think that this is this leverage, I mean, so you can come in and make a, you know, spend 30 minutes and make $500? I think sometimes. And so, and you can, it's also a thing where you can start reusing, you know, this is the fourth sewage pumping person who's come to me now. And you ask a bunch of questions, make sure you got the right thing, but then it's $1,000. And it's an hour of a junior guys time.

Matthias Miller  41:12
I mean, are two? Really,

Speaker 1  41:17
that sounds appealing? I mean, in some ways, I'm, I'm not opposed to the idea of bringing it under my roof. But it acts it feels to me like it's more fit for how you do things. Where I tend to, I have this kind of monolithic thing with lots and lots of people that I keep managing, and i I'm willing to hover over them, but I don't want to split my mind at 20 directions. It's all it's all invest. So I'm not willing

Unknown Speaker  41:52
to hover

Matthias Miller  41:54
from splitting clean directions.

Speaker 1  41:56
Yep. Yep. So I think this is I think it's an income stream. If you're not interested, then talk to me about investments or something like that. But I think you should keep it for yourself. And yeah. Okay, here's the other thing that I think I kind of think that if you'd look down the road, you're gonna I don't know, if you'll ever be over a conglomerate of, you know, 100 people? If you are, you're gonna have a lot of a lot of people who like hovering underneath you. But yeah, but I do. Okay, I think of you as the expensive consultant, who then spins up people under him, who are really sis who are systems oriented, and then can kind of make the systems happen beneath you. Does that make sense? And so, so I can't, okay, Patrick Lencioni, runs this, this incredible table group organization with like, nine or 10 people. And it might be bigger by now. But it's, it's ridiculously lean. And it's just because he's, he doesn't love managing people. So they found business, they found business models that are based on him getting ideas out, without needing to manage people. So, so, but I'm thinking of you continuing to push into the, you know, you kind of pushing into the, to the Anabaptist market, and I'm not I mean, doesn't have to be there. But as people keep getting to know you, oh, you've got answers when it comes to marketing, oh, you have answers when it comes to this. And, and some of those, and then you you help pull things together. And I don't actually have a clear vision, you know, what does Matthias Miller or code house look like in in 20 years from now? But I'm going to guess it's I'm going to guess it is kind of it will involve lead leveraging the these kinds of these connected spheres of Business Services somehow.

Matthias Miller  44:20
I don't know those thoughts offhand.

Unknown Speaker  44:24
I'm it's

Matthias Miller  44:25
really helpful. Good observation. I think it's actually true. Like this is kind of VMO. To your point I've been reminding, reminding myself a lot. You don't like teaching people like okay, do I mind putting together systems for people? No, I mean, training systems. That was at least fun one time. But I don't I don't like onboarding. I don't like training. I don't like teaching but I am happy to create systems. In the past. What I've tried to do is I've tried to outsource too much of that. Sure. And I tried to solve that through partnerships just because it's lower friction, right? If I would have gone out and said, I'm gonna go hire a Steven, who's willing to work for $25 an hour.

Unknown Speaker  45:15
I mean, if I would have said,

Matthias Miller  45:17
write a check to great assistant for $5,000. And now let's go hire us and assistant to do Excel development for for $25 an hour, let's do it

Unknown Speaker  45:38
that would have been, who'd been quite productive?

Speaker 1  45:42
Yep. Yep. Makes sense. Makes sense. So So what you're saying there, just make us make sure I understand what you're saying there is.

Unknown Speaker  45:50
You almost shouldn't have outsourced. outsource to Steve. And I should have kept that in house perhaps.

Unknown Speaker  45:58
Yeah, yep.

Matthias Miller  46:01
We could have had a completely different brand. Like, yeah, you know,

Unknown Speaker  46:05
sheet works. Yep. Yep.

Matthias Miller  46:13
But then, but then the bigger context is part of the part of what I'm learning is a broader Mo, because I do love creating things and putting things together. And so finding this pattern of I have, I have an opportunity I'm looking at well,

Unknown Speaker  46:27
is it? You know,

Matthias Miller  46:30
What characteristics does it need to have? Well, you know, is it closely affiliated with people I know, can I? Can I? Is it process oriented? Can I? Can it be run by an assistant? Can we build a repeatable model? Does it have broad demand? And if it has all of those things, then? So for example, bookkeeping is a need. But that's actually not that. But that doesn't have the margins in it. Right? You're really looking for? So what could you do? If you want to do something financial related or bookkeeping related? Well, what are options? People need information about it. People need communities about it, can I build a a business model around community building, and that becomes the metamodel for building more communities, like maybe learning that framework where I think only maybe 20 years from now. I mean, hopefully, you'll have capacity to actually spin do more than just spin up things and actually have them grow and respectable scale that is a model for here's the idea, we're gonna we're gonna hire the assistants that are gonna get this thing off the ground. I'm gonna walk with them. We're gonna grow the level. And is it a sale at that point? Is it a cash cow at that point? Sure. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  47:49
Yeah. Yep. Makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  47:51
Thanks. Sounds good. Good.

Speaker 1  47:57
All right. I guess I'll be happy to brainstorm whenever you want to brainstorm about the about the software stuff. And now, you are remembering the the little bit of information we have on the billing date in the billing database about the Capterra and something else? So?

Unknown Speaker  48:16
Yeah, okay. Do Yep. Alright, so

Speaker 1  48:30
Oh, here's another thing we may want to consider with that is, is when we give reports to people basically try to not just say, here's the best one. But say, here's another one or two you may want to consider and Chi like, okay, sir, but kind of forced, here's some input, here's some guidance, here's what you need to do to make a decision. If you aren't pleased with any of these, then, you know, we can talk more or you may want to, I mean, you may want to consider something, you know, something different. But don't let them push the blame of this back on you. Well,

Matthias Miller  49:12
it's a little bit like great assistant says you're 100% responsible for the hire. And if something comes up where you need something different, there's a $500, scope fee, change scope, change fee, you are responsible, we'll give you option A, if you like it, then you go ahead. If you don't like it, we'll go to option two, nine out of 10 have somebody buy option two, we'll take it to three. If you don't like three, then we'll go We'll reevaluate and say are you actually the right fit for this? And if we find you're not the right fit, then

Speaker 2  49:42
we'll refund the search portion of your fee basically. Yeah, yep.

Unknown Speaker  49:53
We could do something

Matthias Miller  49:53
very, very similar to that. Yeah, makes sense. Good,

Unknown Speaker  50:02
good. Good. I like it. Oh, what's next?

Unknown Speaker  50:09
The

Matthias Miller  50:10
we want to talk about non compete with non compete agreement looks for for Steven,

Unknown Speaker  50:15
did we not have something in place? Let me

Matthias Miller  50:19
know noncompete draft definitions

Unknown Speaker  50:29
you had put something together?

Speaker 2  50:56
I mean, we actually have the draft here So, okay. Is there more you want on that? I don't think so. Right. Yep. Good. Next. I'm really

Unknown Speaker  51:11
curious how that's gonna go as you start working together more. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  51:16
I, I kind

Speaker 1  51:18
of think at some point, he's going to choose to go his own way. And then I think we decide what we want to do for ourselves. Yeah. And he'll probably have a big enough network that he'll be fine if he goes his own way. I mean, if you if he buys you out

Speaker 1  51:41
or he may just wait. I mean, he made his wins and waited out to the end of whatever of the three years and then and then he's free to go.

Unknown Speaker  51:55
Yep. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  52:14
Do you have any thoughts on

Matthias Miller  52:16
exit plan? Or is that just something that worked out with him and what we have anything?

Unknown Speaker  52:24
To give notes from our last conversation or not? Really? I was thinking we were I mean, first

Speaker 2  52:36
20 to 30 $20. Cash

Matthias Miller  52:43
is one option that I have. But let's see. Let me see here.

Unknown Speaker  52:46
I almost thought you were one of the more the cash than that.

Matthias Miller  52:50
Yeah, I think I did.

Unknown Speaker  52:53
Although I'm gonna go ahead, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  52:58
What is going to do is take a look at what, you know what revenue projections are based on, you know, if you work solo vs. Team members, what would I expect out of the deal? What's valued? And then based off

Unknown Speaker  53:09
of that, yeah.

Speaker 1  53:14
So, yes, I think that's fair. Okay.

Matthias Miller  53:25
I know they're gonna let me see what else I got on my list.

Speaker 1  53:28
Yeah. Well, and I think they are, I just don't think you have to be very apologetic at all about. I mean, it feels to me like this is someone who's wanting to buy out his angel investor. No, you don't do that.

Unknown Speaker  53:45
I mean, isn't.

Speaker 1  53:48
I mean, yeah, so I just believe that Yeah. So. And I think he's probably thinking now, wait a second, how can I get Matthias to be happy with what he's put into the business? No, the whole reason Matthias put into the business is because he crossed his fingers and said, I mean, at the beginning, you were I mean, you were thinking that's a one in four chance that this could be really great. And otherwise, you know, and it probably a one in four chance that this was a complete disaster, and probably about a one and two 50% possibility that it's okay, but it's just one more thing on my plate and yeah, whatever. So the only way the buyout works is if you make is if you make this be really great.

Unknown Speaker  54:34
Yeah. And,

Speaker 1  54:40
I mean, I don't know so and I think that's just how you present it. I mean, an angel investor will invest will help get the thing off the ground but then he's hoping for really fantastic you know, returns down the road and and, and I think you just say well, I'd love to do is to keep helping you grow this thing and hoping that I can join with you in success we're both really happy. But if not if you'd like to cash out here's what I think your revenue should be and could be and this is what the kind of cash out prize should be so

Unknown Speaker  55:19
well and yeah, you can go into school and

Matthias Miller  55:25
other reasons to believe you just kind of been putting it on the

Unknown Speaker  55:28
side playing around with it

Matthias Miller  55:32
periodic trips here and it was fine You're young but yeah doesn't mean you've gotten anywhere close to tapping up potential. Sure Yep.

Speaker 1  55:42
And I think there's a real I mean there's a real possibility that he will just I mean, cuz there's nothing in the agreement that says he has to keep doing this thing right?

Unknown Speaker  55:55
No, you could drop this business complete.

Speaker 1  55:58
Yeah. So So I think that's probably the the flip side of going really high on the buyout is is just you know, he might drop it completely but but on the other hand, you know, he's doing business trips to clients and stuff right now.

Speaker 2  56:15
So right yeah. Anyway, yeah

Unknown Speaker  56:24
okay

Speaker 2  56:31
the only thing I remember was was what do we have been? Yes Okay.

Speaker 1  56:35
Um several okay. So he's needing more work is that the long and short of it

Unknown Speaker  56:47
oh, he's staying me pull up his

Unknown Speaker  56:57
pull up some reports

Unknown Speaker  57:40
stop right

Unknown Speaker  58:06
let's just do this timecards

Unknown Speaker  58:23
No, I know I have a report for this let me see you're gonna find it

Unknown Speaker  58:41
great sunrise yep

Unknown Speaker  58:53
Why did they stop coming

Unknown Speaker  59:17
Alright, let's do this

Unknown Speaker  59:27
Alright, so this is the latest just from

Matthias Miller  59:34
last week, spending eight hours on mockups, did spend a bunch of time on problem solving exercises which I need to wind down to that we

Unknown Speaker  59:44
can only be that we can whatever

Matthias Miller  59:51
end of design testing guide

Unknown Speaker  59:59
Okay, Then it's a whole bunch of tiny from their little things so

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
give this week

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
lots of 20 hours of email and miscellaneous fewer TVs

Unknown Speaker  1:00:37
at night hours that week okay

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
straining email miscellaneous. Sure

Speaker 1  1:00:58
and going forward what do you expect him to be working on?

Matthias Miller  1:01:06
My understanding was he was primarily here for client support. So we do have some things for him well in design assistance, right or software Sure so assists documentation is something on its plate symbiosis is going to be on his plate

Speaker 1  1:01:33
so I mean, the best thing I can come up with having him do is is is the documentation stuff I mean as far as making his time fruitful

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
and then

Speaker 1  1:02:04
and then beyond that it's probably just trailing Tim and you so he's so he's doing something with his time and learning as he can and and then if he still has time to kill we probably need to talk about what he works on or unless you've got admin ish kinds of things that it'd be helpful to have him work on is that is that kind of what you're thinking?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
Sure. And then

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
and then the

Speaker 1  1:02:48
so and then as far as formulas on how we cover for him I mean I don't know what seems right to you the anyway well first of all, do you have any thoughts offhand or how are you calculating things right now

Unknown Speaker  1:03:22
this so

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
I mean at the point that he's

Unknown Speaker  1:03:45
having

Matthias Miller  1:03:46
fewer okay some of these I need to modify so that the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:52
here we can actually yeah this needs to exclude

Matthias Miller  1:03:54
the problem solving exercises

Speaker 1  1:03:57
definitely out of well out of the hours worked or the billable

Speaker 2  1:04:05
I think theoretically included in the billable Okay. I see

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
myself Sure. And the let me think what else here so so

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
so he is

Speaker 1  1:04:23
so like the week of one one he only had six billable hours what was he doing what what are the other things he was doing? They're

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
just trailing you

Unknown Speaker  1:04:38
know what is this report does it work?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
You

Speaker 1  1:04:57
you could do a total type of live ama That's fine.

Speaker 2  1:05:00
Okay. Okay, so we went minus about three weeks back. Well 25 No one No, sorry two weeks back. Yeah, here we go.

Speaker 1  1:05:13
Okay, general miscellaneous. So why is he not billing for general email

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
it's not billable to anything. I mean,

Speaker 1  1:05:28
so I mean, but if he's literally spending 20 hours on email, is that on email for clients is that I mean how do you spend 20 hours on this is just yeah, anyway go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:05:43
This is also where I was out for a good bit of a week. Okay, like he might literally not have had

Speaker 1  1:05:49
word no, that's fair. Okay, and so that's just the the category to use if you're spending don't know what to be I mean, if you're if it's nothing else fair

Matthias Miller  1:06:00
I think I could ask him to be sure now

Speaker 1  1:06:10
so what would have been ideal as if if we could have looked at well first of all junior people was so tough to keep him busy, but what would be ideal is if we could have had him working on the living specs during that time instead of Okay, so I'm going to assume that those 21 hours because what if Can you can you make this use more ranges and only show ban and group by week maybe?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
sure

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
yep

Unknown Speaker  1:07:47
Do you know Do you know what the check date and range function is? No Oh you mean how to how to do it? What's the difference between that and in range?

Speaker 1  1:08:00
I think this was something that got cooked up a long time ago maybe by code crafters, but I just use in range. I mean, for one thing I should well I should probably let me just make a note to pursue it. I don't like the check date and range I forget it's got a few minor checks in but I don't really believe in it. I don't think

Matthias Miller  1:08:23
I was trying to figure out where behaviorally functionally it's actually different.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
Oh, let me

Speaker 1  1:08:35
in range lets you swap them if they're both specified, I know that the parameter order is different which is awful. It's terrible. You have to have them in the correct order. That's the main thing it does which just seems silly to me

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
that's the only thing it does Yeah, let me just.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
Okay, I wrote it down

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
no matter what I'm putting in the folder, but anyway, And then the grouping would be. Yeah, sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:06
And you're gonna have to say,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
yeah, yeah, exactly. That's, that is the I find it pretty obnoxious to

Speaker 1  1:10:19
say exactly. I can't speak. I mean, we could almost it's not worth it, we could almost do a system switch so that so that external projects don't have that behavior. It's all in honor of credit scope. So.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:42
Okay. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:10:52
514 12 Okay. And then we're.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:56
So Ben writes is just Uncategorized

Unknown Speaker  1:11:00
is what you said?

Speaker 1  1:11:03
Oh, no. Is that is that a group is it's a total total on top or what? Yeah, totals on top. That's what it is. Okay, fine, fine, fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:14
So

Matthias Miller  1:11:18
why wouldn't we actually kill totals on the I guess we want that.

Speaker 2  1:11:25
A week of so you're grouping first by week? Is that right? Do you want to kill the totals on the week and lose the

Speaker 1  1:11:35
because we don't really care that your whole team has worked. And then put the totals on the bottom for the employee.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:43
Sorry, the group go to grouping. Oh yeah, there we go. There we go.

Speaker 1  1:11:53
That's confused why he's putting stuff under his own name. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
country channel CSS training, and then miscellaneous. Just ping him?

Speaker 2  1:13:14
Regardless, there's a bunch of training that's sending as well. Sure. Yep. Yep. Onboarding types of stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
And so over here,

Matthias Miller  1:13:28
I mean, this is not this is an imperfect report. But Sure. There's, I'm writing stuff out of pocket. Sure. 60. Probably. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:42
And then

Speaker 1  1:13:47
as So, so first of all, I mean, I I'm definitely, I'm definitely wanting to make sure you're not losing money here. The maybe the only question is, what is fair? And is if if we are paying either for his dead time, or his trailing time or something like that, then is there is there compensation in exchange for that? Or is, or or do we just pick that up? And that's the are part of the onboarding cost, I

Matthias Miller  1:14:24
guess. I don't know how to answer that. Well, okay. I know how to answer some of that. Yep. The solution going forward is clear. Let's make sure he has work. Yep.

Speaker 2  1:14:37
The, this is another case. It seemed like

Matthias Miller  1:14:42
Ben's available without a deadline. Let's get it done. We'll make sure you're taking care of it. We're not exactly sure what he's going to be doing. But we're gonna make sure that we don't lose money. That's what I heard. I don't know if that's what you intended to communicate or not. That is

Unknown Speaker  1:14:55
that is what I tend to communicate.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:58
So I I,

Matthias Miller  1:15:01
I kind of feel like that's what was communicated? No, I don't want to be. I don't want to be a dweeb about this. I'm asking him now kind of what happened that weekend that can give us lend us a little bit if I dropped the ball on it, and there were things that he should have been working on. Sure. It's fine for me to cover too. Okay, I think it's reasonable to account for that. Okay. But I also know that there is I mean, it was we were at this point of, we're bringing him on full time. Yep. And at that point, Austin had been doing documentation, all the documentation. I don't know that there was any documentation that we were working on. I know, at one point, we had told him to go read through some proposals and stuff. And I'm not sure when he did that. Sure.

Speaker 1  1:16:01
Well, and so, I mean, first of all, this is just a reminder that we want to, to nail down details so that we understand and get written agreements in place. Not because there isn't goodwill, but just so that we're clear on what we're thinking. The so So let's pretend that were back in November, trying to make a decision and saying, Okay, so let's come up with the we know, the overarching goal. Ellis really wants him on board. Tim does not have enough capacity. And Alice wants to make sure that Matthias is willing to move forward because he Matthias knows he's not taking a any risk. He's not taking a financial risk with this. He's not going to be burning cash. So so at that point, what is what kinds of things do we want to have happen? So I think what we could say is that, what does it mean to not burn cash? Well, I think what it means is that probably we need to make sure that you have revenue for I mean, that you have a revenue for for I'm going to say for his salary plus, I don't know if it's 25%. Or if, or if you say it's salary plus. And I'm just talking short term, I don't know for sure what that plus percentage is, but it's more than just his salary, or you are burning money is that? I mean, clearly, it's fine. I'm gonna say 25% to help cover his 7.65. And just basic overhead. Is that a reasonable definition of what burning money means? I think that's a reasonable definition. And then so how do we then make sure you don't burn money? I think well, first of all, anything that you billed for him? The so you, we say that your costs are salary times 20 times plus 25%? Yep. Yep. You subtract off anything that's clearly build. And, and now and even with some recognition that at that point, those are expensive. Well, any work he's doing right now is expensive hours, probably for both of us. It's expensive for you, because you're training him. It's expensive for me, because I'm paying disproportionate, I mean, time for the work that we get. Right? So if that's true, whether it's externally build or internally build. So subtract off anything clearly build. Then, if he is clearly working on software design, now, that's okay. First of all, if he is, if he's working on software design, then we need to think that through.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:10
So the

Speaker 1  1:19:15
and I don't know for sure how to say that because sometimes he's not really working off a software design. He is just he's just trailing because he needs something to do. The.

Speaker 1  1:19:34
But I would say that, probably I shouldn't be paying, you know, I shouldn't be paying for all of his time that he spends on software design at least sooner or that that's okay. So we can think through what that means. And I think part of the question is,

Matthias Miller  1:19:52
oh, go ahead. Well, here's here's another way to think about it. What would he be doing if he would not be spending time on sufferings so To design and is he? Well, this, this kind of goes back to the the other question. It means, what are we hiring him for? Because if if you say, we shouldn't be paying for time, we shouldn't be paying for all his time spent on software design fine, then that means that code house is by definition, taking some measure of risk and wanting to scale up software designs. And, and so that needs to become clear that that's a code house priority to invest in scaling up design, and that Ben is the right guy to put into that role. And I think it's, I think customer service is the place that he's going to excel. I'm not, and I think change requests have a high optimism that it's going to work well with change requests. Sure, I have a much lower optimism that he will be the star player of the huddle design. Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:10
so let's just leave it at consider software design.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:14
The

Speaker 1  1:21:16
so so we know that if there's anything clearly built he should he should be doing that. And now we just need to figure out what to do with his dead time with both so is there anything

Speaker 1  1:21:39
and I think okay, here's where I think the the we've we missed maybe even more than the dollar stuff what we missed was defining what we want to do with his time how are we planning to invest his his his spread time? Because and this is mostly just lessons for next time. But

Unknown Speaker  1:22:01
the

Speaker 1  1:22:04
you know, I'm not I'm not squeamish at all about covering his, you know, covering the spread, it's just, I'm, I'm wrestling with, then if I'm covering the spread, then I should try to be figuring out what I'm doing with that time when he's, you know, that I'm effectively paying for I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:24
so.

Matthias Miller  1:23:00
We could actually do this. Alright, so this is clearly clearly CCI. Yeah. I mean, mostly, there's a little bit that it's me CCI zero risk.

Speaker 2  1:23:15
Ch moderate risk. Or pure moderate is fine. Sure. fch high risk. That's

Matthias Miller  1:23:37
and we have the training and onboarding,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:40
which is and then we have the tape. Sure. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
Okay, yep. Um

Matthias Miller  1:24:10
and then currently, he's on my calls with Tim, is that training?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:16
Is that ongoing cost of support?

Speaker 1  1:24:25
Now, those are great questions. So what are these? Some of that is just kind of onboarding costs, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:35
For I mean,

Speaker 1  1:24:38
and I'm not saying it's your onboarding cost, but I'm just I'm just thinking out loud as we think about what pricing looks like long term and how we I think what you know, Josh, sometimes guess at what we charge for, for things, but I think what he's missing is, this is the entire difference between a business and the solo guy with the solo guy. You don't have any overhead and the business you just have ridiculous overhead, and you gotta make it pay somehow.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:08
So And okay, and and

Speaker 1  1:25:17
here's the just the uncountable, I mean, the simplest way would be if somehow? Well, I don't think this would be, I think this would be demotivating. And I don't think it's actually the right answer. But if we could somehow merge code crafters and code house, we wouldn't even be having this discussion. We just say, do we need another person? Can we afford to pay for him? And let's bring him on board? The but I mean, but I think I think but given I mean, I'm not really proposing that. I'm just saying that what we're wrestling through here is, instead of the messiness of a business partnership, we have the messiness of partner businesses. Does that make sense?

Matthias Miller  1:26:01
Well, if you want to, I'm not completely opposed to exploring the idea of not advocating that we shouldn't even sure what you think about it, but I'm not completely opposed.

Speaker 1  1:26:11
Well, yeah, I know, I think you've said something like that before. The reason I think I'm opposed to it is because actually, I think

Unknown Speaker  1:26:19
I mean,

Speaker 1  1:26:24
I don't really think there there are, I think there is a tangible joy that you get from, from the, from the entrepreneurial side of things. And, and there's and just the sense of ownership, you run things differently than I do, and you won't actually wish to report to me. You quit. That's the short answer. And you'd go and start another business. So, so I would rather give up part of the pie, and let you keep growing your business and it being mutually beneficial. Because I think, I mean, I think you have unique giftings that are good for us, and you keep bringing good people on board. So so I'm not complaining about I just think it may be as we talk this through we It's just helpful to recognize what we are intentionally instead of saying, Okay, let's be this, let's be owners of the same business together where we are, and we try to figure out how to make that work. What we're saying is let's each have our own business, and let's figure out how to keep

Unknown Speaker  1:27:30
I mean,

Speaker 1  1:27:33
push through the details of how to do this so that it's mutually beneficial,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:38
if that makes sense. Makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:41
And so the.

Speaker 1  1:28:29
I'm trying to figure out are we I mean Okay, let me state it another way. The high onboarding QA, we do have a high onboarding cost. I mean, it is you just you got to learn all these systems and stuff

Unknown Speaker  1:28:47
and

Speaker 1  1:28:55
what is a what is the how do so how do we equitably handle that? Yeah, how do we equity would handle that? So that so that you're not burning cash

Unknown Speaker  1:29:15
during the onboarding process

Speaker 1  1:29:38
I mean, I don't even know. Okay, here's a really random and I do want to talk to Joel if we do anything super creative, but here's a really random idea. You know, what

Unknown Speaker  1:29:49
if?

Speaker 1  1:29:51
What if for the first x months of a hire? Okay, well, first of all, if a hire is part time, we think that's cool. orients because we kind of, we trickle him in, and it's much easier to keep them billable than if he's full time. Does that sound right to you? I think so. I mean, there's still training. So but but it's much less likely that you've got these big chunks of, you know, 1020 hours a week that aren't billable,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:22
much softer hit, yes, yes. And

Unknown Speaker  1:30:33
so,

Speaker 1  1:30:34
I mean, one way to do it, and I mean, I scratched my head at this a little bit, but maybe not, I don't know, I mean, one way to do it would be to say that I will, you know, co travelers will just up and pay his salary. Now, if you have anything, if he's working on something like the retail research, then then we should, we should talk about what gets subtracted off his salary. If he's working on assists, then definitely. That, then something needs to be subtracted off. So, but that would just be a kind of a flat rate, you know, for the first X number of months, or until it's time to switch code crafters pays a salary, and then the two of us work together to figure out what he does with his time to make that as productive as possible. I'm not sure if I love the idea. I'm just I'm just I guess that's a that's a that's a kind of a whole different way to think about things. So I bait and basic and one another way to say it, is that you is that code crafters is taking a lot of the onboarding hit there. But then yeah, anyway. And then as I would probably want to be pretty intentional about what he spends time on. The.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:29
And maybe a

Speaker 1  1:32:30
similar kind of I mean, maybe almost the same kind of approach is

Unknown Speaker  1:32:37
that?

Speaker 1  1:32:54
I mean, it's basically take what's billable, and and take a take the break even minus anything build? And what I mean, which is I guess what we were talking about, then the only question is, you know, should he be doing should even be doing high level design assistance? Should he be doing the the retail research?

Unknown Speaker  1:33:23
And yeah. I think the question on retail research is

Matthias Miller  1:33:31
whether, you know, are you concerned about fragmentation? Or is, is that a cost? I think if it's a cost, if it's retail research, I

Speaker 2  1:33:40
think that's something that could house the ducks.

Speaker 1  1:33:43
Sure. I'm not concerned about fragmentation. I think it's, I think it's reasonable. And so, and those are either the, I'm trying to think through how you do that. Well, first of all, I we kind I think we kind of all agree that the I mean, I'd be comfortable with something like the retail research, if when you're deducting prices on that you're just deducting the, you know, let's say he's thinking his his what is his hourly rate?

Matthias Miller  1:34:21
20 something. Okay, remember exactly what?

Speaker 1  1:34:24
Okay, so let's say that it's 25 with the 25%.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:29
So,

Speaker 1  1:34:30
how does it sound reasonable to deduct that amount from the I mean, the $25 an hour from the from the break even amount when he's working for code house.

Matthias Miller  1:34:48
Or what were you thinking? What I was thinking is pretty simple. Take total number of hours. Yep. Subtract billable hours or specific hours. Yep. To multiply by

Unknown Speaker  1:35:03
you know, rate plus 25% and Bill out that amount

Speaker 1  1:35:10
okay and now let's say that again take the take the total number of hours

Matthias Miller  1:35:15
hours worked yep minus items that I build the billable hours are code house specific hours got it okay take your balance and then times

Speaker 1  1:35:27
yes that's simple enough Now what that does mean is that whenever you choose to use him on code captures projects you are in essence

Unknown Speaker  1:35:37
um No you're not No You're nevermind Yeah, I am

Speaker 1  1:35:47
no, okay. I don't wait. I'm not sure if you are if you take the okay take the total billable hours

Matthias Miller  1:36:03
considerably if you'd work 60% For code crafters, I might still bill you for the remaining 40% even though technically well I'm trying to build them out at 2x We're saying it's okay to build them out at at 1.5

Unknown Speaker  1:36:22
So

Matthias Miller  1:36:26
really what I want to do

Unknown Speaker  1:36:27
is total hours minus here

Matthias Miller  1:36:38
might be too complicated but total hours

Unknown Speaker  1:36:56
that okay

Speaker 1  1:37:00
so let me think that through so right so so you're getting your ch ours that cost and I'm paying 2x for his billable hours and then

Matthias Miller  1:37:12
actually this isn't quite right this is actually

Matthias Miller  1:37:22
because if he works 50% I still won't get my additional quarter

Unknown Speaker  1:37:33
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:38:14
Ultimately I want to hear here's ultimately what I want to do let me let me try this again total hours.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:18
total hours minus code house

Speaker 1  1:39:42
Yeah, so what this is doing is Yeah, so So you you basically take the you basic Yeah, you're getting him at, at his his employee rate. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
And

Speaker 1  1:40:03
if he ever gets the hint, though, in the time periods where he gets, and we should define what time periods are, but in the time periods where he where his billable crosses the amount, then you just do the two acts and everything is fine in the where you have deficits, then you're guaranteed a, you know, however many hours that is times 1.2 rate times 1.25. I think that's, yeah. This seems reasonable to me. So So maybe, I mean, is this something we do want to month by month basis? Or? Yeah, that's fair, because that will balance out one month to the next. And probably the, the other thing is, we should maybe on our weekly calls be talking about how the, the

Speaker 1  1:41:03
what? So So essentially, we have these we have the CCI hours, and we should be thinking about how to productively use those. I think I'm very happy to have him use those. And maybe you can start jotting down some ideas. The I think anytime he's trailing either you or either you or or Tim is productive. That's a good way to use those. I mean, to use those unusable hours. Now, if he's actually working on living spec, are. And so let's say he's, well, first of all, is when he's working on living spec, is he learning the systems? Is he actually doing real work on the living spec? Because if he's doing real work, you should just bill me for that work.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:11
So I don't think it depends. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:22
The

Unknown Speaker  1:42:28
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:29
and I don't even know how you figure that out.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:38
Because the living spec

Speaker 1  1:42:39
is, I mean, you know, going through the living spec, and basically just retesting everything, added comments, you know, trying to understand what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:52
And making sure that

Speaker 1  1:42:56
I mean, a lot of what that is he's learning the systems, but he's also he'll be doing clean up with the living spec. So it is a combination of the two. Not only that he will be pulling, Tim, in on those questions, now, any of Tim's time you just need to bill me for. So if Tim is helping, is to help me with the training. And that turns into, well, it's painful for us because we want him to be doing other stuff. But but it's the right thing to do. And that's at the at this at his rate.

Speaker 1  1:43:35
So Well, first of all, we kind of know that when he is trailing people. I mean, it's nice that he's trailing people he's learning but we know that's not productive.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:45
So

Speaker 1  1:43:53
what I what I'm wrestling with is, if I say please use up all your time, you know, reviewing and polishing living specs, then then he could I mean, it could be that he that I get billed for for 40 hours a week for that at 2x.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:14
Which

Speaker 1  1:44:18
which is I mean in some ways, but the good thing is we're getting something tangible out of a deal. The

Unknown Speaker  1:44:33
Well, we have an alternative. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:44:37
We go back to your salary idea. You pay a salary times 25 plus 25%. And

Unknown Speaker  1:44:48
we set his billable rate to zero and I I pay you for time he spends working on my stuff. Or we discount it.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:10
Right, right. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:45:13
and we do that for six months or something. And then we say, Okay, we're ready to switch over and he just gets built normally.

Speaker 1  1:45:20
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that makes it really simple, doesn't it? So so so let's just restate that and see, see where we're at with this. The downside is that, I mean, the downside is you do have energy, it takes energy and mental space to onboard someone, just from your side of things.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:47
Yeah, the

Speaker 1  1:45:49
end, you don't get any. You don't get any profits in the first six months, you don't have you don't get lots of expenses. Now. The downside? But then from there on out, you get to keep you get to keep everything. And I think it's fair at that point. I mean, hopefully, we'll have them useful at that point. But I mean, for some reason, you know, it's we're still short on work or whatever. I think you and I need to talk.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:16
Right?

Speaker 1  1:46:18
Right. It's a pretty reasonable. It's so simple. That part's nice. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:46:26
deducting affordable barns billing. Do I just bill? Do I just deduct that?

Unknown Speaker  1:46:30
Can we just say? Yeah, I

Speaker 1  1:46:38
think you just did. I mean, basically,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:41
I think I think you

Speaker 1  1:46:48
get to keep him at cost for that. And I have been saving the hours. It's probably I mean, it's probably in my best I mean, yeah, so So if, you know, if all else fails, if you bill him out full time for the next six months to affordable barns, I'm smiling because he's built his experience, and we should be good to go.

Matthias Miller  1:47:09
And you're not paying for any of that.

Speaker 1  1:47:11
And I'm not paying for any of that. The good news is that the one thing that that does also give you as it I mean, is that it gives you some upside, you know, an affordable Barnes if you can be productive there. And that will start helping to pay off for his computer and stuff like that. So office space, office space, right. So I don't feel bad about that. So So basically, for for time, when code house is not I mean, code house is getting him at cost. And for the rest of the time, I just pay, we keep it really simple. The rest of the time is just his rate times 1.25. So the and as far as the billing rate, I mean, I don't I don't know how it well, I don't know yet. Do whatever you want. Keep his boiling rate the same. Yeah. And just do the math at the end of the month. Yes. Yeah, I That feels better to me. I mean, it'll feel better to everyone. I think so. Yeah, I think that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:22
And if Yeah, okay,

Speaker 1  1:48:24
I like it. I like it. Do you just want to put it that in a short email and shoot it to join me? Or should we? Or maybe put it in the Google Docs so that we either way, whatever. But I don't I mean, probably probably don't we have a director Splyce with shared management, set of shared management, I think that's where it would go. And the nice thing about that is that now we've wrestled through, you know, a model we're going to try to see what we think of that and then we go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:59
Yeah, I like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:11
Alright, so.

Matthias Miller  1:49:20
Okay, so this does mean that theoretically, if he starts working, what happens if he builds out 70% of CCI?

Speaker 2  1:49:30
Do I write your check that then we recreated

Matthias Miller  1:49:33
deduction? A refund? Yeah, I

Speaker 1  1:49:36
think you create a refund for Yeah, for the next month or whatever is fine. Or yeah, whatever, something like that. So this is just a monthly process that we've gotten until for six months. Now, do you expect him to be providing value on the A high level design and end up design at all,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:04
are barely some of them yes, but it's

Matthias Miller  1:50:06
a little hard to say how much shorter I mean, if he's able to go through the figma and pull out a whole bunch of,

Speaker 2  1:50:14
you know, creative outline of information. That's useful.

Speaker 1  1:50:22
Okay, here's what about is would this be fair? What if at the end of each of your design processes you look at, at what he did? And say, I mean, you know, how many hours of design normally takes? And you know, how much? I mean, how much time you spent here? Would it be? Would it be fair to just for you to make a judgment call on every single one did? Did he provide any value to us or not? If not, this was all learning experience, all funded by code crafters. If if we think that he's saving Tim money, then then then probably it's fair for you to at least pick up his base rate there.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:59
Well, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:51:02
the adjusted base rate so so you just anyway, and I'm totally fine with you just making spitball judgment calls on that. And I don't even have to really no about it or Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:51:23
Good, I like it. I like how simple it is. So, and we might try it out. And then we figure out well, that wasn't quite right. And you can, either we can either figure out how to fix it. Oh, as we go, or we can learn for next time. I'm fine either way. So.

Matthias Miller  1:51:52
All right. I'll put that together. Perfect. Because it's faster time.

Speaker 2  1:51:55
Yep. Great. Um, the

Unknown Speaker  1:51:59
show we talked about Nick's Nick, Nick, next week? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:52:05
unless you want to? I mean, if you want to, if you want to break for a few minutes and keep talking a little bit, we can do that, too.

Speaker 1  1:52:10
Let's What time is it? 1220? Well, okay, one minute thing. I don't have, I think, let's just be thinking about what the implications are for us. And I don't know that there's much implications at all on while there are implications. I guess we'll just have to figure out how to adapt. I think it may mean that you and I answered more dev questions during those nine months. And it may mean that I don't know. Affordable, borrow any affordable Barnes development should happen the next seven months, six months, seven months, whatever. Yeah. And we'll talk more next week. Yep, thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:52:51
Thanks, me.
