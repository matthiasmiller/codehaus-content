Unknown Speaker  01:08
You got it. You can do it. But now

Matthias Miller  01:16
hello, hello. Hello.

Speaker 1  01:19
Can you hear me? Hold on? Come on. Oh, for Pete's sake. What happened? No, I want to convert my audio

Unknown Speaker  01:31
where's my

Unknown Speaker  01:58
Okay, can

Unknown Speaker  01:59
you hear me now?

Matthias Miller  02:00
Yeah, I can hear you.

Speaker 1  02:01
All right. All right. I unplugged my microphone earlier today to charge something forgot to plug it back in. And then when I plugged it back in, then I want to convert my speakers over to my microphone. And you know, that's firstworldproblems.

Speaker 2  02:16
You know? Yeah. You would think that audio is one of the things that figured out at this stage of life?

Speaker 1  02:28
Yeah. Well, you know, unfortunately, the downside to software, and this is the part that I don't know they can ever have aI figured out. It's what did you actually want? You can make real software can make really good guesses that actually what you wanted, but you know, humans are unpredictable.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  02:56
Okay, you want to work on what do you want to work on today? Because I have two things inside my head. And one of them is to go back and see if you can finalize why we had a mismatch on those discount things for accounts payable metrics, or you want to work on something not that probably wants to make you roll your eyes a little bit.

Matthias Miller  03:20
I don't care. What's more important to you?

Speaker 1  03:22
All right, I want to work on stuff that's gonna make you roll your eyes a little bit. So here's what I want. Okay, this whole conversation about getting information from Trello over to over to

Speaker 1  03:38
the CRM, I have a thought. And Riddle me this when you did. When you first did the the connection with the API for for type form? Did you bring all of the historical type form information into assist?

Unknown Speaker  03:54
I might have.

Speaker 1  03:58
So theoretically, we should be able to say, here's all the ones on the list for X lot. Go find them based on this CSV, export and mark them all for that person.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
Maybe. So you get me a CSV,

Speaker 1  04:18
CSV. But here's here's the little think part. And you're way better at finding ways to scrape information out of a whole section of text than I am. Just because you're smarter than I am. So I'm going to share this file with you.

Unknown Speaker  04:41
Yes, share it anyway. This

Matthias Miller  04:43
means you don't get any communication records or any historical information.

Speaker 1  04:47
I don't care about that. Obviously. Well, okay. I have the original there. Well, II Correct. No, there's no way to get that out of Trello Trello does not export their, their notes sections. So it is what it is. At least I can assign all those contexts to you and you have your historical context and we're not going to. Okay, let me back up and say this. My I talked with Mike this morning, and I told him, I really want to turn off the Trello automation because it's being a little bit stupid right now. For some reason. I don't know why Trello thinks that leads coming from North Carolina belong going to Fort Wayne and it's confused right now. So clearly, clearly. And this is the weird thing is Trello likes to go like this. Oh, hey, new lead belongs on Fort Wayne. No, actually, actually it belongs over on online. Okay. Well, the problem is the moment you bounced it through the list of Fort Wayne out goes and emailed to Fort to whoever is assigned to that going you've got a new lead and then tells us oh actually no belongs over here. And it does the right thing. Eventually. The problem is it notifies some people in between there. And it's a little bit annoying because then here's here's what's been happening is so then Floyd in Indiana gets an email saying here's a new response he looks at and goes you know, that's a North Carolina zip code. Hey, Ginger, go follow up with this customer. Ginger goes. I can't see that customer. Dwayne, go look up. And who's that customer for? Oh, whoops. It's assigned to Tory or Victoria. Oh, Trello. You're making my life miserable right now. So we're going to turn it off February the 31st. That was entertaining, wasn't it?

Matthias Miller  06:27
Good. I have a hard time turning it off February the 31st.

Unknown Speaker  06:32
What are you turning off? February 31.

Matthias Miller  06:35
You're gonna have a hard time doing that. Okay, fine.

Unknown Speaker  06:39
You know what I meant?

Speaker 1  06:42
Mike said that this morning, and for some reason, it's stuck in my head. Leave me alone. February 28, fine, whatever. You know what I meant? The end of February. Okay, that file

Unknown Speaker  07:10
document shared with you.

Speaker 1  07:16
So essentially, if we can scrape, if we can scrape the description for the phone number and email, you should be able to match that up.

Speaker 2  07:27
Go ahead. You can't get IDs. You can't get responses. Yeah, it's a Cardo type form. Got it?

Speaker 1  07:40
Where would the type form Id have? I don't think I was tracking that into Wait a minute. Was that? Is that the is that the gobbledygook down there in the in the in the listing? Yeah, maybe content on some of these?

Unknown Speaker  07:55
Yeah. So yeah, it's there.

Matthias Miller  08:02
What about the ones that don't have a?

Speaker 1  08:04
Well those would have been ones that they manually entered

Unknown Speaker  08:09
themselves. Let me go Raul's New Port

Matthias Miller  08:23
condition type form ID

Speaker 1  08:25
equals no okay just just so you're aware you may have picked up it but in the title of this is this is Kelvin. It's Chatham Kelvin Kelvin good okay

Speaker 1  08:41
and okay, so here's here's what I want to know before you get way down the rabbit hole start with your magic because I know how you do with your magic is can we accomplish this in the in the next one hour? And if not, I'm going to go back to Mike and say you know what? It's going to take a whole lot more you know, love and affection to to get this done. Since I'm not I'm not going to remove their access from Joe they can go back and find their own leads if they wanted to. Marcus never did get them on Trello he always got them by email. So it's it's Kelvin is really the only one who it's fairly Purton Well, Kelvin and ginger I would say because ginger and Kelvin. We're actually using Trello like a CRM

Matthias Miller  10:19
No Now it came in as a different on a different format and that moved over to here

Unknown Speaker  10:25
yeah we can do that

Matthias Miller  10:30
if it's just this and we just need the

Unknown Speaker  10:38
email and phone number

Matthias Miller  10:40
well if we mean if we can just do it on the tech form ID that's makes it really simple.

Speaker 1  10:45
Oh, but I mean, how do you okay I'm really really curious how do you how do you actually write logic to scrape out the type form ID on something like this because

Speaker 1  11:02
when you and Josh talked about scraping things always I'm always like

Unknown Speaker  11:14
what are you hating me for? You have no reason to hate me

Speaker 2  11:26
without cause search for okay so then it's form

Unknown Speaker  11:38
then it's

Unknown Speaker  11:46
your ID is always right before type form sent

Unknown Speaker  11:54
then

Speaker 1  11:56
so I went down okay, I went down this rabbit hole of doing exactly what to do but how do you limit the length of actual what you're trying to

Unknown Speaker  12:10
I'll stop talking and watch you work

Unknown Speaker  12:22
oh, you've got to be your freaking maniac

Unknown Speaker  12:32
just do this

Matthias Miller  12:35
this is janky but nobody said we're not allowed to you're not allowed to be JQ

Unknown Speaker  12:40
janky

Unknown Speaker  13:00
we have against single quotes

Unknown Speaker  13:13
is the type from Id always the same length

Unknown Speaker  13:16
yeah

Unknown Speaker  13:22
so then

Speaker 1  13:23
you're tracking the type form ID in in Assist

Unknown Speaker  13:29
is that right yeah yeah.

Unknown Speaker  14:09
Don't want the quotes

Unknown Speaker  14:20
matter who you are there's a way I can do this

Unknown Speaker  14:38
now just let's do this

Unknown Speaker  14:59
very good one Does

Unknown Speaker  16:05
Okay we're just doing throw away stuff Why are you

Unknown Speaker  16:33
okay

Speaker 1  17:53
I see exactly what you do then just go just go through and select them and assign it off

Unknown Speaker  18:11
now I think

Matthias Miller  18:14
I mean that's 282

Unknown Speaker  18:18
Let's do this

Speaker 2  18:35
it's gonna have an extra 130 Wait, so we got all of it 307

Matthias Miller  18:43
Whatever that is so 20 Some

Speaker 1  18:46
now he's gonna have a ton of contacts in there with a whole bunch of opportunities that have no categorization to them if you will

Unknown Speaker  19:01
yeah

Unknown Speaker  19:17
and there's a few

Matthias Miller  19:18
that there's a few that came in from Typeform that well actually this might actually this might be about the right type of No, yeah, there's still some in here that still didn't make it in on type form.

Unknown Speaker  19:35
Yeah, cuz they're their manual entries.

Matthias Miller  19:39
No, but there's type form ones that didn't make it in. Oh

Speaker 1  19:48
let me see you see contact report. Kelvin. Kelvin. Good.

Speaker 1  20:07
Well obviously there's some that are still mess. Wait a minute. Let's do

Speaker 1  20:21
Yeah, obviously some of these some of these are categorized as what are they going to be categorized as last abandoned? Let's try that.

Speaker 1  20:35
Well, he loves a lot of these or do you have automation running that eventually abandons leads that are over a certain timeframe?

Matthias Miller  20:45
Yeah, no activity after 90 days or something like that or 180 something like that.

Unknown Speaker  20:49
And Okay.

Unknown Speaker  20:52
Gosh is a great question because this might

Speaker 1  20:59
Yeah, they're just gonna come in as opportunities that are that are lost or probably just abandoned.

Unknown Speaker  21:06
And that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  21:12
I'm not sure exactly what to call it.

Speaker 1  21:16
So, okay, talking about automation for one second. It your your logic to match up quotes and opportunities has to match on both email and phone number is that correct?

Matthias Miller  21:34
Email first and then there's phone number secondarily.

Speaker 1  21:37
Because I have one I had one for Kelvin where the email should have matched up now. But it did not show as having a quote and I looked and he didn't have a phone number so the phone number didn't match up

Unknown Speaker  21:52
on the quote itself

Matthias Miller  21:55
well I have automation auto LinkedIn, I don't know if that automation is running through Calvin

Unknown Speaker  21:58
is it is it salesperson specific.

Unknown Speaker  22:03
Dealer specific.

Unknown Speaker  22:04
I mean that's what I meant to say

Unknown Speaker  22:19
do you want it running for everyone?

Unknown Speaker  22:21
I would I would think so.

Unknown Speaker  22:26
Everyone Everyone Sure why not?

Unknown Speaker  22:31
Is there a reason why we wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  22:44
Oh, well no

Speaker 1  22:50
well doo doo doo Kelvin and run it manually let me check let me check

Unknown Speaker  22:58
No, he's got a bunch of no hang on

Unknown Speaker  23:10
Oh, this is not running on

Unknown Speaker  23:18
Wait, I'm confused hang on

Speaker 2  23:34
so all the new ones are here which will get picked up next time it runs

Unknown Speaker  23:45
was older than today it should already have been linked. So

Speaker 1  23:54
let's see opportunities for you. It was Joe cabinets, cabinets. 63 Something something estimates and sales orders. Well, it's showing now I don't know. I don't know why. Oh, where were we Okay, so Oh, it just show quoted.

Unknown Speaker  24:17
Well, then what was the problem?

Unknown Speaker  24:19
I don't know. ignore that for now.

Speaker 1  24:27
Let me look at this opportunities, opportunities opportunities. Kelvin. Kelvin. Good opportunity is Georgia, Georgia.

Speaker 1  25:05
Okay, it shows quoted now I don't know who knows, but whatever. Moving on. Okay, do you have that where I can go do gingers as well to bring her past customers in like that?

Matthias Miller  25:21
You want to just do it now?

Speaker 1  25:22
Sure, why not? Let me go download. Let me go get her CSV file

Speaker 1  25:36
truepoint points to point your point marksville Muk. Muk, muk? Muk? Hitsville

Speaker 1  25:48
Come on. Do your thing my being slow, not today's not your time. More export or print and export export as CSV. Okay, let's see here do you need Calvin's one anymore? Or can I use it?

Matthias Miller  26:13
No you can just dump it on top if you want as long as you don't have any

Speaker 1  26:18
I don't know what's going to happen here but I'm doing an open and we're gonna see what's gonna happen

Matthias Miller  26:25
did it did it do what it did? I guess doesn't even matter if there's an overlap yeah just copied in

Speaker 1  26:30
Where did it go? Why did what what what what just what just happened

Matthias Miller  26:37
Okay, I don't know this

Unknown Speaker  26:39
because Shoshana

Unknown Speaker  26:52
Why is my computer

Speaker 1  26:52
being so slow I don't like when things are slow

Unknown Speaker  27:02
tripoint Here we go. Let's do that

Speaker 1  27:15
all right. coming to you with a second a second share. Oh we're already shared on this one. Now this is chat what is I don't know what's going on right now. So we're gonna start

Unknown Speaker  27:31
over start over

Unknown Speaker  27:38
don't laugh at my struggles

Unknown Speaker  27:42
I'm gonna do that because the struggle is enough troubles of its own Why didn't it come on

Speaker 1  27:56
Replace Existing File but where are okay cancel There you are. I don't know maybe I'm just slow today that would be

Unknown Speaker  28:04
possible to argue.

Matthias Miller  28:55
I mean, if you really, really want to go do by yourself, you can

Speaker 1  28:58
have almost I'm almost kind of I don't know what what was going on. I was either I'm stupid or Google stupid one of the two. So we're gonna go with I'm stupid, because that's easier to solve than Google being stupid. All right.

Unknown Speaker  29:20
All right, hitting the send button share button now.

Unknown Speaker  29:23
Share anyway. All right. Thank you

Unknown Speaker  30:01
566 line items

Unknown Speaker  30:09
on

Unknown Speaker  30:15
two

Speaker 1  30:37
done oh because I had I had I had removed a bunch of columns on the other ones

Unknown Speaker  31:13
don't forget to change your assigned buttons

Matthias Miller  31:17
it has changed

Unknown Speaker  31:21
I'm sure Kevin would appreciate all those but you know

Unknown Speaker  31:25
that because yeah me paranoid

Matthias Miller  31:36
measure twice cut once.

Unknown Speaker  31:37
Yeah

Matthias Miller  31:44
I guess I have a chance to review before I save

Unknown Speaker  31:48
Why did they not being goofy? Wow

Unknown Speaker  32:01
boom

Unknown Speaker  32:14
there you go all right. Well that that is

Speaker 1  32:24
800 to 800 pieces of information that these guys didn't have before so there we go. That should that should quell some some. Alright, so let's go back let's go back to our the accounts payable metrics and let's figure out why we were having discrepancies in the discount issue because that report is priceless gold.

Unknown Speaker  32:53
Let me tell you

Unknown Speaker  33:02
you should

Speaker 1  33:02
you should feel fairly accomplished and realizing that you have completely sold me on data driven conversations. It is it is next level to have data driven conversations. There's just no there's no emotion in data driven conversations. It's just there it is.

Matthias Miller  33:21
It just is what it is, is what it is. I've run for it from it for a long time, unfortunately, because I've been in a lot of places where I see a lot of places, I've been a few places where

Unknown Speaker  33:32
you got some.

Matthias Miller  33:35
i There's no way to say besides abusive leadership who uses information to beat people into submission. And that's horrible. But it's really useful, apart from that.

Speaker 1  33:48
So I may have asked this before, but who who was the brainchild behind giving, giving clients access to the ability to edit subsets and reports like whose brainchild was that? Because do you know how many times I've worked inside of software. So like if I could just edit this and change how this is pulling information? And I could answer my own questions.

Matthias Miller  34:11
Mr. Dan Daniels, way back the very first version of this iteration of this platform was written in a language called Pascal. It was a das program. And you had programmers who were writing working on the platform and then programmers were literally building reports in the code.

Unknown Speaker  34:27
And he said This is stupid.

Matthias Miller  34:32
He split it apart back in the 90s.

Speaker 1  34:35
And it's like here how about it make enjoy your reports and a

Matthias Miller  34:40
whole team of people literally the first way you you create a database is not reports but databases was in a really fancy excel program with a whole bunch of macros. And that's how it worked for many many years and then we kept making it better but

Speaker 2  34:55
it's it's a very he's

Matthias Miller  35:02
There's a few of those key decisions that he made that just, it's dude, the company,

Speaker 1  35:07
the fact that I have a standard report and somebody's like, Yeah, but it doesn't tell me this won't drop this and give me that. Give me that on that. Oh, well, there we go. Like you. I'm talking many times a day that I'm doing this. You know, somebody wants to know something. Hey, I want to know something. Sure. Hold on one second.

Matthias Miller  35:29
Well, how about WWE, W? W W nine reporting, and stuff like that? 10 and 10. Any night? Oh, let me go run on accounting. Let me field which ones or which ones I can exclude? Which ones need to follow up on? Go do all that stuff. Like and, and once you start reading customer reports on your financials,

Unknown Speaker  35:53
like,

Speaker 1  35:56
oh, it's gonna be dangerous. And this is why this is why I'm lobbying heavily for Mark to have that person in my office because that person is going to become a it's like crack cocaine cane man, I'm seriously it's like, if you're a data driven person, and you realize suddenly that I can extract my own data without you know, having to build some having some developer somewhere build me a custom report. I can just go do that. Oh, yeah. Yes, you can. Yep. Now there are times when I still have to get people like you to build magic stuff. But still. I like me being a fairly self taught curious learner. It is like magic to be able to try and go back. Okay. The frustrated here's my biggest frustration. And this is a personal frustration. I can't remember some of this. I can't hold it in my head. I just couldn't remember. Which report to open up and go copy logic is like, can I please figure this, like, hold this in my brain, no, too much other stuff in there. So just got to remember where to go find it. Let me go copy that logic and put that logic in and throw a little bit of this lunch together and boom,

Matthias Miller  37:08
build a cheat sheet man.

Unknown Speaker  37:10
I know, I really should.

Matthias Miller  37:13
I really should. Should and Will are different.

Speaker 1  37:16
But okay, so if you wanted to create magic, further magic, but probably don't need to do this, but you know how like Google Sheets has this whole like if you click the question mark, it'll give you like examples of writing some of their formulas. If I had that for your macros and what would like when all that

Matthias Miller  37:38
would be amazing

Unknown Speaker  37:43
Yes, okay.

Matthias Miller  37:49
So you want to take a look at those?

Speaker 1  37:51
Yeah, Accounts page share your screen Accounts Payable the metrics folder, opening back up that Accounts Payable metrics so that we can we had some discrepancies based on if you saw the column versus did it what your what your columns were showing inside of the model. So trying to figure out what the discrepancies are so that we can resolve for it.

Matthias Miller  38:32
Alright, so 11235 I think we didn't have to go too far down before we started hitting some issues.

Unknown Speaker  38:40
23 Okay, so what happened here?

Matthias Miller  38:44
95 115 85 Okay, the negatives are not being included

Unknown Speaker  38:49
in this report. Why would there be a negative

Unknown Speaker  38:54
discount?

Unknown Speaker  38:58
Oh, well, I don't know. Difference

Speaker 1  39:01
negative 33. What's the date on this thing? January 13 2022. So this was just a couple of days ago right.

Unknown Speaker  39:10
Okay, no,

Matthias Miller  39:12
this is a year ago. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  39:15
It helps to look at the round somebody more

Unknown Speaker  39:17
recent. Okay, actually

Speaker 1  39:21
go change your timeframe to this year. Let's do let's do anything for the beginning of year see if we find any negative discounts in this because I need something fairly.

Unknown Speaker  39:43
Nothing?

Speaker 1  39:44
Okay. All right. I have a feeling it may be what? Maybe an old but you were saying negatives are not being included?

Speaker 2  39:54
Yeah, I'm not sure why. Let me see if I can figure out why. Um

Unknown Speaker  40:00
I gotta hit the restroom real quick

Matthias Miller  40:04
I'm gonna have to drop soon too by the way

Unknown Speaker  40:38
Oh

Matthias Miller  41:38
well we have a specific check for discount so if it's in the range it was paid

Unknown Speaker  41:42
in the range

Unknown Speaker  41:47
so your discount greater than zero

Unknown Speaker  41:51
Yeah

Matthias Miller  41:52
Can we just remove the zero and zero check and just or if just do does not equal zero

Speaker 1  42:02
greater or less than zero so that okay if you did greater or less than zero that would give you that would give you your negatives right

Matthias Miller  42:08
yeah and then they would all match theoretically like if I theoretically now if I run this thing

Unknown Speaker  42:20
should get

Matthias Miller  42:24
five years later

Speaker 2  42:31
nope I don't Okay well we're gonna start figuring it out 03 Okay let's do should be to 1595 Okay let's do some random big one seems off

Speaker 1  43:07
Why don't you just why don't you take your other report and exclude anything that doesn't have a discount date or discount amount because we don't care about anything else in that in your in your in your sub pain report

Unknown Speaker  43:24
so exclude

Speaker 1  43:25
anything with a discount date or or or or discount of mouth

Matthias Miller  43:37
it could be an issue with discount date too I

Unknown Speaker  43:38
suppose

Unknown Speaker  43:45
you know what what it is

Unknown Speaker  44:19
I heard not all of those discounts

Unknown Speaker  44:39
my status is paid oh well probably have something to do with it.

Matthias Miller  45:00
Do you only want paid ones for the number entered?

Speaker 2  45:04
No you don't yeah well

Speaker 1  45:08
no wait you're talking about accounting for the vendor invoice and discount so whether they are paid or not no should not be should not be a no just any vendor invoice

Speaker 2  45:24
a vendor invoice debug I think this one can go up so the discount and Miss discount

Unknown Speaker  45:41
okay well oh eight

Unknown Speaker  46:02
you 1514

Matthias Miller  46:11
Yeah it's removing duplicates.

Unknown Speaker  46:13
I think not sure

Unknown Speaker  46:20
I gotta drop

Matthias Miller  46:25
we're gonna have to pick it up.

Unknown Speaker  46:27
All right, when?

Unknown Speaker  46:30
Friday not sure. Like

Matthias Miller  46:34
Friday, I'm out. Let me let me see about let me see about tomorrow. Okay, let me know. Thanks.
