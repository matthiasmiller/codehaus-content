You Sure I'll go so as a normal Thursday evening with my family, I was lying on the floor living room floor with my son playing with Legos and he just dumped out a big box of Legos on the floor and everything was a jumbled mess. And he'd been begging for me to come help him build a house. And as I as I lay down on the floor, lay down on the floor with him, I realized that he never thought about the windows, the walls, the all of all of those things and all he had was a big pile of Legos. And this whole thing was about to come crumbling down. And I was lying as I was laying on the floor with him working on this on his Lego house. I realized that, like many of you, I've had this this jumbled mess of Legos in my business and I knew that I had all the pieces that I needed, but I didn't know how to put all the pieces together. I was confused about where to put them. I was spending too much time putting things together and taking them apart and back together again. Sometimes I was even crawling over Legos to try to get to the piece that it was it was painful at times. And I felt like I had to choose between either just dealing with the pain or throwing in the towel. And over the last number of years I've been able to help over a dozen business owners work in their business and I walked them through the process of understanding the simple vision of where they want to go in their business, sorting out all of the pieces that are strewn across across their business and stack the Legos of their business together so that they have a simple repeatable process that that eliminates the operational headache of of their business. So if if you're overwhelmed with getting inundated by emails from the first time you wake up in the morning, until you go to bed at night.
