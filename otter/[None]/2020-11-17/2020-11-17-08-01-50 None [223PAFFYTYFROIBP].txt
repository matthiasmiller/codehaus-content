So I guess here's the question how do you break down the process when you have this workflow, because we can all kind of break down that workflow. So then the question is what are the major pieces I think that's one of the, one of the. So maybe we need to need to do this break this down into a pillars process, were here is what is the workflow. And I think part of it is, how do you identify those major pieces. And there's some interesting things that go into that as far as how you identify them first of all, there's definitely some level of instinct to acquire over the years it's knowing that this is how it works. But I think one of the major things of understanding it is actually one of the ways that I understand it is just by running a bunch of scenarios in my head. And, and checking to see what works and what doesn't work. I don't know that's a great answer. I don't know how to do what I do. There's so many questions about that of like how to make that happen. And I'll have a good answer for that. But there needs to be a way. So, but I can't spend my time. Well, maybe I could, I don't know. No, I can't like, the question is how do I train somebody else, how to do this. How do I break that down into a process because we have a workflow, that's that's the one piece. So once you have the workflow then the next question becomes how do you take that workflow, and how do you identify the major pieces that need to be part of that, in order to be able to track what's going on and I think one of the things you can do, is what is the 80% complete guideline, there is a tip right there.
