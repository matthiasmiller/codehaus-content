So go to something really interesting that this is based off the conversation I had tonight with Jim and Julie. And I've noticed this with other people as well. But I seem to really come alive when people ask me questions. And when there's a poll on kind of what I'm doing, I had to think about somebody like Michelle, or somebody along those lines, has a really strong journalistic curious that he loves to ask questions and that loves the probe and understand and get to the root and those kinds of things. And I wonder if there's a way that either we can filter out clients who are like that, or, or be able to put myself into situations whether it's at the training or I don't know exactly what, but it feels like that's a really key component to the stick, what makes me tick, and the places where we encountered

momentum or success

where there's somebody else's, an unrelated problem to solve this is the really interesting dynamic doesn't seem like somebody has an unrelated problem solver, or it is just looking at the problem and I can give them a perspective and then LED light bulbs start going on. And it it seems to be somebody who typically has a good level of initiative

with the problem that they're trying to solve as if they're not just they're not just trying to get so

Unknown Speaker  01:16
I don't know,

Speaker 1  01:18
they don't assume they have all the answers. They're really curious. They are willing to put in some work to fix the problem and they're already putting some working to research it and then what ends up happening is that the information that I give to them actually ends up being a blessing to them and they see it as such a privilege and such a gift and the more that I can replicate that the more amazing that something is going to be.
