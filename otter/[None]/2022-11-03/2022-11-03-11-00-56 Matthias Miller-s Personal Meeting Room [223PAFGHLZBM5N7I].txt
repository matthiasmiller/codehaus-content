Unknown Speaker  00:36
Hello, Mark. Hey Matthias, how are you?

Matthias Miller  00:42
Pretty good. How are you?

Speaker 1  00:46
Good. Is that Did I understand correctly? Is that Monday? Where your account will be on the call?

Matthias Miller  00:59
Yeah, except that will have to be at

Speaker 2  01:03
3pm. Eastern Time. was the only time she was available on the seventh. Does that work for you or not?

Speaker 1  01:14
Yeah, it does. Well keep going. If it doesn't, I just thought of something that might interfere but not quite sure how exactly how that'll. Not quite sure. On my plans for Monday, but yeah, good. Good here.

Unknown Speaker  01:35
Okay. Sounds good. All right. Hello, Gabe. Howdy.

Matthias Miller  01:49
Just a heads up for you guys. We did have a client down situation. We're actually have it right now. I think. I think somebody else has got it covered. But there's a small chance that I'm gonna have to drop this call. Nick, do you know? Is your dad in the office?

Unknown Speaker  02:11
Yes.

Matthias Miller  02:13
You're gonna ask him if, if he?

Unknown Speaker  02:18
Do you see if you can check a signal? Sure. Okay.

Matthias Miller  02:41
All right. So I wanted to clarify a few things gave based on your email and make sure that we were on the same page. And to do that, I think it makes sense to walk this through. Clean Slate fresh on top, where we're at. When we're setting up accounts, we've got big buckets and little buckets, big buckets being production, labor, production, overhead and raw materials, little buckets being things like supplies, tools, et cetera, et cetera. big buckets, get percentages and many manufacturer cost little buckets get percentages as well, which are percentages of the percentages. When we are estimating a cost, it's a very simple calculation, find out what production labor, total, big bucket total is, and then break down the little buckets. And inside of that, in there, you've got all your individual costs. Now, here's, and then in an ideal world, if we were to sell the building Well, we you know, for actual costs, we track actual costs for each of those, and we prorate them based on on the manufacturer totals and everything theoretically, comes out nice tidy and clean.

Unknown Speaker  04:04
Except

Matthias Miller  04:06
we might sell a building when we have labor costs, but not all. overhead costs, are we got some of the overhead costs, but not all of the overhead costs. And unfortunately, it's in the back of my mind that we at least started talking about this in our last call. Maybe we didn't, maybe

Unknown Speaker  04:32
I'm not sure what. But

Matthias Miller  04:37
when you have when you're able to calculate actual costs for some of these line items, but not others. Do you want to expense this out using only the percentages? Or do you want to expense it out with whatever actual costs we have and use the estimations for whatever actual costs we don't have First of all,

Speaker 3  05:03
so I think it does now. So you only have reference to the big buckets like we have. We have labor, but we don't have we have actuals on labor, but we're still stuck with projections on overhead. And then in my mind, we would use actuals on labor, but projections on overhead. That's what you meant I misunderstood?

Matthias Miller  05:39
Well, it's not just big buckets, it could be little buckets we could have. Because actual costs get entered on a per line item basis. And we can change this. But I was going to say that each line up, you can enter your costs for each line item. At whatever interval you want to. So you could say tools every week, and other supplies or every month. And something else we enter every quarter on the overhead side.

Unknown Speaker  06:18
And on the little bucket that. Okay, what I don't understand is, is why are the little bucket numbers valuable between reconciliations?

Speaker 3  06:39
Are you anticipating that I was anticipating that let's just just talk about production labor? For the conversation, I was anticipating that we put a production labor percentage onto the building record. And then that number stays there until the end of a period when we reconcile our actual production labor, and only then could the production labor on the building record potentially change? Got it. Now, between between between periods, maybe this is what you're thinking? I'm not sure is between periods we are paying. Like we're actually paying little bucket items like we're paying for breakdowns of production labor, we're actually paying the shop labor, we're actually paying subcontract labor, we're actually paying whatever the four or five little buckets are. That would change the percentage of the big bucket that each little bucket consists of on the balance sheet. Follow?

Unknown Speaker  08:13
Yes.

Speaker 3  08:15
So when we think about it that way, whenever we sell a building, during between periods, it would actually make a difference on how much of each goes on to the income statement.

Unknown Speaker  08:37
Because Does that make sense? Yes. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:55
no. Am I missing something on? It seems like I'm still missing something.

Unknown Speaker  09:07
Or your thought of a little bucket. Are we going to use

Speaker 3  09:17
actual little bucket numbers between periods? Right.

Speaker 1  09:27
Gabe, it sounds like if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like you're using projected big bucket numbers, but then within that you're using actual little bucket numbers. How you divvy up the projected numbers? Is that Is that what you're what you're thinking?

Speaker 3  09:49
If the building gets sold before we have actual production labor, and then yeah, we would use the projected Production labor number on the building record. But since we're only storing big buckets on the building records, we're not storing little buckets.

Unknown Speaker  10:10
We would we would

Speaker 3  10:18
break our big projected big bucket number on the building record down into little buckets on the income statement, with the same percentages of the total that each little bucket on the balance sheet represents percentage of the big bucket. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2  10:41
To you? But it seems to me like we're good. No, no.

Unknown Speaker  10:54
But it seems like

Speaker 1  10:56
I'm not clear on it seems like we're using projected numbers on big bucket and actuals on some of the small buckets, I

Matthias Miller  11:04
guess, how?

Speaker 1  11:10
How are you getting your actual big bucket numbers? At the end of a period, how are you getting your actual big bucket number? For how much whatever it is production labor. You have in that let's say in that month?

Speaker 3  11:32
The end of the period, it would be total production, labor costs incurred during that month would be allocated to all the buildings that were produced during that month.

Speaker 1  11:51
How are you getting that total cost? The total production labor costs incurred for the month is that the sum total of all the little buckets?

Unknown Speaker  12:04
Yeah. Got it.

Speaker 1  12:20
Okay, but, but I don't know what my I just sent it just before the call here, but I don't know what my example. Be helpful in this discussion or not I, I took what Kristin put together, and then added a third date. So yeah, building built that all made sense building sold, understand. And oh, never mind the formatting. And then I added the third date when we do when we have actual overhead costs. And what I'm showing is that only two of the subcategories changed. If you think this is helpful for this discussion, we can use it if not, then let's keep going with us.

Matthias Miller  13:20
This is extremely clear in my head how I think it should be. I'm struggling to wrap around, wrap my head around

Unknown Speaker  13:29
how you guys are visualizing it.

Matthias Miller  13:36
Let me pull up Kristen's spreadsheet again. So they've got that as well.

Speaker 3  13:43
If you're extremely clear, then you should be doing all the talking here.

Matthias Miller  13:49
Okay, so here here is whether or not you're storing anything on the building record. At any given time, you can calculate a precise estimation and or actual cost or a hybrid for any line item related to that building record. So when we say what is the what is the production labor? I look at the percentage the big bucket percentages, just as tools to make it easier to tweak the numbers so that we're not fighting the numbers. But in reality, each line item we're going to try to optimize supplies to match the actual percentage of what supplies are supposed to be. Actually No we're not.

Matthias Miller  14:48
Are you are you wanting how closely do you want the line items to be to the actual costs or are you just looking to make sure that the big buckets are stay stay the right cost?

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Okay, we define line items,

Matthias Miller  15:06
little buckets. How important? Is it that little buckets match projections? Or do you only care about big buckets matching projections?

Unknown Speaker  15:15
Let's think about that. Little buckets. Okay, okay.

Speaker 3  15:24
We're not, we're not storing little buckets on the building records, right?

Matthias Miller  15:31
Well, doesn't matter. That's irrelevant. Because even if we don't store them, we can calculate them. And at the point of sale, we're going to have to store them somewhere. Whether it's on an accounting record, or whether we duplicate it on the billing record to say this is what we expensed out.

Speaker 3  15:57
The way I'm thinking about this, the little buckets are only stored in two places. One is on the balance sheet as an asset, and the other is on the income statement as an expense. are you envisioning them somewhere else?

Matthias Miller  16:16
Implement the implementation detail, but yes. I mean, practically speaking, I don't think it affects you, but.

Unknown Speaker  16:30
Okay, so

Speaker 3  16:32
as far as on the balance sheet, where we pay for a little bucket item, it's got to be on there. And it's got to be right to the penny.

Unknown Speaker  16:42
Right. And then, when we move

Speaker 3  16:51
production labor from the balance sheet to the income statement. It has to be right into the penny.

Unknown Speaker  17:04
Right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
So I'm trying to wrap my head around. Like a second option. You're talking about two options? Do we want to use projected? Or do we want to use?

Matthias Miller  17:31
Do you need little buckets? Do you need your percentage estimations in your little buckets to match what's happening on your balance sheet?

Matthias Miller  17:45
Or are you okay with or are you just wondering, do you care about variance within little buckets? Or do you only care about variance on big buckets? That's what I'm trying to ask.

Speaker 3  18:03
Eat we care about varying from little buckets? Although I'm I'm not sure why we would ever have one.

Speaker 3  18:13
Because wouldn't we always use the percentage breakdown or little bucket off of actual numbers on the balance sheet like?

Speaker 1  18:35
So give I think this will help clarify, take take your

Unknown Speaker  18:42
walk through the

Speaker 1  18:44
little spreadsheet that I sent. That takes Kristen's numbers. Let's just walk through the first met him there and explain to us how you're thinking to handle that $48.18 cent variance.

Unknown Speaker  18:59
So you got that.

Speaker 3  19:04
You're going to have to explain. I have it. Yeah. But I don't quite understand what's happening.

Speaker 1  19:11
Well, so the building spilled on the left there. So at that point we have those are on your on your balance sheet you have those are the different little buckets. $1,000 $50 750 A total of $6,011 of production overhead. And the percentage is there. Looking at the first one $1,000 on your balance sheet for that asset is 17% of production overhead. So when that building's sold the next day, one second, I'm sorry, I'm lost. Okay, the first column

Speaker 3  19:50
the ones are the $500 and cents. Sorry, yeah, there's

Speaker 1  19:55
$1,000 70% 9582

Speaker 3  19:59
Yeah, you Each of those numbers a separate is that's all one building.

Speaker 1  20:07
Yes, this these numbers match. exactly to what Kristin. It's what Kristin had put together last week so that the NFL

Speaker 3  20:27
but I should be thinking about this sorry to buddy in here unless I understand this the rest of the presentation is probably not going to make sense. I should think of this row as little buckets breaking down production labor, which was a total of $6,011. Correct. Okay, and this is on the balance sheet, I'm looking at the balance sheet, right? You are Yeah. Okay. Got

Speaker 1  21:01
it. And then so the next column, the next column two, and three, where I say one to 23 buildings sold. And the fourth column those, those should be dollars and cents instead of percentages. So that first one should be $904.18. So the day the building sold down at the bottom, the there's $576 in the bank bucket, and then we break it up, you know, 17% of that is 9582. Which is what will show on the income statement and the 904 18 as a percentage, but nine and $4.18 is what's left on the balance sheet in that little booklet after you've subtracted that 9582.

Speaker 3  21:54
Okay, why why are we when the building is flooded with $6,011 of production labor? For that one building? Why are we only expensing 576? When we sell it?

Speaker 1  22:09
No, the 6011? Is is the total on the balance the total production layer on the balance sheet for all the buildings in inventory,

Speaker 3  22:23
and where it is the one that we just sold for 576?

Unknown Speaker  22:33
Where did the 576 come from?

Speaker 3  22:36
Didn't that be one of the I was understanding that all of these these line items in the first row represents a little bucket of the one building.

Speaker 1  22:58
No, they represent little buckets on the balance sheet of all buildings in inventory.

Matthias Miller  23:05
Gabe, I'm sending you another I'm forwarding you the email that Tristan had sent. And I think if you pull up her printout with the balance sheet details and you line up these numbers, I think marks marks spreadsheet here is gonna make a lot more sense for you. Good

Speaker 3  23:35
so when the building was built, we don't we're not showing the $576 going on to the balance sheet.

Speaker 1  23:49
Well, it's not here but yeah, once you get that from Chris and I should have put this together in a more usable format than this but I think it'll make a lot more sense.

Unknown Speaker  24:20
Now

Unknown Speaker  24:36
all right, I'm looking at this one one. If you look

Speaker 1  24:41
at the sets of numbers on Christian spreadsheets, that the four columns for the balance sheet, they should match exactly what I'm showing on mine.

Speaker 3  24:56
$6,011 is production overhead and Then that's like the starting. Yeah. Okay, so that makes sense. And then next building is sold. Okay, and the building amount is 576. So we have a projected production overhead of $536. Right? Yes. Okay. And then we take an retaking the same good well then you see how that creates all a little buckets

Speaker 1  25:40
9580 to the 4791 and it also lowers the little buckets on the balance sheet to 904 18 Yeah, that so now what I'm showing here and I think this is what we're trying to answer is the end of the month 131 23 We get actual costs for the ones highlighted in blue say the break rooms applies

Unknown Speaker  26:09
we've we've

Speaker 1  26:14
that that has now changed to 1500 and the 750 change to 875 So now we say oh, that percentage the little ball grid or those two has changed now if you look at break rooms applies instead of 17% of the bake but it's now 23% And

Speaker 3  26:43
at the end of the month you're saying the on the balance sheet we had $904.18 Yeah and then we discovered we have 1500

Unknown Speaker  27:04
Well at the end of the month when yeah when we reconcile

Unknown Speaker  27:08
it but that won't change the numbers on the balance sheet

Speaker 1  27:14
Why would well okay, no no one wins. So but we have got another bill for received break room supplies. We paid that invoice later that month

Unknown Speaker  27:31
so the

Speaker 1  27:33
that 4818 Are you just how are you allocating that are you so this building has already sold so we can add it to the building or you just leaving that in the asset account and it'll just increase the percentage for all buildings that have not yet been sold

Unknown Speaker  27:59
okay

Speaker 3  28:04
what what when we did this reconciliation

Unknown Speaker  28:10
did it change the

Speaker 3  28:18
the 576 like the projected big bucket number we had for this building 576 That's the only thing that to me is worth talking about.

Speaker 1  28:34
Well it it did it change that number to 630 706 because we get to the end of the month and instead of having $6,011 on the balance sheet we now have $6,636

Speaker 3  29:07
Okay, so this month we started out with 601 $6,007. And the cost that we incurred this month

Unknown Speaker  29:23
was what

Speaker 1  29:30
Wow. In this basic example it would be another $535

Unknown Speaker  29:41
as we're seeing with big six, three big 636

Speaker 3  29:51
We started with 6011. So Five Seven it looks like we incurred $1,201 Production overhead during the month is that right

Speaker 1  30:17
II yes assuming no other buildings were sold yes

Speaker 3  30:23
so I think I'm doing the same thing backwards and we actually so our projections should have been 12 $1,201 but we missed it by a mile we only had 576 So we had $625.

Speaker 3  30:48
of production overhead cost we incurred during the month that were not allocated right Yes, so $625 is a problem

Matthias Miller  31:03
Can you can you run through those numbers one more time so you can even keep up

Speaker 3  31:15
well for the month according to the numbers I'm looking at here we incurred we spent $1,201 on production overhead

Unknown Speaker  31:34
so this month

Speaker 3  31:39
and with our our projection you're seeing there we only projected 576

Matthias Miller  31:47
Where are you getting your 1201 from

Speaker 3  31:55
this is probably but you're you're taking

Speaker 1  31:59
it one step deeper which is is the right way Matthias gave is taking the beginning balance sheet amount 6000 the lab and dragging it from the ending balance sheet 6636 and then adding that amount to the 576 that we adopted that we moved from the balance sheet to the income statement when the building was sold

Unknown Speaker  32:29
right makes sense

Speaker 1  32:45
so gave the continue that thought then we're showing that we're 60 will be allocated we should have allocated $61.06 more to that building that has already been sold

Speaker 3  33:13
already my math we should have allocated $625 more

Matthias Miller  33:21
if you think of these numbers not as if you think of marks numbers not as balance sheets you would if you would assume as a balance sheet of zero, a projected 6011 and an actual 6636

Unknown Speaker  33:42
Then marks numbers make sense.

Speaker 3  34:04
The period the on this example. The period began on one on 123 and ended on 131 23 Right? Yes and we need to allocate all costs incurred one 123 to 131 23 to all production that happened during that period

Speaker 1  34:26
right well we do and I think that this example would say that there was more production that happened than then that one building

Speaker 1  34:48
Okay, I think we're we're missing each other Gabe is you're trying to allocate all that 600 and some dollars more on that one building. But on that one building, we're just build that building still has the same manufacturer price but instead of multiplying it by 9.6 for the big bucket we're like 10.5 It seems like

Speaker 3  35:26
we're starting out with an inaccurate big bucket number like the big bucket we projected with 576 but after the period ended and we have actual costs what was the big bucket number

Speaker 1  35:48
630 706 for that one building

Speaker 3  36:00
How can I don't understand how we can be accurate you're still using the 576 is the base Well,

Unknown Speaker  36:14
no, no, I'm saying

Speaker 3  36:20
like I don't understand how we can start talking about little bucket until we reconcile our big bucket first talking about what percentage of little buckets seems like a futile conversation until we know to the penny how far off or 576 was

Matthias Miller  36:49
which but you could do it the other way you could say you could build this thing from instead of from top down and you could build it bottom up so you could say in for break rooms supplies building so first of all we need to determine one of the gaps is what is the total what is the total this building is what percentage of total manufactured and so if you go

Unknown Speaker  37:24
I think that's part of the issue.

Speaker 3  37:28
The only way we can build a bottom up is if we if we store all the little buckets on the billing records.

Matthias Miller  37:36
Now you can calculate you can calculate them you know how to store them you can calculate them

Unknown Speaker  37:52
okay

Matthias Miller  38:00
so I don't know if it's helpful now at some point I don't want to distract from where we're at here. I can walk through what that process might look like but

Speaker 1  38:14
let me go ahead and resize I think I'm just making things more confusing here. Okay, so let's

Matthias Miller  38:21
let's take an example of breakroom supplies. We let's say we projected $1,000 And I may be varying off of the actual examples here so forgive me if we projected $1,000 of breakroom supplies and we had a and we projected that this building that we sold was 95 point $95.82 off of

Unknown Speaker  38:51
I'm gonna get myself in trouble here too

Matthias Miller  38:57
let's well let me walk you through how the calculation process would look. So you have a building you have all of these line items production let's have a break break room supplies. So look at a building that's not sold. We don't have any actual costs. How do we calculate what the brake line red breakroom supplies numbers should be? Well, we said that and I'm making up numbers. Let's see. We said that 9.6% is going to production overhead and then we said of that 17% is going into breakroom supplies. So that's the so the current number for this building is 9582 If I'm reading these numbers right, so far so good

Unknown Speaker  39:44
Okay, excuse me one second. Why are we trying to calculate

Unknown Speaker  39:48
a percentage

Speaker 3  39:51
break for breakroom supplies. With only storing with only projecting the Big bucket number on the billing record. I don't understand where that that that calculation is going to be valuable to try to figure out what percentage this is going to be breakroom supplies.

Matthias Miller  40:13
Well, here's why I can try it from this angle. Here's why you don't want to just deal with big buckets. If you only deal with big buckets, then you can only assign a final price at whatever point the last period. The the latest and biggest period, including that building has been reconciled. So if you do this strictly off of big buckets, then we're going to use estimations. Okay, so So let's say that breakroom supplies, we said, Hold on, we're going to allocate costs from January 1 to march 30. And we're not going to determine any overhead, we're just going to do big bucket, big bucket numbers. And we're only going to figure out what the big bucket number is when we can tie all these little pieces together and put a ribbon on top. And so because we don't know how many buildings are actually built, until have been built until April 1, there is no way to establish the big bucket number until we reach April 1. So even though you could be entering all the other expenses weekly, there's still this teeny tiny little bit of variance that's going to come from this, this big bucket expense that we've spread out across three months, that's going to keep us from nailing down those numbers. And so you defeat you defeat the very purpose of trying to trying to get trying to get the actual numbers in are trying to do estimates. And yet, we're trying sorry to try to reconcile any of these numbers more frequently. Does that problem make sense? Or does that not make sense?

Speaker 3  42:05
It doesn't, I don't have to understand it. I mean, if this all makes sense, and it reconciles. It's fine.

Matthias Miller  42:23
Mark, is it makes sense to you? Want me leaving you in the dark as well?

Speaker 1  42:34
No, I think it makes sense. Yeah, it makes sense. I believe if you're I think we're both thinking the same thing.

Matthias Miller  43:00
So getting up at any point, we want the big bucket number. The way I look at the big bucket percentage is it's it's a way to easily move the dial without needing to finagle all the individual percentages. And when you're when you're setting up how these things get allocated, but at any given time, we can go to a billing record and we can say, go calculate me the best estimate that you have for what your actual cost is. And it's going to say do I have any actual costs for for breakroom supplies? Nope. So I'm going to use the 17% projection. And that dollar value, you know that 70% projection of what we thought was going to be 9.6% and the total for that is $95.82. And I'm going to put that as a line item. And then it says, Do I have an actual actual costs or depreciation buildings? Oh, yeah, we do. We've actually, we actually have an actual cost for that. And so I'm going to add the actual cost for that based on the way we do those calculations. And it's going to through go through out of all the line items, some of them are going to be actual numbers, some of them are going to be estimates, and it's going to come back and say okay, best guess for the actual cost of this building is fill in the blank the sum of all of those things, and as you start putting in the actual costs for each of these individual line items, we should be narrowing the window narrowing the window, narrowing the window and getting closer and closer and closer to what the actual right to what the right actual cost is. Now, what this means, though, is that if you say that

Unknown Speaker  44:48
if you

Matthias Miller  44:50
but what it means is then you don't have to have 100% accuracy on breakroom supplies, but if you say breakroom supplies is going to be 75% of overhead and it's actually 10%? Well, you're gonna see some majorly shifting numbers as we finalize the cost.

Speaker 1  45:21
With is, am I? Well, I guess this is kind of a question for both of you is, the little bucket percentages are always the way that you that Kristin spreadsheet shows that gave, those percentages are always just what part of the whole pie those are within, on the balance sheet, right? Like, the way you're thinking about those, the way you have it on Kristin spreadsheet is you'll never calculate, you'll never set a break room supplies percentage that will always just be whatever percent that is of the whole production overhead

Unknown Speaker  46:01
balance sheet. Um,

Matthias Miller  46:05
well, my understanding, at least initially was that this would be a somewhat manual process. And that you guys have come up with whatever percentages you want. And that my understanding was that yes, we would set whatever the overall percentage is. And we would also set it well, if we wanted to change. I think that the hope was that frequent supplies percentage basically remained static and doesn't change. But if we needed to adjust that, for some reason that we would be able to do that.

Unknown Speaker  46:37
I was thinking about this the other way, like, okay, originally, we were going to,

Unknown Speaker  46:45
I think, keep all the

Speaker 3  46:52
we were going to assign manual projections, like what percentage, each little bucket will be the big bucket what we think. And then with that, we would have had to store all the little bucket numbers on the billing records. And then

Unknown Speaker  47:13
era two,

Speaker 3  47:17
I was understanding that we were going to just store big bucket numbers on the billing records upon which we no longer try to get anything with little buckets, little buckets is always what you said first mark, just a percentage of their space within the big bucket. So what you're describing, now, Matthias, I'm under, in my way of thinking of it, we are once again, allocating little buckets to building records.

Matthias Miller  48:02
And what I had taken away from the conversation was that rather than storing them, we want those to be fluid. And thus, we can just calculate them. What I don't understand about option two, if we only base things off of big, okay, so if you only base things off of big

Matthias Miller  48:28
so if you only base these off of off of big bucket numbers, you determine the estimated percentage.

Speaker 2  48:44
So I'm confused about how that process actually works, then with option two.

Speaker 3  48:53
With option three, are you reconciling each little bucket individually?

Matthias Miller  49:01
Yes, I think you have to give an order to unless you're going to manually create General Journal Entries to allocate four shifts in what you thought you were going to spend versus what you actually did. Well, I don't really understand number two, but yeah, that was that was the thought.

Unknown Speaker  49:24
I mean, just makes more sense. It feels to me like we too much complexity and we're too for what we gain I

Speaker 3  49:40
mean, reconciling every little bucket. We're talking about oh between 15 and 20, a little bucket and reconcile In all of those independently different timeframes I'm not a programmer or a bookkeeper. Maybe it's not that bad

Unknown Speaker  50:11
but I few

Speaker 3  50:22
with little buckets are never, ever even been thought about or talked about other than when we move production overhead from the balance sheet to the income statement. Only then do we ever worry about how much should be in each little bucket? Never ever ever otherwise do we ever worry about that? And never ever ever do we try to project anything because we just use

Unknown Speaker  50:56
the eye for hombres we will return shortly

Unknown Speaker  51:06
we need to be able to mute people

Unknown Speaker  51:14
okay, sir,

Speaker 3  51:15
you've never done it to me yet that maybe you felt like at a time or two? Do you ever mute people when you just get so sick and tired of hearing?

Matthias Miller  51:24
I haven't yet so I need to keep it in my back pocket for adoption. Okay, so let's so let me wrap my head around this. So we have you know production labor, raw material production overhead. And when you reconcile you say I have this expense in production overhead from this date range to this date range. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  52:00
Right one?

Matthias Miller  52:02
Yep, one number. Okay, so when you so we put things in an accrual account accrue accrued, accrued, accrued, accrued, accrued, and not just wanting accrual account, we put them into sub accounts, sub accounts, sub accounts, sub accounts, sub accounts that account and when something goes into into raw materials. Sorry, when somebody goes into FTI, then we have all of these accrual accounts with something in it. And then we move something into

Unknown Speaker  52:31
into the

Matthias Miller  52:34
FTI. How do we know how much to move?

Speaker 3  52:39
Okay, run through that one more time. I understood the first part, or just everything again, all

Matthias Miller  52:48
items. Okay, sounds good. We have let's let's go to your example. Or, yeah, so, breakroom supplies, appreciation, engineering, design, Grant repairs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So now we have production overhead of $6,011. And now a building moves into finished goods. And we need to wait $6? Yep, we need to move that. And that, presumably, so that these things eventually balance out to zero? We need to figure out how much of that to move over. Do we do that right away? Or do we have a different account? That just goes negative, negative, negative, negative, negative, negative? These are the buildings that we've moved over. But

Speaker 3  53:42
okay, sorry to interrupt the we just sold the building and we projected $576 of production overhead on the building we just sold right. So we need to move $576 from the balance sheet to the income statement. Right around?

Matthias Miller  54:08
Yeah, although you're jumping ahead, I was thinking once the building is built, first of all,

Speaker 3  54:12
okay, so So okay, back up. We're built we built the building. Yep. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  54:21
So we got to move 576 to finish goods. Which balance sheet accrual accounts do we debit and by how much

Speaker 3  54:35
Okay, so we are we talking production overhead for the conversation? Sure, we're, okay. We just built the building.

Unknown Speaker  54:48
just built the building. Okay. So

Unknown Speaker  54:56
and you're

Unknown Speaker  54:56
wondering what we do to the balance sheet.

Unknown Speaker  55:04
Yes. Nothing

Matthias Miller  55:12
How does it get over into finished goods?

Speaker 3  55:18
mean the the production overhead as an asset? Yeah. That happens when we pay it.

Unknown Speaker  55:29
So the accrual you

Matthias Miller  55:35
Okay, well, I miss that too. Okay, so production labor is I get it. Okay. Well, so far, so good. So literally the only thing that needs to happen on billing records is moving it from the balance sheet to the income statement. I was missing that part. Goodness gracious, good thing. We're having this conversation. Okay, so then then the building is sold. So. So first of all, we don't.

Unknown Speaker  56:04
Okay, but then. So then how do we determine?

Matthias Miller  56:11
Well, FTI reporting is another question. But we'll get to that.

Matthias Miller  56:25
Let's say for the sake of it just for the accounting example, so the building is sold, then we take it out of but we have individual accrual accounts. Is that right?

Speaker 3  56:38
You mean on breakdown accounts under finished goods? Production? overhead?

Matthias Miller  56:42
Correct? I'm sorry, breakdown accounts under this? Yes, we do. Okay, and then how much? Of which one? Do we move? Do we

Unknown Speaker  56:54
expense out?

Unknown Speaker  56:58
In the in the example, in front of example, we're looking at

Unknown Speaker  57:04
we would

Speaker 3  57:08
remove, move a total of $576. From production overhead asset to production overhead expenses, on the income statement. Okay. And then how are we going to know how much it we're going to take it all out of sub accounts, because the main account just represents the sum total of all the sub accounts beneath it. So it's all going to come up out of breakdown accounts. But it's the percentage that each sub account represents a total, so 17% of 576 would be 95,080 cents. 8% of 576 is 4791. And on down, and by the time we're done, we're going to have moved 576 Production overhead from the asset account on the balance sheet, to the expense account on the income statement. And if we do the math, all all of our sub accounts are going to have reduced by the same amount on the balance sheet as they have increased on the income statement. But 576 is still at the top of each one. Like we've, we've we have credited assets because 76 and we've debited expenses besides 70 safe.

Unknown Speaker  58:46
Hey, so then when we do an FTA report

Matthias Miller  59:06
and we say what is the what we still need a reconciliation process because we need to know how to allocate these big bucket percentages to where

Unknown Speaker  59:24
we do so

Unknown Speaker  59:26
at the end of

Unknown Speaker  59:29
the period.

Speaker 3  59:32
We'll, we'll unfinished goods overhead at the end and we'll probably just reconcile that every quarter. So at the end of the quarter, we'll say we'll disregard little buckets. I couldn't care less about little buckets. How much production overhead costs did we incur did we pay for

Unknown Speaker  59:55
during this period

Speaker 3  59:57
and in the example we're looking at here Mark's example is going to be $1,201

Unknown Speaker  1:00:07
that's a little confusing.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10
Let's make it easy.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
Instead of

Speaker 3  1:00:15
$576 we discovered that we actually pay for 10% more than that. So instead of $576 we actually paid for $633.60

Unknown Speaker  1:00:33
So now we know that well I should have gone off to the building number the billing number is $6,000 and we projected $576 But we discover that it was actually

Unknown Speaker  1:00:55
six count of dollars

Speaker 3  1:00:58
we actually paid for $600 worth of production overhead during this period instead of 576. So 676 So $24 We are projections were $24 Low make sense that far? Yeah. So what are we going to do with the $24 we are going to apply $24 to that building record. Oh, it's already sold. Okay, because it's sold. We're going to apply $24 to the income statement. So we're planning for dollars how much of that is going to be breakroom supplies and then we'll use whatever percentage is current at that point. I don't know what I mean if it's instead of 17% If it's 16.6% that means $24 times 16.6% $3.98 The break room supplies this is what we we usually call a variance if anything

Matthias Miller  1:02:34
Yes, I'm going to have to pause just for three minutes here I apologize

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Hello worry okay, so So then that variance

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
gets broken out based on the current distribution current current balance as of right now current point in time like current however the balance sheet is slice and dice that right now that's how we slice and dice up the variance

Matthias Miller  1:04:01
okay Mary looks like he dropped off as well we'll be right back

Speaker 3  1:04:07
all right, we're I ran to the Get Some Fresh my tea Did you say some

Unknown Speaker  1:04:18
Yeah, he's just gonna be right back. Oh, sorry

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
so Mary that your name

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
Are you on the other call?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
which can't be

Speaker 3  1:04:47
Oh, are you listening to me? Are you listening to that? For both? I want the actual I was gonna be small talk. Nevermind.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:56
It's okay. I think he just went to get something Oh understand Alright, I'm back

Speaker 3  1:06:09
you're here. You got your people back up.

Matthias Miller  1:06:14
We're working on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
This is not the this is not the worst. not the ideal way to have things go down

Speaker 3  1:06:28
it's just like a hunky dory little somebody like Lee or is it like Charles Schwab or Edward Jones? Oh

Matthias Miller  1:06:37
well it's faith builders and they send out their email for their tax credit applications and so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
it's a little bit more

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
I don't know that I'd call him Charles Schwab they're really good to work with but it's a little tiny bit of egg on your face to have these these emails going out to people in them trying to submit applications and networking and having to scramble to get things turned around

Speaker 3  1:07:11
how do they handle finished good like I'm just joking

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
just writing checks and they give you tax credits that's how they handle it

Speaker 3  1:07:29
well I don't know Are you ready to talk Are you still

Matthias Miller  1:07:33
yeah no I'm good I'm ready go

Speaker 3  1:07:37
oh, I don't know that I really have anything else to say other than I clearly understand now where we were missing each other and I understand Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
Okay, now am I right that we are we are still going to be entering in we're still going to be entering what the actual costs were. Sorry

Speaker 3  1:08:12
Okay Is your question when we in when we acquire the asset, like the production overhead asset when we pay for when we pay for breakroom supplies. Are you asking you if we're going to record them as breakroom supplies?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:29
No, I'm asking if here's what

Matthias Miller  1:08:40
sorry, hang on, I gotta check one more thing yet.

Matthias Miller  1:09:43
Okay, well we think we have a way to get all of the field applications maybe. Okay, now I'm back. Okay. So when when we say. So we would not be reading these numbers directly off the balance sheet we would be at least pretty sure omitting the actual costs, we would still have a reconciliation process that says, for this period, the total big bucket number was this. And if you have a situation where production overhead, you know, you bought a new forklift and or that's not the right thing, but Black Friday sale, this is my favorite example, Black Friday sale and everybody got new tools because of it, but you want to expense it out over a number of months, then you would say overhead, you know, this much of overhead gets applied over these months. And so we still calculate big bucket numbers.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
too, to to calculate costs, or no?

Speaker 3  1:10:50
Let's do the Black Friday example. Again, Kristin. I don't know if you got her email. She's asking. Are we still in the code house zoom link? I'm getting a bad gateway there. No idea what that means?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:03
Let me see if Oh, well, I'm getting a bad gateway error as well. I will send her that's weird. I'm sending her the direct links you can use.

Matthias Miller  1:11:40
Let me let me think this that that particular question gets a little dicey. So I want to see if I can hold off on that. So in the simple scenario, anytime we expense something out, we will use the current percentages on the balance sheet as of today. Is that right?

Speaker 3  1:12:03
Right. And it could actually if we sell a building now and then an hour later, we sell another one. The percentage could change in between there, hypothetically.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
Sure. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
But the number one important thing is that these numbers match is that the grand total matches in by using percentages will continually readjust the sub item breakdowns as needed to get it down to where it needs to be needs to be. Now, here's a problem. Black Friday, you normally spend,

Speaker 3  1:12:45
I'm going to interrupt if I get confused. So we don't say the same thing over and over and over. But okay.

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
All right. Perfect. I like it. So Black Friday, you go shopping, and there's some really, really good deals. And normally, you spend $1,000 a month on tools, and this month Hang on, she's still having the same problem.

Matthias Miller  1:13:26
Okay, normally you spent $1,000 a month and November you decide to spend 15,000 Because you got some fantastic deals. And so now, we

Speaker 3  1:13:41
also need to spend 1000, but that's better. 15,000 This time, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:13:47
Yep. And then you. Okay, so then, right after Black Friday, we go make a sale to teaching. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:00
we need to pay it first, don't we?

Matthias Miller  1:14:05
Sure. Yeah. Sure. You pay your you pay your you pay for your tools.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:12
It's the balance sheet, and then what happened?

Matthias Miller  1:14:14
And then you sell a building. And then we look at the building and we say, Oh, how should we expense this out? Oh, tools is 90% of our balance sheet right now. Of our overhead right now. It's kind of a made up number. That really kind of ridiculous, but it's 90% of our balance sheet right now. We should. So we're going to allocate 90% to tools. And basically what's going to happen is that you're going to whittle down those tools and try to get it down to zero at the same rate that you're getting everything else down to zero.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:56
Right here with that Well,

Speaker 3  1:15:01
if if, if we were, if we believe that that could happen, this scenario you just gave, I would not be good with it. But what's actually going to happen is, we're going to have let me think we're going to have a lot of production labor, on our balance sheet at any given time, because it's going to be representing all of our inventory, which is a couple million dollars. So the scenario you just gave, will happen. However, the scale that is going to happen like Black Friday sale by $15,000, were the tools instead of the $1,000? Or the tools that we usually do? We're going to be talking about adding $15,000 to maybe a half a million dollars, or the production overhead. I mean, it's a trade off it, it becomes a decision of like these two options were discussing, are we going to get enough value out of projecting and reconciling each individual breakdown? little bucket to justify the

Speaker 3  1:16:34
complexity of I don't know, is building a more complex or not, but of maintaining.

Matthias Miller  1:16:43
Understood, meaning as long as you're, you're fine with that. And finally, the implications of it, I certainly have no reason to push you in a different direction. This is I believe, wildly simpler than where we had been, which is good news. It's a little hard for me to predict what possible what what other potential issues could we run in? Okay, and then, on a configuration standpoint, as far as how to configure the only thing that needs to happen is that we need an automatic process to account for variance on a per building basis. Well, sorry, let me back up. No process for moving from from accrual to inventory because it goes straight to inventory inventory. On delivery of building, we create the expense transaction, we expense it out. And then we have an follow up automatic process that happens daily or however often we want to that recalculates.

Matthias Miller  1:18:05
Well, whenever we close whenever we close one of these numbers, sorry, we have a an account closing process. Whenever we close the period, then we go back and recalculate all of the buildings. And then we look at

Unknown Speaker  1:18:22
let's start over because I'm lost.

Matthias Miller  1:18:25
Okay. Okay, what are the things that need to happen in terms of automation or whatever it needs to happen? Nothing needs to happen to move, we're no longer using accrual accounts. So as expenses show up, they're immediately going on to finished goods. Inventory. Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:44
Right. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:18:46
The one the one teeny little exception to that not an exception. The the raw materials, as they show up, they go into raw materials, and when we build the building the raw materials move from one balance sheet account to the other, but not the labor or not the overhead.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:08
Right. Good point. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:19:12
Kristen is on now. Hey, Kristin. And okay. So, when a building is built, we take our estimated raw materials and we move it from raw materials to FDI raw materials. Or if you press OK, then production labor production overhead, nothing needs to happen because those are going on to the FDI asset accounts directly. And then, when we when we then there's two cases one we sell the building before we reconcile, we sell the building before we reconcile So then we take each of these big buckets, and we allocate them to the appropriate expense accounts in proportion to the current sub account.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
Sub expense accounts.

Matthias Miller  1:20:22
No, we didn't get into I'm sorry. It all goes into a single expense account. But we, but we proportionally pull from the respective assets sub accounts. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
Okay. So, sale, single expense account, pull from portion that proportional, that's it. sub accounts. Okay. And then

Matthias Miller  1:21:00
later, we close out a period. And just, again, the building's already been sold. So what we do is we say, oh, sorry, that was Mark. Mark, you back.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
I am Chris, I'm trying to get on.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:19
Yeah, I jumped in. Okay, we got Kristen here as well.

Matthias Miller  1:21:26
So Dave, and I have been talking and he cleared up a major misunderstanding that I had, which is greatly improving this process. So I've been walking through the process

Unknown Speaker  1:21:40
of what all happens and how. So

Matthias Miller  1:21:48
I'll try to make this fast and get you caught up mark. All production overhead and labor expenses go direct to the finished goods, asset accounts, they just get entered there. So there's nothing special that needs to happen to move to. To adjust those when a building is built. Raw materials, we estimate a percentage as specified previously, and we move that much from raw materials to FDI materials. When a building is built, then when a building is sold, then before we have actual numbers, then we say, here's what we think it's going to cost. And we pull that from all the the respective FTA sub accounts in proportion to their current balances as percentage of total. So for example, if if office supplies or I forget what it was office supplies is, is 10% of overhead, then if the current balance sheet shows office supplies at $100, in office supplies is $1,000. And we would move then we would allocate 10% of the overhead expense from office supplies. And we would expense it out on a single on a single overhead expense account. And we would do that for production labor and

Unknown Speaker  1:23:19
materials as well.

Speaker 1  1:23:24
When you say and then set out you're talking about work shows up on the income statement then? Correct. Okay, so at that point on the income statement, then there wouldn't be a break down. No.

Matthias Miller  1:23:40
Not as it stands. Now. We can talk about whether you need to break down or not.

Speaker 3  1:23:45
Now, okay, are you saying? Matthias, are you saying there's there won't be little buckets on the income statement?

Matthias Miller  1:23:56
Well, that's what I had just said, but I can be told I'm wrong if I'm wrong. Well,

Speaker 3  1:24:02
I mean, the only reason that we're putting little buckets on the on the balance sheet is so we can have big little buckets on the income statement on the income statement is where it's important.

Matthias Miller  1:24:14
Sure, okay, fine. I don't know if that makes any difference. So we figured out that the the, we figured out the numbers and each balance sheet, item has a corresponding income statement account, we, we we move move it from the from this balance sheet, sub account to the income statement sub account. Everything's good and you get the itemized detail no problem.

Matthias Miller  1:24:52
Okay, and then we go through and we say, we get to

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
we get to To

Matthias Miller  1:25:02
the end of the quarter, and we say we're going to reconcile production overhead. And we say so, and we say, well, we thought production overhead, we allocated this much to production overhead in buildings for buildings built in quarter, one, but the actual amount was this amount. Well, what do we do, then? Well, we take so production overhead.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:38
We

Matthias Miller  1:25:41
are sorry, my brain is getting a little tired. But so we have, we have $1,000, leftover in production overhead that should not be in there. And so we take that $1,000. And we split it up proportionately, based on all the production overhead sub accounts. And we move all of that into one single into a production overhead variance account expense, to move it from the balance sheet and income statement. Is that part correct? Let's,

Speaker 3  1:26:16
let's do that again. So we're at the end of the period. And we want to do a, an overhead reconciliation.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
So we start there.

Matthias Miller  1:26:40
Okay, so we run the numbers, and we have $1,000. Too much left in the we our estimate was $1,000. Too low. So we did not move at nine now.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59
How did we How did we determine that we're $1,000 off?

Matthias Miller  1:27:04
Well, we take a look at Oh, we basically take a look at expense. We take a look at what we do you look at debits and credits in the overhead account and sub accounts, excluding all the adjustments for buildings. And by doing that, we figured out what was the actual cost of production overhead in quarter one, and it was $43,120. And then we said, then we go look at all the buildings built during that period. And we say, what did we think it was supposed to be? And we add up all the production overhead numbers that we stomped on the building records. And we say for the buildings built in that period, the actual number was 40 know what we estimated what he thought it was going to be was $42,120 whoop dee doo off by $1,000. So there's $1,000 sitting in production overhead asset account that needs to be expensed out as a variance. So then we take that $1,000, and we divvy it up the same way that we divvy it up. If you have other transactions that we're pulling from there based on sub account ratios. And we divvy up that $1,000 And it all hits a single it hits a single production overhead variance account on the income statement.

Speaker 3  1:28:57
Two things that that I'm envisioning differently. One, one is that $1,000 That we have the $1,000 We're off. We we want to allocate $1,000, to all the buildings that were built during that period. And all of the buildings that were built during that period that haven't been sold, we simply update the production overhead on those buildings. Now all the buildings that were sold, that is what becomes the variance. And that is what we then move from the balance sheet to the income statement, but we move it we don't put it in a single variance account. We move it exactly the same way as we did earlier. We have have maybe $329 That for buildings that were sold. And then we use that current percentage to put it into a little buckets. Does that make sense?

Matthias Miller  1:30:18
Okay, so you're, so you're not wanting to show variance? Wait. Not sure. But for buildings that are sold, so good point about that I missed. I missed that, for buildings that are sold. And we have an adjustment to me walk me through what that adjustment looks like, again.

Speaker 3  1:30:42
The buildings that were sold, we have, let's say, to keep it easy, we have $300 that we would have wanted to push out to the building records. But they're never sold. Therefore, we need to do the variance thing. And the way we do that is we take Okay, so we have $300 of production overhead, that we need to move from the balance sheet, the income statement. Okay. So we move $300 Out of the production overhead account on the balance sheet, how do we know how much to take out of all the little buckets? Because we got to take it out a little buckets beneath it. So we use the fancy current percentages.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:36
Make sense? Yep. That's,

Speaker 3  1:31:39
and then we move it over to the income statement to production overhead expenses, how are we going to know how much to put into each little bucket? Same thing?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:54
Yeah. Now,

Speaker 3  1:31:58
we definitely are going to want to know what that variance is. And that's what I had reference to about that report, I think we're going to want to have a report that we can see what the variance was. Because that's going to help us in updating our percentage, you know, to get more and more and more accurate, but I don't think we want to show the variance on our financials, because all of a sudden we're showing on our financial financial issues show what actually happened. We don't want to be explained to everybody. Yeah, that's how far we were off. And then here's how we corrected it is just unnecessary drama.

Speaker 2  1:32:43
Okay, so I apologize again, because I'm getting pulled in a few different directions. Bottom line is that we so

Matthias Miller  1:33:08
apologize. So we so we break it down into small piece pieces, but we still expense it out. We don't put it under a variance account.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:17
Right. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:33:25
Because for all intents purposes, as far as the financials are concerned, that is production overhead. It is breakroom supplies, depreciation, engineering and design Rent Expense repairs and maintenance shop supplies.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:45
Doing I think we need good neighborhood.

Speaker 3  1:33:50
Oh, we very, very, very, very clearly need to know what the variance is. So we can update our percentages. But I don't think we want to muddy up our financials with that where we have to explain to everybody what a variance is. And what we need to add to what to determine what our actual

Unknown Speaker  1:34:12
taxes were. Understand

Speaker 1  1:34:16
game. I think one thing that would be worth considering though is Scott throw this out there for whatever it's worth. One of the primary reasons for accounting is to give management tools to see where they're going and where they should be focusing on. And there was a good example in one of these books that I had on basically saying a variance if you have a variance that is one of the key places where accounting good to be spending time on bringing it to management's attention because if you have a large variance, it basically means that something went south have, and that's want to draw attention to that. So I'm just throwing that out there. And it could be worth thinking that we want to have that listed as its own sub account. So if we either way, we want to know what the variance was whether we want to show it as its own GL account on the income statement, I think it could be worth deterring for that reason, but

Speaker 3  1:35:34
it feels to me a little bit like a work order. Any work orders are critical to pay attention to and let's get this fixed. That I don't really see what think we want to put the work orders on the invoices. Like the variance is, is something for accounting to work on the accounting system, not necessarily a manager expenses better thing?

Matthias Miller  1:36:17
Well, I have a, I have a proposal. In the short term, we could allow you at each level, you know, for each of these asset accounts to say, each of these asset accounts will have to be linked to an expense account, we can also let you link it to a variance account, which means that you can link it to the same expense account, or you can link it to a separate variance account. And I can definitely say you guys can have this discussion offline, we can support both paths, and we can keep moving.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:46
Let's make your Freelancer now busy.

Matthias Miller  1:36:54
Okay, now we have one teeny tiny little wrinkle, which is what I emailed about last night. Which is no, you already answered that game. So periods, costs for periods will always be sequential. They will always be for if you say this is the cost from January one to to January 31. Then the next one is going to start February 1, and it's going to go however far you decide. And there is no allocating costs across multiple periods. It's just this is what the costs are the period and it gets allocated appropriately.

Speaker 3  1:37:38
Now what happens when we allocate costs to previous periods, is we expense them immediately. So it would probably not be the best idea to allocate a lot of very large costs to periods going very far backwards, where a lot of the buildings are probably already sold. Because we're going to expense them immediately. I mean, we could go, we don't want Yeah. So just from a day to day bookkeeping perspective, it would be smarter to lean towards allocating costs out more than allocating them backwards, right? Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:38:32
And of course, it's up to you to make sure that when you do that, that you enter the numbers appropriately or do whatever you need to do to finagle it correctly. But that point, that's an accounting question, not a software question.

Speaker 3  1:38:47
Now one thing I don't quite clearly understand if is, is tell me what happens when I want to allocate costs out so I have just Black Friday sale $15,000 and understand what that does to the balance sheet that you mentioned earlier. But aside from that, I want to allocate that expense. I didn't think this through some making it up as I go. I want to allocate that expense for the period starting November 1 through December 31. Okay, yep. Okay, the $15,000 went straight onto the balance sheet into the asset account. Got that

Unknown Speaker  1:39:41
not tomorrow I build a shed now. Oh, oh. Oh, okay. I get it. I just

Matthias Miller  1:40:00
If you get one of two options when you have to use the estimate until, until, so if you spread an expense across three, three months, is not using your example, then you have to wait until the end of those three months to finalize pricing on those numbers. Or you can have, if you can figure out a way that you can do journal entries, so that this expense hits the inventory accounts once a month, then or this, yeah, it hits the inventory accounts every month through that period, then you can reconcile monthly. Or if you want to keep a piece of paper beside your desk that says that expenses are going to show this amount, but actually we're going to adjust it down because there's some other stuff that we're waiting to expense out, then well, you can do it that way too.

Speaker 3  1:40:55
Okay, so I am still a teeny little bit lost. So Black Friday sale $15,000 ching, ching ching, ching ching. And then the next day we build or we sell, we sell, we sell a building the next day

Unknown Speaker  1:41:15
didn't get

Speaker 1  1:41:17
quite clarify your $15,000. Is that on your Black Friday sale? Did you sell $50,000 worth of buildings?

Speaker 3  1:41:24
No, we bought $15,000 for the tools because they were so cheap. And then we paid for them. We put them on the balance sheet under assets. But then we said you know what, we want to spread that out through the end of the year because that's too much tools you follow thus far. We want to spread that out over two periods. Okay, the next day, I sold a shit. And my projection for production overhead is 9.6%. So 9.6% we build the building, nothing happens to the balance sheet. And we put 9.6% times $6,000 equals $576 on the building record as our projected production overhead is your fancy functionality. Matthias is it going to

Unknown Speaker  1:42:32
also add

Matthias Miller  1:42:38
a can I'm gonna I'm gonna have to drop off for just one moment I'll be I'll be right no worries worry.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:48
Dave, are you still on? Here? I think you've got a point what

Unknown Speaker  1:42:57
I'm drinking my mouth

Speaker 1  1:43:02
sometimes use my tea to make make Chai that makes I think it makes as good or better Chai then this use black tea you tried already. But so you'd obviously use your 9.6% I think but in your I think your proportions or whatever category this is because you made such a huge purchase. Like your tools and supplies. I think if you were to sell that building the next day your overall you'd still be $576 but your your tools bucket would be way too large in proportion, I think are much larger in proportion because now that's such a much larger part of production overhead than it had been because of the big purchase you made.

Speaker 3  1:44:11
Right You must have been off when we went through that earlier.

Speaker 1  1:44:17
Okay. Obviously, are we how are you Yeah. Overcome that

Speaker 3  1:44:22
it's a trade off. I mean, the only way to overcome that is is to do the the the line by line, sub account reconciliations keeping everything separate. And and I mean it

Unknown Speaker  1:44:41
you also do will projections on whether

Unknown Speaker  1:44:51
so, you also have

Speaker 1  1:44:56
or you're also going to set projection projected percentages. What are the sub accounts?

Unknown Speaker  1:45:07
No. Or sorry, I

Speaker 1  1:45:11
kind of interrupt How are you going to keep that from that tools percentage from going from a typical 17 to maybe 30%

Speaker 3  1:45:22
We're not there, if we want to if we want to, I mean the past 3040 minutes we've just been talking about the more simple method, if we want to fix that, we'll need to go with the other method, because this method won't, it will be exactly what you fit I think in reality is going to be a very small problem because we're going to have very large amounts of production overhead on our balance sheet. And it's very likely not going to go from 17% to 34% or whatever. It is going to be more like going from 17 to 18.5 maybe 19. It's it's going to boil down to a decision like is the increase accuracy we get out of doing it the other way going TO to justify the extra work are probably more so bookkeeping and maintenance more so probably than programming. Don't know I mean, if there's a way to stay on top of I think I like this this

Unknown Speaker  1:46:41
simple method better or just because of I think it gives us the results that are both enough to be perfect for management purposes and it seems a little bit more manageable but

Speaker 3  1:47:01
if there's a way to do line by line and stay on top of things that the editor I mean, I would like that better. I would like reading those financial better I'm just not sure that it's worth the

Unknown Speaker  1:47:19
reconciling

Unknown Speaker  1:47:22
15 to 20 different accounts all on different time periods. So

Speaker 1  1:47:31
I like to map this out on a spreadsheet but I don't disagree. I think this is the cleanest way. But following this train of thought you could almost never take an asset account or Okay, let's say some reason we no longer do breakroom supplies at one location. And

Unknown Speaker  1:47:56
that that

Speaker 1  1:47:58
even though we don't rob a whole year, we don't make any purchases. And 11 months out of the year, we don't make any purchases. That percentage is just going to get smaller and smaller and smaller just read out on it'll, in a sense almost never go away.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:18
You're saying we just violent we've just added digit every week. Yeah, I think that's what

Speaker 1  1:48:25
would happen. percent, nine, eight. Well, I think that's a bookkeeping thing where we say You know what, this is $500 in the asset account, let's just push it into the miscellaneous account or

Unknown Speaker  1:48:47
something like that.

Speaker 3  1:48:51
Yeah, the other thing I like about this is, is it allows us to to tweak and change our GL accounts as needed without having a living nightmare. Like if our GL accounts need to change for whatever reason on any of the finished goods, all we need to do is change them on the balance sheet and on the income statement, and keep going if we try to keep track of

Unknown Speaker  1:49:27
all the sub accounts on all buildings. When we change something we're still going to have breakroom supplies, showing up on our income statement for two three or maybe four years while those buildings get sold, unless we change it on each individual building.

Speaker 1  1:49:57
No, this change But changing GL accounts on the balance sheet, like you just described, this would only take effect moving from that point forward, right? Like previous income statements would still show breakroom supplies, or whatever it was that was prior.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:20
Actually, it would.

Speaker 1  1:50:24
Or a better example would be if you split. If you split tools into two categories, halfway through 2023. Income statements for the first half of 23 would have one category remain remainder would have to.

Speaker 3  1:50:41
Yeah, now I think we could, we could go in there and do a journal entry hoping we can do journal entries, and move what we believe is the appropriate amount out into the second account. Like we'd say, well, we believe that now that we've split them up all of our tool expenses up until we've made the switch 40% of that should be shop tools and 60% of that should be Office tools, whatever. Then we could take it that way.

Speaker 1  1:51:20
When you say you were saying reconciling all of the sub accounts, you would reconcile those the same way that we were talking about larger ones, like you would look at what is the why did we allocate it for that period? Why did we incurred and then you would allocate those you would allocate? Like Matthias example $1,000, if you have that on a sub account, you would allocate a proportion of that to inventory that unsold buildings and the rest would be allocated to the cost of goods sold as a go, there was a variance on buildings that were sold, already produced and sold in that period. Is that how you're reconciling each sub account? Okay.

Speaker 3  1:52:07
Well, okay, that's how we reconcile with the simple method with reconciling each sub account individually is something entirely different.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:27
Oh, wait, um, which back just so you guys know.

Speaker 1  1:52:35
Go ahead. He was just catching me up on what what I had missed.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:40
Okay, so that, go ahead. Good.

Speaker 3  1:52:47
Mark was just pointing out that that that potential error that would occur that will occur when we have the Black Friday sale, and the tools we buy $15,000 with the tools in the tool account, shoots way up. And then therefore, the next day we start having, you know, much higher tooling costs. Well

Matthias Miller  1:53:21
and to that point, we can use my same solution that I proposed yesterday to account for that.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:29
I think Oh, you mean, okay. Well,

Speaker 3  1:53:42
so that brings that gives me a two fold question. You're saying I'm not asking the question yet. I'm confirming confirming that you're saying we're way over time.

Matthias Miller  1:53:57
Yeah, I'm gonna have drop your very shortly. Okay,

Speaker 3  1:54:05
let me keep this to 20 seconds or less. The solution you propose yesterday where we can we can allocate out expenses. is let's say we did that we had Black Friday sale. We bought picking up the tools and we put them on the balance sheet. We allocate them out overnight, the next few periods we go home. Tomorrow we sell a building in our production overhead percentage projection is still at 9.6% which is $576. Is your proposed solution. I'm understanding is not going to be able to put projected out expenses. Add it to that is just going to sit there and wait until we reconcile that. Right? Well if

Matthias Miller  1:55:07
we, if we don't have time to get into it, but basically what I'm you can think of this as progressively accurate and expenses. And so I don't have I don't know, I'm getting into the weeds of this. And I'm going to run out of time and I'm going to run over, I'm afraid. I, here's my proposal. I don't know if I've got time. I'm mostly out tomorrow. I don't know if I've got time yet this afternoon or not, I would like to take everything that we talked about, redo this whole thing. And then in light of that context, revisit this whole reallocation of this projection, projected expenses, and come back. But the short answer is, we can if you if I don't even know if I should try to get an answer. But if you have a projected expense, we figured out what timeframe, we assume that you're going to build the same number of buildings across an entire timeframe. And then as buildings get built, and as as time progresses, and we continue fine tuning those historical, actual costs closer and closer and closer and closer, and, you know, anticipating that it's not going to be wildly off but understanding that it might be or we could take the approach that this literally is the actual cost for a period and just gets broken out across time and so and you have to allocate this to specific periods. Anyway, um, thank you to the we're at a time. I think I need to go back for the stuff back together with what we discussed in and take it from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:09
Good. Good.

Matthias Miller  1:57:15
Awesome. Well, we will talk Monday then, we should

Unknown Speaker  1:57:19
get by
