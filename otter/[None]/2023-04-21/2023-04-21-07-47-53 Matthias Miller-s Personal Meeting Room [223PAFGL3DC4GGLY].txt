Good morning no one has gone

Unknown Speaker  00:24
was it seven almost eight o'clock for you?

Unknown Speaker  00:28
Yeah almost almost. So

Speaker 1  00:35
my opinion from yesterday's marketing call this is not a marketing problem that we have

Unknown Speaker  00:42
a sales problem it is a

Speaker 2  00:51
it is an owner head trash problem that is resulting in sales problems.

Unknown Speaker  00:56
It's a owner head trash problem

Unknown Speaker  01:02
What did you see doping and sales?

Speaker 1  01:04
What is what is a head trash problem? Have

Unknown Speaker  01:09
you ever got stuff in your head that makes you do stupid stuff?

Speaker 1  01:13
The truth? Okay, cracking up. Have you have you looked at sales this week?

Speaker 2  01:21
Oh, Ginger has been the ginger has been nailing it. And

Speaker 1  01:26
we want to know why Ginger has been nailing it. Why? I called her up on Tuesday. And I said I was I was rather mean to her. I said you've gotten lazy. You had all these sales the beginning of the year. You got lazy. You're not posting on your Facebook site. You're not? You are. You're not putting in the work. I said no. And to prove it. I said I've got 50 bucks for every sale that you make this week. I'll pay you personally. I'm currently out three. I'm currently at 300.

Speaker 2  02:05
Well, if you take it off today, so you're getting for me, that's where it stops.

Speaker 1  02:09
Thankfully, thankfully, she had made two sales before $400.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
I just need a kick in the seat of the pants.

Unknown Speaker  02:22
Dude, I'm telling you like

Speaker 1  02:29
I feel like if you want to make sales right now, sales can be made. Ginger has been whining and complaining to me about it's been slow. Nobody's coming on the line. It's not happening. And finally I just caught up said you're being lazy.

Unknown Speaker  02:55
And $75,000

Unknown Speaker  02:59
boom for not being lazy.

Speaker 1  03:02
And you know what the funny part is, I can show you the discord messages after that where she admitted. She was just sitting back and she was just emailing customers rather than calling them and she was not putting in hard work.

Speaker 1  03:19
Dude, I'm telling you this. Okay, you want to know what drives me crazy about salespeople. And I've heard this before, and I've rolled my eyes and I've rolled my eyes and I rolled my eyes to do with keeping them fired up. And I'd like this is why I told you I never want to be a sales manager ever in my life. Because this kind of stuff drives me nuts. I'm like, I show you once I show you twice I taught you how to do it now go be responsible and act like an adult.

Unknown Speaker  03:52
But no, no.

Speaker 1  03:56
So this idea was not mine, just FYI. So that was it last week or the week before I was talking with Robert in Ohio. The district manager there and I said what's going on with sales. And these were his words. He's like dealers have gotten lazy. We've got all these sales the beginning of the year because their sales were done ridiculously too. He's like wait, we had all these sales everybody was was really excited and and then we had a little fluctuation in the market. People quit buying for about a week. And they got lazy. And they're like, Oh, it'll just come back. It'll just come back. And so he did the $50 challenge thing. And his sales went from well not have to go back through wallboard, but it went from like 70 like less, I think was less than 100,000 to almost 200,000

Unknown Speaker  04:51
Hold it one week's time

Speaker 2  04:57
so Well, it'd be worth it to me to go do that challenge with each of the salespeople.

Speaker 1  05:06
I'm telling you right now, I would, I would dare you to tell Marcus and Kelvin. And I would dare you to tell these guys. You guys are being lazy. You're not actually trying to close customers. You are just sitting there and waiting for customers show up in the lot. You're not quote, you're not, you know, aggressively texting and calling customers. I will give you $50 For every sale that you make this week, and you watch sales go through the roof

Unknown Speaker  05:42
Did you Did you call her up to talk to her?

Speaker 1  05:45
Ginger? Yeah, I told her I told her straight out on the phone.

Speaker 1  05:54
Look, you have to have some, you know, some relational capital to do this kind of thing. Like I told the end this morning. I'd like to call Floyd and tell him the same thing. Because I frankly think he's he plays with his toys too much with high level and sitting there and I think there's too much toy playing and not enough aggressively contacting customers and trying to close them. And I frankly think if if Floyd got his button gear, he turned 50,000 60,000 in a week. Okay, so because FYI, FYI. I think over half of the sales that ginger clothes this week or online leads

Unknown Speaker  06:40
did you disappear? Hello. Hello.

Unknown Speaker  06:47
I'm gonna start playing by Chris Stapleton again.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
He disappeared.
