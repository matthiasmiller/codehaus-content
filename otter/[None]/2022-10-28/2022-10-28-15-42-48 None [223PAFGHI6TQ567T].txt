A very here's an idea that I have on how to improve for doing project management. I think instead of tracking meeting notes on a per person basis, I think we should track them on a per project basis. I think we should have meeting notes for every sales related meeting for every accounting related meeting for every maybe it's just those two for now. And in that Google Doc for that meeting, with those notes, we should have a link to the incident and then I want to also be in that document and the things that should move over into the incident that the follow up, or maybe I'll do it myself, I don't really know. But I want to wait where I can capture notes and ideas. And then and then the actual action items would go into the incident for follow up. So here's the specific changes for you. I don't know if we have one or more documents for the sales team, but we should start having one. You should start sending that out. As part of the as part of the

a meeting. Heads up for the meeting. For the for the sales level and do the same thing on the IFR call. Have one so that would be one for the accounting side. And

I guess it's maybe just those two documents. So just start setting those up. And then what I want to start doing on the weekly review is going through those documents or periodically during the week, go through those documents and pick out what are the most high priority things that need to get done. Move those up to the very top and start working on those. Sorry, not from the document. This is coming from the incident. I don't know if it's making sense, but I can explain it more. Those are my thoughts I think we're making progress in the project management side. It's just a matter of figuring out what works for what works for me and how to bring him into that.
