You know, I think one of the closest things I can think of in terms of personal emotional connection, I guess, well, yeah, there's, there's a few things maybe one is one is probably coming more from my brother, in terms of the opportunity that he saw to help these businesses, the one coming most directly from me is really tied to and I think you could probably massage this to make it fit but being the feeling the pressure as an employee, and and feeling the pressure to be in the, in the operational side of the business, and the kind of the overwhelm that came with that, knowing that I really wanted to be in more of a leadership role. And in the same way, there's kind of the same pressure of, you know, these business owners wanting to be in a specific spot in their business, whether it's just being able to spend their time more strategically in their business or being able to actually, you know, do the actual work of the business. And I think I think possibly the emotional connection comes down to being able to draw that parallel and, and seeing software as a tool to do that.
