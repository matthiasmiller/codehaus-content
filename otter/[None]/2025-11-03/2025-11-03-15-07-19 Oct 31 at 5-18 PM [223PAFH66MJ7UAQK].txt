Hey, Matt, just getting you a voice recording. So a couple things with Scott. One thing is he's probably going to have a little bit different type of leads. And I don't know if we want to call it a pipeline. So I'm wondering if we can develop a secondary pipeline of some type in regard to a long term nurture, with a round robin off of that. So he's going to be working more at establishing long term business goals, from what I'm able to tell, and long term relationships with companies for recurring revenue. So my thought process behind it is possibly doing a business card with a QR code that automatically opens a different phone number. Possibly, anyway we need to talk about kind of the options behind that period and then some other issues. Scott doesn't know how to know if a phone call coming in is for him or if it's not been worked. And I don't know if there's a way to set that in the phone settings or not to my knowledge, is he should only be getting the phone calls assigned to him, period. And then also, there's one more thing I'll send you a little bit later. So some of this is probably more of an open ended discussion. It's also a pain point for us right now, but just wanted to give you a kind of an idea of what we're looking at.
