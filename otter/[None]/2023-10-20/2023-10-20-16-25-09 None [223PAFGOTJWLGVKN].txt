Alright, so a few things about the irrigation number one, when it freezes, there's that little red. Well actually start surfing the beginning. There's a little thing that you put in the irrigation ditch, and that's where that's how you get ditch water. And there's little screen on on there to make sure everything's safe to go through the sprinklers. Then there's the pump, little pump house there, there's a little primer thing when it sticks straight out towards the road. That's used the prime to drain drain water in case it freezes. Otherwise it should be turned the other way. There's a hose hooked up to it where after you drain it, you close up the little red thing in the pump house and then run water to the to the pump and prime it that way. When he freezes, he uses the the air conditioner or sorry the sprinkler head close to the shop takes the head off sprays water into it and that's where he he did to winterize it

from the pump house out to the road along the road down parallel to the sidewalk down to the little sprinkler head over by the house. And there's a main line that goes back. The one going going back by the property line feeds into another one where you can flood do flood irrigation. You just unplug that little one and just flood it and then move the pipes as necessary. You can move the elbow out towards the the elbow by the flood irrigation out towards the fence that you're getting over there where you can take the pipe all the way towards the back and flooded out that way towards the end. And usually you're getting it once or twice a week. For about an hour. swamp coolers disconnected there are flood irrigation gates in the garage. There's a little tool for the sprinkler heads in the garage and the gate closest to the road down to the ditch is what controls our dishwater. So that's about it
