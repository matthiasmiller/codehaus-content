Speaker 1  02:20
Hey, Matt, Hey, Murs, all right.

Speaker 1  02:39
Oh, we good. I didn't share. Share this. All right, there we go, Matt, so we were sorry. I'll wait for you to go ahead. No, dive in. Anything on your mind?

Matthias Miller  02:59
Not, besides getting you guys what you need to know when the

Unknown Speaker  03:09
Zach means you cut this stuff. Okay,

Speaker 1  03:19
sorry, I'm being interrupted here Matt, can I have a minute? Just one minute?

Speaker 2  03:54
Our internet connection is on stable. Well,

Speaker 1  03:57
it's not as good as it was before we know Wi Fi, you know that?

Speaker 2  04:01
Yeah, I know something. Amanda said, heard yesterday was instant, who was acting up my email back, Matt,

Speaker 1  04:09
so we good to go. We looking at this. Come on. We were looking at this the other day, we were on, we were on the platform, and we found some glitches. And I'm not sure if we were just on an older version, or if some of that stuff is still not accurate. Not sure, so we look in where we were here.

Speaker 1  04:56
Let me start over here. I. With the enterprise. Yeah, here some of these. These are decimal points here on the some of the dimensions is, is this just an older version, or is this latest? It's,

Matthias Miller  05:22
it's not an older version. It is a

Speaker 1  05:38
there's a couple items like that that I can show you, if you want to look at those right away, every Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:46
let me just grab a screenshot of this good. Got it all right.

Unknown Speaker  05:50
Next one.

Speaker 2  05:56
How many cans? Yeah, some on those and some on mine. The can

Speaker 1  06:00
quantities, or some of them are showing up like, and some of them are not showing up on,

Matthias Miller  06:11
have you guys filled in all the Camp sizes?

Unknown Speaker  06:16
So we can, I, I'm pretty

Matthias Miller  06:22
sure if you go back, if you hit the back button and hit the menu, go to Advanced,

Matthias Miller  06:41
can't Configure. Can't sizes here.

Speaker 1  06:57
I mean, I these, zeros need to be filled in, yes, Okay, gotcha No, we have not. I Sorry, I forgot. Didn't Yeah, that we can get that done. Yep. All right, back to the last thing was, well, here, let me wrap my Brain around this. Okay, sawing, it was on sewing, I

Unknown Speaker  07:46
so miscellaneous prep, it's showing up like Bucha. Care, here, yeah, like, for example, this, this here job, wave, 2000 Do you see where I'm at 1163, okay, that job, it's saying to cut 269 a quarter and slot. Um, that's instructions from the from the brewer, to cut the 269 and a quarters. Um,

Speaker 1  08:43
uh, hang on here. Raw material info for stalling. So it should say something differently in here. Well, if I go to the schedule here, make sure that was, yeah, that's in the schedule. So am I on the schedule right now, I am on the schedule right now. No, here's the schedule.

Speaker 1  09:11
Slaughter saw, yeah, this is instructions for for the brewer.

Matthias Miller  09:20
So we historically have not split apart between the sorry. We have not historically split part miscellaneous prep between sizing versus sawing.

Speaker 1  09:41
Okay, well, I'm saying the sewing, sewing, raw material, data,

Speaker 1  09:54
what? What is? Yeah, so there is a difference. We have two different categories. Worries, right? So a raw material, info and sawing, like for that job, right there, that's open. Um, that's good. Is that going to be well, I like to go into the item here. Is that all right? Let me, if I can right here. Yes, sorry, right here. What else to do there? Can't I get go into that right there? Matt,

Matthias Miller  10:39
you can go into so the link will take you into the work order. And then you can go into the item from, oh,

Unknown Speaker  10:47
here it is. Now it's going, I don't know if I was being the

Matthias Miller  10:51
little box just copies the number, yeah, oh.

Unknown Speaker  10:56
So here we have.

Matthias Miller  11:00
So then jump into click the ellipsis beside the order item. Are you going down? There's one item on the left where it says wave 50, right there, right here. Okay. And then here's all the info.

Speaker 1  11:23
So description or dimensions and description are the same here. So this is what we're trying to cut level 16, three and a half, 17, 1/8 this miscellaneous prep information here is for the brewer. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. So then you're trying to figure out how we're we're passing that message on to stalling how we we want to try to avoid passing the exact same message to sawing,

Matthias Miller  12:06
so we could,

Unknown Speaker  12:09
right. George, yeah, so this is going to

Speaker 2  12:11
throw a rent I mean, I I can see it common already, yeah. So

Speaker 1  12:15
it could be a glitch. But yeah, Matt, you were saying you were going to say, Well, the

Matthias Miller  12:21
way we would have handled in the Excel sheet, I think, is we've just blinked it out for selling. The way we can handle it going forward is we can have two miscellaneous prep fields, one for selling, one for sizing, yeah. And then we need to go through all of the items and figure out which ones for which one or we could just copy it into both, and you can just check out whichever one, yeah,

Speaker 1  12:52
that would be, I think so, because let me ask this yet, the raw material info for sewing. Is that linked? Is that linked somewhere? Or is there anything migrating into that tab?

Matthias Miller  13:16
Yeah, that came from. Yeah. There's stuff from from Excel that we brought over in there.

Speaker 1  13:21
Okay, sorry, yeah, I guess what I'm meant to ask was maybe not migrating, but is that, Is there information being forwarded from one of the other data entries, like from the sizer window? Is any of that information my uh, being transferred to the raw material? Info, soiling, no, nothing, nothing, okay, what wasn't, wasn't that where we were talking about harrying, the the like, in other words, the raw material for the size, or is the three, Nampa 612, popular data, the raw material for the next machine is what we cut on the size, or was the yield on The yield on the size, or is the raw material info for sawing,

Matthias Miller  14:31
right?

Speaker 1  14:32
But this, this, well I want to go to let's hop over here quick. I

Unknown Speaker  14:43
go

Speaker 1  14:51
right here. So the yield is the 1116, three and a half, 17 and 1/8 now. That's the dimensions that were.

Speaker 2  15:05
What I've been doing with that on the gang. Saw is just came to the 17 on Eighth at all length, and changing the 2200 or whatever we get out of the cans. Yeah, because we're not cut 17 1/8 on the gang. We're cutting the 69 October. And,

Speaker 1  15:21
yeah, wow, do you have an eye to the mess, and that's

Speaker 2  15:30
why, I mean, I just go into the cell and change it and type in long line forever and get rid of the Miscellaneous, right? But

Speaker 1  15:39
for the for the most part, you can you want the size that this is. This information is taken from there. The item data, which is, this is the size that we need. Specifically, it's just not, we can't get to 17, 1/8 on this saw on the sizer, but that's where we're trying to get to. So you'll just change that number to long length. And then this is your instructions for the getting saw right, which might change. So then you'll come in, Matt, what's a sim? I guess there's a couple. Is there a couple of different ways to get to that item data page? Again, like without that? What's the easiest way to get there?

Matthias Miller  16:38
You can also, there's also menu option to search for items, you just put in the item code,

Unknown Speaker  16:44
um, where, sorry, where's that?

Matthias Miller  16:49
If you go to the menu and hit items, they

Unknown Speaker  16:54
free, painted. Man, yeah. Oh, good home, yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:00
Click the Home tab. Yep, they hit items. You can just pick it from the item, drop down, or if you know the customer, whatever,

Speaker 1  17:15
what's wave? George, W, V, A v, what was that item number? Shoot, okay, we'll go back and look at it. Think it was

Unknown Speaker  17:36
21 this one order here,

Speaker 1  17:41
50. All right, I'll try to go see how fast I can go this time. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  17:58
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:02
yeah. Click into that,

Unknown Speaker  18:04
yep, on the boxes.

Matthias Miller  18:06
Oh, no, not on the boxes. The boxes is a copy, yep, all right.

Speaker 1  18:11
What's the copy format the boxes? Sorry, um,

Matthias Miller  18:15
it's if you, if you have a column that's a link, but you want to copy and paste the value out. For some reason it just makes it easy to be able to copy the copy that. It's, it's, it's a platform feature for to make it easy to copy link, link text. Okay,

Speaker 1  18:37
all right, yep. So what was my question? Um, yeah. So the question so George is, this is where he enters the miscellaneous prep instructions. Is that right or the default miscellaneous prep instructions right on this page makes sense. So whatever you want to come up every time comes up here.

Unknown Speaker  19:11
Now that's in the items list, yeah?

Speaker 1  19:19
Well, that that's under, yeah, that's in items correct under each individual, yeah, yeah. And

Speaker 1  19:35
do you, do you want to because Matt, we talked about transferring the yield off the sizes to sawing raw material, info, if it was going to sawing second

Unknown Speaker  19:56
is that set up that way?

Matthias Miller  19:59
I. I probably missed that. No sorry,

Speaker 1  20:06
if sorry, go ahead. Well, what were you I'm not sure if we need to do that. I mean, I'm just trying to make I know we talked about it. Do you want raw material info for sewing, and you can come right?

Speaker 2  20:35
George, if I change that and miscellaneous prep there, it's going to show up installing and well, gang saw us.

Speaker 1  20:44
It would now right map, but you're gonna, you can create a separate one for both, correct so he'll so Matt will create

Speaker 2  20:51
a miscellaneous prep for gang solves and miscellaneous prep for selling

Speaker 1  20:55
sizer, miscellaneous prep and sawing, miscellaneous prep. I

Speaker 2  21:00
So some guys out there don't know need to know that right right

Speaker 1  21:07
there, right in the saw shot, right there's different instructions, just gonna throw a wrench in. So, George, are you comfortable with Okay, So Matt, Matt will add another one of these windows for mis for sawing, miscellaneous prep, which will go to either any of the solves that, like, if it's can attack and slaughter, is going to show up on both, which is fine.

Speaker 2  21:36
And then whichever one you don't need that can just window items. And get rid of, uh, keep the one I need for salt, yeah, keep the one I need for game. So,

Speaker 1  21:46
and that's because Matt, everything's migrated from Excel, right? Some of that, what was, did Excel have miscellaneous prep for both sawing and game. I think

Speaker 2  22:07
he saw split up the song and gang saws, but he didn't do miscellaneous breath.

Speaker 1  22:13
But Matt was there two different miscellaneous prep categories in Excel.

Matthias Miller  22:19
I do not recall seeing it. So the only thing, the only thing, from to my knowledge that could have been the case is if he was ignoring miscellaneous prep for for one or

Speaker 1  22:35
the other. Yeah, well, I would say, then if, if there is Miscellaneous prep, prep data that was transferred or can be transferred. It should all just go to the sizes like because George wasn't using the sewing right anyway, and so it's, if anything, it probably will apply to the size, to the like the gang saw the sizes right, and not to sawing, and then you're going to have to do some Editing. So, so George, I'm my question with with Matt, listening, of course, is, Do do you feel good comfortable with this item page and all the things that? Yeah, yeah, so far, yeah. Because again, Oh, Matt, like, there's a number of, well, want to go to the sewing list here quick or new orders, I guess. No, it's sawing.

Speaker 1  24:09
There's a number of things here that, where does George edit? Information is that on the schedule itself?

Matthias Miller  24:19
No, right like, right here, right here,

Unknown Speaker  24:22
okay, okay, should, should

Matthias Miller  24:25
be, are you not? Are you not able to? For some reason,

Speaker 1  24:30
I'm not trying right now, I guess, like, size or waist here, I could go in here. Yeah, I see, yep, I can edit. I can edit. Let's just recapping what we can edit here. We edit the total pieces, boxes, just the boxes, right?

Matthias Miller  24:54
Matt, just the boxes. Yeah, absolutely,

Speaker 1  24:57
yeah. Inventory, pieces, size or what. Based, can't, size, can't, length, quantity, can't. Notes can be edited. Miscellaneous prep can be edited. And again, that's this, doing it on this page is it will only apply to this order, right? Matt, that is correct. And it'll and it'll hold that change until the order is complete, or if you change it again, correct? And then that order basically, then it carries out once it's complete, then it goes back to whatever's in the item data page

Matthias Miller  25:47
that is correct. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  25:49
that make

Speaker 2  25:51
this mute. So if you wanted to stick you make that change in the items items list, yes, so then we'll say forever, yes.

Matthias Miller  26:03
So really, really, if, if you already push it across, you'll have to change it in both places. You'll have to fix the item. I mean, you'll have to fix it on the, on the cut list here and on the Items page. But then it'll, it'll come across going forward. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  26:19
Yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  26:24
now the sizer can't lengthen inches. Can I change out in the items list to feet instead of inches? Or will it stay inches?

Matthias Miller  26:35
We're currently just throwing it as inches because some of them are odd inches.

Speaker 2  26:43
Is that your question, like the 100 inch? Probably yeah, or 12 foot, two inch, right? All right.

Speaker 2  27:02
But we I just gotta play with it. What's that? Matt, yeah, head around. Okay, yeah,

Speaker 1  27:08
is, is it sure I'm was it showing up inches on the Oh, no, you gotta, you have it showing up feet here. Then, Matt, that's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay,

Speaker 1  27:31
yeah. With that was we tried to, you know, look around, snoop around, whatever. But I think that's, I think that covers, anyway, otherwise it seemed otherwise, it seemed proper, and everything. Matt, okay,

Matthias Miller  27:49
yeah, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  27:56
All right. Well, let's, I'll make those changes. And are you going to be when do you want me to push out those changes? Are you going to be playing playing around with it

Speaker 2  28:13
today? I've got a doctor's appointment I gotta leave at 130 so I'm running pretty much out of time. So I'll probably play with it Monday, sometime. Alright. Now, I got another quick question. Matt, many meetings. Zoom, meetings ago, you said about you can put this on my browser. What do I have desktop and I got, let's see desktop and toolbar. What is the browser? I'm not familiar with that.

Matthias Miller  28:45
By the browser, I just mean like Microsoft Edge or Chrome, or just the the where you pull up, it's the program that pulls up and shows websites,

Speaker 2  28:59
alright? So just pull it off and go into silver loom every time I go into it. Yeah, alright. Got it

Speaker 1  29:10
good, yep. So we got a nice big monitor over here. Matt showed up. We didn't set it up yet. But

Unknown Speaker  29:18
what do you mean? We just set it up. It's rock and roll, man. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:26
it's there. Let's go. You were saying.

Matthias Miller  29:33
He even said in the squeaky voice,

Speaker 1  29:39
Oh, that's wonderful, man. So that's awesome. Well, that's, we're, we're rolling. That means I get a bigger monitor now I can get George's old one.

Matthias Miller  29:53
Boss gets the hand me down monitors,

Speaker 1  29:56
sir. That's, that's good. Hey, so Matthias, you. We where you were you at with next step? Do you do you want to go over any of that stuff? Or do you have any other questions?

Matthias Miller  30:12
Thanks, Matt, if Yeah, you bet. Thanks, George. Have a

Unknown Speaker  30:15
good weekend. Yeah, you too.

Speaker 1  30:17
Do you want to enter this stuff on the can information sometime. Okay, awesome. Alright. Man, Thanks, good dude. Thanks, bro. Yeah, man, go for it. Anything else?

Matthias Miller  30:33
Yeah, let me. Let me pull up. Let me pull up my notes I had.

Speaker 1  30:38
Yeah, I'm grateful for him. He's he's been pretty solid. Man is all the changes the last couple years, last three years, yeah, that's a lot to keep up with. He's been very supportive. That's wonderful. Super supportive.

Matthias Miller  30:56
All right. So

Matthias Miller  31:08
I'm going to shoot I'm going to take over the screen share here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:12
that's fine, sure.

Matthias Miller  31:16
All right, so what the way I'm planning to think about this is basically putting these in as assembly work orders. We'll have, we'll have a list of break times that are standard, and we'll save those. Go ahead, sorry,

Speaker 1  31:37
I have to, I need to refigure my brain. So yep, let me you have a you have a thought process. I'm just trying to mirror a new, maybe a potentially a sort of a new scenario here with what we already have. John did. He did print off a report the other day. And anyway, there's some things we don't have off of there at this point. Did I write that down? Man, I might not write that down anyway. I'm just trying to, I have, there's a couple of, let me, let me make a chicken scratch here, Matt, I'm sorry, okay, I know we needed to, is it? I think it would be helpful if I could go grab so there, there's, yeah, there's a report. Can you run a report from your screen right now?

Matthias Miller  32:48
I can, well, it's not fully hooked up. I can show you the report, but what about running it?

Speaker 1  33:00
That's, oh well, okay, perfect. Hold on. This is fine. In the worker production report on the right, we're showing the sum of the hours, then the quantity, which is, yeah, the amount of Item, Board, feet, some hand machine score summary, which is so the reports can we can generate reports like that. I'm thinking we can do for I think the problem is that we're what we're anyway. I don't think we can do a date range at this point. Sure,

Unknown Speaker  33:54
we definitely need to be able to do a date range. And I know if we do, we already have that in there. Maybe,

Matthias Miller  34:09
I don't know if we do general protection report. We I'm using the wrong app for this. Let me pull up obsidian. That would be easier. I

Matthias Miller  34:34
uh, all right, so I'm.

Matthias Miller  35:08
And we could do a date, date range on this one.

Unknown Speaker  35:13
And, oh, sorry,

Matthias Miller  35:17
go ahead. Oh, and, employee,

Speaker 1  35:18
yeah, employee, and can we do I'm asking, Is it possible to do a report for two employees at a time? Sure, because then we can look at teams and teams productivity like I could say, hey, what if Simon works with with Javi? How does he do when he works with Austin? How much you know, what's we can do? Some comparisons and things. So

Matthias Miller  35:52
it would be all work orders, where the two of them are working together, almost simply, where they're working together.

Speaker 1  36:00
Well, yes or Yeah, and that would be, that would be fine. That would be fine. Or could we look at specific jobs when they're working together? Would that be to like, in other words, I'd say, oh, only on all the this item. How are these two guys doing? Like, can we do that?

Matthias Miller  36:23
I mean, you can layer it, what? What's the, what's the information that you want to know?

Speaker 1  36:38
I just, I want to know how productive you know, the production that happens with, you know, employee a and employee B versus Employee a and employee C or, yeah, how much I'm not saying it. We don't. I don't want to get it, make it, yeah, sorry, no, that's fine. I'm asking at this point. I'm just Yeah. I'm sort of trying to be asked. I want it to be a question, not a here's what we need, type of I

Matthias Miller  37:23
mean, fundamentally, what you're looking for. I mean the way, the way this stuff works, is you want to slice this different directions to for comparison purposes. So one option would be to have a

Matthias Miller  37:58
Yeah, so then, so then what you would do is say, I want to go see when, when Bob, I don't know anybody's names, is working on something, and then, but I want to group it by team. So then here's where Bob is working solo, if he ever does that. And here are all the jobs under that. Then here's when Bob is working with Joe, and here's when Bob is working with Sam, and here's when Bob is working with John, and then you can compare those numbers against each other. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  38:38
yeah or no.

Speaker 1  38:40
I mean, that's yeah, that's the general question that I'm asked. Yes, can, can we do that?

Matthias Miller  38:50
We could? We could do that?

Speaker 1  38:52
Is that fairly simple? Yes, building, okay, great.

Matthias Miller  39:01
And grouping by date might not actually be when you do when you do time based grouping. Do you want to compare months to months, day to day, week to week? Is there anything like that that you want to do comparisons of? Well, at

Speaker 1  39:15
the least, we need to be able to look at it in a pair, in a pay schedule. Sometimes that, or, you know, payroll window, which is 10 days, we at least need to be able to look at that. Okay, I'm not tying it to payroll, but if I was starting from scratch, be 100% tying it to payroll and everything else, but right at some point, at some point, we're going to want this connected to payroll, right?

Matthias Miller  39:51
But we can, we could do a date range, yeah, easily enough.

Speaker 1  39:57
Yeah. Then any. Date range I could I enter in there, any employee names I enter in there, and any items I enter in there, I can get that report. Yep, it's the employees, the dates, the date range and the item, employee or employees item or items, and the date range those three data, sorry, even

Matthias Miller  40:30
customer be fine to just make it a you might not need it. No reason why not.

Unknown Speaker  40:35
Yeah, that sounds great.

Matthias Miller  40:40
And then we are always looking. But even when you choose an I, well, obviously item and customer, but when you're choosing employees, we will always look at entire job. Do you work? I mean, we don't have to. We can also say, I want to look at the whole job, or I want to just look at at specific employees. Well,

Speaker 1  41:05
yeah, I mean, if I Well to answer your first law. Mean, we do need to be able to separate it from seven o'clock on Thursday to 430 on Wednesday, 10 days later, because that's our pay schedule like so that's not always going to include an entire job, but we are entering the data for each specific day, so it should be there,

Matthias Miller  41:39
right? It wouldn't be for a job, it would be for a work session, unless it should be for a whole job.

Unknown Speaker  41:53
Not but it shouldn't be, no, yeah,

Matthias Miller  41:58
so when you say employee,

Matthias Miller  42:08
wait a minute, we have individual we have individual contributions, right? So, so we don't actually care about we just care about individual employee productivity for the sake of reporting, and here, we just want to be able to group by team, which is Who else was, who all was working together.

Unknown Speaker  42:37
Sure, let me

Matthias Miller  42:40
just make a note here. Note we calculate performance, we assume equal performance daily basis, so we only look at individual employees contribution.

Speaker 1  43:03
All right, he, he. Stephen had a, I need a George has a question for you, Matt. But Stephen had a building thing where it would, it would divide the credit, like, if we're building 103 guys were building, it would give each guy, if they all worked on it for the same length of time, they would all get credit for 33.33 guys built 100 type of thing. Yep,

Speaker 2  43:35
yep, um, password and silver and reserve. Can you recall what my password was? Matt? Was it generic?

Matthias Miller  43:47
I don't know, but merv's got,

Speaker 1  43:49
Yeah, hold on. I mine's, I think I have it right there.

Matthias Miller  43:59
Or, if not, Murph can reset it too.

Speaker 2  44:03
Yeah, because if I go under the email, I can get in. But if I go to my browser, I have to have, and I don't know what my probably

Unknown Speaker  44:10
back I have to look on my other notes.

Unknown Speaker  44:13
Sorry, fine. I

Matthias Miller  44:53
Hey, I'm.

Speaker 1  45:29
I still don't always write down the passwords, apparently,

Matthias Miller  45:39
so you can you should be able To log in and reset it if you

Unknown Speaker  45:42
need to. Yeah, let me

Speaker 2  45:47
so if I click on the link and it opens up, it's, it's saved right now. I mean, it's already filled in. Well,

Matthias Miller  45:55
I mean, I mean, you just open it up from there. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  46:01
Mine's if I go into Mom,

Unknown Speaker  56:22
I can Matt, if you want to.

Speaker 1  56:30
I mean, I think you know, well, you wanted to go over your those notes that you started reading those notes,

Matthias Miller  56:35
yeah, the biggest question I think I have. I I

Matthias Miller  56:46
don't think I have a lot of questions. At some point I'm going to want to nail down a little bit more specifically how setup time gets calculated, because there were some changes there. We're talking about dividing it out equally across everybody, where setup time would be like it's a 30 minute set of time, and if it's two people, it's 15 minutes, if it's three people, it's 10 minutes.

Unknown Speaker  57:10
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  57:17
and, and then that gets pulled but that still gets pulled off the assembly method, right?

Speaker 1  57:23
Yeah, assembly methods gonna say it's kind of like, can't set up. It's kind of like entering can data. We have to based on the assembly method. There's the default setup time. And then divide that by how many guys are there, which is usually one or two, and then, and then we need to be able to override it. Well, no, we can just do that assembly method and just keep but we'll have to do that in the sort of in the settings,

Matthias Miller  57:59
right, yep, okay, I think, I think, I think I have what I need, yeah. So, yeah, all right, sounds good. How's your week? Had a good week? It's been, it's been a little crazy. I was, I was had a good time Monday to Monday to Wednesday. I was out of town, yeah? So it's always, it's always, it's always good to get that shot in the arm being with other people. Awesome.

Speaker 1  58:24
Hey, do you it's 12 o'clock. I did let you go 10 o'clock. Um, do you want to reach out when we for our next get together? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  58:36
