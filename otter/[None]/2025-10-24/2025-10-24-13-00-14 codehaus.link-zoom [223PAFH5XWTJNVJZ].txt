Unknown Speaker  08:00
Hey, Ma'am, what's up? Bob,

Matthias Miller  08:08
can't hear you. There you go. Try that. How's that

Unknown Speaker  08:12
good deal? All right? Friday afternoon.

Matthias Miller  08:18
Friday afternoon. Um,

Unknown Speaker  08:24
what did we catch up?

Matthias Miller  08:28
So I updated that column for you.

Speaker 1  08:30
Looking good. I like it, yes, helpful. I talked to Rick about that yesterday, too. He's gonna that's a good tool. I asked him to go through those items worse, starting with the worst ones, and just look at some of those good but I mean overall, mean overall we're doing. Let me look at that real quick. I might as well. I

Unknown Speaker  09:18
wait, that's right, yeah, that's right. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  09:30
let's go 2223 um, primary grouping.

Unknown Speaker  09:45
It still takes a while. That's fine. Um,

Speaker 1  09:51
a lumber as a percentage of the price. There's a guy, a salesman, told me that if he has nothing else to go by he. He likes for lumber to be around 60% of the price, or or less sure like lumber to be more than 60% and look at that. I guess we're all right. We're doing all right. Seems like we're doing all right there. So, yep, um, to your question, Matt, I don't know if I did I even respond. I kind of sorry I didn't. I was going to Yeah, that being live Yes, I was gonna say yes, looks good. Um, pricing based on a median quantity over the past year.

Unknown Speaker  10:43
So can

Matthias Miller  10:46
is, is he pricing these out per sales order?

Speaker 1  10:52
You mean each item? No, no, okay, no, the price is unchanged until he changes it. Okay?

Matthias Miller  11:02
So there's a the quantity, then is, like a, like a average order quantity,

Speaker 1  11:10
wow, um, he has some, some built in tiered pricing on order quantities. But, like, I'm not, I'm not clear on how that's being applied.

Matthias Miller  11:26
So, and he has a quantity that he uses as a basis,

Speaker 1  11:35
so that would need to be, yeah, I guess so, like, yeah, like, I think he does for each item, and then some items I saw page XL, XL, but where he has, he has different prices for different quantities. But I have a feeling most so the pricing is done on,

Speaker 1  12:15
oh, there's holes in that, in that part of our game, because yeah, there's a if you look at the analysis report, and you look at, if you look at it on an order, I can't remember, but item by item basis, some of them were not generating the value. And the reason they're on the bottom of this is because there's small order quantities, right? And so we Yeah, so we know we're yeah anyway,

Matthias Miller  12:51
because one of the things you could do, if you wanted to, is you could take his pricing model and run it on actual orders to see what we believe the actual value is, and then compare, compare that against the baseline quantity that we're using to find out over a year's period. What's yeah over a year's period? How? How close are we in line?

Unknown Speaker  13:19
So sorry, I have to have to catch up with you.

Unknown Speaker  13:24
Um, comparing. What are we comparing again?

Matthias Miller  13:30
If we would, okay, we could take his price for his pricing model, yeah, and run it, run it against invoices, and I have a few questions on that, but we could run it against an invoice and find out what based on the invoice, if every single order would have come In like this invoice, what would we have charged?

Unknown Speaker  14:05
In other words,

Speaker 1  14:08
what are the when you if it's each specific, if, what is the variation that we're comparing the well,

Matthias Miller  14:17
the water, I mean, ultimately, the Okay, well, it depends. It depends where you want to look at it. You could look at it the variation from the pricing standpoint, from the total order, just from the order pricing. If you wanted to take two steps back, you could, you could the two things that feed into that are, what is the what is the actual quantity ordered. And then also, what is the typical delivery like? Because it looks to me like there's a, am I right? That there's a per delivery, that the per deliver, that the delivery is charged on a per delivery basis. Yes. And so if somebody orders lots of little quality quantities, puts them all in an order, or even, even, it looks like a lot of quantities, but they're doing a lot of deliveries, that's going to that can impact at least to some degree. It's probably it's, I don't know how much ends up being, but that is another factor. So so the only so one way to stabilize that is say, because we can say this pricing structure, if we wanted to go truly variable, we could have this pricing structure be applied to every single invoice and say, let's look at the actual quantity on the invoice. Let's split the delivery fees across the items based on their monetary value, and let's figure out what we would have priced that as. And you can sum that up across the entire year, and then divide it by back out, which will standardize the patterns of delivery and the patterns, the quantity patterns, to to yeah,

Speaker 2  16:08
basically a deep dive analysis of the pricing, Right or results, or Yeah, would be super interesting. My I was thinking of a couple things. Another, another nuance is setup costs, right? Because that's in there, right? It is in there, yeah, right. And so that's that's applied. It's spread out way more on truckload orders.

Speaker 1  16:45
Yeah, then some of the other ones. And then I I think that, I think where we miss it at times is not applying that setup cost on an order of one or an order of two or three, or whatever, like I'm not, I don't think we're applying that accurately in every in every situation. Another thing we're not doing enough of is expedited delivery fee. Like two, day three, day four, day five, day whatever it is. I mean, six days, if we can do it great, but if they need it quicker, I don't know there has to be. There has to be something. There should and it's not built in at this point anyway. That's another conversation, but, but what? What you're talking about? Matt? Are you suggesting, maybe not naughty? How long that would take? Are you suggesting doing that prior to you coming? Or what are your thoughts?

Matthias Miller  17:53
Well, it depends how much. I mean, there's a possibility that I could. I mean, we are, we're down to the wire. So I'm not promises,

Speaker 1  18:07
I'm not suggesting it. I'm just asking

Matthias Miller  18:10
No, and I don't think it's a lot of mean, I personally don't, well actually, no, I don't think I am. I think I think there are, I do have some questions around the pricing, and I haven't really gotten to dig into it too deeply, actually, maybe, maybe all this stuff is in here.

Speaker 1  18:36
Well, I wonder if we should discuss that a little bit further, because I right. Typically, his, his method is typically a little different than what mine would be, yeah, um, yeah. So I wonder what you're wondering, what your if we would discuss, if we would talk, just talk through that real quickly, like Wonder what, where we would land, where you and I would land with it?

Matthias Miller  19:10
Well, there's so many. I mean,

Matthias Miller  19:17
I don't know how deep the rabbit hole you want to go. I mean, so

Speaker 2  19:21
the let's okay, I guess the thing is, first off, I mean, he's,

Speaker 1  19:29
there's a lot of times where I'll ask questions on price and stuff like that. And, you know, it's usually, like, the last couple years, I think he's been pretty well on top of things like overall, I do, I want to, I want to say that, so I'm not, I'm not trying to. I don't know. I don't know. But again, same time, we have the ability, and we should have the ability, to. Look at it, to analyze it. I think we should.

Matthias Miller  20:04
Yeah, well, I mean, there's, there's all kinds of stuff. Well, in this stuff, he's probably thought through. I have no reason to doubt that he has. But how do you come up with pricing on the Vikings? How does that get calculated? And again, at some point it's just going to feel like he's these, these questions for somebody who doesn't understand can end up, from his perspective, just being insulting to try to re explain everything all over again.

Speaker 1  20:32
Yeah. But what does he have in there for machine versus hand? He has two different factors, right?

Matthias Miller  20:39
Yeah. So machine ranges from its quantity times 25 cents. It's 25 cents each on the A, it's 28 on the B. Hand is,

Matthias Miller  21:00
hand is the what is that? T3 it's the hand set up time divided by the quantity, plus point eight plus the number of fan fasteners times half a percent or half a cent. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  21:24
yeah, it sounds a little. I mean, it sounds a little. How would you say?

Speaker 1  21:40
Doesn't sound nice and square and level and all that.

Matthias Miller  21:46
Well, the overhead, then, is based on B pricing.

Unknown Speaker  21:54
B pricing,

Matthias Miller  21:57
yeah, so if the B is,

Unknown Speaker  22:02
oh, for machine. Well, I don't, can I see? Can I see?

Matthias Miller  22:08
Yeah, yeah. Let me size this down, just a hair to make it a little easier. Okay, so board feet, we just have lumber, is times 58 that was one question I did have. Did you see that is, is 58 the

Unknown Speaker  22:29
Sure? Well, no. So, yeah. So like

Speaker 1  22:33
the palette profile publication, weekly publication, used by a lot of people, it's the number one, the price indexing reference for people in the palette world, and so their current lumber, their current number is point five, eight. We're buying lumber for less than that, so he's price. He's using that for his pricing, which is, I think is good if we can buy it for 55 or 52 or whatever, we're going to do that, but sure, it's always higher, sometimes more than, sometimes higher than others.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
Okay. But was your question around,

Speaker 1  23:27
when you, when we, well, sorry, when we talk about assembly tracker, that's, that's a percentage. What percentage is the it's the cost percentage of the price correct. But what we're not what we're not catching there, Matt, is we're not catching the salt curve and we're not catching waste. So I just did a look at board feet of lumber we used in the last 445, days, because I want to see an average. And it was, yeah, anyway, that's about what I thought. But I ended up adding because in the system, in the items we are, the number that's calculated is straight lumber for pricing. We need to add curve to it, right salt curve, which is about point 09 it's all but 1% it's all but 10% it's 9% and another factor is waste. When we buy lumber, there's a waste factor in power lumber, and that's 10% so realistically, the lumber, that actual lumber in an item, we should add 9% and then add 10% realistically, or add 10 then add nine,

Matthias Miller  24:56
right? Because your curve, technically is after the weight. Waste

Speaker 1  25:00
curve plus what? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, no, waste gets run through before it's curve comes off before waste. So we trying to think, yeah, we added, added

Matthias Miller  25:19
finish plus 9% because the curve comes up first.

Speaker 1  25:23
Add 10% because that's the waste that we threw out, and it's actually higher maybe 11 but and then add 9% on top of that. Yeah, that's actual lumber cost.

Unknown Speaker  25:40
So when you talk about pricing,

Unknown Speaker  25:47
if we go by the index,

Unknown Speaker  25:52
if we go by the index,

Speaker 1  25:56
that's fine, but then then the like we did, the item data as it stands, does not include kerf. So if we use the item data ever as a price for pricing, we're going to have to add waste and add kerf.

Matthias Miller  26:12
Well, what would make the most sense is that track two, two board feet. One would be the finished or the the raw material, board feet and the yield board feet, right?

Unknown Speaker  26:24
Yes, sir, yes, sir, that's right.

Speaker 1  26:29
And that and that, when I say 9% curve Matt, that does vary. Like, Sure, yep, larger pieces less, less curve loss. Of course, sometimes it depends on we have a we have numbers for all of it, like, I could give you the like. In other words, we're going to take it out of a three and a half by eight, or out of three and a half by six. Well, there's only so many you can get out of a six of each size. There's only somebody can get out of an eight. And so we have that number divided perfectly. So that's the actual price. That's the way we actually price it, but that's what Rick prices it,

Matthias Miller  27:12
if we would have but see on the raw material, we're not specifying the literal well, except coming out of cans. But we're not right? Yeah, we don't. We don't put in actual dimensions. We're just putting in text on what it is, right?

Speaker 1  27:30
But that's another but we should add, I mean, we don't need it right now, but right any kind of pricing that we're going to do, or school, well, not scoring, yeah, pricing. It needs to be there,

Matthias Miller  27:50
by the way, if you wanted to one of the things, one of the places we've had people come to us, most commonly for is just on the quoting side, yeah? Because if you wanted to, you could literally have a quote calculator that somebody comes in and says, we want this much of this much and like, here's the price. And you know, if you want to higher quantity, then here's what you get here. But maybe customers don't buy like that either. Yeah?

Speaker 2  28:20
They, well, yeah, well, that's part of our quoting process.

Speaker 1  28:26
And I would love, I would love, we have a system. I mean, Tina does it, and then Rick, Rick does his. So it's like a double check. And they kind of usually. They usually decide together. I think so that's good.

Unknown Speaker  28:49
They do quotes. I mean,

Speaker 1  28:52
if Yeah, I don't know how to say, I don't know what else to say, other than I know the future is.

Speaker 2  28:59
The future for us is this program, right?

Speaker 1  29:06
You know, and what do you matter your thoughts, but Excuse me, but as long as Rick is doing this, the job that he's doing,

Unknown Speaker  29:21
um, think it's, what do you think? I mean, I think it's good to honor, I don't know, yeah, like, I don't think it's broken, right, right?

Speaker 1  29:38
Yeah, it's not broken, for sure, but you know, there are there, if there's things that we can catch with this program, especially with all of the with the reporting man, that is awesome. Yep, I'm sure there'll be more like this. Lumber. Our cost as a percentage of price. Man, that's a great, that's a great tool. When Rick's like, I've said, I've asked Rick to look at those. Now, when I looked, last time I looked at it, that that column wasn't there yet. So, so Yeah, he'll, I'm pretty sure he'll be, he'll be able to, he'll be doing that so, so, and

Matthias Miller  30:23
that's and that's what we want. We want to we want to give him tools to get information that he couldn't get any other ways he can need so you can succeed at what he's doing 100% Absolutely. Matt, yeah, go ahead. So. BT, 13, he treated

Matthias Miller  30:46
so this one is, feel like here I'm getting

Matthias Miller  31:00
some of these numbers, I'm a little confused about how they correlate, because on the on the BT 13, I'm seeing 90 fasteners, yeah.

Speaker 1  31:12
Wait, were you, oh, man, yeah. I'm not sure that's his number.

Matthias Miller  31:21
And so some of this could be good to kind of reconcile and cross reference and see where the discrepancy is coming from. BT 13 as well. We're showing a higher board fitted footage, which there could have been adjustments to to it since the last time he got it.

Unknown Speaker  31:45
BT Third, there could have been

Unknown Speaker  31:49
but if it's in here, I want to last ordered.

Speaker 1  31:54
Was that 40? Excuse me, 42 that's not a frequent order. Were

Matthias Miller  32:10
mostly not clear. So how come the

Matthias Miller  32:18
oh, that's he's just one off saying, what the, what the assembly method is,

Unknown Speaker  32:27
what? Where are you at?

Matthias Miller  32:29
Like, he's putting in the formula, like here, yeah, yeah. He's putting in the formula where the assembly method is. So this one's hand, again, this one, this one here, is calculated. And, like I said, it might be an old one, but this one's being calculated.

Speaker 2  32:46
Does that say sample palette? No, it's not sampled.

Matthias Miller  32:51
It's but it's it's put in here as a, as a, as a, b, and it's calculated here as a, as a, well with hand delivery,

Unknown Speaker  33:04
well as a hand Uh huh,

Matthias Miller  33:09
and the overhead, but the overhead is being pulled off the B, not off of that the and maybe That's what it's supposed to

Unknown Speaker  33:19
be, all 504, B,

Speaker 1  33:22
yeah, right. But what about the hand did you say?

Matthias Miller  33:27
Okay, I mean, so there's a discrepancy between this thing is calculating the hand price. It's the it's the lumber plus nail plus hand price, yeah, and here it's, it's in here as a, as a Viking, yeah,

Speaker 1  33:43
no hand fasteners. And I don't know that's possibly, was that bt 13? If we look at that, I'm gonna look at the look at that real quick, see if it might be small orders. And if it's that's the case, they may just assemble by hand, if it's like five or 10 or something. Let me see quick here. That's not what I'm looking for.

Speaker 2  34:22
Into 13. Ht,

Speaker 1  34:31
continue, okay, so 60 in the last year and a half, and that's probably why. Because, sure, yep. And I don't know unless he just, I don't know unless he just pick something out and add a little value in there. I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  34:52
Okay, so the BT 16, that's the, that's the, that's the one that's i.

Unknown Speaker  35:04
On, did I just here we go?

Speaker 1  35:09
BT 16, yeah, that's a lot of those. What do you got there?

Matthias Miller  35:16
So my board foot is, so if we do 12.14890 times 1.1 times 1.09 14.5 so he's still showing a higher board footage.

Speaker 1  35:32
Well, that's because he's has the curve in there. But even

Matthias Miller  35:36
with the curve, if I'm taking this and adding 10% 9% I'm still coming.

Unknown Speaker  35:44
Wait, oh, 12,

Matthias Miller  35:46
I'm coming up with 14 and a half closer to 14.6

Speaker 1  35:50
because the 44 and 1/8 is counted as 48 inches. That's another factor. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  36:07
for pricing,

Matthias Miller  36:08
got it, yep, okay, so,

Speaker 1  36:18
yeah, curve, it's also, I mean, for pricing, it's also length, you know, we add, we add it up to round it up to the next, the next thing that we can take out of a four footer, a six footer, or an Eight footer, or, you know, whatever. So if it's 37 inches, we're going to call 40. We get three out of a 10 footer, and then some. We do a lot of combo cuts. So we do combo cuts when we can. Dad is always big on combo cuts, trying to, you know, instead of cutting 330 sevens, we'll cut 230 sevens and a 46 and kick 46 off the floor and then run that through later, which is, you know, stuff like that, try to try to make a couple extra pennies somehow. Yep, kind of hard, like hard work to be profitable, if that's your profit. But if it's, if it's systematic and it and it adds profit, then, yeah, right, yep. And that's with cutbacks. I'm trying to improve our system there, because we do have, like I said, that 10% waste factor. So we have to cut extra number one and number two, but the cut actually do the job. Number two, we have stuff left over at the end of the job that has bad spots in it, and some of that material can be cut back to a usable length, but it has to be paid for already. So now we have free material. But then if we use, if we have a guy standing at a pop up saw cutting one or two pieces at a time and analyzing it and flipping it over manually and all that. And then he cuts a piece, then he stacks it, well, that's one thing that's tedious. Then we have 100 different sizes to now we have to have a pile for 100 different sizes of cutbacks. It's, it becomes very clunky and space eating process. I'm, I'm talking to an outfit. Well, I'm talking this multiple people, but looking at a scanning scanner where we can run this stuff through. It scans the material and also scans the length. It figures out where the bad spots are. And then you give it a recipe of sizes that you want it to yield, and it will optimize, give you the best yield and cut out the bad spots. Kicks it out the other end, and this suckers twice as fast as probably more, oh my gosh, probably, I mean, goodness, they probably, like, five to 10 times faster than a guy standing there like we're doing it

Matthias Miller  39:15
now, wow,

Speaker 1  39:17
oh man, bro, I'm pumped. And then I'm going to put a band saw. We're going to put a band saw right on the back side of that thing, because before taking inch and a 16th cutbacks, now I can run it instead of stacking it, and then take it to the bandsaw. We're going to run straight through the bandsaw. I'll get two seven sixteenths or two half inch out of it, right off the right away, and then that's done. So it's going to be like a mini gangs all for cutbacks and leftovers,

Unknown Speaker  39:46
but it's lost a little bit, so gotta

Matthias Miller  39:48
figure that won't be cheap. No, you know, couple

Speaker 2  39:51
100,000 at least. Yeah, anyway. BT, wow.

Matthias Miller  40:06
I mean, bottom line, though, is, isn't the bottom line that this, this? I mean, we really are missing a bunch of critical like, if we really wanted to replicate this pricing accurately, like, just each piece, how to get accurate board footage, right?

Unknown Speaker  40:24
Well, go ahead, sorry, well

Matthias Miller  40:27
and even, but this is, this is another reason why, even on the assembly method, if we could run a value, an assembly value, and a per assembly method to do hand pricing based on, you know, to calculate the assembly value based on the actual method by which it was assembled. So that's,

Speaker 1  40:49
well, when you say method like you're saying,

Speaker 2  40:56
I mean, we could simply say time it's taken historically, or are you thinking of more elaborate

Unknown Speaker  41:06
factors data?

Matthias Miller  41:08
Well, I'm saying currently the item has an assembly method on it. Yeah. But for the sake of phrasing, don't you want to know how often is it assembled manually, and how often is it is it assembled

Unknown Speaker  41:22
on yeah,

Speaker 1  41:23
there's not very many. There's not very many that are either many of those, not many, not many. But again, the way I wanted to do score calculator with Steven. It was a couple years ago, and we just, I mean, we looked at it, we looked at it, and we never really landed, because first thing he did was build a price cost calculator. And so I was entering the times that the guys took in sawing. I was entering the lumber with the curve and the waste factor, and then I was adding up the assembly time, and the nails and or the other fasteners and, like, just kind of try to look at all those fasters, but I didn't. Then I had to do an overhead thing, so I put an overhead percentage, and it was, you know, it was my first ever but, and then we looked at all the New Holland stuff, and me, it was way off. It was just we had to cross the board. We ended up average 25% increase. And some of their stuff is still not because we some of the things look like they should have had 100% increase. Some of the stuff 10 to 20% increase. And we didn't do 100 on anything, and so we're still that. We're still on that that was three years ago. So then, when you talk score calculator, like, if we would figure out all the data points, we could come up with a great piece rate for the guys out there. And we could also come up with a great pricing quoting. It could all be done in one, one module, yeah, so, so then the points that I had, I don't know how many I had, 678, and Stephen basically alluded that, you know, the less data points, the easier, which makes sense. So board feet of material. Excuse me, Matt, I'm gonna take this quick. I'm not sure. Hey, I'm on the phone with Matt. Is there something important.

Speaker 2  43:54
The eighth, seventh and eighth? Yeah, I don't know. Okay, I'll talk to you later, but maybe okay, sorry, um, board feet, because, board feet because there's a baked in cost there. Yeah.

Speaker 1  44:16
Score Cal, okay, for what's the difficulty for the guys on the floor. I mean, if we're cutting a seven, we're cutting a 73 inch piece out of a 96 we're going to price it 96 but the difficulty is only 73 inches. So there's two different there's two different things there. But again, right, the board footage gives you the volume of material so volume of material is a difficulty factor. Then you look at P

Unknown Speaker  44:51
was, what did I call? What do we call it?

Speaker 1  44:55
Good grief, parts, parts. How many different. Sizes of material does it take to make that item? You know, some things, it's got a runners, and it's got boards, and that's it, one size runners, one size boards. Some of these things are like 10 to 15 different parts. So that's a factor. It's different sizes, and it's different piles at the setup, and all of that. Then the next one was, was the fasteners, which alludes to the assembly method, right? So if you're doing machine nails, that's one thing, but if you're doing hand nails that are short, hand nails that are long, that's where we had that tiered assembly Assem. It was fasteners and that, and that's tiered. That's very much tiered. So I felt like, if we got that, if we did that fastener and scored those fasteners correctly, maybe you can just use the price of the fastener, I don't know, as a as a good data point, yep, um, and if you just had those three different factors right there, maybe there's another one or so that are there that We could, you know, like, um,

Unknown Speaker  46:22
yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 1  46:24
I feel like you could come up with a really good handle for scoring for the guys on the floor.

Matthias Miller  46:35
And that does bring me back to what we talked about. We had to actually talk about running a model and seeing if there's a you is a see if we could take the data that we have and just try to, that's right, find something that correlates on well. But how do we though? Because, and I guess my point was, what part of this, and this is where it broke down, what part of this determines. We don't have any objective measure to compare difficulty to, except time spent in the assembly tracker. So

Speaker 2  47:27
Right? Um, exactly,

Speaker 1  47:40
I mean, I mean, at some point you have to go back and look at historical, not

Matthias Miller  47:46
right, but you have to, you have to isolate based on who's doing the work, like you have to, ideally you would, you would be able to say when, okay, when these guys do this item, it's this, but when the same guys do that item, it's that. That's an objective comparison, right? Or when this person does this and that person does that, this is the difference. And so we need to adjust accordingly, based off of that. I mean, right, that's where

Speaker 2  48:29
so we, I mean, we could, we could look at it with the fasteners, if we had a report. Mean, it's more reports, but how much time is spent?

Speaker 1  48:51
Well, there's combinations, but we could just go by time in the tracker spent for each fastener. I mean, that will be a starting point.

Matthias Miller  49:09
Well, it's by, wouldn't it be by cost of fastener?

Speaker 1  49:19
I mean, the price, price is one thing, but I guess I'm saying historically, how long does it take to install a machine nail? How long does it take to install a Hand Nail? How long does it take to install a carriage ball?

Unknown Speaker  49:39
I'm not sure if I think you're gonna have to

Speaker 1  49:44
add some you're probably gonna have to do some programming to do that. But

Matthias Miller  49:54
what would you you would take you. Total time of the project, and just divvy it up based on, yep, based on the fastener, assuming, based

Speaker 2  50:07
on fastener cost, right, which could be cost, right, right, right.

Speaker 1  50:14
And some, and a lot of a lot of the items is one fastener only, and then there's some that are, that are moldable ones. So, I mean, we could just do it that way. And then, I mean, obviously we'd have to forget about guys, and we couldn't be that objective. We'd have to be that'd be a starting point. And then over time we would, over time, we could look at

Speaker 2  50:49
actual yield, actual production versus

Unknown Speaker  50:56
invoicing, right?

Unknown Speaker  51:02
I mean, once we had that, we could

Speaker 1  51:06
be a good starting point to to assign a score, assign a value to an item, but then we could allow, we could, if we would look at,

Unknown Speaker  51:20
if we would look at, well,

Speaker 1  51:24
because there's we're not, we'd have to add sewing in the into the equation, which we can do.

Matthias Miller  51:38
That's where, what I was hoping to get to with this was if we could take out the delivery,

Unknown Speaker  51:45
yeah,

Matthias Miller  51:47
and if, okay, if we have a price calculator in silver loom that says this is how we get to the price, then now we can work backwards and say, what is the, what is the assembly portion of the price, and then we can start comparing hours to that assembly portion. So you're only looking at one thin slice of of the pie, but you're comparing apples to apples, and you're not getting penalized from that standpoint on deliveries and other stuff.

Speaker 1  52:19
Yeah, I got that makes sense. Okay? I think so, yep.

Matthias Miller  52:23
And in my mind, then you start saying, then you start saying, how do the parts? Well, you can actually start, you could start right now to saying, what do you see? What do these simple pricing factors that you were talking about? How do they correlate to the hours spent on an item? Right? And that

Matthias Miller  53:00
would give you, like, a median or something, and then you can figure out, look at the items that take less than that or more than that, and find out if it's

Unknown Speaker  53:07
right, yeah.

Speaker 1  53:10
And that's which, which Rick is thinking about that. I mean, he was, I mean, he mentioned that, like when we ran the report to see about dollars generated per hour. He's like, Well, what do you think it should be? What is the goal? Right? You know, because the range was 1200 to down to single, down to under 100 Yeah. And to that point, I mean, we were talking about, okay, well, let's look at all the hands. So then we did that, and we looked at the average we got. We calculated the average. It was like three something. And then on machine, the average was like five something. I mean, 300 something, and 500 something. Yep, we were looking at that. And so I guess to that point

Speaker 2  54:05
I'm, I don't, I think Rick would appreciate having more tools like that at his disposal. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:23
I mean he's yeah anyway, I

Matthias Miller  54:45
am I think okay, and I know in the past, you haven't thought that there's enough percentage variation between raw material and some of these other costs that you can't just use total cost. I think if I'm. Remembering right?

Speaker 2  55:03
There's, can you say that again? Yeah, that

Matthias Miller  55:09
I mean that percentage wise, the percentage factor of raw material, of lumber versus labor, is similar enough that you don't have to discount or you don't have to exclude lumber in your in your scoring,

Speaker 2  55:36
not tracking, quite percentage factor.

Matthias Miller  55:42
So your lumber, your lumber, correlates with the more lumber, the more labor, the less lumber, the less labor, the less labor, the less lumber, the more labor, the more more lumber. Yeah, is that a true? True? That's it. So from that standpoint, go ahead,

Speaker 1  56:03
typically, I mean there, there are variables to that. I mean, you know, some things are just more lumber. And I mean, there it does there it's a it, it varies. It does vary

Speaker 2  56:16
because larger members with less fasteners, you know, mean, right? Smaller members, more fasteners. It does vary.

Speaker 1  56:31
That's, but that's amount of amount of fasteners. Catches that, right? But it's but again, are you? Are you? Are you thinking that if we somehow excluded lumber, or excluded the other stuff, we could where you at?

Matthias Miller  56:50
Okay, this is I'm just telling you how my brain thinks. And maybe my brain thinks about it wrong, but here's how it thinks about it. When you're building the pricing, you start with the lumber. Yeah, yeah. All right. Getting that price right has nothing to do with any with with difficulty, or anything else like that's just hard cost. Then then you do have to account for sawing in some capacity, which we haven't discussed in any way, which is its own thing. And then there's assembly. And in my mind, if you have, if you build your pricing where it's based off of, it's based off of raw material, sawing labor, sawing labor and assembly labor, yep. And then you add on delivery and overhead and heat treating, yep. Then, now, if you have, if you can calculate forward, you can also calculate backwards. So in your assembly tracker, you're only willing to look at this tiny little slice and comparing it with the hours and see how accurate that part, just that part of the price, is against that. And then once we get sewing tracking, you compare that. And then at the point that we need to reconcile lumber price, it's like, I mean, that's probably more like, let's take a look at actual lumber usage on a monthly basis, and compare and contrast with what we actually, you know, how does that where we at on that number? Something more like that? That to me, I don't know how to wrap my head around it, to get a confident, to get confidence around the numbers that we're generating without building a pricing model that works like that. Sure.

Speaker 2  58:28
No, I've, I've, I mean, right, I get it. So, so, so we build that.

Speaker 1  58:40
I mean, we should build that, right? Let's build it and then, and then we have multiple comparisons that Rick is going to be able to look into. And the reason for looking at those is to react, make adjustments when needed.

Matthias Miller  59:01
That is, that is correct,

Speaker 1  59:03
or are you proposing a more elaborate reaction?

Matthias Miller  59:11
Well, I mean, okay, there's, I don't know how you handle the Okay, it's a it's a dance. Because on one hand, some of the guys just need to work faster,

Speaker 1  59:30
right in some, in some Yes, some, in some cases yes,

Matthias Miller  59:35
and, and in other cases, we grossly, we just came up with the price and we, we just, we didn't think about how hard it was going to be or something, you know, whatever, or times change,

Speaker 1  59:48
but Matt, we can catch it. Okay. Look, we only have so many different souls out here. Okay. I mean, yeah, and we only have so many different methods. I mean, I. You look at the fasteners, there's still not, I mean, there's like, six. I mean, it's a machine nail, it's a hand nail, and it's the hand some of my hand nails are bigger than others, so I split that into two, and then it's screws, then it's lags, then it's carriage bolts, then it's like, hinges, or like, right? We got all that. So we, you know, we have all that. And then within each of those factors, there's a, I mean, there's an expected, there's an expected time that it takes, and that's what it is, right? Whether they hit it or not. All right, dude, we can. I mean, we can. I like, where we're going. I want to, I want to finish this thing, like, everything we just talked about, not, not repeated. But I'm saying, like, yes, let's I want to go down this. I want to get through this. If you want to, um, let's do it.

Matthias Miller  1:01:05
Hey, I'm game. I'm I'm up for, I'm up for the adventure.

Speaker 1  1:01:10
All right, let's go, yes, yeah. So what you said is exactly when you said lumber and

Matthias Miller  1:01:22
yes, so there's this, yep, the fasteners are so then the real question is, actually, I like that idea. Do we have any way? Dude? Hang on. Do we have any way just to cross reference payroll and or assembly?

Matthias Miller  1:01:56
How would this be? Could we use the existing data that we have to find the time spent per fastener?

Speaker 1  1:02:06
That's what. That's what you're after saying yes, and, and, and, and. I mean, what? Why not? I mean, you have the faster information. It's a different report.

Matthias Miller  1:02:24
Well, it could be on the if we would do and it would be based on faster costs, right?

Speaker 1  1:02:32
Look at, look at each item. You're gonna It's item by item.

Matthias Miller  1:02:38
But if we would do something like, Okay, we're gonna do this as the we're gonna have to call this guy something simply analysis,

Speaker 2  1:02:52
No, it's, it's, it's fastener, it's fastener difficulty, or,

Matthias Miller  1:03:04
well, I'm thinking here, check this fastener.

Speaker 1  1:03:07
Fastener labor, value labor, factor labor, something,

Matthias Miller  1:03:12
it's check this out. Check this out.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
Man, Texas got back like here, yep, yep, very good.

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
So here we have,

Matthias Miller  1:03:45
go yank this guy, just for fun, for now, okay, and then we do,

Matthias Miller  1:03:59
so then we do for each of these. For each item we want to Do, item field,

Matthias Miller  1:04:11
RG, i

Unknown Speaker  1:04:32
times

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
do his thumb.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:05
Our storage faster. Is that?

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
Why? I

Matthias Miller  1:05:27
Oh, because I'm on the just on this customer, and then we want a

Matthias Miller  1:05:44
here, let's do this. Let's make this. This a little faster.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:01
Matt, do I have a minute

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
or Yeah, yeah, you got a minute? I'm throwing some stuff together here, something quick here, yep, sweet man. I to do it

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
before it's ports. That's what's stop and grab it. But super.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
Take out.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
Yes, 717-305-0304,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
yeah, somebody else to pick it up.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:04
Um, one cheese steak, shamboli, uh, large, yeah, and I want to pay that with the credit card. Oh, really, well, how much is it?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:30
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 1  1:12:33
And he How soon will that like? He's going to be there in about 2530, minutes.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:42
Okay? Sounds good. Thank you. I love

Speaker 1  1:13:02
Yeah, hey, MERV, again, I ordered two quarts of the cream and potato soup.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:08
I need to, I like to pay that with a credit card, if I can.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:22
Well, actually, what is that? What is the cost?

Speaker 1  1:13:38
Very good. Thank you. Thank you. And when is that ready? When will that be ready?

Speaker 2  1:13:48
Okay, okay, so they'll be there at four between 430 and four or five. Yep, 31 okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
Hey, I'm here if you need me, Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:16:01
Hey, check this out. So I prayer alright. So if we take for each item, we figure out how much does, how much does each of any particular here? Let me, let me, let me just run this. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:35
should just do a narrow time frame so it's faster. But anyway, okay, so if a Hand Nail costs X cents, and the total fasteners on the item counts accounts for this much.

Speaker 2  1:16:51
If the Hand Nail cost, what was the word? If you take, well,

Matthias Miller  1:16:56
let's, let's pick out an item so we have something specific. So like, if a if this Hand Nail costs low and salt 1.2 cents, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:17:09
too big. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:17:13
okay, and the total cost of all fasteners is 4.33 so we take the point 012, divided by this, then it means that point 2% point 3% of the time is going into each in an intra single hand nail, right?

Speaker 1  1:17:33
Yes, sure. Well, the longer ones are going to take more time.

Matthias Miller  1:17:40
The value is higher. I mean, but the cost is

Speaker 1  1:17:42
higher. Yeah, are you factoring the cost? Yes. We take the cost of as a percentage, yes, the

Matthias Miller  1:17:48
cost of each Yep, of the as a percentage of the total cost per above all of them,

Speaker 1  1:17:55
and as a percentage of the of the of the time spent.

Matthias Miller  1:17:59
And then we times it right by the right? And this isn't, this is the this actually, this total isn't quite right, though, so we have so this is the

Unknown Speaker  1:18:18
total isn't quite

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
the percentage based on the time spent. That's per item. But I need a this. This is not right on a group basis. So on a group basis, this needs To be I

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
need to know what the

Matthias Miller  1:19:03
A we need a weighted average, which means that we need this thumb

Matthias Miller  1:19:16
cost of fastener items. Ah, well, we have that here. We have no that's just the count.

Speaker 2  1:20:13
It, yeah, you like those?

Speaker 2  1:20:30
To be nothing, you know, I Feel

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
I'll be Right theory back, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:12
Gabriel, okay, so?

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
So This is the so this gives us the dollar value

Matthias Miller  1:22:49
of each fastener assembled. This is the total fastener assembled. And so then here, I'm just going to put this here for now and Then we have so then we Can.

Matthias Miller  1:23:12
This would be

Matthias Miller  1:23:30
call I two times. What was the total assembly hours?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:27
Total.

Matthias Miller  1:24:39
Here, let's I'm going to do this.

Matthias Miller  1:25:10
Okay, so total fasteners. This is the total we've spent on fasteners. If you take the is this here, let's fix some of these columns yet, two decimals, that's four. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  1:25:47
Okay, so let me double check my numbers.

Matthias Miller  1:25:57
Cost is total cost per item.

Matthias Miller  1:26:05
We need the

Matthias Miller  1:26:12
total cost and then the contribution, and then here,

Matthias Miller  1:26:23
this is the,

Matthias Miller  1:26:31
So, here's the Yep, and then here, theoretically, once again, individual, okay, cross your fingers. Let's see what this says. So theoretically, here's the total fastener cost for these orders in the period.

Speaker 1  1:26:57
Shrink this down, okay, total fastener cost, yes,

Matthias Miller  1:27:02
oops, this guy, here's the Hand Nail cost, and then here's the time.

Speaker 1  1:27:09
Um, Matt, one thing here I noticed in assembly tracker, never mind as a Bonnie trail, never mind it was totaling fasteners all time, instead of anyway, which is fine, no problem. Never mind what I'm saying, total total fastener costs per item.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:33
Wait, that's per mobile items, right? Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:27:38
this is broken down by item right now, yeah, but if we, but then if we wanted to, if you want to go down to the end, the end, theoretically, is where it gets interesting. So we think that this should not be a sum and nail, 75 out of no but it might be okay. So we said we had $75,000 worth of fasteners, four, three, 1.62 divided by of hand. Nails divided by 21528841, which is point three, five, so a little over a third times the total hours assembly time is third, 13, 883, 4864, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:28:38
that's, yeah, That's so you're saying you're taking a total fastener value, and you're breaking out that value as a PERS by the percentage of cost for each fastener, right? You too, see it.

Matthias Miller  1:28:56
This is not per each This is, what is it? Okay? I think so this is, this is how much? What was the cost of all hand nails? I may not,

Speaker 1  1:29:11
can you? Can you figure that out with the tracker?

Matthias Miller  1:29:18
Well, so what we're doing here, let me show some detail, and we can, we can drill in and

Matthias Miller  1:29:32
let's do it. Let's do it even narrower window. Let's just do June, just to make it faster. Okay, so come on.

Matthias Miller  1:29:49
So here we have, let's go down to a Hand Nail. Okay. So here we have the AHF six. If we go back here.

Matthias Miller  1:30:11
So here, the total cost is about $1 the faster cost. That's the

Speaker 1  1:30:20
machine, though. I mean, those guys are running a machine. Why that's a hand station? Says Hand Nail. That's not something's not right? Doesn't take three guys to run a hand station. And those three guys are all running, we're running the machine together. Maybe that's another one of those words, gosh, hand, sometimes a machine, another whatever, probably only done a couple times. It's not a great

Matthias Miller  1:30:58
example, but here everything's hand hand nails, which means that, theoretically, it takes Hand Nail, okay, but this number isn't right. We're looking at hours. We want hours per nail, right? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:25
That would based on the value,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:30
based on the percentage

Unknown Speaker  1:31:34
of overall value that each nail is.

Matthias Miller  1:31:40
So we just want to take, we want to take this number divided by an individual,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:50
which number, sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:31:53
the total Hand Nail caught. Okay. Why is this so hard? Is it just a Friday afternoon?

Speaker 1  1:32:00
Which one is a total hand, no cost in that graph, I don't, I can't see

Matthias Miller  1:32:04
this, this guy right here, the 120 or the one, 120

Speaker 1  1:32:08
Yeah, okay, over for that job, $120 total cost.

Matthias Miller  1:32:18
And so you want to know what percentage of the time was to all hand nails, and then what percentage of time was for this hand nails. So we need to know how many, what the number of hand nails are as well, right? So

Speaker 1  1:32:50
but Matt like, I don't know if you're doing it or not, but if you take one item and you look at the over, the overall cost of the fasteners, and divide it by the amount of fasteners. Then, then you have the percentage of the time that each fastener should be allotted,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:23
right? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:31
And then, if it's

Speaker 1  1:33:34
different, multiple different fasteners, it has to be skilled by the value and divide it as well.

Matthias Miller  1:33:45
Take the cost of one fastener divided by the cost of all the fasteners times the assembly hours. It's that simple.

Speaker 1  1:33:54
That's it. Yeah, boom. I'm not a mathematician. I like numbers. I didn't take algebra and the Amish, but some people did. How's that algebra treating you? Man, happy.

Speaker 1  1:34:24
To, yeah, Matt, they're leaving. Guys are leaving. Here. We had a left production. We shut down 12, limiting the orders, but man, the guys walked out with 7% bonus today. So that was cool, dude. I've seen, yeah, there's been, I, I'm sensing more engagement on the floor, like it there's a, it's like, there's a tangible, it's something, man, there's an energy. Man, something something. There's something tangible in the air. So, like, that's Anyway, okay, got it formula solved?

Matthias Miller  1:35:01
Okay, so here's the Say

Unknown Speaker  1:35:04
that again. I want to write that down. It's the the

Matthias Miller  1:35:10
single faster cost. Single, yep, single faster dollars divided by total faster dollars times

Speaker 1  1:35:19
dollars divided by the total fastener dollars, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:35:30
times the hours,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:33
times labor hours, labor hours equals

Matthias Miller  1:35:43
hours equals the the

Unknown Speaker  1:35:47
diff. What are we calling it?

Matthias Miller  1:35:50
Well, it's the hours per I mean, this is the hours per fastener.

Speaker 1  1:35:56
Equals hours per specific fastener. So it's, it's basically equals fastener.

Matthias Miller  1:36:03
So we think it's faster, difficulty,

Speaker 2  1:36:07
sure, fastener, fastener,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:12
something like that. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:36:14
Okay, so I'm also going to multiply this out by 1000 so it's a little bit more accessible,

Speaker 1  1:36:19
or you just take the total of each item and historically and divide it by bigger with bigger numbers, right?

Matthias Miller  1:36:27
Well, it's still going to come out about the same amount of time

Unknown Speaker  1:36:31
per Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2  1:36:35
Well, but if you do it, if you do it by each work order, it's gonna take longer,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:49
okay, but if you you've got better, I'm sure you have better at best.

Matthias Miller  1:36:57
I'm not, I don't know, but I don't know, but here, here's what. Here, let's run this. Oh, my goodness. I don't know how to get you all this. This is like, this is information overload. But if we go down to the let's go down to the bottom here. Let me slide it down so you can maybe I don't care, it's okay. So we have, we have here. Hand Nail is point eight, two to three inch 2.6

Speaker 1  1:37:38
My battery's low. Matt, hang on a second. I gotta get quick here.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:44
I'm on the move.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:55
Ah, we got it. Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:37:59
Look at this. This is interesting. Half inch by seven inch. Lag is 65

Speaker 1  1:38:07
I didn't bring my scratch pad. I'll be right back. All right.

Speaker 1  1:38:59
All right, buddy, oh, half inch by what inch?

Matthias Miller  1:39:04
This is just for June. So this is the hours, the number of hours to put in 1000 so it's actually the opposite. This is the easy factor.

Speaker 1  1:39:17
So I just see a bunch of numbers, so I'm not sure what they all mean.

Matthias Miller  1:39:21
Okay, so, I mean, this is broken down by item, okay, so most of the item stuff, I don't know if it matters or not. The grand total down at the bottom is probably the most interesting. Okay, so, and this is just June, so it's not a full picture.

Speaker 1  1:39:38
Oh, there it is. I see it. Okay. Can I Okay, there we go. So grand total of what? Oh, there. See, I can't see all that. I'm sorry. Hang on. Is that any better? Yeah, there, yes, yes, I see top and bottom. I don't see the item, but it's.

Matthias Miller  1:40:00
No, you can't see the item right now. Wait.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:02
So overall,

Matthias Miller  1:40:04
this is the overall across June

Speaker 1  1:40:06
went away. Okay, here we go. So I like that so,

Matthias Miller  1:40:14
but you'll see that the two to three inch nails, those screws, take three times as long. Right Hand Nail two to four inch.

Speaker 1  1:40:31
All machines, right there, wait, staple

Unknown Speaker  1:40:38
his hand, really, that's less what the

Matthias Miller  1:40:47
unless the pricing, I mean, it's worth looking at relative. I mean pricing relative to, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:55
right? That's, this is based

Matthias Miller  1:40:57
on, well, this is, this is the that's

Speaker 1  1:41:01
time per fastener. That's a time per fastener, time difficulty.

Matthias Miller  1:41:06
So it is, it is difficulty. I'm sorry,

Speaker 1  1:41:08
yes, staple, because I thought machine would be the least. Harry staples, the least. That's crazy.

Matthias Miller  1:41:21
Well, I mean, well, there's all kinds of questions around why. But anyway, yeah, anyway, seven inch lags aren't good. Carriage bolts aren't good,

Speaker 1  1:41:33
right? I mean, it takes a lot. I

Matthias Miller  1:41:36
mean, it takes longer. That's all I'm saying,

Speaker 1  1:41:38
right, right, right. No, that, that's accurate. I mean, this is very, it's very, it's very accurate. But this now we have, now we have for our score calculator. You have your formula,

Matthias Miller  1:41:51
you have your baseline of difficulty relative to

Unknown Speaker  1:41:55
history, history, I love it. I love it.

Speaker 1  1:42:03
Now you're looking at June, but then we plug in everything since July, January of last year. We've got a great starting point.

Matthias Miller  1:42:12
This will take a minute to crank. I think I know how to speed this up fairly easily. I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is. But anyway, we'll get there.

Speaker 1  1:42:21
Yeah, hey, another a side map. What we have to look at the the way that we reconcile orders that are taken out of stock items. I don't I think there's a glitch there, because I was, we were trying to do some of that today, or I'm doing something wrong. So we can do that next week. If, yeah, I should go be soon here.

Matthias Miller  1:42:48
Well, I need to, I need to go soon here. Anyway, yep, anyway, here you go, man.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:52
All right. What do we got is that,

Matthias Miller  1:42:56
yep, this is since through September, 24 January, 1, 24th through September.

Speaker 1  1:43:01
Oh. Through September. Now what are we at on stable, still there, pretty much

Unknown Speaker  1:43:09
still low, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:12
Well, so no, but listen,

Matthias Miller  1:43:14
this is what George said. Was it George, John? I don't remember John. They're like, we'd accept targets for these guys. Well, we can set targets this thing. You should be able to get this order done in X amount of time

Unknown Speaker  1:43:26
now, absolutely. And if you, if you

Matthias Miller  1:43:29
beat this, then if our pricing is right, you're going to get a bonus.

Speaker 1  1:43:33
Well, yeah, we're going to No No Matt, what is it? We're going to go back and do the thing that nobody in history ever did, and that is a accurate and a accurate piece rate program for Strasbourg palette company. The reason it didn't work was because it was way too many nuanced things, and we didn't have this. We didn't have these formulas and digital and people that knew how to do it.

Matthias Miller  1:44:00
Awesome. Man, oh, man,

Speaker 1  1:44:01
bro, this is so much fun. I mean, you, yeah, I've been wanting this my crazy whatever. What is that word? OCD, OCD, brain, yeah, that's right, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:44:15
right, whatever it is.

Speaker 1  1:44:18
Okay, so that's one step. There's more. But, I mean, I don't know your time short next week,

Matthias Miller  1:44:27
yeah, it's going to be tough to cram. Like I said, I'm willing to cram anything in. Do you have, do you have a way for me to get tuned from the

Speaker 1  1:44:33
airport? I'm thinking that. I'm thinking that potentially, myself would come and pick you up. What time you flying there?

Matthias Miller  1:44:43
It's like it's in the afternoon, four or five.

Speaker 1  1:44:46
Yeah, that's a crazy time, but yeah, I might buzz down myself and just we can chat on the way back. Okay, that's what I'm thinking right now and then when you're here. That's another factor. So the trailer that I thought with my sister, it's not really working out. So there, I don't know what you want to do, Matt, but probably motel room, if that's okay. It's fine. But me, there's one in Strasburg. It's a, I don't know. I can reserve your room if you're if you're okay with that, I'm good with that. Not my dad at all. Yep, all right. And then I would like love to give you a guest room in our house, if that'd be sufficient. But we don't have a proper guest room right now.

Matthias Miller  1:45:34
It's all good, man, I

Unknown Speaker  1:45:36
don't mind. Is there sleeping at our house?

Matthias Miller  1:45:40
If you got, if you got room, if you got room for me somewhere, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:45:45
it'd be the boys room upstairs, which could work. But I, I'm not sure, so let me yeah, I'll figure it out. I'll have all line something up, one way or the other. Thought I had, but they had some with the with the trailer somebody's moving in there next week sometime and all that. Yeah. Um, yep. So pick you up, and then when you're here, um, yeah, if you need a vehicle, you can run like we have. You can use my minivan or something like that. They're good. Yep, we'll figure that out. Yep, sounds good. Um, trying to think, anything Yeah, any other No, yeah, yeah, sounds good. Well, well, I'm sure there's the time's gonna fly. I guess

Matthias Miller  1:46:37
it's it's gonna be so short, but

Speaker 1  1:46:39
Well, I appreciate you. What you your perspective, Matt, on a potential ownership. I am serious in, in looking and like inviting you into that at some point, if you're if, if it makes sense for you. Okay, you know, I know we talked about a little bit, um, I guess, I mean, reality is you have to bring either talent or equity to or whatever. What is equity, talent or

Unknown Speaker  1:47:19
or what monetary, right?

Speaker 1  1:47:23
Yep. I mean, ideally you would bring some Monet, some monetary buy in. I think is would be ideal otherwise. I'm not sure, but I know you got the talent, and I just don't, I don't know how much time you would, but that is, I say all that because dad is really, like, shifting some, I mean, he's, it's kind of, we're kind of, like coming to a spot of, like, it's reality, and I'm kind of, I'm accepting the fact that He's not going to be a factor in the business going forward. I mean, tiny bit, but yeah, I guess whether it was me holding on to a dream or whatever, I don't know, of working with my dad and in a meaningful way, maybe that's what it was. But either way, it's, it's okay, and it were actually, it's, there's like, a shift and and with that being said, I'm okay. I'm it's wrestling, man. I'm wrestling on some stuff, like management reviews and wages and all that. But today, I mean, I know I can, I know I can do it, and I know, I know there's, there's a right, and I know that I can be God can show me that. But it's through other people at times, and it's through difficulty. It's through, I don't even know wrestling, I guess, but I just don't, I just, I'm not okay with how, like, I didn't hardly sleep last night. Like I was laying in bed for hours and I just trying to sleep. I wasn't, didn't think I was anxious, but, like, I could not sleep. Like I just, I wasn't scared, like I just, man, all this stuff in my head, and it's just, like, unresolved, unsure,

Matthias Miller  1:49:23
somebody was no answer.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:25
Like, you know, I'm going to

Matthias Miller  1:49:27
switch. I'm going to switch to my you can stay on here. I'm going to switch to my phone. Yeah, it's fine. I was thinking about you this morning. How many irons you a lot of stuff going on,

Speaker 1  1:49:45
yeah and yeah and so, just part of it is right sizing some things. And that starts with dad, which, yeah, I can share more of that with. You then, but it's, it's basically, it's him getting what he thinks is his, and making that and, like, closing the door on, on, on that, because there's been an overarching like theme of, you know, the company, like, owes him, or whatever just and anyway, we'll have to talk about it more than but I think those things are gonna, are all gonna get put to breast here, and then for me, inside the company, the biggest, the biggest one is Rick. I'm the only person here today anymore, but he's going but Rick, and it's because he still thinks that he got a bad deal 20 years ago when he was told, in his words, that he was going to get some stock in the company. Three other people did, George Deloris and George Dolores and Ken. They've all been paid out since. George is getting payments now, you know, so he's calling it bad blood. And in a sense, I'm just like, dude, what's it take to shut you up, to get this out of your head, to, like, just be done with it. Like, move on. Or, like, if I give that, if dad gets everything that he thinks he needs and wants and deserves, like, give him that amount, and then maybe he can go back to Rick and say, hey, you know what? Let's put this to bed. Here's 100,000 I don't know, whatever. Like, I just want, realizing that that stuff actually is a really stinking big deal. And so anyway, I that's part of where I'm at.

Matthias Miller  1:51:44
Well, there's a very real chance then that a lot of his self protective defensiveness is all I mean, it sounds like a lot of that's coming straight from there, so maybe that stuff can actually be resolved and cleaned up.

Speaker 1  1:51:56
Well, it needs to be. I've seen that in history, like where supposed the debt was put to rest and the blessings started flowing so so for dad, it was like he did a one and a half well With interest, $1.6 million stock payout over five years, when he transferred in the beginning of 23 which is going on, three years ago, and in the process of our addition and everything else, I kind of talked him into leaving 500 grand in the company in he did that, which helped us a lot. But he keeps bringing it up. And today we were talking because we have to renew the lease agreement, which it ends in October here. Ah, it's been nine years. Yeah, expires, and trying to right size some things, you know, and like he I need more rent, but, you know? But it's like, well, company also pays all the real estate taxes. 26 grand pays for a couple properties, pays the building insurance and all that, which rightfully should be the owner's responsibility. We're down here in the meadow trying to move a road, and you know, you guys should pay this. And we paid a huge chunk of it. It's his land. We don't benefit from it currently. But $100,000 later, and he's he paid some of the one bill, and he's still kind of about that. And so finally, and then, so we paid all but 51,000 of $150,000 invoice for all the metal work last two years today. I was like, You know what? That this stuff keeps coming up. I came to the shop, I wrote him a check for $551,000 90s. $551,096.05 the cash is in the account. And whatever he wants to do with that check, he can do it. But I'm like this 500,000 that you say that you know mean. And then one of his advisors said to me the other day, saying, Well, how's John ever gonna get his 500,000 back? I'm like, what's his land? It's his. It's all his. But you know what? It's still hanging over. And so today, I wrote him that check. Went back up, I handed it to him. He can do whatever he wants to do with it. But, I mean, he kind of, he was thinking, this is, like, kind of a combative thing, and I'm, like, that, no, I'm not this. I'm I'm not anything. I'm a here it is. This is yours, the company. Money's there. You can put it in the bank. You know, Rick's gonna have a fit if it, you know. I mean, Dad took the check and tore in half then, but I didn't, I mean, I left it with him. He can do it. I don't know if what he's going to do with it. I don't know, yeah, so, like, that's just where I'm at. I'm like, You know what, if I had ideas of legacy, and this is your company, and Dad would want this company to do well, and he's still part owner and certain things. But. If at the end of the day, if he feels this way and that way about it, here you go. And if Rick feels this way and that way about it, here you go. Because nobody else in this company is is anywhere as close to the level of adverse in certain situations is dad or Rick,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:23
and so with that being said,

Speaker 1  1:55:29
that goes away, and now whatever's left is left, and here I am, and I'm okay with where I'm at, but I'm like, okay who is in my corner, who wants to participate, and whatever happens happens. But I'm, I'm like, There's nothing holding me back. There's nothing holding us back. We're going, that's it. And I don't know where we go and where we get to, but I'm excited. Yeah, you know,

Matthias Miller  1:56:00
makes makes sense to me.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:01
Yep. So anyway, all right, dude. All right, awesome, man. Thanks, bro. You're

Speaker 1  1:56:09
you've been a blessing, dude, big time. I appreciate you. And yeah, have a great weekend with your family. And let me we'll can't connect. I'll plan on myself, probably myself picking you up on the airport Philadelphia, right. Billy, Yeah, beautiful. Love it. Awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:56:31
Awesome. Man. Thanks, man. Have a good weekend. You.
