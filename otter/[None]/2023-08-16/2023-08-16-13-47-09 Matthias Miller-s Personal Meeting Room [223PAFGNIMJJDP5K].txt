Speaker 1  18:55
Do you greatly apologize Liam came in here and was asking me something and I completely blew past our

Unknown Speaker  19:00
time. You can you hear me? Hello ello ello ello ello Hello.

Speaker 1  19:14
I apologize I Leann came in here and was asking me about something that completely shot past didn't realize where the time went.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  19:23
I was working in your macro.

Speaker 1  19:26
So here's the only thing. I guess I'm looking for some some wisdom on your part to say is that the

Unknown Speaker  19:38
good. Okay.

Speaker 1  19:40
So I have two different thoughts is one to say maybe to build a macro that does not necessarily reference the the dealerships that are assigned to that individual, but maybe use it from a user perspective and And because there is like the restricted user district thing on the user profile

Unknown Speaker  20:07
where you could you could add

Unknown Speaker  20:09
additional districts

Speaker 1  20:21
here's what I'm trying to accomplish. They're new, the guy who works with the shed app. They want to he wants to be able to have access to see what dealers are currently doing in the CRM. And I'm kind of stuck because I'm trying to figure out a way to get him access to see all the stuff he wants to see but everything that we built is based on the individual

Unknown Speaker  20:43
and I really

Speaker 1  20:44
don't want to just throw him in so like a normal user and let him Galavan around in there

Unknown Speaker  20:52
thank

Speaker 1  21:01
we don't have a current restricted user way to only let them see like say user reports do we

Speaker 1  21:25
aside from just going and writing a whole bunch of custom reports and I'm kind of I'm kind of trying to keep from doing that yes, I could literally go and write his own dealer portal for him but that just sounds terrible.

Unknown Speaker  21:39
Bob or somebody else

Unknown Speaker  21:43
not Bob It's what's his name Chris Chris

Unknown Speaker  21:48
Evans in here No, he's not currently in assist

Unknown Speaker  22:27
you didn't have

Unknown Speaker  22:28
all

Speaker 1  22:30
those list pipeless districts contact for young and smart pipe lists substitute sales rep all dealers false dealer name your an item

Unknown Speaker  22:39
the district. Holy crap. I feel confused. Well, you could do

Speaker 2  22:58
we standardize these matters. whoop dee doo. The CRM cockpit macros. Yeah. Did you know I didn't know that? Oh?

Speaker 2  23:34
Don't know why I don't know that I really like it. But that's one way. If a

Speaker 1  23:41
user is an admin, or has permission, super administrator, then give them all the sales reps.

Unknown Speaker  23:51
Otherwise, just himself? Is that what I'm reading? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  23:58
No one else does be a super administrator open up.

Speaker 1  24:01
I have no idea. But then again, if he comes, if it comes through fees on the restricted side doesn't matter anyway, because there's no way to get out of it. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:11
I mean, the other option would be adding a permission such as

Unknown Speaker  24:18
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:21
I mean, the other option, what would be the other option? Well,

Speaker 2  24:25
I mean, is this a short term deal? You have no idea. No idea. Well, that's wonderful. I know.

Speaker 1  24:41
Wait, if we swapped out Wait a minute, if I if we use that macro in all the CRM stuff, then essentially applying super administrator to one person or to one yet to that individual would allow him to gain what would it allow him to to see the dropdowns for the CRM like the main the main the main list page thing that assigns the individual that is that what I'm reading that I understand that right

Unknown Speaker  25:23
I'm not sure what would happen in that case

Unknown Speaker  25:31
but you don't want him seeing all districts do you know Don't you want a manager with the district Sergi

Speaker 1  25:52
well that's that's what I was like that's what I was the concept I was chasing based off of the user profile Well,

Matthias Miller  26:02
let's take a look at this stuff then well

Speaker 1  26:04
Riddle me this what now but then yeah, but everything everything is oh man. We don't we don't have any concept for this

Matthias Miller  26:14
where is the district field on the

Unknown Speaker  26:16
it's on the user profile

Unknown Speaker  26:19
on the the main user profile

Unknown Speaker  26:28
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  26:29
I don't know what it's there for or what the intent was

Unknown Speaker  26:37
scroll all the way down. Way I think we killed it. Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  26:47
Change the user type to dealer and hauler.

Speaker 2  26:49
Scroll down to the middle there. Change the user type. Down Down, down, down down. Not that Right, right. Great.

Speaker 1  27:03
Backup. Well, can I just wait a minute? Am I wrong?

Matthias Miller  27:14
I seem to recall is talking about something like that.

Speaker 2  27:17
Ah, hang on a second. Yeah, go to go to the window. Burkholder one

Unknown Speaker  27:33
scroll down the bottom. Well, it's a restricted user district.

Speaker 2  27:44
UserProfile restricted district. Okay, so please, at least know what this is used for. I have no idea what it's used for. Let me find out.

Unknown Speaker  27:58
You will be the magician that could tell me that.

Unknown Speaker  28:11
Come on. I don't need my Good afternoon things.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
Good afternoon, thanks.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
Oh,

Speaker 1  28:40
FYI, even there's something really, really fascinating. Yeah. From a core concept of a configurator. Do you realize how far advanced we are over something like the shed app?

Unknown Speaker  28:52
Oh, my goodness.

Speaker 1  28:55
Don't have configuration rules don't have validation rules does not have interdependency of items. Like you can't. Okay, so one of the things that we do all the time if you go if the buildings the configuration starts with a five, eight plywood and you select 50 your floor or Lux guard, it automatically will add 50 your floor and remove the five eight plywood. They don't have such a concept.

Speaker 2  29:20
I'm just like, are you serious? This is hilarious. And

Speaker 1  29:25
like the idea that you would add an item and automatically raise the walls and add overhangs because you know it requires it for that particular item. No concept for that. No concept to say hey, we don't like let's just make sure everything's done correctly and right actually validation rules that don't let you proceed without actually going back and fixing something.

Speaker 2  29:48
No. I'm like You are kidding me. What in the world? Yeah, you

Matthias Miller  29:55
know everything Josh has been saying.

Speaker 1  29:57
From a back end from a back end. The concept Mathias, I am not getting you we are way beyond then.

Speaker 2  30:07
Yeah. I was talking to Gina Bradley Kimberlin. Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:14
I mean, I know of him I don't know know him, but yes, I know who he is.

Matthias Miller  30:18
I went out for breakfast with him this morning and just chatted up and I was like, Hey, who do you know that?

Speaker 2  30:26
I'm kind of looking for another gig. And who do you know? And he's like, Well, I'm gonna go go do that.
