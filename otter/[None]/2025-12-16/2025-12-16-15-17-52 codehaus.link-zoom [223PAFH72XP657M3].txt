Speaker 1  00:22
Hey, hello. All right, maybe I should just fire this up. I

Speaker 2  00:35
don't even remember what all the different problems are. Think it's like with the invoicing stuff,

Speaker 1  00:45
invoice dates or something. Is this the right thing? Maybe, yeah,

Speaker 2  01:01
hey, let's go, Sean, you just message on the chat saying that Sean got the microphone.

Matthias Miller  01:11
Let's go. Man, that's awesome. Oh, it feels so good to get the South High center. Yeah.

Speaker 2  01:18
Oh yeah, for sure, it's been on high setter for so long.

Matthias Miller  01:22
This is, this is just okay. It's just the highs and lows of big clients. Like, yeah. It's called Momentum. Takes a little while to get in motion, but then it can keep rolling over nice little while once you do, yeah, yeah. Okay. So this is built. What was the story with?

Speaker 2  01:43
Okay, this is not that important. How long it took zfp to sign and how long it took the ball to get rolling there. Oh, I don't know you may. We may barely know that, because that was Josh. Way back there

Matthias Miller  01:54
was a lot of Josh. And then on the payroll module, it took us forever for them to land on a design because of complexity, persuade them to simplify. And like, literally, 50% of the cost was designed, and then

Speaker 2  02:10
50% of the development cost was the complexity that we should have cut out. Yep.

Matthias Miller  02:15
And then with accounting, initially, Gabe was involved. I love Gabe to death, but boy, does he dream and does not nail things down. And when we finally, when he finally, or whoever finally, said, I'm off this project, Mark, go do it. Then we started actually getting traction.

Speaker 2  02:40
I believe it. I haven't really worked at the gate, but Mark doesn't just like grass grow under his feet.

Matthias Miller  02:45
No, he doesn't, but, but he gets his details right at the same time.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
That's true, yeah.

Matthias Miller  02:52
So All right, so we have, let's start by

Unknown Speaker  02:58
record ID, see if we can have some more Net Zero. Maybe not. Do we know we got all the net zero ones already, right?

Matthias Miller  03:09
Well, we thought we did, but did we tried to?

Matthias Miller  03:18
I should just cut it down to, well, it's, there's also some sales orders

Unknown Speaker  03:21
on there, maybe, yeah, Stripe fees. Well, that just needs a,

Matthias Miller  03:33
I don't know. Probably just need the I would already run. Not me to do that. The stripe transactions just need a corrective entry. I would, I would suppose, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 2  03:50
I mean, it seems fair. This is why we wanted to get the thing cleaned up earlier, so that we don't have just a whole bunch of different ones pile up.

Matthias Miller  04:01
So I wonder if these are okay. We have sales orders. Oh, my goodness, they have stripe. These are stripe fee problems.

Speaker 2  04:18
But is it like? Oh, it's because Josh went in and cleaned up whole bunch of old stripe fees,

Unknown Speaker  04:25
yeah, yeah, for the sales orders.

Matthias Miller  04:33
How many of these are? That's not everything.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
A but it's a pretty good number. Then, okay, let's do this building one,

Matthias Miller  04:55
raw materials.

Speaker 2  04:58
Oh, this is the. The FGI stuff, right? Yeah, the FGI changes. I

Matthias Miller  05:24
The expected. This did not exist previously. So what did exist? That's fancy,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
a huge memo

Matthias Miller  05:39
building built in 2022 invoiced was voided,

Unknown Speaker  05:49
avoided, avoided. It is that why I

Speaker 2  06:04
this is just scheduled task, I assume 8:03am, or did you actually,

Matthias Miller  06:13
no, I mean, something happened with the building that voided it.

Unknown Speaker  06:24
It was a lot of time, but

Matthias Miller  06:27
it was retrieved.

Speaker 2  06:30
Are we handing retrievals correctly? Oh, they when they retrieved it. I bet they did. They clear finished goods, or maybe not

Unknown Speaker  06:44
well. Let's look at,

Matthias Miller  06:50
let's go look at.

Matthias Miller  06:59
Oh, building so field, so anyways, date, no, 418

Matthias Miller  07:19
we created it in November.

Unknown Speaker  07:27
Then cleared it When's 1212, that was

Matthias Miller  07:40
okay. That's not there.

Speaker 2  07:42
So it was something with an update, then, well, unless it was sales order changes,

Matthias Miller  07:50
well, well, Wayne

Unknown Speaker  07:55
The Rock Johnson,

Matthias Miller  07:58
he added it to an invoice.

Unknown Speaker  08:02
Right? I think so.

Matthias Miller  08:09
So at this point then, but what's baffling to me is, why would we have?

Unknown Speaker  08:21
Why would that have When did he add it to an invoice? 1212, what? What's the that was

Matthias Miller  08:33
no after that he did 40.

Unknown Speaker  08:38
That's when we cleared it. Then, right, or what?

Matthias Miller  08:43
No, we avoided it before that.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
I bet it was removed from a different invoice or something.

Matthias Miller  08:51
I'll bet too it was

Matthias Miller  09:10
you guys just created a mess. Why

Matthias Miller  09:19
would you just disconnect it from the original sales order? I original sales order? So I'm looking for modification to a sales order on 1212,

Unknown Speaker  09:36
1211, essentially,

Unknown Speaker  09:40
that's fair, right? That's fair.

Unknown Speaker  09:48
Oh, boy, he does modify things.

Matthias Miller  09:52
Well, I mean, there's this, can you look at? He switched it from this one to R, a t1, i. Then here he added the original one to a new sales order.

Unknown Speaker  10:08
I mean, yeah, that's going to change accounting impact.

Matthias Miller  10:15
And then they isolated that transaction. And we have no idea where it came from and

Matthias Miller  10:31
it went from being, I

Matthias Miller  10:38
don't even want to know, okay, so Well, the bottom line is This,

Unknown Speaker  10:56
mismatch.

Unknown Speaker  11:22
Okay,

Matthias Miller  11:50
this One wasn't a retrieval. I

Matthias Miller  12:04
it was, this is a year end move or no.

Matthias Miller  12:19
One uh, 10, 4106201, 10, 4107,

Unknown Speaker  12:32
the numbers are different

Matthias Miller  12:35
because it moved. It's it changed, right? Because there's we changed when a certain amount was applied, and I remember how that changed. This is the weirdest.

Speaker 2  12:56
Yeah, that's ringing vague bells. I well, I

Matthias Miller  13:19
don't know if you want job security, but I

Speaker 1  13:21
job security, but

Matthias Miller  13:31
I think we just earned ourselves job security with these Things will never go away.

Unknown Speaker  13:38
Yeah, what I'm

Matthias Miller  13:42
baffled with, okay, what I would expect to see is more like something like this,

Unknown Speaker  13:48
but there's not as much net change. I mean, this

Matthias Miller  13:51
one doesn't have net change, 64463,

Matthias Miller  14:01
well, 50, no, the this guy changed 10, four

Speaker 2  14:08
raw materials and raw materials to finish goods change. Oh, no, no, my dear looking I see

Unknown Speaker  14:21
how many transactions are there for that guy?

Unknown Speaker  14:24
Just two. For this guy,

Speaker 2  14:28
didn't they both change them? Oh, no. It's Oh,

Matthias Miller  14:33
we changed some stuff from invoice to build. Yeah.

Speaker 2  14:44
The don't the 50 dot, 26.105 account and the 10.0 5.109 account change.

Unknown Speaker  14:52
Yeah. I mean

Unknown Speaker  14:54
basically, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  14:57
yeah. I. Um,

Matthias Miller  15:02
okay, so if we just say, Okay, let's do this. Let's run one on building, and then let's run one on sales orders. We got 719,

Matthias Miller  15:31
we have 80 buildings, 637, sales orders, which are basically all,

Speaker 1  15:45
there's a customer deposits flip, but mostly strike fees.

Speaker 2  15:53
So there's like two none building or sales order ones,

Matthias Miller  15:58
which are, yeah, those are easy cleanups. So the next obvious one, I think would be

Speaker 2  16:18
totaling up I missed stripe fee one, well, there's listen. There's also a fair bit of under positive funds.

Speaker 1  16:27
I mean, oh, is there? Here,

Matthias Miller  16:37
it says eight instances, which means four records.

Speaker 2  16:43
Okay, I was missing last I thought I saw the whole I thought you just scrolling past, oh,

Matthias Miller  16:50
hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. This is not 14

Unknown Speaker  16:56
across companies. Well, it's still not tons. I

Matthias Miller  17:04
so what I would probably do is do an X 30 for anything that impacts undeposited funds, where the net impact is, well actually

Unknown Speaker  17:17
we could do All new

Matthias Miller  17:22
transactions. Impacting only undeposited funds and Stripe fees.

Matthias Miller  18:12
And then that would get us down to eight, like 90 rows.

Matthias Miller  18:22
These guys. I'm just,

Unknown Speaker  18:26
is this another retrieval, one or not?

Matthias Miller  18:30
66 is it this one's not? No, this is a

Unknown Speaker  18:37
here. Let me do this.

Unknown Speaker  18:57
Hey, way go. I'm one.

Matthias Miller  19:07
So this was something like,

Speaker 2  19:32
I did you code it? Quite probably have vague memories of this correctly handled. Not the picture. It's not the non manufactured one. Revise actual cost application. Yeah, this one

Unknown Speaker  19:51
I coded that about

Unknown Speaker  19:54
30 yards from where I'm sitting right now. That's awesome. Oh.

Matthias Miller  20:06
We do actual cost you.

Matthias Miller  20:23
Right? But this is a I feel like this isn't actually it.

Unknown Speaker  20:30
I feel like there's one. Oh, do

Matthias Miller  20:34
you remember like way before I

Unknown Speaker  20:44
Oh, man,

Matthias Miller  20:51
it would be on

Speaker 1  20:58
Blaine. I'm I

Unknown Speaker  21:18
maybe it was this.

Unknown Speaker  21:27
Yes, see, this just doesn't seem

Matthias Miller  21:30
it was something with the accounting impact.

Unknown Speaker  21:41
It wasn't last year. Was it? No, I would have thought so.

Unknown Speaker  22:36
Score Correct cash flows.

Unknown Speaker  22:49
Two here tries this guy.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  23:20
Signal this strips the links out.

Matthias Miller  23:24
You can use Add a correction field, rename index, split index, create,

Unknown Speaker  23:32
wait, did I sent the wrong job ID? Sorry.

Matthias Miller  23:34
Okay, well, I was gonna say because that here, here, here, but

Speaker 2  23:38
this one, that's what I was meaning to send. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:47
This is it, yeah. Box, variance, account,

Unknown Speaker  24:02
and

Speaker 1  24:19
okay, so this is The problematic job.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
Those amazing yellow and greens. Kids,

Matthias Miller  24:44
accounting should show this amount until it was applied. I. And

Speaker 2  25:24
check out your comment on 911 not that one down To reply to point number three.

Unknown Speaker  25:40
That sounds about right.

Speaker 2  25:55
That's not just an event type change. We didn't do we change event types.

Matthias Miller  26:00
We moved some parts, some of them from some of the transactions, from one event type to another, I believe. I don't know if we actually changed any.

Unknown Speaker  26:10
That sounds right. I didn't think we added any.

Matthias Miller  26:17
This is the bug fix, bring back change, which wasn't anything unused macro, which wasn't anything

Unknown Speaker  26:25
it's really all happens in that revision.

Unknown Speaker  26:34
It's a dizzy I think

Matthias Miller  26:41
the biggest problem here is that there's been no rationalization for exactly what changed. Like this stuff moved from this event that event, making it next impossible to figure out what it is We should actually be doing. I

Matthias Miller  27:04
in this case, yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:33
counting should show in this case, 638,

Unknown Speaker  27:43
he said,

Matthias Miller  27:46
I think should show 840, when it was built, on 624, and then update To this amount when built. And instead what we have, oh, but what? Okay, but this one's not actually an issue. So here, 1231 we built it and then we corrected it to to 1658, so if we go here, this guy is was built on 1231, at The 1505 number, it should have been corrected to

Matthias Miller  28:42
right. But this was actually ended up getting merged in the year,

Matthias Miller  28:56
except for some weird shenanigans when we E, 10.0, dot, 1004 105 So

Matthias Miller  29:22
we're 3138 isn't it?

Matthias Miller  29:38
So now, obviously, well, we had 37 we dropped it to 36 because we're not including the variance when we were built. It's now a separate transaction. When it was built.

Matthias Miller  30:00
But I don't understand why

Matthias Miller  30:10
the cost applied. Hang on, let's go look at this guy. How did the cost supply thing not change? I much we moved some money from building built to building and from building invoice or from building built building invoiced.

Matthias Miller  30:35
Okay, we didn't used to have an invoice transaction.

Unknown Speaker  30:50
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  30:57
when did we had that? Was that part of this job? Yeah?

Speaker 2  31:17
Now we have the invoice transaction, but the other ones haven't been fixed, because they were in a locked period, right? Because it was built 1231 and invoiced in January, then.

Matthias Miller  31:32
So we think so all of these, if we're doing our math, right?

Speaker 2  31:36
Oh, that's annoying, because if that wouldn't have happened, then it'd be a net zero, right across the transactions.

Matthias Miller  31:47
So let's look at, I'm going to guess most all of these to confirm, okay, but here's one with a discrepancy, 845, here's one with the discrepancy where it was a

Matthias Miller  32:05
everything's in 2025

Speaker 1  32:07
2024 or 2024 I

Matthias Miller  32:12
don't know. I don't think there's

Unknown Speaker  32:14
this modification in history. So share something like that,

Matthias Miller  32:19
like on any of this stuff, or on the transactions,

Unknown Speaker  32:25
no, on the like, on the building. I was curious if they Well,

Matthias Miller  32:32
it would be on the sales order, potentially. I mean, there's nothing here.

Speaker 2  32:36
I don't think there's a modify on two, one that changed the amount, an FGI amount.

Matthias Miller  32:46
Oh, the actual cost shifted, shifting around. And then this was a historical

Speaker 2  32:56
building, presumably locked at that point, already, right

Matthias Miller  33:04
okay, I have to drop I've got to go elsewhere. I need to be. I don't know what there is to do besides, one of us needs to dig in, or somebody needs to us or them. I mean these, these appear to be so there's a whole subset of actual cost changes that to me, we could potentially

Unknown Speaker  33:31
if they're just affecting raw materials,

Matthias Miller  33:34
if it's just affecting these two accounts,

Speaker 1  33:37
yeah, then we can probably just push it across. Oh. I'm

Speaker 1  34:05
okay, well, I do gotta go. Okay, good, okay, thank you. Yep. Thank.
