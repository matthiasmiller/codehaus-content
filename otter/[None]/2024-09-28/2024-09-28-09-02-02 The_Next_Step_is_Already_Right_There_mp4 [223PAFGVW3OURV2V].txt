Another pattern that I see with a lot of one of my clients is that there's these little clues. There is, there's a person, there's a situation, there's a connection, there's, there is something that's, that's, once they get clear on where it is that the next step needs to be, there's something in their life that's already there that they can tap into to take one more step forward, and it just think it's it's very easy for all of us to miss the little things that can help us, help us take the next step. But I think one of the, one of the things to navigate uncertainty is the ability to pay attention to the little things that are around us that can, that can help us take the next step. Because I find that many of us are better resourced than what we actually think that we are. So I love, I love seeing the kind of the epiphany for clients when they realize that, oh, wait, there's this thing. I've dismissed it, but it's actually significant, and I can use it as a stepping stone to get to get to the next, next place. So.
