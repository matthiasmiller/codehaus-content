Unknown Speaker  01:00
The is

Matthias Miller  01:01
this actually the right time? Now It is the right time. Oh, man, I

Unknown Speaker  01:23
wow, I'm

Unknown Speaker  01:58
Hello, gentlemen, is Angel,

Matthias Miller  02:02
that's true. Poetry,

Speaker 1  02:11
man, I'm a little sad to have not grown up more in the era of text based RPGs. You

Unknown Speaker  02:26
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  02:30
yes. So

Speaker 1  02:33
I feel like, like the cash flow feature is 80% done or 90% you know, pick your amount. You know, as those things tend to be 80% or 90% and

Unknown Speaker  02:58
whatever remains. Yeah, nice. But am am I driving this,

Speaker 1  03:13
this conversation, or, well, actually, okay, it would be helpful for me to get a sense of what we're looking at from, of what what we're hearing from Mark at all.

Speaker 2  03:33
He would like this in q4 okay? Or like us to work on this. He basically what he wants now is an estimate, or roughly how long it will take, so they can prioritize when they talk about Deaf priorities This week, end of this week,

Speaker 3  03:50
cool, cool. Okay,

Speaker 1  03:58
um, and Matthias, you have been involved in some conversations about this.

Matthias Miller  04:09
Not Well, I think here and there along the way, I have so mostly interested in this from a, I don't know that I get much more detailed, and I've been involved in a periphery, some around fielding on the financial accounts and something like that.

Speaker 1  04:33
Okay, it's about extent, okay, sweet, all right, and your your interest in it is just in while you're involved. Yes, interesting, cool, okay, um.

Speaker 1  05:04
Not completely sure where to start in figuring out an estimate we did and not zch in sight. I think we had just started playing with stuff with Drew in, I believe the live system

Unknown Speaker  05:36
sort of in a, you know, here's somewhere between alpha and beta.

Speaker 1  05:45
Can you give us some feedback? Well, I mean, let's, let's try this in your live data and see how the output compares to what you actually want. I'm wondering, actually, okay. When did they go live? I mean, from actually, the actual question is, from, when is their accounting data actually valid? Start of 2424

Matthias Miller  06:20
Yes, okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:27
let's see. And is shed time a good well, oh, here

Matthias Miller  06:33
should ABC, BBC might be the most compre would be the most comprehensive, probably. Okay, okay, okay, some variation, okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:43
let's just say, You know what I'll go with,

Speaker 1  06:59
with cash flow in July versus cash flow in oops. Six, 125, 635, um,

Matthias Miller  07:26
yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  07:31
I do have a Cash Flow Report, whether it's what relationship

Unknown Speaker  07:41
it bears to well, okay, as I recall, a big part of the remaining question is,

Speaker 1  08:10
well, essentially, how, how we deal with, how we classify accounts, and whether our I yeah, I think the Last

Unknown Speaker  08:30
bit we did was basically defining for each accounts. Subtype a default role in the cash flow statement

Speaker 1  08:49
and and then the possibility of overriding that in the on the individual accounts.

Unknown Speaker  09:02
Um so

Unknown Speaker  09:05
I think we had started to run into,

Speaker 1  09:15
into questions. Withdrew about, okay, well, what should this be defined as? Oh, I defined it like this, and

Unknown Speaker  09:30
it's the results aren't exactly what I would expect. So

Speaker 1  09:42
I think it was at about that point that that we were like, oh, there are other priorities. Let's work on those. So I.

Speaker 1  10:03
What sort of granularity is Mark looking for?

Matthias Miller  10:09
On cash flow,

Unknown Speaker  10:11
sorry, on work, work estimation.

Matthias Miller  10:17
Well, I think, I think at this point it's, I think sufficient would be to say, I mean, it's, it's a week, it's a month, it's the quarter. I mean, that's, I don't think it's reasonable that. Yeah, more granular than that,

Speaker 1  10:36
yeah, um, I mean, in that paradigm,

Unknown Speaker  10:40
I

Speaker 1  10:43
would think it's a month, is about the right order of magnitude. If we get really lucky, it might be a week. And,

Speaker 1  11:00
um, but Okay, the other,

Speaker 1  11:15
I think one other question that we that was still sort of dangling. I don't know how they're dealing with it now, actually, I think we've never really cleanly tied up unless they're manually indicating closing transactions, as At one point we

Unknown Speaker  11:39
was the approach we took. I don't think we've ever really cleanly tied up

Speaker 1  11:49
the question of transactions. You know what transactions should factor into a historical i a low kind of statement, and what should not

Unknown Speaker  12:16
so that is

Speaker 1  12:24
uh, we're probably okay here, but that is probably one of the bigger sources of uncertainty

Speaker 2  12:33
we have building. I mean, they have to specify it manually, but we have fielding for closing transactions, and the report that grabs transactions, we think might be closing transactions, they can

Speaker 1  12:45
you, and I actually looked at that at one point, didn't we? Okay, okay,

Speaker 2  12:50
so they it looks like for ABC, they have two closing transactions as of the first of the year.

Unknown Speaker  12:57
Okay. So

Unknown Speaker  13:03
so

Speaker 2  13:06
with a net a total of 6.4 million on the one transaction, so they're doing something,

Unknown Speaker  13:16
yeah, um, what are we thinking for resources? Is that Yusef, is that

Speaker 1  13:35
probably okay? I um, so some likely collaboration in the future um Matthias. What questions do you have around this thing? I mean, probably most of them Are go beyond estimation, but

Unknown Speaker  14:15
I mean

Matthias Miller  14:23
yeah, probably the biggest thing in my mind is, if we could have, is there any view from which Mark and Drew can drill down to see which specific transactions are impacting cash flow?

Unknown Speaker  14:43
That's a great question.

Matthias Miller  14:46
It feels like everything else is just that they could actually bear the brunt of this project.

Speaker 1  14:53
Yeah, okay, I have no idea what this report is. There. Say cash flows, report, helper, transactions. It sounds like there was some intent to

Speaker 1  15:15
go in that direction. Okay, account period here.

Matthias Miller  15:22
Let me just looks like it was intended to be used as a helper or as a

Unknown Speaker  15:28
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:32
And here's accounts.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
Okay, recent period name, prior period name,

Matthias Miller  15:43
recent period starting and

Speaker 1  15:47
Okay, so a lot of this is okay accounts and okay accounts and transactions take the same i

Speaker 2  16:06
and the Cash Flow Report has a sub pain for account, which, if you, if you just flipped a system switch, that'll show it.

Speaker 1  16:16
Ah, that's the deal.

Speaker 2  16:18
Yeah, there's no sub pain. The sub pain for transactions isn't added yet.

Unknown Speaker  16:24
It looks like okay or,

Speaker 2  16:28
I mean, it may be working, I don't know, but it's not later main report.

Speaker 1  16:32
So there is the question of, was I getting started? I mean, what is the state of these diagnostic reports? Is it I knew I wanted them and was getting started, or is it, oh, yeah, they've Been working well, and

Unknown Speaker  17:01
I 20.

Unknown Speaker  17:18
Name right is search.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
Hmm,

Unknown Speaker  17:47
well, my team right search could be faster.

Matthias Miller  17:51
It looks to me like the transactions was intended to be a sub pane of the accounts. Oh, okay, and it actually is,

Speaker 2  18:04
but the accounts report isn't showing anything. No, no, there it is, but it's not, Oh, it's getting some transactions. I

Unknown Speaker  18:27
Oh, okay, so we've got, oh, so we do have two sub panes here,

Speaker 2  18:35
the transactions, the sub pain of accounts, which is why I haven't seen that. Okay, okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:41
Oh, so,

Speaker 2  18:44
I mean, do we give this to mark and Drew and say, poke at this and find all the problems

Matthias Miller  18:49
that would actually be, I actually kind of like that. Could we, you guys, find the limitations in this, and then we'll get back to you. Like, we think it's, I think your estimates, estimates good. We think it's maybe a month, maybe a week, maybe two months. But if you guys can have a chance to take a look at this and get us a list of issues that you see off the top of your head, our conversation on Friday,

Speaker 1  19:11
yeah, and you know what, um, I Think, long, long ago. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  19:30
there is an email.

Speaker 1  19:42
I all, I'm re surfacing, and this email in light of the interest in resurrecting the project. It

Unknown Speaker  20:10
Okay, so maybe

Speaker 1  20:31
Okay, well, I'm not sure how much this email will actually be helpful for us right at the moment,

Speaker 3  20:39
I but

Unknown Speaker  20:45
I

Speaker 1  20:52
think probably the biggest thing is it, it does illustrate the kind of thing that work, where looking at,

Speaker 2  21:14
well, things like this. Can each one of these little things will take a few hours in that.

Unknown Speaker  21:22
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  21:33
So, yeah. I think I think having them poke around in it could be a great

Unknown Speaker  21:42
approach, just with the with the a trust, nothing rubric.

Matthias Miller  21:56
The basic underlying mechanism for this is that each line item gets translated into what you're calling an action, which is basically a line item plus increase or decrease, or a Cash Flow Report, line item plus increase or decrease. Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  22:16
That I think that's right. I

Matthias Miller  22:25
would we is that always a one to one correlation? For example, if we decided that we were going to use structures in which each grouping effectively is an account type subtype category and increase or decrease.

Speaker 1  22:53
Account Type subtype category increase or decrease.

Speaker 3  23:00
I I

Speaker 1  23:12
have a hard time answering definitively whether that's a one to one. I

Unknown Speaker  23:27
getting that old rusty crane to move just a bit. I

Speaker 1  23:38
on memories. I mean, I think that's going to be the case for most stuff the I have this vague FUD sense about i

Speaker 1  24:03
What would it be? Okay? The thing that come that came to mind was

Unknown Speaker  24:13
transactions that actually shift about among the three major buckets in the statement. But I

Speaker 1  24:31
that's going off of fossilized memory rather than actual current reasoning about what might actually be relevant.

Speaker 1  24:55
Okay, so maybe it. Just pulling up. Okay, that one job that has screenshots of sample cash flow statements that's 157953,

Unknown Speaker  25:21
whoops.

Speaker 1  25:24
Wait, how did I get into a chat with oh, that's the wrong one, um, 9350, yes, I missed the five. Um,

Unknown Speaker  25:45
okay,

Matthias Miller  25:48
so

Unknown Speaker  25:56
let's see as I

Speaker 1  26:14
okay adjustment to net cash depreciation position.

Speaker 1  26:32
Okay, so most of these are pretty simple, decrease or increase in The Um,

Speaker 1  26:54
okay, most of my FUD comes from one I think depreciation and amortization, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  27:11
I'm guessing we still have stuff to do on those equity transactions. I'm not sure are correctly handled. Stuff like dividends, owner payouts, and maybe we did actually handle them late in the game, but I think That was stuff I was wrestling Pretty hard with. I

Matthias Miller  28:05
Let's see.

Speaker 1  28:22
Okay, so Matthias, your question again? Wow.

Matthias Miller  28:36
Sorry, I lost my question.

Speaker 1  28:38
Okay, sorry you were asking. About a one to one correspondence between right?

Matthias Miller  28:46
I mean, but the short answer is, no, that's not true, because you infer what happens in the cash flow depends on multiple accounts touching three different things, then for sure, that's not going to work.

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Yeah, and we do have the two different let's see.

Speaker 1  29:18
Okay, this is slowly resurfacing some things.

Speaker 1  29:34
Shoot, I think for depreciation, there's Yeah,

Speaker 1  29:45
okay. Generally speaking, I think we take the indirect approach of saying, you know, our inventory. Inventory amount went up by a million. Therefore that means we invested a million dollars in inventory right here. Rather than saying I bought that that 200 different times through the year, I bought lumber or screws or whatever, and that went into inventory

Unknown Speaker  30:40
for depreciation.

Speaker 1  30:52
I sort of think there was something where we needed to to actually tap into the individual transactions, rather than,

Speaker 1  31:14
well, okay, a table, I said, some of depreciation and amortization expenses and period, so that would be the direct sum. I don't, I don't remember how, all the what, all the underlying rationale was there. I

Unknown Speaker  31:44
Oh, other investment, cash flow,

Unknown Speaker  31:59
yeah, right?

Matthias Miller  32:05
So effectively, what we're doing the reason for handling amortization depreciation is because it bridges the gap between net income and cash flow.

Speaker 1  32:16
Yeah, yeah. That's, I mean, that's a huge part of it. Yeah. It's well, basically you're we need to take all your non cash profits and expenses and back them out, right exactly, exactly. So, yeah, yeah. Right? So in some cases,

Speaker 1  32:54
now, I mean, what I can't quite figure out is, oh,

Unknown Speaker  33:14
we're showing

Speaker 1  33:31
my initial Okay, the initial question that I think my past self answered negatively is, well, why couldn't we just take, you know, treat accumulated depreciation the same as we do other stuff. You know, take starting and ending balances. I mean, the change in and that's your, your thing. Um,

Speaker 1  34:11
but then we are, of course, churning with asset sales and purchases and whatever, and I suspect that's what made the individual transaction stuff seem like it made sense? I have not reconstructed that logic, though that's.

Unknown Speaker  35:03
Okay, purchases, oh, purchases, of, does that have the same issue? Um,

Unknown Speaker  35:28
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  35:32
I think it would be worth questioning

Speaker 1  35:40
whether whether I am over complicating things and,

Speaker 1  35:54
oh, well, okay, no, we say, sorry I'm looking at this table in that job where we have purchases of physical investments of various sorts and sales of physical investments of various sorts. Any right? If we actually need to break out purchases and sales, then we've got to go to a transaction basis. Now, right? I do see that second cash flow statement we have. It does talk about purchase of property and equipment.

Unknown Speaker  36:48
It doesn't say anything about sale. So maybe it's an interesting question, is it net purchase? In which case, maybe

Matthias Miller  37:05
was a net purchase, or is it, or is it that there were no sales in the period? Yeah, yeah, I guess there are some zero line items, but,

Speaker 1  37:17
right, okay, how to deal with equipment purchases in Cash Flow Statement under in indirect cash flow statement. Um,

Unknown Speaker  37:45
okay, purchase,

Speaker 2  37:52
equip, oh,

Speaker 1  38:06
um, okay, purchase of equipment. Oh, the effect, right, right, the effect of the purchase of equipment on the cash flow statement depends on other Cash was involved in the purchase. So, of course,

Matthias Miller  38:36
so

Unknown Speaker  38:45
now sale of equipment. Well, okay,

Speaker 1  38:56
let me just send you what I'm the page I'm looking at, even though I have not fully processed it cluttering audra's messaging, but,

Unknown Speaker  39:21
okay,

Speaker 1  39:27
purchased equipment For or Yeah, fine, finance purchase, partially financed purchase,

Unknown Speaker  39:41
okay,

Matthias Miller  39:47
right? This is, this is where we get into complexity, because, yeah, you have, you have, you have to, the transaction has. Dual impact. Impact on it has a cash impact, but also has an impact on expense, you know, or operating expense adjustments,

Unknown Speaker  40:12
yeah, through depreciation,

Matthias Miller  40:15
through depreciation and gain or loss of value.

Speaker 1  40:18
Well, yeah, yeah, okay, you're looking at the sale. I'm looking at the sale, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  40:27
So, I think it is in that stuff that we get into,

Unknown Speaker  40:37
probably stuff we are Not, completely dealing with at this point.

Unknown Speaker  40:53
Have we been

Matthias Miller  41:09
so aren't we effectively saying,

Matthias Miller  41:18
Okay, so for some line items, we are looking at the delta between the full account, yep. And for some line items. Are we doing that all week, all the time? And this is going to buy this for these guys.

Speaker 1  41:36
Um, without digging into the report, which I think at the moment, you have done more than I have. I mean, within the last number of

Unknown Speaker  41:52
minutes, then I'm not sure what we're doing on the investing activities. I mean, okay, we,

Speaker 1  42:08
I do remember that there were these separate modes. And so I think in, um,

Speaker 1  42:27
okay, no, I actually don't have a clean answer to that until we dig through

Matthias Miller  42:34
I have a completely this is, this is the knuckleheaded assumption. Which is just me saying making me feel better if you say it's stupid, I think the let's be honest, isn't isn't there conceivably, a world in which we could have a virtual RG on a transaction that says, What are the lines on the cash flow statement that this affects, and by what amount, and we assume it to be effective as of the transaction date. Okay, does that is there a world in which that's that's feasible?

Unknown Speaker  43:16
You say a virtual? RG, well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  43:19
maybe it's virtual, maybe, we catch it? I don't know. I mean, it could be captured and stored like an on a field change expression. But is that a model that could? Could we? Could we reduce the complexity in some capacity? And maybe it's, maybe it's a background X 30, maybe it's a field change expression, maybe it's macros, maybe it's an array of structures.

Speaker 1  43:48
I think that should be possible. And shoot if we get beyond virtual at some I mean, in there are just some transactions I think that are just really, much, really hard to classify completely.

Matthias Miller  44:19
You could say manually classify this for the cash flow adjustment,

Unknown Speaker  44:23
yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:26
and I mean, an array of structures would work elegantly. So you could have a lot that you can calculate in a report. Show in a report, you can stop it into an RG, and then you resort, you can, you can index on it, pull out values you can use record totaling.

Speaker 1  44:43
It might be a lot faster. Yeah, I'd be a lot faster and well, yeah, I mean, as it is, I mean, you've been diving into the code. It's a I am simultaneously proud of it and for. Fight, I

Matthias Miller  45:03
understand it's it is? It is really complicated, because there is no unless you have strict rules to enforce. I mean, imagine a weird scenario in which you sell a piece of equipment and post it to AR, yeah, and somebody pays for it.

Unknown Speaker  45:21
Well, how's that gonna work? Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:27
Like, I mean, there's a million in one ways in which you almost build your accounting system itself to do a full audit trail of all activities in such a way that you can actually legitimately report on the income on the cash flow statement,

Unknown Speaker  45:43
yeah, included.

Speaker 1  45:50
Let me just throw this in and then go on. I was intrigued within the last few days to note that QuickBooks has a Cash Flow Report. I haven't looked at it,

Unknown Speaker  46:03
but it surprised me a bit. But like, how do you do this with data entry? Anyway? Yeah, but yes, please continue.

Matthias Miller  46:20
I'm gonna guess that there's some accountants that look down their nose at it because it's horribly oh well anyway, without making a majority of statements about the QuickBooks user base, I'm gonna guess 9% of them look at it and like, Oh, cool. And then there's like, 2% that are like, Y'all crazy. I

Matthias Miller  46:46
I could get really excited about a design like that.

Speaker 1  46:53
I think that could be pretty cool. So you you pre calculate your cash flow impact scenarios and, oh, so that really okay, so that's going to the direct model. Oh,

Matthias Miller  47:19
you can't, but you can't. Couldn't you do an indirect model as well? Binger Didn't your depreciation, it tied out to

Matthias Miller  47:42
line items as well. Or am I completely misunderstanding, like, Um,

Speaker 1  47:50
okay, couldn't your depreciation get tied out to line items?

Matthias Miller  47:56
Okay, on a direct model? Basic? Basically, you're not a direct a direct model does not necessarily display

Speaker 1  48:12
you aren't going right. You are. You're building up your cash flow and depreciation, never right enters in in that case,

Matthias Miller  48:23
but in this case, we would, we even in the indirect model, you would still have cash flow impact for the depreciation expense accounts. And so technically, it's kind of calculated like a direct model. It's just represented in an indirect fashion.

Speaker 1  48:39
Yeah, yeah. So the Yeah, so you So, what you're capturing is the the individual transactions impact on the indirect, indirect statement, yeah, yeah. Which I mean, yeah. So basically, rather than trying to calculate all those impacts within this report, we we pre calculate, well, whatever right? We decentralize the calculation. At least.

Matthias Miller  49:15
I don't know if there's any real Is there any real advantage to

Speaker 1  49:24
Well, yeah, I think so. Um, I mean, this is a beast of an expression to evaluate we are building the report. The entire report through evaluation of one expression, right?

Unknown Speaker  49:50
It's a bit terrifying. So anything that, let's just say, hey.

Speaker 1  50:00
To evaluate each record, some the totals, you know, whatever, all, that's a pretty good thing.

Speaker 2  50:06
And then you can actually trace it down to a lot more easily. Uh huh. It's really nice.

Unknown Speaker  50:13
Uh huh, right, right.

Matthias Miller  50:14
I mean, you can literally flip the totals and subtotal switch

Unknown Speaker  50:20
at that point. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  50:22
yeah, well, I mean, maybe, well, barely.

Speaker 1  50:28
I mean, you've got weird stuff. I mean, here we have different periods showing so how do you

Unknown Speaker  50:36
I mean, it does get weird, but I think still a lot more slice and dice able.

Matthias Miller  50:57
The other thing I like from it, this is just from a project standpoint, is that if you do this, Seth will have full 100% ownership. Yeah. It's a little bit like, how do you get somebody to own a subsystem? Will you make them rewrite it?

Speaker 1  51:19
Yeah? Well, I think that that would pretty much guarantee that we are not looking at one week. What does it do for

Unknown Speaker  51:39
for the other side of things is it, is your intuition?

Unknown Speaker  51:45
Are we still at a month, or should we inflate that?

Matthias Miller  51:56
I mean, I think it's probably fair to say we think at this point that it's one to two months. Okay, let's take a step back. Yeah, getting giddy depreciation and purchases to work like, isn't this practically a prerequisite to sanely handling at least purchase, purchases and sales?

Unknown Speaker  52:22
Yeah? Probably.

Matthias Miller  52:27
And I love, I really, I know this is good, bad, good or bad, but I just love the idea of saying, Look, we have this really bizarre scenario here that we're not able to infer the cash flow impact. Go, like,

Unknown Speaker  52:44
tell us about it. Yeah, just

Matthias Miller  52:47
fix it. Like, maybe we can, and then eventually we can maybe say, Well, are there any of these we could have handled automatically? Yeah. The one downside is that presumably we'll need to process an X 30 or something that we could run periodically on system update that goes and recalculates cash flow impact when we change the law,

Speaker 1  53:06
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, you know what that? That is perfect because, yeah, we've got this complicated classifier.

Matthias Miller  53:27
It avoids the middleman of classifier, don't you?

Speaker 1  53:29
Or Well, I mean, I think you still want a classifier that handles the stuff we know about.

Unknown Speaker  53:36
But, okay, but yeah, and just on individual records and keeping you from having to worry about most stuff, rather than trying to be the the god accountant

Matthias Miller  54:02
that's incredibly useful. It also means, here's also what I like about it. It might mean within four weeks, like, if we just do this, I think Mark, they can do it. Mark would be relatively content to say, Okay, we're just gonna manually handle depreciation or purchases and sales for the next few months. We'll just do it all right, 2026, let's clean it up, automate it a little bit more. Yeah, we just, we just, this is another, another. Speed to market, I suppose,

Unknown Speaker  54:45
yes,

Matthias Miller  54:50
I could actually get excited about cash flow. Now I.

Speaker 1  55:00
And then the adventurers said, you know, we've gained a lot of information from this skyscraper. Now, where is our dynamite?

Speaker 2  55:19
Oh, that reminds me of the terrifying video of the skyscraper. And was it Bangkok that collapsed in the last six months? Oh, it was under one with the Oh, okay. Oh, is it was that with an earthquake or not? I don't remember. Well, there

Speaker 1  55:33
was one with a pool, like a an infinity pool.

Unknown Speaker  55:38
Oh, not that. Okay.

Speaker 3  55:40
Don't

Matthias Miller  55:43
tell me, it was like an attempt to be a record setting building.

Unknown Speaker  55:51
I don't think so.

Speaker 1  55:54
Look on my work. See mighty and despair.

Matthias Miller  55:59
Well, I mean, I think it's more like a blessing to so. Joel, have you read The Secret Life of real estate and banking? No. So the basic idea is that the real estate market goes in 18 year cycles, with the exception of there's like one exception and covid, plus AI, injected a whole bunch of cash in the economy, which has delayed our economic reset. But one of the leading indicators of economic turmoil is the world's largest building being completed because indicates, I mean, it indicates a gross oversupply of real estate.

Speaker 1  56:51
At gross oversupply. I mean, gross okay, I'm I'm not drawing the connection.

Matthias Miller  56:56
So, so at the point that you have overproduced real estate, you now have over invested capital in the economy. There's demand supported to support those capital investments. I mean, it affects real estate. I mean, it's basically a mirror, like a sure microtasm mirror, of what's happening broadly in real estate. So sure, real estate inventory increases, increases, increases, increases, increases. Somebody builds the biggest building, that's kind of the, you know, the butterfly wings, that signals the economy that we've now oversupply in real estate, and we go down the the trend, everything you know, real estate becomes, becomes cheaper. When people become, you know, if you bought at a peak, you feel the strain of having, you know, evaluations dipping and not being able to sell. Or actually, not true, but whatever, yeah, he probably explains it's way better. This is a layman's about second person perspective of the book. So you remind me the kind of person that would find it intriguing.

Unknown Speaker  58:10
I mean, it does sound intriguing,

Matthias Miller  58:13
but he states it all to like, you know, studying all of those 18 year periods since, yeah, long it's been so,

Unknown Speaker  58:21
Oh, my word. All

Matthias Miller  58:28
right, so I was gonna say the world's tallest building glass. It might mean that

Speaker 2  58:36
there's, it was tight. I was just using it was tied to, it was not the world's tallest building, but there was an earthquake, and I think it was short. I don't know if it was with the earthquake or was a bit afterward, not quite sure one or the other, but there's just horrifying footage of like, a 35 story building. Just, wow.

Unknown Speaker  58:59
Yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  59:02
investigations are really just design and construction deficiencies,

Unknown Speaker  59:07
including, sorry, how's that?

Matthias Miller  59:10
Investigations reveal design and construction deficiencies?

Speaker 1  59:14
Oh, yeah, that's not ideal, yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:18
92 confirmed deaths consider one of the deadliest structural failures in the country's history.

Unknown Speaker  59:25
Wow.

Matthias Miller  59:28
Sorry, I don't hear you listen to international crises. Sorry. Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  59:34
Here's the one I was thinking of, the

Unknown Speaker  59:41
infinity pool turning to a waterfall,

Unknown Speaker  59:49
just sounds like a Whoa.

Unknown Speaker  59:57
I mean, just a. I can feel the horror of that dislocation viscerally.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
Wow,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
yeah, it's insane.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:27
Anyway.

Matthias Miller  1:00:39
Oh, okay, all right. Well, okay, so, I mean, realistically, we think within two to three weeks, if we give them the override functionality, we give them a functional version, I would say, within as long as two three weeks, depending how much manual work they want to do. And depending on how good we want to make it, how automated we want to make it, it could be two months, depending what other kinds of weird things we

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
run into. Uh huh, yeah, that sounds right.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
All right. That's sort of cool. Like it,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
hey, wait, does that? Okay? No, so we still want

Speaker 1  1:01:28
information from accounts, hinting what category, at least the default classifier should,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
should put them in. Okay, sorry. I asked the question and immediately jumped to the answer.

Speaker 1  1:01:50
My question was, wait, can we eliminate the cash flow line item thing on accounts? I think the answer is no, we actually don't want to, but

Speaker 2  1:02:04
Yeah, isn't that how we automatically cash stuff?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
Then, yeah, right

Matthias Miller  1:02:12
now, if you want to go super crazy, you could add, you could allow custom cash flow classifier expressions.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:29
I mean, that could be pretty cool,

Matthias Miller  1:02:32
and then we could put them in as user as as, actually, what's what would probably be better, I would think, is we, we come up with our own reports and activities or something that identify ones that we I don't know if you want to, If you want to bypass an update. For example,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
we want to bypass and update

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
the classifier. I was

Unknown Speaker  1:03:12
just gonna say if zfp is being zfp and they want it

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
now, right? We're

Matthias Miller  1:03:19
like, we want to play around with classification of this transaction and be able to temporarily apply a custom classification to this anyway, I'm jumping ahead of myself. It's probably not useful, but it's interesting, though interesting. Oh,

Speaker 1  1:03:46
have a pre and a post, I mean, a well, yeah, one that takes precedence over our classifications, and one that sweeps up the leftovers of stuff we can't Get

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
Cool, all right, good. Oh, this is fun. I'll happily participate in seeing if I can scrounge some dynamite.

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
Cool, cool. Okay, all right, then we will take back to that. I'm sure we'll have more more questions.

Speaker 1  1:04:47
Yep, excellent, awesome. All right, thanks, gents,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
thanks. Joel, thank you. Hi,

Matthias Miller  1:04:56
other stuff you asked about. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Second and.
