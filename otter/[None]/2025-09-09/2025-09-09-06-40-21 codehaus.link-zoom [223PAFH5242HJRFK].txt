Matthias Miller  00:20
I'm already got your coffee. I see you

Unknown Speaker  00:30
got yours.

Speaker 1  00:33
Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I see you got your coffee too.

Matthias Miller  00:40
Oh, you see, I got my coffee.

Unknown Speaker  00:42
I'm waiting. Oh, you take a drink.

Matthias Miller  00:44
Oh, I did take a drink. Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  00:49
Water unless that, unless that wasn't coffee. Oh, is your water? Your AI? Water Bottle,

Matthias Miller  00:56
yeah, water bottle. All right, I

Speaker 1  01:00
hear you are playing and say you got transactions ready to push

Matthias Miller  01:07
almost one big thing first, okay? EPO, hmm.

Speaker 2  01:14
Etos. EPO. EPO,

Matthias Miller  01:27
um, how do we identify links,

Matthias Miller  01:40
contracts? And let's go over to, is this where you want to start? By the way,

Speaker 1  01:50
sure, but let's, let's, let's identify which ones I had spec to be EPO, to be EPODE. EPODE. By the

Matthias Miller  01:59
way, we should probably no,

Speaker 1  02:01
by the way, just go to go to User folders.

Matthias Miller  02:05
We should probably not overpay these as a side note,

Unknown Speaker  02:10
probably a good idea.

Matthias Miller  02:13
Okay, use folders,

Speaker 1  02:17
Report reports. Try this for a contract search. Hit the hit the continue. Okay, see, this is what a contract this is what a contract report should look like, All right, just a something like this. This is, this was when I started whipping up, because I got hacked off with the other one.

Matthias Miller  02:38
I love it. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  02:43
which, oh, actually, go back to that for a quick second.

Unknown Speaker  02:47
So scroll the way to the bottom.

Speaker 1  02:51
How about that? Then you've got contract totals, you've got contract balances. You've got calculations of EPOS and and we I get, we got to figure out, well, I want, I want to figure out some groupings and filterings, because if, well, there's just, there's so many cool things now that we start having data and these reports, it's just like, my, my, my fingers get so itchy to go be like, Oh yeah, guys. Like, bliss. Like, do you realize? Do you realize what you can do? Like, let me teach you a little

Matthias Miller  03:29
bit. Yeah, exactly. Let's group,

Speaker 1  03:33
okay, just for kicks. Like, you know, grouping by by term length, great. Group them by, you know, I don't know, like, any, any number of things, it's like, Yes,

Matthias Miller  03:46
I have, per client, built a assembly an analysis report where you can group by its manufacturing, client, customer, item, Assembly, method, team, employee, day, month, year, you can group by one and subgroup by the other, plus filtering all this stuff. It is like,

Speaker 1  04:05
and that talks, wait, let me see. Let me see how your group set up. So then in the grouping, no, I'm saying, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like this thing. So you're inputting the Ask prompt into the group setting. Yes, gotcha

Matthias Miller  04:25
hard coded. I mean, this could be a list in the catalog if you wanted to in catalog macros. But, I mean, man, it is so awesome. He's like, Okay, I want to group by day and I want to group by by employee and day. Oh, this employee works 16 hours this day. That's pretty interesting.

Speaker 1  04:47
Yeah, yeah, that's that's quite a bit more elegant than some of the things I did with I have some similar things working with, reports that I use to evaluate. Eight buildings that were, you know, built in a timeframe. And because I get this quite often from the builders, like, Okay, how many, how many buildings? How many vinyl buildings did I build in 2020, you know, in the last year? Okay, break it down by color, so I know what colors and and then there's, there's this interesting one where I think it's smart side, or somebody gives incentives to shed shed guys. And so they want to know, Okay, how many, how many painted buildings did I do last year? Well, then, you know, you break it out by color. So then it's because it's always more interesting if you can, if you can group by color, because it's like, well, now I know what my top selling colors are. And I had started doing fun things like, oh, there was another one that I put in square feet. Like it was one thing to have units, but then it was fun to have, like a square foot measurement, summing of square foot for for the buildings, because then it's like, well, that's that tells a different story. But story, besides just units and, Oh man, it's just you just, you start going off a cliff. And it's the bad part is like, I do this sometimes it's like, I it's like, it's one off enough that you don't really want to save it, because it's, you know, it might be different the next time. And if you try to embody it into to ask prompts in order to configure it like the next time it comes around, it's so long since the last time it's like, I don't remember how this thing worked. Let me just go redo it, you know, right?

Matthias Miller  06:29
And rebuild it. Yeah, exactly. Speaking of which, somebody needs to call Jimmy Donald, your neighbor, aka Mr. Beast, and say, Hey, would you like to go pay off, do an early payoff in an entire rent to own company? That would make a great video.

Speaker 1  06:49
Do what? Now, okay, come in and pay off an entire rent to own company at all the customers. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:56
I Yeah. Two point. You know, you have to find the right company.

Speaker 1  07:03
I pay for him, 2.22 point 2. Million would be nothing. It's like,

Matthias Miller  07:08
I mean, it'd make a great video, yeah.

Speaker 1  07:12
But how would, how would you, how would you get the human angle? Like, just go out and start interviewing customers. I guess you know, no, here would be the fun one. You go to a big RTO company and you say, I want to pay off all of your customers that are past due. And like you literally go out with a repo truck. You pull up and and you tell the customer, hey, we're here to let you know that we're not actually here to repo your building today. Just want you to know your buildings paid off. Merry Christmas.

Matthias Miller  07:46
Yes, yeah, that would be so much fun. Yes, yes. All right, so go hunting down your neighbors. Make it happen. All right,

Unknown Speaker  08:00
why you think my neighbor,

Matthias Miller  08:03
Mr. Beast, is in North Carolina somewhere?

Unknown Speaker  08:05
Are you serious?

Matthias Miller  08:20
He was born in Wichita, raised in Greenville.

Speaker 2  08:28
He's in Greenville. He's in Greenville.

Unknown Speaker  08:33
Fascinating. Be fun to go tour his studios?

Matthias Miller  08:40
Yeah, it would be. It's pretty exciting. Do you

Speaker 1  08:42
follow Dude Perfect? Just ish so I Lex loves Dude Perfect. It's funny, a 14 year old girl loves watching Dude Perfect, but so I keep track of their videos, enough like when they moved into their new their new studio space that is insane. Like, I don't know, it's a huge warehouse complex that they converted into their their studio space, and the amount of just for to be able to do all the trick shot stuff that they do, and it's astounding. It's yeah, but anyway, moving on.

Matthias Miller  09:26
All right, um, all right, so EPO resolution, okay, there is a resolution of early payoff,

Speaker 1  09:36
yeah, so I do have some with, with um, with resolutions.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
Yes. Now we

Matthias Miller  09:45
don't have anything to indicate the early resolution date,

Unknown Speaker  09:47
though, I would say we just make it up.

Matthias Miller  09:52
But shouldn't it be stored somewhere or,

Unknown Speaker  09:58
I mean, it's.

Speaker 1  10:03
Yes, probably, maybe. So, in other words, when the when the contract resolution is set, it stores a date to go along with it.

Matthias Miller  10:17
Yeah.

Speaker 1  10:19
I mean, I could see that happening. Unless, unless it becomes, it becomes some sort of indication in the in the transaction history, that's a, that's what it is,

Matthias Miller  10:33
okay, well, early payoff would have a, I mean, but what kind of

Speaker 1  10:47
you should make a note at some point that we need to reverse, sort this that RG, right,

Unknown Speaker  11:01
or sorted in some I don't know Anyway, um,

Speaker 1  11:21
probably as far as the the the point, I would probably say, let's, let's pick a random point around The average of 22 months for when to pay these off, because that's kind of like the like rent, and when I say like, depending, depending on the contract term, and so like, plus or minus, you know, five or six months, around the 22 month mark,

Matthias Miller  12:01
okay, so we could just do

Matthias Miller  12:09
and we would just stop payments then at that point. So really, what we want to do,

Speaker 1  12:15
so are you? Are you thinking you'll like, you'll generate payments, and the ones that are flagged for payoff. We'll stop at at that point, and then we'll go and add the final EPO payment. Yeah, that makes sense.

Matthias Miller  12:40
No, let's do this. Let's do new Oh, come on. You really gotta be kidding me. Oh, It's not okay. New File.

Matthias Miller  13:21
This is a contract, not a work order, spend spending enough time work orders, no input,

Matthias Miller  13:34
the early payoff or a return or

Matthias Miller  13:46
a retrieval, right?

Speaker 1  13:51
Do we? Do we have what's going to be the, what's going to be the contract resolution for someone who pays to the very, very end of the contract payout? Was there a payout? Okay, but that's that's not really relevant for this conversation.

Matthias Miller  14:10
No, it's not correct. Actually, let's actually do this. I'm going to do this as a report chunky payoff. So we're going to do contract.

Unknown Speaker  14:28
Contract ID,

Matthias Miller  14:35
contract term, don't we have, truly, we've got, like, a contract end date.

Speaker 2  14:45
No, no, we don't. Not that I know of okay,

Matthias Miller  14:50
we're going to do contract,

Speaker 1  14:55
which would be, what contract end date would be, what you were talking about, storing a. Eighth at the point of a resolution.

Matthias Miller  15:08
You're saying something from like three to eight months prior.

Unknown Speaker  15:13
Three to eight months prior? What

Speaker 2  15:17
of contract term? Yeah, no. It would

Speaker 1  15:29
be so the average customer pays off at 22 months. So give or take five or four to six months on either either side of that, that 22 mark.

Matthias Miller  15:47
Never mind. So let's do sorry how much I'm

Speaker 1  15:52
so 22 minus six and 22 plus six, so 28 so 28 months, and whatever the other is, 220 1616, and 28

Matthias Miller  16:12
Okay, and then we just delete everything for periods

Unknown Speaker  16:19
on or after that date, Right, correct.

Matthias Miller  16:33
Cheer imports in board the burritos.

Matthias Miller  16:46
That tracker, report path so we have, I'm

Speaker 1  17:56
now, the only Okay, the only thing to to think about here. Do we have, do we have any 24 month contracts in this list?

Matthias Miller  18:04
I don't know that we can.

Speaker 1  18:34
Go back, show me what you just did there. Explain that to me you

Matthias Miller  18:39
have the random number, choose the lesser of the number in the contract term.

Unknown Speaker  18:45
Gotcha Okay,

Matthias Miller  18:53
the remaining months. Wait a minute. This is bogus. I didn't want to do that. I'm curious about this, because if we go back to contracts now, your fancy report,

Unknown Speaker  19:18
how?

Speaker 1  19:21
So basically I went, I went and found all the contracts that had overrun and started doing negative months and assigned resolutions to them so that we can, you know, handle them.

Matthias Miller  19:34
Okay, okay, so let's go here. So then here we have a term of, sorry, I'm going to make those Biggers I can actually read. Actually read, which means smaller for

Unknown Speaker  19:45
you. In 36 you're fine, sure you're good.

Unknown Speaker  19:59
April, 5. Five

Matthias Miller  20:02
it's 18 months. How is it getting? How is it calculating remaining months?

Matthias Miller  20:16
Oh, well, okay, fine. It

Speaker 1  20:19
probably shouldn't be able to calculate it beyond the Well, no, that's not true. We can't exceed the term.

Matthias Miller  20:28
How is it getting the monthly pay? How is it getting a negative monthly payment as well?

Matthias Miller  21:03
A rental fee to be entered by

Matthias Miller  21:53
I'm still saying It's overpaid.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
Let's just move It

Matthias Miller  22:40
would seem to me,

Unknown Speaker  23:05
361, 16,

Unknown Speaker  23:16
7801, I know what's wrong

Unknown Speaker  23:26
Now rental fee incurred.

Matthias Miller  23:39
One two,

Matthias Miller  23:52
for this in 27 months. The issue is that we should not be

Matthias Miller  24:15
problem is when we're calculating this number,

Matthias Miller  24:26
we're using the total, the raw total, the entry fees. We're not multiplying it by the rent, the whatever percentage it should be.

Unknown Speaker  24:51
No,

Matthias Miller  24:53
the effective value is not the full payment value. It's the value of the con. It's not the full.

Speaker 1  25:01
Uh, effective values out on the main screen, on the value right there, yeah, which minus the

Matthias Miller  25:11
total payments, which is going to be massively wrong.

Unknown Speaker  25:17
What? What?

Unknown Speaker  25:21
What value is it trying to return remaining months? What are we talking about?

Matthias Miller  25:28
Trying to come up with a monthly payment in the remaining months? Well, the remaining months is completely focused. Trying to calculate monthly payment. Monthly payment is just completely looks to me to be completely bogus.

Speaker 1  25:47
So monthly payments should be. What should it be? It should be, it should go back to your details. Are we? Are we talking about monthly subtotal plus tax, plus damage fee, like, that's the monthly payment is that? Is that what

Matthias Miller  26:01
we're I don't know what it's supposed to be, so go

Speaker 1  26:06
back to your details. It would seem like it should be that that total monthly payment should seem like the number that we should be having. No although that number in there looks awfully high.

Speaker 1  26:28
Where do they come up with the oh, that's the 417 where's it? Come with 417 what this is a, this is, this is a 60 month contract. Why is it so high?

Matthias Miller  26:41
Let's look at the divisor, 16.8 divisor.

Unknown Speaker  26:50
Well, that's, is that wrong?

Speaker 1  26:53
Oh, wait, this is a 24 month contract. I'm, I'm sorry, yeah, this that that would Yeah, what was, what was the 65546554, divided by 16.83 9011 390, 12. Yeah. Okay, never mind. I was looking at it wrong.

Matthias Miller  27:11
Okay, so I think with all I'm saying is this monthly payment, where

Unknown Speaker  27:16
does it get the 216 from? Oh, you're looking at something different now, sorry.

Speaker 1  27:32
Well, if you're, if you ask me on that contract details section, you should have, you should have the contract value, total contract value. You should have the balance. You should have the monthly payment remaining months, like that whole breakdown that I just had over in the in the contract report, that's what should be there. Like a mini, a mini breakdown of where this contract currently sits at you.

Matthias Miller  28:00
Okay, um, well, I think we can basically, I think what, I think, all we're saying is we can basically ignore that monthly payments in remaining months is completely bogus, and we can ignore

Speaker 1  28:15
it right now, well, for right now, but yes, at some point, like, very, very soon, we need to fix it. So that's right, but it it doesn't agree, it doesn't impede us for getting for the for what we're doing, is that,

Matthias Miller  28:25
Yeah, correct. So let me go ahead and good to run it. Think so. Now, is there ever a case in which

Speaker 1  28:37
we hit the hit, the hit, the transaction details on one of these. So this is what's going to happen on this guy. So he's going to cut off at 222, 22 okay.

Matthias Miller  29:02
Okay. So now we have early payoff. Now we need to go back into contract payment generator, and we need to handle, we need to handle early payoffs on

Speaker 1  29:23
those particular on those particular contracts

Matthias Miller  29:27
right well and yes on those particular contracts. So early payoff and early payoff amount calculator is definitely not working for

Matthias Miller  29:46
so the EPO would be.

Matthias Miller  30:00
Is it the rental fee percentage?

Speaker 1  30:10
Yeah, well, it's the cash price. It it's, it's contract, contract balance times

Unknown Speaker  30:19
cash price percentage,

Speaker 1  30:22
unless you want to go through another, unless you want to make more complex math and do it by the discount. I mean the the truth of the matter is, contract balance times the cash price. Discount is the number.

Matthias Miller  30:33
Can I take the contract about can I take the what we've paid times the cash price? Get at it that way, like the contract, effective value,

Unknown Speaker  31:01
not 100% not, not 100% sure. I'm tracking with what you're

Matthias Miller  31:10
saying is, is this the okay you would take the monthly payment, times the term length,

Matthias Miller  31:27
right?

Speaker 1  31:29
That would give you contract value or total value, yeah?

Matthias Miller  32:29
Great. Does that look right? It

Unknown Speaker  32:31
is. But don't we have a don't we have a contract balance? Macro?

Matthias Miller  32:35
No, a contract balance. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  32:38
Yeah, we do. I'm sure we do.

Speaker 1  32:44
Well, we might not, because if, if you go into my my fancy report, I'm doing the math inside of I'm doing, I think I'm doing the math inside of there somewhere to get to contract balance. But yes, that is, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  33:03
correct. Okay,

Matthias Miller  33:08
all right, so that gives us the EPO

Speaker 1  33:09
amount. Well, okay, contract balance. That's a little bit deceptive, because what about any outstanding rent? Are we going to account for that?

Matthias Miller  33:19
Well, that will have to go, oh, that's actually not true, right? We also need,

Unknown Speaker  33:42
oh, Goodness,

Matthias Miller  34:29
if it's incurred,

Speaker 1  34:55
when it be if contract type equals incurred and not forgiven.

Matthias Miller  35:04
Well CRA paid in

Matthias Miller  35:24
I hate this. Okay, so if it's

Matthias Miller  35:46
know paid always reduces it.

Matthias Miller  35:55
This feels wrong. I don't know this is right.

Matthias Miller  36:08
Because if you, if you paid a security deposit, It should reduce what you What you pay in

Unknown Speaker  37:02
a In

Speaker 1  37:04
we received it at the very, very beginning, but it does not. It's not received as revenue. It's held as a liability at the point that you want to enact it, it becomes revenue. I don't know how we account how are we accounting for that in in, in the transactions.

Speaker 1  37:35
Do we have, do we have a model for that in receiving money that's not revenue within the transactions itself well.

Matthias Miller  37:44
So what should happen, presumably, is that you reverse,

Speaker 1  37:55
do we have a type of of CRA and yeah, and security deposit, along with rental fees and rent with the late fees and rental fees and all Like, do we have a type for that? Yeah? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  38:27
But we're going to need something somewhere. I almost wonder if we need an early payoff.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
Type, type, I

Unknown Speaker  38:43
uh, well, it would

Unknown Speaker  38:47
be, would we also have a payout type? Then too,

Matthias Miller  38:51
not necessarily, because a payout is just standard rates, and you just pay off the zero.

Matthias Miller  39:19
Okay, so shouldn't EPO account for CRA and security deposit or no? Um,

Speaker 1  39:26
yeah, you would want, you would want to use those at the point of payoff.

Matthias Miller  39:52
Poor guy hasn't made any payments, so he was 19,000 for his i. Cost, curly, payoff,

Unknown Speaker  40:07
um,

Matthias Miller  41:25
Um, so then over here, oversteer.

Matthias Miller  42:43
Okay, so, so if it's if we do an early payoff around the last,

Matthias Miller  42:53
actually, what if we do this? This might actually, I'm sorry,

Unknown Speaker  43:02
I'm sorry. I feel very lost. I feel like I'm sitting here not saying anything or being helpful,

Matthias Miller  43:15
okay, On an early payoff. I

Matthias Miller  43:30
yeah, I feel like I'm

Matthias Miller  43:52
okay, we said we're going to be delinquent. What if we said that? For the sake of simplicity, early payoffs are never delinquent.

Speaker 1  44:09
Okay, I'm fine with that. I was, I was just about to suggest the very same thing, because here's, here's, we don't have to figure this out 100% we need to show what looks like working numbers. But at some point, post September, we're going to get into calculation review, and we're going to have to, we're going to dig through every calculation macro to make sure everything is calculating correctly. And probably have to probably use like and it might even be more useful once we upload real world data, so that we can get back and start comparing against RTO Pro and so forth. So, yeah, I agree with you. Let's, let's not worry about

Unknown Speaker  44:56
arrears for the moment. Right?

Matthias Miller  45:00
So

Matthias Miller  45:10
we're doing

Matthias Miller  46:09
so then the

Matthias Miller  46:15
can you treat the CRA as a security deposit for the sake of payment? I mean, it's you can, you can just use it towards, use it as straight cash, towards the early payoff.

Speaker 1  46:41
Do we have, do we have any that we're going to be paying off that have CRA S? Do we even need to worry about this?

Matthias Miller  47:02
What about do you want to handle retrievals?

Speaker 1  47:08
Well, I mean, we can go, I frankly, okay, so let's, let's not, let's. I

Speaker 1  47:20
kind of almost want to, like, do we really want for EPOS and some of these, something Do we really want to handle, handle one with a CRA in it?

Matthias Miller  47:30
Can we, well, how do you want to handle this specific one? Do you change the start date?

Unknown Speaker  47:36
Sure, let's, let's change the Start date so that it works.

Speaker 1  48:07
Okay, so let's, let's kick some of these hard conversations down the street because we don't have to handle them for the

Matthias Miller  48:18
demo. Okay, so then we don't have to handle

Matthias Miller  48:25
so here's security deposit, and then we need the actual payment.

Matthias Miller  49:40
If I'm. Okay, so then Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  51:01
I suppose, though, In that case, it would make sense to actually put this in here.

Unknown Speaker  52:07
What don't you like about me? I

Matthias Miller  52:55
right? Goodness, this is more painful than I would like.

Matthias Miller  53:33
Here we used,

Speaker 1  53:41
we pay in the case of 10,020 the one you're highlighted there, this would be the total amount of the EPO would be those three summed,

Matthias Miller  53:55
yes, about three grand.

Speaker 1  54:00
And that would be the amount that the payment record would reflect.

Matthias Miller  54:03
Then, presumably, if I did my math, right? Well,

Speaker 1  54:12
if somebody gets a calculator out to check your math at the demo, they can just not be a client.

Matthias Miller  54:22
Okay? I mean, maybe we can fairly easily figure out what it is.

Unknown Speaker  54:28
I'm just I'm just being snarky,

Matthias Miller  54:32
12, 803, 25 but we don't care about the unpaid balance. We just care about the uh,

Speaker 1  54:45
run, run. Your this this expression on 10,020 since we were looking

Unknown Speaker  54:51
at that one. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  55:04
Okay, does the monthly mother doesn't include dwf, though

Speaker 1  55:10
the the month any, if you're including any outstanding rent, it would include the dwf, but for the for, for the remaining, for the payoff. No,

Matthias Miller  55:29
we're off at 2528 that's the tax.

Matthias Miller  55:42
I They're not taking tax into account. No, that doesn't matter,

Matthias Miller  55:57
right? Because the last one is taxable, which is not reflected. I mean, this is this the pre tax total. So if we were to, this is the contract subtotal, yeah, okay, we're good.

Unknown Speaker  56:22
Okay,

Matthias Miller  56:24
and then for a payout. Yeah, it's nothing special now.

Speaker 1  56:31
It's just literally paying equal to the the last, yeah, whatever, whatever. All the terms are, all sorry, all the periods,

Matthias Miller  56:43
all right. Well, you want to crank

Speaker 1  56:46
scares me to death, but I think so. Why do we have some without a resolution?

Matthias Miller  56:51
Well, we're paying, we're we're adding payments for rental fees beyond just resolution.

Unknown Speaker  56:57
Oh, so you're doing also payments as well.

Unknown Speaker  57:02
So scroll down.

Speaker 1  57:05
Oh, okay, so you do have Okay? Part of me wants to be scared, but, you know, live a little hit the hit the go button.

Matthias Miller  57:16
Let's make sure we got it saved and like. All right, BUM BUM BUM BUM this is

Matthias Miller  57:38
going To make your accounting impact that much slower.

Unknown Speaker  57:58
Missing account, what

Unknown Speaker  58:09
is it missing? The account for?

Speaker 1  58:15
Well. Side note, no go ahead. No No go ahead. You think I'm gonna answer this phone. All right? I think.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:58
I'm back. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:06
when you Use something, you will debit. I

Matthias Miller  1:02:30
did not think about

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
No, I intentionally am not handling payments here. So when You do it, I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
the early payoff.

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
This place, comma, this is for transaction. Eight. What is this guy? 284, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
uh, sales, tax, payable, what am I missing?

Matthias Miller  1:04:41
Right? Because we are payments we don't we don't want to handle.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
Okay, fine.

Matthias Miller  1:05:06
Uh, contract, trans,

Speaker 1  1:05:11
well, it is, it is fun to go to barn, rental income on the on the P, L, and hit the ledger and see transactions all the way back to January.

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
Pretty sweet, huh? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:05:27
we're gonna have to, we have to make sure that before the before the show that the the record ID that that turns into a link to that you can directly jump to the record.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:39
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:05:42
This is number five. Let's see. Let's see what the EPO and it ends up looking

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
like somewhere you

Unknown Speaker  1:05:49
charged a convenience fee. Why is there a convenience fee? I have

Matthias Miller  1:05:52
one payment with a convenience fee.

Speaker 2  1:05:55
I see that. Just so you can have one show up. Just so you can have one show up. Yeah, I see that. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
Well, here's the All right, let's prank man,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:12
transactions gonna be flying.

Matthias Miller  1:06:15
Yeah, let's I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
so we're

Speaker 1  1:06:34
gonna, at some point we need to go run building purchases too, correct in order to

Matthias Miller  1:06:41
building purchases, I thought were in here. Oh, okay, no, you're right. The buildings,

Speaker 1  1:06:48
the products are in here. But I don't think we ever went through a purchasing process on it, have we? Because that that should be like buildings purchase, that there should be, that should be showing up on the P, L, as,

Matthias Miller  1:07:05
it is, as FDI or image as assets,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
sure, but

Speaker 1  1:07:17
shouldn't there should be something happening on the on the P L for that shouldn't there on the income statement?

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
No, it doesn't. There's nothing on the income statement. You're buying an asset. There's no expense.

Speaker 1  1:07:35
So what you're telling me is that the way that some of their income statements are over in QuickBooks is just wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:07:43
I don't know. What are you seeing as income on a building

Speaker 1  1:07:46
purchase, not income. Well, I mean, it would be expense. Well, I guess it wouldn't be an expense, depreciation. Expense will show up in the P, L, right, right.

Speaker 2  1:07:59
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, oh, I want

Speaker 1  1:08:09
to talk about some of these ledger reports at some point to see if we can make them more, more information just from the ledger itself.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
But that's not for right this moment. I

Speaker 1  1:08:56
4.17% that's gonna crank for a while, isn't it?

Matthias Miller  1:09:02
It's gonna take a minute.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:08
There's a reason that county gets up updated overnight, huh?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:13
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:19
I that.

Speaker 1  1:09:39
Wait they got they got the contact record in cards,

Speaker 1  1:09:50
who was busy, who was busy, who needs to be patted on the back. Hold on, I gotta drop a message here. Did Seth read your message? I can't tell

Speaker 2  1:10:09
Nope. At Seth, who do we need to pat on the back or doing what you said was not possible, that he is putting the

Speaker 1  1:10:55
the contact ID in brackets does that. That doesn't mean that it's memo, Link memo linkable. It does it.

Matthias Miller  1:11:06
No It needs a numeric prefix to be that. Okay. I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
Oh, man, this contact, Nick, uh,

Matthias Miller  1:11:53
should we get Jonathan and see if we can get Jonathan and Stefan to

Speaker 1  1:11:58
talk about, I have, I have eight minutes.

Matthias Miller  1:12:01
Oh, you have eight minutes. Okay. Oh, never mind.

Speaker 1  1:12:05
I would say this afternoon, if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, whatever you were going

Matthias Miller  1:12:09
to say early, making sure we're handling early payoffs, the way that we went. Or how do you want to handle? Go ahead you want to handle. Or a calculations, review, or something,

Speaker 1  1:12:20
well, calculations, all of that is going to be post like, That's October ish, so you

Matthias Miller  1:12:26
don't care if the contract shows bogus numbers when you pull it

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
up. What do you mean

Matthias Miller  1:12:38
that's a product like? Remaining months is completely wild.

Speaker 1  1:12:45
No, okay, so Okay, in fairness, yes, we should. We should talk about that this afternoon. That's a good point. Because not only I would, I would like to have in that, that contract details. I think it would be valuable to have con total contract value, contract balance, remaining months, early, cash, payoff, all of that stuff working correctly and there, yes, I

Matthias Miller  1:13:10
would agree. But that's different than effective value, which is because what you're proposing for contract value, that's like the payment times terms correct. So value.

Speaker 1  1:13:21
I mean, how do you I mean, whatever you want to call it total contract value,

Matthias Miller  1:13:26
total payments, huh, full term payments.

Speaker 1  1:13:30
So, monthly payments, monthly payments, plus plus sales tax

Speaker 2  1:13:37
for full term, full term payments, correct, times, times term I could

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
probably hop on with Seth and go over a few of these things, and we probably actually get some of this stuff resolved before then. Resolved before then. Well, it's up to you.

Speaker 1  1:14:04
I need to talk to Mark here in six minutes. Okay, actually, I should. I should probably drop off now, so that way I can, I can. This is that's going to crank for a while yet, correct,

Matthias Miller  1:14:15
it's going to crank for 10% so 30 minutes, probably, I don't know, awesome. Thank you

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
sir. What time this afternoon are we

Matthias Miller  1:14:27
two I think 232 3230.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
