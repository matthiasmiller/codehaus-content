Unknown Speaker  00:17
Ben Matthias

Matthias Miller  00:21
Merry Christmas.

Unknown Speaker  00:22
Merry Christmas,

Unknown Speaker  00:24
and Happy New Year

Unknown Speaker  00:25
and Happy New Year.

Unknown Speaker  00:28
And a just got off a call with

Matthias Miller  00:33
Michael with insight and happy epiphany as well. Epiphany the Amish call it the they call it old Christmas. But it's actually they actually hold the holiday much in the same way that they would like, you know, I guess keep the Sabbath except it's a Sunday but like they wouldn't have church services but I think some of them actually would have like a half day of fasting in the morning and strictly closed like no business kind of thing.

Speaker 1  01:09
Interesting. I didn't realize that took it. Quite that seriously.

Matthias Miller  01:16
That's tomorrow. I can't remember if I'm too far out of the loop to remember when they do their fasting days. I think it's like think good. Friday's another one. Anyway, that's tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  01:28
Interesting. Random Facts Yeah. Good Christmas. Yeah,

Speaker 2  01:48
it was pretty good. spent Christmas Eve with my fiance's side of the family. And then Christmas Day was my grandfather and my aunt came down to my parents. They live five minutes up the road, something like that. So they came over my sister and brother in law came over.

Unknown Speaker  02:09
And it was just, yeah, just kind of hanging out. Hanging out for the day. So yeah, good. Fun. Yeah. Tim, hello. Hey, if

Matthias Miller  02:25
you move back to Virginia, get your office back. Right. Since none of my Colorado incentives have worked, so, I guess at some point, I just got to try different different

Unknown Speaker  02:43
I mean, I'm all for you trying to convince him to move back to Virginia. Okay, let's double tee this

Unknown Speaker  02:54
all in good time? Yeah, that'd be cool. Is it big enough for both of us?

Speaker 3  03:09
The the one I was in last, well, actually, I was actually in three different spaces there. I started out in one

Unknown Speaker  03:16
that had like,

Speaker 3  03:18
built in desk like countertop height, with the big three workstations, I think built in there. But then that one was reserved for someone else. And so when they came moving in then

Unknown Speaker  03:33
then they how was it?

Speaker 3  03:36
The other big one was was also already occupied. They built a little they partitioned off a corner that I was in for a while. And then the second space big space came available. And then I moved in there.

Speaker 2  03:51
I think it's the little corner one that

Unknown Speaker  03:54
dad was saying was available.

Speaker 2  03:58
Okay, the one that like data joy from good life work there.

Speaker 3  04:05
She had Yeah, she was the one that came to came in to the one of the prebuilt desks and I was in first

Unknown Speaker  04:10
kit.

Speaker 2  04:14
I don't know if she's moved around at all, but it looks like it's a pretty small office. Right

Unknown Speaker  04:19
next to where she she is now. Okay,

Speaker 3  04:25
so yeah, then it's if it's that, then it's probably that one. The one that was partitioned off that I was in for six months, four months, six months?

Matthias Miller  04:35
Yeah. All I had said was the same space available to available that Tim used when he was here. So so one of three that's really helpful.

Speaker 3  04:46
One of three. Yeah. Because I someone sent one of the Golden Rule employees moved into the one that I was in last.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
I don't know.

Speaker 3  04:57
Like I'm driving down at some point they moved in there. So the little one that the second one I was in wouldn't be big enough for both of us.

Speaker 2  05:06
That's the one I was kind of gathering was the one that's available right now.

Unknown Speaker  05:12
Okay. Okay, well cool boy, we might have to. Oh,

Matthias Miller  05:25
works for now. nature abhors a vacuum so we might have to get a bigger one sooner rather than later. mates are Edwards vacuums, so you might get a bigger one sooner rather than later

Speaker 1  05:49
yeah, that wouldn't be. Yeah. Well, I just want to see but yeah, yeah. Maybe

Speaker 3  05:56
if it is that if it is a smaller one, which sounds like it is gonna be good to put in a plug in

Speaker 1  06:00
and say, Hey, can we have the

Speaker 3  06:06
one of the bigger ones as soon as as soon as it would come available? Thanks. Again line.

Unknown Speaker  06:11
One of the bigger ones.

Matthias Miller  06:12
Yeah. Well, I I talked him into a short term lease.

Unknown Speaker  06:16
Okay. Well as things shore up, we can. Yeah. Looks cool. Sure. So Sounds good.

Speaker 3  06:38
All right. Well, I think today would be we'll be looking at some things for the EBS in depth design. There Matthias there are various a few to do mm items for you in there. As well as some to do ch items. What else to do Tim TR items LSI we're going through. So probably first to go through search for the to do MMA gyms and get your feedback on those. And then depending where time is from there, then go to another two ch items. Some of those are things that I can knock out and I can knock out some time

Unknown Speaker  07:28
also require right? Okay, but

Matthias Miller  07:48
okay, is this actually to do mm? Or is this just a To Do When we give the final proposal we need to calculate our

Unknown Speaker  07:54
recoup or design recovery cost? Yeah, I think it's

Speaker 3  08:03
for it's informational for design recovery. And those I don't know, that's an exhaustive list of new features, new items, but there was some stuff that I started jotting down. And then I think Ellis put a to do mm on it. Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  08:19
I mean, you think you're

Matthias Miller  08:29
with any of this stuff in the whiskey side of things, or is this all in

Unknown Speaker  08:32
Hopwood prices

Speaker 3  08:43
would potentially no pop up prices isn't in the woods isn't in the yard app. target board feet is would be in the yard app.

Unknown Speaker  08:55
On the on the X Khalili side of

Speaker 3  09:00
things. It feels like there was something with the maybe not it might not have been intimidating.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Brand new with the artistic side of things.

Matthias Miller  09:19
Someday, we're going to build a giant room. And we're going to have on one wall. It's going to be like the data models with that show linking between the different record types. And then another wall is going to be all the mockups and it's going to be massive touchscreens and you can just tap and edit or and or drag, drag controls around and stuff like that will make it easier to keep these things on your head.

Unknown Speaker  09:55
But to get that right

Matthias Miller  10:00
We're going to have in Colorado where's that might be open for continue

Matthias Miller  10:21
okay but the log the yard tele logs is coming in from

Unknown Speaker  10:26
okay this is. Shouldn't say this okay it's supposed to be CCIE or LS CCI. I think you do CCI.

Speaker 3  12:47
So just to make sure I'm understanding your Is this the idea is that that everything would happen in the like a whole yard Italia would be created in the yard app. And then imported it'd be then set up in. In App hosting as an import. We went yeah. Setting up there's data

Unknown Speaker  13:11
well,

Matthias Miller  13:13
remains to be seen. I'm not exactly sure but either way well, if you do it all at one time, then it doesn't really matter.

Unknown Speaker  13:40
Still nice?

Matthias Miller  14:23
And sidenote, there are two ways that you would do this and the whiskey side we would the there's two mechanisms. One is using x 30. And there's also a, a an API call,

Unknown Speaker  14:39
which actually, this one actually is gonna be a JSON editor.

Matthias Miller  14:52
There's a data format where you would say basically let's pick

Unknown Speaker  14:55
a Contact recap

Matthias Miller  15:12
how to use Bill Franco will be mad if we don't use go Frank

Matthias Miller  15:21
I forget exactly how this is it's something like this.

Speaker 1  15:25
Oops. Then you say key expression equals I don't know this is a horrible key expression but then you would do etc.

Matthias Miller  16:06
So, fields get set like this and it's just, it's just machine readable format. And then for RGS you say what uniquely identifies RGS do not inherently have a row ID

Unknown Speaker  16:20
which

Matthias Miller  16:24
is a bit unfortunate, I think actually kind of nice to be dead but so you have to say how do I know which row to add or delete? In this case we're saying that line one address line one is how we uniquely identify rows

Unknown Speaker  16:40
and so

Matthias Miller  16:45
and if you want to delete it, you set it to null which deletes that row in this case we it's nice for us on the client side to know what the row ID is so that we can make edits and adjustments and or that we can after you save it.

Unknown Speaker  17:41
So then does

Speaker 3  17:42
it doesn't make things complicated one way or the other or one approach or the other for for editing tallies and COVID already been set up

Unknown Speaker  17:51
saved sorry what was that

Speaker 3  18:03
if it makes it if one approach or the other is easier or more complicated for editing tallies and already had been saved

Matthias Miller  18:16
yeah I think I think else's proposals here's about right

Unknown Speaker  18:19
okay

Matthias Miller  18:38
okay interactively the stutter incremented editable it must be specified by

Unknown Speaker  18:43
editable and must be specified by imports. Current Value actually, I think you could. Pair switch into my headset here. So you say so you're saying that, okay, and validate against duplicates, so this would be a bit is Texas and New York?

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Yep. Okay, yep, I'll plan to. Oh we don't need an ID in this case. I don't see why we couldn't use the tag number.

Speaker 3  20:59
Oh, sure. I guess maybe the drawback would be that the yard tally RG doesn't have tag numbers. So we'd be

Unknown Speaker  21:07
using two different that's fair. I don't know how much it matters. I

Matthias Miller  21:30
mean, what we end up doing is just

Unknown Speaker  21:36
just going to be branching anyway.

Matthias Miller  21:39
There's different fields that are shown. I mean, there's things that are similar, but there's different fields that are shown.

Matthias Miller  22:04
Well, this tag number change, though. Ah, that's the issue.

Unknown Speaker  22:10
Oh, yeah. Well, that was easy.

Speaker 3  22:23
And theoretically, you could have tag numbers on different records.

Speaker 1  22:34
But you could you could reuse the same tag number, you know, a year apart? Well, that's

Matthias Miller  22:42
not concerned about because well, it's still only done in the context of a single record.

Speaker 3  22:50
Oh, okay. So there will be other identification going through for that. So you say,

Matthias Miller  22:54
I mean, in this case here, actually, I didn't say this. We didn't say this. But in this case, for contact, let's let's pick a different would be a better example. Well, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  23:08
these are

Matthias Miller  23:10
okay, like for a for lookup record, you have to have a contact name. And you can't rename contact records from this API call. So you have to say this is Bill Frank. And that's how it looks it up for a building id num or a custom database level you would identify using using that and so this update is only within the context of that record. And so this key expression only has to be unique within

Unknown Speaker  23:41
that record. Okay, sure. Sure.

Matthias Miller  24:11
Alright, so that's the to do items.

Unknown Speaker  24:14
That was only two all right. Then maybe let's take a quick look at the to do ch items. Like I said, a lot of them would be for me.

Matthias Miller  24:45
You You're familiar with them you want to drive to do CH is And sure, find the ones that

Unknown Speaker  24:51
are So

Speaker 3  25:28
LS was talking about, maybe you talked to him about this about changing our approach to the permissions like we're we're talking about data access, menu visibility and stuff. Rather than saying it's visible for this user and this user, you say, it's visible for all users

Unknown Speaker  25:47
with permission. Does that you're Are you on board with that? Yeah. Really, what we're saying is,

Matthias Miller  26:00
we're introducing, in some ways, a layer of abstraction, we're

Unknown Speaker  26:04
saying.

Matthias Miller  26:07
We're saying rather than these broad role, let's define roles, these roles will have these permissions, which is the business case and then tactically speaking, what these permissions control for tactically breaking down the

Unknown Speaker  26:23
roles. Right. So

Speaker 3  26:29
so for the permissions, we had talked about how earlier we talked about how we only need permissions for things that aren't admin owned. Would that still be the case? If there's a record, that's admin, only would we still need to say permission for this?

Matthias Miller  26:47
No, we don't know. We would just say it's as well. Oh, well, let's see. Sorry, hang on. That's a good point. That was his comment was.

Matthias Miller  27:02
Okay, here's the question. Somebody says, No, we don't need permission controls, just admins and everybody else. The question is, do we believe them? Or do we say nope, you guys are crazy. You want permissions? Isn't that the basic question?

Unknown Speaker  27:23
Yeah, well, it would be. You're talking about like, for specific items. Yeah, like, unfortunately, when we Sorry.

Speaker 3  27:45
Okay, I'm just saying it gets complicated when you start, if you say all of this is available for admins, and there's only one thing that's available for non admins or something

Unknown Speaker  28:01
that seems like it's more complicated the more

Speaker 3  28:06
the more things you're trying to make available to other people. It seems like to me like unnecessary complexity to to have permission for every single thing and have you know, half of it

Speaker 1  28:23
the only only admins

Speaker 3  28:27
we end up with 30 permissions and only

Speaker 1  28:32
six of them are or not in order for people other than that, but that's just again from my perspective, I'm not sure where that all plays out. Realistically

Matthias Miller  28:48
Okay, well we could break this down into two missions

Unknown Speaker  28:56
well you're saying

Matthias Miller  29:08
only the admin can edit a closed your tally is that right?

Unknown Speaker  29:13
Right. View and Edit or no? Yeah, you want to be that view and as it is for tallies, yard tallies. Admins can edit and log buyers can view Okay, so I would actually change this to This is

Unknown Speaker  30:11
Matthias filling my screen this is not telepathy

Speaker 2  30:16
I sit here as I can see typing something on some other doc and Tim's copying it or

Unknown Speaker  30:22
yeah the control screen the control approval thing only shows up for me well I just lost there we go let's power for a second we can break it down to four permissions oh that these that's the but

Speaker 3  31:38
then I guess the thorough all the financial reports

Speaker 1  31:42
and things like that in certain sections on different records that that are only visible for admins would we need to put together permissions for all of those two okay, well for like you know like some of the stuff

Speaker 3  32:12
last call we were talking with Allison about like what what to use restricted data for and where to just use editability

Unknown Speaker  32:21
control the stuff

Speaker 3  32:23
with that also be would those things be determined by by permissions or would those be

Unknown Speaker  32:30
determined by the user group I mean user group can of course can reference all these different permission

Matthias Miller  32:58
This is not as tactical still not completely clear from the spec what it controls

Unknown Speaker  33:07
huh

Unknown Speaker  33:12
sure, that actually makes names

Matthias Miller  33:24
can you go through and clarify which permission to use for editing the visibility needs place

Matthias Miller  33:41
now you do lose some of the benefit

Unknown Speaker  33:44
of the granular control but this is only. Okay, the other way to do it So you can only

Matthias Miller  35:37
edit open if you can view all you can only edit all if you can edit open but then in the spec you only need to reference you know, to permission to view all your Tality tallies use your permission edit open Edit All

Speaker 1  35:51
right do we only need to reference the most advanced one that applies to that? Right? Exactly the most restrictive restrictive right or whatever

Speaker 3  36:13
if you find it financial view and edit your Italys edit closed your Italys expertize and bookings

Speaker 1  36:21
I see you have a second the second batch there first

Matthias Miller  36:29
Can we just call them x no that's the experts confusing

Unknown Speaker  36:35
we're gonna say expert tallies and bookie

Unknown Speaker  36:38
although expert tells him but you almost need to be

Unknown Speaker  36:43
the status is our might be fine to combine them.

Matthias Miller  36:52
Can we I mean is there a word that we can use at pending edit

Unknown Speaker  37:05
I'd have to look at the sad list of statuses there. I think we use

Speaker 1  37:09
open and incomplete or something like that booking Holly, or the booking record

Unknown Speaker  37:21
yeah ready for invoicing close

Matthias Miller  37:29
Okay, export tally is opened

Unknown Speaker  37:34
or confirmed hope it was open

Unknown Speaker  37:40
closed

Unknown Speaker  37:41
Oh loaded or closed open confirmed loaded closed for the export Tality. And then you go back to the booking and scroll down to where it talks about the permissions there. Oops data access

Unknown Speaker  38:28
closed well okay,

Speaker 1  38:30
we could say oh, no, there's ready for invoicing to 2d to just mention here that was added later actually Yeah, could you put it to do Tr in there to to with the data access check out the first include the ready for invoicing? So it looks like we could

Speaker 3  39:25
combine it and say open confirm such confirmed export tallies and

Unknown Speaker  39:31
bookings. And then

Matthias Miller  39:47
oh, you're gonna make that change. It's giving me grief on

Unknown Speaker  39:51
tallies. I guess the only concern would be whether

Speaker 3  40:39
whether it's better to go ahead and spec out the separate whether this is good enough is good enough long term or if it's safer just go ahead and do separate a separate set of permission for booking

Speaker 1  40:52
and protect mortalities I mean to be honest that it actually ends up feeling simpler to have expert tallies

Unknown Speaker  41:04
I know it's more permissions but yeah it seems like make it simpler so so it would just be mortality that Sally's like that yeah and then you could note that actually if you

Matthias Miller  42:27
wanted to go to the work you can make this be a table and then you'd have administrator log buyer export scalar and loader and you could check the boxes

Unknown Speaker  42:37
for who gets what and just indicate that at least in the dev

Matthias Miller  42:47
spec that will create user groups in the live system

Unknown Speaker  42:51
to reflect this mm hmm then so

Speaker 3  43:19
with with think EEG we realized that we don't we don't ship the user groups

Speaker 1  43:31
so we would just need we need to make sure we get this all set up Yeah, we could do this part of deployment

Speaker 3  44:01
Okay, should you and edit financials be separate as well so we have you and then edit a separate unless

Matthias Miller  44:09
it's actually not unless it's actually needed

Unknown Speaker  44:12
okay okay, I

Matthias Miller  44:23
mean, technically you could merge view all in Edit open. But at that point, once again, you start getting into

Speaker 1  44:35
like, stills like it gets increasingly muddy. Like

Matthias Miller  44:45
it's actually simpler to have more items, I think, but

Unknown Speaker  44:47
I don't know. Yeah, you're right. Okay,

Speaker 3  45:16
This one here so we, as far as talking about the miscellaneous species

Unknown Speaker  45:23
elephant, I really liked the idea of having

Speaker 3  45:28
a few miscellaneous species each have their own pricing.

Speaker 1  45:35
Do you have thoughts on that? From a design standpoint,

Speaker 3  45:38
you'd mentioned handling it similar to doing the near pricing, I think we'd have to do a separate pricing model.

Speaker 1  45:47
Similar to veneer, I don't think veneer would go low enough. But I could ask a little weird to us to use linear pricing for

Matthias Miller  45:59
see us miscellaneous cheap but you'd still use them in your grade on the cheap

Speaker 3  46:07
or you just have no it was still because they would be set up the same way. It would just be set up as it was set up the same way as as like the weight of material

Speaker 1  46:18
with its own pricing table Great. Grading I mean nothing special about it. I don't really care. Okay.

Matthias Miller  46:32
It's not that different than saying, Oh, we have this uncommonly used harvest mahogany once every 100 years in Pennsylvania

Unknown Speaker  46:47
it is not going to grow in Pennsylvania. I've no 80 workers. It's like Central America South America because maybe Africa to tropical. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:18
I mean, but I think that ends up being up to them. They can either Yeah, just know that this grade is starts here. I mean, this doesn't really require any kind of special coding, right?

Speaker 3  47:29
Unless we would do unless we would mimic the the New Year pricing have a have a third pricing model where we'd have the standard pricing model and veneer and

Matthias Miller  47:40
because it would be modeled after the veneer right? Because the veneer is actually right. Right. Right. Right, right. No, I get it. That makes sense. But they could price it in such a way that grade you know grade one means it correlates to one something grade two correlates to to something grade.

Speaker 1  47:59
Maybe they don't want that either. Nevermind. Okay, well, you find out with the client

Speaker 3  48:08
All right, here's another tch the your input

Unknown Speaker  48:12
email that's right here oh, you know what? No, that's actually looking at that. No problem there. We've we've added that actually Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess do you have feedback

Speaker 3  49:02
on this? Or explanation this? What do you mean by openness by default?

Unknown Speaker  49:10
Maybe you put this in here? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  49:13
I mean, it's basically the idea of what's the right level of security for your building?

Unknown Speaker  49:21
Your house? Well, okay.

Matthias Miller  49:29
I mean, everybody knows that locks can be picked and yet, the time a burglar spends picking the lock, usually is enough of a deterrent.

Unknown Speaker  49:40
That, you know, don't bother.

Matthias Miller  49:46
Now, when do you use a safe? Well, if you've got lots of cash sitting somewhere we depart from fire. Let's just consider burglary. And the stakes are high, then yeah, that's when Do you have a safe when do you use you know concrete walls with burglar bars on them with you know chain link fence and razor wire and electric current

Unknown Speaker  50:13
well you do that when you've got you do

Matthias Miller  50:21
that when you're five few miles away from the biases office and you want to make sure that these people don't get out and do stuff to Matthias

Unknown Speaker  50:29
Thank you very much so

Matthias Miller  50:36
I think the same principle applies and it's more expensive to do razor wire and you know 23 hour lock downs and things like that than it is to

Unknown Speaker  50:47
install locks and your doors

Matthias Miller  50:51
so what's the you know, where does this analogy take us? Well restricted data is getting close to some form of razor wire electrical and concrete walls and

Unknown Speaker  51:04
bars on Windows

Matthias Miller  51:07
doesn't mean it's not wrong

Unknown Speaker  51:15
but it can be you can

Matthias Miller  51:19
but it introduces complexities and if there's a lower level of

Speaker 1  51:29
security restriction that's workable then

Matthias Miller  51:37
let's go for the least restrictive mean some of it is a cost benefit payoff but let's go with it

Unknown Speaker  51:43
as a matter of principle

Matthias Miller  51:46
let's go for the least restrictive option that we have that

Unknown Speaker  51:52
gives us what we gives us whatever protection we need. Sure, would this be something to put in the CSS training or the design guideline Yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:43
I think it's something that would be good to include there

Matthias Miller  52:53
we actually have a section that talks about

Unknown Speaker  52:54
stricter data and permissions.

Matthias Miller  54:31
Name is I have some of this stuff so ingrained in me of like all the stuff we get for investor tools, especially when you're coding at a platform level. You're critically thinking about ways that could people could

Speaker 1  54:45
abuse access and

Matthias Miller  55:25
Actually, the criminal concept isn't a bad concept. If, if you have non tech savvy users,

Unknown Speaker  55:35
then you can

Matthias Miller  55:40
then then you can restrict access to reports and the expression evaluator report editing and expression evaluator, they won't care. And technically, they could probably figure out a way somehow to get it. But it's going to be so difficult. It's, again, it's the burglar thing, like who's going to spend 10 minutes on a busy street, trying to pick a lock unless it's, you know, in most areas of the world. But if you have somebody who is highly knowledgeable, and can write their own reports, in their own expressions, think of Dwayne as an example. If for some reason course, Dwayne's an administrator, but if Dwayne with Burkholder, management has to get access to you know, should be prevented from seeing something, then we would have to use restricted data for him because he has the know how on the Curiosity going to doubt, I mean, it's kind of a silly example. But the point being a savvy user.

Unknown Speaker  56:44
Yeah, I really liked the idea of having having

Unknown Speaker  56:52
what's the word? Some defaults for this? Go?

Speaker 3  56:59
I don't know, do we just by default, whatever the simplest way, is, have some defaults on this. Well,

Matthias Miller  57:09
I think there's one determiner, when

Speaker 1  57:12
construction company you have your standard

Speaker 3  57:16
house package comes with this great blocks all the way around. And then

Speaker 1  57:22
if you want to go up from there, then that's an upgrade. And you have certain options.

Speaker 3  57:29
Like what? Yeah, what does it look like to standardize some of that stuff? And how we document I mean, we're doing that with these permissions that are proposed

Unknown Speaker  57:37
permission. But yeah, and I think

Matthias Miller  57:42
even even in construction

Matthias Miller  57:57
well, I'll pick sheds, because that's an example. I know. You know, they, they do sell burglar bars as an upgrade in the actually true to form. They custom designed their own and I think custom manufactured. And, and so what you need, I think, I think sophistication of users is actually a really good metric for what approach you should use, if you're protecting from unsophisticated users.

Unknown Speaker  58:34
Then well, okay,

Matthias Miller  58:40
sorry. Now, we're just straight up overthinking it. Then there's the whole thing of you have unsophisticated users who have poor password security, and you have a malicious third party who uses their account

Unknown Speaker  58:51
to gain access. But that's,

Matthias Miller  58:55
yeah, we're not in the cybersecurity. We don't want our people to do do anything stupid, but we're also not

Unknown Speaker  59:06
cybersecurity consultants. That would be the equivalent of somebody,

Matthias Miller  59:23
somebody's a pickpocket or you dropped your key and somebody walks into your house at some point, it's not the builders responsibility that you couldn't keep your kids safe.

Matthias Miller  59:42
I put a section down at the bottom which makes me more sense

Unknown Speaker  59:45
top Costco Costco Yeah. For sure. Yes actually yes media a year

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
after giving an overview of what?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
Okay sentences while

Speaker 3  1:01:08
it's useless there's no inherent requirement. The restrictions vary

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
by user

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22
what does this mean here while it's useless?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
There's no inherent environment. Okay, this is

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
the stupidest thing in the world. I don't even know why I include the sentence more than just a little technical side of my brain that goes wonky, sometimes you can, you can create a restricted data rule that says that if a contact is inactive,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:43
it's restricted. Ah, gotcha. Easter egg,

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
you could, you could say that, I'm not sure how this would work. But you could conceivably say that the inactive contact records are only visible from three to five on Tuesday. Now, we might have caching issues with that because we might cache restricted data visibility.

Speaker 1  1:02:12
So I'm not sure what would happen but conceivably, that'd be possible Hmm Interesting.

Matthias Miller  1:02:27
So it might actually be

Unknown Speaker  1:02:29
I don't know if that's even worth including there

Matthias Miller  1:02:42
might be something that might be better to put in the archive notes and that confused

Unknown Speaker  1:02:47
sure okay cool. So we've got that documented

Speaker 3  1:03:08
alright, and because you were wanting your thing it'd be nice to wrap up early. No, nothing

Matthias Miller  1:03:14
I can't think next week. So I've got Oh, okay. I've got as long as you guys want to go I got another your

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
hour if you guys actually want to. Okay I probably

Speaker 3  1:03:43
Yeah, probably a lot of this stuff was just the the rest of the stuff here would be mainly for for us to go through and do what we can and then you end with questions

Speaker 1  1:03:55
later. A lot of the stuff that's left is stuff that we can work on and then you take your your time just to work on it so we probably do that and then just plan to follow up some other time with next week, I believe next call or works for questions and actually, would want to also get an Austin in another call students are these again, some of them were following up on it so it would be big things we haven't done yet. So I see about Thursday for that

Speaker 3  1:04:47
Yeah, I think I think we're probably be good to go with wrapping up now.

Speaker 1  1:04:52
And then I can work on. On our side of things here at some point and work from there. Okay, sounds good. Appreciate it. All right, anything else from your view? At the moment

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
all right, well, then we'll plan to

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
work next time. Awesome. Cool. Thanks.
