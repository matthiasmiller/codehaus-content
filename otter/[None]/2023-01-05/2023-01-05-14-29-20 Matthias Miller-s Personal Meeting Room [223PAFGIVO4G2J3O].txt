Unknown Speaker  00:03
That was I was weird. That was weird. Property is defined in the UTC format the property indicates that the instance of the instance was created. Oh, I think that's this is actually okay. So this would be let me again with this one is why why now I think I can actually do this don't we get the current user? Current? Insert user? No, I mean,

Speaker 1  02:02
but I mean you can you can you just use current user isn't current user go back hit hit your search. It's just current user, isn't it or current active now? I don't know. Hang on. I'll tell you what it is

Unknown Speaker  02:22
start user name user name,

Matthias Miller  02:42
that's the current username. I've got it here. I get the full full name and the user profile it's good enough

Unknown Speaker  03:16
this is

Matthias Miller  03:18
a fun time time is seconds since midnight. So it's nine times that's minutes.

Speaker 1  03:25
I love when people start picking this stuff up. But I added it and didn't even tell a person that I'd add it and she's like, Oh, I love it. I like the way you're filtering this stuff out. And I'm like, Well, you can pop it open and filter back stuff back. Oh, yeah, I already figured it out. That's awesome. I love it I could just duplicate her sir CIRAD it's more sales lots. I mean, the amount of

Unknown Speaker  04:49
energy. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  04:54
And then the amount of stuff that we actually need to push across then to as a like, we don't have to do much To mean probably still in customer name or something like that

Unknown Speaker  05:08
building Loke builders hey we then scheduled date Hey so then we have here I think I need to Z on the end of today

Unknown Speaker  05:58
yeah do this little stuff is all together and you can actually see okay what should the summary be

Speaker 1  07:06
summary of why the event summary of the event? So, are you thinking well okay so probably how much information am I limited on the amount of information I should be able to see when you say summary like when you say summary are you talking about like details?

Unknown Speaker  07:30
I'm thinking

Matthias Miller  07:33
well we can do a summary and a description

Speaker 1  07:36
okay, description sure we can get a lot more so this would be like what shows up on like if you're not in the actual calendar event right is that right like out on the front probably probably probably boy if we could get stin size and customer name so shipping name and ship so shipping name is blank then use building target dealer or something like that

Speaker 2  08:21
you said building Stan yeah let's size

Speaker 1  08:26
yeah just building site yeah building size and then I would say probably I want to if it's a customer building that word has a so shipping name then let's use the so shipping name if it's if it's a lot building and then we would use building target dealer names

Unknown Speaker  08:49
actually, is there a macro that you have for this for we have building load desk

Matthias Miller  09:15
when we do that.

Speaker 1  09:16
Well there you go. That's perfect. Well, that's kind of just give me an address isn't it? Isn't that just an address?

Unknown Speaker  09:24
No

Matthias Miller  09:28
it's the shipping name if it's a customer otherwise

Unknown Speaker  09:30
yeah

Unknown Speaker  09:37
okay, so then we'll do

Speaker 1  09:42
yes in size and customer name or dealer would be perfect. Are you still went well, I mean, that no, that is that is that is the description. Yeah, that's perfect.

Unknown Speaker  09:55
This is not the student size.

Speaker 1  10:01
Oh yeah I thought you had that in from before you were concatenating that before

Matthias Miller  10:08
I had been back out okay so let's do a gracious let's left align this silly thing and let's

Unknown Speaker  10:13
put this one in the menu I said UID is why

Unknown Speaker  10:29
somehow we're gonna have to denote haulers fit

Unknown Speaker  10:34
Why is the time blank not scheduled

Speaker 1  10:48
Can you refine Can you refine the push based on whether it's confirmed or not?

Unknown Speaker  10:55
Sure okay with this one says it's confirmed we have something that's confirmed scheduled date other something goofy with a scheduled event. Billing schedule deals find out what's up with the scheduled date

Unknown Speaker  11:20
GMT date from local minutes hours oh well probably you'd have to feed back off a little bit on the multiplying Okay, and what did you want in the description

Speaker 1  11:41
description Hang on a second. Let me go see here. Well, you know what, some of this you should pull from the hauler Service report because that's where you're going to have a lot of similar information but should cancel that you would I would want the in the description stin customer sales rep who the builder is there you know Okay, so no okay if we're just looking at this from a very simple standpoint to envision who it is in the description. I need the hauler the stin the building cap description

Speaker 2  12:36
the scheduled date the Haller What do you need to schedule de Damiano no building low collar okay what else might I want over the shoulder?

Unknown Speaker  12:56
Yes

Matthias Miller  13:05
there's a code description that doesn't have any new lines and it doesn't know

Speaker 1  13:11
Yeah, it just it just concatenates a whole bunch of stuff together. Austin kept description Haller builder Yeah, because the rest is in the summary

Unknown Speaker  13:40
Do you want to share in logistics where

Unknown Speaker  13:44
I put it in testing right now?

Unknown Speaker  14:11
You told me this is gonna work Sure. Does that ever stop me

Unknown Speaker  14:24
I don't know. I I'm curious how this is going to work.

Unknown Speaker  14:33
Okay, building that isn't going to work. Oh, are we gonna do that? Maybe I can do a preface cuz I'm lazy stupid way to do this

Unknown Speaker  15:22
that was funny I know exactly what you did

Unknown Speaker  15:27
okay that will okay this is going to work this one not sure why this isn't actually didn't work

Matthias Miller  15:42
exactly like that which doesn't make sense to me but

Unknown Speaker  15:45
we're going to run this again now Do you have a calendar you want to pollute with these? What?

Speaker 1  16:01
What what calendar are you using? What's it for

Matthias Miller  16:05
me you can import it onto Google Calendar or you can put it in

Unknown Speaker  16:08
your Outlook I mean it's a universal

Speaker 1  16:12
okay let me think let me think what is this one right here? Who are you?

Unknown Speaker  16:22
Who are you?

Speaker 1  16:25
Oh yeah, let's use that Berman. Let's use Dwayne that Berman CEO at Gmail

Speaker 2  16:31
well how about you take it take it take it away.

Unknown Speaker  16:38
i Where's the calendar thing come on

Unknown Speaker  16:41
All right. All right. All right. What I do with this now All right, I got that

Speaker 1  16:54
email address does not match existing is Oh of course not.

Unknown Speaker  17:00
Yeah, I know that stop it all right. All right.

Matthias Miller  17:05
I wonder if I can override the export file names that actually exports an ICS

Unknown Speaker  17:11
that'd be really awesome. Output file

Unknown Speaker  17:18
what on earth are you doing? Stop it Okay, fine. I'll drop you in here days till Bill 11 Continue All right, what I do with this txt file

Unknown Speaker  17:41
so you go to Georgia your screen so I can watch you ah,

Speaker 1  17:59
you know what? You're just gonna get the whole entire screen for now and I'm gonna get you okay, you went away. Alright, so there's my file obviously can you

Matthias Miller  18:09
rename it to that rename it to that ICS

Unknown Speaker  18:20
now pull up your Google calendar that's not what I wanted to do I want to go here I can I get from here and

Unknown Speaker  18:39
then now you decided to be slow Come on Okay, hit the Settings icon, the gear settings somewhere there's an import important export. Select File, select computer it's your ICS words Okay, well

Matthias Miller  19:24
let's try this. You know, I probably screwed something up somewhere. I know this is shocking, but it might have happened

Unknown Speaker  19:33
shocking I'm sure.

Unknown Speaker  19:39
Files upload this. Well, the maximum file size exceeded well, you will make our friends

Unknown Speaker  19:52
haven't heard that one in a while. Is

Matthias Miller  19:56
is my favorite nickname for a three year old and it perfectly fits. The shoe fits

Unknown Speaker  20:03
better believe it I'm using it Alright, so again the event we're going to do and

Speaker 1  20:16
why in the why in the in the TXT file we have Why is there an N? Oh it's in front of each one of the okay nevermind nevermind newline nevermind a line

Matthias Miller  20:27
length should not be longer than 75 characters

Unknown Speaker  20:30
okay was the only thing it's complaining about there we had like your ad is not unique oh that's why now remains to be seen right can you do your job

Matthias Miller  22:12
deleting the data be snarky

Unknown Speaker  22:14
never date start. Line 31 We have a blank date in there date start date end is giving me a blank stare team 3817 Hey, wow sounds like that should be solvable screen report also none of my favorite quotes with my kids their problems? Is it solvable? No,

Matthias Miller  22:54
it's okay why would it be confirmed and not have a scheduled date

Unknown Speaker  23:08
these are the questions we ask sometimes.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
Okay, well I'm just going to exclude it if it doesn't have one.

Unknown Speaker  23:15
If you don't have both

Speaker 2  23:17
Yeah, yeah. Run run the report. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:36
Can I run it? Well,

Matthias Miller  23:37
no, hang on I'm I'm running it through a validator right now.

Unknown Speaker  23:41
Okay. At least whatever I can have it under it's finding some problems and the calendar should no longer

Speaker 1  24:26
wait, could this thing be set up the bump from from the from the API and it automatically grabs this stuff?

Matthias Miller  24:34
You mean to update it via automatically the ICS? Yeah. Probably, uh, let them know that you want to push the whole thing over every time. I mean, the whole exporter every time but you could. Okay, you can rerun it and see what you got.

Unknown Speaker  24:55
I was hoping you figured out the Rename thing. Can't

Matthias Miller  24:59
do But I can put it in the notes there for you

Unknown Speaker  25:04
hmm I see this

Matthias Miller  25:11
yes yes you become unstable

Speaker 1  25:13
well I've seen now there wow that would be exactly what we're looking for something unstable

Speaker 2  25:19
seen people like that I thought I renamed you yeah that one. Oh no it's hung up on something no kidding the preview probably has given it grief I don't know what it is fun fact

Matthias Miller  25:50
the lines in the export file are supposed to be limited to 71 characters presumably because it was intended to be parsed by really old computers and you didn't want to have an arbitrary unknown length of

Unknown Speaker  26:01
content I don't really know for sure Oh, what is happening all right, trying to think again. Unable to process

Matthias Miller  26:37
okay, well let me try to

Unknown Speaker  26:39
well, what should I try

Unknown Speaker  26:44
yeah, one more try and then we're going to call it a bridge too far

Matthias Miller  26:48
we're pretty close

Speaker 1  26:51
yeah, but so well, okay, let's let's get something that actually works and then we'll talk about the functionality of it

Speaker 2  27:09
Hey Max file size is 512 Okay. Why would they why would they max file size is what half a Meg and we're over half a meg did not have any errors let's try

Matthias Miller  28:19
Okay, the only thing that's complaining about his line length that's the only thing I need to fix.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
So let's go back to here is my x board Oh, I have an idea. Since Genki is saying that it's going to work jank is hanging

Unknown Speaker  29:18
it's par for the course for us

Unknown Speaker  29:37
this one this guy up weighs down maximum validator specification blank line found technically 2442 downloads Come on. Once you have a new line here we go okay

Matthias Miller  33:35
you try running it one more time if this doesn't do it I don't know what

Unknown Speaker  33:40
I would know what's wrong with it no not that calendar

Matthias Miller  34:46
important you're right import an expert

Unknown Speaker  34:48
yeah sorry I was

Unknown Speaker  34:51
good But

Matthias Miller  35:09
it says it's valid I wouldn't know without breaking it down into smaller pieces and saying hey, does it work with this one? Is it just the size issue just now if you literally want to push it across real time then we're looking at

Unknown Speaker  35:25
something else but

Speaker 1  35:27
well, and you know what? Here's the logistics rework has come in some will get Shashi Loida figured out some fancy something rather.

Unknown Speaker  35:40
Baby. Sounds busy. All right, sir. Cool. Awesome. Thank you, sir. You bet.
