Speaker 1  00:15
Good to meet you. I think I might know where you are. Where are you today? Let's see. Are you just down the street at the coffee shop? Nope. Where are you?

Matthias Miller  00:28
You're gonna be getting them while

Unknown Speaker  00:30
I'm here and then just tell me.

Matthias Miller  00:31
I'm up in the springs.

Unknown Speaker  00:34
Ah, what? Which coffee shop?

Matthias Miller  00:37
It's a co working space.

Unknown Speaker  00:40
Okay. It's called the wolf den. And the wolf den. Fascinating. Yeah, man.

Speaker 1  00:53
You, you just like to get around to change your space up to find, unless you're going to tell me that you were in the springs for another reason.

Matthias Miller  01:02
I was my brother's in town. So it's worth it's worth the drive to say hi. Anyway

Speaker 1  01:15
in other words, it wasn't worth it boy, oh boy. Let's see. Where's my weekly commission sheet? Oh, fun. Let's have some fun on this one. Because every single time I think I've got the web direction we're going to do these commissions. We decided to change it. So we need So in true insight fashion, we need loads of flexibility.

Unknown Speaker  01:53
We think we need let's be honest. Yeah, yeah

Unknown Speaker  02:06
we pull up a Google Doc that we can

Matthias Miller  02:33
all right, so you want to walk me through the spreadsheet or where you want to start?

Speaker 1  02:38
And then there's gonna be a ton of value in the spreadsheet. Because

Speaker 1  02:54
yeah, there's probably value in the spreadsheet. Yeah, okay. What I want to do is share this with you. Probably share it with you. Yeah. Sure.

Matthias Miller  03:08
A random question is Kyle summers running your Facebook? Yeah, why? I folks out here been chatting to him. He came in promising big results. So we'll see if we can get dialed in

Speaker 1  03:33
I'm gonna, I'm gonna turn off marketing completely for a while and see what happens. You know, kind of like if you decide to stop eating for a while. Let's see what happens. Yeah, when did I lose weight? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  03:53
We should have like an Atkins for business. And what? Atkins for business?

Speaker 1  04:00
Now, I was thinking more like what was that? What was that all meat diet for? What was that I was at?

Matthias Miller  04:07
I don't know. There's a there's a carnivore thing.

Unknown Speaker  04:12
You're familiar with Jordan Peterson. Right?

Unknown Speaker  04:13
Yeah.

Speaker 1  04:15
Have you ever heard the diet that he did for quite a while? Straight meat? Yeah. Well, no, it's just beef like beef and salt. That's it.

Matthias Miller  04:23
You consult?

Speaker 1  04:27
Yeah, it would be extremely expensive to wow, you would just ruin beef forever. Never eat a steak the same way again. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:38
There's not a lot of variation in that. Probably probably asked by neighbors if they could have a few more cows on their little three quarter acre lot. acre lot.

Speaker 1  04:52
Alright, let's get into this thing cuz we're gonna have plenty of weeds to get through.

Matthias Miller  04:57
You got it open. So big, big pigs. request. Oh, you share it with me. Yeah. So what you're saying

Unknown Speaker  05:04
is what I'm saying? What's the big picture? Question?

Matthias Miller  05:08
Do we know? Okay, is there a higher one this model? Yeah.

Speaker 1  05:13
Well, okay, there's a lot of variations of the model. That being said, 90 something percent are we're kind of all doing the same thing. So really, really, let's, let's encapsulate the easy ones first. Obviously, the easiest ones are straight commission 10%. Commission. That's really straightforward. Now, the key that I think we need to talk through a little bit is we, the, we need a way to input payments so that we can all work always calculate against what was already paid. So if we're, if you're, if sales are coming in and something gets cancelled, and we already paid out the Commission, we want that to roll, you know, basically out of what we've already paid,

Matthias Miller  06:04
or you fix the commission structure, or who knows what happens. So

Speaker 1  06:10
currently the way okay, you have my you have that sheet up. Yeah. So let's go. Let's go look at for a straight commission conversation. Let's go look at Virginia sheds. Now. This is going to bring some fun conversation, because we have this commission dealer whenever there was straight commission. can I simplify this one? Yes, I did. So this one is basically a calculated commission and an adjusted Commission, the adjusted commission column is based on the what was paid. And now the secondary piece to this, and this is, I would love if we figured out how to do this. But in in this individual's case, as a straight commission dealer. There is some variation of discounts being deducted from their commission, because they're a straight commission dealer, they're an independent dealer, if they decide to give it a discount, there is some variation, and usually it's by a percentage of the discount, either from 100% to 50%. And all of that really would be awesome if we looked at the discounts that were as a part of the sales for this individual. And it just automatically calculated

Unknown Speaker  07:30
for all discounts for

Unknown Speaker  07:33
this for this individual.

Matthias Miller  07:36
But all discounts for this individual. What

Speaker 1  07:38
I'm saying as whenever we would set let's Okay, hypothetically, let's say we we encapsulate this information, kind of like on the in the payroll module, we encapsulate as part of the compensation method on the the employee record, probably compensation, compensation method, RG type thing on the on the sales rep record,

Matthias Miller  08:00
I'm just trying to clarify how this works. So the way this works is, they never give a discount that they don't get penalized for, right?

Speaker 1  08:09
Unless it's been approved. So in other words, ya know, there are times, okay, here's a prime example. So we they wanted access, they wanted to have the capability to sell some of this old inventory that we're pulling off of sheds direct lots that has an approved discount already established into it. But we don't want to pre discount the building, because we want them to be able to say to the customer, hey, this building here 10% off, oh, you don't want to buy for 10%? Fine, I'll go down to 15% Oh, you still don't want to buy? Okay, fine, we'll get down to 20%. Like they have a range that they can work with, which normally gets communicated on on the building record. And there's a janky way to do it. But that's not part of this conversation at the moment. But that being said, as a normal, let's talk about normal flow of information on a straight commission dealer. If they if it's a straight if they're an independent straight commission dealer than any discount they would be they would give to their customer would be deducted from their commission.

Matthias Miller  09:18
Great. So if they have an 11% Commission, they give a 5% discount they get 6%. Commission on that sale. So why don't we have building specific kind of like your labor intensive building adjustments, but building specific commission adjustments stored on the sales order? We want it to be we want it to be one off. We don't we don't operationally we hate these types of things. They're just obnoxious. And so too, in light of that anytime And we create an exception for this type of stuff. You go on the sales order, and you say, Okay, there's a commission, there's a commission adjustment, the discount amount was $700, they should get that $700. Commission.

Speaker 1  10:18
Yeah, so here's how I've been handling it. It's been there is, it's been handled as part of. So in the spreadsheet here, we say, here's what we paid them, here's no sorry. In their case, here's what the commission should be. Here's the adjusted based on historical payments. And when you get to a final line item in the top right hand corner of the what's being paid out, there's a discount deductions field that just does a manual deduction of the commission amount, we're not storing in any way, or we're not saying here's what happened. Like, it's just it's all completely manual. And part of me wants to say, because it okay. In the case where there's approved and not approved discounts, in other words, we say you can sell this building up to 2020, up to 20%. And you sell within that 20%, great, you get your full commission on whatever the building sale was, versus, I have a brand new build, I want to get my I want to close this deal. I give them a 3% Whatever discount that would then get deducted. So part of me says we should we should we pay it and just store it as part of a payment record? Or should we actually like, try to auto calculate it auto store it come up with some fancy way to identify it? And all that good

Matthias Miller  11:44
stuff? out of 1000 buildings? How many of these do you have these types of? Okay, I understand the straight commission, you pay your on discount, I get that. But out of out of 1000 buildings, how many of them are no, we'll cover that discount for you.

Speaker 1  12:10
Only percent I mean, 1000s of big numbers. So I'm just I'm adjusting let's, let's say let's out of 100 buildings. 20 of them probably 20 percentage would be may have this functionality. Now, eventually, this will go away as we as we roll down and finish selling off all SDI inventory. But it's this concept is going to be around for the next couple of years. No, it's going to stay around because we're going to have, we're always going to have a concept for an independent dealer, and discounts being deducted. And there's always going to be some inventory sale that we approve up to a certain amount that we're going to allow them to get their full commission, but yet they're allowed to discount the building down to X amount.

Matthias Miller  12:59
So we could have a field on the building record that

Speaker 2  13:01
says allow range, range subsidized discount, or something like that.

Matthias Miller  13:12
Or manufacturer. I don't really like manufacturer discount. That's kind of what it is.

Speaker 1  13:19
Yeah, it's a manufacturer discount. Yeah. Manufacturer discount.

Unknown Speaker  13:26
Maximum maximum.

Unknown Speaker  13:30
Manufacturer discount.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
Wow, that's a mouthful.

Speaker 1  13:34
Well, okay. You don't have to call it that. But if we if especially if we said, Okay, if there was an orgy on the billing record that had a date, and a, basically a cut off date and a percentage, and probably we should automatically give it as also $1 value. A date.

Matthias Miller  13:53
Yeah.

Speaker 1  13:55
So that you could say, Okay, here's here's starting to do. Yeah, start and end date. So here's the concept like this man, this is an allowed discount for this amount of time.

Speaker 1  14:10
That makes sense. Yeah. I've been doing some of this just manually. I've been building some manual reports to do some of this stuff. So I have a building for discount report right now that I have for both Indiana and Ohio district where I'm doing manual math in there for allowed discounts and running specials and I have killed dates inside of it. And so we're doing some of this manually right now. Why

Matthias Miller  14:34
does an inventory building haven't have a start or end date on it? You either want to keep it or you want to get rid of it?

Speaker 1  14:43
A start or end date on limit didn't track

Matthias Miller  14:48
Why do you need to start and end date on a discount on the building? When are you going to say SBI inventory? Inventory we don't want to move anymore. We just want to keep?

Speaker 1  14:56
No it's more like this. So for the month of May I want

Matthias Miller  15:00
this is not on the building record. Well, yeah, but it should be on

Speaker 1  15:04
the building record because there's no other record tied that there's no other record tied to this building until it's actually sold, which is a sales order record. So it's inventory. So it's just the building record.

Matthias Miller  15:16
Okay, sorry, go ahead. So

Speaker 1  15:20
in the case of right now, in the month of May, I'm running, some discounts on based on the, based on the year of the building that it was built. So like 2022, buildings and 2021 buildings, we're giving X amount of dollar value for 2020, twos and X amount of dollar value for 2020 ones. We've done, we did a very similar promo in May. With that said, you know, this year range we're giving 10%, this year range, we're giving 20%. So we played around with both percentages and dollar values.

Matthias Miller  16:01
Is this for inventory? Buildings only? Or do you have something like, your dealer, your during your startup period for the first three months? We'll cover your five to 10% off discount off any anything you sell? Do you have any any allowed discounts on new buildings?

Speaker 1  16:16
Yeah. I know that. Shannon had made some deal with Virginia sheds that for X month, we'll cover half your discounts that you that you give on new bills. Yes, there is that as well. All right, so

Matthias Miller  16:33
doesn't this also need to deal to tie into the dealer portal at some point?

Speaker 1  16:42
Well, yes, at some point, I think, if you're suggesting going off and building promo records, then I'm highly in favor.

Matthias Miller  16:51
I'm thinking something like labor intensive roles. Which is,

Unknown Speaker  16:58
I don't know how you do the covering half.

Speaker 1  17:00
So you're saying, Well, okay, if you do labor intensive type roles, you could say, if, if the building build date is between this range in this range, and if it's this dealer in that dealer, you could do a lot of if statements to encapsulate the information.

Speaker 2  17:15
And if there's a sales order attached, and go look at the discount, and it's half with the discount. Yeah,

Speaker 1  17:20
so you could do, you could do a promo deal that says, that says, if the dealer if the, if the SOS sales rep is such and such, then here's this, whatever, whatever we're doing,

Matthias Miller  17:35
okay, but we need to, at the point of the dealer portal,

Speaker 1  17:42
don't worry, though, because at some point, at some point, okay, the big benefit to me knowing how to write expressions is the fact that I can go write expressions for the sun that someday I might not exist, and who's going to know how to go write expressions on this stuff? Well, they're

Matthias Miller  17:58
also going to come up well, then then herein lies the problem, do they want you can't have your cake and eat it too. We want ultimate flexibility. But do you want this to turn into the payroll module?

Speaker 1  18:14
Ah, okay, so hypothetically, let's, let's say we went off and did it by just writing expressions for this kind of a thing for now, with the intent of someday turning it into records. We could do that we could say for right now, we're just going to have somewhere we're going to we're going to encapsulate these rules and we just go write a whole bunch of rules for it. So what basically a date a date column and expression dependent expression column.

Unknown Speaker  18:43
Let me

Matthias Miller  18:45
let me let my argument just for fun. Okay. So, here are all the types of promos we need. So on a on a building, we need Max dollar and Max dollar slash Max percent no start slash and date on a sales order we need something like up to this is based on

Unknown Speaker  19:17
on

Matthias Miller  19:23
No, on a dealer level, start date and date. Right relative to sales order. Discount Okay, so if we have a for inventory buildings, if we just have a max dollar and a max percent without starting index, does that cover all inventory buildings?

Speaker 1  19:52
As long as you add dollar value to it as well? Sure. Yep. dollar value or percentage? Yeah, that would that would cover inventory.

Matthias Miller  20:00
And then for for dealers, is it enough to do start? DND? Okay,

Speaker 1  20:05
hang on before you chase that thought. So you're saying, hypothetically, then we would reference that RG on the building record that they just sold to calculate whether there's any deductions for commissions then is that what you're saying? Yes. Okay, got it. Yep, keep going.

Matthias Miller  20:20
And then on the for the, for the new building discounts. It's basically a start date and end date and how much of the sales order discount? What is the maximum discount percentage that we're willing to cover? And what percentage of the sales or discount will we cover? So you can give, we'll cover half of your discount, but we will never pay more than 5%. Or we'll cover half of your discount, but never more than that.

Unknown Speaker  20:59
Why? Or?

Matthias Miller  21:00
I mean, do we actually need that? For the shaman situation?

Speaker 1  21:13
Oh, wait a minute. No, no, no, it's, it's, it's. So you're, you're proposing a building record having an RG of allowable discounts. I like this. So then

Matthias Miller  21:25
No, we should imaginary buildings. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  21:32
Single fields.

Unknown Speaker  21:36
What did I say? RG? Got it. Okay. So. So every time you want to go do this, you just go update your fields?

Speaker 1  21:50
Okay, fine with that. I've got it. Yes, I'm tracking. But so in the case of Virginia sheds, if on Let's hypothetically say we have an RG on with a date, and some sort of algorithm that says will cover up to X amount. So your macros would look at the sales rep record and say, would look for that. And then if they sold an inventory building, it looks at the building side, if they meet the range, then they get the full commission, if they don't meet the range that it uses the the the the the algorithm on on the sales sales rep record. Okay. Does that my tracking? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:36
well, I think he could probably get away with saying cover the maximum allowable amount by either method? Sure.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
Sure. Okay.

Matthias Miller  22:50
Okay. So this is Max.

Matthias Miller  22:58
Oh, this is Max, discount percentage manufacturer with a relative to retail price, Max discount percentage maybe manufacturer will pay relative to salesperson discount, or to discount to total discount. So

Speaker 1  23:16
in theory on the sales rep record, I'm assuming you do want to use some sort of RG that you can say, at this date, we're doing this concept and we're paying them at this percentage and salary burned, and so on, and so on and so forth. And we'll also do this on the commission side. And then you could add another RG line that says some date in the future, we're going to change to this. And then it would soon as we hit that point, we would update and you could continue to build, you know, new ones going down through as as people try to flex in and twist in the wind.

Matthias Miller  23:47
Yeah, and I'm not opposed to making an RG putting an RG on the building if you really think we're gonna switching stuff back and forth.

Unknown Speaker  23:53
No, I'm just seems to

Matthias Miller  23:56
me, like once it reaches a certain age, like, Don't you still want to move it? You're not gonna be like, Oh, we don't want to move it anymore.

Speaker 1  24:01
No, no, I think it is single fields. I think single fields be fine. So because essentially, what I'm gonna do is build a report that's that looks at all my inventory buildings, right, the button that says inject these two dates, and here's the concept for it.

Matthias Miller  24:15
Right. Okay. So that means that does that cover every sip? I'm not going to ask that question that way. Does that cover every known scenario

Speaker 1  24:38
we'll get further into the weeds on some of this stuff on different types of commission ties but from a straight commission standpoint, I think so. I think so. So let's let's do this. Share your screen and and lay your fields out for the for the RG on the sales rep record so I can kind of visualize it.

Unknown Speaker  25:01
Okay so we've got

Speaker 1  25:45
Yeah, but that's the manufacturer pay discount that was going to be on the that was gonna be on the building record

Matthias Miller  25:52
No That's what these were for new buildings.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
Oh, oh okay yeah yeah okay got it yeah that makes sense because yeah please yeah

Matthias Miller  26:11
then on the sales order you also need a

Speaker 1  26:18
I don't know that okay on their sales rep record I don't know you need a start and end date because you could be just copied over yeah he just make a new RG line

Speaker 1  26:34
think we pass each other let me say that one more time. So manufacture pay discounts or G start you only need a really a start date because essentially you're gonna sit you're gonna put one RG line and it says his commission is x and then here's the here's the date that it starts from that point and if there's an end to it then you just go put another RG line in for the next day to pick it up. Yeah like

Unknown Speaker  26:55
that. Yep. And when you copy commission percentage onto the sales order

Unknown Speaker  27:07
Alright, so this handles straight commission and then somewhere

Matthias Miller  27:17
where do we handle time cards?

Speaker 1  27:21
We don't really do time cards at this point. Okay, hold on let me read through this one so streets need a way to input payments to calculate against so you'll come up with where you're going to house that that payment RG I expect probably on a sales rep.

Matthias Miller  27:38
You sure you just just don't want to issue vendor invoices and total vendor you probably can't quite do that.

Speaker 1  27:45
No, because payroll is it well okay, it's combination of BA and straight from the manufacturer through Whitney. So let's do this

Unknown Speaker  28:06
on sales order

Speaker 1  28:25
Okay, I'll read on the sales order. And then we

Speaker 1  28:36
don't don't necessarily not believe in it, because they have a debit app or some cool reporting from a sales order side reporting, but we just have to make sure that we account for what happens if I don't know that sales order gets deleted and it was cancelled and accidentally deleted I guess it wouldn't

Matthias Miller  29:04
who deletes these things?

Unknown Speaker  29:09
They need to have their

Matthias Miller  29:12
either be kept from doing it or have your hand slapped or both? Well,

Speaker 1  29:15
either that or we you should evaluate you should evaluate the deletion permissions based on the sales or if and see if they match the building record deletion permissions because right now, building record deletion permissions are something they're an admin level something or other.

Unknown Speaker  29:42
Yep. Yeah, nobody less than that should ever be doing that. That's just wrong.

Speaker 1  29:53
Now the only the only thing Okay, well, okay, first straight for straight commission this works, we're going to get the payment. Wherever you decide to house payments, whether sales order or somewhere else, it's gonna get a little bit more complicated yet. What's

Unknown Speaker  30:10
next next method?

Speaker 1  30:14
Okay, so let's deal with let's deal with salary plus commission. So, salary plus commission, let's use who'd you go to NA to the APR is really okay. So yeah, go to APR, that's fine. Okay, so open, open the, the hidden columns and scroll over. So there's some key things to pay attention to. You'll see if you scroll down her salary is 1250. Oh, it's hidden for right now.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Here's your salary.

Speaker 1  30:54
Yeah, somewhere somewhere about week 2324 25. Somewhere in there, the salary should change, you should just click down through the cells on on the salary column.

Unknown Speaker  31:07
I mean, it goes empty.

Speaker 1  31:11
Well, no, it's it's it's, uh, it's hidden. If it doesn't reach a certain point, just keep going down to the empties columns.

Unknown Speaker  31:20
Yeah, oh, there we go.

Speaker 1  31:22
Yeah, that's a good cause. So what we did is we guaranteed a week, two weeks dollar value for a certain period when she came on board, and then eventually it's going to switch to 30,030 and 430 $1,000 and 4%. Commission.

Unknown Speaker  31:38
Okay. So

Speaker 1  31:39
and that's, I think that's as simple as in the in the compensation method on our G is we say, up until this date, it's x dollar value per week, or based on this compensation, yearly compensation. And then there's a new date with a new compensation, salary and and commission percentages. It's pretty much that simple.

Matthias Miller  32:05
Can we just calculate into if we do something crazy, like can we pay more?

Speaker 1  32:20
So you're, you're suggesting using a week number instead of a yearly number? Yes.

Matthias Miller  32:26
Or changing? Isn't the get 20k 36?

Unknown Speaker  32:33
Don't care. Choose choose your method.

Matthias Miller  32:37
I mean, the only other way to do it is

Unknown Speaker  32:41
he had to deal with a whole bunch of rounding. No, I mean, we track

Matthias Miller  32:44
payments that were paid. And so you just round prorate for the current week. That's not bad. It actually works. We can start off of annual and prorate.

Matthias Miller  33:02
Can we just make this? Okay, but which is a 53 week year?

Speaker 1  33:10
Do they make Oh, I see what you're say yay. Gotcha.

Matthias Miller  33:21
Can we just do annual equivalent?

Speaker 1  33:26
So annual equivalent if you put in 30,000. It would automatically math it?

Matthias Miller  33:35
Well, I mean, I don't know. I mean, based off a 52 week year. Where is it based on? So here's here's the thing, is it I think what you have is a weekly salary plus commission, or you have an annual salary plus, if

Speaker 1  33:54
you did, if you do a weekly number, then some years you will pay one week extra Is that what you're saying? Correct.

Matthias Miller  34:00
Or if you do a weekly number than seven years you'll pay under pay your

Unknown Speaker  34:06
target. I don't know whatever.

Speaker 1  34:19
You pa i would prefer to get Okay, whenever let's back this up into the simplest form. Whenever you negotiate employment contracts, you usually say something like $30,000 base salary and a 4%. Commission. I don't want to over or underpaid. So somehow we have to figure that out from a weekly standpoint, we

Speaker 2  34:47
have to have a weekly salary plus commission or an annual salary plus commission. That's the only way to do it. Really.

Unknown Speaker  34:54
Explain that to me.

Matthias Miller  34:58
If you want to make sure What either you have to say, you can save for the first nine months, you'll be on a $60,000 annual salary. And then after that, it's going to drop to 30,000. And whatever that weekly amount happens to be for the year that you're in is what you pay them.

Speaker 1  35:21
So what do you need this? So are you are you saying that the issue is that if you're paying out, like when you pay out, depending on the year, what you get, like from a salary standpoint, that will if you use yearly salary that will fluctuate depending on the year, the dollar

Matthias Miller  35:36
value, the weekly amount will will fluctuate. I think you should have your employment. I think salespeople think in weeks, I think your employment contract should be a weekly salary. Call me crazy.

Matthias Miller  36:00
You disagree?

Speaker 1  36:03
No, the emotion I was feeling was, in order to get a straight answer on this, I'm going to have to involve more people, which means more time.

Matthias Miller  36:12
You need somebody like Mark to handle these types of things.

Speaker 1  36:16
Now, it's not even mark, it's going to be district district manager and district sales managers for like Ohio and Indiana because what's going to happen? Here's what's going to happen, somebody's going to one way or the other. It's going to happen and they're going to come squealing and then the district manager is going to come to me and go Well, I thought we agreed on this. And it's it's all a math issue. It's it's not that we're you know, we agreed that we were only going to pay them $30,000. And now because of one extra week we're paying them 3130 30,100 Blah, blah, blah, or it's going to be well, we didn't pay them 30,000 Because I don't know we just got to so wait like actually you're proposing way I think I just I might be slope. I'm probably slope you're proposing using two different methods, having both the weekly and yearly columns so that we can handle both?

Matthias Miller  37:16
Yes, but really, realistically,

Speaker 1  37:18
when you walk that far, you bring baby boomer time. Oh, that's weird.

Matthias Miller  37:25
But realistically, salespeople think in weekly terms, maybe monthly, not yearly. And I would say so we can do it like this. Having two methods and just prorating and making sure it comes out right. But

Matthias Miller  37:49
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  37:53
From a strictly psychological standpoint, I like

Unknown Speaker  38:00
you like the week number?

Matthias Miller  38:01
I do. I really do. I'm fine leaving it like that. But if you're in the mood for a good conversation with these guys,

Speaker 2  38:09
I ditched the annual and renegotiate all employment contracts. Keep it simple

Speaker 1  38:21
well, you and I both know exactly what's going to be asked for and they're going to want both methods. Because they always do. Okay,

Matthias Miller  38:30
but this is also gonna talk to Mark about what it was like to roll out payroll module.

Speaker 1  38:35
I know what talk to Mark I know what it was like to roll out a role model it's

Matthias Miller  38:55
why, I guess I don't know without having that conversation.

Speaker 1  39:01
Okay, let's, let's stick a pin in this one. This one has things to be decided.

Matthias Miller  39:06
Let's do well. We're gonna design it for this.

Unknown Speaker  39:12
Which way are we designing it for?

Matthias Miller  39:13
We're designing it to account for it but I'd say no, that's ever means.

Speaker 1  39:20
Go ahead. I was gonna say let's design for our weekly and if we have to come back and and deal with the annual then okay.

Matthias Miller  39:33
If Dwayne loses the fight for weekly salary only. We will weeping Lee and be grudgingly instead.

Unknown Speaker  39:47
I'm going to have to sign this.

Matthias Miller  39:51
Oh, yeah, you are.

Speaker 1  39:54
Okay, let me make let's go around this, this forest one more time to make sure I fully understand the condition drove the conundrum is that if we say we are paying someone, a $30,000 base salary there is there's either the company takes on the fluctuation or and we break it down to a weekly, or the or the sales rep takes on the fluctuation. And we recalculate this out the weekly salary every single year, or we go to

Matthias Miller  40:23
so it's not even that you can't recalculate the weekly salary every single year, every year, you say, how much did it how far through the year? Are we? How much are we paid? What's the difference? What's the correct round amount? And it bounces back and forth between a few different figures until you get to the end of the year? And it all zeroes out?

Unknown Speaker  40:48
Make sense? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  40:50
So weekly number makes it 10 times easier. Just

Matthias Miller  40:56
it's brain dead simple.

Unknown Speaker  40:57
Yeah, I agree. I agree.

Matthias Miller  41:08
And if it's really that big of an issue, they can calculate it on an annual basis.

Unknown Speaker  41:15
I don't know what.

Matthias Miller  41:16
Anyway, I don't know. I've said my piece, you know where I'm coming from.

Speaker 1  41:22
I do know where you're coming from let's let's let's let's let's plan on it being the weekly salary. Because it's, it's really, it has nothing to functionally do with paying more or less. It's just it's it's a conversation, hey, Mr. Sales Rep, where we are embodying calculations into software, and we had to pick a method. So from now going forward, you are paid x per week, take that tenacity to take it times 53 We don't care. That's just what you're going to be paid per week from going forward from now, time plus a x percent

Matthias Miller  41:55
commission. And here's what I do here. Sign this document and you know exactly what to expect and nothing changes. And every week you get paid the same and Whoopty whoop. Yeah, no. So,

Speaker 1  42:09
okay, now you're ready to get into the conundrums of this method? Sure. I certainly know if it's conundrums. The conundrums of this method are okay, yes, there are some conundrums of of salary plus commission. Because whenever we get into guarantees, I've tried to simplify my guarantees to say, I will pay you a straight salary of x for this period of time. And then it stops here and goes to this salary plus this commission, in order to keep life simple. Ohio has done some different things where they, they look at two different math columns didn't say it's 30 plus 4%. Commission, or whichever is greater of a guarantee of $45,000 per year. So there's been some there's been some guarantee stuff that's going on where whichever is greater concept stuff.

Matthias Miller  43:18
Which means that

Matthias Miller  43:25
okay, but is that on an annual basis? Or is this on a weekly basis, it

Speaker 1  43:30
needs to go to a weekly basis, same concept, we can't guarantee we can't guarantee X salary, I think it should still follow the weekly basis. So in other words, if we said you will not make less than $1,000 per week, and if you sell 999 Like if your salary plus commission comes out to $999 we're going to pay you 1000. But if it goes to 1001, we pay you 1001.

Matthias Miller  43:58
If I sell 2000, this week and 500 next week, sorry, 1500. This week, and 500 next week, and five and 50 100 the next week. Sorry, if I pay 50. Sorry, try this again. If I sell 1500, last week, 500. This week, did those balance that balance out to a $2,000 minimum? Or does it mean literally every single week, I'm gonna get a check for 1000 or more.

Speaker 1  44:37
So far, it has been every single week 1000 or more. Now, that's not to say that we might try to come up with some crazy complex way of saying it's some sort of, essentially you're you're getting over into the next one of the next conversations that we're going to get into this whole commission draw concept of Oh,

Unknown Speaker  44:59
Oh yikes

Speaker 1  45:01
yeah we're gonna get into that one too we haven't implemented one of these yet but there is there is permission draw concept coming

Unknown Speaker  45:15
Okay, so

Speaker 1  45:19
it this is this is this is the funny thing with us it was it was we were almost done with this conversation up until this point until Monday this past Monday and then suddenly it was like we want to come up with this commission draw concept where we'll pay you a $40,000 salary and you can draw against it on a per monthly basis until or per weekly I don't know per something basis and but if you outsell it then you get the commission and and you know you I'm sure you're familiar with some of these commission draw

Speaker 2  45:53
concepts you're probably gonna have to walk me through it but yeah, I'm probably will fuzzy in my head as you're talking about it but

Matthias Miller  46:04
it's commission two decimal points.

Unknown Speaker  46:08
Is commission two decimal points,

Matthias Miller  46:09
percentage 5.25%. So

Speaker 1  46:13
far, I have not had more than I've not had any decimal points, but not more than two I would think.

Unknown Speaker  46:21
So

Speaker 1  46:24
So you could do a 2.25 commission or a like, I don't know that we want to go with three three. Yeah, if you start going that if you go to four decimal points of a fraction of what you are, you have gone through the

Matthias Miller  46:37
whole world. Okay, so we guarantee payment the biggest issue is

Speaker 1  46:47
okay, it's somewhere in here we're going to have to talk about PE cycles as well because a sales rep will need to be denoted as to what their PE cycle is. And I know the moment we start putting this into software one of the things that's going to be really really interesting is that somebody is going to say that your guarantee is based on a PE cycle in other words, you're going to look at two weeks of salary plus commission and if they don't, you know surely like

Matthias Miller  47:17
Alright, first of all, let's start with this what are the pay cycles

Unknown Speaker  47:21
either weekly or bi weekly?

Unknown Speaker  47:24
Oh thank goodness

Speaker 1  47:28
that's what we've done so far. But we probably should also include monthly

Matthias Miller  47:33
no and here's why.

Unknown Speaker  47:35
Okay

Unknown Speaker  47:40
switching

Unknown Speaker  47:43
midstream as a nightmare

Unknown Speaker  47:50
I wouldn't be do it

Matthias Miller  47:56
I mean, I think ultimately what we do in production is it's a it's a variable number of weeks one through five I mean four or five weeks where you need a weekly base and a weekly guaranteed payment

Speaker 1  48:15
well okay, now okay back back up a second I could I think we ought to allow for monthly straight commission but if you're on some salary plus commission then it has to be a bi weekly or weekly because paying out paying out straight commission on a monthly basis should be pretty straightforward

Matthias Miller  48:42
and then you're guaranteed payment if you have a guaranteed payment on monthly straight commission you would get that that would be paid at the end of the month

Unknown Speaker  48:52
Okay, say that one more time.

Matthias Miller  48:55
Okay, if you have a guaranteed payment guaranteed wage, we're straight commission sorry, that's not straight commission. Now

Speaker 1  49:05
if the only the only option so I'm imagining in your compensation record, you're going to have to pick your compensation type and ambition straight commission would be the only one that has a monthly allowable timeframe. So you can pay your straight commission weekly, bi weekly or monthly. That's it. If you're on any kind of salary plus commission, any other kind of compensation types I think it only should only be weekly or bi weekly.

Matthias Miller  49:53
Yeah, I mean it really doesn't matter because if we say the weekly guarantee payment is just what's paid weekly. Then we get to the end of the let me say what do we owe you? Not counting commission for the month until we're through the month. And then at that point we say well now let's go back and calculate using the commission what do we owe you now? There might be $0 Because you under soldier, your guarantee

Matthias Miller  50:39
but

Unknown Speaker  50:41
not sure which I like better limiting

Speaker 1  50:54
Okay, how about this salary? If you if you paid every two weeks? Why Why would? why would why would we need a monthly? Why would we need monthly?

Matthias Miller  51:06
Has anybody asked for it? Now? Okay.

Speaker 1  51:15
We just we just do our compensations every two weeks. And you can do weekly or bi weekly. Let's leave it alone. For now. We gotta go back and develop for a monthly as well. We probably should begin from the beginning, I forgot if it's a possibility, which

Matthias Miller  51:39
here's, here's what it would look like if we did we would have a salary

Unknown Speaker  51:51
salary?

Unknown Speaker  52:28
Change your main bullet point to this to this list.

Unknown Speaker  52:30
I mean, I guess the question is,

Matthias Miller  52:35
how paranoid are we

Unknown Speaker  52:39
paranoid of

Unknown Speaker  52:41
needing monthly commissions.

Matthias Miller  52:49
I feel like it's slightly. I mean, if it's, I feel like if we think there's a greater than 50% chance that we're gonna want it in the future, if there's a 60%, or higher chance that we want in the future we should do now.

Speaker 1  53:06
I am racking my brain on why we would want to have monthly. the only the only reason I can come up with that we would want to look at a longer timeframe is that if we were trying to tie it to some kind of performance metric. In other words, Mr. Sales Rep you have to meet this requirement. And then you get this and then this happens and so on and so forth. And that all has to be calculated with inside of a month.

Matthias Miller  53:37
Right. So you sell your first

Unknown Speaker  53:42
you know, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  53:45
For every 10k buildings you sell for every 50k buildings you sell, you get x kickback or something.

Speaker 1  53:53
Yeah. But I mean, the way the way I was going to handle that, because we do have one, we do have some like that. But the way I was going to handle that is that as part of the weekly pace or the bi weekly, whatever weekly or biweekly pay cycle, there would be a bonus field. And you could just it would be dollar value bonus that you would drop and we're not going to try and calculate it at this point. We're just you could you could drop a bonus in or call it a extra commission. You could call it we don't want to call it bonus in case the IRS looks at it because I don't want to get into that tax conversation but extra commission you could add to that you'd have where you could just drop it in

Unknown Speaker  54:39
on the sales rep. Yeah.

Speaker 1  54:42
So here's here's the concept that that we're hiring a new sales rep under is that we're going to pay you 30 And for if in a month timeframe, you meet X conversion rate of five or 7% I think it's 7%. If you reach a reach a conversion rate of seven percent will pay you this dollar value and if you do that monthly and then a quarter we'll do the same we'll do a different bonus if you're reaching 7% and yearly we'll give you another bonus but if you reach 10% that will give you this bonus this bonus and this bonus monthly quarterly and yearly so I just I think we ought to just handle that as just a free form field that you just drop in on the record wherever we're putting this agree or disagree I mean

Matthias Miller  55:36
I think we can so it's just a commission adjustment on the sales rep

Speaker 1  55:43
Yeah, but it shouldn't be calculated against what against your normal count adjusted commissions I guess just an extra bonus and Ohio is doing something different to if you sell X amount of units then we give you this dollar value if you sell this amount of units then we would give you this dollar value I think it just needs to be a free form field that we can drop $1 value in on the sales rep on the pay cycle

Matthias Miller  56:14
you could add a note to the payments and add a negative payment that was never issued that causes them to be

Unknown Speaker  56:25
as the bonus that's janky

Unknown Speaker  56:32
okay

Matthias Miller  56:52
net commission adjustments

Matthias Miller  57:00
right correct all right

Unknown Speaker  57:11
we we fully dealt with salary plus commission

Unknown Speaker  57:16
thanks so

Matthias Miller  57:20
wait I deleted the wrong one we said we don't need monthly or do we said we do

Unknown Speaker  57:31
we are we are going to move forward without monthly Let's kill the monthly

Matthias Miller  57:51
and then the last one was the draw.

Speaker 1  57:55
Get me think a second. We have nobody any more on this stupid over goal commission. And I do neither do we want to have anybody ever on that again. I think that thing is sufficiently dead. Let me look at this spreadsheet real quick one second.

Speaker 1  58:30
We handle the commission. But again, we handled this with a guaranteed minimum Right.

Matthias Miller  58:36
Which is a non recoverable draw.

Matthias Miller  58:44
I think what we're talking about is recoverable versus non recoverable draws.

Speaker 1  58:49
Okay, so let's talk about let's let's talk about recoverable draw is that, for example we guarantee you're going to make $40,000 per month divided by whatever okay, this you're going to make. Okay, for the sake of the conversation, let's just say we promised you're going to make $1,000 per month, if you and that $1,000 is based on a underlying commission. Okay, so how can we make this really easy? A 1% commission so you'd have to sell $100,000 Okay, I'm making up numbers just for the sake of this conversation. Okay. So if you sell $100,000 You will make $1,000 and but if you sell $200,000 Well, then obviously we would pay you $2,000 per month, because it's based on an underlying 1% Commission, okay. Yep. Now, this bonus structure, this, this this compensation structure also says if you if you To reach $200,000, we're not going to actually just pay you a 1%. Commission for the entire month, we're going to give you the equivalent of a as if we paid you for 2% for the entire month. Obviously, these these, these percentages would be variable based. So in other words, we're incentivizing sale. So if you make you have $100,000 1% commission that we want to see you sell per month, and for that, we'll pay you $1,000. So on a on a week by week basis, we're going to pay you $1,000 Sorry, $1,000 per month, that would be

Matthias Miller  1:00:37
Wait, the security, cover your car payment.

Speaker 1  1:00:42
We're making up numbers, okay, for the sake of the conversation, we want you to sell $100,000 per month. And if you if you sell $100,000 per month, that's based on a 1% commission, we're going to pay you $1,000 Okay, $1,000 divided by four per week, whatever how you want to break that out. But so week by week, if you haven't if your commission week by week doesn't outsell what that weekly number is based on the monthly number of that we want you to hit then you still get that guaranteed minimum but in order to get more money than the guaranteed minimum you have to outsell that number. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:01:23
here that's like this

Unknown Speaker  1:01:32
okay, month one

Unknown Speaker  1:01:47
alright, so we have

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
so here's the commission Well, I mean, I think this all makes it will make sense if I if I have the if I have this month, I get paid 2000 Actually, let's start with this. If I do 50,000

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
I think it's actually easier. We're going to guarantee

Matthias Miller  1:02:12
and payment I still get paid 1000 If I have money to

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
pay so 200,000

Matthias Miller  1:02:25
that I get the commission would be this. But it's actually

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
25

Matthias Miller  1:02:39
I would actually get paid 1500

Speaker 1  1:02:50
Well, okay, okay, let me let me I'm thinking about this in my own head. So I'm gonna go through this exercise for my own benefit. I think it is really that. Okay, we're gonna guarantee you to pay too soon. We're gonna pay you $40,000 This year

Unknown Speaker  1:03:12
Oh, I'm sorry. I muted you. Oh, you're fun. Right

Speaker 1  1:03:29
so we want you to sell, we want your commission to be $1,000 per month. So you sell 200,000 You get evicted. So, yeah, precisely. That's exactly it. You're if you're underselling, you're always killing carrying a balance that you have to outsell in order to get above your per week number.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48
Correct? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:04:14
Now here comes the question that I have. Here's the question I have Does, does this concept always roll forward? So let's say you carry a deficit at the end of the year?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
No. So

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
at the beginning of the year, we just wiped deficits and move forward.

Matthias Miller  1:04:34
Yeah, and if you have if it's too steep, you go fire the poor person.

Speaker 1  1:04:39
Well, that's that's this concept that I'm I'm describing the individual who was who was laying it out for me, you get you can only carry a deficit for two months. If you under sell for two months, you're automatically fired.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
I mean, that would make sense to me.

Speaker 1  1:04:56
Unless Unless Unless there's reasons for you to be under so only like, you know, there's 27 inches of snow for the last three months, and there's just no way to deliver buildings and sell buildings. You know, you're

Speaker 2  1:05:06
past the impasse, the whatever initial onboarding period. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:05:11
So in that case, okay, let's hypothetically make

Matthias Miller  1:05:14
the draw be based on the paper pay cycle, or the off the start date.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:27
I didn't track with what your comment was.

Matthias Miller  1:05:29
No, nevermind.

Speaker 1  1:05:34
Really, the draw should always be from the very beginning of the year should be calculating against the entire year. Because if you have a whole bunch of sales canceled, the potential exists that you run back yourself backwards.

Matthias Miller  1:05:48
Here's what I think happens. A recoverable draw is recoverable. At any point, you got the money, it was given as a recoverable draw, we can recover it. So the draw type determines when we pay it, but it can be recovered at anytime. And we will Well, up through the end of the year, I think we want to cap it at the end of the year just for a clean break.

Matthias Miller  1:06:21
For the sake of our calculations.

Matthias Miller  1:07:19
I guess I'm not sure what to say about the recoverable draw. What do we see somebody has a recoverable draw? And then when we really don't know how we want to handle it at that point?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:29
What's the scenario?

Matthias Miller  1:07:32
If somebody has a recordable drawn, we switch them to straight commission. I think at that point, I think recoverable drawers can only be recovered. While that while that pay method is in play. If recoverable drawers need to be recovered, they can be done so manually be

Speaker 1  1:07:56
configured things. Your concern is that you're on a recoverable draw. And somebody says, You know what? I'm tired of this silliness. I'm gonna go to some other payment compensation type.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:11
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:08:13
Why wouldn't we wipe the slate clean? And be like, Yeah, that's what I'm saying. What you're gonna you're gonna cold turkey switch? Yes, that's what I'm

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
saying. You can only recover recoverable drop while you're getting a recoverable draw. If you switch to another method your recoverable draw is none that becomes non recoverable. And if somebody doesn't like it, then you make manual commission adjustments. Here Shannon, every time you review Commission's or whoever's doing it, you make whatever manual adjustment you need to get your your drawback. We're not calculating it automatically.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:53
Agree or disagree?

Speaker 1  1:08:59
But if you're changing compensation methods, why would you care about the recoverable draw? I'm talking from the perspective of the sales rep. Most of the time, the only time that sales reps going to care about that recoverable anything of that they're going to be happy if they're underperforming and switching to a different compensation method. And if you're over the if you're over the recoverable drop threshold anyway, then it's a moot point.

Matthias Miller  1:09:34
I mean, the only real issue is if you're on a recoverable drawn, you're going to strike commission, then you don't want to take it away. I mean, the only real issue is for the owner. Yeah. If they want to get their money back, but but they've already proven they can't perform. So it just sounds like me an avoidance issue of you know, firing somebody you need to fire. That's

Speaker 1  1:09:55
right. Now, the last caveat to this whole entire Congress Station is this. Where? Okay, let's say the recoverable draw is based on the 1%. Commission, right? But if you reach expert at if you reach it, if you go beyond your recoverable draw, and you're you're being paid commission, and you're sustaining that, and you go, you actually reach a higher level like a next threshold, we're going to actually give you a bonus. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:10:38
But you said bonus bonuses or net adjustments, which means your draw gets untouched. Okay, good

Speaker 1  1:10:44
enough. This is actually this is actually you. I don't know how that's handled. Yeah, I think it I think it is just a net bonus that will like that's all any of the any of the accelerators should probably be done manually. Is that it? Or should we try to? Should we try to calculate for them and say, here are the accelerators? We think you should get this and add this as the potential extra bonus? Yes or no?

Matthias Miller  1:11:24
Well, can you are you able to do to spell out how accelerators work? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:11:29
so most accelerators go like this. If you so if you sell 50,000 per month, you're you're you're getting regular compensation. But if you sell 100,000, then we'll give you x bonus of based on some type of method, either straight dollar value or percentage of the month.

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
And you do both dollar value and percentage? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
How many people are on this, on which model?

Speaker 1  1:12:11
Nobody is currently on the monthly calculation method. My newest online sales rep is on the conversion method, which we're going to do manually as manual

Unknown Speaker  1:12:22
as manual. Maybe it is just manual, it is manual, we do it manually.

Speaker 1  1:12:30
It is it net commission adjustment. And in order to do this, whoever manages this, I can build reporting that looks at the individual's monthly sales. And if they, you know, we can let's just do it manually for the moment, if we ever decide to actually start calculating this in basically, we're going to build a report that says, here's my sales reps that are on this. And if they here's the here's the thresholds, and here's the dollar values, and, you know, eventually we could turn that into importing that into some field. But for the moment, let's just let's just leave it as net commission adjustments.

Matthias Miller  1:13:13
So we've got drawers handled, we've got Okay, and then we need a and then reports are going to be you

Speaker 1  1:13:25
already had my spreadsheet on what we've been doing for reporting. And essentially what I'm expecting is on a per district level, all the sales reps that are assigned to that district, you're going to spit out a an export of something like this. Obviously, I think we can make it a lot better. I think we can refine the data. I think there's a lot of commission and calculated adjustments and so on and so forth. But ideally, we want to expose the numbers. I do want to show one of the things I really wanted to go back through in some time fix here is to say, Okay, here's your goals tied to the sales reps goals. Here's what you actually sold. Here's what your salary is if you've got a salary here's what your commission is here's what the calculated commission like basically exposing all these numbers,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:15
right

Matthias Miller  1:14:20
Okay, so one question I do have

Unknown Speaker  1:14:27
not sure what that was about the calculator.

Matthias Miller  1:14:31
When does the when does what's week one I guess it's already defined in the goals isn't it? Yes.

Speaker 1  1:14:51
I do think we need to validate for whenever whenever we put in new With compensation our G line we do need to validate for proper start date so that we're not starting on some wackadoodle number like you can't start midweek.

Matthias Miller  1:15:14
But what's the week? Do do your weeks are they Sunday is Sunday, the first day of the week? Who

Speaker 1  1:15:29
you should know this off the top of your head after doing all this accounting stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:15:32
I think the payroll is Monday

Speaker 1  1:15:40
I feel like we should match whatever payrolls doing. Because I can I can very, very much see that eventually. This is going to get somehow this is going to tie into payroll someday, for sure. I would expect so we whatever whatever payroll start a week is we should we should mimic that

Unknown Speaker  1:16:03
periods.

Matthias Miller  1:16:25
We'll see if we can find it in the code. All right.

Speaker 1  1:16:41
Actually, you may already be validating for this because you there are fields already on the sales rep record for compensation methods. And you might already be validating for start of week and some of this other stuff already.

Speaker 2  1:16:56
Sure. Let's go to I'm going to call it module. Search for Monday. Day determines pay week we have a system switch.

Speaker 1  1:17:31
Hey, are we? Yeah, that's all that was from the very first blush at trying to figure this out.

Matthias Miller  1:17:38
Is it actually being used anywhere? No. That

Speaker 1  1:17:40
is not currently being used anywhere?

Matthias Miller  1:17:45
Sort of week. Yeah, we moved to the started week, which is not correct.

Speaker 1  1:17:49
So you already have a payment record here on the sales rep record for week and commission amount. Probably need a few more fields. But yeah, you already have some of this stuff already on here.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
Right.

Matthias Miller  1:18:08
What's the override Commission Balance start date? I

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
do not remember.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
All right. Well, Merry Christmas. And Happy New Year. Happy New Year.

Speaker 1  1:18:38
So my homework is figure out the weekly versus annual salary conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:46
Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:18:56
Think what we say by the way, is that

Unknown Speaker  1:19:03
I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:19:06
I really, really, really want to avoid the annual thing. So I might, I might be a stickler if they come back and so they really have to have it.

Speaker 1  1:19:18
I don't think it's going to be that hard of a conversation. I think it's pretty good. But I need to have the conversation because otherwise I'm blind.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:31
I agree. Completely agree. What else do you want to solve in the next?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
10 minutes

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
what else do I want to solve in the next 10 minutes?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
Is there I

Speaker 1  1:20:01
think you and I went round and round this bush before once this is a total side note, but when you are okay sales are on the dealer portal on the quote record or or on the on the on the sales records, there's I have built a diagrams and I have I have you can get the invoice exports. And it's basically whiskey it builds a URL and injects the URL into the browser, right? As a button. Is there no way to inject information in there that tells Chrome to open up in a new tab? I banged my head on this thing, or 10 minutes or 10 minutes? 2030 minutes today trying to find a way to do this.

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
In the search is on the in the dealer portal.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
Here, let me let me pull up something. I'll show you what I mean. Okay, so do you have a rocking chair? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
Okay, you can see. All right, so I'm gonna do it. So, you're gonna go smaller?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
I can see. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:21:29
so I have buttons in here for invoice. Okay, so nope, that's not it. That's not it. Where's my builder diagram of the builder diagram? Here it is. So whiskey URL forward slash visualizer. Builder diagram, blah, blah, blah, it creates this whole entire string, that injection is an open URL, there should be a way to add something that tells Google Chrome to open that stupid thing in a new in a new window.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:06
Not not in a way the report is gonna let it run.

Speaker 1  1:22:11
Yeah, that's exactly what I ran into. Otherwise, I don't have anything else to solve. Sorry. That's fine. I don't I don't quite understand why Google Chrome does it like when you inject a URL, or you use a URL, it should be forward slash new tab, and it just instantly happens. That would be too easy. You can do it as part of HTML code. You can do it part of JavaScript code, but you can't do it as part of just putting a URL in.

Matthias Miller  1:22:49
Yeah, there might be some rare situations where if you have an editable report with pending changes that we might open these links in a new window for you. It's a little bit of a leap. You could try making it be an editable report with no editable columns.

Speaker 1  1:23:09
I see what you're saying. Because we don't want you to lose changes. Yeah, it's a it's a minor. It's such a minor annoyance, but it's it's an annoyance just the same. I don't know. What else do I need to solve? I don't know. It's funny.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:32
It's all carefully put together.

Speaker 1  1:23:35
I don't know about that. Mark made the observation this morning in our Josh call that his list was really, really short. And he's like, I don't have much on my list. And I I kind of poked at him for it. Because normally Mark comes with a list a mile long. And I said I might need to come over there and make sure you're okay. He's like, Well, things are just working. So how about that?

Speaker 2  1:23:56
That's good news. is good news. You've had plenty of the opposite. Have

Speaker 1  1:24:01
you? Have I showed you anything on the visualizer recently, huh?

Matthias Miller  1:24:05
I've seen nothing. Ah, dude, you

Unknown Speaker  1:24:08
need to go open some of this up.

Matthias Miller  1:24:12
I got enough stuff going on.

Speaker 1  1:24:14
Hey, okay, for kicks and giggles share your screen go to building configurations. I want you to look at designer metal because I'm kind of proud of this one. person I know I know 10 times more about 3d visualization than I ever knew before in my life and all I can say is reality is hard to model. Yeah, no. Yeah, no go back. Go to the go to the main Mat Go to go to the regular interface. Building configurations dead middle. Okay, down for error you go. Scroll down until you get to A storage series yep does that keep going down designer started designer right there was yes that guy right there kick it into the visualizer I don't care pick April pick. I don't care pick somebody All right now 3d Beta bottom right

Speaker 1  1:25:29
now before you go change your wall color to to the red one there to whatever that color is right there Did I break something? Oh, there we go. Now check out check out the lighting functionality on that right there you know what's crazy, dude? Is that is so cool. Like I have. I've worked now with two different visualizer companies Besides building our own 3d structure app in the shed app and their designer metal. Nobody comes anywhere. Close to how good that looks.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
That is awesome. Man.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:13
I am so geeked out by this. I just it makes me happy. And it's, it's all the stupid little things change your siding type to designer siding.

Matthias Miller  1:26:28
Okay, but wait, I'm seeing the light reflected here. But the shadows coming towards me.

Speaker 1  1:26:33
Because there's more than one light source. Got it? There's a there's a sun that's kind of coming down and then there's a a point light that follows that's that's right beside the camera. So that there's always like thing deciding type. Got it. Change to siding, change your siding type on the right hand side. Changed? Yep, smart said. And let's change that color to I don't know how to pick a ticket. Pick a darker color. Sure, one of those right there. Zoom in, zoom in and get really close to that siding. And

Unknown Speaker  1:27:15
that's it. Whoa, that's

Speaker 1  1:27:17
insane. Like if you can that you can mimic something like that. That looks like

Unknown Speaker  1:27:25
oh, it's rotated on me

Matthias Miller  1:27:31
and I just popped inside. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:27:33
scroll back out. And Reva 3d Beta change to top view?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:42
Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:27:44
So you'll be able to, you'll be able to, like if you've got electrical and stuff on the inside of the building, you can you can actually move stuff from that view or from the inside view it I feel like we're doing some really, really cool stuff.

Speaker 2  1:28:03
So what keeps these guys from straight up just franchising like everything, except the fact that they don't really want to? Control? Probably

Matthias Miller  1:28:17
what would give them the right amount of control that they'd be happy? Like we got, we got folks up the hill

Unknown Speaker  1:28:28
that can build

Speaker 1  1:28:36
like some of this, some of this configurator stuff is, okay, I have come to realize that you can spend a long period of time making stuff look really, really stinking cool, and it probably does nothing for your sales or have a really cool 3d visualizer.

Matthias Miller  1:29:02
Well, I can tell you that the changes I made to get salesperson from five to 5% close rate to 10% closer it had nothing to do with the visualizer

Speaker 1  1:29:11
Yeah. How will I know about like software tools make they a good sales rep can sell them on a piece of paper in a building sitting on their lot. And you know, a good a good online rep can sell with some pictures and some PDF but I'm gonna have to stop looking at this screen. You're making me dizzy, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
Yeah, but it is cool though. And there's the fact that these guys have built out something that stands head to head with Shut up. Actually, I think about it Like

Speaker 1  1:30:00
we've already surpassed the well, we've we've surpassed look and feel we still have functionality yet that I mean, dude, it is, well, okay, we're doing things that nobody else is doing, which I'm really, really proud of. And that is that you can, you can change. Okay, you can start with one, you can change your roof style, you can change your siding type, everybody else pushes you to like change models, if you will, for doing that kind of stuff. We do that all inside of like you got a box spinning there, great, go change the siding type changes to yourself, go change whatever you want. And

Matthias Miller  1:30:35
the fact that this is real time pricing that's accurate and gets pushed to accounting automatically when it gets pushed through. That is it's insane. So, so difficult to do. So easy to explain. So difficult to do. Nobody's done it. And it's pretty impressive. I don't care if these guys have control or not. It just pains me to see them sitting on something like this and not expanding into other territories. I found out about community where the Amish builders had the rug pulled out from under them because the dealer, the dealer required somebody else and decided not to build with the Amish guys and I'm like

Unknown Speaker  1:31:20
sucks.

Speaker 1  1:31:23
Yeah, it's been okay. It's been a fun ride. It's it. Did you know I was in? I was in New York for a week a couple weeks ago. Yeah, that was fun. We had a lot of fun, but I and Addison Addison has been doing all the modeling for this. Oh, okay. So it bring that thing back up. I want to show you a couple of I missed some of the coolest parts. Oh, darn it. Pull that thing back up. I need to show you a few other things that nobody else is doing. Okay. Pick a sidewall and go down there to double doors just click on the double doors. Yep. That 72 prehung door there grab that 72 Not that one. The other one. Oh, nevermind. He's got this one. And nevermind. Okay. Okay. Does does the rotate your building click off and rotate your buildings? Slowly? Do we see the Yeah, so you can see the studs through the window as you as you turn it in the window the through the glass door and we modeled the door slightly open so we know which way door swing is

Unknown Speaker  1:32:40
Dude that is so what's your

Speaker 1  1:32:45
go back to your normal view instead of your top view. So yeah, so now go to the go to the windows and grab a Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:00
Grab a 24 by 36 White window and same thing you can see through the glass. Okay, now for kicks in. Okay, now just for kicks and giggles go down here to the black ones don't have the clear glass and yet Oh, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:33:17
You remember this I went away one. So the windows you want you want the white one. There you go. I want to see the open door. See if you can see the open

Speaker 1  1:33:25
door through the window right Okay, so now from we'll have more fun. Go down there to the electrical and grab the exterior light

Unknown Speaker  1:33:39
this guy right oops

Speaker 1  1:33:48
All right now zoom in on that light there Mr. Addison figured out how to make the light look like it's on

Speaker 1  1:34:03
let's see how that see how the light light plays around on the globe of the of the exterior light.

Matthias Miller  1:34:12
Oh, oh you crafty dude.

Speaker 1  1:34:19
Oh, okay. So go back. Go back to your back to your door. Select your door and put Yeah, put your ramps

Speaker 2  1:34:31
that's pretty sweet, too. Can I? Obviously I can't. I can't move him. Right because it's Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:34:38
Yeah. So now in order to get to swing, click 3d beta and go go out and come back in. We've got a glitch right now that it won't immediately switch but as soon as you come go out and come back in the door will be swapped. There you go. That is

Unknown Speaker  1:34:52
that is so you never

Speaker 1  1:34:54
have to wonder which way the door swings or where the doors hinged. I

Unknown Speaker  1:35:02
honestly cannot tell you

Speaker 1  1:35:03
Addison has become a bit of a modeling genius. Let me tell you

Unknown Speaker  1:35:08
that is incredible. This is

Speaker 1  1:35:12
going to change your siding type and I want to show you let's change to just a regular wood siding.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:23
Okay, and

Unknown Speaker  1:35:25
once it's okay, dump that door and let's just go do a barn door double doors right top left one there or that one, that one's fine too

Speaker 1  1:35:42
All right, so zoom in on the trimwork and you'll if you see how there's like it's directional. So yeah, that he got really really crafty. So the texture is applied by the visualizer the trim mesh is is done by the model, but depending how you build your trim mesh, you can control the directionality of the trim texture. So his first run at this he had textures he had the trim textures go in weird directions and it looked like it just looked really weird. He figured out how to figure out the mapping of the trim textures and now like all the trim textures are correct around the door oh, that's a goof you should not be able to do double double

Matthias Miller  1:36:29
double ramps ability man ability that seems like

Speaker 1  1:36:35
we have a glitch there that's actually just a that's a that's a building item record exclusion that apparently is not currently set up that was funny. Oh, it is now well maybe

Matthias Miller  1:36:54
it led me for a second there

Unknown Speaker  1:36:57
it's not supposed to they should exclude each other

Matthias Miller  1:37:06
Oh it's really confused now.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:09
Yeah, like I said we have some glitches yet

Matthias Miller  1:37:13
if you didn't really fast you do top to bottom really fast and then these to stay on did that's just okay so I want to go on the interior though.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:26
We're options.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:28
So you want to go you want to go put like electrical stuff in the inside?

Matthias Miller  1:37:32
Yeah, do we need to hop inside? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:37:34
click to your inside view. And then you get your electrical options. Yeah. I don't think the workbench is set up yet the forefoot lofts are four foot and six foot lofts are set up to actually work correctly

Unknown Speaker  1:37:48
there you go to that is

Speaker 1  1:37:53
and you can you can place electrical items although I don't think you can move them currently we have a glitch right now on being able to move electrical items from this view

Unknown Speaker  1:38:05
I'm not sure where my

Unknown Speaker  1:38:09
yeah we have yeah we do have some

Unknown Speaker  1:38:11
these are modeled or something

Unknown Speaker  1:38:14
yeah something's sideways was a bunch of modeling to do yet but I decided here's here's the thing that just makes me scratch my head every other like idea room the shed app

Speaker 1  1:38:35
3d structure at everybody else has kind of gone at this from a like they're trying to appeal to the masses they're trying to do production level and it's the little things like you model a door slightly open to model which way the door swing is you make clear glass so you can see the inside of the shed you know it's it's all of these like little things that I feel like suddenly make your visualizer feel well okay my my my little joke about the door swing is that if you if you put a prehung door and it's slightly open What is it one that make you do it makes you want to go over there and open the door the rest of the way

Matthias Miller  1:39:13
it's exactly what I was thinking yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:39:18
I don't think those are models image

Matthias Miller  1:39:21
one other question I had

Unknown Speaker  1:39:24
was the question I had.

Matthias Miller  1:39:28
Modeling other companies attend attention to detail

Unknown Speaker  1:39:35
what was it

Matthias Miller  1:39:37
now this is going to drive me crazy

Matthias Miller  1:39:55
in the loft oh

Speaker 1  1:39:56
it's no no I'm seeing bouncing your electrical items. You put it in Hmm Well that's just pictures in there they act goofy when you're on the inside view the breaker box hasn't been modeled yet they let that electrical item hasn't been modeled yet so they show up as they show up as a depth with an image on top and the inside the other view doesn't support it very well

Matthias Miller  1:40:24
oh the the builder you know production quality whatever Oh, this is what it was gonna say. The only thing this is missing that would add just like the touch would be real grass and a real landscape

Speaker 1  1:40:45
I strongly disagree with I can't stand when people do it because it always looks so fake like you don't even get a good enough Well Josh started out with a with a square of grass and it was just painful and I've looked at visualizers that have like actual environments in them and it shows it always ends up feeling cheesy

Unknown Speaker  1:41:17
I know I'm hung up Mr one of the only one

Unknown Speaker  1:41:21
if it's done right maybe they're just not done right. Or try this.

Matthias Miller  1:41:27
This is the shadow Ah, why did I really switch to the setup

Speaker 1  1:41:35
go to go to go to go to go to bitter route sheds

Matthias Miller  1:41:44
they didn't used to they used to have a they used to have their own custom custom app

Speaker 1  1:41:58
I'm gonna get the wrong ones here. Oh, there you go. There you go

Matthias Miller  1:42:08
see, but that's not even realistic. Like that's not grass. That's

Speaker 1  1:42:11
everything every single one I've ever seen. That's okay, go How about this one? Go to countryside barns

Matthias Miller  1:42:24
you need textured grass.

Speaker 1  1:42:28
Yeah, you're going to spend a lot on load time in order to do that properly. So how about this one? This one this one's even worse, I think from a from a fakeness

Speaker 2  1:42:52
you can kind of see where it switches into the photo mode. I would actually say the grass looks slightly better but

Speaker 1  1:43:01
it's funny now that I've been we've been down this road of building a 3d visualizer when you open up other people's 3d visualize you instantaneously spot where they're cheating. And, and who's using real textures and not real textures and who's cheating on on how you did stuff and it's it's funny

Matthias Miller  1:43:29
yeah, I mean, part of the issue is that there's a sharp contrast because this doesn't actually look like it would in real life. There's I don't know exactly what quality is missing. But there's some quality to it that's missing.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:42
So maybe that's

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
in here. It's just the fact that you have an actual photo with

Unknown Speaker  1:43:49
completely fake what that is. Yeah. Barf

Unknown Speaker  1:43:52
turf or something. Bartter

Unknown Speaker  1:44:03
All right. Let's go. Oh, that was more than 10 minutes. Indeed.

Matthias Miller  1:44:12
Cool. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:15
Thank you, sir. Thanks.
