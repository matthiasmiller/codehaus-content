Unknown Speaker  01:14
Ben

Unknown Speaker  01:43
morning Good morning Tim sorry audio is

Unknown Speaker  02:06
right

Unknown Speaker  02:19
well

Speaker 1  02:22
anything to discuss before we jump into

Unknown Speaker  02:26
CSS stuff I have anything here thanks all right

Unknown Speaker  02:37
Matthias jupiterone screensharing

Unknown Speaker  02:41
Jeremy host

Unknown Speaker  02:50
All right

Unknown Speaker  03:00
great so a couple of couple sales ops

Unknown Speaker  03:06
really should touch on quickly before we jump into the Oak Hill work

Unknown Speaker  03:14
so

Speaker 1  03:15
first off there was some emailing about actually this was Elesa touchbase signal about this one

Speaker 2  03:24
so Matthias is this yeah from your side where

Speaker 1  03:30
we're next steps that was this

Unknown Speaker  04:01
well

Speaker 2  04:24
should we be do we want to run it through the standard design process even if it's a bit of a non conventional

Unknown Speaker  04:39
project

Speaker 1  04:42
it would still be something we'd decoding and encoding for right?

Speaker 2  04:48
Yeah, I'm, by the way I think somebody Well, that's probably the biggest issue. I'm really interested in this. I've been interested in for Don't access for a long time from a business perspective and we'd be very interested in striking up some kind of partnership if possible the part I'm least interested in is coding and supporting it

Unknown Speaker  05:29
although for the right you know for the right price perhaps ah got some extra

Unknown Speaker  05:48
thank you I was seeing that

Unknown Speaker  05:52
keys got bumped but I didn't see anything change on the screen

Unknown Speaker  06:05
so would

Speaker 2  06:12
Okay, here's the bottom line how I envision this working you you have a phone number you have a database of contacts require a unique primary phone number for each contact and contact may or may not have a name and you

Unknown Speaker  06:48
or you have a call log that indicates your call log that people dial in for and

Speaker 2  07:16
and then there's a thin layer between well yeah then there's a whiskey that does the pipe the Twilio integration

Unknown Speaker  07:30
so we this would be a subscription based thing like they would it wouldn't someone have to be signed up to be able to access this

Unknown Speaker  07:43
well it would be ad supported for free use and there was some paid subscriptions for beyond that.

Speaker 1  08:15
So maybe would this be a smaller high level design like just a $1,500 high level design

Unknown Speaker  08:25
that involves two calls with the client and

Speaker 1  08:33
two or three working calls on you know for you and Ben

Unknown Speaker  08:38
things like that.

Speaker 1  08:40
And then after that, then you give them the option to go into in depth which might be a you know $4,000 engagement or something like that to finish up the design or six or whatever it

Speaker 2  08:52
would have to be or we might be far enough in that we might be yeah sure.

Speaker 2  09:47
Yep, I think so. And sidenote, we're starting to build designs through app hosting again, so

Speaker 2  10:00
And we need to keep track of in depth and high level designs for

Unknown Speaker  10:13
tax purposes which doesn't affect you but

Unknown Speaker  10:38
does your fax of any kind

Unknown Speaker  10:47
Not that I've heard you would think he would have been an add

Speaker 1  10:57
in additional possibilities I don't know if this was his idea or else's idea but considering offer consider offering fax or email subscriptions

Unknown Speaker  11:33
okay I think the other thing is going to be

Unknown Speaker  12:16
go ahead yeah, I think I think that's fair

Speaker 1  12:25
Do you think we should do you think you would have enough information after two calls with the client to give a price to start coding or should we just plan on doing in depth design

Unknown Speaker  12:36
even if it's a small one

Speaker 2  12:46
I kind of think we should plan to have enough and then make up for it and

Unknown Speaker  12:58
make up for elsewhere if we need to stay away from it and that's design so

Unknown Speaker  13:12
so then should we make the high level design bigger than 1500

Unknown Speaker  13:19
Yeah probably

Unknown Speaker  13:43
okay, um

Unknown Speaker  13:44
what what number sounds right to you for that

Unknown Speaker  13:47
judging from what you should be fine

Unknown Speaker  14:07
okay

Unknown Speaker  14:15
so next steps should

Unknown Speaker  14:22
let's see

Unknown Speaker  14:31
LS I was

Speaker 1  14:32
reached out to him and proposed this or do you want to reach out and reach out what would be the who'd be by person?

Unknown Speaker  14:55
I'd be happy then if you read if I share heard I can

Unknown Speaker  15:09
yeah I could reach out to him

Unknown Speaker  16:03
Okay

Unknown Speaker  16:08
sounds good

Speaker 1  16:21
okay then I'll send out those notes later to follow up on that one anything else here before you notice you didn't jot down with us or anything before we

Unknown Speaker  16:34
now I don't Well Actually yes there is you drop this in there oops not that

Speaker 1  17:32
okay then the next one was this fops one

Unknown Speaker  17:40
and

Unknown Speaker  17:45
this is when Ben actually just emailed about this

Unknown Speaker  17:54
all right

Unknown Speaker  18:02
mean we played a little bit and I think there's

Unknown Speaker  18:11
there might even be some options for

Unknown Speaker  18:45
sorry

Speaker 2  19:00
It seems to me like there's got to be some kind of automation tools that he'd been programmed to do this but I don't know exactly what they are. Hmm

Unknown Speaker  19:23
wasn't mentioned wanting to talk your call where you are able to talk about that at all?

Unknown Speaker  19:31
No, we missed that didn't make it on the list. Okay.

Speaker 1  19:37
Just I was wondering, wondering if maybe he would have there were certain things that he wanted to discuss on it, or ideas

Unknown Speaker  19:44
he had for it?

Unknown Speaker  19:53
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  20:03
We're selenium

Unknown Speaker  20:33
we have I don't know I mean it kind of feels like one of those things that's if you really wants to let's try one other thing

Speaker 2  21:20
you're supposed to have selenium that's what I guessed what else we really chat up Jenga

Unknown Speaker  21:36
tear to tear

Unknown Speaker  21:45
Right

Unknown Speaker  22:44
other websites are behind login page login pages gonna guess yeah

Speaker 2  23:11
the biggest problem I can see with this is that once you get something set up you're going to need to monitor and maintain and make adjustments

Speaker 2  23:38
so I'm not sure what additional information you're looking for beyond what I had provided

Speaker 1  23:55
Okay, I think it was mainly just Ellis had said let's talk like yeah, it was just talk. And so wondering what what would have come out of that conversation. But if if y'all didn't get to talk about it then

Unknown Speaker  24:11
maybe

Unknown Speaker  24:20
maybe we should

Speaker 1  24:20
just bump it back to his court to see if he had had any thing that he wanted. Sorry, words are coming out right. Anything he wanted to talk about? On it any ideas that you want to discuss before we

Unknown Speaker  24:33
get back to the client

Unknown Speaker  24:41
got So Ben, if you just want to bump it back to him then.

Unknown Speaker  24:45
Thank you for that.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
Good and

Speaker 1  25:09
we will jump into Phil and I see that just Justin replied today from three to four three tomorrow from nine to 1030

Unknown Speaker  25:26
work for him

Speaker 1  25:29
so I guess maybe jumping into that first but we're not into the bigger picture of it

Unknown Speaker  25:35
what

Unknown Speaker  25:39
what you guys were able to do from your

Unknown Speaker  25:41
call

Unknown Speaker  25:45
or any work that you did it did on it so far this week

Speaker 2  25:48
so we spent an hour on it I was driving got bogged down and we took a break and spent 45 more minutes on it and I put Ben at the wheel which worked better for me I don't know if it did for him but there's still a boatload of stuff left in there to clean up and some of it I think is stuff that we won't really have full answers to until it gets more of the walkthrough stuff like that Sure So then

Speaker 1  26:26
next next step really wouldn't be too Too bad have that walkthrough and and finish up a weekend

Unknown Speaker  26:35
there thanks so okay

Unknown Speaker  26:57
yeah were there any

Speaker 1  27:00
specific policy I was Giantsbane question to do mm. Okay. So there weren't any specifically for Matthias

Unknown Speaker  27:26
bunch of

Speaker 1  27:27
these it's just kind of making up and probably at this point for a lot of those just kind of

Speaker 2  27:32
make up a summary of what we think should be there and not worry about much in the way of columns and buttons and whatnot at this point

Unknown Speaker  27:55
okay, so then

Speaker 1  27:58
we should probably try to have that call with him today.

Speaker 2  28:03
If we need another one we can put it in tomorrow morning right

Unknown Speaker  28:15
yeah

Unknown Speaker  28:23
yeah and then

Unknown Speaker  28:27
to finish up Monday

Unknown Speaker  28:40
Matthias

Unknown Speaker  28:41
would you be available Monday anytime for

Unknown Speaker  28:46
for a wrap up call

Speaker 1  28:48
an hour an hour and a half to wrap up any questions that we would have for you and to

Unknown Speaker  28:54
make up the ballpark estimate

Unknown Speaker  29:02
maybe do 12 to one but you weren't going to be

Unknown Speaker  29:13
Yeah, I wouldn't be I would maybe be able to make 12 to one but I would I probably wouldn't have to be on that

Unknown Speaker  29:38
well to one or three to four.

Unknown Speaker  29:54
Let's move forward there were a few men

Unknown Speaker  30:22
And

Speaker 1  30:25
I will try myself I'll just reply as tentative maybe and

Unknown Speaker  30:37
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:38
I'll see see how my afternoon is

Unknown Speaker  30:52
okay great so then you

Unknown Speaker  30:59
can go ahead and reply to Justin

Speaker 2  31:01
let him know like to plan on this afternoon

Unknown Speaker  31:22
we'd said three to 430 on that right

Unknown Speaker  31:37
all right then I'll send out a calendar invite

Unknown Speaker  31:44
actually I was just duplicating one over from

Speaker 1  31:51
okay great anything else from either of you guys on Oak Hill

Unknown Speaker  31:57
we should discuss

Unknown Speaker  32:00
before that call or while we're all three here together

Unknown Speaker  32:16
okay we will have that a wrap

Speaker 1  32:27
Guess how much we should touch in on some of these other things

Unknown Speaker  32:47
kind of

Unknown Speaker  32:50
not really inclined to dig in any of these right now but

Unknown Speaker  33:09
to the we probably

Speaker 2  33:31
maybe this one would be worth looking at quickly,

Speaker 1  33:34
and then save the other ones like the Z GA job. I'm fine with waiting until we can discuss that in a little bit or discuss project scheduling a little bit more

Unknown Speaker  33:45
and figure out what priority should be

Unknown Speaker  33:52
this one would

Unknown Speaker  33:52
could be helpful to dig into this a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  34:00
Keep that ball rolling.

Speaker 1  34:02
And then probably after that, we'll go ahead and wrap up today's call and

Unknown Speaker  34:08
wrap up really

Unknown Speaker  34:13
unless either you had anything after that. So 7664 This was that conversation about standardizing

Speaker 2  34:29
client code versus three LLC. And then how some practical impacts of that.

Unknown Speaker  34:42
And Matthias somewhere along line you had mentioned

Unknown Speaker  34:46
that

Speaker 1  34:49
I think you've mentioned something about wanting to keep a four as a four letter code and how that would It seems to be more of a billing

Unknown Speaker  35:03
okay got it so you're suggesting billing for

Unknown Speaker  35:17
got it okay that's fine

Unknown Speaker  35:37
guess that but if we're doing away with core then

Speaker 2  35:46
still like seeing core in the title got it which you said I wonder if we could use billing type to set so

Unknown Speaker  36:00
we often will put something at the end

Unknown Speaker  36:04
in parentheses to put TNM and TM or premium and whatnot

Unknown Speaker  36:15
I wonder if we

Speaker 2  36:17
I would like that if you're always split billing typing in the suffix there

Speaker 1  36:27
we almost should do is have billing type become a lookup with two fields one for for the type name and one for the abbreviation

Speaker 2  36:39
that gets added as a parenthetical suffix if you will to the title

Unknown Speaker  37:01
does that sound right

Unknown Speaker  37:08
yeah

Unknown Speaker  37:15
interesting we only have

Unknown Speaker  37:26
this is like a shift list

Unknown Speaker  37:33
yeah I mean I mean I don't see any reason why we sure

Unknown Speaker  37:50
so.

Unknown Speaker  38:21
So, st building type.

Speaker 2  39:41
Don't know that we'd actually have to feel this I think if it's I think we could just have it have a dictionary list or something similar that's shipped with the suffix I don't think we'll ever want to change

Unknown Speaker  40:02
Aren't those lists

Unknown Speaker  40:16
yeah I mean these these are unchangeable items

Unknown Speaker  40:52
so

Unknown Speaker  41:02
no charge

Unknown Speaker  41:26
you're thinking

Unknown Speaker  41:27
we could so keep this as a ship simplest

Unknown Speaker  41:29
yeah you wouldn't so so what you would do is you would have a or do this

Unknown Speaker  42:01
split them out like this

Unknown Speaker  43:00
seems like it's as simple as that okay

Speaker 2  43:04
and that'll be easier than shipping dictionary lists or a lot of us actually we might be able to

Unknown Speaker  43:45
there we go okay

Unknown Speaker  43:54
cool so then what I did up here

Speaker 2  43:59
I can do away with that as far as yep well correct that's right do away with that and then

Unknown Speaker  44:19
then move

Unknown Speaker  44:19
these in your table there

Unknown Speaker  44:35
and next year okay

Unknown Speaker  44:49
cool I think that's good.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Okay

Unknown Speaker  45:14
all right, well, I'll

Unknown Speaker  45:15
plan to clean that up and send it over to

Unknown Speaker  45:17
LS

Unknown Speaker  45:21
and see what his thoughts are.

Unknown Speaker  45:26
Like, yeah. Good,

Unknown Speaker  45:34
continuous improvement man.

Unknown Speaker  45:37
Denise improvement.

Speaker 1  45:41
We're gonna encourage our clients to standardize canine and dog. Do it for internal use do

Unknown Speaker  45:52
exactly. That Exactly. Cool. All right.

Speaker 2  46:09
Good. Good. So it was a bit I'm not sure if you

Speaker 1  46:15
were on this message. I think maybe just Matthias and Ls, was saying that. That dauber put in a really good plug for code grafters. And the design process at the summit Tuesday.

Unknown Speaker  46:31
Were you were you on that one? Oh, okay. Thanks. So

Speaker 1  46:36
he gave like a short, short presentation of their, what they're planning to do for,

Unknown Speaker  46:41
for an online dashboard

Speaker 1  46:45
and everything. I'm presenting it as how to do it as simple as that the symbol workhorse or something, basically, the the driving force behind everything, they're wanting to centralize all their stuff in,

Unknown Speaker  46:58
in their database.

Speaker 1  47:01
So he was sharing some of the mock the the wireframes, from, from Rubisco. And explaining what they you know, their vision for some of the different features and whatnot. And he said, it's, you know, these are just wireframes stuff, change. But anyway, he did he put in a plug for code crafters and design process, how good it was to, to go through that process, and how, how we really caught their vision. And yet he felt like we really caught their vision and and invested in it. And he talked about how he said something about that.

Unknown Speaker  47:38
This Matthias guy would would pace around and

Speaker 1  47:43
then think in all it's an idea. And like, what if we did this? Anyway, it's kind of funny hearing it fun hearing it from his perspective.

Unknown Speaker  47:53
Yeah. That's cool. So, yeah, they seem to be pretty, pretty excited about it.

Speaker 1  48:05
It was interesting, they asked for a raise of hands of people. They're like, Who would want offline access? Or you know, who would be non internet and who'd be an internet user? for it? And it was, I think, was over half the hands

Unknown Speaker  48:18
were, were for offline.

Speaker 1  48:21
So I think that was a surprise to send us because it's Roy her was talking to he was right here talking to me afterward. He commented on that. And one of the board members, I think, commented on that, that, that they're gonna need to make sure that it's, it works for offline users, because yeah, they're more than than they were expecting. So anyway, that was

Unknown Speaker  48:48
interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 2  48:55
But yeah, they seem to give us a good a good reception, and we're pretty positive about working with us on that. Anyway. And I'll

Speaker 1  49:10
be sending out some, some notes about different leads that came in and connections I made and whatnot, probably have some, some sales opportunities you can write up and

Speaker 2  49:21
like Alice had done for the Yeah. They have conference from awhile back.

Speaker 1  49:29
Oh, and then the email that came in yesterday from that Levi. He was yeah, he was one that I talked to. So I'll plan to reply to that internally here and

Speaker 2  49:39
with some additional notes. Yeah, that one I'm waiting to hear back from LS about what he wants to do with that one. Yeah.

Speaker 1  49:51
Yeah, I think since they have whitelisted us, I think, I think Benjamin,

Speaker 2  49:55
yeah. Are you guys done with me? Um, I'm sure. Thanks. So jumping off, okay. All right. Talk to you later. Cool. All right, thanks.

Speaker 1  50:13
Yeah, for that one, I think since they are whitelisted, whitelisted. Internet, you find for them, basically, they can just add apposing deadzone to their

Unknown Speaker  50:23
whitelist. We don't do 3d rendering do it.

Speaker 1  50:30
We don't currently, but we've toyed with it, we've put we've looked into it, I forget, let's see, which was one of the minibar and companies, maybe more than one Gotcha. We had looked into that some.

Unknown Speaker  50:44
And so I think

Speaker 1  50:46
it'd be something either we could do, or we could provide an integration with with another program that

Unknown Speaker  50:51
does it. Gotcha. As well, I forget how it was that we were going to be doing that.

Speaker 1  51:01
Or wait, maybe it wasn't going to be 3d rendering. Maybe it was just more of a, like a floor plan layout that we were going to be doing for bald eagle barns. But I feel like with some with some clients along the line, we were

Unknown Speaker  51:15
talking about it. So that would be the biggest.

Speaker 1  51:22
The biggest thing or kind of the main thing there was sort of the downside for that one. Yeah. But But yeah, it would at least be interesting to at least be worth hearing what

Unknown Speaker  51:32
size and also to say about it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  51:42
So okay,

Speaker 1  51:45
anything, anything you need for me? Are we drop off?

Unknown Speaker  51:52
I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  51:59
Like I'm good. Okay.

Speaker 1  52:04
Very good. And you've got enough to keep you going. Next few days here. That's a real good look.

Speaker 2  52:11
Yeah. With Oak Hill picking back up. There's more stuff that I can do. Okay. No. Oh, one thing. I just remembered that the data points from the screenshots that we have in the last walkthrough, or it's in the incident. That's something we want to do. You mean, in the end the data points?

Speaker 1  52:44
I don't think so. I think it's more important at this point to get them into make sure they're in the proposal.

Unknown Speaker  52:51
Right. So if, yeah, if they're in the US, and you've been taking notes on Google Doc or something,

Unknown Speaker  53:02
are they Yeah, I've

Unknown Speaker  53:03
been doing the call summary notes.

Speaker 1  53:09
Yeah, I would say at this point, probably just putting everything into the proposal would be the way to go. I don't think we need to keep the incident up to date at this point. Right. I mean, I'll probably like for a call the day I mean,

Speaker 2  53:30
is everything from the incident moved over to the to the proposal? No, because there was a handful of things that we didn't get to in the walkthrough. Okay. So yeah, I left those. Well, actually, they might be moved to Oh, remember how I did that? I didn't great animals.

Speaker 2  54:18
The information is moved over to some degree, but I didn't integrate them out in the data points incident. Okay, so that you could say, it's there if you want it to. And I kind of keep us level with where we stop. Sure. Yeah, sounds good. Okay. Well, if it's over

Speaker 1  54:47
in the proposal already, I might just go ahead and let it

Speaker 2  54:51
just do it there in the proposal. Right. So I can I can double check and make sure that everything is smoothed over today where the call you have a great

Unknown Speaker  55:10
and what we can do is

Unknown Speaker  55:15
like this for

Unknown Speaker  55:16
now

Unknown Speaker  55:25
just might help to keep stuff separate a little bit

Unknown Speaker  55:49
actually it might not be too bad just keep an eye on what

Speaker 2  55:59
okay I guess while we're on it just be good just to poke into this a little bit more

Unknown Speaker  56:12
Do you have a little bit of time to look at it here

Speaker 1  56:18
so we got it we hadn't gotten into any of the borders or we didn't get into dog work

Unknown Speaker  56:25
last time yeah we got into Delaware

Unknown Speaker  56:37
had

Unknown Speaker  56:38
read my notes and see

Unknown Speaker  56:42
steps

Unknown Speaker  56:54
the dog order newts gotten copied over seeing this

Speaker 2  57:01
oh that is in the lists section I said my bit they're great because some of those were ones that he thought that Justin thought we wouldn't need but it wasn't sure what the right order status yeah

Unknown Speaker  57:19
yeah okay J order number how to set order nodes yeah okay. So then basically

Unknown Speaker  57:53
like this

Unknown Speaker  58:14
order number order notes it's

Unknown Speaker  58:27
buyers special request order type

Unknown Speaker  58:50
Archer de

Unknown Speaker  59:27
So

Unknown Speaker  59:57
just

Speaker 2  1:00:32
In my Grappas customers

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
Review Order

Speaker 2  1:00:56
interesting was it was that Preview Order PDF yeah that's to preview the PDFs. So we were just putting that all in the

Unknown Speaker  1:01:05
oh sure

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
converts a PDF option

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
yes you order PDF

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:01:27
gotcha maybe your wife left or something like that

Unknown Speaker  1:01:40
so

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
so basically everything is

Unknown Speaker  1:02:04
moved over and

Speaker 1  1:02:11
the ones here with green are the ones for dogs and the ones

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
for D birth and color you want to do screen share yeah oh sorry yes okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
In quick entry and we talked about that here.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:57
And

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
All right, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:53
Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:54
this is looking good. I think we'll just probably what I would do is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
to

Speaker 1  1:06:11
try to jump back and forth between the data points and the proposal to make sure we're getting the information. We're covering the information that we have listed here in the data points, but then do my notes in the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:29
proposal. Gotcha. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:06:40
And this does come over here into the lists section.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
Oh, it's already here. Okay. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
Very good. Yeah, I think on that. And

Unknown Speaker  1:07:26
