Unknown Speaker  00:22
As Mark

Speaker 1  00:27
Twain should be joining, as well, but

Speaker 1  00:38
you kind of surprised me today with your say you're working on payroll module soon. So obviously your that had been changes and be pushed out for further than that. I thought so that's a good side.

Matthias Miller  00:56
Yeah. checks, check printing in front of it. And so I don't think I've got just a whole lot of stuff stacked up

Unknown Speaker  01:06
in front of you right now. So. Yeah.

Speaker 1  01:12
Good. Well, I send you an agenda typically, I typically do one minute before the meeting. So, which is bad, but let's take care of the first two items. While we have Wayne. On here, the one is just reviewing that first one. Right Payment Discrepancies, basically, I

Unknown Speaker  01:42
mean, I The goal is

Speaker 1  01:45
to figure out a weekly process for Dwayne's office to review these discrepancies by payments generated inside stripe portal that were never tied to a sales order, and then manually apply them to the correct sales order. This will ensure all are listed when we reconcile with bank statements. So Matthias, you might have a different I mean, this was just my suggestion is look at the stripe payment discrepancy. Report, where to find it, how to spot for discrepancies, what other discrepancies might they see on this report. And then the last point is just an FYI. So

Unknown Speaker  02:21
this one?

Unknown Speaker  02:24
Well, I guess,

Unknown Speaker  02:26
should we add this to the menu?

Speaker 1  02:34
I think that's a question for you. As far as I think you're envisioning a weekly process where it's

Speaker 2  02:40
put it put it Matthias put it, if you're gonna make it a user, why are you making it pretty? Well, you're I was I wasn't paying attention. I know what you're doing. Okay, keep going.

Matthias Miller  02:51
I mean, it's a standard report, I can put it on the menu, so you guys can find it more easily. So basically, what you're looking for is blocks of red. Specifically, what you're looking for is blocks of red that are not tied out to a sales order ID. So here's the payment needs to be traced down. Here's another one. The other reds that you should be seeing are all related to refunds, which judges were there

Speaker 2  03:21
any way to say? Is there any way to say suggested sales order cross reference with payment amounts in the exact same amount? Make it really slow when?

Matthias Miller  03:37
What if we did a sub pain of sales orders with credit card payments within X number of days of payout or within the three prior, you know, within a week prior to the payout for this amount?

Speaker 1  04:00
But how does the sales order know? Or will these sales orders even know that there's a credit card payment made on them?

Unknown Speaker  04:10
Well, I mean, that's the question.

Speaker 2  04:13
How are you matching? Are you matching based on source payment ID. So if you make the if you make the source payment ID, which I'm assuming is the stripe ID on their payments are g of a sales order if you make that thing visible so we can actually copy in the appropriate ID number. The probably you're gonna get more matches on this. Because what's happening right now is they're copying it into the notes.

Matthias Miller  04:38
Well, yeah, but Josh's whiskey thing is gonna fix the matches this year.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
I'm glad you're confident. Well,

Unknown Speaker  04:48
why am I not mean why would it

Speaker 2  04:53
because it's probably going to be buried out on the Admin menu unless he's going to put it on the main menu then. Great If it's buried out in the Admin menu, I'm afraid it's gonna get forgotten that it's there

Unknown Speaker  05:09
I mean, we can have a link to this report

Unknown Speaker  05:17
I don't know.

Speaker 2  05:19
So his plan is to say here's here's a stripe transaction here's its ID number, here's it sales order and it just goes and writes essentially an import to the payments RG Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  05:39
What what do you need on what do you need on your end as far as a business process is concerned?

Matthias Miller  05:57
Where you put a link to the digital screen called record well,

Speaker 2  06:03
so 288 there, that 2820 how, like, if I send somebody to go chase that thing down, how do we expect them to go find it?

Matthias Miller  06:19
Well, so I mean,

Unknown Speaker  06:23
and why do we have a payment on a quote

Unknown Speaker  06:32
Well, that's another fantastic

Unknown Speaker  06:33
question

Unknown Speaker  06:39
we'll ask Jenny about that.

Speaker 2  06:44
Scroll down to the is there any sales or notes what was the skin that was attached to this thing? Modification history

Matthias Miller  06:59
when it was created without a stain

Speaker 3  07:03
oh oh wait a minute. So she did a vote

Unknown Speaker  07:12
for barn door so

Unknown Speaker  07:14
she never made it an actual sale

Unknown Speaker  07:17
but seems wrong and 2623

Speaker 2  07:19
Can you just can you signal that that that ID to me I need to chase after this that's ugly she didn't credit she did a credit card transaction but obviously I don't know how she made this thing No, I do know how to she made was like the modification history. Sorry. I know this is completely derailing now But did she mark it as who marked it as a quote

Unknown Speaker  07:55
screen it was cool.

Unknown Speaker  07:58
Yeah, so she opened up the court just took payment on it lovely.

Unknown Speaker  08:05
What's wrong with that

Unknown Speaker  08:10
I'm counting the one who's gonna care about this

Speaker 1  08:14
we've said we accept money in any form any shape just we're not taking

Speaker 2  08:23
any form in any shape but do we accept it in any fashion? No. Okay, so next

Speaker 1  08:35
but yeah, how are you going to find that? I mean No, I'm just looking so it says payment net. So the 2820 94

Unknown Speaker  08:45
Okay, exposing my ignorance here how much for how much was this stripe Payment How much did we

Matthias Miller  08:55
was the actual total? Yeah, it was

Unknown Speaker  09:07
I think it

Unknown Speaker  09:10
was 29 549. So let's do this.

Speaker 2  09:16
But you're not even you're not even giving me the actual transaction amount you're giving me the deducted amount

Matthias Miller  09:23
Well, I mean, I can calculate what I think it's going to be but the stripe is still ultimately the guy who who calculates it

Speaker 2  09:35
so they don't so in the piano information they don't actually give you the original amount. No

Speaker 1  09:46
Well, the four of us can't figure out where this goes to we might

Speaker 2  09:51
well okay, but they do do they give you do they give you Transaction Date. Only payout date Okay

Matthias Miller  10:03
we have a lot within that okay so let's do let's change this back to all let's do this so payment

Unknown Speaker  10:19
yeah let's do this

Unknown Speaker  10:24
and we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  10:39
payout net payout date and then we're going to do so we're going to do anything with a

Matthias Miller  11:24
I mean that's just hand wavy

Speaker 4  11:27
I guess we could actually do it right it'd be one minus 0.029 plus point three I think I'm remembering right all right, so

Matthias Miller  11:43
then we're going to do so payment amount

Unknown Speaker  11:50
and then we're gonna put this thing in here so they can come back and find it

Speaker 4  12:10
right so here we got the net we're saying was this we should put the date on here.

Unknown Speaker  12:21
Oh, the total payout is the lump sum for that day right? Like yeah, yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:27
yep

Unknown Speaker  12:34
we're fine just like well

Unknown Speaker  12:39
that wouldn't be right

Matthias Miller  12:42
that's not you know? I mean, it appears to me

Speaker 1  12:52
Well, a number of things could have happened here. This could have been

Unknown Speaker  12:56
what's what company is this for Indiana go ahead mark.

Speaker 1  13:05
Well, I was gonna say that there's a good potential a good chance that a charge was run and there's there was actually no sales order was ever created for this or does doesn't that happen where maybe not I was thinking like vinyl structures which they're going to have they might have somebody paid no, that might have never been an issue

Speaker 2  13:41
do we have a what approximate payment of that date or approximate date of that payment that to ADA?

Matthias Miller  13:49
There would be well I mean it's 1031 so it's it's the last week of you know the last week of October somewhere probably

Speaker 2  14:01
20 payment for invoice.

Speaker 4  14:23
Looks like we should have a straight payout district as well.

Matthias Miller  14:35
It looks like payouts are happening every day and I think typically it's a one to three day business around I don't really know exactly

Unknown Speaker  14:43
where it is here

Speaker 1  14:49
but is there more information in the stripe or is this right portal show you more

Matthias Miller  14:56
you can see customer name, email address, etc

Speaker 3  14:59
Look up well you want to look it up yeah oh this is actually a better way okay so let's let's drop this in here I have it

Speaker 2  15:15
but the question is why did he do it this way it was never applied to the sales order either who did this and why

Unknown Speaker  15:26
do we know who done it you don't have to have a third payment for invoice guy that's draft was created by whom? Whom whom whom? Whom whom created it

Unknown Speaker  16:03
How are you able to find it Dwayne?

Speaker 2  16:09
Well, you said approximately 29 Well date range and and 2905 50 to 2550 is the is the dollar value

Matthias Miller  16:23
you're looking at the sales are $1 value

Speaker 2  16:25
I'm looking at in stripe portals where I'm at Oh, when I'm going to create it and then I can go ask why

Unknown Speaker  16:35
would you ever do the customer email address in there

Speaker 2  16:40
yeah, I have I mean I have the sales order too. It's I can't I'm trying to figure out from the stripe portal side who actually generated this is what I'm trying to figure out it's in 2310553

Unknown Speaker  17:04
so

Unknown Speaker  17:10
550

Speaker 1  17:13
Okay, so that payment was never is never applied to the payments RG here right

Unknown Speaker  17:18
yeah, that's right

Matthias Miller  17:26
there's a built on site

Speaker 2  17:32
so the good thing for this and I have a feeling I need to go search this other one too. But in the description for this transaction it says payment for invoice which means it was generated and sent. I've got two of these guys I wonder who this one is? Who's this one let's go look

Unknown Speaker  17:50
at this one now

Matthias Miller  17:57
so somebody's manually issue issuing stripe invoices to customers for them to pay through stripe?

Speaker 2  18:05
Yeah, I just don't understand why because in the case of the one that was asked of the first one we're talking about there's no reason for that. I mean, the dealer could have taken that transaction directly in on the sales order now whether he knows that or not I don't know

Matthias Miller  18:25
if it's a built on site how do those payments work? Is there anything special? Well,

Unknown Speaker  18:29
they can transact those through the hauler portal as well

Speaker 2  18:39
just hunting another one here that I'm wondering was ever applied either

Speaker 2  18:49
Oh, good. This one was actually applied, but I bet you it's in your report to go hunt for winter. It would be it would be for date around 1017 It would be around $3,007 less than $3,007.29 That's a bunch of that's the one Yep, that'd be the one right there. That is that one there is applied to the sales order the the ID is in the notes. What's the ID is it ending you three Aw

Matthias Miller  19:22
yeah. Does it start with PI does pm no so it's it's a different ID that's why we want to whiskey so people get the right idea in there

Unknown Speaker  19:41
well,

Speaker 2  19:44
I can show you that the the stripe portal it says ID PM 102 J The. So why would it give you pi in SPM.

Speaker 3  19:59
Now that being said Good that's invoice por que ch

Unknown Speaker  20:10
so you have no PMS?

Speaker 2  20:32
Okay, try this number, do you have an ending N am x l y i?

Unknown Speaker  20:38
That's the one do

Speaker 2  20:41
what they do? Why would they bury that in the activity and give us a different number? Yes, that's the same 129 1964 Same one. All right, well, I know where to go hunt for it, but that's dumb.

Speaker 5  21:02
It sounds like maybe using a company that functions are different.

Speaker 2  21:09
Set up for future use it. Okay, there's

Unknown Speaker  21:13
interesting, but lower fees.

Speaker 2  21:15
There is the piano. Okay, well, I would have got this wrong every single time. Yeah, and that one is applied. So. Okay, so in the case of the one that you have highlighted right there, Matthias, how do we how do we identify to that transaction?

Matthias Miller  21:32
Well, at this point, Josh's, that's in Josh's court. So you're gonna have to have a way to when you link it out to say, I'm linking out to this existing payment row or you go into the sales order, you delete the old one from the payments or to yourself

Unknown Speaker  21:50
and go out into the woods the portal.

Speaker 1  21:53
But like on this one, like this doesn't show us the growth or the payment fee will will copying that source payment into the payments RG like how will the payments RG show the stripe fees then

Matthias Miller  22:13
when Josh is when you put this ID in the sales order ID into Josh's thing it's

Unknown Speaker  22:19
going to calculate the fees from the transaction. So

Speaker 1  22:22
it's going to ping or go back to the stripe portal, get all the magical information and okay

Matthias Miller  22:33
so I think I think one of this one of the things we could do Dwayne is also give you a link to record payment and it would pass through this

Unknown Speaker  22:50
I don't know how you want to do it

Unknown Speaker  22:58
I don't know

Speaker 1  23:05
did we wait until Josh has his whiskey page completed and then take another look at it or?

Matthias Miller  23:12
Yeah, but and I think we should start asking around and figuring out where where we're using non standard ways of collecting payment for

Unknown Speaker  23:20
sales orders.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
Because there's non standard situations that require

Matthias Miller  23:27
well, okay, so what are those non standard situations? And

Unknown Speaker  23:32
can we account for those in some way?

Speaker 2  23:35
Well, okay, in the case of Marissa and Victoria, no, there's no way to account for the fact that you want to send a requested payment to the customer now, now well these other two situations here and shit. You know, I'm gonna have to chase those down. Why did that happen? Where did it happen? Now? This is part of accounting making other things behave so this is good stuff.

Matthias Miller  24:02
So something that we can also do is allow people to specify a sales order ID I don't know if you guys want to go down this route, but if a sales order ID is in the notes of a stripe charge, we go ahead and automatically apply it there. I mean, no stripe charge.

Speaker 1  24:24
You're just manually typing in the sales order. Into the notes.

Matthias Miller  24:29
Yeah, I mean, they copied across

Speaker 4  24:33
I don't know if that's that might be worse.

Matthias Miller  24:40
Or a while I don't mind that doesn't really help. Okay. Well, I think I mean, I think

Matthias Miller  24:55
so, Dwayne, do you want some kind of a search I mean, what do you want the search to do, because it could be looking at the balance, it could be looking at the date range, we could do some kind of scoring system where if it's, if it has a payment at this amount or or balance within this amount, and it's within the Date Range Rover as either those were just treated with which within the date range, and just kind of sorta sales orders by probable, the likelihood

Matthias Miller  25:31
we could have, see if we can get Josh to import email address for the source payment.

Speaker 2  25:38
answers the question of, there is no payment on the sales or

Matthias Miller  25:46
email address might the balance do? No, because if it's a down payment, who knows? Yeah,

Speaker 2  25:53
but do you have email address as part of the payout information?

Matthias Miller  25:58
That's what I'm saying. If Josh can have the payout syncing, look up the stripe transaction and see what the email address was for the stripe transaction.

Speaker 1  26:13
When your thought is typically whatever email address which was used for, or that is also the email address, record it on with the customer's information, you can search by it, you know,

Unknown Speaker  26:26
it's a shot.

Speaker 1  26:32
Right. But Dwayne, can you also just manually like if you find these manually, you can just go into the stripe, open the stripe or refine? Yes.

Speaker 2  26:41
So I mean, the way I found these other two is I just I if as long as I have a date, and you know the approximate amount, it's not rocket science to go find them. There's not that, like, we don't have 30 transactions in the day. Right? I

Speaker 1  26:55
mean, shouldn't we just stay with a manual process like that for right now. You find a discrepancy you drive for, and but being snarky here, but we should make it a little painful for whoever's doing this so that we put a fair amount of pressure on standardizing it as much as possible.

Speaker 2  27:23
To my knowledge, there is only one person who has access to a stripe portal. And that is Shane. That's to my knowledge. So I think it becomes a very fast conversation into my office here and saying, Hey, before you initiate any payment requests, let's make sure that we know what we're doing.

Matthias Miller  27:49
Oh, that's a pretty easy conversation doing. Shane, would you? Do you appreciate this access? Would you like to keep access?

Speaker 2  27:56
Shane's not Shane's not the problem? Okay. Shane is no, it's, we get requests like this come into our office, hey, can you can you send a payment link got to stop it? No, I had the customer call me it will take the transaction rates directly to the sales order. Now, that being said, Why can't Okay, why is it so I still got Josh didn't like this idea this morning. But I like this idea. We already have a whiskey functionality. Why can't we send a URL to that to a customer who clicks on it? And says enter your payment details. Click Done. There you go. ties it directly back to the sales order.

Matthias Miller  28:45
Well, best way to answer that question is what did Josh not like about it?

Speaker 2  28:51
Well, I think it was the way I framed the question. It like for example, imagine if you could copy out a an open URL based on the sales order that you opened up and the CC the credit card URL that's right there. So all the information is embedded directly into the URL, and it just ties it out. Your customer opens it. I don't know. That's probably dangerous. But then again, they were just giving us money and why do we care?

Matthias Miller  29:23
I mean, the biggest thing is if you're showing customer information, you need some kind of way that people can't believe

Speaker 2  29:31
it doesn't show customer information, I guess it would need to in order for the customer to feel comfortable to actually make a choice.

Matthias Miller  29:43
I mean, there are ways around it. I don't know what Josh's hesitation is. It seems to me like that is the thing that would solve everything else. It's the one thing by which everything else becomes unnecessary.

Speaker 2  29:57
Well, some of this is just going to quietly Go away over time now maybe not I mean for North Carolina in Indiana it's going to quietly go away because inside of the shed we have the ability to actually generate a payment request

Matthias Miller  30:18
okay, but those still need to get linked across so that they

Unknown Speaker  30:21
still need to be linked across you're correct

Speaker 2  30:29
the issue the issue with generating a payment request is that there's no tie in so you can go it's a it's a one off request and the only way you ever get it into a sales order if you go back and check on it

Matthias Miller  30:55
um happy to be involved Why should sounds like it's mostly a business process plus priorities process with Josh

Unknown Speaker  31:15
wait what what are what should be next steps on this inner

Unknown Speaker  31:24
works you're spending

Speaker 2  31:30
I mean, I don't know the next I mean okay next steps is well

Unknown Speaker  31:38
it's just

Speaker 1  31:43
well, do we lose anything by rocky Josh is working on that whiskey page. I don't know when he's going to have that done. But as soon as he has that done, is there any harm in just starting with his manual process and then figuring out what we need to do from there

Speaker 2  32:12
the only the only the only thing I don't like about the manual process is one. It doesn't give me the actual number I'm hunting for which makes it really really like I'm relying on someone's kid to be able to problem solve as well as I am and that's dangerous.

Unknown Speaker  32:33
Okay, well we can add a

Unknown Speaker  32:42
let's do this. My computer's being ridiculously slow today.

Matthias Miller  32:52
But we could do

Unknown Speaker  32:54
something like this

Speaker 4  33:13
this is just painful. Sorry, what is going on?

Matthias Miller  33:28
We can add a column for the estimated gross. Does that give you what you need?

Unknown Speaker  33:39
don't like the word estimated.

Speaker 1  33:41
But sometimes why can't Why can't we bring that over from the stripe? Or like that's where we get the gross pay? Is it not?

Speaker 1  33:54
Like you're getting the net payout from from the stripe or why can't we get the growth payout from the stripe portal as well?

Matthias Miller  34:05
We can't wait there, Josh. I mean, we can pass Josh if you can bring that in.

Unknown Speaker  34:12
Are Easy not bringing that in on

Speaker 6  34:14
one of the payouts. But

Speaker 1  34:17
okay, what else? He's saying bringing in the fee, right? Is he bringing in the net pay and the fee

Unknown Speaker  34:23
on the sales order?

Speaker 1  34:26
Well, could he not on this discrepancies report bring in the net pay and B

Matthias Miller  34:34
we need to hear. So in this case, the fee only exists on the sales order. And these are not like sales orders. So we don't know what the fee is. We can calculate the current.

Unknown Speaker  34:47
Just pretty great.

Speaker 1  34:50
But okay, so so the way we're getting those fees is just want to see that I'm thinking about this correctly. If a customer wants to pay 2500 on a With a credit card that goes to, we pass that information to stripe, and Stripe, makes the payment and says, I'm gonna pay you 2490. And then we say okay, and we just assume the difference is the

Matthias Miller  35:20
know, when when on a sales order, we say, customer wants to pay 2500. And we go straight and we say go pay 2500 strip comes back to us and says, Oh, that payment on the sales order was 2500, your fee was $4.20. And therefore, the net is, is the difference. On the payout, all that we're getting is the net payout amounts. And so we could have Josh, so because the what we're doing in the diagnostic report that we were getting the fee here is we're looking up where is what's the sales order that's associated with this payout? And what was the fee on the sales order? But because the issue here is that they're not linked to sales order, we don't know what the fee is.

Matthias Miller  36:17
And so what we need to do is have Josh basically, when he's importing the payouts for each of the each of the payments, go look at the original transaction and put in there so that we can get

Speaker 2  36:32
facts about this exact Matthias it's point nine, seven, if you divide your two numbers, two against each other in your your gross versus your your payout, it's point nine, seven, so it's 3%.

Matthias Miller  36:47
It's 3% plus 30.

Speaker 2  36:48
Well, I just took your your column four and five and divided them by each other and it's it's giving me the same number every time.

Unknown Speaker  37:05
Pricing and fees

Matthias Miller  37:13
is 2.9 plus 30. So because of rounding, you're good, but there'll be cases where it's not. So

Unknown Speaker  37:19
you can give me an even give me a fairly accurate number.

Matthias Miller  37:24
I still prefer to say estimated because it's always gonna be like it's off by a penny wise about a penny. I can't find a

Speaker 2  37:29
penny. It's when it's off by $3. It's interesting.

Unknown Speaker  37:35
Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  37:39
I can give you that calculate amount. Yeah,

Speaker 2  37:42
just just drop that calculated amount in a column and call it approximate gross pay.

Matthias Miller  37:52
All right. Well, the practice is better than estimate

Matthias Miller  38:01
it all right. So assuming I do that, gamey thing. So that that covers the

Unknown Speaker  38:21
goodness. Becker was a stripe payouts to Zephyr for now.

Matthias Miller  38:30
And once Josh has his stuff in place, we'll reconvene and we'll go through the process of diagnostics are doing well dude with whoever's handling it and

Unknown Speaker  38:40
doing well let us know if there's anything else we need.

Unknown Speaker  38:50
To do I know we gotta decide who does it.

Unknown Speaker  38:55
Right. So you raise your hand.

Speaker 2  39:00
Raise my hand for what? For doing this? I know exactly who needs to do this. So what's your timeframe? on on on? Is that Mark is that is Josh's top priority is making that ability to push transactions into a payment RG correctly? Or is he was coming later? I

Speaker 1  39:36
don't know we could ask. I mean I I think that is one of one of his top priorities. I'm not sure. Just Well, I'm just assuming my assumption is he'll have it by a week from now but so there's really nothing you could do until he has that right.

Unknown Speaker  39:57
That's right.

Speaker 1  39:59
We'll just Ask him on our next call. That's, that's quick, you know? Good. Yeah. So, I just copied this out of my project management checklist what we had on implementing daily billing process which will initiate the following transactions. So we had said Dwayne needs to make a system switch to move from this report rubber stamping buildings to recognizing daily manual updates. And then when you're going to switch that sales orders needing invoicing report to send automatically I believe you had set up a schedule report we just hadn't turned it on

Unknown Speaker  40:42
so that's

Speaker 1  40:48
yeah, we're ready to turn that make that system switch and we just wanted to do this while you're on Matthias to make sure that we're not missing anything else.

Unknown Speaker  41:06
Well, I've turned the scheduling on so what am I turning off?

Unknown Speaker  41:11
There is a scheduled task, isn't it?

Matthias Miller  41:14
Yeah, but one of the scheduled tasks needs to well, so you set your owns you have your own emails going out now.

Speaker 2  41:32
So the report sales orders needing invoicing. I have it on the phone menu tree to be going out. scheduled every Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at 7:15am it goes to mark Jr, Mark Troyer and Calvin Mark Troyer and Shannon for each the three companies

Matthias Miller  41:52
well this one is rubber stamping is turned off we use

Unknown Speaker  41:58
so that's all just happened with that

Speaker 1  42:01
and then let's just take a quick look at at that report. It's pretty straightforward I think but let's make sure we have we're all clear on what how to use it what needs to happen

Speaker 1  42:32
okay so the we're Matthias are we in transition with that RNN? Again just It should all be working correctly now so we'll see some are some okay

Speaker 1  42:49
what are we seeing 718 915 days

Unknown Speaker  42:58
this is going to be cleaned up a lot of

Unknown Speaker  43:02
processes

Speaker 1  43:03
well maybe before we get into the details on that mean it's basically what you you highlight the ones you so those are gonna mark off the ones they want then you highlight those click on Invoice Selected sales orders and

Unknown Speaker  43:22
you're done right

Unknown Speaker  43:26
I don't know is it worth chasing these two or not?

Unknown Speaker  43:48
I'm going to

Speaker 1  43:53
this is new house outdoors a weego Those two the two New York dealerships were the default what we do not deliver we just changed when you just change that yesterday I don't know what that have any reason why these are showing up incorrectly or not.

Speaker 4  44:20
Let's do this. Right now. Why don't we have a better diagnostic mechanism than this?

Speaker 4  44:36
mean it's it's not. So you said it would have switched from me

Matthias Miller  44:47
doing a machine or Yeah, during the market change history.

Speaker 2  44:50
The change that I made was is that we were not setting New York stealership locations to actually generate transit tasks because the we don't do any scheduling for those individuals now, since so they are we are now generating transit tasks which will show up on Ohio's report which they're responsible for. And but anything between beginning of time and yesterday or the day before Tuesday, I guess if there's probably not transit test tied to them to be actually mark off so that they'll actually create a delivery date.

Unknown Speaker  45:33
So that's probably why this one is showing up.

Unknown Speaker  45:39
And what do you see?

Speaker 1  45:41
So that was the bottom on this one that said Dwayne, somebody so I noticed that Dwayne a lot. 11 Eight Mark 11 and bass.

Unknown Speaker  45:53
Dwayne's to blame? Okay, so

Speaker 2  45:54
this this guy right here, if you look at modification history on the transit task that had that one happened today the they asked for the transit test to be marked off on October the 25th. For September the 18th. That'll never work. Didn't work for them. They won't work for me, because they won't actually create a delivery date for it. I get five days automation window to make these things happen. And that doesn't fall inside of five days. Yep.

Matthias Miller  46:31
Okay, so Dwayne's cleaning stuff up?

Speaker 2  46:34
Good when you doing I love when people clean things up and make messes for others in that great

Unknown Speaker  46:43
work more than what is

Unknown Speaker  46:52
and Shetler whenever that guy is he doesn't live very far.

Unknown Speaker  47:00
Every day 915

Unknown Speaker  47:09
was my fault I didn't do it

Unknown Speaker  47:16
what why?

Unknown Speaker  47:18
Why do you date of 915 Dwayne

Unknown Speaker  47:25
Wade isn't this the same one

Unknown Speaker  47:29
Which one were we in

Unknown Speaker  47:38
we were looking at

Speaker 1  47:39
at the second one and he shot Lord

Unknown Speaker  47:45
I don't think it's the same way

Matthias Miller  47:53
I mean doesn't have the notes is definitely different

Unknown Speaker  48:03
Oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

Speaker 1  48:08
why is it Mark district eggs? Oh, nevermind it is sorry. I

Unknown Speaker  48:11
was confused

Speaker 2  48:16
go to go to the sales order

Unknown Speaker  48:27
transit tasks

Unknown Speaker  48:30
I really want to take no responsibility for this I

Unknown Speaker  48:32
don't know what this was. I know it has my name on it but modification history is line.

Speaker 2  48:43
Wait, this is the same. Wait a minute. This is the same transit test. Okay, hold on a second. Okay, give Okay, let me see that with that. Let's pull that transit task back up. Let me see the ID on the transit task. So 126 Now let's go back that's Andy Shetler let me let me see that New York building

Matthias Miller  49:15
and the trans attachment here Sure.

Speaker 2  49:23
What do 306 I have no idea. I'm confused. This can be unless I had two things up and I may have crossed up my information

Unknown Speaker  49:37
but what really happened with that second building the first one, let me

Unknown Speaker  49:40
let me see. Let me see this a Lego building? Let me see the which one has my note in it? I'm so confused.

Matthias Miller  49:49
Let's go down to okay this is the way go 7567.

Unknown Speaker  49:57
It has you noting

Matthias Miller  50:01
This isn't a sales order. It's linked to a building that is not.

Speaker 2  50:04
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, okay, I'm okay. I'm sorry. I smushed two circumstances that happened today together. Okay, circumstance one, all the money was collected. So whatever changes you made Matthias to the way to the end, the the sales order MDX search stuff. And the issues that we were having with the scheduling report that sales order to the building, that you were just looking at the one with as my my notes, the bottom about all the money being received. I updated that one because there was all the money on the sales order has been received. We were next. Nobody ever marked it off as ever been delivered. It's July. And I'm making the assumption that the building was absolutely delivered, and Marlon never notified us. The other one is a situation that I talked about earlier where Gabe Yoder called me today saying that this building was delivered by I believe myelin and it never came off finish goods inventory. And I told him the reason that they became all things because inventories because it was outside the the, the automation window, sorry, I was mixing two situations together.

Matthias Miller  51:26
Alright, so the very short answer is going to blame Dwayne knows what he's doing.

Unknown Speaker  51:32
When they're drinking, remember what he did. That's about the only

Unknown Speaker  51:37
if Dwayne wouldn't do so much wouldn't have this problem.

Speaker 2  51:41
You know, I left notes on that one building so that I could remember what this was, and I still couldn't remember it. So

Unknown Speaker  51:47
there you go.

Speaker 1  51:51
Now, I mean, about outside the automation window, are you saying before we started this rubber stamping process?

Speaker 2  51:57
No. So the there is a report that runs every single evening that reconciles locations are G on the building record with transit tasks, tasks that were completed today. And that report always is looking five days into history to grab any transit tasks that were completed. Okay,

Matthias Miller  52:19
good. Business, speak into one of the issues we ran into this morning where it was flagged as being delivered to the customer and somebody changed something and

Unknown Speaker  52:35
yes, it we had. Actually, I think I copied you and Leanne on a Twain

Speaker 1  52:45
on the North Carolina report there was there was a building that it appeared like it, it was a customer building. So you had scheduled the delivery, then meanwhile, the customer cancelled and you redirected it to a true point Mocksville did everything correctly, except he did not change the final look the location type from customer to dealer and had it delivered to the sales line. It sat there until another customer bought it. And at that point, it said Oh, you were delivered the day you showed up on the sales line, because the delivery date was to the location type was to customers that have dealer something like guising so Matthias and I from our we looked at thought that had he changed the location type from DLR to

Speaker 2  53:56
you don't have this building to you. I'd like to see it because this is something else

Speaker 4  54:09
I'm going to try to restart zoom I'm going to make you post and jump right back in the only backhand

Unknown Speaker  54:14
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  54:57
Singing this song What's my problem

Speaker 1  55:15
I have an invoice number three and if you want to look at it and to 310664

Unknown Speaker  55:41
and this is the this is the building

Speaker 1  55:55
can you share your screen or maybe it's not it was helpful at least

Unknown Speaker  56:24
tabs open I don't know which ones which anymore or do you go

Unknown Speaker  57:40
interesting

Speaker 3  57:46
so who stamped the data and I've just mentioned for location task it's 4249 I'm confused location Georgie makes absolutely no sense

Matthias Miller  58:10
and one of them appears to be missing a transit task ID as well

Unknown Speaker  58:12
yeah yeah agreed

Unknown Speaker  58:27
but now it makes sense well let's just do this not do that let's do floor let's make that one Okay, now makes enough sense

Unknown Speaker  58:49
okay, I don't know I don't know what happened Good question.

Speaker 1  58:54
Water under the bridge and we'll deal with the next one as

Speaker 2  58:59
well and I can put the thing back in order Oh, it looks like it looks like to me that the the Mocksville locations our G line item is not tied out to a transit task which is probably means it was manually updated so I don't know we're gonna go with it the way it is. Okay, you

Speaker 1  59:23
changed it back so that once it is not delivered, they'll show up on it'll show up correctly

Unknown Speaker  59:32
well I'm assuming it is delivered is it not? It

Speaker 3  59:34
has not yet been delivered. Then why is it showing delivered

Speaker 1  59:39
well to where is it delivered to the to the end customer to that can CAN bus

Speaker 3  59:44
so which one actually triggered this for let's see here the delivery I mean the billing

Speaker 2  59:51
line I see a lot Hall was it was changed a lot hall but it was never unchecked for customer. That's what happened. Got it. Got it. So it is not delivered yet so that we just need to drop out that delivery date.

Speaker 2  1:00:11
So that actually was actually correct. So it was supposed to get it but what? That one row just needs to go away. The customer delivery row just needs to go away. I can let me just this needs to come back off what here? What?

Matthias Miller  1:00:30
No, yeah, you're I mean, totally agree that road should turn into a dealer dealer Hall because it's linked to the blood transit task. But if this process fixes it tonight, I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
don't know that it makes much of a difference.

Speaker 2  1:00:51
So this was originally going to Steve Nelson, Steve Nelson is the one that canceled it.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
That's the one that needs to go away. So

Speaker 2  1:00:59
the moment that line item was tied off to again to a customer it updated itself to Tammy green.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
Got it? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
now I know what happened.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
Okay. was good.

Speaker 1  1:01:14
So good. I think that covers one or the first two items. I expected they're both about five minute jobs. That was so we have one other thing per Drew's request on. For you guys. I don't know if we have anything else. For you, Dwayne. You can stay on if you want to, but

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
no, I probably need to drop off. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:01:59
So Matthias, did that make sense? As far as adding another column for employer taxes? Let me

Unknown Speaker  1:02:18
share this with your moms.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:33
That makes sense. So does this need to make it on the payroll? That verification report?

Speaker 1  1:02:45
No, I, the times when they're when they're going to move them to another. Like, say employee does for a week is working somewhere other than his default area, they're going to change where the where the gross pay goes. But if we're off for a week or two or even four weeks, the import taxes are going to the wrong account. I think that's

Unknown Speaker  1:03:10
it's okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:14
And then,

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
but the percentages could could vary

Speaker 1  1:03:22
from one to another? No. Okay, I'm just thinking what one thing that would actually make a lot of sense would be if we would create a table that says you'd have a table that has on the left column, you'd have employer have rows payroll. And on the right, you'd have the associated employer taxes. So you'd have gross payroll would have, say production, direct production, indirect production, labor, those two. And the payroll taxes for those are the same. If you look at our chart of accounts, we have, like underneath production, we have a direct labor and an indirect labor, but we only have one payroll taxes for both of those. So if we were to make a charge, like that, I think that might be the better. Well, okay, if we do that, then we're back to we may as well do that in our spreadsheet. Where we, we could just do that in our spreadsheet where we do this?

Speaker 5  1:04:39
Yeah, I'd say just bring it back and transactions anyway. And so then we can assign. We're gonna assign those payroll tax, employer tax GL accounts.

Speaker 1  1:04:48
Yeah, it would require no additional development here and it would be more accurate because we would always just map those. Yeah, I think yeah. Okay good.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:06
We're fast developer. I try

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
anything else that you have for us?

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
Nope, I'm making Well, I'm making a whole bunch of you know, slogging through these. This isn't that. Do you guys hear between an update tonight or tomorrow night? Or, or do we even do we need one? It would be something like the vendor invoice reconcile stuff on the reconcile and some of the multi sales order and deposit process.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:47
Are you good? Are you going to be working on that? Make Friday tonight or tomorrow night?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:52
I don't think makes any difference but I would like to have by Friday. Looking forward at my schedule, but

Unknown Speaker  1:06:02
by tomorrow night.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
Yeah, by tomorrow night. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
That's good. Yeah. Probably for tomorrow night in just a little bit more stuff in between now and then. So good. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
Awesome. Appreciate it.
