Unknown Speaker  00:33
Pretty good

Matthias Miller  00:58
Jul

Speaker 1  01:03
I spend more time than usual on mute today. There are windows being installed at the front of the office

Matthias Miller  01:15
got it? Nobody's breaking in nobody's

Unknown Speaker  01:26
cool

Unknown Speaker  01:47
gentlemen,

Matthias Miller  01:49
good morning, guys.

Unknown Speaker  01:50
Good morning. Good morning

Matthias Miller  02:04
you Well, anybody have any inspiration or should we just dive straight?

Speaker 1  02:18
Well, it's not inspiration necessarily, but I am looking with with sadness at the cloud prediction for Dallas on Monday. So

Matthias Miller  02:35
who

Speaker 1  02:39
we have ever hotel but down there, but we'll see. Or maybe we won't see.

Matthias Miller  02:46
Maybe we won't see. That's funny.

Speaker 2  02:52
So how are you going to observe it just eclipse glasses? Or do you have all kinds of?

Speaker 1  03:01
Yeah, I mean, we've got, well, eclipse glasses, but then there's something made of the same material. It's basically just a rectangle on a piece of cardboard for those of us who already have glasses.

Speaker 2  03:20
Yeah, in Dallas, you're going to be That's right. Are you right in the path of?

Speaker 1  03:26
Yeah, it should be in totality. But apparently, if you if you want a pretty much guaranteed view. You need to head up to Vermont.

Speaker 2  03:42
What is that? Is that the best forecast for right now to be? Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:47
apparently Vermonters or whatever they call themselves are stealing themselves

Matthias Miller  03:59
in flux.

Speaker 2  04:01
So they actually expect a lot of people to shift their travel plans and move at their I think so. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:08
Okay. Interesting.

Speaker 2  04:11
How does Ohio work for right now like centralized Millersburg

Speaker 1  04:16
in my sense, is it's pretty dicey up until you get to the northeast

Speaker 2  04:29
Yeah, one guy I used to work with he said it all depends on the weather.

Unknown Speaker  04:38
Quite literally,

Speaker 3  04:41
partly partly cloudy here. So who knows what that's gonna mean.

Unknown Speaker  04:44
Yeah, yeah. We'll see ya. You'll

Unknown Speaker  04:50
still get dark in the middle of the day even in the dark Yeah, okay. All right.

Speaker 4  05:11
I don't have anything about the Eclipse. I'm not paying attention because I don't have to. And I'm kind of relieved. So that's how I got it.

Unknown Speaker  05:20
Fun jokes.

Unknown Speaker  05:24
Inspiration, you're gonna joke about?

Unknown Speaker  05:29
How does the moon get a haircut?

Unknown Speaker  05:33
How does the mood get a haircut?

Unknown Speaker  05:35
Eclipse it?

Unknown Speaker  05:42
Okay

Speaker 4  05:51
I'll be telling that one. Thank you all right. Well, I thought it's been a couple of weeks and actually wanted to start with some of the incoming emails to see if I if they should be attached other tasks. So I think, Joel, you had sent an email about a bug fixed on the income statement and balance sheet. Was that was that associated with something we're already working on? I assume it was I just I couldn't figure out what it was supposed to be.

Speaker 1  06:27
I mean, it was, I call it a follow up to restructuring, we hit done of the income statement, and balance sheet.

Speaker 4  06:37
Okay. Is it closed? Regardless? Everybody know what they need to know here?

Unknown Speaker  06:47
Are you folks happy with it?

Unknown Speaker  06:51
I haven't looked at that. And you're looking at an

Speaker 2  06:54
income statement right now that shows. I know it's when you suppress, suppress. So yeah, about

Unknown Speaker  07:02
we do that.

Matthias Miller  07:03
We haven't done an update in a little while. When was this?

Unknown Speaker  07:11
It's been a minute. It

Speaker 4  07:13
has been a minute. This is where the thing this is two weeks without a meeting. So this is probably back in open an email here. March 21.

Speaker 1  07:28
Okay, oh, sorry, is that saw or drill noise? A problem for you all.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Can you hear?

Speaker 4  07:39
me good? Okay, well, I'm going to put this in Review for drew that maybe just to make sure that it did what you need it to do. Now look at

Speaker 3  07:50
what we're getting at the sticks. Raw materials, customer cards, raw materials.

Speaker 2  07:58
Yeah. And it only listed at once like I know, specifically in the raw materials, you're showing the same amounts like 175. And then yeah, we instead of that one done.

Unknown Speaker  08:09
We consider it. Okay, great.

Unknown Speaker  08:11
We verified it in real time. I

Speaker 4  08:18
didn't actually want to do that. Okay, cool. Um, let's see beginning reconciled balance shifting. I think this was from you, Matthias, is this related to a task we're working on already?

Matthias Miller  08:35
Yeah, we're where are you? Okay, we have the short term fix in the long term fixed. I think we're just trying to get through short term fixes at this point. Okay. Drew, are you happy with? where things are?

Speaker 3  08:59
So did you Where were you at with this? Did you get that done? Well, we talked about just making so that it doesn't, it doesn't push in overtop of reconcile items.

Matthias Miller  09:14
I was waiting to get a sign off on. Well, you need to talk about payments on quotes, and waiting on a sign off on the exchanges before we can do that.

Speaker 3  09:29
Yeah. Okay. All right. So basically on the agenda for today, I guess.

Speaker 4  09:37
Okay. So, it open a new task in and of itself, and it's ongoing here. Yeah, it's fine. Do we have a date then for it to put it in context?

Matthias Miller  09:51
Today or tomorrow, okay.

Speaker 4  09:57
Sounds good. And it's on the agenda. Grace. Okay. Something about accounts receivable reports. I've got a lot of emails here from Mark back and forth is the are these accounts receivable reports? A task in and of themselves? Was it related to something else?

Matthias Miller  10:19
They are, but you can consider them done. Okay, great. I don't believe we have any outstanding. Anything outstanding in them. Great. I love that.

Speaker 4  10:35
And let's see something that just says reconcile. Okay, can you see this note over here? It's the mark and drew, I made progress on the reconciles. Is this attached to an existing task, or is this a new one and of itself?

Matthias Miller  10:52
I guess this would be related to the previous reconcile issue they were talking about. This would be in Drew's court, though. Okay. Reconcile number shifting. Okay. So I don't know where we drew, were we going to do anything about this? Are we just going to leave these and

Unknown Speaker  11:22
I think I had looked at those

Unknown Speaker  11:24
made some updates. And recent, we

Unknown Speaker  11:28
had made some of their email that I missed.

Matthias Miller  11:34
Do we need to those?

Unknown Speaker  11:36
I think that's taken care of.

Speaker 3  11:44
What does that email say about at the top? That's what these they were deleted?

Unknown Speaker  11:51
Yeah. Let me open this string and see what we have here.

Matthias Miller  11:56
They were pointed. Because the transactions became invalid.

Unknown Speaker  12:10
Or?

Speaker 3  12:18
Am I don't remember well enough. We should probably look at them. But I think just letting them go, I think is probably.

Speaker 4  12:30
Okay. Actually, why put it in your court to review it? What would be the date we want to put on that weekend? Sometime this coming week, or?

Speaker 3  12:44
Yeah, just do next Thursday. Okay. That's great.

Speaker 4  12:53
Okay, start back up at the top now. Think the rest of it should be good. Okay. So we had closing process for accounting impact for Matthias.

Matthias Miller  13:03
We still haven't put the stopgaps in place. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  13:07
I assume it's in progress, though, at this point. Maybe, maybe not.

Matthias Miller  13:16
It could be real, though. All kinds of other things. Okay.

Speaker 4  13:20
Any change to the date? For sorting purposes here?

Matthias Miller  13:26
No. Well, I mean, you could move it to, you know, yeah, we I don't know what date we should put on it. When I haven't really talked about kind of heads down trying to get the numbers out. I don't know if we should just put it out in mid April and then reconvene and reprioritize Once we're through recurrent deadlines. Sound too vague. But

Speaker 2  13:58
is this the stop gap? Is this so that? We're no, no. You're basically like, closing the books for 23 or no? Were changes made don't push to accounting anymore. And 23.

Matthias Miller  14:17
We know this is so that when you make a change to an old record that would it was recorded in 23, that we would warn you that it's not going to get pushed to accounting.

Speaker 2  14:31
And until then it just, there's no warning. It just It won't push to accounting. Right.

Matthias Miller  14:40
Is that correct? That is correct.

Unknown Speaker  14:44
Yeah, I'd say that's That sounds right.

Speaker 4  14:49
I'll update it to mid April. Adding budget columns to the income statement. This was injuries court to review.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Yeah, that's done. All right.

Speaker 4  15:04
Closing books for 2023, the vendor and company mismatch for Matthias

Matthias Miller  15:14
you're going to check for more issues. I don't know. Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  15:20
Yeah, Drew will check account.

Speaker 3  15:22
I have not seen more. No, I haven't tried to mold I don't have a way to create the problem. And I haven't seen more so I'd say we're done with that one.

Matthias Miller  15:39
Always nice when you can't create more problems

Speaker 3  15:44
Well, the reason I can't create them is the reason we had them in the beginning. So yeah.

Speaker 4  15:53
All right, another closing bullets for 2023. Oh, go ahead, Mark. Sorry. No,

Unknown Speaker  15:57
good.

Speaker 4  16:00
customer deposits, Matthias grade reports, targets 314 is it's done.

Matthias Miller  16:08
It's done. But we need this. Well, we have a report but I want to standardize it. Okay, so that needs to be done.

Speaker 4  16:17
Do I need to create a separate sub task to standardize it? Okay, sure.

Speaker 4  16:28
Oops, knock my coffee over here. That'll be fine. Oh, but we'll try. Okay. Okay. Drew allow company specific signature adjustments.

Matthias Miller  16:44
Um, as we said this was no this is not working. Yeah. Okay. If

Speaker 3  16:52
the response to the initial that it's ready to check was that it's not working. I don't remember if there was anything since that or not. Okay.

Speaker 4  17:04
Are we still is it still in Jonathan's court to try to fix or or how are we doing on this?

Matthias Miller  17:10
I don't know if it's Jonathan I need to check in and see what availability he has US court it's in that's what's in my court. Good. update it.

Speaker 4  17:24
Okay, we closed the ad default GL accounts per email from Mark just great. The next one from Matthias is accounts receivable add as of date function to AR reports. That

Matthias Miller  17:37
is done okay

Speaker 4  17:46
okay, handling historically reconciled transactions for Matthias

Matthias Miller  17:51
Miller This is a duplicate of the shifting reconcile numbers Okay.

Speaker 4  18:01
merge those together okay. Received not vouchered reworking account balance diagnostics report for Matthias

Matthias Miller  18:15
bigness is done.

Speaker 4  18:20
Income Statement for pole barn rev and cogs, whatever that means.

Matthias Miller  18:24
Oh, goodness. Well, we didn't get that done. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:42
One is to heart

Matthias Miller  18:43
I don't know that it's wise to put this in front of all the other financials. No, it's not. But so mid April.

Speaker 2  18:54
Yeah, end of April. Probably more realistic. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:02
You can get this right now.

Matthias Miller  19:05
There's a new term in mental health called toxic optimism.

Speaker 4  19:15
Yeah, I agree. All right. Mark, this one was put together but budget totals in an Excel spreadsheet for Matthias to import that get done. That

Unknown Speaker  19:27
is done. Okay. I

Matthias Miller  19:28
figured. I think clarification Mark, we actually imported those with two decimal places and are rounding them everywhere. So that's what I mean by totals matching.

Speaker 2  19:42
You're rounding them to the whole dollar everywhere.

Matthias Miller  19:47
Well, we're storing them with two decimals. But we're rounding them to show. So if you have 10 that are $100.49 and a $100.49 They will show $100 and $100 and the total will be 201. Okay.

Speaker 2  20:14
I don't know that that's going to be an issue. I mean, just knowing when, when you say it will show them you're saying whether it's on the income statement, or it's on the the other expenses versus budget reports, but wherever he is on a report, it would show like that.

Matthias Miller  20:40
I only checked the budget entry. I'm not sure about the income statement if we show those with decimals or not.

Unknown Speaker  20:47
I won't up right here it says decimals. I wonder, like the budgeted number.

Matthias Miller  20:57
Yeah. Joel, should we is a little bit of a derail from project management. But, Joel, if we're showing it with two decimals on the income statement, should the budget entry show two decimals? Or do we care? That would

Speaker 1  21:26
I mean, consistency seems reasonable. I don't

Speaker 1  21:36
in some ways, the the level of detail feels like it might be appropriate to the two although I mean income statement is at scale as well. But I mean, that's, that's concrete data. The other is you aren't going to decide how many cents you allocate.

Matthias Miller  22:04
In the grand scheme of things, we're inputting numbers, it doesn't matter we're showing two decimals in the income statement. I think the bottom line is for all practical purposes, we're going to show you two decimal places. So you can disregard my decimal place comment. Okay, let's keep going nobody else wants to come up with Penny budgets to do we'll help them out Yeah, we need to have a sit down

Unknown Speaker  22:36
for coffee so that we can discuss

Speaker 4  22:46
all right. Another closing books the raw materials insight needs to complete IMS report of this size

Unknown Speaker  23:02
doing into pull ups or that's really all I had actually.

Matthias Miller  23:10
A raw materials report raw

Unknown Speaker  23:11
materials report I think is what Yeah, it makes more sense. Yeah, we've

Matthias Miller  23:14
got that waiting on me to import Yep. Okay,

Speaker 4  23:17
we're seeing progress here. Yeah. Okay. How about undeposited funds reworking account balance diagnostics reports

Matthias Miller  23:29
as far as I know account balance diagnostic is working smashingly

Speaker 4  23:32
well, so we can close it? Yes. Great. For drew the FGI showed drew where to update these percentages will update these percentages called cogs and FTI to change so this was sort of a question I guess this has been resolved.

Matthias Miller  23:50
And good drew Do you remember

Unknown Speaker  23:54
I haven't written down on the paper somewhere Yeah, we're good didn't close out now.

Speaker 4  23:59
Okay great. Mark the FGI it says Send drew raw materials production labor overhead percentages to be entered

Speaker 2  24:13
that's not done but go ahead and get I don't know that that I'd say just remove it from this list because it's it's going to happen by default when we do our actual costing

Speaker 4  24:31
perfect Matthias depreciation and are several of these using standard procedure okay, you enter several of these using standard procedure then see if you can do maths one time upload expedite. Data, I

Matthias Miller  24:48
am waiting on files from Mark for the mass one time okay.

Speaker 4  25:00
Mark, are you aware of that or do I need to add to track? Yep. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
great. I would say dated for

Unknown Speaker  25:14
tomorrow four or five

Unknown Speaker  25:15
okay

Speaker 4  25:22
great. Okay. Actually I should probably add that to your list as well fix that later Okay, where are we at Add View checks link to vendor invoice for Matthias I think is where we're at

Matthias Miller  25:42
let me go pull that up

Matthias Miller  25:59
me I guess never send it over to tonic I'm sending it off to tonic to

Unknown Speaker  26:10
okay

Speaker 2  26:14
order I was curious to see how you're gonna spell that name and you just you know what? BD

Unknown Speaker  26:20
yeah

Speaker 4  26:25
I've at least seen it now maybe so I hearing names and knowing them is not my strong suit unfortunately.

Unknown Speaker  26:38
Jewel ad cash flow statements?

Unknown Speaker  26:40
Is this the sea of red?

Speaker 1  26:51
I do think there's a reasonable likelihood of finishing this by the 15th.

Speaker 1  27:05
I'd like to. Yeah, I'd like to make it make it the 15th to add some pressure on myself. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  27:18
If it's cloudy on the eighth, you can work on it.

Unknown Speaker  27:27
That is the ultimate rainy day.

Speaker 2  27:31
No, I hope it's clear sunny skies for Joel and for Ohio and for everyone along the path.

Matthias Miller  27:38
And hopefully so. Yeah, we'd be we'd be willing to sacrifice one of our 300 sunny days for you guys.

Unknown Speaker  27:53
Alright, Joe, I'll update that. Colorado.

Speaker 4  28:07
Alright, let's see support for importing transaction line items. The pending update and review.

Speaker 2  28:15
Oh, that was probably that thing for Oh, payroll imports, where you wanted to add some be able to add a reference

Unknown Speaker  28:25
number. Yeah. And

Speaker 4  28:32
it says, okay, the transaction export import has columns for both the transaction contact and for the line item contact? Is that what you guys are talking about? This is creating confusion when trying to import. So the proposal was standard import transactions move the change expression to after we delete the old RG rows. Any of that?

Unknown Speaker  28:58
Yeah, that does look like something different.

Matthias Miller  29:00
This was originally the import completely straight. It did not work. And it should be working now. But it sounds to me like somewhere there was I don't know if something got missed. But you guys are wanting to import reference number. What do you what do you want me to import reference number and

Speaker 3  29:24
then the contact? That's right. But I think the contact is going in now. But we were Oh. It was only letting us do one contact for the whole transaction not per line item, which is probably what you're talking about

Matthias Miller  29:41
there. Yeah, that was the fix that we were making. Yeah, that's right. That's the fix we were making to let you

Unknown Speaker  29:47
do Porter line item contacts.

Matthias Miller  29:49
Yes. But was there any other

Speaker 3  29:56
were congratulates number, line item reference and I'm living wills, which, like check number is what we're trying to build.

Matthias Miller  30:06
We'll reference numbers in the current one. And I think this is far enough back that I think this should be fixed. I think this should be over and you guys this court to retry. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Okay then I need to make changes on my side.

Speaker 3  30:24
Yeah. Just put those different names in the line of contact. Let's look at it.

Speaker 4  30:33
Okay, so I'm putting this in Review for Drew. Okay, playas, validate against unlinked ledger accounts. vendor invoices.

Matthias Miller  30:46
Maybe two four.

Matthias Miller  31:00
Requires designs for until March.

Unknown Speaker  31:13
Is that we need to update the date or the timeframe.

Matthias Miller  31:18
Yeah, I mean, middle the end of the month? I don't know what exactly it should be. But at least not in the next two weeks. Okay.

Speaker 4  31:32
Okay, credit memos. 9573.

Matthias Miller  31:37
Firms bump out the no change about the date. Okay. Out of the current.

Speaker 4  31:45
Okay. Mid mid April. Sure. Oh, streamline vendor invoices, meeting payments due today.

Matthias Miller  31:59
Bump it out. Okay. mid April, what what is that streamline

Unknown Speaker  32:04
vendor invoice payment?

Speaker 3  32:07
That's, I'm supposed to make some homework, but it's fine.

Speaker 4  32:17
Okay, so drew we had for today, can bank two sheets integrate with all banks?

Speaker 3  32:27
I don't know. I mean, should we just keep it off the list? Will it work? Well, that's what we're supposed to figure out.

Speaker 2  32:38
Well, how much time will it save? I mean, the thought is that it would save tons of time on reconciles. And, yeah, which portion of your time on reconciles. But

Speaker 3  32:52
well, it would save time. So I'm running into something I think we need to go back to the drawing board just a little bit on how we deal with stuff that like, stuff that they might sometimes on a receipt to AP to be entered. You know, but they haven't yet. So I think we need to relook at how we handle that. And depending how we handle that this fix isn't even gonna isn't gonna

Speaker 2  33:26
help. So should we put this out in June or so and, like, meet and make the manual process work? Well, we know what.

Unknown Speaker  33:40
Okay, wise words when working with software.

Speaker 4  33:46
All right. Sounds good. For Matthias beginning, reconciled balance shifting.

Matthias Miller  33:55
This one gaming, yes. That needs to see. That's when we bumped out

Speaker 4  33:59
did that. Okay, so we've done quite we've done this one for Mark. We've done the reconcile number shifting. Creating a process for moving payments from one SOC to another.

Matthias Miller  34:12
We have reached the point at which we're definitely not working ahead. Everything from here on out is blue sky. Yeah, Dreamland. So I would, given where we're at. I would suggest we just cut it off here and next week or the following week, and maybe next week, if we're in a good place. We can take a look at what what next priority should be.

Speaker 4  34:41
Sure that sounds fair. I've got a couple of change requests there the report for reconciliation 9693. Do we want to add dates to any of these kinds of incoming things or just sort of leave those for now as well?

Matthias Miller  34:58
Three products Good question. We should probably make sure nothing's

Unknown Speaker  35:01
nothing's urgent Maybe

Matthias Miller  35:05
9654 was fixed I'm not sure if it's pending an update or not.

Unknown Speaker  35:11
Okay so

Unknown Speaker  35:21
okay

Matthias Miller  35:24
but you could put that in for next week so that's

Matthias Miller  35:37
it did we get you the report for unreconciled transactions through Wow

Matthias Miller  35:52
very useful

Speaker 3  35:53
No but I think it in either it didn't work or I didn't know how to read it to make sense out of it. Do

Matthias Miller  36:03
you still need something along those lines

Speaker 3  36:07
um I think what I wanted it for I just ended up doing kind of manually so it would be nice it'd be something nice to have but we don't have the urgency on it anymore. So

Matthias Miller  36:27
I mean we yeah, we just pump it out got it? Yeah. Connections multiple email addresses in one RG row

Matthias Miller  36:46
by Jonathan Okay, yeah, this is different. Yeah, this is x FB same issue with zfp. Let's see context and multiple emails in one RG row

Speaker 2  37:00
was related to the the change that Josh call it were some bug that Bangladesh did something with that mess with email sending out a this is

Matthias Miller  37:20
let me see why.

Unknown Speaker  37:23
About a week ago, two weeks ago, maybe there is a big bug that

Matthias Miller  37:32
no, this is let me add a contact type column to this contact type in a guess. So we have vendors. Okay, but why is this? Excuse me? Ben, do you do you know the story on why this is a problem? I don't know. 9664 because basically the story in in zfp is that we've got vendors that where we see ourselves internally whenever we send an email to the vendor which is not a bug it's a feature this one was the 39664 Let me see what no that's the wrong system

Matthias Miller  38:39
opt into this this should be fixed because there's an email validation or cause issues with emails sent to these addresses

Matthias Miller  38:52
there is new okay, I'm slightly worried. I don't know if he should be but slightly worried about us not being able to send emails to vendors because of this, but I don't know if it actually happens.

Speaker 3  39:08
Well, Mark, we got I got I got the emails that go with the ACH is like when we send an ACH and it sends an email out. But I don't recall that I've seen I've seen them too.

Speaker 2  39:26
And when you say sending emails to vendors, you're saying like purchasing, like when karma like we haven't? I'm not aware of that. That usually pops up within a couple hours or a day at the most if we're if that's not working. Okay, I check if they've seen anything but

Matthias Miller  39:49
in Okay, let me see. Let me see from the Okay, let's see. When we last updated. We're still on March 29 Build

Matthias Miller  40:08
should be fixed because there is new email validation that will cause. So it should have I don't know, I feel like alright, what do we want to do? Well,

Speaker 3  40:25
some email addresses just Tuesday, I think. And it all seemed to work just fine. Like, I mean, I had to, I had to write a new line, I had to select it for accounting, like I had to give it a a type, I think is what it is.

Speaker 2  40:48
So and you know, it work, because are you copying? Well?

Unknown Speaker  40:53
No, no, I'm not copied in on it.

Unknown Speaker  40:57
But how do you, oh, you know that hard work, but you're

Speaker 3  41:00
just the entry, the entry work. And I had put my own address in for some wood that we were sending us he has to. And I received to those that was Tuesday or Wednesday. That was last week that I had done that, but I had put some correct email addresses in this week just for new vendors. So I don't know if they got their email. But the entry worked.

Speaker 2  41:25
I can take with him because he's copied on most of the purchasing emails as well. Going to vendors and we can see.

Matthias Miller  41:33
Yeah, there should have been one going up at 630 this morning to Sherwin Williams and Gabe. And that appears to have been sent successfully. I don't know I'm still slightly nervous about what Jonathan was saying about this breaking, but it does appear to me like for whatever reason, it's working. Perhaps because we're not formatting them with names, that might be the issue. I'm gonna guess in our other system where we're including contact names where we format an email trying to send it to one name with multiple emails. Okay, let me let me I think so I think we're good. I think the question is, do we want to see more good and just fix problems when they show up? Then assume that we're probably good on this. Let's do that. That's

Speaker 2  42:34
what we're seeing in purchasing everything is working fine. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  42:44
So we're gonna go ahead and close it. Or doing it do something else to resolve this.

Matthias Miller  42:58
I want to follow up with Jonathan still and throw it back in his court and be like

Unknown Speaker  43:08
okay, great.

Speaker 4  43:13
Want to add a date range to it, or just keep it where it's at for now. It's up for now it's fine. And then use the report for transactions not reconciled?

Matthias Miller  43:26
Or you can bump it out? I don't know, end of month or something and let's circle back and it's okay. It's about getting something put together

Speaker 4  43:42
great, then we're done. Okay, awesome. I'll jump off. And you guys have a great day.

Unknown Speaker  43:49
Thank you. Thank you. Bye

Matthias Miller  44:02
All right, let me see the one team is on this team as well. Believe.

Unknown Speaker  44:13
And are there actually things that that I should be involved in? Or do I take the cash flow job and rot?

Matthias Miller  44:36
I can't think of anything that involves you, Mark and Drew, can you this is all year end. Reporting and reconciling.

Speaker 1  44:48
Cool. Well, best wishes and hopes were clear skies for all.

Speaker 2  44:58
Weekend Yeah, next We can see, we can discuss who? We didn't know. Yes,

Speaker 1  45:05
indeed. All right. Well have a terrific remainder of the day. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye

Matthias Miller  45:22
All right. We pull up the agenda that we have

Matthias Miller  45:33
Okay, here's a little fun fact I'm not sure how this is going to impact us. But Josh is out this week. He said we can run an update if Dwayne's okay with it. And I can deal with fallout from anything on the platform. He can't vouch for where the platform is at. The good news is we're nearing the end of the development cycle, which means that either people are cramming to get fixes in for let's see what's actually been cutters on Tuesday, right? It's been a sprint review and Friday? Well, yes. So people are supposed to generally be winding things down and making things be more stable, not, not less. But most is slightly nervous. I don't really like having the monkey on my back. So we won't have to talk about what we want to do with that.

Matthias Miller  46:31
So I think we can maybe just jump in and see what's required, and then circle back around to that as needed.

Speaker 2  46:45
So I just wanted to go through this and see where we're at with with this. And then I know that Drew has some things as well. So this was just notes from our last meeting, I think, yeah, or the meeting Monday.

Speaker 2  47:11
Okay, on undeposited funds, or as far as waiting on land that ended up going back into Drew's court making those changes, those changes have all been made. And so we should be good to move ahead with that what we have been holding off on for that. So but undeposited funds, I don't think there's anything to do with that. At the moment, after to make those changes, you sent me an updated report, which changed the numbers slightly like we expected to only for vinyl structures. So and then at some point, we want to create a standard report. I don't Well, yeah, not urgent. So we've got that on our radar for future right to create a standard report.

Unknown Speaker  48:02
customer deposits. Again, create a standard report with Dwayne's changes to be used in future.

Speaker 2  48:12
And then I asked him only transactions, so I sent you these Yeah, those should still be legit, even with the changes we've. We made. So any any update on like

Matthias Miller  48:34
I wanted to talk about this a little bit.

Matthias Miller  48:41
We talked about like, I think that can we maybe actually first before we get to customer deposits, jump down and answer my question on to a regarding quotes. So we sometimes record payments on quotes.

Speaker 2  49:11
Why, like should we even allow it to record a payment on a quote?

Matthias Miller  49:19
Well, that's a fair question. I don't know why.

Unknown Speaker  49:25
There is at that point, it should be turned to sailors.

Speaker 2  49:29
Yeah, and what what? What does it require the turn? What's required to turn a quote into a sales order?

Matthias Miller  49:41
I assume that happened somehow through the dealer portal. But

Speaker 2  49:45
I mean, this this is probably a Josh question. But yeah, that's going back one step further than what you had. The question you were asking I think but they also create Some messes

Speaker 2  50:08
like they show up in some sometimes we have these quote quote with payments and some partial information show up in the wrong place so I'm wondering if

Matthias Miller  50:22
no I mean here's a very recent 120 sevens sold by Scott

Matthias Miller  50:33
let's go to the building Bill building has a deadline data for eight but this thing has not turned into a sales order hold check until Thursday so I guess somebody gave a check or waiting for the clear I don't I mean, I don't know what it is

Matthias Miller  51:07
said dealer services, here's a wholesale building not sure why this one isn't the affordable barns just the one I want the this one is a quote. So

Speaker 2  51:28
the same sample, my sample idea would be that you shouldn't be able to record a payment on anything other than it has to be turned into a sales order. So is that a Josh's question Should we go back and ask him about that but how does that affect you on

Matthias Miller  51:48
Okay, so currently we said that no payments on sales orders ever get recorded on accounting and accounting is that do you still stand by that

Unknown Speaker  51:59
one Okay, say that again? Sorry. I was even

Matthias Miller  52:03
if even if you put a payment on a sales order we will or I'm sorry even if you put a payment on a quote no quotes ever have any accounting impact even if you put payments on him?

Speaker 2  52:17
Well, I think that's how it should be. And so if we go back and then follow that logic he makes that fix then that would fix that then everything would be good stay intact with how you have with what you just said, right?

Matthias Miller  52:37
Yeah, I think so. Good. Can

Speaker 2  52:38
you send me a copy of this this quote the one you have up right now? And I will just I have it for to review with guys. Blaine there's no sales or No, that's a quote if it starts with a cue

Speaker 2  53:06
because they they have had made messes and finished goods inventory and like customer deposits and all of those areas like

Matthias Miller  53:18
Yeah, well, one of the worst things too would be for building actually getting built when it's linked to a well I mean, if it's, it's a customer building that gets built and it's linked to a quote that also Sounds like trouble. Okay, so that's helpful I will LET'S DO THIS IS A quotes I'm just going to quickly send a quick reply to myself for our discussion. We will chat with here for discussion mark will talk to Josh about this allowing payments we will continue excluding all quotes from counting that way at least

Speaker 3  54:13
so if we follow that make that fix would he be turning all historical boats that have payments into like just leave everything as it is except for turn it into a sales order then those would all hit accounting or or we just leave the historical as it is and

Speaker 2  54:31
forward. I was assuming he would was hoping he would planning that he would leave historical as as he is and just put that fix in place moving forward would because I think if he does it he turns those into sales orders. We'll have a bunch of other issues. I think

Speaker 3  54:53
this is gonna create a bunch of Christians warm so we're ready to go through.

Speaker 2  54:57
Wow, I think so. So but nothing What are you gonna do with those? Are you just gonna say, you're just gonna figure a way out to blur out the the payments on those old quotes then? Well,

Matthias Miller  55:10
okay, so that raises the next question. If we push an update, which would kind of sort of be probably okay with doing this evening that I can, I can loosen up. Okay, currently I don't have currently we were too strict on payment on write offs. And we can't do write offs on all of the ones that we want to get rid of. But if we do an update, I can, I can loosen that up. And we can add write offs to get rid of customer deposits. With one exception, that there are some of these that are linked to deposits already, I'm gonna guess it's a catch all deposit, which means that if I unlink them, it will change the deposit total, which means that it will rewrite that it'll shift your reconciliation, starting balance. So as long as you're good with that, I can unlink it from the deposit into a

Speaker 3  56:13
well, if you want them cleaned up, that's it, let's do that. Because you know, all of those kinds of things are all those big, clean up transaction, it's really are just a matter of saying, Oh, our balance was off now by you know, 150,000, find my big cleanup transaction and change it in 50,000, more or less as needed, and then we match it. Like, we have everything. I think we have our ending balance nailed down, and we're reconciled past it. So we just need that starting balance to be correct. And we just always go back and bring it to 1231. Balance back to where it's supposed to be.

Matthias Miller  57:09
All right. So I think the answer is

Unknown Speaker  57:11
stop doing that.

Matthias Miller  57:15
It would be nice. It would be nice.

Unknown Speaker  57:20
So yeah, Ron.

Matthias Miller  57:24
So my vote is I'll communicate with Dwayne, I'm relatively comfortable running an update today. And we'll just have to deal with the fallout if it happens. I don't know what else did well, we could also be the last one is running up to tonight deal with the fallout we should be okay, we're getting towards the very end of the development cycle, things really should be winding down. Getting less crazy, not more. If there is a good time to do an unsupervised This is probably the best time of the six week cycle to do it.

Speaker 2  58:06
When you say a cycle, is that a weakness? You said? Is it a six week cycle?

Matthias Miller  58:10
Six weeks, every six weeks, there's a there's a six week development cycle. And then on Tuesday, Tuesday's the end of it. So everything's supposed to be stable. I mean, developers are supposed to be wanting things down at the end of this week, actually, like by Friday. But we don't really have anybody with deep insight into what's going on in the platform at the moment.

Speaker 3  58:34
Do you need? I mean, you have we have 2023 balanced numbers. All that we need. Right? What we're needing to do next is come up with starting 24 numbers in assist. Do we actually need those tomorrow? I mean, I don't think I don't think we're really going to have them tomorrow.

Speaker 2  59:05
Even even if they make us because of the adjustment you have to make the

Unknown Speaker  59:10
adjustments we have to make. I mean, we I guess we made

Speaker 2  59:20
that. Okay, well, what this this is the only way to clear out the this is the only way to start one 124 with only the transactions we wish to keep right?

Matthias Miller  59:36
Well, okay, there's, there are two, we have a few options. Number one, we can do write offs on all historical sales orders. And that requires an update. To open things up. Number two, we can create duplicates of E It's a line item with the same date and a neck and the reverse of the mount with a note that says that we're reversing this. And so for all of these sales orders, we basically have duplicates. Number three, we can push to accounting, set the cut off date, and then go back and just void these transactions that we don't want to have anymore. And by virtue of doing that, so what that doesn't do is if you have any, if these, if these somehow happen to show up in any AR reports, well, they're still going to keep showing up there even when they're not supposed to. But it'll get rid of the transactions and accounting. Number three is probably the easiest solution that lets us go sooner rather than later, as long as we're fine. Not having those cleaned up. I mean, if that's the level of detail, we're happy with historic.

Speaker 2  1:00:56
So does that. Does that kind of lead us into the AR question? Like how do we keep only those transactions like?

Matthias Miller  1:01:13
Right, because on AR we want to be wanting these to come off of AR right.

Speaker 2  1:01:24
Yeah, but although I don't? Well, the AR report that you've created is correct. Okay. The, I don't know what accounting shows there. Well, with

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
the AR report what I was planning to do, and I was operating under the assumption that the AR report was fine. So what I was planning to do was with customer deposits, I was planning to clean up before a freeze. Now if we just want to avoid those transactions, then we can do the African freeze with the AR, I was going to freeze and avoid the historical ones, so they don't show up again.

Speaker 2  1:02:03
Okay, and we could do the same thing with customer deposits. What we wouldn't have is if we go to the actual sales order, it wouldn't that the sales order would still show exactly what it shows today show incorrectly. Correct? I would probably just okay, that approach does not require an update, right? Correct. I would be fine with with that approach, I think I don't know if if

Speaker 2  1:02:42
you're basically going to go through after you freeze the historical numbers. So you're going to free say customer deposits, all those transactions, nothing can change there. Nothing can change based on what what's done to sales orders, you know, you create a historical sales order, no historical payment, it can't create, it can't add a customer deposit. And then you'll just go in and delete, basically delete or remove all all the transactions we no longer want. And by doing that, you will end up with the same balance that's that I had on my customer deposits. Or you should that is correct. And then moving forward. But the ones I'm concerned about are the legit sales orders that So moving forward, when that turns when that's invoice then that will still you know create a whatever and offsetting transaction moves to AR all that will still work just fine right

Matthias Miller  1:04:04
yeah, for anything. For anything, anything post the new year. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:04:11
Yeah. So like it was a sales order back then. And it has a deposit on and 23 You can't deposit but if you change the thing to an invoice today that would say, Oh, we moved money to accounts receivable now. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:04:31
right. Yes.

Speaker 2  1:04:36
I think that should work. I mean, I would be more comfortable if we could just do a quick look at the actual transactions and just talk through a few of those maybe, like if we would look at it. Well, could could we look at I can pull it up too, but like a customer. Like pick a sales order that's listed on one of my reps. ports and just talk through what that would do.

Matthias Miller  1:05:05
Like one of them that you want to keep. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
Or do you want I can get one

Matthias Miller  1:05:13
you can actually have a

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
let me actually AR district tax. Let's just to do this one

Matthias Miller  1:05:37
there it is. Okay. So here's the one that we want to keep back from 1011 23. This is for gravel base. Let's start with the balance due.

Speaker 2  1:05:56
So this one still has a balance student has not been in. Okay. No, but this one has been getting. Are we looking at AR?

Matthias Miller  1:06:03
I'm sorry, you're wanting to look at? I'm sorry, you wanted to look like this

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
one on customer deposits? First.

Matthias Miller  1:06:10
Yep. Sorry, deposit. All right, let me share this one too, so you can see it. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:06:30
This one deposit of 27.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
One deposit at the end of the year that we're carrying over. So how does this look on?

Speaker 2  1:07:02
Okay, so you would be you would keep the can you keep the first? Okay, so we would start on one 124. II would have the 7701 debit and undeposited funds? And that the credit and customer? Deposit? No, the undeposited funds would have moved out already. Yeah, that would but separately 7701 in customer deposits, and the other side of the transaction would be the bank account or whatever. And then when on 131 When it's in invoice, then we have an offsetting we have Yeah, we debit and customer deposits, which clears that out. And that will all still continue. We will Yeah. Because all the changes we're seeing all the future changes are going to happen in 2024. So yeah. Good. I mean, is there a downside? Okay, the only downside is that we'll have sales orders that are, quote, canceled sales orders and quotes that will have a payment recorded but not know, right? Oh, for Yeah. No, I, I think this is this is good. Good. And then AR will be. So you're going to do the exact same thing with AR right. Yes, correct. Yeah. Good. So how does timeframe on that? What what are you?

Matthias Miller  1:08:56
I mean, I think I should be able to do that two day.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
Okay, on both of these Well,

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
okay. I think so.

Speaker 2  1:09:09
So does that mean you'll be freezing? Okay, through that. I think that was a question you had does that mean? You'll be freezing

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
on a three today then you'll have to freeze that before you can get rid of

Matthias Miller  1:09:25
correct. So have you guys made any changes today that you want to push push pushed into 2023 numbers?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:36
Any changes? Um,

Speaker 3  1:09:40
no, I have not. What would

Unknown Speaker  1:09:44
AR have changed with the changes you made on those those those

Speaker 3  1:09:53
deposits or to premiums? That would have happened to three days? I mean not that's already been through the update cycle. Because I did that on Monday or Tuesday. So any changes that that would push over would already be done?

Speaker 2  1:10:10
I think Matthias, what I should do is I should take a quick the file, are you planning to work off of the file, the ER files that I sent you? Because I had some, a few, like five or six miscellaneous things there that didn't know what districts they belong to that I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
was just going to, I'm not sure what you're going to do with those I didn't even I was just going to get rid of, I think what I'd like to do is take

Speaker 2  1:10:39
I'd like to send you another new district X and of your AR, you sent me that file, I want to take a quick look at it, make sure that it all works with what the information we have, and I'll send you a new file there. I expect it's going to be exactly the same. But when you when you make your use that as your reference to what transactions to delete, then that's good.

Speaker 2  1:11:14
Which I should be able to do that? Pretty directly here. So finished goods inventory. Probably got your everything you need it there is. Is that also an update for today's?

Matthias Miller  1:11:29
Yeah, I mean, I think I think I should be able to do that. You see a bunch of Yeah, challenge with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40
Okay, yeah, this means and then the asset management

Speaker 2  1:11:53
do we need that established? Yeah, we need that just stablished starting balances for our assets on our balance sheet, right. My, what I don't have there is I haven't listed for the depreciation expenses are like going through and saying this mural is used for logistics, or it's used in production for this trailer is used for logistics and production. So I'm a little doubtful that I can have that. Today yet, I can try. But But what I was hoping to do is it would be ideal if we can have all of these updated, you know, by tomorrow morning, so that then I think it would, it might correct through that at that point. The only thing left to do to get our starting balances correct would be to for you to make those big journal entry is to clear out old stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:13:04
Or adjust the ones that are elevated. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:13:08
And that's, I feel once were.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:11
Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2  1:13:13
But you need you really need the asset management piece as well before you mean, you want to do those four together? Probably. Before you

Speaker 2  1:13:30
are thinking about that? Do they not all have the same? The

Matthias Miller  1:13:38
Okay, let me let me go back. Do you have the Asset Management Group IDs in there yet? Do I have what? The Asset Management IDs

Speaker 2  1:13:48
No, I have to add those yet but I'm just going to come up with the use your own Yeah, that won't take long but it's it's the the depreciation I should be able to get that for you today. I'm going to be working a little later tonight. So yeah. I'll get that file over to you today,

Matthias Miller  1:14:15
if at all possible.

Speaker 2  1:14:21
I mean, how do you feel about that through then as far as Matthias makes those updates? Like at what well, can you proud of the bigger thing bigger than the updates is is making so what do you call that that where you're making or you're freezing on a three?

Matthias Miller  1:14:49
Being it's changing the accounting impact. Effective Date. That's the how to I guess.

Speaker 2  1:14:57
I mean, that's probably the biggest thing that that is the big one really like that point forward.

Matthias Miller  1:15:06
We, I mean, there's nothing that stops us from doing that right now, right? I don't think so. So everything got pushed over last night and mean, here we go.

Speaker 2  1:15:23
So that means only Matthias And Drew can make changes that affect historical transactions, right? Basically

Speaker 3  1:15:32
you have to, you're only writing accounting transactions, nothing's gonna push over. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:15:38
any anybody could go in and write Dwayne could go in and write a bunch of accounting. No, I don't think anybody

Speaker 3  1:15:44
we're technically not closing or locking accounting. We're just we're just unhooking it. Yes, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:15:52
exactly. Well, good. Exactly.

Speaker 3  1:15:57
So that's 2320 23 trailer just got the hook through the truck

Matthias Miller  1:16:03
hopefully the truck is new investments the trailer isn't anything

Speaker 2  1:16:09
good so that covers what I had I think like what else are we missing through just that and you're adjusting here? Well, there's a

Speaker 3  1:16:20
few of those internal loans equity account Oh asset like some of that internal loan money moving back and forth accounts need to be Yeah, I

Speaker 2  1:16:35
still owe you an outline on on that. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:16:41
So anyway, some of that stuff still needs like really set up some of those balance like your Burkholder vehicles should be split out individually

Speaker 2  1:16:51
and all of that you can get should be able to get all of that from Whitney's 23 ending balance sheet Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:16:58
yeah, that's fine. Like we're just gonna end the mouse shift and when they we should know exactly what accounts we need to create this is gonna take some time good

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
cool to drink

Speaker 3  1:17:17
yeah on the reconciles that reconcile report thing you Yeah, I think there was an item that you already had on reworking the reconcile report

Unknown Speaker  1:17:32
to look

Unknown Speaker  1:17:37
depending need for me to grow enough

Matthias Miller  1:17:55
see it's shifting, shifting reconciliation event log

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14
or was it it's

Speaker 3  1:18:17
um, it has to do with the report like you had kind of it hadn't really been working at all showing any numbers and then you had reworked it just so it does when we kind of left to those newly more refining

Matthias Miller  1:18:29
the the pretty agenda unreconciled transactions is that what it was? Well, it's

Speaker 3  1:18:36
like a printout what I was trying to do is a print of the reconcile event I guess reconcile event Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:18:44
Yeah. Let's just pull this up

Matthias Miller  1:18:59
okay, so go into here.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
If you just get one that's reconciled already.

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
Okay. So we'll thing delude

Speaker 3  1:19:14
but the thing that I just saw, is it does not show uncleared transactions that are after the date. So if you scroll down to the bottom, there's probably there so there's unreconciled items. But those are the unreconciled from within the period of the reconciliation. So it should also be showing stuff that, you know, a February item that's unreconciled like it's still on the account and it's still unreconciled

Matthias Miller  1:20:00
Do you want separate groups are just sorted by date? Like we have it

Speaker 3  1:20:05
just by date, I think would be fine. Let me just because occasionally there's something that's dated later that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
yeah, it's it helps for finding an item that was you know, shouldn't have been in this reconcile and wasn't or was it shouldn't have been some of that.

Matthias Miller  1:20:35
Trying to figure out how that's been filtered out though. Count Transaction Date? Well, that's how it's in range and

Speaker 3  1:20:52
not it should be, it should be all unreconciled like before, after anything that's unreconciled

Matthias Miller  1:21:03
Do you want to see transactions that were reconciled in a future period?

Speaker 3  1:21:10
Um, if they were actually reconciled I mean, so So technically, that should never happen. You shouldn't have something being reconciled in the future you know, like the only time that's gonna happen is if we open up an old one and we have to throw in something in it and we you know, so I would tend to say not if it's if it's reconciled in a different period just omit it but

Matthias Miller  1:21:54
All right, let's do this change reconcile report to know all unreconciled transactions current behavior the reconcile report shows all transactions from the selected period as well as all transactions as well as all transactions within the statement, date range that are unreconciled or from a future period when to be requested behavior. The reconcile report shows all transactions from the selected period as well as all transactions all and transactions regardless of the range

Matthias Miller  1:23:11
and let's take this off, mutual sign off and then let's add rationale. The only time this new ones matters is when you're pulling up a historic historical

Matthias Miller  1:23:48
let me let me apply it to read pestrol Make sure he doesn't object as it's organic change and then it's gonna be over to tag

Matthias Miller  1:24:31
this is a non urgent but nice to have or how would you describe

Speaker 3  1:24:36
right now you know, um, well, part of what it is is I got there, they're getting some of the things in the wrong account. So I have to kind of have by reconciles, open at the same time. So we're constantly going back and forth. Like between the different accounts, you know, so Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice to have, but it doesn't have to happen. Now I'm thinking I'm dealing with so.

Speaker 3  1:25:23
One other question that I have. If you're not done, that's fine. Yeah. Um, is there a way so I only backup. Normally, when there's a purchase order, and the product is not received, the invoice date has to wait until after the product is received. So, so let's say you ordered it on April 1, product wasn't received until April 15. They have to date the invoice as April 15. Because that's when it receives they can't dated for April 1. Now is there. I'm running into issues with prepaid items. So they pay with four with a credit card, but they don't receive it for two months. So now it's on a statement way back two months ago. But the system says assist says wages just bought this, you know, so I have something going in and racking an account reconcile for the credit card statement in, say in January, but but the invoice didn't come to us, we didn't have this the purchase actually in assist until March. Because of that that date block because we didn't receive it. So is there a way and maybe it's what we need to talk about how we're going to deal with the issue, but I just thought I would see if if we could say okay, we have a prepaid item here, or we have this, these particular payment methods. Therefore, override that block and allow me to date it back in the old, you know, the date of the purchase of the invoice. Because it's a it's a prepaid credit card payment type rather than some unpaid, if that makes sense.

Matthias Miller  1:27:44
At the time that you enter the credit card transaction, do you know what you're going to buy?

Speaker 3  1:27:54
They would Yes. Because they're, they're receiving the invoice. Yeah, see, the problem is it shows up on the credit card statement. Like, so let's say they purchase something, and it's not going to it's not going to show up for two months. The invoice and I'm not sure when he actually receives that invoice, but it goes on the credit card immediately. And if they receive that invoice immediately I suppose they probably could enter it and well, they don't know when No, they can't. They can't connect it because they haven't received the PIO.

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
Right, because until two months later,

Speaker 3  1:28:53
what the issue is, is I can't I can't come close within about two months and reconciling some of these transactions. I mean, some of these credit card accounts, like I can't keep them very current because I don't. Yeah, anyway, if if that is a possibility, then we might look into using that if if that's not a possibility, then we might need to work to keep thinking about how to make this work.

Matthias Miller  1:29:25
We could do at the time of the charge for you to Pio for two months out and you know it's wrong but

Speaker 3  1:29:38
Well, one thing I thought about is creating an invoice. I create an invoice of that amount, put it in just a miscellaneous line item. We'd have to have a way that if they go to create this vendor invoice that they now received now can enter it say oh, that has that number? Well, I don't even always have a number, you know, that already exists, I just need to find that one. And now I need to connect it to these POS and I need to change this miscellaneous line item. Like, re, that that would be the right way to do it. Now it's gonna take a variety of educating to actually make so that it works properly, and then to do their entry properly. Because I'm, I'm actually writing vendor invoices before we ever received them, before we received the product, we just say, We know we've spent this money, that it would be nice if we could keep that date. You know, I can write that date, it's gonna be miscellaneous. So so that day, it's not going to care. When they go to hook it to a Pio down the road, it's gonna say, Oh, you have to change the date. Which by then it's probably already reconciled, and we'd prefer to the date change, because it's already been on income statements, and it's been all over the place.

Matthias Miller  1:31:04
Well, couldn't we expand our duplicate check? To include prepaid. And verified.

Matthias Miller  1:31:24
Like, if you are looking for duplicate invoices, I haven't thought through all the details of this. But basically, if you're looking for duplicate invoices, you check for anything with the same vendor and amount within the past three months, who are also that's also prepaid and verified.

Speaker 3  1:31:44
And then, and then I would just write these now. I mean, I guess I can write these as prepaid on verified, but then they're gonna verify them when they come through. And they're probably going to be switched to paid. So they might say, well, we didn't receive anything. And let it sit there.

Matthias Miller  1:32:10
So what's the prepaid? The prepaid? What's the verification process for for? Basically, these go back out to the district manager or somebody who says, oh, yeah, we wanted to prepay that that's good. Is that what the verification processes? Well,

Speaker 3  1:32:26
basically, it's more of a notification. It's just saying, Sure, you made this purchase, we made this purchase. You know, they're basically just saying I'm aware that you made this purchase or to it but there's not just a lot more to it

Matthias Miller  1:32:45
means you could

Matthias Miller  1:32:57
we could add another flag on here that says, basically, I'm orphan from my Pio. I need a Pio.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:11
And they could just look through

Matthias Miller  1:33:12
those. Well, then the verification would also just look for, do you have any vendor invoices needing a PIO and as this vendor invoice that you're entering? Match the amount of that one? The vendor and the amount regardless of date?

Speaker 3  1:33:28
Well, actually, I would probably go well, yeah, it's just the amounts don't always match because they made one purchase and then they invoice twice because they split the order up or I mean it all that it is, it is nothing but problems.

Matthias Miller  1:33:59
I'm hoping we're getting some good rates and whatever we're buying because of it.

Speaker 3  1:34:02
Right? That is That is definitely the case. It's just like and the dumb thing is is like so take like Lowe's Lowe's is one of them, you know, they have their their credit card, you use their credit card to buy their stuff. And you call them with an order and so they charge the credit card. Then they go and see if they actually have all the stuff to put this order together. Like I have the computer probably said they have it but so then they then they come back and say oh well we actually can only ship you so many so then they try to do a refund to the credit card and so then you're trying to match this refund and this charge goes together to make this purchase order and it's just it's pain. Anyway But I wonder if it might It might actually not be a bad idea to have a report of where you can. And they just know for these particular vendors, which it's only a few vendors, these particular vendors, you go check the report the list of orphaned, I mean of, of invoices with no POS, and see if maybe one of those isn't what you're actually needing here. That might, that might be about as good as anything, because because invariably, the duplicate thing is gonna miss it, because something's not the same as we're expecting. And it's, and I would write these, I would write the invoice. In that particular case, I actually have an invoice number, I could put in the invoice number I put the date of the purchase, when they received that vendor invoice from the vendor. It should have an original purchase date. And they could say, okay, these dates line up, the amounts different, but I have nothing else close. So it must have been this one. And then they made needed for that. But

Matthias Miller  1:36:15
then how do you want to handle the the amount of discrepancies because you don't want them to go back because that was the actual charge, they actually charged you for that amount,

Speaker 3  1:36:22
right? They have to change the PIO then to match or write a miscellaneous line within that too. So because now part of the reason why it's such a problem is because they're changing invoices to match POS. And we need it, we need it to be the other way around. Because the invoice is what they're actually charged on the credit card. So the purchase order needs to be manipulated to match the invoice, because that's actually what we paid. So that's part of the reason why I think if we if we had the invoice first. Okay, we got this paper, oh, yeah, this amount has to stay the same? Where are my POs that I can attach to this thing?

Speaker 3  1:37:24
That I think they would basically have to know what they can change, and what they cannot change. You know, and if it just flat doesn't line up, then here's what you do. That kind of thing? Because, I mean, there are, there are just those that didn't line up. I mean, in the, in the grand scheme of things, usually, you know, over a couple months, you would look at it, it would all shake out. But how to know exactly which invoice it is that they refunded for which part of which Pio is almost impossible

Matthias Miller  1:38:10
if you keep the purchase price the same.

Matthias Miller  1:38:18
A little confused, if you keep the purchase price the same, you manipulate the PIO that's going to skew your inventory values are what am I missing? Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:25
Right.

Matthias Miller  1:38:29
It I mean, right?

Speaker 3  1:38:32
Yeah, it can. Now, your inventory. Like if you have missed something on a miscellaneous line item, I mean, non miscellaneous, non purchase order expense line item like this one here that you have up. If there's a Pio attached, and you put 50 bucks in that non Pio section, that doesn't change your inventory values doesn't, right?

Matthias Miller  1:39:00
No, you're right. So you have to say, so you'd have a non Pio or expense of some kind of miscellaneous, we overpaid for something there's a refund coming line item, and then you issue another vendor invoice for the actual refund that goes back to that. Mm hmm.

Speaker 3  1:39:21
Gotcha. You know, and if there were a way to tie this, tie them all together, why that would be great. But I don't know. That's the part of it is sometimes you want them to go back and change the PIO value. You know, because the price came out different because of transport or whatever you want to put that on there.

Speaker 3  1:39:56
So, I don't know. I mean, it's not something to try to straight now right now I

Matthias Miller  1:40:01
have an idea whatever credit memos could be, if we would have the idea of credit memos affecting balance, this is a reverse credit memo. And it really ultimately shows up as a as an asset on your account, because yeah. And so just take the credit memos, if we design credit memos to also not just allow you to handle credits, but also handle positive balances, then you actually invoice it when you get the invoice and you assign the PIO when you get the PIO and you're just putting money into this account. And, and you debit against it once you actually have the payment.

Speaker 3  1:40:47
Right, right. Well, I mean, except for we're doing the payment first. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:40:51
I'm sorry, yeah, you're

Speaker 3  1:40:55
getting the payment first, and then the invoice shows up and like, oh, yeah, we made this payment two months ago. Or at least money for it,

Matthias Miller  1:41:03
money for it. So we apply the money that we put in towards this, which should zero out the invoice balance. And

Speaker 3  1:41:14
then if it doesn't zero out, at the end of the month, or whatever we decide what do we do with the extra $3.42? Here that's somehow different between what we paid and what we our purchase price?

Matthias Miller  1:41:27
Right. Vendor balances. That's the I think that's what we should do?

Speaker 3  1:41:36
Yes, I think so to that, that gives us It allows us to do the purchase order invoicing, the way we always have. And allows us to reconcile the credit card and just gives us a gap space in between to make up the difference.

Matthias Miller  1:41:55
And bonus points, it actually reflects what's happening, right?

Speaker 3  1:42:03
Well, we're not sure quite if the invoice thing really is actually what's happening, but

Matthias Miller  1:42:12
it's at least closer than some of the hand wavy stuff we're looking at. Okay, so let's put that on the keep that in mind when we get the credit memos. It's

Speaker 3  1:42:24
on our radar. Yeah, once we get these numbers, why the credit memo thing is kind of the next big thing to hit. I think once we get these cool, balanced numbers done, so. Yeah. All right. Thank you. You're

Matthias Miller  1:42:37
welcome. Thanks. You too.
