Unknown Speaker  04:59
Morning Are you going to say

Unknown Speaker  05:16
hello

Unknown Speaker  05:30
last march again when we died

Unknown Speaker  05:45
mail

Speaker 1  06:27
just got an email is that are we doing 145 So I had to I had to stop Zoom and come back in because it was just waiting was just running saying that

Speaker 2  06:39
you were gonna let me in yeah you I sent him an email telling him that many technical difficulties were here but I had there's something goofy with my computer and internet gotcha everything?

Unknown Speaker  08:14
Sorry about the technical difficulties?

Speaker 3  08:18
Oh, no, that was the one that canceled on the first or worse the meeting back in the first place

Unknown Speaker  08:27
all right

Speaker 2  08:36
anything you need to

Speaker 3  08:46
know I think I have two items on the agenda and then if we have time are you good till 230 If we have time we could take a look at I have a number of Billings on that sales orders meeting invoicing report that troubleshoot that that are showing up that believes should not be showing up and just I think the key there is to go through figure out the root causes change on a Tyria. That right, but I would say I would suggest from my side at least that's what I have is the the details on all the two items on the agenda and then through some of those sales orders meeting invoicing but we have anything on on your side.

Speaker 2  09:54
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

Speaker 3  10:03
Did you have a chance to look at the details on living out the net pay amount?

Unknown Speaker  10:15
I did think

Unknown Speaker  10:29
so

Unknown Speaker  10:36
I want to we currently handling this shareholder shareholder thing

Unknown Speaker  10:47
let me just send you some words from Whitney it's

Speaker 3  11:04
probably, I mean, I think it's being handled correctly from what I can tell. So what I'm sending you is a pay stub for an employee that's currently doing that. Along with like a quick report, close the transaction was added to this note holder account. So in a sense, it almost works like a 401k. Wow. Similar I mean, there's no employ or manage but guaranteed

Unknown Speaker  11:56
in this case

Unknown Speaker  12:06
in this case if we have automatic deduction

Unknown Speaker  12:15
which works until net pay is less than the deduction amount?

Speaker 2  12:27
Well, no, because yeah, that would work because then the deduction would be tied out to the shareholder account. And.

Unknown Speaker  12:54
And we'd have some kind of way to

Unknown Speaker  13:07
don't know what this message

Speaker 2  13:15
when it gets when it gets to negative, negative gets messy, you

Speaker 3  13:23
know, if it was negative, then it would create a mess.

Speaker 2  13:35
Yeah. Like would you just have I mean, can we just say if your case they, for some reason does not earn $100 that the that the

Unknown Speaker  13:59
payroll team will just adjust it down to zero?

Speaker 3  14:07
Well, I would, I would think so.

Unknown Speaker  14:18
But I would expect Yeah, I mean, if we, if we try to make

Speaker 3  14:32
or how hard would it be to say that if it goes? Well, no, it could never, that could never go negative. Like you're never you're never going to write take money away from an employee and not pay him anything at all. No, yeah.

Speaker 2  14:49
Well, I mean, if that is and that's an overpayment, which has to do with three separate process, as defined by state law in terms of how you I forget the date varies from state to state, but I'll see you catch and how much you can make them pay back and how fast you can let them do that. So that wouldn't go through the payroll module, it would go through some kind of one off accounting. Well, one off process.

Speaker 3  15:17
So it okay, if we could you set the? Oh, I don't know. It could you that, in Dave's example, it only it It defaults to 100 Unless net pay is less than 200? Let's say it would be 150 or 120, which could be the case be 20 just works one day? Or it could be if it's less than 200, then it just defaults to zero. No, would that be

Speaker 2  16:02
oh, we're gonna automatically adding the deduction to the timecard when we set up the timecard so it's not until after we enter hours in the timecard that we know whether we should have the deduction on whether or not I mean, we could we could have rules for the detection that say this detection ranges from $0 up to $200 and then have an auto calculate what the actual detection amount is. But

Speaker 3  16:32
I think we just leave it as a manual process. The payroll people just manage that and this ideally, this the what we're talking about here would be on say the accountants site like on Drew's site where

Speaker 3  16:57
talk about permissions and I know we're not spend a lot of time on that but I think the end goal is work like Accounts Payable is for the people in Dwayne's office to do all the work up to everything but paying doing that up getting it ready for Drew to pay and the same would go with go entering SIM card hours all those details make sure that everything's correct. But then who's running payroll he would be the one that would be setting the payout it's and also editing those payout numbers then Dave's example if it were net pay was $150 going in and editing that manually managing that is think is the end goal now I'm not

Unknown Speaker  18:11
that's pretty high level but

Unknown Speaker  18:17
so what's your what is your

Speaker 3  18:25
bot okay when a client let you know because you've been thinking how to build this the implications what works what won't

Speaker 2  18:35
yeah the shareholder but it only only would do is change deductions to either be percentage or dollar dollar amount based and then you can just play out you can have a note holder investment investment deduction

Unknown Speaker  18:54
that that is in the new expense you would still debit direct labor but then you would credit their say since I get older now well no, because each each employee has a separate they're older. Yes

Unknown Speaker  19:27
they do. Yes. It functions like a loan not like a loan but I mean Oh yeah, it does. It's we treat it like a private loan basically. And yes, they would have their own

Speaker 2  19:54
does that doesn't actually work.

Speaker 3  20:00
In just a moment I did

Speaker 2  20:07
well but then it really required two things one being able to override the account for a deduction on the employee record

Unknown Speaker  20:20
in the end the timecards as well as allowing deduction to be dollar or percentage based

Unknown Speaker  20:39
now the other option

Unknown Speaker  20:47
would be to have not used deductions for this but use the idea of

Unknown Speaker  21:05
yeah just use basically use the same idea that we had with the same remaining balance kind of idea but say don't actually pay out the

Speaker 2  21:24
primary I don't really like that either because that's not going to show up in the payslips correctly

Speaker 2  21:41
well or maybe it should maybe it doesn't matter so you would win it comes down to payment it would show

Unknown Speaker  22:05
perhaps a

Unknown Speaker  22:20
Okay, here's here's the way it was worth instead of the idea of a remainder account if we flip the terminology a little bit where this is the

Speaker 2  22:36
almost like the burnishes in turn, but like the garnish account or basically like automatic savings, where you specify a percentage or dollar amount you specify whether it should be whether it should be paid ahead

Speaker 3  23:01
or can you hear me okay, you were breaking up the last minute or so, okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:04
Man, let me see if I can say something.

Unknown Speaker  23:52
Can you hear me now?

Unknown Speaker  23:55
Yeah, that seems to be better.

Speaker 2  23:58
So okay. So, we could use the directions to do this. But the other way to do it is have the idea of a a payroll savings, it basically a payroll savings concept, where you would specify either dollar or percentage amount that you want to say and then whether it should be assigned, whether this should be whether this is a an investment into the GL account or whether this is a well whether this is deposited via ACH

Speaker 2  24:44
or I suppose it could also be by cheque if you really wanted to. And ideally, net won't be the same payment method as as the paycheck so if you get paid back Check, you'd get to check if you get paid by ACH and have today's use.

Unknown Speaker  25:04
Yes. I think that makes I mean, that makes sense to me.

Speaker 3  25:16
Now, okay, you're saying, are you talking about the first two examples now? Or is that not your

Unknown Speaker  25:23
that could be used for all of them?

Speaker 3  25:29
Well, I mean, I think the first two examples are pretty straightforward. It just, it the only thing that they that changes from a typical employee would just be you have to ACH is that of one ACH. Right. But then, right, that's how you're thinking. That's how you're planning to handle that right. Now, okay, I didn't quite follow how you would do the last two examples where they're putting money into their noteholder accounts. Are you saying that would be an actual transfer of money? Well, okay, backing up one step. So if you if you're looking at the example of a stub I sent to you just a bit ago from even Miller, we've got that adjustment or to net pay at the bottom are we? Well, no, okay, keep Okay, so I think we're clear on the the first two examples, the last two examples where they're paying into their noteholder accounts. Are you

Speaker 3  26:50
would you be doing only the one ACH and or if we look at the Dave example that $200 that he wants to put into his noteholder account what how would that be an actual transfer of money? Or is it just

Unknown Speaker  27:17
accounting transaction,

Speaker 2  27:19
just an accounting transaction but all I'm really saying is that conceptually, the difference between putting it into a savings account and putting it into the business is is the same thing it's taking the percentage or dollar amount off the top up to obviously not to exceed the net amount of the check. And so, I think, I think using that because of the fact that the GL account would have to be unique to the individual I think doing it like that makes more sense and trying then using that via a deduction

Speaker 3  28:02
so when you go to set up and employ what would be the like the required are you going to set up on the the employee record or yeah, just yeah, the information that would need to be entered on the employer record to make this happen this up correctly,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
so you would need to have

Unknown Speaker  28:56
let me

Unknown Speaker  29:12
let me send your email here and

Unknown Speaker  29:23
then it'll make sense.

Unknown Speaker  29:46
Just letting go when you got it

Unknown Speaker  31:12
Got it? Yeah, I'm looking at Yeah, add your email

Speaker 2  31:23
you get two types of payroll savings once an ACH or once an owner investment. You ever weekly saving dollar amount with your savings percentage amounts? We should probably allow for both

Speaker 2  31:49
matters. And then if it's an ACH, you'd have the routing, routing account number and the account owner investment you'd have to have that GL account

Speaker 3  32:11
would It would it? I think yeah, that makes sense. Would it make sense to allow setting both the saving, saving ACH wrapping account in type, as well as the saving GL account, and then then adding a field for for weekly savings and weekly savings. We've like savings as $1, we will save you guys a percentage to both the ACH and on our investment then. I'm thinking if somebody were to order so toggle between the two, you could leave all that information set up in there and all you'd have to change is the managers on dollar amount or the percentage on either the ACH or the owner investment. Maybe that's a bad idea. You'll be able to see so Okay, what I'm thinking is you'll be able to see or question Willie, let's see if set up somebody's savings, payroll savings, Ach, the routing and everything. And then at some point you want to change it to owner investment.

Speaker 3  33:48
I'm assuming at that point, you would clear out the No, no, no, you would just select the other type. And the ACH routing and account that could all just remain right

Unknown Speaker  34:01
here won't be used

Speaker 3  34:08
Yeah, I think that makes sense. The only thing that I might add is that of owner investment it's it's basically an employee investment. Yes, I think you've Yeah.

Speaker 2  34:29
Yeah, I mean, we could, we could theoretically allow both. I just

Unknown Speaker  34:38
prefer not to I think

Speaker 3  34:39
the way you have it here is perfect. Now does this mean that you'll have to do a dance of back and forth communication to assuming we have a payroll? Software that fully integrates does this mean that you'll have to give If your gross pay information that's all for it'll do the withholdings and then come back to assist and say okay, do I have any payroll savings? And if so, how is it calculated and then put that back into the payroll software as so that it can calculate the deductions or the adjust and then finally my information to assist again

Speaker 2  35:32
no it's I mean, an employee investment is still taxable payroll is just that rather than having writing a check you and your only to check back into the business so as far as the payroll is concerned it would it would include the employee investments in the net so your reports are going to be wrong unless you know is it really that bad if and that's the wrong because employee investments

Unknown Speaker  36:16
well but the nets still wrong but then we would I mean we would show that detail we would show that to the investor on the on the pate the Assist is a stub I was thinking

Speaker 2  36:34
yeah on the on the piece that we will have something like payment details and then maybe broken down based on you know personal savings this amount personal checking this amount or you know personal checking this amount and employee investment that amount

Unknown Speaker  36:55
Yeah, I think that would be just Yeah, that sounds sounds good all right

Unknown Speaker  37:15
okay, are we good on that

Speaker 2  37:34
okay workforce I'm specifically looking at reduction of hurt for companies like yeah, checking to see if quarters can take employees go at their hourly rate

Unknown Speaker  38:02
what was the and then testing that we that there's a different owner versus employee now that that gets applied correctly? Yeah, too.

Speaker 3  38:17
Well, yeah, we're I think Glenn was bending she's going to burst that once I'd send it at this morning for whitetail Ron where it was the $100 costs enter dollars applied to the employee amount which is obviously did not set up it did not affect employee it didn't develop from the employees hourly wage based on how it's set up. But we want it to move to show zero for the employee amount and $100 for the owner amount to make sure that it ducks correctly

Unknown Speaker  39:15
and then,

Speaker 3  39:17
okay, so I just got a note here we just we just checked to there to a to don't even bother testing that because nobody used that and so you to the only thing there is just a test if that detox correctly from the owner amount do we owe it to the owner alone instead of the ploy a

Speaker 2  39:46
lot, it's okay good.

Speaker 3  39:55
Do you have anything for me or do you want to look at a few of these sales? versioning invoicing that where

Speaker 2  40:03
what what was the what was the the reports that you wanted to change

Unknown Speaker  40:19
to be

Speaker 3  40:21
Yeah, it was what I had sent yesterday and now I'm not even sure something on or oh here we go

Speaker 2  41:20
that's right nevermind Yes I got it. I will get to my inbox I will Jason I've got okay yes if you want to look at this sales orders needing invoicing happy to do that now

Speaker 3  41:39
or maybe the flow Yeah, I have some time but I mean we're gonna burn up quite a bit of time unless it's easy let's look through some of these I'm gonna send you the space that I have if you're good to go a little later than 230

Unknown Speaker  42:09
Most of them I didn't send you the ones that were all

Speaker 3  42:18
written that's usually how things are laid. No news is good news

Unknown Speaker  42:29
so there were like five pages I believe

Speaker 3  42:45
so are you looking at the North Carolina one with the first customer named Wilma Vargas? Yes. So now I did not look at these in any detail at all so I'm not sure why seeing not delivered because it's got a delivery date of 1016 Are you seeing anything on that that

Unknown Speaker  43:15
shouldn't for

Unknown Speaker  43:29
you're watching

Unknown Speaker  43:50
with a scheduled delivery date

Speaker 2  43:58
the building has a delivery. Okay that sales order says it's not delivered the building the building record says it is delivered. Why is the building?

Speaker 2  44:47
It was complete in his mark complete on Monday. No he was marked complete on Sunday. And then Mark incomplete on Monday And then so somebody's clear the delivery date on the transit record, but the building delivered delivery date never got cleared so it's out of sync with the sales order

Speaker 3  45:21
Okay, so what like who Mark did complete Sunday was it was it a haul or who would have marked it complete Sunday

Unknown Speaker  45:31
yeah Randall 830 In the evening was it complete

Unknown Speaker  45:37
830 Sunday evening Yeah. Then who marked it incomplete Monday you

Speaker 3  45:57
okay he he marked it incomplete on Monday so no no he did not clear you're saying he did not clear the delivery date

Speaker 2  46:12
Correct. You clear the transit completion date but the delivery date on the building never got cleared

Speaker 3  46:31
then so there's that seems like a process mistake not something that software can really not something where we should try and change the software to catch something like that really?

Speaker 2  46:48
Yeah, well, I mean, it begs the question why should we have any kind of handling when these get out of sync? Or three have a process that market undelivered that handles handles in both places I don't know.

Speaker 3  47:09
Seems like we should first about what happened and how often does it happen and then about handling for those situations? The last one Laura Ferris proposed invoice date but no build delivery date that eight

Speaker 2  47:35
that's particularly this one as well building okay so the

Speaker 2  47:50
This one doesn't have any it's this one doesn't have any transit tasks in the building

Unknown Speaker  48:15
it for some reason that doesn't have a transit task

Unknown Speaker  48:24
didn't have one

Unknown Speaker  49:00
Hey there I am Yep.

Unknown Speaker  49:04
So should that when invited Sandra tasca

Speaker 3  49:10
Well, like I said I don't even know what the what what building it like who sold it? Was it who was a dealer or was it a wholesale sale?

Unknown Speaker  49:17
Looks like wholesale ships to go

Unknown Speaker  49:23
it's to go

Unknown Speaker  49:26
well, I guess Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  49:29
Why do you then why do you then mediate to up here

Speaker 2  49:36
the fact that we have a invoice that is hello

Unknown Speaker  49:51
it's a district X building without a granting task.

Speaker 3  49:59
Okay and was Did everything that was recreated from an original that's right building like it we use it old it's direct building and we change it to a district X building

Unknown Speaker  50:19
building

Speaker 2  50:34
yes back on August 17 Addison turned it into a district X building this target dealer says to go Statesville

Speaker 3  50:49
and then what happened with okay what was the event that like creating an invoice for this building what what exactly happened there quite soon

Unknown Speaker  51:19
happened on Saturday

Speaker 2  51:26
between 333 3pm that we created if there was somebody market as no longer being a as part of its people the process

Unknown Speaker  51:47
let's go find out what was happening about that time

Unknown Speaker  52:34
worked In

Unknown Speaker  53:24
words

Unknown Speaker  53:33
and words seeing seeing

Unknown Speaker  53:46
when he created the sales order through the visualizer I think

Unknown Speaker  54:00
there's chance to go have a dealer login

Unknown Speaker  54:04
ah I don't know

Speaker 2  54:11
I feel a little sketchy on the details but it looks like it was a building that somebody sold

Unknown Speaker  54:34
but perhaps because it was a

Speaker 2  54:58
don't know I think this one you have to figure out the story from Dwayne or somebody on what actually happened in real life with this thing it looks to me like it's it's a it was somehow ended up on a lot and we sold it but then because it was one of these wholesale dealers we've been we've ever created in the past

Speaker 3  55:32
what about okay so the net on the next page the shutdown option auctioned building shed that was sold at auction building is delivered and paid you'd have a transit test that was completed on the 17th or What made it what made it show up on the 17

Speaker 2  55:58
Yeah, it was delivered to me it looks like it was delivered to delivery address was the to the ship time auction auction building and it was marked as the delivery to customer and as of the 17th it has a note in it that according to Wayne it was already picked up by the customer

Speaker 3  56:27
Okay, so they delivered it to the auction like it was not to the final location and it looks like the customer may have picked it up himself

Unknown Speaker  56:38
looks like yes

Unknown Speaker  56:46
and then 17

Unknown Speaker  56:52
What happened on the 17th and

Speaker 2  56:55
that's when Nick integrates in it looks like Nick just got it NIC came in and the building had a pending transit task over the weekend. Yesterday Nick came in because it was already delivered and he just scheduled the transit task word for yesterday and mark it as complete with notes to the customer pick it up

Unknown Speaker  57:35
make sense?

Unknown Speaker  57:40
Yeah.

Speaker 3  57:58
So anything that's not really anything that Salford could have done on that? I mean

Speaker 2  58:07
yeah, I mean, I think I mean, I think the behavior is correct on that one. We was delivered and thus showed up for invoicing

Speaker 3  58:21
though the other thing that could have happened is had somebody been had we been using the system somebody's been proactive and marked it a this one so we the invoice for it or is it you know, go ahead and just manually invoice for it then it would have never like these events had somebody gone in say it last week and asked Nick to invoice this building that that invoice he would have over wrote all of these transit tasks things that happened afterward then right

Unknown Speaker  59:06
yeah, okay

Speaker 3  59:13
good so not sure on the next one the 10 by eight or the the second and third one that Robert crow in the mark. Ever GLR GL and Ella are those both wholesale buildings are probably going to have a transit task

Unknown Speaker  59:52
look out for the test. Since the delivery was completed yesterday

Unknown Speaker  1:00:09
on which one the Robert crow

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
no I'm sorry I'm on the wrong one sorry got my numbers

Speaker 2  1:00:29
all right it does not have a random cap for some reason it's not clear to me why it does not was sold by new house outdoors being seen right Douglas

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
why would it not have a

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
What about the next one

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
nobody didn't set the dealer correctly let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
let's go to the

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
next one else in a transit pass

Speaker 3  1:01:27
this one also has no transit tasks now who sold that one?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:34
Also that was awkward let's look for sales orders completed sales ordered by dealer no I don't have a good way to do

Speaker 2  1:01:49
that explained that well let's just do this

Unknown Speaker  1:02:06
in a way to check some proofs bumpers

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
No.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:00
Gonna say transit tasks

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
thing none of none of Douglas

Unknown Speaker  1:03:11
Let me double check one more thing so for that was that was a spot check. Hang on none of them since July 7 came to class

Unknown Speaker  1:03:28
for being Hinton Yes,

Speaker 2  1:03:31
correct. Sorry, I'm sorry. I said that wrong. Oh, should be seven I'm sorry. It's September none since September 7

Speaker 3  1:03:48
Okay, you're saying not no no sales orders since September 7 from being able to have friends at task X

Speaker 3  1:04:15
Okay, what about the last two? Those are sheds direct invoices Why did those show up? They did those were those invoice date is a long time ago.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:43
The for the Ohio ones

Speaker 3  1:04:47
Correct. Yeah, the 237772220

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
NEC removed the building from this sales order and therefore because it no longer has a building Do you want to invoice it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:43
Nick removed the building from the sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
Yes

Unknown Speaker  1:05:51
Was that on both of these

Unknown Speaker  1:06:04
secret works looks like

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
don't have any more explanation of it

Speaker 3  1:06:26
I think the next one is pretty much the only issue is the last one there was built wrong and put back in that's one of those situations where

Unknown Speaker  1:06:44
they built this building

Speaker 3  1:06:52
gets real messy but so the story on that one is is they built what they thought is going to be the when they were building this building for this customer they made a mistake and that of fixing it they basically said well this is going to be a different building offer won't fix that but we're going to need some type of way to sell some of these buildings I don't know that we need to look at that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
more I think okay the next page we again have the two at the bottom of the T 11 that are circled

Speaker 3  1:07:45
making off of sheds rec lots and switching to true point a lot buildings my guess is the exact same thing happened there where Nick removed the building from the sales order by to invoice it

Unknown Speaker  1:08:07
let me check the

Speaker 2  1:08:18
check the last one as well. Yes originally originally was SDI is now district dice

Unknown Speaker  1:08:43
what what could have happened what are what should have happened to

Speaker 3  1:08:56
what what how could that have been switched correctly like moving a building from District eggs to firms it's right to district eggs

Speaker 2  1:09:29
why is there still a balance on sales orders? First of all

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
seems to me like you have to do something along these lines

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
or cancel You can't cancel the district tech Sales Order.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
Get Dwayne, Dwayne involved here.

Speaker 2  1:10:15
Isn't it slightly concerning that we might have build SDI rebuilding and Mr. Gates? Where's that another thing?

Speaker 3  1:10:26
Yeah. Well we have a pretty manual process that we're we're doing internally now currently. So I don't the way we're handling that, I don't think it's a concern that it's actually happening, but it is concerning that it's I'm just questioning what we're running into all kinds of different situations that I'm wondering if we need to rethink our approach on sales orders needing invoicing something maybe more

Speaker 3  1:11:16
we need to think about sales orders more as having status as like, moves from this status to this status. And, like, is that more is that would that be more? More cut and dried and the way we're trying to do this?

Speaker 2  1:11:50
Don't know for sure if it would be or not, I mean, it seems like we've uncovered a handful of issues that need to be resolved anyway. Which is what happens when transit tasks are out of sync with the building record? And what happens when a building gets turned from an FBI building into into this redex building? It seems to me like both of those processes are fundamentally flawed or not fundamentally flawed but that are incomplete and those are the you know, besides the shipment, you know should have oxygen building well that's that's actually kind of how it's expected to work perhaps the biggest issue is that you didn't have any of the notes off of the transit test to be able to know what's the task or sales order to know what's going on

Speaker 3  1:12:51
agree anybody we do status is the status is still going to be based off of events just like we're we're handling it now.

Speaker 2  1:13:01
Yeah. What would it be worth would it be worth showing the notes from the sales warning and the notes from the customer delivery transit task on the sales orders meeting invoicing?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
Yeah, I think it would, it would help Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:13:24
Would you want that under building description or

Speaker 3  1:13:33
the Building ID the building date, built date to description sales order shipping name we can get rid of one of the pricing columns see there's these are all matching all the way through subtotal with shipping and then the total that okay and I see one that's different that stopped subtotal with shipping is we need that one the total we don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
And then we'll just have a Notes column with the

Unknown Speaker  1:14:45
arrows water plus the

Unknown Speaker  1:14:55
that seems

Speaker 3  1:15:04
And then let's also look at the one that's noted down below the and 26467823

Speaker 3  1:15:23
what that one did not not show up

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
it's an STI building Let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
that one was invoiced on last week that's why it's not on the list

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
anyway as well was it in waste?

Speaker 2  1:16:16
And wasted is on the well sorry, it was its invoice invoice date is the 10th the invoice date was applied on the 12

Unknown Speaker  1:16:32
All because of the rubber stamping process

Speaker 2  1:16:37
Yeah. Day after build something like that were built

Unknown Speaker  1:16:50
Okay, the reason why it's that is because it is

Speaker 2  1:16:59
now the final delivery date. And let me guess the final delivery date applied on the

Speaker 3  1:17:15
Oh, this one? Yeah, we changed that criteria to say that if the building has a if it's a building and it has a built on site option then invoice for it when the building is marked complete. But this being said straight building the bill on site option probably was not itemized on the building as I can that correct not like it would be for a base building or maybe it is.

Speaker 2  1:17:50
There are no, there are no transit tests on here. So no, it's not itemized. And in the build on site, we only did the build on site for disregards buildings I don't know if that's right or not I don't know if that makes any difference

Speaker 3  1:18:08
well, it's it's technically not right but it wouldn't we make it right it wouldn't make a difference because don't itemize sheds right buildings those options so leave it just as it as well good so

Speaker 3  1:18:37
it looks like I've got some work on my site to see work with Wayne and Miller's on some of these processes and see what

Speaker 3  1:18:52
that's seems like the next step so and then I'm suspicious that being Hampton reason they might not have any transit tasks is they're completely handling that on their own local hauler up there that does not not sure

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17
Well, interesting. So I'll dig into this and try and get some answers and then we can

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
sounds good. Okay. Thank you
