Unknown Speaker  00:35
With us, Mark how's it going?

Speaker 1  00:41
Good about your morning been

Unknown Speaker  00:47
good? Yep

Speaker 1  00:54
as drew drew he's not on easy no wonder if he saw the email let me just try him real quick. I'm not Yeah, I think he needs to be on

Unknown Speaker  01:50
So Drew should be coming on in a minute.

Unknown Speaker  01:53
Sounds good

Speaker 1  02:17
do you have what would be ideal as if you would have balance sheets open? We could see what are all 31 131 to 29 balance balances are as we work through this.

Unknown Speaker  02:35
Yeah, I've got that. Okay.

Speaker 1  02:40
What are you showing for 1231? Are you showing

Matthias Miller  02:46
was showing a map through what he had sent?

Speaker 1  02:50
During a match? Okay, you're showing the Okay. And you're showing 109 at zero?

Matthias Miller  02:59
Yeah, I mean, it's pressing zero balances, and it's not on here. So. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
What did you say? It's not

Matthias Miller  03:12
I mean, I did run it to include food. zero balances shot,

Unknown Speaker  03:20
but it's not on there. So that's yeah, zero balance. Okay, then we're good for December so let me know as soon as drew joins you

Unknown Speaker  04:21
hello

Speaker 1  04:28
so I think this can be pretty straightforward. I was hoping to have this all organized a little better by now. But anyway, the bottom line here is Matthias is so the source of truth like how do we actually know how much inventory we have at the end of each month is done by a physical count. So we treat IMS as the source of truth and not accounting. So that's where Paul 31 or 1,114,007 4969 comes from and whether right or wrong, that's what we we will for that we simply made a journal entry. So that that gave us our starting inventory balance and then we will do that at the end of every month. However we will not okay, let let me just explain a little bit on the what what happens in IMS. So we do that and then then throughout the month, IMS increments every day as product comes in and increases and increases and increases in at SKU lots.

Speaker 1  05:41
Then at the end of the month, we count the inventory again and go in and make adjustments to the inventory which then No, takes out the old SKU lots and keeps the newest ones. But that gives us our ending that gives us our 131 or our end of month inventory value. Does that make sense? Yep, makes sense. So and what accounting does is so 1231 We made a journal entry accounting accounting is a match. And then accounting from that point forward. Also increments whenever product is received and changes whenever an invoice when it hits accounts payable. If it moves from receiving a voucher to accounts payable there any differences it adjusts for that it increments just the same as ins does. However, it also decrements whenever a building is built, the reason I am asked is not decrement is we don't have the raw materials setup at this point. So it's not intelligent enough to decrement. But accounting does decrement using standard costing. So we get to the end of the month. And there's always going to be a discrepancy between the two. So we basically say what does IMS say? January's is easy, we get to the end of January so that we say what? What's our source of truth? What is IMS? And that if you don't have that number, it should be you might want to write this down. It should be 1,096,008 7450 Let me just send because I've seen for February

Matthias Miller  07:50
let me see these I have these from Drew's email if that's the same

Speaker 1  07:55
No, I don't know. You do. So, let me let me send these over. And

Speaker 2  08:09
Matthias go back to the balance sheet if you can, that you had up

Speaker 3  08:17
January or the December the January?

Matthias Miller  08:34
So am I so that 109 gets decreases based? When buildings are built? Was that right? Right. And 105 gets increases when invoices were when

Speaker 2  08:57
POS received. Yeah, just when items are received.

Speaker 1  09:05
So yeah, 105 Go ahead.

Speaker 2  09:10
No, just go with your thing. I'm still looking up something.

Speaker 1  09:16
So besides 105 will increase throughout the year, all throughout the year, we'll just let it increase or that's the thought increase, increase increase. know from the starting number. It'll increase throughout the year. Until both 3124 and then we'll again do a journal entry to like we did this you know this year 109 will also increase that negative number will increase increase increase based on standard costing. And then The actual call whenever we, okay, so in purest forms, what we need, like at the end of January is 105. So here's the formula. This is really basic but the 105 account. Why was any inbound freight the 108? Which we don't have here, I don't think we have anything. So 105 plus 108 minus 109 must equal our Source of Truth Number 1,000,096 874 50. And the way we make that it does match that is by our applying our actual cause. So if if our actual cost is. But yeah, that I mean, that would be the beat, you'd say the formula be something like this 105 was 108. Minus? Well, it'd be. Yeah, so it'd be 105 plus 108, minus 109. And then we say, Okay, how much does that differ from our source of truth. And then we use that to determine what our actual cause are to be applied. And then when we apply those actual cause, then we can double check. And then at that point, our source of truth number doesn't change. But the only number that's going to change after we apply actual cause that we're concerned about here is the 109. Number will will adjust. So that if we do our math, again, 105 plus 108, minus 109, needs to equal our Source of Truth Number.

Speaker 2  12:02
Mark, your source of truth number includes these, like the 3900 journal entry for the raw materials that they took out for the asset remodel projects, and then would also include the entries for the miscellaneous sales items when

Speaker 1  12:32
it would, and the source of truth is just, Mr. Builder go into the shop and count all the materials that you have in your possession at that time. So yes, like anything that's been used for fixed assets to build, you know, your renovation houses, has already disappeared from inventory, anything for your miscellaneous orders? You're employed by 10 pieces have always be that's already gone when they do the inventory account. So another way to double check this mythos would be to say, Okay, what is our what is our balance just on the 1005 account, the parent account and make sure that it matches? Okay, that the 1005 the parent account, is simply the result of the formula was one of i plus 108 minus 109. is screaming the same as your your parent account that needs to match your needs to match our source of truth. Number from IMS?

Unknown Speaker  13:49
Well, okay, so we're all yours. I mean, there's

Unknown Speaker  14:02
I'm not sure we are right now.

Matthias Miller  14:07
We're up by 14 at 239.

Speaker 2  14:14
Mark, did you include the transaction that I put into raw materials? Or 926 25?

Speaker 1  14:26
No, I did not. I mean, the. When you were here Thursday, I didn't know about that Friday. I didn't know about that. So no, that's not included. However, that when you say include you're talking about including it in that you're saying that doesn't change. The IMS total the source of let's just call it IMS, that of keeping Yeah, that that won't change the IMS total but it would change our calculation on applying actual cause Okay, what you're seeing, right?

Speaker 2  15:03
So so how's it gonna affect accounting because raw materials is going to be $926, higher, like 105 is going to be 926 25 Higher. So we should probably go back and apply that to the buildings.

Speaker 1  15:27
We should just reapply that actual cost to the buildings.

Speaker 2  15:36
So then we can say that that is that 926

Matthias Miller  15:45
Was that amount again before now

Unknown Speaker  15:48
926 25

Matthias Miller  15:53
We're down to takes care of all of it about 500. But, I mean, even with this is like, do we know? Without No, yeah, I don't really gonna get a lot of visibility into what you guys have done. I can't really do we know if this if the 105 increase matches what you guys are expecting?

Speaker 1  16:29
Well, that's that the 105 increases. In this well, it is in a sense, but it's also I think all we need to do is go back to the actual cost you say we're, what is the amount we're off right now. 14 1480 230-914-8239.

Speaker 1  16:56
So what we need to do to is go back to what was the actual cause we applied to?

Unknown Speaker  17:05
Um, January?

Unknown Speaker  17:16
Well, I would need to look it up.

Matthias Miller  17:22
I was showing 1087 6699.

Speaker 1  17:26
Okay, so we would just we would need to, okay, just add that whatever at 18766 99 plus your 1482 39 and reapply that actual cost and then that should give us the number we're looking for

Matthias Miller  17:50
your low I'm assuming that we should, I don't know if this is right. To replay the actual cost of 8949 41. No, that's not right. Maybe this

Speaker 1  18:09
Well, no. 4938

Speaker 2  18:14
Um, Matthias, what do you have there, your 3992 and your 5052 are the amounts that are taken out for other purposes that are not billing costs. Right. So So those wouldn't get applied to the actual costing, we need to we subtract those from the amount How is it subtracting from the amount that IMS says it's supposed to be something like that

Speaker 2  18:57
spreadsheet again, mark you had it on your spreadsheet

Unknown Speaker  19:04
Yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  19:11
yeah

Speaker 1  19:21
well, okay, it's I mean, another way to do this would be just this. Okay, what was before we made any Well, you don't have visibility into that anymore, but I don't think but before you made any before we made any changes

Unknown Speaker  19:42
to this. What what did 109 Show? Was it 116 550 95 If we don't have a good way to see that that's

Matthias Miller  19:56
I don't have it offhand. It should have been. I don't even know that It was potentially a handful of variances that may or may not have been included, based on what I did. But I'm not sure. There was like, I'm not sure which ones it would have been.

Speaker 1  20:21
So Drew, is there? Is there any reason? I mean, I know we're jumping over some of the finer details, but for where we're at, is there any reason we can't just go back and apply that actual cost of 110 4938? And then see if the numbers on the balance sheet match with IMS?

Unknown Speaker  20:45
We should be able to

Matthias Miller  20:48
do we have to go the other direction though, because we're currently under and so we would actually want to have something like a one oh what would it be? 107 2460 Maybe

Speaker 1  21:13
you're sick a Yeah. Because Because right now. Right now what you're seeing right? If you look, if you look at your balance sheet shows less than IMS, your oh five parent account shows less than IMS. Yeah, you're just saying it would be the other

Matthias Miller  21:34
the sum of the two? Yeah. Yeah. So if we apply less to finish, it will increase the balance sheet. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:46
It should be 1072 8464.

Speaker 2  21:49
January Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
6107 284 62

Speaker 1  22:02
Then where we were where we got confused was we had or we thought we had done that. And the numbers should all have tied out and they didn't again, guess we can

Speaker 2  22:30
use them for I thought we did we I thought we had it there and then died out. Friday, but then or Thursday, then Friday? Didn't anymore.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
Do you think there were I think

Speaker 2  22:50
that okay, I applied these changes. But we probably have to run a have to push an update to accounting or not.

Matthias Miller  23:00
Yes, we would. Try to do that if you want me to.

Unknown Speaker  23:08
Go ahead. I don't have it open right now.

Unknown Speaker  23:15
Let's just follow that. While that happens, we can have a five minute discussion on their stuff, right. Takes about I don't know how long does it take to

Speaker 2  23:29
15 minutes probably. Maybe more? Well, then. Um, so So what's in I got left behind? What's the change in our calculating in order to come up with this new number of 107 instead of 108? Are we just saying that then matching a lot of this as a cost

Matthias Miller  24:04
could we start by just point yes. Okay. But could we justify this fairly easily? Because so IMS says the inventory drought by 7875 19 We said we had an increase I'm not sure how to get these numbers to come out right. We said we had an increase in accounting of

Matthias Miller  24:40
of nine well actually, I think this is it. I can see the pattern I'm not sure if I can justify it. Okay, so, so from so I NS decreased by 78 7519. We increased weight by 98 360 to 69. We are excluding 89. Because it's 328. Which, which means that you so what does this number mean? I know it's right, but I don't know what it means. It means that we have to, it should be,

Unknown Speaker  25:30
it should be the number to apply to actual costing.

Matthias Miller  25:34
No. That that says that that we have is the 949 41 increase in the balance sheet that's accounted for, which would zero it out. But because we want the balance sheet to drop by 7875 19, we have to subtract negative 17 Or add 1775 90, which takes us back to 1072 equals 60 that we just got done apply.

Speaker 2  26:06
So it's the amount of change in our inventory. That was that gets applied to the buildings. Like no, it's the it's the part of our inventory that gets applied to the buildings not from the change in inventory. Minus the change

Matthias Miller  26:33
something so it's accounting financial accounting, it is our change. Go ahead. Sorry, Mark.

Speaker 1  26:40
No, I wanted you to to run through that formula again, because I think you simplified it and it made more sense than what I was trying to explain.

Matthias Miller  26:51
Your let me Ms. Change let me actually see if I can Okay, I said this was the

Matthias Miller  27:14
let me I'm just gonna send this over to you Mark. And then

Matthias Miller  27:27
I think we can give about 3030 seconds or however long the middle speed up the explanation process

Unknown Speaker  27:46
you got it?

Speaker 1  28:16
Think this is one of the things that once they're used to doing it, it's it'll be pretty straightforward. It's just it's, it's it's seemingly more complicated than applying labor costs, because

Speaker 1  28:38
labor costs, we do everything. Based on numbers in accounting, here, we're looking at numbers in accounting, and how it relates to ins.

Matthias Miller  28:49
Right. Did you have the, you get that email that I got it here. Alright, so we'll be looking at 105105 showed an increase of 98 360 to 69. And then if we look at 109, there's that 30 992 transaction that we want to exclude in the 5030 to 36 sales orders and we want to exclude so that means that we sorry, this has changed accounting to net zero is not actually but there's there's 8949 41 increase in accounting that we think came from buildings, but IMS dropped by 7835 19. So if we subtract that from the 89, you get 1072 8460, which is the amount that's the amount we need to apply to buildings in order to get the normally, yeah, did the net zero

Speaker 1  30:08
So would it be correct to say that the 80,000? Is that was what that was standard costing? That's what we thought material prices were going to be well, the links we build.

Matthias Miller  30:30
No, because I don't have the numbers from standard costing. Maybe even not necessarily.

Unknown Speaker  30:48
Normally, you would want

Matthias Miller  30:56
standard costing could have been anything.

Unknown Speaker  30:58
Yeah.

Speaker 1  31:04
Yeah. Why Why wouldn't this reflect what we thought standard costing?

Unknown Speaker  31:12
is? Well, because

Speaker 1  31:14
the reason asking somehow we want to have a way to say, What did standard costing apply to buildings? What will actual costing apply to buildings, so that we can see what changes we should make for future periods on our percentage to apply? You're gonna

Unknown Speaker  31:36
find those costs

Matthias Miller  31:46
well, I mean, I can, I can, I can also pull up a report right now it tells us where it was. So it was dinner costing was one of us robbing, like 8775. total variation, or two total variance play was 273 15. To me, sounds pretty impressive. But

Speaker 1  32:19
the variance was only the difference from 1055 57 to the 107. Number. We were like $2,000.

Matthias Miller  32:29
Low? No, we were less than 2000.

Unknown Speaker  32:33
let ya

Matthias Miller  32:35
know, it's it's even less things.

Matthias Miller  32:46
So we're not touching the standard cost standard cost when they tune in before? Yeah, no, it's it's even less than that. So standard pasture billings, what was what is seven 547 75. And the amount we're playing is one a second 2d 460. So we over applied to 73, six, and 15.

Unknown Speaker  33:16
Which is a point. Like some? It's a quarter percent.

Speaker 1  33:25
Well take that. So. So we're starting to understand the 89 has nothing to do with Yeah, let's just accounting for the changing

Speaker 2  33:45
Well, I guess you could in a way just leave that out. We could say the 98 is our materials purchase. And 3900 don't go to buildings 5052 Don't go to buildings. And then 7085 is our is our change and IMS. Just take them all away from 98,000.

Matthias Miller  34:12
Right. The other another way you could do it is

Unknown Speaker  34:38
are you still there?

Unknown Speaker  34:40
No, I don't think

Speaker 2  34:45
I would say leave it the way you have it there. Let me because because you're subtracting, well actually you're adding because you got negatives in there. So the 89 is the sum of the top three and then your and then your subtract angle negative 17 from the nine so we got two functions going on

Speaker 1  35:13
I think this is is that what you're saying? Do I mean I think it's it's this is about as straightforward as you can make it or is that what you're saying as well?

Unknown Speaker  35:30
Did that thing re

Matthias Miller  35:37
see if it's far enough down the process students working on your Salesforce yes it's on Salesforce. Okay, so let's read relevant Let's go the other way you could do it

Unknown Speaker  36:00
no, I'll be quiet and listen

Matthias Miller  36:18
couldn't you can see that on now, it's probably more competition seems like you can see what we do and based on

Unknown Speaker  36:34
to

Matthias Miller  36:41
how does that tie into the Yeah, no. Anyway, it seems to me like there could be another way to do it, where you're looking at how much did the balance sheet shift? How much did the how much

Speaker 2  37:03
anyway, what's that? Well, balance sheet shift minus your things that the in 105 Balance Sheet change minus your items that didn't go to buildings plus your inventory, your IMS change

Unknown Speaker  37:31
which all you're really doing is you're

Matthias Miller  37:40
you could also take building costs anyway whatever it's it's six of one and a half dozen of the other Alright, so that leaves us with 105 is 121311238 and 109 is 1162378. And if we sum these together we should get we get the get the IMS number. So that means that January January now to phase out with IMS.

Speaker 1  38:25
And so that I mean I think that bottom line is that's what we want. So we've we've taken all those we've applied any discrepancies onto those buildings. So now if we go to February, we want to do the exact same thing. However, I think once we get into beyond the first month, it becomes a little more complex because now well, Matthias, how would you do this for your? For your because both numbers now like the 105 and 109 are looking at a month worth Would you still well? How would you do this calculation using your spreadsheet Did you just

Matthias Miller  39:19
think that would do the copy this guy

Speaker 2  39:28
well, we have we're charging the billing specifically to February so we just need to subtract January balance sheet numbers from February balance sheet numbers to get our mouths are working for the month of February.

Matthias Miller  39:46
So I'm seeing a February I'm seeing a let's do this. You'll see February increase

Matthias Miller  40:13
What do you like about me? 96 340 53? Let me make February January, just for this cross reference this to make a little bit of sanity check. 96 340 53 Okay, we have the so in one Oh, still we bet the 105 difference, then let's go into 109. And we have this 2679 87. Yeah. So we're going to subtract that one. And then we're going to go on spill billing classified. And then we have 633 98 and miscellaneous and sales orders. Which gives us the the change in accounting, Net Zero is 9302668. The IMS shift what don't you like about that? Number? Number do that. I invest change is drops and 8177 60 which gives us a total of 173 204.

Speaker 1  41:53
Did you again subtract that 2600 For what was moved to fixed assets?

Matthias Miller  42:02
2678 Yeah. Okay. So, Mark, I'm going to shoot over this copy of you to you guys as well.

Unknown Speaker  42:17
So that 173 is what should be applied

Matthias Miller  42:23
to servers, you can see it once the least Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  42:36
Do what had we applied?

Speaker 2  42:37
Like to 15? Yeah. But I know that, like when we did it, our February numbers were much farther off than our than our January

Matthias Miller  42:57
Well, in this whole I mean, you guys weren't off much in January, but January will adjust would change your calculations here.

Speaker 2  43:08
But I don't so what we're saying here is we're just applying the discrepancies on those buildings and our inventory count is much is a lot more different from our accounting numbers for January. That difference is bigger in January than that difference in I mean, sorry, the difference is bigger in February than it is in January.

Unknown Speaker  43:52
Okay, that's applied.

Unknown Speaker  43:55
Okay, so here we go again.

Unknown Speaker  44:04
So then, one question.

Speaker 2  44:10
Mark, is there feasible? explanation, I guess, like good. The diet guys have counted differently or, or what are we going to chalk the discrepancies up to?

Speaker 1  44:32
Well, there's okay, there's several things we want to look at. So we're saying, Okay, let's start with this. We're saying total manufacture price like total production, or the month of, of January was 280,000. Is production was low. For the month of February it was 508,000, almost twice the amount. Now, one of the things we want To look at first is

Unknown Speaker  45:05
I guess that's what you're you're you're building break buildings built break down, does as well is as a percentage. How much did we vary? Like we want to be able to see how far off? Well, we want to be able to see over a period of time?

Speaker 1  45:35
What is our actual costs percentage for materials, which will then use to as our standard costing percentage moving forward? So if we if we took these actual cost numbers, what are they as the percentage of in January? What are they as a percentage of manufacturer prior to January? And what are they for February? And if those are in line, then we'll say Well, yeah, that makes sense. If they're big variances, then there's there's a number of things that could have caused that. Maybe the inventory wouldn't count, right? Are you at a place where you can look at those what those were as a percentage of manufacturer price for both month was the presumptive

Matthias Miller  46:33
manufacturer price. What the variance was as the percentage of manufacturer price or what the price was

Unknown Speaker  46:48
okay, can you repeat that? Yeah. No,

Matthias Miller  46:52
no, I got it. So FGI raw material was 6.85 for the January period, and it was 9.56 for the February period

Unknown Speaker  47:06
I mean, that was a variance

Speaker 2  47:10
well, they're way off

Unknown Speaker  47:19
like demand for dollars there is way off

Matthias Miller  47:24
Wait a minute. Which shouldn't you have? Where did you put the 173 to afford 28

Speaker 2  47:32
All right. You might need to refresh or I might need to go out of it.

Unknown Speaker  47:38
Wait did not use it? You didn't save it?

Unknown Speaker  47:43
Oh sure.

Unknown Speaker  47:46
Here let me stop this one maybe

Matthias Miller  48:09
come on come on. Sorry. Oh no, let's not stop those sorry. Sorry guys. All right. You Yeah, that's better 6.85 versus 7.68.

Speaker 1  48:26
But that's that's the variance right? That's not the I'd like to no

Unknown Speaker  48:33
no, no.

Matthias Miller  48:37
That's period cost divided by manufacturer price

Speaker 1  48:45
give it that can't that's way too low. Like what what what what are your total manufacturer? What was the total manufacturer price for January? Well, that's

Unknown Speaker  49:03
what oh, how is that thing getting calculated?

Unknown Speaker  49:06
Well, we thought

Unknown Speaker  49:11
oh, I wonder if that's remember what he looked Yeah, we saw that on. Yeah, I think that's looking at the wrong field. But this is if you go to well, there's other ways you can do it. But if you go to your

Speaker 1  49:28
report, you create it for us Thursday or Friday that built buildings. If you go to that report, or say the month of create it for the month of January, that will show you manufacture price per building and a total. I have here like 280,000 or something.

Matthias Miller  49:48
Yeah, I'm seeing that to 280 8388. So if we go to the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  49:55
use that number

Matthias Miller  49:56
107 Yeah No wonder Okay, so it's 38% in January and then let's go to February

Unknown Speaker  50:19
that's still run

Matthias Miller  50:32
in 34% February

Speaker 1  50:41
so that's about what I expected. Yeah.

Speaker 2  50:46
Um, when they count inventory, how is the value of the inventory they count figured they go by this price

Speaker 1  51:04
when they count inventory, okay. Only at the end of the year Do they count everything all other end of every month, they count only the large ticket items like the OSB. So they will count and say we have 5000 sheets of OSB then that number will be entered into I think it's called an absolute adjustment. We will say at this location, this shop or this warehouse, any any location per location will say okay, this location has 5000 pieces of OSB and then they enter that number in IMS. IMS will say, Okay, I show 6500 pieces at this location. However, I know that it's first in first out, but I will count backwards by 1000 pieces. And then anything earlier than that the remaining 1500. I will erase those out. So the value that it uses is, you know, those 5000 pieces, let's say that was five, the five most recent truckloads it will use that caused the same as when it should be the exact same as what the 105 account uses in in accounting because it's its own it uses

Unknown Speaker  52:40
its its pricing, right?

Speaker 1  52:46
Yes, which should should exactly match.

Speaker 2  52:51
So I know where I am. I'm pretty sure to know where I'm coming from, or discrepancies are from stuff that is charged in accounting to raw materials, but it's not driven. But it's not connected to a Pio. Like, so we buy something from Menards. And we say, and we don't have any vendor record or anything of this, or vendor invoice record. But we know that if we bought it from Menards, it was probably raw materials. So we so we put it to the raw materials account, but it never adjust any pricing for anything, because it's not attached to a Pio or SKU lot.

Speaker 1  53:39
Oh, it's just a just a transaction to 105.

Unknown Speaker  53:43
Right. Right.

Unknown Speaker  53:47
Well, that's me. And

Speaker 2  53:50
there's actually more of those than what we would like you know, or even like all the mess with vinyl structures, Lowe's account that that credit card, American Express credit card, there, it's gonna happen a bunch. And that's, that's what error was concerned about being able to push those credits back on to those purchase orders that changes his inventory pricing correctly. So until we have a good way to do that, we're just going to have a bunch of a variance here, which I had told him well, is there a way that we can just blanket apply those differences, which is actually exactly what we're doing here? We're just saying, Well, we think our inventory is worth this much. But actually, there's these other costs that affect our inventory. So we're just going to apply it out across all the buildings and say, well, everybody, every building has to eat this much of these On determined costs?

Speaker 1  55:04
Well, I'm sure that is a big factor. But I think probably just as big a factor is the, what we call the low usage inventory, where we, at the end of the year, when we do a complete count, we say this is everything. This is all the screws, screws and the shutters and the bolts, then we say, well, how much of that is is not frequent inventory that we don't count, we use that number, like in the case for shared time here. It's 233,000 out of what amounts to about here, it's about want to say like 20% of the inventory we do as $1 value we don't count. And know if that 233 versus 881. So are we do this?

Speaker 1  56:03
Yeah, roughly 20% is never counted. So if we get a bunch of like, nails is probably like, we don't count nails every every month just because it's not worth the effort, we believe. But if we get $50,000 worth of nails every month accounting knows that $50,000 increase in what was received, but the people counting at nine as don't know that. So we just still use that same flat number every month. And so that additional cost is just at Spike. That low usage inventory is just swallowed up by

Unknown Speaker  56:50
all the buildings build in that mind. So I think those are my, here's what do you think do but my guess is if I had to guess I guess that both both of these other ones probably just as big an issue as the other but I don't know, like, how much

Speaker 2  57:21
are we? Yeah. I mean, I don't know much on the low usage inventory side. But the just the regular, like the items just apply to raw materials, there's gonna be both credits and debits applied there. So in some ways, the things that are applied there, balance themselves out as well. Which might lower the difference that they create. Whereas what you're talking about, is only going to want run in one direction.

Speaker 1  58:03
Well, it well, no, it can go both ways. Like it could gradually go down to because like, at, at affordable a year or two ago, we made we intentionally lowered all of our inventory levels on all of those items. So if we started out with 500,000 or that was our number we use, you know, by the end of the year, it was more like random 50,000. So

Speaker 1  58:38
I think this is the best we can do right now. We talked about possibly doing complete inventory counts in Indiana per quarter, just to see you all in how much are we running off? But?

Speaker 2  58:56
Well, I mean, the nice thing is, we are figuring those differences back into the cost of the building. So I mean, while our inventory might be run off just a little bit, our income statements are still going to be correct. Because it's figured in. So

Speaker 1  59:23
So have we we haven't these updates haven't completed yet have they Messiah's like we have February balance sheet. We got to match. Are we matching IMS? Okay, so now we're matching. We're matching IMS for December, January and February.

Unknown Speaker  59:43
Yes, correct.

Speaker 1  59:46
Perfect. Well, the only thing I might say that we we should do differently than what we just did is well, it concerns me that we obviously haven't locked in period yet, because now any changes made to like the 105 account will throw these numbers off again. So ideally, we would lock them. The other thing is, I think we should always look at these changes year to date, instead of based off of one month, like we should always, like when we get to March, we should say, what was the difference between December and March? Maybe that's

Speaker 1  1:00:33
between December and on all accounts. Year to date, yeah. So you don't, if one month happens to run off, for some reason that they February, say halfway through the year, February, something goes wrong with February then?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
Well

Speaker 2  1:00:57
then you got three costs for the whole period aren't you?

Matthias Miller  1:01:03
Know, you would just if there's a shift from historical month, you would just apply that shift to the current month, and the current month's billing costs would look different than we'd be higher or lower than what they normally would have been.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20
You just apply it to the current month? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:01:23
Got it. So well, I guess one question is, what's the level of urgency on? Well, two questions? What's the level of urgency of locking down periods? And second of all, how soon do you guys want to lock down? Periods?

Speaker 1  1:01:44
Well, I would say, we've applied labor costs, we've applied raw materials costs, and we're still waiting to apply overhead costs, because we need depreciation numbers, to get those to human dies. After that, I would be ready to start locking down periods. Would we not Drew, like in this case for shed time? If we would have if we would have applied overhead? There's no reason we couldn't lock down January and February? Or is,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:20
I would think so. But

Speaker 1  1:02:24
okay, to answer your questions, we're, what's the level of urgency? And how soon are we ready for it? Is that?

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
Yeah, I think part of my question is that under the accounting periods, so we have closing transaction locking dates. So I think what we could do fairly easily is validation that if if you have permission to modify locks transactions, which I'm going to get through does have? Well, first of all, we've got two distinctions. One is closed periods. And the other is lock transactions, in this case, would be looking to use lock transactions, close periods or for literally losing periods. And and I think basically, what we do is Drew would get if you make a modification to a record that has a potential impact on accounting, we would if it's Drew, we give them a warning. And if it's anybody else, we give them an error. And we say no, you can't do that just says accounting implications. It's really not a lack of accounting period. You

Speaker 1  1:03:58
I think, besides that goes, I think we have to, I think I would kick that down the road, I would rather have some messiness to deal with and do the right fix after we've talked to Larry about, you know, we think that what should happen is, anybody else can make those changes. But instead of posting, they don't even know but instead of posting the date it normally would, it would kick it forward to it would post it on the first day. Of first day after close periods or whatever, like the first date, that's still open. But might I mean it this, this could create some numbers, because the numbers to shift we don't have that before then. But if we do it before, then I'm just concerned that will create more misses than if we just wait and do it right. Sorry, I agree. I'm happy. So, Drew, what else are we needing? On this? Right now? Didn't we have the same thing on production labor? When we applied it, it didn't. It didn't end up showing what we expected it to show.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
Production labor did what we wanted it to, I thought.

Speaker 1  1:05:36
Okay, I mean, the way to double check that Mathias would be if you look at if you look at the balance sheet, because there we apply it January and February together, if you look at the balance sheet for February 29, the which, which account is the 106. If you look at the 106 parent account. Now, if you look at the production labor accounts, ignore completed buildings, then the sum of all the other accounts except the contra account the production level of finished goods, to equal the production labor to finished goods, like the payroll taxes and insurance to direct labor, indirect labor and play transportation and subcontract labor, the sum total of all those expenses on those accounts should equal 206 Production labor to finished goods account.

Speaker 1  1:06:43
And they do right. Okay, so that's, that's more straightforward. Like, we'll just basically every will go longer periods on that expect just because we don't want to do the seesaw, like, go up and down. I think it just be more accurate if we go longer periods, two or three months. But throughout the while, yeah, they'll just work as expense accounts. And then contra account offsets them. Completed buildings is completely driven by what's in inventory. So and then production overhead will work the exact same way. So Drew, are we are we missing anything? Else right now? Like, is there anything we need from the thigh as as far as development on these pieces?

Speaker 2  1:07:45
Don't think on this, I mean, production overhead, we just need that depreciation.

Speaker 1  1:07:52
I am waiting on Whitney so that I can get a fast number so that we can

Speaker 2  1:07:59
um, one question on the closing. I was thinking about this the other day when we've posted to retained earnings, so we closed 23. And then we want to post the retained earnings. Should I make so that the income statement says well, we want to put in retained earnings?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:23
Or well, how are we gonna make our retained earnings numbers? Right?

Matthias Miller  1:08:29
For my understanding, at first this is this is a joke question but my understanding is use the under this might be good to test and the test system before we actually try to hear a bit accounting accounting tools accounting period, suppose period. So smiling here as well, accounting going to be here. This evening needs to be cleaned up. Close down on Oh, there we go. Yep, yep. Yeah, I think close graded. And so my understanding is that we have a special transaction type that we use to create the retained earnings. And that allows us to still run income statements for historical periods if we want to and also reflect it appropriately so. Okay, that's how you would do that. Because,

Speaker 2  1:09:29
like now, you know, if it says automatically created, that that income statement number is, I'm sure it's way off. You know, for 23 Because it's not, it's not the numbers we're using. But if we're creating the transactions, then we'll just put in the number that was supposed to be

Matthias Miller  1:09:54
we think would you want to do is close the period and then also To create your own, your own, I don't know how this is exactly going to work. But basically create your own transaction to correct. Retain earnings to whatever you want it to. If you want to show up correctly, you're gonna have to Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:10:19
good. Yeah. So it would be creating an automatic transfer, I mean, an automatic entry based on 20 threes ending number, correct? Yeah, then I'll just have to make an adjustment to whatever that number is gonna say. Right? So, you know, in this case, it might be easy. It's just to make a big sales or expense number whatever I need in 23. To make make that number match. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:58
I would think I would think so. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
Yeah. Well, that's exciting.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:14
Yeah, it is.

Speaker 1  1:11:20
Good. Well, I do like the the questions we had on these accounts, not posting correctly, and not not understanding everything, like when we did these actual cause? I mean, obviously, it's working now, because it's, the balance sheet is correct. Like, the general ledger would have to be correct. So?

Speaker 2  1:11:40
Well, yeah, I mean. Well, I don't know, what we did is we just applied the difference that it wasn't coming out, we applied to the buildings, so that it does come out. So it's kind of like we've just created the journal entry make it say what we wanted to say.

Speaker 1  1:12:03
But how's that going to reflect on each individual building? When we, when we looked at it our thought, are we we believe that buildings still in inventory don't necessarily show a variance that transaction just changed? Like we we slightly lower the value? amount of raw materials in each building. So instead of saying $1,000, on this building, it's going to say 990. Right. It but then if it's, if it's already been sold on cogs, it would show two separate transactions. It would show or it would it should show the same building was sold, it should show $1,000 transaction today it was invoice and then a negative $90. Transaction on the day the actual cost was applied. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:13:04
Yeah, even if it's an inventory inventory, I think we'll still have two transactions, one, the standard cost and the time it was built, and adjustment to inventory at the time the actual cost was applied. And then expensed out when it's invoiced. And if it was sold, then it's like you described those inventory then it gets expensed out there variances display

Speaker 1  1:13:29
it could you maybe just love two examples. What is it the accounting diagnostics are there well through you or maybe drew you want to do this I think be helpful to Yeah, show the transactions on exactly what happens on on a building that was built with obviously both had been built in that timeframe but one that was also sold and another that still in inventory so we could see the and understand exactly what happens to those actual cause like are the variances um,

Speaker 2  1:14:03
I sent that to you on Friday. I'm FDI issues was the tag.

Matthias Miller  1:14:33
Alright, so in this one,

Speaker 2  1:14:36
like, what I found in the ledger for the 109 account, was that the top numbers were showing where they posted 109 there when the building was built, when the building costs supply this 109 $109.34 was not showing there was no transaction in the ledger of this 109 account for that Like as of that date

Matthias Miller  1:15:04
as of the 10th 31st.

Speaker 2  1:15:07
The 31st, the 10th was there, but the 31st was not

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
okay, for 100 here

Unknown Speaker  1:15:30
the sky

Matthias Miller  1:15:39
so I think let me see this is a case Yeah, that was created Saturday night. That was the bug fix that I made up of variances in actual cost applied on two different dates, one of the variances wouldn't get applied arbitrarily.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:06
So, then that issue would be taken care of,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:09
yes, that's resolved.

Speaker 1  1:16:13
Can you just like Ben sent me a new button then that again, showing what they now show correctly? Or just for my reference to know how that

Unknown Speaker  1:16:31
how these were these two buildings?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:40
Yeah, for those of you go,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
I will send you

Speaker 3  1:16:50
service is gonna change respect, McCollum, let's try

Speaker 1  1:16:57
this, because drew pointed out that like this, this will play into your income statements like this would be an extreme example, but let's say your January income statement. Let's say you wait to apply actual costs for labor and overhead until end of March. And your standard costing percentages for those were way too low. You.

Speaker 1  1:17:34
But your January, February, income statements could look real good. And you'd say wow, gross margins are good. We're really hitting it. And then you apply actual costs for March. And it's like, Woohoo, the bottom dropped out in March. Because all those we were way too low on those standard costs. So the variances were all applied on March 31. For all the buildings that were built and sold in that time, period, I mean, knowing that is is no one understand that. It makes sense. But it's it's Yeah, gets into the the art of Finance.

Speaker 1  1:18:20
Good Well, I think we're all set, as far as I can tell. I mean, Drew, do you see anything? Anything else that you see?

Speaker 2  1:18:32
No. Well, one thing that I am seeing as a whole lot more variance, I just pulled off the ledger. There's a whole lot more of those small transactions. So instead that worked.

Speaker 1  1:18:51
I think this is great. I was telling. I was telling someone, the builders Friday that if we get this figured out and get this working, I think we'll have something pretty impressive. I mean, are we I still think we do. Are we just a slight concern? Is this going to be a beast to maintain something that we can? I don't think it will be but a slight concern that did we build something so complex that that we won't be able to manage it?

Matthias Miller  1:19:34
Like my answer to that is I don't know if we know for sure. But part of the answer to me is there are some of these things that can be reduced to a fairly to fairly defined process that a junior team member could pull reports and put things together and present them and you guys could could review and some and Well, you were a junior team member, and then go execute on. And part of the, I think part of the challenge in this is, the more it lives in people's heads more difficult it's going to be to maintain. But if we can get some of this stuff down on paper, in my opinion, at least, into some kind of decline process, if it's especially for the parts that don't happen every day, that's that's where it will get you get us.

Speaker 1  1:20:36
Okay, now I'm looking at your transaction breakdowns that that you sent via us, if you could just walk me through this a little bit. I'm looking at the one top left the transaction ID is 27028. So the building was built the 29. standard costing all that happened, and then 227 it was

Matthias Miller  1:21:02
sold. Right? Yes, with the raw materials variance.

Speaker 1  1:21:14
But why was oh, the variance? Okay, the variance is there, because we applied actual costs in January already. So that's what got it. Yep. 29, we have a transaction date, but we have no transaction that was what is that just

Matthias Miller  1:21:36
it's an artifact of the fixes I made basically variances were making and how much you care kind of impact transactions can have a always have a primary ID that's the record ID, the building numeric ID, they can they can optionally have a secondary ID. In this case, we're building costs because building costs can be applied as of different dates. The secondary idea is the date. So this is the old transaction that wasn't tied to didn't have that secondary ID applied. So we avoided it and created this 29 transaction below with it applied with a secondary

Speaker 1  1:22:23
on 131 We have that's when the actual costs were applied. And then again on to 29. Yes, that yeah, that makes sense that you used to have this report to work I think it had like sub headers where it's at building built building sold and actual costs supplied. Would that be possible to bring that back just it would be easier to explain to someone if we had that but if it's if it's a lot of work or

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
what was that? Yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  1:22:59
that's that's easy.

Speaker 1  1:23:02
Yeah, that I think that would help explain and be be quite helpful. If you could just I don't know if that's something you want to do now but once you have that just sent then update it the other thing that if you could show the building skin would be helpful as well on this report, but if any of that's a lot of work then about it

Matthias Miller  1:23:35
there's a while there's a different version of this report that says this is what actually happened there's a different version of the report that shows this might be what you were thinking find my

Unknown Speaker  1:24:04
sweetie for 100 and we've had

Unknown Speaker  1:24:13
because you're gonna find these things every year. Okay, GI issues 4138

Speaker 1  1:24:36
Okay, now we're both of these buildings. So no. Yeah. Okay, both of these buildings were sold and

Unknown Speaker  1:24:54
yes. Okay. Got it.

Speaker 1  1:25:00
If, if you sent if you find those and sent them over, if you could find one building that that still remains in inventory just so I could see the difference on how it posed to finished goods inventory instead of hogs. Sure, that would be helpful, but good. I think that yeah, put in a lot longer than expected, but we also accomplished a lot more than I was looking for. So good, good hear anything from from you drew. Um,

Speaker 2  1:25:34
you can send me that Excel worksheet you just were doing more just for reference, no matter that write down some notes and things on how to process them.

Speaker 1  1:25:49
Yes. Okay, well, thanks, Matthias. Thanks for getting us unstuck and helping us to find a path forward.

Matthias Miller  1:26:04
Absolutely. And then do you do you have an ETA on the on the asset file?

Speaker 1  1:26:10
No, I haven't been able to connect with Whitney yet. So I'm gonna try and keep bugging her. But today's tax filing deadline, so I expect I might not know, hopefully today, but don't hold your breath. That sounds kind of good.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:32
Understand. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:37
Sounds good. Thank you.
