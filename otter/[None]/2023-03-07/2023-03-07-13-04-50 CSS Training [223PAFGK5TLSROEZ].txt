Unknown Speaker  00:04
Sometime when we get

Matthias Miller  00:06
time to killing nothing else to do we should ask me about data driven marketing

Unknown Speaker  00:12
data driven marketing All right

Unknown Speaker  00:27
one

Speaker 1  00:34
you want to like hear about that now instead of the story adult stuff right here

Matthias Miller  00:43
being a very bad example

Unknown Speaker  00:58
alright so first item here is this report for oh it's coming after the CH report we're for CGA as well

Unknown Speaker  01:32
actually

Speaker 1  01:42
okay nevermind it's not this one. This is more for me to work on I thought there was a question

Speaker 1  01:56
the one that would be more maybe first talk about the zTp thing you had sent email about design recovery

Unknown Speaker  02:11
yeah

Unknown Speaker  02:20
so I think

Matthias Miller  02:21
bottom line is that we need to

Unknown Speaker  02:36
well,

Matthias Miller  02:38
when we bid out the next phases we need to dig in dig into

Unknown Speaker  02:42
what are

Matthias Miller  02:46
designed like we had one design recovery fee already which I think should be put on the incident as payment received.

Unknown Speaker  02:53
And then

Matthias Miller  02:57
we need to take into consideration in the in future phases additional design recovery

Unknown Speaker  03:04
Okay. Sure. So it would be going to be so that was the invoice if it was on and I love the design you want it on the high level design or the design it'd be the in depth design

Unknown Speaker  03:41
and then we have here

Unknown Speaker  03:55
26

Matthias Miller  04:16
We also had a $4,700 payment 3150 for the second half on the

Speaker 1  04:23
470 Well, maybe 426 22 That did not make it on here

Matthias Miller  04:44
you said another row for 3154 26.

Unknown Speaker  04:50
You don't work 26. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:54
well invoice date of the seven

Unknown Speaker  05:03
So that was second 3150 Yeah

Matthias Miller  05:13
total

Unknown Speaker  05:16
so that means we

Unknown Speaker  05:29
learned total cost estimated cost

Unknown Speaker  05:48
yeah some of

Matthias Miller  05:48
these numbers are a little funky here but basically we're saying that it's going to cost us if we're 60% done we it's already cost us 10k We expect it to cost 15k

Unknown Speaker  06:00
We have

Matthias Miller  06:03
we have about 7k that we need to collect yet

Unknown Speaker  06:16
but the main

Matthias Miller  06:16
thing is we need to make sure that we're on the ball next week or I'm sorry when we the main thing is when we build out when we do the estimate for the final phases we need to include the in depth design recovery

Unknown Speaker  06:31
yeah

Matthias Miller  06:36
and I think I had put a To Do In The in there but we need to make sure I

Unknown Speaker  06:46
was thinking

Matthias Miller  06:50
slash I don't know if it was even quite praying but thinking about thinking slash bordering on praying about profitability on the soccer side and I woke up one morning and and I was like, I need to I need to take a look at profitability on the thinking in that business. Yo

Unknown Speaker  07:14
yo

Unknown Speaker  07:22
yo

Speaker 1  07:32
so basically this would be when we go to price it yes when we go to price it

Matthias Miller  07:46
you can even make this a to do CCI and saying when you price this please ask

Unknown Speaker  07:52
us for the design recovery amount

Unknown Speaker  08:37
right

Unknown Speaker  08:43
sounds good

Speaker 1  08:50
and then we just need to make sure we keep at updating this we get payments

Unknown Speaker  09:42
all right

Speaker 1  09:53
all right, good and then ZTA stuff

Unknown Speaker  10:08
It matters. What? Track counts.

Speaker 1  10:18
So this was that bug that we had noticed the other week, where the combined hours for my estimated hours, didn't show up, even if they are incorrect. And we have proposed clearing the value from the parents play a blank report. And then I discovered that there's actually a duplicate job. Word, I come up with testing your roster, I noticed it. And I asked Alison, Nick about it. And this was next response here. Just wanted to go over that with you. And see what your thoughts were. to that. Yeah, I mean, I think,

Matthias Miller  11:11
did we conclude my understanding is that move we concluded is that it just requires us to be very careful when we write the reports, and we wrote this report incorrectly.

Unknown Speaker  11:19
Okay.

Matthias Miller  11:24
That is my understanding. And so

Unknown Speaker  11:26
I'm not it's a little

Matthias Miller  11:30
Okay, without going into the weeds. Which maybe we could, but maybe we should maybe we shouldn't I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  11:50
If anything, will be even that, as I recall.

Matthias Miller  12:02
Trying to search for test gods, that's probably not going to bring up the app hosting system

Unknown Speaker  12:14
we pull up

Speaker 1  12:25
your tractor. Right, you, you hours and hours. I mean,

Matthias Miller  12:37
they I think this is a case where it's very clear that it's an underlying field that shouldn't be it's even named incident stored in total estimated hours, which conventionally means there's something special about it. And they just literally put the wrong thing on and I think it's a case of programmer error, it missed programming and missed review and Miss testing. And it's just wrong. I don't know that there's really that much fundamentally, as far as design that needs to change except perhaps a reminder B except a fix it and perhaps a reminder to say look,

Unknown Speaker  13:17
you shouldn't use

Matthias Miller  13:19
if you have stored fields with you know the indicate stored in the name, you probably should not use them without a very good justification of usually it should be wrapped in a macro or something like that, you should not use them unless you've got good justification for using

Speaker 1  13:34
them okay.

Matthias Miller  13:40
I would just treat it as a one off mistake

Speaker 1  13:43
and just let the behavior be this remain as incident

Matthias Miller  13:47
No, in this case it should be it should be autocheck like that column should be auto

Unknown Speaker  13:52
calculated. Write that

Matthias Miller  13:56
about Yes. Right. It should be as it is. Yes.

Matthias Miller  14:06
And given that this conversation came up and why does it work this way? This seems like the kind of thing that would be good to put into at least into the dev specs for the related portion in the in the living spec.

Unknown Speaker  14:38
Ha what would you want to say there

Unknown Speaker  14:46
we should I would just say

Matthias Miller  14:56
scroll down to the next explanation.

Matthias Miller  15:09
And I think basically Next comment

Unknown Speaker  15:13
is, you know,

Matthias Miller  15:15
basically both of those paragraphs probably

Unknown Speaker  15:18
are

Matthias Miller  15:21
the grounds the core of what should be included there with some

Speaker 1  15:25
tweaks to readability and relevance okay

Matthias Miller  15:48
yeah, I think that's actually a really good explanation right there

Speaker 1  16:23
okay, so on the related note then the job that we were working on a while back the same thing when we noticed that it was happening Elsner proposing to validate it or they said validate against a job linking to a job as the ultimate hierarchy if it has an hour's estimate and then we put together a design summary here so that would be true for the the estimated hours and then it would also be something similar hmm for the finish to be

Speaker 1  17:17
forget what I did but is this given what we're just talking about as far as leaving the incident as is and

Unknown Speaker  17:34
what is your thought on this?

Unknown Speaker  17:56
Learning it's fine probably I mean,

Matthias Miller  18:03
this would this would then implicitly take care of the issue that we saw on the port because in this case it would have been blank because you would have had to blank it

Unknown Speaker  18:11
out when you're linking

Speaker 1  18:18
right. But then we did a report just show blank. Yeah. The report should show

Matthias Miller  18:26
yeah, which isn't ideal, but it's less less bad than the other one.

Unknown Speaker  18:44
Okay

Speaker 1  18:54
so maybe maybe it was keep the two separate change requests this one will do to fix the bug report. And this one was for for the validation

Matthias Miller  19:07
validation sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
This one is.

Unknown Speaker  19:41
Interesting

Unknown Speaker  19:55
Okay, sounds good. I'll plan to follow up on that.

Unknown Speaker  20:06
Next is since you're

Speaker 1  20:18
just sitting here actually, USC, whether it's Oh, yeah. So this was something we talked about over a year ago, actually. And then again, six months ago, as far as handling support tickets, and being able to do reporting and stuff. And looking at how to how to improve efficiency on handling support requests and whatnot, I think I must have had a follow up date.

Speaker 1  21:07
Anyway, high level, is this something that you would have in WhatsApp they were pursuing at this point? Or do we continue a little longer? With what we've got? And let Ben keep being the client support side of things and build things out from from there once? He's been a little longer?

Matthias Miller  21:33
My instinct is to let Ben seems to me with Ben on board. When we had just you.

Unknown Speaker  21:48
Even with you now, we're bent on

Matthias Miller  21:52
squeezing every last drop of productivity out of you that we can without killing you. How's that very quotable? I'm not sure it is. But

Unknown Speaker  22:05
I think

Matthias Miller  22:07
you're your time is very high demand, which is what made this interesting. I think, Ben is not yet at the point that we're experiencing pain because

Speaker 1  22:16
of his workload. And so number

Matthias Miller  22:23
one, number two, I don't think he's got enough experience, I think, for him to gain experiences or give him perspective of what's actually going to be helpful. Three, I think, anecdotally I think there's a lot we can do anecdotally in the short term. We all remember the FB client down situation.

Unknown Speaker  22:53
So

Matthias Miller  23:01
here's also insert a little bit of a philosophical note, I think one of the challenges. Here's the challenges with to do lists and project management systems is that

Unknown Speaker  23:17
the

Matthias Miller  23:18
there is a management process that needs to happen with that, that subjects whatever is there underneath current priorities without falling prey to the fat of the day issue. So businesses evolved such situations evolve all of that,

Unknown Speaker  23:48
and

Matthias Miller  23:53
I've sometimes had much higher commitment to old ideas that they should have just because they seem like go get the time.

Speaker 1  24:05
Sounds good. Side note, additional assignees. It looks like that list is full list of cch contact. Oh, and assign the Secretary of State the additional assignee probably not correct. That's weird.

Speaker 1  25:43
Another thing on the incident assignee itself there's some names in here that are probably don't need to be in here anymore

Matthias Miller  25:55
is in the only assignee itself

Speaker 1  26:00
like Leslie Knapp need to increase weight

Matthias Miller  26:11
soon assignee

Speaker 1  26:12
well yeah let's take him out that's actually probably well it looks like maybe it was worse before it looks like we should

Matthias Miller  26:24
have a it would be nice to have a managed incident assignees or a or even I don't know that whole thing is ballooned in deserves refactoring but contacts do contact

Unknown Speaker  26:48
for you contacts

Matthias Miller  26:57
all right ah see leads been Austin Ben. Aren't there some of these that I'm not sure which of his employees like

Speaker 1  27:09
there were some of those that last meeting maybe we got them off

Speaker 1  27:25
what works for the assist for the additional assignee Is that something that sorry, I have a change request for that. Yeah, we're changing the assignee that'd be a drop list multi select Drop list of assignees

Speaker 1  27:52
one other random question at the top of context list Dallas net period in front of us remove it is that was wondering if that was an

Matthias Miller  28:05
intentional I have no idea I've seen it a million times and each time it's like Oh

Unknown Speaker  28:12
that would be why I'm scroll down

Unknown Speaker  28:20
so I'm gonna

Matthias Miller  28:21
go back to the other that that Dallas and merge him into the other Dallas

Speaker 1  28:49
boom All right. That merge feature is actually a pretty powerful little tool.

Unknown Speaker  28:58
It is pretty sweet good all right. Well, that was easy. And next one is this one another incident has been around for a while.

Speaker 1  29:25
Okay, we had discussed a while back and could I bring it up for evaluation? Whether it's worth considering further whether we should just lay it to rest

Unknown Speaker  29:50
seems to me I don't know

Matthias Miller  30:07
We didn't code anything like this in already with the dev input Email

Speaker 1  30:12
Digest No no that's what this this change request here that database trigger one came from had to do with the empathizer CRC less I do best

Unknown Speaker  30:48
you can sittings body that was not a nurse here. Change Request request attention needed assignee. I think this has already been done somewhere. Okay, if if you have an assignee

Matthias Miller  31:14
change requests needing attention you want to email

Unknown Speaker  31:17
for that or I can

Speaker 1  31:26
is it oral change requests or is this yes it's plural

Matthias Miller  31:39
March 6, there's one

Unknown Speaker  31:42
Oh, it's blank there are a bunch of those through

Matthias Miller  31:51
here's one on

Unknown Speaker  31:54
here's an example of

Unknown Speaker  32:03
that email

Matthias Miller  32:05
shows you what it looks like

Matthias Miller  32:19
no, I don't know how the when I ran we quit

Unknown Speaker  32:22
managed. For example, right. That's this up here. Isn't that

Matthias Miller  32:39
isn't that the same? I mean, isn't that what we're talking about?

Speaker 1  32:43
I think maybe what this is talking about is that it'd be a database trigger that sends it out as soon as

Matthias Miller  32:53
in addition to nevermind well, they'll get a notification that

Speaker 1  33:03
but yeah, I don't think it's currently, yeah, adding that it's probably going to be over engineering because currently we if it's something urgent we shouldn't be pinging the person about it so I think that's probably correct

Unknown Speaker  33:31
oh yeah

Unknown Speaker  33:45
so

Matthias Miller  33:52
at some point I think this is the kind of thing that we could probably

Unknown Speaker  33:58
I don't know if we have a

Matthias Miller  34:02
Yeah, if we don't straight up just decline it we can set it extremely low priority

Unknown Speaker  34:09
and nine future.

Unknown Speaker  34:43
All right. Be knocking stuff out all right. And then next one here is price index. documentation on some stuff

Unknown Speaker  35:06
this is a bit I was working some documentation

Speaker 1  35:17
updating the first the high level design is what I was working on mainly today that is a pretty thorough place so, this was nice a wiki that we put together with some questions and things to consider in the design phase and then you had this together a while back. So yeah, just to revisit this and see what your what your thoughts are at this point or as this is something that we should keep pursuing

Unknown Speaker  36:02
Okay, I think

Matthias Miller  36:02
what you most recently suggested with Oak Hill Ridge genetics, what does it have? If I am involved, then it means I do. I don't know how to do this if it's not an existing system

Unknown Speaker  36:25
because

Matthias Miller  36:39
Okay, let's start with it with what we do know if it's an existing system

Matthias Miller  37:04
then it seems reasonable that I do a walk through

Unknown Speaker  37:09
and be like, Hey,

Matthias Miller  37:10
can we be here's what the outline is. And within a call or two, and then it makes sense that you guys follow up and say, Okay, let's go research all the data points and let's go find out what's missing and fill in the blanks bla bla bla, bla bla. I think that that's a reasonable cadence or something that's an existing piece of software or a reasonable flow.

Unknown Speaker  37:32
The

Matthias Miller  37:38
other Okay, but what about when it's a brand new system?

Matthias Miller  37:51
What I want to avoid duplicating is what I had was country kettle, where my brain just

Unknown Speaker  37:59
I had circuits breaking in my brain

Speaker 1  38:13
and I'm not completely sure what caused it. Good. Yeah. Because the kettle was a little different in that they had so much documentation. They were in between. Yeah, it was

Matthias Miller  38:27
only an existing system. Go ahead.

Speaker 1  38:29
Sorry. It wasn't like some of the some of the projects where it was starting from scratch, they had so much information. Oh, here's the difference.

Matthias Miller  38:45
Most systems that we work with are actually dealing with that. Okay, the systems I like to deal with

Unknown Speaker  38:54
are

Matthias Miller  38:57
a relatively low number of data points. And I think with this one, we went from a couple, two to three dozen to I don't know this is right, it felt like 100 right out of the gate. Haha, ha. And I did not have good. All I got was a detailed list of everything. And I didn't have a good mental model for what are the big pieces and how do they tie together and when I was asking questions to get that information, I couldn't get a good answer in my opinion

Speaker 1  39:43
I guess that's where I wonder if, if it's best if it's most efficient. For you to go in to Ground Zero first. Or whatever you might call it to the You sit down at the at the MP table and they let us hear what you who you are, what you do and what you want software to do for you.

Unknown Speaker  40:12
And then you pull the rabbit out of the hat and then we then we started examining the rabbit or yeah

Speaker 1  40:30
mixing my metaphors pretty, pretty intensely here, stretching them to rabbit, or rabbit

Unknown Speaker  40:47
So to that point,

Matthias Miller  40:53
another big issue with country kettle was that they did not clearly define in their heads, they had systematized it. But then there were all these weird things of, well, we call it one thing somewhere in one way. And then there's this, we call it something else. And the but they're basically the same thing. And normally, you have one recipe per batch, but you might actually have these other like, and we just kind of do that, like we don't really know, like, and so it was

Unknown Speaker  41:31
an init addition to that.

Matthias Miller  41:34
I don't think they are a systems thinker. Okay, here's the big difference. See if this lands with you, they are not big systems thinkers, they hired gay men or whoever it was to say help us with our systems. Gaiman was the systems thinker.

Unknown Speaker  41:50
Hmm. That's interesting.

Matthias Miller  41:56
And I think there's a whole personality around just kind of like a very pragmatic, non systematic

Unknown Speaker  42:10
personality and those are okay, like

Matthias Miller  42:22
John is interesting. John Lappe is interesting to work with because he's all for efficiency in his always wanting to do things do more with less. But he understands the value to a degree understands the value of systems and systemization automation but it's very different than that it's very different than Triple D where Oh goodness, and even FB and even it seems like all of these have some

Unknown Speaker  43:00
honestly, some

Matthias Miller  43:01
psychometric traits are something where they came to us they were already systems thinkers, or they had a system in mind and in play way before leaving for the game that's Triple D. We did not help them systematize it his dad put together this system he grew up in this system. I think he thinks systematically from what I can tell and it's not just a I had somebody told me how to do it it's a

Unknown Speaker  43:32
I'm a systems thinker

Speaker 1  43:45
Well, we would I guess circling around what we're needing is an approach that works for the systems thinkers and and that's

Matthias Miller  43:55
it. I think we have the one that works with systems thinkers. I think those come to us like another good example was that pole barn company in Pennsylvania, forget who they were

Unknown Speaker  44:07
Timberline,

Matthias Miller  44:08
Timberline overkill, but systems thinkers. But and so I think generally speaking those work well and worked well for me to kind of lay the groundwork and the foundation it's very easy for them to understand why I'm asking the types of questions and what kind of answers I need. But the question is how do we work with the key points and the is the key points and the

Speaker 1  44:36
country kettles and the there is that cabinet shop for acre. RAMAN something

Matthias Miller  44:49
those three guys we have struggled with, and country kettle is the closest to having work, but key point

Unknown Speaker  44:56
like I He said it was the money but I doubt that,

Matthias Miller  45:05
that it was I don't know, I think cashflow was the reason was it's possible let me say this it's possible to cash flow was the reason he was the excuse to say no. And the real reason was that he didn't buy into buying into our value proposition

Speaker 1  45:42
Do we have any examples of clients that that worked out? We wouldn't label us to some sneakers like Echo maybe

Unknown Speaker  45:57
maybe. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  46:04
And they made some pretty interesting design decisions along the way. See, who else do we have new

Speaker 1  46:10
light, new light I feel like is

Matthias Miller  46:15
on the system, so I say cuss way ago.

Unknown Speaker  46:18
We were just a pinch hitter. Graybar we were just to consider

Matthias Miller  46:24
we were a non essential on both of those. We lost because we weren't not not we were not essential parts

Unknown Speaker  46:29
of the business.

Speaker 1  46:41
Good zag is an example. Yeah, somewhat of a unicorn.

Matthias Miller  46:48
So what did we do there? That

Unknown Speaker  46:50
worked? Well, he bought the basic package Versante.

Matthias Miller  46:59
So we don't start them on custom. Maybe that's the issue. Maybe if we'd have a retail package for these guys first.

Unknown Speaker  47:12
Even if it doesn't, even if it doesn't work for them

Speaker 1  47:26
because that's Yeah, that's really interesting. Like this egg would. Yeah, he probably that would probably count as one because, and I would say now they're much more assistant thinker than they were two years ago brought in the consultant revamp things and oh, he told me something really interesting on a call the other day. He said that when when we did the initial customization, schedule, everything he wanted it set up where he could, when the job comes in, he can put it in the schedule, and basically walk away and forget about and like it's on the schedule, it'll land when when it's supposed to and, and manage and stuff. Now, he's hired his brother, brother, to be the shop foreman. And now his brother is actively managing that schedule, like on an hourly basis. And it is updating that schedule if he sees a certain mechanics running out of work, we'll go over the schedule and and see which jobs can be started next and who will adjust the schedule on the fly to to keep things running as efficiently as possible

Speaker 1  48:55
so it's a completely different mindset and approach compared to what he had initially meeting

Matthias Miller  49:08
and let me guess it's twice as effective.

Unknown Speaker  49:12
Probably so.

Matthias Miller  49:15
I mean, I think it's a classic case I'm guilty of this stuff. Classic case of trying to automate

Unknown Speaker  49:24
it has this root

Matthias Miller  49:27
key phrase abdicate by automation

Matthias Miller  49:38
I am so guilty. I am so ridiculously guilty

Matthias Miller  49:52
I just saw the time.

Unknown Speaker  49:53
Um Oh yeah, well Maybe give Amber

Matthias Miller  50:04
a heads up it

Unknown Speaker  50:05
will be a few minutes late

Matthias Miller  50:18
I think we should document and notate this and I think this is I think I think the question I think one of the questions we need to ask is why why did good good zag work? And why did key point country kettle in four acre not work? And should we be looking for how do we identify these people earlier in the process? Should we be looking to push them into a retail a retail package and doing something like that in order to get them to onboard

Matthias Miller  50:56
I guess the alternative would be is it something where you and Ben would actually

Unknown Speaker  51:01
could could actually work better with them then I could

Matthias Miller  51:15
I gotta drop so we can get over on the other call. Maybe we can resume any notes? Well, I'm fine if you want to show up late on the next one. We can get rolling and then I'm fine if we want to pick it up on your on my call then. Sound good?

Unknown Speaker  51:32
Sure. Thanks. Yeah.
