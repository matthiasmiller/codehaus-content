Unknown Speaker  00:22
Hey, okay, so I actually, actually kind of like this,

Unknown Speaker  00:37
having, Like, maybe three videos here,

Unknown Speaker  00:39
yep,

Speaker 1  00:40
and then just text here, because if I put the text inside, it makes every this is just nicely packaged, right? And then if I add a photo and text all that, like there, I want the focus to be on the product, but it's this ties, you know, it ties to this one. This kind of worked for the extinction experience. Robertus, yes, I would. I could throw another one here if there's a text on Saturday. I tried to translate Marx into text. But it's just, it's just so good as a video. See, I could, I could throw a couple more videos if you think those are good, if there are any other ones that could fit here. But I just, I just like the clean. This is very clean. It

Matthias Miller  01:43
was very clear. The one thing I'm really miss is not having Perry's photo in there, because, especially to this traffic, highly recognizable and instant. Oh, I want to go read that.

Unknown Speaker  02:01
And that would be a forum post. It

Matthias Miller  02:06
would be a Well, I mean, just having his picture down beside his testimonial,

Speaker 1  02:10
sure, but, but your outreach is to everyone who's on a forum. On the forum,

Matthias Miller  02:17
yeah, my thought was just to reply all to that and just say, hey, thank you guys for your participation.

Speaker 1  02:23
That's where I would put. Could you put Perry's post there? Yeah, yep, because I think by this time they're pretty far into it. So no, that's fair,

Matthias Miller  02:43
and if I can, and then if we can get Brian, Brian and Robert's things to dropping, just special thanks to, yeah, you know, to these folks who contributed, right?

Unknown Speaker  03:07
But I think this is a solid offer,

Matthias Miller  03:18
all right, so that the one thing I was going to take a look at

Matthias Miller  03:41
on the Vision day,

Matthias Miller  04:00
something like a clear on your vision for the next season of life and map out, or, I Don't know,

Unknown Speaker  04:17
yeah, vision, vision could belong inside the

Matthias Miller  04:23
here, let's do this

Unknown Speaker  04:27
on your vision, on your vision

Unknown Speaker  04:32
for What now here, we're

Matthias Miller  04:35
sharing a document with you. I

Unknown Speaker  04:58
get clear on your life. On your life vision

Unknown Speaker  05:06
the next.

Matthias Miller  05:19
I don't know, this seems very lame, But uh,

Speaker 2  06:28
which check those out. What Do you I don't Know, drafts. I

Unknown Speaker  07:00
i

Unknown Speaker  07:03
This. This sounds like

Unknown Speaker  07:08
this.

Matthias Miller  07:12
So what I would differentiate is next steps versus roadmap.

Speaker 1  07:21
When I think of road, I think of next steps, okay,

Matthias Miller  07:27
well, okay, however you want to communicate it, but I would anticipate is the roadmap is something more along the lines of over the next year, okay? And if the folks I've been working with in the two hour, one has been more like we're stuck. Well, I can't tell you exactly where you're going to find your Well, I can't tell you what your full path is going to look like, but I can tell you where you're going to find the next answers that you Need. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:00
so that's, so That's,

Unknown Speaker  08:17
where was it? I

Speaker 1  09:00
so What I have here is a little more outcome based, and some of this is more a little bit of a process based, process based. So I'd rather a simple we can't, it's not, I'm not saying we can't incorporate some of this, but I'd rather you know, these are the, these are the features. You're the given the short space. Maybe, maybe I'm oversimplifying it to a single line, but I just, I just like, I just like, the cleanness of this,

Matthias Miller  09:49
I feel okay, so then let me play my devil's advocate. I'm not saying that the complicated I like re going but what's most important? Like, I mean, I kind of already know what's most important. I mean, kind of sort. If I'm not clear but, but nobody's coming to me saying, totally, totally. There's like, I don't know where to go. I don't know what's next. Yeah,

Speaker 1  10:10
okay, so, so that's just, that's just the languaging of it. But so it clear on. And

Unknown Speaker  10:44
best place now,

Unknown Speaker  10:53
I should go back to here. I

Unknown Speaker  11:03
it's almost like,

Matthias Miller  11:11
Get clear on your next big I don't like these terms completely, but here let me i

Speaker 1  11:29
It's almost what if we made it next adventure, but it's almost like your your future year, like, like stepping into your Future. You now. I

Speaker 1  12:01
vision day. I mean, we could just look at the vision Day website,

Speaker 1  12:14
the personal strategic planning program, create a plan for your life and work so you can live the fulfilled life that you want and do the work that is most rewarding for you. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  12:37
this is maybe get clear on your on your real work

Unknown Speaker  12:41
for your real self.

Matthias Miller  12:44
So your real work perhaps, but I also think maybe I'm getting way too in the weeds. Real work is an iterative process, and there's a seasonality to it,

Matthias Miller  13:01
like it's, well, okay, it is, it is a little bit of a it is, get clear on your real work and what is, you know, what does it look like for the next season of life?

Speaker 1  13:15
That's the strategic roadmap, right? Maybe you call it a life, life roadmap.

Speaker 1  13:36
I mean Megan Macedo does the intake, where you tell the you know X number of years of your life in different chapters. It's like your life story, but you're doing it a little more For like your future, right?

Unknown Speaker  14:00
Um, um, Vision day.com I'm

Matthias Miller  14:43
man, it seems like an iteration where I'm reading some of these testimonials. Feels like an iteration of

Unknown Speaker  14:53
Rob Berkeley.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Did you get a new testimonial? No, I

Matthias Miller  15:01
mean, I'm just saying, I'm just reading his testimonials. I see, I

Speaker 1  15:38
maybe there's a hey, you get to like, peer peer into the future before you leap

Unknown Speaker  15:50
or LEAP, um,

Matthias Miller  16:00
I don't know. I feel like we're overcomplicating it.

Unknown Speaker  16:09
Well, get clear.

Unknown Speaker  16:14
I don't know if they know what they want. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  16:18
agree. Most of them are at a cross fuel your fuel stock, or at a crossroads, because they don't know

Unknown Speaker  16:25
for your next for your next

Unknown Speaker  16:34
adventure. I

Unknown Speaker  16:43
i Like be clear on what you want as a start,

Unknown Speaker  16:49
yeah, for your future self, for the for the

Speaker 1  16:56
I mean, ideally, I don't know if it's enough con, I don't know if this is where you'd say the the 100 proof view.

Speaker 1  17:19
But you have, you know what 100 proof view is. I'm not sure if they know what 100 proof you is, right, but, but this is ultimately where you go once you develop the 100 proof you signature program, or maybe you say

Unknown Speaker  17:42
cleaner on on the signature you on the

Unknown Speaker  17:52
ultimately You will get to this being clear for them. I

Unknown Speaker  18:04
Well, oh, whoa, okay, what was

Unknown Speaker  18:14
maybe we could do this? I

Unknown Speaker  18:29
Okay, what

Speaker 1  18:32
I mean? I'd like this to be the headline of the of the I

Unknown Speaker  18:46
Get clear.

Unknown Speaker  18:51
I mean, and I really prove You, I

Unknown Speaker  19:04
powerful.

Unknown Speaker  19:21
There we go. I

Unknown Speaker  21:05
Let me just throw this up. I'm

Unknown Speaker  21:39
For your Life and

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Well now,

Unknown Speaker  22:45
feels closer. I

Matthias Miller  23:07
Okay, this could all be boiled down to Three words, I'm

Unknown Speaker  23:24
Yeah, Yeah, that's, that's Yeah. I

Speaker 3  24:12
I mean, this is kind of this. This follows strategy, follows truth. I I guess this one follows truth.

Unknown Speaker  24:33
That doesn't well.

Matthias Miller  24:34
I mean, they're all supposed to, yeah, they're all like, I think them as fractal natures. That is right.

Speaker 1  24:42
I just felt like the wording was close to each one. I.

Matthias Miller  25:01
This could also be now I don't want to make it just about an action plan, because it's more than that.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
About vision. I

Speaker 1  25:25
well, I think what I have now, except for this one, is already

Unknown Speaker  25:35
close.

Speaker 1  25:39
Yes, I just think strategic roadmap is still process,

Unknown Speaker  25:51
receive.

Unknown Speaker  25:54
How is it process?

Matthias Miller  25:57
How's it not Well, I mean, it is, is a mini outcome to A bigger outcome.

Unknown Speaker  26:06
See a transformational entangle or flats I

Speaker 1  26:24
like the purpose of the roadmap is so you can have a fulfilling life.

Speaker 1  26:38
This is the how, that's what I mean. So we want to put the what. And that gets the what is 100, 100 proof you

Speaker 1  27:02
have. Okay, tell you what? What if you had a section in before the before the packages, where you just said, the the 100 proof you formula, or something like that. And this is where you give a little bit of philosophy, so that in the package, if, when you list 100 proof view, there's context,

Unknown Speaker  27:42
okay, that's just, I think,

Matthias Miller  27:48
I think something like that would be tremendously helpful. I think it's very foundational to what it is

Speaker 1  27:55
offering, yeah, and that way there's actual differentiated language from any other vision, day, planning, process, strategic roadmap, right, right? So you can still use those words, but It's, this is proprietary, right?

Matthias Miller  28:18
Right?

Unknown Speaker  28:30
Formula, Formula, Formula

Unknown Speaker  28:45
and then I'd add that As a section

Unknown Speaker  29:00
where, you know, The sanctuary and

Speaker 3  29:33
oh, the place or

Unknown Speaker  29:55
sorry, is.

Matthias Miller  30:08
I mean, is this a Okay, first of all,

Matthias Miller  30:19
is this a third person, many leaders, business owners and leaders, is this? For many business leaders, is this first person? Me, I don't think it's second person.

Speaker 1  30:33
I I don't think you need to even get into these bits.

Unknown Speaker  30:41
I think you just say, maybe you can, if you want, I was just going to have like a couple lines about potential, actualizing your potential or I

Speaker 1  31:09
like, this is a, this is still a A, it's kind of becoming A sales page. It's a, it's a, it's the I

Unknown Speaker  31:23
pricing page, The package page,

Unknown Speaker  32:23
I don't know, let me Like I

Unknown Speaker  33:35
adding stuff to the website. I

Unknown Speaker  34:38
I'm sorry I got confused on how to order this.

Unknown Speaker  35:16
Okay, do

Unknown Speaker  35:28
I don't think I Have it on The website. I

Unknown Speaker  36:18
I would say, I

Speaker 1  36:28
The answer isn't doing more by diluting Your essence, if it means diluting who you are. If what

Matthias Miller  36:43
I'm trying to point out is most people are already diluting themselves. Well,

Speaker 1  36:50
there's kind of a funny play on words, is diluting and diluting yourself, which you might incorporate, like dilute diluting yourself is turning away from the truth.

Unknown Speaker  37:06
It's two nuanced okay, but It is funny. I think I

Unknown Speaker  38:15
Okay, I think I fixed the spacey, just the wording,

Speaker 1  38:20
I like, I like your line about

Speaker 1  38:34
or so one more you say I was diluting my myself after diluting myself for years,

Unknown Speaker  38:44
yeah, uh,

Speaker 1  38:51
after diluting my I distilled who I was into a 100 proof sanctuary. Uh, oh, sorry, 100 proof version

Unknown Speaker  39:04
this,

Unknown Speaker  39:08
maybe having something like

Unknown Speaker  39:12
the sanctuary is,

Speaker 1  39:16
just bear with me is like the truth distillery, like, that's, that's where you get distilled. Like, that's the some tie into the sanctuary here, entering into the into the sanctuary. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  39:44
uh, doesn't I can't see that.

Speaker 1  39:49
It's a place of it's a place where truth gets distilled. Oh, it's the place of inner. New inner knowing where truth gets distilled. Gets distilled.

Unknown Speaker  40:10
It's the place truth gets distilled.

Unknown Speaker  40:22
I

Unknown Speaker  40:23
like, part of me is thinking like, maybe you don't,

Speaker 1  40:33
maybe you don't need, like, that much more, because I like going to i

Speaker 1  40:47
i like lead from your identity and intuition, not just your intellect, like it goes straight into the next. Maybe that's it. The 100 proof you is leading from Identity and intuition. I information.

Speaker 1  41:22
I do identity itself and intuition. I mean that that was my way of saying inner knowing. Oh, maybe you could say inner and inner Knowing.

Unknown Speaker  41:39
I just told who it was. I,

Speaker 1  42:17
maybe, okay, hey, get this. What if we keep this as the start?

Unknown Speaker  42:24
So it's

Unknown Speaker  42:27
enter the sanctuary, then it's lead from your identity,

Unknown Speaker  42:36
and then it's Andrew proof you

Unknown Speaker  43:00
how's that for simple?

Unknown Speaker  43:01
I like simple. I really do okay. I

Matthias Miller  43:06
love explaining myself.

Unknown Speaker  43:09
Let me let me try and reorder.

Unknown Speaker  43:11
Unfortunately, I

Unknown Speaker  43:36
Okay, check out the website. I

Unknown Speaker  43:55
What if we did? I

Speaker 1  44:08
I like that because it goes straight into past clients. Like, it's almost like, here's the here's the

Unknown Speaker  44:19
right. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:37
so I would the only, the only change is I would make 100 proof you not be a heading and just change it to like a bold meet the 100 will prove you, oh yeah, to match, not just your input. Do.

Unknown Speaker  45:13
Okay, refresh.

Matthias Miller  45:19
Can we make it smaller, not beheading and just bold. Oh,

Speaker 1  45:24
yeah, that now I understand what you need. Gotcha. Gotcha, okay, I'll make it paragraph,

Unknown Speaker  45:36
and then bold, great.

Matthias Miller  45:42
Yep, and maybe a period at the end. Nitpick,

Unknown Speaker  45:47
very nice. Oh no, yeah, that that works

Matthias Miller  45:50
well. And you could even do the same thing for past clients. And just say past clients include colon and it would, I think it would flow very naturally. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:05
Past clients, colon, you said

Matthias Miller  46:09
past clients include colon,

Unknown Speaker  46:19
yeah and then unique experience, guarantee, right?

Matthias Miller  46:24
You can look at that. I love it, love it, love it, okay, sanction free. Vision day is, is either, you know, build your life around the 100 proof you Yes, or step into, I think it Could be that. And then untangle roadblocks,

Unknown Speaker  46:49
blocks,

Matthias Miller  47:02
untangle road. Roadblocks for your 100 proof. You get transformational insight for your 100

Unknown Speaker  47:08
proof you or

Unknown Speaker  47:11
for your 100 i.

Speaker 1  47:26
For the one for for your 100 proof, you,

Matthias Miller  47:35
your the, yeah, I don't care.

Unknown Speaker  47:40
All right, refresh,

Unknown Speaker  47:46
maybe,

Unknown Speaker  47:48
do I change the triangle at the bottom to the to the

Matthias Miller  47:58
100 proof view?

Unknown Speaker  47:59
Yeah. I I

Matthias Miller  48:03
don't think it should be 100 proof you triangle. I still believe fairly firmly it should be a Venn diagram.

Speaker 1  48:10
I don't know, refresh your page and then go to the bottom. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  48:18
I love it.

Matthias Miller  48:19
Let's go. Sanctuary needs to be vision day at the very bottom, very, very Bottom.

Unknown Speaker  48:29
Bottom left. Ah, sanctuary. Vision day.

Matthias Miller  48:32
Yeah, sanctuary day bottomed out. I

Speaker 1  48:37
think I just like the two words because it is a day,

Speaker 2  48:43
fair enough. I don't care. I like it, brilliant, all right.

Unknown Speaker  48:50
Silence, this feels,

Unknown Speaker  48:52
this feels like, I mean, this feels like it could even be the sales page.

Matthias Miller  49:00
It's really tight, I think.

Unknown Speaker  49:08
And somehow we got the 100 proof you in,

Unknown Speaker  49:11
yes, without making it complicated,

Speaker 1  49:15
right, without talking about the pillars like that can come later, um, and it does have its own minimalist branding.

Matthias Miller  49:29
I love minimalism. I suck at implementing it, but I love it,

Unknown Speaker  49:33
okay. What is there? Is there a way is get started, good enough? Do you? Do you have any, like, email sign offs where it's like, I don't know if there's a lingo that you could have around under perfume, like I.

Unknown Speaker  50:01
It starts. It starts fine, but all right, I don't

Matthias Miller  50:07
years and years, years ago, I used to have be the best you, but that's you know, and dilute yourself. Okay, this is, I don't have a

Unknown Speaker  50:21
I think we're we're looking good.

Unknown Speaker  50:37
Some spacing. I

Speaker 1  50:47
All right, I would like to take away the line. Maybe it doesn't matter around Mark Jeffrey, is there a way I can add video just from the media library, or is that only photos?

Matthias Miller  51:08
Yeah, it's not gonna be optimized very well at all.

Unknown Speaker  51:13
So the snippet is better.

Matthias Miller  51:17
Well, I mean, it's Wistia hosted, so I would think so.

Speaker 1  51:23
Oh, well, then I could, I could. What I could do is I could have a short code to the Wistia site, right?

Unknown Speaker  51:33
Isn't that what it is?

Speaker 3  51:36
Now you have a snippet with the short code. I Oh, you're

Matthias Miller  51:47
probably right.

Unknown Speaker  51:50
I'm just trying to I'm

Unknown Speaker  51:52
understanding words, but not meanings. Well,

Unknown Speaker  51:55
maybe I don't need to do this, but I'm trying to remove the line.

Speaker 1  52:06
It'd be great. It'd be great if his eyes were open looking at you. Here, let me

Matthias Miller  52:15
see if I can figure out where the line is coming from. I

Unknown Speaker  52:25
All right, also,

Matthias Miller  52:35
maybe it's because it's a it's because of whatever container it's in, I think, yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  52:49
let me see if I can change his whiskey a thing in the

Speaker 1  52:53
thumbnail. Look that's not like a high priority item. Okay? So the next thing is,

Unknown Speaker  53:03
the button

Unknown Speaker  53:08
per schedule your 15 minute call. Yeah, should? I could duplicate the main homepage and save that for a 15 minute, you know,

Speaker 1  53:34
and then edit, edit it to switch it out to the packaged I

Unknown Speaker  53:43
page. But now you know what?

Speaker 1  53:50
I don't know if this works, as though the same page anymore for the package. It's almost like the payment page is A better sales page.

Unknown Speaker  54:20
Hang on you.

Unknown Speaker  54:43
All right?

Unknown Speaker  54:49
I have no idea. Yeah,

Speaker 1  54:55
I feel like the call to action needs to be either it's the main page becomes an amazing page. Which or else, did you just say enter the sanctuary button.

Matthias Miller  55:06
So here's the issue. I have biggest issue. If I'm going to LinkedIn and I immediately go after corporate, I will get laughed out of the room with these prices.

Speaker 1  55:22
Meet that. Go. You're not going to corporate. This is like a launch to your inner circle. So

Matthias Miller  55:29
if, if there is a i,

Matthias Miller  55:44
can we just take the schedule your 15 minute off the menu

Matthias Miller  55:53
from the homepage, I don't mind going to the 15 minute even from this page. I don't mind going to a 15 minute.

Speaker 1  56:12
Now you're saying, let's let's just keep the sanctuary page, not link it to the home page and you just hand it out directly to Perry or whoever. So it's always separate.

Unknown Speaker  56:41
That makes sense. Sorry, one more time.

Speaker 1  56:45
Okay, if you're getting people from LinkedIn corporate, you want, you want them to go to the 15 minute, yes, in which case, let's not include anything about sanctuary, the sanctuary page, and that's just a private page that you direct. You hand out so you so nothing, essentially, nothing needs to be changed, right? Nothing needs to be changed. You just

Matthias Miller  57:15
private. It's a little weird for Perry's people to have the 15 minute call up top. But who cares?

Speaker 1  57:21
Well, no, no, what I I could. We could change it to something else, like I you could center. You could center your logo, just have Matthias Miller in the middle, and then

Matthias Miller  57:38
scroll, yeah, and that's what I was thinking. And then, and then, and then on the homepage they would have, they've got the link anyway, got the bottom, or it could be, or it could be an about, or it could be, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  58:01
maybe it's yeah meet Matthias.

Speaker 1  58:17
The simplest thing would to do, but you'd have to change this later is wipe out the header and just center your logo, the

Unknown Speaker  58:31
100 preview logo,

Unknown Speaker  58:35
or my name, your name, it'd be your name.

Matthias Miller  58:40
I think I'm fine with changing it later. I think as I build out the, I don't know, just leave it the schedule your 15 minute call.

Speaker 1  58:52
I what I can do a I could target. I can Butch. Let me show you. I can just target the packet, the sanctuary page, and remove the button on that one page. Yeah, it would be, yeah, I like it, but there's nothing. There's nothing else up there.

Matthias Miller  59:14
No, it's fine, okay. I mean, just my name. I mean, would my name still be up there? Or I

Speaker 1  59:23
you know what I could have so I could, I could create a specific button for that page and it be like sanctuary package, and it will just jump to the package level we don't need.

Matthias Miller  59:44
If you can easily just kill the button on this page.

Speaker 1  59:47
I will do that. I will I can try that. Right? Would be the

Matthias Miller  59:53
drop dead simple. Okay, so next pieces are, I.

Speaker 3  1:00:00
Exclude, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
okay, it's gotten

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
okay. I like it. I'm happy. I love it, all right, so next steps on This is,

Speaker 4  1:00:42
I getting

Matthias Miller  1:00:49
Brian And

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56
Robert so testimonials, and

Unknown Speaker  1:01:30
August,

Speaker 4  1:01:38
eight, August, 21 I, alright,

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
but this is still enough that I could say

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
I did get some private emails about memos, whiteboard sessions. I

Matthias Miller  1:02:09
there's so much gold in this, in the way people describe their

Unknown Speaker  1:02:17
experience,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
experience, and there's some very interesting threads.

Speaker 1  1:02:27
You could link. You could link to a whole Testimonials page. If you had a bunch,

Speaker 1  1:02:38
I think if you had three videos. I don't know how many videos you get, but you already have Perry's, you got Roberta's, okay, that's one thing more, testimonials. And then you decide,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
if we swap out Roberta's with someone else's, right?

Matthias Miller  1:03:15
I've also noticed, I think you mentioned this. I don't know what any form of JV with Megan would look like, but Megan Macedo keeps

Unknown Speaker  1:03:26
coming up repeatedly

Speaker 1  1:03:29
a JV with, with, yeah, I That's That's after you have hit some home runs. Yep. All right, then you have a it's like getting venture funding. You want some proof, and then you partner.

Matthias Miller  1:03:56
I like it so I can start. I

Matthias Miller  1:04:07
uh, can we break for three minutes and Then keep chatting next steps? Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14

Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:39

Matthias Miller  1:11:57

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
You have a call on tomorrow with someone.

Matthias Miller  1:12:12
I mean, I had one today. Okay? One today. 15 minutes. Ones keep, keep rolling in. I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
and

Matthias Miller  1:12:31
I did the our LinkedIn outreach. And I should see, let me see how many,

Speaker 4  1:12:39
see how many connection requests I sent out. Connections, no,

Speaker 4  1:12:54
oops, connections, following, followers, LinkedIn, view connection requests, see set invitations.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:12
You know you could put your phone number

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
in the top right

Speaker 5  1:13:19
or email like, there's no there's no contact form, there's no contact

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
like, if they have a question, you could just put your phone number the top right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:48
my network. Manage all

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
my network.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
It's not there, see, all said,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:01
okay, 12345,

Matthias Miller  1:14:07
whoa, whoa, too many won't waste 123, I sent five. I got one connected. Sent the guy a response. He's like, let's talk next week. Here's my email which he hasn't responded back, but I should just do a this or that time back to him a you know which which time works best, A or B,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
and

Matthias Miller  1:14:55
but that's really, that's, that's a 20% response rate. I don't. Know that it's not enough data to say, but it's actually, you know, they don't tell you, but, and this guy didn't know you. No, we had one mutual connection, and that's it. Hey, that's great. No, he was, this was friends, you know, connections of Andy Mason. So he may have seen that mutual connection, and it may have,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:22
that's all you need, you know. So,

Matthias Miller  1:15:29
so that's, that's a way to keep driving forward. I've got, I need to follow up with, okay, so let me just, let me just respond to new planet Perry, emails, respond and schedule one day two time. Reply to Corey. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:06
daily LinkedIn, Cadence. Do you have any experience at all with LinkedIn?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
No, I signed up for,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19
I forget that guy's name. You know, he's the LinkedIn guys. No,

Matthias Miller  1:16:30
he LinkedIn goes pretty broad. Sorry,

Speaker 1  1:16:32
no, but he's, he's referred he and he has in his program. He has, what's the Facebook Cranston guy, uh, Prince, yeah, of he makes him available to his list the way Perry does.

Matthias Miller  1:16:56
I have no idea who you're talking about.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
I'll find him.

Matthias Miller  1:17:10
The main thing is, how many connection requests can I send without getting into trouble? Oh,

Speaker 5  1:17:19
oh, I to

Matthias Miller  1:17:24
20 a day?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:37
Connection requests? Right? Yeah, I could find that for you.

Matthias Miller  1:17:51
I mean, I'm sure TEN's safe, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:53
up to up to 25

Matthias Miller  1:17:57
up to 25 Okay, so, I mean, are you familiar with Jack Reamer? I've heard of him. Sales read, okay. His his promise is one, one booking per day, so 20 bookings a month, guarantee. I could probably beat that, the way this is looking. We'll see LinkedIn

Speaker 1  1:18:26
as a From what I recall, like a weekly limit. So just do 20, just do 20.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:38
A week 20, but wait a week, no, sorry, 20 a day

Matthias Miller  1:18:46
times five or times seven.

Speaker 5  1:18:47
Here's the problem. If you're getting the 20% take, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:18:57
I don't think you'll need to send 20 a day. Cool, that's

Matthias Miller  1:19:01
I never know. I'm kind of holding my breath, because I've had other cases where I run an ad and get a conversion in the first and then everything's so it's not enough, for sure, but yeah, if I do wait, that's like four bookings a day. If I can convert 10% of those, I'll be very happy.

Speaker 5  1:19:21
I think, I think if you make it easier for yourself, 10, just do 10 a day.

Matthias Miller  1:19:30
Why 10 in that 20?

Speaker 5  1:19:31
Well, I don't know. In case you want to like massage, LinkedIn system. I

Speaker 1  1:19:45
you know, going from zero to the max. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:19:51
not look is not raised as many eyebrows, right? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
I could, I could see i.

Matthias Miller  1:20:03
All right, and then.

Speaker 5  1:20:05
But personally, I think 10 is more sustainable, and

Speaker 1  1:20:16
if you your goal is 10, but you're welcome to go above 10, right? 10 push ups. You can do too many push ups, but your daily requirement is just 10.

Matthias Miller  1:20:33
We talked about, yeah, 10 by five, five days a week.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
But I

Unknown Speaker  1:20:43
You need a special, a separate calendar where you just have 111, or two days of the week for these sessions, so that you can have multiple,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:03
you know, you could have two in one hour.

Matthias Miller  1:21:15
Condense them down instead of scattered,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:19
and that gives you, you know, 15 minutes to chat,

Speaker 1  1:21:24
like you leave 15 minutes or 20 minutes before, yep, so, so nothing gets booked clear headspace, and then you have a 15 or 20 minute gap between whichever session and the next one, right? So at most you have two in one hour, but it's really an hour and a half of free, right? So to me, as long as you could have a couple days where you have,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:59
like, an hour and a half chunk for for a couple?

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
Does it matter if they're all like doesn't matter which days of the week?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:11
No, I don't know what your life is designed around, but I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26
and you want to block off

Unknown Speaker  1:22:31
your strategic vision day, Whatever

Unknown Speaker  1:22:36
sanctuary vision day have.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42
I mean, I guess that, I guess technically, that would be

Speaker 5  1:22:46
Nick talk to with them, right? They, you have to talk it through, right? Okay, nevermind. I

Speaker 1  1:23:04
The main thing is to not to not let your calendar be filled up by these little 15

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11
and then you can't do anything with

Unknown Speaker  1:23:16
your actual paid clients, right? I

Matthias Miller  1:23:22
don't disagree. I'm trying to think what I mean. Wednesdays are currently my most open days, so we

Matthias Miller  1:23:37
could potentially do Wednesday and I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45
I don't know

Matthias Miller  1:23:47
Thursday and Friday. What I don't like about

Matthias Miller  1:23:55
would actually be pretty okay with

Unknown Speaker  1:24:00
a vision day could be. What vision day could be? A Saturday. Don't want to

Matthias Miller  1:24:18
I like Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, because it gives me some of that. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:24
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. Tuesday's already fragmented. Thursday's already fragmented. Friday's already fragmented. Monday and Wednesday are my least fragmented days, and if I am out of town on one part, then be around for the other part creates just a little bit more availability. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
And then

Matthias Miller  1:25:02
the other piece is, what's my win? Inside, I can think of two guys okay to crack into the wellspring group. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:25:25
am I chasing too many?

Speaker 1  1:25:26
I would, I would do this. You have a few. You have three guys you can go after as far as strategic, you know, you were part of their community. You were part of the, you know, the head guy. I'd start with one at a time. Yeah, and work my way, because I think it'll be hard if you're it's almost like task switching, but between two different groups of people, you kind of want to be internally all about P Vargas, all about Perry, right? Right?

Matthias Miller  1:26:05
Is an extremely obvious low hanging fruit. Pete already told people that they should talk to me

Unknown Speaker  1:26:14
so

Matthias Miller  1:26:18
informally in the form, okay, I gotta drop I got another call. I might give you a ring in about an hour, so we'll see. The big question too, is sorting through mailing lists, and I want to do that. But Cool. Thanks. Yeah, see you.
