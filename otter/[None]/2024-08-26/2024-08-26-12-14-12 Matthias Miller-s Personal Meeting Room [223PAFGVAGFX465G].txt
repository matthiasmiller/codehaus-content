Speaker 1  03:57
Hey, thanks, I uh, I got, I got your link saved. How you are you feeling? Not

Speaker 2  04:09
too bad, right now, we'll see how it lasts you

Speaker 1  04:13
went to, was it your daughter's ball game on Saturday?

Speaker 2  04:20
No, no, just please have, I mean, hours my Saturday was full of renovation, outdoor cleanup,

Speaker 1  04:32
all that kind of stuff. So you got some dust, probably a

Speaker 2  04:39
little bit some outdoor, some outdoor stuff. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
Sorry, yeah.

Speaker 2  04:47
Anyway, there's some kind of little bug of some kind, and sleep's been disrupted with her, with her youngest. And so I know I'm not getting the quality of sleep, but I have been. We do so totally usually, usually, if I Yeah, sleep. Sleep, for me, is one of the biggest determinants of health, and I don't really get under the weather that often. I don't know it will work on that somehow, the timing doesn't surprise me, but hey,

Speaker 1  05:24
well, I've got tell me about the header, because I wanted to talk to you about that too.

Speaker 2  05:32
Well, this just adds a a little bit of a as a white background and a light gray border so that text disappears behind

Speaker 1  05:44
it when you scroll, yeah. So should I inject that? Or do you have a

Speaker 2  05:49
Yeah? I mean, go for it. I send it over to you. I think, I think what I send over to Word.

Speaker 1  05:59
And just to be clear, I just throw it in the customizer,

Unknown Speaker  06:05
yeah, global, global CSS.

Speaker 1  06:10
Okay, I just, I'm always nervous with code, so I want you to actually watch me do it.

Speaker 2  06:19
Actually, I have a another crazy idea, I don't know if I like this right here. Hang on, yeah, it doesn't matter where top or bottom. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:32
and

Unknown Speaker  06:37
the other thing we I

Speaker 2  06:45
we could also make it translucent, so something like that. I don't know if I like it or not, but it's kind of interesting. Better. I editor, you see that?

Speaker 1  07:09
Sorry, I haven't should I click Publish or now,

Speaker 2  07:14
here can I? Can you check out my screen? Dr rinzi, I want to show you something first. Yeah, we can also add a little bit of transparency. That's not bad.

Speaker 1  07:28
You like it, maybe a little more,

Unknown Speaker  07:31
more visibility,

Speaker 1  07:37
and then so it's like 95% I wait

Speaker 2  07:41
the other direction, like that.

Unknown Speaker  07:51
Yeah, what do you think

Unknown Speaker  07:54
I'm doing that? So then here, let me retype it and you can

Speaker 1  08:07
so I was about to hit publish on the customizer, but I shouldn't do that now, not yet. Okay, you tell me I should.

Speaker 2  08:21
Okay, take that happy to share your screen, I can double check before you publish, okay,

Speaker 1  08:30
and am I replacing the previous change or adding Yes, replacing the previous change. Okay, all right, if

Unknown Speaker  08:41
you share your screen, I can give you a sanity check. Okay, since I took it over, and

Unknown Speaker  08:50
then, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  08:55
I mean, there, that's not,

Unknown Speaker  09:01
not quite doing it. Why is it

Unknown Speaker  09:14
not the homepage? Did you publish it looks good? I it's not applying.

Unknown Speaker  09:32
Let me check something that one is I

Unknown Speaker  09:52
Okay, let me just. Let me just as easy, right? I.

Unknown Speaker  10:37
There we go, well except For the borders not showing up.

Unknown Speaker  10:55
Why not? I

Unknown Speaker  11:09
was that in the ballot that

Unknown Speaker  11:21
doesn't make sense. I

Unknown Speaker  12:12
block level I'm

Unknown Speaker  12:25
it just doesn't make sense. Whether it's not,

Speaker 1  12:30
you know what I know? I think I know why. What's that? Oh, no, this is, this is the default. I could if you want, I can create a dedicated header and I'll hook it. Because we're just, this is just, this is editing the default WordPress and

Speaker 2  12:52
also, let me try. Let me try one other thing before we do this. Yeah. So let's do we could probably do this

Unknown Speaker  13:10
and transparent.

Speaker 2  13:14
Beginner, the inner element, there's something else that's controlling the border that's not that does not make sense.

Speaker 1  13:39
You want me to show you the header settings.

Unknown Speaker  13:55
I valid property value. Yeah, let me try this. I'm

Unknown Speaker  14:30
Oh, I see some of it's transparent now, so

Unknown Speaker  14:34
the transparent style is

Unknown Speaker  14:38
that's kind of working.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Although it's a really big adder. I.

Speaker 2  15:00
Okay, yeah, there was some kind of weird non breaking space or something, and that is messing it up.

Speaker 1  15:04
I could, I can, I can reduce that. Do you want me to reduce it? Yeah, you can, because I have, I have a header padding. I can, I can take the header padding off,

Unknown Speaker  15:18
or just narrow it like, you know, I think you're going a little bit, yeah, something like that.

Speaker 1  15:32
Okay, yeah, oh, okay, but now i

Unknown Speaker  15:56
The issue is I would need to do full

Unknown Speaker  16:03
Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. No, don't do that. Don't do that. Just leave it

Unknown Speaker  16:13
right now. That's how it was. I won't I won't change it.

Unknown Speaker  16:22
That good to be good in

Unknown Speaker  16:27
there. Yeah, that works.

Unknown Speaker  16:38
All right, so then I

Unknown Speaker  16:46
Okay, so let me show you.

Speaker 1  17:01
I show you what I have for the payment. Okay, so we can look at the copy later. But here's this bet, I could add more testimonials.

Speaker 2  17:18
Can we go ahead and put Aries in. Yeah, right away.

Speaker 1  17:25
Yeah. Let me. Let me first. Well, we're, do you mind sharing that testimonials folder?

Speaker 2  17:35
Let's see, I mean, it's in the Cheryl. Drop the here. I'll drop the link to his here. Sorry, let's I'm losing myself. Let me drop in the chat.

Speaker 1  17:58
Okay, great, I can, I can do that. Oh, no, it's empty. Yeah, documents

Unknown Speaker  18:11
empty, various documents, let me that would Be not helpful. I

Speaker 2  19:08
I don't know what he didn't really say how he wants to be identified. I don't know. Maybe the bio bio has i

Speaker 1  19:33
Okay, well, I'll throw it in here, but I need to figure out how to do the photo later. I So for now I'm.

Unknown Speaker  20:31
Okay, So

Speaker 1  20:41
I um, one thing I would say, I would put Perry's, maybe even below this image, right? I like that, and then, like, it'd be great if you had three testimonials and I could just boom, and then whoever's doing, Brian could do this, or whoever I'm forgetting, your guys names, Brian or Robert. Like, ideally Roberts would be here. Yeah. So you have Perry, because Perry's is a general the art of matching quirky human beings to practical vacations, callings and destinies, and that would work with whatever you want to put here. But I just had get clear on what's most important for your life. And you're the chest, you're the king, right, right? We got to protect the king. So I love I play chess. Here's okay. And this, I have a little, a simple hover effect, but I think it's nice. And then, right you got three by buttons, three, yep. And then there's one line. You could add more here, but it this looks like the testimonial would add a few lines, but it's, it's kind of nicely contained,

Unknown Speaker  22:23
right?

Speaker 1  22:27
What I've done is I have I lead with sanctuary sessions, and then I delimit the time, six hours, two hours, 30 minutes. Should I call it sanctuary session or sessions plural? I have sessions,

Speaker 2  22:47
session because we're selling it as a one day. I mean, if we were selling it as a sanctuary day, sure, sanctuary day six, six hours. You don't need

Unknown Speaker  22:58
to call it vision day. But I thought, I

Speaker 2  23:01
think it's helpful, like, I like positioning it like that. Well,

Unknown Speaker  23:05
remember this guy?

Unknown Speaker  23:09
Oh, yeah, right. I

Speaker 1  23:11
do. So he like, you know, you literally have Bob Ramirez here, right? And Perry's done. I'm surprised. Where's Perry? I'm surprised I don't see him. But ultimately, ultimately, you could probably borrow from some of his stuff. So vision day. I mean, I'm what a great website domain, real that's beautiful, and maybe down the line you have a little two minute video on yourself, right? Just, just face to face, speaking. Okay, so, so let me edit.

Unknown Speaker  24:15
Let me edit. Sanctuary day, revision day,

Unknown Speaker  24:34
full day, I could say, all right? And then

Speaker 2  24:41
the only thing that's not clear there is that the this six hours, or like in meeting hours, or what, like meeting hours in like, you know, I mean, you know, realistization is spread over, you know, seven maybe. Be maybe eight, I don't know, seven hours I

Speaker 1  25:04
view, I think, I think all of that stuff, it's almost like when you sign up for, you know, a rosetta stone or a true seminar, you don't actually have the day's itinerary, right? So, I mean, I think maybe that might be helpful, but I'd rather keep this concise. Okay, now I could just say sanctuary day, easy, six hours. So I start with sanctuary, and then I go with the debrief call.

Speaker 1  25:52
Oh, you know what? I messed up. I the ordering of this is important, showing the higher value up top and

Speaker 1  26:28
so the high ticket item is above 1000, and then

Speaker 1  26:40
that disappears here the next 130 days of one on one telegram access 200 goes to 14 days 100 value,

Speaker 2  26:52
we're doing a 30 day deep recall on both of the first two.

Speaker 1  27:03
You know what I would with that with Perry's people, and then you get a testimonial.

Unknown Speaker  27:14
Can we Swartz in the

Unknown Speaker  27:18
What's that? I you can, you can remove it if you want.

Speaker 2  27:29
My question would be, my question would be, well, the best time for testimonials, immediately when the session ends.

Unknown Speaker  27:39
Okay, sure,

Speaker 2  27:42
I guess my question, it doesn't seem doesn't seem right to me, feels like over delivery that both Yeah, Vision day and get the same so I don't mind doing a debrief call, but it should be 30 minutes, not 60, if we're planning on 60.

Speaker 1  27:58
Okay. No, that's fine, in which case, I think that's why I had them switched, because I was gonna, I was gonna cancel it here.

Speaker 2  28:14
I mean, it is a good way to touch base and try to try to upsell them into into something. So I do like the touch point. I think the only thing that might have to change maybe a 330 day degree column at a $500 value.

Speaker 1  28:29
Well, here's one thing, yes, like, Okay, I'm not sure what the acceleration onboarding, but that's then they'd lose two items if they go

Unknown Speaker  28:42
right, right, so maybe, I Guess I would have to change The ordering here. I

Unknown Speaker  29:22
I think okay, let's look at it now. I'm

Speaker 2  29:57
I don't know if I like acceleration on point. I don't know what. Exactly, that's all that's okay,

Speaker 1  30:01
it's it's just a placeholder for now. I

Unknown Speaker  30:34
What if you call it, I

Speaker 1  30:48
collaborative strategy. I mean, this is the outcome would be more like, All right, let's think about, I

Speaker 1  31:04
the plan, the plan going forward, the practical.

Unknown Speaker  31:15
Maybe that's part of the

Unknown Speaker  31:24
this could be your consulting,

Speaker 2  31:28
absolutely I mean, it could be an invitation into higher tier consulting, and the only entry way is through, is through the visionary and then on the sanctuary experience. The only way into the fireside chat is through sanctuary experience. That makes sense. I'm sorry, so you could say that in order for for the I forget what we called it the highest tier retainer, that you have to have a vision day in order to do that. And if you want to be part of the fireside chat, you have to go to San Francisco two hour session. You

Speaker 1  32:26
I don't know if I'd add the far side chat now, because I think you need a small group of. You need six people to probably, to start with that, you can say hey, because you've done the vision day. You're all, you know, you're all given. I mean, I could, I could say fire chat, but it's not available now.

Unknown Speaker  32:54
It's, it's, it'll be

Speaker 1  32:59
available in 90 days, or something like that. So you can have, I

Speaker 2  33:08
hate making a promise if I'm not confident that within 90 days it's actually going to be launching. Okay, so, I mean, part of this was the idea was, well, we could have people submit their marketing DNA and their Colby index, and their their you know,

Speaker 1  33:27
this could be a team of genius. This could be a team right for leadership, for their staff. I don't know that's much, no,

Speaker 2  33:52
I guess where I'm thinking is, what are you thinking? Essentially, is here the last one. What do I think of the last one? What is the strategic advisory? Oh,

Speaker 1  34:08
this was just saying, like you're the you're the cons, you this is the, the strategic collaboration component.

Unknown Speaker  34:22
What with which they get small tastes

Speaker 1  34:27
of right? But this is, I guess this is more of you as a consultant.

Unknown Speaker  34:34
Got it.

Speaker 1  34:35
You could call this strategic implementation. I a

Unknown Speaker  34:44
roadmap, oh, I

Unknown Speaker  34:47
want to make or strategic

Speaker 2  34:48
implement strategic roadmap, or certificate or implementation roadmap, or strategic implementation roadmap?

Speaker 1  34:58
Yeah, I. That the whole point of it is, there's the, you know, this, would you say the spiritual, the personal, and then the practical, right? Yeah, so the vision Day is a lot of high ideas, but now it's like you could whiteboard it out for them, right? Yeah,

Speaker 2  35:26
and I think, I think the in the experience, there's some of that, but that's more like next steps. It's not okay. What are the, what are the three to four things that you can actually do? I

Unknown Speaker  36:16
should I add value or just I

Unknown Speaker  36:25
we have been

Unknown Speaker  36:28
overkill so much. I

Speaker 1  37:12
so it's they lose three things. They lose two things. They get the whole package. And

Speaker 1  37:24
I mean, this feels like, thought out. Yeah, it does like, I'm pretty impressed it this. This is just a great way. I of mapping it out as an offer.

Speaker 2  37:49
So there's a few tweets, and I gotta drop off, get ready for my call. I can, I can give you a call in, or I can get back on in about 30 minutes, maybe, maybe less. Okay, sounds good. Hi, bucks Good. Bye.
