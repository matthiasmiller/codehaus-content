Speaker 1  00:19
Little All right, do we have? Do we have? Do we we don't have a deleted table? We didn't bring that table into the source

Matthias Miller  00:25
data. Did we? No, we didn't.

Unknown Speaker  00:27
Yeah, this was afraid of I went looking for it. We

Matthias Miller  00:34
didn't think it was necessary at the time.

Speaker 2  00:36
Yeah, right. Open to the point where we decided it was,

Matthias Miller  00:41
do you okay? So, what do we want? We went. We know we went. I don't know. What all do we know? Do we want or need?

Unknown Speaker  00:55
Well, I mean,

Speaker 1  01:01
how much value is, is it bringing in deleted inventory?

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Oh, my, there's all kinds of stuff on these things.

Matthias Miller  01:12
There's a lot of stuff. Well, I mean, it allows us to basically just handle

Matthias Miller  01:28
these deleted contracts, but I don't know if we need to

Speaker 1  01:31
do we have a we don't have a status on the inventory, though, that would define it As deleted. Then do we No?

Matthias Miller  01:39
Be a $0 inventory? Yeah, but do

Speaker 1  01:42
we have enough information from the contract? No, I guess we probably don't have enough information from the contract to generate our own building without bringing it in. I mean,

Matthias Miller  01:52
yeah, well, I mean, you could put it as an other rentable product. That is true.

Speaker 1  02:04
What do we have on the contract regarding inventory information? Just, just the serial number and or do we have description?

Matthias Miller  02:13
Oh, wow, I'm really in there.

Unknown Speaker  02:14
If you can find the data in there, I'm going to be impressed.

Matthias Miller  02:18
You're going to be wondering what clones of your system we've been creating.

Unknown Speaker  02:23
Oh, I see what you're doing.

Matthias Miller  02:25
We're double dipping. Man,

Unknown Speaker  02:28
hey, chocolate is always better when you double dip. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
I mean, no description the

Speaker 1  02:36
source data record go to the source data records for inventory, for contracts?

Matthias Miller  02:42
Oh, those guys,

Unknown Speaker  02:43
do we have enough information that we can just generate the thing

Matthias Miller  02:49
without having to assist an asset ID? But why wouldn't we just do what we did elsewhere and say we don't assign a contract? In some cases, kind of like what we do for the customer deposit thing,

Speaker 1  03:05
because you're going to have history data on these, these contracts,

Unknown Speaker  03:14
payment history data,

Matthias Miller  03:16
but you were going to set the value to zero anyway, on the asset, right?

Speaker 1  03:23
Sure. But, I mean, you can't create a contract without an asset.

Matthias Miller  03:28
We let you for customer deposits. We could let you here just for imports.

Speaker 1  03:33
Oh, and we stomp a note somewhere that says it was tied to a deleted building. And here's the here's some information about it,

Matthias Miller  03:40
I guess. I mean, I don't know if, I don't know if I like that, but

Speaker 1  03:46
Well, I mean, the other option is we create, we we create a other rentable asset at $0 put the description in as deleted building, and we move on. Tie the whole thing up and be happy.

Matthias Miller  04:07
But we still need a way to you

Speaker 1  04:13
know, what's really awesome in the future, if you generate a building that you tied to the wrong rent to own company, there's something wrong. We could fix this stuff. You don't have to go and, like, reverse the whole dang thing out and kill all the transaction stuff. And, yeah,

Speaker 3  04:30
it's fixable. It is fixable

Speaker 1  04:34
because right now, in RTO Pro, the only way to get this stuff into the correct company is to reverse it all out of one and push it into the other one making these giant messes. I.

Matthias Miller  05:00
Wouldn't have any information about depreciation or value.

Speaker 1  05:04
We don't need it. It was, if it's deleted building, we don't

Matthias Miller  05:09
need it, do we? We don't have so this does not actually have the asset ID on here. It's just a non rentable building. Well, that's another question.

Speaker 1  05:21
That's not good. We do need a asset ID for a non rentable item, don't we?

Matthias Miller  05:26
Sorry, rentable other rentable structure, primary ID. So rentable. We you want a primary ID and secondary ID?

Unknown Speaker  05:37
Well, you're still gonna need IDs for for non rentable items.

Matthias Miller  05:42
So you need, do you need invoice number and build date?

Speaker 1  05:52
Probably you're beginning to make me want to go back to this idea that I had where the record is the same no matter what type of no matter what the type is, it's all that all just and we just give it a different type, and the type does nothing aside define the type.

Matthias Miller  06:16
It's just a descriptive field. Well, I mean rentable versus non rentable seems to be. I mean, that's a,

Matthias Miller  06:31
so what? This is a rental structure. So why wouldn't we just do this? Sure?

Speaker 1  06:41
Well, you could, you could call it No. You have the asset ID, the original asset ID, original asset ID, dash dummy or dash deleted. Dash deleted, deleted, yeah, and that's really all you needed. And then you can tie it up to that contract, and that allows us to Put history in and out, and all is happy. I

Matthias Miller  07:32
and Are you sure you don't want to pull in the deleted inventory history so that you know for sure that it's deleted, like in some ways it'd be nice to pull in.

Speaker 1  07:42
I mean, you make a point, because then we could literally tie it out all correctly to its record and everything. So why not?

Matthias Miller  07:51
Let's just, we don't have to do that much.

Speaker 1  07:53
Let's, let's get the reason. Let's get, let's, yeah,

Matthias Miller  07:57
deletion date, yeah. Contract. I mean, some of this stuff we don't really even need to import. But what's the problem with pulling it in?

Speaker 1  08:12
Do you have the CSV file? Let's just look at the CSV file real quick. It might be interesting just to see what data exists there.

Matthias Miller  08:26
I'm not sure what my

Matthias Miller  08:33
I know we keep going to shortcuts, and I'm like talking us out of shortcuts. So we keep trying to take shortcuts, and they keep talking us out of shortcuts.

Speaker 1  08:43
I know at some point we just like, why don't we just, literally just model every single table in the in RTO, pro,

Matthias Miller  08:50
well, I mean, because that's a little overkill, exported CPB,

Unknown Speaker  09:01
C, see where

Matthias Miller  09:06
did I put this stuff?

Speaker 1  09:14
Oh, I gotta tell you a funny story. Last night, I get a text message from my wife, and she says, hang on. I got to read this to you, because it's hilarious. She sends me, have you heard about the shed coin? Oh yeah. She sends me a picture of the the shed coin thing, and says,

Unknown Speaker  09:39
Jason Graber just gave me a million shed coin. I said,

Unknown Speaker  09:42
Yay, we're rich. And so

Unknown Speaker  09:46
then I went and calculated. It's like $2.85

Matthias Miller  09:49
worth of that's funny.

Unknown Speaker  09:56
I was like, all we needed to do is go to $1 now. I.

Matthias Miller  10:03
It so if you can get embroiled in the same controversy as what was that little the young chick that got her claim to fame and then sold Bitcoin and got caught in the middle of a scandal? What now?

Matthias Miller  10:24
The Hawk to a girl that was on Tiktok everywhere, Hailey Welch, and she started a Bitcoin based off of some advisors of hers, I suppose, and got a bunch of investments, and somebody yanked a bunch of money out, and it completely crumbled. And I don't think, I don't think she was intending to, you know, do any fraud, but now she's in all kinds of hot water, because, all right, so reason date deleted, model, serial, is it stock looks like we're not using stock?

Speaker 1  11:09
Well, of course not. It wouldn't be stock. Is stock would be? Would be a Boolean yes or no. I presume zero is no.

Matthias Miller  11:19
So what was the what was the ID? 2617, yeah, here it is, duplicate account.

Unknown Speaker  11:28
See that would be really interesting to know

Unknown Speaker  11:34
we have the goodness. We have all the information,

Matthias Miller  11:36
description, brand, date, Received.

Matthias Miller  11:57
Okay, be customer one, two and three. I,

Speaker 4  12:33
300 rose, is that? What it was? Yeah, yeah, 300

Matthias Miller  12:45
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  12:52
you care about agent. We're

Unknown Speaker  12:55
not going to run depreciation on No, I don't.

Speaker 3  13:00
I most

Matthias Miller  13:04
of the stuff, we're just straight up not going to use,

Matthias Miller  13:14
comments we're not using.

Matthias Miller  13:26
Mean, do you want more than this? I

Unknown Speaker  13:29
don't think so. Okay, so let's do you have? You have

Unknown Speaker  13:32
the description?

Speaker 4  13:39
Yeah, yeah, oh, there it is, okay, okay, go with the top, yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:49
Okay. Dell inventory,

Matthias Miller  14:09
okay, so, string, Boolean, no, sorry, date, String, String, String, numbers, zero decimals. String, String, numbers cost.

Matthias Miller  14:35
Okay, and rec new and hooky. This one's zero decimals. I'm not sure about this guy. This guy looks to be, we'll

Matthias Miller  14:53
do four decimals because it's can't, because it can be, I.

Matthias Miller  15:02
All right? And

Matthias Miller  15:10
then this is the,

Matthias Miller  15:21
I guess. But the rec note No, the rec no is literally unique. Story has nothing to do with that.

Unknown Speaker  15:43
A 300 Wait a minute, how's that?

Matthias Miller  15:53
How do you get, how do you get 302 95 items, rounding error.

Unknown Speaker  16:08
Wow, wait, I saw 300 up there.

Matthias Miller  16:14
Are they not sorted? I don't

Speaker 1  16:15
think it's sorted. Sort the column, sort the data. I

Matthias Miller  16:23
work by column.

Unknown Speaker  16:28
BF, there it is. I,

Unknown Speaker  16:43
okay, you're not wrong. Okay, so

Speaker 1  16:51
what did you say? Something about stroking my ego or something like that? It's

Matthias Miller  17:03
I give it Ah, he needs check boxes to check. All right, Sean, we're coming for you.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
RTO Pro,

Matthias Miller  17:18
actually, Seth, please delegate as needed. We have one new field. We have new fields, including a new database level plus x 30.

Matthias Miller  17:56
We need a model plus aerial plus door index key like we do,

Matthias Miller  18:13
please delegate as needed. That's kind of funny. Of course he's going to delegate. No, he's going to go do that. Okay? So forget missing asset IDs.

Unknown Speaker  18:36
Preview, new only,

Matthias Miller  18:45
now we're on to the next one, I think, ready for the second row.

Matthias Miller  18:58
Okay, here's the contract in Tennessee, but we don't have a state. It's Houston. Can we always just assign it to this to the contract state?

Speaker 1  19:12
We don't have a sales tax. What's the what's the account number?

Matthias Miller  19:16
It is, 93746, you obviously have some kind of tax code, but I don't know if the tax code doesn't have a state on it or what.

Matthias Miller  19:35
Yeah, that it's it's all Houston that's having this trouble. So you want to get fancy fixed estate on the Houston tax. Good, okay, do.

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Oh, no kidding. I

Speaker 4  20:29
pen, pen, pen, I need a pen, but don't I have a pen? No pen? Well, this is unfortunate.

Matthias Miller  21:10
Out when you're ready for more.

Speaker 4  21:20
Okay, let's see what is your problem, right here,

Matthias Miller  21:25
the question we must all ask ourselves, oh,

Unknown Speaker  21:42
okay, we're

Speaker 4  21:52
going to have some more problems with some other ones in here I see. So might as well get All of this for jiggered rejiggered.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
Okay, so now let's go. Stop, sitch, stop, stop. Where is my

Speaker 4  22:38
you go back to there. You you No, no, no, no, no, folders, folders, cockpit zone table. Oh, no, that's not it. Tech zones. So let's go sort all of these that do not have a proper proper nation, and then fix them, because it should be fairly easy to do.

Speaker 4  23:15
So you are a Tennessee State, TN, save you are also T n save you. I don't know what you are. You're a dry run. What in the world? Another T n save all, right? All tax zones should be fixer,

Matthias Miller  23:53
okay? Harry picker, all we need a

Unknown Speaker  23:57
no. Where was this guy?

Matthias Miller  24:01
Made a New York contract for cricket Valley, then

Speaker 4  24:04
we have a New York one for cricket Valley. Well, hold on, let me look.

Speaker 1  24:10
Wait, how's that even? Oh, yeah, we have a New York for cricket

Matthias Miller  24:16
valley, a CRA contract.

Speaker 4  24:19
Oh, wait, we have CRAs in New York. Okay, fine. He wants, well, fine, CRA New York, okay, fixed, apparently.

Matthias Miller  24:35
So hey, that was route four,

Speaker 4  24:40
which means that probably over here, overhauled, does it should have a New York. Why does an overhaul?

Matthias Miller  24:47
If that guy's happy,

Unknown Speaker  24:50
does over overhaul New York too, don't they?

Matthias Miller  24:55
I don't know. Maybe they do. I need a Missouri one for more space. Nice, hold on.

Speaker 4  25:08
Already exists. Wait, am I blind? Am I stupid? I won't answer that question.

Matthias Miller  25:17
That's a trick question I feel like

Unknown Speaker  25:21
and Missouri,

Matthias Miller  25:26
yeah, I do need a New York for Overholt and a Missouri for more space,

Speaker 4  25:30
for more space, more space, more space, more. Face, okay, more.

Matthias Miller  25:35
Face, more more. Face, more space. My Space I

Unknown Speaker  25:43
New York.

Speaker 1  25:46
All right, more space. How has Missouri everybody has a New York that should have a New York?

Matthias Miller  25:50
Okay, let me just rerun this and get a whole bunch of stuff out of the way. And sales tax zone should be fixed. You'll have to push those up again.

Unknown Speaker  26:00
I fixed the records as well. Oh,

Matthias Miller  26:03
you fixed them in my system too. Yeah, yes, indeed. Hey, we are making progress, dude. Look at this. We are down to

Unknown Speaker  26:13
wait for it. 52 two. Okay, what's the next problem?

Matthias Miller  26:19
Deleted asset IDs, which we know is an issue. Harry pickerall account, 3770, does not have a state he has a 1% tax rate.

Unknown Speaker  26:34
Way, no 1%

Unknown Speaker  26:36
whatever. Okay. Hold

Speaker 1  26:37
on. Give me his account number. Let me look at that one again. 3770, 3770,

Matthias Miller  26:45
inquiry. There are a few missing County I wonder if they're all the same,

Speaker 4  26:49
but that should I updated? Pennsylvania, he has a state,

Matthias Miller  26:54
but there's some missing counties well, but I could just shove in NA if it's if you want me to.

Unknown Speaker  27:03
Hold on. Leanne's calling me. Let me answer her. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  29:28
Okay, back. Can I turn on CRA for overhaul New York? Sure?

Matthias Miller  29:43
Don't know which that's going to clean up.

Unknown Speaker  29:52
But, oh, look at that.

Matthias Miller  29:54
That's a thing of beauty. You are down to, okay, so we're down to missing asset IDs. Which? We're waiting on Kansas team to do. We have a few sales tax issues. Okay, so what was the problem with picker all he's missing a county,

Unknown Speaker  30:14
a county,

Matthias Miller  30:17
all of these guys are missing. Well, most of them, I

Unknown Speaker  30:25
we have a final rate?

Matthias Miller  30:28
Yes, we do. Final rate is 5.3%

Speaker 1  30:35
so just shove na into the county if we don't know what it

Matthias Miller  30:40
is, okay. What do you want to do for this? This state here, five 813 Brian,

Speaker 1  30:46
five 813 let's see what's the deal with five 813

Speaker 1  30:57
Oh, cool. No tax zone. How about that? That's interesting. Wow. Okay,

Speaker 4  31:10
he's cricket Valley, so we could theoretically hit tax jar for him. Let's see no open agreements for this customer. So I can't update that.

Unknown Speaker  31:20
I He's North Carolina.

Speaker 4  31:31
Okay, so let's just do this. Let's go look up the address. I can't stomp it in, though that's the only bad part. 200 page drive 201, page. Drive 201, page.

Matthias Miller  31:47
Drive I mean, was he taxable, or is he exempt in some way? No, he was taxable. Can I stop in NA for cities, if I don't know, the city Sure, should pull it off soon. Address, okay, so

Speaker 1  32:14
where is, let's go find where is the contracts, and how do I find this guy, or can you send you drop? What was the 5815, yeah, I know I'm thinking out loud as I'm talking.

Matthias Miller  32:36
Out loud while I'm thinking. You don't ever

Unknown Speaker  32:40
think out loud what I'm talking or talk out loud while I'm thinking.

Unknown Speaker  32:45
Some people talk out loud without thinking. This is true.

Speaker 1  32:50
58 Okay, count number 5813 here's this guy. Is this guy? This is a shed Central.

Speaker 4  32:57
Wait, shouldn't I have a customer name in here? In here somewhere? No, don't. We don't, don't we field the customer name on the contract. We don't. Okay? So where is the

Speaker 1  33:18
okay tax zone? I don't know what for tech zone, but if I do a new tech zone, if I just go ahead and stomp in the information, we

Matthias Miller  33:33
try to look it up off the tech zone.

Unknown Speaker  33:42
Okay, hold on, I can figure this out. Ash County. Let's go.

Matthias Miller  33:46
Is there another way to I mean? Because the only thing that's, I mean, if we don't

Unknown Speaker  33:51
have a tax zone, I'll get there. Just bear with hey, if that was a

Speaker 4  34:11
Oh, great city search. What's the city? West Jefferson? I know that's in here.

Speaker 4  34:25
West Jefferson. Well, we do have, I thought. I thought, North Carolina, West Jefferson, West Jefferson. I was sure we had this. No West Union. I spewing

Matthias Miller  34:48
him check back our psgsi.

Unknown Speaker  34:57
Okay.

Speaker 4  35:10
What's the county? Ashe County. Ashe County. Do we have an Ashe County?

Speaker 4  35:21
Ashe County, look at air. We're going to go with TJ, oh 548, TJ, oh 548, where's my text zone?

Unknown Speaker  35:47
Come on, where is it?

Matthias Miller  35:54
Okay? These are all missing assets. So that's good, dude. We're ready for payments, man.

Speaker 1  36:05
All right. Hold on. I'm almost done. I'm almost got this guy fixed, too, 548,

Unknown Speaker  36:10
all right.

Speaker 1  36:11
Okay, you can, Mr. Pickerel, should, should work now.

Matthias Miller  36:15
Should work now. Okay, pickerel, let's see if you're working. Yeah, let's just do this. We'll read it. Run this guy, new contracts. Run, see if we create one record. Yep, all right, missing customer, like these bogus ones and the missing asset, deleted assets are the only ones we have left on contracts.

Unknown Speaker  36:40
Wow, that didn't take long.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
Look at that. All right now payments, you're

Unknown Speaker  36:52
going to have fun with payments.

Matthias Miller  36:54
I'm trying to sound excited about this. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 1  37:09
So, okay, so let's see what was search contracts, customer name, whoa, a giga pick, a rental company. Why? Why would I have to do that? What was? Who was picker? All, who was he? He was, oh, I'm already closed him. You don't remember.

Matthias Miller  37:31
Well, let's search for customers. We can find him without the

Speaker 1  37:33
oh, by the way, our contract search cannot, does not, should not be dependent on rental company. It really shouldn't you want to be able to search all okay? Harry picker owner, what do we got? 3770 so let's just start the 30 770, Harry pickerel, look at there he is. Look at that Holy moly. Look at that contract, boom, boom. Ka Boomer. Look at that. Look at that. That's a thing of interest.

Matthias Miller  38:06
Kabumba, not to be confused with cup boomba. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  38:08
so it doesn't have a resolution on him, though.

Matthias Miller  38:12
That's because he was a, yeah, he does early payoff where,

Unknown Speaker  38:18
why does your show early pay off of mine doesn't?

Matthias Miller  38:21
Harry picker, all three, 770, you're on the customer

Unknown Speaker  38:24
deposit. What I'm on? The contract?

Matthias Miller  38:28
Which contract? What's the asset? Doesn't have an asset. What's the ID? Contract? ID? Am I an idiot? Not under normal circumstances, what's the contract ID?

Speaker 5  38:47
Hold on. Hold on, what am I?

Speaker 1  38:51
Oh, okay, I'm an idiot. But why did it pull up that one? It's the customer deposit.

Matthias Miller  39:01
Because the entry date was before the get a deposit, before the other contract.

Speaker 4  39:11
But that's the only one that's showing up as a contract.

Speaker 1  39:15
Why is the other contract not showing up where? Oh, because it's complete. Oh because, I mean, because I'm dumb.

Unknown Speaker  39:26
Hold on, I'm just, I'm just dumb.

Speaker 1  39:34
Active contracts, how about we not look in active contracts? How about that? How about we look up completed contracts. Okay, we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to think through this a little bit for contract search. Well, maybe we'll just get used to, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  39:47
Okay, well, we, I mean, theoretically we should group and always search everything and just show the other contracts down the bottom. I don't know, but that might get too long, so I don't know.

Speaker 1  39:55
Well, I think we need to. We're gonna need a simplified contract search. But, I mean, then again, I. What I would do, but, yeah, but nothing for right now. Okay, I'm just gonna shut

Matthias Miller  40:03
up. Okay, we have a okay. Where do we

Speaker 3  40:07
I don't even want to think about this.

Matthias Miller  40:11
Where do we start?

Speaker 1  40:13
Do we need to file sales tax reports? Wait, do you have input on where the sales tax report should go on the menu so that it works for no accounting versions. Do we need to file sales text for invoices? Invoices? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  40:32
here, hang on. Can

Matthias Miller  40:36
we, oh, hang on? No. Can we have a an Accounting tab all the time, and if Dwayne wants to advertise for full accounting in that tab, we can do so.

Speaker 1  40:53
Well, here's the here's the deal that the definition between someone who's using accounting and who's not using accounting. Well, no, that's not true. It's gonna say it has an accounting impact or not. But that may not that may not necessarily be true. But I guess if we have no accounting companies and we have no accounting impact, then theoretically they're not using accounting well.

Matthias Miller  41:10
We're going to literally remove the accounting system from their system. They're not going to have those records in there. Oh, that's the plan we have this way to advertise features. I forget exactly how it works, but we can show you the Accounting tab. You'll have your sales tax reports, and then we'll have, we can have, like, a dummy something or other, and you can click on it and says, Oh, if you want to upgrade to accounting, you know, ask us how kind of thing Gotcha. So that's what I would recommend.

Speaker 1  41:38
Got you. I got you at this point, we're not even dude, I am doing something really crazy,

Unknown Speaker  41:47
like unfest ending crazy. You ready for this?

Speaker 1  41:53
Yes, we're going down to three tier levels, and we're cutting the revenue almost in half, and we're going to generate it from the credit card side. I'm going to make, I'm going to make RTO smart so freakingly Scared. They're going to probably be, yes, yeah, we're going to wait. I am, I am, literally. So I had, I had started out with a base price plus contract price plus user price. Well, no, sorry, I started out with a 1% nobody liked that. So then I went down to a base price plus contract price, but, and we're dumping the contract price, we're getting rid of that.

Matthias Miller  42:40
It's just a user price,

Speaker 1  42:41
well, and so it'll be base rate. So lowest rate, I think we're going to go 500 the middle, up to, is it 1000 contracts or, I think, and then it goes to 750 base price, and then over 3000 I think, or, yeah, something like that. Then it goes to basic, $1,000 999, the free user category that silver loom gives. But here's, here's the whole intent. The whole intent is, we're going to go make it off a credit card charges, and we're just going to say it out loud and and so that so, because I want to so, so so radically Yank market share away from anybody else, that it becomes a non point, right? But it really it is going to put the squeeze on like I don't. I think I can, I can. I think we can do this and, and, yeah, on the front end, we take a revenue hit, but on the back end, I think we pull way more market share. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:07
But anyway, why didn't I tell you that I don't remember

Matthias Miller  44:25
Okay, so let's go figure out payments. Where do we even start? We have, we have web payments.

Speaker 1  44:59
Oh and. And and I doubled the price of my onboarding cost.

Speaker 5  45:05
I'm like, You know what this is, dumb. I'm going to charge more for onboarding cap going through this onboarding process. I'm like, Yeah, we need to charge more.

Speaker 1  45:16
Yep, I think the minimum. I think the minimum is going to be 3500 bucks, or $2 per contract, whichever is greater, whichever is greater, yep. Because after untangling, I don't know how many of these messes we would be already losing money on the amount of time we spent. It's terrible, but I mean, hopefully we are have, we have nailed down 98% of all issues that we're going to run into, and there'll be another 2% that we haven't yet.

Matthias Miller  45:50
Hopefully, well, I that's optimistic, but I appreciate your

Unknown Speaker  45:58
optimism. You should have pulled the stroking your ego. Comment,

Matthias Miller  46:01
yeah, right, yeah. Well, thanks. I have much lower confidence. Did you hear about the self driving car that parked in front of a moving train? Yes, it's that kind of a feeling.

Speaker 5  46:16
News, self driving car parked in front of a of train.

Speaker 3  46:20
I wait what?

Matthias Miller  46:41
Oh, my. So anyway, that's how I feel about your 98 99% onboarding thing.

Speaker 5  46:51
They're gonna be ending up going down a railroad track and ending up in front of a moving track.

Matthias Miller  46:56
I got my running shoes on. Man, I'm gonna duck. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  47:07
history schema, history table,

Matthias Miller  47:10
history table,

Unknown Speaker  47:12
oh yeah, oh yeah.

Speaker 1  47:15
Try it. See if I can get my Midwestern accent going on here.

Matthias Miller  47:20
I'm too far from the dutchy side to really That's true. That went off, but it's been too many minutes.

Speaker 5  47:29
Look at that record count number just crawling up over there.

Matthias Miller  47:34
Yeah, this is going to be one. A

Unknown Speaker  47:36
doozy. It's going to be a doozy.

Matthias Miller  47:42
GRP, days late. But these are payments, not

Unknown Speaker  47:49
are these payments? Yeah, they are.

Matthias Miller  47:54
Does he track Amount Due in any way besides just another month, another dollar? No. So we effectively have to incur fees ourselves. Wait a minute. I uh,

Unknown Speaker  48:27
hang on. Bear with me for a moment. I'm gonna go look something I'm

Speaker 4  48:43
Yeah, that's exactly right. We do not

Speaker 1  48:50
heat tracks when it's paid, when it was due, when the next due is the amount that was paid. Basically, what did we receive? But it never defines what was actually due. You're right.

Unknown Speaker  49:02
100% right.

Matthias Miller  49:18
I just want to, I don't have hair, but I want to pull it out. I'm

Unknown Speaker  49:25
sure you can find some somewhere.

Speaker 5  49:34
Is, this is, this is what's the most annoying thing I could say right now, this is why you get paid the big bucks.

Matthias Miller  49:45
Probably Okay, so I'm going to, I think the problem is, like, there's no, I mean, add on top of this loosey goosey due date. Oh yeah, wait, oh yeah, due date stuff. It's just horrible.

Matthias Miller  50:14
I almost wonder

Speaker 1  50:20
I'm going to tell you what's going to happen. We're going to chat about this until we just give up, and then sometime tonight, in the middle of the night, it's going to come to you. It's going to be revolutionary.

Matthias Miller  50:35
Well, my thought was less dramatic than that, but I like yours, my thought was pick one type of contract to handle, and not just one type of contract, but one single contract, and go handle it. And come up with a way to see if it ties out. And then once you do that, see how many other contracts you can apply that to and tie out. And now you have a whole bundle of other things with other stuff going on, whatever that ends up being. And then you go, handle, pick one of those. See if you can get a tie out. See what else ties out now. And you're on to the next one. I'm assuming that fundamentally contract balance, comparing contract balance with what we come up with versus what they come up with, that's easy. I mean, that's the, that's the, that's the real well, do they show they don't, they don't have any calculation that tells us what the EPO or anything like that is. Do they, or like, a the cash price, the remaining cash price, or anything like that.

Speaker 6  52:01
I mean, why would we?

Speaker 1  52:08
They on the contract, they give us the contract amount. So we have the original like, what they store as what the amount was. We have rental paid. So theoretically, we, if you subtract those two numbers, you should come up with a contract balance.

Unknown Speaker  52:29
Okay? I mean, I think

Matthias Miller  52:35
that's basically it so.

Speaker 1  52:37
But as far as, as far as, he does not store the EPO or the contract balance anywhere to my knowledge. So let's, but I like your idea about let's take, let's take the known inputs and see if we can reverse engineer to come out correct

Unknown Speaker  53:07
on one contract.

Matthias Miller  53:10
The first thing that we should do, would you want to pick a contract? I

Unknown Speaker  53:18
instinctively want to have a fairly long contract.

Matthias Miller  53:22
Yeah. I mean, it seems like that

Speaker 1  53:25
you could go, I would go active contracts and look at start dates, and then rattle a couple at me, and let's look them up.

Matthias Miller  53:38
Okay, let's do contracts. I have to search by rental company, not anymore. Oh, we do allow blanks, which is required.

Unknown Speaker  53:51
Well, let's not require it. Yeah, I'll

Matthias Miller  54:01
have contract start date. So let's go with a start date of like, well, let's use,

Speaker 1  54:06
let's, let's, let's actually go put a rental company and so we can look at like, cricket Valley or something.

Matthias Miller  54:13
Okay, let's go cricket Valley. Let's do a one, 120, 461, 24 four. Let's go look for something with a little bit of age on it. And then let's go into Terry James, 4454,

Unknown Speaker  54:36
is that a contract number?

Matthias Miller  54:38
That's contract number, okay?

Speaker 1  54:43
And we have got a yeah, nice, long history on him, and he is not past due. So yes, he has paid 24 months out of a 48 month contract. So he's dead halfway

Unknown Speaker  54:56
through. All right,

Matthias Miller  54:58
let's try this report. It's not. Bad idea. RP, source data history table, all right. RP, source data history, contract equals. This cannot compare string or number. That's what I meant. And oh, let's show the store. Make sure he's all from the same store. I said, store which is spelled s, t, O, R, E,

Unknown Speaker  55:35
all right. So

Matthias Miller  55:37
now we need the trans date. I'm going to assume and we need the due date. The due date would be the period date, trans date,

Matthias Miller  56:03
the amount, which would be rent.

Speaker 4  56:09
TRP, Oh, does he store the oh, he looks at he stores his the tax zone on there too. That's cool.

Matthias Miller  56:19
That is cool. That's going to be helpful,

Speaker 1  56:23
because that should give us that'll give us history on what tax zone they were under.

Matthias Miller  56:28
Well, I mean, the tax rate's going to be wrong, but we at least know what they're under. I mean, it could be wrong, and we do have the tax rate, but we don't know what parts were taxable. That's the fun thing. Nothing, a little inference can't solve. Okay, so now we have, what does GRB stand for? GRP stand for DEM?

Unknown Speaker  56:51
I think that's Damage Waiver fee.

Matthias Miller  56:55
I'm confident. I'm pretty confident it is, but I was just curious, yeah, the 427,

Unknown Speaker  57:00
is less sales tax.

Speaker 3  57:05
This would be,

Matthias Miller  57:19
Oh, not that. I Okay, we got rent. Well,

Matthias Miller  57:36
we're going to do this. We're

Unknown Speaker  58:05
this would be fees

Unknown Speaker  58:18
and payments period.

Matthias Miller  58:29
The number due date, number days override, I don't know how we want to handle that.

Unknown Speaker  58:40
Due date.

Unknown Speaker  58:52
So total,

Matthias Miller  59:01
I keep going to the wrong side. Trust, mount,

Matthias Miller  59:11
tax, we can get total forgiveness, reason and payment date. Okay, so let's start with that.

Matthias Miller  59:30
Event Type, the adjustment type dates through.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
You, this is

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
the ugly part. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:00:30
girl, I, period, I

Matthias Miller  1:00:57
Okay, we Copy this guy. We've got period event type, we have,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
adjustment type.

Matthias Miller  1:01:22
Adjustment type, due date.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:25
Due date is four,

Matthias Miller  1:01:36
subtotal and cash price, amount five and six.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
Have taxable seven

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
period date, we have event type. We have adjustment type. This is all just boring, plumbing goodness. We have

Unknown Speaker  1:02:45
due date,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
sub total I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:26
you have the cash price and

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
okay so period date event type, adjustment type due date subfield, tax, this guy, six, I'm missing one. What am I missing? Period event type, due date subfield or cash price index,

Matthias Miller  1:04:06
period, event, type, adjustment, type, to date, subtotal, cash price amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15
cash price amount, excellent. I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
we go all right now.

Matthias Miller  1:04:46
Becomes a fun thing. I.

Matthias Miller  1:05:33
First problem, it which what is the first problem separating out between the cash price and the full rent price on each payment. One

Speaker 1  1:06:07
but you should have that based on the on the contract definition that you've assigned to the contract record,

Matthias Miller  1:06:15
yeah, as long as he thinks of it same. I mean, as long as it would be, well, he

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
doesn't even think of it in that manner,

Matthias Miller  1:06:24
rent date or due date amount, and we Need a period date in there.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
That's The due date.

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
This guy is next to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
this be a.

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
Image waiver other which we have no idea what that is, late fees. We just treat that as a late fee all the time. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:12:43
all right, so then we need to,

Speaker 1  1:12:47
I really should find one, where the, where the they move the due date, because the due date actually logs, change logs in the history table, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
but that's for that When we will

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00
cross that bridge when we get there?

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
Well, I wonder if do you have one? I You

Matthias Miller  1:14:32
what happens when you switch from cash to accrual and vice versa? Do you do

Matthias Miller  1:14:43
if you have a bunch of payments that you paid sales tax on, and you switch to a cash basis, do you get temporarily, get that money back until the person pays? I mean, it would never really be in that direction. But,

Speaker 1  1:14:59
and. It, you get to set it once, and you can only set it there's only, there's only two times you can ever set it once, at the very, very beginning, and once a year, on January the first, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:15:14
know then well, then

Matthias Miller  1:15:17
we just said that problem in January the first. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:15:26
everybody has to be current, December 31 or if not, we take your building. That's right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:15:54
uh, you think I would be able to find one, but now

Unknown Speaker  1:16:00
that would be too easy, that would be too easy.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:07
Too easy. You

Speaker 4  1:16:31
Hmm, well, that one's going to be fun to sort out one day. For some reason, I just randomly pulled up a customer who was being charged $13.16 of sales tax,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:51
and then one day it quit charging sales tax. How's that even possible?

Matthias Miller  1:16:57
I'm very confused. Maybe, maybe he was just loading submitting its tax exempt

Speaker 4  1:17:01
status, I'd be very curious as to what that's going to turn up as but

Unknown Speaker  1:17:11
Well, so far, I haven't found a due date change randomly charging through here looking for one.

Matthias Miller  1:17:24
Yeah, so what you're basically looking for?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27
I thought it did anyway, what

Matthias Miller  1:17:36
does it look like?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:37
That's what I'm wanting to know.

Matthias Miller  1:17:46
It's not like a zero payment row with a

Matthias Miller  1:18:12
that's canceled now that's a

Speaker 4  1:18:55
oh, well, I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Because I'm not. I was I thought maybe I'd find one, real easy, but I'm not.

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
Shouldn't we import receipts first? I mean, I think this is more me a question than your question, but

Unknown Speaker  1:19:14
receipt being the the payment record ID,

Matthias Miller  1:19:18
yeah, so we have a payment record to tie it to,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:21
probably a good idea. And

Matthias Miller  1:19:33
would you get that from the history row, or would you get that from a don't think

Unknown Speaker  1:19:39
there is any other place that you would get that from. I that

Unknown Speaker  1:19:59
from eight.

Matthias Miller  1:20:34
Right? Well, let's do that then. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
know that was kind of dumb. I don't really want all that. I

Matthias Miller  1:21:21
Yes, I do so You have the

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
receipt number.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:02
Steve Think we're going to do a

Matthias Miller  1:23:34
Okay, well, I suggest that we pause migration until I'm going to be a linking field from payments over to these records, receipt numbers. So I vote we just do. You know the difference between the B and the O prefix, the B and the what the B and the P prefix? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:07
click on one of the B's.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
Bring in, bring in the bring in the dollar value.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:43
You exclude everything here.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:54
I wish I did.

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
I. Are two different well, maybe they're just two different things. They're different people. They must just I don't know what the I

Unknown Speaker  1:25:19
don't know. Let me let me see if they

Speaker 4  1:25:57
Let's see receipts, receipts, receipts, receipts. See you.

Speaker 4  1:27:11
E, the letter prefixes or receipt numbers, encodes the store number, the number for stores over 99 A O equals 181 equals 101 No. How

Unknown Speaker  1:27:39
many different types do you see there's D?

Matthias Miller  1:27:46
Let's do let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:10
Oh, 4050,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16
is it an S? Did I see an S?

Matthias Miller  1:28:19
Yeah, I'm getting there's an X. I think I'm getting you a full list. And whenever this guy runs, Oh, gotcha 100

Unknown Speaker  1:28:28
how many rows this guy have?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:42
Well, okay, here. Do this,

Matthias Miller  1:28:58
B, C, D, N, P, R, S, V, X,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:48
if we can't What?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:51
No, that's bull.

Speaker 1  1:30:11
Hmm. I mean, if we if we need to nail it down, I'd have to contact RTO Pro and ask them. I

Matthias Miller  1:30:20
don't know that we do. I mean, let's dig into it and find out. We got to wait till we get linking fields before we can really do anything meaningful. So I suggest

Unknown Speaker  1:30:30
we just hang tight. Yeah, do

Unknown Speaker  1:30:39
we have anything more booked this week.

Matthias Miller  1:30:42
We don't but we could potentially Friday's pretty open. We have

Speaker 3  1:30:45
tomorrow, so we do have tomorrow. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:30:54
Good, good. Thank you, sir. Thank you.
