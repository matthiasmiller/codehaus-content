Unknown Speaker  12:48
Matt morning,

Unknown Speaker  12:51
Hey, morning, how are you alright?

Speaker 1  12:52
Good buddy. How are you good awesome. Hey, quick question, do you did you get the check yet?

Matthias Miller  13:01
Let me see when Rhonda swung by. I

Matthias Miller  13:50
I'll let me see. When Rhonda last went, she's gonna swing by a couple days this week, see if it's if it's in but

Speaker 1  13:59
okay, um on the housekeeping side, Rick is going to get that labor, annual sawing labor, annual assembly labor. Yeah, sounded like he had to go through a bunch of payroll, payroll stubs. I said, Don't you have any spreadsheets or whatever? Yeah. So he thought, yeah, he might have some other options. I don't know. Anyway, okay, on the machine, costs for sawing, machine for assembly, a little bit during headlights. I I said, anything you can get for me is great. Um, I, anyway, I had some homework I gotta. I'm gonna have to, must have to do some digging and roll up my sleeves a little bit on that. Okay.

Speaker 1  15:07
Lumber prices. I didn't get to that at this point. Does that matter

Unknown Speaker  15:12
right now? Probably, probably not at the moment, no,

Speaker 1  15:17
and you said, is that you said, can't, can't prices wasn't applicable just yet, which is fine,

Matthias Miller  15:28
yeah, I mean, we'll need, we'll need that at some point, but

Unknown Speaker  15:33
I know, but you were saying I couldn't.

Speaker 2  15:35
Is that right? Yeah, I'm sorry you, you can today. Oh, okay,

Speaker 1  15:39
good deal, hey. Well, then should we talk through that plywood scenario real quick? That's kind of fresh on my mind yet.

Unknown Speaker  15:45
Yeah, we can, um,

Speaker 1  15:49
what makes, I don't know what makes sense for your system there. Um, I'm just trying to. I I guess what. I guess what we, oh, man, I don't know. Bro boy. Like, it boils down to how many pieces can we get out of a full sheet, you know, right? Like, I think that's you kind of said something like that. You said, if it takes two sheets to make the item, then that's, know, that it takes two sheets for the item.

Matthias Miller  16:32
Somehow, yeah, the problem, the fundamental problem, is that generating optimal cuts for two dimensional lumber is substantially different than single dimensional lumber, like we do for you know how many acquired so. So the simple option is to say, if you have plywood that you you have to define on the you have to add it as raw material to the to the job, and you just make sure that the square footage, you don't use more square footage. I mean, this is just a sanity check, really. It's not guaranteed to be accurate, but make sure you don't use more square footage than then, then what you're you assigned to the job, to the to the item.

Speaker 1  17:21
Okay, so we're talking item data and item data entry that that, that where we would manually say, this, I this item shouldn't take more than it should take four pieces or less. Yada, yada, yada,

Matthias Miller  17:40
yes. And so we're going to build four pieces.

Speaker 1  17:43
And so I don't mind that that's actually like, that's all one time through and we're done. And when we do new entry, yeah, I mean, it's another thing you have to bake into item data, right?

Matthias Miller  17:57
Yeah, it's not that difficult. I mean, currently, no, it's not, but it's not terrible, all right, I changed the fasteners grouping at the bottom from fasteners to raw materials so that we could put heat treating down there. And so we'll just put this down in the raw materials as well.

Speaker 1  18:16
Is that your raw materials in the item data, oh, item data, Oh, where am I at? Here, me give us some wood fresh so you're saying word you said down to just

Matthias Miller  18:34
keep going. Down, down, down, down. Heat treating is now down here.

Unknown Speaker  18:39
Okay? And

Matthias Miller  18:44
and then we'll put plywood down here as well. Okay, and just make sure it ties out.

Speaker 1  18:49
And then, and this is where we would enter the pieces for the item, or whatever type of thing. Yeah. Okay, so would you then say that. Mean, do you care if we say half a sheet point five or something like that?

Matthias Miller  19:09
No, that's fine. Okay, you would just sing a single decimal point.

Speaker 1  19:18
Yeah, round to sing if I mean, can you round to single? Okay, quantity? I think, yeah. I think that's more, I mean, yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:35
So then on, on the plywood, we'd use price, price per each, each sheet,

Speaker 1  19:45
yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly. So each, each of the three species for and the sizes allotted to that which I have, let me go back here to raw materials, half inch BC, half inch. Yeah. Each. One of these will have its own price. Yep. Same with the lumber, uh, sorry, same with the SPF, yp and plywood. I don't my nitpick break or whatever, OC, whatever, whatever can the CANS cutbacks in random all be.

Matthias Miller  20:21
Can you refresh? Yep, I don't know if you like these groupings. It's not perfectly grouped together, but I have panels. Yep, I got dimensional lumber panels and rough cut lumber. Is that a rough cut? Yeah? Rough cut lumber, yeah. Does that make sense to you?

Speaker 1  20:40
Rough Cut, yep. Would you say dimensional?

Matthias Miller  20:44
Yeah, up at the top for the two base.

Unknown Speaker  20:48
Oh, that's up here. Yeah, that's fine, yeah, that's fine. Can that? Can that is

Speaker 1  20:56
this alphabetical? Okay, it's alphabetical. That's it. Is alphabetical. No problem. No. I like it. I like it. Rough Cut. Cans cut back. Are you? Yeah, each line item is allowed that like, we have to sign each line item, right,

Matthias Miller  21:13
correct, perfect. Okay, so plywood, you can't assign an individual price yet, but we'll

Speaker 1  21:20
that's fine, yep, all right, like it looks great. All right, so let me note that item data, so we have to

Unknown Speaker  21:38
vote. Let me see here, do I have?

Matthias Miller  21:47
And then this the special order number. I didn't know what kind of what that stuff is, yeah, would that also be sorry?

Unknown Speaker  22:01
I'm let me get back. I'm sorry. Let me put this.

Speaker 1  22:12
Yeah, I asked you a couple questions on this other here at some point, good, right now, try to organize my notes. Tiny bit good.

Speaker 1  22:33
Your question was, Matt, special order, yeah, what was that

Matthias Miller  22:39
we need to clean up the special order. Stuff has to be broken apart into each specific one item per special order.

Speaker 1  22:48
Okay, piece, yeah, can I add a raw material there? Yeah, click on hit

Matthias Miller  23:00
new raw material up top.

Unknown Speaker  23:02
Got it

Speaker 2  23:06
put in the name and tight special order. Yeah, it's special order.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
And then, yeah, gotcha actually, hang on. I need to be.

Unknown Speaker  23:18
I'm not making enough of notes here. Here we go. I got it. We need to go through and assign pieces. Of plywood to each item.

Matthias Miller  23:50
I will put that the plywood stuff I can put on George's item cleanup list.

Speaker 1  23:57
And that's, that's fine, um, yeah, cuz he I'll either have him do it or Alan, but that they can both find it. So yeah, that's good.

Speaker 2  24:06
Find it there. Okay, yeah, it's good. All right.

Speaker 1  24:09
That works each item as needed. George and Alan, I need to fill these guys in. Do you want it? Just, do you want to give me a heads up when that step is ready? Yeah, we'll have to go through items. All right.

Speaker 1  24:41
Perfect. I'm as needed. That's one decimal point. I'm just thinking, should we go to decimal point? I may use a quarter piece.

Matthias Miller  24:56
If you use a quarter piece, we can that's not a problem. Two.

Speaker 1  25:00
Okay, two decimal points. Okay, two decimal points. Got it. Okay, there's that note. And the other thing we just said was, yeah, anyway,

Matthias Miller  25:16
special order, yeah,

Speaker 1  25:22
it's add all special order lumber to special order lumber sizes to raw material and window.

Unknown Speaker  25:50
That, okay, yep, yep,

Unknown Speaker  26:13
and then what we say, assign,

Unknown Speaker  26:22
piece. Pieces.

Unknown Speaker  26:36
Each item got it all right, so we're,

Speaker 1  26:49
yeah, Matt, I'm caught up. Sorry, yep, have to do that. Yep. All

Unknown Speaker  27:01
right, what's our next?

Matthias Miller  27:18
Were you wanting to charge you'd mentioned at one point about charging more for notching on the Keystone.

Speaker 1  27:29
What charging was it? Or can you elaborate on more,

Matthias Miller  27:36
like a per board foot additional cost for notching?

Speaker 1  27:40
Well, I think we basically said that was a second pass, right. In other words, we're sorry,

Matthias Miller  27:50
got it handling it, because it is a second pass, right? Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  28:01
Good. Okay, yep,

Matthias Miller  28:14
I did have some question on the what exactly you want to flag on the two by four side, because there, yeah, because, because there are some that can legitimately be cut from some dimensions that can be cut, either from a two by or from a can't. And so I am showing warnings. I'm showing it up in the showing warnings and showing it in the cleanup if, let me see

Matthias Miller  28:56
if it is the actual size of a two, if It's the actual size Engine app by three and a half of a two by, but it's not pulled out of that. Or if it's coming from a two by, but it's not so, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 1  29:20
Super, super rare that there's an item with inch and a half by three and a half, if it's not a two by four. I know of one,

Unknown Speaker  29:32
the New Holland 4840s have an inch and a half by three and a half oak.

Speaker 1  29:40
Um, I that there could be another, there could be a New Holland or something yet, but there's partly, like man, less than five items in the whole probably in the whole works, that have an actual inch and a half by three and a half specific, but it's not a two by four.

Matthias Miller  29:59
I. So, but we'll want some kind of way to turn off the warning for those guys.

Speaker 1  30:09
When you say warning, what's what? What's the, what's telling it? Why is it a warning?

Matthias Miller  30:15
Well, we need some kind of way to Okay, if that's if 99% of the time. I guess the question is, do you want to do a one time cleanup, or do you want to warn in the future somebody, somebody set something up to cut it out of if?

Speaker 1  30:31
I mean, if, if the item data shows oak or poplar or another lumber species besides SPF or what like if it doesn't include s, I don't know if you can go line item. Line item does not include SPF or yp, then it's probably not a two by four, right? Yep. I don't know if that's enough to solve.

Speaker 1  31:13
Yep, should be okay. And then if you want to, if you want to, if you want to, hit those with a warning, so that we would, I mean, I don't know how we confirm that, or if you need confirmation, but I could look at it. I'm happy to do that myself. I mean, yeah, that's minimal. If we need to look at it and confirm it somewhere, somehow. I don't know how you mature. How do you how do we want to just

Matthias Miller  31:49
so we do have some Do you want to pull up item cleanup?

Unknown Speaker  31:54
Yep, sure. Let's go. I

Matthias Miller  32:03
And then sort by message, so they're all grouped together. Okay, you can do it before it finishes, if you want to.

Unknown Speaker  32:15
Oh, can I do it before it's done? Yeah, gotcha.

Matthias Miller  32:22
So let's go down to

Speaker 1  32:33
Okay, so there's a bunch of these, which he's he's working through. I um,

Matthias Miller  32:43
okay, that here we got a bunch of pieces that where things are. This says it's the size of a two by four, but it's not the raw material is can't. Here we have some where the raw material is a two by four, but it can't, but we don't have anything to cut.

Speaker 1  33:06
You're saying the raw material says two by four, but

Matthias Miller  33:15
yeah, and I think most of these are just, they're using exterior dimensions. And so if that's what it is, you could have Alan clean those up if you want him to,

Speaker 1  33:30
oh, like the two by four. Is that the problem here? Because it's never been corrected to correct. Okay, yeah, we can, yeah, okay, so sorry, this is redundant, but again, the items that say that have this message means, that means, means that we're trying to cut something other than these dimensions out of it.

Matthias Miller  34:05
We're trying to cut something other than No, not quite. The error message could be clearer. It means that we're, I mean, there's no nothing on the we shouldn't be looking all those at all those sizes. But it means that we can't cut from is it even showing all those sizes? I don't even know. But it means that we don't have the can't size definition. Doesn't it's not in that can't size definition, and almost all of them are outside dimensions. Like the first thing to do would be to clean up all the, not the outside dimensions, but all the clean up, the two by four dimensions to the actual dimensions, right?

Speaker 1  34:49
That's probably the majority. Yeah, okay, so and

Matthias Miller  34:54
then there might be some more down if you keep going down. Oh no, that here, if you go up. Oh, some of these, some of these, the pieces of the size of a two by four. Do you want to grab one of those? But it's coming out of a can?

Speaker 1  35:06
Yeah, yep, yep, yep. I so there you go. That's exactly.

Unknown Speaker  35:11
There's an inch a half by three and a half

Unknown Speaker  35:13
Yup, and it's coming out of cans.

Unknown Speaker  35:16
And that's oak.

Speaker 1  35:21
I have to Yep, and I have to look at the print. Why in the smack, we're doing that not inch and seven, I don't know, but we are so 1316, by five and a half. It's a 60, but I got that. That's fine. 60 by 60. Jeez Louise, why didn't nobody ever make this inch and seven? I have no idea. We do not cut inch and a half without doing something weird offside. I don't know, but I guess they figured it out. Two Inch and a halfs and 213, 16th maybe, blah, blah, blah. So in other words, Matt, how do you want to resolve this? This one, if the lumber is actually one and a half by three and a half?

Matthias Miller  36:12
Well, what we can do is is only show this warning if it's flagged as I mean, I think basically what we do is anytime. The simple way to go about it is, say, if it's, if it's yp or SPF in the in the description, then require, like, right? Make sure that it's dimensional lumber, lumber. If that's, it's a two by if it's, if that's in there, and if not, then it's not like, just make sure they match, right?

Speaker 1  36:42
So if the raw material was can't, then just roll with it. I mean, I could check the I mean, well, should I go through these first? If I confirm

Matthias Miller  36:55
No, I think, I think what I would well, you can if you want to. But my vote is that if you select a two by then, you need to put wipe your SPF into the into the raw material, and otherwise, like, make sure that the raw material line actually matches up with the with the selected raw material. Yeah. And in this case, these would go away because they do match that there is, yeah, yep.

Speaker 1  37:23
I don't mind if you make these go away, yep. Is that? What is that? What you figure

Matthias Miller  37:29
that's the short answer. That's the short answer, Yes, yep.

Speaker 1  37:34
That's just make those go yeah, if you can make those go away, then I'm good with that. Okay, all right, so then the one Where it says raw material is a

Unknown Speaker  38:04
SP Is SPF or yp, but dimensions or different,

Unknown Speaker  38:29
mostly currently two by four. Okay, take care of that. Give me your Allen.

Speaker 1  38:43
It's a job he can do. I'm glad I hired that guy. I'm glad the Lord brought that guy over here. Yeah, man, that's exactly right. I just had another guy call me. He's been calling this week, 51 years old, which I'm actually good Amish guy's been working in a swing company for 10 years. He said, This feels like a factory. I said. I said, you know, making pallets isn't pallets aren't nearly as pretty to look at and all that as swings. He said, Yeah. Then he said, but might not be as particular either. So it sounds like he's a little, he's, yeah, he's a little burned on the process, whatever he's been doing, and this, I don't know what else I'll I'm gonna interview

Unknown Speaker  39:32
the guy. So, yeah.

Speaker 1  39:35
So, um, yeah, trying to build team, buddy. I'm, I'm actually working on the bench a little bit. I never really done that much before, but it's fun, fun. I'm there. That's awesome next Matt.

Matthias Miller  39:52
I think that's I think it's it for me. I didn't have a chance to dig too. Deep into the where we at. I mean, I need to revamp some dig deeper into some of the pricing off of the conversation from yesterday. Like Sure.

Unknown Speaker  40:34
We need to do a

Matthias Miller  40:42
by random. Get sizes by 47, eight by 40. Why is that one not big?

Matthias Miller  41:16
That's why it's 20% curve.

Matthias Miller  41:28
Four of them, 16 to $20 per unit. Achieve the lumber price, selling board feet, sewing price. I think that actually does that. That one cutbacks.

Matthias Miller  42:00
I'm going to guess this one's item clean up. Let's see if this one, this one should be I

Matthias Miller  42:24
it's not.

Matthias Miller  42:40
Should cut backs. Cutback should specify a can't size.

Unknown Speaker  43:01
Someone use um, how

Matthias Miller  43:03
are we cutbacks price? Let's start with that.

Speaker 1  43:10
Well, so like it should be based on the pricing of that of that size. Like it still has to be size specific, right? I guess that, like, the specific size would be the yield. I think we talked about that a little bit. But like, can you extrapolate that dimension from the yield

Matthias Miller  43:44
you would use, in other

Speaker 1  43:47
words, right? Like when we say, when we say the raw materials cutbacks, we're saying the price is the same as cans. In other words, it's a price per board foot, same as the cans. And so extrapolate the board footage from the board footage with curve based on the yield dimensions, and then that's the cost.

Matthias Miller  44:20
So you would just find, find the, find the would you find the can't with the well, do you want to specify that can't in the item data? Or do you want me to find the most efficient can't, to cut it out from and use that

Speaker 1  44:32
Well, I hear you there. No, I know, I don't, but I just, I just want you to, I want you to charge for the specific size with the with the default curve amount, if you know what I mean,

Matthias Miller  44:59
like what a. Is, what is the default

Speaker 1  45:04
curve amount? Hang on. Sorry, yeah, did we? Did we not? Did we, as I don't remember. How did we assign a decimal point you are? You're doing that in the system. Where's that? It's all, sorry, what's that window?

Matthias Miller  45:22
Matt, current. Currently, it's all based off Configure. Can't sizes, but that's what we're using to figure out the curve percentage I understand.

Speaker 1  45:32
Let me look here. Yeah, curve is that? I

Unknown Speaker  45:50
I like it's always

Speaker 1  46:04
the I'm trying to wrap my brain around this, the curve percentage like, um, how we do this? I guess I, I'd, I'd rather like bake, bake the curve into the dimension, like, as much as possible. In other words, if this is the dimension, then this is the curve for pricing. Like, I don't really want to make the curve an optional number, but I guess there's if you if what's that I'm, um, in other words, like, if, if there's, if the lumber dimensions are repeated here in the different can't dimensions. So, in other words, seven, six, but 716, by three and a half. Top there. If you take it out of random, random one inch, your curve is 15 and seven, 8% if you take it out of an inch now by three and a half, it's 12% if you take it out of three and a half by 620, 7% sorry, hail. Bless you. Thank you. I was at the coffee shop again this morning, getting that floor back in again, insulating and stuff. I don't another I don't want to make this an optional number. Like, I want to say, like, if it's can't, or if I don't know why that's in the random like, I like I well, I No, I do,

Speaker 1  48:31
but that's camp price I get. So in other words, Matt, let's take the curve percentage from the can't, let's go with the can't curve percentage and and stick with that versus random. Does that make sense?

Matthias Miller  48:57
Course, for what?

Speaker 1  49:00
Well, I'm saying like if, if, if the same dimension comes out of either can't or random, then lean towards the can't curve percentage. In other words, if I take it out and there's less curve, that's my savings. I'd rather pass the wait. So then,

Matthias Miller  49:31
why are we using?

Unknown Speaker  49:41
Okay, well, catching up slowly. So then there's a Have you good?

Speaker 1  49:49
Would you Okay? Was your question? Why are we using cans? No.

Matthias Miller  49:56
Okay, so cutbacks, you went okay. But then for cutbacks. Do you have, do you want them to specify what like, what do you want to use for pricing on cutbacks?

Speaker 1  50:09
So the whole, the whole the whole curve percentage really is kind of a mute number, like, we don't really need that number for pricing. It's probably good to have it here, because it might be something that will help us internally. But when it comes to pricing, for all intents and purposes, when we're taking 716, out of cants, random or cutbacks, that 7/16 equals point six, because I can get, I can get six, 716 Out of a six inch can so my curve is points. Sorry, I can get 10 out of a six inch. I'm sorry I was typo. But in other words, the price of the 7/16 by three and a half is not point 4375, it's point six times 3.5. Is the dimension that we're charging for this. Did I specs? Do you reverse? Did I send over that cheat sheet that we have for dimensions?

Matthias Miller  51:41
I think you might have sent it by text, but I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  51:46
Did I do that on text?

Matthias Miller  51:48
Or there was an email, a PDF, that you send over as well, which didn't make a ton of sense, but,

Speaker 1  51:53
yeah, there was, I think I emailed that one over. It has something about pricing. It's just got, it's a white paper with put your numbers on it,

Matthias Miller  52:09
emailing cans can't PDF, okay, so you have the can't sizes here. So are, are these the cant sizes you want to use for pricing? Then, no. I'm very confused because we went specifically down the curve percentage rabbit trail. So you're gonna have to catch me up to the line of thinking here. All right, where's it was on January six? Email, can't, yep,

Unknown Speaker  52:52
oh no, not that. Here, let me get out of there,

Speaker 1  53:00
didn't I send over that one that we use for pricing for

Unknown Speaker  53:09
I don't know what that I miss.

Speaker 1  53:13
You forgot it daily update, many lumber and species up to shoot.

Unknown Speaker  53:25
Maybe I didn't, Matt, I'm sorry if I didn't. Doesn't look like I took a picture either. I thought I sent I'm not trying to get on bunny, Troy, I'm gonna try to come back here, where wherever I'm at, but

Speaker 1  53:48
yeah, well, without going, without going back and trying to, I don't exactly remember the context of our conversation around curve earlier, but I know that. Where am I at here?

Matthias Miller  54:09
I mean, let's we, can we just start with how it should be priced?

Speaker 1  54:14
Yeah, the main thing is that we we charge for the curve that's the most.

Matthias Miller  54:19
Like, Well, I understand that. But then so for can't, you're looking at what is it getting cut out of? What's the curve? Any charge for the for the total footage, so, so if the raw materials can't, that makes sense, right? So far, so good, right? Okay, if it's, if it's cut back, how do you calculate pricing on cutbacks,

Unknown Speaker  54:41
same as can't.

Matthias Miller  54:44
And so George needs to go in on cutbacks and say, This is the can't size for this cutback.

Unknown Speaker  54:58
That's where I was. That's where. I was trying to

Matthias Miller  55:04
or do we just find the most efficient? So that's where, no, that's

Speaker 1  55:09
what I was. Can't you that you go by the yield, go by the yield dimensions in that, in that line item, and charge it the same as you would if it was coming out of can't and

Matthias Miller  55:23
just find the most efficient can't.

Speaker 1  55:27
Like, I mean, i i No three like, I want to default to three and a half by six or three and a half by eight or five and a half by six,

Matthias Miller  55:43
three and a half by six. Sorry, which one? Three and a half by six? Or what? Or three and a half by eight? Three and a half by eight

Speaker 1  55:51
or five and a half by six.

Matthias Miller  55:55
Okay, so why wouldn't I do a one time cleanup that picks the most efficient of those three, and if there's anything else missing, put it on the cleanup list to clean up. Okay, what do you think of that? Yay or Nay?

Speaker 1  56:07
I think so. So in other words, you're going to mirror those dimensions with the curve as the cost. What if those dimensions are repeated in that's my only question. Well, like for example, well if Sorry, I'll put

Matthias Miller  56:35
the can't size in there. The cutback is going to specify the can't size. So if it's repeated in multiple places, well, I guess that's I'm saying, that's a question on the one time cleanup. Do you want, if it's in multiple places, do you want me to leave it blank and you come back to it? Or do you want me to pick one?

Speaker 1  56:50
Well, I think we should pick one. Like, basically now, like, let's pick, let's go over the lumber dimensions and pick one of those three categories. If it's multiple, like some of these are repeated, some more.

Matthias Miller  57:05
Okay, give me, give me one minute. Let me, let me put together a little report, and we can see what actually we need to take a look at.

Speaker 1  57:11
I think, let me we're on the same page, right, Matt,

Matthias Miller  57:15
I think, I think we're getting there very quickly. I appreciate it. Lumber, quantity. Okay, so we do and the item number raw material equals, cut back. And then we need item lumber dimensions. And I want the, actually, I want to group these By left of last.

Unknown Speaker  57:49
And then let's do this. Okay? Cat can't size. We have the

Unknown Speaker  58:15
six by eight by six.

Unknown Speaker  58:35
Yeah, you call. I don't know I'm at work. I don't know there's, I mean, I have his number if you want to call him.

Speaker 1  59:00
Yeah, I mean, I don't think Anne's the person you want to have the oversight of the day. I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't rely on her to make decisions. Yeah, good deal. Okay, me up.

Speaker 1  59:25
Know they have to be there tomorrow, yet for at least part of the day. Okay,

Speaker 1  59:41
he's here, he's at the shop, he's at work, uh, he'll, he'll text, he'll text you his hours and, oh, he's here till 430 Well, I don't know, usually till 430 All right? I don't know. I don't know right now. Okay, see ya,

Matthias Miller  1:00:05
alright, so we don't, yeah, no worries. We don't have, we don't have any with multiple, but we do have some that are missing.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
And when you say I'm missing, I'm I'm

Matthias Miller  1:00:18
like, inch and a half or one in one, in 116, by three and 13 sixteenths.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:26
Okay. How do we?

Matthias Miller  1:00:30
Well, we it's because it's coming. I'm assuming this is the size that only comes at

Speaker 1  1:00:34
a cutback. That's a four by six. That's a four by six. So now we sorry, we better stick with the throw the four by sixes in there too. Sorry, I missed. I didn't

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
make sense. Makes sense,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:51
and the four by eight and the four k4, by four by six, three and a half by eight, three and a half by six.

Matthias Miller  1:01:00
Sorry, you said four by six and four by eight, right? Right?

Speaker 1  1:01:03
I mean, good grief, it's like, yeah, four by six, four by eight. There's also, there's also three by eight. And, I mean, wait, these also three by six. There's also two nap by Yeah, it's good grief, it's, it's everything, but, well,

Matthias Miller  1:01:33
but there are some that are literally missing from anything, anywhere. That's fine,

Speaker 1  1:01:37
that, but, but as far as that man, as far as this, this whole spiel here that we're talking about it is, it's everything but the inch and a half by three and a half.

Speaker 1  1:02:00
Well, that's the same thing. It's just a different species, like, as far as can sizes, like, we have the SPF and Yp dimensions in here. But I'm wondering if they shouldn't be separate, because it's a whole different price point, and this doesn't Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:02:27
I wonder if we should do a, could we do it by group? Not quite, yeah, like a, just, well, what we really need is assign it to cancel, so you have random, you'd have ran a random group. You'd have a cutback and can't group, and you'd have a dimensional lumber group.

Speaker 1  1:02:49
Well, I like to, I like to throw that random group in with the cutbacks, and can't, if you don't mind, and then, and then, right? I need to look at that, because some of the dimensions that we take out of random are just, they're not going to show up in the other camp sizes, right? There's so then that needs to be the curve, if you will.

Matthias Miller  1:03:25
So why not on random? Why would we just require you to specify can't sizes on random as well?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:33
Well, we actually are

Unknown Speaker  1:03:40
well for pre

Unknown Speaker  1:03:43
How do you wait? So no, but

Speaker 2  1:03:46
no, you don't. Yeah, you can't. Not like that. You can. You can

Speaker 1  1:03:52
go with the curve as it's been, as it's been, as we've broken it down, right? We say, here's the curve percentage, whatever. I guess I'm saying, the curve percentage gets baked into the price, right? Is that how you're doing it? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:04:15
I mean, you calculate when you're calculating the board footage for pricing, you add the curve in

Speaker 1  1:04:23
exactly and so right? Just keep everything as it is. The pricing issue is going to be when, like, if you lump random and cutbacks and cans together, what's the curve? Well, the curve is whatever's been assigned unless it's been assigned a couple different times, like if it's unless it unless those dimensions show up more than once, where in that case, I'd like to look at those specifically and make. Decision on what that should be.

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
Does that make sense? So for cutbacks, there are still no duplicates those. Those are I just sent you the cutbacks, the dimensions that are used by cutbacks, but not on any cans the in my mind, but I'm not seeing any. Well, actually, Hang on. Let me just that's not true.

Speaker 1  1:05:32
Email, so if How do you send it?

Matthias Miller  1:05:36
Text message, hang on, let me. Let me go back to you. So there are ones that are of that list that you sent. Yeah, there are ones that can come out of multiple, like inch and a half. Yeah, there's some that can, okay. The let me see if I can get this. The inch and five six scenes by three and a half can come out of the inch and a half by three and a half or the three and a half by right.

Speaker 1  1:06:07
Six, right? So let's decide which, which, because they're different curve percentages. Let's pick one and stick with that.

Matthias Miller  1:06:18
No, no, they're not. Well, I'm looking at the ones that can have the same curve percentage. But I guess we don't just want that. We want we want to take a look at all of them. Hang on.

Speaker 1  1:06:33
Well, in other words, each lumber dimension, let's set a curve percentage for each lumbar dimension.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
Like, okay, so if you

Speaker 1  1:06:50
other other than SPF and Yp, like, Let's separate that. But if it's cancer, random or cutbacks, let's say each dimension. Let's set that curve percentage so that it's a one number,

Matthias Miller  1:07:09
no matter what you're going to get out

Speaker 1  1:07:11
of right exactly, whether either, no matter if it's random or cans, or if it's random or cans or cutbacks, the curve dimension will, you know, always be, that's the dimension. So, like, if you're cutting substances by three and a half out of random or out of cans or out of cutbacks, the curve percentage is always going to be boom, and then that's what it is, regardless of what this chart says, because this chart is giving us different numbers right now, just because we've taken it out of different things, Right? But for pricing sake. I'd like to assign one curve percentage to each dimension and then stick with and then stick with it so that you can I don't want to fluctuate the curve. I just want to set it and go,

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
Okay, what's what's the rational? What's the rationale for it? Just out of

Speaker 1  1:08:33
curiosity, your rationale for setting it as more one

Matthias Miller  1:08:42
time, setting it the same, setting it the same across no matter where it comes out of,

Speaker 1  1:08:52
I guess to I'm thinking, eliminate like so that it just to simplify it for one reason. Yep, it feels messy to me to always to it feels messy to me if i Okay, if we allow the item to be made out of a couple different can sizes, and we price it on the cheapest can size, which is probably the one that Has the the best curve percentage, but usually the highest price is can't. And can't is our default, like cancer is our default. Like, in other words, if you can't, if I don't have the random for it, I know I can get it out of cans. If I don't have the, you know, whatever, for it, I can always get it out of cans. I don't have cut backs, I can get it out of cans. So. So I always want to defer to the curve that we end up with when we take it out of cans.

Matthias Miller  1:10:14
So could we, could we just say, Are there any duplicate sizes besides the one that Well, are there any duplicate sizes within that? Can't list that you sent sent over.

Speaker 1  1:10:34
Oh, i Are you saying duplicate lumber dimensions, right what if I click on here, right now, here we go. Shoot.

Matthias Miller  1:10:47
It's not going to take that away. Let me, let me, let me, let me. Let me, let me.

Speaker 1  1:10:54
Can Can we take the inch and a half by three and a half inch up by five and a half inch by seven and a half into a diff, like different category

Matthias Miller  1:11:03
here, here. Let me do. Let me do this. Okay, so we've got these, let's do, if we, if we look at all the Hang on, where we at, by the way, I got time. But if you need to drop, let me know. Let me know.

Speaker 1  1:11:23
I sounds good. I am okay, right now.

Matthias Miller  1:11:26
I yeah, if we would, if we would filter down that this list can't sizes, can't. If that list, list you gave me, and then we would stop grouping by the can't dimensions. And then we would sort by lumber dimensions.

Speaker 1  1:11:55
Well, again, this list right here, I like to eliminate the SPF and Yp ones right? And then I'd like to look at which lumber dimensions are repeated and the ones that are repeated. Let's compare and go with go with the right. Go with one of them.

Matthias Miller  1:12:22
Okay, so let's do

Speaker 1  1:12:24
we're just going to price it. We're always going to assume that we're just going to price it that way. We're not going to try to always cut

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
it that way. But, yeah, I get it always

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
going to price it the same way.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:48
Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:13:05
Okay, if you go to the go to bold, go to the sidebar, go to User folders, home, or here I can get rid of random as well in this list, right? You say folders, yeah, hit folders, yep. And then the one at the top,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:39
archive files,

Matthias Miller  1:13:41
I'm sorry. The second 120, 2020, sorry, the 2026, one. I mean, can't, can't size this for pricing, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:52
So do you have repeat? Are they all? They're all, yeah, okay, there's

Matthias Miller  1:13:57
a 916, by three and a half. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:14:01
I'm surprised the seven succeed by three and a half didn't come up twice. Didn't that come up in the three and a half by eight? I guess not. That's interesting, which is, that's good. It's good on George, that's good. Okay, sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:14:15
we have a we have a literal duplicate here. We have one that has, what is this 13? Yeah, 13 sixteenths by five and a half. It's it's twice in the same

Speaker 1  1:14:27
I don't know where. I don't know where we're getting this 9/16 by three and a half, out of a three and a half, a three and a half, because we don't buy three and a half, a three and a half, unless it

Matthias Miller  1:14:44
let's go to that's weird. Items, three and a half by three and a half. Aim, 21 aim, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57
Where am I at here? Why can't I.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
Good grief, what are we doing? Man,

Speaker 1  1:15:28
three and a half by three and a half oak, that's just, oh, where's mine?

Speaker 1  1:15:54
George, hey, aim 21 item. It's using three and a half by three and a half inch cans to cut 9/16 I didn't know we were buying. Do we buy three and a half by three and a half? Can't. How'd that get in there? Do you know? Um, aim, 21 A, M, E, dash, 21 maybe it's a typo. That's got

Speaker 1  1:16:32
to be a typo. It's probably supposed to be three and A half by six, I'm guessing.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:42
Yeah, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:00
uh, okay, um, now you're editing, can you you're out, so I just changed the can size.

Speaker 1  1:17:17
Where am I at? How do I do this? Right? Oh, here we go. I'm three and a half by six, bam. Save it. Refresh it. Is that the only one?

Matthias Miller  1:17:32
Matt, yeah, that's the only one. That's the only one. We also, we also have a, I don't know if you want to look at this one. We have a one in 716, by five and a half coming out of it? Five and a half by six?

Speaker 1  1:17:45
Yeah, that's probably good. Do we ever get a Yeah? You get an inch and seven by five and a half. George.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
Because you don't have five on that. But eights.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
Do you get four out of a six inch? I'm guessing, not,

Speaker 1  1:18:25
right? I'm not sure that says four, for some reason. I don't know why it does. Let me see here, five and a half by six. Can't dimensions.

Speaker 1  1:18:40
What's that? Right? If we do an inch and seven by three by five and a half, it should be three, not four.

Matthias Miller  1:18:52
Update, that, do you want to go to the top here?

Speaker 1  1:18:55
Murph, yeah, when you say top, Matt, what do you

Matthias Miller  1:19:01
we have a 16th. We have 100% curve on this first one too. By the way,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:07
zero out of George 7/16, by two and seven, eight. It's telling me we're taking it out of a five and a half by six. Do you know the item?

Matthias Miller  1:19:22
Matt, 716, by two. Fa, 550, 3.5

Unknown Speaker  1:19:31
FA, yeah, that's favorable, George, let me i

Matthias Miller  1:19:44
fa, 533, 533.

Speaker 1  1:19:48
Five. George, so you're telling me you're running it through the brewer twice, and you're standing it on edge. You. Getting a full six or whatever, then you're Wait, yeah, yeah. So I just have to assign, I just have to assign the yield. So in other words, then you're getting how many pieces out of one.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
Yeah, 18 makes sense. Got it. Got it all right, all right. Any other ones are?

Matthias Miller  1:20:41
Matt, no. My next question would be, how are you? I know nothing here, but if you go back, how are you getting 18 out of the first one, but 10 out of the second one,

Speaker 1  1:20:53
two and seven, eight versus five and a half? That because it's ripped in half. Then, then we're

Matthias Miller  1:21:04
all right, I get it, yeah, right. You're ripping a different direction. Okay. How did

Speaker 1  1:21:12
I get back? Where was I? Man, oh, here we go.

Matthias Miller  1:21:17
We're in a different you were in the one I

Speaker 1  1:21:20
set up for you should be good here. Let me go back.

Matthias Miller  1:21:23
Okay, so I can, I can get rid of the 916 by three and a half out of a three and a half by three and a half, right? Yeah, what was that? We're not using it anymore.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:32
Hand sizes for that guy. Exactly yes, three and a half to three and a half to gotta go. Okay? And then all these are duplicated. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:21:51
we're also no longer getting a we're also no longer getting a three and a half by three and a half out of a three and a half by three and a half. I'm not sure why that one's in there. I'm sorry that was the one you were saying. Could go

Speaker 1  1:22:08
well, the three and a half by three and a half should be eliminated. But what do you know? What that was, Matt, that

Matthias Miller  1:22:18
that one's not being the three and a half by three and a half out of its is not that's not being used.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23
You're gonna eliminate it. That's good.

Matthias Miller  1:22:34
Three and a half by eight and a half. We have the can't size, but it's not used.

Speaker 1  1:22:41
Yeah, we are. We are using it seven,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:47
set it up. Okay, so the

Speaker 1  1:22:52
he's, I don't know why that's not we're getting inch and a 16th by three and a half out of that, and it's a better yield

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
1.2 let me look at something quick. 1.28 divided by 1.2 is it's not eight divided by 1.26

Speaker 1  1:23:19
and two thirds, 8.5 divided by 1.2 is seven. So, yeah, oh, no, three up at six. Hang on. Hang on. So I can tell you, what can I add a dimension here or not? I can't.

Matthias Miller  1:23:40
Yeah, you can, all right, not in here, but go into it. Sorry, you can't, not from here, but go in right here, right?

Speaker 1  1:23:46
Yep, so I would say thickness is one point. That's not right. You want the we need, the actual so 1.0625 3.5 3.5 and seven. That's what we get out of a three and a half by eight and a half. I'll hit Save back to there. Does that update? Let's go. Okay, there we go. Now it's up there. So,

Matthias Miller  1:24:26
so that one's not used yet?

Speaker 1  1:24:29
Well, we use it. We actually are used. I'm not sure why it's not it's not set anywhere, but I gotta go with the I have to go with 11. Why is the curve? More? Hang on that don't make sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:53
Why is it? Oh.

Speaker 1  1:25:00
What is the scoop on here? What that's weird. I'm sorry. I just, I'm having a moment here with this thing. What is up with this six?

Speaker 1  1:25:22
Six level, 1.2 is so 1.2 8.5 divided by 1.2 is 12. So I have more curve when I take it out of an eight and a half. The problem is, Matt, if I, if I take it out of us, what is the problem? Hang on a second. Let me i

Speaker 1  1:26:18
i don't know why we would take them out of eight and a halfs, if we can

Unknown Speaker  1:26:29
Get them out of it, Think that's your Final setting. What I

Speaker 1  1:27:57
all right, sorry, man, that's up on a trail. Sorry about mine. Oh, but I got so.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16
Do you want to keep it in? I'm not. I'm not sure why we're anyway, the Yeah, I do, which one do we go with?

Matthias Miller  1:28:30
Well, we're not. I mean, we're not using it now, so I mean, but we can whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:38
Well, can we choose a curve here. If you got a mean,

Matthias Miller  1:28:46
I think, I think, I think I want to,

Matthias Miller  1:28:56
I think I think the idea would be to slightly restructure how we're doing it here where you on the lumber dimensions for each each lumber dimensions, you say what it can be cut out of, and then you specify the curve on how it should be priced. Are you going to want to use?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:17
Isn't that what we're doing? I mean, that's what we're doing

Matthias Miller  1:29:24
closely, but I mean, I mean, yeah, essentially, as it stands now, we're, we've got the,

Matthias Miller  1:29:39
well anyway, how we store it? The store that under the hood, but is, is the only question at play. Um, so do you want to use this exact curve, pricing curve percentage, or do you want to override this some way, like it's 24.7 but I want to do 25 or it's 2813 I want to do.

Speaker 1  1:30:00
28 on the curve percentage, yep. I would love to override it on the inch and a 16th, yeah, I'd call it 12%

Unknown Speaker  1:30:12
okay, right in the middle there. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:19
Yep. Makes sense.

Speaker 1  1:30:21
Do you? Does that create issues on the backs, on you said, under the hood?

Matthias Miller  1:30:29
No, I think, I mean, I think, I think it makes, I think what makes sense is to split configure can't sizes to literally be what sizes of cans, and configure lumber dimensions as what dimensions you know, what's the pricing? Be able to look at it on a per lumber dimension basis, and what cans can it come out of? And what's the what curve percentage should be used for pricing? I

Speaker 1  1:31:05
Okay, yeah, we'll configure. Can't sizes is under the hood, right? Yeah, um. I mean it's very It's um, I mean, I love, I love this window like it shows us the curve that we would. It shows the curve percentage, you know, it gives me that option to see here's curve, if I do it out of this, whatever, but for that. But as far as Do you want to change this window to like a make it only show one dimension? Is that what you were saying, in other words, based on this dimension, here's the can't.

Matthias Miller  1:32:04
Yes, that would be my preference. So you have one dimension, here's the curve percentage for pricing, and here are the cans, and we can still calculate the curve percentage off the cans. I don't know. Is there a simpler way? This is where you always like run into issues. I feel like long term that's going to be more maintainable, but if we want to just maybe, but we can put pricing somewhere else and leave this as it is. I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
can still give you

Speaker 1  1:32:45
so so, like, in a scenario where like, Hey, okay, they're making, all of a sudden, we're buying three and a half of fives. Okay, great. And we can, we start using three and a half of fives for something.

Speaker 1  1:33:12
The pricing doesn't care. This window doesn't care.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:16
Well, well for the cut list, it does

Unknown Speaker  1:33:23
this care? How's this tied to cut list?

Matthias Miller  1:33:27
When we generate the cut list, we calculate the number of camps based on the camp size that we're cutting out of,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:36
right? And the yield

Unknown Speaker  1:33:38
and the yield.

Speaker 1  1:33:39
So you're saying you're, you're, you're getting your yield numbers from this window.

Matthias Miller  1:33:46
The can't, well, the the required, yeah, quantity per King, that tells us how many cans we need

Speaker 1  1:33:53
comes from this window. Okay, and so. But then what if, like, there are some, like the inch and a 16th by three and a half. George is going to cut it out of a three and a half by six. One time, three and a half by eight and a half. Another time, he may even cut it out three and a half by eight and peel a half inch off the side like I guess he has to be able to still use different camp dimensions. Yeah. Um, so I don't want to assign a can't dimension to to the cut list based on the lumber dimension.

Matthias Miller  1:34:35
No, he would still, anytime anything with the cut list. He would have to manually assign what can't it's coming out of, okay, okay. But for pricing purposes, we would use, I

Speaker 1  1:34:45
guess I would love to, I would love to see those multiples in here. In other words, if the lumber dimension is repeated on different can't dimensions, i. Would love to allow that to stay in here, but if we have to eliminate all but one for pricing, then it is what it is. No.

Matthias Miller  1:35:13
We would No. We would leave them in here. Oh, you just designate my currently. We have, we have a so what I'm proposing is, currently we have one can't size tying to multiple lumber dimensions. I would like to flip that around and say we have one lumber dimension tying to multiple cant sizes so that, so that you can assign the curve percentage on that. So then when you go into we can still make this exact same report. But then when you that way, otherwise you're jumping back and forth between can't sizes and saying, well, well, you need somewhere to put the pricing information. So you need to either have a completely separate place to put the pricing, and if you want to compare, you got to jump between them. That's all I'm really think I understand.

Speaker 1  1:36:02
I think that makes sense. So lumber to Yeah, okay, so then the ones you text me, Matt, the that list, would you put those in this window and leave them blank and then allow me to go and fill it in.

Matthias Miller  1:36:26
Yeah, put him. I probably have to put them in zeros, sure, yeah, I can't

Speaker 1  1:36:32
or, how did you what? Yeah, did you have another idea?

Matthias Miller  1:36:36
Well, I don't know what they should be cut out of. That's probably the biggest thing.

Speaker 1  1:36:40
Well, I would assign, I would just assign a can that they should come out of.

Matthias Miller  1:36:45
Well, that's fair. Once I, once I switch this around, I can put them in there, and you can assign the cans to it. Yep.

Speaker 1  1:36:50
That sounds awesome. Okay, does that leave any weirdness? Okay, good, good, good. Shall we? Shall we? Pause the shall we? What's the word?

Matthias Miller  1:37:10
Adjourn, adjourn. Sure we can adjourn. I'm gonna guess that. Yeah, let me know. Let me know when you want to meet up. I'm going to guess Friday is the earliest that makes sense for me.

Speaker 1  1:37:29
Oh, yeah, same. That's perfectly fine. I recap on the Rick came back with sewing and assembly for the last four years. Labor. Labor, I probably double check you don't need that number right now. Do you those numbers now? Do you I have a bunch of homework on the machine overhead, but that's so I have homework there. Lumber prices at some point. Special Order lumber me and George, the decimals on the plywood, but you're gonna have to let me know when that's ready, and then the raw material. Yeah, ton of work on my side. So should we plan something? Or should we?

Matthias Miller  1:38:17
Yeah, we can. I'm fine place. I'm pretty sure I'm fine. I'm fine. Planning it if you want.

Speaker 1  1:38:27
Okay, let me see a quick, quick glance at my combine.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:33
There we go. I don't

Speaker 1  1:38:36
know how to get rid of this thing. You don't you probably only see that down there it is trying to get to my calendar. Yeah, I'm no, I'm nothing. I'm open Friday, so I'm I can either way, Matt, I'm trying to think, Oh no, I have a guy coming at three o'clock Friday. I'm flexible otherwise, I have a three o'clock meeting, three or 330 Friday,

Speaker 1  1:39:12
I'm going to say I prefer, I prefer like 12 between. Well, I don't care. I don't want to, I don't want to force you in a I'm pretty flexible. Otherwise, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:39:23
I would prefer something like, you know, sometime in the one to three time frame, Eastern Time, Eastern Time.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:30
Yeah, that's fine. Let's do one o'clock.

Speaker 2  1:39:32
Alright, alright. Good, awesome. Thank you, man, yes, sir. Bye.
