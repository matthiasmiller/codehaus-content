Unknown Speaker  00:01
as well as your name right, Tom? Yes, yep. All right. So you'll have the room you. You're the one that writes like, trendy text. Is that correct?

Speaker 1  00:25
Yes. Like I, like I say to people, I don't write the books, I write the ads that sell the books. Or the sheds depending.

Speaker 2  00:37
Okay, so So how does this work? I mean is, is, is writing scripts, just purely a creative thing, like some people have a creative streak and they can write scripts, or is it something that you learn? Like, if I decided my, you know, goal in life was going to be write scripts, just like Tom, could I learn it?

Speaker 1  01:05
Well, I'm trying to practice. Well, I'm kind of proud to be able to say this, but I just so happened to be a natural at what I do. So yeah, it just kind of does come to me the bad news is, it makes it a little hard to do to do it the exact way I do it for others. But to answer your other question, it's, I'd say it's about 6040 to 60% art and 40%. So you can't get there without the science. But but the art is the important part in my opinion.

Speaker 2  01:41
So when I'm going down the road, I'm looking left and right looking at sheds and looking at metal roofs you know, head going back and forth really fast. If I wrote scripts like you did, would I be like looking at all the scripts all the time? Wow, that was me. Someone did a good job horrible.

Speaker 1  02:03
You know, I think I am the worst to be honest. I am the worst a list copywriter on Earth at doing that.

Unknown Speaker  02:12
The worst but

Speaker 1  02:15
the worst copywriter on earth that going? I mean, I do I do look at you know what's working for others. And particularly, like I went through all the shed the shed to people in the southeast, you know, to get a feel for what's working. Like it's more of a science thing. So I don't I don't feel the need so much to to look at, you know, other copywriters because I'm pretty confident. But I do like to look at what I know is working. So if I know a company is spending a lot of money on their ads, that gives me evidence that their ads work. So so I might, you know, look at some of the, the, the angles and some of the things that they're talking about. If I can,

Unknown Speaker  03:02
sorry, you're sorry. I'll be quiet. Go ahead.

Matthias Miller  03:04
It's all good. I wanted to introduce Jonathan and Alex as well. They're both on the call. So, Jonathan, hello.

Speaker 3  11:45
well, the tech issues How's everybody doing today?

Speaker 4  11:49
Sorry about that. It's got I'm not sure what like it should be.

Speaker 3  12:00
It's fine. I've been on many calls and webinars where things went wrong. I've been on live presentations where things went wrong. I do mean live in person not live online.

Unknown Speaker  12:22
So is that is that you talking, Jonathan?

Speaker 3  12:25
This is Jonathan Wilson speaking? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Nice

Speaker 2  12:29
to meet you too. Nice to hear your voice. I've always wondered what a real gurus voice sounded like.

Speaker 3  12:35
Matthias told me that you asked something like that a while back, trust me, I'm not a guru. I'm just a fellow trying to do good work just like.

Speaker 2  12:45
So I'm going to somebody, buddy. And if, if we're ready to start the call here, we're just kind of killing time right now. Right?

Speaker 3  12:53
We're trying to trying to get all the right people on. So for those who aren't here. I'm assuming everybody knows why we're here. But just in case you don't. So we I'm the, I guess you'd call the media buyer, meaning that I'm the fellow that helps run and manage the TADS. Alex is my team member. He's my director of Facebook ads. I myself handle mostly Google side. Alex is our specialist on the Facebook side. And Tom Thomas Bell is here for the email copywriting project. Now, part of the point of the call today is that both Facebook content and email content needs, that there's a lot that goes into it, we need to know how people look at and experience this entire process of thinking about buying a shed and then actually buying it. And so on the one hand, we're looking for some really specific details, including like what people like and don't like, and what makes them do things. But we're also looking for what we will loosely call content, which is going to be like stories and stuff. You've heard stuff that people like good things that happened. But work I'm kind of assuming and usually in a business of people who interact with the customers the most that's the salespeople have majority of those stories, and that's why I was kind of hoping to get all the sales folks on here before we fire away. What I might do Matthias is I could ask some more of the mundane questions that are not so story driven while we get started while we're waiting to get started, is that good or

Speaker 5  14:37
bad? All right. Give me one second. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  14:42
Kelvin is in which means that Mike is

Speaker 6  14:44
stuck outside so I don't know if you a bye eight Kelvin eight jumped out it brought Kelvin in and Kelvin three weighed me back so Mike here as well. Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  14:58
So we got everybody

Unknown Speaker  14:59
Good.

Speaker 3  15:00
All right, super good. So, um, alright, so we'll fire away and Alex and, Tom, when we get to your I know, we've all three been working on the questions here. When we get to your stuff, just jump in and take it away. Okay, so I'll start with some basics. How many sheds? Oh, before I get started, some of these questions are going to sound cut and dry. I'm not looking for yes and no answers. I'm looking for details and some, you know, some in depth insight as we go along. But let's start with some basics. So how many sheds? Have you guys built in the last year? Any ideas that hundreds dozens?

Speaker 3  15:43
Assuming somebody in the operation or management arena should answer that question is maybe you might need

Speaker 6  15:55
to you're asking how many shares have we built? Year to date?

Speaker 3  16:03
Year to date? It's fine. I met in the last 12 months, but sure, we could do a year to date.

Unknown Speaker  16:10
somewhere in the neighborhood of probably are paying hundreds, probably.

Speaker 3  16:24
Less and how many do you think you've built ever? Like in the entire lifetime of the company? You can guess it's fine.

Unknown Speaker  16:34
Dave, you got to do that a quick one on that one?

Speaker 2  16:39
Okay, you said 1400 year to date or 1400 for a year?

Speaker 6  16:46
Year to date, I would say 12 to 1400. somewhere in that neighborhood. Okay,

Speaker 2  16:51
so that would mean how many in a year? Maybe? Less? Right. Okay. And we've been building sheds since 1999. So that is let's just say 20 years, and probably average. What would be half the 2700?

Unknown Speaker  17:21
Let's say?

Speaker 2  17:23
I'm going to say probably be 20,000. Does that sound? Alright, might

Unknown Speaker  17:32
be close?

Unknown Speaker  17:34
Sorry, was that 1000? That was the answer.

Matthias Miller  17:40
One is 20,000.

Speaker 6  17:44
There's some that would be we're just talking strictly about the district and see there's there's affiliates in other districts that will greatly affect that number. But just this weekend, see we're talking about

Speaker 3  18:00
just give me a guess we don't have to have exact details if you did include the affiliates. So the biggest possible number, what would that be

Speaker 6  18:12
if you're going to be able to speak better into the to other districts gives an idea

Speaker 2  18:18
probably twice that. But I mean, to be honest, if we're talking about you know, true points, it would just be the 20 though, like at this point, the others are you know, under other brands.

Speaker 3  18:37
So, not always but with most businesses out of every you know every time you deliver something to a customer you have a certain percentage who are really happy a certain percentage who are not happy and everybody else's average. How many of your customers would you say you've been just like absolutely thrilled with the whole thing

Speaker 6  19:05
how many would be absolutely that last part would be absolutely I didn't quite catch that and I'm sorry.

Speaker 3  19:11
Absolutely thrilled with everything about it including the process the customer service the shed itself.

Speaker 6  19:20
So if we just look at the troop point umbrella, I would say that particular segment of it probably having the five or 80% Probably

Speaker 3  19:39
Okay, and what what do you think goes wrong with the the unhappy foes? What some commonalities is it? Is there anything in particular that they don't like the prices they don't like the delivery, they aren't really quite happy with the building or what happens when things aren't perfect.

Speaker 6  20:01
Probably the larger one, if something things that go wrong such as either manufacture defective On arrival, if there are situations like that or damage happening to the shed on delivery or damage to property as in, you know, leaning ruts in the yard or stuff like that, those would probably be the three top ones, probably a major one. That's a player in this switch we offer we do offer support is, you know, after set reset, especially on block peers, he goes through the freezing and thawing process and through that the peers do move a little bit. And so doors typically shift a little bit. And door sticky is a common one, not upon arrival, but maybe down the road, people being like, hey, we've got to have some fix. They don't understand what's wrong. We do fix that. But that is a little pain point that probably is a large one.

Speaker 3  21:10
Okay, makes good sense. And I think I've asked him thisis a few times. But do I understand correctly that so far, dogs have not really gathered like reviews, testimonials, or any other written feedback from the customers?

Unknown Speaker  21:30
There's been minimal, Dwayne, do you have an answer for that?

Unknown Speaker  21:36
Not really, I

Unknown Speaker  21:38
mean, it's been Yeah, I would agree with you very minimal.

Speaker 3  21:44
We'll talk more about it later. But that is something we need to change. pretty compelling. So this goes for your website, emails, really any marketing online and offline. It makes for a really compelling point when people who are looking at buying a shed from you can read in, you know, from other customers in their own words, how happy they were. And that's something we need to keep in mind and start working on moving forward. What, couple more basic questions here? What are the total price ranges for the sheds? Like what what's the cheapest and most expensive thing you sell? And what's the average price point?

Speaker 6  22:32
Average price point would be somewhere in the $7,000 range. High end would be somewhere closer to 25 grand, and the low end would be four in the $3,000 range.

Unknown Speaker  22:51
Right to confirm the average of seven, correct.

Speaker 3  22:57
That is what he said. Yeah, Tom, that's right. Okay, storytime somebody described for me a perfect customer. And this is from your perspective. So this is the kind of person that you're sitting there on the lot. And when this kind of person walks up, you are happy to start talking to them.

Unknown Speaker  23:17
What are they like? So go ahead, I'm gonna let either Arcus Kelvin or ginger talk for that one. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  23:36
I guess I would say

Unknown Speaker  23:43
yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Ginger.

Speaker 7  23:46
Okay, so I would just say the best type of customer is they know what they want. They look they see it, they come in, they say, that's what I want. That's what I've been looking for. And about it.

Speaker 3  24:03
Do you find that in Tom or Alex helped me with this, but ginger, do you find that there's anything in common between these people? Like, I can't make this up for you. And I don't want to put words in your mouth. But do you find that they are a certain kind of person like it's in or it's the families or maybe they're older? Or maybe they like anything you've ever noticed about? And I get this the person who already knows what they want, but is there anything you could describe them with?

Speaker 7  24:38
Well, they've already done their research. And then they, you know, they're looking around and trying to find the best deal they're trying to find. There's a certain type of feature that they want. I mean, I've only been doing this for a month, so

Unknown Speaker  24:58
gratulations

Speaker 7  25:00
I have seen Thank you, that's kind of what I have been seeing. Most people have done a lot of research in my area, and they've not quite found what they're looking for. And now when they're coming out here, they're seeing that I have different colors, different styles, different, you know, features that they're not seeing as the best posts they are. You know, that's what they're coming after.

Speaker 1  25:27
And ginger, if you had to guess, I get that you've been doing it for about a month now. Are they? Mostly men, mostly women, you know, mostly over 5060? Any any insights on that front?

Speaker 7  25:44
Um, so most of the people that I have seen a lot have been men or families, they either are men with children, or they are the wives their waistband, but then it's the men that are coming to look. That's a lot of what I've had. So far. The online stuff has been mainly women, I would say cuz they're looking for a particular thing. You know, like a she shed or something like that. The online? And they're probably anywhere from 30 to 60. Is, is the average that I have you been speaking to?

Speaker 3  26:33
Okay, do you have? And maybe you haven't asked? Or maybe they haven't told you? But have you asked anything that would indicate like, do they tend to be homeowners renters in any urban rural, any other info related to where and how they live? Um,

Speaker 7  26:54
I don't, I don't know. Because they it's been a wide variety. I have I've seen, I've seen some that are on farms that are looking for just, you know, something to be out there for storage, I have seen some that are looking to turn stuff in into a chicken coop, I have seen people trying to change, you know, do some sort of office in their backyard to make things more accessible for them, instead of using their home. I mean, it's kind of all over the place. For myself right now.

Speaker 3  27:34
That's great. Those are good answers. Any of the other sales folks who've been around longer and you got any deeper insights into this demographics, who they are or how you would describe them? i This is, again, this is like, the perfect customer, the one that you wish you could talk to that kind of only that kind

Speaker 5  27:55
I guess I'll try here. You know, I can't say that. But I can really identify the perfect customer, they're all different. And, and, you know, and, and I've had good success with people that walked in here, and they had money. And, and they just bought right away. But I've had people that have had the RTO their building, and yet they were good customers, too. It's just a little hard to say. As some of them, it takes a while. And they take 234 visits, until they decide what they're gonna do. But yet, you know, I still look at them as a good customer, they're happy, the big thing I see is that we just have a good product. That is they liked the features. And to me, that's what's selling because there's people shopping around, they're going down the street, they're looking at other stuff, and they come back here because they they like what they see.

Speaker 3  29:00
Nice. All right. All right, let's flip that on its head describe the kind of customers you don't want to work with. This may sound a little funny at all. But the thing is, is that when we're creating marketing materials, we are trying to get the attention of the right person and defuse or hopefully turn away somebody who's going to be looking for something that you don't have or that you don't want to be working with that kind of person. Not saying anything about them as a person is just like what's best for you guys and what we should steer away from for you guys, you guys meaning the salespeople, okay, or the company as a whole. So do you tend to find to find that there is and again, maybe not, maybe there's no way to describe this person. But if there is the kind of person that again, you're at the sales lot, you see them walking in the door coming up Driving you go, Okay, this is probably not gonna result in a sale and it's not gonna be fun. If there's any earmarks for that, I want to hear about it.

Speaker 4  30:12
So good a good explanation for that as I was in the RV industry and we despised engineers buying our products

Unknown Speaker  30:27
let I'm

Speaker 6  30:28
gonna see from, I'm gonna pick from a perspective on that. One of the customers that come the customers that we don't really relish so much are the ones that are just price shopping, we have, we like the customers very much that are shopping for our features or quality, we have unique things like a designer series we really like to focus on. And we focus on that we have customers that appreciate value. Those are the customers that we really, really, like, those are people that appreciate what we have just price shoppers. They shop all across the street, they don't care about the quality, the whatever, you know, that they don't care about, all they care about is, you know, the $10 that they may save depending on where they buy. And, you know, just be staring at more scabs, you know, all their life. So I would say that mimic might be one aspect

Speaker 3  31:29
of it. Alex, and Thomas so help me a little bit here because you guys do this research stuff more than I do. So I think that was Mike speaking. So he was Mike was just describing the right kind of person from the point of view. The salesman, but can Thomas or Alex say something here that would help us see like, how would that customer see themselves? Like we now know how Mike sees his customer? But how would that customer see themselves? Help me out with the questions?

Speaker 1  32:04
Oh, I'll throw this in here. And I have a question. Also. If they're price shopping, they know their price shop. And so we tell them that they're price shopping, you got it like that's, that's how I would view that kind of guy. He knows good and well that he's you know, looking for a coupon. And, and I want to throw this into the conversation. There's a phrase that I just jotted down in my notes. Hey, we're not the cheapest, but we are the best. Now that's going to drive away. That's going to drive away that guy. well and truly, are we okay with something like that? Maybe not that strong, but you know, focusing on the quality and hey, Quality Matters, do it, do it right once or do it twice. It's those kinds of statements. Will it'll keep the it'll keep the price shoppers at bay. That's that's how I would go with it. I just wanted to get approval because it's good to turn away a lead or two, but they'll be better leads.

Speaker 3  33:11
Alright, I get into that later. Okay, so referring back to the fact that y'all don't really have you haven't really collected reviews. Can anybody tell me? anecdotal stories from like a customer bought the shed and after they bought it? They said thank you. But hopefully more than just thank you, right? Like, I don't know, maybe they sent you a note or call back and say how amazing it was or anything like that. And you can recall

Speaker 6  33:37
it, mark as you've been selling for the longest. I'm sure you got some feedback on that. Mark is on Marcus Pilar, are you are you muted?

Speaker 5  33:55
Mic was muted. I'm sorry. Yeah, I heard you. Yes. I'm sorry. It was echoing sabbatic is on the understand the question.

Speaker 3  34:07
So we're looking for anything that someone can remember where a client was so happy with the shed with the service, whatever, with experience that they maybe called you back to say thank you maybe sent you a note or anything where you can kind of quote back what the customer said, as, let's call it an expression of gratitude.

Speaker 5  34:34
Okay. The difficult customers we've had here at the lot in South Boston. We've always been able to have a good outcome. And I just received a thank you card yesterday in the mail from a realtor that we had a really difficult client with, and thankfully Burkholder and vinyl structures Never knew about it because we were able to resolve it between me and the realtor, but it had to do with the HOA. And those are always sticky situations. But the realtor drop me a note, saying that she appreciated us keeping it low key and were able to resolve issues at hand. And it was just because it wasn't anything against me are against her. But the lady was very frustrated. She was she had bought this property, she was remodeling the house, she had a lot going on, and she was highly frustrated. And when you have that situation, things can get charged. And that's what we had here. But it turned out well. And fortunately, the customer in our good friends, and she's come by the office several times, and yes, she was fine. So you have those situations that become charged. Sometimes people misunderstand that. To me, that's a good customer. Because when they leave happy, they're gonna go tell their friends. And that happens quite often here. Thankfully.

Speaker 3  36:03
That is a great story. Thanks for that. Yeah. Anything else? How often do you all actually get a card or a call? Is that like very rare, or it happens a few times a year?

Speaker 5  36:14
Well, I've been here for a year, and I have I have like six cards in my file so far. And I'm not trying to brush my hair here. But when I get the it's an encouragement to me because yeah, either it's a card of thanks for being served. Well, it's usually not something that was discharged. But I did, we did have one a while back that Burkholder management had to help with and it was a gentleman over in Durham, and he was very unreasonable. And Leanne did a very good job of taking care of that. And I was more or less a witness what was being said. I couldn't make any promises, of course, what was going to how things were going to be handled. But that was up to Burkholder. But yeah, it turned out well. And yeah, we're good.

Speaker 3  37:06
Paper. Any more anecdotal stories from anybody that is? Same thing customer took the time to tell you, thank you. And there's some it's super helpful when there's a cause or reason behind it, or extra details like that.

Speaker 7  37:22
Um, yeah, I have one. So like I said, I've only been doing this for a month. So this is the one that I have thoroughly enjoyed. And I, this will be two little girls. They came in one day, they bought a play house. While we were sitting here talking with mom trying to decide what she was going to do if she was gonna go through with it. I've got coloring pictures of these girls names in my little folder here. And anyway, mom said, Yeah, let's do it. So they went ahead and bought the playhouse for an RTS. And anyway, they were trying to figure out how quick they can get their building. I spoke with everybody that I could to get it there as fast as I could, because being a new lot, we were trying to push it, you know, customer satisfaction. So with Burkholder, they were there transportation detail, they were able to get that to them within just a couple of days, the little girls, they found out that my husband was one of the drivers. And when he came out, they hugged him tremendously and thanked him for bringing their building. We had our grand opening, that couple of days later, they all came to me they had me They thanked me for talking by us and bringing them and building and all that good stuff. So it was it was nice for all the way around. They were able to come enjoy about the house with us. They were able to have lunch with us. And I think that that in itself made a good impression for everybody.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
That's wonderful. What else seeing more those. Hey, guys,

Speaker 8  39:08
I have a I have a quick question. Has anyone been on the when the product gets delivered to a client? Had they ever seen the expression when the client sees their their finished chip?

Unknown Speaker  39:33
Well, let's start getting pictures of that.

Speaker 7  39:39
Yes, I have. I've ridden with my husband to deliver buildings. I haven't technically sold one and then rode with him to deliver the buildings but I have ridden with him one time before she deliver one of our buildings. And when we got done, she looked at me and she said I didn't realize what all this entails. Old? And I just told her I said, Yeah, I said, it's not just sticking in and out in a hole for you. It's it's everything, you know, leveling it, making sure because it had anchors and all that good stuff. And she I mean, she just looked at me with excitement because she just was shocked at what they were able to do for her how they were able to go about it. And I think that I think that's so nice to see. And it was a I was appreciative of it, because then I was able to see what my husband does on the daily. So, you know, exciting to see them. side is

Unknown Speaker  40:37
for sharing? Yeah.

Speaker 3  40:41
Um, how are we doing for time, folks? I have plenty. I was just trying to ask Matthias, if we have a hard set off here in 20 minutes, or if we can keep going

Matthias Miller  40:54
to kill the calendar event actually said 430. Eastern. So I don't know how much if Jonathan, if you think will be wrapped up by the energy need. You asked him for time up until like 5pm.

Speaker 3  41:12
Okay, and I didn't realize that. So we've got more than 20 minutes. Okay, good, super. I didn't look at the tail. And I was just asking. Let's see here.

Speaker 1  41:22
Hey, Jonathan, gotta move on. Before we move on, if possible, if there are notes or letters, and if it's okay with management, and if there are photos of any kind, with buyers in front of their sheds? It would it would help us to have them and or use them if that's cool.

Speaker 3  41:47
For sure, and including if there has been multiple thank you notes and that kind of thing. Again, if there's some story to it, that's a little bit beyond just literally Thank you two words, it'd be super helpful. If we can get a copy of that facts. transcribe it. Any way you can get it to us, the more more materials we have to work with better. All right, I'm gonna shift gears a little bit here, Tom and Alex, I'm going to skip some questions because I'm afraid even with the 30 minute mark, we're gonna run out of time. And if you think as give something important in the document, just let me know. What out of all the different kinds of sheds you sell, what do you sell the most of? So in other words, as far as moving the most amount of inventory, what what is that model or type

Speaker 2  42:42
I'm gonna jump in here just for one minute, and I'm not a salesperson. So take it for what it's worth. One thing I've seen a shift that I've seen over the past about a year is we used to see lots and lots and lots of smaller, more inexpensive sheds being sold RTO it was actually for a long time, there was 60% of the sheds got sold an RTO and 40% were paid cash. And that completely shifted in the people that are buying shirts today, or very small percentage or to Dwayne you could probably tell us what that number is. And it's people are buying bigger, more expensive shit. I'm just looking at the overall orders coming in. I'm not actually out there talking with the customer. But that's one thing I'm seeing in the other thing that maybe this is going back. What is the ideal customer there's three things that we three products we develop that we kind of are a little bit proud of maybe Lux guard perma guard and leak guard. And very, very, very, very few people have this and if people go shopping and they're looking for those things, and they come to our lot the sale is pretty much done. Just yesterday guy showed up or an older lady, I guess it was and and the salesperson here. Me shed and they bought locks guard and he educated them on Locks guard leak guard and perma guard. And if they would have left to go shopping elsewhere, they would have came back because they wouldn't have found it.

Unknown Speaker  44:48
But yeah, don't please.

Speaker 2  44:52
I guess just now the interesting thing is, is I read an article just yesterday about Walmart in tar Have it I guess they're seeing less luxury things selling. And more necessities, people are spending more on the cities. And I also saw how credit card debt is going way up. Which is interesting, because it's the exact opposite of what we're seeing. So I'm not sure what to make out of all this. But I'm sure you've got you understand all this and know where people are gonna go next. And have long comment.

Speaker 1  45:33
Sorry, I'm I guess, my guess is if I had to guess, and I'll say it out loud. So somebody can tell me I'm wrong, maybe. But I'm guessing that with the with the economy the way it is, and with COVID coming and going, hopefully, I'm thinking a lot of people are working from home. And based on what you're saying gave that the sheds are getting a little bigger, I'm seeing a lot of I'm guessing that a lot of that is going to be offices, man caves, you know, stuff that they can use? Because they're staying home more. Does that sound sound like I'm barking up the right tree? As far as the trend in sheds?

Speaker 2  46:15
I think it could be could very well be the case. Yeah. Once again, I'm not talking to the actual customer, you know, and asking, What are you going to use this for? But yeah, there's just kind of a disconnect with overall people are spending, you know, more on necessities, less on luxuries. But what we're seeing is the exact opposite. But I think what you're saying is, it's a different set of people buying sheds for different reasons.

Speaker 1  46:47
Yeah, they sort of are necessities for these people is what I'm saying. You know, just spending more time at home, and they're trying to get a little more space in the house. So it feels right in my head. As far as why the why the sheds are getting bigger over the last year or so.

Speaker 2  47:05
Well, yeah, the other thing that could be helpful for marketing is this morning, I was telling the guys that if we want to be real positive, about the shadows just to shed industry, we talk about when things are getting, you know, there's economy's good people have lots of money, people are buying toys and doing landscaping and they're buying lawn mowers. And then each is when things go south. People buy sheds to save money, because it's a whole lot cheaper to buy a shed than it is to build an addition to the house. And you know, people lose their homes, and they go back to mom and dad when you place to put her stuff. So for whatever that's worth

Unknown Speaker  47:47
a lot, actually. Thanks for that.

Unknown Speaker  47:49
Yeah, that that helped. That helped a bunch.

Speaker 3  47:51
There's there's been a couple of comments about sheds, people, you know, people buying sheds that are bigger, can you define bigger is bigger, like over a certain size? Is that two stories is what do y'all mean, when you say bigger?

Unknown Speaker  48:05
Michael, you're going to be able to answer that better than

Speaker 6  48:10
the overall average dollar sales went up. And nicely, dramatically over the last three years, two years, used to be more like maybe in the 1000 range where it's more like in the seven ish today. So people are spending more, spending more per sale, which we have a lot more value driven customers buying from us because of some of the unique products that we now have. So upselling has been has been a lot more prominent. And interestingly for comments were made earlier about little brothers did about less RTOS. In the last year, we have seen less RTOS seems like people have more money like readily available and that change or with the economy. But it seems like in the last year, people have had more money in their pocket, and more readily willing to spend it. And so maybe a be part of the factor that's been causing people to be able to afford larger buildings. I don't know. So it seems like the average dollar sale is just well, it has gone up and so specifically size. The average size that we used to sell was a little bit 20. And for years, and that size would be obviously proportionately larger than that now with our sales going up. I don't know if that answers the question or not.

Speaker 3  49:47
Almost let me just make sure I understood you. So you're saying that in the past, kind of an average size was like a 20 foot and now it tends to be larger. I'm just not sure if I understood you correctly on that.

Speaker 6  50:00
For years, 12 to 20 was the average size like the overall size, if you took the entire year, and rounded it all out, he was told that 20 Now we'd be looking at a larger size. Specifically, I didn't do my homework on that, again, I just know the average dollar sale is higher, significantly higher than it was, I would guess it to be more like an average of maybe a 12. But 24 to 28, maybe and an average size for the entire year if you rounded it out.

Speaker 2  50:28
And it's not just that the the size has gone up, it seems people are buying more of the upgrades like the here at the shop, if people show up. It's like, a completely different attitude from a year ago, a year ago, it was niggling and diming. More like, ooh, that's too much money, let's just get the basic. And now it's like, hey, take a look at this Licari. You know, watch this engage in pop, I want that doesn't really matter what the price doesn't matter. But there's more of that.

Speaker 6  51:06
Really good point there focusing on that has been really, really successful from our position here. And I would say that pretty much is why there's the dollar sales going up or value features and selling on this stuff. Focusing on this stuff very successful. So this exterior siding, this designer series, exterior siding has been very successful to take that the shopping out of these customers where they don't shop for it. Because we're virtually the only place to get by it. So if you want this. You buy it here. And there's these upgrade all these

Unknown Speaker  51:42
upgrades that we do.

Speaker 4  51:46
I was just I was seeing on Facebook, some of the comments coming in. Just one of the latest comments was what's the largest size? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:00
largest size we build? You're asking?

Speaker 4  52:04
I'm just saying that was a question what ask is indicating they're looking for the biggest size available?

Speaker 3  52:09
And that's really important. Okay, good. That's all been super helpful. Let's pivot just a little bit. So I'm sure that in general, we all are glad to sell anything, especially if it's large, or has the extra features or whatever. But sometimes a business that has multiple products will have a reason to try to sell a certain type a certain size, certain time. And maybe because of production capacity, it may be because of ROI per unit, or or anything about it that makes it easier or better to sell. Do you guys have anything like that where you know, out of all the different possibilities you really, really want to move a lot of a particular kind or is everything perfectly equal for you? So

Speaker 2  53:06
I think I'm repeating myself here. We love love scard. A, we love perma guard, and we love LeakGuard.

Speaker 2  53:18
So the second answer to that is we're actually we spent a lot of time digging into our pricing, actually a couple months. And we discovered that the way we were doing our pricing was flawed. And there's some stuff that really needs attention. So we're going to be adjusting pricing on some items that were just not price, right. So we're going to try to adjust our pricing to where we are happy to sell everything. Right, Michael? That differently?

Speaker 3  53:59
That's a super good answer. It's less than explain. Like maybe maybe the delivery drivers hate the extra large buildings, maybe there's a certain time that the facility itself doesn't want to produce because it's got too many parts or complex angles are only kind of making this up. But is there anything like that? Or it's all very, very much the same?

Unknown Speaker  54:24
Go ahead on that one. Like I've talked enough.

Speaker 6  54:30
You're just specifically asking is there even if it was profitable? Is there anything you just hate to do? Is that is that was that the question?

Speaker 3  54:37
That you could you could answer it negative or positive. So either a particular kind that somebody in the company does not want to make those or other way around. There's one that is just like it's so good. So good for everybody that's model kind or size that you really want to move a lot of.

Speaker 6  54:55
There has been there's been a couple of models that we've done and they were sort of a little classified a little bit as loss leaders and they could have been classified is maybe not the most sought after thing to build by the shop would have been like our Playhouse, there's a lot of intricate details going into a lot of labor. And at the end of the day, what to get done? It's just a little late, but 12 You know, so to gables comment, you know, reviewing all of this and making sure it actually does make sense is what we need to do. And planning to do but specifically, yes, probably dancer that probably that would be like the one thing that you know, has been maybe not most exciting thing to show up in the shop like the guy is man. Great. You know, jumping up and down. We got to play house today. Doesn't really

Speaker 1  55:56
to be crystal clear. I mean, you're still happy to you're still happy to sell one. Just to just to put that out there. They're just not not the favorites to lean on.

Unknown Speaker  56:05
We are all right yesterday.

Speaker 2  56:08
Good. Oh, yesterday, the guy here the shop sold the building $15,000 building had locks guard on the floor perma guard on the walls lead guard on the roof. And that would be the the dream sale? Let's do more of that.

Speaker 3  56:30
Okay. But that answers. All right. Let's shift gears a little bit. So I'm gonna ask a few questions. And these are all in the context of sales conversation. So when when the sales team is talking to the lead prospect, I want to hear I want to hear the negative stuff. So the objections things that clients are skeptical about, maybe they don't like, again, I don't want to feed the words. But of course price for almost any company price is usually the top number one objection. But there's usually other stuff too. They don't like the wait time or they or they don't like that they you know, aren't more involved in the design process or whatever. I don't want to put words in your mouth. But I want to hear everything you can think of where when you're trying to sell. The customer says, Well, I don't know. Let me think about it. Because right and I want to know all the because you think of

Speaker 3  57:36
the one thing I won't believe is that a salesman has not run into objections. Surely you get them every day. Dave, Matthias, you and I are in the wrong business. They don't have any objections?

Speaker 2  57:53
Well, you, you just took it out of all of our mouths, the price, the price, the price. It's always I'm not a salesperson. So I should be quiet. But I'm pretty sure that I mean, our sheds. Generally, people don't complain about it's junky or it's too big or too small, because we have all sizes.

Speaker 1  58:23
And gave I'd like to confirm that by making into a direct question. Is it universally assumed by the customers that the quality is good? I mean, is there any selling to be done on that front? Or is it you know, generally assumed that the quality is top notch from the customers?

Speaker 2  58:49
I shouldn't be talking too much because I'm not a salesperson. I think it's important that we that we talk about the details. Like I think that's what makes people realize our quality is to talk about the the lifeguard on the floor, otherwise they wouldn't know. Like when I go to buy a new kitchen range. I have no idea what questions that should be asking. But I think I'm getting away from so what are objections? I think the main reason people do object about the price is because they don't understand what they're getting. And how that is different from the shed down the street. whose price is actually 5% less.

Speaker 5  59:55
That is very true. I'm gonna weigh in here just a moment. This is Marcus again On the sheds that are presented to people, one thing I have found that that's really a clincher is that when you're standing inside of the shed, you tell them the floor that we're standing on the 50th floor. The other guys, a lot of them use plywood, you do not want that. And that really resonates with people, because that's the very foundation of the building. And I explained to them that humidity can get underneath the plywood. And in six or eight years, it can be going rotted out. And when you tell them that they forget about the price

Speaker 3  1:00:33
that mastic Yes, that's really good. Anything else like that that you can think of?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
That's my second favorite market spray so far.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
Yeah, that's five gold stars.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
Thank you for sharing that. What's the most? What's the favorite?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:54
I'm not trying to comb my hair here.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
Keep coming. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:01:03
Seriously, anything else like that? So it's, this is good. So it sounds to me like you guys. So so funny enough. My next question was going to be like, and what do you do to either head those objections off at the pass? Or answer them when they come up? It sounds like you guys do quite a lot to make sure the objections don't come up in the first place. And that's really good. But just realize that none of us marketing guys are shed builders, and we're not there with you. So I would have never guessed the humidity and the floor issue. That's amazing. What else? Anything structural design quality materials, what else do you guys say to customers that you know, are removing objections from their mind like that.

Speaker 1  1:01:50
And just just add into that these are 14 on center, correct the sheds.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
You're probably the engine fix. Use 16 on center.

Speaker 1  1:02:11
Okay. And that is that is the household standard. If I remember right, I just got it wrong when it is working.

Speaker 6  1:02:18
Okay, 16 inch standard. Yes. Now, for the cheaper ones. You will see 24 inch on center in the cheaper like sheds a lot of times, and sometimes in the really, really cheap ones where they just do you know a Jinxi metal skin in the outside and a couple says the inside you'll see four foot on center. So that's 16 inch centers, standard floor sidewalls and your roof. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:02:46
There when you said the cheaper ones, you mean you don't mean the bottom end of the tree point line you mean the competitors who are doing a poor quality job right.

Speaker 6  1:02:56
You do not do any for food and center, we do have a little line that we do not utilize much that is a 24 inch and center that we had implemented a while ago, but don't utilize it much at all. One of the little phrases I just love to talk about on our metal is that designer metal is getting help the customer understand what he's getting when he does the building with our designer metal exterior that he can't find anywhere else. Our panel, the metal is shaped in the profile of a wood panel. And you get the maintenance free aspect of it with the look of it. So the exterior, it looks like a piece of furniture grade stained wood, but you marry maintenance free with the look of wood. And that helps usually to resonate with the customers the value that they're getting. So typically when you say I want a wood exterior, you acknowledge that you wit that you'll get maintenance. And typically in buying a metal shed you get the less than great look. Usually it's sort of an ugly shed. Easy, cuddly shed. So marrying the two together. Well, you get the best of both worlds. And that seems to resonate. Well. Super good.

Speaker 2  1:04:38
Another thing that I like is the leak guard. So the leak guard is a roof without holes. So selling a roof without holes is the easiest thing in the world. So if there was a way I'm not a salesman, I don't do marketing. You know, I just do humdrum stuff and little office. But if there was a way to sell people on the roof, it seems like selling the shed underneath it would be easy. Because the dumbest thing you can ever do is put holes in your roof. So we like to tell people would you put a screw in the bottom your bathtub? I may say when No, yeah, but with a washer on it? Well, of course not. I mean, even leak one day. Exactly. So what makes us think it's a smart idea to put screws in your roof. If I was Noah Webster and I was creating a dictionary. And I was drawing a little picture right beside the word stupidity, I would put pictures of people putting holes in the roof. I don't think that's something to use. But just getting people to understand that the roof is what protects your building. And you shouldn't want holes in it that are just protected with a little piece of rubber. And if that screw goes crooked, it's gonna leak. If that screws put in too hard, it's gonna leak. If it's not put in deep enough, it's gonna leak. And even if you put it in perfectly, it'll back out one day. But if we can somehow put fear into people of having a roof that's gonna leak one day.

Speaker 1  1:06:25
I love it. I just want to say out loud, I just want to say out loud to everybody. The true leak, leak guard and term regard are are my front and center. Copy tools. Like I'm going to be all over those three things in the letters. Because for what I'm taking from this call is there's a lot of stuff that that isn't a surprise. But these those three things. Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna come on pretty strong with those just so everybody knows.

Speaker 3  1:06:56
I agree. That's amazing. In fact, you've got me super curious now. So actually tell me a little bit. And I know I can get details from the dice and some other posts later. But just real quick, what is the leaf guard? So it's it's a no screw method of doing a roof. They just helped me understand this a little bit better.

Speaker 2  1:07:17
Sure. So it's lead. Guard. I thought I heard you say leaf guard. But it's a we instead of putting screws into the roof with a with a washer, a rubber washer, we put clips, you could maybe go to Elite Guard pro.com and see some pictures of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:39
Yeah, but I'm sure find out.

Speaker 2  1:07:41
Yeah, it's a it's just a clip system. Instead of putting screws through the roof, you put like a big ol washer on top of the rib and screw through the washer. And then there's a cap that clips over the washers, and covers all your screws.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00
On it. Look at more actual info. That's super helpful though.

Speaker 2  1:08:05
The other sarcastic thing I use sometimes, is I tell if I tell people that weak art is not for everybody. You know, if you live in this era, or in Death Valley, it would be a foolish investment because it doesn't rain, it only makes sense where it rains. Because that's the only place that roofs leak is where it rains. And then people usually laugh and it's fun, but I don't know how much it really tells

Speaker 1  1:08:38
gave I'm gonna say it out loud, meaning you can be friends, I've decided.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
That's great. It's good stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
Leaking link in the message for the leak guard.

Speaker 7  1:08:56
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have a customer so I'm gonna have to go.

Speaker 6  1:09:01
Sounds good. Thank you for your help. Thank you so much. Bye, bye. Bye. Bye. Oh, go ahead. Thank me, maybe expounding just a little bit on the wildcard here would maybe be fitting since we're talking about LeakGuard and talking about the Designer Series extra metal as well. Should we expand on that just a little bit real quickly might work well to fit into this conversation.

Speaker 1  1:09:32
And is that is that known as perma guard or the other one? Or is that a different feature? Lux guard thermal guard or leak guard is that what the metal guard is is

Speaker 6  1:09:45
Lux guard is our rubber flooring that we put on the floor. So this is another one that we really like to sell on. So instead of the typical shed and just putting, you know, plywood on the floor shooting at 1000 holes in it, and it has cracks and holes. And you know selling the shed is you know the floor with a great looking floor. We put this rubber flooring on top. So seamless, waterproof, diamond plated look, you can clean it, actually, you can wash it, there's no holes, and there's no exposed edges, so it goes down before the wall gets set. So if you think about it, moisture coming in the shed, you're going to bring in water that that makes stains and water create a smell when it absorbs into wood. So resale value, it also hurts to resolve a bad so now you can clean yours actually clean your shed and the resale values it stays there and there's no add smell there oil leaks, you can just wipe them up. So totally revolutionize revolutionizes the way that you look at shed floors. So and again very unique to us and what we do. So explaining some of these things to the customer becomes a no brainer. So we have this little this little display chart that we have sitting like on a desk when we talk about it. And it shows the upgrades from plywood to that floor with that with that rubber floor on top and it becomes a no brainer. So again, those three things, let's guard it, here's talking about Lux guard, Elite Guard and perma guard. Those are the

Speaker 1  1:11:47
I'm sorry, I wouldn't mind a photo of that brochure when you get a sack.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:52
Same here. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
Allergy have that in the file that you could send

Speaker 4  1:12:00
it you're talking about those three products. I just put, I put three links in the message that'll take them right to the websites. And I can I can get the files as well if you want me to.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:18
Yeah. I get it from the site.

Speaker 3  1:12:25
Thanks. Yeah, we can. Thanks for that. And we will we'll look up more details on the products themselves. Thigh as you want to ask some of your questions there.

Matthias Miller  1:12:34
Yeah. Two questions. These are kind of sub points under that, but I know that it's come up before one was, if I don't know if you guys want to talk about the magnetic doorstop. And and to me it talks about the attention to detail and user friendliness. But do you guys do you guys actually use that ever in your in your selling and if so, I mean, you might even explain what it is and and if you do use it, you're selling how you use it. Is that not a big deal?

Speaker 6  1:13:04
It is people really like that. So it's a very simple, small little system. But it's so works so well. And it's basic there, it's just you know, there's virtually nothing wrong with it. And it's just a strong magnet. So it's a good selling point, especially when you're doing like talking to an older person that doesn't want the door swing in their faces or trying to get the lumber out. So you just open the door and the magnet just it's there's just a magnet magnetic tat so it catches and so doing a little demonstration on it is always very effective. As you walk the lodge during the showing. If you're doing an in person showing this customer a shed, you open the door, and you can be pretty strategic about it, open that door and let it nap that quick. It's a lot of pretty decent little snap because it has a strong magnet. And so showing that customer how easy that works. But it's so it's so straightforward. Simplex, you just grabbed the door open and it automatically latches and then closing it, just grab it and shut it. So it has become very, very, it's such a small thing, but it's very everybody, everybody can find a value can find value in it. So it's pretty much across the board has been a very strong appeal. Mark is that are Kelvin, you probably have being out there talking to this. Well, people you have any feedback on that?

Speaker 5  1:14:32
Yes, that is a very important detail. You always want a lot with the person and you walk in front of them not to be rude, but you go out and grab that door. And you say hey, look at this. This is a really neat feature. And it really resonates with people because that's something that they can use.

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
And then am I understanding correctly this is this is something that you've actually gone through some significant process to figure out how to make this work and it's not Something that's I mean, if there is anything somewhat similar to this, you guys are certainly superior to competitors. And in this little detail

Speaker 6  1:15:13
it is. So it's not something that's we put together this little, this little deal by ourselves. So it's not like something that's really available where you can just call them but some company and supplier and ship these in and get started. So we buy all these little parts separately and then put them together so so it is unique as well. So again, shopping down the street is not something that these are readily found at all.

Speaker 2  1:15:48
I know you're probably tired of listening to my disclaimers, you know, I'm not a salesperson, you know, I don't do marketing. I don't get all that. But it seems to me like, like, maybe an effective strategy would be all these little things that we're talking about. Like we kind of believe that's what separates us is the attention to detail is the week or the logo or the perimeter or the magnets, there's six other things like that is, would it be helpful if we somehow created some, maybe a quick little video demonstrating each one and somehow getting people as soon as they come to the website or look at the ad or whatever? Show it to him? I mean, our experience, if someone shows up at a lot here, he shows these things to them. We don't even need to sell it to him. If we show it to them. They buy it. It's really that easy.

Speaker 1  1:16:51
Right about it too. Yeah. For sure. Jonathan. Jonathan, I want to I want to because I'm looking at our time and I don't know if we're gonna get cut off from the call. I do want to go over the origin story section because I'll get a lot of I'll get a lot of weight out of that. A lot of help.

Speaker 3  1:17:09
Yes, sir. It is literally the next question. Other than Matthias hopefully, you had some thoughts about the quality of the lumber, European lumber. Is that worth diving into just a little more? I like your spouse objections question as well. Can we run through those quick?

Matthias Miller  1:17:26
I mean, I think I think it's up to you guys. I don't I don't know how to prioritize I sidenote, I think we're getting tremendous value from this. And I think if, if Alex and Tom and Jonathan are open to this, and if they're getting as much value as I perceive, we may need to schedule a follow up and dig deeper. This is like fantastic. This is the infrastructure that we were talking about building out and getting all this stuff stuff laid out. Yeah. So

Speaker 3  1:17:55
for myself, I literally have all day and I can also schedule another time so it's up to the rest of you. And this is super helpful. Yes, sir. Oh, you

Speaker 9  1:18:05
guys are sharing with us is absolute gold. If you guys need to reschedule call I am open for that too. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
I have I have about another

Unknown Speaker  1:18:13
30 minutes.

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
Time How much time do you have?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:19
Oh, um, I'm good. I got I got time.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:25
Still until somebody runs out of steam sound. Alright. Sounds good. Yeah, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:18:32
Jonathan. You want me to roll with those questions or you want to catch some other things?

Speaker 3  1:18:35
Let's let's do a real break real quickly. Yes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:18:38
So this is I also I believe at some point but I know you guys talked about the European special lumber that you use it doesn't work or something like that. You guys touched on like again is that a selling point? And if so, how do you guys talk about it

Speaker 2  1:18:54
many years ago we started buying European lumber and it is the cleanest best stuff in the world but so my dad this was way back said man I'm gonna use this as a sales pitch so the next time a customer showed up he said you know we try to do use the best materials and and we try to you know, we even leave us European lumber and the guy said you should use American lumber you're not impressed so we've never mentioned it since then.

Speaker 6  1:19:28
Specifically European we don't mention we do mention the clean lumber for sure. So we say you know Wayne free lumber so we don't use any lumber that has a bark on it. So clean appearance we pay we pay for premium lumber and everything is really really really nice. So we do focus on that between just avoid seeing European because yeah,

Speaker 1  1:19:55
I can see that. I can see that turning some people on some off. So yeah, I agree. They're what they do.

Speaker 6  1:20:04
All right, the one thing that makes it different that they the Europeans got their cut their wood out of trees that are maybe three foot in diameter, where a lot of domestic were being cut off of trees that or maybe, you know, eight or 10 inches in diameter. So you get a lot of core wood in domestic wood, where these European lumber, you don't have core wood, so they're a lot straighter. So really clean, nice, straight lumber. So when you walk in, you get a totally different feel, man, if you do from a shed that somebody's using, you know, lesser grade lumber that has scabs or has bark on it, or it looks like totally, completely different feel.

Speaker 1  1:20:52
Yeah, I'm liking the term old growth, old growth, large lumber. And I think I liked that three foot measure in the copy as well.

Matthias Miller  1:21:03
Mike, you said it's something free? What was that word? Lumber.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
Wayne,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
that's the term for no bark. Wayne, free

Matthias Miller  1:21:15
waiting free. No bark. And then there's also somebody

Speaker 2  1:21:17
and not not Wayne like John Wayne, w a n e. Perfect. No,

Matthias Miller  1:21:28
I can't remember this is a conversation with Eric Are you guys? But do you guys do anything special? I know, with some companies, there's something special about the cut of wood that you use for your runners? Whether it comes from the inside or the edge of the tree or something like that? Is that something? Am I just making something up? Or is that something you guys do?

Speaker 2  1:21:49
Before before, they are the center of the tree, I don't know that I would necessarily brag about it. Because that's technically the worst part of the tree. Okay, maybe people don't know that we use the heart of the trees for the form of floors. That would be the truth. If we can, you might impress some people, but it is

Speaker 6  1:22:10
pressure treated, we get the good focus on that is is all pressure treated, that's the focal point. That's critical. So for weather resistance because it is close to the ground. So pressure treated lumber, that's the key point you want to be pointing out if you want to point something out, and both the four befores and all of the all of the floor joists, they are all pressure treated

Matthias Miller  1:22:35
here, but that's not necessarily something that's unique to or is it something that's strictly unique to truepoint?

Speaker 6  1:22:45
Not necessarily. That's pretty standard.

Matthias Miller  1:22:49
Yeah. Okay. Then. One other question I had is spouse objections. Do you guys when you're selling? Do you run into spouse objections? You know, I have to talk to my wife, I have to talk to my husband and if so, so anything you say beforehand to address it or anything you do when it comes up?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11
Mark is or Kelvin? Do

Unknown Speaker  1:23:12
you see that?

Speaker 5  1:23:13
I run into that all the time. And the way I handle it. Different ways. Depends who the person is, of course, that I'll say, Look, you go and say this. Today, I'll throw this or that in like a magnet, a free magnet or a solar light. And yeah, it'll be worth your time to sign up today. A lot of times they'll do it. And then try to talk to your spouse and do it afterwards. Yesterday guy came in and spent $15,000 That did not talk to his wife. He said well, he said I'll probably be in the doghouse. I said we will have a really nice building to stay in

Unknown Speaker  1:24:00
is good? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:04
Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:24:08
Just to just add on to that real quick, Jonathan. Yeah, how how often do you hear that? How often is the I gotta talk to my wife excuse brought out in a close

Unknown Speaker  1:24:23
or Yes, like Marcus said it's all the time.

Speaker 1  1:24:26
All the time. Okay. Yeah, I can write I can write against that in the emails little bit so we can alleviate that touch. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:24:38
Okay. All right, let's, let's shift gears to some open ended stuff. So this is like telling me a storytime again. Okay. How did you guys get started like, like, someday sometime? Somebody started a company called tree point what? What happened?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
gave you an answer that one?

Speaker 2  1:25:06
Yep. This is not, you know, nevermind the disclaimers, I do that all the time. This is just talk. So write these words down. I don't know how far back you want to go. But way back when the world was still young in 1999, my dad wanted to do something with make them work for his boys. And so he said, Let's build kids. So we went out underneath the shade tree. And started building a few sheds. We had like a little saw with a, and when it ran, when it rained, we ran in the house. And when it didn't rain, we ran back out and rebuild a few sheds. That was a neck and then and I and this is so that was 2322 or 2323 years ago, I guess. And I mean, it's been pretty boring. The story is pretty boring. Because we just build kids. And we build a shop, to build sheds in and then we built another shop to build sheds in and then we built another shop for warehouse. And we just kept building shares and trying to improve them. I mean, kind of a focus has been attention to detail. And like we're continuously trying to improve upon our design. Like we believe it's what really matters is the customer's experience with the shed. And that's a really boring story. You think

Speaker 1  1:27:14
that story is that story is as good as it gets gave? I am dead serious. That story is straight up. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:27
I've started doing marketing. And like, how could it get more boring than that?

Speaker 1  1:27:37
I've had I've had slightly different adventures in life. But when people want to buy sheds, they want a boring shed built by a guy who likes to build sheds. He got it. It's it's good. I can do a lot with that.

Speaker 2  1:27:49
Yeah, actually, I wouldn't make a case out of how boring it is like, like that's, you know, we get up in the morning and we go build chips. And that's what yeah, you know, gets our blood pumping is getting up in the morning running out like we can actually now if it rains, we can actually keep building shares. So building a shot was a big improvement. We can keep doing what we like. But the the the continuous improvement thing is that if our sheds are not better this year than they were last year we're unhappy.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:23
Right? We could do a lot with that

Speaker 2  1:28:28
you could do something with I mean, there's there's We come from a family of six brothers and all six of us brothers are in the shed business I mean, we're ages 39 down to 23 I can give you the names of the boys if that helps. And you want the names that would please Sorry I didn't understand you want to read don't want to Yes. So as Gabriel Michael you already have those. And then there's Shannon Jesse Evangel. And Andre a n d r e. And you could put something in there about how well we get along we always always just smile at each other and everything that everybody says the rest of us all two thumbs up. That's a joke.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:42
As long as eight on top.

Speaker 1  1:29:47
Now gave I know it's bad manners, but because I'm writing in your voice. Do you mind me asking what? How old you are? Personally

Unknown Speaker  1:29:56
39 I'm the old nine.

Speaker 1  1:29:58
Okay. that that helps me a lot because I spent a little time in Shipshewana, Indiana, and most of the guys, most of the Amish guys, I know they're little on the older side. So that helps me adjust the adjusted voice a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:17
Oh, really? How did that? I don't I don't get it.

Speaker 1  1:30:21
Oh well, yeah, we haven't met. We haven't met before Gabe. And I didn't know how old you were. So I was writing you as a couple years older than you are. That's a good thing to know.

Speaker 2  1:30:37
I mean, you could talk about we all live within maybe four or five miles of the business here. You know, it's kind of family people kind of like local family what else are some little details?

Matthias Miller  1:31:00
Oh, here's a good here's a good story. You're on this conference call earlier today. And your boys are running around the shop. Doing stuff. I don't know if you want to talk about what they were up to today.

Speaker 2  1:31:19
Yeah, I mean, the little boys come in and they do little jobs like like, put our catalogs together they glue or catalogs together the little boys. ages seven through 12 That's what they do. They take out the trash they just run around here and do things that are safe for little boys to do. Clearly there's some fun stories. Did nothing fun ever happened here? We never had a fire. We never

Speaker 3  1:32:01
won about a crazy customer or like a shed that everything went wrong or anything like that, that, you know, maybe it was a little painful to experience. But it's funny afterwards, right said fell off the truck like your delivery good or something? You think of anything like that?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:19
Have you got one of those, Mike? Well, I think

Speaker 6  1:32:25
about the LEA Winkler one, we did have one that was just all out. Crazy. There's this, there's this woman that bought a spotter shed from us. And then she put dogs in it. And there was maybe 20 dogs in this one shed. And she let them go in and out. And she bought one with vinyl exterior. And then they would chew it up, just chew up the building. And they would put all their paws on the white vinyl. And then she would call us and tell us to come back out and fix her shed because it's orange. And you know, they're tuned it up so and she's not going to pay unless we come fix her head. So she kept on like pushing us off for a month a month. She's not paying because it's not right. And then the dogs keep chewing so it was sort of a no win situation there just a little bit.

Speaker 2  1:33:24
We had another interest that that was the most difficult one. And then we had the most crooked one. I don't think this is something to be bragging about. But we had a guy that in a busy season we delivered a shed to in the guy that was delivering sheds. Had a it was really rainy. So between rainstorms. One guy would run around with the truck and just dump the sheds in people's backyards. And then another guy would come behind him with a with a regular truck and set him up with like a jack. And the one thought the other had collected the money and the other thought the other had collected the money and they took off. And we dropped the ball so bad that it went about three months until we discovered this go ahead and pay so we call them up and he said oh yeah, I paid him cash. Yeah, them guys. They looked a little sleazy. Yeah. And he sent us an invoice that showed you know, he went to Staples and bought one of those rubber stamps that said paid and he popped it on his invoice and he faxed it to us look at pay cash. He doesn't guys look little sleazy. And he literally just didn't pay. And he even said, Yeah, the one they've gone guy that looks sleazy. I handed him a beer when we were done, gave him the money in a beer and he took off. Well, that guy never touched a beer in his lifetime and he never will. But then we, you know, turn the other cheek and gave him his cloak also, actually, we didn't give him anything but we said okay, so that would get people's attention. But I don't know, necessarily what to tell people that because there wouldn't be so many people listening, we'd think of a whole bunch of.

Speaker 3  1:35:17
So here's an idea. If you do think of some later, please write them down, send him over to Matthias, and he can get them to us. Because chances are good that will hang up. And then later this evening, you'll think of Oh, yeah, there was that time that some of you mentioned seasonality. Tell us about that. When When do you sell the most when it things speed up when things slow down? The

Speaker 2  1:35:48
busiest is March, April, May and June.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:57
Slowest

Speaker 2  1:35:58
is is a toss up between December January and February and July and August. And then in the middle becomes September, October and November.

Speaker 3  1:36:24
I'm on average to tell him about the sales cycle like on average from the time you first speak with someone so over the phone or on the lot. How long from then until they typically close and pay.

Speaker 2  1:36:43
That's definitely going to be a salesperson question. I have no clue.

Speaker 1  1:36:47
And I would like to add, I would like to add to the question. So how long between the time they fill out by the time you get a lead? And when there's a phone call? And when there's a shed sold? So I want to add the lead at the very beginning of that question.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:04
Marcus Kelvin, what are you talking to that one? You do it every day? Well?

Speaker 5  1:37:14
So far, that's a very, that's a very difficult question to answer. From the standpoint that can vary a lot. There are people who have decided to go ahead and buy a shed, they inquire and they buy, then there's others who come and inquire. And maybe it's a little more than what they thought it might be a little different. And they have to plan for it. I've seen it go for as long as six months here. That's been the longest, I've seen it usually in three to four weeks. Again, I can decide and get his his finances lined up to where he can go ahead and make an order. And of course the cash customers they buy right away.

Speaker 6  1:38:00
So is there a difference? Mark is is there a difference between your people that arrive in the lot and your online leads?

Matthias Miller  1:38:12
I think we just lost Marcus

Unknown Speaker  1:38:16
said that.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:19
You do you have feedback?

Speaker 5  1:38:22
Yeah, it's very similar. It just vary so much. I've got you know, like you said you have some cash people that come in, and, and they can pick out what they want and pay for it right away. I've had that happen several times. And the other hand, you've got people that that just you know, they can't make up their mind. I've got one guy I've sent him probably a half a dozen quotes on different configurations. And he still hasn't made a decision. So yeah, it just, it varies quite a bit.

Matthias Miller  1:39:01
We lost you there. Do you have anything else to add?

Speaker 5  1:39:07
I'm sorry, I accidentally dropped out for a moment and I had to come back so I'm disappointed.

Speaker 3  1:39:17
So okay, and I did take notes, but I'm a little lost. So let's try this again. So we're going to divide it into two halves. So from the time a lead first comes in to the time that somebody speaks with them or gets them on the lot. How long is that interval usually?

Speaker 5  1:39:37
Well, I'm going to answer I'm going to take an average year, anywhere from three to six weeks.

Speaker 3  1:39:44
What happens during that three to six weeks, so that is between lead and the time you're speaking with

Speaker 5  1:39:50
them? No, there is your immediate contact and if you had deleted okay and you've made a contact with him, you've set them up Rice, and then they have to talk to their spouse, they have to talk to their son and their grandfather grandmother, the whole family sometimes. And then they're thinking about the Yeah, yeah, these people that are very detailed, so and they are perfectionist. And so they're trying to make sure that no mistake is going to be made, and they're going to take their time. And then you have others who are more direct, and they drive on the lot. And they drive on very fast, they run up the steps, they're on a mission and they are ready to buy in you can pretty much guess, by the way they conduct themselves as they're entering the lot. I have a buzzer outlined the road whenever a vehicle interests a lot. Because where my office is located, it's hid from the entrance in I can't see. So I'm relatedly go out to the front door and see what's going on. And a lot of times that block out by the office here, and then they'll just jump out and walk out and start looking at buildings immediately I go out, but generally speaking, people come through the lot because they're on a mission. And yes, it just takes a little bit of time varies greatly.

Speaker 3  1:41:20
Okay, and it just helped me understand a little bit better what's going on when you said it was three to six weeks. I'm just a little lost on what that is measuring time from what.

Speaker 5  1:41:29
Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an example. If you that's kind of an average don't if they don't buy today, they will usually come back and they may not come back right away because maybe they have a busy schedule. Maybe they're not that pressed to do something. And they'll let it run. People are procrastinators, some of them are so you keep calling them and staying in touch. And they always thank you. He's like thank you know, you feel like maybe sometimes you being a pest that people don't
