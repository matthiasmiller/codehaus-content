Unknown Speaker  02:59
on there are We there? Hey,

Unknown Speaker  03:02
yes, we are.

Unknown Speaker  03:04
No, look at this.

Speaker 1  03:06
Show me that. Look at that. Net pie. I

Unknown Speaker  03:14
don't know if I've had that.

Speaker 2  03:16
If you ever want to go climb a 14 or this will get you up the last 1000 feet.

Unknown Speaker  03:23
I love it.

Speaker 2  03:26
It's it's for altitude. It wards off altitude sickness and all that. No headache, just good old Amish sniff pie. I don't know it's like Amish cocaine or something

Unknown Speaker  03:47
that's awesome. There we

Unknown Speaker  03:49
go. George, Here, hold on.

Unknown Speaker  03:52
Oh, man, I

Matthias Miller  03:55
gotta turn my phone off and see your text or turn it on

Speaker 1  04:02
the Let's go.

Speaker 2  04:10
I gotta wake some people up. Man, it's Friday around here. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
Let's go. Go.

Unknown Speaker  04:17
Now he was over here. He just went back because he's in the middle. Stuff too.

Matthias Miller  04:25
Oh, man, I love low key and chill people, but they don't always move fast. So

Speaker 2  04:30
yeah, no, right. Me too. Um, so question before we get here, because we is there any progress on the production tracker and score calculator stuff. No,

Matthias Miller  04:45
I've been hoping to focus on that. I knew that was a priority for May, so I was hoping to focus on that pretty hard next week, if I can. Alright. So, yep, yep, yep. Sounds good. You.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
There he is. Hey, the

Unknown Speaker  05:08
man himself. Well, hello there,

Unknown Speaker  05:10
the big cheese. Big Cheese.

Unknown Speaker  05:13
I love it.

Unknown Speaker  05:15
He's a Packers fan too.

Unknown Speaker  05:20
Nice. He's

Unknown Speaker  05:21
my lead blocker, too. I

Unknown Speaker  05:27
like it, Matt, what are we doing today? All right,

Matthias Miller  05:30
here's what we're doing. I don't know if I don't know it's best for me to share, you to share, but I want to pick up right where we left off last time and see if hang up, see if we're any closer to where we need to be. I mean, I hope we are on the on the Cutlass stuff. Maybe I let's we can start. We can start over here. Let me see if I can pull up. Pull this up a little bit. I

Matthias Miller  06:25
All right, so I blanked out the waste percentage on some of that that you had.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Sorry about that noise.

Matthias Miller  06:37
It's not coming through, so I don't know what you're doing, but Okay, so, so we still have the waste percentage on the size or cut list. We now have the raw material quantity that you can, that you can put on, put on here. We also had, let's go back to these items that we were messing with.

Speaker 2  07:03
Matt, I have a volume all the way up. I can hear you, but not super great. Sorry, we don't have a great we've our conference room is not sound proof. Got it? Unfortunately, it's okay, but it's

Unknown Speaker  07:24
there's just a dull background

Unknown Speaker  07:28
noise, palm or whatever from most

Matthias Miller  07:32
well, I'll practice my my packers coach, yelling. Voice, how's that?

Speaker 2  07:37
Verbal? Yeah. Vince. Vince Lombardi, um, there you go. Verbal, or, yeah, voice, trajectory,

Matthias Miller  07:46
there you go. Practice my projection. Here we go. Alright, so, so added a decimal point to the quantity. Here. I can't, I can't remember specifically if this was, was this the one that needed to be split? Right? And so we checked the split box. So if you look up here at the board feet, it says point five, we hit split, and it drops down to point two, five and and so thickness, width and length are still one, 612, but, but board feet in half, makes sense, right? And then the other one we were looking at was,

Speaker 3  08:34
what was it? MX, 10, I think that

Matthias Miller  08:38
sounds about right. I Oh, oops. And then what did we want to do on we needed to have a do we needed a fractional quantity or something.

Speaker 2  08:53
Yeah, because that's layers. 40 inches is one layer. So yeah, we need 1.5 of the half by 40 by 48 Okay,

Matthias Miller  09:06
alright, so now we got decimals on that.

Speaker 3  09:13
So do you have us? Oh, yeah, there's, you have a split box there too.

Matthias Miller  09:17
Does that? Do any of these need to be split?

Speaker 3  09:21
Just the top one, the top cell and the third cell need to be split, alright,

Matthias Miller  09:31
so that takes your board feed down to little over 12, alright,

Speaker 3  09:38
yeah, so you're saying, Matt, that split box will be in everything for the sewing end.

Matthias Miller  09:46
It will be on the, well, we're not showing it on the sewing cut list, but we are showing it here for board feet calculations. If we need it elsewhere, we can, we can look at that.

Speaker 3  10:01
Uh, yeah, cuz it's gonna have to be. I mean, it's here for this, this, what all I say, what word am I looking for, for this application, but for the soul list, it's gonna have to somehow be, that's what I was saying. If I put, if Tina puts sage in a say she's putting five pallets in there, and I'm cutting one inch and splitting it, making two layers. It's got to make, it's got to have a breakdown to

Unknown Speaker  10:31
a den or

Speaker 3  10:40
because if she puts five or she puts five pallets in for a mix 10 and I split one inch random, it's going to give me enough for 1010, pallets instead of five.

Matthias Miller  10:52
Okay, so we do have the raw material quantity on the sizer, but that's not what you're after,

Speaker 2  11:02
yeah, but she, what are you saying? If she puts in one inch, what were you saying?

Speaker 3  11:07
Oh, she puts, if she puts her sage order in his four is five MX 10, right? And then it comes to this, and it's torn for, say, it's calling for one letter of half 40 by 48 now, if she puts it as five,

Speaker 4  11:23
and I do want to show two and a half layers. Gotta show one inch on. Yeah, we talked about that on the

Unknown Speaker  11:34
phone.

Speaker 2  11:38
Trucking thing. Let me find this. George, you're good, Matt, so he I know what he's saying. Um, he's talking about the raw material quantity for the sizer. So your raw material. Do you see my hand? I can't, no, uh, okay, well, sorry, I'm on the Hey on the screen anyway, using my mouse, but raw material info, sawing is one inch by random width. Um, miscellaneous prep split half inch. So he's concerned about his quantity for the sizer to be accurate, based on it getting split half inch. So if we're calling for five of these in the say we're calling for five in the order, what? What are we telling the size or as a quantity? Now?

Matthias Miller  12:41
Well, what should it be for five?

Speaker 2  12:46
Well times one point So, five times so 7.5 layers, half of 40 to 48 and if we're taking it, if we're taking one inch as the raw material, then it should only take 3.75 layers of one inch,

Unknown Speaker  13:12
right? Or so sorry.

Speaker 1  13:16
So go ahead. No. Go ahead. Matt.

Matthias Miller  13:21
Okay, so just to make sure we're clear all the way at the end, we get one, one and a half layers of half by 40 by 48 Right, right. Okay. And then going into it, you said 3.75 for five. So that means it's point seven, five for each

Speaker 2  13:39
let's just keep it with let's just stick with one, right? So one? How many layers? Because the raw material for the half inch is a one inch. So we're going to get two layers, two out of one. We're splitting one inch. So that means we should only need, point seven, five layers of raw material at one inch count,

Matthias Miller  14:08
okay, but then here, yeah, this is, don't we need a I mean, if we're splitting it, don't we need a multiplier.

Unknown Speaker  14:22
But you have it right there. It's point seven, five,

Matthias Miller  14:27
but it's split in it's split in sawing, not in sizing, right? Well, but that's, well, I guess both. We said it in both, yeah, it's fine,

Speaker 2  14:36
exactly it's getting so that answers your question. Not George, yeah, you already have the point seven, five there. The L M is the the L M is where we need to cut the one inch to length. And then that one inch, well that's good, is the raw material for the splitter. And it gets, yeah, exactly. This

Matthias Miller  15:03
guy's this. This guy's the guy who's splitting it. And so saw two doubles the quantity. So that means so

Speaker 2  15:10
one and, yeah, both, both before that shows it as not split, which is right, right. Yeah, right. You got it.

Unknown Speaker  15:21
And then,

Speaker 2  15:23
well, there is no sizer on this application,

Unknown Speaker  15:29
so forget, right,

Matthias Miller  15:30
yeah, oh, right, we don't need that. So I'm still confused about the split check box, because you're actually your board feet still is based on half by 40. I mean, by by three quarter, by 40, by 48 that's the board feet right.

Unknown Speaker  15:57
Now, what do you say by three quarter?

Matthias Miller  15:59
So it's one and a half times, times half by 40 by 48 right? That's the board fee. So the split, we actually don't need that split, because the split is for wedges, right?

Unknown Speaker  16:15
Sorry, yeah, this split is,

Matthias Miller  16:19
it really should be right

Speaker 2  16:21
that split, that split is for wages. We

Matthias Miller  16:26
need to change that, because that's confusing. Rename split to

Speaker 2  16:37
you're saying that the split column with the right after length, between length and raw material quantity, yeah. Does that need to be in there?

Matthias Miller  16:48
Well, we need it, sorry, we need it somewhere to say that. I mean, we should really rename it to something like wedges or something like that.

Speaker 2  17:00
Well, what? Yeah, what is that split? What is the purpose of those of that between length and raw material? What was it intended for?

Unknown Speaker  17:09
For,

Matthias Miller  17:10
for that you see one when you do in wedges,

Unknown Speaker  17:19
but that's you're showing it. You're showing it down below too.

Matthias Miller  17:26
Yeah, it's the same thing. It's all of these up here are exactly the same things as down here. It's just making it easier to you. But, but this is okay. The reason for okay because there's how to explain this. Splitting does two things. If you if you wedge it, then you still have, you still the finished product. You use the maximum thickness for the finished product. So the other, the other way to do this would be to say it's not just thickness, but it's it's thickness one and thickness two. So if it's, if it's a wedge over here, it's one inch to half inch.

Unknown Speaker  18:30
I'm not making sense.

Speaker 2  18:34
I understand, but it, it's the reality is, it's still split. It's just split across the corner instead of down the middle,

Matthias Miller  18:44
right. But it affects, it affects quantities, or board feet. Because here you can, you can say this is going to produce a one by six by 12, but because the but that's just, but it's actually not just That's it. That is not a full description of what's being produced. It's not actually a one inch the whole way across. It's one inch and half inch. So we can't now, and so that's where really, what we're saying is this is not an even thickness. We really should almost, yeah.

Speaker 2  19:27
Well, for the sawing side and the board foot side, it has the same effect. If we split wedges, or if we split one inch into even half inch pieces, it has the same effect and breakdown of the numbers. Um, if we want to identify that it's a wedge, we don't necessarily have to identify that it's a wedge other than an instruction saying single head band saw split wedges. Is, instead of taking it to the band the other band saw and splitting it down the middle,

Matthias Miller  20:07
okay, but then, but then, what you need to do is, you need to say we actually produce half of a one by six by 12, because it's a wedge,

Unknown Speaker  20:19
exactly. That is

Unknown Speaker  20:24
right, yeah,

Speaker 3  20:27
so say, if she would put an order in for 1440 is usually a bundle for them, wedges, Matt, yeah, if she generates 1440 in sage, and you have point five, there would that be? Like, you're going, what, 28, 80.5,

Matthias Miller  20:48
well, it would be, no, you would, you would output set 720, I mean, that's the, that's where it gets confusing. Because, right, right? It's,

Speaker 3  21:03
that's what, yeah, there's so many common denominators with the sawing, on the on the Excel that that's why I didn't, I never generated it, because there was so many, so many catches. But

Speaker 2  21:16
in reality, it is a half of a one by 612, so

Matthias Miller  21:20
right, but it's a but, but in terms of the finished product, it is one finished product. It's not half of a finished product. It's one, right?

Speaker 2  21:29
So do, how do we, what do we write in there then to say that,

Unknown Speaker  21:36
he said 720

Matthias Miller  21:38
so the way I handle it. Was saying, well, it is a one by six by 12 finished product. It is one one by six by 12 finished product, but half of it is missing, and it is it's half as dense as a one by six by 12. I mean, that was this way of handling it. The reason it's different, and we may actually need to take a look at this, is,

Speaker 2  22:07
well, the final the final dimension in reality, is a half by six by 12. That is the actual final dimension. Then you do have one full piece.

Matthias Miller  22:26
And then you just, because it's wedge, you just take the average. So we're just saying, when you put in wedges, just use the average thickness and right, and trust that they don't get confused somewhere because it's wedged right. Mm. Right?

Speaker 2  22:45
Yeah, it's a half by six by 12 count. So that keeps everything hanging right. I

Speaker 3  22:51
mean, the 1440 is always going to be, yeah, nominal. Get a customer. He wants a couple couple pieces of wedges, then it gets low. So when

Speaker 2  23:01
they but the thing is, the order is going to come in, it's going to say one by six by 12 wedge. What if, I mean, George just has to do be a little creative on the special instructions, probably,

Matthias Miller  23:16
I mean, on the on the miscellaneous prep. I I mean, it's, it's, it's one inch thickness, down to zero inch thickness, right? I don't know if that's how you want to say it. Sure. That's good. Okay, then, then does is Izzy, the the thing that splits it

Speaker 4  23:43
no band saw. Band saw is, let's, let's, Baker, single head, yeah, Baker, a one head. Band saw, that's the splitter, all

Matthias Miller  23:53
right. So then, so then, so then we're going to say the raw material quantity is point five. So you put in 1440 you have 720 raw material quantity for 1440 finished, finished product of half by six by 12. Yeah, and then we get rid of the split check box, which I makes me just happy. So then, all right, so that answers that question, what this is? Okay, but now you don't actually, I mean, but these are layers. So shouldn't this actually be three finished products of or No,

Speaker 2  24:35
no, no, because the palette itself is 60 by 48 so to cover 60 by 48 I need, oh, 40 by 48 plus I need 20 by 48 so one and a half times the 40 is

Matthias Miller  24:54
right, got it? It's split that way, right? I'm not sure what it was thinking, but that makes sense. Okay. Yeah. So then here, this split needs to change, because this isn't right. And here we need is this right then?

Speaker 2  25:11
So what is that? What is that split on the top that that doesn't need to be there? Does it matter? We're

Matthias Miller  25:16
gonna get rid of it. Yep. Okay, ignore it. We need

Unknown Speaker  25:20
to be able to split, not at the size or

Unknown Speaker  25:31
where we're

Speaker 2  25:33
is splitting happens in sawing, only in saw in in saw one, or saw two or saw three.

Matthias Miller  25:43
So we said, that's why the multiplier. So in this case, we're coming in with two and a half, half by three and a half by 48 and ending up with five. Well, sorry, we're coming in with two and a half,

Unknown Speaker  26:00
one by

Matthias Miller  26:02
three and a half, one by random, yep, and then ending up with five half by three and a half by 48 right? And that's happening in the splitter,

Unknown Speaker  26:15
yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  26:21
that that always happens in so on, saw one or saw two, maybe saw three.

Matthias Miller  26:29
Do we need to add it to saw three?

Unknown Speaker  26:31
I don't think so. Okay, no,

Matthias Miller  26:36
good. Okay. So, so that's that is. That is the first change. And then the other thing then was getting back into the size or cut list. We put in a raw material quantity for the sizer, which you can fill in on the item. If you were using the sizer, you could put in the sizer quantity, and it would multiply it out by the quantity that you're ordering, throw it in there, but then you could adjust this based on where it needs to be. I

Unknown Speaker  27:38
don't know if that makes

Speaker 2  27:39
you understand let me sell that makes sense. Okay, okay.

Matthias Miller  27:45
And then on the sawing cut list, I think there were some changes here too, maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Well, what

Unknown Speaker  27:57
was it called? Yeah, we had another

Matthias Miller  27:59
raw material quantity on here that we got rid of, I think,

Speaker 3  28:16
waste factor. We had a waste factor on the selling list too, where we only have that on the gain salt.

Matthias Miller  28:26
So do you want the waste to be? How do we want to handle the waste? Do you want that to be? I

Matthias Miller  28:43
it really should pattern after the production tracker and the pricing stuff, right, don't we covered in there.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
So

Speaker 2  28:56
not sure how you mean, how you connecting production tracker to waste factor.

Matthias Miller  29:05
I'm digging into the sketchy parts of my memory so that might be completely

Speaker 2  29:12
okay, um, waste factor was in a, should be in a,

Unknown Speaker  29:19
in a raw material. Data,

Speaker 2  29:25
well, item data, raw material, yeah, should be in there.

Matthias Miller  29:31
And that would be in the, do we have that before in the like the pricing, the cost calculator,

Speaker 2  29:38
yes, it's in there. All right. But that's taking all its data from from the it was, it was, it was then intended to be getting all of its information from cut list generator, although I don't know if he moved over any way. Factor calculation, but it was because it was built into the cost calculator.

Unknown Speaker  30:08
Right default,

Speaker 2  30:09
default, 10% with a 20% default if the runners got notched, and otherwise it was just an override,

Speaker 4  30:24
like an entry override, entry per per item or per

Matthias Miller  30:32
Yeah. So one of the things we could do on the saw then is have a setting for additional waste of 10% 10% and put that on the you have a default waste of 10% that gets added for the you said the Double notch,

Speaker 2  30:57
so the waste, the waste factor is on the sizers,

Unknown Speaker  31:07
fair enough,

Unknown Speaker  31:10
it really should. Well,

Speaker 3  31:15
let them add a percentage of waste to saw list. Yeah,

Speaker 2  31:19
there's nothing in sawing where we have to add for that, because everything's already everything's not technically, but everything is sized on the sizers, and everything in sewing is typically at full count, if you know what I mean, yep, like even the one inch that we're splitting the half inch, um, there's this built in idea in Pallet lumber that when you buy a four quarter, you're buying, you're buying a piece of wood that's thick enough to get two two half inch pieces out of it. Like you don't just sell guy a bunch of straight one inch it's got to be, should be at least inch and an eighth, for whatever reason, anyway, for all intents and purposes, that waste factor needs to be factored in on the sizers

Unknown Speaker  32:22
and I think

Speaker 2  32:28
so I'm going to two layers here from here Matt, so when we cut it on a sizer, that's where we have to cut the Extra so that we have enough for the job. So that's what we'll add to 10% or to 15, or to the 20, or maybe a ride say we do 13% so it happens there that that happening needs to be factored into pricing. So as that ties into pricing, it needs to be recognized. Hey, we, you know, we, we have to, we have to cut extra because of in, in our in our sizers entry, we already say it takes 13% more to do this job. So like when we when we do look at the pricing module, we need to pull that information from, from there, from the sizers window, basically.

Matthias Miller  33:38
Okay, so here, what makes sense is you have a quantity, you have the inventory pieces, and then you have the, I don't know the final pieces or the the assembly pieces. I'm not sure what you want

Speaker 2  33:56
to call out. The single item pieces is eight. The order is 100 so we need 800 but yes, the cut pieces to do the job at 10% we need 880 Exactly. But

Matthias Miller  34:09
then, but then what we'd want to do, but rather than put the waste here with the sawing stuff, it would be clearer to say that,

Unknown Speaker  34:21
right? Right. No, you're right. It'd be

Matthias Miller  34:25
clear to have columns down here that says, sizer. Sizer, pieces. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  34:36
Sizer,

Speaker 3  34:39
right. Now, Matt, I'm putting that 880 where's it at? Right in here, that 880 is where I'm typing in the miscellaneous prep. It tells I'm putting, like I need 800 pieces, magical good boards, 800 pieces. But. 880 pieces maximum, because that's the 10% so that allows them to go through that they can give me and basically pull out 80 pieces of junk and still get 800 but I still need 800 usable, so I put it in miscellaneous prep right now. But you're talking that you're going to make a separate box that I don't have to put in miscellaneous prep.

Matthias Miller  35:24
Yeah, that would be that. That'd be the idea, yeah, now

Unknown Speaker  35:28
we have all to type all that stuff in miscellaneous

Speaker 2  35:30
prep. That's good, Matt, but yeah, exactly the waste. The waste factor happens around the sizer, so somewhere by size, or it needs to show off. And when the print, when the sizers cut, list gets printed off, it needs to show the 800 pieces, but then in parentheses, it should show the 880 at 10% or something like that, right? Because George is doing that now, like he's saying, Yeah, I need 800 but then in a in a little separate box, so we'll jot down 880 like he's he's ordered enough of cans from the or to cut 880 pieces, and the guys know, okay, that's 10% extra. Whatever. Do

Matthias Miller  36:28
you want the same? Okay, so we need a size or waste percentage. Do you want the same thing for raw material quantity, where you say you know whatever this translates to, or however this one works, but you know eight 800 in parentheses, 880 at 10% so

Speaker 3  36:56
right now, like in raw material, quantity, size or to Get that 880 we get 30 pieces out of it, out of a 10 foot. So right now, 29 point, but I'm going to use 30 pieces in there. That's going to give us 900 pieces. It's actually going to give us 20 more pieces over the 10% but I can't just take a can cut part of

Unknown Speaker  37:23
it, right, yeah,

Speaker 2  37:26
it would say 10% maybe, if, if space is, if we want to keep it minimal, 10% W for waste. So 10% w equals 880, in a separate box. And then that 880 is the quantity that dictates how many of the cans get brought to the salt. Yep, but in the actual materials list that they're trying to get, they're trying to produce on the saw is 800 Yeah, three and a half 40, all right? And then if, and then if, George, like, if, if 10% means part of a can, then it's just going to round up. It's going to round up the next can in a perfect world, yeah, like, if you get, like, if you get 30 out of a can, and you want 100 extra, you're gonna have to use four cans, you're gonna end up with 120 extra.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
So what like,

Matthias Miller  38:39
but we could, if you have the raw material quantity this is getting in the weeds, but I think it's worth it. All right, let's start with this and get this squared away. Waste disappears, cut pieces. Is that still a good name for it? For the 800 here, it's quantity minus inventory.

Unknown Speaker  39:01
Yes. Okay, so here,

Matthias Miller  39:06
let me, let me make sure. I'm just going to start fresh to make sure, or

Speaker 2  39:09
you could say total, total pieces. Well, except

Matthias Miller  39:14
this is the total piece. I mean, quantity is the total pieces. It's the inventory. I mean, it's total minus inventory,

Unknown Speaker  39:23
yeah, the cut pieces would be the 880,

Unknown Speaker  39:27
that's right.

Matthias Miller  39:30
Well, okay, so the main thing would actually be, the main thing is, actually just move the waste percentage over to, over to the to the sizer side.

Speaker 5  39:42
Uh, sure. So

Speaker 2  39:47
quantity minus inventory equals, here's the cut pieces, or

Unknown Speaker  39:52
to cut whatever, yep,

Speaker 2  39:57
so if you 100 in inventory now, cut. Pieces say 700 and a waste percentage, 10% of 700 if you had 100 in it, right,

Unknown Speaker  40:09
right, yeah.

Matthias Miller  40:11
Like, if, like this, it'd be 770 All right. So then, if you say, on the raw material quantity, do you want to put that in, without waste. Like, do you want to say? I mean, what we could do is let you put into the item, say, completely making stuff up 1.75 and we we multiply it out by by what we need to cut and the waste and round it up to a whole number. Or do you still just want to?

Speaker 2  40:46
I still think that 770 in the waste factor should show up over by the size. Or

Matthias Miller  40:56
I agree, let's, let's, let's change this around so that we can visualize what's going on, inventory pieces, cut pieces and the waste percentage. All right, so, so let's so 700 All right, we need to or, sorry, we have 100 in in inventories. We're going to need 770 we have a 10% waste. So we need to cut 770 then how do you want the raw material quantity calculated? How do you want to put it on the item? And how do you want to calculate

Unknown Speaker  41:36
it? We need 700 100 in inventory. We need 800 good ones. So,

Unknown Speaker  41:45
yep, right? George,

Unknown Speaker  41:46
because you put Yep, that's right. Matt,

Matthias Miller  41:49
okay, but how do you come up with the 700 number 800 minus

Unknown Speaker  41:53
100 in inventory? That are all it wouldn't be

Speaker 3  41:56
700 it would be, how many Can't it be? No, it's how many cans you need. How many cans you Oh,

Unknown Speaker  42:01
what was your question, Matt?

Matthias Miller  42:02
I'm sorry, yeah. How do you come up with how many cans you need? That's, that's the question. Okay, so

Speaker 2  42:06
it's, now, it's the 770 divided by however many you get out of each can 30. So I don't know we talked about that a little bit. Do you want to dive into that, like, quantity out of a can.

Matthias Miller  42:23
I mean, is that how you want to is that how you how you think about it, like on the on the raw material side,

Speaker 2  42:30
yeah. How many do we get out of each can? Yes, that's right. So,

Matthias Miller  42:35
so really, this should change into quantity per count per can't, right?

Unknown Speaker  42:44
Sorry, say that one more time

Matthias Miller  42:45
on the item you want to say we get this many out of the can, right? Sure. So do we have a Okay, so if we go into the since we're working with Val five, um,

Speaker 2  43:03
yeah. I mean, we could, you could have a matt, if you would set up a window where we would do all those entries for every size in the quantity.

Unknown Speaker  43:14
Um,

Speaker 2  43:16
like, in other words, if I'm, if we're cutting 716, by five and a half by 40s. Out of five and a half by sixes, we're going to get 10 pieces every 40 inches. If we're cutting half inch by five and a half by 40, we're going to get nine pieces out of every 40 inches.

Unknown Speaker  43:39
So if, like, Yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:42
but that's where we need to start putting in, where it'd be nice to start having almost like, like having items, having items for cans so that we can, or some things that we can, we can spell out the dimensions of the can't, right?

Speaker 2  44:05
Well, like us, it comes down to, I want to say this, right? Well, most of the camps we cut are three and a half by six, or five and a half by six, okay, the dimensions that we cut out of those is only maybe 12 or so, 1314, right? So if it's a three and a half by six, we're going to cut 716 by three and a half, half inch by three and a half. 916, by three and a half. Yada, yada yada, if you get what I'm saying, Yep. And then in the five and a halfs, we're going to cut that out of a five and a half by six, same. Same thing applies. 716, by five. I'm gonna get 10, 716, nine, half inch. Eight, 916,

Unknown Speaker  45:11
down the line. Um. But then

Speaker 2  45:16
there's going to be occasions like, there's other sizes that that we cut, like, say, inch and 13/16, by three and 13/16, um, yeah, if you would give us a data page for can't, for can't sizes and for thickness and width, like, based on this, based on the thickness and width, and based on the can size, here's the yield,

Matthias Miller  45:53
right? And then of length, you just do 20 divided by 40. Or is there?

Speaker 2  45:59
Yeah, yeah, usually, unless we do a mixed bag, like, sometimes we'll cut a we do combo cuts, you know, trying

Unknown Speaker  46:14
to think how that's going to play out.

Unknown Speaker  46:19
I mean, it would be, but it would be

Speaker 2  46:24
like, for example, Matt, if we cut 40 inch out of a 10 footer, which is 120 inches, so we cut 40s out of 120 we're going to get three cuts, three lengths, Yep, if we cut 42 out of that same 120 we'll get two at 42 and then we'll cut a 36 off the bat, right?

Unknown Speaker  46:51
So if you just deduct,

Speaker 6  46:53
but you can't use the 36 not for

Speaker 2  46:57
this job, correct? Not for this job, right? So for all intents and purposes, it's as many lengths as you can possibly get out of a pool. Length. Can't say it's 10 foot I mean, if it's 10 foot four, we're going to cut three, 340, twos out of it, or 10 foot six, you know what? I mean, like that kind of thing. That's where, but that's that has nothing to do with this. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  47:25
that's a side.

Matthias Miller  47:28
Okay, so, so basically, we can maps, say, map a thickness and width to a thickness to width, and then use the length as a multiplier.

Unknown Speaker  47:40
Um, sure, sure, sure.

Unknown Speaker  47:51
Then we'll have to go in and

Speaker 2  47:56
like for example, if you're doing two, two and a halfs and a 13/16, out of a three and a half by six, like you do sometimes we're just going to say two and a half. A three and a half yield out of a three and a half by six is two pieces.

Speaker 4  48:13
And then you're rolling in your you're going to write 1316, off the side. Computer doesn't care about that.

Speaker 3  48:24
Then if you go with three and a half by eight, right, three and a half of six is 10 at 716, right? You go to a three and a half eight, then you get 13. We have to

Speaker 2  48:33
enter that separately to that right, right, but we can enter, we'll have to enter all the, all the scenarios, but we can that's not gonna take long. Like, I mean, it's gonna take a little bit of time, but if we can do that one time, Matt lays out a nice map for it, and we can do it one time, yeah, that'll be well worth, well worth our time and well worth Matt's time, yep. And

Matthias Miller  49:05
then that'll let us calculate on here. We can then calculate the quantity per, can't

Unknown Speaker  49:12
say that again, Matt, so if we have that map, and we

Matthias Miller  49:16
do the length, length as a multiplier, yeah. Even keeping in mind rounding, you know, rounding down, yeah, get used partial lengths, yeah, calculate the quantity for count for can't and, and then from that, We can over here based on the 770 say, All right, if it's 30 per cant, then it's 770 is divided by 30 is 25.6 rounds up to 26 cans, correct? And that's the raw material quantity,

Speaker 2  49:54
yeah. And then if he goes in here and he says, cut it out of a. 14 footer. That changes your calculation, right? In other words, raw material, info, Slicer, sizer, yep,

Matthias Miller  50:11
yep. So we're going to need a so we're going to need to break the sizer apart, and we're gonna have three. One is the,

Matthias Miller  50:28
I guess. How do you want to? Do you want this broken apart into three, like sickness, width and length, and then, and then the wood

Speaker 2  50:40
sorry, I'm not tracking point with you okay

Matthias Miller  50:44
we're gonna need to break this apart into at a minimum

Unknown Speaker  50:49
what we need to do sorry I'm not with you down here okay

Matthias Miller  50:52
all right this this guy right here yep this will need to be something like like either we can have a drop list that says five and a half five and a half by six, where you select this, or you select, or you have an option for three and a half by six. So you select the these dimensions first for what you want to cut it out, cut it out of. Then you have a lengthen feet for the raw material. Actually,

Speaker 2  51:17
Matt, I'd rather, I'd rather say, because it's cut out of a 716, by five and a half, it's automatically getting cut out of a five and a half by 647,

Matthias Miller  51:32
six, all right, So based on this, based on the thickness and width. The thickness and width is, is, then says what it's getting cut out of, what size it's getting cut out, cut out of, right?

Speaker 2  51:49
Yeah for, yeah, it's, it's good, yeah,

Speaker 6  51:53
it should, or it will. Well, when

Speaker 2  51:57
I, when I'm cutting some 16th and when it's five and a half inches in width it makes sense to cut it out of a five and a half and then get as many 716 out of that six as I can right? So yeah unless you know this all mill sends us some five and a half by eights to which we would then change the raw material down here to say, instead of five and a half by 610 we're gonna cut out a five and a half by eight by 10.

Unknown Speaker  52:31
But now

Speaker 3  52:35
you have to change it here, Matt, or can you change it on the fly? On your regular sizer list?

Matthias Miller  52:41
Well, I mean, the short answer is, it depends. That's not a really good answer. We just need to figure out how it

Speaker 2  52:49
needs to work. The thing would be, then, if the dimensions are 716, by five and a half, yeah. And as like, as soon as we write raw material info sizer as soon as we put down five and a half by six it matches boom boom like it it confirms that hey we're getting 10 out of each one because every time we cut five and a Half by six into 716, by five and a half, there's always 10. The yield is always 10.

Matthias Miller  53:28
Well, that's where it could make sense to switch. Switch from your your raw material to break these apart. Where, here's the raw material thickness, here's the raw material width. Here's the raw material length. Okay. Oh, okay, so you split this apart, we'll still show it okay as this, but that way we could do the calculations on it. Okay, and then, and then we have also have a raw material wood type or something.

Speaker 2  54:00
Yeah, I think, I think you're on to something. Matt, I Yeah, sounds. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  54:05
Okay. So then the other question I would have is, are these always is? Is the sizer raw material always can't and can we call them cans, just to make it less confusing,

Unknown Speaker  54:25
yes, except for scalpy.

Unknown Speaker  54:32
The scalpy won't be cans, but

Unknown Speaker  54:34
are you doing scalpy with this?

Speaker 1  54:38
Is that let me do. It's set up for it. It is set up for it.

Matthias Miller  54:44
So what's scalpy? Well,

Speaker 2  54:47
they're cutting these same dimensions but they're cutting them out of smaller pieces of of wood Okay, specifically, like the. Outer, the outer like half moons or whatever of the tree like, they get as many squares as they can out of the log, and then that outer circle slide is called a slab map. So then they'll take that slab, and they might get a they might get three, 716, by five and a half so out of that outer little half, half moon piece or whatever.

Matthias Miller  55:30
All right, well, I don't feel strongly. We can call it like this. I mean, we can call it this way. It does go ahead.

Speaker 3  55:37
Well, George, we can keep keep Keystone and Brewer. What we're talking about here, Matt and they scalp you a different category, yeah, out of the size or thing,

Speaker 2  55:49
because scalpy, what George does there is he'll send the he'll send the dimensions that he needs and the quantity that he needs to scalpy and the species, but he will not send any of the can't or the raw material info to scalpy. All right. Sorry, that's a bunny trail a little bit, but it is a legit

Matthias Miller  56:14
so we can actually call these, at least for the dimensions we need, a separate wood species that's beyond just can't, but, but we can call the so for for each of the for each of the sizers, be able to specify that they use cans, and Then specify the can't, thickness, width, the length and feet have the can't quantity mapping specified, except

Speaker 2  56:54
for scalping, except for Yeah, exactly, except for scalpy. Scalpy. You won't send any of the raw material information or sawing like, if the sizer is scalpy, then everything from raw material quantity down,

Unknown Speaker  57:13
say, everything but

Speaker 2  57:16
multiplier saw One, saw two, raw material quantity, all the raw material windows, all that stuff is a non factor. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  57:30
so could we

Unknown Speaker  57:35
miscellaneous prep still?

Matthias Miller  57:36
We could use miscellaneous prep for everything that we need on scalpy, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  57:43
right, nope,

Unknown Speaker  57:48
no, there still needs to

Speaker 2  57:53
scalpy, yeah. Scalpy doesn't need to show the waste factor either, Matt, because that's their prerogative to nurse. Yeah, like 1% of that that's on them to send us good the good stuff at the quantity that we order. So because George, if you send an order of boards to scalpy, you're automatically adding extra for waste,

Unknown Speaker  58:21
100 birds, what I'm adding.

Speaker 2  58:24
So do you still want the waste factor multiplier in? How you going to do that when you do scalp these? But list,

Unknown Speaker  58:36
I just have 100 and if it closed for 1000 I've had 1100

Speaker 2  58:39
what I'm saying, if it's auto generated based on the order, it's telling it 1000 that's what you need to do. The Job scalp it gets to pay for it saves 1000 it's not gonna say 1100 unless we give you like a scalpy. Safety, scalpy margin, margin quantity, or something like that. Waste margin, like, it's like, it'd be like a hidden window from the printout, because we fax it over. I mean, you

Speaker 3  59:24
have to have an inventory window, and then you'd have to have, you know, in generated, you know, mean, every time it cuts of whatever scalping we we actually add 100 that magical numbers, 100 instead of having a percentage that we have to, because,

Speaker 2  59:43
like, Matt's going to do this where you can adjust the waste factor, like we can build it in 10% but if you want more, or if you're notching, or whatever, you can adjust that. Do you want to keep that same apparatus? Small for scalping,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:02
right?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04
But then for scalpy,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
you don't want to show it.

Speaker 2  1:00:12
You don't want to show it when, when it's gets because it's going to show on the brewer and the Keystone cut list. It's going to show 770, at 10% back the numbers we had earlier, but when we said it to scalp, we just wanted to show 770 right? And we don't want to show 700 either, right? Sorry, Matt, that's but,

Matthias Miller  1:00:38
yep, we discover we can still use the waste percentage, but we just won't print out. We'll just print out the final quantity,

Speaker 2  1:00:45
yes, and And then George will be able to ride that as he needs to. Yep. So that was kind of a long body trail, but you were talking about sizers um, shoot, I forget where we were last well. So then over here, you for a map for cutting the cans. Yeah, you said it always can't. So, yeah, it's not always can't, um,

Matthias Miller  1:01:17
but it doesn't really matter. Because, I mean, I mean, the basic thing is, for scalpy, we don't use cans. We don't use raw material. It could go in the miscellaneous prep, like, like, we can call these cans. I mean, we can call the dimensions cans, because the only time we use the dimensions is for everything but scalpy, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:44
can you, can you? Can you

Unknown Speaker  1:01:50
shoot lost my train of thought.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:56
You said we so if we're cutting that where's that

Unknown Speaker  1:02:04
raw material and size or

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
so? If it's

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
scalpy,

Speaker 2  1:02:21
what's the brewer? The Brewer is going to show, body, order, inventory, waste, cut pieces.

Matthias Miller  1:02:33
And then we would have, here, let me change these. This isn't going to be, I mean, this isn't working, workable. But just to show you, so we would have the can't thickness. We would have the and then we'd have the can't length in feet. And and then we would have the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
can't

Matthias Miller  1:03:11
quantity. And then we'd also have the I

Speaker 4  1:03:26
um, one page, all on one computer page, I guess. Man, well,

Matthias Miller  1:03:35
they George, you're going to have to ask talk, talk to talk to your boss, they make, they make a 42 inch screens. So when I this is full screen for me, which you can barely read, right? But it's just fine for me. So yeah, that's right. That's right. Tell Tell em. It'll make your job twice as fast. And

Speaker 2  1:03:59
we talk about 42 inches corner to corner, kind of like our wedges, like they're doing now,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:06
exactly,

Speaker 2  1:04:09
were you talking 42 inches wide? Man, we got a 50 inch screen, and that sucker is not 50 inches wide. I was like, What's wrong with this thing? Man,

Matthias Miller  1:04:18
I have no idea. Whose idea who thought it up that you should measure them diagonally, but name the FDA, right. Let's go, yeah, right. Exactly, exactly. Oh,

Speaker 2  1:04:29
my word. But no wait. Well, George has a bigger one. This is my lap. We're on my laptop, Matt. But yeah, yeah. Anyway, George, I'll usually tell him. If you need anything, let me know. So if he needs a 42 inch wide screen. We'll get in one

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
um for

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
that. So that's cool.

Matthias Miller  1:04:47
I can't, I could not figure out back at the thrift store days they were doing their route scheduling and stuff, and they had these, all these stuff. And I'm like, guys like, just get a big screen. It'll make their lives so much easier. Never could persuade him to do it, but wow. Little side note, and I'll stop beating a not so dead horse, but Microsoft did a study on what's the biggest factor of productivity on computers, and the number one correlating factor was the size of your screen.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
Oh, my, wow. Looks good leaving it,

Speaker 2  1:05:23
yeah, we need that Office upgrade too. That'll that plays right into it.

Matthias Miller  1:05:28
So the way I would think about it is, then you have the, you have the cut pieces, 880, okay, here we I dropped this. All right. Let's save this. All right, so you have the cut pieces now at 770 because we got 10% waste the can't thickness, this would copy across you can't thickness, width and length, and then end up with a can't quantity that would be calculated that presumably you could then adjust as you need to. I can't species. Raw material info, really isn't really isn't necessary anymore.

Speaker 2  1:06:15
It could be like he might write something down, like or wait, no, what do you say? Raw material info, right, right? Because, well, like that RS might be Riverview sawmill. Oh, runner. He does need to be able to add miscellaneous. We're at,

Matthias Miller  1:06:46
I guess we could have a can't I mean, you could do it one of two ways. You could do you could change this nut we can't species and just have it be like, can't notes or something. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:06:56
can't notes. Or additional, I was gonna say additional can't info, which could be the saw mills lumber that we you know, which saw mills lumber we want to use? Could say old bundle by the tree, or it could something like that, right? Could be a stock like,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
or he, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:30
something like that. Sure. So then this goes away. Oh, no, what do you think? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:07:39
so wait, so inventory, single item, dimensions, the waste, cut pieces. Can't fix this with the name, yeah, you know, I think so Matt. And then I'm, yeah, I'm interested in that, in that map, mapping for the thickness and width out of the cans, right? Or do you have the information that you need there? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:08:11
it would be the, I mean, you need the you need the

Speaker 1  1:08:20
the thickness, the cut thickness it,

Matthias Miller  1:08:23
or the, what, what? How would you call it? So,

Speaker 2  1:08:27
the thickness of the Where's, where's your, um, where's the, sorry, dimensions, where, what's dimensions? Uh, again, thickness is in the width. So in the camps, it's usually the opposite, per se, like the smallest dimension is is the tallness of it, and the width is like six inches, you know what I mean, but we, we should know, but we don't have to. I'm just I'm trying to think we don't have to think of it that way.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
You follow me a little bit, Matt like

Matthias Miller  1:09:18
so in in a with lumber, you do sickness by width by length. And on a can't, you do width by thickness by length.

Speaker 2  1:09:34
Interesting, yeah, I guess so, yeah, that's right. That's That's exactly right.

Matthias Miller  1:09:41
Okay, well, that's good to know. I mean, I don't,

Speaker 2  1:09:46
yeah, that's what we're gonna we're gonna go with that. I like that. That's a good way to do it. Matt, it keeps it simple on your side, and it doesn't have, it doesn't matter on our side. I

Matthias Miller  1:09:57
mean, okay, so from a i. From my standpoint, when you've got somebody who doesn't know much about about about pallet manufacturing and saw mills and stuff like that, just having both be thickness by width by length, makes is the most simplest. From the software side, just in terms of you can do it either way, but then it's consistent across the two. But if, if this is literally, but if what I described with length, thickness, length is how you think about it, then I would make an argument that we should do how you guys think about it.

Speaker 2  1:10:33
I mean, the reality is, I mean, just trying to confirm my thought here, if if the thickness or the width of the can matches the thickness or the width of the dimensions, like if, if they match well, not always going to work that way. But like, if we need 7/16 by six inch boards, all of a sudden, you know, we're going to turn that five and a half by six the other way, and we're going to cut it. You know what I mean, we're going to, we're going to cut the 716 out of the five and a half and only get nine instead of 10, so we get that full six. But,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
well, I mean, if, if you can do

Speaker 2  1:11:29
in the can't do, do it the opposite, say, width by thickness, because that's what we're buying. I mean, that's, that's what we're paying for. It's just stacked differently, and it's cut on edge. Yeah, you know, right? Because, because what happens is if you cut that on a band saw a horizontal band saw instead of these vertical, blades then then it gets stood up on edge,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
and it gets peeled one anyway whatever it's just a peeled from top to bottom, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:14
I'm happy I'm happy all

Matthias Miller  1:12:16
right, and then and so we would have a lumber uh, come on, stop it. On the mapping, we would then have a lumber thickness, thickness and width and and then on the can, we'd have a width of thickness to map those across, yeah. I mean, that seems pretty straightforward to me.

Matthias Miller  1:12:48
And then we need a can't, sorry, on the can. And then we need a quantity, a lumber quantity per can't on that mapping.

Speaker 2  1:13:13
