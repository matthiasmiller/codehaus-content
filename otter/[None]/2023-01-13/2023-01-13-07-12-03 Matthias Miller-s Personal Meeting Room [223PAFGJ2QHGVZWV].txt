Unknown Speaker  01:09
Let me close I should send out an update on this call here

Unknown Speaker  02:06
okay do this through all my

Unknown Speaker  02:19
chicken scratch notes in there

Matthias Miller  02:21
okay

Unknown Speaker  02:24
so

Matthias Miller  02:26
Insite we did get sign off on the meeting this morning to do two things number one build an outline of everything that could be documented within assist and Number two there's a

Unknown Speaker  02:48
let's see

Matthias Miller  02:54
the payroll bot and and updating the payroll module proposal I think round one

Unknown Speaker  03:08
would be to go through and

Unknown Speaker  03:18
see configuring period just well

Matthias Miller  03:27
I don't know there's there's there's a few ways we can approach this number one just go through the software and and compare the interface so on the company record

Speaker 1  03:42
I guess we could probably do this test assist as well

Matthias Miller  03:53
so here we talked about pay period how the pay period is configured there's a configure pay payroll

Unknown Speaker  04:04
there's that none of that this is

Matthias Miller  04:12
really anything to note

Unknown Speaker  04:19
so we'll have a

Matthias Miller  04:24
so some of this is not this is this is not software documentation. This is just business business case.

Unknown Speaker  04:40
This is the

Matthias Miller  04:41
part that is software so we got the effective date company type, owner pool and production pool

Matthias Miller  04:52
then the nine payouts

Matthias Miller  05:00
So phase one could just be going through all of these things and making sure that I don't know this is something I can just turn you loose on and say hey can you confirm that this is you know there were no new fields added or not that could be an option or it could be that we should just go through it together The other approach on this is

Unknown Speaker  05:30
not something you would have access to but if we could fix that but anyway

Unknown Speaker  05:43
yeah

Speaker 1  06:04
so that one's not so good we do these with change request me I wonder how many of these are change requests and have

Unknown Speaker  06:18
no

Matthias Miller  06:25
some of this stuff I will need to help you go

Unknown Speaker  06:27
through and let's do this

Unknown Speaker  07:03
so

Matthias Miller  07:06
we need to build outline of all pieces update

Matthias Miller  07:47
Alright, so, I guess one of the questions is what are you familiar with? Or what are you comfortable with? Would you be comfortable with going through here trying to wrap your mind around this as best you can and then checking it against the test system just basically checking for significant diff differences things that are listed here that aren't on the proposal or vice versa

Matthias Miller  08:17
start with that, is that something that you're and then just notating those with a to do some kind of to do syntax in the dev spec so we can take a look at it. Is that something you're comfortable with? Or is it jumping off the deep end to Fortune fast? No, I think I could think I'd be comfortable with that. I've been doing some like the practice mock up and different stuff like that. So I'm starting to get a good picture in my mind of how the proposal is supposed to translate to something visual so yeah, I feel like I'd be be comfortable with looking into that sounds good. And then there are also the other thing that we would check would be CFP

Unknown Speaker  09:06
actually it would be

Speaker 1  09:18
don't even know we should just go through here. Changes to overtime pay can't wait

Speaker 1  09:34
find PPR tracks vendor invoice one status, compass item mapping district fields I've added the mark one opportunity sales rep from Robins book reviews. Like or two

Unknown Speaker  10:02
Okay,

Matthias Miller  10:02
so most of the payroll stuff was apparently before we started using change requests

Speaker 1  10:05
the earliest was going back change that went to change requests but it looks like we started using those in probably October September October so that's not going to help let's get a few minutes here before we need to drop off let's go take a brief look at these

Unknown Speaker  10:45
feminine love and intuition

Unknown Speaker  10:59
not even sure

Unknown Speaker  11:24
should probably be no to me we should actually

Unknown Speaker  11:36
one doesn't actually need anything

Speaker 1  11:47
should record default production percentage for employee we have that one

Unknown Speaker  11:57
management

Unknown Speaker  12:09
sure about that

Unknown Speaker  12:23
oh

Speaker 1  12:42
yes sure that's visible or not

Matthias Miller  13:07
this one you can see if you can wrap your head around it see it let's see if this is actually document well enough for you

Speaker 1  13:13
to do that maybe the testing instructions that one looks like it needs to be documented.

Matthias Miller  14:01
13 week bonus is going away

Unknown Speaker  14:15
understand the labor intensive buildings

Unknown Speaker  14:38
Archie

Unknown Speaker  14:47
realist

Unknown Speaker  14:53
Hello

Unknown Speaker  15:00
To explain it doesn't work anymore

Matthias Miller  15:09
I'm gonna guess that's not critical All right, and you can see if these are things that you feel comfortable making updates to in the documentation not happy about and then let's

Unknown Speaker  15:34
find some time

Unknown Speaker  16:01
Wednesday morning and set work. Stay morning yes

Unknown Speaker  16:19
let's circle back then and spend some time working on it together. Cool.

Matthias Miller  16:28
