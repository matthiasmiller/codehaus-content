Unknown Speaker  00:22
All right so

Unknown Speaker  00:31
the

Unknown Speaker  00:36
first off something for ZTE

Unknown Speaker  00:38
Kay

Unknown Speaker  00:49
actually this is been there for a while might be able to get LS

Unknown Speaker  01:06
I'll get your quick thoughts on it I

Speaker 1  01:07
guess so this was on the customers needing checking report they had asked about being able to

Unknown Speaker  01:23
yeah to edit

Speaker 1  01:24
have better editing for these and I think it was specifically to have build to the Edit multi line text rather than just a single line

Speaker 1  01:49
Yeah cuz they just have it's a single line at this point there were two ideas one was use a wrap text box and give two lines of plain text entry and then the other idea was a child screen that shows a notes field and so on

Unknown Speaker  02:16
is

Speaker 1  02:19
so we had said this to super simple the client first wanted to and now he's saying that option one is fine with option one

Unknown Speaker  02:27
any of your perspective

Speaker 1  02:37
any thing else needed for for a spec for this actually this is

Unknown Speaker  02:45
this is old F spec here

Unknown Speaker  02:49
I would slightly tweak it for the check in notes column

Unknown Speaker  02:53
check the

Unknown Speaker  02:58
check or enable the wrap

Unknown Speaker  02:59
column setting

Unknown Speaker  03:08
column would be lowercase where is it rap let's see what it is. Was the the rap text it's quote

Speaker 2  03:25
you like quote rap capital W rap lowercase text

Unknown Speaker  03:32
setting okay

Unknown Speaker  03:38
those specs and everything could go away.

Unknown Speaker  03:42
So okay, so it's

Unknown Speaker  03:51
yeah,

Speaker 1  03:51
so that's that's just that simple. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:55
unless we need to further widen it but yes, it is that simple.

Unknown Speaker  03:58
Okay. I mean, you can even

Unknown Speaker  04:03
pop out that report and test it yourself if you want to. Sure. Which, I mean, I'm assuming we already had but

Speaker 1  04:14
I think we probably did. Yeah. Yep. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  04:22
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  04:23
So I'll just plan to clean that up

Unknown Speaker  04:40
and then I

Speaker 1  04:44
think this was actually resolved because our results in email Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:59
Go away. And

Unknown Speaker  05:03
there was this one about the

Speaker 1  05:10
error saving some of these incidents or this one incident specifically

Unknown Speaker  05:31
so this was

Speaker 1  05:33
a past lead that I had crossed paths with at the Simba summit so I came in here and documented some notes and when I went to save it was not marked billable and I got I got this error when incident must be billable if one or more invoices or payments coming in here it has somehow or another it has two invoices marked listed here and so apparently it was

Speaker 3  06:19
billed somewhere

Unknown Speaker  06:24
we'd expect it was built to code crafters

Unknown Speaker  06:29
back in the day,

Speaker 2  06:30
do you have been billing them for sales time or something? I would

Unknown Speaker  06:43
do you have a date for that

Speaker 1  06:50
invoice date of eight 620 19?

Unknown Speaker  07:19
Yeah to week 34 Yeah, that was That was

Unknown Speaker  07:27
mean it was built to code crafters.

Unknown Speaker  07:31
Okay. Okay, so

Speaker 1  07:34
the billing to back to code grafters for now and

Speaker 2  07:38
I mean you can add your own entry I mean you can just add your own entry and build it at zero $0 You're right at zero

Speaker 1  07:46
I wasn't tracking I don't think I was tracking anytime on it yeah, I wasn't tracking anytime on it. Bill

Unknown Speaker  07:55
my time at zero though.

Unknown Speaker  08:03
Okay, invoiced Whoa. Hang on

Unknown Speaker  08:11
an invoice negative

Unknown Speaker  08:18
No, 323 32 no, go back to it's not 333 put in like okay, go back to 105 and the hourly rate

Unknown Speaker  08:36
or is it put us 100

Speaker 1  08:47
There you go. Okay, see it was kind of work.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
Or put in on the material cost. Let's actually do this. Let's on the time adjustment

Speaker 3  09:03
add a new row 486 19.

Unknown Speaker  09:14
At four colon 13 at

Unknown Speaker  09:16
100. Time Time and force our team. Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay.

Speaker 2  09:23
Let's move it down into time adjustment and then zero out my rate

Unknown Speaker  09:34
and then this one is zero. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  09:40
That way, if I track time with going forward, I will

Unknown Speaker  09:45
for whatever reason. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Okay

Unknown Speaker  10:08
and then I'll just let this be billed to LS

Unknown Speaker  10:12
yeah and that's fine like that

Speaker 2  10:22
I remember this guy I thought he was crazy for not going with us

Unknown Speaker  10:29
as I recall

Speaker 2  10:34
you should if you're not gonna follow up with him you should have elessar Well

Unknown Speaker  10:40
where did he decide he's not

Unknown Speaker  10:46
he ends up maybe a yearly checking be worthwhile

Unknown Speaker  11:04
All right I

Speaker 2  11:08
don't know if it's worth another conversation or not but there's your billing issue

Unknown Speaker  11:13
Yeah, that takes care of that

Unknown Speaker  11:22
cool

Unknown Speaker  11:30
All right. And

Speaker 1  11:40
oh yes partial export of client proposal just want to discuss that especially since we're moving towards the symbols being ready for

Unknown Speaker  11:54
partial export here partial print

Speaker 1  12:08
so you had talked about template for exporting partial proposal and it was just one section at a time and I was wondering about about being able to do multiple sections

Unknown Speaker  12:26
section and let me you're going to be needing this.

Speaker 1  12:34
Well, we like we can make it work. We can export the whole thing to Word and Word format and then delete all the extra pages at the bottom and

Unknown Speaker  12:46
all that. So it I mean,

Speaker 1  12:51
I know you've got to know other stuff right now. So if this is a more than a 15 minute job, then let's take a look.

Unknown Speaker  13:04
Give me screensharing

Unknown Speaker  16:22
records reconcile and accounting reports records

Unknown Speaker  16:33
which is gonna get all of the record stuff

Unknown Speaker  16:42
Why did I choose records

Unknown Speaker  16:51
we have

Unknown Speaker  17:01
sorry,

Unknown Speaker  17:02
muted so if you select a parent

Unknown Speaker  17:05
you will get all the ones under it that's the way it works right now

Unknown Speaker  17:14
it's doing a weird outline that's not the oh it's not doing the right outline here.

Speaker 3  17:22
So it's not the outline that we use section outline MLA style words

Unknown Speaker  17:50
proposal section outline

Speaker 3  17:53
contents dense section print heading number display okay

Speaker 2  18:07
so unclamp proposals do we use we use a numbering

Unknown Speaker  18:10
system then

Unknown Speaker  18:16
for the for the rows

Unknown Speaker  18:19
yeah

Unknown Speaker  18:22
yeah it's the numbering system that

Unknown Speaker  18:26
the order there but oh for the actual display the sections Yeah

Unknown Speaker  18:42
Why are we use

Unknown Speaker  19:00
Why would we do this

Speaker 3  19:41
now we can do this number pipe list

Unknown Speaker  20:17
Okay so we do one

Speaker 2  20:43
alright, so counting we do six which is going to get that we're going to do 9.3

Speaker 3  20:53
and 9.53 Go ahead 6662636465666793953 Okay,

Speaker 2  21:28
well wait let me just sanity check in I'm 90% sure that's right but I'm still just slightly paranoid okay. So

Unknown Speaker  21:44
this is

Speaker 2  21:46
all the section headings with the client proposals section ID which is good contents we find

Unknown Speaker  21:58
find all the

Speaker 2  22:01
number displays which are periods delimited in cattle sections, if there are any pre prefixes that match or

Unknown Speaker  22:11
the current prefix says

Speaker 2  22:15
as a selected prefix we'll start with the include section. I mean looks to me like you have wheat

Unknown Speaker  22:27
right here today

Unknown Speaker  22:31
You're welcome. Yeah all day.

Speaker 1  22:37
And I guess it shows it doesn't take too much to be my hair sometimes. We're like awesome working for a custom software company. Yeah, exactly. Cool. So is this something that is just you can send me a link I'll save it to see that same link

Unknown Speaker  23:03
that was in there. Okay, actually, I'm gonna rename it though

Unknown Speaker  23:15
rename sections oops

Speaker 2  23:45
I mean, would you rather just manually select the specific

Unknown Speaker  23:56
section instead

Unknown Speaker  24:03
as opposed

Unknown Speaker  24:04
to having auto important the child sections

Unknown Speaker  24:14
think in most

Speaker 1  24:14
cases, we find it including the child sections, but here are you able

Unknown Speaker  24:19
to

Speaker 1  24:22
like if I select, if I select one child section, it will exclude the others.

Speaker 2  24:29
Yeah, so you could do you could do 9.5 Which would get these 9.52 which will get this one nine which would get these

Unknown Speaker  24:39
okay.

Speaker 1  24:42
But if I want to do but if I don't want to include the whole nine section I leave nine blank and just do 9.1 9.3 and 9.5.

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Then it would include include those

Unknown Speaker  25:03
Yeah, I think

Speaker 2  25:09
I kind of like the simplicity of not automatically including child sections. Even if it's more obtuse to run, because it's there's no confusion about what's going to be included. But

Speaker 1  25:19
yeah, I mean, if it's, if it's simple like I'm, I'm good with that it does. It makes it less confusing for,

Unknown Speaker  25:28
for us to remember which is we didn't say actually

Unknown Speaker  25:46
it's actually substantially

Speaker 2  25:52
Alright, now let's try this. We're going to run a counting. We're going to do

Unknown Speaker  25:58
six 6.5.

Unknown Speaker  26:07
Okay, cool.

Speaker 2  26:09
So then you can actually do this and you can say I do not want.

Unknown Speaker  26:15
She going from one to four. Everything else? Sure. I

Speaker 2  26:20
want to say this birdie. If that's what I was hoping for. I was that's why we are not going to do

Unknown Speaker  26:29
we change one other thing? Do

Unknown Speaker  26:39
we do that.

Speaker 1  26:45
Oh, we put that in there. Yeah. In a file name. Yes, I think that sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  26:55
And then otherwise, if you select

Speaker 3  26:59
okay, so then if we do now two or two and 31234.

Unknown Speaker  27:11
Okay, I like it. I think it's good.

Unknown Speaker  27:15
No, I'm happy. All right. So to run the renamed file

Unknown Speaker  27:28
and then

Unknown Speaker  27:31
yes, or no.

Unknown Speaker  27:35
And then the

Speaker 1  27:36
the number at the end, that's just the RG row ID or something.

Speaker 2  27:41
That's the internal number we could actually probably we could get is we can rewrite the report to get rid of it. But it means if well, the number it means if you it means if you pull it the Ask prompt. And then maybe reorder your rows. It's still going to work. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  28:08
Okay, no, that's I think it's fine.

Unknown Speaker  28:11
For now. That is a good point, though.

Unknown Speaker  28:24
Couldn't make this a lot simpler.

Unknown Speaker  28:37
Or a bit simpler. But it's good does its job. Yep, I like it.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
Okay, great.

Speaker 1  28:57
Thanks a lot. Yep. You're welcome. is exciting.

Unknown Speaker  29:03
And use brilliant. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:19
We'll plan to talk.

Unknown Speaker  29:23
On Monday then, I guess. Tuesday. Tuesday. Tuesday. All right. Have a good weekend.

Unknown Speaker  29:35
All right. We'll do you as well. Thanks.
