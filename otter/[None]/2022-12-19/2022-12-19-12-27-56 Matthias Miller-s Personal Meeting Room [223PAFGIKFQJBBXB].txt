Unknown Speaker  01:22
Change positions

Matthias Miller  01:25
Yeah Dude get enough sleep last night sit down

Speaker 1  01:30
okay so nicot originally helped me build this thing and because of where the RG of this stuff lives it makes reporting on it kind of difficult because when here's here's the I that I really want to do I really want this to be like the line items on this to actually be line item so that when I drop it into say Excel they actually like the URLs actually work and I'm hoping that you're going to tell me there's magic that you can work that Nick couldn't work

Matthias Miller  02:13
building haulers historical notes because

Unknown Speaker  02:27
he's concatenating everything into because I guess it's because of where that RG

Matthias Miller  02:35
lives

Matthias Miller  02:41
I don't understand I billing loop type

Matthias Miller  03:05
completing the range why is this I'm not understanding Are you

Speaker 1  03:14
okay so because you're evaluating on the building record on the locations are G with and inside of that locations our G is the hauler notes themselves so it's the way it evaluates that the way it was the way he explained to me because of the way he evaluates there's no way to get these as as a list of items as actual line items rather it's he had to concatenate it together

Matthias Miller  03:53
well, I mean technically,

Speaker 1  03:56
would it be easier for me to start over and tell you exactly what I'm what it's supposed to do? Or do you understand what it's supposed to do?

Matthias Miller  04:03
No, I'm really confused or what this thing's supposed to do so

Speaker 1  04:06
so grab grab any one of those line items there let's open up that building record. So click on the Edit locations so the hauler notes from that RG line which is down there in the big blue button at the bottom of that RG that the MRG there so I want that information based on that locations. Our G row for the for any building that was delivered yesterday is what it's supposed to do. I want all of those RG lines and ideally if I can have it I get it Oh wait I think when we the has our G thing is that that's a fairly new macro isn't it?

Matthias Miller  05:16
Yeah like 20 years maybe yours

Speaker 1  05:25
never mind I'm just going to stop talking let you do your magic this is what this is why I wanted I needed you there was there was a whatever I'll just stop talking

Matthias Miller  05:53
don't psychoanalyze me your buddy

Matthias Miller  06:59
it's up to you to make sure it's actually showing the right information but okay, save that

Speaker 1  07:07
then. So now so now if I drop that into a spreadsheet those URLs will actually work Correct?

Matthias Miller  07:20
Well, if not I can also link a phi the

Speaker 1  07:24
Oh no. Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Now now that it's actually a row line. Now you can see there's already a button in there for it. Link I don't know what you mean by link. Nevermind. Oh, can you know can you really you're my hero if you do this?

Matthias Miller  08:10
Anything else you'd like? Pecan pie?

Speaker 1  08:14
I mean, I mean, besides having the image right in here, that would, which would be a bridge too far. But so would this okay with what you did? Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Don't tempt me. Please, do

Speaker 1  08:27
you would make me so if you turn this into an Export Now could you actually make the Imogen

Matthias Miller  08:34
as a word export, no, but I could do a not sure if I can do this or not. Let me try this

Unknown Speaker  08:53
you got to make me start giggling

Matthias Miller  09:02
give this as a sub pain. Okay, where's

Speaker 1  09:06
Yeah, but I know see this report is I really wanted to automate it. Really what I wanted to do something can be kind of interesting. But

Matthias Miller  09:18
no, there's no. How would you do this? No. You do a Google script that does a web services call. puts these images into a Google Doc.

Speaker 1  09:32
Well, no, I mean, my plan was to actually I mean, this is a great like having it linked to where you can click it actually here but I was my plan was to be able to just drop it into an excel sheet. Then you click the URL, you can get the image. Yeah, it's kind of it's kind of janky but

Matthias Miller  09:57
well sweet this Now you say

Speaker 1  10:03
you say we well I mean even if we could actually build a word export of some type to actually do this I still have to figure out which image and want to drop in on the word I'd have to do I want to do that. So what do

Matthias Miller  10:15
you do all images and I don't think there's a really good way to do this. I think you have to I mean, these things are living in s3 I think it would be easier to would you do it if you really wanted to do it Google doc ideas of the terrible terrible idea it's not super maintainable or you give you know just create a whiskey little thing that lets you store the images you could do a

Speaker 1  10:53
but that's a that's an interesting laugh there's no way there's no way to do this as part of like Google Sheets for this this the script would automatically pull them into Google Sheets with it oh boy What what are you what are you attempting now?

Matthias Miller  11:54
Actually meet all of these

Unknown Speaker  11:56
no I don't

Matthias Miller  12:00
so then we will have not showing them here we will do. Let me go into here and drill here downloads

Matthias Miller  13:08
can you just copy this into I really want to know if there's a

Unknown Speaker  13:17
little bit more comfortable with me. Where was I? You better wonder if I can do this on in plain text

Matthias Miller  13:51
just to be in Malmo we're here make me feel at least a little bit better than genetic completely and that's a little bit of a philosophical thing

Matthias Miller  14:45
but now the sizes are wrong. We'll just exercises you just go over here and you do and create a blank document you fix it up

Unknown Speaker  16:14
Alright, where did you save that thing?

Matthias Miller  16:19
You're gonna like this is here Okay, so what you're gonna have to do is here let me

Matthias Miller  16:39
download it it's gonna download as a text file and then just rename it to dot HTML instead

Unknown Speaker  16:49
wait way okay so what did you send me? Oh wait it's holler where is this okay so it isn't Alright hold on a second

Matthias Miller  17:11
if you want the one without the gas prompts

Speaker 1  17:21
would you call this thing it's it's in the logistics folder

Unknown Speaker  17:24
right the new

Unknown Speaker  17:26
Oh new HTML got it all right, so they said the aspirants okay got it

Matthias Miller  17:34
oops, that was what was right What did I do wrong

Matthias Miller  17:44
Oh, that's the ampersand is wrong. It should be probably that last link would be the link to bookmark

Unknown Speaker  17:59
and you said rename it to eat dot HTML?

Unknown Speaker  18:02
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  18:21
What am I doing wrong?

Unknown Speaker  18:23
I don't understand. How are you?

Speaker 1  18:29
I'm stupid. Okay. Explain it to me. Like I'm stupid. What am I doing? Here? Why didn't it Rename? Really? You want me to?

Unknown Speaker  18:38
Yeah.

Speaker 1  18:42
You said name. It's a dot HTML, right? The temporary blah, blah, blah to that dot dot HTML.

Matthias Miller  18:47
Were you able to remove the dot txt from the end as well?

Speaker 1  18:50
No, probably not where? Okay, I need to show where's my view

Matthias Miller  18:54
show your file extensions? Yes, yes. Yes.

Speaker 1  18:57
So file name extensions. Oh. Of course it won't work if it's dot HTML dot txt. Yes.

Matthias Miller  19:12
Bingo. How about that

Matthias Miller  19:24
Well, how about that? How about that? How about it?

Speaker 1  19:30
How did you how did you edit the How did you edit the size of the pictures?

Matthias Miller  19:36
I just pasted them when I pasted them in the auto resized.

Speaker 1  19:40
Oh, then you just do CTRL A and then drop it into a text document? Is what you're doing? Yeah. Got it. Sweet, I'm gonna play around with that.

Matthias Miller  20:04
The types of things I get in trouble for creating

Unknown Speaker  20:08
Why are you going to get into

Matthias Miller  20:14
that I want it nobody finds out about it. Just creating HTML, again, you know, using this to export HTML that you know finagle stuff around things are not a terrible solution it just when it comes down to maintaining it, there's not a lot of people who can maintain it. But you know, this is the source report that works great.

Speaker 1  20:36
This is this is why this is this is this is this is why I said I needed you because I couldn't do this

Matthias Miller  20:53
what most people do this.

Unknown Speaker  20:57
Okay, that is that is fair.

Matthias Miller  21:01
It's plenty. Okay. Sweet. Good. Awesome. Well, we got the we got what you asked for in the first 10 minutes and you didn't ask for it.

Speaker 1  21:11
Yeah, it's just a matter of now. It's just a matter of workflow like, which is going to be easy to dump in into documents. Yeah. Okay, sweet. Awesome. Cool. Thank you, sir.

Matthias Miller  21:24
You bet. Thanks. Bye.
