Unknown Speaker  00:19
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

Matthias Miller  00:25
do you get your contract definitions in? I did. Dude, you're

Speaker 1  00:29
amazing. Are you on the are you on your phone? Or what's the deal?

Matthias Miller  00:33
I am on my phone. I was hanging out at the courthouse and deep in the weeds and something and time disappeared, and I've got one block to walk back.

Unknown Speaker  00:43
All right? Well,

Speaker 1  00:46
I'm gonna call my, I'm gonna call my, my my contract definitions 90% accurate, because I still think there's some things I need to I have a feeling some things are going to change, but I think they're there. We're good enough to move forward. I gotta say this. I in the good portion this day after I got contracts definitions done, I was quickly putting in manufacturers and dealers and sales people. And I'm telling you, man, we created the coolest little CRM thing in here ever. It tickles me sorry in where and only it's great. It's a great little it's like you can do dealers assigned to rental companies and manufacturers, and manufacturers assigned to rental companies and sales people assigned to like. It just makes sense, and it just makes it

Matthias Miller  01:45
happy. Imagine it making sense. What a novel concept.

Speaker 1  01:48
Well, I get, I get really excited about the point when we get to the point where we can start running reporting on this level of information. Yeah, oh man, I cannot wait. I want to go run past I want to go run past dues on dealerships. I want to go run past dues on sales people. I want to run P L's on dealerships and sales peoples and manufacturers and Exactly, exactly.

Matthias Miller  02:15
And then you want to go find out and say, Hey guys, pick up the phone, be like, Hey, what are you doing differently? How do you I don't know well,

Speaker 1  02:26
especially when you get into, like, first payment defaults and some of these types of things. It's like, when you if you can go, if you can go, run reporting and very quickly, spot for dealerships that are doing really well, that have low percentages of first payment defaults versus higher first payment defaults, and then it's like, Hey, what's

Matthias Miller  02:43
going on? Yeah, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  02:47
Yeah. Makes me happy.

Speaker 2  02:49
Makes me happy. Happy. I'm literally slapping

Speaker 1  02:53
a whole bunch of this stuff in. And I'm going to hand this off to some RTO people and say, can you go fill in the addresses and phone numbers and emails of all these people? And somebody's going to roll their eyes big time at me, but it's going to be great, and you can

Matthias Miller  03:06
send them thank you cards at the end

Speaker 1  03:08
of the year, thank you for selling. Yeah, that's true. That is very true. All right. Nick we should be, we should be ready to dive back into putting contracts out there or trying to import contracts,

Unknown Speaker  03:28
all right, like my

Matthias Miller  03:31
computer getting set up.

Speaker 2  03:37
Nick Do you want to drive? Or you want me to drive? I'm fine if you drive.

Unknown Speaker  03:42
Okay, the

Unknown Speaker  03:47
linking of for a bit better than

Speaker 1  03:52
I do. We can't see. We can't see the face. It was still blurred. Who was

Unknown Speaker  03:56
it? It was set tell,

Speaker 1  03:59
tell, Seth. We couldn't tell who he was. Mr. Blurry face.

Speaker 2  04:04
I'm not sure what he's trying to do. He's He's showing

Speaker 1  04:10
the AI is pretty good about, not about blurring out this whatever exactly dude you got it. You got to see this shirt that one of the dealers just gave to me today. We're having, we're having true point dealer days. And he walks in and he hands me this shirt that says, just hit refresh. It's my favorite it's my favorite thing. It's like, they they say, Hey, I can't see this, or I can't do that, or I can't this, or I can't that. And I'm like, Yep, okay, just hit refresh.

Unknown Speaker  04:39
Now, apparently I say it way more than I knew I said it's become a joke. All right,

Matthias Miller  04:56
are we? We're looking at contracts. Wow, this is not confusing at all contacts and contracts and cataracts. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  05:21
we don't have Okay, so the contract,

Matthias Miller  05:29
oh, what's fun? Paid out early contract status.

Matthias Miller  05:50
We can't really set contract status. Wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  06:00
that be the same as contract resolution? Resolution?

Matthias Miller  06:08
Or is it editable, active we would do complete?

Speaker 1  06:15
No, it's, I think the status that RTO essentially is the same as our contract resolution.

Matthias Miller  06:21
So we should, we should map it out to

Unknown Speaker  06:24
Yeah, because paid out early, paid out,

Matthias Miller  06:29
yeah, this is fun. So we have contract resolution. So charge off would be, we don't have a charge off what are

Unknown Speaker  06:51
we going to do for charge offs?

Speaker 1  07:00
We talked about charge UPS not long ago. What were we how are we going to handle this? I'm drawing a complete blank. Did we

Matthias Miller  07:15
really talk about it recently? We talked about it early on, but I

Matthias Miller  07:25
What is paid, what is paid NSF. And

Speaker 1  07:29
so anything with NSF is how they treat contracts, or how they treat how RTO pro looks at an NSF. We really need to convert that. We do not need to load those as a contract. Those are, those are events for us. Wow, because RTO pro treated every NSF like it was a contract, that

Matthias Miller  07:55
makes a lot of sense, because that's what they are. You.

Matthias Miller  08:08
I always sign a contract for

Speaker 3  08:13
NSS Well, I mean, it kind of, I know you

Speaker 1  08:17
signed a check, which is tantamount to a contract. It's a contractual obligation to pay somebody money. So, I mean, it wasn't totally off the wall. I just think it's inefficient.

Matthias Miller  08:27
But, okay, you're way more tolerant than I am. Open sale, that probably is something.

Unknown Speaker  08:37
What is an open sale? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  08:41
When it's windy and you want to go play this on your boat.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
Think that's spelled differently.

Matthias Miller  08:54
Paid an essay. Okay, so we have open. I'm going to let you figure out if we need that.

Unknown Speaker  09:01
Well, open, sale?

Matthias Miller  09:03
Yeah. So pay. That would be a payout.

Speaker 1  09:10
What I would really like is that we go, we import and we establish contracts for what we can actually map out, if we don't have it mapped out that there should be a list of these things that I just need to go chase and figure out

Unknown Speaker  09:25
what, what do we want to do with them?

Matthias Miller  09:28
Picked up. I'm assuming that's a retrieval. Same

Speaker 1  09:31
thing, yeah? Well, yeah, we, we did. There is a distinction in RTO pro retrieval. Well, what does he says picked up versus what's the other status,

Matthias Miller  09:45
like a voluntary versus involuntary?

Speaker 1  09:47
That's exactly what it is, picked up

Matthias Miller  09:52
repossession, yeah, wow, that was definitely before the days of being politically and legally accurate. Okay? So printed. What is printed?

Unknown Speaker  10:02
Do we have?

Speaker 1  10:04
Do we have some that are printed? I don't know. Well, obviously, if it's in the list, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:11
obviously, if it's in the list,

Matthias Miller  10:17
it's when people pay with laundered money. I Ah, okay, that's printed, refunded. What is that?

Speaker 1  10:35
A contract that was closed as refunded? We should, we should consider this some sort of closing event,

Matthias Miller  10:43
isn't it? How's that different than a retrieval? Okay, hold

Speaker 1  10:46
on a second. Didn't, didn't I say Nick, remind me that if a contract is of the status of being closed, obviously we're gonna bring all open contracts. But if it's been closed, then we want to, we only want to bring in the last,

Unknown Speaker  11:02
I think you said since the start of 2024,

Unknown Speaker  11:06
yeah, if it's clear, yeah, two years.

Speaker 1  11:09
Because if we're like some of this old, some of this stuff, we're going to be chasing stuff that's really Old.

Speaker 2  11:56
Okay, well, that'll be that the column header needs to change to contract resolution. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  12:16
Okay, so then we also need to do a Now, the reason why we came here in the first place,

Matthias Miller  12:29
well, actually, don't we? Do we auto detect the contract definition.

Speaker 1  12:36
Well, you're going to have to define based off of, well, you're obviously inferring rental company based off of number. I'm presuming state, state, we have a state contract sales state, I want to say that is, let's use that to define company. Plus state of on the definition, should, should, we should be able to infer based on those two

Matthias Miller  13:11
sales state? You said,

Speaker 1  13:13
Yeah, I mean, let me, let's, let's go back. Let me see the data. Let me make sure that we're not, there's not something a little bit more solid to determine this. I think that's the right thing,

Matthias Miller  13:28
contract,

Matthias Miller  13:38
tax, zone, state, is that what it

Matthias Miller  13:51
would be? Yeah, we're going too fast. Probably, no, you're fine.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
I think I think that's about it. I think I think it's, that's about,

Matthias Miller  14:09
I mean, you have the customer state, but I'm going to guess the tax zone is going to be a more accurate,

Speaker 1  14:14
yes, I think the tax, what was it called, tax sales state, or something like that. This guy,

Unknown Speaker  14:27
sales tax state, yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:30
column 13,

Matthias Miller  14:50
that's not right. Probably take the rate off of there and just call it good,

Matthias Miller  14:59
something like that. It's not to be that fat.

Unknown Speaker  15:06
All right, we have some blanks on this, though,

Unknown Speaker  15:09
where? Well, 11716,

Matthias Miller  15:19
maybe was non taxable.

Unknown Speaker  15:23
Well, that could get complicated. Well,

Matthias Miller  15:25
there's a sales tax, other rate. Maybe it wasn't tied to a jurisdiction or something, tax, tax zone. It's in the tax zone.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
It's in Illinois,

Matthias Miller  15:39
yeah, but we could do. Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  15:52
Is this like, literally, the default, default,

Speaker 1  15:55
I'm a little bit suspicious on the I the methodology of using the sales tax zone, because that could just if it, unless they, unless they go into a different methodology. I mean, we used to, there used to be a zone number based on the state that we used to use. But no, wait a minute in

Matthias Miller  16:14
I mean, the first word appears to be a state, if the first words a state, we can we know it's a state.

Unknown Speaker  16:18
Is it? Is it consistent? Let's go find out.

Matthias Miller  16:27
Actually, this would be RP, source, data, contracts, tax zone, tax left of and

Matthias Miller  16:50
we shouldn't call it v zone, V possible state.

Matthias Miller  17:00
All right, see where it breaks down. Come on, dude. Sorty, sorty. All right, we got a few left. There's

Unknown Speaker  17:15
a couple outliers. Houston.

Matthias Miller  17:19
I mean, we could potentially look it up off the customer.

Speaker 1  17:25
Well, that's, that's, if we can do that, that would, that would give us the secondary

Speaker 2  17:30
one you just had open half through. It isn't that when you just have open half and tn in the X

Speaker 4  17:40
Zone, oh,

Unknown Speaker  17:46
somewhere. Where was I seeing that

Matthias Miller  17:48
tn in the tax center was, why is it not okay?

Matthias Miller  17:58
Why is it not what's it doing? Then, look tax expression.

Matthias Miller  18:13
That one's a state, okay, so it's getting Some kind of

Matthias Miller  18:30
max zoom to SL ID,

Matthias Miller  18:47
the rates match. So the zone state is blank on the zone. Well, I mean, this is easy.

Speaker 1  19:14
I mean, for that matter, if you tell me, if you tell me which zone it is, I can go update an RTO Pro and push a run, a run, a task.

Matthias Miller  19:24
Oh, let's do this. Okay, that's Michigan, dude, dude. Tax zone. TJ, that's nothing, nothing. I have no idea where TJ is. Tax jar,

Unknown Speaker  19:38
yeah, probably so

Unknown Speaker  19:40
which that's unhelpful,

Matthias Miller  19:42
but we can't, we could still get it off the off the customer,

Speaker 1  19:46
yeah, if you can infer it off the customer, that's that would be the the other way to, yeah,

Speaker 2  19:53
to go about this. Do.

Speaker 2  20:20
In the then

Matthias Miller  20:32
we have a customer on these

Unknown Speaker  20:36
Having a contract without a customer.

Matthias Miller  20:41
5813, is the account

Unknown Speaker  20:43
that I mean that should cross reference to a customer.

Matthias Miller  20:47
Let's go into our

Speaker 1  20:51
previous account number 5813 if you can cross reference that to previous account number on the contact record.

Matthias Miller  20:57
Well, I was going to start by Going into the this guy, customers,

Matthias Miller  21:19
that's the

Matthias Miller  21:25
Ah, okay, So then contacts customers, surely we have a Okay, fine.

Matthias Miller  21:46
Yeah, huh, so let's go into here. Let's go into customers.

Matthias Miller  22:07
You, my friend.

Unknown Speaker  22:16
Why? Why is he not written?

Matthias Miller  22:23
I don't know. Maybe we just need to rerun it.

Speaker 2  22:26
That was the previous account number. Is something entirely different. You're looking at the silver limb ID. Oh, this guy,

Speaker 4  22:40
right? Good catch.

Matthias Miller  22:45
Here we go. Brian, I don't know for some reason you ever got imported. Let's just go import him.

Unknown Speaker  22:56
Rare that steak again.

Matthias Miller  22:59
Go, dude. Should we have an x 30 list Nick that we can trigger from the script to push it across, push all these into the from, sorry, wow, I can't words. I Yes, wow. This is slow. Should we have an x 30 list that runs after we push RP source data in that we can use to trigger the full sync across into the live system? Yes, please. If you build they put together the x 30 list. I'll step it into the nightly update.

Speaker 2  23:45
Get this the extra list should just be running these user expertise,

Matthias Miller  23:49
these user expertise in a sane order. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

Matthias Miller  23:59
Well, do you go harvest some coffee beans?

Speaker 1  24:07
Okay, so then the we read, okay, Nick, Nick and I ran into this. Why is this thing so slow?

Matthias Miller  24:18
Well, my grandma's slow, but she's old.

Unknown Speaker  24:24
Well, what am

Unknown Speaker  24:26
I supposed to learn from that statement? I

Matthias Miller  24:29
don't know. It's supposed to be a joke.

Unknown Speaker  24:36
Can you build can you build

Speaker 2  24:38
a trailer? Not everything around here is a learning opportunity.

Speaker 1  24:41
Well, I was going to ask you for build a trigger that that fires the laughing. The laugh import

Matthias Miller  24:48
the laugh tracks. What is it doing? I'm

Matthias Miller  24:59
going to. Yes, it's something with these RG imports that's just, I don't know, just the process by which we handle them, and I would suspect if no, I

Matthias Miller  25:56
can't tell You beyond that, I think it's the RG import somehow.

Matthias Miller  26:12
Okay, so the good news is, then we have a

Matthias Miller  26:29
macro, look state, so for some of these guys, then while that thing runs, What do you hate about me now, contract tape, we do not have a contract type. Contract type is a

Matthias Miller  26:52
contract state. I have contract state. What is your problem? Contract I wonder if there's an issue with the order in which we're signing these things we should probably do primary customer.

Matthias Miller  27:16
Primary customer,

Matthias Miller  27:26
the asset would make sense next,

Matthias Miller  27:36
asset value,

Unknown Speaker  27:40
asset value

Matthias Miller  27:42
rental company would make sense.

Unknown Speaker  28:00
State

Matthias Miller  28:16
let's at least start with that.

Matthias Miller  28:25
So Illinois contract type it still doesn't like

Matthias Miller  28:41
Dwayne's Awesome rental company

Speaker 1  29:01
is this where it's RTO versus RTR, and you can infer that based off of a data column, wherever it just says a whole bunch of Rs, but I mean that being said, They should be all of them should be ours. I

Matthias Miller  29:23
I see, do you know which data column,

Unknown Speaker  29:25
if you show me the if you go, Okay, go back to the top. Yeah, contact, hit the drop down.

Unknown Speaker  29:37
I'm gonna see what else is there

Matthias Miller  29:42
nrst, NSF,

Unknown Speaker  29:45
I don't remember the s and t are.

Unknown Speaker  29:48
We had talked about this

Matthias Miller  29:52
to prove sale S is a sale and T is a so. About making things up, but kind of

Unknown Speaker  30:06
R T

Unknown Speaker  30:07
is rent to rent.

Unknown Speaker  30:10
R is rent to own. What were the types R,

Matthias Miller  30:16
R T, S and N, S, n

Speaker 1  30:20
is n, is NSF, I don't know what S is.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Why don't you tell me what S is? I mean, isn't

Matthias Miller  30:28
that just a product sale? Probably. Again, I'm making assumptions, but

Unknown Speaker  30:35
it's a good assumption,

Matthias Miller  30:38
until I prove it. Prove it wrong. But

Unknown Speaker  30:42
which had no idea how you're going to handle those wrong guy?

Matthias Miller  30:52
Well, I don't either. So there's that,

Speaker 1  30:56
well, we can, we can, how I can go figure out how many s there are

Matthias Miller  31:01
okay contracts. I closed out my contracts import. It's wildly hard to find Okay. I'm going to capitalize the are in contracts going forward, so that it's contracts,

Matthias Miller  31:19
payment terms. Is that always monthly, or can it be something? I mean, we don't support anything but monthly.

Unknown Speaker  31:27
But what should that be? Yeah. S is retail,

Unknown Speaker  31:32
sorry, payment? What was

Unknown Speaker  31:34
it terms?

Matthias Miller  31:37
Monthly payments? Do

Unknown Speaker  31:39
we have anything besides an M, well, if that's

Matthias Miller  31:42
where it's coming from, then let's just check that we have a B. We have a B. I don't know if we have one of the last two years, but we have

Speaker 1  31:53
a B. Hold on, hold on. We have 1b It was contract status of returned. It was a sale. I think we can disregard it. Monthly, monthly, monthly, monthly, monthly, monthly, monthly, okay, I need the other end of this 6000 whatever. Oh, somewhere, at some point they just go to nothing. Oh, that's when we get to the retails. Everything that's a contract. Yeah, is is monthly. We only have monthlies. B is tight was tied to a sale. There's only one of them. All the rest of them should be blank, and those are all tied to retail sales.

Matthias Miller  32:44
I didn't mean if you silly goose, Hey,

Matthias Miller  33:01
okay, security deposit,

Speaker 1  33:07
we get that information from the security deposit or the customer deposit team, or whatever that whatever the table is that we spent a long time Looking for and we were just chasing our tails. Or

Matthias Miller  33:23
a really wonky state of mind. Okay, so,

Speaker 1  33:28
because you're at the poor house and we don't know what you were actually

Unknown Speaker  33:31
drinking, well,

Matthias Miller  33:34
there was a new barista there, so I have no idea what she put in there.

Unknown Speaker  33:40
It was one of those Irish copies. Huh?

Matthias Miller  33:44
He's either Irish or German. I'm not sure which German determined coffee determined copy. Okay, details, so that's the this guy is what we want to put in. Let's just find a spot.

Matthias Miller  34:11
Okay, so then here, deposit this, this guy, it looks like it could be right? Is that the original is that the original deposit?

Unknown Speaker  34:26
Or is that contract deposits?

Matthias Miller  34:30
Let's throw it in here and see what shows up. I wish there'd be a weight of No. Know Nick, I always try to convert it into a expression that doesn't parse so that it doesn't redo the title for me.

Matthias Miller  34:58
Okay, so. Well, that looks a little concerning. It's always zero. That's probably not quite the right number.

Speaker 1  35:08
So I think we need to get this from the customer deposits table.

Matthias Miller  35:15
I love hunting stuff down. Okay, so cockpit, why would

Speaker 1  35:18
he have a Why would he have a field for it if he didn't store it on the contract?

Matthias Miller  35:24
Is this the original amount?

Unknown Speaker  35:29
No, it would be the security deposit. You

Unknown Speaker  35:35
want me to look it up? You mean this guy. What I

Matthias Miller  35:42
mean off the customer deposits table, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. So now we get to write a fun little expression here.

Speaker 1  35:50
I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump on v2 cloud just to confirm if you can give me a an account number when I, when I

Unknown Speaker  35:56
get 7094

Unknown Speaker  35:58
when you get there, 7094 94

Matthias Miller  36:09
as it's NDX, no, I'm going to guess we don't have a

Speaker 1  36:27
7094 was the contract number, the account number, account number,

Matthias Miller  36:33
you sure? Oh, well, maybe I was looking at the wrong record. Maybe they didn't have a deposit. 5453 54 store, store four. Let me know if you need

Speaker 3  36:43
a different store. Oh, no, we're good. What's the amount? 100 bucks? Yep, yep, that was a deposit still sitting there on the account.

Matthias Miller  36:53
One, okay, but do we have one that has lost its deposit since then? Like, we can make sure it's the original deposit amount, not the current deposit amount.

Speaker 1  37:03
I don't know that it makes any difference. It's a stored.

Matthias Miller  37:07
Yes, it

Speaker 1  37:09
Well, the question is, was he, was he rewriting the record, or was he creating a new line? We'd have to go look for duplicates if we're going to, if we check that it's

Matthias Miller  37:18
not, he's not creating a new line. So then he's written.

Unknown Speaker  37:21
So any deposit amount gets written on this record,

Matthias Miller  37:25
I would basically update it so you're assuming this is a current deposit amount.

Speaker 1  37:30
I would like to presume that, yes, you can throw another one at me and we can double check.

Matthias Miller  37:36
Well, I mean, but do we have one? That's what I was trying to say, is, do we have a closed contract or something where,

Unknown Speaker  37:43
well, closed contract should be a deposit amount of

Matthias Miller  37:46
zero, okay, well like 3746

Unknown Speaker  37:50
let's go look at 3746 let's go look as repossesses That used to be 173 89 it was spent 173, when we re put

Matthias Miller  38:04
the building, and now zero. So this is current deposit amount. Current deposit amount, yes, so do we just enter the contract as being zero? How do we get the when we're entering the contract, we want the original security deposit amount? Don't we? What was his original amount?

Speaker 1  38:25
171, okay, we would have to cross reference this with the the payments table and see if he actually defines the in the payments table as well. I had, I'm suspicious that he is. Where's his? History, history. So search your account number, whatever. What did I say? It is? 37463746,

Unknown Speaker  38:59
this guy? Okay, so how many 374 sixes are there, though? All right,

Matthias Miller  39:10
let's go find 374 sixes.

Matthias Miller  39:17
Let's sort you the other way. Silly goose.

Unknown Speaker  39:22
Hey, thank you.

Matthias Miller  39:34
Okay, fine, I'll just scroll. I wanted to scroll. Just didn't know how to ask for.

Unknown Speaker  40:12
12345, Almost there, almost there, almost there.

Unknown Speaker  40:26
90,000 records. Oh, my 3746,

Unknown Speaker  40:30
you're going too far. Oh, there you back up a little bit.

Speaker 1  40:34
All right, okay, we want a date of 12, 2921

Matthias Miller  40:45
3746, what's these guys? We have of 1229, what? What year 21 Okay, look for the R, right here,

Speaker 1  41:00
1229, that is so there should have been, there should be two, two transactions that are labeled r7, 7320, should be the last five digits of the of the of the receipt, number

Matthias Miller  41:16
r3, 746, there's

Speaker 1  41:18
only one Then, then he's not storing this in the the history table.

Matthias Miller  41:24
There's only I'm only seeing 1am. I missing something? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  41:27
do a Google do a Google search. Do a search for R 010077320

Speaker 2  41:36
R 001 Nope. R 0100773200 00773200320320,

Unknown Speaker  41:49
wow, oh, crikey. I was hoping it wouldn't go do that. That was dumb. I guess it would kick off a hole in that tie.

Matthias Miller  42:00
Another search. Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  42:10
RP, source, data, history, you

Unknown Speaker  42:14
see, yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  42:16
Well, I do it though. Okay. Well, here's two. We have a p and an R, okay,

Speaker 1  42:24
a P and an R. Why are they one? Why is 1p and one r1?

Matthias Miller  42:28
Doesn't have a date on it? 1899 1230,

Unknown Speaker  42:31
yeah. Transaction Date. 1229, they're both 1220, nines.

Matthias Miller  42:35
Wait, 12, oh, there's Transaction Date, okay, oh, it's not due. That's why

Speaker 1  42:41
both of them are our ones labeled P. The P is the payment, and the which is the first month, the rent. The R is the deposit. A 173, 89 so he is storing this in the in the history, which is phenomenal. Payments should be labeled P's. Let me just double check this to verify I'm not telling you a lie here. Where is this

Matthias Miller  43:04
so but where does it get converted from this to a

Speaker 1  43:09
get spent? You have to hunt for receipt number. I'll give you the receipt number. C, Charlie 020085194, 20085194,

Matthias Miller  43:22
I have no idea that's right, but You betcha. So

Unknown Speaker  43:33
then the P

Speaker 1  43:35
so when they when they spent the deposit, it looks like they also had, okay, the payment would be the amount the negative transaction is spending it out of the deposit category, and that the P transaction is the payment amount that it's applied to. What's the C, that's the that's the spending the deposit. Okay, so we

Matthias Miller  44:00
want to add all the R's and subtract.

Speaker 1  44:04
Why is the P negative? Am I wrong? I might be wrong. I'm

Matthias Miller  44:15
okay. Let's not do

Speaker 1  44:18
let's do this. Let's go back and let's refine your refine your expression to look at the contract number or the account number, whichever it is. And let's just, let's look at all the transactions and sort them by their payment date.

Matthias Miller  44:37
You're just being obnoxious account. Oh, well, maybe that is a number. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  44:46
then Yep, sort them by the transaction date.

Matthias Miller  44:50
Okay, so here, I mean obviously, it's obvious that the C somewhere. Are you sure C isn't a. Know, why would that be a negative?

Speaker 1  45:08
You have this sorted from oldest date at the top to newest date at the bottom. Got it reverse it because I'm used to seeing it that way. Okay, just because I'm used to seeing the history this way. Okay, so, yeah, that that mirrors. Okay, so I don't understand why. I don't understand his transaction type. That is so confusing, the C's and the P's, why he's doing the P is a negative transaction, but you are mirroring exactly what I'm showing on their history data.

Matthias Miller  45:39
So how do I know the original? I mean, because you could pay into the deposit. So presumably you would look at the earliest Transaction Date and look for any on that date that have,

Speaker 1  45:54
let's do this. Sort it by your, by your very first column, so that we're 100% in the order that this happened. Is that right? No, it's not.

Matthias Miller  46:06
Oh, that's not. We're

Unknown Speaker  46:07
not sorting correctly.

Matthias Miller  46:10
Somebody decided to make this a string that's a silver limb ID. That's not going to help. We need you.

Speaker 1  46:20
Hokey. Do we have? Do we have the hook Yes, we have a hooky. Sorted by the hooky. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  46:34
Okay, okay, the P and the R,

Matthias Miller  46:45
this is not taxable.

Speaker 1  46:49
Security deposit is not taxable. You're correct, not until you spend it. I mean, look for the event at the very, very top, for which one applies tax. When that, when the, when the, when the, when the, when the security deposit comes in, right? We don't charge tax on it. We store the money and we

Matthias Miller  47:07
comes out. I think this is the security deposit. I agree. But then why? How do you identify this as the security deposit? Because there is no history amount. It's a $0 history amount. So you take, take total minus tax, minus other, minus TRP, minus amount, which is your security deposit amount for the row. Let's try this. Tax you have the amount you You, you, you, and you. And now we're going to do a sum of u minus u minus u minus u minus u I'm one more you.

Matthias Miller  48:09
Now we're going to go force this guy to sort this way all the time, because why not. And then we're going to go over to your security deposit, and here is the security deposit, amount of each payment.

Speaker 1  48:24
So 173 in, 173 89 out, yeah.

Matthias Miller  48:32
And we're looking for P transaction types, yeah.

Speaker 1  48:40
But the rest of our transaction types too, right?

Matthias Miller  48:43
But, I mean, but we'll just grab it off the and this is the earliest, I mean, can we always just look at the earliest record and get the security deposit off that amount?

Speaker 1  48:58
That's scary, because I or I don't that's that's implying that the Hokey is always looking at the security deposit amount as first, and Lord knows,

Matthias Miller  49:16
would you okay? But do you want to look at the first date of transaction and get the security deposit. Of all those, like every all security deposits off 1229, 2021,

Speaker 1  49:31
of the earliest date. I mean, yeah, there's going to be security pods going to happen in the first date. Now, that's not to say, that's not to say they didn't add to the security deposit throughout the history. That's the other thing that we're going to have to try and figure out.

Matthias Miller  49:45
Well, that's fine. We're not looking for that. I mean, the only real reason we need this is for CRAs,

Speaker 1  49:55
and I don't even know I'd have to go digging for an account the CRA. See how that's actually done in the history. Wait, do I have that readily available? I'm gonna go

Matthias Miller  50:05
find out. No, don't wait. Seems like it could be a useful thing to chase down. Yes, it

Unknown Speaker  50:11
would be. Give me a minute. I think I have this

Unknown Speaker  50:17
sequel strings. I

Speaker 1  50:31
open contracts with CRA. Let's look at account. Let's, let's rerun your expression, your subset for 4683, account number 46834683,

Matthias Miller  50:49
by the way, I'm gonna release two instrumental albums. The first one's just going to be called strings. The second one's going to be called sequel strings.

Matthias Miller  51:02
Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  51:05
okay, this

Matthias Miller  51:07
one, okay, so this guy, but let's go look at the account.

Unknown Speaker  51:11
Yep, that's where I'm heading,

Matthias Miller  51:16
because there's nothing here that says, Oh goodness gracious. Unless there's a payment.

Speaker 1  51:28
He literally calls it a deposit, just like this, like he in the in the history. He calls it he looks like a regular security deposit. How dumb is that? Do you want an answer?

Unknown Speaker  51:49
You're in rare form today. Are you

Unknown Speaker  51:56
also going to start

Unknown Speaker  51:57
a comedy channel called

Unknown Speaker  52:01
sword and strings? Sort of strings,

Matthias Miller  52:04
something more like the out of sort strings,

Speaker 1  52:08
numb sword string, numb sword string,

Unknown Speaker  52:13
good comedy channel,

Matthias Miller  52:17
we man, it's so numbing, you won't have any feeling left when we're done. Okay, so the I mean, but there's no usage event as a side note. It just,

Speaker 1  52:40
but I believe on the contract that 30 60608, is then stored. Sorry, it's 2068, 50, Oh, right. Well, what now,

Matthias Miller  52:54
hold on a second right, because you probably have a payment

Unknown Speaker  52:56
taken out. Um,

Matthias Miller  52:59
2068, 50, that doesn't make sense.

Speaker 3  53:03
No, why is he only showing a it's showing on the

Speaker 1  53:09
contract info now, deposit, pay. Oh, sorry, I'm I'm just not very smart. Yeah, 3806 80. That is. What is what is it about? Or paid down? I think that is a field on the contract record. It or so if you go over the contract record, there's an paid down. I think it's called contracts.

Matthias Miller  53:34
Okay, so, and are we checking that in our import for CRAs,

Unknown Speaker  53:38
we need to that's, that's how you define as a CRA?

Matthias Miller  53:42
Well, we are have a contract type, types,

Speaker 1  53:46
not going to tell you it's a CRA. We need the, there's a, there should be a column called paid down. It's the column 11.

Speaker 1  53:59
Yeah, hate town, yeah. Dollar value should match to the deposit amount in the history.

Matthias Miller  54:09
So let's, oh, I mean, do you want me to you want me to look it up?

Unknown Speaker  54:14
Um, I mean, it's, you don't care. Small Chase.

Matthias Miller  54:21
You I am losing myself here. So paid down. Well, let's start by. Can we start by finding the we need?

Matthias Miller  54:44
Index, fine field. We probably don't have any indexes on this. RP source, histories by contract. RP history, silver, Lim, ID, okay, so we need a model.

Matthias Miller  55:05
A bloke deposits by contract and date. And this be a RP, source, data, history, it would be all. It would be a sum. It would be this expression. It would be grouped by string, RP, source, data, contract, contracts no history. Contract plus tab plus state, sort, string, RP, source, data, history, date, trans date. So then here we would do model, group rank, group ranked. Name we want name, one string, source data,

Matthias Miller  56:38
and then we want model, group, value, I guess we want that, rather than

Unknown Speaker  56:48
model group ranked

Matthias Miller  56:52
nth largest value. Wait, we don't want the nth largest

Speaker 1  57:00
what's a what's a group rank, not a group right now, I'm don't answer the question. It's not, it's not worth talking. It just looked funny.

Matthias Miller  57:11
Largest, the first, largest, second, largest, third, largest. So, really? Okay? Assign V group count equals group count. Load deposits by here. Let's call this V prefix. Wow. Nick is going to know models better than he ever hoped.

Matthias Miller  57:57
String is a string. Well, not sure why that's a string and the other one isn't, but another string parameter, okay, well, fine, that way I thought I was comparing on the contract is a string, but The okay, it's fine.

Matthias Miller  58:28
Trans date is also a string.

Matthias Miller  58:49
Y, but the Translate is a sorted string, so we can just treat it like a string as long as our

Matthias Miller  59:23
we don't really care about the date anyway. Here, model group, value group ranked, value group prefix, all right.

Matthias Miller  59:44
And this guy needs to come over here with commas and then, oh, that's going to be all.

Matthias Miller  59:58
That killed the report.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
You mean the speed, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:00:20
What other options do we have? We could do it. It might be faster to do a string table. I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
Whoo, wait, let's do this.

Matthias Miller  1:01:24
That's that should help. Let's see if it helps. Oh, okay, not really. I

Matthias Miller  1:02:07
know

Matthias Miller  1:02:42
Hey, you let me know. Hey, that's fast. Okay, fine, we'll do it that way. There you go. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:02:54
probably do this just to be Safe. Oh, but no,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:18
let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
My call I am yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:03:40
but I hadn't. I hadn't. I hadn't planned on it, but now that you say it, that'd be great. I'd like to go with you, huh? Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker 1  1:03:57
Oh my goodness, I'm sitting over here on my microphone or my computer, I must sound terrible.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:09
That should make me sound a whole lot better.

Matthias Miller  1:04:13
Are you finally present with us?

Speaker 3  1:04:14
Sorry? Why didn't you say something? I can finally

Matthias Miller  1:04:18
take you seriously. I know.

Speaker 4  1:04:20
Should have been like, I think you're on a computer microphone or something. It probably sounded like I'm halfway across

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
the room. It actually wasn't bad. Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:34
well, decent microphones. I guess

Matthias Miller  1:04:38
it's actually sometimes. I mean, if I have any audio trouble, it's almost the best thing to go to. Pipe list by contract, we look at the contract give the last deposit day, sorry, B, earliest deposit date. Do. Except we don't want deposit date. We want the earliest trans dates.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:05
Yeah, their earliest history. Date,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
hist trans.

Matthias Miller  1:05:18
Let's just call this men. I

Speaker 4  1:05:20
Okay, fine. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:05:51
we'll get there. Okay, so this is the so now we have the earliest deposit date, then we get the deposits by which is the sum based on that to have that and theoretically now should still be fast.

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
Do we have this Uber's name?

Speaker 3  1:06:14
Which one? Probst, Fred? Probst, P, R, O, B, S, T,

Matthias Miller  1:06:26
I'm in the wrong place.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:34
Where's the column?

Matthias Miller  1:06:35
$4,000 CRA, okay,

Speaker 1  1:06:43
that would have been the okay. That would be the original amount. Well, the actual amount of the CRA is 3806 80. But I'm presuming it's somehow figuring out to do 3008 806 80, plus the 193 20, which would make the 4000

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
something is netchai.

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
Is this? This guy? Okay? So he had

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
I'm slowly confused.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
He's active,

Speaker 1  1:07:37
so he hasn't the purchase reserve has not been paid out yet.

Matthias Miller  1:07:41
I think I'm only looking at the I'm still confused. How, how am I coming up with the 4000 Oh, well, maybe I should use the that

Matthias Miller  1:08:00
might make a little difference. Bread, 3806 80.

Speaker 1  1:08:09
All right, so give me, let's look at the one right below it. What's that? What's the 5169 is that the contract?

Matthias Miller  1:08:16
Yeah, that's the asset ID, 5384

Unknown Speaker  1:08:20
5384 384 Come on, 5384

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
let's just double check his

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
what you sure it's 5384

Matthias Miller  1:08:38
Oh, never mind. Douglas Layton, Douglas, where are you? Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:08:49
I can, I can look it up by the last name too. You said, l, a, y, t o, n, Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:08:59
where's the count number is

Speaker 1  1:09:01
Douglas Layton, I have him, 4684

Unknown Speaker  1:09:07
showing a customer purchase over 3653

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
33 Okay, so now The next thing is, I'm assuming that we use search contracts. Contract type, let's go find a CRA sky and this guy and CRA cash do Okay, so over here? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:09:52
that's not what I wanted.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
It's really not what I want to say. Oh, I don't care as much about that one, though, this is what I really care about. Okay, so if is NA, if not is NA, RP, source data contracts

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
a down, then this is, let's create a macro for this. So this would be local RP, source data, or just local contract.

Matthias Miller  1:11:04
A deposit or CRA, and then this guy, so this guy here becomes,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
but that's incorrect.

Speaker 1  1:11:21
It's not CRA cash due. CRA cash due is the total amount that they paid. So if you go back and look at your our CRAs under Dwayne's awesome RTO company, the CRA amount without taxes, 1706, 53, and the amount that you're currently chasing is that amount. So I'm not sure how we so you almost need to extrapolate the entire cash due and somehow separate out the payments.

Matthias Miller  1:11:45
Well, I mean, we could do the full payment, yeah. Okay, so let's do if it's if it's not the security deposit that works for this guy. Stop it.

Matthias Miller  1:12:14
This would be

Matthias Miller  1:12:37
but we want the we don't want tax on it, right?

Speaker 1  1:12:46
There would be, there would be tax in the first payment that's coming out of the CRA. So the whole ball, the whole ball of wax with the first payment and the deposit should equal an amount that's going to get stomped in the CRA cash due. We're going to have to infer the rest of this out based on calculation of the payment, etc, etc, to get to the actual CRA amount that's RTO pro stored.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
I hope I made sense. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
just going to duplicate this between the two places. Okay, so when I'm on the that's the cash due when I'm on here, then we're going to, if it's paid down, we're not going to do anything. But then over here, we're going to do this guy. And this is like, look, all right, Fred, we're coming back for you. So Fred's now 4000 Douglas is 4000

Speaker 1  1:13:57
Okay, hold on, let me. Let me go and see what I'm assuming. So let's go find somebody else. Let me just, let me just, let me, let me manual math. This just to make sure that we're correct. 365, 3.33

Matthias Miller  1:14:11
plus three, four, 6.67 should be Yep, 4000 okay. But then the security deposit is blank, but we have a CRA amount for standard contracts. Why do we have a Oh? Because we're doing this, if not, is an A or zero, if

Matthias Miller  1:14:47
Okay, Richard, coming for you again. Sorry, Fred, okay, so now, can you go look up James Ward.

Speaker 1  1:15:07
James Ward, okay, he's repossessed.

Matthias Miller  1:15:12
285, 40, sounds like an exorcism gone wrong.

Speaker 1  1:15:22
8544 Wow, wow, wow. I don't even know how to even look at this thing. This is an ugly piece of something. I can find

Matthias Miller  1:15:37
another one if you want to look up a different one.

Speaker 1  1:15:39
Yeah, I don't even This one's hard to interpret because it's a repossessionary, ins and outs and ugliness that took place. I'm not sure

Matthias Miller  1:15:47
what retrieval. Well, let's just sort by security deposit, deposit and find something that's not a retrieval, I guess. Okay. EPO, Jonathan, I don't even know how to mass duty, M, a s s u t t i

Unknown Speaker  1:16:09
m, a s s u t

Matthias Miller  1:16:11
i u t t i My mom was trying to spell Mississippi and gut.

Speaker 3  1:16:19
Okay, all right, the original amount of, well, okay, what? What should we be at right now? Are you showing

Matthias Miller  1:16:30
4895 49 as the original amount?

Speaker 1  1:16:38
That would have not been the original cash due

Matthias Miller  1:16:41
not the cash due. That's security deposit.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
This is not a CRA.

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
This is not a CRA, yeah, 4895 49

Unknown Speaker  1:16:51
and then it was spent,

Speaker 1  1:16:54
and then it was paid back in and then spent again. Really weird, really odd, but yes, okay, so now 49

Matthias Miller  1:17:05
Look at that. Now let's see what blows up.

Matthias Miller  1:17:15
Security deposit is, oh, we should do an NA to zero if it's

Speaker 1  1:17:19
Nick I think you and I would have been lost a whole hour and two or an hour and a half ago. Exactly.

Speaker 1  1:17:38
This guy. Has anybody ever Matthias? Anybody ever told you really smart?

Matthias Miller  1:17:43
My parents actually tried to avoid telling me that interesting.

Speaker 3  1:17:48
They didn't want it to get to my head, you know. Okay, do you

Matthias Miller  1:17:58
interesting? Or if they did. It was always like, like, just, you know, remember, we're it was always like, remember, God gave it to you, basically, I mean, it, that was, that was the only reference ever, yeah, did

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
you get your test scores back?

Matthias Miller  1:18:14
Yeah, we did. Well, not achievement tennis, no, no achievement test until years later. But our, our high school class, AC T's were all like 30 fours. Like we averaged 34 as a class. We hit a hit a record, as you should. So I think I got a couple 30 sixes in the to my subjects, 35 or 30 sixes. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:18:46
um, all right, well,

Matthias Miller  1:19:03
so let's try this again.

Matthias Miller  1:19:18
Status is a required field. Hey, we are getting places. So now we got to come up with the status.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:30
What are our statuses? Contract status, active, pending, complete, pending retrieval, complete, canceled.

Matthias Miller  1:19:46
Why would we just look at our resolution, calculated resolution, and choose between like active or resolved?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
We really should. We should probably make. More statuses. Is that a is that a locked list? Probably so

Matthias Miller  1:20:08
as of now, yeah, it is. See if you make it invalid and then fix it. It stays there. If is, I know, because 20 years ago I was working in that code. I that

Speaker 3  1:20:27
code, what did you say? If you make it invalid, then it's okay.

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
If you want to keep if you want to keep the heading, then you make this expression be invalid, and then you come back and fix it to what it needs to be, and the heading stays. Otherwise it clears the heading.

Speaker 1  1:20:45
Oh, interesting. You know how many times it aggravates me when it when it clears the heading and writes my expression into it?

Matthias Miller  1:20:53
Hacks, yeah, exactly. So then just go, go, just throw, you know, Throw it. Throw an A on it, tab off. Come back, fix it, and then change it and then change it to what you want, and boom, it'll stay hack. Okay, so I'm just running it off contract resolution. If I went to if, if you want to, I can put in a, do you want a to do in here for you to come back with? Status? Better statuses?

Speaker 1  1:21:20
Well, okay, we're we are saying status plus resolution tells the story.

Matthias Miller  1:21:26
Basically, I mean, basically what I'm doing is I'm coming up with a resolution. We don't have a resolution currently for charge offs and skips, which is a problem, but which is a separate conversation. But apart from that, if we have a resolution, then it's complete. Of resolution, then it's complete. Otherwise, it's active.

Speaker 1  1:21:46
For the sake of the import, we should consider combining statuses and resolutions.

Matthias Miller  1:21:53
It's just, I mean, you could have a waiting to close kind of thing. I mean, the problem is you almost need some kind of closed checkbox, I don't know, like a resolution should only be available when it's complete or when it's pending final sign off. Or, I don't know, I don't

Speaker 1  1:22:11
know, we should probably make a note to rethink that. Something in the spec somewhere to go and rethink that.

Matthias Miller  1:22:19
Rethink contract status and contract resolution and how they work together or don't correct. All right? Well, no records match. How about, how about, we send it security deposit is a required field, okay. What's your problem? Matt, har. Can you imagine having that name and somebody says, har, har, okay,

Speaker 1  1:22:44
it's Matt ha R. It's not Matt, har, it's har.

Matthias Miller  1:22:50
He's a pirate. He's a funny pirate. Okay, but why would a CRA, why would a CRA, neat, also need a security deposit? It shouldn't.

Speaker 1  1:23:02
Why is he? Why is he acting like he needs one? Does he have one?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:06
No, he can't

Matthias Miller  1:23:09
think, right? So let's go here.

Matthias Miller  1:23:16
Contract. Hear this guy. CRA No, not you. Only asset, cash, price. Wait

Matthias Miller  1:23:39
a minute, what am I missing? Security deposit. Security

Unknown Speaker  1:23:57
Deposits not in cash. Do

Matthias Miller  1:24:04
CRA cash to is in here.

Matthias Miller  1:24:21
Why is it not setting CRA cache to well, we'll fix it. So we'll do oops.

Matthias Miller  1:24:35
Not you? Yeah, I know I'll get there. If missing is, yeah, we'll skip it, and let's do this. I

Matthias Miller  1:24:54
like it the other way, just because, wait, you'll see in a moment. Hey, look. Parallelism, okay, har, har, where are you?

Speaker 1  1:25:05
I disagree with the number on Har, what's the what's the CRA amount? Was it a CRM, or is it a security deposit amount? Which one

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
can cash due at 1427, 48 oh,

Speaker 1  1:25:35
this is really messy. Really messy. Okay, let me add these numbers together. Just double check you how much you want to bet you're right, but it just looks weird.

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
I don't usually place too many bets on me being right. I'd rather just win the argument.

Speaker 1  1:25:56
1500 is the cash? Is the CRA, or is it security deposit? CRA should be 1500

Matthias Miller  1:26:04
1500 Matt, what are you doing?

Speaker 1  1:26:07
It's really weird because there's like, two deposit amounts. A, yeah, it's here. I'll show you.

Matthias Miller  1:26:17
He paid on two different days, didn't he?

Speaker 1  1:26:20
And something, something weird,

Matthias Miller  1:26:24
what's his what's his contract, or what it's what's his account?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:29
7083, 70830,

Matthias Miller  1:26:35
my goodness, you're not kidding. It's weird.

Speaker 1  1:26:38
Yeah, this was, this was, this was bad entry, bad contract entry.

Matthias Miller  1:26:46
So you think it's, what do you think his number is?

Speaker 1  1:26:49
I think that the original amount that was, I think the original amount was 1500

Matthias Miller  1:26:57
Okay, the Where do you get the 1500 because there's 1200 used up here. Okay, the

Speaker 1  1:27:02
CRA is the 12, the 1219 30. That was the that was the effective CRA, the 1219, 30. Okay, what are we coming up so the initial payment is a 280 70, 1200 1930, which comes out to 1500 so the initial, the CRA cash due should come out to 1500 we

Matthias Miller  1:27:35
group it by Transaction Date. We reverse it for you. Then we go. And sum these guys, where is your 50? Where's your other 300 coming from? Oh, interesting.

Speaker 1  1:27:58
Yeah, that is ugly. So I'm showing a 280, 70,

Speaker 3  1:28:04
that's also on six, 821, yeah, these guys, okay, yeah, reversed out and back it. Are this? Is this being? Is it secondary? Is it sorting these

Matthias Miller  1:28:16
are all. This is all on the sixth, 20, 21/6 June, 8. I mean, eight. Mean, it's grouped by date. These are all reversals. So we've got, we got 14, 8070, plus, 1930, but what's this? 5322, thrown off the the off it. Wait, the what this guy? This is the problem.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
Wait, scrollsies back to the lefties. So this is on six, 850,

Matthias Miller  1:28:48
what's D? Type A, B, A, D, as in dog. Like dog on it dumb.

Speaker 1  1:28:59
I have no idea. I don't even show a 50 that like in the history from

Unknown Speaker  1:29:06
the account it deleted. It might be, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:29:11
I can exclude the D, and that makes it work. But even R, B, P, B,

Speaker 1  1:29:21
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take a screenshot of what the initial history looks like.

Matthias Miller  1:29:28
53 that D transaction is the thing that's throwing

Unknown Speaker  1:29:31
it off. I'll bet you that D stands for deleted.

Matthias Miller  1:29:34
Well, then let's not do deleted. Let's exclude deleted. Let's exclude what we think is deleted, sure,

Matthias Miller  1:29:48
source, data, history, type, history, ow.

Speaker 1  1:30:06
Man, we are so close. I really want to run this thing, and I gotta drop off here in just a few

Matthias Miller  1:30:11
minutes. Trans, type,

Matthias Miller  1:30:19
okay, let's find all our I should create a macro for this. View, view, view, view,

Matthias Miller  1:30:48
okay, and this guy was Matt r again,

Matthias Miller  1:30:55
let's go look at Matt over here while that's running, 14, 8070, 70. Well, that gets us closer.

Matthias Miller  1:31:13
What am I missing? I

Matthias Miller  1:31:39
total is 1500

Matthias Miller  1:31:51
contract CRA

Matthias Miller  1:31:59
cash to amount we're looking at the earliest historical Transaction Date, looking At the payment amount, at the totals for that date.

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
What am I missing? Nick I feel like I'm because when I if I group him, if I group out the D

Unknown Speaker  1:32:52
record, then you have your 1500

Matthias Miller  1:32:54
then the total comes out, right, trans, type, let's make it rerun. I mean, I'm just I am so

Matthias Miller  1:33:16
I'll pitch it

Speaker 2  1:33:23
apologies, but I am not my eyes glazed over sometimes, I Do not blame you.

Matthias Miller  1:33:39
It Looks like a tax difference.

Matthias Miller  1:34:00
1500 1500 minus 1445, 1485 55 is that what it was, 14 8070 there's no other amount that's close.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:18
You're coming out with what 1500 minus, 14 8070

Matthias Miller  1:34:23
I'm coming out with 14

Unknown Speaker  1:34:25
8070 Yeah, $19.30

Unknown Speaker  1:34:28
difference, right. There it is. 1930 right at the beginning, where there's

Unknown Speaker  1:34:38
Right, right next to Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:34:39
right, right in your this guy? Yeah, why is he hiccuping?

Speaker 1  1:34:54
We spend him at the top then as well the 1200 and the 1930 the. 1930 I don't know what the 1930 is, but it is part of the transaction. Somehow you're not accounting for it.

Speaker 1  1:35:17
Yeah, you have two ends there and one out. So that should that should give you a 1930 some somehow, in your in your macro, you're not accounting for that 1930

Matthias Miller  1:35:33
Okay, so we have a model, a minimum trans date. I'm 99% sure we're getting the right translate, like there's no reason we would be getting anywhere close to this if we weren't. So therefore, it has to be an issue with this in which

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
expand that expression,

Matthias Miller  1:35:57
which one, the one that you're Yeah, it's just it's just a, it's just a, it's literally just a field, oh, I'm sorry, that's all good, like, it's literally just This guy. Yeah, okay, what happens if I do i

Matthias Miller  1:36:31
that gets us to the that one which we already know is wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:36:48
Know, we are including a negative that he's not including. We're including this guy, well,

Speaker 1  1:36:56
yeah, but there's a negative at the very end of the of the history,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:59
way up at the top, yeah, but

Matthias Miller  1:37:01
we're not looking at that date. We're looking at this date.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:11
Wait, you're waiting No,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:15
319, 30s. And in I have 312, I have 319, 30s too.

Matthias Miller  1:37:22
I guess I don't know which one I'm actually

Unknown Speaker  1:37:31
including. Okay, let's just

Matthias Miller  1:37:41
like

Matthias Miller  1:37:53
I'm just completely lost even what to try i

Matthias Miller  1:38:03
Yeah, that's Hang on. This guy does not have a contract on it. That's the issue.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:15
What? Wait, wait,

Matthias Miller  1:38:19
we have blank contracts on here,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:23
I see that. Can we disregard it?

Matthias Miller  1:38:34
We're looking across all accounts. We shouldn't be looking at accounts. We should be looking at contracts. Which contract are we looking at?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
Are we looking at? Okay, there is.

Speaker 1  1:38:49
It looks like it started out as 10964 Then they returned all that for some reason, and it became 109641096

Matthias Miller  1:39:01
A here. Let's do this group of the contract first. Okay, so here we have, okay, 9640, zeros out. Nine, six A is,

Matthias Miller  1:39:23
I started out with 1200 Oh, yeah. And then we have another one that's not tied to anything, that doesn't have a contract, that's not tied to a contract of 1930 you

Speaker 1  1:39:38
have a pot there's a positive and a negative for one that's not tied to a contract, though, those there should be two of those that zero out.

Matthias Miller  1:39:54
I know what it is. No, I don't. I.

Matthias Miller  1:40:04
Contract numbers are not guaranteed to be unique, or it's a store.

Matthias Miller  1:40:18
We need it. It's picking up from a different store.

Speaker 3  1:40:24
Oh, that's what happened to get got wrong put in the wrong store. Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

Matthias Miller  1:40:33
So we need a match on store plus con. Am I? Is it store Plus account plus contract, or is it just store plus contact, contract? Do

Unknown Speaker  1:40:47
I want to say store Plus account, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:52
but I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  1:41:05
Oh, that's not, this is not the

Speaker 1  1:41:07
I've got like, two more minutes, and then I gotta, I gotta hop, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:41:18
History, store. History, okay, store, store account, contract date, just

Matthias Miller  1:41:38
going to do that.

Speaker 1  1:41:45
All right, I'm gonna, I'm I'm dropping off. Let's I think I know there's a lot of value. I don't know there's a lot of value in having Nick along for you. And I could work on this tomorrow at two.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:57
Sound good. It works. Thanks,

Matthias Miller  1:41:58
guys. Awesome. Thanks. Things.

Speaker 2  1:42:03
If I drop. Or do you see around? No, that's right, you can drop, all right, yeah.
