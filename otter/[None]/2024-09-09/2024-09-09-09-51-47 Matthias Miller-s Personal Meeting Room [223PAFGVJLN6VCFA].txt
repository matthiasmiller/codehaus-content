Unknown Speaker  00:35
Hey, how's it going?

Unknown Speaker  00:36
Good? How are you? Hey, finally made it. Thanks for your patience.

Speaker 1  00:43
Oh, no problem. I put it. I put the document in a story folder, because there were so many versions. Got it. I like it. I kick.

Unknown Speaker  01:10
Not seeing you.

Unknown Speaker  01:12
Do you want a Do you want an archive holder in here somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  01:20
Am I in an archive? Sorry, has this is this is the one? Oh, no, you're on. You're on. Yeah, we're good.

Unknown Speaker  01:33
All right. I was just wondering if we could

Unknown Speaker  01:41
let me just do something here, and then you can tell me you hate it.

Unknown Speaker  01:53
All right? Do you want to drop in the new I guess trying to do that now.

Unknown Speaker  02:10
I All right, I don't know what, what needs to change here. Oh, sure.

Unknown Speaker  02:40
Well, first I could say, Okay, how's

Speaker 1  02:56
I maybe it's after diluting myself for years as a second in command in corporate after diluting myself for years in corporate,

Unknown Speaker  03:11
I don't know that it's true to say that it's

Speaker 1  03:15
okay after diluting myself For years, I still think you need some transition from diluting to distilled. I went on a journey to distill my 100 proof version.

Speaker 2  03:40
You can just say, I begin the journey to distill who I was,

Unknown Speaker  03:59
Whatever it is, I think there needs to be a process word you

Speaker 1  04:35
can you Say I began to distill who I was. I

Unknown Speaker  04:45
yeah, I think that's weird,

Speaker 1  04:47
okay, and then you can say this work has changed my life and the leaders I've helped, okay, I've helped, all right? Shares the battles and pictures i. It's

Speaker 2  05:34
you can even say it's a story that each of us find ourselves in, in some way on the path to becoming 100 Yeah, I think

Speaker 1  05:53
you already had that on Your third line. It's a story for second in commands at the end, maybe

Unknown Speaker  06:16
at the very end. Well,

Unknown Speaker  06:19
I like the ending of that last line.

Unknown Speaker  06:33
Maybe

Unknown Speaker  06:52
now keep in mind that this invitation is first for them, but it's also for their team and their People in some form.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
Ah,

Speaker 1  07:49
I might just go to my document, because it's a little little bit small. Okay, yeah, I'll just look at it from my screen. Nice.

Unknown Speaker  07:56
Okay, no, I mean I can also,

Speaker 1  08:11
this is for the leaders, defined as second in commands. I demands

Speaker 1  08:33
your fund, maybe, maybe part of, okay, here's a thought. You know, when you when you're when you take second place. What does that mean? I mean someone beat you, right? It means there was a first place, because there was a competition. But you're not competing under the 100 proof, you vision. You're putting yourself first. You're not putting someone else in first place.

Unknown Speaker  09:20
Who,

Speaker 1  09:23
maybe there's like a second in command. Want to put their their work first, their self, their person, their work. It's like, Hey, you put yourself as the focus. Maybe it's too early to say that without the competition,

Speaker 2  09:52
might be I'd still go back to the two questions, how do I handle the pressure? How do I not do alone? Well, I

Speaker 1  10:02
this is okay. There you go. This is really easy. Who who are wondering how, how they Can, how they I,

Unknown Speaker  10:28
pressure. I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:43
I mean

Unknown Speaker  11:05
maybe this is simpler,

Unknown Speaker  11:14
just like right now. I

Unknown Speaker  11:35
i do like, I mean, you could,

Unknown Speaker  11:55
how about this? My work, my work is to create

Unknown Speaker  12:12
a sanctuary

Unknown Speaker  12:22
support the support second in commands, leaders who find themselves as second in command and um,

Unknown Speaker  12:45
you don't, you don't. You don't have to to,

Unknown Speaker  12:57
to carry the load alone. I

Speaker 3  13:00
to handle.

Speaker 1  13:10
So this is, that's, that's what I kind of got when I went on a walk this morning. It was space and support like I

Unknown Speaker  13:44
maybe a friend cure the friend that's you like that Is there more? I

Unknown Speaker  14:03
a guide

Unknown Speaker  14:21
with people, just say, with people, the people who care, or people.

Speaker 1  14:36
This sounds like a community offering, but that's that's not the offer right now. It's it's you right now, just speaking with them, right i.

Speaker 1  15:10
Maybe, maybe you know that is this overused to talk about diamonds are made under pressure, they need the space to form. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  15:29
too many metaphors. I think

Speaker 1  15:38
it's, it's, it's a space is it's a place away from the pressure,

Unknown Speaker  15:46
where

Speaker 1  15:50
pressure maybe where, where your work or your self can emerge. It's like where they can you. Okay, they can flourish.

Speaker 1  16:16
Enter, Enter a sanctuary, a sanctuary, a sanctuary, to receive insight and clarity, courage and

Unknown Speaker  17:05
what do you Think

Speaker 1  17:18
about that? I don't think you need this.

Speaker 2  17:22
You're planning to keep this. So, no, yeah, well,

Unknown Speaker  17:33
this, this is an invitation. I

Unknown Speaker  17:46
yeah, thank

Unknown Speaker  18:15
report, can you say these who are who are second in commands.

Speaker 1  18:29
So I guess any small business too,

Unknown Speaker  18:41
I feel like

Unknown Speaker  18:48
corporate is where you I'm not sure about calling out corporate in here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  18:54
great.

Unknown Speaker  18:57
I think corporate. Corporate is targeting,

Speaker 1  19:01
okay, to separate The pressure.

Unknown Speaker  19:19
Enter the sanctuary. Sanctuary you

Unknown Speaker  19:52
too much. I.

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Maybe you don't need sanctuary. You could just

Speaker 2  20:07
step away from, I mean, you could even say, and enter this pressure from the from the pressure to risk, to find, yeah, I think that's better. We did

Speaker 1  20:29
not, no reason to turn them off yet. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:32
it's good,

Unknown Speaker  20:33
yeah, I think, I think so. I

Speaker 1  20:43
a solid, pretty good, huh, brilliant. And this, I thought this was much better having a transition here,

Unknown Speaker  20:56
we tell them what you're giving them, right?

Unknown Speaker  20:59
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:08
Where you go.

Unknown Speaker  21:19
Now, I think the other thing you wanted was I

Unknown Speaker  21:50
I mean, you have nine references to A business, so let's say six of those are your tied to your Business. Are you wanting to

Speaker 1  22:19
not be explicit about you having a business.

Unknown Speaker  22:31
So we could, like hear you.

Unknown Speaker  22:47
We could bring in the fact that page, page three, if you click My name, you'll see where I'm at.

Unknown Speaker  23:02
Oh, that's cool. I didn't know that

Speaker 2  23:06
you could bring in the idea that that I went I believed I can do better on my own as my wheeled client, and then effectively just became a second in command

Unknown Speaker  23:21
again. Oh, I like that. Yeah, that would be easy.

Unknown Speaker  23:36
I mean, you could do this, you better on my own? Would

Speaker 1  23:41
they think that? But to me, second in command is in your context, second in command is a good thing. Taking second place is not right. I

Unknown Speaker  24:10
my success led me to Becoming

Unknown Speaker  24:20
seconding command for my client.

Unknown Speaker  24:36
My

Unknown Speaker  24:52
okay, do.

Unknown Speaker  25:18
Taking second place was

Unknown Speaker  25:28
place like I was getting the short end of the stick and taking second place. I

Speaker 3  25:40
This come.

Speaker 2  25:57
A second. However, I felt like I got short end of The stick and second place.

Speaker 1  26:21
I mean maybe, when maybe you need to clarifying, what do I mean by by taking second place,

Unknown Speaker  26:34
putting

Speaker 1  26:37
the needs of my boss my client or boss or Does this free thinking here above putting the demands and above my own needs, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  27:16
needs.

Unknown Speaker  27:23
My own, yeah,

Speaker 1  27:32
maybe this like, maybe there needs to be a line about feeling inferior. Like it's almost like I'm

Unknown Speaker  27:52
thinking. I'm thinking of something I listened to last night. Someone asked an evolution 2.0 question, and Perry shared a talk on evolution alpha and evolution omega. Evolution alpha is like Darwin. It's competition, and evolution. Omega is

Unknown Speaker  28:32
symbiosis. Well,

Speaker 1  28:34
he calls it, yeah, he calls it like resurrection. He has. He has symbiosis is one of them.

Speaker 1  28:48
You know, a struggle versus a shared collaboration, right? So maybe, but here's, here's my thinking, where there's i

Speaker 1  29:06
It's almost like where there's no love, there's there's a struggle, right? I don't know, I don't know if you could have a line here, of like, I

Speaker 1  29:26
maybe you just say hey. You just say, maybe this is where you mentioned head trash, or this is where you had, I

Speaker 1  30:12
I my, my, my, my concede my significance or my worth, my, my value, my

Speaker 1  30:49
the own value, the value of my own, of my contribution.

Speaker 1  30:58
Maybe you don't need to make it as identity based just because they feel like, Hey, I'm doing all this learning.

Speaker 1  31:27
I had to, I had to. Maybe this is this, is it right? So you felt like you had to prove yourself more, yeah, and then that's when you start fighting, because you're Starting to prove yourself.

Unknown Speaker  31:52
There we go.

Unknown Speaker  32:01
Well, in this Swat,

Unknown Speaker  32:11
and we Can even probably mix this. I

Speaker 1  32:47
I think, I think this is the easiest lead in after, okay,

Speaker 1  33:20
I think you just say, I put demands of my I began. This began, when, when my sacrifices, the contribution is, did not, did not, do not receive, save recognition, did not receive,

Unknown Speaker  33:59
did not receive recognition, and I and I and I and I, causing me, me to doubt the value my value, my value, the value of

Speaker 3  34:21
evaluating The I know

Unknown Speaker  34:25
this is redundant, but, yeah, I

Speaker 1  34:43
I think you don't need this there. I could prove myself and I and I, you have felt a lot um. And I maybe this is the pressure and I and I and I and I began to dump. I doubted my own value. All right, doubted my my value, my value,

Speaker 2  35:27
and doubled down to myself more

Speaker 1  35:33
and I felt I

Speaker 1  35:43
yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe this is where you Bring in pressure. The pressure causes you to prove

Unknown Speaker  35:59
yourself. Totally valued

Speaker 1  36:03
and and the pressure to prove my prove myself worthy, uh, only growth, only The group I

Unknown Speaker  36:36
maybe it's an I doubted my value, I found and I had a new sound pressure to prove myself worthy. Pressure to prove myself worthy. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah.

Speaker 1  37:05
Now we now, now we have a rationale. Maybe they, they might not relate to all the competitive aspects, but I think they can relate to

Speaker 2  37:18
worthiness proof. Yeah, the seed and

Speaker 1  37:21
you just went this direction. They might have gone this other direction, but,

Unknown Speaker  37:34
and, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:40
sorry, can you guess

Unknown Speaker  37:50
my,

Unknown Speaker  37:56
can you say unicorn client? Like they're, they're like, a special client. There's a privadana you want to take care of

Unknown Speaker  38:10
here or here

Unknown Speaker  38:12
now, just, yeah, my

Unknown Speaker  38:15
unicorn client, yeah, I think that's fine,

Speaker 1  38:20
because it's it's not if it's a High Value client has special demands, right?

Unknown Speaker  38:30
It's okay. I

Unknown Speaker  38:53
Okay, they say the game was rigged and the only way to win was to fold.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
I love it. It's awesome.

Speaker 2  39:10
We can't bring this in, but I've got a lifelong history with rig games. I don't know, as the youngest of a family of very intelligent kids. I got the short end of the stick a lot of times.

Speaker 2  39:31
Let's play Monopoly, where you have a hand of five cards. And of course, being the youngest, I mean, it's an advantage, for sure, but being the youngest you can, there's no way you can properly capitalize on the advantage of that being sure stack your twos and fours so that you can bypass the reward anyway.

Unknown Speaker  39:53
Oh, it's good.

Speaker 2  39:55
Those are the four Yeah, four plate. Plate. This is. Another true story with my my brother, just older than me, always play checkers because it's not subject to chance, and so he can control the outcome. But pick a game like, I don't know what uno or something like that, that's gotten too much chance. I don't remember playing a lot of games with him where there was any chance involved.

Speaker 1  40:22
I, I mean, you could say, I mean, I don't know if that's worth concluding it's like I felt, I felt, it's kind of like feeling like a child again With older siblings who playing Monopoly with Special rules. Um

Speaker 3  41:18
I don't know I I think,

Speaker 1  41:33
yeah, I think this is fine. I do think that's a presentational story that's would Get people to smile. Let's say,

Unknown Speaker  41:50
okay, so then I

Speaker 2  42:14
I'll be right back. You I don't

Speaker 2  42:38
really see anything that needs to change until down in New Wave business, but maybe you're saying something.

Speaker 1  42:58
No, I think that's a I think that smoothed out like the first, the first point where you bring up your business and saying, Hey, you had, you were a second in command to the command or your client like that. Yeah. And, you know, honestly, that's probably smart. Then you don't have to keep two separate storylines in your head. Just stick it's your story stick with. And they might, I mean, it's actually, they might actually appreciate that you were a second in command, and then you became your own boss. Like, right? That actually, like, because you now you understand both worlds. You've been in both seats. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  44:07
The other thing is, you could add questions. So I thought of one was, what would it mean to I

Speaker 1  44:25
uh, be in a space that supported your needs, like that tied to Sanctuary, right in a space Where Where, where all your needs are met, where you

Speaker 2  44:46
well, couldn't we just put this at the very end of a section, you know, some something like, you know how people have, like, little homework, or like little things in the end, I. Your your invitation, or I don't know what

Speaker 1  45:13
your invitation Well, go to page 11, your invitation to the sanctuary. To enter the sanctuary. Your invitation into the sanctuary is your invitation to enter. This to enter, to enter the sanctuary. I

Unknown Speaker  45:53
what I mean is like looking up at page five. I

Speaker 1  46:11
Oh yeah, yeah, that's fine. Those are, those are the call out sections that I liked from the limitless guy, yeah, if it was a design box, it'd be like a little, a little shadow box.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
I mean, we could. I

Unknown Speaker  46:47
or, I mean, that's good.

Unknown Speaker  46:56
Could also have i

Unknown Speaker  47:03
Why? Why does it skip all the way?

Unknown Speaker  47:07
I know you're calling a page break Somewhere,

Unknown Speaker  47:10
okay, you could have something like

Unknown Speaker  47:21
I right for each section, all self, real self and so, so stop and start. I think is a nice, nicely. You could do that anywhere.

Unknown Speaker  48:18
That might be easier, simpler. I

Speaker 3  48:20
also, I

Speaker 2  48:25
mean, might be too many lawyers, but questions are powerful because they don't stop asking. I mean, they don't go away, right? But if you ask an unproductive question at a conversation with Kevin this morning around trying to reconcile paying the bills, between what gives me life, what makes me come alive, and paying the bills. And he asked me how long I've been trying to reconcile it, and suggested that perhaps it's not mine to reconcile.

Speaker 2  49:09
An unproductive question will keep you hunting for an answer, yeah, that you'll never find it.

Unknown Speaker  49:16
It doesn't mean it just sticks with you. It

Unknown Speaker  49:22
sticks with you. And there is no answer,

Speaker 1  49:26
right? So what was, what was his thought? It's like, you don't, that's not a worthwhile question, right?

Unknown Speaker  49:32
Okay, it's like, obviously there's,

Unknown Speaker  49:38
it's a false dilemma.

Speaker 2  49:42
Yeah. And all of us find ourselves in different places at different times, but it's I mean, so much of this comes down to relentless trust. Go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  49:53
it's two short ends of the stick, except there i. Yeah, and

Unknown Speaker  50:02
you just got to, like, let go one end of the stick.

Unknown Speaker  50:15
So the i

Speaker 1  50:32
Well, do you have can you go into your journal and pull out questions you've asked yourself?

Unknown Speaker  50:39
Yeah, by Doc, I don't know this is i

Unknown Speaker  51:07
Okay, Hey, okay, so here's an idea.

Speaker 1  51:23
Is you need? What if you have, what if you have 40 proof questions, 100 proof question,

Unknown Speaker  51:33
I like this.

Speaker 1  51:38
Sorry. Sometimes I feel like, am I saying something productive, or am I saying this because I know you'll like it?

Unknown Speaker  51:45
Oh, well, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  51:49
I just I hope it's productive.

Unknown Speaker  51:52
I hope so.

Unknown Speaker  51:53
I hope so too.

Speaker 1  51:57
But that just means you have to define 40 and 100 proof. Also, I don't know what the right ratio is like.

Unknown Speaker  52:16
20% proof, right and percent proof and 100% proof.

Unknown Speaker  52:39
So what is the I I

Speaker 1  52:56
mean, there's a reason why you picked 40% even if you don't know why,

Speaker 2  53:07
well, I mean 20% I mean the the real Reason is that that's still elevated from right? Yeah. Let others into my life to watch shoulder to shoulder through Difficulty. Boom, let's think I

Unknown Speaker  53:54
wait what if it's I?

Speaker 1  54:03
How can I ask? How can I ask for help? And then you say one's walking shoulder shoulder with you, once isolated, that's

Speaker 2  54:20
more than asking for help. The guy at this at the corner, we have have a WalMart where all the folks hang out with their signs, they're asking for help. That's not 100 proof. Sure. I

Speaker 1  54:45
did I tell you about someone in our Trish group that left she was kind of she had confessed and had some. Addictions, single mom made a clean break, or so we thought, didn't really tell us otherwise and like, it's just like a whole mess of things. It's just like you don't even know where to start to solve it. It's unbelievable, like going out to clean cleaner house, like she had you dumped trash bags, trash bags, trash bags. And you're like, we haven't even begun. Um, um, she ultimately, yeah, she couldn't, she couldn't humble herself to have the people she knows loves her, walk alongside her. It's like the sense of unworthiness pushes everyone away. That's the you have to prove yourself, right? So you compete, and you turn those who love you against you. And it's just, it's crazy. Yeah, okay, how do I take?

Speaker 1  56:42
Sorry? I just, I do really like quotes are every 100 proof you're always quoting it. We

Unknown Speaker  56:52
can, we can. That's

Unknown Speaker  56:59
like you're winking, huh, yeah, it's funny. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  57:13
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  57:20
haven't fixed the session. Oh so.

Unknown Speaker  57:29
40 proof and then at every signature victory

Speaker 2  57:41
list I mean, we still need to head up here and start revamping this a little

Speaker 2  58:00
bit like I would just do, see where I'm at.

Unknown Speaker  58:11
You see where I'm at. Are you there? Can

Unknown Speaker  58:22
you hear me? Yeah, sorry, there was

Unknown Speaker  58:27
a Oh, got it.

Unknown Speaker  58:35
Or you could say, I learned

Unknown Speaker  58:47
the rules I learned

Unknown Speaker  58:55
back to the game,

Unknown Speaker  58:58
game or real work

Unknown Speaker  59:10
well, We're not game because you're not playing the game. I

Speaker 1  59:48
can you just say I learned that here, so here I learned I. You could say, I learned the game, the new game of leadership.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:09
Like you said, we're not in the game.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:11
I know I'm.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
I learned the what if there wasn't a word for rules I learned the

Speaker 1  1:00:35
the new, the new way, a new a new way, a new way to lead. To lead,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
I know you want to make it like a paradigm shift. I knew I learned a new paradigm of leadership. I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:03
I broke. I broke the old rules

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
To find a new I

Speaker 1  1:01:54
So they saw the good. I

Speaker 1  1:02:05
wait, can you just say this? This was, was, this was the new, new path, or the new form, or the new the new, ah, the new. This was the path. This was the path, the path of leadership. This was the new path. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:46
This is the new path. Is the new planet,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
onto the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:05
yes, that's

Speaker 1  1:03:09
pretty good. I think, I think, yeah, it's I like that you stumbled onto it. It's not like you created this new path. It's like it's

Speaker 2  1:03:21
not even a new path. Maybe it's even a new assembled onto it,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
onto the life giving path, onto the life giving path in leadership. Yeah, there we go.

Speaker 2  1:03:40
Okay, can I change your tribe? Are you attaching your tribe versus those around you?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46
Which way do you want? So those around you is good,

Speaker 2  1:03:53
because I feel like tribe is too Yeah, specific. Embrace the path of least resistance. This one's nuanced. I don't know if we argued about it before. I mean kind of pulling to bring in the collaborative strategy. But I mean sometimes the shortest way is, I mean often the shortest way is through.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:22
We slow. You have path here

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
that doesn't tell you Least Resistance do Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, Thank.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Vision like way to lead.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:03
Wait, wait, wait to lead. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:05:08
Chesterton has this great quote. I don't know if I quoted this one to you or not, but he has this quote about long words flowing by like a train. If you want to confuse people, you, you do that if you really want to, yeah, use long words. That's funny. I mean, I would, I would like to, personally like to can

Speaker 1  1:05:42
you just say I discovered a life giving way?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
Found we use Find a lot. I

Speaker 2  1:06:04
i Like this, yeah, with this qualification, yeah, I

Speaker 2  1:06:40
again, This is, this is business, but this is still about, even if it's not perfectly relatable, it still talks about the courage to do the right thing.

Speaker 1  1:06:54
I think it's fine, because it talks about your home life. And that's, yeah, that's part of your story.

Speaker 2  1:07:06
And these questions, man, I mean, I don't know, every time you go through this, it feels so potent.

Speaker 1  1:07:22
Yeah, those questions are good email you could Have a email series on the questions i

Speaker 1  1:08:00
What are you looking for here? I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
don't see anything that really needs to change in the next section.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:22
Yeah, maybe, maybe you don't need.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:25
Well, no, this is,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:36
yeah, what is my real work? I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:54
there you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
Great, interesting. Oh, this is like,

Speaker 1  1:08:58
especially for corporate. Next slide that's great. Okay, by the way, maybe I told you this admired leadership, they talk about,

Speaker 1  1:09:18
this whole movement of like assessments and that people it's it's personality driven, but they say leadership is what you do. It's not what you think. I just love that very

Speaker 2  1:09:37
interesting conversation with Kevin this morning about thinkers versus doers, and does personality have any impact on that? One of the things he mentioned is that much of overthinking was a response to trauma, which was a sense of strong perceived danger and your protection against being. Event becomes to try to rationalize and explain a chaotic world, which leads to overthinking. And so a lot of the antidote for overthinking is disassembling the protective mechanisms that we use to protect ourselves against a chaotic world.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
How do you square that with action drives out thought? Good type of good type of thinking. Well,

Speaker 2  1:10:32
yeah, good type of thinking, I mean, but there's also a difference between, you know, learning to discern between what is real thinking, you know, what's your gut intuition and what is anxiety? Anxiety, self protective, rationalization, yeah, safekeeping, etc. That's good.

Speaker 2  1:10:59
Okay, so this is one place business partners and either page nine is one potential place where

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
I had partners who worked out the next steps I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:24
yeah,

Speaker 1  1:11:39
I like, I liked to work out the next steps.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
Great to, would you say? Yeah, I

Speaker 1  1:11:51
like, I like to to work out the next steps.

Speaker 2  1:12:02
Right? I got, I got background noise. Are you saying you like this year? Yeah, you're saying, okay, yeah, no, there's, there's a bit of a concession, which it really was a concession to other people to

Speaker 1  1:12:16
but do you want to say to work out the next Steps? Or, who worked out the next steps?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
Okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
okay, thank

Unknown Speaker  1:13:20
then

Speaker 1  1:13:41
it's too bad because I like going straight from the place of sanctuary to enter the sanctuary.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:53
No, we don't have to. Yeah, we can lead straight in. I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:57
like, I like to straight in. I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:08
just do that.

Speaker 1  1:14:10
Yeah, so you have two you have two question sense, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:24
but you could also throw in You

Unknown Speaker  1:14:36
could also throw in two questions here. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:14:44
where you could say, Where am I creating space? Where am I? No, well, I.

Speaker 1  1:15:01
Oh, okay, what about this? Getting answers outside of yourself versus inside. Who should I go to for answers?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:21
Who who has I

Unknown Speaker  1:16:06
I don't know that that's like, maybe, maybe we shouldn't even have questions in there. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:11
I don't. I think it's fine.

Speaker 1  1:16:20
Yeah, this works very nicely. I think this site is the right size for this.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:35
All right, you're happy. Yuri,

Speaker 1  1:16:38
can you your, can you just say your journey to becoming 100 proof?

Speaker 1  1:16:50
Then you kill the quotations, and there's no double your, yeah, you're you great to becoming 100 proof. So I

Unknown Speaker  1:17:07
almost want to do this. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:17:37
Can you say that gives and then take these gigs away.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:49
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:18:00
I could also say the direct path to your Yeah, I don't know I like it.

Speaker 1  1:18:28
The Discovery call page should probably have something on it,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:37
as in testimonials or something or some something, something

Unknown Speaker  1:18:47
Like a title.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:54
I mean, that would be useful. I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:15
for

Unknown Speaker  1:19:23
discovery

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25
What do you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:19:30
call it? You mean, besides discovery call,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:40
I just added discovery call, sanctuary. It's not a sanctuary call, I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
mean, it's discovery call, regarding, yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:19:54
me, it's like, meet Matthias.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:59
It's like. To All

Unknown Speaker  1:20:18
right, schedule your discovery call i By

Speaker 1  1:20:38
the way, when I, when I went to Brian's testimonial, there's a two minute version. Yep, I felt like I couldn't play it. Oh, no, that's there. Me sitting down. Should I have a two minute the two minute version here, let's see. Got me to play it?

Speaker 2  1:21:10
Yeah, I haven't. Actually, I've been meaning to go back and listen to it, but I haven't yet. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:15
for now, I

Speaker 1  1:21:34
I finished the E fellowship website took five times longer than necessary because there's no project manager. It's like, I had half a page of like info. It's like, okay, guys, but anyways, here's, here's go. Go to, can you share your screen? Yeah? Go to key fellows. Yeah, okay, and now just wait.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:17
I just opened it. It might not pop up, little pop up.

Speaker 1  1:22:19
Oh, you saw it. You saw it before? Okay, well, you could, you could do it in a private

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27
what is it? Incognita, but, but basically, yeah, like, I thought, I thought that was a nice function from ConvertKit. Yep, you can time delay it.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:51
I will say they're a little they're not super customizable.

Speaker 3  1:22:59
But, um, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:10
so that's, that's you could add. You know, my story, sign up here. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:23
I book your here's interesting feedback.

Speaker 2  1:23:33
So you got the manifested version, which makes sense. True weapons are pretty integral to everything you offer buried in the text. Ability may be beneficial. If it is front and center at the beginning, it's interesting and potentially helps communicate everything that

Speaker 1  1:23:47
follows. That's, uh, that'll be, that'll be on the main page, on the admin page, yeah. Oh, actually, no, no. Actually, I just have to cover my my 100 proof stories. So, so, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:24:12
so and he says these, choose collaboration and authenticity. We discuss these during our session. And these are values I would like to live my live life by I noticed you didn't mention the memos aspect of your work. Is that intentional? Like, sanctuary doesn't talk anything about memos.

Speaker 1  1:24:31
Yeah, that's fine. I think, I think both. You could have a line about head office like corporate is a space for head office so that that actually makes a lot of sense. I just I just don't know.

Speaker 1  1:24:59
I would. Rather them sign up and then, and then they get sent a a debrief, like explainer video, right? Hey, this is, this? Is you asking God or, you know, head office questions? It's a facilitated space. But, like, I don't know if you need to do that here Right. Kind of, like, it's a little too ticky. This is your story. This is just your story,

Speaker 1  1:25:41
unless you, unless you talk about this is one way you could do it. You having successive breakthroughs with embracing the path of least resistance through like divine direction, uh, that you call head office. I was getting personal, personal, uh, memos,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:22
leaving in into the story, or,

Speaker 1  1:26:24
yeah. I mean, in your story you could, you could talk about successive breakthroughs, from from a from a union with the truth. Yeah. It was about union with the truth. Maybe after that conversation, it created as I step into the unknown, and then, you know, the heaven the head office was sending me direct memos,

Speaker 1  1:27:11
right? But I don't. I don't. I feel like I don't think we need it. I

Unknown Speaker  1:27:17
I think

Speaker 2  1:27:25
the question, part of the question is, is, are the memos the sizzle, or are they mistake?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:35
And in Perry's world, they're definitely sizzle.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:37
They're sizzling.

Speaker 2  1:27:41
I don't know if they are here or not. They might be, but people might not want to admit that they're the sizzle either.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:52
I think here, 100 per view is the sizzle that's i

Speaker 1  1:28:05
Yeah, honestly, part of me is like, if you had one line about head office, great, but nothing, nothing Like an explainer, because your story isn't an explainer.

Speaker 2  1:28:24
Okay, so I mean, the basic challenge, I'm taking a fairly intentional, maybe I'm making it too vague. Now she'll like not confuse that customer. But I am taking an intentional it's

Unknown Speaker  1:28:39
indirect. I

Speaker 2  1:28:46
It's diversion from the frame of head office. IE, yeah, people get it higher power, etc. It's still externalizing, which is external, but

Speaker 1  1:29:10
I I personally don't think you can have union without adoption.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:22
I know that's a separate conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:29
That doesn't mean you can't have guidance and connection, and I

Speaker 1  1:29:43
I'm happy with this as is. I honestly you don't want to throw throw too many new things at at someone, right, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:59
Okay, so. You, this needs to be swamped out.

Speaker 1  1:30:04
And by the way, part of not using other people's terms is this is something you haven't experienced before. Yeah. Who's Chris?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:22
He I did a paid session with him week or two ago. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:28
what does he do?

Speaker 2  1:30:33
He is a former managing director equivalent, turned marketing consultant. Very classic bits in here, storyline.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:49
Well, you like the framework. I like real self more than authenticity. I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:03
i mean he's, he's putting different words to right, yes, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:31:13
but it's still in the same area, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:31:25
All right, well, it's, it's, it's, now,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:31
maybe,

Speaker 1  1:31:32
maybe, does there need to be a direct call out to I wonder if I let me just go back to the cover.

Speaker 1  1:31:55
I don't know if there's a tie in at the end, about being about the being second in command.

Speaker 1  1:32:19
It's almost like that. Problem fades away the more you get into it, because it's it's more tied to the first section about competition. That's fine. Maybe that's fine. I know. I think the first, at least the first 80% is definitely done like

Speaker 2  1:32:49
so it feels to me though an 11 page document needs a Pretty strong sales pitch to read. Or do you disagree?

Speaker 1  1:33:05
Well, we can look at the landing page. By the way, the sales kind of the sales pitch opening your LinkedIn, your story and the landing page opt in for the story. All start with hell is meeting the man I could have been so i Hey, it's good. I like that. You're consistent.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:52
Let me, let me see

Unknown Speaker  1:34:00
that was me, the man I could have been after.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:03
Okay,

Speaker 1  1:34:05
do you? Do you want me to swap out

Speaker 1  1:34:15
that for the old photo here, bring the second in command, replace this, clone this. But that's going to be okay, clone it. But this is going to go on the website, right? So the second hand story is going to go here?

Speaker 2  1:34:42
Yeah, I think, so, okay, great. I mean, I'm a bit uncertain. I think I don't know if it's

Speaker 1  1:34:53
good. I mean, you're going for corporate. So, so. So you don't want 4040 proof messaging. Maybe get it to 60 proof

Speaker 2  1:35:15
the but then the homepage should also be dear second in command. Not dear. I performing business leaders,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:27
yeah, yeah, yeah. Dear.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:48
Dear, you need deer.

Speaker 1  1:36:02
Can you just say to to the second to the second 20 commands?

Speaker 2  1:36:17
Do you know anything about well, I don't know. Okay, I'm getting I'm getting lost in I'm just getting lost. Can we do? Can you do this?

Speaker 1  1:36:37
I'm just trying to align your current website messaging with this new focus on Corporate.

Speaker 1  1:36:59
I yeah, I I can do this steps. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:04
I just want to

Unknown Speaker  1:37:09
That's cool,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:11
man. Google Docs is the best.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:14
It's pretty incredible. It

Speaker 1  1:37:16
changed the link. It changed the link to the title. Oh my gosh,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:26
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:42
by the way, here's a thought for you,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:45
yeah, um,

Speaker 1  1:37:47
have a running brainstorm. So every new brainstorm start at the top, so that you have whatever, a year's worth of brainstorms on a page, just a thought, or a month, a month of brainstorms on a page.

Speaker 2  1:38:13
That's how I do all my other Google Docs. I mean, usually an app. So this would be, oh, maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:38:20
you get too big,

Speaker 2  1:38:23
right? It doesn't matter. I mean, I don't care. I don't care how big it is. Do you care how big it is?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:30
No, oh, well, you know. I mean, you don't need to do that now.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:40
Well, it takes all of what?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:50
I'm not a letter. Letter to this. Pretty

Speaker 2  1:38:54
sure this is not oh 420, 208, oh, eight second, finance, I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:27
so

Unknown Speaker  1:39:33
I gotta grab a quick restroom. I'll be right back sure I

Speaker 2  1:42:23
All right, I guess I'm trying to figure out there's one other thing that kind of I'm trying to figure out what the big picture is and what needs to get done before we go down too many rabbit trails and I get Lost for lack of context. Something else to throw out there is, we talked about doing lunches.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:52
And if you do this, I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:06
so this is

Speaker 2  1:43:14
11 to 200 COO, President, Managing Director, we should exclude founder. I I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:29
don't know that we need seniority level, though it's kind of covered by the job title in the greater color to springs posted on LinkedIn.

Speaker 1  1:43:51
Well, yeah, I would want to think about what, What are your offering

Unknown Speaker  1:44:02
on? What to call this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:44:25
see I

Speaker 1  1:44:47
Oh, nice. You have sanctuary and you have 100 proof you, those are three elements on your the. Often for the Story, yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:45:52
And So I

Unknown Speaker  1:47:00
Are you waiting on me? Are you working on

Speaker 1  1:47:02
it? No, I'm I'm editing this page.

Speaker 1  1:47:19
I almost want to say, into the 100 proof version, not a that's fair. Okay, then,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:37
thanks. So.

Speaker 2  1:47:56
Should I do a C name for a sub domain for these? What's that? Should I set up a sub domain on my for these, for ConvertKit?

Speaker 1  1:48:08
I guess, I'm not sure. Not sure what you mean by that. It's already its own ConvertKit domain.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:21
I mean, I mean, it can, it could be like pages that dot Matthias miller.com/so,

Speaker 1  1:48:37
right now it's Matthias miller.ck, and what are you suggesting?

Unknown Speaker  1:48:42
It could be pages, dot Matthias, miller.com,

Speaker 1  1:48:48
oh, You can do that. Yeah, sure. I

Unknown Speaker  1:49:20
means and

Speaker 2  1:51:20
All right? Well, as soon as the DNS changes seem good,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:37
I'm sorry about that. How's that? You just said something. Oh,

Speaker 2  1:51:44
as soon as the DNS changes, Oh, sick.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:59
Now here it says it did. I

Speaker 1  1:52:04
wonder, does ConvertKit have options? What for naming the domain? I There you go.

Speaker 1  1:52:41
Settings, into settings don't mean to snow and

Unknown Speaker  1:53:23
okay, I made the font a little bigger for the second in commands on that the front cover. Didn't see it on the Convert click Page. I

Unknown Speaker  1:53:44
Yeah, the word and should be lowercase,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:51
really that it's on a new line.

Speaker 1  1:54:01
Think it's okay. It's on a new line, and it begins. I feel like you would be capitalized,

Speaker 1  1:54:18
yeah, show up live in union with the truth. Embrace collaborative strategy where you find clarity.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:33
I'm asking chat GPT. It's very confused.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:35
What's that?

Speaker 2  1:54:40
Asking chat GPT, and it gets a very confusing answer.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:43
That's okay.

Speaker 1  1:54:49
I'm not sure if can you go to the opt in page? Yeah, this number two sanctuary. I. Yeah, I feel like that wording could change. Where you find clarity. It's like,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:11
well, it seems reminiscent of,

Speaker 1  1:55:18
yeah, just seem to go to the end. Maybe I can say the sanctuary is a dynamic experience that gives,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:34
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:42
Does that work or no? Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 1  1:56:02
Should I have those as three bullets or just one paragraph? There's clarity for your biggest question, connection with your authentic self.

Speaker 2  1:56:11
I feel like it's more readable as bullets. Okay? I

Unknown Speaker  1:56:50
Okay, check it out.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:56
Yeah, really good. You.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:13
I mean, that's pretty good. Oh, the one line i That's not similar is, and it's my hope that it changes yours on the main page, it's and the leaders I've changed, and the leaders I've helped, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:57:37
it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:57:42
okay. So I'm the other thing you go to the main page. Yep. Dear, dear, second in command.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:06
You're wanting to kill deer

Speaker 1  1:58:09
Well, can you say a letter from the desk of Matthias to second in commands or something? I You're a second we

Unknown Speaker  1:58:42
would do attention to you. Could do a letter

Unknown Speaker  1:58:48
to the second in command,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:52
yeah, or

Unknown Speaker  1:58:54
a message a letter second in command, I? Okay, done.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:10

Speaker 1  2:00:15
okay, look at that. Now you're actually positioning yourself, you've picked one audience

Unknown Speaker  2:00:30
that takes courage. It's courage that I don't have.

Speaker 2  2:00:37
Well. I mean, is it courage or lack of clarity? I before. I've chosen niches before.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:53
Well, you can have clarity and not actually execute. I don't know. Do you

Unknown Speaker  2:00:59
have courage on your I mean, do you have clarity on your niche?

Speaker 1  2:01:05
Well, I know I tried to do Josh, Josh's thing, but I'm like, I'm not sure I'm designed to serve the bigger B to B businesses, I like the transformational space a little more. People, people like you.

Speaker 2  2:04:10
Yeah, I agree. Besides just my story, besides the story,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:21

Well, advisor, stop diluting the 100 proof version of you.

Speaker 2  2:09:18
Well, I mean, it could be call out. It's call out. It's the custom button. It's the about page,

Unknown Speaker  2:09:29
yeah, so LinkedIn, redesign, yeah, reset here. I'm gonna

Unknown Speaker  2:09:47
turn this thing into I'm.

Matthias Miller  2:10:20
Uh, here you can laugh at me. Let's go through the checklist, specific on what industry slash company type will need your help the most. I don't know that we've necessarily nailed that down, but I think a geographic radius, okay, here's my thought. I don't know why my brain is on. Big picture, go to market. And where does everything fit within that? So in my mind, big picture, go to market,

Speaker 1  2:10:52
helping underproof or helping second and commands, not take second place. For now,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:07
yeah, it could, to

Speaker 1  2:11:09
me that's, that's a nice, very nice, I help suck second implant commands not take second place. I

Speaker 1  2:11:29
That's great. That nice. I

Unknown Speaker  2:11:49
then I think, I almost think the under preview, so underproof view, okay,

Speaker 1  2:12:02
look at that. Even your black shirt goes with the website. It does look, honestly, don't keep it or Not. This is very tailored to you. Okay, do

Unknown Speaker  2:12:53
well, I

Unknown Speaker  2:13:05
maybe there's a dash, okay,

Speaker 1  2:13:18
well, Josh, Josh has like a one paragraph invitation. One one paragraph. Yeah, here

Unknown Speaker  2:13:39
he is, an invitation into the bottleneck group.

Speaker 1  2:13:41
But the about, the about page, no, no on LinkedIn. So the next, that's what I'm saying. This is, this is the call up. It started.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:02
Okay. With a featured link, which is his podcast.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:06
Yeah, you could feature, you could feature your, your story.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:13
Well, that would be easy to add.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:16
That's I really like that. Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  2:14:29
pages

Speaker 2  2:14:35
I'm a big fan of. I You

Unknown Speaker  2:14:44
want me to give you the link?

Unknown Speaker  2:14:48
No, I mean, here's what I really want. I want to read directly.

Speaker 1  2:14:56
Oh, so you know how many people from LinkedIn count. I.

Speaker 2  2:15:01
Now, well, I mean, even more than that, just maintain ability, because,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:20
mostly because it's way easier to update in one place than in a million places. And now I know exactly what is where. Okay, there's that add. My title. You said

Unknown Speaker  2:15:47
it's my 100 proof story. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:55
and then I

Unknown Speaker  2:15:58
mean, is it just this? I

Speaker 2  2:16:05
Yeah, yeah, would you include this?

Unknown Speaker  2:16:09
No, oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:17
maybe, maybe you don't need. I

Speaker 1  2:16:27
Well, first, I'm just trying to, I don't know what it would look like.

Speaker 2  2:16:33
Well, let's, let's find out. Okay, uh, not very good. It turns out

Speaker 1  2:16:46
thumbnail drop me to redo the thumbnail edit.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:01
Let's do that. Yeah, I

Speaker 2  2:17:02
think we need, we need a like a four by three version or something.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:17
Obviously,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:32
so we'd like to

Unknown Speaker  2:17:34
try mixing this you

Unknown Speaker  2:17:41
can select an image from your computer

Speaker 2  2:17:44
inside, yeah, I know. But I mean, do you want to create a thumbnail for me, sure.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:54
Can, can you? Can I share screen? I

Unknown Speaker  2:18:03
now.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:11
So just give me direction. I

Unknown Speaker  2:18:19
mean, I would just literally,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:30
I mean, something like that, looks,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:41
yeah, maybe it's just my 100 proof story.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:58
Yeah,

Speaker 2  2:19:00
yeah, yeah, maybe, and maybe the title is actually the battle between. Maybe you put the battle between in the let me try this. I

Unknown Speaker  2:19:41
How are you wanting it?

Speaker 2  2:19:43
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to change anything. No, thumbnails the same, just like you had it originally.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:59
I. Like that,

Unknown Speaker  2:20:33
Sure, right? I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:20:54
and now this needs to be very small, right?

Speaker 2  2:21:00
I mean, just any size will do it'll scale down. Just need it as a thing. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:21:09
this should be bigger. I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:21:22
going to drive.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:34
Okay, you can go to design.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:41
I myself

Unknown Speaker  2:21:43
again.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:52
I feel like I need to move the sword left. I

Speaker 1  2:22:03
wait, let me. Let me just re import one. I

Unknown Speaker  2:22:23
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:37
This is your offline. I

Unknown Speaker  2:22:59
you froze

Unknown Speaker  2:23:02
about now, there we go. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:05
you're back.

Speaker 1  2:23:20
That's better. You want me to just drop everything lower down, like bring it closer.

Unknown Speaker  2:23:35
I don't know. I don't know what they care.

Speaker 1  2:23:38
Okay. Well, go ahead and click on it see what it oh, it just goes To the page.

Unknown Speaker  2:23:51
So great. This feels like,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:02
Okay,

Speaker 1  2:24:17
I maybe 100 proof, 100 P capitalized, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:00
What about that?

Speaker 1  2:25:06
Well, I would say, let's connect. Is book a book a discovery call like, just send I

Speaker 1  2:25:23
now, like, let's, let's connect, and then the link. The link is discovery, call, right? I

Unknown Speaker  2:25:46
like that.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:50
No period. And do you need? HTTPS perform AT Ts do?

Unknown Speaker  2:26:05
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  2:26:07
maybe, maybe not. Let's try it, see what it thinks about me.

Unknown Speaker  2:26:22
Does? It doesn't like when I can still put it on its own line, but

Unknown Speaker  2:26:28
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:26:36
so should the custom button then be I book an appointment, schedule a call. Should you go to the discovery call? Should Go to the story?

Unknown Speaker  2:26:52
Let me think I

Speaker 1  2:27:40
I schedule a free discovery call. I would have that as a call out, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:27:59
like that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:04
save, boom, yeah, and then not remove it from your

Unknown Speaker  2:28:16
shoulder. Would you say,

Speaker 1  2:28:17
let's connect. Just, let's connect. And I don't know, do you need what others have to say? Okay, okay, because you want them to connect with you On LinkedIn.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:38
And now I

Unknown Speaker  2:28:45
did not expire.

Unknown Speaker  2:29:00
Okay, so?

Unknown Speaker  2:30:08
Good, let me check please. I don't

Unknown Speaker  2:30:13
even know that we're connected

Unknown Speaker  2:30:18
this nine.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:21
Perhaps I just

Unknown Speaker  2:30:27
sign in, not I'm not one to you have Matthias, Miller, slot, USA, yeah, that could change,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:48
but I wasn't sure Why

Unknown Speaker  2:30:49
one Matthias Miller, 100

Speaker 2  2:30:56
or that's Denton coach.

Speaker 1  2:31:01
He the coaching I'm not I would have coaching at least versus USA. I

Unknown Speaker  2:31:25
i would rather not have anything that ties me down to a

Unknown Speaker  2:31:41
specific thing.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:01
Okay, I'm going to resend you. I'm going to resend you the featured image, because I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:32:25
I don't have it in it. What's that?

Speaker 1  2:32:33
I don't know I'm saying. I'm saying for the 100 proof,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:38
okay, no, no, keep your

Unknown Speaker  2:32:39
profile you had a good profile thing.

Speaker 2  2:32:43
No, I'm not changing it. I'm seeing the profile. I can't change my profile URL.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:48
Okay. Well,

Unknown Speaker  2:33:01
okay, well, let me go to

Unknown Speaker  2:33:14
re download Three,

Unknown Speaker  2:33:18
export, i

Unknown Speaker  2:33:36
All right, can you re add? I the

Speaker 1  2:33:46
featured image, because it's getting cut off online. Yeah, hold up. Hold up. One second refresh page. Okay, try that.

Unknown Speaker  2:34:13
On yours, it looks fine, but on mine, it's cut

Unknown Speaker  2:34:17
well, I mean, it is cut off a bit online too, but

Unknown Speaker  2:34:21
there's much closer.

Unknown Speaker  2:34:32
How's that? Yeah,

Speaker 1  2:34:40
so I'm going to share my screen just see. So it was one from this cut off. So that's beautiful. Look at that. Ah,

Speaker 1  2:35:23
I think this, I almost think this needs to be my 100 proof Story, and then this,

Unknown Speaker  2:35:41
and then this be the

Unknown Speaker  2:35:48
well, then what

Unknown Speaker  2:35:51
I don't know, for some reason, this feels wordy as a Title, not wrong. But then they see this as the would

Unknown Speaker  2:36:11
you keep the description like it is?

Unknown Speaker  2:36:20
Yeah, you could keep the

Unknown Speaker  2:36:27
description,

Unknown Speaker  2:36:32
yeah, much cleaner

Speaker 2  2:36:36
that might, that might actually give me room to No, it doesn't. And yours. Maybe it actually would let me try it.

Speaker 1  2:36:48
Oh, but you know what? You have your about here, it's the same. It's the same here. E

Unknown Speaker  2:37:01
Good point. So it's going to be here.

Speaker 2  2:37:14
It could be I share my stories of battles, wins and victories.

Unknown Speaker  2:37:21
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  2:37:38
Hit refresh.

Speaker 1  2:37:42
How? Oh, I didn't know you could have a space. Great. So much better. Okay,

Speaker 1  2:37:55
okay, contact. I would definitely find a change to this. I

Unknown Speaker  2:38:07
don't know that I can

Unknown Speaker  2:38:15
you're guessing you're around. Here it is.

Speaker 2  2:38:22
You should be able to okay, but I disagree with you about Coach, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  2:38:27
Can you say 100 or 100 probably,

Unknown Speaker  2:38:41
or guide, you know, riser.

Unknown Speaker  2:38:51
Let me see, can I see what your screen? Yeah, can you see Matthias, dash Miller, please

Speaker 2  2:39:04
don't use any space assemblers or special characters, letters or numbers.

Unknown Speaker  2:39:18
I real.

Unknown Speaker  2:39:33
Just put real real. Matthias Miller,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:40
for now,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:44
is that a concession, or you genuinely like it?

Speaker 1  2:39:49
Well, I think that's what people do on their link, on their Instagram or x this

Speaker 2  2:39:59
one will still. Where you're at or still load, at least for now, I don't know how long it'll keep. I

Speaker 2  2:40:16
want to know who this dude is, who grabbed my I Yep, some German guy had a guy try to buy my domain off me for a few grand. I was like, Are you kidding me?

Unknown Speaker  2:40:33
No, that's fine. I

Unknown Speaker  2:40:43
All right, so you happy with LinkedIn?

Unknown Speaker  2:40:47
I think it's much better. Yeah, here I should, I would change Multiply strengths to Matthias at Matthias Miller, email,

Speaker 1  2:41:29
oh, can it be Matthias? Matthias, Miller versus N? Why? I don't know. I just assume I've always seen like Tim at Timothy Francis, Josh at Joshua long I mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:41:55
that's what you've seen. What's the advantage?

Unknown Speaker  2:42:00
And feels like I would never call you M,

Unknown Speaker  2:42:08
right, but putting my name in there is redundant.

Speaker 1  2:42:12
I know for you it's redundant just as far as like addressing people.

Speaker 2  2:42:17
So I mean, I have a I have various group emails that would go to my system assistant as well.

Unknown Speaker  2:42:33
Let's see.

Speaker 1  2:42:39
I mean, I could because, because one is, you don't want an emails to be coming from m you want it to be coming from Matthias. Also,

Speaker 2  2:42:57
I don't know this is the beyond. I don't care. This consequential.

Speaker 1  2:43:03
I think it, I think it helps, and eventually it's going to be, it could be Matthias at 100 proof,

Speaker 1  2:43:19
underproof view. But for Now, I definitely think Matthias

Unknown Speaker  2:44:13
I'm Still looking at your screen. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  2:44:25
yeah, I would, I would definitely have the tears I

Speaker 1  2:44:43
helping second in commands not take second place is nice. I think that's a very I mean that that could be, that could be a book title. I. I take not taking a second, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:45:19
Wow, they're intent about getting my password.

Unknown Speaker  2:45:26
Chefs, thanks. LinkedIn down for you.

Unknown Speaker  2:45:36
Is LinkedIn down,

Unknown Speaker  2:45:37
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:45:40
it works, it's the page doesn't, isn't found, but LinkedIn is

Unknown Speaker  2:46:02
that yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:46:03
stop it. Okay, I'm I'm losing myself.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:15
Again. You need my password three times. I

Unknown Speaker  2:46:23
um, should this be direct to my void number?

Unknown Speaker  2:46:39
You need to offer your you don't need. Don't offer your phone.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:53
Okay, you said it was successful, so make it show.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:59
Yeah. It doesn't show you're fine.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:09
Okay, you're fine, but the website isn't

Unknown Speaker  2:47:16
personal. Could be company. Just call it company website.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:26
Well, for now, I would do it personal.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:42
But boom,

Speaker 2  2:47:48
all right, anything else i

Unknown Speaker  2:48:05
i go to the top, oh, I guess I have mine.

Unknown Speaker  2:48:16
I mean, I could have, I could have let me share my screen. I

Unknown Speaker  2:49:05
I could even have, ah, something like this,

Unknown Speaker  2:49:17
or just centered. I

Unknown Speaker  2:49:29
sorry, let me just figure this out.

Unknown Speaker  2:49:38
I had I had a title. I

Speaker 3  2:49:40
You

Unknown Speaker  2:49:46
could have something like this on your heading.

Unknown Speaker  2:49:58
I don't know. I.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:10
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:50:22
uh, second in command. Are you?

Unknown Speaker  2:50:40
Place?

Unknown Speaker  2:51:01
You could have like an arrow

Speaker 1  2:51:10
going from one to this, underproof view, 40 proof view, or 100 proof going up it's a little too messy.

Unknown Speaker  2:51:30
I now,

Speaker 2  2:52:01
I don't know, I'm still feeling clean, but I feel like, if the

Speaker 1  2:52:06
the only reason why I was thinking of that is on its own, 100 proof doesn't point to anything. And that's the that's the visual.

Speaker 2  2:52:14
But it's not, it's not on its own. It's always supported by my tagline. And then they come here and they see this.

Speaker 1  2:52:28
Well, I guess maybe anything less than 100 proof feels like taking second place. Okay, there maybe there's more connection. I My brain is just right,

Unknown Speaker  2:52:46
well, I gotta drop off in 15 minutes anyway, for call

Speaker 1  2:52:49
this looks, I think, I think, Okay, actually, it does connect, because here, here's this, visually, 100 proof. You my 100 proof story, the battle between helping second it does, I think it does Connect. Yeah, we're good. So

Unknown Speaker  2:53:19
do you want to

Speaker 1  2:53:23
one thing you could do is become a a Top Contributor. I don't know, I don't know how you do that, but people who have, people who have that, have an extra line, a voice for

Unknown Speaker  2:53:44
whatever section, whatever it

Unknown Speaker  2:53:45
is, top personal development. Voice, I think that's built over time. Yeah, so, so you basically, you'd have to pick, you'd have to pick a category, then you'd have to have people endorse you in that skill area, and then you can do, you see the the promotion, path, yeah,

Speaker 1  2:54:27
but that, that's a really nice call out from LinkedIn. It's a top voice, it's a community voice, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:54:42
You have a, oh, you know what you're missing. What

Unknown Speaker  2:54:52
you could have a you could have a call out. You.

Unknown Speaker  2:55:02
So right now you have this.

Speaker 1  2:55:09
Right now you have this, okay, you could drop that, and it could be a call out to, oh, this is that's the issue. There's no, there's no 100 proof. View,

Unknown Speaker  2:55:35
experience, page

Speaker 1  2:55:37
experience, because if you had something here, you click on it, like a friend who's a coach, he has a, you know, Matthias coaching, and then, and no, no LinkedIn, and then it's, you can it jumps to the experience.

Speaker 2  2:56:05
Education, profitable relationships, oh, if you have your present right, right, right, right, I get it.

Speaker 1  2:56:13
It's like a hyperlink. It's like a boss of what do you what do you call a Johnson? Like a, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:56:25
I mean, like an internal link. So, I

Speaker 2  2:56:33
mean, that would mean creating 100 proof new company page, wouldn't it? And I should probably register a 100 proof DBA. Then in that case,

Unknown Speaker  2:56:43
no, no, you you just,

Speaker 1  2:56:52
it's just multiply your strengths. That's what you keep this is how you do it. Maybe you keep it under multiply your strengths. I

Speaker 1  2:57:04
The issue is, it'd be nice if that was 100 proof view all the way moving forward.

Speaker 2  2:57:11
What's wrong with doing a DBA with 100 proof view? No,

Unknown Speaker  2:57:15
that's perfect. I like that. I would want that.

Unknown Speaker  2:57:27
I don't know if underproof demand is down the road, but yeah, 100 proof you DBA, absolutely.

Unknown Speaker  2:57:42
So what I could do,

Speaker 1  2:57:46
like, if you feel like, this is the cornerstone, and not Matthias Miller, most people would do Matthias Miller, right? The personal brand, but you're this is more like a company brand. I

Speaker 3  2:58:00
let me

Unknown Speaker  2:58:21
give you access. Let me create the page and give you access to it page.

Unknown Speaker  2:58:41
Let me start by connecting with you.

Speaker 1  2:58:47
I've, I'm like so off LinkedIn, I I do it for my clients. I never.

Unknown Speaker  2:58:55
You have 73 connections about to be 74

Unknown Speaker  2:58:59
that's a substantial percentage Increase.

Unknown Speaker  2:59:11
Like, oh, oh, okay, I got it. Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  2:59:26
clarity,

Unknown Speaker  2:59:28
connection, courage.

Unknown Speaker  2:59:43
Anyway, did

Unknown Speaker  2:59:56
you accept it?

Unknown Speaker  2:59:58
Sorry? I'm I'm.

Unknown Speaker  3:00:05
My Network.

Unknown Speaker  3:00:13
Okay, okay, so now you've got access to that if you want to set anything up, mostly the header, and obviously I need to register the DBA, but that's Easy, and then we can

Unknown Speaker  3:00:56
add experience With title. I

Speaker 1  3:01:20
Oh, you know what? This is your separate this is your separate company page. So it's not good,

Speaker 2  3:01:30
but it allows me to enter create a an experience. Sorry,

Speaker 1  3:01:33
that's what I wanted. Yeah, that's what I wanted. Do you need the the you capitalized your preview.

Unknown Speaker  3:01:43
No, but you can change it. I

Unknown Speaker  3:01:52
don't know how to select the company. In my experience,

Speaker 1  3:02:00
I sorry, can you share your screen? I'm not sure what you're trying to edit.

Unknown Speaker  3:02:17
Oh, company name, 100 proof you it's know, capital Y, that's you can't do y ou,

Unknown Speaker  3:02:34
yeah, the review, it's not linking out to, it's supposed to link out to the i it supposed to be drop in the drop list, oh, oh to the actual company page.

Unknown Speaker  3:02:51
Well, maybe, maybe give it a minute, a few minutes.

Speaker 2  3:03:00
Okay, well, let's save starters. Never mind. Let's leave it okay. Well, I gotta drop off and I gotta call and then we can reconvene. All

Unknown Speaker  3:03:18
right, have a good

Unknown Speaker  3:03:20
call. Thanks. Bye.
