Speaker 1  04:34
Did you poke into the zoom thing? See if you could get your settings I got that switched over to them. All right

Unknown Speaker  10:42
guys hello okay where do you want to go

Unknown Speaker  10:56
all right

Speaker 2  11:07
started making some progress on FB incidents and stuff so I guess you were seeing some of that happening

Speaker 1  11:13
yeah yes yep so that we have a little lap in our in our emailing to the client too so I the one will mean overlap because it's just a question we both asked him about the SP members were doing Oh got it I hadn't included support at in my email to him so sure yeah I guess and then being cute emailed him about one of the other jobs too that I get ready to or something and so he was going to email so is that were you wanting to take some of those are we just not

Speaker 2  12:00
necessarily I was just I was just trying to wrap my mind around what was going on that's fine the so it looks to me like so all businesses and schools need counties so on those what it's looking like to me so the Do you have a sense on on these what is urgent what is important

Speaker 1  12:37
I don't think we have any that are are super urgent. Like the Yeah, I think things are okay for now just been we should have stuff by cutover

Unknown Speaker  12:59
those are encoding

Speaker 2  13:01
now the address one is probably urgent isn't it? Oh maybe we should go well, the double name and do they have do they have the Duck Duck thing fixed or whatever whatever that was the bad return address

Speaker 1  13:21
yeah lucky duck excuse me the that one

Unknown Speaker  13:40
rounds in code review looks like

Speaker 1  13:50
you're not testing yet. And what have they said about this one

Unknown Speaker  14:00
and deadline

Speaker 1  14:14
so the contact number is the other one that we're working on. So yeah, this doesn't say what the deadline is but he does say it is urgent No, I

Unknown Speaker  14:29
wonder if we should just

Speaker 1  14:31
okay, go ahead. Well, given the temporary fix. Also that's delivered already. The temporary fix is Yeah, perfect. Okay.

Speaker 1  14:45
But yeah, this one and then and the contact ID Yeah, this one year

Unknown Speaker  15:04
Let's see this one actually all of these

Speaker 2  15:14
like the the the well I think we need to go through them with the client there's enough issues I'm going to say that we do need to figure out what they're needing sooner rather than later like the contact the one county one seems serious with primary county so that's my thought offhand I just you know, bunch of this kind of got up a bit with me being gone. And so I just want to make sure that we don't leave them unnecessarily waiting in a really busy season

Speaker 2  15:57
unless you're pretty confident on on how to answer the questions.

Speaker 1  16:00
Well, I think yeah, no, I think it would be that would be good

Speaker 1  16:12
so yeah, probably what would be good to be us try to get him on a call and just go through for list was not an email. Yeah.

Speaker 2  16:26
And you could I mean, some of these maybe when did we do their last system update so I don't know if there's any of these that are in there in that one or not?

Speaker 1  16:39
I don't think so. We just updated system for them over the weekend. Got it. Okay. So

Speaker 1  16:52
okay, I'll make a note on stuff on my calendar for revealing the prioritization today

Unknown Speaker  17:04
Yeah, perfect. Yep. Okay

Unknown Speaker  17:14
all right. So then the next thing would be

Speaker 1  17:30
that's sorry, okay. We have a question here in Z E T. Hit that and then go to some the ZTE case study okay. So the ZTE T yd tallies payments section there was a conversation here about X 30 They wanted to get your input I'll just let you skin that and then read that and give you context.

Speaker 2  19:14
So do we is there anything in the spec that talks about when we update do the daily update of the payment of the automatic payment information

Unknown Speaker  19:42
so we wouldn't have

Unknown Speaker  19:52
we'd have a payment record that talks about about some of these beings but I'm not sure that it talks about the x 30

Unknown Speaker  20:14
I think we've got something somewhere

Speaker 1  20:21
payments section which we'll be talking about here your vendor your tele vendor and tract

Speaker 1  20:35
yeah there is like a payment ID that is filled with the Confirm checkbox

Speaker 1  20:54
we don't have a section in here in this proposal for for the next 30 days background but there's gonna be some tasks like we were we did for Senators

Unknown Speaker  21:27
processing down payments and expenses

Speaker 2  21:49
okay payment idea daily process this is under down payments we have a daily process runs at three game to set this. So that's that is the payment I mean, that's the closest that we have

Speaker 1  22:32
I think the main question Yeah, question is, should we should it all be combined into one scheduled task?

Speaker 2  22:40
Yeah, it can be one scheduled task I mean, we should document it but it can be one scheduled task at 3am a scheduled task and run more than one import

Unknown Speaker  22:51
okay

Speaker 1  22:54
is there any way there will be more coding work for them to since they already have two separate ones like to combine them? Is it worth that to have less clutter we're not necessarily you have

Speaker 2  23:08
I don't have any problem with having it be to have a scheduled task that has two different ones that's reasonable I mean, I it's pretty it's almost stylistic which way we go with it. So okay, yeah, I don't think I probably I don't it just doesn't matter too much. At this point I just have a scheduled task with two lines in it

Unknown Speaker  23:33
okay

Speaker 2  23:38
and but let's do a document scheduled task in the in the spec

Speaker 1  24:06
All right. And Austin is still needing this command. So guess this will be

Speaker 2  24:23
I think I asked I asked to na Han to take care of this and reach out to McAfee if you don't hear from him or preemptively reach out from him. I think I emailed him about it. Okay, but if but I don't mind you all you preemptively chasing that

Speaker 1  24:43
Okay sounds good. All right. So then in ZTE K and design

Speaker 1  25:15
All right so we have these three a ready to go except for your questions okay obsessed

Speaker 1  25:38
Alright, so phase three A is regions check ins and so forth questions here has to do with how to approach the check in month on the incident record. So when we have a check in type incident we currently have a check in dt and now they're just going to the month for for scheduled check ins that are scheduled based on the customers region this month gets filled in automatically when we create the scheduled check in so they're due for a check in in the month of November sure we but there they could also do one off check ins where it's guy happens to be in the area the client just stopped checking in or whatever the case may be. So we were not sure about whether we should have this be a required field or we should call it a scheduled check in month to just check in month so we had we talked to the client about it should be for manually checking create check ins we require it so it always hasn't gone which definitely be for scheduled check ins that are planned for the future and he was wanting to say a ladder since more has to do with scheduled

Speaker 1  27:26
but anyways, as we're thinking through here should this be a to purchase one we always require check in month one would be to include this logic here where we have the scheduled check in month required if there's a due date set and and then whatnot then update stuff in the check ins report he was fine then with which is always requiring the check in once with the drop list and you'll also like the idea of having a month if it's required all the time have it set auto set based on the duty to set a due date we'll just set the check in month to match the same month it's kind of a bunch of of just gonna surely show me the

Unknown Speaker  28:23
market Yes.

Unknown Speaker  28:44
Let's check in monthly we'll be setting a due date for some of them

Speaker 2  28:56
for the automatically created ones, what is the due date set to

Speaker 1  29:01
it's not set to anything it's just like blank. The due date is just when they you know for all the ones that are due for check ins this month and they would go through and and set a due date manually based on planning to check on this one this day or that day.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
Do you give any warnings or anything if they're out of sync?

Unknown Speaker  29:28
Or not necessarily?

Unknown Speaker  29:31
Not necessarily. I don't think we would.

Unknown Speaker  29:41
So you're saying and this is only to pull up the incident again. This is only for check in types Right? Right.

Speaker 2  30:08
yeah the easiest thing to do okay what we can do is if if the type is check in then when you set the due date week and the check in month is blank we can then we can we can default the check in month for you and if but we won't then if you change it we won't change it. So basically that we will will will make check in month required I guess we will and if they close it okay make checking lens required when closing a when closing a check in incident fill in or set check in month to the month of the closed date if checking date is blank or checking month is blank set it to the month of the close date and then when setting due date if it's blank set it to the month of the due date how's that

Speaker 2  31:38
and yes, have we talked about what the drop list is for the month checkbox?

Unknown Speaker  31:49
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:50
okay 12 more months sure fine yep

Unknown Speaker  32:00
How do you like that design?

Unknown Speaker  32:04
I think it's good. I

Speaker 2  32:05
do want to do you want an arrow Do you want it required or do you want a warning of checking month is not specified? I'm only I'm a little bit concerned about existing check in records because the worst thing that happens is they get an extra check in because they forgot to fill it in

Speaker 2  32:28
so I might just warn if it's a check in check in month is not specified. Does that make it required?

Unknown Speaker  32:36
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  32:43
No, it makes sense

Unknown Speaker  32:57
Sure

Speaker 1  33:02
Okay, well plan to work on that then some extreme is so there was that question that one the check in reports

Unknown Speaker  33:18
Oh, yeah, we just need to set adjust that accordingly. And then that should be it then for Phase Three a so

Speaker 1  33:39
Ben and I should be able to get that one of us should work on that today or tomorrow morning and and then that's ready for your reader price.

Speaker 2  33:51
Yeah, send me another email once it's for sure. For sure. Ready? And then we'll go from there.

Unknown Speaker  33:56
All right. Make a new shooter

Speaker 1  34:18
Okay, so there's that. Then the fillers boards, a little design. We we finished up that draft?

Speaker 2  34:33
Yeah, I saw the email I've got that's on my list of things to look at. So I'll try to take a look at that then. So is there no web interface on the on this system? Or what will the when you I mean, or is there a web interface plant?

Unknown Speaker  34:52
Yes, good question.

Unknown Speaker  35:05
So this would be

Unknown Speaker  35:17
they would be I think

Speaker 1  35:32
we need to why is it? are laying? Okay. So we need to actually get a little bit more input from the class on this. I think he was planning to have a whiskey interface

Speaker 1  36:03
that the login page would be like it'd be their existing website, real login page. And then beyond that was the interface. But I would say don't quote me on that, because I can't remember for sure. That somewhere

Unknown Speaker  36:21
you had history notes there that looked interesting. Where's that? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  36:28
So these were Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  36:45
Okay, fair.

Unknown Speaker  36:53
So

Speaker 2  36:53
so is the, is it basically just administering the will will they see, or we don't even know yet?

Unknown Speaker  37:02
What all will be on the

Unknown Speaker  37:04
what is the web interface for clients? It's payment, Is it anything else?

Speaker 1  37:10
It will be? It will be the, so they would go to the overview here. So, they would be the browser website would have a question, they would click the button that will take them to the splash page. And then from there, yeah, then they could create an account. They could log in, and then they could view a list of pathway options. The reason of course, is that, the features and so you have your list of those with. So you'd be able to see the pathway records, details of those. And you'd be able to set up a subscription record with different preferences and participants. And then go see your order overview and make your payment. So and then presumably, they will also be able to see their their own account, like their realization, contact record, sure. Where they can change the board representative or change somebody's contact information or something like that.

Speaker 2  38:42
I'm gonna show the sample pathway. I'm just curious to see that a bit. Down. Right there. Yeah.

Speaker 1  38:50
So this is what the sample a given to us what what a pathway looks like. Sure.

Speaker 2  39:06
The how many, what are the user accounts like on this? Do you have one user account per organization? Because I'm pretty sure we don't want to have user accounts reach the individual has that's gonna be expensive for them.

Speaker 1  39:21
Right. So it would be one user account for organic organization and.

Speaker 1  39:33
And it would be based on the organization record, not sort of like the board rep will be the one the only one with login access, right. But the logged in user profile will be linked to the organization record. Yep, rather than an individual record. Yep. At this point, we're not planning to have individual contacts. God, I'm just backing the organization and then the participants are on and RG Sure. realizations. Nice. Yeah. So yeah, we wouldn't even have organization login based on organization, login email. Sure. And then with the payments, the straight we'll be using Stripe payment method record. But we also need to follow up on this a little bit more. They also want to be able to take check payments. Sure the class is going to be following up on that, I think to us see what we need to do to track check payments. Sure. So Yep. Got it.

Speaker 2  40:58
She remember what they were planning to charge for this to board?

Speaker 1  41:06
Had we been Do you remember, we heard any numbers? Less than $200? Or the two year programs like $200 per seat for the pathways stands out to me, but I can't remember for sure. 252 50

Speaker 2  41:24
is the number I've always had in my head. But okay, sure. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  41:36
Yep. Good. Good. Good. No, it's looks interesting. It'll be fun to take a look at it.

Speaker 1  41:51
Okay, good. So yeah, that we need to finish that one up. Yep. Things that I was forgetting about there. Oh, right. So

Speaker 1  42:14
let's see in the 15 minutes we have left here. What's been good investing?

Speaker 1  42:25
Probably now that goes up the GTK stuff. Probably a few GTK things unless l is there any other jobs that were items that she wanted to work on? No,

Unknown Speaker  42:37
I'm still catching. Okay.

Speaker 1  42:51
At some point, we might be seeing some point, we're going to need to do some optimizations on our proposals. Okay. When I get this long, yeah, they get really slow. Sure. And it's excruciatingly slow to add a row or to do the work here and in the RG?

Speaker 2  43:21
Probably. Well, I'm guessing several, the sooner we could we could take a look a little bit of whether there's something simple we can do to speed it up. Seth would be fantastic. I don't know if he's gonna have time before next summer, but I'm sure we can do something at some point. So.

Speaker 1  43:46
Sure. Okay, first question. This is something that I found recently. We're going to be giving them a customized version of the standard incident report with some columns, hidden column moved and a column added. And it appears that there

Unknown Speaker  44:14
that we didn't actually give that to you I would this be something that just let's just write up a change request for?

Unknown Speaker  44:25
I think that'd be fine.

Unknown Speaker  44:27
And because yeah, it doesn't have the doesn't have those changes of these columns hidden and whatnot. Okay, so I was playing around with change request a return request. And

Speaker 2  44:45
yeah, and I'll probably add some comments on how I wanted to wanted to implement it. So

Unknown Speaker  44:50
yeah, we

Speaker 1  45:19
All right, so got questions about notifications here. Okay. So we have this report alert that occurs if an agreement has been pending for at least a week. Is this wondering, is this a background process or like a, like a background process that runs once a day to catch these that sit on right?

Speaker 2  45:46
No, it's just a simple report alert. So if you want to document this somewhere because I think these are do you have any documentation right now the difference between a report alert and a notification and a what do we call the other things database trigger notification real time? Real Time notification? Yep. Yeah. So once you pull up the documentation, let's see how close it is to answering the answering this question here.

Speaker 1  46:56
That is it that's where it should be.

Unknown Speaker  47:45
Interesting

Unknown Speaker  48:19
it's interesting that it's not sure enough even though the data

Unknown Speaker  48:25
is in history, or archive notes

Unknown Speaker  48:28
or it could be it's not an archive notes

Speaker 2  48:32
unless it's fit if finding malt is doing individual word searches or something I don't know

Speaker 1  48:38
things that could go Oh that's true yeah no, I know that we had discussed it with Matthias and he had given us some

Speaker 2  48:57
Yeah, I thought I had also given Um, let me see if I can find an email all right, I thought somewhere I'd also provide a document the differences between the two I thought we had that documented

Unknown Speaker  49:18
seeing this

Speaker 2  49:47
Well, so is that training wiki document the best place to do it?

Speaker 1  49:52
I think this one is the best place to do it because it's it looks like he Vyas started it for that.

Speaker 2  50:00
Okay um if you stop your screenshare I'll start mine if I'm allowed to

Unknown Speaker  50:12
shouldn't be oh sorry

Speaker 1  50:47
okay found it in the easy tally I found these notes from you chips

Unknown Speaker  51:16
there we go yeah that's what I remember

Speaker 1  51:35
and then I see a note there as well see ws 0123 for an in depth comparison between alerts and notification I'm not sure what ws

Unknown Speaker  51:50
that's probably in

Unknown Speaker  52:01
that one

Unknown Speaker  52:20
not that one either W s 123

Unknown Speaker  52:30
Yeah

Speaker 2  52:33
I think it's an app posting now it shouldn't be I don't think we don't have 123 there

Unknown Speaker  53:10
so that one either were with ws 123 V so just W s 123 with no nothing in between

Unknown Speaker  53:27
yeah this is no it says W and it's not it's not a link either

Unknown Speaker  53:44
Is there anything not anything clients group is it

Unknown Speaker  53:46
no we don't yeah well well I checked there it doesn't look like that's the

Speaker 2  54:01
see there it would be as a man looks

Unknown Speaker  54:11
and doesn't look like it because it looks that looks like an app hosting it because it's shorter

Speaker 2  54:23
unless that was just a placeholder. And that maybe that was just a placeholder. We just stuck it in there to point to this one then. Once we get it. I wonder I don't know. That's my best guess.

Unknown Speaker  55:36
Think this is true

Speaker 2  1:01:06
I'm trying to remember how many users we can actually show a trigger for at a time

Unknown Speaker  1:01:24
No that's real time notifications on when I search for apps

Unknown Speaker  1:02:26
that's for client services

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
shoot

Unknown Speaker  1:02:57
users okay yes multiple it can be set to multiple users

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
watch types

Unknown Speaker  1:03:30
okay

Speaker 2  1:03:57
it's interesting investor tools I was thinking about switching the taskbar let's call it the sidebar but on the sidebar

Speaker 1  1:04:47
just remembered I have a call here with Austin. Sure, again so, I should drop but this is like it's gonna be really helpful to have it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Great, great. I'll wrap this up then and then just save it. Once I'm done editing, you should be able to see it. So. Okay. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
Yeah, thank you. Yep, we'll see
