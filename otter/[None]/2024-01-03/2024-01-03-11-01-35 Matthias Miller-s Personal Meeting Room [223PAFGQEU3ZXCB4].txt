Unknown Speaker  00:31
Hello, hello, hello

Unknown Speaker  00:49
Hey there. Hi, Audra.

Speaker 1  00:58
First of all, sorry, Matthias for not updating you on the 10 o'clock this morning that, that that won't work. So,

Matthias Miller  01:04
yeah, no worries. We ended up going through a whole bunch of project related stuff and getting our act together and I started hunting down some mysterious discrepancies that have been plaguing us so

Speaker 1  01:31
well, I feel like I'm probably more out of the loop to anyone. So you want to start with the with otters list? Or I guess it's up to you where you want to start?

Matthias Miller  01:45
Yeah, well, could we could we maybe start and I didn't really prepare you very well for this. But can we start with a pretty high level? First, first of all dev priorities is February 2, it may remember Great. Yes. And so we got about a month and high level priorities for January I think are let me see if I got this right and see if you agree or disagree. But it's basically number one, blow away old accounting, any old accounting data that we need to or figure out how to make a clean transition? And number two, all the bug fixes that are popping up as a result of us. Like I, I think it's a bunch of odds and ends and chasing things down. But is there any? Are there any better objectives that we've got for? Jamie January besides besides that?

Speaker 1  02:47
Well, no, I think that's correct, I think I'd be tempted to say that the priority of those should possibly be switched around fixed boxes, and fixed the bug fixes first and then clean up the accounting data. The reason for that is we still have a bunch of work on our site to do before we're ready to

Unknown Speaker  03:12
clean out those old transactions. That's my the only Yeah, only thing I have to

Matthias Miller  03:19
do. And then if we wanted to translate this from just a here tasks to do to an outcome to accomplish, we are basically looking to have Dwayne's team, Drew, and Whitney and whoever else is involved, but have have these folks. Functional, seamlessly functional in in the accounting system. Is that? Is that right? Or is there

Speaker 2  03:55
you're saying as far as if it's not functional, we will say this is a bug that is fixed.

Matthias Miller  04:03
Now I'm saying as far as goals for the month of January. Besides if we shift the goal from just saying, Well, here's the little odds and ends that we need to get done. Okay. Let me ask the question like this. man walked up to a person laying bricks and ask him what he's doing. And the first guy says he's laying bricks, and then he goes to the next guy. The next guy says, Oh, I'm building a wall and then walks up to the third guy, and he's feverishly working away and he asked him What are you doing? Oh, I'm building a cathedral. What's the wall and what's the cathedral for for January? That's my question.

Unknown Speaker  04:47
What's in the wall is is

Speaker 1  04:51
making sure that accounting functions in January bill to pay transactions are recorded. Reconcile Also, we're able to do that, to Cathedral is is to have an income statement for January that is more accurate and more trust. Yeah, more accurate has more accurate data than anything we've had.

Unknown Speaker  05:20
So napkins most recently,

Speaker 1  05:23
and I think, okay, I said Income Statement intentionally because

Unknown Speaker  05:31
I think that's possible for

Speaker 1  05:34
January. It's not what will still be missing in January, by the end of January is accurate. About this year, because of all the cleanup we have. But I don't think that affects Ontario. So incomplete.

Unknown Speaker  05:55
Would you agree with those goals? Yeah, I think so.

Matthias Miller  06:05
Okay, that is. I think that's super, I think that's a little bit of what what I'm trying to get away from is swimming in a sea of? I don't know. Exactly. Talking about mixed metaphors. But yes, that as much as I can.

Unknown Speaker  06:26
You have breaks in your background.

Speaker 1  06:35
Good. I don't know if anybody was taking notes, but that it'd be good to have that actually have that typed up and just in front of us.

Speaker 3  06:44
Yeah, I did jot all that down. So yeah, I think that's great.

Matthias Miller  06:51
All right. I think I think for me, that's enough context to jump in and out if you just want to share your screen, and we'll start walking through through the stuff.

Speaker 3  07:02
Do you want to see? Should I share the team task list? Since everybody's most, that probably?

Matthias Miller  07:09
I think that's fair.

Unknown Speaker  07:10
Okay. All right. Let me get that pulled up.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
All right.

Speaker 3  07:25
So I guess with those objectives in mind, are we going to prioritize based on are going to move around some due dates to get things prioritized correctly? Is that the the idea here?

Unknown Speaker  07:38
I think so. Okay.

Speaker 3  07:43
Okay, so I'm just starting with you, Matthias, on top here. All right.

Matthias Miller  07:51
Well, better sections of income statement. Does that mean, that was just I mean, I don't know anything better than just going down the list. But yeah. This is presumably something that's we're looking to have?

Matthias Miller  08:11
Or what level of importance is this particular one?

Unknown Speaker  08:21
Hasn't that been fixed?

Speaker 2  08:25
looked at those have been changed or not? What I was what I ran into a difference of which accounts showed up based on which level I was viewing, if I was doing only level one accounts or level five, there would be like something might be in a level three account. And then you've never showed up. In the level one parent account when I just went level one. What was the date on this fix being done?

Speaker 3  09:05
Let me see. I put the comment in mid December that Joel had said the issue with only viewing level one accounts had been fixed as of today. So that was December 13. I think not entirely sure. But it should have been right around that hasn't worked on any of the others. I don't have an update to that. Right at the moment.

Speaker 1  09:24
You are short on things. Like a shortcut. didn't need it when we were trying to show that income statement example. But he said it requires a long term or a deeper fee.

Speaker 2  09:35
Yes, yes. And then the next time that I went open his commercial link. It didn't give me any to give me a code page.

Speaker 3  09:45
Okay, I might have captured that in a different task. So let me to myself here.

Speaker 2  09:50
So So yeah, I don't have his long term fix on that one. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:59
Do we You'd probably get an update from Bill jaw.

Unknown Speaker  10:04
Yep. Okay.

Speaker 1  10:05
Is that what you're doing? Or you're getting an update from Joel? Yeah,

Speaker 3  10:09
I'm gonna write that down to get an update from him. And I can, I can do that. So in context of what you just said about January goals is this. How important is that to your income statement? for January? We

Speaker 1  10:24
wouldn't need it by by end of January. You would okay. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  10:29
No, I wouldn't really be anything we would need. You know, then before them, but we need to buy them.

Speaker 1  10:37
I think be prudent to test habit, you know, no, later than the 20th so that we can test and make sure that it is working correctly.

Speaker 3  10:55
Kind of tag here, temporarily.

Unknown Speaker  11:01
There we go. Okay. Okay, sounds good. I'm printing

Matthias Miller  11:13
void capabilities. Some of these, we might have to move into high, medium and low. We have manual workarounds. It's not pretty but we do.

Unknown Speaker  11:32
Okay,

Matthias Miller  11:34
Drew, do you have input on checkpointing? As priority?

Unknown Speaker  11:39
Um

Speaker 2  11:46
I would not put it as high priority a some other things. Because I do know how to work around it. So that could maybe be a February thing. If we have too many January things.

Matthias Miller  12:07
Can we tentatively put it? I mean, even even putting it end of year end of January normal priority? Well, actually, it's not quite accurate or February. Early, early February.

Unknown Speaker  12:25
With normal priority.

Unknown Speaker  12:29
Nope. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  12:36
There we go. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:40
The warning? This is

Matthias Miller  12:48
yeah, this is this is the warning when modifying the chart of accounts, which is in progress. Kind of thing. This is a another February. February things that right? I mean, you can't wait until then.

Speaker 1  13:08
Everything so you know how to work around it. Right. And it also you're just it's an issue you're aware of? And then this is also

Unknown Speaker  13:20
that propose?

Speaker 1  13:24
Fixed, you'd send out an email in the class saying that there was one of the developers came up with a solution on how to handle this. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:38
I'm happy to explain it. I don't know that I need to go into that drew, that doesn't make sense for any reason. I'm happy to know

Speaker 2  13:43
that makes sense. And with our, with our cleanup of old data that would take care of a bunch of old transactions that are hanging out in parent accounts to

Speaker 1  13:59
Oh, sure, you'd set you're not I mean, it's not worth really chasing those. It's and moving forward. It shouldn't happen at all. Unless we change the chart of accounts, right? That's when

Speaker 2  14:12
you read up at our current rate BIOS hypothetical times.

Matthias Miller  14:20
See how that goes. better handling and labor intensive buildings.

Speaker 1  14:28
That I mean, that's a February or March thing. Okay. I would say March if we I mean, unless we're gonna

Matthias Miller  14:40
I mean, there's nothing that keeps us from working faster than and I mean, it's not like they're going to keep us from doing ourselves because the deadlines out too far.

Speaker 3  14:49
Agreed. They'll rise to the top so I would err in that direction as well. You mean

Unknown Speaker  14:54
sooner, like do February instead?

Speaker 3  14:58
I actually later I mean, So in terms of prioritization, right, if something's a little less important, but you move through your work faster, then that'll naturally rise to the top and we'll see it. So human

Speaker 1  15:09
nature tends to prioritize, like, say, I can do about, or at least for me, like twice what I can do over three times in a month's time. And then yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:19
exactly.

Matthias Miller  15:23
Let's also account for all the emails that are waiting to be sent between now and the end of the month. By default GL accounts to the standard employees report. It's not, this is inexpensive. I mean, it's not. It's a pretty simple thing, but just haven't gotten to the top. What's the priority for you guys?

Speaker 4  15:50
Okay, what did you say? I'm sorry? Oh, February. Okay. Okay, great.

Matthias Miller  16:02
Um, this one? I didn't completely understand. I think I took a note off of a call. And do you think you were wanting a report on Uncategorized? The category expense GL account with a payment type column? This would be for all vendor invoices with Uncategorized expenses?

Unknown Speaker  16:28
No.

Speaker 2  16:31
So I'm categorizing the account on categorized expenses is an account where I put everything that came in on it on a credit card statement, maybe that was right, it was not already in the system that we need to go hunt down what its origin works. So that's why I would want the Payment Type column available so that I can just print that report and send it to the managers and say, this payment type was used to make this purchase? You know, you can chase down the information trying to find a receipt, or what was it or whatever. So that's the use case for that.

Matthias Miller  17:11
So could we just give you a rather than payment type? Could we just group it by the corresponding debit credit count?

Unknown Speaker  17:23
That would work? Yeah.

Speaker 1  17:25
Who had we talked? Have you talked to Joel about this? No, there was some kind of I mean, would it be helpful for Matthias to look at to take a quick look at what how you're using it currently? Or do you do not have any Uncategorized expense?

Speaker 2  17:39
There would be some Yeah, there'll be some Uncategorized expense?

Speaker 1  17:43
Or maybe maybe he's scoring off on this now. If

Speaker 2  17:47
we were if we were well, we had talked about using a system where you can say okay, if it if it uses both of these GL accounts, right. Like that was kind of the fix for this I think

Matthias Miller  18:03
that is right, that rings a bell so either this comes down to a ledger report that matches all selected accounts

Unknown Speaker  18:26
Okay, that's the action item

Matthias Miller  18:27
that is that what needs to be done priority on this one is what

Unknown Speaker  18:40
earlier is better? Yeah. Next week okay. things it's just a report we'll push on it that way

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Okay, okay.

Matthias Miller  19:03
Payments are categorized by builder district and deposited by sorry, categorized by dealer district and positive by builder district. So, just scroll down to the comments we had

Speaker 3  19:14
I don't know if we have comments I've got the email

Matthias Miller  19:23
I wasn't completely sure okay. So when you when you do receive payment is this is on the receive payments report, or is this also on the See, let's go take a look receive payments report. We are matching by

Speaker 1  19:46
this was primarily for sheds reg payments, was it no yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:50
that's where it comes in.

Matthias Miller  19:52
So and so we should go ahead.

Speaker 1  19:54
Till now. We've been kind of sloppy with defining which distro It says direct dealers were in. And therefore, some of those sales order some of those payments were recorded, say in Indiana, but it was actually their payment looked like it was made to Indiana, but the deposit for Ohio? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  20:27
Yeah, I know, I know the issue. Andre, can you just texted you something, can you? And then the same is also true for

Unknown Speaker  20:46
that

Speaker 1  20:48
I mean, this drill when you say this, this is mainly historical buildings, old stuff, where we're going to, well,

Speaker 2  20:58
if we if we clean up the district that the dealers are in

Speaker 1  21:04
which we and we have been working with Josh to do that. So I don't know that this

Matthias Miller  21:10
is it's a simple fix. And it's, I would make an argument that it should be cleaned up anyway. Okay.

Speaker 2  21:17
One of the things that I ran into was, there was a payment, or multiple it was multiple building payment, and I tied them together in one payment. But that Complete Payment did not show up in the payments to deposit it was still split by the buildings that were split in the different dealer districts. So

Matthias Miller  21:44
alright, so priority on this

Speaker 2  21:59
for depositing payments, you know, it's an everyday thing. Not every day, but it's it's gonna happen this week. Yeah, it's gonna happen next week. So probably sooner rather than later. Structures. Just more

Matthias Miller  22:18
important to work around. And so is it more important than the one we have for next week?

Unknown Speaker  22:25
No, probably not. Want to ETA for

Matthias Miller  22:32
marketing next week?

Speaker 2  22:33
It's the day after that other ones next week, the day after the other one.

Matthias Miller  22:39
That works.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
There we go. I guess like,

Matthias Miller  22:46
kind of impact errors? I think this is in your?

Unknown Speaker  22:53
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:55
Okay. vendor invoices are linked to parent accounts. We said we're gonna wait historical data is going to clean that out ledger accounts that are mapped in the accounting system. Okay. Goes in your court, I think the main thing, what I would like to do is put accounting impact errors in your record. And if you need help, troubleshooting anything you bring me in. And if this might be something for later in the month after we've cleaned up old data and gotten rid of old data that we run this and just look for kind of a look for discrepancies. Is there any kind of other process we should have on these errors that brings them to your attention? Like do we want? These are really obnoxious bits? What why you do them but like daily emails, when there are records with accounting impact errors?

Speaker 2  23:56
Was this this accounting impact? Or was that the one where you just let me know what it said and IMS was one cent different.

Matthias Miller  24:06
That's a different, that's a different issue. To this, this is looking at things where for some reason, there's something wonky with the data in IMS. And because of that, we're not able to generate a valid transaction. So somebody has a PIO, somebody created a new ledger account didn't tie it out to the chart of accounts. Therefore, we can't push it across or somebody creates a deposit a deposit for X amount, but doesn't tie out the correct dollar amount of payments to that deposit, et cetera, et cetera. So it's all it should predominantly be. Or it should exclusively be user error of some kind.

Unknown Speaker  24:56
Some some incomplete entry.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
Really, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  25:02
And Drew needs to know about it so that he can either fix it or get someone to fix it so that transactions are accounting transactions are correct, right? That's

Matthias Miller  25:18
right. Yeah. Otherwise those items will be excluded from accounting.

Speaker 2  25:25
So you have a transaction import or impact report. Right. Right on the menu? I'm not sure if I looked at that. What does that have?

Unknown Speaker  25:41
Um, well, the

Matthias Miller  25:49
well, okay, sorry. So we've got, I mean, we've got a few of them. We've got under accounting impact, we've got transaction errors, which is what this one is talking about. Then we've got you can view the transactions to be created from IMS and all related records. There's

Matthias Miller  26:14
but there may be other reports that you might be thinking about as well, like more expensive report, etc.

Unknown Speaker  26:20
Could we? I mean, should we? Should we just look at it briefly. Matthias, can you just show us?

Speaker 1  26:29
Your question is how to best communicate that to Drew day in and day out moving forward? Like, is it something drew just, you just got to look at it every week, every day? Or should it? Well notice?

Speaker 2  26:43
What's the report? Showing? Oh,

Speaker 4  26:49
let's take a quick look here, report because I need to stop.

Matthias Miller  26:55
There we go. Create transaction, okay. It's, it is a horribly slow report. Oh, it's not even faster way. I only do it on a few records. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  27:16
it's gonna take a minute.

Matthias Miller  27:18
As we basically have to read any record that can impact

Unknown Speaker  27:24
impacted County

Matthias Miller  27:27
I guess you could speed it up, if you would go to have a fast mode, where it only looks at records that aren't in the accounting system at this point. So you would find problems that you might not find problems that were created today. New problems from today, but you'd find problems that existed as of last night.

Speaker 1  27:59
So while it loads, like just enough? What logic does this report use to say that something's an error?

Matthias Miller  28:09
Sure. It's, it is anything like you have blank lines, you have a blank account. In your debit credit, you have your debits and credits don't add up.

Matthias Miller  28:33
Or there's no amount on this line item. Or we're trying to assign it to a parent account, which should not have a transaction. Like that might happen if somebody sets up a ledger account incorrectly or I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  28:51
Rearrange stuff, Sarah.

Matthias Miller  29:02
So most of these right now, I think it took a look at some of them. Some of them I cleaned up. It looks to me like

Speaker 1  29:13
it is the date on the far left, is that the date tried to push

Unknown Speaker  29:19
to a county.

Matthias Miller  29:21
Yeah, that's the date. That's the date of the transaction that it's trying to create. Yes.

Speaker 1  29:28
And if it's listed here, it did not push the accounting or it still pushed to accounting and also listed in here. It

Matthias Miller  29:35
did not okay, because we can't I mean, we can't for example, we can't push this across because we don't have an account for this. And if we don't have this row, we're going to have an imbalance that a credit

Speaker 2  29:51
and this would all be stuff that currently it should warn them if something new is created along these lines.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
Well sure,

Matthias Miller  30:07
it looks to me like we have

Unknown Speaker  30:15
we have

Matthias Miller  30:19
well wait a match ledger accounts, revenue, discounts, returns and allowances ledger. Now it looks to me if I'm looking at this right, that we've got these accounts that are not mapping to the chart of accounts. So

Speaker 1  30:46
mean, we're using these accounts

Matthias Miller  30:58
if we go into returns and allowances, I mean, I would expect this thing to specify.

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Yeah, that

Unknown Speaker  31:16
but it's not.

Matthias Miller  31:22
So I guess one of the questions is what when you create

Speaker 2  31:29
those probably aren't those are new, those are both new accounts that are probably just did not connect anything to them. Because at the time, there was nothing. Like, when I created the new account and assist, it had to go to Aaron, he had to create the the IMS GL account. So there was nothing we connected to Yeah. Yeah, that's probably what it was,

Matthias Miller  31:55
Oh, I'm gonna guess ledger accounts missing mismatch linking on ledger accounts are going to be the majority of the issues.

Speaker 4  32:07
Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  32:14
Well, the good news is you're gonna catch us at your monthly reconciliation, you're going to try to figure out why a payment wasn't recorded.

Unknown Speaker  32:21
Right? Right.

Matthias Miller  32:23
Or while you're, you're going to reconcile your AR groups or your AP and find out that there was something missing, that'd be nice not to have to go digging through all kinds of stuff to find this problem. But right,

Speaker 2  32:35
it'd be kind of a first place to check you know, if I find something missing somewhere in the reconcile column first place to see Oh, isn't here.

Matthias Miller  32:44
Yeah, I mean, you can you can first do it here and then do it. Or, you know, either way

Speaker 2  32:52
is, let's bring up a question. Is there a way to search IMS by dollar amount? Know, Like there's supposed to be a payment for $583 on the bank account. It's not there search by IMS for for an invoice that would have been that amount

Matthias Miller  33:16
invoice total payment amounts either were

Speaker 2  33:22
either or basically if that number anywhere that number might show up because the payment amount or total for sure. line item on an invoice not as crucial as I mean it's not really one of the places where where we would need to see it because I'm going to enter it that way anyway. So payment amount or total I would say you get

Speaker 4  33:54
needed back with my

Matthias Miller  34:06
purchase system, if they don't notice orders would have a

Unknown Speaker  34:14
pod while.

Speaker 2  34:29
He's going to search that amount and the counting was not there because the whole transaction never moved. And then it got there. On the side. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  34:45
The other thing we could do is to be a little bit of work that we could do is give you a

Unknown Speaker  34:59
Right.

Matthias Miller  35:07
Now, I don't know that that's helpful. Okay, well, we will. Okay, so this one here

Matthias Miller  35:31
priority on this prompting from our

Unknown Speaker  35:36
middle of the middle of January.

Speaker 1  35:41
Now, Matthias, this this report, when you created it was your intent more, that it's something that should be looked at every day, every week to be more proactive on catching those, rather than after the fact? Or is it?

Matthias Miller  36:02
I mean, I think it's all based. I mean, I don't know that there's a single right answer A, we cringe a little bit about having something that didn't get pushed for two months. And so he creates a manual transaction, and then we push one automatically? I don't know. But I think you guys have, okay, what I was envisioning Yes. Like this, something like this goes sideways, it shows up in deal with it right away. But realistically, it doesn't really have to be addressed until you reconcile your statements. So it's not likely to create wildly varying numbers, it's not going to be accurate. But it's

Speaker 1  36:52
that's fair. Right? We could so start out using it like a report to help troubleshoot if we're running into issues when reconciling. Right. And then if no, if we I don't know. But I mean, if we always run into, we always run into 20 issues that we might, you might come to the point where you say, Well, I want to start using this weekly or daily seeing on top of it. So I can do my reconcile. But

Matthias Miller  37:23
here's here, here's one option. We could disallow your, your, we can keep Dwayne's office from selecting ledger accounts that don't have an associated financial account. And they're going to come crying on your shoulder during because they have a Pio or vendor invoice they're trying to enter they can't.

Speaker 1  37:48
But okay, clarify that you we still have Chart of Accounts in two different places. Right. And is that the issue? Why it could have?

Matthias Miller  37:56
Yes, so we still have we still have the old ledger accounts, and I'm not sure. I don't I don't know the full story about how that gets used. That's what POS have been using for

Unknown Speaker  38:11
a very long time.

Unknown Speaker  38:13
Oh, that you're only okay.

Speaker 2  38:17
Because that one is that one is compte is like all companies use the same one. Whereas individuals

Speaker 1  38:26
and the only place that the only place that it's used in IMS is where they're assigned to a skews. Excuse shows up and says I am this account. Right. Right. And if that's not if changes are not communicate to Aaron. Oh, okay. So the mistake could happen on on Aaron site, or it could happen. Right now we're allowing Dwayne's office to use those basically use the old list of GL accounts that Magi and that's right.

Speaker 2  39:01
No, or we're allowing them to add them to accounts that are in the accounting side, but not in the IMS side,

Speaker 1  39:12
but but can they when they select an account can they select from old accounts mean they should only be allowed to select something that's currently in the chart of accounts?

Speaker 2  39:26
I think we had we had that issue where they were where the drop down list was bringing inactive accounts but I think that's been fixed.

Matthias Miller  39:35
Okay, so here's what they can do on the purchase order. They can or they can't even do that on the purchase order. Nevermind on the vendor invoice.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Vendor in just vendor invoices. They can override the account on a particular item To the IMS GL accounts, and then under the non purchase order expense accounts. They can, you know, pick also pick IMS GL accounts, but they're able to select ones here that don't have any linking within the accounting system

Speaker 1  40:25
can we make so they can only select? And that's what you were saying. Right? Almost like something? Yeah, I think they mean, is that an expensive fix to me?

Speaker 2  40:41
So, are they going to be able to know what they are asking for? If they come? And say, Hey, this is supposed to be on this GL account, but I can't use it. Are they going to say, Oh, looks like there was no GL account for this? Create a new one?

Speaker 1  41:00
Well, they're not supposed to be. Okay, there's a few things. One, Josh is working on a. So right now what we just saw on the skews, if okay, if the one you selected it's supposed to bring in the the account that was set in IMS, that says whenever you see roofing shingles, whatever it should be this, and it's not so and they have to open it click Save, and then it brings in the right one? Like, yeah, it was not bringing in that. So they were this was one of those. Those one of those, why didn't you tell me moments where they were going back in old invoices looking what they did last time. And Dwayne and Joshua and aware of that, that it was no longer working some change that Josh made, but he knows it. He wants to make sure that auto populates. But for now, when they click on one, they have to select Save, and then that brings in the chart of the columns. So from that standpoint, they should never if there's a purchase order in the system with a SKU, they should never be selecting a SKU or a chart of account, they should or should use what's been predefined. And then on others, that should be communicated to them from each manager, what accounting gets to be used for. But with that, I think they should only be allowed to should only be able to select ones that are mapped to the accounting.

Speaker 2  42:58
Well, in the non PIO, they're going to have stuff that they're going to need to be selecting accounts to,

Speaker 1  43:03
but that information is should be coming to them from the one of the managers saying, Oh, this was for meals and entertainment, this was for employee appreciation. But if we give them the option to

Speaker 2  43:22
well, if they can see the account that it's in, or that like, if the account that they're supposed to use is not connected, I think they should be able to see it there. Okay, we'll just say this account is not connected, contact. Like, if we pick up, they should be allowed, they should be able to see exactly what they're trying to use. And just not be able to use it, if it's going to be a helpful way to remedy the situation. does not include it in the drop down. If it's not even there as an option. They'll think the accounts missing.

Matthias Miller  44:08
I think this is a I'd like to make a proposal that this is a Leann or Dwayne question of how they want to handle that? Because in some ways, yes, it is a missing account. It's only partially set up. That's true. And so and I don't know where the I don't know what list of the builders or district managers are using for district managers are using for for the for these accounts, but they shouldn't have those on their list until

Speaker 1  44:46
Yeah, it is a bit of a juggling act right now. I mean, yeah, Drew owns the chart of accounts in ANSYS and then always tries to update Aaron who in turn tries to update all the builders. And you know, if there's

Speaker 2  44:58
an update me again, and that I can connect them.

Speaker 1  45:04
We have some other work on this as well, as far as they're pushing for more simplifying, like, ways of selecting. It's just a process issues selecting chart of accounts like I

Matthias Miller  45:26
get let's, I'd like to propose this. And I just threw something out that I think perhaps we're gonna have all stakeholders present. So my proposal is, what's the priority for figuring out what we need here? Well,

Speaker 2  45:48
we have that transaction Error Report, which will show these kinds of issues if they have. Correct. I would say with that. Let's not put this to high priority. Well,

Speaker 1  46:02
I think what, what Matthias is saying is, we need to figure out what, what we want on our site before he does any development, right?

Matthias Miller  46:11
Are you probably

Unknown Speaker  46:14
part of the conversation? But

Matthias Miller  46:16
at some point, yes. But I think this is a it does not seem to me like, this is not a showstopper, you're going to find problems, you're going to fix them. This is a better way. It'll make Drew's life easier. But it's not in line with January objectives. So I think, Roger, back to you.

Speaker 3  46:35
Yeah. Okay. So that makes sense. So I've got to see the one you just created, that is going to be March. So I just want to clarify this accounting impact errors. I guess it's in Drew's court, you're basically testing it, is this something that's a January priority to just be reviewing that report? Every day? Or? Or not?

Matthias Miller  46:58
No, just I think

Speaker 2  47:02
it probably won't be every day, but okay. I'd say just Yeah, put in my put it in testing or, like we're trying to now.

Speaker 3  47:14
So maybe February, if we're just kind of breaking things up into months is to go back to Okay. Okay, I just wanted to clarify that and then I've got this one. That is a mid January that we just created. Yeah. vendor invoice prompt for amount. Okay, good. Good, good. Okay, rent own monthly payment rounding error.

Matthias Miller  47:42
All right, I know this has been around for a very long time about a year or so. And I'm going to say this is a march because it's been around so long and nobody's complained. It's a march thing but it needs it's bothersome it should be fixed but

Unknown Speaker  47:54
okay.

Matthias Miller  47:58
Grouping for balance sheets, That's February March.

Unknown Speaker  48:05
February Oh, first of February. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  48:14
Income Statement requests I think Nope. Okay, this is the one where we had the error and so let me is this a duplicate? Or do we well, it's I think we may have considered it to be a duplicate but I'm not sure but actually is a quick version of the standard report in your life system I think

Unknown Speaker  48:57
so we had suppressed account

Matthias Miller  49:01
I'm I'm confused because he said he has he took it took it live, but if you actually go cludes your account balances I'm not sure that we even have the temporary option right now.

Unknown Speaker  49:23
So we need to follow up with Joel on this. Yes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  49:26
But this would be absolutely the January 20 deadline. Okay.

Speaker 3  49:34
So make this a high priority January 20. That on the 19th and 20th. Saturday,

Speaker 4  49:42
okay. Same thing, okay.

Unknown Speaker  49:54
You do. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
management changes, sorry, interruption.

Matthias Miller  50:02
Um, pos and vendor invoices need to be able to tie out to asset assets, which would affect the balance sheet, which I think argues for February or March. Okay.

Speaker 1  50:19
Okay, but But what is this? I thought that we had tested that and we were able to tie vendor invoices to?

Speaker 3  50:41
Wow, this is this is what I have I don't always have all the communication on these. But that's old. Just something recently recently related to this,

Speaker 1  50:52
or as far as drew it, hadn't we had testing assets to the point where we thought everything was

Speaker 2  50:58
yes, working correctly. Yes. Except, I think what this is hitting on is, if there's a PIO, that gets assigned to an asset account, but not to a particular asset. Because it's been I've been getting that flag on reconciling. And part of that reason is there just are no assets there. So is this saying that we need to be able to make that connection?

Matthias Miller  51:36
Correct? On the on the PIO or on the vendor invoice? Well, either one? No, oh,

Unknown Speaker  51:45
there's no asset branded yet. So

Speaker 2  51:50
no, just the ability to say, if it goes into an asset account, say, Okay, what asset is it?

Speaker 1  51:57
And if the asset isn't, but so are we saying that we want to make so that you can, you can assign it to an asset account, before the acid is created, and then later come through and tied to the right acid?

Unknown Speaker  52:11
That's why I'm doing that.

Matthias Miller  52:15
I'm gonna assume that you don't want your Well, I don't know, maybe I should make assumptions. This is the question. The question is, do you want Dwayne's office to be well versed in assets? And do you trust them to tie out these things to the correct asset in your list? And if the answer is yes, then there's no reason why not just do it right when you put it in. But if the answer is no, it takes somebody like Drew or somebody else who actually understands what the assets are and how to tie them out. But we shouldn't have a separate process to come back through and like. And so we need to decide how we want to handle it. Let's not decide now. But let's decide whether this is the February or March.

Speaker 1  52:58
Is this just changes to make that process easier? It still works, right?

Matthias Miller  53:03
It does not work? It will the balance sheet works, but the asset values are going to be incorrect. Andrew gets warnings when he reconciles because they're missing

Unknown Speaker  53:15
because they can't do accounting.

Unknown Speaker  53:16
Now they're making

Unknown Speaker  53:23
Correct? Like, thing is this it's not gonna work till we get the assets in there any warnings aren't gonna go away, I should say.

Speaker 1  53:39
We can't have an accurate balance sheet until we have the acid setup. Right. So you're saying it's, well, you and I didn't really even talk about that. And I would agree, I mean, I'm going to make a note to talk about that process for handling assets but okay, I think I'm understanding the error so I guess

Unknown Speaker  54:04
well, you're moving into March so good. Okay.

Matthias Miller  54:10
Sounds like sounds like one of the next projects coming down the pike is going to be to get the balance sheet working right

Unknown Speaker  54:19
Racker.

Speaker 3  54:26
Already we're at allow attaching statements to reconciles.

Matthias Miller  54:31
This one is part of the statement, reconciliation process which we have a temporary workaround for. That allows us to store some information that hopefully will let us fill in statement information going forward. I instinctively or you know

Matthias Miller  55:00
core core accounting resources are pretty constrained. But apart from resource availability, is this a January or February? That the whole the whole issue of tying out tying reconciliations out to statement records? The index full solution? Is that a February or January, February, March? already?

Speaker 2  55:27
We can say beginning of February, I would want it available for when I reconcile January statements. So you know, to be in January, but it should be pretty early in February.

Matthias Miller  55:43
Let's do it. Let's not stick it into February. Let's make it January priority. Yep. Even if it's January 31. But

Speaker 1  55:52
is this this is only allowing you to attach the bank statement.

Matthias Miller  55:59
Yeah, there's a separate one written up. Also, like

Speaker 1  56:03
creating the reconcile as its own point in time, like an event log.

Speaker 2  56:11
That schedule idea would be for that whole event in time.

Matthias Miller  56:18
Obviously, if I could find honor, it's the 8996 is the incident. Okay. And that's that one needs the same priority as this

Matthias Miller  56:40
vendor invoices do not match accounting. This one, I found the problem. And we're not applying rounding on non Pio line items for non Pio vendor invoices. It's basically one cent differences all over the place. What's the priority? I mean, I'm gonna guess this is actually pretty high priority. I'm not quite sure how you got it to reconcile at this point, Drew, but

Speaker 2  57:11
because I'm expecting all the information to get washed away.

Unknown Speaker  57:15
Okay.

Speaker 2  57:17
Fair. So I use the Yeah, discrepancy. Transactions. But I did the one that I did really, truly reconcile out was two cents off. One time, one cent, you know, and I was like, Okay, I'm not even gonna try to find

Matthias Miller  57:41
all right. So is that a this week thing? Or is that, uh, that doesn't we don't need that until we reconcile thing.

Unknown Speaker  57:50
Um,

Speaker 2  57:55
right. Yeah. Make it January, just like that other reconcile. And the end of January, but

Speaker 1  58:02
they'll be pushing to accounting incorrectly? Yeah, right. Okay. All right.

Matthias Miller  58:13
Okay, push check vendor. And number two accounting. This is actually a little more broad than that. But this is put the vendor name, put vendor names. And I don't know, I can't remember what all it is. It's not just it's, it's, it's for checks. We could do it for deposit line items, if not deposits, that it's not possible.

Unknown Speaker  58:37
anytime, any

Matthias Miller  58:39
transaction that's generated from a vendor invoice to copy the contact name over, as well as do the same thing for checks so that when you pull up the accounting transaction, you see the contact in there, and when you run an accounting report, the contact name shows up in all the standard contact or the standard accounting reports. Right.

Speaker 2  58:57
So it would be it would be a reference number for that trend. Well, okay. Like it would be the check number payment ID number to be what what the payment ID number and the vendor.

Unknown Speaker  59:17
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  59:26
And this would be for credit card accounts as well.

Unknown Speaker  59:30
Correct.

Matthias Miller  59:37
What's the I think this will make it this makes it less painful to run reports in the accounting system and eliminates at least one of the custom columns that we added to the Reconciliation Report. Did you could see the vendor invoice vendor because that would then just be pulled off of the transaction contact but what's your or priority on

Unknown Speaker  1:00:02
on this?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
Oh, January would be really nice.

Matthias Miller  1:00:12
Before reconciliation?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
Not me. No.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
We use I mean,

Speaker 2  1:00:23
I would use it for Yeah. December reconcile. I'm actually quite heavily. And I It would also then be really nice to have it for that unwrapping Uncategorized accounts report that that I'm sending to these managers as well.

Matthias Miller  1:00:46
So instead of this week thing or next week thing,

Speaker 2  1:00:50
yeah. That's where you can never doesn't happen this week next week.

Speaker 1  1:00:57
But we don't have it this week yet. I don't think any projects

Matthias Miller  1:01:03
will the only thing we have going on this week is figuring out what our priorities are and what we're actually doing. So

Speaker 2  1:01:11
you said you can take your column off of the reconcile Which one were you taking off?

Matthias Miller  1:01:16
The vendor, the vendor name? Because we currently have a contact name on the reference a blank Contact Name column, right? In the in the reconcile? And so and then we have a vendor name.

Speaker 2  1:01:28
Oh, and this will populate the contact name. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense.

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
All right. Report on categories, expenses, we went through ending bank and credit card balance or pending items. This one requires design, but in in nonetheless, what's the priority for this pending, it's pending items that need to be paid, you're getting ready to pay credit card checks, and you want to see what this is going to do to your bank account.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:03
Um, as far as I know, there's budget money in the account. So

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
super crucial. Main.

Speaker 1  1:02:15
But unlike credit cards, if you're paying a bunch of well, wow,

Speaker 2  1:02:21
that won't be paying them anymore. Because they're just gonna go in and it's paid.

Speaker 1  1:02:27
Yeah, you're just going to have very few at this point is actually going to end that's not extremely urgent. I mean, February. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:02:37
Or even March, end up with too many February things. Mean, balance sheet in February is much more important than

Speaker 1  1:02:46
that. Yeah, let's do March because we I mean, this is more for a cash management than anything else. And that's you're not

Speaker 2  1:02:57
doing a lot of rolling, we haven't concluded that the managers are determining, yeah, cash for position anyone? Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
It's always fun to be spinning, spinning money and other people are managing the cash. The Ohio Okay, this one we already prioritized

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
payments for multiple s. See this one?

Matthias Miller  1:03:30
handle payments for multiple sales orders? You know, is there a context on this?

Speaker 3  1:03:36
That might be okay, so, here, this was the comments in the incident?

Matthias Miller  1:03:48
Yes, that is correct. This is a bit of validation so that you can check technically split the multi multi payment and multi sales order payment into two deposits, which is just wrong. But ours, how urgent is it to fix it?

Speaker 2  1:04:13
Well, I don't know how many times you get two payments that are one payment. I don't know

Speaker 1  1:04:26
if it is this related to where Didn't you also run into issues where you had a multi sales or you had a pretty Oh Jake applied the payments to buy buildings, but then had to individually select all the payments for the deposit instead of just

Speaker 2  1:04:39
Yeah, and that was because the buildings were in different districts. So it didn't it didn't tie the the having that was what we talked about before. Yeah, so if they're all that works just fine. Yeah, yes, yes. Well, this would be like cutting the check in half.

Matthias Miller  1:04:55
didn't, didn't we? But did we have a change? To want to deposit to group by multi sales order payments,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10
when you're linking them

Speaker 4  1:05:17
to grow, we didn't, I think,

Speaker 1  1:05:22
on those where they were in different districts, you ended up selecting the individual payments rather than the one.

Matthias Miller  1:05:31
Currently, yes, the individual payments do get linked out to deposit. So yes, it's, it's really weird.

Speaker 1  1:05:42
Oh, this fix you're making would not allow that anymore. It's saying like, well, you can only deposit this $50,000 Check one. So go go find that, regardless of where the payments

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
Wow, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:59
I think if you do multi sales or payment, it's a little obnoxious. But what I would do is if you have,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
if you've got

Matthias Miller  1:06:09
10 buildings, that you're paying for a deposit, you still have to select 10. But we make sure that if any of your payments that you're depositing if any of them are a multi sales order payment, that you you'd have to deposit the whole thing at the same time, you can't, you can't do all or none.

Speaker 1  1:06:27
But so you're not planning to you're not intending to make sure that you can only select that one payment for 10 buildings almost like different ones?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:38
Well, we

Matthias Miller  1:06:39
could, that would be that would also be a reasonable solution, it would require that when you're making the deposit, and you have a multi sales order payment.

Matthias Miller  1:06:57
I don't know if if we can do that with a split pane it has to be that's going to have to be in a different, we're either gonna have to do a split pane in the deposit screen that has the one has the multi sales or payments and one has the single sales over payments, or probably split playing split pane if we can, if we can do that effectively.

Speaker 1  1:07:19
All because typically, you're showing all the payments. Like those 10 is all individual payments. And then you'd either you'd either have to hide those, those payments and have another screen that shows the multi sales order payments, right?

Speaker 2  1:07:42
Well, can't you just make so that if the buildings are involved in a multi sales order payment, that the buildings as individuals don't show up to be selected? They only show up as that one payment? Like in your payments to select for your deposit?

Speaker 1  1:08:12
Or would it? Because would it be easier if you select one of those 10? The first one you select they all come? That's that's kind of wrong, right?

Speaker 2  1:08:23
Well, theoretically, if you're doing a deposit, if all you know is the deposit, then you won't know, you know that there's supposed to be a $50,000 payment, and that's going to be what you're supposed to be hunting for. But I mean, the way we handle our deposit payment states, you can see on the sheet what it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:43
So, but

Speaker 1  1:08:46
I mean, I would agree it would be make the most sense logically to just go find that $50,000 payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:56
Blondes, but

Matthias Miller  1:08:59
Okay, so there would be a way to handle it, it requires restriction, how these things get linked together?

Matthias Miller  1:09:10
What's the priority? Okay, sorry, there's an inexpensive solution, which is just throw up your hands and somebody tries to do it and say you're you're not allowed. It's a relatively inexpensive solution, stop gap. Then there's the Let's go make depositing multicylinder payments easier. Which is separate. So I'd like to focus on the stop gap for now. What's the priority of a stop gap?

Speaker 1  1:09:37
When you say you don't allow does that mean? Like? So good question. Yeah. Explain what you mean by a stop gap. Does that mean that Hey, mister data entry or person trying to do this, you actually have to go to the multi sales order payment screen to plant this payment. But on the deposit sheet because it's a multi

Matthias Miller  1:10:05
know, it's, it's linking them as individual payments to the deposit. And just making sure that all of the all of those payments get linked to the deposit.

Speaker 2  1:10:23
So it would be kind of like a warning saying you only have one of the building selected that's in this payment.

Matthias Miller  1:10:31
I think you'd go further than a warning, it's an error. It's saying you cannot create this deposit because you only have one building selected. But

Speaker 2  1:10:39
that's what it would be. If you would go through and select all the buildings, then it would it would allow you through.

Matthias Miller  1:10:45
Yes. And then probably take it one step further and Group. Group multi sales order payments together in the report. So you can easily find them find them all and you don't have to go hunting for them. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:11:00
Okay, then you could just find those the first one and then still highlight all nine or 10 of them or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
Right.

Speaker 4  1:11:07
Yep. Your your Well, well, that's

Speaker 2  1:11:13
Dwayne's people are dealing with that. I mean, they're, they are working with what they have now. Now, if there weren't all done right, but

Speaker 2  1:11:33
I don't know that it's super high priority.

Speaker 1  1:11:39
But it's going to make your record. I mean, we're going to be putting in a bunch of old payments to get our AR correct. And a bunch of multi sales or payments from. That's right. I mean, if it's, I would probably this from that perspective, if it's, if it's an easy, inexpensive fix, to make so that they can continue beyond that, then I would vote to do it. this week or next. But yeah, yeah. What's involved in that face?

Matthias Miller  1:12:14
Well, I mean, if it's just, again, if it's just making sure people don't do something they're not supposed to. I think that's a pretty Yeah, I'm fine doing it next week.

Speaker 4  1:12:27
We should just communicate that going. phones off.

Matthias Miller  1:12:42
Alright. Go Live plan. Yes, we were talking about this right before vacation. About what are we going to do with all the old transactions? And I think there were there's a whole bunch of stuff here. Yeah, I think this I think we should block out time on a I think we needed a blackout time sometime to talk this through.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
Agree. And I think that you're good. Well,

Speaker 1  1:13:25
I think the first step is, do you ask for this right before Christmas as well like a list of steps to be done, like what needs to be done to so that we know what basically what steps need to be done so that we we can close the books for 23, what needs to be done to AR to finish goods inventory to all of those, so that we have the correct information there. And most of that is going to come from assist, and then we just translate in to make a journal entry in QuickBooks. So I think that's, it seems to me like that step one. And then step two is is what you have here, block off time to talk through. How do we make that switch once? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:16
it's, it's not as cut and dried as I think. I think what I would like to do is, is

Speaker 1  1:14:27
start with what we did last year, put that on paper, like what we did to close their books, as messy as it was for 22 and start with that plan for 23 and then build off of that, because there's we want to get way more detailed

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
in some areas, I know. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:14:46
so we're gonna have to get that. We're gonna have to keep that moving. I mean, this seems like the kind of thing that could easily suck up a lot of time.

Speaker 1  1:14:58
Believe me, and you're never quite sad. Let us buy tickets as we had said I know that we talked about this to the on our board call set that what was it February 15. We hope to have 23 numbers completed and then by end of February have that the dates we had end of February have assist January one balance sheet numbers accurate and I think that's I think we were being gracious with ourselves giving us that much time but

Unknown Speaker  1:15:40
okay

Speaker 1  1:15:44
so I I didn't really answer your question you're wanting to schedule a time for this I think basically yeah, basically

Matthias Miller  1:15:52
when when are you going to have your things written down? sufficiently we can start talking through this process

Speaker 1  1:16:04
well, there's there's a lot of stuff that I don't know what if we say next Friday on our call next, do we have a Friday we have a Friday call it probably should plan for maybe something like two hours or should we know let's Okay, today we're we're at the third what did we say the chance and then because I think we're going to have some work the 10th and then do follow up to 12 If we go over a week yeah, I'd say let's let's do

Unknown Speaker  1:16:41
let's plan for that. All right

Matthias Miller  1:16:53
okay, speed up reconcile. I made one more change this morning. And my vote is to mark this done and let Dwayne complain if salespeople keep running into his I send a message this morning checking in with him on it and haven't heard haven't heard back

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
from closed Excellent.

Matthias Miller  1:17:22
Warn on missing information. I think this is in testing in Drew's court if there's any testing additional testing required

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
that makes sense. Drew Yeah, did

Unknown Speaker  1:17:38
you just send an email about that today?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
Somebody did is that the one that I may have sent that

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
oh boy I think it's possible

Speaker 3  1:17:51
I don't I don't think it's this one because I think I had those emails attached to the task and there aren't emails attached to this warn on missing information. Oh payment type address banking information.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:11
Yeah, it says assembler was the system that code house okay. A few more fixes.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:18
Okay, is it the same thing but then I did

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
the same thing.

Matthias Miller  1:18:22
This is a this might be a duplicate then we

Unknown Speaker  1:18:25
merge that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:28
okay, what was on warning all right.

Speaker 2  1:18:37
No, these are two different things. Are they this was the this is the duplication warning that that's an email and what that job was there that you were just had open is missing information on like the vendor it like or the invoice if you try to close it without payment ID I mean, not a payment tie or an address if it's a certain payment type and so on. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:07
Good point. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:19:13
Is it still in testing though drew or now does it belong back with you, Matthias?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:21
The last I tested it was not

Speaker 2  1:19:31
Yeah, this one I think is working. The missing information on vendor invoices.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:37
Okay, we need to double check.

Speaker 3  1:19:42
Do you want to double check it? I can mark it is in process here. And we can just

Speaker 2  1:19:46
yeah, just mark it as in process and I'll double check that. All

Unknown Speaker  1:19:50
right. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:53
All right. Let me go back up here. Take a minute open this again. Alright. I think I think we're here

Unknown Speaker  1:20:13
recognize your premiums.

Matthias Miller  1:20:15
So this was this is handled well, hang

Speaker 4  1:20:23
on. Okay, but we have we have

Speaker 1  1:20:28
with our right off like, this would not be a negative amount but a positive amount we have ways of handling this. What is this? I know, we talked about this, and I thought we concluded that we'll just let Dwayne's office handle that. And just if we real technical, they would be AR until they're paid, but we're just going to not know about them until we get the payments and then record them in the correct place so that they show up as our to premium income.

Speaker 3  1:21:13
Okay, so is this basically done, then? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:18
Matthias Miller, do you have something else on?

Matthias Miller  1:21:22
This? I don't think so. I mean, it right offs work for you. I think there's a question of do we I don't know if this is a question. Do we want to automate it more? Or do

Speaker 1  1:21:31
we? I don't know. But I'd be happy to just say this is completed for now. It might be a 2025 thing to improve? I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:40
I'm not sure.

Speaker 3  1:21:45
All right, quick fix store record sales statement. Dates.

Speaker 4  1:21:49
That is done. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:21:56
Excellent. Okay, I think we're getting into what we have already looked at.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:01
It looks like

Speaker 3  1:22:04
but we're gonna have some more. Let's see, allow companies to make signature adjustments. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:13
That's done. And believe me? No way.

Matthias Miller  1:22:17
No, it's not done. It's there's a question. Priority question.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:21
Okay. Um,

Speaker 2  1:22:26
what's reasonable? I mean, we'll use it tomorrow. Maybe make the adjustments tomorrow, but we'll be printing checks tomorrow. So

Speaker 1  1:22:36
but Right. away, we

Unknown Speaker  1:22:39
are works. Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:22:40
Does it take us to our income statement goal, or is it a big enough issue, but it should be considered outside of that?

Speaker 1  1:22:51
Probably what February? I mean, what does it does it is it concerning that it's

Speaker 2  1:22:57
just we haven't we haven't had anything come back any issues on objects we've rented so far? So your odds are let's go to February.

Matthias Miller  1:23:07
That would be unfortunate. If you told us of the bank Mr. rejecting them.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:14
ASAP situation.

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
Maybe it doesn't sleep till today?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:24
We haven't looked at this one yet. Have we?

Matthias Miller  1:23:26
No, I think this is this one. I need to coordinate with Dwayne and find out.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:30
What?

Matthias Miller  1:23:33
Yeah, maybe you guys have input on it, they move. My understanding is they move some payments from sales order between sales orders fairly frequently. And there's a lot of stuff getting tied to the payment. And I think we probably need an automated way to say take this payment off of this sales order and go put it on this other one.

Speaker 1  1:23:53
What are the situations where this is happening? I mean, I know they're doing this on online payments, or like credit card payments for

Unknown Speaker  1:24:03
where the customer

Speaker 1  1:24:06
pays, like on the shared app, they're moving that across to but is this different than that?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
I don't think so.

Matthias Miller  1:24:21
Sorry. Yeah, I mean, I think that's the use case. I guess if it's all stripe transactions, then they might still need a way to copy strike by these across I'm not sure. But

Unknown Speaker  1:24:36
Josh didn't work to make so that they can that they can go into the stripe portal, copy the

Unknown Speaker  1:24:44
the stripe ID for that transaction and paste it to the assist sales order. Is it something more that

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
you want to put in Probably not.

Speaker 1  1:25:10
Well, I would almost want for Drew and I to be involved in that discussion, because it could, because of how it could affect reconciles. And some other some other areas, but

Unknown Speaker  1:25:33
what was the best path forward?

Speaker 1  1:25:34
I know I was copied on one of these emails, but I didn't look at it. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:25:42
it seems like nobody is completely certain whether this is an issue or not. Or a problem? Well, and so good.

Speaker 1  1:25:51
Do you want to reach out I mean, I had thought that this is all working just with the work Josh did. It was so that we could, because the case was customers, or dealers went online to the shed out, they also use stripe, they made a payment. And then because stripe shouldn't happen says don't talk to each other as far as sales orders and buildings, they need to be read, the data needs to be re entered into sales. And then you can't just you can't very well just say while there was a stripe payment of $500 made on the shed out, we wanted to take it one step further and go into the Stripe account, copy that stripe ID paste it to the sales order in the system. So that it records the right or or the Yeah, the the stripe fees and all of that correctly. And I thought that was all working correctly. So I'm wondering, should one of you reach out to Dwayne and ask him if they're, if this is still an issue? And if it is, then we just set up a time for

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07
ya to talk. Sounds good?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:18
Okay, so did I miss it? Are we doing this in January?

Matthias Miller  1:27:22
I mean, I'm chasing it now. I mean, this is more a business even an issue. Okay, this is more like do we need process for moving payments from one to another? And I think there's nothing that keeps us from checking into that now and finding out. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:47
Let me do this.

Speaker 3  1:27:51
We'll get more specificity there. Okay. Boy, let's see. Documentation for Asset Management. Is this a? Is this an old one? That just happened to have this due date? Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:14
Yeah, we can push it out.

Matthias Miller  1:28:20
Okay. Oh, that's good.

Speaker 3  1:28:25
Okay, so we're into February. Now it looks like we're doing good. Let me look at what do we have for Mark and drew to make sure we're not missing any tasks here? That should be much smaller of a list. Okay, Drew. Deposit module update improved speed for deposit module. Is this done? Yeah. process. And then we've gone through these easy way to catch duplicate transactions. Is this in process?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:05
That's the one that I was just sent the email

Speaker 3  1:29:07
for. Okay. That's right. That makes sense. So last

Speaker 2  1:29:11
I checked, which was just before Christmas, there is still had some glitches, but that's what those fixes are supposed to be taken care of. So

Speaker 3  1:29:20
I guess, is this something that you want to put into January priorities or not? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:29:25
I would say so. You probably want to test it as soon as the tests live. Right. Was that? No, that was today. When is the next update with us?

Matthias Miller  1:29:37
Wherever you want me there's one last night, probably one Saturday unless there's that's probably fine.

Speaker 1  1:29:45
Okay, so we have the same thing here. Warning an easy way. Right? Those Those two are the same, right? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:53
Are they? Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  1:29:56
I mean, technically, I mean, test warning would be this Perhaps a subtask of easy way to catch duplicates would be one way to

Unknown Speaker  1:30:05
call back. All right. That's fair. Yeah. So we won't worry about it. That does that look right for you drew? Yeah, I think so. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:30:18
Sounds good. And then you see there we are. Okay, this is probably cleaning up some old stuff implement process for entering and assist all sales orders initially created outside of assist. I suspect that's done.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:42
Yeah. That is done. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:30:46
cash payment ID temporarily for reconcile. Yes. Dun, dun, AR diagnostic Reconciliation Report.

Speaker 1  1:31:02
Is that okay, that's part of that. Blocking out next Wednesday, figuring out which transactions to keep right? No, what is this AR?

Matthias Miller  1:31:14
This is this is Mark's fancy report.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:17
Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:31:21
This is the let's go take a look at let's go take a take a look at accounts receivable and find out all final transaction in and find out which sales orders have impacted it and how, or let's go look at undeposited funds, and let's figure out where those undeposited funds are coming from. Because we shouldn't have that it's the it's the balance sheet doesn't match. Balance Sheet error doesn't match the error report. What's wrong? Report.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:05
So where are we at with?

Speaker 1  1:32:09
Yeah, Matthias, where are we at with this? I mean, you created a report. You're waiting for feedback from me on this, I believe. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:32:17
yeah, I mean, I think I can, I mean, I can show it to you guys if we've got if we got time today. But I think one of the questions is, this was pretty high on your priority list. So yeah. I can show it to you whenever. Okay,

Speaker 3  1:32:36
so we're gonna keep it as a January priority guess Yeah. Sounds good. Create an implement a depositing process for builders

Speaker 1  1:32:51
did not mean it's, I believe that's done.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:54
Okay.

Speaker 3  1:32:59
Show Work Order owner amounts. This was an email.

Speaker 1  1:33:06
I believe the class I think I remember you saying this was done, but maybe

Matthias Miller  1:33:12
this is per test. I'll be protesting. Are you?

Unknown Speaker  1:33:15
Okay? Yeah. Leave it. Yeah. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:17
Is this going to be a January priority for you?

Speaker 1  1:33:24
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, yeah, just takes but a few minutes. So yeah, that's good.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:29
All right. Put it in here. Okay, conditional

Unknown Speaker  1:33:33
formatting on paid vacation.

Matthias Miller  1:33:40
Waiting on Mark review.

Speaker 4  1:33:41
Okay. Same same date. Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  1:33:47
to January. Build a payroll do reports. What you wanted to send a Whitney is the comment I had.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:58
Oh, move that to Margaret. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:06
Push payroll transactions into assist accounting.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:11
I haven't. Yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:16
That's done as of yesterday, or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:19
We wish it were. Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:21
It's do as of yesterday. I gotcha. So

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
I mean, realistically. I don't know the 12. Probably.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:30
You think it's okay. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:35
But high priority for you. Let me mark it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:38
We're going back from

Speaker 4  1:34:39
what I've run into. So, yeah, the last we have to the better.

Speaker 3  1:34:44
Sounds good. Do we have Asset Management and depreciation schedules? This one's kind of an old one. I know it's been in here for a while. Does it actually make

Unknown Speaker  1:34:56
progress? Do you have

Unknown Speaker  1:34:57
more notes on this?

Speaker 3  1:34:59
I don't I know it came from Z ch originally because it has Drew's initials in front of it. So it was probably it's a general task and that's really all I have on it. It says it's an adaption Is it done okay?

Speaker 2  1:35:16
And the way I understand that, to me it's just talking about links when the assets stopped working. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:35:24
That's probably fair. And so I don't know why I had it with Mark because it's got Drew's initials, but we're closing it. So that makes me happy. Okay. I think that looks good to great. Is there anything else we need to go over to prioritize here

Speaker 1  1:35:48
do you want to add you want the ability to write checks

Unknown Speaker  1:35:54
without having a vendor's envoy sidecar? Yeah, you

Matthias Miller  1:35:58
do? You have that? Yeah. Now watch me demo something being like not even paying but what me I'm gonna take a surrender. Okay. I'll do something like this so we're gonna move away to

Unknown Speaker  1:36:40
checks to print.

Matthias Miller  1:36:44
We need like a new check button would be useful here.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:52
Yeah, that's I went I went hunting for one

Matthias Miller  1:37:00
so I mean, all you need to do is fill this out with miscellaneous items. He just got it. Back you but no, yes. It works. Well. Bank? Oh, you got to fill in the date primary checking. And then once you fill in the date, you'll have these accounts that are

Speaker 2  1:37:24
would there be a way to? To make so that maybe we put a like to put it in the already printed status? There was let's say somebody writes a hand check out. You know, so I'm just, I'm just putting it into the system with check that out.

Matthias Miller  1:37:46
I'm just filling the number. I usually do. I'm sorry, the friends just fill in the check number. But

Speaker 2  1:37:53
yeah, okay. Yeah, that would work. And then I mean, it could be printed. Yeah, that point but they shouldn't choose it because really hasn't.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:07
Right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:09
Makes sense. Well, that was easy. Well, once it goes live

Matthias Miller  1:38:18
I mean, this is good to go. This has been this has been around for a while. Here before Christmas. So it's old. And I have our time. It's like teenager already.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:37
A Look at this.

Matthias Miller  1:38:42
Oh, great. Um, do we want to take a quick look at the you guys have a few minutes to take a look at the reconcile report or do you would you want to call it a wrap?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:50
Good here. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:57
Do you need me for this discussion?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:00
No, we don't. Okay,

Speaker 3  1:39:01
I'm gonna wrap up the notes I took on priorities and I'm gonna send you guys a list of what we discussed. And then hopefully, that'll be helpful. So I'm gonna drop off. Okay. Thank you

Matthias Miller  1:39:18
Sorry, that's the wrong report. Let's do counts receivable

Matthias Miller  1:39:31
expand this a little bit. All right. So here's sales order 31. Well, okay, first of all, if you scroll down I should show the difference column, shouldn't I because that's all No, maybe? No. Okay, but the ones with a difference are at the top the ones without a difference or the sorry, the ones with the differences at the top. The ones who got a difference are at the bottom. Here's a sales order. We got 10 or 15 undeposited funds? Because it's not deposited. No, sorry, undeposited funds would be

Unknown Speaker  1:40:18
why would this

Unknown Speaker  1:40:21
chose it is deposited? Why is this not?

Matthias Miller  1:40:40
Once deposited the undeposited funds is a it's an asset or a liability. That's an asset asset. asset. So a debit would increase it. And this is a liability. And so this also increases accounts receivable

Unknown Speaker  1:41:02
No, ar, is AR and

Matthias Miller  1:41:05
acid, or is it an asset? Right? That's an asset as well. So looks like That's right.

Speaker 1  1:41:13
Oh, yeah, because I got a payment. We got a payment. So it Laura, you got a payment?

Matthias Miller  1:41:19
Right? No, no, we moved this from undeposited. No, we move

Speaker 1  1:41:22
it from AR to undeposited funds, and then have a move from undeposited funds. bank account? Yeah, I was confused.

Matthias Miller  1:41:29
So simple. Why is the deposit not? Right? Let me showing up because we don't have the original move into undeposited funds. No, we don't have the original accounts receivable This is old enough that we don't have the original accounts receivable transaction, which is why this shows up. Let's go to this guy that looks somewhat similar. I don't know if that's true or not. We go into this one, we're saying that AR was debited 19k and

Matthias Miller  1:42:21
there are no payments yet.

Matthias Miller  1:42:31
And then we get into older stuff where so this has been where things start matching up total debits and credits for this sales order are added up and this would be considered. So here we have a 10k debit of AR and a 10k credit for AR and if we go look at a recent building, here's one of the 20th where many for nine

Unknown Speaker  1:42:57
and

Matthias Miller  1:43:01
Sir, and then two payments named for a nine tie which ties that this one out completely. So I'm not sure how to handle some of these old things that but either way, these are impacting the starting balance. And so I think this is appropriate

Speaker 2  1:43:27
because this was Okay, so now another question, how is this going to be affected when we clean out 23 transactions because undeposited funds is that happening? Where's that transaction that

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
so undeposited funds the the increase in undeposited funds debit for undeposited funds happens because of a sales order payment and then the credit happens as a result of a deposit.

Speaker 2  1:44:05
So the deposit would be disappearing but this move from accounts receivable to undeposited funds would not be this very

Matthias Miller  1:44:16
well not unless we change the start date for when we start pushing things to accounting but I don't know if we will do that. As it stands now I think we said we weren't we're gonna keep pushing historical buildings and just zero things out to the right amount. So yes, that is correct

Speaker 2  1:44:43
so what do we need to do to make so that so that these all balance out like even this old stuff

Unknown Speaker  1:44:54
um,

Matthias Miller  1:45:06
Isn't this a mean this quickly turns into the lengthy discussion of what's the process for closing out the books and by grading i Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:45:22
so So these so most of these old ones are just simply part of that discussion. It's not like there's something wrong that needs to be fixed. It's just are incomplete year worth of data?

Matthias Miller  1:45:40
Yeah, I think so. I mean, we did take a look at this one. I mean, like this one here, this one looks like a legitimate

Unknown Speaker  1:45:52
you know, here

Matthias Miller  1:45:55
they have a balance due there is a payment on the date of invoicing. No, hang on, customer deposit that the customer made $1,000 deposit. And then AR is 4653 versus a total of 5653. But the customer has an outstanding balance of 4653. So this, this is an example of something that yes, it hasn't zeroed out in the AR impact but it shouldn't have because it still is AR

Speaker 1  1:46:40
but it's the ones where we only have like the one that we looked at earlier where we have only the one side of the transaction we have going out of AR but not into AR like those will need to determine which which of those to get just get rid of

Matthias Miller  1:47:02
I'm not sure how exactly how we want to do this, I mean long term once we get those cleaned out however we do that then long term which you should be able to do is generate this report and and then just take it line by line and cross them out on grab a printout of your other AR report and go through line by line cross them out and figure out what the what the discrepancies are

Unknown Speaker  1:47:33
but first step would be well I think for this we'll probably start with our

Speaker 1  1:47:41
accounts receivable report in the dashboard or on the IMS side go through verify that that information is accurate and then work with you to buy it I think that's part of the lengthy discussion then on how do we I mean it almost feels to me like similar to what you were asking for drew on reconciled like a way to mark like keep all these transactions before you the great apocalypse

Speaker 4  1:48:10
or whatever you know

Unknown Speaker  1:48:20
yeah, that looks like a very handy tool anywhere anytime.

Matthias Miller  1:48:23
You guys have a preference for the name or suggestions for the name if I make this take this life and

Speaker 1  1:48:29
I don't know so are you okay? Are you going to do this for like for what can you do this for pretty much any any chart of accounts or any any account Okay, so you can do this for AP or receive now voucher or whatever

Unknown Speaker  1:48:55
for all of them but yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:48:56
here's here's undeposited funds for example. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:00
okay

Matthias Miller  1:49:06
oh, this is going the other way.

Speaker 1  1:49:12
I'm curious if you go down towards the like the latest deposits we I would expect we wouldn't have a lot of undeposited funds carrying over but they will

Matthias Miller  1:49:32
not not listening not translating correctly. It might be that something's not so here's a undeposited funds is increased here. It was deposited on 1130. Ah find out the deposit number says deposit number 10

Unknown Speaker  1:50:00
Was it deposit number 10?

Matthias Miller  1:50:06
Why would that not have?

Unknown Speaker  1:50:12
I don't know. Let me

Matthias Miller  1:50:15
do this. Let me make a note to myself.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:21
Yeah

Speaker 4  1:50:29
yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hey,

Speaker 1  1:50:40
as far as main I think your first one to me makes most sense accounts. Diagnostic but don't know. But

Unknown Speaker  1:50:50
Henry just said because of the price sounds good. I will that will be shipped to

Matthias Miller  1:51:07
good. Well, looks like a little stuff to do on the numbers there. I'll probably middle table it. Yeah, based on some of the other priorities and come back to it. But that is at least the concept of what we're after. And yeah, not as exciting as perfect numbers but at least shows practice

Unknown Speaker  1:51:26
the steps to get there. That's the good thing. Good, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:32
Anything else that we

Unknown Speaker  1:51:36
have? You have to know?

Matthias Miller  1:51:42
Are you guys still wanting to keep Sorry, I'm gonna have to reschedule next Wednesday's meeting as well. I've got a schedule conflict. I'm happy to do an early morning meeting if you want. Where we can take the 1030 meeting longer the 10 o'clock meeting longer

Unknown Speaker  1:52:05
