Matthias Miller  01:35
Hey, do you want to Know? Oh, there you go. I don't know how I feel about this. After a very slow q1

Unknown Speaker  01:53
Mark. saying no to a or face by some somebody on. of things. So fascinating post in a Facebook group or. faced by somebody on Facebook, where the reason wealthy people are inaccessible is they do it by necessity, but effectively, effectively, people will use as much of You up until your boundary, as possible. Simple thing. No surprise anyway, hence crazy meeting schedules and figuring out what I'm saying no to and what I'm saying yes to, which I'm sometimes Yeah. Horrible job. So there you have it. And also, agriculture has pushed in harvest seasons and the we've increasingly insulated ourselves from that. So whatever you make of that, as well, has harvested and the the Gregorian lifestyle has has harvest and planting, like push and rest seasons, which are generally not part of it's true our yeah demo, although I'm pretty sure Right now, our office is in a planting season. That's fair, but I do agree, and I'm planting plus harvesting, so I'm making hay while the sun shines and planting seeds. Okay, so what part do you think we're if you go down to my comments there, I don't think we did any of that. Did we? Yeah, that stuff. As long as we don't push it, we don't we don't care about bad debt prior to invoicing, as long as we don't push it to accounting prior to invoicing, because we're talking about adding accounting date on the payment method, which was like, payment date on, invoice date on or after invoice date, and then pushing dependent on that, right? You think we did? I don't think I did that. No, you didn't. And plus the discrepancy Reconciliation Report, yeah, you are exactly correct. And I think this is why we need to clean up our incidents better. I should have cleaned it up. That's fine. I would just, don't just shoot mark an email and tell them this is not done after all, and confirm that this should that this should come before sales tax liability reconcile, become before the other ones right customer refunds and deposited funds. Again, I looked at the we notice the sales liability reconcile. Work isn't truly done.

Speaker 1  05:21
We need to make changes, yeah, or is yet to allow pushing bad that the changes the payment method to configure when it pushes to accounting and changes yet one configure payment to figure when payment methods field and figure what date payment methods push to accounting and discrepancy, right? It's fancy reconciliation report of net impact on accounts. Did these come? Should these changes take priority over? Was it customer deposits and

Matthias Miller  06:47
customer deposits and retrieval deposited, deposited funds and retrievals. I

Speaker 1  07:19
oops. I think I have a typo in there. Said we notice what w instead of a D, that's funny. Well, all

Matthias Miller  07:39
right, good.

Matthias Miller  07:48
Okay, so hang on. So we got the side note, I find it way easier to enter my time in 15 minute increments than I do certain stuff times,

Unknown Speaker  08:08
if only you had a just a button to update your time card. Well, I start on something.

Matthias Miller  08:22
I guess I could, but it's more like my meetings all start on 15 minute intervals, yeah, and it's exactly No It makes total sense. Okay, so, Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan, wow, this thing is busy.

Unknown Speaker  08:34
He's just searching. He's not a thing, okay,

Matthias Miller  08:39
to do. Do Seth, all right, by the way, we've been doing, done, yeah, done, DB, I like now, okay, we'll get to that, the rest of that. Okay, so contract, script, record. Here's what we're thinking. We're thinking that we're actually going to create a note template, and so it'll have a it'll have a name, and actually, I didn't even think about this. It should have a an accounting company, accounting or rental. Sorry, rental company. Thank you.

Speaker 1  09:24
Which those you said are switching to contacts, right? I want to talk that through, but I think so. I think I think that's fair. I just wish we would have done that first step, or switches are costing us, but it's part of starting on development when design is still running

Matthias Miller  09:39
well, and we just need to stop Well, I mean, I don't know that there's anything we're working on right now that's, I hope not, that's not fully designed, but

Speaker 1  09:54
I'm not sure there is right now. But there was things like the big one was building on a contract definition, then changing it a. Lot. Yeah, that one was inexpensive, but fairly substantial. It's just part of it, yeah,

Matthias Miller  10:08
contact, contract, product, payment, user, these are the ones. And I would just say

Matthias Miller  10:21
this does not need to be supported everywhere or on all levels only the above contents and then note under the hood, we need a different field for each database level.

Speaker 1  10:40
Oh, so we then Nick built it out for too many then,

Matthias Miller  10:45
well, I mean, it's Oh, if he actually has it for I would just keep it

Speaker 1  10:49
okay. It's not, it's not that much work to add on each one he has it on, like contract definition, contract term, contract script, rental company, all those, which rental company will go the contract script or the note, this is, this is a note template.

Matthias Miller  11:07
I

Speaker 1  11:08
know he has it on the contract script record right now. Which we okay, but I mean, that'll go because contract script record is going to disappear. I mean, isn't it, the contract

Matthias Miller  11:22
script is turning into a note template. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  11:36
I think this is now a I don't we want to look up type? Gonna want to select it from a drop list.

Speaker 1  11:51
So note, template is different than note.

Matthias Miller  11:56
It's a direct I see it's done. It is like the snippets here, effectively, yeah, gotcha. So I think this is a look at record type.

Unknown Speaker  12:09
We might just say custom,

Matthias Miller  12:14
or do you want to because

Speaker 1  12:18
this, i i Yeah, I think the custom is more for the client's sake, that this is not a standard. We've been using this, the snippets to generate these things and so saying, so it's not saying custom DB level. It's saying, I think, yeah, settings,

Matthias Miller  12:44
settings, configuration, no templates

Unknown Speaker  12:48
or configure templates? Yeah, we've been saying Configure. I don't know if we need to, but

Matthias Miller  12:53
do we need to? We should probably concatenate. I

Matthias Miller  13:05
Okay, remind me that on the contact on the contact record, we have a how do we want to

Matthias Miller  13:20
handle unique names

Unknown Speaker  13:23
on

Matthias Miller  13:25
for these? Yeah, can we, can we have the name be auto generated? Or

Speaker 1  13:36
is it level plus description, or is that going to get long? Oh, no, we filter by level already. I would assume you

Matthias Miller  13:48
filter by level. So I think it's something like title number record, num of rental company. I

Unknown Speaker  14:11
Okay.

Matthias Miller  14:20
So then we have, do you want to call this title? Do you have a better name?

Unknown Speaker  14:25
Title, reasonable

Matthias Miller  14:27
rental company? We have type, which is a list of database level, give the content

Speaker 1  14:33
we should have a me, this is more note to myself. Do you want just add a to do, Seth, change the type list to be, does it sound right? To change it to be a list, its own list, but then catalog validation to make sure it matches database levels list. Or do we always do filters? It'll be easier to track. Down if you want to add a new level. If we have our own list, you just have to add it everywhere. But I could be wrong.

Matthias Miller  15:09
Would you then? Would you have separate lists for the templates in the notes? You use the same list, use the same list. Should we support templates for all record types? Just for suppose that way.

Matthias Miller  15:28
I mean, it's not necessary to have templates for all the others. No, I was more

Speaker 1  15:31
thinking of it for the note record than the note template. Oh, let me just throw it up and put on the on Nick's job for that change, you can ignore it, okay?

Matthias Miller  15:47
You could have a corollary list of supported list. You could have the record type still be the database levels. Have lists of allowed template levels and allowed note levels, and then just make sure the names match end to end, and then use pipe list, whatever he has fairly clean, relatively clean way to do it, in my opinion. But maybe that's crazy, so let's design Okay. So then on the okay, I'm

Matthias Miller  16:45
okay, so then this is,

Matthias Miller  16:53
I mean, you could probably mostly get away with deleting and recreating it, but so let's go down to the note record, and we'll get back to that. Okay, so I think this is this can go poor Dwayne. I mean, either I just am a marathoner. I mean, it's both, I do it all at the time, and I'm probably a little bit of a marathoner,

Unknown Speaker  17:26
and he just,

Matthias Miller  17:29
we are wearing him out, just,

Speaker 1  17:35
it's too much design. Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, so

Matthias Miller  17:42
I agree with rental company. I just think,

Unknown Speaker  17:51
you think we should still just call it RTO.

Matthias Miller  17:54
No, I mean, I'm fine changing, changing it

Unknown Speaker  17:58
ready. So, okay, great, good. So that's 20 minutes

Matthias Miller  18:03
done. So, well, it's okay that, oh, I

Unknown Speaker  18:05
didn't move the comment down. I see,

Matthias Miller  18:09
oh, I guess. And this is says RTO company. It's a rental company.

Speaker 1  18:13
Yeah, I think you want something to change, except that. Okay, great. Well, put it in the archive then, because there was a to do, and I think it was mainly completed, but that one was missed. I wasn't quite sure what you meant there.

Matthias Miller  18:31
Do you have to add field change expressions meticulously for everything? We don't have some kind of behavior that you can check on the box that says it have to be all of them.

Speaker 1  18:39
I think you don't care. I just Just make sure logic is bulletproof.

Matthias Miller  18:45
Just don't be stupid. I mean, I, I mean, conceptually like it, but say, you know, you could theoretically ping John Allen and think about, see what he thinks about. I don't know if he's they got to do it. See what he thinks about. Adding a behavior. For it.

Unknown Speaker  19:04
He has it in the field, if hidden,

Matthias Miller  19:08
he has it in here, okay. And then it auto generates where it's basically like, if you have a see if you have visible, if false, oh, I sometimes if invisible, Clearfield unsaved and don't require nice That's really cool.

Matthias Miller  19:36
Okay, this one Dwayne said, we have a here, we have a design here. I.

Matthias Miller  20:07
Oh, I thought, Where do we have the don't we have a with ID,

Unknown Speaker  20:16
contact name, and then we have a the name. We have a system switch that

Matthias Miller  20:25
what's the macro that generates it? Id,

Unknown Speaker  20:30
contact, display name.

Matthias Miller  20:36
Okay, default This one doesn't have it the contact. Default display name doesn't contact.

Matthias Miller  20:49
Without ID.

Unknown Speaker  20:53
Okay, I'm tracking down. I'll have it soon. I

Matthias Miller  21:04
contact display ID.

Unknown Speaker  21:11
We have a contact default lookup name.

Matthias Miller  21:18
There we go.

Speaker 1  21:22
Field change when a system switches that we add the ID. Okay,

Matthias Miller  21:29
so here's what he would like to do. He would like to what he would prefer doing is have a,

Unknown Speaker  21:53
have somewhere. Let's start.

Matthias Miller  21:55
No, have a, oh, goodness, I can't find a thing. Well, actually, it is that. So have a starting auto number, so you would just use that in this I guess. I don't know if we can or not contact include and is ID bu square brackets, the ID because the double bracket syntax we assume, we assume that the double bracket syntax the Same as a double bracket syntax, no, but we have a way to set, don't we have a way to say custom database level starts numbering at this number.

Speaker 1  22:55
Yes, no, no. Cool, okay, contacts aren't a custom

Matthias Miller  23:06
they're lookups, right? Yeah, well, we could create 10,000 blank ones and then delete them. I mean, it looks like

Speaker 1  23:21
contact ID is just a field, just a number field,

Matthias Miller  23:29
it's a list field, I

Matthias Miller  23:45
What did you say? Thank you. Thank you. So we have contact ID, the contacts ID, yeah. So the main thing that we need to make sure, though, is that if you set the starting contact ID, okay, so that we that the lookups i

Unknown Speaker  24:24
Okay, we have a max contact ID system switch that is incremented. We can just default if a system doesn't want to start at zero, then we can change that for them.

Matthias Miller  24:41
Okay, yeah. So you would actually, if you want to start at 10,000 Oh, yeah, okay, so perfect. So we

Speaker 1  24:47
literally just set max, set max contact id num. Yes, something is I should have done that off the top of my head, because I coded all of. It's like five years ago, but it was five years ago. That's fine. That's my excuse. Or, Yeah, four, four or five years ago, because when I was in Bangladesh, I think, how do you can I were? I designed it and I coded it?

Matthias Miller  25:16
Yeah, I

Speaker 1  25:23
and it will start at one greater, like, if you set it to 10,000 the first number will be 10,001

Matthias Miller  25:31
is that? Is that editable? Yeah, it is which,

Speaker 1  25:40
theoretically people can people could cause problems, but

Matthias Miller  25:44
I'm sure we do like a min of that, and well, actually, maybe not. I see I

Speaker 1  26:04
No, we're just straight up. Well, okay, you could mess it up for one time. Then as soon as you save a contact, it resets. It sure, because the system switch gets set the contact ID, if it's blank, when you will be set to the max switch plus one. And then the very next line sets a system switch to the max between no just the max between my contact ID and the systems that should be bulletproof. Mm,

Matthias Miller  26:43
I don't know where this was good

Unknown Speaker  26:45
records. I think

Matthias Miller  26:50
this guy, I know I had something about a field for import.

Unknown Speaker  26:55
Oh, I saw that. I

Unknown Speaker  27:07
it might not. Might have been called something. It was,

Matthias Miller  27:17
oh, it's down here. Migration account number. Okay, so here's what we want to do. We will have something like a an account number. I mean, I'm going to answer this. I'm this, oh, should we auto generated? I think this is actually custom account number,

Unknown Speaker  27:54
and we use the contact ID,

Matthias Miller  27:59
or we set it to be okay. We want to be able to import account numbers so you can look up people from old account numbers. If you switch account numbers, this just makes me realize it wasn't fully thought through. Again. I

Matthias Miller  28:31
can we just have a process by which when we import account numbers, we set the next we set the Max. We increment the max appropriately so that we you

Unknown Speaker  29:08
right quick tracking.

Matthias Miller  29:14
Well, this is what he said. I don't know what you if you want to call it migrated account number. Do you have a better name? It's imported account number, whatever

Unknown Speaker  29:31
I've thought about legacy, but historical, historical,

Matthias Miller  29:41
third party. It's not necessarily third party,

Unknown Speaker  29:48
yeah, necessarily

Matthias Miller  29:54
previous account number three. Certainly. Cool. It's not

Matthias Miller  30:13
okay, so here I'm

Matthias Miller  30:25
I think it's basically this, and then here, so you have Max contact ID, then the main thing would be, I should Still get rid of that thing. Kind

Matthias Miller  31:01
look up. It's not that contact,

Unknown Speaker  31:06
default lookup name. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  31:11
Get default display name. Do

Matthias Miller  31:22
Do we want a Can we add a config

Matthias Miller  31:31
to basically override this? I

Matthias Miller  31:40
fear, well, except it might need to go all the way

Unknown Speaker  31:46
into some fear, anxiety and doubt.

Matthias Miller  31:53
Can we throw it in here?

Speaker 1  31:57
So what are you wanting to include them? Yeah, migrated name or the old ID if they have one, if they have one.

Matthias Miller  32:10
So now we don't, if is in a we try to remove the last one to see. Here's the problem. We're not going to remove the last one correctly.

Speaker 1  32:36
How critical is it with the old account number? Probably fairly critical. I

Speaker 1  32:48
like, that's I I'm worried that one will end up being pretty expensive, but there's just a lot of inherent complexity in changing how we do contact name, even trying to work something in,

Matthias Miller  33:02
yeah, I don't disagree with you. Where would we have to show? We only really need to show this isn't

Unknown Speaker  33:14
it, probably in droplets and stuff,

Matthias Miller  33:16
yeah, could we just have a helper list macro?

Unknown Speaker  33:22
Can good. That would be a lot cleaner.

Matthias Miller  33:31
Good. This should be, yeah, that's okay. You're good with that. Do you need more specking than that? I

Unknown Speaker  33:44
No, I'm good. I might wrestle with designer, but look at you.

Matthias Miller  34:05
This is something he was asking for. You can run it past Ellis too. I don't think it'll break anything. I think so, because it's, it's still going to be, I mean, probably the biggest thing is, where, do we contact ID for name, contact display ID, the ID, pad L. I mean, here we pad to four. So it's just plugging in citizenship default to four. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  34:36
that one's fairly simple. I

Matthias Miller  34:45
system switch, presumably.

Matthias Miller  34:54
I think this takes it into a i.

Matthias Miller  35:09
This is a previous I'm

Matthias Miller  35:23
I think this takes us into an appropriate

Matthias Miller  35:35
level, like it's it's pretty simple. I here.

Matthias Miller  35:47
Okay, let's do this. We need to be able to support duplicate customer names across across companies. We need to i

Unknown Speaker  36:05
Are we going to get complaints? The account number is not company specific?

Matthias Miller  36:12
He thinks it's fine.

Speaker 1  36:17
That that would be that would be significantly more complicated, agreed,

Matthias Miller  36:26
wildly more complicated. But I think in that case, we would change previous account number to be rental account number or something, and we would just, I mean, auto populate it, and they would just fundamentally ignore this. I don't know that's how I would, yeah, probably be able to control so previous account numbers and drop lists be able to, yeah, able to

Matthias Miller  37:10
able to control the number of digits, account For the for the contact ID, and Be able to

Matthias Miller  37:41
sorry, Contact IDs.

Unknown Speaker  37:58
Okay. I'm

Matthias Miller  38:24
okay. So then, for the OPT SMS, we're planning to have an opt in checkbox that's only visible for mobile, not editable in detail screen. We'll come we'll have a two Dwayne wants to punt all permission stuff, so I'm flagging them all to do permissions, and we'll come back figure out what permissions and this will be synced with. We have a few

Speaker 1  38:49
permissions we've added as we've gone, but not loads, okay. Generally like, edit products, edit contract definition.

Matthias Miller  38:58
To me, that's fine. Like, in my mind, anytime you have a granular thing like that of can you edit? And I think most of these will probably need for things that should be generally edited, we should also have delete permissions that are separate for contract definitions. I mean, you can edit it,

Speaker 1  39:17
I would guess they'll be the same, right, exactly.

Matthias Miller  39:20
And so anyway, we need so this will be synced in with Twilio. We can defer the x 30 for this. It should be handled somewhere. I well,

Matthias Miller  39:45
also what to do if someone opts out. It's

Matthias Miller  39:58
kind of weird, but anyway, I. These are for manufacturers contract section. I think it's something like I

Unknown Speaker  40:25
uh, amount remaining,

Matthias Miller  40:30
potentially, yeah, I'm not sure. I don't Yeah, like, why would you just force it, drill in and we can always add more. I just this seems like a good minimum. Okay, all right, so that takes care of my stuff for you on here.

Matthias Miller  40:52
I removed. Why did this get moved over?

Unknown Speaker  40:58
I saw that comment. I was very confused.

Matthias Miller  41:00
We had listed some additional fields. Maybe they're not. Let me pull it up and see if it's only test, only

Unknown Speaker  41:12
customers. Jeffrey,

Matthias Miller  41:20
well, it's they obviously never made it on on here, so nothing to worry about. I deleted them from the spec, but All right, okay, we are also massively reworking,

Unknown Speaker  41:38
yeah, see this?

Matthias Miller  41:41
This actually be rental. All right, so we have a customer, we have a rental company, rental rep, manufacture, manufacturer. Rep, dealer and salesperson. It's all company, organization, individual organization, individual organization, individual science. Can't change the type. If you have something linked. You can't, you know, you have to

Unknown Speaker  42:04
have something linked. How do we

Matthias Miller  42:06
like if, if you have, if a rental company has any contacts associated with it, you can't change the type, okay? And then we have validation that, well, rental reps can only be assigned to rental companies. Yeah.

Speaker 1  42:17
Do you have link? Do you have notes about the validation? Yes, the Okay.

Unknown Speaker  42:43
It takes. Also about the Delete, Oh, you do have that. Oh, I see here.

Speaker 1  43:05
Can sales person be like multiple dealers? Or because we had talked about that earlier as an option? Oh,

Matthias Miller  43:15
good point. Does it this mean?

Speaker 1  43:19
Is there a chance of someone's a salesperson and a manufacturer rep?

Matthias Miller  43:27
I think so. Life gets complicated, but I think it's theoretically possible, but in that case, they've got two hats they wear, and potentially you just create your contact records.

Matthias Miller  43:42
Do that is right. Why did we let's go down dealer?

Matthias Miller  43:57
Well, no salesperson would then be if salesperson sells for multiple manufacturers, either he's salesperson. Can't sell for multiple dealers? Yeah, I don't think so.

Matthias Miller  44:17
I mean, that's just weird, but you could have a dealer, but the dealer can sell for multiple manufacturers,

Unknown Speaker  44:26
gotcha, gotcha, but

Matthias Miller  44:28
That's a different type of linking, like we need. It's so RTO company manufacturer must be tied to an RTO company dealer must be tied to an RTO company dealer can be linked to zero or more manufacturers, and I propose that it would be multi select. I.

Matthias Miller  45:14
Um rental rep must be link. These are individual, two organization links.

Speaker 1  45:24
So rental rep has to be linked to rental company. Are these all errors? We just assume they have a configured correctly. They have a rental company. If they go to try to create a rental

Matthias Miller  45:36
rep Well, or they click the ellipsis and create one,

Unknown Speaker  45:40
which no one will know how to do. But yes, well, I would

Matthias Miller  45:43
think that creating rental companies is likely part of the implementation process. And it feels to me like if it's not, if it's not that, I mean, that's, I think it's beyond the scope of our responsibility. So, I mean, I think changing away from RTO company contact type could be as simple as disallow if there are any contacts linked to the rental company, because you can't have any other records linked to the rental company without a linked contact. Well, I mean, theoretically you could have a note template.

Matthias Miller  46:42
I mean, the other option is doing an ND X, some having indexes for all the places it's referenced. An nd X sum, and you say that it's can't be referenced. I just think it's overkill, like, I think you're right. You could almost get away with saying boarding after you create this thing, it will be a rental company, and you can't change it back. Are you sure? And you just allow once, you can't once it's set to rental company, it can't be undone. It's a little severe, but it's not. It's almost defensible. Alternatively, you could make it always be weird only when it's set to rental company. You could filter out the rental company from the list, and you could require them to go into the rental company's detail screen to create a rental company. Now,

Unknown Speaker  47:48
that's a little weird,

Matthias Miller  47:52
though. Filter them

Speaker 1  47:53
out where, oh, I see, yeah, that's a little

Matthias Miller  48:00
i Oh, well, or you just, or just, it's literally

Unknown Speaker  48:05
ridiculous idea. Actually, I don't hate it.

Matthias Miller  48:12
The bad thing is, when you're setting something up for the first time, you're like, oh, I don't have a rental company. Oh, and then you can't create it interactively. You have to go through the rental company thing, yeah, but, but it shouldn't happen that often. Oh,

Speaker 1  48:32
like, literally, I would assume Dwayne's employee set up the rental company when they built when they deploy a system, right? I would think so. And if you're setting it up, you're gonna just go to the rental company's report anyway and click the button there, like see it makes sense. But I like that better than just having in there for all the random people to accidentally set their thing to a rental company when they

Matthias Miller  49:05
shouldn't. Oh, yeah, that's there's a fair point. I mean,

Speaker 1  49:10
I'd rather have a tiny bit of pain and setup then then a lot of pain users that absolutely will set their customer to a rental company because I don't know why.

Matthias Miller  49:27
Okay, so I think such things, there are people who do such things to do. Seth, this is addressed below, so we do need to add this RG,

Unknown Speaker  49:46
oh, yeah, I'll look over it with

Matthias Miller  49:49
also, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  50:01
Anything?

Matthias Miller  50:13
Okay, that gets weird. What happens if, if you went to, what happens if you have a rental?

Matthias Miller  50:36
If you have a dealer with sales, people should she probably shouldn't be able to assign it to different rental company by default, at least I

Matthias Miller  51:19
my space is broken and I'm getting a new keyboard tomorrow. Do you need more from this? Am I being too lazy?

Speaker 1  51:31
Do you agree with this from all the renting stuff, rental linking stuff, or, yeah, like, think I need more at this point. You're gonna

Matthias Miller  51:40
have to move all the payments, you'll have to move all the contracts, you'll have to move the buildings, you'll have to that's a pretty painful process. I would think you should probably that's a really painful process.

Matthias Miller  51:59
Anyway, talk to Dwayne how much he cares. Okay, this, we talked about this, we talked about Okay, so we actually got all that. So now we're down to the payment record.

Speaker 1  52:11
I have a two minute break. Sorry, what? Have a two minute break? Yep, Sure. I

Matthias Miller  53:43
All right, okay, that's answered, and it's not this. Okay, here's a fun thing, payment details, so we don't need customers in the RG, after all, because a payment is only for a single customer, and we're going to freeze the and we're going to

Unknown Speaker  54:04
freeze the field, it wasn't in DRG, I don't think, well,

Matthias Miller  54:07
there were things floating around down here, or was it whatever? So well, in that case, actually, we should just do payment. It's not in here, so let's just forget I say anything, it's more confusing to Okay. So here's the fun thing. Let's start with this. I saw

Unknown Speaker  54:40
that. I didn't look at it closely, but I saw it

Matthias Miller  54:42
okay. So 616, $2,500 350, and 36 so i. So if you contract started at 620 and you paid 350 it moves your due date out to 711 because you didn't pay a full month. So this gets pretty complicated, but basically what you need to do is you have to think of it in terms of fractional first month, hold months, fractional subsequent months. So how much? If your contract started with the 20th your first month is worth

Unknown Speaker  55:31
$500 days. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  55:34
calendar days. It's worth about 150 or whatever it is dollars, and so if your payment is less than that, then you take your percentage, your percentage of days times monthly. No, you take your you take your payment amount divided by monthly payment times number of days in that month to figure out how many days you paid for, and then, and if it's more than that, well, then that first month is covered, then you figure out from that month on, how many whole months did you pay for.

Unknown Speaker  56:18
All right, to me,

Matthias Miller  56:20
it's actually not or not. It's just formulas. Okay, it's basically you need to calculate,

Speaker 1  56:26
yeah, you calculate first how much, yeah,

Matthias Miller  56:29
how much for the first month. And if it's less than that, that's special handling. And then if it's more than that, it's like, we'll split the whole partial months. Yeah, whole months is just a month, Inc, and then the partial months take the following month times number of days to figure out the fraction and what the date is, and it's basically right, but Dave Duane wants to double check it, sure. So the issue is, though, that when you make a payment, okay, he thinks I don't know how you feel about this. You can theoretically just take this macro and slap it in there and call it good, theoretically. Now the calculations theoretically might change. He thinks it's good, but he'll have to check. So I don't know how you feel about that. About that. It's your call. Okay, so then, but on the on the payment, we need multiple rows on this, okay, so you select a customer, and then it populates out a row for each Okay, starts with a row for each contract, and it expands each of those out. So with the it takes, the takes, the latest, the latest due date, is there an outstanding balance? Include that

Unknown Speaker  58:03
I see, and then next due date by

Matthias Miller  58:06
a month, by a month, yes. And then, because some people it's, it's all semantics, but somebody says you're there three months behind it, like, what can I pay for the first two months? Oh, sure, check, check, here you go. But you can't. If you have June, July and August outstanding, you can't pay July and August, or have to pay June, because it's a fluid due date. Does that make sense?

Speaker 1  58:41
And that affects late fees and stuff, then I assume correct, because we need to know, given what they've paid, what their current due date is at any point in time, exactly, and is this payment past due. So we don't actually really need to know what month the payment was for. We just for what we as an under the hood, it's really how much has been paid. We just Yeah, display it nicely for them, basically

Matthias Miller  59:09
Yes, and we need to throw late fees on if they're late, that don't go to the balance. But are late fees, but no, really, right? So the other tricky thing, and this is jumping ahead, and I don't think we should do this until we have due date calculations nailed down, because you have to do the exact thing in reverse. People will also say, All right, so I'm, I'm behind. That's 1070 or that's, that's, that's $680 well, okay, if I How much would it take to get my due date out to the first

Unknown Speaker  59:44
to the first of the month.

Matthias Miller  59:46
Like, yeah, or whatever. It's like, well, if you would pay, like, you could pay 500 now, and that would move it up to the first year balance. And then that, then your monthly payment would start going that way. Or you could pay, you know, $800 and then that would take it out to. To August 1 or September 1, and then it would be on the first that way. So you put it the date, and it goes the same complicated logic backwards. And then chat, chat GPT will get you very close to the reversal thing. And you could even have it say, is it good?

Speaker 1  1:00:19
There's no way we can make if we just have to reverse engineer it completely, right? There's sort of thing, there's no way you can not really. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:00:34
you could say, No, not really. I mean, not really, yeah. I mean you could, theoretically, you can share so we can, actually, we can at least have unit tests. Yes, unit tests for you can have, here you

Speaker 1  1:00:48
because you do unit tests on the one way, and then you do unit tests on the reverse with the answer to see if it gives you the same variables. Essentially, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:01:14
You can share logic for the first month value, so there's potentially some shared logic.

Matthias Miller  1:01:27
But I mean, and you could potentially have,

Speaker 1  1:01:40
oh and then, like late fee amounts, you have to pay higher late fees on June than on July. Like you're currently right, two months past your due date, but you pay, you only pay the two month late fee on June, and then a one month late fee on July. Or, I don't have the months quite right,

Matthias Miller  1:02:00
but it Yes, potentially, but then late fees are weird, because sometimes you can only charge one late fee per account, depending on the state or one. Let me late fee per month or per payment or per like there's really weird logic on late fees that i want to i Uh, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
To go

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
back and forth

Matthias Miller  1:02:42
between, okay, so I would, I would, all right, so, so you have to, you have to get, you have, you have to generate that RG. Okay, now, how does the total payment amount work?

Speaker 1  1:03:01
And this Archie is something they don't add rows. It's just a right. Here's everything you could possibly pay right now for a single customer. Yes, right, right.

Matthias Miller  1:03:10
And, and presumably you would have, probably, you should have, for all of these upcoming due dates. And then, if you want to throw show, do more than a include one in, include one future due date, and allow big payments to be thrown on there, like you might Say, well actually. So this is where it gets I think, I think we need to handle big payments that put money into a security deposit. If they want to keep their payment schedule. They might say, all right, my payments 500 bucks, but can I pay you 1000 bucks? And I want to keep paying 500 bucks a month, but can I pay 1000 okay, sure, so we take 1000 and that's just

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
security deposit. Yeah, I don't

Matthias Miller  1:04:17
know how it works with CRA, but it's just a security security deposit, and then you just use that to finish paying it off, which effect, effectively just takes payments off the end. Yeah, but we're gonna, but payments are going to need to handle security deposits as well. Um, um

Speaker 1  1:04:43
money going into security deposits, into and potentially out of

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
um, out of we're not completely sure. This gets a little tricky. I would like to defer that until we get to the next line item here. Why? Say Yes out of No, you're right. Don't you say

Speaker 1  1:05:04
yes? Exactly? That you're a year and a half into your three year contract, and you don't have the cash for this month. Well, I have 500 down on the in the deposit, so we're going to use that Yep, exactly. So would that be like a checkbox on the RG saying all from security or an amount from security deposit, which you validate is or what is it? Yeah, I think it's a the

Speaker 1  1:05:42
because you theoretically, you pay for this month, you pay 150 cash, and you pay 250 out of your security deposit. So then, don't you want that to be one row in the RG, yes, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
I think, I mean, I think it went on a past Dwayne, but that sounds right. You

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
want to add it to you, Dwayne,

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
I have this. Okay, sure. But then we need to distinguish between total payment amount

Speaker 1  1:06:24
and total amount paid. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  1:06:42
would as I was gonna say, I would assume total payment amount does not include security deposit. In my head, that's what's coming from the customer. But maybe that's not right. I wonder

Matthias Miller  1:06:54
if we could do security deposit. I

Matthias Miller  1:07:06
Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah, I like that. And I don't, I don't think, I think it's fine. Well, anyway, we whatever,

Speaker 1  1:07:18
just whatever are you, when you ask for created by stuff? Are you fine with that just being looking it up out of activity

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
history? Or do you, I think so. The main thing here is we do need to know if it was edited. It was created online, through the portal, and

Speaker 1  1:07:38
then we then activity history won't work, actually,

Matthias Miller  1:07:41
right?

Speaker 1  1:07:44
Unless we default stuff we've been doing won't work either. The even if you don't use activity history, if you default to the current user, well, that doesn't work, right? That's fine thing.

Matthias Miller  1:07:57
We'll have service X 30s that create payments and stuff. Okay, so, so then here's what I'm thinking we have.

Matthias Miller  1:08:17
When you put in a when you select the customer, populates it checks the include payment, the the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28
include On any currently do, right or not?

Matthias Miller  1:08:36
Yes, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:43
well, it includes a row for okay, but we don't. We don't mark that as included right away. I assume

Matthias Miller  1:09:02
that's a great question,

Matthias Miller  1:09:09
because if I call if it's due tomorrow, and I call up and I say, hey, I want to make a payment, maybe you just look at it and say, Oh, it's due tomorrow. Yeah, we'll throw it on. We should just leave him unchecked. He basically said, Look, just do whatever makes the most sense for total payment amount. Well, sure, wait, I'm happy to but I

Matthias Miller  1:09:45
it seems a little obtuse to say I.

Matthias Miller  1:10:00
So in some ways, it makes more sense to say, Okay, here's an option. Payment Amount could be disabled if there are enough, no items checked. So you populate it, but you don't, but you only check things that are overdue. Why would there be things unchecked anyway? So that doesn't matter.

Speaker 1  1:10:30
Yeah, I mean, I would assume we don't care too much. What happens if they're creating a payment when they don't owe anything?

Matthias Miller  1:10:41
Do we? Yeah, so would you,

Matthias Miller  1:10:51
I was thinking total payment amount, okay, I think total payment amount is a, is an editable expression. I motion. Check all past due contracts, all due slash overdue contracts, and set the payment amount to The right amount, and I think this is a I'm

Matthias Miller  1:11:55
Wow, that's fair. So then you would easily

Speaker 1  1:12:02
be, like a silver limb setting or something. It could be your or company rental company setting. That would make a lot of sense. I would think, actually it could be a silver limb setting. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:12:20
So you select the customer, it populates it checks The box and sets the payment

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
amount, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:12:53
So and we checked the box. We fill in the check box. I autofills, amount paid,

Matthias Miller  1:13:13
okay, then also, then here.

Speaker 1  1:13:20
What happens if your due date, like you buy a building on the 31st do you sign your contract? What do we do? How do we increment to next due date? Is it just the end of the next month? Well, okay, so we would do, let's do

Matthias Miller  1:13:40
630 630

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
Well, I was thinking, if it's like 730 107, 31 it would just be

Matthias Miller  1:13:50
it's it uses the the 731 as a base date, and it goes to here. Let's do like 537 31 then it goes to 1030 then 1130 then 1230 that's not right. Oh, this one, okay, here's a bug.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:08
It went goes to one. Wait, what they goes to 1231

Matthias Miller  1:14:12
is the last two date to 131 there's a round here somewhere. Yeah. Well, that's good to know. Let's do I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57
payment. Thank you. I'm.

Matthias Miller  1:15:03
Okay, so then we pop, okay, then okay, if you when editing, distributes them out equally, again, across all checked rows. And we could theoretically create based on payment size. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:15:21
you're saying distributes equally? What if you owe 150 at one place and 500 at another?

Matthias Miller  1:15:31
Well, not to exceed I don't know. I

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
but what? But

Speaker 1  1:16:01
it won't even do it equally across all checked rows, because it you have a

Matthias Miller  1:16:06
rounding issue that needs to get applied to the biggest payment, or something like that. Who knows?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:10
No, but I'm thinking, if you change the amount to 700 and you owe 1000 it's applied in order of due date, right?

Matthias Miller  1:16:26
It's not that would make sense. We're not

Unknown Speaker  1:16:30
going to let you pay July, if you haven't paid May.

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
So why not? I uh, sorted by due date, plus contact creation date, plus contract or contact con contract start contract to

Speaker 1  1:16:55
capitalize the R in contract everywhere, because it that we know it's different.

Matthias Miller  1:17:10
I think that actually makes the most sense, distributes amount editing starts at the most overdue account. If it's if there is an overpayment, applies over payment more than well applies it to the last row.

Speaker 1  1:17:46
Oh, so like, if you owe 1000 total across the month, and you enter 1500 then it applies it to, does that apply to the last checked row? And then it grumps at you if it's more the amount due, or if it's over payment. Then does it add it to the the row that's not due yet, and checks the checkbox.

Matthias Miller  1:18:14
I wonder if the editing the payment amount resets the check boxes.

Speaker 1  1:18:19
Resets check boxes to Yeah, to just, just whatever due date or default or whatever the it resets it to, the resets, resets it to whatever amount, whatever the amount covers,

Matthias Miller  1:18:36
yeah, yeah. Starts from the beginning,

Speaker 1  1:18:39
like, yeah, right. That makes total sense. So what if? What if you have two contracts, and you have, you've paid off both of all the due ones, and you have two $200 left, which is less than either of the last than the next payments? Do you apply? Do you split that? Do you put that on?

Matthias Miller  1:19:01
No, you you put it towards if you have two contracts, first, if one's doing the 12th and one's on the 17th, go pay the 12th one. Yeah. And if you don't

Unknown Speaker  1:19:12
win, if it's none, yeah, that makes sense, even if

Matthias Miller  1:19:14
you're not completely paying it off. If you pay the whole thing off, then you throw it to the next one. And if you are paying more than a month in advance, then, well, throw it on the contract, and if they really need to then, well, then they need to think through, is this a security deposit? Are they paying ahead? How does this need to work? Yep. Okay, so default to

Unknown Speaker  1:19:34
creating as paying ahead,

Matthias Miller  1:19:37
right? Yes, yeah, exactly, yeah, you don't want to mess with security deposit, no, apart from that, okay, so I like it, okay, so total payment, okay, so customers no setting this field auto populates, okay, so this then becomes a and and editable, editable expression based on whether. Oh yeah, payment amount is set. Clear slash sets to do. To amount do, toggle. Okay, that I like so the customers. When you select a customer, do you want to populate the payment amount or populate it to the due

Speaker 1  1:20:26
amounts? I think you do, right? Sure you do. Yeah. I mean, by default, we're going to say, default, you owe us this much, and you know, I only have 800 then, well, we'll go edit that. But our default is assume you're going to pay us everything you owe us.

Matthias Miller  1:20:43
Yeah, exactly. We need to wait to adjust late fees.

Speaker 1  1:21:01
I so we auto calculate late fee, but then we're saying we will sometimes give you, if you're a super admin, you can change it or whatever our permission is, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:21:19
something like that. That gets tricky, because maybe people have some discretionary control over late fees.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:33
I don't know

Matthias Miller  1:21:36
Dwayne's like anybody in my office can run wide open. I don't care

Speaker 1  1:21:42
that. Did he talk with Leanne about it? Because she does care.

Matthias Miller  1:21:47
Nope, he did not, from what I've heard,

Speaker 1  1:21:50
remember we got, she got on the PII conversation? Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:21:54
Well, PII can understand there's a compliance, compliance, regulatory, yes, exactly. But no, she was that's,

Speaker 1  1:22:03
I think Dwayne needs a little more Leanne in his life with managing permissions.

Matthias Miller  1:22:08
I think he also needs more in his life on this project. But she, have you ever tried taking a drive the ship, a real drive the ship operator, and saying, Hey, let me just throw this project on you. Like, if they're actually good, they'll be like, Okay, sure. Like, exactly what part of my responsibility do you want me to not do so that I can do the RTO project? Okay, fair. I mean, it's just straight up a capacity issue, I don't know. Hopefully doesn't bite anybody, but um,

Speaker 1  1:22:44
is she, can we just start getting on some calls? Or it's just like, now, maybe

Matthias Miller  1:22:54
it's worth considering.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
Like, if there's things you're like, hey, Leanne, should really weigh in here, which permission stuff may actually be one of them, I don't

Matthias Miller  1:23:04
know, right? Yes, I would agree. I would agree. Like, hey, Leanne,

Speaker 1  1:23:08
we're going to talk about permissions. We all know how much Dwayne loves permissions. Can you help point where

Matthias Miller  1:23:16
you could probably actually some of that to say, look, Leanne, here's all the we need. A table like, here's all the permission questions we have. Here's a table, a list, whatever it is. Send it over to her and say, Can you map out what you would like to see and have her send it back? And

Speaker 1  1:23:37
that might be, Yeah, makes sense. Um, happens? Processor, yeah, I'm not, definitely not ready for that yet, but at some point that might be really good. It would be thinking we build this out as much as we can, and then we go fill those in. That's right or not. I think it's Yeah, I think it's fair.

Matthias Miller  1:24:03
Okay, do you so this include, this does a toggle, total payment, amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:12
This record is going to be a dizzy I

Matthias Miller  1:24:20
it is going to be a doozy. I mean, I would use something like a, I wonder, if you want to, you have something like a, I guess, as long as you populate the RG, it's sorted correctly. I mean, blank out the RG and then have a repeat RG, if you blank out the amounts first, then you just have a repeater. G, row by row by row.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
Yeah, it's not that bad. I don't think I'm missing something, but it

Matthias Miller  1:24:58
probably is. But. Yeah, okay, so I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:25:11
Okay, this is a big hairy mess,

Speaker 1  1:25:14
big payments. Am I right that we validate every single row is not over the amount due, unless it's a future due date.

Matthias Miller  1:25:23
We could do that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:25
because we should, it shouldn't happen. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:25:29
I mean, it won't happen automatically, but there's no reason why. If I want to move my due date out to out a number of months, I might throw it on my last due date.

Speaker 1  1:25:43
Well, then you throw it on the last don't you throw it on the like the upcoming due date, not the don't we say anything that's overdue cannot be greater than the payment amount

Matthias Miller  1:25:57
that there. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:26:02
Um, and so when you say, have a row for upcoming payment, does that mean I I'm trying to think this through. I

Speaker 1  1:26:23
does is an upcoming payment. I'm calling in five days before my July 31 due date to pay. Is the July 31 the upcoming? Or is the August 31 the upcoming? I

Matthias Miller  1:26:39
think you have, if I'm calling in, I think you have a well, here's where it gets a little tricky.

Matthias Miller  1:26:53
Okay, you're gonna love me and hate me. We could make due date be editable

Matthias Miller  1:27:11
for

Unknown Speaker  1:27:13
due date be editable

Matthias Miller  1:27:15
for future. And if you do that, it adjusts the payment amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:22
Oh, oh,

Matthias Miller  1:27:25
kind of crafty, but kind of scary.

Speaker 1  1:27:28
Oh. I mean, as long as it's, as long as you keep it greater than the prior rose, I don't

Matthias Miller  1:27:41
it really doesn't matter. Then you could say, Well, can I that's actually really interesting, because that's something like Dwayne, like I am, I am, three days overdue. Can I catch up to the 15th? Sure, let's drop in a due date of this amount you have to handle late fees

Unknown Speaker  1:27:58
this now. Well, catch up to the 15th as in. Well, no, I don't want to do it for overdue rows.

Matthias Miller  1:28:12
It has to think less than a month the new date has to be greater than the last due date, due or overdue due date, you cannot change a due date.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:29
Yes, you're saying as long as it's in range. You

Matthias Miller  1:28:45
as long as it's after the last calculated due date,

Speaker 1  1:28:49
do we need Josh or Not? Josh? Are we over engineering or not? Oh, I

Matthias Miller  1:29:26
I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  1:29:34
Like, what if? Can we leave the due date editing for now, get the other stuff working, and then if we want to come back and enhance it, we can, yes, that feels like it's a whole can of worms in itself. For now, it's auto calculated. If we decide to change it, then we, then we don't. Design it. Dan,

Matthias Miller  1:30:00
what I think? I think what would make more sense probably would be to, yeah, let's do that. Okay. Is this in a place I don't think you should spec and then code. I think you should flesh out the spec, make sure you're happy with it. We should take it back to Dwayne before we touch the line of code.

Speaker 1  1:30:19
Okay, I'm good with that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:30:24
so to do, Seth, fix the spec, get it cleaned up into something you believe. And then in back to

Unknown Speaker  1:30:41
Yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:30:42
sounds good. Okay, so I like

Speaker 1  1:30:45
not coding this and recoding and recoding it, yeah, it's gonna be it's

Matthias Miller  1:30:49
gonna make it messy. Okay, so he needs to think about this. Receive payment late. Needs to be done at some point this. We don't that's handled, that's done. Well, I'll leave it to you to clean up. I mean, no, it's not a payment. I mean,

Speaker 1  1:31:07
basically we validate there has to be or do we validate there has to be a road check? Or the amount is non zero.

Matthias Miller  1:31:14
Amount needs to be non non zero.

Matthias Miller  1:31:20
Well, the we might be

Unknown Speaker  1:31:28
including security deposit, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:31:38
yeah, to do permissions payments are applied.

Matthias Miller  1:31:48
I think there are a number of things that we need to handle, but you didn't give us a you have to do the next due date. See, this is where they did the next due date calculation, and this is where you could allow editability, you'd have just an editable expression that ties out to this row, and the rows would still Keep historical due dates. Yeah, I don't know. Late. I

Matthias Miller  1:32:31
Okay, no, but that doesn't answer your question. He did not answer the question of order.

Speaker 1  1:32:38
No, he didn't. I

Speaker 1  1:32:51
I don't feel strongly about having them in that order. Oh, maybe I do it.

Matthias Miller  1:33:02
It's very easy to explain to the customer, well, why? Why is it this? Because that's the way your order is. It's applied like

Unknown Speaker  1:33:11
I like it in that order, I'm gonna do it unless I hear otherwise, just do it. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to have it that way. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:33:27
Okay, outbound payments, okay, this will be, I'll cover that in a minute. This one I didn't understand. Oh, you didn't understand there is no question. I don't know to do

Speaker 1  1:33:48
DB and nothing else. Maybe I don't know

Matthias Miller  1:33:52
you can do, yeah, there was a to do DB right here.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:57
No idea.

Matthias Miller  1:33:59
I don't know if product record needs to be cleaned up at some point.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:02
Yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:12
that's not right.

Matthias Miller  1:34:13
I think after the contract start date, it's frozen, and then only somebody with the highest permissions can change it. I I think that's you copy and freeze

Speaker 1  1:34:29
Justin I need to work on, yeah, stuff, okay, contract total. Does that include Damage Waiver fee?

Unknown Speaker  1:34:39
Like, what is the contract total. How's that calculated? Like? Is that the total amount the con the customer is going to pay?

Matthias Miller  1:34:56
I think so. I think it's monthly payment times terms. I.

Speaker 1  1:35:02
Yeah, but what about and then it's not like security deposit and CRA

Matthias Miller  1:35:10
those are returned? No, it's, it's just a fee. Yeah, it's just a fee that. It's basically insurance you don't get back. I don't know. I feel like

Speaker 1  1:35:26
the contract isn't Oh, we were very confused by your go back. Payment section, up, up, right there. Go down new payment. Comments about new payment link. You had said

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
virtual. RG, with default how we were presumably autofill is a contact Road The RG, no, sorry. Well, that's stupid.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:59
We were awfully confused.

Matthias Miller  1:36:11
Yeah, yep, yeah, how's that perfect? I was mixing, I don't know what

Unknown Speaker  1:36:22
yeah, we kind of figured, but I

Matthias Miller  1:36:26
wanted to make sure, yeah, understand, okay, then the Okay. The main thing we need to do is on the notes. We want a an email note button, which is an email template. It will have a multi select prompt for the contact that it gets sent to, which is a list of active contents, contacts, ideally with the email address in the drop list, so people can make sure it's the right one. Add an Ask prompt for the subject line, and then and then for default the Ask prompt based on levels.

Matthias Miller  1:37:12
So on a contact note, it would go to that contact contract note, primary and secondary, secondary customers on the product, it would go to the manufacturer. On the payment, it would go to the customer, and then they could always change it. So, so

Speaker 1  1:37:27
on the note, record, Hey, what is email note? Is that a, it's a, I'm still trying to track here.

Matthias Miller  1:37:36
Link to an email, merge with ask prompts with sending email as from reply to as Current User Name, Email to as ask, defaulted as prompt subject As as prompt body as content, the note, contents,

Matthias Miller  1:38:09
requires save before run, and Then a print PDF that just,

Matthias Miller  1:38:21
let's see, add a note template, drop list that field.

Speaker 1  1:38:31
What's a field? Ah, gotcha so you can only have one template. Dwayne, don't cause problems.

Matthias Miller  1:38:46
So give it. That's a field so we could report on it. We have set the Okay. And I think we had decided, I can't remember, this is terrible. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:39:02
you default.

Matthias Miller  1:39:08
I think we had,

Matthias Miller  1:39:14
can't remember which call it was. I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:29
I love. How it how is it repeating? Are you searching? There we go.

Matthias Miller  1:39:43
That is correct. I know that's true. It is kind of slick that saved my hide on the it saved my it's starting to save my hide so many times. Yeah, that's really cool. I.

Matthias Miller  1:40:14
Okay, yes, and it should be like, under, like the record, maybe, or under, right above the contents memo,

Matthias Miller  1:40:29
I would think Dwayne, do you want access? Can I sneak a note? Or are you almost finished? Can sneak a note? I think that actually that's everything. I think

Matthias Miller  1:40:59
that gives you plenty of stuff. I feel like we're waiting on Dwayne waits on me, nuts, waiting on you. I think still big picture. We can't do any portal stuff, but I just think we have to nail down Yeah, record. I think you're right. I think we're making good progress. It's just Yeah, yeah. But late fees, convenience fees, all that kind of stuff is going to do wild, crazy stuff too.

Speaker 1  1:41:28
Yeah, okay. Well, that all right, a good chunk to work on. So that's fun. Well, us to work on because I'm definitely not the only one working on this.

Matthias Miller  1:41:40
Do you want to block out Tuesday for us? Trying to think how I need to do this? Oh,

Speaker 1  1:41:49
what time Tuesday? I'm slime, late Tuesday afternoon. Late Tuesday afternoon? Yeah, so I check where my flight is, that sucks,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:19
thinking it's a five something flight, so I'm not going to be in the office for sure after three.

Matthias Miller  1:42:27
Okay, so for sure, what time you going to be in the office?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:42
I mean, that can be flexible. Wait, and

Speaker 1  1:43:00
apparently it's a 1pm flight. I'm very, very confused. Thought I was saying five somewhere.

Matthias Miller  1:43:15
Switch time. I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:33
Okay. Basically, Tuesday morning may be an option, but even by 11, I'll be out okay.

Matthias Miller  1:43:44
Just by 10 my time. So what I might do,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:48
and I may be able to call from the Atlanta airport, that's all. It looks like we've got a long layover. Why wouldn't you must have switched the flight time by like, four hours since I booked.

Matthias Miller  1:44:12
Okay, gracious, yeah, should, should we? Are you going to be out the rest of the week?

Speaker 1  1:44:19
No, I'm working. Okay, I'm out Thursday afternoon. I'm in Wednesday, Thursday morning and Friday.

Matthias Miller  1:44:30
So we could also trying to think what I have for Monday. I'm not seeing a ton for Monday. We could do Mondays are really pretty open times for this type of thing you want to do, like a name the time for lunch for you,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:57
I'm very flexible. It does. It's not a huge deal to me. I.

Matthias Miller  1:44:59
Okay, I think, I think we could do, I could do, like, 12 to three your time, and then on Monday, and then we can block out. I let's see so you have to leave by 10. I'm trying to think if I jump blackout Tuesday morning. Or do you want stuff wrap up stuff on there?

Unknown Speaker  1:45:31
Or do you need wrap up before you head out? A little scared to book it.

Matthias Miller  1:45:38
So what if we did? We I could do a tentative like two to four Eastern, yeah, on on Thursday. No, you said Thursday afternoon. Thursday afternoon. I'm out. So we could do a, okay, well, that's what's what we're gonna get done. I mean, I can't do

Speaker 1  1:46:09
I can double check with Michelle, but I'm pretty sure it's Thursday afternoon.

Matthias Miller  1:46:12
What if we did?

Matthias Miller  1:46:19
What if we just did an as needed or as available. Play by ear block Tuesday morning,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:27
sure, like eight to eight to

Matthias Miller  1:46:31
11, your time.

Speaker 1  1:46:32
That's, yeah, you can block. I may well be needing to drop, but we can, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:46:43
I'll do possibly assist, and let's just play it by sorry if you're fine playing it by ear. I'm fine playing it by ear if you are giving us a little bit of a target, and we don't have to be too hard nosed about it.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:02
So Okay, sounds good,

Matthias Miller  1:47:05
awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you. Have a good evening. Yes, you're welcome.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:08
You too. Bye.
