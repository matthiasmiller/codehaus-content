Unknown Speaker  00:47
Hello, how

Unknown Speaker  00:54
are you guys

Speaker 1  00:59
terrible? The guy that I've been talking to all day has wore me out. And

Matthias Miller  01:06
was that the only thing you were doing today?

Unknown Speaker  01:10
I see what you did there.

Unknown Speaker  01:17
He's going to change the name series for so many only comments,

Speaker 1  01:24
hey, listen it. It is a what do they say? All publicity is good publicity. This makes good publicity. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 2  01:39
How do you spell it? O, W n l y, did you add some,

Unknown Speaker  01:45
yep, O, W n l y,

Speaker 2  01:47
do you? Do you put, like some, some fringe accent to it, or some other,

Unknown Speaker  02:00
you have to see it with your nose slightly raised.

Speaker 1  02:09
Okay, it that is, that is the, that is the proper way to say it. Only yes,

Matthias Miller  02:16
part of the process will be the, the practicing how to say it is practicing. We have a little speech therapist here for you.

Speaker 2  02:30
So what else I mean? Is it like the kind of like a cheap thing? There are there other things that you have to do to be part of this club.

Speaker 1  02:36
We'll have to come up with the only wave i As

Unknown Speaker  02:46
long as you don't have to stick ducks on your dash or something like

Speaker 1  02:48
that. Listen, the jokes will go on and on and on. But hey, listen, if, if, if you can say a whole bunch of jokes, and you're using my company name to do so, then guess what? That's good public that's good publication

Unknown Speaker  03:01
publicity.

Unknown Speaker  03:05
It's hilarious.

Speaker 2  03:06
Just Just the other day, Dwayne, one of my children at said something they asked said, did when Dwayne was here with his chief, did he have any rubber ducks on his dash? And I said, I, I think I remember a few being there, but I'm sure

Unknown Speaker  03:22
it's Addison's fault. He's the one who put him there.

Unknown Speaker  03:24
Okay,

Speaker 2  03:31
good, well, I send out an agenda, basically just a list of incidents to look at and then obviously prioritize. So I suggest we just start there, unless you have, well, actually, I want to do Upcoming Meetings first. So I think we had scheduled an eight, seven meeting. Just want to confirm that, and then also 821, unless there's reason to do one drew or Matthias. Do you think there's a reason to schedule for the 14th as well, with where we're at on that week you're going to be going though, okay,

Matthias Miller  04:20
are we doing retrievals in August,

Unknown Speaker  04:28
the 20 Yeah, the seventh and the 21st

Matthias Miller  04:31
but I mean, the main project is going to be retrievals, Right?

Speaker 2  04:36
Yes, assuming we get through this account, reconcile,

Unknown Speaker  04:44
so good with my first Okay, good. So

Speaker 2  04:54
sales tax liability, reconcile. I think there was a few questions there. Yeah, good. That's i. It

Matthias Miller  05:05
okay. We had wondered about sales tax with use tax, or bad debt with use tax, but bad debt doesn't change how much you spent on materials. You still owe use tax. We had a we had talked about this in a meeting previously. I found it in our intermediate transcript. So I think unless you guys want to think it through

Speaker 2  05:23
again, I think that's no I thought there was some, some further notes from purely down below that we are, is this done?

Matthias Miller  05:38
I mean, I think stuff from our perspective, we think it's done. If you think it's working, if you guys like it,

Unknown Speaker  05:49
well, then we should just check it out.

Speaker 2  05:58
Okay, so you have I have all of your changes Gone? Gone live already? Okay? It's, I think so, just testing for probably, testing for Drew, yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:22
okay.

Speaker 2  06:24
So reporting discrepancies, the big one, right? There's some some things on that. I

Unknown Speaker  06:43
we need to this, moving the

Unknown Speaker  06:56
handle customer refunds. Oh,

Speaker 3  07:07
credit memos, one Nick is either working on or has finished. I'm not sure. I'm not sure he's finished it though.

Matthias Miller  07:18
I mean it is. We really should do something like this, for

Speaker 2  07:30
whatever it's worth. Gosh, is planning to do an update Thursday night because of some other things around us. Friday.

Speaker 3  07:41
Okay, it looks like Nick. I talked to Nick about the credit memo one, but he hasn't worked on it yet. Is that something you would really like to have with Thursday update? Or is it fine if it's like a week out, Nick is currently flying to Holmes county, or because he started dating so that lives about

Unknown Speaker  08:03
a mile from here.

Speaker 1  08:09
Too bad he's not on here for us to rib him. It

Speaker 4  08:15
would be fine if it's not, if it's something that we can do by then, then let's then let's do it. But yeah, there's probably more important

Speaker 3  08:29
things to have done. So your node just yeah, I'll see if he has bandwidth. I'm not sure. I think he'll be mildly distracted the next few days. Yeah,

Speaker 2  08:40
tell he can work out of our office. If that, if that helps. Oh, there you go. Maybe that would be worse.

Speaker 4  08:52
Now, are you talking about that? The change to the AP report that Matthias has highlighted there is that the update you're talking about this is

Matthias Miller  09:01
no it's being able to see time was tied to vendor invoices.

Unknown Speaker  09:07
Okay, okay,

Speaker 4  09:10
well, to reverse it, I would rather have that, make that reversal.

Matthias Miller  09:20
So we said that.

Unknown Speaker  09:29
We said that if the I'm

Matthias Miller  09:34
not quite sure if i So,

Unknown Speaker  09:39
we said we don't want to see a zero.

Matthias Miller  09:46
There's no change to AP when it's used

Speaker 4  09:53
like so when the when the credit memo posts at that point. It reduces accounts payable, right? Well, we haven't. We haven't cleared out the record, as it were, but it has made the change accounts payable. So it's, it's on the report. You want it on the report because it's still a viable thing. We just haven't assigned it to a certain item to pay,

Speaker 2  10:26
but which is incorrect. It's not account. What is it or the report?

Speaker 4  10:32
The report would be incorrect. It had been correct.

Matthias Miller  10:41
Okay, let's try this. Let me rotate this so we can actually read it. So you used to have a credit now.

Unknown Speaker  10:52
Oh, this is five

Matthias Miller  10:58
Brazil dollar wines. Okay, so, but Okay, so in a credit memo,

Unknown Speaker  11:05
when you have

Matthias Miller  11:09
a credit memo and we calculate its impact on AR, then, then the A or A AR gets reduced by that amount at the credit memo date,

Unknown Speaker  11:29
but then as you use it,

Matthias Miller  11:35
doesn't that get undone as you use it?

Speaker 4  11:38
No, there's no change because, because the payment does AR, or one undoes an AP, item is the payment. So you say, Well, I have this $100 invoice to pay, but I'm only going to pay $75 because I have a $20 $25 credit memo. So the $25 credit memo had said negative AP for two weeks now since it posted. Now we have the invoice saying positive $100 on AP, and we only have a 75 negative check going out. So at the point of payment, we have that negative $25 already. It's already in the AP account from back when it posted,

Matthias Miller  12:33
right? So it's really something like this, and then we got to clean up everything and let me see if I can do this without wildly breaking things.

Unknown Speaker  12:53
This guy, I

Unknown Speaker  13:06
Yeah, okay, so then if I run it, how do I know?

Unknown Speaker  13:12
Did I list

Speaker 4  13:15
one where I gave what date and time? Yeah, ABC, 531, of the report used to have the zero in it.

Unknown Speaker  13:26
Okay, this is 531

Matthias Miller  13:28
I mean, we're not showing zeros anymore, unless you want me to show zeros.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
Well,

Speaker 4  13:40
it had been what it was doing is showing the amount that that was what was incorrect. Let's show the

Speaker 5  13:48
Okay, so we changed it

Matthias Miller  13:54
to be 11. Okay, so this one changed SLB, but we don't know where it changed, somewhere up here, okay, there's a Stony Point hardware that showed up with a five, six date,

Unknown Speaker  14:15
is it?

Speaker 6  14:18
Yeah, um, if you scroll down,

Matthias Miller  14:25
Stoney,

Matthias Miller  14:31
well, I wouldn't know without,

Speaker 4  14:33
yeah, if you just scroll down on that record, no, the risk, yeah, right there. Yeah, it looks like it's been applied.

Speaker 5  14:43
It's been applied, but we don't know when.

Matthias Miller  14:48
So Stony Point hardware, Nick's report. Sorry, you have Nick's report. No, I said we need Nick's report. We Yeah, we do need next report.

Unknown Speaker  14:59
Eric's. So this is stony.

Speaker 4  15:10
There's a credit memo. Well, no, it doesn't tell you where it doesn't use

Matthias Miller  15:16
so, I mean, I'm assuming they with credit not paid with credit,

Unknown Speaker  15:23
not paid with credit,

Matthias Miller  15:26
not paid with credit, not previous credit, still not I guess this should show an asterisk.

Speaker 5  15:37
Yes. Okay, wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  15:42
No, I would say, down there, if it is

Speaker 2  15:44
me, you're booked on that, pay with credit or with

Speaker 4  15:48
well, and I would say right by the pair with credit, that it is

Speaker 6  15:54
okay. Well, then let's do let's do this. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:09
yeah, backup, was that?

Unknown Speaker  16:16
Was it back?

Unknown Speaker  16:29
There it is.

Matthias Miller  16:32
It was used on the same day, though.

Speaker 3  16:37
It was used on the same one it was created on

Speaker 4  16:40
it was used on the 14th, and that's what it's supposed to be considered as, because it's the payment date of the invoice. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:49
right, the payment date of the invoice.

Speaker 4  16:53
So by the 50, by the by the 31st this thing should not even be hitting the should not be hitting that anymore.

Speaker 2  17:01
It shouldn't disappear on the 14, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:08
but if the Okay, so we have

Matthias Miller  17:13
so 35 plus 19 equals 54 right?

Unknown Speaker  17:18
Yeah, should anyway,

Matthias Miller  17:20
does so then we do want it to use. And I don't understand how this is, how is, how is the the way it is now wrong, because it's not on here. But if I go back to five, let's try 513

Unknown Speaker  17:41
we should see a

Unknown Speaker  17:45
here's the Stony Point credit,

Matthias Miller  17:48
cm, let's copy this and we change it to 514, now it disappears. Is there a problem with are we using the wrong number on on this vendor invoice?

Speaker 2  18:06
But that's what you want it to do. Not do it. You want it to just

Speaker 4  18:09
well. But there's no, there's no change to accounting that happens on the 14th for that credit,

Matthias Miller  18:22
right? But

Speaker 4  18:23
on the So, so basically, it's not going to match if we show negative 1965 and then take it away,

Unknown Speaker  18:31
but don't you. But

Matthias Miller  18:36
wouldn't you? Theoretically want to, there's no change on on the 13th.

Unknown Speaker  18:49
Why am I not seeing

Unknown Speaker  18:56
here's here's the invoice that was used. Why would we not

Matthias Miller  19:04
continue with the rooms hanging around forever you don't want, or do you? Do you just want

Speaker 4  19:09
to just, I think it was just showing a zero in between, between its posting date and its use date.

Matthias Miller  19:21
But it should. It should subtract on the posting date, right? And theoretically stay around forever. But that's weird. So why wouldn't we add in use credit memos at the date of payment for the vendor invoice balance or account for that so that you don't have a bajillion credit memos hanging around,

Unknown Speaker  19:39
right?

Unknown Speaker  19:41
Does that make sense?

Speaker 4  19:42
How? How do you? How do you account for it? Because, you know, the the transaction that you that you're actually posting with your payment is, you know, a debit of 75 and a credit. I mean, debit. Of 100 and a credit of 75

Matthias Miller  20:05
maybe I'm just being really dumb, but to me, you just have a credit memo show up with its remaining balance, and then you include it in the balance of the vendor invoice, or account for it in the balance of the vendor invoice at the time of payment. And is it technically correct from an accounting perspective? No, because, from an accounting perspective, that that adjustment persists on an ongoing basis, but from a reporting standpoint, it really does make more sense to merge them together so that the credit memo can drop off and the vendor invoice can drop off, instead of just hanging around indefinitely. So

Speaker 4  20:42
so we would just create a a credit, download, use transaction that would really just be the reverse on the payment date,

Matthias Miller  20:55
we just adjust the total in the report for the to include not just the payment amount, but also credits that were applied as a payment date.

Speaker 2  21:06
Oh, your report on this, they're supposed to your report instead of $35 full 54 Right, right. Got it. So if

Matthias Miller  21:19
no, here's the problem,

Unknown Speaker  21:25
if, if it's,

Matthias Miller  21:30
I think okay, currently shows up on AP when, when the invoice is paid. But really this should be, we should at payment date. We should be including all

Speaker 6  21:44
vendor invoice amounts, right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:47
not vendor invoice payment.

Unknown Speaker  21:51
I mean, you would include the payment

Matthias Miller  21:54
as well as credit amounts as of the date of payment. Yeah, I would date has no impact on when it shows up,

Unknown Speaker  22:03
is that correct?

Speaker 4  22:06
Well, so that particular one was just showing up as $35 on their head, and it should show up as 50, and the credit memo should show up as Yeah, just like it did. So

Matthias Miller  22:20
you want, you want these to hang around forever. So you want to see, you want to see when you use a credit memo. You want to see 30 lines for all historical credit memos and

Speaker 4  22:33
no, it goes away. Like when that invoice is paid, it goes that invoice goes away. It's the $52 goes away. $54 goes away.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
Um,

Unknown Speaker  22:49
514 on 513

Speaker 2  22:53
I think on 513 we want this to show the 54 you have there, plus the credit memo as another line item, right? Yeah, and then

Unknown Speaker  23:02
yeah, but this means

Speaker 2  23:06
514, we wanted all to go away, right? The credit memo and the invoice total,

Speaker 4  23:12
yeah, I did not catch but it's reducing it on the invoice total,

Matthias Miller  23:19
the invoice date and then the payment date. Why is this? I'm confused here, though, because

Speaker 2  23:31
what date are we looking at here? Date as of

Matthias Miller  23:34
it's as of the Oh, it's as of the 13th. So now, when I go to, okay, so as of the 13th,

Speaker 2  23:39
we should just see, yeah, the credits down there, and you should have it, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:45
So this is correct. Is that right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  23:47
Now 14, they should both

Unknown Speaker  23:51
these both disappear Stony Point.

Matthias Miller  24:00
And now this is the only stunning point, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:03
okay,

Unknown Speaker  24:04
okay, I think

Speaker 4  24:06
that's yeah, that should, that would work. I did not recognize that it was, it was basically accounting for the for the credit twice on this report,

Matthias Miller  24:16
it was using, it was, oh no, it was using the wrong date to account for the credit. It was using the credit as a date for the payment effective date, instead of using, I don't, yeah, it's basically, it was basically, well, yeah, it was twice off of a weird date range, their weird effective date basically, yeah,

Speaker 2  24:49
and for the payables report, right now, we're just using a user report until we get it nailed down right, right? So is that everything on accounts payable should be no. I thought there was something on AR as well. Are we good to turn this into a standard report now or not

Speaker 4  25:09
first? We probably should test it first, but I think so.

Matthias Miller  25:15
Is there? Can we have a I don't know how much of this is. Is highly I can't keep track of what's what matters and what can we either clean this up now, or can we have somebody clean this up and get all the old stuff out?

Speaker 4  25:33
Well, simply separating it into the different different reports would probably be helpful too, but,

Speaker 2  25:45
oh on AR, well, I guess is that probably you or drew that is going to separate them out. I don't

Unknown Speaker  25:54
clean them up, though, huh?

Speaker 4  25:56
What do you do when you clean it up? You throw it away, or you move into

Unknown Speaker  26:00
history or the archives, you

Speaker 2  26:04
can just copy and paste it in the archive tab at the top. Okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:26
That. Okay, so this is moved. This is still,

Matthias Miller  26:41
this is the whole credit memo. AP, discrepancies.

Matthias Miller  26:53
This is clean. This clean. This happened. I think we said that the deposit. We think this before validation was added. Okay, so all this stuff

Unknown Speaker  27:10
can go it's done. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:22
That this one was done. The aging report is handled above that leaves AP discrepancies, undeposited fund discrepancies, which is Another fun challenge, the discrepancy report, which isn't this. I

Unknown Speaker  28:06
Is this still relevant?

Speaker 4  28:11
Hey, don't Thanks. Well, last week, we talked about, we're simply looking. We want our mismatch report to just look at the net debits and credits to each account, so in a way that will not be valid. But if we're, if we're talking about the mismatch thing there,

Matthias Miller  28:36
do, let's see, do we have a we should note this, though, counting discrepancies?

Speaker 5  28:43
Do we have some? Do we have an incident for that? No, I don't think

Unknown Speaker  28:49
okay. So that's

Matthias Miller  29:00
and then is this one? No this one yet. That shows the accounting impact changes when we stop using the increased cost and start using the cost from the PO itself. So that still needs to be done. Okay, well, at least it's

Unknown Speaker  29:12
a little easier to

Speaker 2  29:16
didn't we have something on AR yet that we archived? I was thinking there was something that we had on AR, discrepancies toward the bottom there. Mismatch. Has that been done? Where ask Wayne, can dealers cancel sales orders?

Unknown Speaker  29:33
Oh, you're

Matthias Miller  29:37
this is broken out into here. I Okay,

Matthias Miller  29:49
so then that takes us over into this one. I guess we should talk at some point about priorities for the let's refresh. For the undeposited fund discrepancies, for the rest of these issues.

Unknown Speaker  30:15
So undeposited funds Drew is isn't the next step for either you or I to to look at those with with Okay, now that ARs and Okay, looking at these different accounts that we're trying to audit we're AR is we can consider it done well, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  30:42
there was something last week where, where are AR notes? Because

Unknown Speaker  30:53
they're archived

Unknown Speaker  30:57
Well, I mean, though it's on that

Unknown Speaker  31:02
it's this one or something else. Oops.

Unknown Speaker  31:19
I that's the credit memo thing.

Unknown Speaker  31:54
So if we i

Unknown Speaker  32:08
Okay, maybe it is done. I'm

Speaker 4  32:25
okay, I'm I'm getting myself mixed up and everybody else, I guess,

Speaker 2  32:30
so is it, is it correct? Is AR is, is is done, at least as far as we know at this point.

Speaker 4  32:37
So here are the vinyl structures

Unknown Speaker  32:52
what all just has to do with customer deposits.

Unknown Speaker  32:57
Check,

Speaker 4  33:01
um, okay, so last week we talked about whether customer deposits on cancel orders, how they post, changing, you know, when they're allowed to post and and so on. Oh, I guess that will play into the AR report, but I think the AR report is, is fine, as long as that situation is dealt with.

Speaker 2  33:33
Well, isn't that what we're what we're seeing on the handle customer refunds incident,

Unknown Speaker  33:36
okay,

Speaker 4  33:42
yeah, that would be that. Okay. So then AR would be done,

Speaker 2  33:50
and then AP is done with God the credit memo, things we talked about. So it seems like customer deposits now the next step is for one of us to spend some time before we do anything.

Speaker 4  34:05
Got it that is, where's the handle customer fund? I mean, I don't think it's going to be much. Be very helpful to dig into customer deposits until we have that customer refunds thing done. Okay,

Speaker 2  34:19
well, let's take a look at the candle customer overpayments. Are we? Are you looking at? Oh yeah, here's that.

Matthias Miller  34:32
Having a loud vendor invoice. We got sign off. Josh is happy, as long as what was his caveat. Seth, I don't even remember. Have a comment in here if Dwayne's happy, he's

Speaker 3  34:47
happy for, which he said that right imports have to always be able to cancel.

Speaker 2  34:59
Which, that's pretty. All your the note that for you is to date the old refund payments that day before cancelation. Yeah, so are you saying we need this development, this report, done before we before it's prudent to look at at customer deposits. I mean,

Speaker 4  35:25
I wouldn't say that we wouldn't gain anything, but we will know that there will be some issues going into it. Well, let's buy this. So if we clean these out, we can look for new issues. I mean, how, how close are we to

Speaker 2  35:43
to having this done? I guess this plays into our priorities as well, and set priorities.

Matthias Miller  35:51
Yeah, I mean, it's half a day to day of Seth and my time to

Speaker 6  35:59
everything I said, two days, we're probably going to want to work together on this again.

Speaker 2  36:03
So I don't think there's more to look at on bad right, just right now,

Unknown Speaker  36:11
right? I yeah,

Matthias Miller  36:13
I think, I think if you change the old refund payments to the day before cancelation, you probably could theoretically start looking at it.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
Yeah, probably

Matthias Miller  36:24
there may be other surprises when if you do that. Okay,

Speaker 2  36:33
so let's look at discrepancies for receive net voucher. DREW You did some.

Speaker 4  36:41
So, yeah, that report seems to to work.

Unknown Speaker  36:51
So

Speaker 4  36:54
probably the only question here is actually, with that $450 item, why? How it ever happened, but

Speaker 4  37:06
so it's an invoice with no expense line, and I'm supposing it had a PO at one point, the PO got canceled or got removed. I

Unknown Speaker  37:24
you'll find this guy.

Matthias Miller  37:29
Okay, so this one so it doesn't balance, basically, right, which is problematic. And so accounting transactions, if we go in here,

Speaker 4  37:41
I like it gets pulled out of receive, not what I'm assuming is there was a PO at one time that had a, you know, that pushed it into receive, not voucher. The po got deleted, and now this is still showing that proceed on voucher transaction, but

Unknown Speaker  38:03
that was pulling up the wrong

Unknown Speaker  38:05
thing. Okay, so here we have,

Matthias Miller  38:11
well, it had been under non operating expense, Uncategorized, and it got taken out of that, and it got and we had a had it linked to a PO num. And now the RG doesn't exist, which is bizarre. We don't have activity history on that. But if we go to activity history on the purchase order, and we look for this record ID, and we will see that, cancel, no po clean up. Well, we have a purchase order somewhere. It just got unlinked or something. That's why the guy so it used to be the deal got canceled.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
So here's the we actually

Unknown Speaker  39:01
received it the way that looks.

Speaker 2  39:16
So what happens if we just uncancell that we'll bring that po back and link it again like,

Unknown Speaker  39:25
um,

Speaker 4  39:26
well, under the under the new fix, it should post to 2025 and fix our problem then, but, oh,

Unknown Speaker  39:36
this is in 24

Unknown Speaker  39:39
Yeah, but it can't post to 24 but there will be a change

Matthias Miller  39:41
that it would say, hey, we need to post this change. Well, I mean, this doesn't have any accounting impact. And then this guy right, got it, because this guy should reverse the RnB, right?

Speaker 4  39:57
All over does is reverse it. There's nothing ever putting it in to RnB,

Matthias Miller  40:04
right? Change. Then drew says, Ah, this vendor invoice you need to push across. And we push it across and it balances.

Speaker 4  40:15
Well, the vendor invoice is already posted. That would be fine. It would be the purchase order that would need to push across. So we're we're sitting $450 correct in RV from way back then, because we don't hit any expense accounts with this thing.

Matthias Miller  40:33
It's weird, though, because technically, the vendor invoice triggers the RnB, not the purchase order. The Purchase Order has zero accounting impact at this I mean, it has zero accounting impact,

Speaker 4  40:49
yeah, okay. But since these values already posted to the accounts that it would want to post, it would only post the net value, yep.

Matthias Miller  41:00
Okay, zero to be happy. So the answer here is we need our new counting impact, reconciliation, reconciliation, or we can use what

Unknown Speaker  41:17
this fakes would do is it would

Speaker 2  41:20
put something into it. Would put would put it into RV again

Unknown Speaker  41:25
in 25 okay.

Speaker 2  41:30
And then it would match our report as of one 125,

Speaker 4  41:34
do Do you have the link there

Unknown Speaker  41:38
to that report, to that? Yeah,

Speaker 4  41:45
no, the PO like, the PO needs and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  41:48
So here is the

Speaker 4  41:51
Yeah, but it would show up on the invoice once it's once the PO is

Matthias Miller  41:59
there. Oh, there's the sorry, that's the weird. That's weird.

Matthias Miller  42:09
Yeah, I mean, the vendor invoice will actually, again, it's weird, but, but it's how it works, yeah, vendor invoice will show up as a discrepancy that should continue showing up as a discrepancy in your accounting impact discrepancy report, and then you'll have the option to push that to buy it out, yep,

Speaker 2  42:30
but the rounding thing as well, or not there was,

Speaker 4  42:34
yeah. I mean, I don't know. I guess if you see my report, it goes one cent on a particular item.

Matthias Miller  42:45
I think it's potentially because

Speaker 4  42:50
the printed report that I posted this one right there, so that on 327 there's a difference, and then it's the same item going out on four, four.

Unknown Speaker  43:05
So

Speaker 4  43:08
I don't know what it goes by, but I'm assuming it's just a rounding difference in the way the records figures compared to the way accounting figures, or something

Unknown Speaker  43:19
it was gonna do. Look at.

Matthias Miller  43:30
Well, this could be related to that the invoice cost field that we're using potentially, but I don't know for sure. It seems thing to chase it and have it work the same

Speaker 5  43:46
40708, no, you don't have the Do you have the VI

Matthias Miller  43:52
number for that? Do you? Yeah, great. You

Unknown Speaker  43:58
can search by date.

Unknown Speaker  44:00
So, but if you 327,

Unknown Speaker  44:04
no, well,

Unknown Speaker  44:07
now I don't recall whether I found it or

Matthias Miller  44:11
not. It might be on the purchase order, purchase orders.

Unknown Speaker  44:20
I think it,

Matthias Miller  44:27
three slash wing seven. That's is this 2024, 25.50 you should include complete and include canceled.

Unknown Speaker  44:42
Um, then

Matthias Miller  44:44
we should do a total cost of let's try this one. Let's try this one

Unknown Speaker  44:51
you don't like. It

Speaker 4  44:56
might be why I didn't have a number, because I never. Found it.

Matthias Miller  45:03
But because theoretically, the cost could vary based on

Unknown Speaker  45:07
impact,

Matthias Miller  45:09
or if somebody changed. Well, no, but we could look by a transaction. The

Speaker 4  45:14
transaction, by the number, should be, I mean, unless it happens to be a combination. But

Matthias Miller  45:21
let's do all time,

Unknown Speaker  45:23
ABC, then the amount. There you go.

Matthias Miller  45:28
Let's try Oh, eight or nine. We don't know which.

Matthias Miller  45:37
Well, that's it.

Speaker 2  45:40
Whatever we would look at accounting transactions as of the day it happened, and the day after. And for for those, like for that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:52
that's anything that we could just do on that day. Well, I guess, yeah, right

Speaker 2  46:02
now, the the amount you want to leave that blank?

Speaker 3  46:06
Oh, I'm sorry I'm in the wrong. Yeah, that probably shouldn't go from to amount.

Speaker 2  46:14
I agree. I make the same mistake all the time. So it's just one of the things that that we've never,

Unknown Speaker  46:29
I mean, but

Matthias Miller  46:32
we would expect the amount is this, the total transaction amount for

Unknown Speaker  46:42
or do you have only that account?

Unknown Speaker  46:47
Oh, I could write. Or we could do the

Unknown Speaker  46:49
RnB. Or received,

Unknown Speaker  46:53
yeah, yes, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  46:57
Okay, so then,

Matthias Miller  47:00
now we could do, we could still add,

Unknown Speaker  47:11
I know that's lying, but

Unknown Speaker  47:16
so you're looking for a difference. So

Unknown Speaker  47:21
order number is 033566,

Unknown Speaker  47:26
is there anything like 407?

Matthias Miller  47:30
Or 449, like this? One's the one that's closest.

Unknown Speaker  47:37
Are any of those a combination,

Matthias Miller  47:40
right? Well, let's, let's do

Unknown Speaker  47:43
this the 119 and the 213 or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  47:48
Yeah, which

Unknown Speaker  47:52
Ashton? 1-234-240-7080, many said that was three. Daily

Speaker 6  48:04
that

Matthias Miller  48:27
maybe it's not really faster, so we would have

Speaker 7  48:33
was not instant mental miles, 153,

Matthias Miller  48:40
61, that's not right. 40708 minus 21308, is 194 doesn't exist. There are no subsets. Come on. I

Matthias Miller  49:05
406 14, 404 44

Unknown Speaker  49:14
is there any

Matthias Miller  49:17
Yeah? Three could have, well, no, three

Speaker 2  49:21
and a half, okay, but, but the one cent different here is, is not in accounting. It's just accounting is doing something different than the report, and right? We're

Speaker 4  49:34
trying to figure out what the we don't even know, where it's pulling its record from,

Unknown Speaker  49:41
this change,

Matthias Miller  49:44
right? That's, that's the fundamental issue is that we don't know. Well, okay, that's fair. That's fair. So really, what you want to know is, for each of these transactions, do? We think it should be one of these, and really

Speaker 4  50:04
can use the missing process if, if I recall correctly, I looked through everything that's on the report that changes the report as of that day and all the transactions to see if they match. And they all match, okay, like what the record says, the accounting says.

Matthias Miller  50:25
But I wonder if there's a rounding issue, a minuscule rounding issue, that is triggering this. And I wonder if we would do something as simple as, can we easily rerun this report to check

Unknown Speaker  50:53
like if we would do we should be able to do as of

Unknown Speaker  50:59
any date you want

Matthias Miller  51:01
as of the 327,

Speaker 7  51:05
so we should see 3863,

Speaker 4  51:10
so second column is the Total on the report on that day. What?

Matthias Miller  51:17
ABC, 3415967, 415967, so let's try this. Though, round. Yeah, it's a it's a weird under the hood rounding issue that it shows up correctly here, but there's fractional sense, and when it sums, it creates a rounding difference. I think,

Unknown Speaker  51:55
almost sure, I

Speaker 4  52:01
think this is right, sir, that was all across this sense that we've dealt with

Matthias Miller  52:08
that's interesting. I mean,

Speaker 4  52:13
is that like the the woman that swept her house find her lost coin? Yeah, yeah, if I remember, right, there were about five possibilities and POs that that could make the number, and they all seem to match counting

Unknown Speaker  52:35
the drivers

Matthias Miller  52:41
like I don't know it's good turn into, okay, this

Matthias Miller  52:54
is on a PO, SKU, RG row, so this should be what surrounded out here, I think received ordered price per

Speaker 2  53:07
i think this, this may tie in with a project we have queued for Josh where rounding issue. Take a look at one of Josh incidents, something about rounding on vendor invoices or,

Unknown Speaker  53:26
I think, yeah,

Speaker 2  53:32
that one rounding for SKU lots. So

Speaker 2  53:41
it's only for SKUs with large unit multipliers.

Matthias Miller  53:54
Well, I wonder if this is the same issue here, then,

Speaker 4  53:57
because it is dealing with POS and so on.

Matthias Miller  54:02
I mean, the question would be, we can tell fairly easily which one of these got

Unknown Speaker  54:13
well, no, we can't. Can we

Matthias Miller  54:19
62 No, we can't because we don't know, but presumably I'm gonna, I'm gonna be very suspect of us. Lumber, well maybe

Unknown Speaker  54:36
you

Speaker 3  54:38
do a have a column beside it where you evaluate po total cost equals round two of po total cost

Unknown Speaker  54:50
that might do it.

Speaker 3  54:55
Yeah, there we go. Right? We don't know exactly which one, but it's potentially on Well,

Unknown Speaker  55:05
you see the price per for 3.1249

Matthias Miller  55:13
right? Four decimal. So that's very likely, or in this one potentially, and this one likely.

Speaker 2  55:22
So if Josh fixes his thing, it'll fix this issue,

Unknown Speaker  55:29
right? Yes, okay,

Speaker 2  55:36
so I think I think we turn this report into a standard report. And I think that's all that's needed that world up on receiving that

Matthias Miller  55:46
voucher. Do you want us to do a workaround for the rounding issue, or wait until Josh fixes it?

Speaker 2  55:52
Just let Josh fix that. I would just know. Rather just let it go for now and we just know that it's it'll continue to be there until Josh fixes it at the purchase order level.

Unknown Speaker  56:05
Where do you want this on the menu? Somewhere?

Speaker 2  56:10
Um, yeah, places the accounts payable report is going to be, probably in accounting. Accounts Payable, yeah, somewhere in that, in that subset, or

Speaker 4  56:26
that bunny trail question, is it a nick project for re, rearranging that menu?

Unknown Speaker  56:35
That'd be great Nick, or even Sean.

Speaker 4  56:37
So if I would, if I would just well, so the other rearrangements in the menu spurred to actually look at this menu a little bit, and if I would give you a Excel spreadsheet with everything just laid out,

Speaker 3  56:55
then that would work. Yeah, yep, That'd work great. Yeah, Sean will be very happy to do it. I'll I'll show it

Speaker 4  57:01
to mark and make sure he's pleased, and we'll go from there.

Speaker 1  57:06
And if you're going to do some menu rearrangements, it'd be nice to see it as well so I can share it with the team in here. Because, yeah, to get I already get whiplash when we start moving things around, like I can't find things. Where did this go? We changed everything

Speaker 4  57:20
well, it's supposed to make a lot more sense to

Speaker 1  57:23
you and to me and to most people, but not

Unknown Speaker  57:28
to everyone. Yeah,

Speaker 3  57:29
um, so for that report, we just need to make it standard, add it to the menu, yeah, just make and just call it received, not vouchered.

Speaker 4  57:42
Or what do you want to call it? Well, whatever we call the other ones like this,

Unknown Speaker  57:48
is it aging?

Speaker 2  57:50
You know what? I think we should maybe, when we rename or reorganize these, we should come up with, yeah,

Speaker 4  57:56
call them aging for at this point. But it's really not that, but it could be used for that well

Matthias Miller  58:05
and when you but when you put your spreadsheet, if you're doing renames, please include what it is now and what it's going to involve, yeah.

Speaker 4  58:13
And can I throw some links into other stuff and other menus, like vendors?

Speaker 3  58:22
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, there's nothing on the accounting menu right now anyway, so we should add some more

Matthias Miller  58:30
while you're at Drew. It would also be wonderful for you to take all of the favorites that you're using from my IFR folder,

Unknown Speaker  58:38
yeah, and list them in there too well. That's what we're working on. It's just they're not done yet.

Unknown Speaker  58:47
Sure, one, here's one,

Matthias Miller  58:51
one at a time,

Unknown Speaker  58:58
good. So four, done with four,

Unknown Speaker  59:00
five,

Unknown Speaker  59:04
I think we looked at five last time. Didn't we? Did we look at this one? If not? Let's take a quick look at

Matthias Miller  59:13
it. I can't remember that we did. I

Unknown Speaker  59:15
don't think we did then.

Unknown Speaker  59:20
She was incorrect, as if,

Unknown Speaker  59:23
yeah, okay, this one's really

Unknown Speaker  59:29
odd. We should update to 1098

Speaker 2  59:34
so take a look at the finished goods cause, and you'll see the production labor 1098 as of 630 when actual calls were applied and this building was not invoiced until after 630 this one states stuck, if I remember correctly, the state stuck at the $840.08 4053, but then another one, okay,

Unknown Speaker  59:58
since once. Which it's 624 what

Matthias Miller  1:00:06
is the 624 to take him? It was right because it was invoiced prior to it was invoiced prior to actual cost being applied. No, are you sure?

Speaker 2  1:00:17
No, I don't think it was invoice prior to that. We had a quote, but maybe that was the only thing we could think of, was the quote, like, it's still a quote. This has not been invoice, yeah, so

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
sorry. This is not a building. I am so wildly confused. So the dates that we use building build date. So the building is built on 624 so that's where we got the build date.

Speaker 2  1:00:48
So before until six, 624 through 629 it should have shown that lower number, that's the standard cause, and then jumped up to the 1098 when we applied actual clause. And we have another building that's identical to this, that works correctly. The only difference is that one was not connected to a quote I believe.

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
Okay, well, this is just, I would also vote that Seth and I, for both of our sanity, look at it together and Okay, trace it down and fix it,

Speaker 1  1:01:30
guys. I need, I need to drop off. I need to call Aaron about a situation here. So unless you need me, I'm gonna jump off.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:37
Good. I get it. Thank you,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:43
accounts receivable,

Speaker 2  1:01:50
oh, some kind of strange things gonna Okay. Go back and open it from the menu. There's, there's a prompt or in a warning showing up, that's okay. Sometimes, when I open it, I'll get a red prompt that says,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
I bet it's from your favorites or something, or not. It

Speaker 2  1:02:18
might be where it says something about the district x as thing, but, okay, yeah, click on your deals here. What we're trying to do is like you get every dealer that there is, then you select a district and your sheds direct your legacy dealers go away. Now, if you scroll down, you should there's no longer any shits, right? Dealerships here, but they're there, if you

Unknown Speaker  1:02:48
so,

Matthias Miller  1:02:55
game dealers, active, active dealers for district,

Speaker 2  1:02:58
I don't know. No, I think legacy dealers are like, also have a districts. But basically what we would, what we're wanting to do if, if this is possible, is just when you select your you select your district and and the date, and then whatever dealers are listed whatever dealers have. Invoice is listed on the ER report. Just show those

Unknown Speaker  1:03:26
if you have or but

Speaker 4  1:03:31
if you change your, if you come back and change your date, then I will kick off your

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
your dealers. How important is that? Because we're going to I mean, it's, you're a person, engineer, the report to, yeah, you're gonna basically have to run the report for every dealer when you put in the date before you even run the

Speaker 2  1:03:53
report. Okay, the way this is typically used is people come to the AR report either look at the thing as as a whole whole, or they're looking at, I don't look at everything, but my shits direct dealers, because I'm responsible for for that, or I'm only responsible for, like, they're going to one way. Okay, if somebody's looking at this for the for the new house dealers, they would just go to the dealers, start typing in new haz and select all of those. Just yeah, like, do that, or a control A and just get all of those, and then look at those. Or they might want to say, do not include these. So I don't think I mean, I understand what you're saying. Coming back and you make selections and you come back, look at it for a different date range, all they would have to do is just rerun it again, which I think is fine.

Speaker 3  1:04:54
This filters out dealer it checks dealer network. The index does this one? Does,

Matthias Miller  1:05:04
and is an ABS,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:11
it's not as fast, but

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
spread out, too bad.

Matthias Miller  1:05:18
So then if you do this, then you can do sheds, direct, yeah,

Speaker 6  1:05:20
well. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:58
I mean, can we? I mean, we can, I think something that we could theoretically do, if this is critical, is lets you run the report so we can model then and then, have a

Speaker 3  1:06:15
well, what you would do? I don't know if I like this, but you could have a pain that shows the dealers, and then this middle part would this left part would be a sub pain. Then, of that, could you do it? Can you do a open reporter graph for selecting records? Yes, with Oh, calling ourselves and passing values, calling ourselves the dealers. And so you would highlight them and then filter by selecting dealers.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
Then what are we gaining?

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
I don't know. I don't understand what let's let's go back to the use

Speaker 2  1:06:52
case. So what does the report do now that you have that you like you have it now.

Matthias Miller  1:06:57
So it shows the sheds direct. And again, we should show sheds direct as well when you select the district. And we'll change that, but basically it lets you select sheds direct dealers.

Speaker 2  1:07:17
They, yeah, they didn't until but, and now you're only showing the dealers that are listed that have invoices here.

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
No, that's I'm saying. To filter this down to only the dealership invoices is tricky.

Speaker 3  1:07:38
Basically, you have to create the report, and then you get the Ask prompts, and then you get the report again. Or you you subset the report, it'd be slow, very slow.

Speaker 4  1:07:49
Can you, um, well, you could make a side pain of the report where, like, if you hit one for a certain dealer or highlight one for a certain dealer, it gives you the list for that dealer or something like that. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:08:05
what I was suggesting. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14
look like

Speaker 3  1:08:16
you'd run you'd have a pain on the left that would be totals and subtotals only of dealer, and then pass that into the right side. And

Matthias Miller  1:08:29
then you could highlight and then you had a row that shows all of them. And then you could highlight multiple dealers based on what you want to see.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:36
And you Where would you selected

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38
values for something

Matthias Miller  1:08:42
mean, yeah, pretty sure. For

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
enhance, yeah, yeah. And

Matthias Miller  1:08:57
then you still need to replicate the AR logic between those two records.

Speaker 2  1:09:08
Well, okay, I mean, if, if it's, I think just adding the at least for, for right now, just adding the sheds, direct deals to that drop down list would surprise.

Matthias Miller  1:09:23
I'm open to finding a solution for this, but I'm worried. I'm a little worried about the effort required versus the benefit, but if we understand better what their workflow is and why they need it. Like, if people literally are assigned to AR for specific dealers, then why don't we? Why don't we set up an assignment method, such as, here's the dealer's default AR person, and when you pull up the report, it defaults to your AR dealers. You.

Speaker 2  1:10:01
Okay. No, it's okay right now, the way it is is for shed strength. I'm responsible for those, and then somebody else is responsible for all of the others. And okay, they'll want, they'll want to look at those separately, like their retail sales and their their wholesale accounts separate, but that's why.

Matthias Miller  1:10:22
So then let's add versus filter, or an inward in network versus out of network dealer. Let's add an Ask prompt for that.

Speaker 2  1:10:35
So what is in network and out of network? Like, what? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
we have retail versus wholesale groupings. Is that what you want?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49
It's not completely

Speaker 4  1:10:50
well, couldn't people just select the ones they always look at and save it to their favorites? Oh, those as prompts. Or Can't you memorize that sort of thing?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
Yeah, I think we

Matthias Miller  1:11:03
have a wholesale dealer checkbox. So why wouldn't we forgive me if I'm being stubborn and ignorant, but why couldn't we just have a wholesale or, like a retail versus wholesale drop list, and you can filter the dealers down by that further as well. So you have district down here, you'd have wholesale versus retail, blank equals all. And then doesn't that give you what you want?

Speaker 2  1:11:29
And then beyond that, you have individual so could we do wholesale, retail and legacy, those three options? And then,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
yeah, yeah. What do

Speaker 2  1:11:44
you find? Well, if you go to sheds, direct dealership,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
isn't it, the in network

Unknown Speaker  1:11:50
checkbox

Speaker 3  1:11:53
is non legacy, and if it's unchecked or yeah, if it's unchecked, it's legacy, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
We could double check by looking at, like a shits directive. Oh, seeing how that's or that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:08
that should now that

Speaker 2  1:12:12
one, it's we need to look at shits directive.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:22
Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:26
Do shit,

Matthias Miller  1:12:27
yeah, yeah. So they're not in network, but they are wholesale, so retail would be any retail, wholesale would be here. Let's do this prompt, here, let's do this prompt for retail, any active dealer not marked as wholesale, wholesale, any active dealer mark any active in network,

Speaker 7  1:13:01
network dealer marked as wholesale,

Matthias Miller  1:13:08
wholesale, and then legacy would be any active not in network dealer marked as wholesale.

Speaker 2  1:13:18
And can we, can we name that whatever we want to if we can, I'd call it jets direct instead of legacy. Just, yeah, okay, so we would have,

Speaker 3  1:13:29
are we worried about any falling through the holes? Because, well, we have

Matthias Miller  1:13:35
all retail going into retail, then you have full size, yeah, you're right, active network. And so if you have a, if you have a not in network retail, it's going to show up in retail. Yeah, we could change it, but it sounds like that's fine. And

Speaker 2  1:13:51
if we leave all the selections blank, both these three selections and the prompts and the dealers it, it'll show everything that's in AR. Okay, so we select these prompts and then, or if we do, then we we only get the dealers that fit that criteria below that, like this, two levels. Okay, good. I

Speaker 2  1:14:23
That's all we need. So ignore my, my other nodes as far as to be included, excluded.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:32
Okay, see and this, okay, great.

Matthias Miller  1:14:35
So then and the subset to respect this note, you cannot use I'm.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:08
Okay, I like it makes me happy. Good, sweet.

Speaker 2  1:15:16
Okay, let's see seven is remove companies from a list of accounting companies. I was curious, what happens there, if we

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
Yeah, I had a 724,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:30
or Yeah. Incident 0724,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
okay, let me. Let me. I did.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:38
Deleting accounting. I thought signal,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:47
I expect there's a reason, like,

Matthias Miller  1:15:56
I am sure I talked with this is really here. I know where it is. Okay, give me just one minute here. I talked to Ellis on this on the 24th AI is so ridiculous in terms of saving my bad note taking skills. I think the short answer is that we're open to getting, letting you, giving away to delete them. We got to delete all the transactions and stuff like that. But because you guys aren't paying, you guys aren't paying an additional accounting subscription, it would be T and M to do it. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:44
and the biggest thing is that we need to, and actually, I actually put together a little report.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:06
so

Matthias Miller  1:17:09
you can see here, like for insight we have, I don't know what that is, but we got vendors tied to it. We got SKUs tied to it. Got to

Speaker 8  1:17:20
make sure the for, well,

Speaker 4  1:17:25
to use the things to order apples or something like that. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:17:28
can we just inactivate them?

Matthias Miller  1:17:32
Like, is that? I think it'd be fine.

Speaker 2  1:17:35
Um, all I want is it's just for them to go away, so that you don't have those you're selecting for three companies, and you get, yeah, six options. So if an active like, would that do that?

Matthias Miller  1:17:49
Yeah, that'd be fine, I mean,

Speaker 3  1:17:53
but we have so many different ask lists. They don't all some of them just a reference to list. Some of them do other things. So

Matthias Miller  1:18:05
it's, this is a good nick job, or even Sean job, yeah, actually, no, it is.

Speaker 2  1:18:09
I mean, what, what is the right fix here? Oh, I'm, I just want them to go away. That's all. This

Matthias Miller  1:18:16
is the, I think this is the right fit. I mean, theoretically, the main this, main one Seth, all we need to do is stop shipping the built in chart of accounts and the built in main record. And I think that's completely reasonable, but you still need, I got rid of one of the other ones. You still need it. So we have two options. A really, really simple solution is to keep insight, the Insight company hanging around, and we get rid of main because it's not used, okay? So you'd have four instead of three. Then what

Speaker 2  1:18:53
about the chart of the columns showing up as well?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:57
Honestly, I got rid of that. You

Unknown Speaker  1:18:59
did. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:03
Yeah, it's, it's, it's gone.

Speaker 2  1:19:05
Oh, well, then, then I would say, you're saying delete main is like, easy to do.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
Yeah, pretty easy. What would happen

Unknown Speaker  1:19:16
if we delete inside?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:20
The biggest issue would

Unknown Speaker  1:19:22
be, oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25
okay, no,

Speaker 2  1:19:28
I forget what it is. Dude, delete main and leave insight just hanging out there that that's fine, completely fine. I think at some point we should do our accounting for insight inside of software as well. So

Speaker 4  1:19:41
what you need to do is get Mary Brook to hook up for ordering by a kanban guard, and then you could then it'd be worth having it there.

Speaker 2  1:19:52
Tell your brother, if he's in the area, to be here on a Wednesday and and get some Mary Brook song. Pretzels from their truck.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:09
We have, I don't know, is it an obsession, but

Unknown Speaker  1:20:15
a bond? Yeah, I

Speaker 3  1:20:23
It's the Mary Brook soft pretzels.

Speaker 2  1:20:27
Yeah, Mary Brook Baking Company or something. They're, they're in Mount Hope on Wednesday. But I think they're, but, you know,

Speaker 4  1:20:34
they're all over. They're Millersburg on Fridays, Worcester on Saturdays. I'm not sure where all plus special events are in there.

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
Seth, are you fine? Just not. This

Speaker 3  1:20:56
is in your court to make sure it happens. Is that fine? Yeah. Do you want just assign it to me. Instead of having it, it's easier for me to keep track of when I'm the main assignee. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07
perfect. Good.

Speaker 2  1:21:10
So, a update, copy this purchase order function, a few, a few more changes that we you make some changes. Oh, this would be nice to have. So the latest down at the bottom, I think this was Sean job, so not urgent, just whenever

Unknown Speaker  1:21:29
I Oh, I see

Speaker 2  1:21:32
gotcha or whoever running it. Yeah, yeah, Sean can

Speaker 3  1:21:36
definitely do it. I think the first part is done. But yeah, those last few

Speaker 2  1:21:41
you are correct. It was Mark completed. Aaron double checked it to make sure it's doing what he wanted. Oh, I'd like to do this too. Also, Yep, I'll watch Sean now. Nine is pretty much the same thing, just a few add ons you would like to as listed there. So,

Speaker 4  1:22:00
yeah, just totals for the groupings on the report.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:07
Or a user report being grand total,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:10
yeah, and a grand total,

Matthias Miller  1:22:13
just you, or Sean said, Sorry, what is this? The COI report? I'm just

Unknown Speaker  1:22:25
trying to assign it to me for now, and I'll delegate from there. So

Speaker 2  1:22:32
retrievals better handle for retrieve buildings. So Matthias, you're thinking we look at this next meeting. The that's fine, yeah, the Sabbath, well, we can see that. Okay, I mentioned to Josh this morning and said that we're wanting to push this one forward because we need to get we believe we have to have this working so we can reconcile or finish its inventory properly with so he's expecting you to reach out to him at some point on on the work he needs to do there. But so if we go to prioritize these projects, number one sales tax liability that's just testing Drew's court reporting discrepancies.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:34
It's just a test, APD one,

Speaker 2  1:23:38
yeah, we said, Okay, we also have undeposited funds in there. But where we ended with that? Did we say next step is you do some testing on that as well, before we do any development. No undeposited

Speaker 4  1:23:52
funds is the thing that is the stripe payout clips that needs fixed.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:07
We can go, man,

Matthias Miller  1:24:10
it would be really nice if there'd be some kind of way to use tagging or something somewhere to be able just to pull the report, and then we can Update the order. And I

Matthias Miller  1:24:31
we want something like I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:50
Well, let me begin settings, Okay, never mind, I don't know. Let's

Speaker 2  1:24:56
ignore the I deposit. Just ignore that for right now. So reporting discrepancies, that's testing on your part as well, right? And some, I think there's a small, think there's a little bit of work, or

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
this is testing undeposited fund discrepancies. Are we leaving that in you guys's court until, I mean, we know there's problems.

Speaker 2  1:25:22
Well, okay, I think this should be one of your top priorities, then to work on on the known problems that, I mean, that's what I'm hearing through.

Speaker 4  1:25:34
Because I can't, I can't isolate which problem it is. I mean, I mean, I can go through and I can just open, like, look at every single problem, but most of what I found was this one.

Matthias Miller  1:25:46
So let's do this. Let's, can we break this out into new Yeah, good.

Speaker 2  1:25:56
Is that more important than handling customer refunds that important?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:04
I mean, it's

Speaker 4  1:26:05
up to what you want to see, but I just the handling customer refunds is also holding back one of these. So if that account is more important than the then AR or whatever,

Speaker 2  1:26:20
it's just whichever is most efficient for walking through this. I mean, if you have an opinion that's

Speaker 4  1:26:25
I'd say, let's wrap up the ones we've been working on first and let this one sit. Okay, the undeposited funds.

Speaker 2  1:26:32
So do the customer refunds first, and then the undeposited funds.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39
Just for less, lose them.

Matthias Miller  1:26:47
Okay, so we're gonna go away. Okay, so refunds first,

Speaker 2  1:26:54
and then on deposited funds and positive funds, then we have accounting discrepancies for receipt, not voucher, and I think we ended with all that we need there is to take make that a standard report. We're going to ignore the rounding for right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:17
So we said, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:27:22
that we receive that voucher, right? 737, let's make sure that's in score.

Speaker 3  1:27:29
Assign it to Sean or Sean, yeah, I shot him a job is he may well be working on it or No, he's working on other stuff right now, but that'll happen soon. Then

Matthias Miller  1:27:41
we have FTI, this guy, this is correct,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:44
yeah, I put him next. Then the AR report changes, the Remove companies from list of accounting companies that, yeah, I think those are the right, right over,

Speaker 2  1:28:03
yeah, I think just as they're listed here, with the exception of customer refunds before undeposited funds, which deposited funds is on number two there, yeah, or it was, I guess he's broken it out into its own. And so which is good. So

Matthias Miller  1:28:23
customer refunds, undeposited funds.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:29
There's also

Unknown Speaker  1:28:31
technical debt,

Matthias Miller  1:28:34
document so accounting impact,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:38
potentially, um,

Speaker 4  1:28:44
document is that what we were talking about

Unknown Speaker  1:28:50
last week,

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
yeah, where we said, it's really confusing to understand and we should we should

Unknown Speaker  1:28:59
listen. I

Speaker 2  1:29:03
it documented you and Seth cannot travel on the same

Matthias Miller  1:29:09
Exactly. Yeah. I mean us showing up, me being at his wedding was almost too much.

Speaker 3  1:29:18
Probably should try not to be in the same state even. Yeah, probably, what are your family reunions? Hard?

Matthias Miller  1:29:25
We'll zoom you in. And then I will also, and then for for me, I'll try to connect, connect with Josh on retrievals this week.

Speaker 2  1:29:41
I mean, on the technical debt is that something where you're in the middle of it right now, you want to do it while it's fresh in your mind. That's the urgency.

Matthias Miller  1:29:51
Yes, the urgency is that, and it's never a good time. So if we make ourselves do it next quarter. Gonna be, like, we should probably go back and do that, and everybody's but why would we do that? Like, that's not necessary. So if we have, this is Josh, and I say this all the time, if we have the discipline to do it, I don't mind deferring it. I just question whether we're gonna have the discipline to do it. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:30:17
well, the friction I have, like, frictionless teams or the what I'm the only hesitation I have is I want to get these balance sheet accounts, the reports and the accounts working and matching. I would prefer to defer it until after that. But, I mean, I could be convinced to do it now as well. I

Matthias Miller  1:30:46
do not trust 95% of the world with a statement like that, but I would genuinely trust you with a statement like that. So I don't have a problem with that. Let's do that

Speaker 2  1:31:02
good. So I know we're at 90 minutes. If we have five minutes yet, I'd like to touch on number Well, Dwayne said, said to ask you about this. This is one of the coolest things that he's you're doing with only,

Matthias Miller  1:31:21
ooh, the Oh, the the notes,

Speaker 2  1:31:24
yeah, notes as a record. He was like, he was telling me, you can turn it into, basically, turn it into a mini project management system, and it's

Matthias Miller  1:31:34
so, yes. So the way it works is, typically, on a contact record, you would have a you just have a notes memo down at the bottom. Instead, you have a new note. Pop open a new note. It's tied out to the contact, and you say, hey, oh, by the way, Seth, this is supposed to be pre populated like this.

Speaker 3  1:31:53
Did you make a note of that somewhere that was in the spec? I think we'll, we'll get to it. Nick, this is still working. So then we say no, is Hey, hey, Jeffrey needs to be

Matthias Miller  1:32:06
Hey. We should never rent another contract to Jeffrey. He is a little bit different. And then, and we should probably retrieve his building. And, I mean, it's weird that this is not a contact. But then you say, alright, so Jonathan, either Jonathan or Sean, because they're who's who are the scary guys, Jonathan and Austin, you put the people to go retrieve the buildings, because they're the scariest people that we have so and then please make sure that we get it done by August 15. And now this note is my birthday. Oh, nice birthday present. Don't tell Seth he's getting the building for his birthday, I'm with his girls. So then, so what's supposed to happen is these notes will then show up. Read Only here, and you can see a whole list. Then you can say, all right, my notes? Well, this isn't search notes I want to see. All right, what is Austin working on? And, I mean, this is pretty basic, but Oh, Austin needs to go retrieve this building. And you can either pull up the note and jump into the contact or hang on.

Speaker 4  1:33:43
So well, yeah, I made the comment just the other day. AP, made this highlighted, beautiful note in there for me to notice something. And I'm never going to see it like unless I haven't opened that vendor invoice. I'm never going to see that note. It's going to do absolutely no good. I mean, especially the highlighted portion of it,

Matthias Miller  1:34:01
right? Totally. So this is a way and then, but it's a generic record, so you can report on the record. We can and then, for project management, what we're planning to do is bow and make a note for myself. Be sure to make the cupcakes. And we're also going to put this. We're going to do this. It's going to be for me. It's supposed to default to me, but it isn't. We're going to do it on the 19th so the notes for myself are just tied to my user record. And technically that, I think I should theoretically be able to pull up my user profile. And anyway, so the brilliance in this is basically, you now have an audit trail that can be tied to any record. You can report on all of them. You can have a master list of, oh, I got to follow up with this. Bi the sales order this. It's all in one report. You can click through to the sales order, see what's going on, check it off. It's done all that kind of stuff. Stuff. So

Speaker 2  1:35:03
is this? Is this brand new? You're doing this for only the first

Matthias Miller  1:35:07
so, I mean, what's the I mean, we could, we could make it terrible, but it's only friendly.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:16
So should, okay? Several questions, should we? Should we add this to assist as well?

Matthias Miller  1:35:29
Well, I wonder if there's a version of this. I feel like it's probably not that good for incidents, and I don't know what Josh just added. I'm a little nervous about having a third way to manage these things. It seems to me like there should be maybe some consolidation with incidents.

Speaker 7  1:35:50
And we're maybe we should be able to link incidents to through

Unknown Speaker  1:35:58
other records, through

Speaker 2  1:36:00
other records. When you say incidents, you're talking about what we just looked at, like what we use for software development, because, Josh, yes, we're also using projects and actions. Or

Unknown Speaker  1:36:12
if you go out of CRT, it'll help.

Speaker 2  1:36:19
Or projects go to the templates, one that that shows you, shows best. So here you have your on the left. Top left, you have your project name, your project templates. Top right, you have your action templates that go with with each one. And then down below, you have it broken down. And on the left, you have your instances. We're asking Josh to make some updates on these, some some because we're wanting to use this more. And I think what you're saying is, like, I think the idea would be having this consult, having what, what you just showed me having that consolidated with these projects, probably, but, I mean, it's the right approach to to not do it for now, but in the future, after it's, you're done with it, and it's, I don't know for it's further refined, and only then have a conversation with Josh, you guys, Dwayne and see

Unknown Speaker  1:37:27
work.

Speaker 2  1:37:30
Where's the way not bringing this all together? Or is there a win?

Matthias Miller  1:37:34
Yeah. I mean, I think maybe, yes. I think it's probably, maybe we finish it up, and only I wake up at some ungodly hour, and Dwayne and Josh and I, we walk it through with that, Josh shares his opinion about how this ties in. Potentially, we could use this for follow up actions on incidents to say that, okay, Drew needs to go review this again. Like, I don't know. Maybe that's overkill. I don't know. Probably is, but I don't know. And get Josh's perspective on how he sees a time in Okay,

Speaker 2  1:38:11
good. I think that's, yeah, I mean, Dwayne and I thought of all kinds of scenarios where we could use it, or we think we could, but just like, your example is perfect, or, like, install for a highlighted note. It doesn't help me see it any better. It's not flipping through a stack of produces and, Oh, that one's highlighted. Like, you don't open solve for him. Say, I see the highlighting paper

Unknown Speaker  1:38:36
that's five pages down. But good.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:41
Well, good for now,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:44
that's all I had. So, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:38:48
sounds good? Well, we will, we will. We'll take a look at customer refunds. We can look at customer refund six months or next week and get, try to get with Josh. I don't know if we'll get to any positive funds or not. We'll see, and we'll go from there.

Speaker 2  1:39:03
And you have a list of this prioritized to where you you have what you need, as far as

Matthias Miller  1:39:09
on the list, I have what I have what I need. And Seth can use the list except customer refunds and undeposited funds

Speaker 5  1:39:16
are. Okay. Good, good. Awesome. Yes, thanks,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:23
thank you. Yeah.
