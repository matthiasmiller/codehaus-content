Unknown Speaker  00:35
Hey there

Speaker 1  00:54
so Matthias Can I plan on running through quick task updates and then getting off the call I think that's the best approach all the experimenting I've been doing Okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
Ale

Matthias Miller  02:40
gotten caught up in a good conversation

Unknown Speaker  03:57
Telling us in that mindset okay thank you

Unknown Speaker  04:19
yeah

Unknown Speaker  04:19
yeah

Unknown Speaker  04:20
yeah

Unknown Speaker  04:21
yeah

Unknown Speaker  04:25
let me hang out that's not going to work

Unknown Speaker  04:32
sorry for all the background

Matthias Miller  04:34
no worries

Unknown Speaker  04:38
we were for some reason

Speaker 2  04:41
our data is down at least for internet so we're just going to have to do it by phone

Matthias Miller  04:51
that works

Matthias Miller  04:59
all right here let me Be yeah Audrey can share your screen for Ben and I will just have to

Speaker 1  05:08
sounds like plan well, I'm just doing task updates I'll start with Matthias we have quite a few incoming ones that I stuck on Friday that will probably get reprioritized but for now better sections on income statement. Where are we at?

Matthias Miller  05:26
I think if there's anything that's on there there were some revisions drew wanted and I that's in my court to get those over to Joel Okay,

Speaker 1  05:33
is this the correct one it says the statement with multiple level percentages and shows current account numbers is that the correct okay great. cash payment ID temporarily for reconcile

Matthias Miller  05:49
drew Have you been able to play around with reconcile in the last couple days?

Unknown Speaker  05:59
Yes. Or what you said

Unknown Speaker  06:07
you repeat when you said the list was Oh yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:11
The reconcile Have you been able to play around with that and look at the speed

Speaker 3  06:16
oh the speed Yes. I haven't I haven't worked on the large accounts. I just picked them a smaller one that seems fairly similar maybe it's slightly improved but and maybe that's just because I got a lot of transactions moved through it.

Matthias Miller  06:38
I don't know. Well, let me just take a quick look then. Is there is there anything that you would expect to be the slowest

Speaker 3  06:54
the CSB ABC protected

Matthias Miller  06:58
okay

Unknown Speaker  07:01
I mean, that's the one I've been in before

Matthias Miller  07:08
Okay, so it's interesting

Matthias Miller  07:27
just take a look at this. It looks like about 1000 lines is that which should be

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Yeah, probably.

Matthias Miller  07:38
So it's definitely not in instant

Matthias Miller  07:52
so let's just do this let's it's it's about three seconds for delete 1000 lines. So we will consider it to be in adoption and in your court in your complaint if it's it's an issue with Cheque Printing as I recall, there's a few minor things voiding checks is an outstanding issue on that but I should make a priority Okay. Besides that for Drew we use enough text and then there's a subsequent change that I pushed through to adjust signature positions but that's independent

Unknown Speaker  08:44
for accounting warn if adding child accounts

Matthias Miller  08:50
this dropped off my radar you can leave it on

Unknown Speaker  08:52
okay

Speaker 1  08:59
Okay, now we're getting into some incoming ones the deposit module update improves speeds for deposit module that's redundant

Matthias Miller  09:09
Yes, that is redundant and I think he could work okay

Speaker 1  09:22
yeah, let's see this can through an email so this says it was supposed to be fixed and update last night which never happened. It's that one.

Unknown Speaker  09:31
Okay.

Matthias Miller  09:34
Let's I think we can basically we can probably close this out in drill if you run into more issues. It either close it out or having it injuries coordinate, test the deposit. Make sure

Speaker 3  09:52
I wasn't able to get in there. That's what I was trying to work on trying to get connection for some reason I just have no internet connection. So

Speaker 1  10:03
Okay, so we're gonna keep it in Drew's cart for testing until we can verify that. Is that the way to go? Okay. Okay, sounds good. Air diagnostics reports. This was an email, let's say, two Excel files to review you sent to Drew or mark and Mike looks like.

Matthias Miller  10:32
And so this one has been a reconciliation.

Matthias Miller  10:46
Mark, do you have any update on the AR reconciliation reports?

Speaker 2  10:54
No, I do not have to look at them with Dwayne, but at this point, no, I don't have any.

Matthias Miller  10:59
Okay. And were those just for you for diagnostics? Or is this something we're looking to add to the menu then?

Unknown Speaker  11:10
I don't I think they're just just going to need them. Yeah, for one time.

Unknown Speaker  11:21
Good. Okay.

Speaker 1  11:24
I'm switching that to Mark's courts. New reconcile request, which is an email from Drew. Which is this one.

Matthias Miller  11:38
Primary cap refund? Yes, those are partially resolved. I didn't want his result item two is how how to handle how do we want to handle discounts on vendor invoices. Wait, we

Speaker 3  12:09
that's on that one. We just concluded that just go ahead with putting your warning on and use that report to fix any issues and we'll just have that be the time you know, the way it's used for the time being.

Speaker 1  12:26
Okay, that's right. done for now. Well, it's

Matthias Miller  12:29
actually this is under AP. Let me create a change request for this. Okay. Warren if payment total is incorrect. If specified payment total should should equal either invoice total were invoice total plus discounts worn if not so then you can close this one out and look at that

Unknown Speaker  13:08
okay

Speaker 1  13:14
easy way to catch duplicate transactions was just came in so I wasn't sure how to prioritize

Matthias Miller  13:28
like the first week of January, is that right? We were targeting?

Unknown Speaker  13:34
Yeah, that's correct.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
Okay, pull that out.

Speaker 1  13:40
Okay, allow attachment statements to allow attachment statements to reconciles should

Matthias Miller  13:47
be attaching. Okay. I'm going to say early to mid January on that one as well. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:06
And what else? Allow company specific signature adjustments?

Matthias Miller  14:15
mid January. Okay.

Speaker 1  14:22
Okay, do we have anything for better handling and labor intensive buildings? Nope.

Matthias Miller  14:28
In my court. Okay. Filter

Speaker 1  14:31
payment types for vendors by company. I'm

Matthias Miller  14:36
done pending an update. Okay.

Speaker 1  14:46
And then I think the rest of the stuff we have one December for you as all of this nice to have stuff and I don't think we're doing anything with it. Am I wrong on that?

Matthias Miller  14:57
Yeah, I think that's right. Okay.

Speaker 1  14:59
So am I missing anything for what you would need to do before the end of December?

Matthias Miller  15:07
We had we had bumped the payroll stuff down. I think we could. I shouldn't have done that. Can you move up to next week? The there's a with heroin. Yeah, there's like two or three payroll changes from the January. The ones, those three in the seven teens. Just moving back to December 17th or something. Gotcha. Okay. These three

Speaker 3  15:39
that's maybe you've covered it already. But do you have a date for when the reconcile event log is coming? Like where we can do the end date?

Matthias Miller  15:52
That one is doesn't Joel's court? So we'll get to that in a minute.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
Sounds good. So we're good with your tasks, I think. Yep.

Speaker 1  16:13
Okay, I do have Okay, here's what Joel looks like, right at the moment. Oops, maybe not. There we go.

Speaker 1  16:26
And I added something on here from email. So I'm sorry, things just keep jumping around right now. Joel, there we go. So urgent priority is to track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation event log. You have an update on that?

Matthias Miller  16:43
I do not Joe was not able to make the call.

Speaker 1  16:47
Yeah. And I haven't heard anything either. So

Matthias Miller  16:52
let me do this. Sure. Would you be available to talk tomorrow about reconciliation? As well as a plan?

Matthias Miller  17:12
I might. Let me let me see if I can. Yeah, I'll try to connect with Joel on that and see if I can help him move it along.

Speaker 1  17:20
Okay, are the priorities still basically so reconciliation event logs, first one groupings for balance sheets we have on the second one. So attachments for deposits, you would send an email saying that this is an jewels cord but I didn't know if it belonged to these tasks. Josh is somewhere Oh, it's in Josh's gourd. Okay, so I just misheard that or misread that. Okay. groupings for balance sheets. So for Joel, we've got three as income statement for level one. Account wrapping in PDF. At cash flow statement is the fifth and the sixth is voided transactions. Does that all look right?

Matthias Miller  18:02
It does. Okay. Take that out. Joel. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:07
And move on to mark.

Unknown Speaker  18:11
Sure. Okay.

Speaker 1  18:13
So for Mark, I have create a standard template for miscellaneous sales orders initially created outside of assist. Is that complete?

Speaker 2  18:24
No, that's still it. Two companies are using it the third. So okay.

Speaker 1  18:33
Okay, great. How about implement process for entering and assist all sales orders? Is that the same thing? Implement a process for entering and assist all sales orders initially created outside of it?

Unknown Speaker  18:47
What was it sounds like the same thing. What

Unknown Speaker  18:49
was the other project? Well, it

Speaker 1  18:51
said create a standard template. So I imagine they're just basically the same, aren't they? One is a template one is a process.

Speaker 2  18:58
Yeah, you could, I would mark the first the template complete and leave the other one at about 65% completed. Okay.

Speaker 1  19:07
That makes sense. Okay, how about adding asset groups to core accounting that's in testing.

Speaker 2  19:24
Adding asset groups. Oh, we've tested that. Yeah, that's done. Okay.

Speaker 1  19:35
AR diagnostic and reconciliation report. We just added that to your list from a diocese. Build a payroll do report. We said that's interesting.

Speaker 2  19:52
Payroll do report. Is that what we're asking? What we would create for payroll service, like where we need to get her data? It says, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:07
what we want to send to Whitney is a comment I have

Speaker 2  20:12
that no change on that. Okay.

Speaker 1  20:17
See, customer updates for sales reps in developments. Do we have a background on this? Matthias

Matthias Miller  20:28
seven, five or more? Let me okay. Check it take a look. We'll see what no, sorry long system

Speaker 1  20:46
Yes, actually, it looks so is this one here anyway?

Matthias Miller  20:51
It looks like we had out next year. It is okay. That is a next year thing. Okay, nevermind,

Speaker 1  20:56
I'm misreading dates. So it looks like the three things that we have for you, Mark before the end of the year are just what we just talked about. Are we missing anything important?

Speaker 2  21:07
Yeah, there should be a payroll transaction, like a payroll transaction. I forget what we'd call it, but basically to enter payroll transactions push payroll transactions into assist accounting.

Unknown Speaker  21:32
Okay. Matthias, do we have that? And if I've missed it,

Matthias Miller  21:39
I suspect we don't have it. And Mark, is that your quarter Drew? There? Yeah. Which of your quarters?

Speaker 2  21:49
It is in my, my court coat? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:54
Okay.

Speaker 1  22:00
All right. Is this a testing issue or design issue?

Unknown Speaker  22:05
Design? Okay. Would you use it sample size? Would you?

Speaker 2  22:17
Matthias is this actually this might be it. I'm going to put it on Josh's list. And Kim. If I know what I want. I just don't know. And don't have don't know. For sure I build it and you don't have me don't have the time. Because it wouldn't I could ask Josh if he could build something like that. And Libre Office unless you want to just because he's done some work in libre office. And he thought

Matthias Miller  22:54
Yeah, I mean, I don't know that matters much between between him or her I or I don't know who else

Speaker 2  23:08
I mean, that's my gut feeling is that Josh has more capacity right now than than you do. But would you do?

Matthias Miller  23:20
I don't I don't have an opinion. I'm happy if you take the Josh. Okay.

Speaker 2  23:29
I'll leave it in my corner for now. But yeah, I'll talk to you. Okay. Okay, great.

Speaker 1  23:40
You see, I think we can move on to Drew then. Which, for Drew, I have Asset Management and depreciation schedules. I guess that's adopted. So we're gonna say maybe, is that done? Can I mark that done?

Unknown Speaker  23:58
No, I think that's supposed to be on Mark's plate actually.

Unknown Speaker  24:00
Okay. To review.

Speaker 3  24:08
Yes. I mean, yes, it's reviewed your work. We've done adopting. The program's option is in March, corn is in

Speaker 1  24:17
Mark score. Okay. Sounds good. Mark, does that make sense to you? Do we have any issues with that? Okay. Okay. How about accounts payable, accounting impact? I also have that in adoption. So does that go to mark as well?

Matthias Miller  24:43
Well, sure, you've been reconciling. So I'm assuming.

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Did you say we can mark that done?

Unknown Speaker  24:55
I think so. Okay.

Speaker 1  24:59
Then And I have vendors outside the US entry update needed. Yes. Okay. And then a testing accounting in the live system actually, that's probably a next year item says, or it's continuing on through next year. And then you have a continuous item.

Matthias Miller  25:23
That's kind of everything. I mean, yeah.

Speaker 1  25:25
I kind of figured I don't know that we need it. It was just one of those from and holding over.

Matthias Miller  25:35
exclude it? Should I get rid of it? Yes. It's pretty inherent.

Speaker 1  25:42
That's why I figure Okay. Whoo. Hey, Drew, you got nothing right now? I know you're doing

Speaker 1  25:57
all right. It's, well, let me know if we're missing anything that you're actively responsible for. Otherwise, it looks like the stuff you're doing is probably either in Mark scored or Matthias, is that? Right?

Speaker 3  26:10
Right. I mean, it's probably what it is, is I'm waiting on an update now. You know, by the time I when I get the update until the next time we have this meeting. It's the same quarter as it was.

Speaker 1  26:26
Fair. Okay. Dwayne's not on? I don't think we need to go through his stuff. Everything for Dwayne is an adoption or deployment. receive payments process?

Matthias Miller  26:41
That right. Yeah, let's let's go through it. So that we don't miss anything. Mark, do you know where that's at?

Unknown Speaker  26:51
What was the project? Sorry? receive

Unknown Speaker  26:54
payments process?

Speaker 2  26:59
receive payment process? I mean, we looked at that last week. They were here. I would say it's complete. Would you not? Think so? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  27:18
Stripe accounting impact?

Matthias Miller  27:22
Is that something you're viewing?

Speaker 2  27:30
Well, we've shown Dwayne how to use that. And that there, I would consider that completed that their project to go through that would discuss they would go through that once a week or so just cleaning up any discrepancies that need to need manual work there. Okay, yeah.

Speaker 1  28:01
I will mark it complete. And then script stripe, discrepancy reports.

Speaker 2  28:11
Oh, sorry. What was the what was the one? I thought that that was the one we were talking about?

Speaker 1  28:17
What was the previous stripe accounting impact? Let's see. What would that entail? Matthias?

Matthias Miller  28:26
I think we can lump these into one and I don't think he cares about. I would close that out in lieu of stripe the status of that, that we said actually applies a strike discrepancy report. I think we close this one out.

Speaker 1  28:42
So close accounting impact. Yeah. Okay. And then the discrepancy reports are part of that I can close that or they're still pending?

Matthias Miller  28:53
No, the sorry, whatever the status was that we just said on the Yeah. If that's if that's in their court, and they're running with it, then I think we can close that one out as well.

Speaker 1  29:08
Yeah, the latest comment, was it I guess it should be reviewed periodically. So it looks like Yeah, that's probably the same thing.

Matthias Miller  29:18
The only other thing in Dwayne's court that I know, just for the sake of mentioning is the deposit process, which I messaged him about this morning and haven't heard back. So I don't know that we don't know that we've got let's see sales or deposit process. Is

Unknown Speaker  29:42
it the sales or deposit process we're talking about? Yeah, let's

Matthias Miller  29:45
see what we've got on on. One.

Speaker 1  29:49
I have it for you. So but in Dwayne's court 75

Speaker 1  30:02
Yeah. Okay. Looks like I don't have a due date for this does it need to be done by the end of the year?

Matthias Miller  30:12
Presumably the good thing about this is that people complain fairly loudly when deposits don't happen. So chances of it falling through the cracks

Unknown Speaker  30:27
there are some things in life that just take care of themselves see if

Matthias Miller  30:33
this is true.

Speaker 1  30:38
Okay, I think that's it. Does anybody has anything you want to add?

Speaker 2  30:45
Oh, one thing that I just thought of to add to my list would be to create and implement a deposit counselor for builders to use when doing deposits. Okay.

Speaker 1  31:05
I need to jot that on another note or create, create and implement, create and implement deposit slip.

Unknown Speaker  31:17
I would say create an implement deposit depositing process deposit

Unknown Speaker  31:23
process. Yep. Okay. needs to be done by the end of the year. Are we looking out next year?

Unknown Speaker  31:32
By the No, it needs to be done by the 12.

Speaker 1  31:42
Okay, I will add it to your list as soon as my system stops being weird.

Unknown Speaker  31:53
Okay, anything else?

Speaker 3  31:56
One thing I just thought up to the size, we needed a report on an account, specifically the uncategorized expense GL account, or we add a payment type column to it. Normally, when you just pull up the ledger, you get a report of all the transactions that are in that account. And we just need to add a column with the payment type so that we can sort by payment type to figure out this will be used for diagnostic purposes for any of those Uncategorized expenses so that we can figure out what they were getting categorized properly.

Matthias Miller  32:45
Could we give you that from a vendor invoice report? All vendor invoices that have items assigned to the uncategorized.

Speaker 3  32:58
No, because because these items don't have vendors, invoices like this is the other items transactions I'm getting from the statements rather than through that route.

Matthias Miller  33:11
So what you really want is a report that shows all transactions based on. Okay, and here, let me pull this up. I think odds are for the sake of this conversation that's done. Let me write up a change request for what we actually want. We need to talk to you a little bit about what we actually need here. Okay. Sounds good. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  33:48
Thank you so much. I'm dropping off. Have a good meeting.

Matthias Miller  33:50
All right, thank you.

Matthias Miller  33:57
All right. So Drew, we do have a transaction search report that shows it on the left pane but you want to sort based on so don't you really what you want is I want to find old transactions that are for primary checking and Uncategorized expenses.

Speaker 3  34:25
Right? Right. Okay, or primary credit card or whichever of those payments account? Yep, that's what I want.

Matthias Miller  34:32
So okay, so let's change the transaction. Let's change the transaction. Does it work just to change a transaction search to allow searching not just for I mean to to allow searching for multiple like both this account and

Speaker 3  34:55
yeah, I mean, if it could just stay, it would require Wire, like, a certain account for the debit and a certain account for the credit. Right? Specify, but as long as it has both accounts associated with the transaction, that would probably be the simplest.

Matthias Miller  35:21
Okay, let me

Matthias Miller  35:31
this is going to fall into Joel's core, or at least clue degree. Now, do you, I guess, and you're gonna be assuming that we don't have any. I mean, if we search by debit or credit, then we're gonna assume we don't have any reversals. At any point, right,

Unknown Speaker  35:51
that's what I'm a little afraid of doing that.

Matthias Miller  35:56
mean, I think it could be as simple as

Matthias Miller  36:05
we'll have to think it through but basically the transaction, a multi here's what we're going to do, we will probably change the search to have two multi select lists. One is match anything that's on this list. And then the other one is match everything that's on this list. And so what you would do is you would do match everything that's on this list, primary checking, and Uncategorized expense. And

Matthias Miller  36:47
and you really only need match everything on but but for the sake of I think for the sake of clarity match all of these accounts and match any of these accounts, use case on down Uncategorized expenses by Payment Type A Oh checking. Transactions also in categorized? You know, I would use this report for some end of year reconciliation that I need to do. Yeah. Hope you know clean up things that got miscategorized All right. So

Unknown Speaker  37:46
would you put both accounts in?

Matthias Miller  37:55
You are always what you would do is you'd have a search. And the search would this the search would have two prompts. The one prompt would be a multi select to select accounts where they all are required. And then the other one would be a prompt where where any of these would be required. And so you would search for all transactions that are in checking and or that have that reference the checking account and the and reference the uncategorized expense account and then it would show you a list of those transactions only within that have both that referenced both of those accounts.

Speaker 3  38:55
Thank you would list the one account in the all the other account in the any?

Matthias Miller  39:02
No, you would do both of them in the all that transactions must have all of the following accounts. It must must reference a checking account it must reference and categorize expenses.

Unknown Speaker  39:15
Yeah, okay. Makes sense.

Matthias Miller  39:21
That do that. That will do the trick for you.

Speaker 3  39:25
Yeah, I think so. I mean, this report is gonna have to show like the associated vendor field for the transaction that they feel, you know, we'll want to pull those fields in and columns in this report.

Matthias Miller  39:42
Let's see what we've got. We've got let's do that. might check me out. I pull this up. See what all this has got.

Matthias Miller  40:01
So currently would show vendor date and amount. And then it probably help if I'd be on the right year. You have another 2024 transaction out there somewhere or 2034 Is that not of time? This doesn't make sense

Matthias Miller  40:31
there we go, oh, there's something so the left pane which showed the main the right pane is filtered as well. Why is that?

Matthias Miller  40:51
That's weird. So my proposal would be it'd be split pane, you'd see the date in the contact, or the vendor, the vendor, if there's a vendor for the entire transaction. Or if all the line items have the same vendor, and then the amount and reference number and then when you select one, it would show the line items including the the line account, GL account, the line vendor, and the debit and credit amounts Okay, yeah. And so the the main thing then is

Matthias Miller  41:43
show all line items highlight rows that match criteria Okay, so we're pretty close but we need to make some changes

Matthias Miller  42:05
the fun question statement dates versus this versus some of the other things that we had

Speaker 3  42:21
that would go on we definitely have to stay with days I mean, it's it's something we'll use as soon as we have habit but we do have other less efficient options that we can use right now. So if it's I mean it could even be into January beginning of January

Matthias Miller  42:59
all right

Matthias Miller  43:12
what else what else do you guys have in your agenda

Matthias Miller  43:23
that's me thinking there was some

Unknown Speaker  43:30
memory tells me there was one thing that I had I'm drawing a blank

Unknown Speaker  43:55
well I am completely blank

Speaker 3  44:04
that multiple vendors thing that Josh working on, that's all ready to go, right. We just need to get

Speaker 2  44:14
Gosh, needs to do some. Some more. We're planning he's hoping to have something Friday. We're planning to dedicate Friday to working on that so.

Speaker 2  44:32
Yeah, I think that's all for the moment now. Messiah, do you have a different bed for the Deaf priorities called Friday morning? Do you have any? Do we just handle it like we did? Last time I put a preliminary outline together and then you add some of your thoughts to that.

Matthias Miller  45:01
yeah that's fine

Matthias Miller  45:08
it'll probably have to get to me by around noon tomorrow may be able to add anything on onto it unless it's just verbal add on on the call

Speaker 2  45:27
well if you tell me noon then it'll most likely happen then if you'd have told me for the product before

Matthias Miller  45:34
okay well

Speaker 2  45:37
middle grades there because noon in Colorado two hours later

Matthias Miller  45:45
let's let's compromise one o'clock Eastern

Speaker 2  45:59
good So Friday Where then did you have anything else to Friday we're on for reason right

Unknown Speaker  46:14
yes that's right

Speaker 2  46:23
yeah, I think that's it I don't see any reason for call the day that's the reason for call here 3d. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  46:38
Okay. I will cancel that then. And if for some oops, that's just tomorrow or today. If for some reason you need anything tomorrow, let me know. I'm thinking I'm gonna be spending a good bit of time focusing on trying to get some of these loose ends wrapped up between now and in the anniversary would have been the anniversary of Hawk so yeah, it's taller.

Unknown Speaker  47:15
Yeah, yeah. Sounds good.
