I think the other thing I would point out is that there's a story that we're saying about why people aren't coming back. And one of my favorite lines from one of the sales guys is when a lead comes in, they filled out the form for a reason. He chases them down like a debt collector, because obviously, there was a reason why he wanted to talk to him. Sure. That's a story. I mean, and, and increasingly, especially with, I mean, think about this. So selling to consumers, that's hard. They're working, you know, nine to five jobs and whatever, they're busy already in the gut, you know, soccer games, I mean, these guys don't, but you know, whatever. They got all this stuff that they got. Business owners have exactly the same problem. And a business owner who doesn't have a systemized business has the same problem. Or maybe, like 10 times worse, because if he drops the ball somewhere, that's a very expensive problem. So I would see this more as a, like, it could be worth it. It could be worth taking a look at it kind of like this. What's the story why these people don't get back to us? It's like, we're doing them a flipping from like, maybe they're not interested. Maybe it actually is a priority. And maybe they need somebody to help hold space for that priority. And be proactive and help manage the project along for them. So that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle and yeah, yeah, well
