Speaker 1  02:16
Okay, okay, okay, I am RTO contract out. I am so sick and tired of these things. But where's your but where's the Share button? Can I share?

Speaker 2  02:32
You can share. Sharing is caring. My friend. Share. Okay, I always share what I care. I uh,

Speaker 3  02:43
hold my desktops. Okay, fine, Apple, I hate you. Some days I hate you, I love you, and others. Some days I just

Speaker 1  02:57
share on this thing I get his big triangles with exclamation marks inside.

Unknown Speaker  03:05
Why? Better than?

Matthias Miller  03:07
Better than swear word bleepers?

Unknown Speaker  03:10
No, no, I don't want to sign in, all right, fine, fine.

Speaker 2  03:22
Fine. Oh, be that way at in Oh, it's just be that way.

Speaker 1  03:27
Do this? Go to your go to go to signal and and grab that test sales order that I sent to you. I don't know how to share. I'm an idiot. I should figure this out. I don't feel like figuring it out the

Speaker 2  03:40
moment. Share. Share it. Okie dokie,

Speaker 3  03:45
good to RTO. Info, you know, what's you know, what's better about today? Info, I have an even bigger TV,

Matthias Miller  03:52
really, man, next time I talk, you could have like a back in your scrollsy downsies. Scrollsy downsies. Okay, keep the scrolls and look at it. Look at that. Look at that. That's a thing of beauty. Come on, man, get a genius. You are

Speaker 1  04:10
okay. But why? Why can't I put the macro center in the chart, in the table, be center? They won't center on the contract.

Matthias Miller  04:17
You can't center tables. You can put, put a hidden column on the left here, I'll help you put a hidden column on the left. Okay, white, white borders. Where's the macro?

Speaker 1  04:31
Go into it's Loc, Loc, NY, EPO table.

Matthias Miller  04:37
Okay, it should be Loc, if it's global. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  04:41
Well, sorry, change the name, then

Matthias Miller  04:48
it's gonna break your contract. I know. I'll

Unknown Speaker  04:51
go fix the contract. Okay?

Speaker 3  04:59
It. Shouldn't be look, if it's local, look, oh, so that's what log stands for.

Matthias Miller  05:04
Local. Yeah, you're gonna have to change it. You change it when you I have to edit the contract. You have to take it out of the contract, then Save, then I can rename, then you can put it

Speaker 1  05:13
back in. Get out of there. Get out of there. Let me what I have this.

Matthias Miller  05:19
I mean, just in the template. Just go in the template. What template it is? Oh, I'm sorry, the New York Okay, NT.

Speaker 1  05:30
Okay. How about this? How about I just take it out of the out of here for the moment. Okay.

Speaker 3  05:38
Now, can you edit it? If I took it out of the table, out of the thing that you should be able

Speaker 2  05:46
to, yep, put it back in, okay, and then assign

Matthias Miller  05:52
the left spacer equals under 50, which I don't know what it is. So this is formatted cell.

Speaker 2  05:59
I'm breaking space, V left spacer. We don't care about alignment, don't care about background color, don't care about and then, white, white, white, white.

Matthias Miller  06:15
And let's do this as Actually, let's do this as v left space or sell.

Speaker 1  06:22
Oh, and by the way, in order to make the thing work, needed to be V monthly payment, comma, V E, P O, to make it work correctly, that I put it, I put it in V E, P O, comma, V, monthly payment. For whatever reason, it gave me some wildly wacky numbers,

Speaker 2  06:38
V, P O, comma, V, monthly pay AND your max, yeah, that shouldn't make a difference.

Unknown Speaker  06:48
I don't know. Okay, all

Matthias Miller  06:52
right, let's see what it says.

Speaker 1  06:53
That's what I thought, too. And I was just like, I was scratching my head so badly.

Matthias Miller  06:58
Okay, so now let's go generate the PDF. Yes, it no longer parses.

Matthias Miller  07:07
Oh, we have to regenerate it. How do we regenerate

Speaker 3  07:10
it? Hit, the hit, the Calculate scrolls you to the top. Sees, calculate twice,

Speaker 1  07:19
click, Save, actually. You don't need to say it actually well,

Matthias Miller  07:23
but I want to see it on the PDF, because that's really what matters. Further, you know, it needs to go over like, a

Unknown Speaker  07:31
little bit. See more. Z's

Unknown Speaker  07:34
more. Z's more. Z's

Matthias Miller  07:37
New York, EPO, okay. It needs to go over like, let's see it maybe an inch, which is about 72 points, which is about 225, you know, you're really geeky when you translate between points and inches.

Matthias Miller  08:01
Actually, oh, my goodness, that was too much.

Speaker 1  08:04
Go back and read it while you're gonna regenerate again anyway, because I sent it the other things too.

Matthias Miller  08:08
So now it's gonna be, let's try closer to 200 I'm

Unknown Speaker  08:25
Wait, why is it? Why is why did

Unknown Speaker  08:29
just the hair over there's, yeah, it's the wording is center,

Matthias Miller  08:34
let's go like 195 talk about just what is this local dealer tag stuff?

Unknown Speaker  08:43
I don't know. Oh, it's, it's bomb roll stuff that

Speaker 1  08:50
I gotta tell you. A funny comment this morning, Josh was lamenting. He said, I way under bid at this project, every project that includes Aaron, from now long I'm charging three times the value. Oh, good, gracious. It just cracked me up.

Unknown Speaker  09:11
Look at there now I get to play around with formatting. And

Matthias Miller  09:15
your state has an indentation that it's centering, or your date,

Speaker 1  09:18
I know something has an indentation, I know, and

Matthias Miller  09:23
your signature is, Oh, there's one on each page. That's why Look at you go, man, it's like you have a

Unknown Speaker  09:36
it's like we have custom software.

Matthias Miller  09:38
You could, we could fix the spelling on reference if you wanted to where.

Unknown Speaker  09:52
How about that. How about that,

Unknown Speaker  09:55
Okay, how about this. How about you regenerate. All right.

Matthias Miller  10:00
Let me go regenerate, sir, it's gonna go top off my tea. Let's regenerate.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Oops, regenerative. So

Matthias Miller  10:18
look at that. That's fixed, and that's fixed. Look at that. That's the thing of beauty. Man, that's just cool. Does Artio pro let you do this? Remind me,

Speaker 1  10:30
gosh, no, can you I told Lee Ann, I said, You know what this is? Just, there is no other software out there that lets us do this kind of stuff. We just, we generated a table inside of a document that needed to be there based on a macro that that just, this is custom software.

Speaker 2  10:51
It what on a platform, though, like a legit platform,

Speaker 1  10:58
that the user can go off and build a macro that you can drop into a template that would actually do this kind of thing. Is insanity.

Matthias Miller  11:08
Do you want to hear my latest brainchild?

Speaker 1  11:10
There's, is there? Is there no way that we can make this somehow be all well, I guess if we, if we stuck this somehow, I need to figure out to get this all on one page,

Matthias Miller  11:20
the whole chart. Well, why wouldn't you do why wouldn't you do the chart in two

Unknown Speaker  11:23
columns? I don't know how to do that. Well, I

Unknown Speaker  11:29
do it. Shall I help you a little bit?

Unknown Speaker  11:33
Listen,

Speaker 1  11:35
you just need to get a curtain so that we can put you behind it and call you the wizard behind the curtain. Your company. Listen, you should have not called yourself. What do you call it? Code house. You should have called it wizard house. Wizard house. Code wizard, no. Wizards. Wizards are supported.

Matthias Miller  11:56
Supported wizards. You know, I thought, I thought tagline should probably have been something like software that doesn't make you curse, or something like that software that won't make you curse.

Unknown Speaker  12:12
So let's do I'm trying

Matthias Miller  12:16
to think that. Let me give me one minute to think through the easiest way to do this, I think here, let's do this,

Matthias Miller  12:30
range array, 1v Months, assign V cells equals this that substitute items

Matthias Miller  12:51
and then this is no spacer cell.

Unknown Speaker  12:57
And then here we have months divided by two,

Matthias Miller  13:07
we have B spacer cell, B left spacer cell, which is going to have to be more like 25 or something plus B cells, dot,

Unknown Speaker  13:21
item at

Unknown Speaker  13:29
this whole array thing is a fairly new thing on the platform, isn't

Matthias Miller  13:32
it? Yeah, it's, it's brand spanking new shiny wheels and everything.

Speaker 1  13:36
I mean, it is, I keep seeing it appear all over the place all of a sudden. So who's who was the brainchild behind the array

Matthias Miller  13:47
stuff? It's been in the works for a while. I mean, Josh's team was the one who implemented it.

Matthias Miller  13:59
That's crazy. But structures are the other cool thing. What's the

Unknown Speaker  14:07
difference between array and a structure?

Matthias Miller  14:09
A structure is okay. An array is just a list of a list of things, of the same thing, number, a list of numbers, a list of strings, a list of Booleans, whatever right structure is a conglomerate of label objects. It's almost like a database table, except it's available in expressions. It always has the same format. So a the classic programming learned programming is you have a car structure and it has four properties, make model year make a model is a string. Year is a number, etc. Color, left index, plus B cells, dot item at the right index. And then this is a. I assign V What do you call these? V content cells? Assign the header cells. Let's just do this.

Speaker 1  15:19
Oh, by the way, talk with Josh this morning. He's, he's, he want, he'd be interested in helping with the tax jar stuff. He said, Send details.

Speaker 2  15:29
Okay, we need to let,

Matthias Miller  15:35
we need to let Seth know that Jonathan or Seth know, to let Jonathan know that

Speaker 1  15:43
I let Seth know to let Jonathan know, to let Josh know what the details are.

Matthias Miller  15:47
No that well. I mean, first of all, that

Unknown Speaker  15:50
need an array table for that one.

Speaker 3  15:57
Okay, so Jonathan should have gotten a contact from the from explore pay

Speaker 4  16:05
yesterday, I need to message him, see if he got if they reached out to him.

Unknown Speaker  16:13
That was a fun conversation yesterday.

Matthias Miller  16:17
Okay, besides the spacing being off and the numbers being wrong, it looks pretty good. So we need to go. We need to go, let's try, like, I don't know what this should be, 100 and let's do the minus one is wrong. Why

Matthias Miller  16:48
is there only 47 Oh, there's not. What are you talking about? Okay, it needs to go over like five pixels or five points. Maybe, I don't know what it is, 105, yeah, see, it has to validate twice because of that stupid thing.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
Dumb, dumb, dumb. How

Speaker 2  17:18
do you like me? Now look at that. Do you want a space between them?

Unknown Speaker  17:29
I don't know. Let me see it.

Speaker 2  17:42
This would be 100 this would be 10. This would be the center, center spacer. So,

Unknown Speaker  18:00
are you a Joe Rogan guy ever?

Unknown Speaker  18:03
Oh yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:06
there's he said some fast there was a guy on a while back who spent seven years in solitary confinement and came out saying, which I thought was just unbelievable. It's been a while I actually looked him up.

Unknown Speaker  18:23
But can you imagine? No, I cannot. Speaking

Matthias Miller  18:29
of space yourselves, that's what triggered the idea of the thought, see, there's a reason to my randomness. Well, okay, besides, oh, well, that's what's wrong. It would help if I put it in the right place.

Speaker 1  18:55
It was funny. So talking with the with the lady from explore pay yesterday and that, I guess they have to take these kinds of things through some sort of leadership team meeting to make sure everybody's on board for bringing on, you know, I guess a partner. I guess I would be, I'll be a partner type company. Now go back to what you had before. Actually skip the spacer scales a cell and then, and she's like, Yeah, everybody's really excited about the fact that another software platform is coming online and hopefully keeping the clients that we have with us. Yeah, you would think,

Matthias Miller  19:31
Oh, like, the people jumping ship, that the people jumping ship, that are being

Speaker 1  19:35
forced to jump ship, and it's like, oh, wait, somebody's building a software that can that'll potentially keep you know our clients, the current clients, with us, rather than making them leave? Yeah, we're excited

Matthias Miller  19:48
about bringing you Exactly. How do we support you better? Exactly? That's awesome, man, that's that's a nice open door. Okay, I don't get why the Oh, I didn't. Did I recalculate? Obviously, not. No, I didn't. I also fixed the dumb black border on the top.

Unknown Speaker  20:12
Look at that. You happy? I'm

Unknown Speaker  20:16
happy. Should be.

Speaker 1  20:19
Look at that. We can now be New York compliant.

Unknown Speaker  20:26
I don't understand,

Speaker 1  20:27
understand these states that would write a legislation that says specifically that the EPO cannot be less than one month of rent. Oh, I'm sorry, 47 and 48 comes out to like, half a payment in 47 and zero and 48 like, I don't know what to tell you. Why do I have to force the customer to pay $311 in the last three months?

Matthias Miller  20:51
That's just dumb. Why can't it's just dumb.

Unknown Speaker  20:55
You know? I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
I look at that.

Unknown Speaker  21:11
Okay, let's do some work.

Speaker 3  21:14
Okay, let me, is Seth jumping on? Does he need to be on?

Unknown Speaker  21:19
That's my knowledge. But

Unknown Speaker  21:20
Did we answer all these questions?

Matthias Miller  21:25
Okay, is there? Let's see.

Speaker 2  21:29
Let's just ask him Seth or anything from here.

Matthias Miller  21:36
Okay, well, here's a question you've been

Unknown Speaker  21:37
working on RTO spec, when you debug an AR report for Drew as a bridge. Oh, this is good. Something not RTO,

Matthias Miller  21:51
alright. So when you go debug the zfp AR report for, oh, it never might well I was that's not always trying to read sales tax, if you have a building located in North Carolina, what's a good state? Well, let's just say North Carolina, and customer a is in Virginia, and Customer B is in South Carolina.

Unknown Speaker  22:17
What tax rate do you use

Speaker 1  22:18
location? Well, okay, it depends on the state, whether they are destination or or sale location. Most states anymore are destination based. And so that is probably something we should probably know. We should, we should. We should always the physical address on the contact record should always be building location, and that is what we should base it on, unless, and I guess we're, I guess we're gonna have to handle this. I don't know how we handle this. I does texture automatically give you point of location, sale

Matthias Miller  22:57
location. I don't shipping. That's what I was wondering. I know there's a way to here.

Speaker 1  23:05
That's we, we're gonna have to handle that, because there are states, I think, like Tennessee or or somewhere Ohio, Ohio is a non destination based sale location, and so, or, sorry, a non destination based location. So that means we would have to handle, I don't know what would we have to handle, the dealer location,

Unknown Speaker  23:27
probably so you have from to and then you

Matthias Miller  23:40
would have a customer with The Customer ID that has a customer location.

Unknown Speaker  23:59
Or here,

Matthias Miller  24:07
here and the from would be the from is optional, I suppose, right or no. Do we need to specify from what's from the source location?

Unknown Speaker  24:23
Where it shipped from,

Speaker 1  24:31
maybe, wow, this is a piece I did not think through

Unknown Speaker  24:41
what that what that means is that

Speaker 1  24:45
we would have, we really should validate all dealership addresses so that we can ping off of them, if a as a from location, and let tax jar based on that. I guess, I guess it's okay. Here's the question, here's the sales tax question. I Let's okay. For the sake of stupidity, Ohio is a, is a? Is it based on sale? Okay? No. Let me back. Let me ask my question. I buy a building in Ohio and I deliver it to North Carolina. North Carolina is a destination sales a sales tax, a destination sales tax state and Ohio is a sale based state who gets tax who gets tax priority.

Matthias Miller  25:57
Searchie searchie, searchie searchie,

Unknown Speaker  26:05
okay, so ship to you.

Speaker 1  26:28
Okay, so, yeah, it would be North Carolina, which would be destination based. So, so, so probably what we need to do is feed. I don't know how you want to set this up, but essentially what we need to do is in some way, either tax jar determines, or we determine whether the state that the building is landing in is a destination or a sales location, and then based on that, it's either that or you feed you feed tax jar both the from and the and the And the physical address, and let TaxJar tell you which one it is. I don't know what is that. Is that how the from and tube works?

Matthias Miller  27:07
Okay, so, but then within the same state, you have this issue. If they live in Apple Creek And they deliver it to Columbus,

Unknown Speaker  27:50
hang on,

Matthias Miller  28:25
it, unless delivery occurs by the seller or the seller arranges delivery, if it picks up or raises their own Sure.

Unknown Speaker  28:36
What does this mean? This

Matthias Miller  28:41
makes it sound like Ohio is destination based if you arranged, if the seller arranges delivery, which is the case.

Speaker 1  28:57
Okay, but all of these scenarios with theory, theoretically be handled by TaxJar to tell us which one it should be. Would it not? So? In other words, if we give it the from and we give it the location, we don't need to worry about the bill to do we? Do

Matthias Miller  29:15
you care about the customer location? That's what I'm

Speaker 1  29:19
saying. The bill to I don't think the bill two matters. I think it's either from or destination. Is it not from or to? Yeah. So if we, if we always except for, except for, the reason

Matthias Miller  29:29
why you want to give a customer is for exemption purposes. Do what the reason, the reason to give a customer is for exemption purposes. Or we need to give an exemption code.

Unknown Speaker  29:42
What exemption are you

Matthias Miller  29:43
like, wholesale versus type of type

Unknown Speaker  29:46
of exemption, which is another

Speaker 1  29:54
thing we're going to have to handle, and where we're going to handle this is if something is sales tax exempt.

Matthias Miller  29:59
Yeah, but is that on a per contract basis, or is that on

Unknown Speaker  30:06
a, I'm assuming, be per contract basis?

Speaker 1  30:19
I mean, we simply could put on the on the contract, okay, one thing at a time,

Unknown Speaker  30:26
fair. Well,

Matthias Miller  30:31
in this case, it sounds like from and to would be the

Speaker 2  30:38
would be the logical that means that we have to require, we have to require dealer

Speaker 1  30:45
or manufacturer or the manufacturer as a dealer. In other words, I guess, I guess we would say we'd have to require dealership on on every building

Unknown Speaker  30:55
in order to feed a from and a two

Unknown Speaker  31:25
Oh, my goodness,

Matthias Miller  31:28
simplify the tax code please.

Speaker 1  31:33
This is, this is literally why, like companies, like tax jar, exist. Yep.

Matthias Miller  31:48
Well, what's the verdict? Verdict is we have to, we have to have dealer addresses,

Speaker 1  31:53
I think so. And if you buy it directly from a manufacturer, we need to have a manufacturer. I guess you have to have a dealership record for the manufacturer.

Matthias Miller  32:01
It also means that tax rates we can't de duplicate per contact, like it's not. I mean, it doesn't make sense to store it on the con. I don't know. I guess you would calculate it one time per dealer that they have an active contract for. I guess that would make sense.

Speaker 1  32:20
I mean, you can store it on the contract record. You're, you're going to pull the address from the primary contact record, the primary customer on the from the from the primary contact. You're going to pull the dealership address from the dealership assigned on the product record, and you're going to feed both of those in as a to and from and let TaxJar decide where you what your tax rate or your tax nexus should be.

Unknown Speaker  32:50
So let's go, which

Speaker 1  32:51
means that we have to require, well, okay, we two things. We have to require that you have a dealership on on every building. Secondary thing is, how do we require? How do we make sure that the addresses on the dealerships are correct?

Speaker 1  33:32
And does that does that mean that we should allow for duplicate types on a on an organizational record, allowing someone to be both a manufacturer and a dealer

Unknown Speaker  33:47
not duplicate types, more than one

Unknown Speaker  33:48
type, more than one type, I don't know,

Speaker 1  33:54
or do you, or do we force them to go off and create a dealership record for the same manufacturer?

Matthias Miller  33:58
We that's what we had talked about. But I don't know if that, if you want that,

Speaker 1  34:06
I don't know how obnoxious is it to allow, to allow more than one type on contact record.

Matthias Miller  34:15
We need to think it through a little bit. I

Matthias Miller  34:23
death. How bad is it to allow multiple contact types you

Speaker 1  34:29
should just haven't come join us for this conversation. I

Speaker 1  35:00
Say I do like my big TV back again. I feel like I spend most of my time working like this, though, with my head cocked up.

Matthias Miller  35:07
Yeah, that's the bad thing on my on my like, I don't know, I like leaning on my desk and stuff, and then I look dorky, because

Speaker 1  35:14
I should make it. I should make some sort of, do you remember a long, long, long time ago when, when they, like, these people came up with a zany idea where they're going to take a computer monitor and, like, embed it into the desk at an angle. So, like, you look down through the Have you ever seen one of these, like a big old CRT like, like, embedded down, and you look down through a piece of glass, and your your your head was always, supposedly, in a natural position. We should, I should figure out how to do that with a big old TV screen like this, not that particular thing, but lower, the lower, the actual location of the TV monitor without blocking it by the desk.

Matthias Miller  35:49
I think what you need is a if you had four webcams, one on each side, surely with AI, you could de duplicate to create a front facing image. What if you had a camera at the top, bottom, left and right of your screen? Surely that's enough data that AI could generate, generated as if you were directly looking at the camera.

Unknown Speaker  36:17
Oh, you're saying for like zoom calls,

Unknown Speaker  36:19
for like zoom calls, Oh, gotcha.

Speaker 1  36:23
Okay, that could be, I know I've seen, I've seen your center cam thing, but I hate dumb thing hanging down in the middle. But you know what? That's That's it like, so on a TV like this, it really should, you should have, like, a camera, a camera, a camera and a camera four can't on all four sides of the TV and that that generates a composite. Yeah. What

Matthias Miller  36:55
combinations are you wanting to jump

Unknown Speaker  36:57
on here so that we can talk this through? I am

Matthias Miller  37:01
somewhat trying to protect his time, but I mean validating that the okay, but on the dealerships, why can't you just wait until your pings fail and you go figure out why the ping fails? You're like, oh, the dealer address is wrong, I suppose. Because you might have to repay a whole bunch of them.

Unknown Speaker  37:26
Yeah, that gets obnoxious.

Speaker 1  37:30
You're saying, wait, wait, you're saying, you're saying, if we don't validate addresses on the on the organization record.

Matthias Miller  37:39
I mean, what's the, what's the

Unknown Speaker  37:44
what is the I mean? Granted, we can

Speaker 1  37:48
the simplest and easiest form of this is to say, go create an organization record for every for every manufacturer, or, sorry, a dealership record for every manufacturer. But then we have to deal with the duplicate thing and making sure that

Matthias Miller  38:02
works too. What duplicate thing? Well, duplicate name. When we have a duplicate name issue, no, because you'll assign a unique ID to each one, which means that you could have a two point backyards, number 123, and a two point backyards number 456, and one's the manufacturer and one's the

Speaker 1  38:19
dealer. Okay, so then the name could be duplicated. So then, yeah, okay. So, hmm. So then,

Speaker 1  38:32
why don't we just force them to, like, forget the duplicate type or multiple types, I don't know. I keep saying duplicate, forget the multiple multiple types, and let's just make let's just make them go create A secondary record.

Unknown Speaker  38:47
I agree

Unknown Speaker  38:52
that keeps things simpler.

Unknown Speaker  38:58
Okay? Okay,

Matthias Miller  39:17
good. Good, good, good. So we need to require addresses on dealers. We think we're moving this to and this is only

Speaker 1  39:35
the you need to require address on dealer, and you need to have a require a dealership on a product.

Unknown Speaker  39:50
And that allows us to always feed the to and from. What

Matthias Miller  39:55
if it shifts from the manufacturer?

Speaker 3  39:58
Doesn't matter. Oh, you know, at some point you can't chase every rabbit.

Speaker 1  40:09
I don't even know that. We would know that it shipped from the manufacturer.

Matthias Miller  40:16
That's fair well, the seller arranges. Yeah. I mean, at what point do you really care? I don't know. I mean, well, I

Matthias Miller  40:29
don't think we do. I think the question is, at what point does the state ever care?

Unknown Speaker  40:33
Why would they ever care

Unknown Speaker  40:37
whose day the state?

Matthias Miller  40:42
That's the only reason. Why this is even a conversation. If

Speaker 1  40:45
you can prove due diligence that you said, Okay, we stored the manufacturer, we stored but we store the manufacturer, we stored the dealership. And the paper came to us and said it was this dealership. It didn't say that they shipped it from the manufacturer. Sorry, I'll go fix it. Now. Would you like me to fix it gladly? I'll gladly pay, you know the right person the right sales tax.

Unknown Speaker  41:08
File an amendment,

Unknown Speaker  41:10
exactly. So, yeah, do

Matthias Miller  41:24
I don't know what he means by this.

Unknown Speaker  41:46
So in

Matthias Miller  41:47
we could have multiple

Speaker 1  42:06
um, can is it? Is it legal to change the name of billing and physical to billing and building address or no physical address? Uh, no, let's just leave physical address. That's fine, because we might not always be selling buildings.

Unknown Speaker  42:26
I mean, product location,

Speaker 1  42:28
nah, okay. Can, can you change rental location? Can you take change the address type on a contact record? Or is that locked? Like, is that like platform

Matthias Miller  42:37
locked? Well, I mean, we can, we can. I mean, we could.

Speaker 1  42:41
We can add it, but if we add it, then I don't want to show physical because then somebody's going to be confused.

Matthias Miller  42:48
Let's try something address types so we could probably, I don't know how we use it. I don't know how in depth it is.

Speaker 1  43:02
Let me see. I mean, obviously you can add product location, but then we don't like, we don't want to have confusion between product location and physical location and

Matthias Miller  43:09
physical Give me. Give me. Give me. If you can wait, you can hold your horses 30 seconds. Sorry, hey, that was a

Unknown Speaker  43:26
them. So many function

Matthias Miller  43:31
contacts, all right, so we got the

Matthias Miller  43:39
list address types, address types, where do these address types come from?

Unknown Speaker  43:46
Look in for client code, zrt,

Matthias Miller  43:54
address type, silver and contact. Oh, those are even customized to us. Even better.

Speaker 2  44:03
We can call it whatever you want. Hey, they are yours.

Unknown Speaker  44:08
Yppity, Product location. What

Matthias Miller  44:18
if they have multiple products in multiple locations? Multiple contracts in multiple places. I'm a landlord, and I got them all in all my lots or my houses.

Matthias Miller  44:40
See, you don't like me now, do you contracts?

Matthias Miller  44:58
Not unless we give you. A drop down to select Billing location. Here,

Unknown Speaker  45:11
a drop down to what now.

Speaker 1  45:16
So what you would have, you would have multiple addresses on the contact record, and you could define which one you want to have as part of the primary contact is

Speaker 4  45:25
that what you're saying, sorry, what were you, I don't understand what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  45:29
You were saying about a drop down.

Matthias Miller  45:40
Yeah, you have a drop down of all the possible addresses from all the customers, and it copies it onto here.

Speaker 1  45:47
So, so what are you saying you would have, you would have is the list. Is the list for addresses on a contact record, user editable. So you could add product Location One, product location two, product location three. So you could,

Matthias Miller  46:11
I'm not. I feel like I'm I don't know why you would do that. That's the bottom line.

Speaker 1  46:16
And contact record with with many contracts that in many different locations.

Unknown Speaker  46:23
Like, why would you?

Matthias Miller  46:26
Why do you need anything but mailing address on the on the contact record? Like, shouldn't the building have the physical look? It doesn't. Shouldn't the contract have the physical location of the building with an option to copy it from the customer. Oh, address.

Speaker 3  46:43
Oh. So, okay. So, by default, so, so,

Matthias Miller  46:52
when you select a customer, we will copy the address from the customer onto the contract as the build. No, we will not. We will say building address is required. There's a little checkbox that says, copy address. It has customer mailing address mid building location, customer address mailing location, and then a checkbox it says building is at the customer's address or something like that, and it copies it in

Speaker 1  47:17
there. Okay. But then, can we get rid of, can we get rid of the functionality to add a secondary address to the to the contact record, because that would be kind of, well, maybe no, no, no, no. But then, but then we name it, no.

Matthias Miller  47:32
I mean, we don't need the then we don't need the address types at all. I mean, sure, if you want to add six addresses, who cares? That's your problem. Yeah,

Speaker 1  47:39
you're right. But, here's, but here's the thing, if, if you, if you have six addresses on the contact record, and you say you check the box to copy across, which one's it going to copy?

Matthias Miller  47:49
Well, okay, then then you have an address drop list, okay,

Speaker 1  47:57
that populates it. And if you don't check the box, and you're required to fill in an address.

Matthias Miller  48:01
Yeah, and if it's blank, then you fill in the address. Does the

Speaker 1  48:04
platform have any validation, any way to auto validate addresses? I think the answer is no.

Matthias Miller  48:10
We can. We have, we have played a round with Google Maps geocoding as an address validator, but not and it would come back, like, in a to do report, or, like, some kind of No,

Unknown Speaker  48:26
just know that someday you guys should, you really should do that.

Matthias Miller  48:29
I don't disagree. It's like, you start

Unknown Speaker  48:32
typing an address and it starts populating.

Matthias Miller  48:35
We have, I don't, I don't want to go find it, but Okay, so, so contact changes, changes. Hinges, remove address types.

Speaker 1  48:44
No, you don't have to remove address types. Just it can be, I mean, then just leave it physical and mailing like having physical, that's fine. Let's keep, let's keep that there

Matthias Miller  48:57
under the primary and secondary customer add drop list of all primary And secondary customer addresses

Speaker 2  49:18
with a other just another option.

Matthias Miller  49:32
Street, city, state, zip fields to the building.

Speaker 1  49:56
Uh, wait, why would? Why do we even need a checkbox at all to copy? It across, like, literally, it's a drop list. And then,

Matthias Miller  50:04
huh, yeah, then you don't need it. But you can also put a custom one in. If you want

Speaker 1  50:09
to go, put all your go, put all of your, your address over there in the contact record. If there's a drop list there, you can go, you know, you can, well,

Matthias Miller  50:15
okay, I have an idea. See if you like this one. So we keep the physical. We rename physical the product location, and then we have an add address button, yeah, that runs the next 30 and updates the contract, which means if you're editing it in the current in the contract entry form, is going to give you trouble, so maybe you don't want to do that, but basically, what you're saying is you have to enter the product location. You have to enter you have to enter it as a location on the See, that just feels really weird to me, but

Speaker 1  50:46
this is what I'm saying. Here's here's what I'm attempting to say, I'm going to say, and then you tell me if I'm just nuts. Okay, addresses should be entered on the contact record. Address, 1-234-567-8910, I don't care how many you put over there. Add a name to the drop list of types. I don't care, whatever. But when you assign the primary contact on the contract it, it brings all of those into a drop list, and then you just choose which one you want,

Matthias Miller  51:15
okay? And then if you change the address on the contact, does it update the contract address as well?

Unknown Speaker  51:20
No,

Matthias Miller  51:23
so then why do you have to enter it over there in the first place? That's the

Speaker 1  51:26
weird thing, because you might have 10 addresses on on the contact record, and you might have 10 different contracts in 10 different places, and so you want a different address on the contract for each one of those, why

Matthias Miller  51:38
don't we just belong through all their different addresses and conglomerate them all together based on all together based on all the contracts that you have everywhere. Like it seems backwards to me. What it see this is what? This is the stuff that makes software hard to use. In order to add the address to the product or to the contract, I have to go, add it to the contact first, put it in, save it, go back to the contract, find it in the list, select it. Okay, fine, I'm done. All right, so why not just say rather than, I mean, can we add a virtual RG to say building locations that has the addresses of all their buildings, wherever they might happen to be, I mean, that can be under contracts. RG, for all I care, we could show the full location address. And can we just give them a quick way to select an address, and if that's not the right one, that they can enter it straight onto the under the contract, because we don't want it to update when the contact changes. There's no real value. And if we want to, the droplets can include all of the addresses from all of their current and past contracts, if That's helpful.

Unknown Speaker  52:54
I don't know. Man, I'm so confused now.

Unknown Speaker  53:15
What are you confused about?

Speaker 1  53:21
Okay, part of me wants to say, Okay, this is part of me wants to say, you have a mailing and physical on the contact record, okay? And there's a checkbox on the contract record that says, copy physical address from contact record. If you check it, it copies it over. If it, if you don't check it, then you're, you're required to add one on the contact on the contract record.

Matthias Miller  53:48
And can you only have one physical address per customer? Yeah. Well, that sounds I'm happy with that.

Speaker 1  54:00
I mean, that keeps it drop dead simple, and that way, that way, if that checkbox is checked and you go, change the physical address on the contact record, it auto updates the contract.

Unknown Speaker  54:18
I mean, it

Speaker 1  54:31
I mean, tell me, tell me that's that's clunky. This is one of these things where it's like it could it it needs to work nicely or it feels clunky.

Speaker 4  55:44
The addresses. Releases addresses, okay.

Speaker 3  55:56
I mean, does that? Does that resolve the clunky feeling.

Unknown Speaker  56:03
I'm happy with that.

Speaker 1  56:10
Well, how about this? How about by default? We check, we check the box true by default, so that when you, when you enter the physical address on the contact record, by default, it just links up. And if you go, Well, wait, but that's not the address that the building is actually located some other location, then you got to go over there and uncheck it and go into the one you want.

Matthias Miller  56:31
What it means is that if you have multiple contracts with a customer, and you add a new contract and you change your physical address, then we should have a warning if you change it, saying that, see, that's where the linking thing. But he also the opposite problem. They move location. They move 10 buildings. Well,

Speaker 1  57:06
yeah, well, that's where, that's where we could get into this idea of caching the address by an X 30 over onto the contract record. Well, if we would just

Matthias Miller  57:19
if, when you select it, if this, if the checkbox would just be a copy, not a link. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1  57:28
And if you unchecked it and rechecked it, it would recopy the physical address, yeah, okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  57:35
it could even be a button.

Unknown Speaker  57:39
I'm okay with that. I like that better,

Matthias Miller  57:50
dude. Okay, now that we're getting so sticking close to what I proposed

Speaker 1  57:54
probably just because I was too stupid to understand what you were saying. Well,

Matthias Miller  57:59
I mean, there's the potential for that. The other potential is that I'm such a terrible explainer, I wouldn't I don't know that

Speaker 1  58:05
there's only one thing that I can control in this conversation is that is my ability to understand. So I can't control your ability to communicate.

Unknown Speaker  58:12
Well, that's fair.

Matthias Miller  58:15
I also can't control your ability to come how do you give passive aggressive insults you have you ever heard

Unknown Speaker  58:24
anything where it's like, I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you?

Unknown Speaker  58:30
Exactly, dude. Dude.

Matthias Miller  58:38
This is so awesome. This is unrelated. Add moment manufacturing, client just rolled out their incentive program four. Oh, he's pallet manufacturing, and these guys are are looking to get a 10% raise. Just anyway, it's just glorious. I um, the primary and secondary customer, city, state and zip, add a button called Copy.

Unknown Speaker  59:09
What is Seth? Asking?

Matthias Miller  59:13
Seth, what do it KS. KS product, latest contract field. Can the latest contract ever be a future one. That's a great question.

Unknown Speaker  59:24
What does he mean by a future one?

Matthias Miller  59:27
Do you have a if you have a contract that hasn't been if you have a contract that's not been active yet, it's pending delivery, or, I don't know what it's got a future start date? Okay? Would that be considered the latest one?

Unknown Speaker  59:47
Well, then I guess we should say latest and latest active product.

Speaker 1  1:00:01
I know it should be late product, latest, active contract macro, if it's it's a future one that feels like, Well, I mean, I What if

Matthias Miller  1:00:16
we had, like a contract,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:19
pending product?

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
Pending contract field, product, latest closed contract field and

Speaker 1  1:00:48
well, unless, unless you, unless you made in a sign function inside the macro that asked for the status of the contract. So I like that one, yeah, let's, let's, let's ask for the Assign in the in the in the let's, let's ask for the the status in the Assign.

Speaker 1  1:01:19
Yeah, uh huh. What do you mean by blank? For all,

Matthias Miller  1:01:31
if you pass in a blank status, it just the latest of any status.

Speaker 1  1:01:36
So how would you do that? Inside the parenthesis would be required, wouldn't it?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:40
Yeah, you just do quote, quote,

Speaker 1  1:01:44
Oh, got it. So you're saying parentheses, quote, quote, Oh, got it. Okay. I didn't know you can do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
We don't. We don't require. No list field is ever required.

Speaker 1  1:01:57
So if I say building has item and I just do quote, quote, you're telling me, it's gonna what give me all

Matthias Miller  1:02:03
items. Yeah, probably not. It's really gonna give you nothing. It depends how it's written. Okay? Like you would have to have a you'd have to rewrite this as

Speaker 1  1:02:16
I get what you're saying now I get Okay, got it?

Speaker 3  1:02:21
Yeah, I like that. I like that a lot. Latest product, all you know, and you can pass in, can you Well, I guess, I guess you could

Speaker 1  1:02:33
the expression would be, you could do an in expression, and you could pass in multiple statuses. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
it's blank you look at, you do look at start date first, and then entry date, right. If, what's blank, if, the start if, the if, if you're looking at blank, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
Sure, that makes sense.

Matthias Miller  1:03:15
So do you want to be able to do a

Unknown Speaker  1:03:19
pipe list but still have blank equal,

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
you lose some list validation. That's the issue. If that, if you're that advanced, what you should do is pass in blank and use if expressions, I just don't.

Speaker 2  1:03:39
Tell me I'm wrong. You're right. Thank you. You're right. You failed me. I told you to tell me I'm wrong.

Speaker 1  1:03:50
This stuff gets me giddy. I don't know why I told Leanne yesterday. I said, we have to have humor, otherwise this stuff just becomes painstakingly boring.

Matthias Miller  1:03:59
It's a coping mechanism. It is a coping mechanism. Oh, here is a here is a great thing. Great quote for podcast episode to be recorded, not next week, but the week after

Matthias Miller  1:04:16
detoxing from fixing people. Okay, with the caveat that not having experienced this, this is Kevin's quote. Kevin has not experienced this, but best he can describe it, detoxing from fixing people is the same as detoxing from a heroin addiction.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42
Well, that's bit personality dependent.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:47
That's fair. I don't disagree.

Speaker 1  1:04:54
I can I can conceptually understand it. I don't think I've ever experienced.

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
You never had that compulsion, no, but I mean, then again, you never had somebody come to you not looking for advice and felt compelled to tell them what to do.

Speaker 1  1:05:12
Oh, I'll just tell them what to do. And it comes naturally. And I just, that's the last, I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16
move on. Yeah, it's, it's much more externally

Speaker 1  1:05:20
processed and on the face than it is than it is to be internally processed and ruminated on. Makes sense,

Matthias Miller  1:05:32
all right, so I don't know exactly what he means. Let me ask him, does my response make sense? I am so lazy in my typing these days, look at the building address instead of the customer. We need the dealership. Plus, should we? Should we freeze the dealer location at the time of sale

Speaker 4  1:06:02
and contract creation cash, the cash, the address on the contract, on the con contract,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:07
yeah, based on the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
time of sale, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:14
yeah, probably so.

Speaker 1  1:06:21
But if, if per chance, I don't know. Why would this ever happen? If per chance, you woke up one day and figured out that you were you had the completely wrong address for this dealership. How would you update it? Admin.

Matthias Miller  1:06:35
Could update it, and then it would. Here's the crazy thing. I don't know if you want to do this, but it could theoretically rejigger and recalculate all of your history and reassign all that stuff to another jurisdiction.

Speaker 1  1:06:52
Well, okay, now why wouldn't? Why wouldn't we just, why wouldn't we warn on the dealership record if you could ever go change the address and say changing this address may significantly impact sales tax calculations.

Matthias Miller  1:07:07
I guess we would only ever do it going forward.

Speaker 1  1:07:10
If they go change it, it's kind of like buyer be warned. You were you were warned. I

Speaker 1  1:07:20
it, because it would be, it would be really nice to be able to go over there change like you figured out one day that your sales tax or your address on the dealership record was wrong, the state was wrong for whatever reason, and then somehow magically worked out that tax jar recognized the address with the wrong state. I don't know how you would ever do this, but in to be able to update it every every contract tied to that dealership would just magically update the next time you pay a tax jar.

Speaker 1  1:07:56
Okay, in theory, how does how does that work, actually? So let's say hypothetically, I have 20 contracts that are assigned to a wrong tax, a wrong a wrong tax category, county, state, whatever, and you go update that, are you liable to go fix that in history with with

Matthias Miller  1:08:16
that is a question, what happens if you discover six months In that you've assigned it to the wrong jurisdiction and or it's been at the wrong address, or they moved four months ago, they moved it across state lines. They're going to keep paying. They just moved four months ago, and they never told you, and you were liable for taxes for those for this past

Speaker 1  1:08:38
I mean, I know, I know anybody using RTO Pro, I think it's always just directly moves forward. Nobody ever really cares about historical but, I mean, I wonder what the liability, I wonder what the I wonder what the law actually says in regards that, like, the moment you actually know, do you have to go fix the timeframe and, like, do amendments to sales tax? Well, that just makes me tired to even think about,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:03
listen, there, there

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
is no end of rabbit holes, of chasing accounting.

Speaker 1  1:09:12
I am money. I'm done thinking about that. I'm not worried about it. It will be a we're going to move in a linear fashion in that regard. And if somebody comes up one days and goes, guys, you really screwed this one up. We go, thank you for that information. We'll go fix

Matthias Miller  1:09:25
it now. Well, and it's actually very simple, if it really comes down to it, then we're going to regenerate, find out the jurisdiction, copy and paste in the history RG row, or do something and update the jurisdiction historically, and it'll be reflected on their next liability payment will reverse all the old jurisdiction and apply to the new. And it's just, it's an admin thing, and if we need to make a tool for it, then we'll make a tool for it. But until then, until you get tired of doing it manually, we're just going to do it manually. I agree. Look at that. We're on the same page. How can two walk together? Again, unless they are agreed. I guess we can go in a walk.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:02
I still don't get your Pharaoh comment.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:05
Which one

Speaker 1  1:10:11
your your comment about? That's what Pharaoh is something about. I said. This goes back to the physical address joke.

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
Let's see with this, what Pharaoh said, Yeah, where was that? Hey, that's what Pharaoh killed the liver. That's what Pharaoh commanded. Oh, God, he was telling the midwives to kill the kids.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
Okay, now it's funny. That is a very delayed joke. That's a four hour delay.

Matthias Miller  1:10:45
Oh my goodness, it's not even that funny, honestly. But hey,

Speaker 1  1:10:52
it's a little bit like a long, long, long time ago, I worked with a guy who was a paramedic, and he had so many jokes, but the one that just always cracked me up, he'd go, Well, I'm gonna make like a fetus and head out. That's where he

Matthias Miller  1:11:10
makes some kind of comment about a breach of contract.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
Okay, what else do we need to work on? Have

Matthias Miller  1:11:19
we nailed this one more thing, do you have you ever heard? Do you know what the most common use is for cowhide?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:27
No holding cows together?

Matthias Miller  1:11:41
Yes, please, yes, please, yes, please. Seth wants to join us. Okay, he will grace us with the privilege of his honored presence.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
Okay, tell him to join this, this circus.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
Join the circus. There we go.

Speaker 1  1:12:15
Matthias very bad jokes about the usage of cowhide.

Matthias Miller  1:12:20
What's do? You know what the most common usage is for cowhide? No idea holding cows together.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
Oh, that's fair.

Matthias Miller  1:12:40
Okay, so before we get into the tax jar stuff, Josh is going to be implementing tax jar.

Speaker 2  1:12:47
So sounds great. I don't know how that Josh is willing to, willing tax jar,

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
or Okay, willing to is. I mean, is it a done deal that he's going to do it? Or is there any

Speaker 1  1:12:59
his comment was, yes, I'm interested. Send me the details. That was his comment. All right, I don't Is that, is that Josh's version of done deal? Or is that Josh's version of, I'll take a look at it.

Speaker 5  1:13:14
My instinct is it's probably done deal, but I don't know for sure, or at least, at least close. Yeah, Matthias has better idea than I do. I think it's basically,

Matthias Miller  1:13:24
I'm doing it, and I'm going to tell you where they want different, but that's,

Speaker 5  1:13:32
I don't know. I mean, there's going to be that much for him to do on the platform or on our side. No, it's not. It's just hooking it up to tax jar, essentially, and it's the whiskey work to hook it up,

Matthias Miller  1:13:45
and the whiskey the triggers, right?

Speaker 5  1:13:50
So we might have to talk him through what we're doing a little bit.

Matthias Miller  1:13:53
Think so, but one of us can think it's pretty straightforward, yeah, for sure. So are, and you can poke holes in it, but under the primary end. So on the contract, we're thinking, we need to freeze. No, we don't freeze. We're thinking, for customers, we need to freeze the physical location on the contract, because buildings location, yes, building, because, I mean, it could be anywhere. The spec

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
in this it's so confusing that would help a lot.

Matthias Miller  1:14:30
So to the to the building, for the building, and then add a button called Copy customers, physical location, or maybe even just copy the customer, visible if they have one row or a physical

Speaker 5  1:14:49
one, or what, if they have a row that's set as a mailing address, if they only have one to mailing

Matthias Miller  1:14:57
if they have a. A single blank row, or a or a physical row, do we still validate against them, not having multiple physical locations? I think we should a

Speaker 1  1:15:13
contact record with without a second one is just blank, right from a type standpoint, so we would just copy that

Matthias Miller  1:15:18
dress, yeah, if it's a blank row, I mean, they could, they could have one that's a mailing address, which you don't want to do, but on the on the contact, we would say you can't have more than one physical location, right? Like, yes, can't have more than one physical your summer home is neither here nor there. And then, then we don't need editable macros. That's just simple. We need to so far, so good in this stuff.

Speaker 5  1:15:44
So does that mean we move in cash, tax, jar, stuff to a contract? Correct? Supposed, okay, this makes more sense,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
good, so that we need to reach out like

Speaker 5  1:15:59
something that should be a contra, then when we're linked, possibly linked to customers. So it was very confusing, but yes,

Matthias Miller  1:16:05
correct, agreed. So we need to, need, we need to, wow, I can't.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:11
We really need to physical mattresses

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
exactly on the dealers and warned, warned that changing it will update contracts and will update, will update, will

Unknown Speaker  1:16:26
definitely impact calculations

Unknown Speaker  1:16:30
that changing it will Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:16:32
how does it? How does it change sales tax

Matthias Miller  1:16:36
in a half a dozen states, the origin has an impact on taxation in bizarre ways. So how are we? So we'll get to that. We'll have, we'll put it in the RG down here. We need to require dealership on contracts. We don't already this is not for you. I don't know. I guess I think this is a

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
two to dB, ask Josh if he has if

Unknown Speaker  1:17:19
let's do this. Do

Matthias Miller  1:17:27
Yes, that's all the same. Why

Speaker 1  1:17:28
wouldn't we ping and store the tax jar information on dealership record? What's the point?

Speaker 4  1:17:37
Well, then validate the in order to address but why do everything?

Matthias Miller  1:17:47
We need a way to Okay so we just have a checkbox on the dealer record that says we validated this address. Sure

Speaker 2  1:18:02
have a hidden field. Have have two hidden fields in the RG,

Speaker 1  1:18:10
so in theory, that jar in theory, then you you wouldn't necessarily need to, I mean, I guess you could still pass the dealership address in, but, I mean, would you need to pass the dealership address, and at that point for the for the from location,

Matthias Miller  1:18:25
or, yeah, because you need to know how the taxation works, because it's all contingent upon where it's from and where it's going to, right, right, right, right, right. Because this is government that we have, that we're working with, not

Unknown Speaker  1:18:38
simple people. The other option is that, that we,

Speaker 1  1:18:43
if we wanted to go the manual route, we put some sort of message on the dealership record that says you must validate this address in order to avoid errors on sales tax pinging. I mean, I mean, tell me I'm wrong to just go ahead and ping it by texture, and that validates the address.

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
I mean, I think this is a proposed, a worthy proposal for Josh at

Speaker 1  1:19:14
that point. I mean, at that at that point, just pass that information along to Josh. When you pass him all the details. And do I need to do. I need to reach out and ask him, this

Speaker 5  1:19:32
isn't that probably a field change, not one change, sure is it's going to be tough to do on change, partially because I feel changes makes sense, because it's reliant on multiple fields,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:48
chances, okay, so.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
And then. Kansas can can figure out how to well,

Matthias Miller  1:20:09
use an X 30 list, and Kansas can figure out how to handle errors.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:18
Is it still to do for me? I

Matthias Miller  1:20:24
um, do you want a Do you want to note? We could do a note, but we don't have it. If we would say pink tax jar, if we would have a

Speaker 1  1:20:49
does if you if you validate an address through TaxJar, do they come back and tell you what's wrong with it, or is it just tells you that

Matthias Miller  1:20:55
it's failed? They should give you a message of some kind. I don't know what it is, but

Speaker 3  1:21:00
to the errant user. Errant user, I think, created the contract record.

Matthias Miller  1:21:09
Why couldn't we just have the x 30 clear the tax jar and put Everything in the note

Matthias Miller  1:21:22
we need the modify user so

Speaker 1  1:21:43
yeah, okay, let me ask a question on this, because suddenly it's something's dawning on me that I don't exactly like. So I'm entering a dealership record, and I ping tax jar to validate the address, and it gives me an error, which puts it down in the notes that's assigned to me, that's my indication that it went sideways. Sure

Matthias Miller  1:22:10
we can give you real time alerts that say ding somebody else has assigned a new task to you. Would you like to go see what it is? I mean, the only other option is to make contract entry be part of a whiskey at this point or or you have a, well, okay, here's an idea. We can have a little whiskey page for putting in addresses. That matter, I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:41
don't like it. See,

Speaker 1  1:22:51
okay, Read on me this. This information will be stored on the dealership record. How? Like, okay, Read on me this right now, the on a sales order when you click ping, as soon as it writes it to it, you know, oftentimes you get this little red bar that says this record has been modified, and that little dot shows up on on the sales tax information, on the on the on the sales order record. If we can do something similar to that, that you like, you get this little white dot indication that, yes, it wrote the information, there. Great, go. You're ready to go.

Matthias Miller  1:23:36
I mean, we could have a green dot, red dot, gray dot that says valid address or Checking address, valid address, invalid address.

Matthias Miller  1:24:01
And then it's gray, and you save and it says you have to refresh. And you refresh. It says invalid address. And then you have a little ellipsis button there that pops up and you can see the error message,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:16
oh, hate that.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:23
That's fun. Wait, that bug's still around.

Speaker 5  1:24:28
Oh, it's like we found that a while ago. It's a weird ghost row thing.

Matthias Miller  1:24:37
It is a weird ghost row thing. It has something to do with the first column two doesn't it changing just, I don't know, I don't know what it is, all right, so then, but then if can

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
you again I want to search that error. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:02
I'm Can you just copy that? Send it to me? This is the

Matthias Miller  1:25:06
most consistent I've been able to duplicate it.

Speaker 2  1:25:11
I've never had this good luck with it. Let's try it on it. There you have, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:16
I think, but it's been a while. I thought it was resolved.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:21
Let's go try somebody else view all mailing physical boom. Do

Matthias Miller  1:25:48
see that didn't it had something to do with the first row. I didn't mean to do that. Or a new record? No, those weren't new records, okay, new contact, New Dealer. Try new dealer. This is worse on this got it?

Speaker 5  1:26:11
Yeah, it's so if you Okay, do it. Go again, refresh it. B roll, do it, and then wait a little bit before you click into the next

Unknown Speaker  1:26:27
row. Sometimes it's been with wag.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:32
Anyway, if I do

Matthias Miller  1:26:34
this now, do this, it works. So if you watch the MRG in the back,

Speaker 5  1:26:46
oh, because, no, I don't know. It's somehow with the inserted field not being a key field. And I'm guessing

Matthias Miller  1:26:58
I don't know. Okay, so if I do city, has something to do with list list items. Trying to think, I can think that's been a consistent theme list fields, but I don't know,

Speaker 1  1:27:13
Dwayne, you wanted to do. I want to what you wanted something. Okay, so let's talk me through how the validating the address thing will work. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:27:29
the biggest thing that we need to handle is we're not showing all addresses, so it needs to show. It probably needs to be whether there are any unverified addresses. So it's green if all are verified, gray if some are unverified, or red if any are invalid. But

Speaker 5  1:27:44
don't we only want to validate the physical address, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:27:49
but, but if the physical address, do, we then Sort the physical address to the top row

Unknown Speaker  1:27:57
that way, so it always shows up.

Matthias Miller  1:28:02
Do you care, Dwayne? Is that fine?

Speaker 1  1:28:05
That is fine. Sort of the physical is always at the top,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:10
and you're required to have a physical.

Speaker 5  1:28:13
Sounds like the army, because that's order a CDL.

Matthias Miller  1:28:19
Why are these haulers? I selling ships for us is so rough

Speaker 1  1:28:25
and and let's, let's make sure that you can never change the type physical in the list.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:34
You mean change, aren't we?

Speaker 5  1:28:41
Fine, as long as we just require one address to be have a type of physical, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:28:46
But if some, if some really brilliant guy that says, I hate this word physical, I want to go change it, and they

Unknown Speaker  1:28:52
you can't. It's a shipped item. Okay?

Speaker 1  1:28:57
I thought I saw Matthias attempting to change mailing our physical a little bit ago.

Matthias Miller  1:29:01
Well, I mean, you can, but then we're gonna say, if it's a dealer, you'd say, well, you don't have a physical address. Oh, well, then, yeah, sorry that became, if you, if

Speaker 1  1:29:11
you could potentially break the physical address thing for all contact records, that would be a

Speaker 5  1:29:16
sad day. You can't. It would be, it's a shipped item, all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:20
as long as they shift data,

Speaker 5  1:29:23
figure out how to rename that, then we have many more.

Matthias Miller  1:29:27
Oh, good, gracious. That'd be terrifying sort physical locations to the top on the MRG show. I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:45
green, gray, red, invalid.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:01
It's what? What triggers the validation

Matthias Miller  1:31:09
when you change whenever you change the address, whether

Speaker 1  1:31:14
you input a new one, or whether you change the physical address, it's going to automatically ping,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:18
yeah, but a lot of ping, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:21
I dig that

Speaker 5  1:31:22
and it, but it won't say pending verification until you save so

Unknown Speaker  1:31:27
if it was verified, sure. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:37
because we don't, because we have to override each of the address fields. That doesn't make me happy, or am I missing something?

Matthias Miller  1:31:55
Well, if we do something like we

Speaker 2  1:32:01
don't have any other late here, contact address Street,

Matthias Miller  1:32:08
by the way, putting contact the street address, okay, we'll find

Speaker 5  1:32:13
this Contact too. That's terrible.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:17
Oh, yeah, I know

Speaker 5  1:32:22
some of these are probably leftovers from early systems being coded where English was a second language

Matthias Miller  1:32:31
that would make sense. Addresses empty we have um,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
yeah, so we could,

Matthias Miller  1:32:49
yeah. I mean, the only way would be with an editable macro that says, or, you know, I don't know, has RG,

Speaker 2  1:33:02
or, you know, if, if current physical address equals saved address,

Speaker 5  1:33:09
yes, yeah, we can work around it, if we want to, without too much hassle. I mean, slightly the same as the field change, duh. It's the same conditions,

Matthias Miller  1:33:22
yeah, yeah. I mean, or you could, you could even have a verified address field, yeah, if don't worry about it, we're Yeah, we'll figure it out. Okay, so, and then this is 330

Unknown Speaker  1:33:36
to do Seth, and then to do Josh. Seth will give you a

Matthias Miller  1:33:48
a field to watch for

Unknown Speaker  1:33:53
pinging and an X 32 update,

Matthias Miller  1:33:58
X 30 list.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:08
It appear. How does that work? The X 30 list, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:14
I mean I can assume that something like this. Now we just

Matthias Miller  1:34:21
do an X 30 list for extensibility. That's the only reason

Unknown Speaker  1:34:32
this doesn't show the error.

Speaker 5  1:34:47
Mean, he's going to fill out the XR list, though, isn't he? Or am I straight? Or is it going to be the same responses? I guess I could find this API

Unknown Speaker  1:34:58
Well, I mean, I. Uh, tax jar.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:11
Tax for order, that's the breakdown.

Matthias Miller  1:35:18
Where's the so we have

Speaker 5  1:35:27
the list because you want to update the dealer, and then you also want to go update the dealer, the cash dealer address. Or where else are you going to update stuff?

Matthias Miller  1:35:38
We're not caching dealer addresses. I don't think you have. Well, the only real reason for next 30 lists if you want accessibility, but it's probably

Speaker 5  1:35:46
just overkill. Oh, I mean, let's just start with the next 30 unless we okay, there's your next 30 list if we want it.

Matthias Miller  1:36:01
So this goes down to contract,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:06
and then we'll also need, because we're now going to be pinging from both the

Speaker 5  1:36:13
contract and the contact, potentially, because we need to ping the contact from dealers, and We need to ping from contract says, Wow, Right do

Unknown Speaker  1:36:50
Okay, so that okay on this a

Unknown Speaker  1:37:11
good so answer your question.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:20
Okay, so we're just manually changing. We're

Matthias Miller  1:37:21
just manually changing for the time being, and the liability bill payment will just magically, right, do delta. So that's fine, yeah, the

Speaker 5  1:37:30
deltas I was all worried about, yeah, but well, and now that we have the address actually on there, we could, we would be able to go update the RG if we needed to

Matthias Miller  1:37:45
well, but you need to know exactly why the address changed. Did the address change because they moved now? Was it a month ago? Do we have it wrong since the beginning? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:54
So, all right, bunch more work to figure out. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:37:59
And then this stuff is largely the same. We just move this stuff over under the contract,

Speaker 5  1:38:07
are we okay? I see so the source street, city, state,

Matthias Miller  1:38:13
yeah, we need source of destination. Source would be, would be healer. Destination would be

Unknown Speaker  1:38:21
customer address.

Matthias Miller  1:38:26
And so I wonder if there could be something as simple as a ping, text or check box that would trigger this for Josh, and he would just update ping that for each of the RG items. I don't know. I don't know how he wants to do that, something to coordinate with him, but I think ideally, if you want to draw a clear distinction, have some kind of way that you put in the RG which you want to have pinged, and he stuffs the results in, and you go handle whatever you want to on the silver moon side.

Speaker 5  1:39:08
So if we have Okay, so source and destination are required for one pane,

Matthias Miller  1:39:16
they are not required, but for accurate right, for accurate information, there? Oh, they're not what I was, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:39:23
for a little bit I was getting confused if we're splitting rates somehow. But no, you you give tax to our source and the destination, and then they give us the rates. Yeah, they tell us what's one set of rates for the two for source and destination combined, essentially,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:41
or however they work together. Yeah, yeah, okay.

Speaker 5  1:39:55
And can you set address from either. SEC primary or secondary customer address from primary or secondary, as in,

Matthias Miller  1:40:12
what do you do you want that ability?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:15
Dwayne is primary.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:18
I think it's just it's primary. And

Speaker 5  1:40:21
is it the same way then for payments, like, if you're setting up auto pay, we only show a list of payment methods for the primary customer. I think so. So what is a secondary

Unknown Speaker  1:40:36
customer? So somebody else?

Speaker 1  1:40:40
Okay, secondary customer is rarely ever used, okay. But if somebody, if they were to field on the contract that there's a co owner of the of the contract, we just want to store that information. It's really informational only,

Speaker 5  1:40:56
so it's very, very different from our primary customer, like they probably can't log can they log in from the payment whiskey and pay?

Unknown Speaker  1:41:14
Huh? That I had not thought about.

Speaker 5  1:41:22
And yeah, and do we list contracts like, if you're a secondary customer and we have a list of contracts like, we display a list of contracts on the customer?

Speaker 4  1:41:31
Sure, that would make sense. Okay, we're doing that right now, but

Speaker 1  1:41:40
put a to do for me to think about Matthias somewhere on on secondary this would, this would go under Customer Portal, should a secondary customer be able to create a profile and log into a contract? I guess they're secondary on I

Unknown Speaker  1:42:03
got to think about that one okay.

Speaker 1  1:42:12
Part of me was okay, I will say with a with a caveat, note to this, with a secondary bullet point to that, that to the to think if we're going to allow it, it's going to come after we go to market. I'm not primary is going to be the only one for for initial go to market.

Matthias Miller  1:42:31
Well, then let's do this. Let's be honest. We recorded a whole podcast episode this morning on truth telling. It was a fun thing. It was so glorious. Unscheduled, 1415, what's your podcast? Pub in the desert? This guy with a with a janky website design, because we don't spend for branding. That's not who we are.

Speaker 5  1:43:03
You have a house for drinking beer with a what is it? Or wine or something with a fox? What kind is that? A gray fox? I don't know. It's ears are bigger than a gray fox. This is

Unknown Speaker  1:43:27
Seth to find out what Fox is on his okay, I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:30
was gonna say that

Matthias Miller  1:43:32
it's specifically a fitted Fox, because it's it's native to the Sahara Desert. So if you start listening to the podcast, you'll understand why it matters.

Speaker 5  1:43:40
Okay? Because that looks, I was gonna say, that does not look like any sort of North American Fox. No, it's not anyway, okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50
Something about being honest. Something about honesty. So I was just

Matthias Miller  1:43:53
trying to be truthful about the priority of it, which led down the rabbit hole. Because there you go. Okay, so let's be honest that this isn't for secondary, secondary contacts in payment portal or customer portal. So it's not lost, but it's not here. It's

Speaker 1  1:44:15
a sum. I mean, we look, we got to start saving up features to release after we go to market, like, seriously?

Matthias Miller  1:44:23
Well, Seth's not concerned about it, but understand where you where you are.

Speaker 5  1:44:26
Go ahead and so that we can actually, like, wrap this thing up so we can get a market.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:30
Wow, yeah, the real thing.

Speaker 1  1:44:34
Okay, you have to, we got to take a moment and appreciate the fact that we are trying to one, build a software that way outperforms RTO Pro, RTO smart, plus do accounting, plus just, and we're kind of trying to do it in half a year.

Matthias Miller  1:44:49
It's on a much that's a 10th of what these other guys spent.

Speaker 1  1:44:55
Probably, yeah, yeah. So we're awesome. We're. Yeah, oh no. Rephrase, you guys are awesome. No, you're awesome, and so but I mean, good gracious, we've got to save some things to release afterwards. It's like, it it could sound really, really amazing to be like, Oh yeah, it does that, and does that, it does that, oh yeah, it's up, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, and it's like, and then it's like, for five years. We don't change it because we don't have anything else to really anything

Matthias Miller  1:45:26
else to release there, though. Anyway,

Speaker 1  1:45:30
yeah, new marketing slogan. We no updates for five years because we thought of everything

Matthias Miller  1:45:35
so software, so software is so good, we just stopped.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:40
Yeah, well, that's just wrong. But anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:45:46
sales tax is off in sales taxes off our plate now, I guess, yeah, back in my court again. Sweet. Do we want to what? Never mind. Okay. Is there anything else you're waiting on? Okay, let's take Hang on. Can you talk? Okay? What do you think? And then I'll talk. Okay. So laser focus, blinders on, helper macros, so accounting impact has been standardized, yep, so theoretically I should be able to go in here and, well, I don't have to do it now, but I should be able to use the standard, standard accounting now. Awesome.

Speaker 5  1:46:37
Also, the menu now has more than one column, because that was fucking me to no end.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:43
Oh, thank you for all, for all of

Speaker 5  1:46:45
them, yeah, well, for all of them to have more than

Speaker 1  1:46:48
things I was, I was, one day I was gonna, I was gonna, like, throw a message out to please do something about but,

Speaker 5  1:46:54
but the dumb thing is, it took me a minute to do that. We just needed to do it.

Matthias Miller  1:47:01
You know? Okay, so then this will break schedule task, which will make me fix them. So, so we have accounting impact, which we think we're good to go on, you're getting the helper macros in, and we are where we at on the auto pay stuff. Nick's making good progress, good. So will that be ready for us to for him to show up tomorrow? Hopefully.

Speaker 5  1:47:26
I don't know exactly where he's at. He was, he's had one or two calls today as well, so, but I know he was, he was going ham on it yesterday and this morning.

Matthias Miller  1:47:33
So we have our call is moved to the afternoon starting. So at one,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:44
yeah, I think so, yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  1:47:49
And then, and then, okay, so that's that. Then the next question is, is that enough? I'm still white knuckled about the customer portal, because if we're looping in, Justin, in, using Jonathan's resources. I'm nervous Theory of Constraints. I'm nervous about that. Is there anything I should be is there anything does this give you guys enough work to keep you busy through you know, Friday, next Friday when, well, we're Dwayne and I are not going to get our heads together, so realistically, until the following Monday, when Dwayne and I can queue up more stuff for you. And is there anything we should be white knuckled about for December that we're not yet? Yes, there's

Speaker 1  1:48:31
one thing that we need to be white knuckled about over December. But are we, is there anything we should be white knuckled about for next week in like the like for Paducah? Go ahead.

Speaker 5  1:48:40
I want to I want to do some cleanup on contracts that we talked about Matthias, to make the feeling more parallel to contract definitions, and then make sure we're actually caching stuff correctly. Yes, that not convinced everything's being cached correctly. And really, we should probably look at calculations again,

Speaker 1  1:49:06
calculations we should definitely look at for December. The other thing we need to figure out is,

Speaker 5  1:49:11
are we trying to handle all payment, type, like, sorry, weekly, etc, for December?

Speaker 1  1:49:20
Yeah, we don't have to. We don't have to. We can, we can? We need to handle all, all payment type frequencies by spring. But we do not need to handle it by, okay, by December. That's a big deal. We do need to handle what was the thing you threw on there yesterday about

Speaker 4  1:49:45
strict data? Yes, that's a big one, right?

Matthias Miller  1:49:50
Yeah, that would be good to have done by by December, wouldn't it? I mean, I don't think it's this is this is optimistic. Mean, I don't think it's terrible. They just it needs to be done.

Speaker 5  1:50:03
Yeah, probably not terrible, no, but it needs to be thought through for every level. Correct? How do we part of that is, then, how do we know which user is part of what rental company

Unknown Speaker  1:50:19
are we looking to find it on the user?

Speaker 2  1:50:23
Wouldn't you have a something good? Would you link a

Unknown Speaker  1:50:28
user to contact? Are we,

Matthias Miller  1:50:32
I hate linking users to contacts? Is there we had talked about that Dwayne and I think, did we decide I don't know that we need is there a reason why? Well, okay, what do notes tie out to?

Unknown Speaker  1:50:46
I think it's users.

Matthias Miller  1:50:48
I think we had tied out notes to users so that we didn't have to do the we wouldn't have to have contact records for users. And so, yeah, and so it's on the user record. I'm, I'm almost, I would

Speaker 1  1:51:01
define both rental company and accounting company. Or does that automatically?

Matthias Miller  1:51:06
No, it goes hand in it goes hand in hand. And whether you get the rental accounting company depends on Well, except for this story gets interesting, except for independent accounting companies, we might need to give you a special extra permission.

Matthias Miller  1:51:27
Wait. Did we do we support restricted data on accounting companies? Currently we nixed it because of performance issues in zfp.

Matthias Miller  1:51:45
Sounds right because we don't have any data restrictions in the multi company. We just have strict binary Can you can you not?

Unknown Speaker  1:51:59
Yum, um,

Speaker 1  1:52:03
wait, are you talking? Are you talking like hard restrictions, like the restricted user stuff like we have over in zfp, or are you talking like, I'm assigned to this company, and so I can only see that company? Is this address bar restriction? Or is this like company

Speaker 5  1:52:22
database, database for accounting stuff?

Matthias Miller  1:52:28
I think we need to store. Most likely we'll need to store on the list. Okay, here's what I think. I think very likely we'll be forced to add the restriction restricted data rules, only to only to the only system, or we'll have to have an accounting restricted data thing or something. And I think on the user record, we'll probably end up resorting to saying, here are the rental companies, and here are the accounting companies that you have access to, and warn about discrepancies, I suspect, but I don't know for sure that we're not going to want to do cross lookups because you're right, because you don't want to go from the transaction to the company.

Speaker 5  1:53:12
Yeah, that, yeah. That will majorly help speed

Speaker 4  1:53:19
so does that? So does that mean that

Speaker 1  1:53:25
my office will be the only one that can really add users? Then, because we don't want an actual user inside of a company to be able to add users, and because you don't want, you don't want a user to be able to change out their assignments for Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:53:39
it's right because you can't, I mean, you can't control user access unless, yeah, if you're in a shared system, if you're on a sub 500 contract plan, you can't administrate your own system. That's part of what you get by being on a shared server.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:55
Sorry, punk, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:54:00
I mean, otherwise, they can do everything,

Speaker 1  1:54:02
unless we came up with some sort of way to say, no. I mean, yeah, you're I think you're right. It's a little obnoxious, but, I mean, I think that's at least by for December. That's exactly the way it's going to be, like we might come up with some fancy way to do it in the future, where it adds some administration back to the to the individual user inside of a shared database. But I mean, by December, that's, that's it. We need to drop dead simple and easy.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:29
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

Matthias Miller  1:54:34
The only thing I could think of is a, is a secondary record that with an X 30 trigger that pushes back on modifies the user profile record using an admin and you just know that the secondary record can only, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:49
Let's think about it right now. Good.

Speaker 1  1:54:55
Just, just fair warning, I am toying around with this idea of. Of offering better pricing if you go into the shared database versus, like, even if you're, you're, you're, you exceed 500 contracts. If you come to me and you say, look, I've got 20,000 contracts. I don't want to pay your 1% fine for for seven 5% or, you know, half a percent, you can come in the shared database. And because Leanne says to me, Well, why would you want that? Because more data is interesting,

Matthias Miller  1:55:29
because you get access to the data exactly data, it's not free. The discount isn't free. You're paying for

Speaker 1  1:55:37
it somewhere. Because here's the thing, think about, think about things like cash projections, like that, revenue projections, if you can revenue project across every company in the database, or you can revenue project across just your companies, well, then you can get you can get a lot more interesting data. You can get a lot more accurate data. You can get Analysis Reporting gets way better.

Speaker 5  1:56:02
Are we gonna have concerns with just the sheer size of the database, especially with restricted data? Is it gonna start getting slow? That's my concern.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:18
Yeah. I mean, because you could be dealing with

Matthias Miller  1:56:21
who knows how many

Speaker 5  1:56:22
records? Well, especially customers, because their contact level, it's a lookup level with restricted data, which we know that's it. You need to be a little careful, right?

Matthias Miller  1:56:34
20,000 contracts could be painful. A couple of companies with 20,000 contracts could be painful

Speaker 1  1:56:41
pretty quickly. So there's less unless we unless we said okay, unless we capped and said, you know, okay for arbitrary number 100,000 100,000 contact records, is really where we want to max out with. Well, then we'll just go open up a secondary shared database to put, to put more, if customers want to go

Matthias Miller  1:57:04
that route. Well, we're going to have trouble with with, we're going to run into trouble with, and maybe we need to think through architectural wise, but we could start running into trouble at 10,000 contacts

Unknown Speaker  1:57:18
inside of a shared database, any

Matthias Miller  1:57:20
database,

Speaker 5  1:57:21
because look up levels and restricted data. Okay, slow. Okay, so, but let's take, let's take a company

Speaker 1  1:57:27
like, let's say we onboard JMAG. They're going to come with more than 10,000 contracts right out of the gate. But then again, they're probably not going to run with restricted levels, because they're not going to be inside a restricted database, because that may or they're not. They're not going to be sharing their database with somebody else. They're going to want their they're going to want their own instance. So in that regard, we wouldn't have the speed concerns, correct

Matthias Miller  1:57:47
well, but we have Seth, we're going to get into trouble with a ballooning catalog that that like, that's the that's the other

Unknown Speaker  1:57:56
nerve wracking, every, every,

Matthias Miller  1:58:01
every rename, every new customer name, rename of a customer, or removal of a customer, which removal wouldn't happen, is going to double the size of they're just gonna, yeah, compound the size of, kind of like that, until you rebuild, until you rebuild, which you can solve with nightly rebuilds, if it's as long as you stay within appropriate threshold. Yeah. Now where we got into issues with PDP was, No, I don't know what the threshold is. I mean that we ran into it with PDP, but they were zbp and but they were, they were doing like, 1000 entries a day, or whatever it was.

Speaker 5  1:58:41
Well, yeah, that's just mind blowing.

Speaker 5  1:58:50
I mean, yeah, removing restricted data for companies like JMAG would do it would help a lot.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:58
Yeah, I think, I think we need to think of this. It is words, go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:09
let me have a catalog for the data restrictions.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:14
Yeah, I agree. It

Speaker 1  1:59:17
would not be unreasonable to see a date like inside of a shared database to balloon way beyond 10,000 contracts. So, I mean, I think if this is, if architecture is going to be an issue, then we should, we should probably be thinking about that now.

Matthias Miller  1:59:36
There's no this is, this is a, this is a

Matthias Miller  1:59:44
man, it makes you wish that there'd be a way that you could have contact records, either be custom database levels or lookups, and we

Unknown Speaker  1:59:55
wouldn't have any trouble there. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:00
Which is a pain. So what would that take?

Matthias Miller  2:00:03
Wait a minute. Steph, there is a world in which you could do this. I don't think we want to, but

Unknown Speaker  2:00:20
you could effectively

Matthias Miller  2:00:26
always have them be look up, record custom database levels, tie them out to list options, filter the list options, filter the list down to ones that are actively used in the database. So you do a you use an index and convert to list string. And, I mean, I guess you you still need to, you need at some level, and you can't do lookups, and it's just okay.

Speaker 1  2:01:01
Well, your brains have something to chew on. I need to drop. I look forward to digging into this some more.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:07
Okay, we're back home tomorrow, right?

Matthias Miller  2:01:12
Yeah, tomorrow afternoon, unless you

Speaker 3  2:01:14
nope, that's good. Thanks, sir. That's going to be some fun things to figure out. Yep, thanks. Bye.
