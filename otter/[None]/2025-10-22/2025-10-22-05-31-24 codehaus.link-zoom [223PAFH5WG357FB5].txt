Matthias Miller  00:31
Yo, yo. Wednesday, happy

Unknown Speaker  00:35
day, buddy, um,

Unknown Speaker  00:39
yo, no,

Unknown Speaker  00:41
no, we can share or not, but I'm sure so. All right.

Unknown Speaker  00:46
All right. Yes, sir, where would you like to start? I think the

Matthias Miller  01:02
go to test. SPC, dot, Silver loom.io,

Unknown Speaker  01:07
a new window, new tab. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  01:29
Same password.

Matthias Miller  01:38
Okay, so I don't remember how old the copy is. I was having trouble with the live cop, like the emailed one of one of my colleagues. The copy from the live system isn't working, but I have a little bit from a backup. But if you go into

Unknown Speaker  01:59
items, I

Speaker 1  02:08
items, hey morning George, items.

Matthias Miller  02:12
And to make your life simple, I added a raw material search, if you just put RW in there. I

Matthias Miller  02:23
Okay, and then pick one of these that you want to drill down into

Unknown Speaker  02:33
63 but CW three, you

Matthias Miller  02:44
all right, scroll down. So there's a random with checkbox for the main yield, and there's one for the saw one yield as well,

Unknown Speaker  02:59
right here. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  03:03
So this one, trying to remember the specifics of this one. Here is this one?

Speaker 2  03:16
Well, yeah, the raw material, the raw material on salt one is random width. So and saw two is a multiplier. Should we click on the random Width box?

Matthias Miller  03:34
Yeah, if the and so the yes and then also scroll down. You should also do random width on saw one right.

Speaker 2  03:56
Just saw one yield is reass Correct, right? Rat.

Matthias Miller  04:09
So if you run through the numbers, if you scroll up a little bit, end game is,

Matthias Miller  04:21
What's four times four times 5.5 22 inches of coverage. So that,

Speaker 2  04:31
actually, I'm not sure what. We don't need rent. We're taking random width, but we're yielding three and a halfs and five and a halfs for this particular job. So the end yield on this job is actually either half or either or five and a half. So I think I need to uncheck one of these boxes. Am I

Matthias Miller  04:58
right? Check the top one i. Okay, there we go. Stay yielding five and a half

Speaker 2  05:03
perfect. That's the saw two yield. Saw one yield should be, yes, should be random, one by random width by 45 that's saw

Unknown Speaker  05:17
one yield.

Speaker 2  05:21
This here, saw one. Yield dimension should be a layer of one by random width by 45

Matthias Miller  05:28
716, so then the yield thickness should be one on, saw one on, saw one. Yeah. So do you want to change? Change that? Scroll down, saw one yield thickness,

Unknown Speaker  05:46
yeah, is that what was in there?

Matthias Miller  05:48
Yeah, point Yeah, 716, is what was in there.

Speaker 2  05:52
That's inherent from the old information, yep.

Matthias Miller  05:57
So now yields one by random width, yep, and you need, you need 44 inches. Well, okay, it leads, it yields a little over a quarter layer of

Speaker 2  06:23
you're saying yes, yes, yes, to get to five and a halfs. Yeah, 22 inches, so, right,

Unknown Speaker  06:30
yep, which

Unknown Speaker  06:32
um, anyway.

Speaker 2  06:36
Never mind. I'll go there later um, because we need anyway, that's a Bonnie trail for a second here. Okay, hold on, so quantities for demand this here is the same as what we're have here, right?

Matthias Miller  06:57
Yeah, yeah, it is. But then you'll also need the net. Need to change the the row for the next or you'll need to change the row for the three and a

Speaker 2  07:05
halfs, right? So this random Width box here is that the same as down below? Yeah. Okay, yep. All right, no, let's just run through so then I

Unknown Speaker  07:17
think everything's right.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
The raw material info here

Speaker 1  07:25
should 45 right? George, because it's long, long length, but

Unknown Speaker  07:31
you're gonna cut 45 Yeah, but

Speaker 1  07:34
you're taking it out of eight footers.

Unknown Speaker  07:42
Miller W of my next right?

Unknown Speaker  07:49
You want to x in there,

Speaker 1  07:52
because it's not mixed. Isn't no dimension, okay? Split half inch l and m sawing multiplier,

Unknown Speaker  08:04
hang on saw. One miscellaneous prep, okay, got to take this out.

Unknown Speaker  08:12
Take that out. So one yield quantity you

Speaker 2  08:23
What's that? Sol, one yield quantity. Where's that coming from? Matt,

Matthias Miller  08:26
so we're taking the we're taking the final,

Matthias Miller  08:37
we're taking the final quantity of

Speaker 3  08:40
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  08:45
divided by two for the multiplier times the yield width, yeah, divided by 40 To turn it into a layer. Okay.

Speaker 2  09:02
So that makes sense. So 11 inches,

Unknown Speaker  09:07
yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 2  09:11
12 inches is point three. You get four or five and a half, four half a five and a half, 716, by five and a half out of a one by 11,

Unknown Speaker  09:22
and 11 is point two, eight of 40.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
Yeah, that makes sense,

Unknown Speaker  09:30
because 12 would be point

Matthias Miller  09:36
anyway, yeah. I mean, it's more like, what is it? 2.23 point 275,

Unknown Speaker  09:44
yeah, that's something,

Unknown Speaker  09:47
yeah, something like that, right? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  09:53
one inch, so one year, one five and a half. So basically that we're. Going to have to fill out.

Speaker 2  10:03
Well, on these jobs, you'd add to, I think it's all here, Matt, I think it's all here. Add to coin. So

Unknown Speaker  10:11
sorry, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  10:12
Well, let's, let's do this one. Let's change the three and a halfs, and then let's take a look. Let's preview the cut list, because that's the other thing I want to yep, I gotta knock my stomach about

Unknown Speaker  10:23
total board feet.

Speaker 2  10:27
That seems good. Should I save this or just keep editing

Matthias Miller  10:31
you can you can save and keep and then keep going. The Save thing is blinking up here. Yeah, it wants you to save after. Let's go make sure you don't wonder what you can just you don't have to do anything else. Just scroll down and keep going. Hi, five,

Unknown Speaker  10:50
three and a halfs.

Unknown Speaker  10:54
I have three and a half or don't

Speaker 1  10:55
we not random with my random width, not sewing,

Unknown Speaker  11:07
yeah, you need to sign. They need a

Unknown Speaker  11:09
multiplier elements.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
Get rid of this. So line is cut the length.

Speaker 4  11:21
Sequence you saw on your ring, yes,

Speaker 1  11:29
and so on your thickness is one. And

Unknown Speaker  11:49
now cut this.

Matthias Miller  11:50
Okay, so go over to New orders on the menu.

Speaker 1  11:57
Um, like you're saying, go to the home page,

Matthias Miller  12:01
yeah, home page, yeah, new orders and search for C, W, o3, you'll just have to inside of here. Or actually, hang on, hang on, go, go, show, go, show all orders. You're right. So hit, hit the hit the icon up or the title up top where you were just a minute ago. Or no new orders, right back where we were. Hit the sage orders up top,

Unknown Speaker  12:42
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:46
Only no uncheck that, so we see old orders as well. And then let's see if we can find a CW 03,

Unknown Speaker  12:57
I can't search that. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  12:59
you can't. Well, there's one either way, right? There you are,

Matthias Miller  13:07
go back, go back.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
No, I'll sound a little long, right, sending,

Matthias Miller  13:13
sorry, yeah, you can, yeah, generate materials list, material

Speaker 1  13:18
so this is highlighted. Now I can do Yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  13:24
yep. Now, yep, go to

Matthias Miller  13:32
the cut list.

Matthias Miller  13:39
All right, let's find the CW threes.

Unknown Speaker  13:43
There's the

Speaker 1  13:48
200 that's L and M.

Unknown Speaker  14:04
Um so

Speaker 2  14:05
200 layers of one by random width by 4200

Matthias Miller  14:11
they ordered tuner tuna palettes. They got each one has five layers. Does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  14:24
No, five, five and a half. Each

Unknown Speaker  14:28
one has five of the five, five and a half. This should be, I mean, this quantity should this is the,

Unknown Speaker  14:40
what are we talking

Speaker 5  14:43
but you're dragging the five and a half and the three and a half out of that correct? Yeah, so would be more. It would be, wait, wait,

Unknown Speaker  14:53
wait, 40 and 12. Why is this? No, the

Matthias Miller  14:56
dimensions, the dimensions are. Something's wrong with the dimensions, because we're yield. Building. So once we go to print, it'll, it'll standardize the quantities on your layers. But these should not be saying,

Speaker 2  15:15
well, this is what, this is the yield that we want off the L, M, we want layers of one inch by random width by 45 that is the yield that we were lost,

Matthias Miller  15:25
okay, but this is not the order you pushed over. You pushed over the eight. Okay, you pushed over the eight. One order, right

Speaker 1  15:33
yeah, right there. Sorry, which one is it? These

Matthias Miller  15:37
two, that one, the green one, right there.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
Okay, okay.

Speaker 1  15:46
Okay, so, what is it different?

Matthias Miller  15:51
Yeah, the 1021 is an older okay. So

Speaker 2  16:03
correct single item we need point three layers the so total yield is 12. So we're looking for 12 layers Correct, right? This isn't the schedule, this is just

Unknown Speaker  16:20
the cut list,

Unknown Speaker  16:24
40 pallets,

Speaker 2  16:26
point three layers for each one, we need 12 layers to do the 40 pallets. And there we need 12 layers as well.

Unknown Speaker  16:37
Seems good, okay,

Matthias Miller  16:39
and then let's go look at the splitter for the 821, oh, yeah, yeah. There we go. Right there, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:50
So 40 pounds, five and four, you know, 201 60. That's right here.

Matthias Miller  16:57
You hit the sawing schedule. All right, go down to lnM. LnM, the oh, these are Schedule B, sorry, put them on the I gotta go back. Yeah, go back.

Speaker 6  17:18
What we have right here, these guys. So how do I do

Matthias Miller  17:27
check it? That'll, that'll check both, yep, because they're together on the same splitter.

Unknown Speaker  17:36
Okay, gotcha, you'll slow here.

Matthias Miller  17:45
Try again, and they're both on the same There you go. All right. Now we get now we're ready for the song schedule.

Speaker 1  17:51
Go to Song schedule. Yeah. Matt, one second, Yeah. John, okay with it. Okay. So Sounds good. All right. Matt, so here we go,

Matthias Miller  18:12
one by random widths mixed at bottom,

Speaker 1  18:16
where we at eight. One here we go. Here we go, yeah, one by

Speaker 2  18:19
random width mix, perfect splitter, 12 layers. That is awesome. I mean 12 layers of one by random width by 45 that's the end goal. 12 more splitter, eight, one. Here

Unknown Speaker  18:39
we go. Bottom, 200

Matthias Miller  18:42
raw materials, the layer

Speaker 2  18:43
of one by rain with 45 should we transfer that quantity? George, like we're trying to do 12 layers. Do you want that 12 in the raw material down below? Is that easy enough?

Matthias Miller  18:59
Matt, man, you're killing me. Man,

Speaker 5  19:02
no, I would leave it the way, but because once it, once the on them cuts it, it doesn't matter what the appendix footer, as long as it's one by random, 45 on the splitter. You don't need your letters, okay, long as the outcomes of three and a half, and five and a half, 45 piece. I

Speaker 2  19:22
mean, they know the goal. I just the forklifts operator might,

Speaker 1  19:27
yeah, if it's not a big deal, okay, I don't think it's a big deal.

Unknown Speaker  19:31
How hard is it to add that 12 or Matt,

Matthias Miller  19:34
keep in mind that, well, do you keep in mind that it's going to separate if you have 212 layers of one by random width and 16 layers of one by random width by 45 that'll create two separate sections for them on the cut list. Is that good?

Unknown Speaker  19:59
Yeah. Saying it wouldn't be together like this.

Matthias Miller  20:03
It's gonna, it's gonna, okay. It's gonna do two things. One, it's gonna change the sort order.

Unknown Speaker  20:11
If we add a quantity of the layers,

Matthias Miller  20:13
if you at least, if you put it on the front, okay? And it's gonna, if you have same dimensions of layers, but different quantities, because it's going to put them in separate sections. Yeah. So I'm happy to do it. It's not a big deal to do it. That's those are the implications.

Speaker 1  20:30
Okay, so it's not that big of a deal. Leave it to where it is. So let's leave it to where it is. This is what we need, right there, 200 layers split, half inch. That's exactly what we're doing. Well, we could change, yeah, you could say split half inch and rip three and a half.

Speaker 4  20:51
Yeah, you're doing both. You're sorry telling me it's three and a half, right, right?

Matthias Miller  20:57
Yeah, exactly. Tell the guys to read the sheet, as George says,

Unknown Speaker  21:03
716 shouldn't it, right? When

Speaker 5  21:07
we do it, the gang sold 716 when we do it on the splitter, it's half inch, because we can yield half inch rather than, I mean, I could do it 716

Unknown Speaker  21:16
but it's gonna be, I didn't know that. Okay, yeah,

Speaker 5  21:19
if I do on the gang sold seven sixteenths. If I do it on splitter, it's half inch that just gives them stronger, yeah, stronger power

Speaker 1  21:26
doesn't need to be half inch, but you're doing it anyway, just doing it right, yeah?

Speaker 5  21:33
Alright, Matt, let's do our next 10, if we can do one more.

Unknown Speaker  21:40
Yep, yeah, man, okay, I hear,

Unknown Speaker  21:54
Well, I just do MX 10, right?

Unknown Speaker  22:00
That's all we've been always working on.

Unknown Speaker  22:04
All right,

Speaker 1  22:10
so 60. So what we're saying now is that we're going to say, we're going to say, this is 60. I gotta change this number.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
That's the

Speaker 2  22:24
amount we're going to put in the amount of random that we want for the item.

Matthias Miller  22:31
Yeah, and you don't have to, well, then you need to adjust the quantity down, down to one,

Speaker 1  22:35
right? We're going to do that. We're always going to, well, well, the system,

Matthias Miller  22:39
the system doesn't care, but I can understand why. This makes more sense, okay?

Unknown Speaker  22:44
And if you're, yeah, yeah, all right, you lost me.

Speaker 2  22:51
You can say 40 times one, one and a half times 40, right? And it'll give you the same results. But

Speaker 5  23:01
now you're dragging the you're dragging that random, and you're dragging the three and a halfs out of the same random, right? So is that going to generate like the CW three did generate two different ones, right? You're going to have two different categories,

Speaker 1  23:15
alright? So we need wait. We're on three. Let's go to the rant. Let's start with the random. There we go. So we need Matt just

Speaker 2  23:25
if you care, you probably remember this. Some some of the pallets that we do, some of the items we do, the random width spacing, can be as far apart as like, 10 inches or more. So you could have 120 124 inches is tempo or something like that, with like 10 inch spacing. So you don't want 120 inches of RAM. So George is gonna maybe throw in like 60 inches of random, or 70, or whatever he decides. And we'll roll with that, you know. So this, I like this because if it's a solid top, we always put the same dimension as the typically the stringer, whatever the random is, and then you're dividing by 40 and

Speaker 1  24:17
it's covered, all right, yep. So thickness, half width, 6048

Matthias Miller  24:27
but then this is yielding random width. So right,

Speaker 1  24:31
right, that is correct. Boom, one, half layers, half around at 4862 um, raw material, one by random width, by fleeing hardwood, you can leave them accessing, I don't care how you do that. It gives it a space, yeah, not so long. Wait. Yeah, we do.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
I. Yeah, multiplier,

Unknown Speaker  25:03
l and m, this guy come out half.

Unknown Speaker  25:09
So one yield dimensions.

Matthias Miller  25:15
So one should,

Unknown Speaker  25:20
that's pretty good. One by Ram number.

Unknown Speaker  25:22
Should that say 660?

Matthias Miller  25:24
Let's say 60. That's a good question.

Unknown Speaker  25:29
Should I save it? Save it.

Matthias Miller  25:35
Should it say should it say 60?

Speaker 1  25:40
Well, no, oh no, it shouldn't. No, it should. Well, wait a minute, that should say one, wait, okay, we didn't change this. Hang on, I

Unknown Speaker  25:54
didn't change this.

Unknown Speaker  25:57
Saw one yield is one inch. I

Matthias Miller  26:03
No, that's, you change the you change the main yield. Main yield is half inch.

Speaker 1  26:08
Okay, I did change the main yield point five, right?

Matthias Miller  26:13
George. And then scroll down. This guy, yields, saw one yields, one inch. That's, wouldn't it be one

Speaker 1  26:22
at 60 dimensions? Layer, yeah, okay, one and a half layer. Sorry, what's that?

Matthias Miller  26:27
Matt? Wouldn't this one yield one inch by one? One inch by 60?

Unknown Speaker  26:32
Saw one, yeah, yeah. Random width. I

Matthias Miller  26:47
so your yield thickness, that's what's wrong. Yield thickness is wrong. And also your width is wrong because you change your quantity up above two, and you need to change this to 60. So now This yields a three quarter layer,

Speaker 1  27:08
yes, of one by random width, but 48 good salt, two splitter muscles, looks about half inch multipliers too

Unknown Speaker  27:22
looks good.

Unknown Speaker  27:30
Half a three and a half five pieces,

Unknown Speaker  27:42
not random with

Unknown Speaker  27:45
raw material.

Unknown Speaker  27:47
What will, sorry, the yield, but the yield on,

Unknown Speaker  27:51
no. Not random, no.

Speaker 1  27:53
The end goal, this, this random with checkbox is what we want at the end if I want, I want the three and a half so I want out of random. But if I check this, it changes it to random

Unknown Speaker  28:14
with instead of three to half trip.

Speaker 1  28:18
So leave that unchecked boxes here too. So this box just has to do with the end yield, normal, terrible scene, hardwoods, split half inch on the L and M SAW one yield dimensions. That's not right. So that's one inch one. So one yield is random width, 122,

Unknown Speaker  28:56
okay, make a split half inch up. Yep.

Matthias Miller  29:10
Should be good. Okay, so the final just a sanity check the calculations, the final yield is five times three and a half, which is which is point four, four layers and be and before the splitter, you'll get point two. Two, yeah, boom.

Unknown Speaker  29:35
That's to be good, all

Matthias Miller  29:37
right. Did you want to take that one all the way across the cut list. Are you good? You happy?

Speaker 1  29:42
Well, yeah, let's, is it okay to take it across?

Unknown Speaker  29:47
Yeah, all right, let's, do

Matthias Miller  29:51
you get the you get to, you get to completely destroy whatever, anything in there. It doesn't matter. That's the fun thing. Oh, well, the downside is you'll have to read. Do these changes in the live system then, so

Unknown Speaker  30:05
we gotta find an order first,

Unknown Speaker  30:11
check the box.

Matthias Miller  30:24
Oh, it's if you hit Control F in here, 10, yeah, oh, there you go. There you got it, an old one here, nice,

Unknown Speaker  30:36
huh,

Matthias Miller  30:38
yep, good. See if you can

Unknown Speaker  30:42
wait, generate,

Unknown Speaker  30:44
go back here. Maybe it'll work generate,

Matthias Miller  30:50
all right, see if it lets you do it. It won't let you do it because here I'm gonna go,

Speaker 1  31:05
I'm gonna let me get let me get current here. We'll get there. There'll be something in here. Or maybe not wait, maybe, maybe not hit control one use. I won't remember that shortcut, but I should, yeah, I should. That's terrible.

Matthias Miller  31:27
We have to let me let me go. Let me go. Uncheck those mark mark those is incomplete. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  31:45
Let's see

Speaker 1  31:56
MX, 10, 930, 80715, 80715,

Speaker 6  32:07
you start with Friday lunch. That's what he was talking about. He thinks he can finish. Wait a minute,

Matthias Miller  32:16
what's the you said that makes 10. He

Unknown Speaker  32:22
thinks he can finish on Friday,

Speaker 1  32:26
seems good to you, and then not not hire anybody right now, because

Speaker 4  32:33
if he puts Brian on with oz, he's going to blow his wrist up. That's my downfall of that one, because he already did it two weeks ago, with running with Army, or Simon holding the army one here.

Unknown Speaker  32:48
What's Brian doing right now?

Matthias Miller  32:53
He's done okay, move off the Row and then click back on the row. Okay. You okay, there you go. Now you can send

Unknown Speaker  33:04
it over. Okay,

Matthias Miller  33:08
so this one is for the 14th. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:14
all right, sorry, nine, yeah, that's

Speaker 7  33:16
right, 1014, 1014 Then then

Unknown Speaker  33:32
20

Unknown Speaker  33:34
I have 2010 there's, there's,

Speaker 1  33:42
wait, did it change? Did the state change on it? Matt

Matthias Miller  33:46
shouldn't, and I shouldn't have.

Speaker 4  33:56
Should be no in there, because it's not, it's not that it

Speaker 1  34:02
wasn't sent over yet. Well, I don't know the next 10

Unknown Speaker  34:06
it shouldn't be because you didn't generate or you didn't

Unknown Speaker  34:11
add it to that see, include computer,

Speaker 3  34:19
no, um, that order was

Unknown Speaker  34:28
1014, but here, I mean, there's other ones

Matthias Miller  34:35
confused. We check something. I

Unknown Speaker  34:46
You didn't add it to Cutler shit, social media, yes, unscheduled.

Unknown Speaker  34:55
Element, element.

Unknown Speaker  35:04
We're trying to make this thing do something that

Unknown Speaker  35:08
never done before.

Matthias Miller  35:11
I'm confused where this guy is.

Speaker 4  35:19
Sure one across, wow. Here it is. Was 80715,

Matthias Miller  35:33
okay, I just reran it and it send it over.

Matthias Miller  35:45
So if you go back over to the I don't know, I don't know why, right here,

Speaker 2  35:55
does it need to be highlighted for me to send it over? Yeah, and

Unknown Speaker  35:59
it's not so,

Matthias Miller  36:01
no. I mean, no, it has to be income. I mean, it can't be complete for you to send it over, or there no part of it can be completed, which is, I don't know what happened. I I just sent it over again on my end, and it went, so it's over there. Now, I don't know why it didn't go the first time. Refresh. Now, no, if you go over, go to the cut list. It's on the cut list. Now, okay,

Unknown Speaker  36:27
sorry, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  36:31
there we go. All right.

Unknown Speaker  36:39
There we go.

Unknown Speaker  36:47
Yes, done,

Unknown Speaker  36:58
wait, done, oh. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  37:07
schedule that right, yep.

Speaker 2  37:18
Okay, where's 1014, order? It's gonna be right down. There's that 520, again, that's interesting. Here we go, one by random width, clean, hardwood, three layers, one inch by random width, eight layers, good. Bottom, maybe, here we go, 50

Unknown Speaker  37:48
raw materials, right? 50, half 348,

Unknown Speaker  37:52
15 layers, half per random with 48

Unknown Speaker  37:56
Perfect. Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:01
cool man. Any questions?

Unknown Speaker  38:05
Alright, Matt, so

Matthias Miller  38:09
should I take this live tonight? Is that good? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:15
all right, that's great.

Matthias Miller  38:17
Good stuff.

Speaker 5  38:18
That one other question, Matt, when I was doing some new stuff the other day, when you go to, like your cants, say it's the brewer, then it's a three and a half, a six, then It's,

Unknown Speaker  38:34
let's see this one.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
Gotta get out here. I

Unknown Speaker  39:31
eight. John has a

Speaker 5  39:41
like, if I scroll out and do the brewer, then the three and a half, 812, 12 foot, and then go one hour that was sawing, that was doing that you need to find. Often what was in the sign? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:38
I'm not used to laptops, as you can see, I like my mouth.

Speaker 5  40:49
So if I do, if I scroll out and do inch and seven, three and a half cutbacks, can tech? What was I doing that? I had that,

Speaker 5  41:08
oh, like, if I hit tab, it keeps going across the board. But then when it got to certain, certain thing, like the, now, I had orders of that. Can tech here if I hit the toolbar, not one, right?

Speaker 5  41:36
We'll say that was empty at the can tech, when I hit the toolbar, when I hit the space bar, it brings up the the selections that you can pick, and you can type in like CA, and then can tech pops up. And then you can enter it. Yesterday, when I was doing that, it the space bar would not you mean, almost had to hit the space bar pretty hard to for it, to react, to bring that the glossary up for you know, mean, to pick what to choose, what I wanted to choose, okay, and then sometimes it wasn't working. So I didn't know for something with my with my keyboard, or whether that was part of the something.

Matthias Miller  42:25
So I to make some trying it here, it's possible. So in order to make some changes, some of the changes I needed to make on, which project was it, it was it was before the randoms. But related to some of this stuff, redoing some of the cut list changes, I needed to temporarily switch the platform to

Matthias Miller  43:01
the the, let me take a giant step back the software that there's four different versions of the platform. There's the the what developers are working on every single day, which normally works but sometimes has small glitches. Then you have the the the platform that's in QA quality assurance, that they're doing all the testing, and then you have the the platform that's in production and it's been vetted, and there's actually a an even more stable one beyond that, normally, the QA ones good enough, but there were some new features that I needed, that they needed to utilize, so I'm temporarily switching it to the development version for a couple of of weeks. I'm trying to see when this when what I'll be able to switch back so up through next week, actually, I'll be able to switch back and the last week before, like we're at the point of stabilization. So anyway, long story short, there might have been a momentary glitch. I don't know

Speaker 5  44:17
if it keeps it like it happened just a little bit, and then yeah, came back, and it was all right again,

Matthias Miller  44:24
yeah, yeah, it's probably something like that. So normally I try not to not to use that, try not to do that, but just because of the situation I ended up so if it's working now,

Speaker 5  44:41
yeah, run it by and see if it was something on just my keyboard. What seemed like when I really hit the space bar harder, then it seemed like it took a hold, and then it was all right. I had one other one, Matt with this, the going back to splitting this. This one here, the Remy 20 by 48 when we're taking two befores and splitting. I know this one's six once we get past or once we split it. But there's some that like this, will say 11 out here in the quantity. Now, will that say, like, with this new thing you just did, is that, like, if it's five and a half, two buffers would round it off. What rounded up to, like, six, two buffers, you see?

Matthias Miller  45:43
Yeah, I think so. I think it should the

Speaker 5  45:47
force. Remember the one that was 11. Don't forget what, what number that was. This one here is even so one of the 1020 or Melissa's 1020

Speaker 3  45:58
1121, 1121, is 1120 I think so Pretty sure,

Unknown Speaker  46:12
1121 Yeah, space

Unknown Speaker  46:21
was in a dash. I forget

Speaker 3  46:24
Beck. No, it's international. No, I n t

Unknown Speaker  46:30
wait. Maybe it's not 1121,

Speaker 1  46:35
DMP, 1121, that was what was it? 11?

Unknown Speaker  46:43
1020, is even that? Okay?

Speaker 5  46:45
No, because that's an evil, oh, trying to get one. That was the odd. I

Unknown Speaker  46:50
gotcha. I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  46:58
Why not that? Well,

Speaker 7  47:00
maybe Alan.

Unknown Speaker  47:21
Rounded,

Unknown Speaker  47:28
one more time, maybe four.

Unknown Speaker  47:54
Or there it is. So

Speaker 5  47:56
this one here, so it's an oddball. That one there, Matt, that's the one it's like 11. It's going to be elevens, 11 pieces of 11, sixteenths. So to get that, you're going to cut six, two by 440, fives, instead of five or instead of five and a half.

Speaker 6  48:15
So this should say,

Unknown Speaker  48:19
that's what I'm changing. Two inch and a half

Speaker 1  48:22
this should be if I can type in, I guess Matt, is that? Okay? Oh, number. We don't let you do that. What is that point? 6875, I

Unknown Speaker  48:46
There we go, and then

Unknown Speaker  48:51
raw material

Unknown Speaker  48:57
multiplier so One can tech,

Speaker 4  49:00
little split. Five and a half.

Speaker 4  49:19
I'm then there's 16 silver down there.

Unknown Speaker  49:35
So can we find one of those and send it over and see

Speaker 1  49:38
what? Yeah, you only want this to be mentioning

Unknown Speaker  49:42
that's three hands.

Speaker 1  49:44
That's very right, right, right, right, right. That's just right here. I.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
That's right, isn't it? Antichsault,

Unknown Speaker  50:04
one is that or so?

Unknown Speaker  50:08
Yeah, that can go away

Unknown Speaker  50:11
that. Oh yeah, that's on salt too. All

Unknown Speaker  50:14
right. Send

Unknown Speaker  50:16
soul to single head notch, right?

Speaker 6  50:20
All right. We'll save to begin it now we got it, so go to the cut list. Well, can we?

Speaker 5  50:29
We'd have to find so that's a fine in order to send over nothing.

Unknown Speaker  50:37
31 was there. We don't give you

Matthias Miller  50:44
no good. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  50:51
You said 1131 I'm

Unknown Speaker  50:54
not seeing anything. Gonna be a bill load one

Speaker 6  51:48
a dare. 1020 1020 Wait. Oh, that's today, because we've done that already, so we just did it.

Speaker 5  52:01
Are we gonna be that's already done, Matt, so we're not gonna be able let me

Matthias Miller  52:08
take him. Mark him is not done. There you go. Now, off the road, back on the road. Let's see if it shows up.

Unknown Speaker  52:21
Yeah. Try sending that right here. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  52:36
want to see if, mmm,

Speaker 5  52:43
so it's can tax worst or the splitter,

Unknown Speaker  52:47
oh yeah, it's not on them. What

Unknown Speaker  52:54
are we doing before the can tax

Unknown Speaker  52:55
sequence there

Unknown Speaker  52:59
should be down in the nose. It did

Matthias Miller  53:02
not. It's exactly the same thing as last time it took the old one off, but it didn't put the new one on right. Go back and here, let me, let me make a note of this. But go back and just go back and send it over again, And I'll come across a second time.

Unknown Speaker  53:31
Am, 22 school,

Unknown Speaker  53:44
there it is. All

Unknown Speaker  53:56
right, let's go. I'm

Unknown Speaker  54:03
now, that's their first keep on, 1022,

Unknown Speaker  54:11
it should be right now,

Unknown Speaker  54:13
yeah, right here, right there.

Speaker 5  54:19
Or that's this splitter, then you don't need to. Can tack

Unknown Speaker  54:24
the canta plane here the

Unknown Speaker  54:26
bottom those 40 fives and 50 fours.

Speaker 1  54:31
So both of these. Yeah, wait, why was the Oh, only the one against the Springer, right? Only one goes on the splitter. I

Unknown Speaker  54:46
now they sold sounding scalable. I.

Unknown Speaker  55:00
Wait This, Harry, I'm sorry. What's up? Is it

Speaker 4  55:20
this one? Hello, it wasn't 929, no, it was 1022

Unknown Speaker  55:27
on it, right?

Matthias Miller  55:30
Still not

Unknown Speaker  55:32
through the 1022 right there. Oh,

Speaker 3  55:34
that, wait. Is that it?

Speaker 4  55:38
You don't need 50 seven? No, you don't put 50 sevens on the splitter that goes on.

Speaker 6  55:44
What's the possible one? It's 1131 1131

Matthias Miller  55:47
scroll down a little bit. It's not, it's not down below here. If we had sword orders and everything, it might be down at the bottom of the section. Right here,

Speaker 6  56:02
right here. I'm sorry we missed it.

Unknown Speaker  56:07
Yeah, this is, that's right, 30, 311/16

Speaker 6  56:10
we're gonna have 40 fives. So now

Unknown Speaker  56:15
go to the can type, then

Unknown Speaker  56:17
you need 716, 50.

Speaker 1  56:32
Let's still say notch. That's a different one. There you go, 1650, 50.

Unknown Speaker  56:47
Boom, that's right, all right, so you

Matthias Miller  56:56
only make those same changes in the live system. Well, I guess you'll have to wait until the update tonight to put in the random wit stuff.

Unknown Speaker  57:04
Yeah, good man. Good stuff. Yeah?

Speaker 2  57:09
Awesome. So I have another thing to throw at you if you have time. Yep, I do good. Yeah. I think so, yeah, because this is about stock items.

Speaker 6  57:23
Well, just then you'll know what this well. So Matt, there's

Speaker 2  57:30
well for stock items, which is our is our used pallets, 48 by 40 grade eight. I'll go into items. Let me go into items. I

Speaker 1  57:43
items, 48 before the A and B repair. Yep,

Speaker 2  57:55
the stock item. It gets assembled as multiple other items we have. These are items that we take out of a and b repair 4840s, Matt, the question is,

Unknown Speaker  58:14
well, so

Speaker 2  58:15
currently we have to go into orders in I'd have to go into what assembly tracker, and I need to find open orders here, like, okay, for example, Val five is one was not attached to anything. So the way that I attach so George, all the items that we sell, they're repaired to 48 by 40 grade A's or grade B's. They're done in a repair process. They go in there. When John does a work order, he records it as stock. So 48 by 40 grade a slash b is the item. Is what we're calling the stock item. That stock item gets assembled AS VAL five or R, to be custom one or all these, when we sell these. So, Matt, we have to go back. I have to go back into this. What? Sage order? Open New sage order.

Matthias Miller  59:26
Hang on. Give me a minute. Is the Val five set up to be sold as or to be assembled as a yes, it is okay. So you need to, by the way, you might want to go into the live system to play around with

Unknown Speaker  59:38
this. You're right. Right.

Matthias Miller  59:42
You can, yeah, there you go. All right, right here. So, yep, so, yeah, let's go valve five. I'm trying to remember if the assembly tracker filters down.

Unknown Speaker  59:54
Well, let me do this first. Let me do this first. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
Maybe, well, I'm

Speaker 1  1:00:05
going to do it all, so let's just do that show. Completed. Continue.

Speaker 2  1:00:12
All right, so as you see here recent history, everything's been assigned to something. He's he's pushed these over. He's tied them out. But, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
well, let's just open this one. For example,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
they did it on 1020 it's tied out to

Speaker 1  1:00:40
1022 not bad. Wait, they made those new. That's crazy. Valve.

Speaker 4  1:00:50
E, oh, that's

Speaker 5  1:00:55
a pat, too. You're saying for that is, what do you have the marking for

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
repair? Did I thought I had

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
wrong. I did that. I didn't enter the I'm sorry. I'm

Speaker 6  1:01:07
not still here. Here we go, here we go. All right, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:18
Oh, they're not. Wait. Why does this look so funky?

Speaker 2  1:01:27
They're not tied out to anything that's right. So, So Matt, the question is, can we do Oh, can we if, if I know the inventory that's on the floor and I leave, if there's 139 on the floor, I leave those set, can we have the rest of shoot, basically John's asking, Can we have these orders, these sage orders, automatically pull out of stock.

Speaker 1  1:02:21
That opens up a whole bunch of that opens up smaller questions.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30
Sure, so or Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
yeah, no, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
I mean, there's nothing that keeps you from trying to thinking. Do you

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
want it literally automatic with no reconcile process?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:13
I mean, it's a good question. I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
so So, right?

Matthias Miller  1:03:27
I mean, it does it matter? Does it matter which work order it came out of?

Speaker 2  1:03:34
Not necessarily. The only thing that matters is that we account for inventory that we have, but

Speaker 2  1:03:49
yeah, in other words, I don't want to take the last 500 if there's 500 in inventory, I want to go back 500 and then start taking

Matthias Miller  1:04:03
right, go, go earliest, the latest. So here.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
So I guess I didn't, wasn't real.

Speaker 6  1:04:11
It was kind of a quick little side conversation.

Speaker 2  1:04:17
What's the heart about it? I mean, all John has to do is enter it in the stock that's all he says to do.

Matthias Miller  1:04:23
Well, he has to, I think, I think there might be some things here that might be a little convoluted to get to where he went. Well, where he wants, where he needs to go. Like, if you search,

Speaker 2  1:04:33
sorry, what do you a little some things that

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
might be convoluted, complicated, muddy, like, it might not just be a simple straight Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
so here's sorry, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:04:50
So if you it could be useful when you search for something that, like, like, like the valve five, or whatever it was that we also show the repair. Work Orders at the same time.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:05
Oh, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
Well, okay, so to that point,

Speaker 1  1:05:14
Val five, I'm going to just double check it quick down here, bam, bam, bam,

Speaker 2  1:05:25
assembled as 4848 be repaired. Yep, got that. So now we go to

Speaker 1  1:05:32
advanced. Send me tracker.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
Wait, do I need a search? It?

Speaker 1  1:05:44
Well, let me do that. So let's say val five, that's

Matthias Miller  1:05:51
the see, the issue is that it only shows it's literal here, right? Oh, it only shows valve five, but it doesn't show repairs. And

Speaker 2  1:05:59
these are ones that these guys built, these on a machine because he didn't have so what Tina and John have been doing is they're building new ones instead of selling repair ones, which cost us more money,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
which stinks. Yep.

Speaker 2  1:06:17
And they're selling them at whatever price. Val five sold at Jimmy.

Matthias Miller  1:06:22
Anyway, it was price for repairs. So did you know?

Speaker 5  1:06:29
So we're making new for the price of the used. That's not right.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
That ain't right, man. So anyway, so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:44
coupon, Sage invoices.

Speaker 5  1:06:50
Is it because it's set up in there as a used that is generate and used when we make new for Val five,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:58
it said again,

Speaker 5  1:07:01
is it like when you do Val five, is this under a B? Now, when you make new, it's still generating the price of an A B,

Speaker 2  1:07:11
because they're ordering used, and John and Tina are saying, John's saying, Tina, we don't have any so make him new. He just, he has to make new. Then he'll make new

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21
so it should be two

Speaker 3  1:07:22
different. Here's what we're selling, them for $12.23

Unknown Speaker  1:07:29
and then what's a new vowel, five Val.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:34
Five is best, I can tell is so

Speaker 5  1:07:38
you're selling, you're selling about are used for $12 what's a used pal? What's the

Speaker 2  1:07:44
price? There were 10 and 12, whatever she had. I mean, this is probably what she's been charging for a long time as well. Like

Unknown Speaker  1:07:50
a new move would be,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:53
what match 1415,

Speaker 2  1:07:56
I don't know what's the deck boards. I don't know what they're doing, half inch or so. Yeah, probably

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01
1313, and 15, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:08:10
Man, that happens with so many other ones. Anyway. It happens with some of these other ones too. So Matt, back to the point of,

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
do those get pushed over to the cut list the valve pipes when you're building new Yeah. And then George, how do you know whether to,

Speaker 5  1:08:34
well, see they have to. I usually check when I see, like, the one that's really is iron poly 12. It really hits me the most. And I usually check with Tina or John to say, Hey, do we have repairs down at the hog that we don't have to make new so then we don't generate, you know, me, it still generates on the cut list, but then I can just mark it as complete, rather than, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:05
It's 716, an inch of five, which was not our lightest duty. Let's try a 1330,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
what's the same? What's it giving you a price floor there.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
That's 1223,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
so that's new Miller that's repaired

Unknown Speaker  1:09:30
either one.

Speaker 5  1:09:31
So they're both the same price, whether it's used or whether it's mill.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:35
I mean, that's what he's doing, because

Unknown Speaker  1:09:39
what a news should be more than,

Speaker 2  1:09:41
yeah, use correct, right? But they're doing that because they're saying they're not, they don't have

Speaker 5  1:09:45
used we're not doing, I mean, if we're repairing them, yeah, there's some touching mill in it. But when we're doing new we got all nine yards we're sending.

Speaker 2  1:09:53
We need it. We need a 48 before the repair station,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
which we're working. On that

Unknown Speaker  1:10:02
we're going to, yeah, we'll create some. We

Speaker 5  1:10:04
need two different categories here, an, a, b, and then,

Speaker 2  1:10:08
well, and then the new. But what she says is, if they order, they order used. We don't

Speaker 1  1:10:14
have used. We just make them on the machine. And so give them a use. Give them the used price.

Speaker 5  1:10:22
Yes, that's what makes sense. Well, I don't know when it started, but that's what they've been doing for these items, right here. You're saying we're losing money. We're losing money there. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
have money. They're doing like that. So Matt back to sorry, when if I go to assembly tracker exactly, and I search for about five,

Speaker 6  1:11:01
I searched for about five. Dude, dude, it's, yeah, well, this one's a

Unknown Speaker  1:11:13
conundrum, because

Speaker 5  1:11:15
Can we have a, can we have a new and a used column on there that you can pick which one Matt Well, and then have two different prices.

Speaker 2  1:11:28
It. It would no but it would sorry Matt to butt in. But it would be a different it would be a different item code. Technically it should be a different item code.

Speaker 5  1:11:39
So it should be like, like, Val five, A, B, and then Val five would be new.

Speaker 2  1:11:50
You know, you follow what I'm saying. Yeah. I mean, I guess, for the sake of depict, the customer is ordering used, it's up to us to get them used. And we're saying, We

Speaker 5  1:12:02
customer, we don't have use. We're gonna have to make a new one. It's gonna close you a buck 50 more to get the new

Speaker 1  1:12:08
and I guess we're afraid they're gonna go elsewhere, so we just make them new instead. You know what I mean, right?

Speaker 5  1:12:16
And I don't think the quantities, the quantities are, you mean like valve that, or like iron poly, 12.

Speaker 1  1:12:23
Excuse me, here's one that they're ordering. I mean, right,

Speaker 2  1:12:28
it's not 10, 2100, September, 100 July. 200 200 201 Yeah. Two, 225.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
30, maybe. But in the

Speaker 2  1:12:39
last two years, 1950 so that's numbers that we need to know, because, like, that's where, okay, do we want those 4840s from York? Yeah, we could sell them right here. We can sell those things sitting in a manager's meeting. And

Speaker 6  1:12:56
I feel like we can't do it, but we're slow. That's not good, okay?

Speaker 2  1:13:04
So sorry, Matt, we're anyways. This is maybe not a good exam.

Speaker 1  1:13:14
Oh, farm poly 12 would be a better one. Let me go there,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:23
that one's more frequent.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
Oh, eight. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:33
so here,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
see that's only like 3010

Speaker 2  1:13:37
they're making news too. Yeah, on the Viking.

Speaker 5  1:13:41
But I'm saying, look at the quantities compared to that other about five you had up. You told ones, the two is the 300 pounds.

Speaker 2  1:13:50
Well, but there's actually more. Look at this. There's almost 4000 in the last two years. It's a lot.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
So Matt, I can

Speaker 5  1:14:17
so what was your question to this whole process.

Speaker 2  1:14:21
Question that John asked was, Can this, can sage, sorry, can this? Can we have the orders that come in that take from stock, automatically pull from stock?

Matthias Miller  1:14:40
So how do you know if something like Val five is a great example? How do we know if it pulls from stock

Speaker 2  1:14:48
or not, right? That's right, that's my answer.

Matthias Miller  1:14:51
So we can't, I mean, we can. We can streamline the process right exactly, and make it easier, like a one button click. Correct. I don't know something, but

Speaker 2  1:15:03
yeah, yeah, you can do it. I know you. I know we 100% right. We can do it if you need to. It'd be neat to see the inventory. Like, have a window of, hey, what do we have in inventory of 4840s A's and B's. What do we have in inventory on New Holland, 4840s 4830s and the bedsides, those are other stock items. And then we also have

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
what's the other one? George, shoot stock item. How

Matthias Miller  1:15:30
about, how about I slap together a an inventory report? Because I don't think that's that's not complicated, but what if I slap together an inventory report

Speaker 2  1:15:41
of all the stock items, of all the stock items that have been entered on work orders.

Matthias Miller  1:15:47
Yep, and then, and then we can continue the conversation around. We could dig into, I don't know if you want to dig into this, but we could, we could dig into inventory management at some point. Yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  1:16:04
that's good, yeah, no, it's not that hard. Because if I go into assembly tracker right now, let me go home, start over, and I look at the last they flush some stuff. John flushed some stuff through here. Today's the 22nd so right now we're looking at 91 items not resolved. And in those 91 I know there's some of these are

Unknown Speaker  1:16:39
stock items.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
So many New Holland's not resolved. Don't make sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
That makes no sense.

Speaker 2  1:17:05
No, no SAS. These. These are heat treated bin so these are bin size, and that's what this is. These are stock items, right here. These new haul is four new hauls or stock item.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
Sailor, same here.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:23
All right,

Speaker 2  1:17:25
well, this verse is a stock item too. That's a 4840, it's a great B. What do

Unknown Speaker  1:17:37
you do to use a great what do we sell it as? Hopefully, grieve these 1015,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
verse attack

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
he should have. Daniel, 657,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
right, right

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
in my summer order number,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
wrap rate, $108

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
Grade B price, $8 A's 10.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:24
So

Speaker 4  1:18:28
don't know why she put that in as semi tracker, verse notes.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
Two,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:59
410, man, one, positive, four, a so they were Miller.

Speaker 4  1:19:04
That was these ones, right? So that was siege order, number 78919, right? 78919, so, oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
she changed price. This is

Matthias Miller  1:19:37
we get. We don't have good enough. What's the start date for

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44
what's at? Matt, Hello, what's the question? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:19:51
sorry, when do we when can we start trusting these, these inventory. Numbers like we got a bunch of historical stuff that wouldn't be

Unknown Speaker  1:20:07
June, June 23

Unknown Speaker  1:20:11
this year. Yep.

Speaker 2  1:20:13
I mean, that's what we're trying to resolve. Or go 26 June 26 we're trying to resolve everything from there forward.

Matthias Miller  1:20:34
Okay, so if we are

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
talking of relief,

Matthias Miller  1:20:42
how is how are you I'm showing, I'm showing inventory in stock here.

Speaker 5  1:20:51
Let's they're going all week weddings and getting ready for weddings. From weddings.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:01
Alright? Thank you, Miller or not. Miller or not. I

Matthias Miller  1:21:11
mean, I'm seeing, I'm seeing off of the report. I might have missed something, but we're not, we're not close enough to get good numbers. I'm showing you've got 1000 repair like 1232, repairs in stock, the FA 17 a you got 1600

Speaker 2  1:21:31
Well, yeah, then and they're probably not tied out. So I need to get in there and clean up since June 20/23, 26th I need to clean up that inventory stuff, but that's a manual process right now. So if you have a, if you have a framework of a of tracking the stock items and inventory window with all our stock item that'd be cool. But as far as reconciling these orders that are pulling from stock. I don't know why Tina can't just go in there and do that. There's

Unknown Speaker  1:22:05
pretty simple, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:22:08
Well, if there's, if there's a way to that, we need to streamline the process. Let's, yeah, let's figure out what needs to be done. Yeah. Alright,

Speaker 2  1:22:22
boy, I was did Rick send over that spreadsheet?

Matthias Miller  1:22:30
Not yet. I got your sorry. I got your text, never responded, but let me just triple check here, nothing, nothing yet on that, and I'm fine with that other, other thing that you said about the scoring. So that's basically that can be that just needs to be added to the menu that could come across tonight.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:07
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:12
what was that? Again? That's added to the menu,

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
the the numbers for the lumber and assembly numbers. Yeah, so that

Speaker 2  1:23:30
will that be at? Will that be visible? Will that all be tied in? Yeah, we'll see the lumber sales and the assembly.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:43
Do you want to

Matthias Miller  1:23:44
sorry, yeah. I mean, and should we, should we take a look at that in any way?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:51
Yeah, can I look at it? Can we look at it? Go to

Matthias Miller  1:23:53
go to favorite, go to folders on the left. Do um, proposed daily production, the top one there,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:07
right here. Yep,

Speaker 2  1:24:11
continue. Oh yeah, our week is Wednesday. But, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:24:21
right Wednesday to

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
no, sorry, sorry, Thursday to Wednesday,

Matthias Miller  1:24:27
Thursday, Wednesday, that's right, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:24:39
this is good. But did you not have, I guess the one of the questions would be, is the it's not showing any lumber sales. Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
No.

Matthias Miller  1:24:53
So what can you what would what did you have a lumber item that we would have sold? The last few days, last week,

Speaker 5  1:25:07
will be fat travel, 39 inch boards. We just shipped them yesterday.

Speaker 4  1:25:15
Fabre, yeah, here. Okay, so 20/21,

Speaker 1  1:25:27
right here. Fa, 501 yep, right there is one map.

Matthias Miller  1:25:32
Fa, 501 okay, let me go to in. FA, hang on, 501 a, i,

Matthias Miller  1:25:53
got it so lumber only is so we should the lumber only. Number should include material only and cut list only. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:08
Mean, yeah, I'm just

Unknown Speaker  1:26:13
trying to think of which items are cut list only. Like, what? Why did we

Matthias Miller  1:26:21
I mean, apparently these need to be cut. That's the bottom

Speaker 2  1:26:23
line, right? But when we say only,

Matthias Miller  1:26:27
well, I mean, if they're assembly, obviously they're going to show up on this the assembly. If it's non material, that's not production, if

Unknown Speaker  1:26:35
it's right,

Matthias Miller  1:26:37
if it's

Speaker 2  1:26:38
are we checking that category in the Items page, cut list only, are you? Are you doing that? George, on any new, new one? Yeah, nothing exists, not historically. So I wonder what this does this one even? Can I open this here? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:26:55
part of the part of the issue is

Unknown Speaker  1:27:00
you can open it. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:27:07
I mean, that makes sense to me. Oh, yeah. Cut list, yeah. So that's my and I just I didn't realize we need to ask from slink action, sub pain,

Speaker 7  1:27:22
all right, here non material and material.

Speaker 5  1:27:33
So you're saying there should be a category number cut list.

Matthias Miller  1:27:39
Okay, go back to the go, back to the report that you'd open, and we should be good. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:27:58
Yeah, does that look like about are those numbers about right?

Speaker 2  1:28:03
Can we do the weeks and then I'll compare to Rick's. Let me check.

Matthias Miller  1:28:10
Can I get a drop for something else?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:19
So let's that's fine.

Speaker 2  1:28:23
How well can I change this a week thing? Or is that? No, okay, that's fine. It's, you could say, Pay Period of

Speaker 1  1:28:39
Thursday, and then it ends on two, Wednesday, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:45
pay week, pay week,

Matthias Miller  1:28:49
pay week of Thursday, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:53
all right,

Matthias Miller  1:28:54
sorry, out of time, you're good, man. All right, sounds good. Yep, thanks.
