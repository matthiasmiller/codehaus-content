Unknown Speaker  07:15
Hey, how's it going? Good? How are you

Unknown Speaker  07:25
good call, yeah,

Matthias Miller  07:29
talking to Bob the thermal spray guy. I don't know if you remember

Unknown Speaker  07:33
hearing about him. Yeah. All right, and spray guy.

Unknown Speaker  07:50
Alright, so here's the

Unknown Speaker  07:59
markers. I don't know how to do this without.

Unknown Speaker  08:03
Burning this

Matthias Miller  08:06
to the ground and starting over.

Unknown Speaker  08:09
I actually don't think Well,

Unknown Speaker  08:13
I think it's just it.

Speaker 1  08:22
If you only did sanctuary stuff, it kind of is like life coaching,

Unknown Speaker  08:30
and

Unknown Speaker  08:33
you have this whole other side of you, right? So I almost think, and I don't you know that's just something you'll have to figure out, is how to include

Speaker 1  08:53
this spoken the spoken Truth. But I imagine if you're an advisory role coaching, that opens up conversations to talk about, like a whole life approach to business, and, you know? And, yeah, I mean, I, I think it's, it's a certain it's, it's a really unique ingredient.

Speaker 1  09:33
I think it's polarizing. I think some people love it, some people won't, yeah, so like, my part of me is like, Well, do you do do the business side of things, and then traditional business side of things, and then what happens if they're like, not a fit for the sanctuary side? Well, you don't want to be in trap. In that kind of relationship with a business. So there has to be a way of figuring out upfront is this? Is this a client who needs an advisor to the leadership, who is coachable and open to just like letting go of control, like whatever, whatever, letting you take the lead, even if it's out of their out of their known experience, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:45
well, I mean

Matthias Miller  10:49
openness To experience is one of the word precedence of intelligence.

Matthias Miller  11:04
And wisdom, sure. I mean, I think that pulls it good. That's

Speaker 1  11:15
part of what I I like about the in person stuff, because you get a different layered experience when you're in the room with someone

Matthias Miller  11:31
well, and It's Yes,

Speaker 1  11:39
yes, and I think it's easier to for people to open up and trust if, like, we had lunch together. Like, a big reason why I like my house church is we eat together, like we break bread together. Like, yeah, that's I'm not just my relationship isn't just a an activity time slot, but like we

Unknown Speaker  12:15
Yeah,

Speaker 1  12:23
so, so you said, you said something about burning it to the ground, like underproof you or what? What do you say?

Matthias Miller  12:37
And the only thing that burns and keeps burning as the Alcohol

Unknown Speaker  12:46
the

Speaker 1  12:59
I still feel like it fits perfectly, because second in command, not taking second place, taking second place. I need to pull this up. Okay, I was just reading this from Mandy. This is a quote from one of her business clients, Sean buck, from the newsletter Pro I thought, I thought in the beginning that what I really wanted was this lifestyle business where I could make 100,000 bucks a year and just coast through life. The reason I thought that was not because I actually wanted that, but because I wasn't having the success I wanted. So I made myself feel better. There's there's 40 per there's 40 proof,

Unknown Speaker  13:55
right? And like,

Speaker 1  14:00
so that's taking second place, right?

Unknown Speaker  14:09
That's why I feel like Second. Second candidate is like, hey, you've you've rightly taken your role. You're rightly pursuing after the courageous thing that's the 100 proof. So I think 100 proof and 40 proofs totally fit in into the second in command,

Unknown Speaker  14:35
that's for sure.

Unknown Speaker  14:37
Have we oversimplified this? I uh,

Unknown Speaker  14:44
have we? Or how do we

Matthias Miller  14:45
have we? So, what if second in command is the campaign. Okay, so one of the things John mentioned was, what if we have, I mean, this, this could be a. A big network effect, connect founders with second second commands.

Unknown Speaker  15:10
Down the road. Are we sure like a recruitment,

Matthias Miller  15:17
right? Some, some form of matchmaking, matchmaking, yeah, recruitment, hiring, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  15:30
So,

Matthias Miller  15:37
because there is a need for 100 proof at the owner level, there is a need at the two IC level. There's a need at the cultural and team level. And I don't know how to tie these pieces together. I maybe

Speaker 2  16:00
what

Matthias Miller  16:07
we were talking about yesterday is this just the

Unknown Speaker  16:11
the bridge,

Matthias Miller  16:14
fast, fast path to cash and but the grand vision is, and always will be, 100 proof. Because I think the one thing, okay, the one thing that doesn't communicate is not communicated within 100 proof is, is all of the business side of things,

Matthias Miller  16:50
which we do touch on A bit in the collaborative strategy, I think. But I

Unknown Speaker  17:13
a musical. I mean,

Speaker 1  17:14
like, I still think 100 proof, 100 proof mastermind, like whatever, like all that can still fit. I just think that the the name, the name identification, is so strong with second in command. I

Speaker 1  17:45
i was i literally, it was uncanny. Last night, I was reading something, and I literally came across a second in command, and then the person was referring to their, I forget it was their lieutenant, right? Like it was just, I like, that's the limbic system, or that's the No, our reticular activated system.

Speaker 1  18:28
Um, were you saying you don't need to move off of Matthias

Unknown Speaker  18:33
right now, name domain.

Matthias Miller  18:38
I'm not sure what I'm saying. I guess one of the things I'm saying is second in command. And at the point that we say, we're not just working directly with the second in command, but we're working with CEO and COO, right, which is okay, so then this is starting to sound eerily familiar to what Cameron Herold is doing. How do we draw a sharp differentiation? Let's say says we're not him. Well,

Speaker 1  19:16
that's, that's 100 proof sanctuary. This. These are very different concepts that have nothing to do with

Matthias Miller  19:28
I mean, if you want the tactical how to run the company, go talk to him. Oh, is that the idea? Oh,

Speaker 1  19:36
no, you can still have tactical. That's strategic collaboration.

Speaker 1  19:46
Like, I'm just saying, Look, I so something, there was, there was some, I think it was the the guy you, maybe you've heard this, the guy who was in. Hid the windshield wiper was taken to court, and the whole thing was like, hey, like, you didn't really invent this. Like, you just, like, these are all common parts, blah, blah, blah. And he's like, and what, what he did was he took a he took he opened Tale of Two Cities, and he started reading. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. And he's like, you know, everyone's heard these words. It's the arrangement of the words that makes it unique, and his case was resolved. Like, I think even if you have, like, that's just a practical dimension, it's a business side. There's a way of doing business. You're going to use your language. You don't need to read his book, right? So don't, don't read his book. Say, I've never read your book. And if you want, you can unfriend him on LinkedIn.

Unknown Speaker  21:21
But, but I, I think

Speaker 1  21:27
I, here's, here's another way of thinking about this is distinctions get sharpened over time. The more you the more you lean into work, the more you craft your own way of doing things, right? So that's something I'm trusting. It's like, I'm trusting I'm not going to be just a Josh invitation. Or I'm trusting like, and I don't, I think I am, but like, I don't realize just by being me, I'm different, right? Like, I even if I can't name, even if I don't know what it is, I actually bring something different and so, like, it'd be weird if you did a CEO coo Alliance, right? But,

Matthias Miller  22:23
yes, but, or even if I called it a second in command Alliance, like there's other names, it's a, it could be 100 proof, yeah, you know two, I see you know, whatever

Speaker 1  22:40
it could be the year collective, whatever. So,

Unknown Speaker  22:43
okay, hang on

Matthias Miller  22:50
this. This is, I'm not a lawyer, but this rings a bell. Um, nor is chatgpt A lawyer, but generic terms cannot be trademarked. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:04
yeah, oh, I could have told you that.

Matthias Miller  23:08
So the only reason he has a trademark is because he's, it is the name of a specific podcast, yeah? But it's, it's,

Speaker 1  23:15
you can trademark your business. That's, that's never been an issue in my mind.

Matthias Miller  23:30
Well, let me ask Kerry today for trademark, okay, unless you think the generic argument is strong enough to just go for it.

Speaker 1  23:37
I No, no, you still need a business DBA. Like, I mean,

Matthias Miller  23:43
I can do a DBA, and I would think it would be something like second in command, blank, like, if you do a DBA, it's a it's not just second in command. It might be second in command.com,

Speaker 1  24:06
I'm not, I'm not following. It's just the isn't DBA, just the company, name,

Unknown Speaker  24:10
brand name,

Speaker 1  24:14
well, that's just like mine being in the zone or Josh's bottle.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
But that's right, like

Speaker 1  24:24
and by the way, even if you you can't, I don't think you can't trademark. At least the people I've helped with getting the wording trademarked is much harder than the the visual, right, but anyone can do. You can trademark the visual any way you want, right, even if it's a common use term, if I think you. Can you can have a because that becomes your brand identity.

Unknown Speaker  25:06
So,

Unknown Speaker  25:08
like, like, I'm pretty sure,

Unknown Speaker  25:22
yeah, I

Matthias Miller  25:34
Okay. Then that, here's the other potential liability. Is he is a Canadian, Iran, but the cease and desist because it's creating confusion, and people think they're getting one thing, but they're getting another.

Unknown Speaker  26:00
Wait, what?

Speaker 1  26:08
To me, it's, it's, if he did, he maybe his trademark is only for Canada, right? You share your screen.

Matthias Miller  26:24
Um, well, it is only prepared. I know that. But what are the

Unknown Speaker  26:35
what are

Matthias Miller  26:41
with the intention to confuse. Essentially, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be a trademark violation, but it's more of,

Unknown Speaker  26:51
can you go? Can you go to that section? I

Speaker 1  27:08
Okay, well, his brand is his name.

Unknown Speaker  27:14
Do you see? Right?

Unknown Speaker  27:17
He doesn't have

Matthias Miller  27:20
a second versus a book, right in the podcast, it's not a brand.

Speaker 1  27:27
You see, there's no and if you wanted, he could have created a signature. Is it called a sign mark, trademark for the second in command visual. But that means you could use a different visual, like, it's not, it's it's, he, his brand. That's, that's, if you took his name

Unknown Speaker  27:48
and created something out of it, that'd

Matthias Miller  27:51
be a little worked, all right. Well, I'm talking, we have a we have office hours in 25 minutes, which is simply because, so I'll bring that then. Okay, so imagine, so putting all this stuff together, second in command.com, and there's two paths, enter the CEO or enter the person in command, enter the second command, and, then there's also the, maybe the 100 proof story. Goes back to the generic story, like, this is my story. Maybe there's a manifesto.

Speaker 1  28:30
Yeah. It works. It works whether you're the business,

Matthias Miller  28:35
right, and you go this. And then there's three levels, first in command, second in command, and, and company wide, team or company wide,

Speaker 1  28:44
yeah, individual, that's natural, yeah, yeah. It really is just positioning it under second and command. And I actually think it it brings more focus to the messaging, right?

Matthias Miller  29:02
Well, it allows you to take the 100 proof and target it at a once again, we've said the 100 proof is the is the recipe and the procedure, not the results. The results is high functioning. Second command, yeah, I,

Speaker 1  29:15
I might, I think the core we're in agreement with second in command as the foundation. I might have different ideas about what the pathways in are. I think it's worth discussing if you you just target CEOs like your version of unleashing your second in command,

Unknown Speaker  29:42
right? Well, I

Matthias Miller  29:44
think it can be very easy, like there's a small subset of I think, well, this is true of, I'm going to start walking back office. I.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
You can call me,

Matthias Miller  30:02
or I can use the amount here, which to your preference. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:05
go ahead and call me. Okay. Okay.
