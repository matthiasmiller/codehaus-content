Matthias Miller  00:28
See if that works. Can

Unknown Speaker  00:29
you hear me? Yes, I can, All right, awesome.

Matthias Miller  00:35
Well, I have, I have a Google script ranking, seeing if you can pull in all your HubSpot stuff. So I still don't know for service is going to be a go or not, but I'm going to give it a shot. All right. So let's go into I'm

Matthias Miller  01:09
settings here I'm

Unknown Speaker  01:23
all right, so all

Matthias Miller  01:31
this stuff comes from your account, so we're good.

Matthias Miller  01:40
Got the brand details, volume, standard, okay, so

Matthias Miller  01:56
do you have, do you have a use case description you want to use?

Matthias Miller  02:09
Believe we've used this one in the past?

Speaker 1  02:14
Product Information? Yeah, that that sounds about right

Matthias Miller  02:19
here. I'm going to copy and paste this stuff over and we can customize. I'm

Unknown Speaker  02:53
any thoughts on that that looks good,

Matthias Miller  03:01
right? How do leads consent? All right, so

Unknown Speaker  03:12
let's do

Speaker 1  03:14
that one is not compliant, okay, so, but if you go back and click Get a Quote, there we go. That is a compliant,

Matthias Miller  03:31
compliant form, okay, so visiting, then they check a box from send view Build. Oops, send view builders To

Matthias Miller  03:52
just going to, I'm

Matthias Miller  04:30
let's make sure that these work. Look

Speaker 1  04:37
at that. Yeah, I updated those this past week, we didn't have a terms and conditions. We did have a privacy policy, but I found out that the privacy policy did not include anything about SMS, so I updated it.

Matthias Miller  04:55
Good. Let's see it's the archive. A Privacy Policy Link. Let's just run through this. Make sure we're not missing did you go through these documents here? Make sure that

Speaker 1  05:12
I did. I did go, go through about a lot of it. I most of it was what I was already working on it. That's where I found out some more about the the Well, I went back to check the privacy policy, and that's where I also found the other one about the terms and conditions. And I'm like, well, better just put it on there. It doesn't just rather have it. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:43
it's it's better to be it's better. They like it better when we go above and beyond. And I think especially, there's been so much I don't know, like, I mean, man, you can really, if you get a good SMS campaign, you can really make it crank, but the FTC is kind of, anytime there's a good marketing channel, all the bad marketers are in it for everybody else. So, yeah, user content, user consent.

Speaker 1  06:30
Terms and conditions, page must be public to accessible. Yeah, that was one of the things that I hadn't

Unknown Speaker  06:39
requirements. I

Unknown Speaker  06:54
I'm Here You're

Unknown Speaker  10:17
What did it say about the third party?

Matthias Miller  10:22
I um, look for flag word, sell, share, affiliate, third party and vendors,

Unknown Speaker  10:31
right, our privacy policy

Matthias Miller  10:35
may include links third party, well, that's fine, though. Vendors, I don't think that's

Unknown Speaker  10:54
I don't think that matters. See,

Speaker 1  11:05
okay, I'm going to so the privacy policy does also does not mention sharing with third party.

Speaker 1  11:18
We do not sell or rent your personal identifying information any third parties I

Matthias Miller  11:57
it's A much more usable one. Me send you.

Matthias Miller  12:08
There's that one. The carrier rejoined. Okay, this is

Speaker 1  12:22
okay. I know what it means. There your SMS section

Matthias Miller  12:31
near the Oh, this one should be on the form, I'm guessing, where, by providing your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from

Matthias Miller  12:57
like on the this would go on, I now hang on, that's fine.

Speaker 1  13:09
I couldn't make it clickable right beside the somehow, when I was on my form, I couldn't make it clickable right there by the checkbox. That's why I inserted them right below.

Matthias Miller  13:23
That's fine. I think the privacy policy link might be on the terms of service, but I'm not completely

Unknown Speaker  13:28
that's, that's What, that's what I was

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Privacy Policy. I

Unknown Speaker  13:54
team i

Speaker 1  14:25
Here it is, I think it says, See privacy policy, but it doesn't actually

Unknown Speaker  14:32
see our privacy policy.

Matthias Miller  14:37
I'm sending over the terms and condition changes that they want to see the biggest one on the contact form, I think, is matching whatever name you have in the terms and conditions of whatever your program is called. So. Send you sheds alerts or whatever the send view builders alerts or,

Matthias Miller  15:13
I don't know how important that one is

Unknown Speaker  15:21
from sending Miller spells, the

Unknown Speaker  15:32
Okay,

Speaker 1  15:36
these confirmation texts, we can build those into go high level. I don't have a well. I do have a way to do an HubSpot. I can do those yet, but

Matthias Miller  15:50
I don't know how. I don't know if they confirm this stuff. I think it's a little bit who you get, reviewing your stuff, potentially. Yeah, I haven't. I haven't had others go super, I mean, I haven't had reviewers appear to go super, super deep. But,

Unknown Speaker  16:15
okay, oh, let's

Speaker 1  16:26
do you need me to put that SunView shed alerts in there?

Matthias Miller  16:31
Sounds to me like it should. Well, let's just

Matthias Miller  16:42
okay. So terms of service requirements,

Matthias Miller  17:02
I think it's best if it does needs to be in the terms of service and then ideally on the contact screen.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
And then that would be like campaign description. It

Matthias Miller  17:21
would be something like from Sun view builders, LLC, and then parentheses, quote, whatever you decide to call it. They call it SunView sheds alerts, but you can call it ship view builders alerts, or

Matthias Miller  17:47
so, whatever name you call your SMS program,

Speaker 1  17:54
like right there on that sun View builders LLC,

Matthias Miller  17:59
and yeah, you do something like,

Unknown Speaker  18:03
let me do this. Something like that marketing.

Speaker 1  18:14
That was why I ended up doing these forms in HubSpot, so that I could modify them, and Then they'll just

Unknown Speaker  18:23
that's on the Get a Quote. I

Speaker 1  18:47
um, you want to, if you want to refresh that screen, that should, yeah, like, just like that.

Matthias Miller  19:00
It's good, okay?

Speaker 1  19:04
And then this one, I am updating the terms and conditions now, that one should be live as well, okay,

Matthias Miller  19:17
and then we shall see. Is there anything more from that? Um,

Matthias Miller  19:31
that's a link. I think the carriers are not liable. Could be let's see Tia. Not necessarily

Unknown Speaker  19:52
carriers. I.

Matthias Miller  20:08
So this line here, the carriers are not liable, line we can put in there.

Unknown Speaker  20:13
Okay, and I'm

Matthias Miller  20:25
saying a little bit about what they're going to get, like the basically repeating, well, this had come up With, I

Matthias Miller  20:45
order, updates, delivery, scheduling and exclusive offers I

Unknown Speaker  21:03
dates and so,

Speaker 2  21:28
okay, okay, refresh it and see if That's that looks good on the terms and conditions. Okay?

Matthias Miller  21:45
Yes, yep, then the only other thing that might be

Matthias Miller  22:02
would be a some kind of The Help clause for help, reply, help or call I.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
Oh, okay, all right,

Speaker 1  22:44
do we need to do the same on the terms, and can I mean on the privacy policy as well? I don't. Well. I

Matthias Miller  23:13
do you have the biggest thing in the privacy policy is that you're not going to share it with third parties.

Matthias Miller  23:28
You will not sell or rent your personal identifier information any third parties.

Unknown Speaker  23:35
So I think that's,

Unknown Speaker  23:41
yeah, this is,

Speaker 1  23:45
we do not sell a rent, yeah, that that does say no Third parties. I

Unknown Speaker  24:10
Okay, I'm

Matthias Miller  24:57
I'm very for the sole prop brand.

Matthias Miller  25:14
It Okay, so, so we should actually potentially

Unknown Speaker  25:30
order updates. I

Matthias Miller  25:47
Well, Let's go back to informational marketing. I'm

Unknown Speaker  26:25
seems like a slightly better

Matthias Miller  26:31
sample message. All right, how do they? Can they consent by visiting.

Unknown Speaker  26:57
Sorry,

Matthias Miller  26:59
some View builders help to

Matthias Miller  27:11
this guy. I'm

Matthias Miller  27:25
A message,

Matthias Miller  27:37
okay,

Unknown Speaker  27:40
we will give it a shot.

Matthias Miller  27:49
So we're gonna have to wait on the brand submission, okay, and then as soon as the brand submission comes back, we'll turn around and do the campaign submission.

Unknown Speaker  27:58
Okay, okay. Very good.

Matthias Miller  28:02
Good, awesome. Cross your fingers. Hope it works.

Speaker 1  28:06
Yeah, the brand one is usually fairly easy to do the we're got, especially on the Twilio when I got the brand one done. But then the campaign one was the one that that they rejected.

Matthias Miller  28:21
I mean, it's, worse because it's a little bit of a black box too. Like, yeah, most sometimes you can see Yeah, Twilio sounds like they were way more thorough in their rejection reasons than yeah past year. But yeah, yeah, sounds good. Well, I will keep you posted on the HubSpot. I'm going to let it keep cranking away and see how far I can get it to crank Okay, and

Speaker 2  28:51
we'll go from there. Okay. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Awesome. Yeah, you bet. Thanks. Mark, okay. Bye.
