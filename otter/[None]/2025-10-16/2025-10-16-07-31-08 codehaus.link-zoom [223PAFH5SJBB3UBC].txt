Unknown Speaker  01:07
Howdy, howdy, I can't ask you, you, Oh, you're on the phone.

Unknown Speaker  01:17
Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  01:21
Good morning, good morning.

Matthias Miller  01:29
Good morning.

Matthias Miller  01:35
In the I was gonna say, you know, Drew b part of the US that I don't know if that's true or not. Anybody have sunshine around there,

Speaker 1  01:51
loads, loads of it. Not a cloud in the sky.

Unknown Speaker  01:54
Look at that. You get snowed under with us.

Matthias Miller  01:59
No, we have rain. It's 53 this morning, so we've one of my friends was was headed out to a roofing job and mentioned they got snow a couple days ago. So it's definitely coming for us.

Speaker 2  02:18
Yeah, we finally have a frost in the 10 day forecast. Or could be, but it could be, I was surprised that we didn't have one earlier. We're close in the 40s, a bunch, or, like, our upper 30s,

Unknown Speaker  02:31
but yeah, I

Speaker 3  02:33
expected you would have a killing for us here. What was it a week ago or so, like, down in the valley? Or you

Unknown Speaker  02:38
didn't have anything interesting? The forecast is showing a lot of like 3435 which could be a thought

Unknown Speaker  02:49
for us.

Matthias Miller  02:54
No, all right. Well, here comes Seth, I could. I think we can. I'm happy to dive in, unless you want to

Unknown Speaker  03:04
something else. We got it clear way, sure. Let's go ahead

Speaker 3  03:12
and get started meeting schedule, if I remember correctly, we said the 23rd if we can, if not, we'll do the 30th. I think it was because Dwayne was looking down me in only one meeting, the only meeting. So are we good to do the 23rd or should we do the 30th?

Matthias Miller  03:41
23rd is good? Is good, and it's still better for me than the 30th. I probably will be getting back late on the 29th I don't mind doing I'm not opposed to doing the 30th if we also need it, but 23rd is good for sure.

Speaker 3  03:56
Okay, what about the seat then I was thinking, if we do the 23rd then two weeks later? Yep, good.

Unknown Speaker  04:02
Good for you. Dwayne,

Speaker 1  04:07
yeah, we our stuff got moved to the 31st instead of the instead of that week so

Matthias Miller  04:15
and then do we want to nail down the 20th? Because that would be the third Thursday as well.

Unknown Speaker  04:22
Sure. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  04:27
and off the 27th I'm assuming,

Matthias Miller  04:31
yeah, I'm gonna guess my my wife doesn't want me working on accounting stuff on that day,

Speaker 3  04:40
if I recall correctly, Dwayne spent most of it in thanksgiving, several years back, working on payroll calculations.

Unknown Speaker  04:49
Wasn't that's a while ago.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
What was the it

Speaker 3  04:56
wasn't it on Thanksgiving, you did a lot of work on pool pay and.

Speaker 2  04:59
All of that. Yeah, yeah, we were

Speaker 3  05:03
down at Peeves place and yeah, very animated discussions about hero calculations and pool pay and stuff. And I think we could have one lesson. Well, I think, I think Seth could have probably cut the time in half had he been in the meeting. He was like, Okay, let's

Speaker 4  05:29
put some math again. I think I was, at that point, I was too willing to build whatever was asked for.

Matthias Miller  05:37
Yeah, that's really true. Probably all, I think all of us were,

Unknown Speaker  05:41
yeah. Well,

Speaker 1  05:43
I think we've all learned a lot since, since that point in life. We design, we design and build very differently since then,

Speaker 4  05:53
that was four years ago, wasn't it?

Speaker 2  05:57
Well, I was gonna say where I was on, because the pool pay a thing has been going as long as I know

Speaker 4  06:04
that was probably because I think I developed that the year before I went to faith builders, and that was 21 to 22 was the year I was back in Kansas before I went to FB.

Speaker 1  06:18
Yeah, but that, that design, sat for quite a while. Oh,

Speaker 4  06:21
so it was probably 2020, then that the design was happening,

Unknown Speaker  06:26
I would say, so probably, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:29
wow.

Speaker 3  06:32
What's always impressive to me, though, is something like that can like now that it's functional and working it just expect, we'll use that design for foreseeable future like it just, you kind of forget about all the the thought and the details that went in to make something like that work. But if it's well built, it just, it just works,

Unknown Speaker  07:00
very true,

Speaker 3  07:05
good. So my thought was to go through the existing projects. I kind of on my agenda. I just were the ones that I think we should look at some quite briefly and just, there's a few I think, well, there's a few that I know we'll spend some time on. And then at the end, you want to look at the two that Aaron has created and send yesterday to get an idea on the size. So,

Speaker 3  07:41
so let's start with with wholesale dealer, Portal, record restrictions.

Unknown Speaker  07:51
That's all done. Dwayne right,

Speaker 1  07:56
don't know that I would say it's all done. I we need. We never got to. I never had. I should have asked Josh on Wednesday whether if his fix for duplicate IDs in the system was fit, was was implemented or not. But I mean, as far as outside of, outside of the duplicate scene, no, it's duplicate

Speaker 4  08:18
IDs, yeah. But sales order and building IDs? Yeah, I think so I'm pretty sure he did that, yeah.

Speaker 3  08:28
How just curious doing? How can that? How can information use thing, affect that or create duplicates?

Speaker 1  08:36
Josh's explanation was that it based on the user. The system doesn't even know these other IDs exist because of the level of restrictions that we were doing.

Speaker 4  08:52
It's a basically, we need to change it. No, I should say we need to change it to when you save a sales order or building and we store the max ID in a system switch that the user can access, that any user can see. And then, when we save our own, then we know, oh, this was the max, even though I don't know that record exists.

Speaker 3  09:17
Seth, are you saying that is done that update, or that, I think

Unknown Speaker  09:21
so. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:23
I'm pretty sure so.

Speaker 3  09:26
Dwayne, should we close this out, or you want to test it, or some, something more than this,

Speaker 1  09:32
I probably should implement it back on retail dealers again and see and see what and see what happens, and see what else breaks. Do. Breaks. It's a it's literally a checkbox, and all the records restrictions are back on again for retail. It's currently on on wholesale dealer portal stuff we were, yeah, retail dealers were the ones that we were using it on as testing. Yeah. Yeah, good.

Speaker 4  10:03
Josh committed his fix on the seventh so that would be the last system.

Speaker 1  10:09
All right, then I, I don't think he ever mentioned that. He that it came live. He said he said he had a fix and that it was supposed to come live. I've just never heard that it did come live.

Unknown Speaker  10:20
It is okay

Speaker 3  10:23
now, now we're okay. The split income statement. I hadn't realized this is live, but this is, I think, one of the most exciting developments we've we've had in the long run, the way and you guys did, I don't know what you did, but it just works.

Matthias Miller  10:41
I tell you what we did. We took an ax and we simplified and cleaned up and simplified and cleaned up, and we simplified and cleaned up, and finally got to something that we didn't hate. So actually, I think we love.

Unknown Speaker  10:57
There you go. Okay, there's okay.

Speaker 3  11:03
I tested since we since my notes this morning, I tested percentage on one, and it's working, just like you said. It is. Did my response make sense on the about vendor invoices?

Matthias Miller  11:19
Yes, that makes sense. I'm good with that.

Unknown Speaker  11:24
So, yeah, the, I guess the

Speaker 3  11:26
only other question I Okay, I also looked at that Mac for that. So sale amount, or whatever you're using to calculate those total so looking at that again, if we go back to the yeah, if you look at an income statement.

Matthias Miller  11:44
Yeah, take whatever this range.

Unknown Speaker  11:48
It doesn't matter, right?

Matthias Miller  11:49
Doesn't matter. Okay, well, we'll do this here. Let's do the did you see the diagnostic?

Speaker 3  11:58
Yeah, I did. That's, that's impressive. I, like, I thought it was pretty cool.

Matthias Miller  12:04
Like, then, then there's like, you can't come blame me for anything. It's like, it just, here's the facts. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3  12:13
Anyway. Okay, so, so if you have unassigned ones, like the building materials. That means that was probably a journal entry or manually create a transaction or something, and so right, split that up by the percentages. Now the one thing that that I think is going to get confusing is and what we've been doing on our spreadsheets when we did this was we on the retail sale and wholesale sale, we simply use the in this case, the total retail 553, and the total wholesale for 95 and I think we want to go back to that, just because otherwise there'll be no end to questions and confusion on Okay, where does this 695, come from? I mean, it's, I think it's essential.

Matthias Miller  13:07
So just basically, all we're doing is pulling these numbers off of the, the off of here, instead of the, instead of the sales orders,

Speaker 3  13:18
yeah, in giving us more thought, I think that's what we want to lose. Because, like the retail we were looking at this, at it this morning, saying 553 and the number we're showing up there is 416 like we would expect that to be about the same. And I think part of the reason is, on our retail site, we're currently showing a 5% or 4.75% sales order surcharge. So it's also so that we could make many arguments to go different ways. But I think just pulling that total number, I'm assuming that's a pretty Oh yeah, change domain.

Matthias Miller  13:55
No, let's see. I mean, that's not it's beyond the scope of doing it. It takes a little too much concentration to do it while we're talking through other stuff. So I can't do it live, but it's not that bad.

Unknown Speaker  14:08
You're saying. It won't even take an update to make this change.

Matthias Miller  14:11
No, I can. I've been skirting the rules, and I can just change the report and push it live. And you can, you can have your your shiny Christmas toy.

Speaker 3  14:22
Did you also skirt the rules on adding this to the income statement on the

Matthias Miller  14:27
because, yeah. I mean, the main thing that I had, I had to, sorry, this is getting into the into the weeds. Technically, this, this list, should have come through in an update, and I just added it manually so that we could have it so it'll it'll all get cleaned up in the next update. So, yeah, it's all good. It's nothing real, real terrible.

Unknown Speaker  14:50
Well, I was just surprised that sort of something this major would require an update. But good. No, I think this is going to.

Matthias Miller  15:00
Be, do we need this preface? Then, if we know, do you want to Okay?

Speaker 3  15:07
Because we we also have the diagnostics where we can break it down and so,

Speaker 5  15:12
okay, sweet, even times,

Speaker 3  15:20
the only improvement we can make to this is having bomber rules and building materials for each building so we can break it down per building.

Matthias Miller  15:30
Well, we need to start talking about budgeting, because we could actually start tying retail and wholesale. I think there's theoretically we could design retail and wholesale budgeting for you if you wanted to.

Speaker 1  15:46
So how does so? Have a question, that the income numbers are reflected in real dollars, but is the percentage is reflected in retail dollars?

Matthias Miller  16:00
I don't understand.

Speaker 1  16:03
Well, retail 574, 520, and 493, are not 62, and 37 percentage

Matthias Miller  16:11
wise. So we are, we are using, so we are currently using sales orders to determine the split, and we're going to start using these revenue line items to determine the split. Is that your question, they're

Speaker 3  16:23
they're using the exact same number you're using on the sales, sales reporting. I

Speaker 1  16:29
think, yeah, that's, that's what I was asking. So, so, essentially, so percentages are using retail dollars and and actual revenue is reflected in actual in actual dollars, correct? Gotcha. Okay, that's, that's, that was my question.

Matthias Miller  16:47
Is actual revenue, right, right?

Speaker 3  16:51
Do you know on the sales, sales reports, like the sales Walmart, we're probably not including that 5% sales order surcharge. In those numbers, are we like, if a dealer

Speaker 1  17:06
Right, yeah, well, yeah, it would be. We don't. We don't. We don't include material surcharge. I don't know that we ever made macros to not include dealer surcharge.

Unknown Speaker  17:21
Okay, okay.

Speaker 1  17:24
Now I mean somebody, somebody with some way deeper access, and I would have to go to look that up, but I'm, I'm kind of sure that we're not, we're not excluding dealer surcharge,

Matthias Miller  17:37
so we have the subtotal without the material surcharge, minus the wholesale discount.

Unknown Speaker  17:58
You're saying, that's what we're doing

Matthias Miller  17:59
now, yeah, we exclude wholesale discounts and material surcharges,

Unknown Speaker  18:03
then that would, yeah,

Speaker 1  18:05
but, but not, but not dealer surcharge. Dealer surcharge is

Matthias Miller  18:10
included, right, right. Doesn't that mean that we're using a proportionally higher number for the retail versus wholesale split. And then if we use total revenue, that will the total revenue includes the wholesale discount, and so, I mean, it shifts the numbers, yes, fairly dramatically. Do you care mark? I mean, is that right?

Unknown Speaker  18:32
But it's but it's real dollars. I mean, it's not right.

Speaker 3  18:36
Okay, about the only place where we split it based on the revenue percentage is in administrative costs, like most of the other areas, like logistics, sales and marketing, or sales and marketing, most companies are 100% retail, like those, right? And so the administrative and that's okay, so how much of the of management wages are used for wholesale or retail, or how much of accounting or the phone bill go to one or the other? So, I mean, you could make a lot of all kinds of arguments, so that's about the only place where we'll use this, and I think it's the cleanest way to do that. Well,

Matthias Miller  19:28
it's sane. I mean, a wholesale requires less management, like, let's just be honest.

Unknown Speaker  19:31
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  19:35
yeah, okay, no. I mean, that's there you go. Does that answer your question?

Speaker 1  19:39
Dwayne wholesale, yes, it answers my question. Wholesale takes less management, unless it comes to Rick Miller, and then all bets are off. To Rick Miller, then it's all bets are off.

Speaker 3  19:54
All right, well, they're if they fall behind on on their AR. I can also,

Unknown Speaker  20:01
well,

Speaker 1  20:02
there, there is that we said, direct, that this is, that's true. This is a bit of an inside joke. Matthias on, on, on, the sheds. Direct, so,

Speaker 3  20:11
so Dwayne, now that you bring that up, has, has Rick already been in the holes in a little portal.

Speaker 1  20:18
No. Robert just sent me this morning the email address they want to use, and I just, I just set that up, but I haven't responded yet. Back to Robert, so not yet.

Speaker 3  20:29
You might set that up until you've got a not so busy day, I expect, right? I imagine you're going to be hounded with all kinds of questions.

Speaker 1  20:40
Oh, probably. I mean, I've got nothing to do over here, so I'll just wait. It's not a

Matthias Miller  20:49
good meeting, until you can quote GK Chesterton, and I promise we'll get back on track. But we're talking about payroll module, and had to think of this. What is there poetical about being in revolt? You might as well say it's poetical to be seasick. Being sick is the revolt. It is things going right that is poetical, or digestions, for instance, going sacredly and silently right. That is the foundation of all poetry. The most poetical thing in the world is not being sick. And I would add payroll module that just works, income statements that just works. That is the foundation of all poetry

Unknown Speaker  21:29
as elegant enough to make a ballerina look clumsy.

Unknown Speaker  21:34
Clumsy, wasn't it? It

Matthias Miller  21:36
was looked like a clutch. Yep, that was the quote

Speaker 1  21:39
you should you should go on, on what page were you just on Goodreads? No, that's not what I was thinking. What's the what's the wiki page? No, I was gonna say you should, you should go up what's the site that has, like, supposedly, like, the definition on everything. You should go put yourself up there and put that quote in there, elegance that that makes a ballerina look clumsy or klutzy.

Matthias Miller  22:08
I am not sure what sites you mean, but it sounds Anyway, yes, find it and text me. Okay, good. That'll be a quick fix. I'll drag Seth through that. I think we're good to

Unknown Speaker  22:21
go. Good. Drag.

Matthias Miller  22:23
Nick, drag, Nick, through it,

Speaker 1  22:24
Wikipedia, that's what I was looking for. You go, but put yourself on Wikipedia with that. With that,

Matthias Miller  22:29
I can't get banned, but you can put me in there.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
So cross linking, Dwayne, I think this is,

Unknown Speaker  22:42
this is done as long as you like.

Speaker 1  22:45
It the, well, I think I asked for some change. Did you? Did we didn't. I asked for a change, and I think you made it.

Unknown Speaker  22:52
Yeah, I think we made it.

Speaker 4  22:59
Besides, if you find a building that has an RT, one prefix sometimes going to look for

Speaker 3  23:04
you look in accounting buildings needing No it's or buildings with vendor invoices and without vendor invoices that's on that report. Find some are missing, yeah, that

Matthias Miller  23:22
big vendor invoices. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  23:26
Sweet on original buildings, yep.

Speaker 4  23:32
Then go to the original STEM. We should change that link it. The link is yes.

Matthias Miller  23:37
Can we please? Alright, so this goes to the Sten, and then you have this has been retrieved as and you go back to the original, same report, good,

Speaker 1  23:47
go to the original or the RIT. I think you did some placement changes.

Matthias Miller  23:55
Okay, here's the original, yeah, here's the retrieved, yeah,

Speaker 1  23:59
okay, good, the original building's in the same place. Now, perfect, yeah, okay, and

Unknown Speaker  24:07
then I will just close it sweet.

Speaker 3  24:11
Now, this retrieval building thing needs a place alongside split income statements and payroll module, the way it just works. I works,

Matthias Miller  24:24
yeah, exactly

Speaker 1  24:26
after, after all the all the pain and agony, definitely

Unknown Speaker  24:33
standardized user report. So that drew looks like you've got the longest list.

Speaker 4  24:40
So Nick was mind blown. How many reports Drew? Has favorited?

Speaker 2  24:47
No, it's one time. A lot of it's one time. Diagnostic stuff, those like this thing, but don't favorite it. So it's not because actually like it so well, it's

Speaker 4  24:59
let me do. Literally archived files in there.

Matthias Miller  25:02
So I think the question is, though, how do we figure out what to what to keep and what to kill

Speaker 2  25:10
so well, my question on this was, is this just everything that I had favorited, or is it, is it just items that I've used frequently or use text aid, or it's

Speaker 4  25:21
just your favorites. We could do more work, how to figure out how stuff is used,

Matthias Miller  25:26
how much work to have, have Nick check app usage or something. It's not bad. It's probably

Speaker 4  25:36
can get decent numbers in 20 minutes. We should either something.

Matthias Miller  25:41
Let's make that be the next step. Number of times used in the last year, and if we have the last use date that would be useful. Well,

Speaker 1  25:48
you could try, you could try my method, and you archive them all, and whichever ones come up screaming that you still need those, the ones you turn back on. Well, I'm not

Matthias Miller  25:55
completely opposed to that. I'm about to archive the whole IFR folder. Yeah. Take?

Speaker 2  26:05
Well, I would say, yeah, if I can see a report for how many times used in the last year, and what the last use date was, because I know there's some old ones that I still use occasionally, but there's some stuff that actually probably is not that old, that doesn't even have purpose anymore.

Speaker 3  26:24
And then what you need from us, I think the steps, while you have them listed up above, is just feedback from us on what, which is using what. And then we'll look at turning some of them. I'm sure some of them will want to consolidate into a single, Standard User report, or not a standard report,

Speaker 2  26:49
yeah. I mean, I know some of mine are, I probably have three versions of the same thing.

Unknown Speaker  26:55
Some of those, certainly something

Unknown Speaker  26:56
was updated and, oh, now I need that one

Unknown Speaker  26:59
personal

Speaker 3  27:12
So, The reporting, yeah, product discrepancies.

Matthias Miller  27:17
So Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  27:21
why are

Matthias Miller  27:24
this is straight up antagonistic, forgive me, why are your people putting credit card payments on sales orders without linking it to stripe? I don't actually know that. It's your people we have here a credit card transaction that's not tied to let's see, it's not that one credit card this guy. Well, I don't know how this happened. We have a credit card transaction that that had. There's a stripe

Unknown Speaker  28:03
system doesn't work for me. It

Matthias Miller  28:09
has a stripe ID, but not a stripe transaction ID. That's interesting. Why did we not get a stripe transaction ID?

Unknown Speaker  28:18
That's the real issue. And here you wanted to blame me. I know

Matthias Miller  28:21
I did. I really, really did. Dwayne, I was just hoping I could put something on your shoulders.

Speaker 1  28:33
Do we have more? Do we have more instances of this? I'm sure we do.

Speaker 2  28:37
That'd be fun to go at least. There was at least two. And I know there's way more than that.

Matthias Miller  28:43
I'm sure there is. So if

Unknown Speaker  28:45
somebody has a list of them somewhere, I'd love to go look through them.

Matthias Miller  28:50
It's real tough, but I think I should be able to pull it off.

Speaker 1  28:54
I mean, not at this moment if you want to do it after the call and shoot it to me, but I would be interested in chasing in, in seeing if we can figure out what's going on,

Unknown Speaker  29:03
define the pattern because they were

Speaker 2  29:06
better list. But that report that I have you can you can see what's likely, but it doesn't mean that it's no it's not.

Matthias Miller  29:20
So it's basically like this, so payment, payment stripe ID, and it's an A so payment stripe transaction ID,

Unknown Speaker  29:39
and then let's reverse. Hope there's not that many.

Matthias Miller  29:43
Well, I mean, they don't matter past a certain point, because we didn't used to pull them in, but there are that many.

Unknown Speaker  29:52
Yeah, hold it,

Speaker 1  29:56
yeah. Something, something goes something is that? Just let's,

Unknown Speaker  30:01
I don't know, but we have,

Matthias Miller  30:04
I don't know what the zeros are. It's cash.

Unknown Speaker  30:09
There's a six this month.

Matthias Miller  30:12
Oh, wait, let's do this. I forgot about this. We putting that in there.

Matthias Miller  30:28
That was a blast from the past. All

Matthias Miller  30:40
right, why aren't you letting me resize? So this is the detail this guy. This should be more like 20. Wow. Something went wrong with the column sizing, okay, but there's still a lot. A lot of them are so

Speaker 1  31:02
I see this, there's, there's an interesting thing that's been happening where we'll get some credit card transaction coming in. Does not give us any fee. And I wonder if it's all all of these are going to come

Matthias Miller  31:12
up. I'm sure it's all of these. It's all of these. No, it's not all of these.

Unknown Speaker  31:18
The second one, the second one is, though, 718, second

Matthias Miller  31:20
one is, yep, this is it. This is it. All right, we are we are on the you know what I'm going to do? You want to see what I'm going to do, I'm going to put in the IAR folder.

Speaker 1  31:34
But, I mean, I guess what would be really interesting is, Boy, I wish you could give me activity history on the who applied the PI?

Matthias Miller  31:46
Yeah, that's not a problem. That's easy, actually. Thank you for asking.

Speaker 1  31:51
It would be that would ask, that would answer a bunch of questions. Real quick, we

Matthias Miller  31:55
went modified field would be so payment, right? With the new value of this and the activity, the record ID of this guy,

Unknown Speaker  32:11
isn't it? Sn.id, yep.

Matthias Miller  32:15
And for sales orders. And then we're going to add this to can we do? I need to switch to plain text view to, yeah. We might

Unknown Speaker  32:26
need to setting I think, Oh, it is

Matthias Miller  32:31
okay. So then here, let's add a sub pane. I

Matthias Miller  32:43
hang on now I can't even,

Unknown Speaker  32:50
oh, that's painful. She hit.

Matthias Miller  33:08
Right? And then this would be begin date is actually, let's just put in,

Unknown Speaker  33:17
actually we could do

Matthias Miller  33:20
that's a creation date, and then this would be, What did i i missed something?

Unknown Speaker  33:30
Nope, not you. I

Unknown Speaker  33:46
Are you and the new value?

Unknown Speaker  33:48
I thought I added it,

Unknown Speaker  33:57
asking news.

Matthias Miller  34:02
I so this would be so, so payment, Stripe, dun, dun, dun, dun,

Speaker 5  34:16
there you go. You happy? I I

Matthias Miller  34:27
see if I can do the formatted view here. Oh, this will always be this view, because it's

Matthias Miller  34:39
good Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  34:42
yep. And where did you put it?

Matthias Miller  34:45
I'm putting in the job right now. Build a report for Dwayne. WILL HUNT FOR patterns here, Dwayne The Hunter, the forensic stripe.

Unknown Speaker  35:00
Analyst, you should, you should drop me that URL, please. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  35:05
Here, I will here, I'll give you this and you got both. You could put your notes in there, whatever you find. Dwayne. Where are you? There you go. All right, good. Have a look.

Speaker 3  35:21
See. Is that the only thing we can do on this right now? Or is the your response up above in green or blue?

Matthias Miller  35:29
Yes, if you want to send that over to Nick or somebody, sure, it

Matthias Miller  35:50
okay? Customer deposits report. There's

Speaker 3  35:53
a note. There's something about the report not working. I

Matthias Miller  36:10
I mean, but this is live like, can we just it should show up in Mark's discrepancy report for closed periods. I

Speaker 3  36:23
can we? Okay, where is the smile?

Matthias Miller  36:31
I mean, we started pushing quotes to accounting impact and so we can. I mean, I would rather just could do this,

Matthias Miller  36:51
something like this, so is quote and is in a

Matthias Miller  37:01
wait, somebody screwed up the column sizing.

Matthias Miller  37:10
Oh, that's frustrating. Seth, if you feel like writing it up, you can so what is what is it doing? I just can't it's at least in the preview pane, I can't like it turns into resize sometimes when I'm over that, not always. It's weird.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Wrap Text. I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  37:52
And then this is the let's sort by so creation date, and let's reverse sort by that, and let's add that as column. Let's do this as a wrap text.

Matthias Miller  38:13
Let's see if it's just the it's No, it's not just the preview pane. I

Unknown Speaker  38:26
it gives

Speaker 4  38:29
me the odds are it's already fixed, but I can check is it they would have this would have been dev of, like, end of last week.

Matthias Miller  38:40
Okay, so here's my proposal, if it's like this is this will show you basically the same, I think basically the same thing, which is quotes and how they impact accounting

Speaker 3  39:02
and Okay, so let's, let's take, let's look at one, one and see how we yeah, this has to do with customer, customer deposits. So, right?

Matthias Miller  39:20
I mean, here's a quote that wasn't

Speaker 3  39:21
sold and we had a deposit on it or a payment on it,

Unknown Speaker  39:26
big payment on it. How?

Speaker 3  39:31
Okay, this was 10 tubes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  39:37
Ordered on 922, and then they may

Unknown Speaker  39:42
well, there's just no delivery yet. Okay, but Dwayne, what

Speaker 3  39:45
do you think happened here? It looks like they have probably applied for green sky financing. I'm sure it wasn't funded yet.

Speaker 5  39:59
I would. Me. So this is shed.

Speaker 1  40:06
Was it said shed Central? I think so, yeah, boy. They really did something funky here. Okay, put it back in quote. Scroll down to the bottom. What in the notes would does anybody say? Why who put it back in quote mode.

Matthias Miller  40:23
The system did, no, wait,

Unknown Speaker  40:28
yeah, the system did.

Unknown Speaker  40:31
Can we ask the system why it did?

Matthias Miller  40:34
It was three minutes after they did the sale.

Unknown Speaker  40:42
Well, that's odd. What would have triggered that

Matthias Miller  40:44
something in the dealer portal? Can they? Can they No, cancel, no.

Speaker 1  40:53
I mean, they could, well, unless No, I mean, if they the only way they could put it back in quote mode is if they would. They did it from the actual interactively from the dealer portal, like the restricted user dealer portal, and that would have logged who They were. Well,

Matthias Miller  41:11
let's go see if we can do

Matthias Miller  41:20
um, you'll see if there's any x 30 that sets so as quote, seems like the sanest thing

Unknown Speaker  41:29
search for in

Speaker 5  41:39
I can't do that. They can do that.

Matthias Miller  41:44
So is quote is true, create website, sales order. I don't know if that would do that. No BPR sync.

Unknown Speaker  41:57
I mean, it shouldn't be affected by BPR sync. Oh,

Matthias Miller  41:59
visualize or create sales order.

Unknown Speaker  42:09
Oh, fun. And this building's built,

Speaker 1  42:15
and it's sitting at a dealership. I think this sales order, I wonder if I should chase this down and just ask Andy to see if I'm assuming this building is sitting at their location. Yet it's a lot building. Yeah.

Speaker 3  42:31
Is it tight? It isn't tied to a new sales order? Is it a different sales order? No.

Matthias Miller  42:42
But but we are matching on so if there's not a way that they could have pulled up the Sten in the visualizer or somewhere, the only

Unknown Speaker  42:54
way, the only way to put it back to quote, is to do it from interactively.

Matthias Miller  42:59
So what is create website, sales order and visualizer create sales order. What is that? How does that

Unknown Speaker  43:05
work? Say again,

Matthias Miller  43:08
what do those

Unknown Speaker  43:10
that would be? The visualizer creates a sales order.

Matthias Miller  43:14
Pull up the visualizer based on a stint. Or you can't pull up a visualizer for existing quote, yeah. So what happens if you pull up a visualizer for an existing for an order? What if? What happens if you save the link, if you place the order,

Speaker 1  43:35
if you push it back into the configurator after it's an order, you can't change anything like it's already locked.

Matthias Miller  43:42
Okay, so what happens if you have a visualizer window open, you complete it in a different window, then you come back and you push the visualizer thing through.

Speaker 4  43:50
I have no idea. I've never tried, but this is what happens.

Matthias Miller  44:00
Okay, so let's go here. Let's go here. Idea, open visualizer,

Speaker 1  44:11
I suspect, based on the three minute difference, it's exactly what happened.

Speaker 6  44:20
I wonder if

Speaker 1  44:23
this is supposed to Well, I have to get, I have to get Andy, to call him up and find out.

Speaker 3  44:27
Well, let's look at another one, see what, what happens. Okay,

Matthias Miller  44:30
here's the next one. Here we have a quote. All right, so let's find out when it when it reverted. I

Matthias Miller  44:45
Well, it never reverted. We just put a payment on a quote.

Matthias Miller  44:55
Where do we do the payment?

Unknown Speaker  44:59
Yeah. Right here. Do

Matthias Miller  45:08
customers have a way to add payments to quotes?

Speaker 1  45:11
Yeah, theoretically, I really think we ought to hide some of those links, those payment links on the sales order, if it's a quote. I would be very happy if that would happen.

Matthias Miller  45:30
I mean, it looks 7:46pm unless you have a hardcore I don't know who's who's burning the midnight oil. But it's either a customer doing it or it's somebody working like,

Unknown Speaker  45:46
why isn't this an online sales person gold mine?

Matthias Miller  45:50
Yeah, it is. It is

Speaker 2  45:52
back here. Aren't they from Texas or somewhere? Are

Unknown Speaker  45:55
they? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  45:57
But it's obvious. Obviously, he took a either send me the URL to that thing or and I'll ask him what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  46:10
Let's, let's look at another one. We're finding this is fun,

Matthias Miller  46:15
misaligned, turning into a quote. He doesn't want this on the AR, okay, but what happened on it? Let's look at the account. Oh, let's, look at account. Oh, let's, let's take a look at what happened with accounting, though we have, sorry, this guy there.

Unknown Speaker  46:40
It. How does that work? Invoice Date and called quote.

Unknown Speaker  46:54
Yes, once it's on AR statement, yet

Matthias Miller  46:57
it isn't that is that's weird. So, yeah, it's on AR Because it's invoiced, yeah,

Speaker 2  47:06
but that's going to create a mismatch, isn't it, because accounting is going to say it's sold, and then the report is going to say it's not sold. Like, if courts not on the

Speaker 3  47:20
what is the number on that one? Oh, I can see it on the report. Okay, let's look at the next one. I mean, that's, uh,

Matthias Miller  47:27
I mean, some of this, we should be looking at validation potentially, or something like.

Unknown Speaker  47:33
So here we have filing $35

Matthias Miller  47:38
Okay, so, yeah, half an hour later, we got a payment on it,

Speaker 3  47:48
but this one was never invoice or anything. It was just

Matthias Miller  47:51
No, never. Was an order. We just got a payment on it, but Whoa, that's but there's no building, yeah, but then this is the

Unknown Speaker  48:01
door. Yeah, door.

Speaker 3  48:06
Oh, so the balance is zero, okay, but it's never been invoice.

Speaker 2  48:11
It's never been invoice. You probably got his door and you never heard

Matthias Miller  48:16
why is it not on this report?

Speaker 3  48:19
Well, it's it probably right. It was Michael,

Matthias Miller  48:23
is it? Well,

Speaker 3  48:24
let's see, I mean, it it should be, no, no, it's

Matthias Miller  48:31
this needs to include quotes with, I mean, one way to surface this, at least, could be to show quotes with payments on here.

Speaker 3  48:37
Give it is that the right place. Shouldn't it be on? No, they were deposited. So it wouldn't on the payment, like the payments aging. It shouldn't be there. Should we that's that's simply payments that have not been deposited. No, you're right. I think it should be,

Matthias Miller  49:00
well, technically, it could show up on the AR report because they paid like the accounting balance is negative. You've taken a deposit on something that was an invoiced right? So shouldn't it show up on the AR with negative balance?

Speaker 2  49:15
Well, but What had we had had a discussion on this, whether, because it wasn't the conclusion that we would have a separate customer deposits, yeah, yeah, separate customer deposits report, think,

Unknown Speaker  49:32
oh, but we already have that.

Matthias Miller  49:34
Yeah, that's what Drew's working on, on nailing down the and stripe is getting us into trouble with building right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  49:40
But overpayments, customer overpayments report. It wouldn't show up there, would it? Well, let's see, no, it's not an over, well, it's not an overpayment.

Matthias Miller  49:54
Well, it depends by what, what definition. But no, I mean, well, yeah, anyway, I guess it does. It. Easy depends by definition. That was a smart comment. Nice, good job.

Matthias Miller  50:11
Well, I mean, I think the question really is, had we talked about maybe I need to check my meeting notes? Had we talked about locking down, preventing payments on quotes.

Speaker 3  50:23
Yes, I think on this, actually, on this incident, you have a note

Unknown Speaker  50:32
that I had to ask Josh to do something with payments on quotes or something like that.

Matthias Miller  50:37
So it seems to me like we could just lump sum, eliminate a whole bunch of headache by talking to Josh about that. And then we have a one off process to go back and clean up. 2025 figure out what went wrong with all of those. And then for 2024 that's up to you. But if you want to, you can just blindly close your eyes. And I mean, I don't know what you

Speaker 3  51:00
want to do. So is, do we only have like, five or 10 in 25

Unknown Speaker  51:06
660, okay,

Speaker 2  51:12
with 24 if we could come up with a number that we can agree is correct, we could just do one journal entry, and forget actually changing the stuff.

Matthias Miller  51:24
Well, what you could do if you wanted to, I mean, these are going to show up as discrepancies that it's going to want you to apply, right? And so you can apply the discrepancies. If you don't want the discrepancies applied, you could create a manual journal entry to reverse, right? Okay. Like do an income statement for the first, apply the discrepancies, run an income statement for the first, and then apply those deltas as a journal entry to cancel the corrections. It's, it's, if you really want to zero it out,

Unknown Speaker  51:59
you can use the correcting journal entry scholars to do this.

Unknown Speaker  52:07
Yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  52:13
Okay, so,

Speaker 2  52:14
I mean, so basically, we need to figure out how we're going to fix

Unknown Speaker  52:19
the issues,

Unknown Speaker  52:22
and then decide if we want to go back to 24 and fix them

Unknown Speaker  52:27
there or not. Yep.

Matthias Miller  52:33
And then, yeah, manually clean up 2025 decide what to do with 2024 with

Speaker 3  52:50
good that the link to that report in here as well. Oh, yes, so is that. So the to do's on this are the items at the bottom.

Matthias Miller  53:04
Yeah. I mean, this is duplicated, but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  53:09
that's what you said. Mark still needs to talk to Josh.

Speaker 3  53:19
Wow, this auditing balance sheet accounts has turned into a

Unknown Speaker  53:24
monster.

Matthias Miller  53:25
I I have a manufacturer, a different industry. I've met manufacturer I've been working with, and he almost threw up his hands in despair. And he's like, like, every, every place you turn it's like, they're they, they're reporting assembly numbers from production that don't have any correlation whatsoever to actual accounting. And, like, literally, the guy entering production numbers was he decided to put in quantities for sub components. And, like, it's, it's just this horrible mess, and it's mess after mess after mess after mess. And the good news is, we've had enough experience here that I'm like, this is normal. You're going to find problems. And when you start cross checking things, you're going to find things that just don't tie out. And I think it is 100% just the process of standardizing like it just flushes all of these problems up to the surface.

Speaker 3  54:25
Well, the good thing, like, just the ones we looked at, they were all legit crazy edge case scenarios that like, Okay, why or how, or what, what happened here. It's so that's, that's the good part, where it flushes those hours?

Matthias Miller  54:41
Well, we're down to six instead of hundreds of Yeah, compared to situations in the past with other stuff,

Speaker 3  54:53
let's, let's jump, let's skip that one for the very last

Speaker 2  54:57
so there's nothing for me to do on this. Customer reports for. The time being, or for the customer deposits thing,

Matthias Miller  55:02
right, correct, that's all,

Speaker 5  55:07
yeah, yeah, let's, let's go to,

Unknown Speaker  55:13
oh, Create User report for all plot sales that

Matthias Miller  55:17
is just done.

Speaker 3  55:20
What is that? Finished Goods? Oh, no. Well,

Speaker 4  55:24
okay, bottom part is done there. Okay,

Speaker 3  55:29
I just looked at Okay, hopefully you and I can look at that today.

Unknown Speaker  55:34
It's, it's, it's not matching it, but

Speaker 3  55:39
it's probably just cleaned up. So if we had which one the finished goods inventory? You look at what's on the balance sheet, look at what the report says, and it's not matched.

Speaker 2  55:48
That's the one we were needing to look at last week or two weeks ago already.

Matthias Miller  55:53
So sorry, Mark, where did you want me to go

Unknown Speaker  55:58
the three? Been great user report for all lot sales.

Unknown Speaker  56:16
I think that's pretty straightforward, just a paper cut projects.

Speaker 1  56:19
I am 99% sure there's already something exists somewhere for for this,

Unknown Speaker  56:26
okay, well, then let's,

Speaker 1  56:30
I mean off lot sales are reflected in sales curves. They're reflected in, oh goodness, I probably have something somewhere. Then this has been around for a long time. Depends on what you want to

Speaker 3  56:45
do with it. Well, why don't we go ahead and assign it to Dwayne, and then Dwayne, you can reach out to me and we can,

Unknown Speaker  56:52
yeah, the next

Speaker 3  56:58
two are not worth I don't think we have to look at them, but it's removed. Mark,

Unknown Speaker  57:04
there's one that there's one sitting in your personal folder called off lot sales.

Matthias Miller  57:08
Can you send that over? Can you

Unknown Speaker  57:13
send me the link? Like 10, the result 110,

Speaker 1  57:15
I don't know if it's doing what you want it to do, but okay,

Matthias Miller  57:29
but then, but, but you still want, I mean, but If you're wanting an email,

Unknown Speaker  57:41
she does it. Who's time?

Matthias Miller  57:47
How are we identifying the

Speaker 1  57:50
well, something's not, oh, this is every, this is everything. This is just, this comes out of,

Matthias Miller  57:56
oh, there's an off, like column, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  57:59
But, I mean, we could, we could refine this. So is, yeah, but you're

Matthias Miller  58:05
going to want to filter by I mean, but this is different than

Unknown Speaker  58:11
so see, hey, no one's no this is

Matthias Miller  58:13
different than what Mark said. This is not a daily notification.

Unknown Speaker  58:22
It is, if you open it up daily,

Speaker 2  58:29
we send an email every, every day with a link, click the link

Speaker 3  58:33
that comes from the same person that I was scratching my head while he's asking Matthias to drop him a URL instead of just going to the link on that.

Speaker 1  58:48
If you want to, if you want to turn this into, I mean, so you want to turn it into a notification, is what you want to

Speaker 3  58:58
do, yeah. Gotcha better ways to do that.

Matthias Miller  59:04
So can we, well, here, let's, let's check something else the so is lot sale. Can we use creation date is greater than the build date?

Speaker 1  59:17
Yep, it is, it is, it is 99% sure fire. There is a few off. There is a few times where it triggers as a lot sale, which, that's not been true, but we don't have a logical way to actually track a building being a lot sale.

Matthias Miller  59:38
So why wouldn't we do this?

Matthias Miller  59:46
And wouldn't you want the creation date is greater than or equal to the last or No, isn't the isn't it? The order date,

Speaker 4  59:58
slot sale is slightly different. Then, then what you crossed out? Because it just says the creation date is greater than the build date, not equal.

Matthias Miller  1:00:10
So, so if you build it on the day it was created.

Speaker 4  1:00:16
Love how Dwayne Zoom is zooming auto panning to the open door so you walk through it

Matthias Miller  1:00:27
as he waves.

Speaker 1  1:00:30
It's apples with a tent that trying to be. Interestingly, I don't know when it tries to be it's trying to keep me in the center of the screen.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:40
Wasn't that backwards. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:00:50
it happens. Are these lot buildings or not. I can't sport either.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
Yeah, I can't. I

Matthias Miller  1:01:04
Is this a lot building

Speaker 1  1:01:10
that is the old used office? I mean, technically yes,

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
technically yes. Here's a two story barn. Would this be a build on site, or is it actually

Speaker 1  1:01:22
you'd have to go to the building itself to know for certain, and looking if you want to know for certain, modification history will tell you that there was usually that there was a lot. Building is for Lot went from yes to No, but

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
this one says it is for lot. Oh, mean, I think

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
the question is, does it matter? Does the less than versus the less than or equal to matter like if it's built on the same day as order creation date, because so is lot sale says it does have to be built on a different day. It can't be built on the

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
building Well, I mean,

Speaker 3  1:02:16
all that operations is wanting from this is to be able to see on the same date or the following day when a lot sale happens, so they can get it scheduled, reach out to the customer and

Matthias Miller  1:02:29
so well, let's let's use lot that's always lot sale, and if it's wrong, let's fix it. The other question I would have is, do you literally want the order creation date, or do you want the order date? Don't you want to wait until it's actually ordered? Yeah, and then should it be? It should be greater than, or equal to the last work day? No, are you sending? I guess, if you're sending it nightly, no daily.

Speaker 3  1:02:58
Well, the thought is it would send, like whatever lot sales were made today that would send out tomorrow morning. So whatever that logic needs to be, the

Matthias Miller  1:03:16
Seth, does that look great?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
Why? Why are we comparing three dates?

Matthias Miller  1:03:30
Sorry, it's Python this and this in range. I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:47
I like that good. So is this

Speaker 3  1:03:55
when you're going to create this, or is it Seth thing? I don't care.

Speaker 1  1:04:02
I'm glad that. So Seth, go build the notification. So it'll be building notifications always make my head hurt. Where?

Matthias Miller  1:04:11
Where should this? What shared folder should it be in?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
Just put in a logistics folder right now, Ohio reports, maybe

Matthias Miller  1:04:25
shared logistics. Ohio reports, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
produce this center.

Matthias Miller  1:04:37
That's a good question. Yes. Who gets it a scheduled document? So I thought, if we build it, can you tie it into the the scheduler?

Speaker 1  1:04:50
Or do you want this? You know, you don't want, you wouldn't want this on the phone menu, because you only want it to trigger whenever it actually has something there. Well.

Speaker 3  1:05:00
I'll vote we'll send it daily that way. It's like, oh, it's blank today, so there's nothing. Or it sends and it shows what, what you have there.

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
So why? Okay, back to this. Then we actually could use this if we added a, okay, sorry, I'm catching on now this is I missed this part. If we would add a sale date range and a yes, no off lot, we would have everything that we need. We could literally send this report.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
I mean, this was for sales curve stuff. There's Well, columns,

Speaker 1  1:05:48
but, yeah, well, I mean, it needs to be cleaned up. But I mean, having it, having to know what week it shows up in, is not exactly helpful. It'd be nice to know what day it shows up on. So, I mean, it needs some it needs some rework and cleanup. I Is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
this report being used for anything?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
It was in March flipper? So I don't think so.

Matthias Miller  1:06:10
So it seems to me like we do yes to lot buildings, we had a date range,

Speaker 4  1:06:18
then make the week number, yes please, and add the order date. We should

Speaker 3  1:06:24
get rid of weak numbers by the end of 26 we do not want to have weak numbers anywhere. It's the stupidest way of tracking. Or almost

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
ended. I built some of that for you.

Speaker 3  1:06:38
I know and we'd ask for it, but like, what week number are we in? Do you know? Does anybody know

Speaker 4  1:06:46
it's 4041? 40 or 41 I was gonna say 43 but I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:51
That's exactly the problem. That's why I hate it.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:55
That's hilarious.

Matthias Miller  1:06:59
Okay, well, let's just, I mean, Mark, unless you're using this well, actually, this doesn't matter anyway, whatever. Fine, never mind. Let's keep going. So we it's just a report.

Speaker 3  1:07:12
So we always had this thing, like I had it actually had a task, and it might still run towards the end of the year. I would ask Josh, when does assist for the next year? What? What is, how does assist? Calculate week numbers, and then I'd send out an update so that everybody could mark all their planter pads or whatever, so that the week numbers all match. Was like, I think give makes me tired.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38
Here's your new specific

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
calendar for the years.

Speaker 3  1:07:48
So the next, these next two, are just unhandy nice to have, but can look have

Speaker 4  1:07:59
it's the kind of thing that's not going to happen if I keep getting important jobs.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:05
Well, then let's, let's leave it right where they're at.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
You just called it an unimportant job. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:17
it's great. It

Speaker 1  1:08:21
is. It is. It is kind of aggravating now to have, like, half and half. I mean, it's like, you never quite know what you're going to get when you open up a report. Are you going to get district? Are you going to get company? It's like, you

Speaker 4  1:08:30
just never quit doing it at some point. It's just when I keep saying, Oh, this needs to happen in the next week or two. Well, it's a little hard to work on the ones that, well, it'd be nice to have.

Speaker 3  1:08:39
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so let's look at some fun stuff. Let me see if Aaron's available. But we want to do the Create import for payroll data, and then the payroll report for Whitney. Basically, we just want to look at these, see what the size is. I think this first one's pretty straightforward. The second one is in the quite a bit more involved.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:06
Your AR, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:09:09
so you're sorry. Never mind jumping again.

Speaker 3  1:09:14
Not, not this. Fine. Let's look at the other one. The easy one first. Okay, apparently,

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
would you send

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
Hey guys, Aaron, hey good to see Aaron, good to see you.

Speaker 3  1:09:35
So let's start with the just audit the payment due for payday.

Speaker 3  1:09:44
So we created this report. We've never used it, and we've this, yeah, we just need some more, some more information here, and then right now, we're just using the employee KPIs and sending. PDFs and Whitney, Whitney's industries were looking at each one and typing in the values off of that so calendar,

Speaker 3  1:10:19
I think it's getting some columns to this report and keeping it Yeah, and continue to work just like it, like it does now, like after payroll has been, is it validated or verified? What's the term finalized?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
Finalized or verified?

Speaker 3  1:10:41
So the joke in Dwayne's office has been, well, this is unfinalize it, yeah, sometimes people have finalized it, then they say, oh, I need to unfinalize it.

Speaker 1  1:10:55
It's no longer called finalizing payroll. It's called maybe in payroll, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:11:04
Yeah, new employee orientation, yeah. So we, we may be your payroll at the beginning of the week.

Speaker 3  1:11:11
Well, this is good, if we switch over to this. Then, if you may be it, then, then Whitney is going to be doing your payroll. So it's, it truly is finalized. So you, you want to make real sure before you finalize it true. I mean, the thought is that, once it's finalized, then she, she'll just look at this, and as soon as it's finalized, she can just, she can do, she can run payroll and QuickBooks like she's doing now.

Matthias Miller  1:11:42
Okay, so go ahead.

Speaker 3  1:11:44
Well, I was just, are there? I think there's some more additional notes on the incident, but is there, I guess, any questions on this?

Matthias Miller  1:11:54
I mean, fundamentally, are you pulling in salary? Yeah, so it's, just a paid vacation, paid holiday that needs to come in. We also want to show the,

Speaker 6  1:12:13
oh, it's, it's showing at the top. I just, I just put it in there. That right there. But it's not, it's live.

Matthias Miller  1:12:21
Got it snack, okay? I mean, I think it's same i But Seth, I'm going to guess that you or I are going to, and we can negotiate who, but need to dig in and actually spec it out for, Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:12:41
isn't that or I decide I just do it because I don't want Nick is going to groan if I try to get him into payroll reporting, tell

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
him it's good for him. I don't think

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53
it'll be too bad, just like

Matthias Miller  1:12:54
spinach and broccoli

Speaker 3  1:13:00
wants to I mean? Is this half a day? Is it one to two days? Couple hours?

Matthias Miller  1:13:06
It's half a day of Seth's time.

Speaker 3  1:13:11
Okay, well, let's just put the size. Where do we usually put that in the summary?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
Is it that much? Though

Unknown Speaker  1:13:22
it's it's, it's,

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
it's one, one, it's wonderful, sure, one of it's maybe one to four. This is just the it should, didn't be that bad. But this is also the kind of thing that's going to be like, Okay, we got it. And then, nope, knock, knock, knock, Hey, Seth, if you I don't know, I don't know why they want it accurate, so unreasonable.

Speaker 3  1:13:51
But there are certain things in business that more or less take care of themselves. Payroll is one of them.

Matthias Miller  1:14:01
You have, you have built in accountability. Unless you're overpaying, you're overpaying, they might not find out.

Speaker 3  1:14:09
Is it reasonable to do that as a user report first and then, okay, good. So

Unknown Speaker  1:14:19
where should the user port go? I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:14:25
we already have one here. I would just you. I mean, I don't care where it matters, where it goes, put the

Speaker 3  1:14:30
link there. We basically want to verify it for a week or two to make sure it's doing everything correctly before we turn it on for waiting. So, yeah, yeah, we can good. Okay, that was the easy one. Now, this is the Okay, sounds good. This guy explain, explain

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
your process of

Speaker 3  1:14:54
what you do now, well, okay, let me preface this with way back when we were talking about. Up doing an API to tie into a payroll system, we concluded that there were a number of limitations and reasons why it didn't work. Didn't work well enough, so we're calculating gross pay in assist, taking that information out into

Speaker 6  1:15:18
QuickBooks, basically from the report we just looked at,

Speaker 3  1:15:21
yeah, taking that into a payroll software to do the withholdings and stuff, and then we need to bring that information back into currently, we're bringing it, yeah, back into accounting as an import, and it's, there's lots of manual steps, so that's what we're trying to improve on, or to to at least partially automate. But go ahead, you can explain the process you use. So

Speaker 6  1:15:51
on the in number one there, that's just the so Whitney sends us a an Excel file in in number one you want to open up that? Well, yeah, sure. That's what we get from her. And then we take, we just copy that out and put it into in the number two there, you got it open, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:16:17
I mean, that's basically just something with fancy, fancy stuff to move stuff around, right?

Speaker 6  1:16:27
Yeah, some of some of Mark's handiwork too. Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:16:30
there you go. Well, it's not, not this report, but this, well,

Matthias Miller  1:16:34
this is the outcome, but there's an in between report that turns it from this to this, right?

Speaker 6  1:16:38
Yes, is this? No, oh yeah, this is the last one, right? Yeah, it

Matthias Miller  1:16:45
is the last one. Let me see if I can. Let me open up the other the middle one. Yes, let's recover. Why is it not?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
Are you using Excel?

Matthias Miller  1:17:03
Yeah, do I need to show you open office? Yeah, it might be early office, library, office. Let me try LibreOffice. Excel is having trouble.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
Need a work processor. Josh

Matthias Miller  1:17:24
has one.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:28
Sorry. LibreOffice

Matthias Miller  1:17:32
always takes a minute to load.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40
Thank you.

Speaker 3  1:17:47
So some of the stuff that it's well, like all of the GL Account breakdowns say an employee's work, like the all of that that we track on the employee, and it says that says we just need to manually update that whenever changes happen, and it's not a good way of staying current with that. So let's say somebody goes from production to logistics.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
So here,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16
oh yeah, that's just,

Matthias Miller  1:18:22
I think the question is, okay, so

Speaker 3  1:18:26
most of the work happens here, in columns x here, like you've got the different GL accounts, and there's a look up cable where it says, Where's this employee work? And should it be a debit or credit?

Speaker 6  1:18:38
I mean, it's, I don't, little bit on further to the right on the on that one, that's where the Yeah, right there settings are, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
This is the got it. And

Speaker 6  1:18:54
if in assist in payroll, these percentages can change. But it doesn't come over to here. I need to right? And then actually drew had one that was that we were switched over to pay with ACH instead of check it was set to check on here. And then he had to manually update it every time.

Speaker 3  1:19:19
But I don't know that there's a lot of value in going through this, painstakingly, this, but

Matthias Miller  1:19:27
on the bank, can you? Can you tell me, fundamentally, though, how do you are you looking at this description to figure out where, what, what account it goes to?

Speaker 3  1:19:36
Yes, if you look at there's another table back there that says, the one that says payroll, like BQ, I think could be payroll taxes and insurance. Those no the BV column payroll items. Those are all labor expense columns. So if it sees that, if QuickBooks says bonus, overtime, salary. Right? And those don't change. I mean, I'd say she adds one or two new ones a year, but now that we've been doing like this, pretty much covers that. And then you've got payroll liability, items, payroll taxes to pay out. So it's kind of those three that determined. Were it New York,

Speaker 2  1:20:27
there would need to be a fundamental change in the way payroll is done in order to change those

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
lists. That's fine. I'm not. I'm just trying to wrap my head around, I mean, in some ways.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
And then all that we're taking over into Assist is, is the totals of each of these

Matthias Miller  1:20:56
columns, each of these and then the wages one. We just know here, let's go back over here, labor expense Okay, so when it comes to, are we taking all the does this get applied to all labor expense accounts? This breakdown?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:22
Yes. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:24
yeah, it splits the taxes.

Matthias Miller  1:21:30
Yeah. Okay, so here's my here's my proposed design, payroll, labor, role, something like this.

Matthias Miller  1:21:53
This is not completely we have labor labor expensed. We have payroll taxes and insurance expense.

Matthias Miller  1:22:11
We have payroll liabilities. We have payroll taxes, payroll tax liabilities. What's the difference between payroll taxes to pay out like, isn't that a liability versus so

Speaker 3  1:22:30
the liabilities are withholdings that we then that Whitney then pays out to. The ones on the right are the actual government entities that she then pays. If you look at the actually, go back to the QuickBooks, the report from her, there's probably one or two on there where she actually probably down at the bottom, like to the state of Ohio or the IRS. Yeah, there it recognizes these liability

Matthias Miller  1:22:57
checks.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:58
So those would be the vendors.

Matthias Miller  1:23:02
So these really should be coming in as vendor invoices.

Speaker 3  1:23:08
Okay, they they should possibly but the way it works right now, with her doing payroll, she's She tracks the liabilities and also makes the payments. And I think that needs to, unless we make a major change. I think that needs to all be done within the same system, the same system where you do you have to pay these entities. Yeah, I would. I would definitely because, because that's the only way she can relate.

Matthias Miller  1:23:41
So the import, so we can derive from the source name that it's a liability then and a separate account. So we then have,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:57
okay, these are this,

Speaker 3  1:24:02
this this basically says on the import, yeah, this is what breaks it down at the bottom that says, Oh, these are separate e payments, or ACH, or, I'm not sure how we're getting right.

Matthias Miller  1:24:11
This is, this is okay. Now, this is something completely different. Then. So then we also have, so then we have the the accounting company, we have a list of payroll category. We have a list of

Matthias Miller  1:24:34
which is just everything's in the spreadsheet on the accounting company. We have an RG of payroll category financial account, and then,

Matthias Miller  1:24:55
are these the same for all companies, or can they vary by company? Payroll items.

Speaker 3  1:25:04
What define what payroll items? Oh, no. Well, yeah, they can vary, because here you have wage with holdings. I mean, it's basically just from state like VA or NC, or whatever state

Matthias Miller  1:25:18
QuickBooks payroll item then, but you would never have, but you would never have federal unemployment. That's a labor expense. I mean, that's just dumb. So I answered my question. That was good job, yay. I think I

Unknown Speaker  1:25:46
think this is what I would do, QuickBooks.

Matthias Miller  1:26:48
So if it's a match key, I mean, I

Matthias Miller  1:27:16
so then payroll items,

Speaker 5  1:27:20
account.

Matthias Miller  1:27:36
I have it in my head. It's so clear. It's not whatever. It's almost easier just to write the you know what?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:03
You guys have a hard stop at 11.

Matthias Miller  1:28:06
I can go past a little bit Well, I think I can. Yeah, I can. So then we would have a date.

Matthias Miller  1:28:33
We will just stack all this information in wage, base, account,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:37
debit, credit,

Matthias Miller  1:28:42
amount. Mount prompt for date and add input line validation to fail entire import if ask prompt does not match line item. So

Matthias Miller  1:29:04
So Seth, what I'm thinking is, let's add a an intermediate level, let's suck this into a database level, and then we can create reports off of that. So then R 20 that reads and then writing the R 20 is dropped. It simple. It's just a repeat for list. Yeah, I'm grouping something I don't know. I mean, do you care if it generates multiple line items for each or does it really need to be collapsed down into one mark?

Speaker 3  1:29:38
Well, okay, the things that, okay, the 28,000 in this case, the those right, that needs to be a single line item, because that's what would comes out of our checking that needs to match for the reconciliation. But the the rest of the stuff, I would actually, well, this was a question I had, can we like we lose by importing this into assist, we lose all. All of the individual employee station information. And what would be nice to have is, is to be able to have reporting and assist where we can say, Okay, how much have we played this employee? You know, in this time period, or year to date, we have

Unknown Speaker  1:30:12
transaction line contact.

Matthias Miller  1:30:17
Yeah, totally. So we'll do a transaction line contact. We can break down each of the line items. By that, I mean,

Speaker 3  1:30:24
probably one of the things we'll have to do is so we already have employer records, or payroll records, or what is it called, employee time card.

Matthias Miller  1:30:32
Wait a minute.

Speaker 3  1:30:34
So so we we have to match the names. And we could do that, we'd have to get Whitney to match the names the exact probably well,

Matthias Miller  1:30:44
or we can. I mean, we can also write mapping for names if you want to. No,

Speaker 3  1:30:48
let's rather do the exact. Okay, and

Matthias Miller  1:30:52
she'll have to do that for the vendors too. Then,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:57
oh, okay, Seth.

Matthias Miller  1:31:01
Why would we this is bordering on bonkers. Maybe this is a terrible idea. Go ahead, tell me now, I don't think so. I like it. No, I mean, like, we could use accounting impact for this. We wouldn't have to. We could literally just import it payroll item, yeah, off the payroll, import the paperwork, and then you build your impact. No, you, I mean, you, you import all of this as a single record with an RG, with the massive RG about all this stuff, yeah, and then, and then you write an accounting impact macro for it, and boom, all the translations done. I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:42
don't know why not.

Matthias Miller  1:31:44
I love it. Thank you. I was hoping you would again. My small ego needs reassurance. Go ahead.

Speaker 3  1:31:51
What so in your mind, once this is completed and working, well, what's the manual process going to look like?

Matthias Miller  1:32:01
Import Whitney's file, it's going to be, let me show you how hard it's going to be, real, real, real tough. So, so just you'll have to put on your your big boy pants every time you run payroll. And you're gonna have to drag Whitney's file all the way from wherever it is onto here. Okay? And you'll have to hit continue. And then you'll have to wait 24 hours for accounting impact to run, and it'll show up in in it'll show up in accounting. Is

Speaker 2  1:32:34
there going to be validation with the gross pay that Whitney pulls like is, we have those payroll numbers giving gross pay totals, what she's supposed to use. Is there going to be any validator? Could we make so there's some validation saying, yeah, what we plugged in over on QuickBooks, and what we're pulling back this is this? This works. It matches.

Matthias Miller  1:33:02
I mean, can we Yes? How should it work?

Speaker 2  1:33:06
Maybe that's step two after,

Speaker 3  1:33:10
because it's kind of like, look, the reason you're wanting that is, it's almost like, if somebody, if we're giving somebody, a 50 pound bag of flour, and then they take it and make cakes and pastries and all kinds of things with it. And when it comes back, we want to make sure that they that it contains all 50 pounds of that flour.

Matthias Miller  1:33:30
Well you could, because I know we changed the payroll due report to look up the QuickBooks payroll, and it shows the actual payment amount and the difference mm.

Speaker 5  1:33:40
Okay,

Speaker 3  1:33:45
you lost me there.

Matthias Miller  1:33:50
Why would we just the report that you showed send to Whitney? Why would we just add columns where, if you imported her numbers, it shows you what her numbers were in the difference between them.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:03
So it's a man, go ahead.

Speaker 2  1:34:05
Her report should include everything that totals up to that gross pay. So but

Matthias Miller  1:34:12
what I'm saying is you can go a step further. You can actually make sure that not only does is the gross pay right, but that she paid all the individual employees that were supposed to be paid the right amount, that they were supposed to be paid as well.

Speaker 3  1:34:24
But go back to that QuickBooks report, because Aaron and I were looking at that the other day and just so like, oh, just pick an employee. So typically it's the amount is 19, or like, yeah, Adam Miller here it's the 12, oh 908, that's the, I think that's the gross pay number that we give to is that right? Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:34:48
No, that's the withholding liability

Speaker 3  1:34:50
in L the wage base. I think that's Oh base, oh, the wage base that would match with the total on her report in most cases, but not quite always. Right?

Speaker 6  1:35:00
It Well, usually the 1301 57 would match, I thought, unless it had for shed time, if they had

Speaker 3  1:35:12
transport deductions. But no, they're there. There's payroll expenses here, like Medicare.

Speaker 2  1:35:19
So that's the basis that the liabilities are calculated from. So if there's something that does not have a liability, if there's something that is does not have taxes taken off of it, that would be in addition to that wage base, that 12 to

Unknown Speaker  1:35:36
nine, if there were no taxes taken off, then it would this number would match the total and column either.

Matthias Miller  1:35:48
Well, here's, I need to, I need to drop what's the priority. I can't go on forever. I mean, that's, we're not going on forever. But I think verification should happen after we get the data in. I don't think it's it's nightmarish. This is plenty of complexity for round one, and this is a huge boost around one. And I mean, if I get to keep keep discrepancies, I might even volunteer to check between the reports. I just think it's probably fine to pay somebody a little bit of money to just go do that manually for the time being. And then let's prioritize the reconciliation. So, I

Unknown Speaker  1:36:26
mean, give us an idea on size, or we're looking at it.

Matthias Miller  1:36:29
Oh, it's, it's a Seth, who's doing it? You meet. I mean, this could be another, like the first half could be delegated to Nick, very easily, the imports and the data structure, and then, I mean, it's a day,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:46
don't you think

Speaker 4  1:36:49
bleeding longer? Huh, potentially bleeding longer, but one to two days, yeah? Because essentially, you need a couple lists, a new record with a big RG, that's pretty simple, the next 30. Does this? Does that? Does Whitney's file ever change format?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:17
Well, once in the last two years or so when she added or you or, or took away one column, I

Matthias Miller  1:37:24
think, but we do, but we do column title matching, yeah, which, which solves that. I just, I don't think, and I just, I think it's, yeah, what is you days?

Speaker 3  1:37:44
Okay, that's good. Why don't we take that? Then we'll, we'll prioritize it using our prefix system, whatever, where we think it should be. I mean, I'm going to say, if, if we can fit it in this quarter. If I had to guess, I'd say, well, we'd look at trying to do this in November sometime, but

Unknown Speaker  1:38:05
okay, or sooner.

Matthias Miller  1:38:09
Well, it depends. Good.

Speaker 5  1:38:12
All right. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
