Unknown Speaker  00:05
test test.

Unknown Speaker  00:07
This is a test.

Unknown Speaker  00:11
So somebody asked me

Speaker 1  00:12
today about how I my perspective

Unknown Speaker  00:15
why

Unknown Speaker  00:16
personal development and

Unknown Speaker  00:19
and

Unknown Speaker  00:19
on confidence

Unknown Speaker  00:21
in the importance or lacking the importance of confidence.

Speaker 1  00:24
And so I wanted to address that question right now about one of the first things I wanted to do was I wanted to take a step back. And I actually wanted to address the issues around personal development, because I've observed that there's a lot of people who get sunk

Unknown Speaker  00:37
down

Speaker 1  00:38
in the the, the, the marsh and the the swamp of personal development. And I think the reason is because things go wrong, and they end up internalizing their failure. And when they internalize their failure, they think that somehow personal development will help them fix themselves

Unknown Speaker  00:56
so that

Speaker 1  00:58
they can become the kind of person that you to become now the reality is that

Speaker 1  01:04
there's a whole industry that feeds off of people's insecurities. And you know, it's actually not

Speaker 1  01:11
necessarily a wrong thing or a bad thing to market ourselves, people's insecurities, but the challenges that most times well, the real question is the ethical question of if you sell,

Speaker 1  01:21
sell to somebody, that securities or market to them, are you actually offering them a solution? Or are you offering them a band aid.

Unknown Speaker  01:27
And in the case of personal development,

Unknown Speaker  01:29
there's this,

Speaker 1  01:30
this perception of moving forward. And this perception of getting some

Unknown Speaker  01:34
kind of a of a benefit,

Unknown Speaker  01:36
when in reality, they're not getting anything.

Speaker 1  01:37
So somebody somebody tries to do something, they encounter some failures, they can't figure out what's going wrong.

Unknown Speaker  01:44
they internalize the failure, they say, something's broken with me,

Unknown Speaker  01:47
how do I fix what's wrong with me,

Unknown Speaker  01:48
they look inside, and they say, Oh,

Speaker 1  01:50
hey, look, I don't have a lot of confidence, maybe I need to fix this confidence. So what they end up doing that is because they don't have any confidence, they say, Well, let me figure out a way to

Unknown Speaker  02:02
let me figure out a way to improve my confidence.

Speaker 1  02:04
And so what they end up doing is they ended up end up looking at

Speaker 1  02:08
things like personal development as a way to improve, improve their confidence. Because we all know that successful people are confident. Therefore, if you want to be

Unknown Speaker  02:15
successful, you must be confident.

Unknown Speaker  02:17
Now, here's the thing it doesn't, it

Unknown Speaker  02:18
doesn't address

Unknown Speaker  02:20
address, first of all,

Speaker 1  02:22
does not address the issue that there's a lot of shady things that go on in the personal development space, there are things that where people will tell you things that make you feel good, or that will will give you some kind of promise that because other people have this attribute, the

Speaker 1  02:37
other people who are successful have this attribute. Therefore, if you have this attribute, you will be successful.

Unknown Speaker  02:41
And

Speaker 1  02:42
it's there's a lot of lives that are lies and half truths, really, that are being sold within the personal development space,

Speaker 1  02:49
there's something else that's that I think, is is more critical. And understanding is that I think the challenge is that many people don't actually understand the path between where they are and where they want to be. So actually, it's more basic than that. Most people find it really difficult to actually articulate what it is that they want. And I think I think this may be this may be actually issue number one, for example, somebody might be might be saying that I feel downtrodden at work, you might, my boss doesn't recognize me. And what I want is, I want my boss to recognize me, Well, what is it exactly mean for your boss to recognize it doesn't mean that he that he or she tells you what a wonderful job you're doing every day, does it mean that that you stop receiving critical comments from your peers, the end. And you know, because your peers aren't directly about you, that you feel like you're being recognized, does it mean that you get a gold belt into your chest, at the annual company meeting doesn't mean that etc, etc, etc, you can fill in the blank from there. And most people are actually not certain and not clear about what it is that they

Speaker 1  03:54
actually want. Some people might want,

Speaker 1  03:59
they might want conflict, and in their, in their marriage, or they might want you know, there's all kinds of other things where they want to have a life that has an impact, or they want to be successful, or they want to be, you know,

Unknown Speaker  04:13
fill in the blank.

Speaker 1  04:14
Well, what does success mean for you, like for you, it might mean driving a late model car, you know, like luxury car. And that's success, if you want that? Well, if it is, if that's what you want, by success, then you have to define success like that, if you mean success, by, you know, having as much time as you like, being able to do the things that you want to do. And then, you know, of course, what are those things you want to travel internationally five times a year, you want to you want to be able to you, it might be as simple as I want to be able to eat out whenever I want. Or it could be as, as, you know, as big as I want to buy a new car, whenever I feel like buying a new car,

Unknown Speaker  04:49
I don't want to have to, you know,

Unknown Speaker  04:50
mess around with, with

Unknown Speaker  04:52
all this kind of stuff, you know, fill in the blank, whatever it is. But

Speaker 1  04:55
most people are not actually clear about what they want. So, so if you're not clear about what you want,

Speaker 1  05:01
there's a low level of confidence. Well, that's, there's actually a high

Unknown Speaker  05:04
level of confidence that you won't get there.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
So you end up with a misplaced confidence.

Speaker 1  05:08
I don't know what I want. And I know I'm not going to going to reach it. And so therefore, there must be something wrong and broken with me. And I'm going to need some personal development to instill some confidence in me. Because if you believe it, you can achieve it. If you can dream it. If you can see it, you can do it. Well, yeah, I mean, anyway, so I think you can pretty much see where that the empty height gets in on that kind of a situation.

Speaker 1  05:28
So you really have to get clear about what you think you want.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
And what you actually really want, you know,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
most people end up solving this problem of the wrong plane. So

Unknown Speaker  05:39
somebody might say, I want a job where I can,

Speaker 1  05:41
I can, you know, I can, you know,

Unknown Speaker  05:45
be in my sweet spot being my strengths, I could do whatever I want.

Speaker 1  05:48
And or I want a job as an author, because I love writing

Speaker 1  05:52
Well, what they actually don't enjoy is writing, what they actually enjoy is creativity, they enjoy coming up with new ideas, and, and all these other kinds of things. So they say, oh, if I could just write all the time

Unknown Speaker  06:01
that

Unknown Speaker  06:02
I would be happy? Well, here's news for you.

Unknown Speaker  06:05
A lot of writing jobs

Speaker 1  06:06
are actually really boring, really mundane and really repetitive.

Unknown Speaker  06:11
And they don't actually require that much creativity.

Unknown Speaker  06:14
And there's a whole market of people who, who

Unknown Speaker  06:16
do that kind of a writing and, and they love it.

Speaker 1  06:19
And maybe that's you, maybe you do love that. But that's an example

Speaker 1  06:22
of how people confuse what they think they want, what they actually want,

Unknown Speaker  06:26
you might think you want to want to have a job as an

Speaker 1  06:28
as an author, writer. But that's actually not what you want. Another example, authors make most of their money, not by selling books, they do it by selling other things, unless they do a lot of books. And if they do have books, they they have, they typically have learned speaking, tours, and all this other kinds of things. And I know that the book industry is changing, and, you know,

Speaker 1  06:45
etc, etc, etc. But so you want to you want to become an author? Well, do you really want to become an author? Do you want to worry next week about how are you going to pay the bills? And do you want to have to choose between buying groceries and paying off the electric bill Do you want to spend six months, you know, going on a on a book tour, trying to sell books and speaking different locations, if that's the kind of life you want to live?

Unknown Speaker  07:11
Well, go for it

Speaker 1  07:12
go live that life, like there's your clarity about your outcome. But if that's not actually the life that you want to live, don't go there,

Unknown Speaker  07:19
don't do that.

Unknown Speaker  07:22
So

Speaker 1  07:23
get clear about what it is that you actually want. And, and a lot of this, I think, actually means you need to figure out what you think you want, and then go figure out if it actually is what you want. There's, there's value in trying things. And there's value in getting feedback from people who've been there and done that, and see if see if they're the kind of people that that you want to be, and,

Unknown Speaker  07:43
and all of that. So that's, that's an example.

Unknown Speaker  07:45
So

Speaker 1  07:46
be clear about what you want. Number one, be clear about what you actually really truly want. Number two, people lack confidence, because they don't know how to get there. And I think that there's, there's kind of this

Unknown Speaker  07:59
business

Speaker 1  08:00
I guess, the bane of the entrepreneur is that depending on the type of entrepreneur, entrepreneur, some, some are more bent towards that this than others. But if you're an independent, innovative forward thinking, visionary experimenter,

Speaker 1  08:14
tell me what happens when you experiment a lot.

Speaker 1  08:17
And you you are wondering all over the place, and you're jumping from one idea to the next. And you're you you're not ever able to hit Peter, guess what happens,

Speaker 1  08:29
you see all the people around you succeeding, you know, kind of what you know what you want, you know what you're going forward. But there's no definite plan to getting there. And you don't, you don't even you know, honestly, there's, there's some people who do very poorly at planning. And that's not their go to when they plan there's, there's the inverse. There's people who plan like everything, and they spend their whole lives planning and never doing. And so there's this healthy, there's this tension between planning and doing. And I think, I think that tension

Unknown Speaker  08:59
best lives

Speaker 1  09:00
outside of you. For most people. What I mean is this is that if you're a doer, if you're a lead before you look kind of person, and you probably do well to have somebody in your life who creates tension towards doing what's proven. And if you're the kind of person who just sticks to what's proven, and you're not much of a risk taker, and you just

Unknown Speaker  09:17
follow the plan,

Speaker 1  09:18
you probably would do well, to get around some people who are seven, leap burst and look second kinds of people and, and figure out what it is, you know, it's this healthy tension, you're not supposed to be both types of people, you're supposed to surround yourself with people who create a healthy tension for you in order to move forward. So

Unknown Speaker  09:38
that's with planning. Now,

Speaker 1  09:41
if you're that kind of person, you're wondering all over the place your add, you can't focus

Speaker 1  09:46
and you don't get the results you want. And you start First of all, you started with high level of confidence, because you're like, yeah, I could figure it out, I can make it happen.

Unknown Speaker  09:57
I'm strong, I'm powerful.

Unknown Speaker  09:58
I'm invincible. But

Unknown Speaker  10:00
over time, as things don't pan out,

Unknown Speaker  10:03
if things

Speaker 1  10:03
don't pan out, it's worth trying. Because maybe things will pan out for you. Maybe she'll get paid. Or maybe

Unknown Speaker  10:08
maybe you all self sabotage. But if,

Unknown Speaker  10:11
if things don't pan out for you, then

Speaker 1  10:13
suddenly you can end up thinking that there's something wrong again, you can end up internalizing

Speaker 1  10:18
the failure, say that there's something wrong with you, when in reality has nothing to do with you, it has all to do with the fact that you haven't, you haven't

Speaker 1  10:26
identified the correct path to go from A to B, to C, to D, to get you to the

Unknown Speaker  10:31
final destination that you want. Because of that you're wandering around.

Speaker 1  10:34
So what happens with all of that

Unknown Speaker  10:38
when, instead of looking for confidence

Speaker 1  10:42
that you can put, instead of looking to put confidence into yourself,

Speaker 1  10:45
you find something outside of yourself that you can hang your hat on, and you can say, you know what,

Unknown Speaker  10:50
I can put my confidence in this,

Speaker 1  10:52
this is how it where I have my confidence, I don't know that, you know,

Speaker 1  10:57
you might not have full confidence in the office companies, you have full confidence that it's going to lead you towards

Unknown Speaker  11:01
your outcome. Let me give you a simple example.

Speaker 1  11:04
You have this brilliant idea that if I, I would wake up this morning that you I'm sorry, I'm rambling. Okay, that whatever, let me start that over. You wake up one morning with this brilliant

Unknown Speaker  11:14
idea that, you know, what

Unknown Speaker  11:15
cooks in

Unknown Speaker  11:17
restaurants works so hard.

Unknown Speaker  11:19
And they have

Speaker 1  11:21
they have their there, they're sweating so much and all that, that, you know, it's really uncomfortable for them. So I'm going to create this cooling suit that you can use that you can wear in restaurants

Unknown Speaker  11:33
and

Speaker 1  11:34
see So, you know, maybe, maybe you're, you're thinking like, okay, hey,

Unknown Speaker  11:37
let me let me go do some research and figure out if this is even possible.

Unknown Speaker  11:39
That could be a possible approach.

Speaker 1  11:41
You could go down the road and say, You know what, I wonder if people would actually buy this, or where this you ask them

Unknown Speaker  11:47
some cookies and be like,

Unknown Speaker  11:48
Oh, yeah, they're like, Oh, it's so hot.

Speaker 1  11:50
It's so hard. And, you know, life is rough and open, that would make my life so easy. And then you ask them,

Speaker 1  11:55
okay, pay me 100 bucks for it. And it's yours, you can have them as soon as

Unknown Speaker  11:59
that create them in the Hee Haw like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  12:02
not afford to, you know,

Unknown Speaker  12:03
making

Speaker 1  12:04
I don't know what to expect what it looks like, I'm making 15 bucks an hour as the, you know, as a chef in the back corner. Or maybe it's minimum wage, I don't know what they're doing. And there's no way I'm paying 100 bucks for something,

Unknown Speaker  12:15
something like that. I'm just going to sweat it out

Unknown Speaker  12:17
and make it work,

Unknown Speaker  12:20
see what happened.

Unknown Speaker  12:22
So your your confidence that the idea

Unknown Speaker  12:24
will succeed has just

Speaker 1  12:26
been crumbled. And I'd like to submit to you that sometimes it's appropriate for your confidence to crumble. If your idea isn't actually viable, then your confidence should crumble. But your confidence should not be in yourself in your in your ability, your intrinsic ability, or your intrinsic success, your confidence should be in the idea so that when the idea crumbles, and you lose confidence in your idea, there should be a greater confidence that you have. And it's the confidence that you have now

Unknown Speaker  12:51
found

Speaker 1  12:52
one more thing that you are not going to invest your energy and you're not going to pursue, you're not going to waste your time in and you have confidence

Speaker 1  12:58
in the process. If I go down this road, and I go find another idea.

Speaker 1  13:02
And I go figure out if it's viable, figure out if people want to figure out if it can't be done, figure out what it takes,

Unknown Speaker  13:08
then I am eventually going to find

Unknown Speaker  13:10
a solution.

Unknown Speaker  13:12
And I'm going to create an opportunity by doing that,

Speaker 1  13:14
that's what's called hustle. A lot of people think that hustle is actually

Speaker 1  13:18
going out and doing the same jump around thing and trying to trying to

Speaker 1  13:21
get to like, you know, they think the hustle is creating the suit, regardless of what other people say, and going out and, and, you know,

Unknown Speaker  13:33
selling it

Speaker 1  13:34
to people who don't want to be sold to, and figuring out a way to sell it to people who barely need it. And, and you work longer hours in if you do it, that the judging

Unknown Speaker  13:42
you know, you have a

Speaker 1  13:43
you win and you're able to move ahead. So there's there's a certain element of hustle, that's all that's required. But

Unknown Speaker  13:49
I think hustle

Speaker 1  13:49
is really about will go try this solution, see if the market response and

Unknown Speaker  13:55
and if it does, then

Unknown Speaker  13:56
you have a solution.

Speaker 1  13:58
And little side note, there are people who go out there and they create new markets. But if you're just starting out, this is absolutely the wrong

Unknown Speaker  14:05
place for you to be unless you're willing to take on venture capital,

Speaker 1  14:07
or to go deeply into debt or do some kind of ridiculous thing. Because that the less responsive the market is, at this point, the more expensive, the more difficult it will be for you to to sell whatever it is that you're trying to sell. So while there is a place for creating new markets, you really have to understand that while there's high reward for doing it, there's also oftentimes high expense either your time, your effort, your energy, finances, other people's money that's required to to make it happen. Now, what happens when your overarching plan is not, I'm going to go sell suits. But I'm going to go find a way to change people's lives and fix the problem that people need to have solved that I can make some money off of your first idea fails. And you're like, Okay, great. I generated a great idea. Now it failed. Now I'm back to the plan. And I'm sticking to the plan. I'm finding a new idea. And I'm going to do the same thing on this new idea. What if you don't have an idea? Well, here's, here's a, here's a little secret for you. There's a plan even for that, find a find a group of people that you can identify, and you can reach and go talk to them, talk to 100 people and ask them what is it that's frustrating and difficult about the work that you do. And I guarantee you that by the time you you talk to 100 Well, either either you're going to find like these people are in different and there's nothing that they care about, in which case, you should pack up your bags and go find another group of people to talk to. And by the way, when I say group of people, I don't mean like, I'm going to go find a 10 of my closest friends, I mean, you should go find a group of people that you have a way of repeatedly accessing. So I'm going to go find all people in the, I'm going to find all electrician, all owners and managers of electric electrician companies that are, you know, for, you know, whatever a certain size range of whatever you want to work with.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
And I'm going to go ask them what it is that the that

Speaker 1  16:05
that's their pain point, I'm going to understand and learn the problem. So you start with a person,

Unknown Speaker  16:09
a group of people that you could reach and market to

Speaker 1  16:11
you ask them what their pain point is, you figure out if you can solve them. If you if there's a clear emerging trend that's painful for them, and they're willing to pay money and you can figure out a way to solve them.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
You don't need to know

Unknown Speaker  16:19
yet. But you need to play to figure out how you're going to figure out how to solve them.

Speaker 1  16:23
Then you Yay. Hey, look like there's your business. Now want to step back a second and ask you the question. What would change for you? Which do you think is more important? Having

Unknown Speaker  16:35
brought confidence

Speaker 1  16:36
that somehow I have it within me that I am going to I have the answers and I'm going to become the person who you know,

Unknown Speaker  16:42
fill in the blank, I'm going to be the smart expert

Unknown Speaker  16:44
who hits crack I will

Speaker 1  16:47
say crackpot like the jackpot. But that is kind of a crackpot way to look at it anyway, sorry, like,

Unknown Speaker  16:52
so

Speaker 1  16:54
it doesn't make more sense to have that to try to have some kind of hyped up confidence in yourself or is it doesn't make more sense to say, you know, what, I have a plan. And if I actually follow this plan, if I take me longer, I've got contingencies in place, it's going to keep me alive until I do find the answer. But I've got confidence that I'm going to be able to survive until I find it and that that this path is going to eventually lead me to the answer the path might be longer than what I actually think it should be. But it's going to lead me there, which type of confidence Would you rather have,

Unknown Speaker  17:25
which kind

Speaker 1  17:26
of confidence Are you going to have to fight for the worst

Unknown Speaker  17:31
to maintain

Speaker 1  17:34
which one when you hit obstacles is more likely to sit you spiraling into depression, and it's introspection and sent you on this crazy path of of

Unknown Speaker  17:47
just

Unknown Speaker  17:47
nonsense. And I want to,

Speaker 1  17:49
I want to submit to you that if you have confident that if you have a plan, many times, people lack confidence, because they don't know yet how to get from where they are to where they want to be. And one of the most foundational things that you need to know is that if there's somebody else doing it, there is a path that you can follow to get there.

Unknown Speaker  18:08
And even if somebody else isn't doing that, that, you know, what

Unknown Speaker  18:11
I

Speaker 1  18:14
you might not know what it is. But I really believe that that 99% of the time that there is a path to get there, you have to be okay with the fact that you might not be able to get there in your lifetime, you might start a chain reaction that might not be, you know,

Unknown Speaker  18:28
depending on the size of the undertaking, or the science, you know,

Unknown Speaker  18:31
if it's a site,

Speaker 1  18:32
some scientific discoveries are like some crazy stuff like that, like, like, like, the more obscure, the more rare, the more challenging it is the, the less likely that you're going to be able to achieve it in your lifetime. But you start to start out with this premise that it is achievable. That's a foundational foundational plan and are foundational premise of it. Having said that, that if you have a plan, either a plan for how to get there, or a plan to figure out the way to get there, that plan to figure out how to get there fit something that somebody else has done,

Unknown Speaker  19:05
it needs,

Speaker 1  19:06
go get around those people, ask those people what they've done, to get there, figure out what they've done, replicate what they've done, and start and like, let them help you build a plan to get there,

Unknown Speaker  19:17
having

Speaker 1  19:18
that clear knowledge of what it is that you need to focus on, what it is you need to do is critically important,

Speaker 1  19:25
I want to end with, there's two more points I want to make. The next point is, is that

Speaker 1  19:31
a lot of people end up doing the right thing at the wrong time.

Unknown Speaker  19:35
So

Speaker 1  19:37
the most common thing that I see is people starting businesses, and they immediately build a website, and they, you know, they drop five or 10 grand on a new website. And, and

Unknown Speaker  19:45
Ching, like, there you go, like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  19:50
and then right after that, they, they

Speaker 1  19:52
print business cards, and then they start, you know, wondering here, there and like

Unknown Speaker  19:57
sitting up big accounts. And that's important. Like,

Speaker 1  19:59
I understand, I get, I get it, there's foundational things you needed in businesses, but they never actually

Unknown Speaker  20:04
figure out if, if this is the business they want to be in,

Unknown Speaker  20:06
if it's a viable business,

Speaker 1  20:08
etc, etc, etc, etc. And if, if you're new in the business, you need to figure out who it

Speaker 1  20:12
is you serve, and what problem you solve, first of all, and then you got to figure out how do I find those people, and how do I help them solve that problem,

Speaker 1  20:19
like, that's the foundation, that's the bedrock, if you don't do that, you're completely you're completely thrown sideways. So you have to do the right thing, not just

Unknown Speaker  20:30
not just doing the right thing,

Speaker 1  20:32
because plants actually care about the order in which things are executed,

Unknown Speaker  20:35
you have to execute things in order,

Unknown Speaker  20:37
you have to have the wisdom of the

Unknown Speaker  20:38
desert there, what is the right thing

Speaker 1  20:40
that I should be focused hardcore on right now,

Speaker 1  20:44
so that I can actually I can actually move forward and, and, and, and figure out what it is that that I need to, I need to figure out, so that's, that's point number three.

Unknown Speaker  20:53
And then point number four.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
So point number four, is that when when people get

Unknown Speaker  21:00
stuck, they often get stuck in this cycle of

Speaker 1  21:03
trying to learn their way out of a situation when you're stuck. Many times, what you need is not more information, what you need is insight and action. So

Unknown Speaker  21:17
as an example, when when people feel

Speaker 1  21:19
this Roadblock, they're not getting the results they want, maybe maybe you've stalled out on

Unknown Speaker  21:22
on sales, maybe you've

Unknown Speaker  21:25
you know, maybe maybe you've

Speaker 1  21:26
you've you're facing challenges with the delivery of your services, or product.

Unknown Speaker  21:32
And so immediately, what you do is,

Unknown Speaker  21:35
first of all, if you internalize

Unknown Speaker  21:36
it, and this is terrible, because you go go

Unknown Speaker  21:39
to the Self Help

Unknown Speaker  21:40
section, and you try to figure out some kind of psychological thing about what's

Speaker 1  21:43
wrong with you. And what you should do differently. And that's terrible. Like, there's certainly there's room for, for self awareness. There's a lot of room

Unknown Speaker  21:49
for self awareness, and understanding your strengths and what you're good

Unknown Speaker  21:51
at.

Speaker 1  21:52
and dealing with some of your internal chaos. But if it continues, being a go to place for all your problems, you're going to be very, very, very sorely disappointed. So ignored at your peril. But make it your your number one go

Unknown Speaker  22:05
to at your peril, as well.

Speaker 1  22:08
So you feel stuck, and somebody talking to you, and they're like, you know what,

Unknown Speaker  22:11
I just read this awesome book. And it's, it completely

Speaker 1  22:14
changed my life. I was reading about the it says, This latest book by Patrick let cod and it's about the Five Dysfunctions of a team and it completely radically changed the way that we do business. And you're like, ah, dude, like, I need that kind of a breakthrough. I'm going to go read that book. So you'll find the book, have you read it? And you're like,

Speaker 1  22:33
oh, man, it makes you feel better, because you're learning new information, you start applying it to your business? Well, here's the problem,

Unknown Speaker  22:39
your problem

Unknown Speaker  22:40
was not the dysfunctions of a team

Unknown Speaker  22:42
your problem was that you are generating enough sales,

Unknown Speaker  22:45
why were you not generating enough

Speaker 1  22:47
sales? You don't even know. The reason is because you're you're getting poor leads is because your messaging isn't resonating with them? Is it because you the market has shifted and there's no longer demand for it?

Unknown Speaker  22:57
Is it because you don't

Speaker 1  22:58
even know the answer? You don't, you don't know the reason. And so

Unknown Speaker  23:01
what I

Speaker 1  23:02
find is a lot of people end up doing these really goofy things that don't even move them forward. Or they here's, here's another example. I'm not getting enough leads. So I'm going to start

Speaker 1  23:09
posting on Facebook like crazy. Well, okay, maybe that's a good idea. And, you know,

Speaker 1  23:13
they keep it up for like, a week or something like that, then they completely drop off and then like,

Speaker 1  23:18
oh, man, that didn't work. They go on to the next thing. Well, maybe it's the right thing to do.

Unknown Speaker  23:21
Maybe it's not

Unknown Speaker  23:22
the right thing to do. But that act of doing something

Unknown Speaker  23:25
is is kind of the band

Unknown Speaker  23:27
aid for their their, their, you know,

Unknown Speaker  23:31
depressed state about the fact that they're not moving forward.

Unknown Speaker  23:34
Do you know something interesting?

Speaker 1  23:35
Do you want to know when an alcoholic gets his buzz about a drink?

Speaker 1  23:39
Is it when he when he when he he, you know, tips bottle up to his lips and takes it takes a swig of vodka?

Speaker 1  23:46
Nope, that's not it. The alcoholic gets his boost of dope mean from deciding what he's going to do the fact that he's like, when he's when he's, you know, at work or something like that. And he's like, you know what, tonight, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go out after work. And I'm going to get hammered

Unknown Speaker  24:04
that that decision

Speaker 1  24:06
gives him a boost of dope mean. And that's actually where he gets his boat, the dope mean that drives his

Speaker 1  24:11
his addiction. And it's much in the same way. Like, if you're stuck that decision that Oh, I'm going to go go, I'm going to go post on Facebook a bazillion times. And we're going

Speaker 1  24:22
to fix this problem. And I'm going to go scrape email addresses. And I'm going to send

Unknown Speaker  24:25
100

Unknown Speaker  24:26
cold emails a day. And I'm going to, you know,

Speaker 1  24:29
I'm going to spam people until they reply, and I'm going to cold call. And like the act of making that decision is what gives you the definitely boost. Even if it's not actually the underlying problem.

Speaker 1  24:37
Now, let's face it, it could be the problem, maybe you're not reaching out, maybe you're not getting enough exposure, maybe the messaging is right, you just need to get in front

Speaker 1  24:43
of the right people, maybe, you know, fill in the blank, that could be a problem. But

Unknown Speaker  24:47
if not,

Unknown Speaker  24:48
then you've just given yourself a doping boost

Unknown Speaker  24:50
that leads you away from your goal.

Unknown Speaker  24:52
And I think as entrepreneurs, we have to be

Speaker 1  24:54
really attentive that when when things aren't going the way that we should, we have to be careful that we don't go chasing down a rabbit hole that's completely unrelated to the challenge, or the problem that we're that we're facing.

Speaker 1  25:10
Once you let By the way, as a side note, if you if you go down too many rabbit holes,

Speaker 1  25:15
you're going to not only destroy your own confidence, but you're going to destroy the confidence of your spouse, if, if you're, if you're married, you're going to destroy the confidence of your team, they're going to start questioning and and, and

Speaker 1  25:27
questioning your leadership and how well it is that that you lead and they're not going to trust you

Unknown Speaker  25:33
to continue making decisions.

Unknown Speaker  25:35
So it's really important

Speaker 1  25:38
when you're doing this, that you like, don't do this because it will not only crush your own confidence,

Speaker 1  25:44
it will crush the conference other ones of the people around you.

Unknown Speaker  25:47
So

Unknown Speaker  25:49
there it is,

Unknown Speaker  25:51
in conclusion, let me summarize

Speaker 1  25:52
this for you. Confidence is actually often born

Speaker 1  25:56
in the tactical steps that is, you know, the right steps

Unknown Speaker  26:03
and that, that that and, and you know,

Speaker 1  26:04
that the right steps are going to take you

Speaker 1  26:08
are the most effective, most direct path to where you want to go that that's going to instill confidence

Speaker 1  26:16
in you if you know that your activities are directly

Unknown Speaker  26:23
going to benefit the outcomes that you're pursuing

Speaker 1  26:25
that that's going to instill confidence and better yet if you can start getting feedback from them if you start talking to

Speaker 1  26:30
people and they're like oh no, that's not what we're looking for. But here's what we're looking for

Speaker 1  26:35
and you start getting positive feedback from people that says yes this is what I want that positive feedback loop any kind of positive

Speaker 1  26:42
feedback loop that reinforces your path to success is an absolute will create an absolute addiction

Unknown Speaker  26:47
to to moving forward in the right healthy direction

Speaker 1  26:50
so it's it's important to protect that and to guard that if you got a coach or team

Unknown Speaker  26:54
members in your life you would do well

Unknown Speaker  26:56
to build accountability I can't even talk

Unknown Speaker  26:59
accountability

Unknown Speaker  27:00
around that. So that's my take a personal development

Speaker 1  27:03
and on on self confidence and

Unknown Speaker  27:06
moving forward appreciate you taking the time.
