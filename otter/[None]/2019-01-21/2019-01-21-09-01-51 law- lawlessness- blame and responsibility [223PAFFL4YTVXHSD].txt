Unknown Speaker  00:02
So I think one of the things

Speaker 1  00:05
that really stuck out to me about the law, let me let me see if I can give a summary of this first,

Speaker 1  00:11
one of the things that stood out to me when I was recently reading through the law was the fact that

Speaker 1  00:14
one of the things that the law emphasizes is that it emphasizes personal responsibility and ownership. And it really works counter towards blame.

Unknown Speaker  00:25
And if you really want to sum up the law,

Speaker 1  00:28
and a lot of ways, it's about taking responsibility. So here are a few examples. If, if a girl is raped within within the city, then it's assumed that she didn't yell and does she isn't actually guilty of rate that that it was consensual. But if she's raped outside of the city, then then it's assumed that she did yell for help. And she didn't cry for help, and nobody hurt her.

Unknown Speaker  00:54
Another example is,

Unknown Speaker  00:56
if somebody borrows an animal,

Speaker 1  00:59
and oh, and the owner isn't with them, the animal dies, then the person who borrowed is responsible for the animal. However, if the owner is with him, then the owner is responsible. So that's another example.

Speaker 1  01:14
A third example is if a somebody borrows money from somebody else, or borrow something from somebody else, if he comes in and steals it,

Unknown Speaker  01:21
he actually has to pay back not

Speaker 1  01:22
only the person he stole it from, but also the person that he has to pay back twice, once for the borrower. And once we're the borrower, we so there's this sense of, you know, the law is putting things in place to encourage people to take responsibility and do the things that they're supposed to do. Now, here's,

Speaker 1  01:46
here's one of the breakdowns. Well, actually, here's another interesting I mentioned about the law,

Unknown Speaker  01:50
we tend to forget that the law

Speaker 1  01:52
is actually prophetic. So when Jesus said that he came to fulfill the law of the prophets, that's the same kind of fulfillment as fulfilling the promise sees that Matthew speaks of elsewhere. So the laws actually, prophetically we need to remember that Moses is actually a prophet of God. And what this means is, I mean, we know this very clearly that that that Moses went up on Mount Sinai, and heard from God. And so it makes sense that that because the law proceeded from the mouth of God, that it is prophetic. But we see other indications as well. For example, when when Moses father in law

Speaker 1  02:29
was telling Moses about, you know, passing around the duties, he mentioned, the fact that people would come to Moses and Moses with hear from God regarding the case. And so he actually Moses was actually using his prophetic gifting and hearing from God to desert justice, because what I'm guessing is in most cases, there were witnesses, or there was there were other details that could not be humanly resolved in court. And so

Speaker 1  02:58
so they would come to to hear I'm in Hebrews, we read about how

Speaker 1  03:04
God in the past used to speak through prophets, but now speaks to Jesus. And so the whole law is actually a prophecy of Jesus. And it's a revelation of the nature of nature and character of God. And, and just like all prophecy, it doesn't paint a full picture. But it gives you glimpses and sketches, and it's all pointing towards Jesus. So we have to understand that the law itself is prophetic. So going back to this whole thing, and taking responsibility. One of the things that we see in the, with Adam and Eve is that one of the, one of the first things that God did to Adam was, was given a command to take dominion. And to take charge, we see one of the one of the, the root of the sin was actually blame. I mean, it was, it was obviously disobedience. But it was coupled with blame. And that's the flip side of it. And the more than I look at this, the more it seems like lawlessness is actually rooted in blame. There's this, there's this, I don't know, there's just this either as close kinship or this, this cause effect. I'm not actually even sure quite how to describe the connection. But,

Unknown Speaker  04:11
but blame is, lawlessness

Unknown Speaker  04:13
is possibly the best way to say that. So.

Unknown Speaker  04:17
And

Unknown Speaker  04:18
then we see that with with Jesus Himself,

Speaker 1  04:21
taking on the sense of the world, and owning up to that, and taking it upon himself, God Himself, taking ownership and saying, I want these people I will not blame I mean, he could have added was responsible, but he took responsible, he said, I want my people I went abroad for my son and I will take ownership, I will send my son and he will people

Unknown Speaker  04:43
he'll, he'll

Speaker 1  04:46
he'll, he'll pay the price will become the second Adam Hill regained people so that we can have the new covenant of the spirit with with my people,

Speaker 1  04:57
we see this in Jesus giving the Great Commission great condition is the the second Dominion just as God gave Adam,

Speaker 1  05:06
just as God gave Adam, the great commission or the the command to take dominion over the earth. And the same way, we've been given the Great Commission to spread the kingdom in advance the kingdom.

Speaker 1  05:19
So there's this level of initiative that we're actually intended to make. And when we don't make it, we're partnering with lawlessness. Just a little side note as well. I think we see this in the government system. We see it with our current debt crisis, both in in first personal consumer debt, and as well as, you know, in the government debt, that people are refusing to take ownership and take responsibility for the problems. And, you know, we see this with landlords and their buildings and things like that, that when they refuse to take ownership of the things that are in their care, then, like, there is this lawlessness, and there's this curse of lawlessness that comes upon the land as well with all of that. So that's, that's an overview of lawlessness with and, and ownership and responsibility with righteousness. And it's this fascinating connection. But there's something else it's been emerging as well as I'm listening to, to,

Unknown Speaker  06:19
to some of this stuff. And

Speaker 1  06:23
this one has to do with religiosity. And it's interesting because there's two perspectives to the law. First of all, we were actually made

Speaker 1  06:33
to fall in love with the law like this is even though the law does not give life the laws a good thing and I think when we recognize that the laws prophetic, that's one of the things that we recognize that it's a revelation of the character nature of God. As a side note, one of the things that I observed in the law

Unknown Speaker  06:46
is that there's three dimensions

Speaker 1  06:48
to to kind of understanding how the law with the law has to say, the first is a very practical dimension, like there's things about, about health, things about the Sabbath, that have tangible physical, like, it's just good advice on how to live,

Unknown Speaker  07:01
there's a second dimension in which when you dig kind

Unknown Speaker  07:03
of beyond the application,

Speaker 1  07:05
there are principles about how the world works. So the world actually works on cycles of rest. And it you know, it works in a kind of these, these core principles

Unknown Speaker  07:14
that you can derive. But if you

Unknown Speaker  07:16
go a level deeper than

Speaker 1  07:18
that, even the the law is once again, because it's prophetic.

Speaker 1  07:21
It's a revelation of the character and nature of God. So

Unknown Speaker  07:24
so if you can go to you can go to any part of the

Speaker 1  07:27
law. And there's this, there's this practical element, there's this principle, this is how the world works element. But then there's the steeper thing where this is a revelation to the nature of character of God. And we see that actually in the in Proverbs as well, just as a side note products has the same, same thing. It's a prophetic wisdom. So there's this practical application of like, Don't,

Unknown Speaker  07:51
sorry, the only thing I can think

Unknown Speaker  07:52
about is, is the noxious wife is like a dripping

Speaker 1  07:55
faucet. Like, don't, don't get very obnoxious woman, or, or don't be enough, not woman, or there's other things like, Don't sleep with, don't sleep with the prostitute, because it'll it'll demolished and destroy, you know, you don't commit adultery, because the husband's jealousy will not be will not be recompense, like there's practical wisdom and this but then there's also underneath that there's, there's principles like this is this is not just tactical wisdom, there's also this, this

Unknown Speaker  08:29
like this thing of

Speaker 1  08:30
there's principles about how the world works. But then beyond that, there's a revelation of the nature and character of God that comes through. And we see that in the revelation of wisdom, and some of the things like that.

Unknown Speaker  08:39
So that's an interesting

Unknown Speaker  08:41
aspect of the law.

Speaker 1  08:43
And I think one of the things we have to look at when interpreting the law is we have to pay attention to, we have to understand each of

Speaker 1  08:50
those and understand the consequences of ignoring the law.

Speaker 1  08:54
Now, there's some things like, like the, you know, the, the, you know, the Secretary sacrificial lambs and some of the things like that, you know, clearly if we understand the

Speaker 1  09:06
practical implications, and the, you know, the revelation of God's character and heart like this, it's like, it's revelation of Jesus Christ. And, and so, you know, we nor that

Speaker 1  09:18
we can ignore that on a practical level, because practically, we have received the redemption of the blood

Unknown Speaker  09:24
through Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1  09:24
But there's a revelation of God's character and nature that we lack, if we completely ignore that, and, and

Speaker 1  09:30
completely look past that. And so when we look at law, and how we interpret it, I think

Unknown Speaker  09:35
I think we do justice

Unknown Speaker  09:35
to it only when we look at it through these different levels.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
And we understand the consequences

Speaker 1  09:41
of dis disregarding it. So that's an observation about the law.

Speaker 1  09:46
The problem with the Old Testament law what it was that it never gave a power of it, and it never gave do enemas. And Jesus Christ came to, to break the curse, to store connection,

Unknown Speaker  09:58
and to allow the release of spirit

Unknown Speaker  10:01
to God's people. And,

Speaker 1  10:04
and that release of the Spirit is the empowering do Thomas that allows people to the, the, the ability to live out

Unknown Speaker  10:13
the the righteousness of God,

Unknown Speaker  10:15
he provides it with them. But he also

Speaker 1  10:17
that there's this there's this spirit filled dynamic

Unknown Speaker  10:21
dynamite

Speaker 1  10:22
living it out empowerment that Jesus died and rose again so that we can have it so that we can possess that he died as our brother so that so that we can have that.

Speaker 1  10:33
But we don't see that in the Old Testament. So even though even though the Old Testament they

Speaker 1  10:40
they knew what they were supposed to do, but they didn't have that sense of I'm going to take ownership and responsibility it was it was almost like it was imposed upon them. But it's also interesting to note that these guys came out of Egypt out of slavery. And their mindset was, we do what we're told. And you know, if the probably would they were they you get the bosses and watching it doesn't really matter. There's kind of a slavery like victim mentality, I'm not going to take ownership, we actually see that a lot in there grumbling and they're complaining, they said, Moses, we blame you for doing this. You're so you know, being and why did you do this to us and, and we don't like you. And you're completely refused

Speaker 1  11:22
to take ownership of the fact that they were begging and crying out for, for somebody to set them free and get them out of slavery.

Speaker 1  11:30
So we see that it's interesting that we see that on a practical level, we see these people coming out of out of slavery. And,

Unknown Speaker  11:39
you know, with a slavery mindset.

Speaker 1  11:40
So so the law has is this picture of like, God is trying to paint a picture of

Speaker 1  11:45
this is what it like, looks like to take ownership of your life into it. And to take responsibility to be empowered to be the most powerful person in your life. And it's lost on them. Because it's lost in the because you there is no empowerment and Jesus came to bring that empowerment and bring that to life.

Speaker 1  12:07
So here's the interesting thing we fall in love with the law because the law points is to God is spoken

Speaker 1  12:13
is the spoken word of God. It's a revelation of the nature nature of God

Unknown Speaker  12:20
we have tried in traditional Christianity

Speaker 1  12:23
sometimes within evangelicals events within the Baptist or the the Amish Mennonite

Unknown Speaker  12:27
or, or,

Unknown Speaker  12:29
you know, whatever the traditional spectrum

Speaker 1  12:32
might be, we have created a law because we think we fall in love with the law.

Speaker 1  12:37
But the problem is that in most of these situations, and maybe I can speak most literally, for the Baptist, because that's, that's kind of where I, you know, obviously, where my experience has been, is, we don't use empowerment to do it, we use

Unknown Speaker  12:52
we use blame me, you shame

Unknown Speaker  12:55
to, to support the system. So, so we,

Speaker 1  12:58
we attempt to create something beautiful,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
but it's it's lacking.

Speaker 1  13:08
It's lacking the power and it completely breaks us free from it completely isolates us from that from that ability

Unknown Speaker  13:17
to take ownership and to take

Unknown Speaker  13:19
take charge and say, like, like,

Unknown Speaker  13:21
I am going to make the

Unknown Speaker  13:23
best possible decision because God has empowered me to make the

Unknown Speaker  13:26
best possible decision.

Unknown Speaker  13:27
And instead, it ends up putting people down.

Unknown Speaker  13:31
And I think

Speaker 1  13:31
one of the things that's really important is, is for

Unknown Speaker  13:37
as we continue to,

Speaker 1  13:40
you know, as we continue to move forward, that it's really important for us to, to raise powerful people, because that's actually part and parcel of the kingdom. And it's, it's really central to, to the kingdom

Unknown Speaker  13:54
and I wish I could articulate

Speaker 1  13:55
that better. I feel like, like, that's something that I can't quite articulate exactly what it you know,

Unknown Speaker  14:01
maybe I haven't quite got to the heart of what I want to

Speaker 1  14:03
communicate there. But, but I think there's something really powerful there about how religion has, you know, has

Speaker 1  14:08
has progressed to the law. And it's not even if the ironic thing is, it's not even proceeding from the voice of God is proceeding through the voice of man. So there's not even that that kind of prophetic anointing on it. It's just I mean, there's, there's a, an anointed good, it's the wrong source, it's from, it's actually demonic.

Unknown Speaker  14:25
Because it's not,

Speaker 1  14:26
it's not proceeding from the heart of God. And it doesn't come with empowerment,

Unknown Speaker  14:33
one of the really fascinating things with all of this

Speaker 1  14:35
is that it has profound implications for how we deal with morality,

Unknown Speaker  14:39
and how we deal with what the Bible says.

Speaker 1  14:42
And I'm just going to choose a couple of hot topics, just because

Unknown Speaker  14:47
it and just just,

Unknown Speaker  14:49
you know, as a way of processing this out a little bit,

Unknown Speaker  14:53
I mean, there's some things that are

Speaker 1  14:54
fairly obvious, but one of the reasons a,

Speaker 1  14:58
you know, let's, let's just, I guess, the, let me just say this, let's just explore this, and let's try it on. If the shoe fits, then Let's wear it.

Speaker 1  15:06
And if it doesn't fit, then, you know, it was a, it was a, it was a,

Unknown Speaker  15:11
you know,

Speaker 1  15:12
it'll, it'll bring further clarity to what we're trying to understand. So I think, what are the problems with,

Speaker 1  15:22
with people living together before they're married? Is that it actually, you know, it's an attack on this whole thing of

Unknown Speaker  15:28
I will take responsibility, and I will take ownership of my decisions.

Speaker 1  15:32
If you look at it from the question of, well, what can I get away with, then you end up you end up

Speaker 1  15:38
doing things like there's actually people who do that, we will say that, that

Speaker 1  15:43
sex itself and x the marriage covenant, and so when you're not married, and you sleep with somebody, you have sex with somebody, then then you you

Unknown Speaker  15:54
initiate marriage. And so you don't actually need a marriage covenant.

Speaker 1  15:58
Well, and again, which, you know, when you go through this avenue of kind of permissiveness,

Unknown Speaker  16:06
then, it's understandable how people could come to that kind of

Unknown Speaker  16:08
conclusion, but when you

Speaker 1  16:11
but when you go through the, the avenue of how do I take ownership of,

Unknown Speaker  16:17
I take ownership of my life? And how do I,

Speaker 1  16:21
you know, be empowered, like, there's a completely different

Speaker 1  16:25
there's a completely different way of,

Unknown Speaker  16:28
you know, kind of looking at that

Unknown Speaker  16:30
it raises the bar of I mean,

Speaker 1  16:33
yeah, it just raises the bar for you, we see a similar kind of thing in terms of modesty, like, there's this,

Unknown Speaker  16:38
there's this thing of,

Unknown Speaker  16:40
you know, I want

Unknown Speaker  16:42
it again, it's this question of, what can I get away with,

Unknown Speaker  16:45
or, or what or

Speaker 1  16:46
how can I sell self gratifying me, but when you have people who are empowered and we're willing to take ownership

Unknown Speaker  16:53
of their life, like there's this completely different?

Speaker 1  16:58
Yeah, I don't know, like, like it, it seems to me like that, that's fairly foundational in that and again, maybe maybe somebody else can learn some better perspective on exactly why that is

Speaker 1  17:05
significant. I just kind of think like, there's something in that that is really significant about that,

Speaker 1  17:12
you know, another example, this is one of the things that, you know, I kind of wrestling with now is this whole question of divorce. I think one of the reasons why divorces so, so,

Unknown Speaker  17:22
so detrimental, is that it's

Speaker 1  17:27
many times, people use it to disempower themselves. And so

Speaker 1  17:32
even though I made this even though I made this commitment, or this covenant

Speaker 1  17:38
like I, I do not I choosing not to

Speaker 1  17:43
I'm choosing not to retain in that are not to stay in that in that covenant.

Speaker 1  17:48
I choose not to, yeah, that's do that. However, if you were to,

Speaker 1  17:56
you know, if you change your perspective to how do I take ownership,

Speaker 1  18:00
how do I live in powered on how do I how do I become more powerful than,

Unknown Speaker  18:04
you know, it completely changes the way that you look at

Unknown Speaker  18:07
some of these some of these moral issues.

Unknown Speaker  18:13
So it really makes me wonder, and it really makes me thinking,

Speaker 1  18:16
I wish I could understand truly on a practical level,

Unknown Speaker  18:20
how do you actually, you know, live this out on

Unknown Speaker  18:23
a daily basis. And I'm

Unknown Speaker  18:24
not sure that I fully know the answer

Speaker 1  18:26
to that. But there's this there's kind of this conclusion or this is not this, this vein that's running through all of this, that that ownership is

Speaker 1  18:36
kingdom and it's God's design, it's, it's embedded into the law and Blaine is is not kingdom, it's other kingdom. And it's it's actually partnering partnering with plane is actually partnering with lawlessness so any place in our life where we are where we are

Speaker 1  18:58
where we are partnering with playing the partnering there's there's we give the lawless one

Speaker 1  19:05
a right to to create chaos in that in that part of our life.

Speaker 1  19:11
So anyway, like that's that's a lot of the processing I've have had about law recently

Unknown Speaker  19:15
and

Unknown Speaker  19:18
just just

Unknown Speaker  19:19
wanted to kind of get my thoughts out there.
