Unknown Speaker  00:58
Sir Hello shoot now you can see my Legos

Matthias Miller  01:07
no yeah like It's back there somewhere yeah right there that's awesome. Leah is

Speaker 1  01:16
working on some structure in her after five o'clock time she needed a smooth service that she's wanting to build on my dad's because like there's an action packed over here if it's really good stuff and I want to build on there

Speaker 1  01:39
well we are the first day of fall today or it feels like 6065 degrees and right here

Matthias Miller  01:48
we got there's water all over the road way to work this morning as well so cool job over there

Speaker 2  02:04
I mean you know the climatic variation is definitely something to take into consideration yeah further

Unknown Speaker  02:38
okay well

Matthias Miller  02:38
should one

Unknown Speaker  02:40
of us think Josh did we just jump in

Unknown Speaker  02:54
he was gonna say

Matthias Miller  03:28
well we could maybe I don't know if he's covered or not.

Unknown Speaker  03:33
Let's jump in keep going. The Yeah, go for go for it

Matthias Miller  03:44
Okay, so the participants will see that okay. I'm working on accounts receivable stuff. I don't know if you guys have any input on this but I think in order to tie out sales order payments, we're probably going to create a deposit record and then have the deposit record get pushed to accounting to group multiple payments together into a single deposit as part of the AR process if you guys have any opinions CMP specific or generic specific no specific

Unknown Speaker  04:33
and is this a deposit of checks or one

Matthias Miller  04:36
checks cash checking well yeah checks okay now

Unknown Speaker  04:39
hello that's Josh with a great you're looking good

Unknown Speaker  04:48
that's what was perfected that

Unknown Speaker  04:50
camera on. See,

Unknown Speaker  04:56
wow, it looks like you got a good tool set there.

Matthias Miller  05:02
Look at that, look at that.

Speaker 2  05:06
Ah, brilliant. That's a fairly casual search as

Unknown Speaker  05:09
for a business meeting so

Unknown Speaker  05:13
you'll never find so no.

Speaker 1  05:20
So on the AR process, you're setting up a deposit record. I mean, in some ways if it's zfp specific I can kind of close my eyes I almost don't even care but how is this different from normal? I mean, what would we normally do

Matthias Miller  05:44
normally we would have something I mean we've got something kind of like the bill of record which is that a form of transaction bill is a form of transaction Yes, I believe so, probably what we do is have a deposit record that is a form of transaction that make it easy to enter deposits or something kind of like that

Matthias Miller  06:10
or what have some other process to directly create the accounting transaction mean we could have an accounting transaction that is a special type of sales order deposit and just know that it links out its items to the various rows on the payments are GE or vice versa. So weird.

Speaker 1  06:41
I mean, I think as long as you name your thing something like you know client deposit or or as the a fee deposit or insight deposit I'll close my eyes to it. When please don't use the deposits. I would probably not I probably wish not to call a deposit record.

Matthias Miller  06:59
But I don't know is that fair? Yeah, whatever Josh has a chance to speak into more specifically anyway, that's what I'm working on. Needed documents from the asset management changes. Drew is working on FTA allocation, testing Asset Management and AP impact. So I've got my side of FDA allocation done

Matthias Miller  07:35
we've got accounting settings moving to the company record

Speaker 1  07:42
where's that what does that note about on 814? Is that done now

Unknown Speaker  07:50
it's okay thank you

Unknown Speaker  08:05
was

Unknown Speaker  08:19
George's Do you just want to share Jaysus one then?

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Sure. Sure.

Matthias Miller  08:30
Look, it was stolen just a little bit.

Speaker 2  08:32
Yeah, it looks dulled. Yeah. Talked with Nayeon on our last call and I thought it was clear but I don't get this in five stuff

Unknown Speaker  08:54
do you need a job ID

Unknown Speaker  08:56
Yeah, that's well, I could probably find it but let me just do this oh, actually, I have it here

Speaker 3  09:22
Yeah, so this is the thing that they thought was 50% down and I thought it was mostly done and I'm not I guess we should talk through what

Matthias Miller  09:30
Yeah, I don't. I thought a long time ago, you and I talking you're like it's 50% done and you got pulled off in a bunch of other stuff. And you know, I don't know so I don't know where it's at eight seven should have version middle. The seasons but middle of next week. I think it's what he meant.

Speaker 3  10:01
I mean, Duane and I were making live ACH payments with it.

Matthias Miller  10:07
So is this in drew score for testing? Or is there anything

Speaker 3  10:11
left is understand, like, how do how does payroll tie into vendor invoices, and that whole side of things?

Matthias Miller  10:22
Well, I would vote to treat this as something completely different. That just went out

Speaker 3  10:30
for Drew to test, like if the ACH payments stuff itself doesn't impact accounting, it's the driving vendor invoice and he's hitting that up under the AP side of things. So I'd argue it's done but if you go back up to 530 the whole Ara thing. I have the infrastructure done for that the primary thing I don't know, like I need some, some way on the record to know whether it's in the our state or not.

Matthias Miller  11:09
Yeah, oh, invoice date?

Unknown Speaker  11:15
Is that backfill them for everything?

Matthias Miller  11:18
Not yet. I need to figure out how to backfill it. I kind of think we have to talk to Dwayne to make sure that his process daily process Invoicing is in place before we actually started doing interesting things with it.

Speaker 3  11:35
I guess I mean, as long as you know, you let me know and it's like I don't know 20 minutes or an hour of work to turn the thing on and all all invoice lookups are now like they ignore the prefix so it shouldn't shouldn't be a lot of work

Matthias Miller  12:15
how should we verify Should I send over this little report that I've been using to set what I think should be the invoice date who's the best person to verify that that's actually happening correctly

Unknown Speaker  12:40
Wayne

Matthias Miller  13:03
okay estimated sales tax did you do this one or do you want to do this one

Unknown Speaker  13:12
this is the label change

Matthias Miller  13:14
yeah I would accept that Word template I give grades but templates

Speaker 1  13:34
the I mean, Jonathan could do it for you but then you'd have to help him set it up set stuff up so

Matthias Miller  13:42
I'll do it some time.

Speaker 1  13:46
Jonathan, if you can find a time to grab him to work with you and stuff like that if you want to

Matthias Miller  13:55
rename this to see sale date for you.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
Fantastic

Matthias Miller  14:00
um, do you have an opinion on the deposit data model?

Speaker 3  14:05
Me no. Yes fact that I want to not have an opinion so that I'm not responsible for it.

Matthias Miller  14:12
We don't have any the obnoxious thing is we don't have any RG row IDs for sales or for SEO payments and so I was going to just like get across a current RG num but then you need to stuff the deposit it into the

Speaker 3  14:34
I mean, I don't care if you add a hidden random ID field

Matthias Miller  14:43
All right. Well, I'll do something if nobody cares

Unknown Speaker  14:45
that what you were expecting, I would say

Matthias Miller  14:48
yeah, I mean, it's like one more thing. To add to my growing list of things to do.

Speaker 3  14:55
In the field, I just I don't know like I really don't understand. I'm not caught up on like every Also it's happening there so I think like it would take me five minutes but then it would also take you five minutes

Matthias Miller  15:09
well, it's more than five minutes for me so you're faster than I am. Especially when you look at backfilling all the you need row IDs

Unknown Speaker  15:24
I'm gonna pick that one up just to tell you when it's done

Matthias Miller  15:34
yeah, I mean the only the only thing is I'm not 100% certain that I don't know depending on how we end up doing it might not even be necessary. Although I do think I do think it would make it easier to have the deposit link back to the back to the payments or G instead of stomping it on the on the sales or plus to avoid collisions

Unknown Speaker  15:58
I mean, I don't mind it. Happy to have you Okay.

Matthias Miller  16:02
Sounds good. Yeah, we'd be happy with that

Speaker 3  16:12
on the accounting side drew sent me a whole list of stuff Saturday that was half legitimate issues and half Pencak and I think I fixed all legitimate stuff so my mind that's back in his court to chase things

Matthias Miller  16:33
good Now there was a Joel I don't think this guy documented any here were you guys able to fix the general ledger issue that he was talking about

Speaker 2  16:49
look at your signal messages. I think so but I mean I think we've addressed everything we talked about but I'm drawing a blank on one that was a there's salvage value there's Oh are you can select any Wait Are we talking about the same issue?

Matthias Miller  17:18
Probably maybe not. Let me let me find my email find out what it was basically when you drill into a drill into sub account from the income statement if you drill into sub account to open the general ledger we were using the wrong the wrong name

Unknown Speaker  17:33
right right all right identify

Matthias Miller  18:02
there we go so let your broken Yeah. So this was on this tab and which is where we are so that should actually be included in

Unknown Speaker  18:23
live Saturday evening, so

Matthias Miller  18:26
that would include this cool

Unknown Speaker  18:41
okay, okay, yeah.

Matthias Miller  18:45
Go Perfect. Good. So that means I don't see any reason for an update to Nathan. I'm

Unknown Speaker  18:54
sorry. I'm gonna update for another reason.

Matthias Miller  18:58
Oh, my dictionary listening still failing. So

Speaker 3  19:02
yeah, I complained to Randy. Randy came to fix it. It's still broken. So really got to complain to Ella is Randy's boss.

Unknown Speaker  19:10
Randy super hard to manage. What did Randy breaker

Speaker 3  19:14
change the command to change a dictionary list element item?

Unknown Speaker  19:21
He changed something recently or what?

Unknown Speaker  19:23
Yeah, he changed C++ list editing code.

Unknown Speaker  19:26
Oh gracious.

Speaker 2  19:28
Oh, sure. It probably means I reviewed it. I haven't gotten to it yet.

Matthias Miller  19:36
So when you do a change, it gives back an error saying that it's a duplicate item. Which is kind of like I knew that I was still need to change it.

Unknown Speaker  20:07
How recently was that broken Do you know

Matthias Miller  20:10
last week that all of us know

Speaker 2  20:14
okay so that's probably in this assertion and then search comparator route of that the

Speaker 3  20:19
one that has should ever come up from any data coming from me and they're they're coming from Randy

Unknown Speaker  20:28
okay now now that one

Speaker 3  20:50
No no no no no no I did not record that one sorry okay.

Speaker 1  20:54
Oh okay 157888 is probably the one

Unknown Speaker  21:01
right right the product change

Matthias Miller  21:03
yeah

Speaker 2  21:12
okay, so yeah where Randy says next problem Josh ran into and he apparently didn't I could just revert it

Speaker 3  21:30
is still up to you? We've been on a real roll over the last while it's great

Speaker 1  21:43
yeah, I guess just reverted until May Durant is hard to get ahold of so just reverted until. And so So basically every set dictionary list item is failing right now. If the item exists, it's

Unknown Speaker  22:09
you can demo here if you want

Matthias Miller  22:13
let me see where

Unknown Speaker  22:15
I can come in.

Matthias Miller  22:16
I guess. And then I don't think it will just sit at the Z zero assuming it fails Wait,

Speaker 3  22:28
oh, you're gonna get rid of essentials Yeah, but if you do that it doesn't work.

Matthias Miller  22:33
It's it's something like this and then the

Matthias Miller  22:42
I mean, this is what the list looks like. So it's a single item with Sure.

Speaker 3  22:48
All right. And you can I tested it by just creating a new dictionary list on the spot

Speaker 1  22:54
right yeah. Randy please. He is so sweet. But he we will have to send them fishing sometime but in the meantime he gets things done

Unknown Speaker  23:04
usually sometimes even catches the right fish

Matthias Miller  23:13
yeah, I mean this would be an easy way to Yeah, sure.

Unknown Speaker  23:17
Oh, awesome. Can you easily drop that in the message I mean in the job me

Speaker 1  23:28
do a scheduled task thing for him. That'll be better given the scheduled tasks and texts. But tell him to write and run it twice

Matthias Miller  23:40
a year can a neural signal you Joe That's a scheduled task version.

Unknown Speaker  23:50
Cool. Thank you

Speaker 2  23:57
according commit this one file remains in conflict okay

Matthias Miller  24:13
by the way, I won't be able to go for the full hour and we'd have to have drop off in about 15 minutes or so. There

Speaker 1  24:25
also, by the way, we should probably make these meetings longer 15 minutes because I haven't ever seen us do 15 minutes but a big deal with them for I don't know.

Matthias Miller  24:37
Just do an hour every week.

Unknown Speaker  24:39
And I try to cut it short. That way somebody else doesn't steal the calendar spot. So is there anything you want from us on the rest of this? Like anything?

Unknown Speaker  24:57
Anything you want me in this stuff?

Matthias Miller  25:02
We'll check printing is still on me to figure out the workflow probably work with Dwayne I should just schedule a call with Dwayne and work with him on this stuff cash flow statement that's near court AR stuff is just for me to clean out what's the point doing it now accounting impact we keep going back and forth into the design this still needs some input from them or it needs me to sit down and wrap my head around everything they're trying to do here. Part of the issue is I've been relying on some of these to work through some of these calls with Mark and we've cancelled a few which isn't terrible but you're pleased to work on but anyway this one we also got to figure out what we want in a transaction verification report this is probably something Josh you can almost just go out and build basically we'd want any kind of transaction that is not that does that use one of the CFPs special accounting event types in the field to verify date and time and report to show things that have not yet been verified I don't know if you want to or not I can also go

Speaker 3  26:28
to the via fax or or Excel you know I guess it's going out to all the people it has to be fax do they do is there like a

Matthias Miller  26:47
Do we want a QR code to auto approve everything that was on the sheet I vote not if we are trying to make September 30 Sir I was wondering if we need to make a note

Matthias Miller  27:20
Yeah, we'll just schedule it to the right people when they get there hello, I was wondering if on the assets we should cache the asset value in some way or require them to enter so that with our current Pio design, you could theoretically somebody modifies an old Pio we could lose history of the asset value

Speaker 2  27:54
what's the trigger for for capturing value

Matthias Miller  28:10
while the other no work

Speaker 2  28:16
I guess we could say when well wait no we require and sort of service state I think by doing I was thinking you know we could say well when you add a startup service state we capture it but I'm not sure that that's no no

Matthias Miller  28:42
this is also his post September spinach I don't know if he has that I am this could also be post September spinach as well. And maybe should be

Matthias Miller  29:04
I'm slightly worried about it because things will quietly

Unknown Speaker  29:14
change out from under us.

Matthias Miller  29:16
Yeah, change out from under us. Yeah,

Speaker 2  29:18
I mean, we could capture it anytime we know barely. I mean, okay, I was going to say we could capture it anytime we enter depreciation but we could add that that's modifying different records so

Matthias Miller  29:37
we could add it as a field require them to fill it in and have a report alert that shows when it's different.

Unknown Speaker  29:45
Brilliant. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:55
That report alert is a little scary. Just I mean, it's looking at transactions might not be too bad

Speaker 2  30:10
it shouldn't be too terrible the handful of transactions that most for every asset every 15 minutes or something

Speaker 2  30:46
says there's some point, I mean, you probably want to do that after they have actually

Speaker 2  30:59
after the inservice state, does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  31:13
As in the throwing the LR

Matthias Miller  31:25
pencil lines like goes in the service? If, if it goes into service 90 days from now, which I don't know how likely that would be? Doesn't it seem possible? What point would it hit? Nevermind like, okay, let's say you're you're buying this is not sheds, but you're buying a metal rollformer Or like a braid or whatever. And it has a one year lead time. And so you go ahead and purchase and you make a down payment. That down payment would be good is not recorded as an asset until a truck rolls up and drops it on your property presumably.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Yeah, I guess would it just be probably pre payments or something up until? Up until then. Yeah, I mean, I think something like that. But yeah, not. wouldn't think it's depreciating at that point. I mean, there's no way it should be.

Matthias Miller  32:48
There's no way it shouldn't be may require a conversation with.

Matthias Miller  33:04
Wait, that's completely up to them. We're not doing any automated stuff there. So it's it? Well, in that case, we wouldn't know. I guess the prepayment would be tied out to the asset

Matthias Miller  33:31
this makes my head or

Speaker 2  33:37
I mean, if there would be okay. One way would be to have them affirmatively indicate on the detail screen. Hey, yeah, we know. We've entered a transaction. We know that it is not it is not the final value. And so we aren't, so please don't scream at me. But then if that is still the case, by the time we hit the inservice the start of service day, then we do scream at that point because you'd better not still be trying to add at that point. I mean that they're going to get that wrong too.

Matthias Miller  34:32
I think it's fine to

Matthias Miller  34:40
in practice, you know the in service date is when you need to know this information. We don't really have this feels a little bit like a this feels like a pretty loose integration. Yeah. Primarily because we're not pushing transactions to accounting system

Matthias Miller  35:19
this is also the kind of thing that's probably close enough to what we actually want that even if we wanted to make a few tweaks to the validation that we could I don't care I'll still mind chasing it with them and see

Unknown Speaker  35:37
ya yeah I mean having a having an authoritative yeah here's what we want would be helpful

Matthias Miller  36:01
yo

Matthias Miller  36:08
Jess she wanted to talk about writing up sales or payment differences as well swelled

Matthias Miller  36:39
what was so basically let's say really weird scenario customer buys a building they do a pay in full we deliver a sales tax changes it's off by 20 cents Can we please just write off the difference

Speaker 3  36:58
Yeah, I'm trying to it's that kind of scenario I'm trying to recall why I needed to care that I don't remember I just let it go.

Matthias Miller  37:11
Don't you need it for AP accounting impact sorry, a weight that's going to be in my court. That's why I should care. Marks is something to you during a meeting and then you cared. And then you talked to me and then you stopped caring anymore?

Speaker 3  37:31
I mean, it's at 7am So it was while I was on the phone with them. I just don't remember why I feel like even on those calls, I'm relatively good at evading things that are not my responsibility. So I feel like I would have wouldn't have reached out to you if I hadn't thought I was responsible for at least a little

Matthias Miller  37:50
bit. Be able to dodge bullet perhaps

Speaker 4  37:59
good good

Speaker 3  38:11
anything else? Okay, I think I've got a week's worth of work left but then think next time with us. Let's talk to see if there's anything I can take off your plate.

Matthias Miller  38:23
Okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  38:25
That does not involve our 21 templates

Matthias Miller  38:29
or labels.

Unknown Speaker  38:34
Somehow I get the sense someone has been burned

Unknown Speaker  38:41
they paid me a lot of money but not enough to play with complex.

Unknown Speaker  38:49
Very good. Thank you guys. Thanks.
