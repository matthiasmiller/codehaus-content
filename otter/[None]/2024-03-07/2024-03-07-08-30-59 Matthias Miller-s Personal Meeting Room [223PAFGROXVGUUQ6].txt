Matthias Miller  00:38
Hey, good morning. Good morning it was about something else

Matthias Miller  01:07
do you know if Mark is going to be joining for the project updates?

Speaker 1  01:10
Yeah, that right now. He's frantically working on example for a project for today. So

Matthias Miller  01:20
sounds good. We'll jump in.

Unknown Speaker  01:23
I think it'll be okay.

Speaker 2  01:29
So do we have any updated goals that you wanted to focus on for March in terms of priorities for tasks?

Matthias Miller  01:46
Drew is we're still missing? I mean, it's income. So it looks like we're still missing income statement. So it's income statements and balance sheet is that's the big mergeable.

Speaker 1  02:00
Yeah, I mean, income statement is still the big right now go.

Matthias Miller  02:04
Okay. First, first income statement. Yeah.

Speaker 1  02:12
I mean, if you're, if you're available, the guy homeless. Yeah. If not make it?

Speaker 2  02:23
Sure, when you want to put it, is there anything else you want to talk about with priorities? Or should I just move on?

Matthias Miller  02:32
That's probably it.

Speaker 2  02:34
Just just kind of move three. Okay, well, with that in mind, I can jump in Hey, Mark, your first step with the document procedure for closing books for 2023?

Unknown Speaker  02:47
No change. Okay.

Speaker 2  02:49
Sounds good. Drew on the vendor invoice the worn on missing information? Is that it did that get reviewed?

Unknown Speaker  03:06
Or is it live first of all, and

Matthias Miller  03:08
then did it get reviewed? Yes,

Speaker 1  03:11
I think so. I think I well, I looked at the is this involving those changes to warnings that you sent me miss is the

Matthias Miller  03:26
Yes. Well, I think this one might have been older than that. But okay. We had an email that

Speaker 2  03:36
was going to come in that I wondered if this was so we just had duplicate worn invoice warnings. That was an email from Matthias to Drew. And I didn't know if this was related to what we were currently doing. If this was the we had a duplication tweak email. And then we have the test warning for duplicate transactions. And then there might have also been Yeah, so that's a third one. I didn't even catch the word I'm missing information. Is that email pertaining to any of those things? So

Speaker 1  04:08
yeah, that that email that you empathize and you said, I looked at that. I mean, that appears to be fine. Now whether that is particularly into this one, we could probably just roll on together. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  04:29
The vendor invoice warnings.

Matthias Miller  04:32
Yeah, there's probably enough overlap. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  04:36
That's okay, well, we'll just do

Speaker 2  04:48
okay. So is the vendor invoice warnings then complete because of this I think so. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  05:04
So Matthias, that thing you said that was, was that one supposed to take care of the duplicating it thinking that an invoice and a check are duplicating each other?

Matthias Miller  05:22
Yes. Yeah. Okay. I believe I believe I believe so although it wasn't seeing any differences in the warnings we were displaying for those. It the only changes was that when if you are getting the word that warning from a when editing an accounting transaction, then yes, it does. You're getting that warning when editing a vendor invoice. It should be fixed. It should be working, but I'm not sure if it was if we were getting that warning previously.

Speaker 1  05:59
So I would have been I mean, I would have been doing a reconcile so I would have been changing the transaction to reconciled so I would have been editing a transaction. Okay. I haven't got a chance to check jacket since. But

Matthias Miller  06:18
yeah, so that wants to be fixed. Yes.

Speaker 2  06:20
Okay. Okay, so I'm completing vendor invoice warning. I'm missing information. Yes. Excellent. There we go. Okay, so we've got the track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation Event Log drew that was in your court.

Speaker 1  06:40
Yeah, the, the hot fix to get everything to show on one page that's working. Otherwise, I'd like to review what the report actually contains just a little bit. So maybe we need to put that on.

Matthias Miller  06:58
Work today or something?

Unknown Speaker  06:59
I haven't marked, but great.

Speaker 2  07:07
Okay, great. Matthias we have the closing process for accounting impact.

Matthias Miller  07:13
This is on the let's see, make sure it was on the agenda was supposed to be on the agenda discussed today.

Matthias Miller  07:25
If

Speaker 2  07:27
Okay. Okay. I added that tag. Matthias blockout. Time for the Go life plan.

Matthias Miller  07:37
Well, I doubt we're getting it to today. So I think it's on for next week, maybe.

Speaker 1  07:46
Let's just say resolves the pain and say let's put it out two or three weeks.

Matthias Miller  07:52
Here enough. Pick. Well, I'm gonna be out. If you guys want it out in well, yeah, put it for the last. That's gonna be the last Thursday and

Speaker 1  08:07
I'm available that Thursday, but that maybe doesn't make any difference.

Matthias Miller  08:13
I'm gonna be out the prior Thursday. Is there a different day that we should be? Do you want some?

Speaker 2  08:30
See, Tony, next week? Yeah. Okay. 20 Aces without Drew?

Unknown Speaker  08:38
Yeah, that's when I'm out. Okay.

Matthias Miller  08:41
I wonder if we should do the fourth. Yeah, unless we can find a different day in between there. Yeah, what

Speaker 3  08:48
are we for the fourth is the blackout for the Blue Live plan.

Speaker 2  08:53
Yes. So that would be the bulk of your agenda for the day. So what we're talking about? Yep.

Matthias Miller  08:59
Okay, gotcha.

Speaker 3  09:01
Are we still on for the 14th next week? Or Yes. 14th But not the 21st or 28th?

Matthias Miller  09:12
Yeah, I'm at the 21st through the 28th so we can't we can talk about other stuff on the 28th we can't talk about I don't think we want to talk about this on the 28th Well,

Speaker 3  09:20
I think we have to just bite the bullet move it to the fourteens because I I made I moved well I've made some commitments to have funny three books completed by end of March and I think we just get through so if I do nothing else between now and for Keith I think other than this that would be success. Okay.

Speaker 2  09:55
Hey, great. Drew out account subtype groupings for balance sheets. Is this done. Cool. How about allow attaching statements to reconciles.

Speaker 1  10:12
Um, so I Oh, yeah, that's done. I mean that's doable. So even with that one

Unknown Speaker  10:27
does this include viruses that one include the thing of me needing to put in those historical reconcile dates

Matthias Miller  10:46
not under the attaching statements.

Speaker 1  10:48
Yeah. Okay. No. So get rid of the attaching statements don't

Speaker 2  10:55
get rid of the attaching statements. What I'm sorry, I was looking at something else.

Unknown Speaker  11:01
That one's down. This one

Speaker 2  11:03
is in fact on. Okay, I've got it. I've got a dependency that makes me want to see take that out first. Maybe Why won't let me do it. Okay, I'll mark it done when we're out here

Speaker 2  11:31
okay, ad budget columns to income statements for Drew

Matthias Miller  11:45
probably just

Speaker 1  11:47
printed out on that one line and they will just leave it to be checked. I mean, okay. Like do you within review

Speaker 2  11:58
Okay, sounds good. Matthias vendor and company mismatch here for from Josh last

Matthias Miller  12:14
okay um I did have a question on that for Drew we should talk about it on the agenda. Okay

Speaker 2  12:31
there we had create a process for moving payments from one S O to another

Matthias Miller  12:34
no change.

Speaker 2  12:37
Okay, Drew account balance diagnostic was ready to look at

Unknown Speaker  12:54
so I think that is done. The first one I looked at we looked at it last Thursday hit home with us afterwards.

Matthias Miller  13:04
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I just showed you some of the changes Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:10
Yeah, that was

Speaker 2  13:14
great. Okay. Um, another one for Drew handling historically reconciled transactions

Speaker 1  13:23
I have those dates all in there so if this was you need to do something now I guess yes. This needs

Matthias Miller  13:29
to be back in my court and yeah, we need to I guess getting an update last night I apologize. So this is going to have to wait until an update until I can do more with it but like work okay.

Speaker 2  13:48
Get back to you. Let's see for Drew assist check record add notes memo that was pending an update did that get like that

Unknown Speaker  14:05
yeah, I think that's done

Unknown Speaker  14:06
okay

Speaker 1  14:13
I know that there's a there's a memo spot. I know that I can put things in there.

Unknown Speaker  14:17

Speaker 2  14:31
Let's say Matthias show ending bank or credit card balance or pending items.

Matthias Miller  14:37
I'm Drew I wanted to talk to you about this one some more. Make sure that I'm clear on what you want.

Matthias Miller  14:55
For the streamline vendor invoices or the ending balance sheet Let's go for which one drew yes

Speaker 1  15:08

Speaker 2  15:31
okay moving on to streamline vendor invoices needing payment we see what

Matthias Miller  15:45
let's bump this this out even worth talking about bummed us out to the end of March we got bigger fish to fry. We can we can decide that if we want to

Unknown Speaker  15:54
put it in put it on the fourth because that's what it's like.

Speaker 2  15:58
Right. Okay, sounds good. About the vendor invoice validated against unlinked ledger accounts.

Matthias Miller  16:37
This is the one that's this is the same as the other email that drew replied to and said yes, that looks good but it's pending an update to go live

Unknown Speaker  16:47

Unknown Speaker  18:26
No changes.

Matthias Miller  18:28
Notes. actually hang on. Yeah, no change.

Speaker 2  18:32
Okay, sounds good. Mark, we had put together budget totals in an Excel spreadsheet for Matthias

Speaker 3  18:41
we have March 21. Yeah. Yeah, no change but leave the date is correct. Okay, perfect.

Speaker 2  18:49
All right, we're getting into April now. So let me just look at our new ones. So I have an undated one for test warning for duplicate transactions. And I wasn't sure if maybe this was done and I just missed it or without the date I was a little confused we know about this.

Matthias Miller  19:10
Close this one out. Okay.

Speaker 2  19:14
I just Yeah, yeah, cuz that seems like we've got some we've got duplicates of duplicate transactions, which is entertaining but annoying. Let's see. Let's see. We've got a credit memos. Incoming.

Matthias Miller  19:32
We need to discuss the design today. Okay, great.

Speaker 2  19:35
Do we have any sense of date until it gets discussed?

Matthias Miller  19:43
Yes, it depends on yells priority.

Speaker 1  19:49
Probably that number two or three. So

Unknown Speaker  19:54
do we want to try to put this in March let's

Matthias Miller  19:58
let's try and talk about it today. It's just me. We will now see what we see we can get to it. Okay oops there we go

Speaker 2  20:11
let's see another undated financial accounts add non RG attachments memo to reconcile child screen. I thought we had talked about this. I just wasn't able to link it. Is Nick doing it? That's done. Is it done? Okay. That makes it true.

Matthias Miller  20:29
signed off on it. Yep. Okay, perfect.

Speaker 2  20:34
Sales Order accessory general ledger accounts email

Matthias Miller  20:42
that's on the agenda for the day.

Unknown Speaker  20:53
Any dates yet?

Matthias Miller  21:02
No,

Speaker 2  21:04
no, no. Transaction by contact change request.

Matthias Miller  21:09
This is the one that is pending an update. Update. Okay.

Speaker 2  21:16
And then we'll need drew to review it pending an update. Yes. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  21:27
We have a date.

Matthias Miller  21:32
I mean, just quit. But next Monday? Yeah, Monday or Tuesday? I mean, we should probably go live. I mean, do an update over the weekend, maybe even before.

Speaker 2  21:44
And then duplicate warnings email. That's the one I pulled out. So we're saying this one is related to the vendor invoice issue. Okay. And I'm so into that? I think so. Okay, excellent. I think I'm done. Is there anything else you guys want to talk about?

Unknown Speaker  22:12
Well jump off before anybody thinks about it. Have a good meeting. All right, bye.

Matthias Miller  22:25
All right. Alright. What's your data? Sec? Do we want to just work through the list top down? Or is there going to work on?

Unknown Speaker  22:44
Yeah, I would say we probably could do that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  22:47
the so accessory GL accounts. I think the idea was way back when that we would have some kind of confirmation process that we would have some kind of way to default the GL account, have a way to override it, maybe even have something go out to the builders, or to the district managers to update them, and then have some kind of checkbox to say that it was confirmed. I don't recall specifically what the business process was intended to be. We don't have any default accessory GL accounts set up right now. And so I think, I think all that to say, this appears to me to be a business process issue. And once you guys figure out what you want, we can

Speaker 1  23:39
well now what are you referring to as accessory GL accounts,

Matthias Miller  23:45
the miscellaneous items on the sales order

Speaker 1  23:56
Okay, so that is the same spot as if somebody wants something different or weird or whatever.

Matthias Miller  24:09
Yeah, so it would be I mean, the only difference okay, so like, if somebody wants a bunch of, you know, a pallet of some kind of raw material, I don't know where then that would be a sales order. With no building but with miscellaneous items for that. Yeah. And if somebody buys a garage with a ramp I believe that's much the same way except you know, sales whatever building in a ramp is a miscellaneous item. So

Speaker 1  24:54
do we want out of the loop here, but is the idea If it's an accessory with a building, it just gets, it just goes to buildings as part of the building.

Matthias Miller  25:08
Like it currently goes to whatever the default income account is for a with a sales order.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
Yeah, which would be building

Matthias Miller  25:16
which would be building so that's where it all goes right now. Yeah, we could change we could change the let me see if we can can

Speaker 1  25:25
we think can we change it to where if there's no building attached or connected to it? Like there's no structure that it would go to whatever gets put in their

Matthias Miller  25:46
income account? So we could say something like I don't know if we want to do this but if not Hazaragi, so building steppin.

Matthias Miller  26:09
Financial accounts

Matthias Miller  26:23
where if it's

Matthias Miller  26:31
it would be like if it doesn't have a building, it goes through a different revenue account. Yeah,

Speaker 1  26:38
I mean, like building materials is generally what it's going to be. Not always though necessarily.

Matthias Miller  26:46
I mean, do you want to? Which wouldn't be a revenue account? That's a asset account, right? No,

Unknown Speaker  26:55
it says those revenue. Account? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:03
So that would be one way to handle it. And then accessories, just sort of the miscellaneous items just follows the main sales one revenue account?

Unknown Speaker  27:15
When when there's the building?

Matthias Miller  27:20
Whether or not there's a building?

Speaker 1  27:24
So how does the accessory or if it's miscellaneous sales or

Matthias Miller  27:29
whether it has a building attached? If it's not, it's not 100% accurate. But basically, you're saying if if you have a building on the sales order, then the buildings is the default revenue account? And if you don't, then raw materials is the default revenue account. That's not right. We can't just use steppin. If there's, I don't know, Legacy sales orders would always go. So if it's a legacy sales order, or it has a building, I don't know we might need.

Speaker 1  28:09
Well, so why is there a GL account that can be selected in that miscellaneous section?

Matthias Miller  28:18
So that you can override it? Bottom line,

Unknown Speaker  28:22
override the default or to override what you put in there?

Matthias Miller  28:27
Well, it's

Speaker 1  28:29
really that's what's happening now. Like they've been putting in building materials. They're in these miscellaneous ones. And but that's not where it's going.

Matthias Miller  28:42
Correct. And so, I believe, let me see this is right.

Matthias Miller  28:58
Meaning for accessories. Yeah. I mean, so the change that is going live will start using the, whatever account is specified there. And if none is specified, it will use the default parent account. But it means now that we're not doing any searching, we had said, Hey, we want to use searching. We're not doing any of that. And we're not using the approval process that we said we were wanting to use.

Speaker 1  29:23
Oh, so what is the searching?

Matthias Miller  29:28
I think we said things like site prep. And well, I don't know, site prep will be a big one. I don't know what else there is. So we said we don't want we don't want salespeople to have to think about how they're going to put stuff in so we're just going to do a search. And if it says site prep with a space without a space with typos with this, that and the other then we're going to default into whatever the site prep revenue account should be over

Speaker 1  30:08
And now it'd be based on, you'd be searching that description, whatever they put in as a description.

Matthias Miller  30:13
Right? So my proposal was, if you type in description site prep, we would go searching through the accessory search. And if there's a matching one, we set the account to that matching one. Right, right. And then, you know, if you put in a ramp we put in, I don't know. I'm not saying this is actually what it would be, but so that would. So we could default it like that. Now, there's a few questions that happen. One is, like suppose at the point that you at the point that you invoice it? I wonder if this becomes okay, if somebody says no, no, this wasn't site prep. This was a discount of $100. And we would update this to the discount. But what happens if it was? Do you want to always update the account? If somebody modifies the description and see what see what matches instead? Is there a you want to be able to lock it down with the approved checkbox? You can't modify it? Do you want an approval process on these?

Unknown Speaker  32:11
I mean, I'm not sure like

Speaker 1  32:23
the, I think the search thing is good. The problem is still should be that approval process. But I'm just wondering, should we if we have the approval process, do we need the search thing? Or do we just tell them? You know, here are your accounts? Use the one that makes sense. And then if the approval thing, you know, doesn't work, then like, the approval thing should catch it.

Matthias Miller  32:55
So are you going to be doing the approval?

Speaker 1  32:58
That's what I want to know what what the approval? I don't know what the system is?

Matthias Miller  33:05
Well, there is none. Right? It's make your own. So I mean, we can we can show you a report of all sales orders and unapproved items. And then you could go through it and make changes and then highlight them and just, you know, approve selected recall.

Speaker 1  33:26
And this will just pull out just the ones that have miscellaneous items.

Unknown Speaker  33:30
Correct?

Speaker 1  33:36
Yeah, we probably should. If we have if we have a report like that, that makes it simple to just pull the record would it be a thing that would show the miscellaneous lines in the report? Or would it be just a list of sales orders and then you have to open each?

Matthias Miller  34:01
I would show the list of I basically show probably what I'd show is there I should while I'm making this up? I feel like the improv comedian making his own jokes and then writing down all right, so what I would do is report on all sales orders with miscellaneous items. And the columns would be so Id maybe group by company, so Id is it only invoice items or invoices, sales orders before invoicing.

Speaker 1  34:54
I don't know that it matters as long as they can be changed before and after. It's really not doesn't matter

Matthias Miller  35:04
so, order date bill to name or and then miscellaneous item description total price notes account

Unknown Speaker  35:28
then the approval checkbox

Matthias Miller  35:30
yeah I think

Speaker 1  35:40
that would work and then and then the the more we can actually train people on what is supposed to be the more everything will flow better

Unknown Speaker  35:54
Yeah

Matthias Miller  36:07
something like that all right this is a oh let's see. So this is a delegate to Jonathan and everything

Unknown Speaker  36:26
okay

Matthias Miller  36:28
I like it so that handles number one number two number three I need to actually let's do this now that people progress the problem it's a process problem

Matthias Miller  37:06
this so not live Do you see about getting Josh to push out an update tonight? We're yes

Speaker 1  37:20
this would kind of majorly affect our our income statement because it's saying all this little stuff is on buildings and there's nothing in materials and the guys are gonna look at it and say well yeah, we've sold a bunch of little things. And there are right so I would say push live without the whole approval process thing and let's just see what it says have taking the accounts that that were put in there

Unknown Speaker  37:53
okay

Matthias Miller  37:59
insert not listed on transactions report. Let me go pull up these invoices a it's let's see if this copied correctly. All right. Let's try this you can make transactions huh? Vi accounting impact. Yes, yes. We need a macro that turns this into a pretty table that we can or a anyway, we'll get to that VI accounting impact. Were a little checkbox that shows what it thinks it should be even if it's not valid. All kinds of fancy stuff we can do it Okay, let's see let's try this now. Count impact their errors oops

Matthias Miller  39:08
missing account All right, we're missing an account somewhere um,

Unknown Speaker  39:13
so one of the lines

Matthias Miller  39:18
I wonder if one of these is

Matthias Miller  39:26
do we have any NMAP ledger accounts? Soon as for ABC?

Unknown Speaker  39:30
I believe all probably

Matthias Miller  39:35
I would think so.

Speaker 1  39:38
Yep, yep. Okay, um so that that professional services accounting just needs I thought I connected now. Let's see. Maybe I just did oh, probably just on is supposed to be on that accounting general now.

Matthias Miller  40:06
Oh, this one they have the wrong.

Speaker 1  40:09
Oh, yep. Because we changed here never changed it there that needs there.

Matthias Miller  40:17
Oh, this one should be accounting general. And so Alright, let's try this VI accounting impact or confirmation? Oh, well actually impact errors, make sure I'll do

Speaker 1  40:37
it. Yeah, that's it. Okay. I'll look at the other ones. Okay. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  40:49
I'm showing a status of draft these are showing correctly for reconciles reconcile should not be showing draft transactions so

Speaker 1  40:58
well, it's in the Yeah, I don't know why. But it just the note, I wasn't even looking at notifications. And it's just hollering about all these drafts. And it's, I haven't had to not show up. So I don't know

Matthias Miller  41:19
what I just Okay, let's do this. No. Let's try this. Draft transactions. Draft transactions open for more than 15 days. 35, six of ABC. Primary checking? Yeah, that's a bog. They should not. They should not be? I don't think you should. It doesn't make sense to me that you would reconcile a draft transaction.

Speaker 1  41:56
What's it claiming as a draft? What's supposed to be a draft?

Matthias Miller  42:01
Usually drafts are for Willie, what, excuse me, what's what crafters uses it for is you've got the press, you know, bookkeeper, interest transaction. And then management reviews, and markson is posted, once they confirm that they're categorized correctly. What we've done informally, what I've done informally is, if you're confident where you're putting it, it's more the more the assume you're right. And if you don't know market the draft, and then review the drafts.

Speaker 1  42:43
Because on my entries, I haven't, I've never even messed with it. I mean, they always came through everywhere I was looking for sample, so I had to change them to anything else. But that's

Matthias Miller  42:57
weird. But this one's posted. So let's see what oh, the auditor, the MC. Yeah, this one's an automatic transaction. So it's posted because we set the status to posted for automatic transactions. That's why there's not more than think. But it's weird that they're not doing well, do you want to change all of these to posted?

Speaker 1  43:26
I mean, yeah, as far as I know, I've made every single one of them. So like, what I'm saying is I don't think anybody else has been has been creating like only transactions. Everybody else is coming through from something else. Sales Order.

Matthias Miller  43:47
I mean, we can, we would actually not be that hard. Created by record created by string. Counting transaction, trans. count, count transaction ID. All right, let's do this. And let's do this. And let's write a line this to make it easier to read. Drew drew drew drew Yeah. It's all you all right. So modify all records. Yeah. It's always fun. transaction status equals posted. Mark posted. All right.

Matthias Miller  44:58
Dwayne doesn't like when I do it like Because because it freezes the system until it's done probably should have done in smaller batches but anyway sorry doing

Speaker 1  45:10
so can you can you make that it just defaults transactions being created as posted for now and then if we come to where we have multiple people doing things we might need to relook at that

Matthias Miller  45:26
versus those two transactions Sure.

Matthias Miller  45:36
Actually, let me

Matthias Miller  45:43
see if we can default new transactions to posted also Why are draft transactions showing up in reconcile?

Speaker 1  45:53
Well actually what you could do is leave them as a draft and then when they are cleared they would they would switch to post it just automatically because because if it cleared it's well I guess we're talking about the expense side

Matthias Miller  46:19
you might I mean, you might still have other transactions that'll never get posted. Right?

Speaker 1  46:27
If it can be just put the posted for right now. Let's just do that. Let's

Matthias Miller  46:32
face it and see the retail need to get Joe's sign up but it should be pretty trivial. All right, I'm linked from vendor invoice I thought I had a Jonathan we just added a link to the vendor invoice for something didn't we?

Unknown Speaker  47:07
Do what was it

Matthias Miller  47:22
this would be zfp Let's try for Neck. Neck. What'd you do? Let's see

Matthias Miller  47:43
me too Johnson.

Speaker 1  47:46
I mean, I'm not seeing any link for it

Matthias Miller  47:57
well,

Speaker 1  47:59
yeah, because if you if you click the payment method, while you're not in an edit mode, it goes to editing the payment method. Right? I mean, if if you're not in edit mode, and you click the Check ID that would you know, if you'd want to make the check Id be the be the link that would be one thing that would work and pray we confuse them if they're in edit mode though. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:26
we'll just have you check. Add View checks link to

Matthias Miller  48:37
checks search vendor invoice number oh. If we just do fill in company pay or even just payee plus vendor invoice number. Okay. And view checks link to vendor invoice under the Create ACH Payment button, add a view checks link that is visible if and then this one is check. Textbook Vietnam ID

Speaker 1  49:35
Are they able to edit checks if AP goes in there? Yeah. I mean, it shouldn't be a problem. You know, I mean, they're just simply going there so that they can mostly it's, you know, stuff was paid by multiple or there's multiple vendors. invoices on one check. So what they're trying to find out is what was the total of the check that paid this particular bill? So, I mean, I'm simply going there for information not to do anything.

Matthias Miller  50:20
Well, we've, we have historically with assist taken a very basic approach is, number one, we do put things in place to keep you from doing a gregarious ly stupid things that you might not know better. But to also, broadly speaking of there's a wide open playing field and just don't venture too far outside of your job description. So if it's if it's an issue, we can address it. Does it matter if if you have an unprinted check, is it okay if the link shows up? But you don't? You don't see any check? Because it's unprinted. Or do you? Should we add an option here to include unprinted checks who shows up?

Speaker 1  51:19
Um yeah, I mean, you could just if it's a non printed check, you could go to that. I suppose. I mean, it's really only going to be for the day of like, it's going to still be a bunch of unprinted checks for part of a day usually that's that'll be the norm

Speaker 1  51:47
but they might be looking on that day. I don't know I mean, it should Wow.

Matthias Miller  51:51
Let's do this

Matthias Miller  51:59
okay, so this one over to Jonathan it's pretty straightforward change

Speaker 1  52:10
how soon do you think he could get that on?

Matthias Miller  52:14
Well, he's gonna excuse me he's gonna have a bunch of stuff he's supposed to get wrapped up by next in time for next week

Matthias Miller  52:34
so I'll see if that's possible applying building intensive labor to buildings prior to built would this be

Unknown Speaker  52:51
learned business Warfield?

Speaker 3  53:00
Oh Matthias on that does it mean does does the request make sense or not? Or like yeah, use case man. I was expecting maybe it's just a recording thing right now when you go to report when you try to apply a labor intensive amount to a building it only shows you the buildings that were built in that week I believe which makes sense

Matthias Miller  53:29
do you have a report that hey

Unknown Speaker  53:32
roll

Matthias Miller  53:40
let's see payroll

Matthias Miller  53:47
it's trying to

Unknown Speaker  53:49
I think it's probably time cards but I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  53:52
Oh, got it.

Unknown Speaker  53:56
Yeah, on payroll

Matthias Miller  53:58
accounts and once an additional 500

Unknown Speaker  54:02
Yeah, so let's just look at shit time maybe

Matthias Miller  54:12
to slash the team

Unknown Speaker  54:21
missing what it is Monday three four does that

Unknown Speaker  54:36
what is going on?

Matthias Miller  54:47
not showing any

Matthias Miller  54:54
Okay,

Speaker 3  55:01
Okay, where do we add where do we add labor intensive we want to look at where we add labor intensive amount which maybe maybe gives them time carbs

Matthias Miller  55:12
would be I mean the verification report we can see that no the

Unknown Speaker  55:25
payroll verification report

Matthias Miller  55:29
I don't have I don't have access to payroll or something

Matthias Miller  55:57
who are super administrators automation counting view payroll view and edit payroll costs okay so administrators

Matthias Miller  56:28
I'm pretty confused

Matthias Miller  56:35
I'm going to try this and see if it gives me access Okay, well owner payroll verification for shared time No.

Unknown Speaker  56:54
Yeah, the wrong shit. There we go

Matthias Miller  57:10
pool adjustment maybe that's not since the inner verification. Let's do the verification. keystroke can be payroll should have time we're

Matthias Miller  57:33
building justments We don't have any for this week but it's so

Speaker 3  57:37
good you apply those building and the problem is middlings We're now wanting to apply them it all works fine if we apply them to a building that was built in a given week. But if it wasn't Mark built yet then a sequel The cry so

Matthias Miller  57:59
what date do you want to use for for the labor intensive building

Speaker 3  58:14
what is the okay what do we see now if we go to say like shed time and look at labor intensive buildings for this week what are the buildings we could select to apply a labor intensive amount what what buildings do we

Matthias Miller  58:36
I mean I don't know sure

Speaker 3  58:45
because but but where would like what would the AP people also do payroll where do they go? So like like What the You know where where's the report they would go to to select and apply labor intensive amounts to a specific building

Matthias Miller  59:07
Well, that's I'm honestly not sure. Let me see. Let

Matthias Miller  59:20
me check the user folder. Okay, let's see pay no accounting search

Speaker 3  59:49
he's not sure where they find that either. We just they just it worked.

Matthias Miller  59:55
I mean, it gets automatically applied like here's one. Has it done Then date for 229 This is built here, let's do this. So this one, here's one, Britney brown deadline date for third was already built. Okay, let's see if there's any with with it and building calc labor intensive amount is greater than zero and is an a building built date

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
building calc labor intensive amount, so how are we calculating labor intensive amount it's based on the

Speaker 3  1:00:41
width is this is not for automatically calculated labor intensive months this is for when the builder says on this building because it's such and such I want to pay I am going to pay my guys another $500 Because this building was was a build on site three hours away. And they just communicate that to with the timecard. And then there's a place we built for Wayne when people doing payroll to just find that building and enter it like manually key add on to that building.

Matthias Miller  1:01:22
I mean, they can hear I mean, they could say, oh, okay, whatever they want to.

Speaker 3  1:01:29
So but can they do that on a building prior to it being built? So you look. But yeah, find find a building that has not been built yet and see if we can do that.

Matthias Miller  1:01:45
Reverse sort of a deadline date

Speaker 3  1:01:50
all of the, these would have been built. So just yeah, just pick any of these.

Matthias Miller  1:01:54
So this one's not built to go in here. So but but the issue here is that. So then, at the point that it gets built, that's when the when a when the when it gets included in the pool, but you can enter it beforehand.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:17
Okay, but but but

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
does it get stomped on when you build it?

Speaker 3  1:02:25
Well, it I don't know. But we're wanting to say, okay, work orders, is it? Can you find work orders, you can select the amount, or you can enter the amount? And then I think you can say what day you want to apply it. Let's let's let's look at a work order first. That's, I think what we can do on a work order is what we want to do with labor intensive abundance.

Matthias Miller  1:02:51
Okay, here's the work order. Right, you have an effective date. So

Speaker 3  1:02:57
yeah, well, that's what we want is, is the ability to do a labor intensive with an effective date being billed.

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
So you would. So basically, when we automatically apply labor intensive amount, we would set the effective date to the build date. Sorry, yeah, when we play it automatically. It's not specified when you build it, and we go calculate it and set the effective date as the build date. Otherwise, you and then we always require an effective date. Makes sense. Let me make a few notes here to make sure labor intensive buildings add new labor intensive amounts feel sorry, labor intensive Effective Date field set to building built to date, if labor intensive amount is specified, change automatic labor intensive calculation to set effective date and then do not auto calc as specified before build and require effective date and or amount if either is specified. All right. I think that's pretty straightforward. Pretty clear.

Speaker 3  1:04:25
So is that how big a change is that I mean, is that something that it's, we would use it but the workaround for right now is we say well, we just go find another building that was built that week and we just put it on on the wrong building. Short term so I mean

Matthias Miller  1:04:54
I mean, it's not it's not terrible. Okay, but let's fit

Speaker 3  1:05:02
it in when you have time, and let us know once it's done.

Matthias Miller  1:05:05
Okay, I'll do that. All right, um, just to make sure we're on the same page, are we planning to drop again at 12?

Speaker 3  1:05:19
Yeah, well, okay, how does this afternoon look, we have potential meetings up until 230, then, but then after that we could do we would have be available to do like 230 or three o'clock. If that would work for you. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:41
that works. I'm gonna, I'm dropping out here in the middle of the day for a bit. We're heading up to the mountains and have no storm coming in. So we're going to try to put a beat that it'll be working from a coffee shop the rest of the day, so Okay, 30s to 30s 230 or three is good. You guys can. I'm happy planning on on 230. And if it needs to be later, you can shoot me an email if that works.

Speaker 3  1:06:13
So well plan for 230. Yeah, at least and we would have at least an hour available. Okay. And good. So are we ready for eight?

Matthias Miller  1:06:30
Yes, we are ready for eight.

Speaker 3  1:06:32
This is this is currently both of our top priority. There are several pieces missing before we can complete these two pieces which I have lost here is and the biggest one I think is if we could have a cause were two reasons. One is we can have a breakdown of the invoices report. I just emailed you a file from files with a whole bunch of columns using a report that you had created earlier. Last year, if you want to open that and just share it with

Matthias Miller  1:07:12
you let me grab it.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
So the the intent of this is two things. One is to validate the revenue and the cogs on the income statement. We've been like Drew said dredging up a bunch of issues on these income statements just like

Speaker 3  1:07:48
not Yeah, just. And then the second part is just for a more of the an FYI. Showing validating to builders. Here's how we got these revenue and cogs amounts, because it's so different from what we the QuickBooks. So I pulled this report, which is a report you created last year sometime. And the blue columns and the blue headers are fields that would be helpful to be to add, and what I like to show is all buildings, whether it be three reports, one for coming all buildings filled with all buildings that have an invoice date of January one through January 31 24.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:45
Which should should match what we're showing on the income statement. I don't know how I mean, I'm expecting this is pretty straightforward. And I was I was hoping this is something that maybe I'm being overly optimistic that could be created today and we could look at it at 230 Maybe I'm being unrealistic here but

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
so the and then if we could have this as a user report where

Matthias Miller  1:09:26
drew could poke around with or we could

Speaker 3  1:09:27
use a drew could use it on his sites. So we will be adding customer name, which is pretty straightforward. Building size, building description, invoice date. And then the next columns are just breakdowns of the different GL accounts. Now, if there's anything there that you say, Wow, this is this field is hard to bring into this report, then I would you know let's talk but this is kind of

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
Here's what I would do, I would

Matthias Miller  1:10:13
I would just have this be a column of, we would calculate for each of these, we would calculate what we think the accounting impact should be. And just find the GL accounts used by all the all the everything in the report. And we can, we can multiply out that column based on all the accounts used by all of all these items that we think should be used by all of these items. And it should match accounting

Matthias Miller  1:10:48
with a adjusted for increase, decrease amounts based and Okay, bottom line is, I don't know if it's going to be 100% identical to what you're showing here. But I think I can get you a report that gives you meets the same objectives that you're after.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:12
Okay. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
good. Yeah, I think you. But that's fine. That's good.

Matthias Miller  1:11:27
Let me oops, thing. All right, and then we're going to

Matthias Miller  1:11:41
Alright, I will try to get that done before we circled back around.

Speaker 3  1:11:50
And this would be so how would What are you planning to create? Would this be an Excel export? Are you creating a user report that you could

Matthias Miller  1:12:02
I would create a user report that you can export to Excel. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:06
good.

Speaker 3  1:12:10
Something else I don't have on the list, but where the end that we haven't looked that we need to look at for closing a month is can you just show drew where you created a report and not the sales orders needing invoicing but the one where all sales orders hang out before assists thinks they need to be invoiced. And we need to go we we might not do it for January but we need okay sales orders are perfect to go through that and say are there any that for whatever reason need to be invoiced and haven't been invoiced?

Speaker 3  1:12:49
Okay, you have not ready to invoice and then you had a second section I believe

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
I think these are let's see what the section was. I mean it was ready to invoice when we think what you know based on all the rules that we came up with so proposed invoice date, like I don't know if you remember this this thing here numbered a while still recovering from it properly. So if I mean basically the only things that would show up because the invoicing process is happening daily. You might have a few down to the bottom that are top How did we saw it? We said you might have a few of the top would say that it's ready to invoice

Speaker 3  1:13:45
but they would kick out or they would go to the other report the next morning.

Matthias Miller  1:13:48
Right exactly

Speaker 3  1:13:55
so so yeah, we'd have to go through these and just say wow, like why is this one that invoice like some of these are really old. There's Okay, and then the last piece is good. This is East our this report is no where was it?

Matthias Miller  1:14:19
Aging on sales data maintenance, on invoiced sales we're aging so to show you yet sales data maintenance invoiced a sales order aging

Matthias Miller  1:14:42
do if you if you take your sales orders and you put them in ice water, you can reverse the aging effect. I do that with everything that everything I get just by being more time on my terms.

Speaker 3  1:14:57
And then the last question was Custom Cost of Goods not being listed on income statements if you open an income statements for let's just pick one, say a portable barn company do for the month of January. You

Speaker 3  1:15:26
and hit include budget amounted Wow, no, that's fine. There we got nothing there anyway, but because we haven't

Speaker 3  1:15:44
so the problem is there's there's nothing. We had a bunch of materials come in that were not inventory items. So we just expensive immediately to cost and cost of goods. But there's no the income statement shows no materials and costs and cost of goods. So we're trying to figure out what happened or why why why not?

Matthias Miller  1:16:09
All right. Most well. Did you manually? Did you manually create these transactions?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:21
Okay, now, there's raw materials there.

Matthias Miller  1:16:24
I drew the the draft transactions probably fixed your income statement? Yeah. Okay, well.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:39
That probably has changed considerably, then. Well, I'm

Speaker 3  1:16:42
just looking at me just grabbed a copy to the end. Well, there's so much stuff that changed that it's,

Speaker 1  1:16:48
yeah, there's RTO premiums, I don't know if those were all open door would have been ones that I created. Promotional does,

Speaker 3  1:16:58
when you say created manually, was that just like it just

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
made a transaction?

Speaker 3  1:17:05
What the cost and cost of goods, those would have gone through a II, like they normally like those would have had an invoice created.

Matthias Miller  1:17:15
So let's take a look. At General Ledger. There

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
there are now

Matthias Miller  1:17:22
I mean, we can take a look at these. Why wouldn't they be this one is this? I did the expanded version here just to make sure that I mean, that doesn't really show anything different. Materials All right, let's goodness this is painful. We if we did spend some time around that.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54
Is this one of your slowest reports in

Unknown Speaker  1:17:59
the Transaction Search might be slower, but less of the slowest.

Speaker 3  1:18:07
Dwayne was telling me that and maybe this has been done already that Josh is planning to move assist to a dedicated server which should speed up or should my understanding from Dwayne is it won't optimize reports, but it would speed up the core functionality or it could speed up the core functionality and

Matthias Miller  1:18:29
functionality. But it does not make sense to me why? I mean, this should have been showing up on your income statement previously. These are not ones that would have been affected by Oh, they weren't

Speaker 3  1:18:49
mean we just looked at him. I mean, you created those a week ago maybe Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:18:57
I mean those those income statements that we were reviewing were created last Thursday night out for social

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
Oh, yeah. About

Speaker 1  1:19:07
11 o'clock February, still February. Yeah, it

Matthias Miller  1:19:17
was definitely the 11th hour I mean, I don't understand why these should have been showing up on your there's nothing that would have changed that should have kept him from showing up. So

Speaker 3  1:19:31
those paper copies I want to look at some of the operational expenses some of the other areas see if anything has changed there because we we reviewed transactions for all the output pretty much all the operational expenses and those all seem legit

Speaker 1  1:20:06
I can just pull it up and we can get alerted to move on. That

Matthias Miller  1:20:10
might be a good idea. Well,

Speaker 3  1:20:12
so Matthias, I think this covers what? What we had on ease. We want it. Like I said, this is currently our top priority get these validated, get them out. And then

Matthias Miller  1:20:37
work on on

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
clothing 2023.

Matthias Miller  1:20:44
Okay, let me just make sure there's no last few minutes. Accessory counts. We've talked about credit memos. You want to talk through credit memos this afternoon? Or do you want to bump them till next? kind of scared about bumping anything? Because everything bumps everything else? But

Speaker 3  1:21:03
I think we have time we should talk about it coming. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:21:07
on the statement reconciles. Is there anything you need to know knows? Okay, kind of want to put that first? Like, the historical reconciles makes those mounds the balance that changed? Anything that you need? I

Matthias Miller  1:21:29
don't think so the only thing? Well, we would have the you would have entered all the starting and ending balances. So we know what they're supposed to be. So just be a matter of getting. So you should be able to tell. If I if I pull that stuff back, I should be able to see it coming to balance, hopefully. So I don't think there's anything that I need. But I don't know that we'll be able to do much with that before. Well, I could do some work on that. But the update tonight when we go change the PIO transactions is going to throw things sideways again. It's a little bit of a whack a mole until we get a real fix in place.

Speaker 1  1:22:14
Are you going to be able to apply the the historically reconciled ones to their to their reconcile dates that I put in and we're gonna be able to do that or is that? Okay.

Speaker 3  1:22:32
Okay, so Matthias, interestingly enough, the, the both raw materials we have we have a 50 dot 27.105. That one was blank. When we looked at it. Yeah, we could go. And the 150 29 105 logistic shed repairs and site were the raw materials there. That was also blank. So but like the revenue number, the total revenue, exactly same. The standard cogs numbers. Exactly this thing. Yeah, those are dead on most of the operating expenses I looked at are exactly the same. The few that have changed, I think or changes that we made. So I don't know. I mean, it looks correct. To me, it looks accurate. But I guess it raises a question. Is this something we should be concerned about? Or

Matthias Miller  1:23:38
what was this specific date that you were could you would you be able to send me a copy of that income statement with the date that you generated it?

Speaker 1  1:23:56
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think it's,

Speaker 3  1:23:59
I don't know if you feel like it's not worth our time chasing it right now. It might not be incredibly.

Matthias Miller  1:24:08
Um, I can't let's just say this. I can't find any reason here. I mean, just taking a look at it. This this transaction was created on we changed the reference number for the transaction existed since the 16th of January on this account there and it was posted at that point, which we can see right here. So there, it does not make sense to me. Why wait, who? This guy does not make sense to me why this wouldn't show up on the income statement.

Speaker 3  1:24:50
It doesn't have anything to do with the receipts not ballots or change you're making? Probably not. Because that change has gone live it has no

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
When it hasn't gone live this is so this is operating off of a this is operating off of the vendor invoice get

Speaker 3  1:25:08
because all of these would have had purchase order in the vendor invoice. I don't know. Does that have any? It shouldn't no.

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
Hang on. Did you guys do the mapping of accounts since then? No. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:25:28
Well, I'd say, for the sake of time, I'm fine with leaving good enough alone and we deal with it and it shows up later we focus on it. Okay. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:25:39
I'm fine with that. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Well, we will talk around Oh, pleasure talking to you 30 And let me know if you guys need a bit later. Sounds good. Like you appreciate that.
