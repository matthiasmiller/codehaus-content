Matthias Miller  00:46
Hey. One of my friends once pointed out that the Hebrew word for the word of the Lord can be translated as burden,

Unknown Speaker  00:57
wait, word of

Matthias Miller  00:58
the Lord, the word of the Lord, and everyone's a while experiences, especially in certain types of writing,

Unknown Speaker  01:12
where,

Matthias Miller  01:18
where I know that there's a poll or A draw on it, or a call to it, and you get to the end and you're like, No, this thing was there was a weightiness to it, and that's off my shoulders, like I got it out. So that's kind of what I'm feeling now.

Speaker 1  01:36
Well, the best thing to do after is to just, you know, release the outcome, like a like a balloon, all the pressure, right? I get, I

Matthias Miller  02:04
uh, apple and cherry pie. If you were here, you could have some, um, yes, yes and yes. And by the way, um,

Unknown Speaker  02:18
I

Matthias Miller  02:20
have this other article that I wrote called unstoppable. Just thought of this as I was talking about this. I don't think it ties into this, but it's called unstoppable force, which talks about the layers of you know, you've got skills, and then you've got the cognitive aspect, then you get the motivational aspect, and then you've got the spiritual aspect. And each of these are so skills is like a weak force condition, more powerful force motivation, interesting motivation, more powerful force, spiritual, whatever, like the maximum force. Yeah, so anyway, I'll precursors. Anyway you were making comments. I don't know where you want to go. Well, I guess, sorry. Tell me about one more thing. Here's my thing. I want to get this thing out so you guide what you're

Speaker 1  03:28
seeing well. So so first I thought there was just a few pages, and then I became 13. Did you add?

Matthias Miller  03:38
So when we first talked, when we talked, it was external force number three, three. And then I pulled in the 100 proof, the ice Miller and the invitation.

Speaker 1  03:53
And the 100 proof, this is, this is your other this was on the website.

Matthias Miller  04:02
It's a form of what was on the website. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  04:09
okay,

Matthias Miller  04:11
but if this is completely unnecessary, then let's, well,

Speaker 1  04:14
let me, let me separate it. I just, I just feel like this might be repetitive. It might be,

Unknown Speaker  04:35
well, I guess you're not talking about the pillars yet.

Speaker 2  04:39
Okay. Um,

Matthias Miller  04:47
it's very a long winded explanation, trying to defend it may be, may prove to be completely unnecessary. Why am I the guy who um? No,

Matthias Miller  05:09
yeah, sometimes it's the person who argues most vehemently that he's the strongest person who's actually the weakest. And I mean, maybe it's just an attempt to hyper persuade or maybe

Unknown Speaker  05:24
it's completely irrelevant. It

Matthias Miller  05:27
makes it really long.

Speaker 1  05:29
Yeah, I think so, at least let me so

Matthias Miller  05:36
why wouldn't this be a separate document, like a, let's say, if I wanted to do an about I don't even know that I need to, let's say I wanted to do an about page.

Unknown Speaker  05:50
I don't even know. Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  05:56
Okay, so structurally, you have double edged sword, unfortunate outcome, true weapon and cure. And then you have forces so you have, we just list that

Unknown Speaker  06:26
external forces.

Unknown Speaker  06:29
You have external force,

Matthias Miller  06:36
no, the double, double edged sword could also be okay. Let's just list it out.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
I'm listing at the top, yep, I see it.

Unknown Speaker  06:47
Unfortunate outcome two, weapon cure.

Speaker 1  06:54
So does that i is that the hierarchy,

Unknown Speaker  07:07
maybe something like that. Okay, now,

Matthias Miller  07:17
but there's other ways to frame this, like it could be the external force. It could be conventional wisdom.

Unknown Speaker  07:28
Yeah, the

Unknown Speaker  07:30
High School Outcome, good.

Speaker 1  07:32
I like false prophets because it it's like, hey, there's these false voices, and they confuse the inner knowing they were against, okay, true weapon. Okay, so the double edged sword is you. It's worked for you, but there's the downside, and that's the unfortunate outcome. Yes. So one thing I was thinking of is, if you're gonna say,

Matthias Miller  08:15
if you use a medicinal thing,

Speaker 1  08:18
yeah, you could say poison, The poison and medicine, or the poison and right.

Unknown Speaker  08:38
The So,

Speaker 1  08:45
yeah, so, so there's a couple mixed metaphors. There's force swords and gears. So I think those are three separate ones. And, yep, I All

Unknown Speaker  09:08
right, let's try this.

Unknown Speaker  09:12
Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  09:15
it's not perfect, but I can get my AirPods back a bit, a bit. I mean, what we all know, the side effects that are worse than the than

Unknown Speaker  09:27
the illness.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
Yeah, up.

Unknown Speaker  09:45
I like, I mean, true weapon can work. I.

Matthias Miller  11:13
So true weapon and cure. The cure is not something I'm delighted with.

Speaker 1  11:17
That's what I would draw. I think, double edged sword, and then the true weapon works.

Matthias Miller  11:33
I mean, this is really the outcome from the if this is the unfortunate outcome, this is the promise land, for lack of a better term for

Unknown Speaker  11:46
The

Unknown Speaker  11:48
victory,

Unknown Speaker  11:51
signature victory.

Unknown Speaker  11:55
I like that, and then I

Speaker 3  12:06
unexpected defeat. I

Matthias Miller  12:25
I like that. You like it.

Speaker 1  12:29
That's better. Yeah, the cure wasn't working with sword. So I think this, this is enough. I

Matthias Miller  12:43
Sorry. Melvin also gave, this is interesting. Melvin also gave me a word about swords being in the logo for some of the stuff that I'm doing, which I just kind of filed away and like, that's

Speaker 1  12:53
you. You gave a sword to Perry, right? Yeah, I did. So I I just, I can't tell you enough, you're targeting men. Just reading all of this, it's all about men. Yeah, I would say like even women wouldn't be talking about competition.

Matthias Miller  13:23
No, it's only because they had to, not because

Speaker 1  13:32
I don't think they, they don't frame their life in terms of competition, right? Okay, so, okay, instead of external force, I would talk about like the battle, the three battles, right there are the three wars, or the three,

Matthias Miller  13:50
three war zones, battle zones, battlefronts, Battlefront

Speaker 1  13:55
I was looking I was looking for the front Like the edges. The three were the fights the most intense, the three battle fronts. The Battlefront. I love that. Okay, look at that. Now it's

Speaker 1  14:22
so I know you had the second edition, the 100 proof Matthias Miller, but

Unknown Speaker  14:31
just kill it. Archive it. Archive

Speaker 1  14:33
it because it doesn't hang with the internal structure. Sure, and, and I think it's repetitive, and it'd be too long. I

Matthias Miller  14:49
think, I think it is an interesting for people who really want to go deep, like I said, like a, almost like a, more by. Graphic will take on it, or a, about or a, okay, let's do a, let's do a replace with external force, Find and Replace external force. Number This with battle front number, this. We've got three. That's right, oh, is Battlefront one word?

Unknown Speaker  15:40
Well, it's a game.

Matthias Miller  15:44
I've seen that a game?

Unknown Speaker  15:48
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  15:49
I think it's one word, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:51
okay, let's redo this edit, find your place.

Matthias Miller  15:58
There's so many weird word plays you could have the, have you ever seen the BFF leaders? There's a Battlefront forever. They're always going to be there.

Speaker 1  16:08
I You could call it the war zone or battle

Unknown Speaker  16:17
firing line. I like Battle Battlefront. The enemy line,

Matthias Miller  16:26
enemy line. I like the enemy line too. Enemy line.

Unknown Speaker  16:35
It's similar to front line,

Matthias Miller  16:41
but it also implies external

Unknown Speaker  16:43
or external force, right?

Unknown Speaker  16:52
I do like enemy line. Okay,

Matthias Miller  16:54
so there's that, and then the double edged sword can be, find, replace the double edged sword stays. The unfortunate outcome becomes, here. Let me reject your change so that this gets replaced the unfortunate outcome.

Unknown Speaker  17:18
Just edit at the top. Well

Matthias Miller  17:22
I'm doing a fine to replace in the document. Oh, I see the unexpected defeat, 103, that's right. The true weapon is right, and then the cure is the signature victory

Speaker 1  17:38
in outline. This feels a lot better.

Unknown Speaker  17:43
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  17:49
this is insane.

Matthias Miller  17:52
Look at that. The unexpected defeat, the unfortunate outcome. No, no, the unfortunate the unexpected defeat. Oh,

Speaker 1  18:00
I change. What are you looking at? The

Matthias Miller  18:04
double edge. I replaced the wrong one. The unfortunate outcome is the unexpected. Okay, let's try this again. The cure to Okay, double edged sword, okay? And then the unfortunate outcome.

Speaker 1  18:18
Unfortunate outcome is the unexpected defeat.

Unknown Speaker  18:27
Unexpected defeat,

Matthias Miller  18:30
all right. Now, double edged sword, okay, I'm looking at the outline now, double edged sword, unexpected defeat, true weapon, signature, victory, bada. Bada, boom, oh, that is, that's tight. Man, that's really tight.

Speaker 1  18:50
So, so the one thing that's missing is I

Speaker 1  19:04
maybe there's another word to contrast with the sanctuary.

Matthias Miller  19:09
I mean, it's Warzone versus sanctuary,

Speaker 1  19:13
or it's part of its it's, maybe it's, are you taking? You don't fight at the enemy line. You fight from the same the place of sanctuary, like most people are trying to control, external control, right? Because it's an external force.

Matthias Miller  19:40
Um, I mean, it's a little bit of the Sun Tzu. Victorious Warriors win first and go to war. Defeated warriors go to war first and seek to win.

Unknown Speaker  19:51
Okay, so

Speaker 1  19:59
this is. Makings of a community, because it's got its own myth, telling or myth. What do you call it?

Matthias Miller  20:08
Mythos? Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, it's cultural language, it's mythology, it's, you could this isn't the place for it, but you could very easily bring Beowulf into here, who was the inspiration to the sword anyway?

Speaker 1  20:21
Oh, really. Okay, that's a good story. Write that down. Write that down.

Matthias Miller  20:31
I mean, it's in my original email. I've got so many snippets and fragments and I mean,

Unknown Speaker  20:36
that's great

Matthias Miller  20:40
legend somewhere. I forget exactly where, somewhere I came across the idea that Beowulf strings broke the sword. And so I don't know if you noticed the picture of the sword. I don't know if I talked about this in the email, but the tip is broken off. Oh, so guy making it literally heated it red hot anyway, and just snapped the end up, which

Unknown Speaker  21:00
is awesome, nice.

Speaker 1  21:06
Okay, so you, you make us, you don't who made the sword?

Matthias Miller  21:12
I, I mean, I hired a local guy to make the sword. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  21:15
did you video it?

Matthias Miller  21:19
Um, he has someone is Facebook that we could hunt down, and he probably has someone on his phone if I, if I messaged him, you need

Unknown Speaker  21:25
to, you need to do that.

Speaker 1  21:31
Okay, you need to find the photo of you presenting the sword to Perry. You maybe add that to this sales page.

Unknown Speaker  21:43
Here is

Matthias Miller  21:52
words, this is nuts. What's nuts? Everything, everything I

Unknown Speaker  22:07
I knew I shouldn't come up with I knew this had to come from your sanctuary,

Matthias Miller  22:15
yeah, check this out. It's only because it's on dial pad on my void line. See, can you see this? Text messages? It's only it's this is the only reason why I have these crazy deadline less for the moment, drove my wife crazy because I made a slate for birthday party. There's science and religion. I had a molecule in a sword emblazed on it for his work on unify, ending the war between science and religion through evolution to window. Yeah. Then here's the discussion, and

Matthias Miller  23:11
then I send them the page.

Speaker 1  23:13
Oh, yeah. Just grab all the images. Post it. Post it in the folder, a full get a folder for the design elements on our shared Okay,

Unknown Speaker  23:29
man,

Matthias Miller  23:34
okay, let me. Let me do. Let me shoot an email right now. Ren 10.

Unknown Speaker  23:50
Ren 10

Matthias Miller  23:58
seeds at messaging net, square up surely. I've got an email. Let

Unknown Speaker  24:04
me. Let me do this.

Speaker 1  24:07
You can do that later. That's fine,

Unknown Speaker  24:10
okay. Well, let's all right. I

Speaker 1  24:30
or just say, Do you have a shared drive of our it'd be nice if he shared it online, the file, like, through Google Drive, not just on this page.

Matthias Miller  24:48
Yeah, that's where it was, like, if I could get his email, I.

Speaker 1  25:00
But I don't know, as you because you want, you want the more uncompressed version, right? If it goes to your phone, it'll

Unknown Speaker  25:12
compress.

Matthias Miller  25:15
Let's, let's, I, yeah, so you're saying, if I'd, if I'd, I

Speaker 2  25:24
uh, let's do this new folder, and

Matthias Miller  25:42
then let me change permissions, share, share. Anyone with the link can edit,

Speaker 2  25:55
add and edit files. Great. Um,

Speaker 2  26:13
any way you could upload all of the photos and videos of this sword to

Speaker 1  26:31
say, say, why I'm I am. I'm building a a community of men, and I want Beowulf to be a core part of our story.

Speaker 1  27:01
And your and and your, your and your, your craftsmanship is, and I want your craftsmanship to be a core part of our story. I

Matthias Miller  27:35
and then let's go back to this was I um,

Speaker 2  27:44
to make it easy for you, it would be back

Matthias Miller  27:49
in November or

Unknown Speaker  27:54
December of 2018 Yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:03
I Okay, so there's that I will. I created a folder just for him in there I can, okay, so, lead me.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
I, I think, I think you almost have enough to just tell me, tell me, tell me. What are your thoughts about just Working with men? I

Unknown Speaker  28:52
Hi, um,

Unknown Speaker  29:09
we both have black T shirts on.

Unknown Speaker  29:22
Hmm,

Unknown Speaker  30:12
All right, so what's what's your headphone? Again?

Matthias Miller  30:19
Vocal, Batiste, vocal, vocal, F, O, C, A, l,

Unknown Speaker  30:26
Batiste, okay, I got it. Which one is it? That's okay,

Matthias Miller  30:39
no worries. Give me I mean, I can pull up my Amazon order so fast, by the way, there's the moment when I thought I lost them. I just about been crazy

Speaker 1  30:47
when you Oh, well, I lost. I lost my headphones on the plane because someone was stepping out and they needed help with their luggage. And I took their luggage down, and then I was already outside of my seat, and I just exited.

Matthias Miller  31:07
No,

Unknown Speaker  31:08
I was so bummed.

Matthias Miller  31:12
All right, so there's a note, brainstorm, locale, peace. Those are the headphones.

Speaker 2  31:30
There's a here.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
They're probably, they're, they're not something I would get right for a few years.

Matthias Miller  31:47
I had to fight some internal resistance to get I have to tell you that,

Speaker 1  31:51
you know, I, I got, I got a treadmill treadly thing, and it's been great. It just, it's, it's changed my life anyways.

Matthias Miller  32:03
Oh, and also

Unknown Speaker  32:07
a hag capisco chair.

Speaker 1  32:09
Oh, yeah, it's, I've seen, I've seen that design, very nice. So, so men's work, you've got, you've got a brick wall, nothing, nothing hanging on the walls.

Matthias Miller  32:24
I want to change that. But I got, I got that stuff. Yeah, beautiful. I got, I got that stuff.

Speaker 1  32:32
By the way, great. You have a great spot to do one on one work.

Matthias Miller  32:40
I'm quite aware. And even small group

Speaker 1  32:44
and small group you, oh, since you like, since you appreciate the some you have, since you have a refined taste, get, get a glass board, not a whiteboard. Ooh,

Matthias Miller  33:06
I love that.

Speaker 1  33:10
I love that. Here's, here's a, okay, I don't, I don't have they're too expensive for me. But here's, I can get a small glass board. And I worked the, I was, like the marketing director for this, this magnet company, and one of our lines were magnets for glass, right? That's awesome. And guess, guess what I had designed. That's awesome. So I gave it. I gave a gift to Tim, of you know, 20 or 20 of those, something,

Matthias Miller  33:55
right? That, that is, I love it, man, I love it. I love I love personalized gifts, too. They're hard, but they're good. Oh

Speaker 1  34:04
yeah, there's a the spirited man. Do you know him? Okay? I will, I will send you a video and you can watch it. It's like, the best video about personal gifts. It's, it's great.

Matthias Miller  34:21
Kevin Thompson was also collaborating with John ruling before he passed. And that was his, anyway, that's he's the giftology guy,

Unknown Speaker  34:34
nice, which,

Matthias Miller  34:35
anyway, all right, so, all right, um, have to guide me, man, because I'm, I'm like, I know I want to get this out, but I don't know what to

Speaker 1  34:50
look so. So this doesn't need to be a now conversation, but I. Have a strong feel that your website, if not now, will will soon be 100 proof you or 100 proof man.

Matthias Miller  35:18
And the decision is, and I'm pretty sure, if I'm listening, who's going to talk to me, I'm going to guess, because I don't want to, I don't want to do it, that that's probably who he has, who's

Speaker 1  35:29
going to talk to you. Holy Spirit. Okay? And if we don't need it, okay? For now, just buy those domains.

Matthias Miller  35:44
Let me make sure. Let me see what I got. I think you purchase summary, 100 proof you 100 proof man.com I got both of them. And is it 100 proof? 100 Yes,

Unknown Speaker  36:02
not 100

Matthias Miller  36:04
not spelled out. Great. The other thing I thought about too is, I mean, you could also, I don't know how broad to go, but 100 proof leader and 100 proof executive, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  36:13
okay.

Speaker 1  36:20
Well, let's put a pit. Let's wait on that. I All right. I, I think this can go as a as a web page on, on the website, and it'll be, it'll be up at the top, top of the menu, and it'll be 100 preview. Or you could say, or just call it the manifesto, manifesto.

Unknown Speaker  36:57
Yeah. I um,

Unknown Speaker  37:09
yeah, call it the manifesto. And then

Speaker 1  37:21
I think the, I think the 15 minute needs to be, not about So, okay, there's, there's two there, there's, there's, there's outreach to new people on LinkedIn for a clarity shot. And one thing I'm want considering, tell me what you think is,

Speaker 1  38:00
if your website 15 minute one should just be a 15 minute consultation, it's not necessarily you doing sanctuary. You can give the 15 minute sanctuary time to LinkedIn, but your website should be a Connect, yeah,

Matthias Miller  38:28
maybe it would make sense to only have this one be on the heels of so then direct messaging would be, would it be a? I feel like there's a video version that's that could easily be made of this, of this article as well. But I mean, okay, my first message could then be, hey, look three options. A I've written a manifesto. You can, you can learn about me. B, you can schedule a 15 minute call. You can read my manifesto. You can watch my manifesto. Or you can, you can watch a x minute video, and I don't even know

Speaker 1  39:23
I'm over complicating it. Just I know I'm not solving the man I'm not solving. I'm working on a less, lesser, important, but just outer problem about the link on your website inviting people to a 15 minute sanctuary. And I think that needs to be a just connect with Matthias. Uh, where I want I just, I don't want people to think like, Oh, I'm getting a. Sanctuary call out of that.

Matthias Miller  40:04
Yeah, it's just a quick

Speaker 1  40:09
the 15 minute clarity shot or sanctuary right should only be extended privately as you desire

Matthias Miller  40:21
or through people who or to people who read through the manifesto. Yeah,

Speaker 1  40:27
that's fine. I'm okay with that, but I'm just, I'm only talking about the website link. Yes,

Matthias Miller  40:34
right. So okay, and on LinkedIn, I like this part. LinkedIn could my LinkedIn Link could be the 100 proof man manifesto, yeah, which links directly to the manifesto,

Speaker 1  40:49
and then, and then it goes to the clarity shot, which is fine, because it's outreach to new people, right,

Matthias Miller  40:55
right?

Speaker 1  41:00
What I don't want is for your website to be giving, just giving away a free thing.

Unknown Speaker  41:09
So does is the

Speaker 1  41:13
because it it's to me, it's undermining the value of your offer, which is the sanctuary time.

Matthias Miller  41:23
So is the, sorry, I'm getting distracted looking for these passwords. I need to leave it so, so is the, is the manifesto behind a an opt in on the website.

Speaker 1  41:41
Oh, I was just gonna have it as as a top menu item on the header the manifesto with no opt in. No opt in, that doesn't mean you can't offer on LinkedIn and opt in to get the manifesto sent to your email. That's fine. And it's just a nice it's a PDF version. That's fine,

Matthias Miller  42:10
but if people can read the manifesto, yeah.

Matthias Miller  42:21
Then I guess here's where, okay, here's what you're saying, having it publicly available devalues as a free giveaway. But you're also saying the manifesto will be publicly available, and as part of that, you can book your 15 minute session.

Speaker 1  42:41
Yeah. So one one thought is, if you the PDF version that you distribute through LinkedIn, can have a a call to action of clarity shot. That's fine,

Matthias Miller  42:57
got it? But the Okay, what's your rationale? But

Unknown Speaker  43:03
the the manifesto on the website shouldn't have

Matthias Miller  43:10
shouldn't have that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  43:13
it should be. It should just invite them directly to your offer page, which is paid sanctuary time.

Matthias Miller  43:24
Okay, I get where you're going. I'm good with that. I would also like to have a landing page, okay, so, so there's the public manifesto, then there's the gifted manifesto, like, there's okay, there's three versions publicly with a link to paid offers.

Speaker 1  43:47
Okay, let's wait. Just go. Just go to 100 perfume manifesto. Okay, and then,

Matthias Miller  43:56
okay, I have another problem with no. It's not this. I think it's oops,

Unknown Speaker  44:04
three versions,

Matthias Miller  44:07
public on website, to 15 minute consult. Right then it's private, opt in to to PDF with CTA for 15 minute sanctuary. I don't think my offer page is not public yet. No, and then there's a but

Speaker 1  44:35
I think, I think you can, you can, you could easily have a coaching menu item and just that be your offer page

Unknown Speaker  44:46
without pricing,

Unknown Speaker  44:52
with corporate pricing, with corporate

Speaker 1  44:53
pricing, yeah. I.

Matthias Miller  45:12
Wait, okay, I I think you're right. Here's where I think I need. I Yeah, okay. And one of the things that Deborah mentioned is that it depends whether the executive is paying for it out of pocket, and they might be have making half a million a year, but they're still cheap. So, and I don't know exactly what cheap is, but it might be that I still, still I sell, if the company's paying for it, it's 25k for a day. If the executives is paying for it, it's 5k for a day. And that's

Unknown Speaker  45:46
where, that's what you determine on a consultation call, right? Who's paying for it?

Matthias Miller  45:53
I agree, but then,

Unknown Speaker  45:58
yeah, I Okay,

Matthias Miller  46:18
so I'm i

Matthias Miller  46:24
Okay, big plan. I think I'm aligned.

Matthias Miller  46:33
Wait, no pricing for corporate. What does that

Speaker 1  46:35
mean? Well, that was on a website, if you just had it, I'm I'm not sure yet. For now, oh,

Matthias Miller  46:44
we could have a pay we could take the offer page, remove pricing and and just schedule your 15 minute consult to figure out whether we need it or not. I mean, simple,

Speaker 1  46:56
it's not, it's it's the the link, the one right now is for Perry or any private crew that you want. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  47:05
okay, I like it. I'm on board with that. So I

Unknown Speaker  47:33
you might even make it a 30 minute consult.

Matthias Miller  47:38
It could be, I would this. I would ping Ashley as soon as I've got or, I mean, potentially dove, but I'm thinking Ashley and just be like, What is your because she could very quickly

Speaker 1  47:54
flesh that out. I like it. If they're on the offer page and want a console, I feel like it. You could even do 30 minutes, sure, sure,

Matthias Miller  48:19
rethinking. Men don't typically discuss this. You're into something big. Adam Grant, rethinking happiness with Trevor. Noah,

Unknown Speaker  48:33
All Right, you

Unknown Speaker  50:15
I think this really works

Matthias Miller  50:17
like it does.

Unknown Speaker  50:19
It's very simple. It's, it's, and it gives you control around who sees what you

Unknown Speaker  50:52
all right, so

Unknown Speaker  50:56
how much of this?

Matthias Miller  51:00
What part is me and what part is you. So you would need a 50 minute consult and a 30 minute consult, or would it only be a 30 minute consult? No, okay. Website, there is no 50 minute consult. This goes to, I don't know what this is, offer page. I

Matthias Miller  51:24
right,

Unknown Speaker  51:29
you're, you're, you're okay, let me this needs to

Unknown Speaker  51:39
be rewarded, manifesting. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  51:47
yeah, this is so drop dead simple. Man,

Unknown Speaker  51:50
isn't that great?

Matthias Miller  51:53
I don't know how you package what you do, put you put it in the bottle. I don't even quite know exactly what I mean. I do know, but quite know how exactly we started working together, or why you're working with somebody who's in such a precarious startup mode.

Unknown Speaker  52:07
Well, I, I honestly don't know. I, I honestly don't know why you're considering Deborah, you

Unknown Speaker  52:17
don't think it's necessary.

Speaker 1  52:18
I just, I look, I think it'd be, I think, I think she's a specialist in LinkedIn, good for her, but like she is, she's about branding with content marketing, but it's like a social media branding, and you are not that person. You are, you're you're not pushing Instagram reels, okay, like her, her form is not you. Dove is a words person, I'm right. Forget, you're just not a social like, and also she, she's, she's aiming at women. You, you're, you're a more healed man, and can connect with that. But like, I think, I think, I think the 100 proof you side, I think that actually is bigger. How should I put it? It's i

Speaker 1  53:48
I almost think corporate is, is is a constraint. Right now, thinking corporate is a constraint, I think it's it's good, if it's successful people, whether they're high up in their career or whether they're entrepreneurs, but like, that's, that's, and I know this is me speaking. This is not you. It's just that's why I feel like, Man is a big, a better denominator, because you're working on the inner self, the inner man. I like that, working on your inner man, you know, so you can have an inner knowing, right? I'm the reason why you found are tempted by someone like Deborah is because you decided corporate, and then you look for who's a corporate specialist, but I don't, but that that I'm not that might be fine tactically, but the the result was. Someone who's a social media brand specialist, who who presents themselves as a LinkedIn expert, and she could get results, that's great, but the way she's marketing it includes these other branded elements. That's just not you.

Matthias Miller  55:21
Okay, so

Speaker 1  55:24
by the way, we've already done everything that she's offering. Like, literally, with her, I looked at her offer page, we're doing what she's offering, and we came up with the tribal language, and you've got the Beowulf and, like, I don't think she could have come up with that.

Matthias Miller  55:44
No, I don't disagree. Well, and there's still the two pounds of proof. By the way, I really, really, really, would love to take this thing, FedEx it to the guy who hasn't booked a meeting, printed out the staple it together, FedEx it to the guy who hasn't booked a meeting and make him sign for it. Here's the manifesto. Are you in great, right? Like, say, hey, hey, this

Speaker 1  56:10
is the, this is, it's a very raw form. But like, say, Hey, this is, this is behind the scenes of what, of what came to me yesterday, right?

Matthias Miller  56:26
Well, okay, but how much work? How much work for you to take this put like the big bold 100 proof you manifesto in the front on the first page, black and white. I mean, like, my

Speaker 1  56:43
this is not, I can, if you're asking who would implement it, I can do, I can do all of the above. That's not, that's not a problem.

Matthias Miller  56:51
I mean, I've done other side note. I mean, like, it doesn't actually have to go, but like, could we, by end of day tomorrow, actually have something like this that we could take and run with, and

Speaker 1  57:07
I can have, I'm, I mean, it's a page with words. I can, I can have that up

Matthias Miller  57:13
and have the and have a PDF. The real thing I'm after is get the get the opt in. Page Up and start being able to shoot this out to friends and have them opt into my I guess it's opt into my list. But in order to do that, is this, the 100 proof man? Is this? What this thing is becoming? That's a question that needs to be answered.

Speaker 1  57:42
I think, I think that is the question to be answered. I think it doesn't need to be answered today. Sure, I think it's, it's okay if it's under Matthias, but I'm, I'm, I think if you, I uh, here's the difference. Like Megan Macedo could have done, uh, tell your story.com, for example, right?

Matthias Miller  58:15
Okay, or,

Speaker 1  58:18
but, but she's, she's the real magic,

Matthias Miller  58:23
okay, right?

Speaker 1  58:26
And so the question is, like Perry could have done 8020

Unknown Speaker  58:36
8020 marketing, right now, I think that, I think that Matthias Miller is fine, right in this and I think that can get you pretty far, but Yes, soon as you decide to go groups,

Speaker 1  58:59
you can still stick with Matthias Miller, like I don't. I don't see a conflict. I mean, but, but I think, I think here's what I'm feeling.

Speaker 1  59:20
I think you could forever go with Matthias Miller, like, I honestly think you could and then have a tribe under you. Like, that's not, that's not a problem. But to me, the way I see 100 proof coming, like developing it, it will. I just, when I think 100 proof, man, I just don't, I just don't think of corporate, right? I. Of, I think of, I think it's bigger than corporate, right.

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
So corporate may be unlocking a pricing scheme and a target demographic that I had not considered before. I'm open to that right. Like, kind of a whack yourself upside the head, step up two notches.

Speaker 1  1:00:20
Like, like, I don't think you would distinguish between a,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:27
you know, that's fair corporate

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
and a high level entrepreneur.

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
No, I would not. That

Speaker 1  1:00:36
doesn't mean your messaging is doesn't distinguish

Matthias Miller  1:00:41
there, there may be, there may be Legion campaigns that are different for the two of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:51
Okay, here, here's, uh, let me um,

Matthias Miller  1:00:55
but, but, by the way, my star principle, one of the big questions that I feel like I have to answer, because I haven't, because this is the problem in the past. Is, how do you scale this? And the way that you scale this is one of Richard Kosh star principle principles, which is, go and make the cycles. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:01:12
And, and, I think, I think the more the if the more. Here's what I feel like, if,

Speaker 1  1:01:32
to me, the community, isn't you, the community is 100 proof, right? Matthias, so if you're wanting to scale this, I I just think 100 proof should be the foundation, not Matthias,

Matthias Miller  1:01:51
right? No, I think makes sense. And, oh, by the way, case in point, you could, if I had a way to say Mark sign on the dotted line, and you can figure out a way to do this thing, whatever it is for other people, whatever that looks like, like 100 proof version of breakthrough certified consultants.

Speaker 1  1:02:18
Anyway, like so. So I like a here's, here's my favorite therapist. Okay, so Bob HAMP, yep, okay, he has Bob hamp.com, oh, actually, actually, it used to be his own page, but, but now it's just all think differently, right? Think Different Academy, okay, um, he even has a he has even think differently Counseling Center, which is like a a brick and mortar counseling business, yep, but, but like,

Speaker 1  1:03:11
like this, this, his face is on, everything, right, but, but what people are after is to think differently side

Matthias Miller  1:03:28
well, it's again, I don't think it's just as similar. I think I've said this before, but I don't think it's dissimilar from Ziegler, Maxwell and even Covey, some folks like that. And obviously there has to be a fairly this has to be pretty focused. They were in an era with the wild west of these things, and could claim a lot of territory. So it needs to be focused to be able to reach that. But yeah, I think that's fair. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
my phone froze.

Speaker 1  1:04:14
Now I So, okay, I don't think that needs to be a today decision, right? I think, I think you can build up some momentum with Matthias Miller, and then when you want to switch over, it's a redirect, right? Yeah, or maybe, maybe Matthias Miller, is you coaching for a particular segment?

Matthias Miller  1:04:40
But, I mean, it might be, I mean, that can be determined. I think we're generally on the same page. So

Unknown Speaker  1:04:49
here's the that, the the

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
here's the difference, though, if, if this was just you. You, it would be Matthias Miller, if it was you and

Speaker 1  1:05:09
Robert, is it right? To me, there are other partners. I think it becomes a bigger than you thing, right? And then and then that that works in your favor, because it's they're not stuck on getting the magic from you. Yes, okay, but if it's your branded page, I think more people would want you. Yes, right now, it's just you, so that makes sense. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:05:43
well, I mean, it's the, you know, to borrow vivianism. It's the infant, toddler, adolescent, and at some point, at some point, this thing's going to grow up to a stage where it's got a life of its own if it wants to run off and, you know, get married and or whatever that wants to do, like, I think that's anyway. So, so,

Matthias Miller  1:06:20
all right, can you lay out an action plan for

Matthias Miller  1:06:28
what? Can we get this to a point? Okay, well, there's, there's a few things would there Be? Do you think there's any gaps with what I

Matthias Miller  1:07:03
this is for me to list out, what do I want, and what in my realistic or false expectations, am I expecting from Deborah? And that's going to tell me what it is that I'm actually after, and maybe it's just a confidence thing, maybe it's just a confirmation thing. Or maybe there actually is some element that I feel like she's got, I don't personally, here's here's where I feel it with you, with Dove, is I feel like I don't personally want to take time sifting through doves philosophy to find the things that fit, Although, but I feel like you, hopefully, this is a delegation application, but I feel like there could be benefit from having you as an editor borrowing his.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
Well, I'm already doing that with him. Okay? The Yeah, so,

Matthias Miller  1:08:23
so I would be inclined, if you've got an inroad, and if there needs to be more of one, I'm open to talking about that, but if you've got an inroad to grab his ideas or his insights or his feedback, or his fill in the blank, or if I should have a call with him, I'm open to that, open to explain that as well. But I would much rather have you be the buffer between everything that I'm doing and his philosophy and figure out which parts and pieces to pull in, rather than me doing that

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
right

Matthias Miller  1:08:52
but, but if that's if I'm unnecessarily abdicating, I think I need to do then I

Speaker 1  1:08:58
think we are. We're already working that I just don't know. I don't know. The reason why I introduced dove is he has profitable relationships and a community strategy, and I don't know, I don't know what that piece is. But as far as messaging and other things and stuff on LinkedIn, I can, I'm already doing that with you,

Matthias Miller  1:09:28
right? So it's a breakdown of his community strategy, which would be like his telegram stuff and and the whole Do you have a mechanism for finding that out or No,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
a mechanism.

Matthias Miller  1:09:43
Do you have a way to I'm like, I have a document I was part of of a his early jvmm, like, let's go build this thing for yourself group. And I think I got a lot of materials from there as well. Um. No his URL in,

Speaker 1  1:10:08
like his email copy for promoting it. Or were you in the group? In

Matthias Miller  1:10:12
the group you were in? There's there's a URL in at Google groups.com

Unknown Speaker  1:10:17
Let me share my screen. I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
let me think this is the right one. I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
Do you see URL? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:10:32
under the radar. Yeah, under the radar. Leaders Network, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:10:37
so. And I think as part of this, there were docs or something that were shared with me. Thank you for your purchase. You've been added to

Unknown Speaker  1:10:52
so what did you purchase?

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
A monthly subscription to the under the radars Leaders Network. So we got emails member directly by URL and the alchemy network training document, which I no longer have access to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
well, did you sign up with that email? Looks like it? I would request access. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:30
let's do this.

Matthias Miller  1:11:36
Let me make sure on the shutdown. There's also a shutdown. I um, winding down the end of March.

Speaker 1  1:11:50
Well, that become, I think that became, JV, WM,

Matthias Miller  1:11:55
well, which he'd been done, done for a while. But I don't think he explicitly mentioned ongoing asset, ongoing access, right? So it could be that access, well, but then there's this dude who made a copy of it at some point.

Speaker 1  1:12:22
Well, share that with me and maybe that's all you need.

Matthias Miller  1:12:27
Um, let me, let's actually make a copy in that drive,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
make a copy and

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
put it in the share. Yeah, and then remove copy of copy.

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
Okay, that's Sure. Let's do

Speaker 1  1:12:53
well, maybe, maybe that's, that's already maybe this is the blueprint. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:05
yeah, it probably is,

Matthias Miller  1:13:07
and there's lots of missing pieces. Mean, there's also some answers in Okay, let's go back to

Speaker 1  1:13:17
what, what was the monthly maybe what you could do is send over the monthly email subscription, like, because he had, maybe there was a monthly thing that he was breaking this down,

Matthias Miller  1:13:33
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:34
because you said it's as you signed up for a monthly

Matthias Miller  1:13:38
well, he had this.

Speaker 1  1:13:42
I uh, bi monthly, oh, never mind. Is group call. Oh, and that's just a URL, okay, just you can stop here, because the document that that probably has enough, and then everything else is just member questions.

Matthias Miller  1:14:17
Okay, I mean, and I think those are just group, group emails. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:14:24
fine. Don't Don't worry about that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:14:26
so you got what you need off of, off of here, and I think this was reasonably close to, let's actually check revision history, just out of curiosity, see version history. March 320, 23

Speaker 2  1:14:40
what? Let's see where he shut it down. That

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
was the purchase. Do?

Matthias Miller  1:15:00
March, end of March. March, so this is, this is pretty much the last, I mean, unless he this is the last I would have ever had access to it.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:12
March of 2222

Speaker 3  1:15:16
Yeah, that's fine, yeah, yeah. March of 22 when he sent the announcement, I made a copy of the document.

Speaker 1  1:15:23
Yeah, that's okay. There you go. That's probably all you need.

Matthias Miller  1:15:28
So I guess that's in your court. Uh, you'll take a first glance at it and come back with the proposal.

Speaker 1  1:15:34
What the Yeah, the thing that you can work on is figuring out how you want to introduce this to your your closer circles, right? Going back to the the audience, pool of the pool of prospects, the audience, the partners page. What was the spreadsheet we had,

Matthias Miller  1:16:06
right? The like the Perrys and the peats and the

Speaker 1  1:16:09
so what we have, I'll, I'll, I'll create a manifesto page, okay? And we'll go at the top of the website, and I'll change the 15 minute sanctuary and make it a coaching. Okay, this is what you can put down, write down, create a Calendly For a like a connect with you,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
right, right? Um,

Speaker 1  1:17:07
a book a call to explore, okay, it's a discovery. Call, call, it discovery, call for 30 minutes. Okay?

Speaker 1  1:17:23
15 or 30 minutes. You could say 30 and that's going to be the same invitation after the manifesto on,

Matthias Miller  1:17:38
well, yeah, after the after the Online manifesto.

Speaker 1  1:17:44
Personally, personally, honestly, why wouldn't you make Hmm?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:08
Rarest document, where's the okay?

Speaker 1  1:18:21
You could even further simplify it and make even the private dot opt in a 30 minute consult, free consult,

Matthias Miller  1:18:36
and always lead it to a consult

Speaker 1  1:18:37
I like, I think maybe that's it. Yeah, you could always make it a free cons, free 30 minute consult,

Matthias Miller  1:18:47
and then, if you want to, and then, and then the 15 minute sanctuary is something I only give for free as a special gift to people that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
you can reach out to on LinkedIn, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:19:02
no, I think, I think that's the thing I know, because the reason I did that was because I didn't have words to articulate what it was doing it was doing. So I wanted to give them an experience. I like it. Okay, so 30 minute booking call. What is my plan for reaching out to people in my network? Close connections.

Matthias Miller  1:19:38
I like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:39
So private opt in,

Matthias Miller  1:19:42
oh, and is now,

Speaker 1  1:19:46
am I? Am I right in changing the 15 minute sanctuary for the private opt in to the 30 minute consult, I think that's fair. So any manifesto, manifesto, always i. Um, always has a 30 minute consult.

Matthias Miller  1:20:08
I think so. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:20:09
I think that mentally. I think it, it's a clear lane.

Matthias Miller  1:20:15
My only question is, for a busy executive. Is 30 minutes too big of a lift.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:31
I mean, what you

Unknown Speaker  1:20:52
I just think. I think I

Matthias Miller  1:21:06
well, okay, I have an idea. This is what Deborah did, stealing her ideas. What about 20?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
Yeah, you can do 20 because,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:14
you know, it's more than 15. People are trying to drop more than 15. It's

Speaker 1  1:21:18
like it's a connection. Call 20 minutes. People, people know from 20 minutes that you can always go to 30 right. But what we do with webinars is, if you do 40 minutes, it's really an hour blocked on on calendar and for Q A right, but it's but it gets optional to breathe. It

Matthias Miller  1:21:41
gives permission to also gets permission for people to leave like you're not committing to the full,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:49
right? All right, the 20 minute console, but

Matthias Miller  1:21:53
I should also set up the mailer light, um, right? For the opt ins?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:08
Well, let me, let me look at the pricing 18 a month.

Matthias Miller  1:22:19
I just thought that we might be able to include it on our current plan, but I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  1:22:24
what's your current Are you already with mailer light

Matthias Miller  1:22:26
for decodehouse.com? No, I'm not opposed to I'm sorry. Can we break for like, three minutes? I'll be right back. I

Matthias Miller  1:25:18
All right, let me see if My AirPods are back. Actually.

Matthias Miller  1:25:42
Must have absolutely beat them to death or something I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:25:50
I'm very open to other platforms, if you've got other ones to be considering.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:01
Look, I

Speaker 1  1:26:25
uh, 500 Okay, let me see one second, 500

Speaker 1  1:26:36
okay, I I think, okay. I really do like Convert Kit mailer light is is cheaper, but they both have the same entry price for, you know, $9

Matthias Miller  1:27:02
I don't care about, I mean, unless you're ConvertKit

Speaker 1  1:27:06
is, ConvertKit is better at segmentation, okay? And it's better at deliverability, okay? It has a more basic like text based editor for the design. Okay, that's why it's good for deliverability. And I don't think you're doing fancy designs. Never, don't so I convert kits are good for that. I think they have better they're designed for solo creators mail, or more for business, a very small business,

Matthias Miller  1:27:49
more of like, I'm going to go hire my social media person to generate fancy looking newsletters and emails and send it out to people and look Navy and yeah.

Speaker 1  1:27:56
So the solo creator, the the YouTuber, the like, I don't know, for creating content

Unknown Speaker  1:28:07
convertkits is good, but I will say it's free for the first 300 Hey, okay, actually, it's free for 300 and then unlimited sequences, automations that can get you pretty far. Yeah, and then it's for 1000 it's 25 a month. So that's it. I think it can get more pricey

Speaker 1  1:28:50
the more you scale. Yeah, I don't know if this is important to you. Facebook custom audiences,

Matthias Miller  1:29:02
so that you could target, you can target your email list online,

Speaker 1  1:29:08
if you're doing ads, maybe right for stronger Adcock, but, but maybe you just do the honestly you don't necessarily need that. You could just do Facebook custom audiences on Facebook,

Matthias Miller  1:29:24
separate from those, right? You can always export and, you know, I don't know. I mean, at the point that you have a 10,000 member list as an example, if you can't monetize that to cover $1,000 a year, then there's probably something wrong with your list.

Speaker 1  1:29:41
Like, I think if you get to 300 subscribers,

Speaker 1  1:29:59
like, I'm just, I'm a. The free version, I'm like, I have one automation,

Matthias Miller  1:30:08
where's the ConvertKit branding that's on pages and emails and product pages. I would pay to not have that. All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:21
what I also like about ConvertKit is actually you can build your own. You can build because I'm on the free version, but you can build

Speaker 1  1:30:40
opt ins, and that's, I think that's better than what mailer White has for opt in forms. Does

Matthias Miller  1:30:52
that have a WordPress integration, or is it embedded code? Or i

Matthias Miller  1:31:05
And side note, Audra can use my login, which means that you could, I could give you the second login if you want, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:11
if you need it.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:15
Plugins, yeah, has a ConvertKit plugin.

Matthias Miller  1:31:26
All right, so 20 minute consultation call is set up to Bert kit with the Matthias Miller domain and the outreach.

Speaker 1  1:31:41
The main two things you can do are Think about who you send this to first and how you send it.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:00
Here's a way, here's, here's a here's a way of doing this. This would be, this would

Speaker 1  1:32:16
this could be a great planet Perry community email, which is my, my Beowulf sword story, or something like, and this is, and then, 100 proof you manifesto is your Beowulf, right?

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
I don't know the swamp of solving this particular problem Well, I mean, I can get easy traffic in the forum just by taking the manifesto doc, copying it to publicly allow comments and tag it planet Perry feedback and say, Guys, I drafted a manifesto. Can you guys rip into it, please. I

Unknown Speaker  1:33:00
like that great. And, I

Matthias Miller  1:33:02
mean, that's the way I introduced it

Speaker 1  1:33:04
there. And it could be, it could be separate from it could be a new email,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:08
yes, new email, new thread.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:10
I like that. Don't, don't go back to the Ultra.

Matthias Miller  1:33:12
I agree. I like it. And that instantly gets eyeballs.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:16
Okay, this is a much better entry. Then maybe the next thing is, you refining the the refining this manifesto, like, I don't know, oh, sharpening it up.

Matthias Miller  1:33:45
Well, I mean, but couldn't this be the same as for everybody else? Dear Wellspring pod, I have this draft of the manifesto. Here's the wellspring copy. Can you rip into this? Would you guys be open to ripping into this great and giving your feedback? And same thing with the people who raised their hands on Facebook. Hey, here it is, and I create one version for each group of people. Great, and okay. But then first question is, you started going through and making edits. Did you want to read proofread your whole way through it? And then me go through those edits? Yeah, and then do that tomorrow. I love this. That was easy, so I just figured out my outreach plans.

Speaker 1  1:34:26
Great. I was, I was like, You should go think about this a minute. It just took care of itself. Awesome. Yeah, so I

Unknown Speaker  1:34:42
will, let's see. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:34:54
I'm also not sure where to see the Beowulf thing tying in yet. I. I

Speaker 1  1:35:00
don't think you need to focus on Beowulf now, until we get until we get the sword stuff info, I think we can hold off on thinking about Beowulf. Yep. Okay, I'm curious. Does that shift the main page for Matthias Miller, sure it

Matthias Miller  1:35:30
does, because I'm not selling that session. I've wondered about that main page.

Speaker 1  1:35:37
So now, now this 15 minute page becomes a private thing for anyone you want to do a clarity shot with,

Matthias Miller  1:35:48
yes, but then what's the homepage?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:50
Then maybe the homepage is the manifesto,

Matthias Miller  1:35:55
or what is the is it too lame just to have the main page literally be a simple, clean like, which path do you want to take? Manifesto, the I

Unknown Speaker  1:36:35
uh, not following

Matthias Miller  1:36:37
like, what if the homepage, rather than putting the manifesto directly on the homepage, I like having a link to the manifesto and having the homepage be I don't know. Maybe it's like, it's like a speaker homepage, like, have the thing with me in a flipchart. That one photo of me in a flip chart and a

Speaker 1  1:37:05
no, I think, I think this is a simple way of doing it. You take out 15 minutes, eight minutes and seven minutes, take out gift today I want you to experience. And then you just, you link to, you link to

Unknown Speaker  1:37:36
this page without the pricing and

Speaker 1  1:37:48
um, you link to this page without the pricing.

Matthias Miller  1:37:57
Well, it could be as simple as as read the manifesto and work with me, even though they're repetitive from the menu.

Speaker 1  1:38:04
Well, you're not posting the manifesto yet because you're asking people to edit it. Right? I

Speaker 1  1:38:23
for now, I think this needs to be offerings or something, no this. This needs to be okay. This needs to be like your 30 minute consult, connect. This could be your offering page. When we get to the offering page,

Speaker 1  1:39:02
there's not none of this. It's just schedule your console, Yep, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:39:16
Okay, I'll get working on that. Just give me, give me. Give me 20 minutes.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:23
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:32
give me 10 minutes. Okay, all

Unknown Speaker  1:39:36
right, I'll be back. All right, sounds good. I
