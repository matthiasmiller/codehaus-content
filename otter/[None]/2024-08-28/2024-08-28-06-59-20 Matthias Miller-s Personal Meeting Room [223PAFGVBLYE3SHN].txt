Unknown Speaker  02:33
Good morning. Hey, good morning, Kevin,

Unknown Speaker  02:36
how are you?

Unknown Speaker  02:41
This bug I've been fighting is not quite willing to let go. So I little while back, I did some blood tests and found the I don't even know what you call it. What are the

Speaker 1  03:00
what are the foods that my body responds well, to, okay, creating, like, antibodies or I don't even know. I don't even know the right language. So yesterday, I went to natural grocer and got myself some cameo Camu, the superfood stuff, and some echinacea and giving my body every, every competitive advantage I can give it,

Unknown Speaker  03:32
give it a leg up,

Speaker 1  03:34
huh? Give it a leg up. So anyway, that's Wow. I just thought it's very I don't know it's interesting. The timing of it all is very interesting, not to make more of it than I need to. But anyway,

Unknown Speaker  03:58
yeah, how are

Unknown Speaker  03:59
you I'm good, I'm good.

Unknown Speaker  04:08
We are curious creatures.

Unknown Speaker  04:11
Curious Creatures.

Speaker 2  04:15
Somebody asked me yesterday, asked me yesterday if I ever get bored doing what I do.

Unknown Speaker  04:24
I was like, how could I

Unknown Speaker  04:27
human beings are fascinating?

Unknown Speaker  04:34
Yeah, meanwhile, they're the people who are like, wish that they could eliminate human beings. And, you know, right now, have to deal with them, right?

Unknown Speaker  04:47
I mean, there's days I get that. There's days I understand, but it's never been a serious consideration for me. It's.

Speaker 3  05:01
That's funny, yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:10
we dove in this morning. I

Speaker 1  05:27
So fun fact, with that little with the with the messages that I have and no personalization, which everybody says you need personalization. Um, we're at about 20% of the people I reach out to are accepting my invite. And don't really have enough data on the

Unknown Speaker  05:52
on the messages themselves to see how that's going to go. But that's interesting, I guess Audra sent over a bunch of information to me on events and event spaces. I don't know if you want to take a look at

Unknown Speaker  06:19
that. Yeah, take a look at it,

Unknown Speaker  06:22
what I Would love to let's Do this.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
We have

Unknown Speaker  07:28
let me throw this into a document. We can

Speaker 1  07:38
two things I would love. I mean, I think we can figure out how much of the stuff we want to address i

Speaker 1  08:18
It's the budget, attendees, registration, deadline. So data is October, 18 day, final start in time, type of event, space of application, amenities, good catered in or full break. Go eat if you want catering options, what do you want? Will there be parking considerations? Transportation needs? Block, hotel rooms for travelers, recommend certain hotels. Projector, whiteboard, flip charts, physical handouts. What to do? A paper feedback form, an online form to gather feedback at the end of the event. Do? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:11
all things worth considering,

Unknown Speaker  09:14
all things worth considering,

Unknown Speaker  09:18
are important to consider. Worth considering, seems somewhat dismissive, I guess,

Unknown Speaker  09:29
important to consider.

Speaker 1  09:37
You see, there's one event space she wasn't sure about in particular that I actually thought could work, and I know I had seen pictures of it online, and

Unknown Speaker  09:55
I for logging, maybe using my member login. I.

Unknown Speaker  10:53
This might Be i

Speaker 1  11:05
Well, there's all kinds of directions this could go. This. This has the unfortunate situation of being in the basement. I think when we were there, there was a furnace that would sometimes kick on the upside, obviously, is going to be low cost. It seems about 12 it would have a very relaxed feel to it, and it's also downtown and centrally located. Okay, so that's I'm sure she'll come up with a bunch of other options as well, but we've got that all the way up to

Unknown Speaker  11:54
this is overkill, but I

Unknown Speaker  12:06
you know,

Unknown Speaker  12:12
I like the I like the relaxed vibe. It'll put people in more of a conversational space,

Unknown Speaker  12:35
and the limit is 12. I don't know if there's another couch then they're not

Unknown Speaker  12:46
or how they're counting that,

Speaker 1  12:51
although you can very, yeah, I mean you could, you could easily throw in folding chairs or other chairs, and keep the keep the vibe. I

Unknown Speaker  13:03
Right, right.

Speaker 2  13:15
So let's go to how many attendees i My gut feeling is less than 15, like 10 to 15 would be ideal.

Unknown Speaker  13:37
I Is there minimum attendee count?

Speaker 2  13:53
I would say 10, the what we like, I think really searching for that 10 to 15 number. So minimum be 10, maximum be 15, sure.

Unknown Speaker  14:07
And I think this is final, yeah. Do you have any

Speaker 2  14:13
Yeah? October 18 works for me. It's on my calendar, so it's

Unknown Speaker  14:18
on mine as well. Yeah, make sure she's coming.

Speaker 1  14:40
All right, start time could be, I guess it's a matter of, how could be eight or nine?

Speaker 2  14:50
Yeah, that's what first popped into mind. Mind eight or nine to i.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Six, somewhere around there.

Speaker 1  15:02
What if we would do unofficial downtown breakfast? Seven, 730 meet at Center for me at space that's assuming, let's just do an official breakfast, 730 meet at space, 9am okay?

Unknown Speaker  15:33
Or nine to six,

Unknown Speaker  15:34
yeah,

Speaker 1  15:36
with a lunch, you do a late lunch, then from like one to one to two, yeah, what

Unknown Speaker  15:50
do you think of that having a separate casual meeting before the meeting? I mean, just

Speaker 2  16:00
Yeah, yeah, just kind of a meet and greet, get, get to know each other a little Bit like, I think that's that would be great. I

Speaker 1  16:26
she was, she was not able to pull this up, throw this in there, so she's got it okay. What did they Call this one?

Unknown Speaker  16:39
Essential? I

Unknown Speaker  17:35
I'm trying to think there's other there's another one that was just in

Speaker 1  17:49
also has a very nice feel to it. You could actually spend pretty much the whole day there.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  18:07
I don't see

Unknown Speaker  18:11
this is the meeting room. No, this right here is the meeting room.

Unknown Speaker  18:18
Oh, I like that.

Speaker 1  18:20
You got whiteboards, nice space. It's a restaurant. I mean, we could, we could meet there for breakfast,

Unknown Speaker  18:33
and

Speaker 1  18:36
it's northern Colorado Springs, but it's not hard to Uber out there. You know, whatever you're staying

Unknown Speaker  18:54
this is

Speaker 1  18:58
what their availability is, and that's actually not a bad price either, right?

Unknown Speaker  19:09
I like that space a lot.

Speaker 1  19:10
Okay, let me do

Unknown Speaker  19:30
I putting my own food. Yes, you can Fair enough. Yeah, it was really quiet.

Speaker 1  19:48
There's a curtain if we need TV,

Unknown Speaker  19:57
which percent down on booking, which is fair. It's really as sad as late as eight.

Unknown Speaker  20:13
Cool, well, I can, I can chase that good.

Unknown Speaker  20:22
So then

Unknown Speaker  20:29
October. I

Speaker 1  20:31
mean, I wonder if we would just, it would be nice to get out of the room, but I don't even know what other restaurants are right nearby. I don't know that we would really need to go anywhere they get good enough food, but near It's in a little bit of a strip mall. Um,

Unknown Speaker  21:08
you get Chinese food right there? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:13
I wish Chinese is next door. There are some, uh, uh,

Speaker 2  21:23
oh yeah. You got plenty of places, well, oh yeah, in that area, yeah, I kind of like the idea of taking, like a hour and a half, two hour break, like around lunchtime, not only the E but just to process and walk through things.

Unknown Speaker  21:43
So would you want to do so? Nine to 112? 30 would be three and a half hours? Would you do it anyway? I guess we can work out the schedule two, but morning breaks might be, you know, 15 minute morning break. Yeah,

Speaker 2  22:11
yeah. I feel like that, like nine to 1233, and a half hours. That's, that's enough time. You're kind of pushing people to their limit at that point, and then give them a, you know, an hour and a half break. Come back. You know, two to six with, you know, few 15 minute breaks within that. Yeah, I like that.

Speaker 1  22:38
Okay, so we would need, do you want food? Cater in? No, yeah. Do

Speaker 1  23:04
nearby, and plenty of food options at

Unknown Speaker  23:08
real coffee.

Unknown Speaker  23:14
Actually.

Speaker 1  23:21
Can we say this sounds like you're bought into the venue, enough that if we said it really had to be a week later that we might

Unknown Speaker  23:38
coffee is included.

Speaker 1  23:46
A breakfast and lunch on the attendees, yeah, it would be nice to have snacks. And I don't know what all this should be, you know,

Unknown Speaker  24:10
yeah, things that, just like in the midst

Speaker 2  24:18
of workshop, people can just walk over and grab something. Parking

Speaker 1  24:30
considerations transfer, uh, parking should be okay. People can Uber from where they're staying. Yep, I don't know if there's any loyal coffee, rich wine.

Speaker 3  24:59
There's a. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
they could stay at the water park.

Unknown Speaker  25:09
They'll bring their kids. It'll be fun.

Unknown Speaker  25:17
I mean, honestly, yeah, there are all kinds of hotels right here. Yeah, no shortage of hotels in the area. And Uber is no block needed. Plenty of hotels right in that area. Um, um,

Unknown Speaker  25:44
we can Uber anywhere.

Speaker 1  25:54
Could be nice, included there, let's just say whiteboard and TV is only included physical handouts. Tell you what I think is going to happen. Oh, that sounds cool. It would be cool to have you know, I don't know how much this cuts into. Just depends on what you get. But getting just simple, event specific, yeah, I don't know, Moleskines or something like notebooks, or, you know, something along right?

Speaker 1  26:49
I got a molesky Eons ago, for for Business Mastermind I'd done had a roofer grab it, and was beside himself giddy because it just hung around

Speaker 2  27:09
anyway, right? So that's definitely yeah. I think that's a cool thing to have five

Unknown Speaker  27:20
by eight and a half is a nice size, right? And a quarter.

Unknown Speaker  27:33
I also love the what are these? If it matters, whether it's a point five or point

Unknown Speaker  27:43
right? That's not what I'm after. These are good too, but there's another one too. Where were they?

Unknown Speaker  27:54
That's

Unknown Speaker  28:11
these guys. Oh yeah, these are awesome. Pens, nice. Yeah, like

Unknown Speaker  28:37
official feedback, yes, please,

Unknown Speaker  28:39
please, please. I think an online form would be easier. Yeah,

Speaker 2  29:05
I mean, I'm, I'm more likely to do it if it's online. I can just click on it and go through it and then send it in. Go do it

Speaker 1  29:11
and send it in. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  29:16
It takes paper and at the mail or scan email, well, probably, probably

Speaker 1  29:24
pass out at the event or something, and spend the last 15 minutes or whatever.

Speaker 2  29:28
Yeah, I'd rather give them time to process,

Speaker 1  29:33
process it. Yeah. So registration cost we were thinking of, we had said something like one to 200

Unknown Speaker  29:49
right? Yeah, because this was a pilot, you know? I.

Speaker 2  30:00
But you've probably been in in this space more than than I have what, what is, what strikes you as an appropriate cost given first time, it's a pilot and that kind of thing. Um,

Unknown Speaker  30:30
well, these are very much, obviously charges These days for these. I

Unknown Speaker  30:46
I'm talking Anthony.

Unknown Speaker  31:02
So he does a one day at 1500 but it includes a one year $1,000 membership in his community.

Speaker 1  31:21
So the event itself. I mean, he does that primarily because the community is where the stickiness is and where he can anybody with the with a more complicated, unique value proposition, then hot pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less. You need places where people can absorb who you are and what you stand for. Melvin does his one day events, a $500 donation to charity, which I'm not advocating that we need to do that, but that's what he does. Okay? Seems, seems like the price point of thinking that you're paying $500 for the event, for an established for somebody who's established, makes sense. One way to frame this would be, I

Unknown Speaker  32:59
right here in laundry room.

Unknown Speaker  33:07
Well, okay, let's do some basic math. You're going so let's say that we do. I

Unknown Speaker  33:30
uh, so if you're traveling, you're going to have,

Speaker 1  33:38
you're coming in from LA, you're going to have 400 nights, probably not quite $400 of tickets, and, you know, $400 of hotels, right? But it's about $800 by the time you account for everything. Meeting space is going to be $400 snacks is going to be another 100 you gifts for guests is going to be, is going to be, I don't, $20 each.

Unknown Speaker  34:12
IE,

Speaker 1  34:15
we're going to do so this is going to be close to

Speaker 3  34:19
300 I'm so

Speaker 1  34:27
that puts us at 12, 1314, 1516, 1600 costs. Okay, so if we do 10 people, if we do, 10 at $100 equals 1k 15 at $100 equals 1500 10 at 200 equals 2k so.

Speaker 1  35:01
10, at 15, at 200 equals 3k

Speaker 1  35:12
so 100 is too low. Yeah, we can't even hit break even on a full full house, right? Break even. Is fine, but Right, I wonder.

Speaker 1  35:38
I would, I would aim, instinctively for break even at 10, which would be,

Unknown Speaker  35:56
is there really that much difference between 199 and 150 gets too close. I think

Speaker 1  36:13
we're in the right ballpark. I think it's, it's, it should be closer to 150 to 200

Unknown Speaker  36:19
I agree.

Speaker 1  36:22
Um, I I just can't see.

Unknown Speaker  36:36
I just can't I

Speaker 2  37:00
I may have said this before, but for some reason now, I don't know why, but for some reason the number 300 just keeps screaming at me. And I think the last time we talked about I thought the same thing,

Speaker 1  37:20
well, let's do I'm good with that. I don't think it's okay. So at a $500 price point, you know? I mean, I think it's very easy to say. I mean, these can be priced any number of ways, But I think there's the answer you can just

Speaker 2  37:58
do. I just really think at that number, people are going to walk away from this, just like feeling like they if at the 200 number, they're gonna walk away feeling like they got a whole lot for nothing, right? At the 300 number, they're gonna walk away going, Wow, I got a lot out of that. And that was really reasonable, right?

Speaker 1  38:47
Yeah, I that's what's screaming at you. That's what to do. I really suck it.

Unknown Speaker  39:01
Yeah, we got a price six so,

Unknown Speaker  39:08
or I struggle with that. I should say, sometimes, cool. I

Speaker 1  39:25
so then the next question that I have following that is, I

Unknown Speaker  39:50
if I were sending this to

Unknown Speaker  39:59
Bob.

Unknown Speaker  40:02
I wanted to shoot him a quick text about what this is about. How might I do that?

Speaker 2  40:22
Well, we said periodically, you know, throughout the discussions like this is a bullet point. This is something that we want to communicate. That's the That's the message. So, like the glass shattering moment was one of those messages. I

Speaker 3  40:40
How to

Speaker 2  40:53
Yeah, even rebound, I, I like, I like, how to grow stronger, something along those lines, how to use that Pain to develop wisdom and strength, how to leverage. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:29
yep,

Speaker 2  41:40
ahead and detect them. If the answers are easy, you're in the presence of

Speaker 1  41:52
the what do you call the I mean, we call it the valley of the shadow of death, but the the,

Unknown Speaker  42:10
I don't know what you i

Unknown Speaker  42:31
All right, so these would have been at I

Speaker 1  42:43
to looking for early morning meetings that one

Unknown Speaker  42:57
Wednesday,

Unknown Speaker  43:05
a prior Wednesday.

Unknown Speaker  43:21
Maybe it was only these two,

Unknown Speaker  43:32
maybe some in the

Speaker 1  43:34
in the summary as well. But let's see what it comes up with. I

Unknown Speaker  43:48
yeah, there's something big about the natural process, not forcing, not coercing, not manipulating, but allowing the natural process to take,

Unknown Speaker  44:07
to take Hold.

Unknown Speaker  44:11
Let's see. I

Unknown Speaker  44:32
well, I

Speaker 2  45:06
So we've talked about business from the beginning, about being it can be a very coercive process based on the ego. I need to have this. I have to have this. This is what success looks like. Do so that's a good place to start. Like within the meeting is what does success look like to each of you? Right? I

Unknown Speaker  46:08
it's the

Unknown Speaker  46:16
one of the things that I

Speaker 1  46:39
I've observed about how Perry Marshall approaches business is that one of the ways that you could describe what he does is teaching people how to harness and avoid forces of natural forces that are bigger than themselves, than themselves and you know, AI is an example. Nobody's putting the genie back into the bottle with AI, right? But then even, how do you play with big networks, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, well, LinkedIn, maybe less so, but Google and Facebook and make sure you don't get demolished by a force that's bigger than yourself and but then there's also things like market positioning, and, you know, positioning yourself in a market so that you can, you can capture the the flow, rather than try to force, try to make water run uphill.

Unknown Speaker  48:02
Um, um, I don't know how to capture this. I

Speaker 2  48:47
Well, there's a fundamental point here, if your business goals are all about you, that's inherently

Unknown Speaker  48:59
statistic. I Okay,

Speaker 2  49:12
there we go. Sorry, loss of action. If it's all about you, then that's inherently narcissistic, and you're going to get a narcissist reward, which is isolation.

Unknown Speaker  49:38
That's quotable.

Unknown Speaker  49:42
You may have all sorts of money.

Speaker 2  49:52
And if that's your goal, to have all sorts of money, and by all means, you can do that, but don't expect. Community to come along with that. And what I see most people, most business people do, is go in this narcissistic path, but then market outwards that they're altruistic, right?

Speaker 1  50:21
Yeah, and then try having conversations with people who work closely with them, exactly, yeah, the businessman who moved into the area, who is apparently all about kingdom and rebuilding communities, and has a big charitable arm and all that, until you start talking to people who work closely with him and talking about his emotional immaturity, and talk to former partners and how his choices have affected them, etc,

Unknown Speaker  50:59
right?

Speaker 1  51:02
And the outcome is, you observe him in line at the coffee shop, and

Speaker 1  51:18
you know, it's not that, you know, not, not everybody has their host of friends that they've, that they're chatting with, but it's often a very quiet wait in line, a little bit of an aura that goes,

Speaker 2  51:37
Yeah, because the Golden most, most people like that. They they rely on the golden handcuffs. I pay you this amount of money and so you're loyal to me, kind of thing. But the reality is, the golden handcuffs only last for so long.

Speaker 2  52:12
Because what really builds the strength of a Church, a community,

Unknown Speaker  52:18
a

Unknown Speaker  52:21
community is the relationships I

Speaker 2  52:44
and that's, that's the thing I've really seen businesses do, is they really give the lip service to culture and that kind of thing. But there's a priority above that culture, and the priority is making money, right? So you can do that, but it's only going to last for so long. That's why you have like such turnover in certain spaces. I

Speaker 1  53:30
All right, some of these things are, you know, I Think this is a one of those places where I

Unknown Speaker  54:24
What about that?

Unknown Speaker  54:30
Yes,

Speaker 2  54:36
and this, this applies across the board. This isn't just a business strategy. This is a church strategy. This is a home strategy. This is this is foundational. This seeps into every part of our lives. It's true, because that's what we're that's what. At least as I our conversations have proceeded, what I've thought is like, there has to be something bigger than what we're doing. There has to be something more foundational, that there has to be this, the Spirit of God that we're going after union with that spirit, rather than our own egos. And that's really the thing, is the submission, and we would use different language for this, but just in this moment, the submission to what God is calling us to versus what our ego is driving us to do? And to me, like that verse that you look that you were referencing in Hebrews 13, like doing out work outside the walls, like that's what we're called to do. We're called to go outside the walls to communicate these these ideas, these concepts, these ways of living, like It's bigger, so it has to be all encompassing.

Unknown Speaker  56:22
Makes sense. What's interesting too, that

Speaker 1  56:32
surrender is a really interesting i A it's not an interactive surrender, I suppose, is a really interesting way to think about union. And at the point that you have interactive surrender, you're admitting that there's a force at play that's bigger than you are, and you're starting to partner with, to collaborate instead of fight that force. Yes,

Speaker 2  57:11
that's that. That's that natural process. Is the collaboration with that force greater than ourselves. So like in Jeremiah 3131 through 34 Jeremiah is speaking the words of God, and he's talking about the Old Covenant, the new covenant, and the old covenant is, I held you by the hand, and I taught you directly, and you were unfaithful, you know, all that kind of stuff. And then the second part is, my words are on your heart, my, my, my voice is in your ears, that you will be one with me, and I'm that's the I'm talking about, the boldness of choosing that, the oneness with that knowing inside,

Speaker 2  58:19
yeah, the real reason it's lonely at the top is we were not intended to be at the top,

Speaker 2  58:33
but the human ego wants to be at the top. Needs to be at the top. Has to be at the Top. You

Speaker 1  59:21
okay. These are more on, what do I think?

Speaker 1  59:34
What do I think these types of people, I don't know if they went to it. I guess it just depends on, depends so much on who it is we're talking to, if you want to include them or not.

Speaker 2  59:50
Yeah, no, I like that, because there's so many offshoots from that. You write those down, and all sudden my mind goes. Goes, Okay, this is, this is an issue. So a clear issue that everybody in these positions has experience. How do we address that? I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:23
Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:00:31
And that word, the word that comes to mind, like when you list those last three, is exhaustion. It's just exhausting, and we're all exhausted. Yes, how to deal with the exhaustion i

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
Well, This is kind of The ironic thing, but I

Speaker 2  1:02:08
the first thought that pops into my head is, you know, carry that you carry the weight and that cut through the exhaustion when you're carrying the weight of all this. Like as a leader, our job is to develop people, but if we're so self involved, we can't develop people. So you could say, I can't push this off onto somebody else, because they can't do it. Well, why can't they do it?

Speaker 1  1:02:31
Because you haven't developed them. You haven't taught them how. So,

Speaker 2  1:02:42
one of the things themes running through this is radical personal responsibility, looking inwardly. What am I doing? Because the narcissist always externalizes. Well, what am I doing? What do I need to work on? What needs to be developed in me?

Speaker 1  1:02:59
Okay, but no, but there's two frames to this, because radical personal responsibility is sometimes also the

Speaker 1  1:03:21
the response of, I'm going to take control of everything,

Speaker 2  1:03:24
yes, exactly, which is not personal responsibility.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
So what is it?

Speaker 2  1:03:35
It's It's ego driven, and it's fixing everybody else so I can have peace. You.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
Isn't it ironic that

Speaker 1  1:04:16
when you seek it for that you don't get it when you don't seek it for that you do get it right.

Speaker 2  1:04:24
Ironic is a perfect word. Yes, it's the irony of being human, that we can take anything and turn it into a defense mechanism, anything we can do it. I uh, it's quite a remarkable skill. It is. And there has to be a there has to be a reason why God gave us that skill just being misapplied.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:59
Well, it's the. Epitome of human ingenuity.

Speaker 1  1:05:07
I'm sure there's probably more depth to that than

Speaker 2  1:05:13
Yeah, well, it's like a nuclear bomb or a nuclear reactor. It can provide unlimited amounts of energy, and it can also destroy entire cities,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:27
right? Like that's what

Unknown Speaker  1:05:29
it is within us. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:57
I think that's a really good start. I I

Speaker 2  1:06:06
mean, because there's, there's so much content just there, there's A week long seminar content There.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
Let's do this. I'm

Speaker 1  1:07:06
Do you have any and then, you know, going back and forth, setting up the

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
I do any stipulations for who you definitely do not want to see there.

Speaker 2  1:07:40
I really don't, because I think if we put out this, like, this is what we're going to be talking about, it's going to weed out the people that I wouldn't want there, yeah, the people who don't think any of these things are a problem. That's going to weed them out right there. And I think what will happen is, as we we are able to do these and we're able to, you know, it's a very grassroots type of thing. These people here on this time, at this time, have this experience, and then they're going to tell their friends, and their friends are going to reach out. And so eventually, those people who would not be into this, because they're not a problem, they're going to experience those problems in life, and then they'll come Yeah, so it's more of a journey than it is a a marketing strategy. If this is something you've struggled with, you're, you're you're having difficulty with these things, let's come let's talk about it. Let's see if we can find a way out of this together.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
Yeah, yeah. Know

Speaker 2  1:09:04
that to me, it's just an invitation to a conversation.

Speaker 1  1:09:17
I it. So if we open with a what is success? Oh, fun event planning tip from my friend Tim Francis, who's made a bit of a name for himself. He got to host like the International I should look it up. What it actually was I.

Speaker 1  1:10:05
We all know that people like this are Just Ordinary, ordinary Joes, but

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11
the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:21
society i

Speaker 1  1:10:49
Anyway, I forget there was, there was some kind of international, kind of elite group that he got to, gotten host, but he's he's gone deep into hosting events, and what does it take to make it a good one, and hosted Gary Vaynerchuk for a private tour of Austin because of because of this. But one of the things that he said was, when you do an event, what what happens with people in the first few minutes sets the tone for the entire event. So if you want people to talk, you have to open the event with Yes, then

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
