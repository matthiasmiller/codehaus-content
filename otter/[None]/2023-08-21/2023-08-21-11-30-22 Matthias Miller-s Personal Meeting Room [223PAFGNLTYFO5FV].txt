Matthias Miller  01:04
In this bin

Unknown Speaker  01:49
March Mark thanks for being accommodating I simply for myself

Matthias Miller  02:15
alright gotta hate

Speaker 1  02:16
would be more accurate to say I did not properly prioritize might be the cold hard truth

Matthias Miller  02:26
well there's

Matthias Miller  02:36
fair enough

Matthias Miller  02:44
okay so

Speaker 1  02:56
so I don't know what you had planned was I had Dumble well there are three things that I was up of my mind one the FDI allocations that I send over and then I just now sent over marked up on our payroll reports earlier conversation on what we're wanting to see there that said area that we were still trying to get correctly figured out and then

Unknown Speaker  03:38
that was number two and then three was where you are with editing production pool overrides and it gets a fourth one is just to say that when the accounts receivable process I don't have once I have things there I will

Speaker 1  04:03
your way but those are kind of the three I didn't know wherever you wherever you want to start that's kind of you have stuff as well

Matthias Miller  04:19
all right, so you said the

Matthias Miller  04:35
let me just grab a sticky note that might be easiest for me to keep track of what's going on

Matthias Miller  04:47
so number one was the FTA allocations. I should have been writing these down Can you read through these again? Was

Speaker 1  04:58
Yeah, it was it FDI allocations per Druze email and wide like building yeah FDI allocation and then two is owner pool payroll where we have those owners based on a previous conversation I won I was to provide some updated marked up documents of what we're looking at explaining what we're looking for there and then there's was you on where you're going with production pool override and are made a proposal on this Tuesday and I believe you are planning to work on that those changes last later last week. I'm not necessarily suggesting we cover them in that order I think doing the payroll stuff first might make sense because I think the initial allocate the FTA allocations could

Speaker 1  06:16
all that being said, that's just kind of what I have off the top of my head. So wherever I'm open to starting wherever you want to.

Matthias Miller  06:23
It's fair on the payroll stuff, I just got done adding some of those fields this morning have not done anything with the report yet at this point. So in the example for cherry stone for the week of the sixth see? Can you shoot in the snow?

Unknown Speaker  07:05
And it makes it there were entry mistakes or things that did not happen.

Speaker 1  07:14
But basically, what we're trying to accomplish is is say, Mr. Owner, we're gonna pay you by I should. I think it's because of legalities, I'm not exactly sure on exact on all of the details. But basically, like all employers at jury stone structures are in Whitehall run are listed on they're listed as employees underneath vinyl structures, I think it has to do with seeing them on workman's comp. So technically even though we call them an owner, there's their employees of vinyl structures, and then the owner

Speaker 1  08:03
think there's other stipulations like vinyl I mean, try and paint an accurate picture, I think, usually helps if for me, it does. So, vinyl structures is the parent company. And then we have a large sub shop gray stone structures

Unknown Speaker  08:23
owned by me dead while in May a weaver and so in order for it finally turns around leases is rent to lease that shop from them. But then

Speaker 1  08:52
both of these are are on their payroll and the amount they're paid is basically going to pay your employees seven and a half percent and kind of pay you 15% And then the difference that remains after we've paid the employee pool and anything beyond that if there's bonuses or whatever, at 15 your percentage as an owner 15% Minus the seven and a half plus any additional bonuses are on pool. So here's what we're going to pay you and then their ownership percentages are we're going to take that difference and divided by

Unknown Speaker  09:36
the percent split or ownership percentage, and that's what we're going to pay you

Matthias Miller  09:51
so let me see if I've got this scenario in my local system and

Matthias Miller  10:05
If so that would make my life a lot easier

Matthias Miller  10:15
I know the asterisks and those missing numbers it's been fixed since the copy that you've got here

Unknown Speaker  10:27
okay

Speaker 1  10:30
maybe I don't know should you make sense for you to push out a send me a set of updated I'm assuming these have been fixed in the live system as well

Matthias Miller  10:43
yeah my thought is what I'll do I'm going to local test system I'm going to see if I can just I'm going to freeze the production total for the test system with that 63 346 63

Matthias Miller  11:07
So let me go cherrystone structures we go into configure payroll so we don't have that I don't have this information this one try

Matthias Miller  11:37
stretch probably not in here either.

Matthias Miller  12:07
Well let's go ahead and do that first of all that way we can

Matthias Miller  12:16
green out so let me download this and send this out

Matthias Miller  12:45
Okay, so I'm showing slightly lower production numbers, results and slightly lower payout which results in slightly lower employee pool I'm showing 15 cents in non core payroll.

Matthias Miller  13:47
Let me know when you get that mark.

Speaker 1  13:51
And what you're sending me as is what is it you're sending me?

Matthias Miller  13:55
I'm sending you the latest report from insight with the cherrystone report.

Speaker 1  14:03
Oh, okay. And this is out of the live system

Matthias Miller  14:07
does that have the live system Yes.

Matthias Miller  14:30
Got it. So it

Speaker 1  14:37
looks like there was some small shift in total production which is why that the numbers are slightly lower. Correct. And this is exactly why the foresight was put in by you to freeze those numbers.

Speaker 1  15:00
That aside, okay, why are we showing a non pool payroll of negative 15 spends is Is it a rounding issues with? Like, are we paying? Okay? employee pool is 4738 62 is what we're actually paying the individual employees if we sent that sheet but if the sheet word breaks down all the employees and the total that they're paid would that be 4738 Oh no. Would that be 4738 62 minus 15 cents

Unknown Speaker  15:47
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  15:48
yeah, there's a fractional cent in there somewhere 70

Speaker 1  15:57
Okay, could you send me this here's I'm gonna send you the old one that I have but here's what I'm curious to see what number we're showing there

Matthias Miller  16:08
738 60

Speaker 1  16:15
It makes it real confusing because I think the 4730 878 that balance to disburse is then that the rim here's what I think the math would be correct if we said 90 470-724-9477 or minus 4748 62?

Speaker 1  17:11
Know that the sheet I just sent to you that's the old polling station. The far right total there 4750 84 What are you showing

Unknown Speaker  17:33
well there

Unknown Speaker  17:43
is that's the

Unknown Speaker  17:48
that would be on it

Matthias Miller  17:52
instead of a DD four Okay, so let me go into the

Matthias Miller  18:00
cherry stones? Eat three

Matthias Miller  18:14
Wait, no, you said it's on the

Speaker 1  18:18
well, maybe, you know, it's not the employees. So

Matthias Miller  18:22
it's the companies or companies. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Alright, so here we go. All right, here we go. I'm getting here at three. Okay, so.

Matthias Miller  18:42
Well, what did I do wrong? Sure. External structures. Eight three

Matthias Miller  18:56
is this this is the I'm sorry, eight, six. That would explain it. One more time.

Matthias Miller  19:11
4738 47 is what I'm seeing on that 147 3847

Speaker 1  19:16
Which that? So I think what we're seeing is that's what we actually pay. Oh, yeah, that's what we 4738 47 Because if we go back to the report you sent me. He said, employee pool what we put in the pool was 4738 62. But then we actually ended up paying that less 15 cents was because we we do all the calculations we look at what our pool hourly bonus rate is. And then we round that to the nearest two cents. We actually pay there's 15 cents that we don't pay the employees Hey as of rounding which of you if you subtract 4738 62 Greg 15 cents from that they end up with a 738 47 That's so that's what what is their paid and then to see what's remaining is 9477 24 what's remaining for the owner? And is that 4730 840-747-3877 So there we have so we're showing 78 But yeah

Matthias Miller  20:57
the well

Speaker 1  21:04
but okay this other than that that minute one cent rounding difference everything is calculating correctly like we're getting the owner payout bonus down below the additional bonus is not appearing because we never entered it. We never sent I don't think we ever sent that office ended that number into Dwayne's office Why were we done that? I think I think the total owner should be paid accurate right? Because in the breakdown down below you're taking that 4738 78 putting it up at 20

Unknown Speaker  22:07
Now is this this fake? You're producing these reports out of the live system? Yes, right the one the report you send to me okay, how does the

Speaker 1  22:22
Can we just for all over the place I'm excited this this looks like it's working correctly I like to just call on the phone enter those bonuses and then send out your own set of reports to make sure that it's all working correctly but did you want to look at the rounding that one penny thing anymore or we'd all love but we can just letting it go as well

Unknown Speaker  22:59
I am

Matthias Miller  23:05
can see so we've got bounced disperse under payout

Unknown Speaker  23:18
percentage

Matthias Miller  23:34
probably the right thing to do to chase this what I'm scared about is I don't think we should chase it. If it matters to you I can chase it I have it is one of those things that

Matthias Miller  24:06
has the potential for having a cascade effect owner let's

Speaker 1  24:19
leave it for now. I'll find it is why don't we leave it for now. And as we do our testing of it there's like it's going to be a problem then we can address it but otherwise let's leave this leave as is.

Matthias Miller  24:33
Okay, so you anticipate that even if you that we could go live with Penny differences here and there

Speaker 1  24:47
well so yeah, I mean, what we're, what we're seeing here is rather than paying rather than this week's production costing vinyl structures $9,477.24 It cost them 23 cents 940 4004 $77.23 And we're back it's the me but that's test and see if it's there is any the 10 cents week the week then I think we need to address it but it's just or the time and then other times it matches and what I would be interested in seeing is additional bonus you could take the amounts that I hand in on my copy I can give you the amounts as well as to owners and then send a complete set of verification reports for this company and also like to do the same thing for whitetail run and I think of one week worth of

Unknown Speaker  26:17
rectly and then we could use that okay so

Matthias Miller  26:32
was myself okay owner the additional bonus Okay, so let's do time cards cherrystone eight six for Raymond. Let's see Sorry for student manual Weaver discretionary bonuses we're going to add 336 and four or Raymond Detweiler we're going to add you for three then we're going to rerun the owner verification the company verification of these

Speaker 1  27:26
and also do the employee verification and then just sent me yes that's those reports get there and then I'd also like to do the same thing for you wait till Ron

Unknown Speaker  27:48
all right so

Unknown Speaker  27:50
then do those numbers but I can give you

Matthias Miller  27:57
give me a chance to get these sent over to you first before there and then

Unknown Speaker  28:21
so.

Matthias Miller  28:52
Okay, and then let me go over who run

Matthias Miller  29:02
and then what bonuses do you need on white tail run?

Speaker 1  29:08
For Alvin Hershberger Jr. We need a bonus of 1006 We need a a bonus of 14 14,000 14,000 Even I think his owner pool bonus is going to be a negative number or a payout bonus.

Matthias Miller  29:54
You would have negative 17,000 to disperse are negative 17 seresin

Speaker 1  30:06
No here's okay I know this here's what I'm gonna send you this here's what numbers should

Unknown Speaker  30:39
my email come through on my telephone numbers

Matthias Miller  30:52
so wonderful pool bonus non pool payroll I'm seeing $20,000 worth of non pool payroll for him

Unknown Speaker  31:15
total Are you showing

Matthias Miller  31:19
I think it's including the owner bonus in there

Speaker 1  31:27
okay, did we did we add it in the wrong place? Like did you put it at were like discretionary bonus for the the owner we added as some other bonus

Matthias Miller  31:40
as opposed to where

Unknown Speaker  31:47
I just I'm looking at the the extent to okay

Speaker 1  32:02
okay, I think here's, here's here's the problem. So I'm looking at the cherrystone reports now. And looking at this is the owner verification report owner

Speaker 1  32:29
owner payout bonus, Rob, because the additional bonus are like they're still being paid the same net amount

Speaker 1  32:51
you want them to be paid, calculated amount plus that creationary bonus. And you added

Matthias Miller  33:04
so that means we need

Speaker 1  33:14
because I'm seeing your non pool payroll increased up increase by the amount of those two bonuses

Matthias Miller  33:36
so we're back to adding another type of owner bonus. Well,

Speaker 1  33:44
we were AB I had thought from just talking with Seth about this. So we're wanting to pay them in excess of the 15%.

Matthias Miller  33:59
Wonder if it's as simple as excluding discretionary bonuses for owners in the non pool payroll.

Speaker 1  34:17
Is that something change you'd have to make to the software? Yes. And there's no other bonus field that we could use for owners is there because I'd understood from Seth that there was a on a field where we could enter these amounts. It would be in addition to the

Matthias Miller  34:44
look under

Matthias Miller  34:53
so the under payout is based on production amount, right? That's not what we're looking We're looking at the balance to disperse

Matthias Miller  35:14
so we have the total owner payout

Matthias Miller  35:30
so we have the tenant and payouts we have the work order amount we have the employee pool

Matthias Miller  35:42
we have a pic it looks to me like the total winner payout is the gap unless we would put I don't know if this would work and negative 1099 payout but that's not really what that's for.

Speaker 1  36:03
But like you said just simply excluding discretionary owner recessionary bonuses from the pool

Unknown Speaker  36:22
it is the desired result

Matthias Miller  36:33
so you're looking at

Matthias Miller  36:46
timecard employee non for a which would be the

Matthias Miller  36:58
do owners use time cards and do they ever get paid based on time cards No.

Matthias Miller  37:28
Well okay, I'm gonna have to think it's a simple fix I am gonna want to make sure there's no unexpected consequences from what I'm attempting to do but I think if we simply exclude all owner compensation from non pool payroll will be good

Unknown Speaker  37:59
okay, let me just marked this up

Speaker 1  38:09
if we would enter those that would work if we'd enter those discretionary bonuses as negative amounts that wouldn't think that would get us the desired end result with it?

Matthias Miller  38:23
No because then it would be negative in that bottom payout section as well which would

Matthias Miller  38:34
like you want to negative and no I don't Yeah it's the two places we cancel each other out basically

Matthias Miller  39:06
so I think

Matthias Miller  39:18
balance to disperse. Well, let's actually do this. Well, nevermind. I can

Matthias Miller  39:35
got a few few options we can

Matthias Miller  39:54
let me just do something real quick here and then this might give us what we need.

Speaker 1  40:03
And I just send an email marking up your your first verification report that you send

Unknown Speaker  40:14
way but showing what what were we need the end totals to be okay I think that's yeah we're clear on that right

Matthias Miller  40:36
yes I believe so.

Speaker 1  40:40
Because your your second set has those additional bonuses listed correctly. But because it's taking out of the payroll on our pool it lowers the payout bonus amounts by exactly that

Matthias Miller  40:58
so we're gonna have to show another line for owner additional bonuses in the report. Oh, okay. So as you can see where it's that's the only place it's used Okay, let me let me do this let me

Matthias Miller  41:28
right so that's gonna take a little bit more work on our verification tool payroll which shows their pool

Matthias Miller  42:11
Okay, well we do this okay, so we need to

Unknown Speaker  42:43
can we rename?

Matthias Miller  43:00
A non dual payroll to

Unknown Speaker  43:11
Well,

Unknown Speaker  43:12
I don't know, can we all that we're needing to show there is mean we could we could almost say what we would call it but we could instead of showing the

Speaker 1  43:36
thinking we could we lump the 1099 payouts so the 1099 thing I don't that's when I talk with Seth about this. When was that 1099 Yeah, it's that option is going to be shell for now we do have some use for that in the future but it would take some additional development and we're we're just going to shelve that for now. So I guess we could hide that but we almost could combine total work orders and play pool and non pooled payroll into one grand total just whatever the total is on the company verification report where we have that pay stub information all right column is showing what all boys are paid. That makes it

Unknown Speaker  44:45
that could make it cleaner

Unknown Speaker  44:52
but that's just to suggest,

Matthias Miller  44:55
well, but Okay, but how do you work orders

Matthias Miller  45:05
Because the employee also does it does the owner know because that would come out of the Sorry Good thank you

Speaker 1  45:20
like we could have saved yourself a lot of vision had we made distinct names for all these different fields had we been able to make distinctive names for all these fields when we started right now we're we have so many cool and rates that is

Speaker 1  45:48
is myself what we're talking about but what I sent to you what I circled there now the 4750 84 Won't we always have on our payout minus the amount I circle will always equal the balance to disburse

Matthias Miller  46:17
minus fair because the sooner we get paid work orders get paid to cover the way

Speaker 1  46:36
he'll pay his Yeah, if he has a week where he has a bunch of work orders they'll pay his employees less but you'll get paid more to cover that Yeah. Right. Which would Am I missing something I think all of the we're basically looking at total production times the owners payout percentage minus the grand total that his employees were paid which is reflected in the 4750 84 right or am I yeah, I just want to be sure am I missing something?

Matthias Miller  47:17
Well it's the wrong guy to ask so we could condense these three lines to employee payroll

Unknown Speaker  47:32
yeah

Speaker 1  47:44
I think just hiding the 1099 payouts for now is I don't see as using that anytime this year anymore anyway

Matthias Miller  48:05
payroll to employee payroll

Matthias Miller  48:25
and then

Matthias Miller  48:31
and then the only thing that we needed to then include

Matthias Miller  49:18
Okay, let me think it's clear as mud let me

Matthias Miller  49:29
let me chase this here and send you a new verification report or send you new verification reports. Okay.

Speaker 1  49:43
Is this something Do you have any idea on time timeframe on that?

Matthias Miller  49:51
Probably not until

Matthias Miller  50:01
Maybe Maybe by our Wednesday call but it might not be until next Monday given that we've got some other FTI stuff to look at

Speaker 1  50:14
I just sent you one more report on replanning this show this on the breakdown

Speaker 1  50:28
I like that we're showing all employees even owners on the employee verification report where will we show the owner payout bonus on that breakdown I send you the one for email we are

Unknown Speaker  50:52
you know this one should

Matthias Miller  51:00
no it won't appear there

Speaker 1  51:18
we need to get salaried employees entered as well but where are where are salaried employees rates gonna show well I could see

Unknown Speaker  51:38
or that has an owner

Speaker 1  52:25
if we could do something like that I just send you the one for college label

Speaker 1  52:35
is entered as an owner with a guaranteed wage or a weekly salary of 1500 per week hourly rate zero a total of 1500 if we could do that that would be one way we could do it if we could show that okay out there as well or are some more words distant

Matthias Miller  53:15
we check something here

Matthias Miller  53:22
Keisha holiday

Unknown Speaker  53:37
three

Matthias Miller  53:45
current on overtime pay

Matthias Miller  54:02
we don't handle salaries on here

Speaker 1  54:09
and we should have we should have entered those already by now just for testing but we haven't. So salaries would but could we have salaries appear there as well?

Unknown Speaker  54:31
Do we have another verification report for battling employees?

Matthias Miller  54:39
Well I mean, our hours worked in quantity doesn't make sense at all. Unless well are salaried some salaried employees maybe tracking time or no?

Speaker 1  54:57
No they are not the wording doesn't make sense I mean the idea would be if we could have that be conditional word says yeah salary employee it just says instead of hourly rate and do T rate and the quantity would say

Matthias Miller  55:23
salary

Speaker 1  55:24
or yeah we the salary quantity would always be one and the rate would be the week and then our week

Speaker 1  55:35
make good okay, we could even go as basic as just say salary employee we we say weekly salary. Obviously, we don't show any ot rate we don't show quantity we don't show rate we just show total for that week. That's our salary is really really basic. It's just X amount per week. And the occasional bonus

Speaker 1  56:07
No, I guess if we do that, we could also no need to show the date the hours were I don't know how hard it is to do conditional formatting on these but

Matthias Miller  56:25
yeah, we can do that.

Speaker 1  56:29
But no, I mean, that's the I'm talking ultimate are the ideal. If, if that cost a lot to do that. Then

Matthias Miller  56:48
well, most of the cost here is opportunity cost. So we're getting pretty close to me being delaying accounting because I'm working on payroll stuff. Well, I actually probably am there's Well, I don't know that I am quite quite but I'm getting I'm getting close. I've got design work that's waiting on me. So I would probably the two we are gonna want to handle salaried employees. We're gonna need that. And if we handle salaried employees it's a small step to under employees button times okay, I don't

Matthias Miller  57:43
think it's just a little dance and I'm going to be have to prioritize my my time appropriately appropriately here and not get sucked into too much. Yeah, well

Speaker 1  57:59
I feel like probably should just bite the bullet just knock this out and on payroll module and then move on because I mean, without these these final fixes we're not going to be able to make payroll live I mean, as silly as it sounds, we don't want to go live with a fix that works for eight out of 10 employees because we're doing too in the old version is

Speaker 1  58:34
that what I what I sent you last night, I should have set weekly salary. I just marked up what I think would be ideal for salaried employees weekly salary at the top get rid of quantity rate all that you just show the weekly salary

Speaker 1  58:54
How much are we talking with with the changes were? How much are we? How much do we expect are we talking to three days or is it more than that?

Matthias Miller  59:03
No, it's not two three days it's we're still within a scope of a day of my time but

Matthias Miller  59:19
yes, anyway I

Matthias Miller  59:29
was making a comment about a day of my time, like 1000 years but it's not quite like that

Matthias Miller  59:40
it is a day of my time it's going to mean

Matthias Miller  59:50
okay, let's do this. So I mean, I'm happy to make this my focus and get this knocked out. My big concern. I'm still really paranoid about it. getting behind the eight ball with Drew's testing. So let's Can we switch over? Let's see, oh, on the payroll production override just a quick update on that. I did get those fields added. But so it's a matter of updating the reports to show that to show those specific breakdowns which shouldn't be a huge, a huge deal. So yeah, progress made on that. So I guess my vote would be I know this is a high priority, get this out the door. Let's go take a look at blockers for drew that keep drew from moving forward on on FDI and, or mapping stuff. And.

Speaker 1  1:00:49
Okay. Well, one thing I want to add is the proposed changes on payroll module, are there quick fixes we could do to that bed. Give us what we need.

Matthias Miller  1:01:07
I think I'm pretty No it's fun. Well, I'm not too worried about it. It's okay. You're gonna have some extra blank spaces because I'm not going to be persnickety enough to go through and make sure that people don't have extra blank lines because of all the conditions that we're adding but no, it's not.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
It's conditional formatting and software as as as Tizi in Dutch like as as conditional formatting on a spreadsheet can make a spreadsheet be real slow and it's really have to think through a lot of situations to make it work, right. Is it like that in software as well?

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
It's a little bit and especially once you get into documents like this, because I mean with my particular point, you have to make sure that like it it will it will be so precise in its conditional inclusions that it will include extra line breaks if you you know depending how you put the keywords in there and stuff like that and yeah, see the other thing is normally in a you know, like an Excel if you have an if statement you have an if else and with conditions it's not quite like that you haven't given it for one condition and then you have an if that's the opposite of that condition and anyway it's it's close it's not terrible

Matthias Miller  1:02:53
Alright, so are we good jumping over to I got your email I think that was I mean it looks same to me I might

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
I might do it slightly differently than that but I think we're basically on the same page as far as what we're looking for

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
all right then we have

Speaker 1  1:03:26
let's see if it's helpful I can train through a drew in I don't know if he's available or not no idea but

Matthias Miller  1:03:35
sorry this just Yeah, nevermind um I think the main thing would be

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
I have a download I mean, if his issue was with the import, I my my only my only thing is anytime that we have a anything like this it is really nice to be able to have exact error messages. So we can speed up the process considerably. I'm thinking probably the easiest thing

Matthias Miller  1:04:41
would be if we would do

Matthias Miller  1:04:52
Do you remember how long a copy in a big tapes? The test system is? 30 minutes That sounds about right. Yeah. Do you know when drew last entered? I guess we could just we could just go back to let's see how my download speeds are feeling today. They didn't go back to last night. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:05:22
I think he did this. When you say import, that's what you call pushing data to assist accounting. Let's call an import. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:05:33
Yeah, it's done via an import. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:05:36
So here Tuesday, the 15th he started to run that, but I'm not sure if he could. That's that that process that runs real slow

Unknown Speaker  1:05:54
believe and send me this email Wednesday. I'm thinking he he did it. may have done it Wednesday.

Matthias Miller  1:06:16
All right, well, let me I think the best way to go about this is to grab a copy of the system and just try it on my computer.

Speaker 1  1:06:36
Oh, just replicate the scenario. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:06:41
Because I do have the speed ups actually, I could take the we could also live life on the edge. I could actually take the speed up live without doing a full update and tested live system that would be an option as well. Why don't I actually do that?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
In the chat GPT give you this. Comics,

Speaker 2  1:07:31
though, that that one came across Facebook the other day, and I just thought it was really hilarious. The actually, the most hilarious part is I gave it to Addison. And he's like, huh, and about five minutes later he comes back laughing It took him that long to figure it out.

Speaker 1  1:07:53
It reminded me of it. I mean, there's I think it's actually a joke but it brings out an important point where the guy is rich guy before he died, he pleaded with God like can he bring something along at the Heaven? And he said no. And finally he got the allowance to bring whatever he could bring in a like this in a suitcase and so he packed it with Anna what gold bullion is or something. Some type of gold bullion the most one of the most expensive most high value things he could in his suitcase and then he got to heaven. As the dove went St Peter's at asking what he has their needs, showed him his gold and he said oh you brought pavement

Unknown Speaker  1:08:49
Yeah, I heard that I've heard that before

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
what's worth a ton a lot does here as

Matthias Miller  1:09:09
well

Matthias Miller  1:09:16
see here do I want to do this I want to do like this

Matthias Miller  1:09:31
well did you want to and you want to hang around for a little bit while I see if I can replicate with what it's I don't know that you need to

Matthias Miller  1:09:46
to replicate what Drew was running into.

Speaker 1  1:09:51
Know that my main goal was if possible, if we could remove like you said remove blockers before. Before our Wednesday check in call out If he has time to work on more testing I mean that's probably step one. And then the transactions in the ledger is he's saying there's hundreds several 100 transactions in the ledgers and he can't don't make sense to him or they don't line up with so that you probably need to research that as well

Speaker 1  1:10:31
I mean, I can stick around I can I could go until 3am have any help but if not, I just like an update to Morrison and update to drew an eye on what what he needs to do differently and how to how to move forward

Matthias Miller  1:10:57
Yeah, let me let me take a look at it, see if I can figure out what's going on and

Speaker 1  1:11:05
on on to that the transactions in the ledgers so what what we were expect what Drew and I were expecting was we did the financial allocations on those buildings from May 15 to the 30 other 16 to the 30th 15 to the 30th 31st and because we we'd never pushed standard costing what we were expecting to see was the entire actual cause like obviously, there was no difference because standard costing was never allocated or never pushed over to accounting. So what we were expecting was actual costing in accounting and then plan was to take the buildings in our spreadsheet and just look at what buildings were sold. Or that another way that we didn't expect to see any variances but we expected the the cogs numbers the materials the labor and the production overhead to reflect the actual actual numbers for those for those buildings only for the buildings that had been sold and then the same with this good inventory the completed buildings but I'm curious I see these these reports are as of 815.

Speaker 1  1:13:16
Should have run these these reports incomes statement in the balance sheet should be as of 531

Matthias Miller  1:13:29
Although the transactions we would have in this case transactions would have been well

Speaker 1  1:13:40
you're saying the transactions most likely posted the 15th on Eighth 15th Okay

Speaker 1  1:13:52
would there have been a way to depose them by 31

Unknown Speaker  1:13:56
Yes

Speaker 1  1:13:59
because that's explained to him how to do how to do that as well because in order to do this testing we need to do both the transactions as a 531 Because if we go beyond that then we have buildings that were so you know in June by the delivery date on 530 ones obviously so we won't be able to unless he pose as of 531 won't be able to double check against our itchy

Unknown Speaker  1:14:37
okay

Speaker 1  1:14:43
am I thinking about that correctly? Like if is he Oh post them as a 531 then the actual building block of buildings that we fill out for kids Testing whatever was was built and sold within that timeframe the actual materials the actual labor and the actual overhead could appear as called on our income statement as of 531 well

Matthias Miller  1:15:21
as of now we don't allow you to do a cut off

Matthias Miller  1:15:33
we allow you to basically push all billing changes Yeah, sorry But bottom line I'm going to have to we're gonna have to modify these reports and give you a way to generate the some kind of cut off date or which ones to push across because we can set the transaction date but it would still look at all buildings across all time

Unknown Speaker  1:16:04
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:16:11
the other option would be to have a way this might actually be a better way to do it

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
to have a choice where transaction date between between the actual effective date when it happened versus the

Matthias Miller  1:16:46
versus a specific date ie today the reason why we don't want to do normally want to apply it based on the effective date or the date the actual event actually happened is in most cases you do not want to go backwards in time to modify those numbers

Matthias Miller  1:17:12
well,

Speaker 1  1:17:14
okay, won't we always want to do that because we have we're going to close out a quarter and then 15 days after the end of the quarter we say oh, okay, now we know what our labor actually costs for for the quarter we why those actual numbers billings then we want to apply the variance as of we do the end of November as of September 30 and not October 15.

Matthias Miller  1:18:00
And you you if somebody like this payroll thing we're looking at if numbers shift if your p&l shifts for February because somebody went and I don't know market building for beds having been delivered in February because it got missed you want the February numbers to update or shift

Unknown Speaker  1:18:33
only if we okay when we update the building records that will be

Speaker 1  1:18:49
when we we update we track the date that we update our actual cause on a on an individual building record like in the example you gave well no marketing it delivered very wouldn't change that but

Speaker 1  1:19:14
we do we have a do we track the date when a building moves from standard costing to actual costing on the individual building record?

Matthias Miller  1:19:24
Not currently we know so

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
if we don't

Speaker 1  1:19:43
Okay, we just stomped the number on whenever. Okay, so in my example, if we were 15 Do we say we know what our production overhead was for the quarter? We apply actual costing

Speaker 1  1:20:03
Now we say, well, we had thought based on our standard costing through Ember, we thought production overhead was going to be 100,000. We've now discovered it's 120,000. That $20,000 variance you'll want to apply number 38.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:34
Does that faked that that it'll just look at the billing records as they are on the Inter. So

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
the actual costing there, I'll use the actual costing, then apply the variance. On the date we select to post the variance Correct.

Speaker 1  1:21:17
Starting with is myself here, I think I should just take a few minutes and write out an actual sample on a piece of paper, make sure it makes sense on paper and then send it over and then I think we could have

Speaker 1  1:21:35
meaningful discussions then me just family here?

Matthias Miller  1:21:42
Yeah, I think I think that's fair. If you want to call him that, that I'm still concerned about edge cases, what happens if a building for some reason shows up? Somehow for a historical year? And it should, and we believe it should impact accounting, we don't actually want to modify mean, there is a hard cutoff where we should we should not ever, in any situation create transactions past that point? Do we just do it as the first date of the current accounting period? Like if there's one for from 2022 that impacts 23 numbers? Do we just do that as January 1 23? Or, or what happens? I know it's an edge case, that should never happen, but we still need to account for we still need a California.

Speaker 1  1:22:41
Okay, so you're saying if we, what happens is in 23, we discover billing in 22. That was Mark, we failed to market delivered

Unknown Speaker  1:22:54
in 22. Therefore it and therefore it never showed up as a sale. The cogs never showed up in 22. But now we're saying well take this this was was delivered in 22. We're in July of 23. How should we handle that? Right?

Speaker 1  1:23:25
So if we update the delivery date to what to the correct date

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35
and we run a

Unknown Speaker  1:23:42
push that to the accounting system then don't want it updating 22 numbers

Matthias Miller  1:23:55
kind of worried about oh, go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:24:01
Are you have you built in anything that like when you can actually close out a period like what we say this is we don't want any basically saying if we have an edge case like this allow us to still allow us to update the delivery date correctly. But then on the accounting side, prompt us to say hey, you've made a change that affects sounding information in a closed or frozen period. You really want to you want to actually want to post it then or you want to post it as of default did to the first First available date in a period that's not been closed yet. Could we do something like that or?

Matthias Miller  1:25:17
And then which closed date? Is it? Is it the actual accounting closed date? Or is it the closed date of the actual costing?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:42
Well, probably the close date of the actual costing

Matthias Miller  1:26:14
and you're okay if

Matthias Miller  1:26:21
this is probably more okay than otherwise, but you're okay with

Matthias Miller  1:26:34
means that if you if you do it every quarter, and you run July numbers, and you run an income statement for July that your July income statement might might shift over the new new the next few quarters until you finalize the actual costing for the overhead. Well, that might not be the right the right category, but it's the idea that you would then want the

Matthias Miller  1:27:12
you would then want the variance to be backdated to the right date within that period.

Speaker 1  1:27:27
Yes, so can we can we use

Speaker 1  1:27:37
create a warning where if we make changes guess what, what defines closing a period? Like? I think once we apply actual costing a period or a month then

Unknown Speaker  1:28:03
we consider that close but that brings

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
i don't know I'm blanking out here

Unknown Speaker  1:28:22
well

Matthias Miller  1:28:30
seems like I made an assumption that what we want to do on a daily basis is just catch up accounting to match what's what's actually in the system. And it sounds like what you're saying is you actually do want these transactions to be dated as of a specific date. And it seems to me that on the billing accounting impact on the sales order impact that we need to specify for each for each item, what the date of the transaction should be taking into consideration accounting periods and FTA actual cost periods.

Speaker 1  1:29:24
Yeah, what's the difference between an accounting period and an FDI? Actual cause period? Or when would they be different I should say.

Matthias Miller  1:29:33
But typically, my understanding is your accounting periods are going to be you know, end of year and the only reason really to consider that is for technical accuracy. Not practically speaking that you'll never have a extra cost period that will cross that boundary Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:30:27
So you have a clear path forward on how we should proceed with this?

Matthias Miller  1:30:38
Well, number one, I need to fix Drew's imports. I'm not sure if that's actually going to give us what we need. Number two, I mean, I can send out a proposal for how this would work. I am really hesitant to do warnings, because it means that

Matthias Miller  1:31:00
well, maybe it's warnings, but it's some kind of exception report or something that gets emailed to you guys or something, I don't know. Because the person who's creating the problem is not going to be the be the accounting team, it's going to be most likely if somebody in Dwayne's office who's making a change doesn't understand how it affects affects stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:31:27
So I would rather have something that works. That's good enough. In all cases, and you can figure out what

Unknown Speaker  1:31:41
yeah.

Speaker 1  1:31:48
Or is the next Okay, so one thing that I'm tasked with is to put together an outline of how, like the

Speaker 1  1:32:04
schedule, or the timeframe of, of how we would do finished goods allocations and dating it back to like the last day of the period.

Speaker 1  1:32:22
I'm not sure I'm struggling to wrap my mind around Highwood minutes. It's basically thing production overhead here it by October 15. We'll know what it was for you three and then we'll want to apply that variance to as of November 30. We don't have all the invoices that we don't like September 30, October 15. We don't know don't have all the invoices, we don't have actual costs on what has been incurred up until that point.

Speaker 1  1:33:32
While I make, here's a proposal. Why don't you while you're chasing Drew's issues, why don't I put together because there's another hole that Larry pointed out that a potential hole in this process if I put this and organize my thoughts on paper and send it over, and then take a look at that and we'll give if that helps us? Yeah. All right. Let's Okay, good. Let's do that.

Matthias Miller  1:34:07
Okay, sounds good. Thanks, guys. Yep, thanks.
