Unknown Speaker  00:17
Another one of my size. Good morning. You.

Unknown Speaker  00:24
So

Unknown Speaker  00:26
you're running into asset stuff with the input,

Unknown Speaker  00:29
yeah, can we just, we had talked about,

Matthias Miller  00:36
we talked about just having a hard coded list

Speaker 1  00:42
like a blanket. Like, yeah, yeah. I added the list. I did not add the field. That's what I was missing.

Matthias Miller  00:50
We could also, in the short term, just take the x 30 and create a user x 30. And

Speaker 1  00:57
I mean, as long as Dwayne doesn't mind if I update out from mother him. I can. I can do this in approximately 3.27 minutes. So why is two seven? But 2727

Matthias Miller  01:13
hold you to it. Well, there's no current user. He's not in there. Hey, Mark, hey, Drew, hello.

Speaker 2  01:23
Everybody decided to wear black today, or almost maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  01:30
Mine's a dark blue. Okay, it's

Unknown Speaker  01:34
close, though. So how how are you guys this morning? I pretty good,

Speaker 1  01:44
good, good, enjoying cool weather. And we just got back from Colorado a couple of days

Unknown Speaker  01:50
ago. Oh, good.

Speaker 2  01:52
Yeah, we're having cool weather here as well. Like, I don't know, for the last three weeks, maybe,

Unknown Speaker  01:59
yeah, 50s and 60s at night. I just raised

Speaker 2  02:04
somebody was telling me that it's there's some kind of unusual I don't know what. Something's different on the North Pole, and we're getting a lot of that cold air down. I don't said, I have no clarify so well,

Speaker 3  02:20
I do know that it's going to be a cold winter, because at the hay sale, the firewood auction was like double of last year. So that means it's going to be, no, I don't know what it means. That just means people want to,

Unknown Speaker  02:35
you mean,

Unknown Speaker  02:38
yeah,

Speaker 3  02:40
I got, I got two dump trailer loads. Last year for my total was about 800 bucks. Which one was a little smaller load. But this year, I paid 800 bucks for one big load. And usually the size of the load doesn't make a big difference in the amount of brains, but it was just nuts. 150 162 162 loads. And they something like 120 10, somewhere between 110 $120,000 worth of money for their 100 and

Matthias Miller  03:19
I wish we could. We could we could replace our entire auction. I mean, we could, we could double, or we could double our auction, just not quite double, but, or maybe just by selling firewood. That

Unknown Speaker  03:34
was pretty incredible,

Speaker 3  03:36
but there was a lot of good wood, but still, you know, and it's still one of those things. If you went out and slugged a chainsaw around and split it and did all the work like you were going to sell it, you would want close to that, yeah, back when I could buy it for three and 400 is like, I'm not even doing this work. I'm going to go buy it, especially when the money goes to 80,

Matthias Miller  04:00
exactly, exactly. It's like the best of both worlds.

Unknown Speaker  04:07
So

Speaker 2  04:09
Seth, is that about the same type of weather you're having out there?

Speaker 1  04:12
Yeah, yesterday was hot. It got up to mid 80s, but this morning is back in the low 50s again, and it'll I think today you might get back up to 80, but Tomorrow's a high of 60. It's, yeah, it's not normal August and September weather here.

Speaker 3  04:34
I just made the notice that Dwayne's wearing his only shirt. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:42
the only shirt I'm wearing.

Speaker 2  04:48
Have you worn that in public quite a bit already? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:54
Should I send you one mark?

Speaker 2  04:56
Sure we're out to have one. Yeah. But no, I was just thinking, if I see a guy walking down the sidewalk with a shirt that says it only, I probably think it's

Unknown Speaker  05:10
like God's gift to mankind, maybe, or something.

Speaker 2  05:14
No, I probably wonder what company that is good. Well, should we jump into the agenda we've got, I think we've got a lot of things to cover today. So

Unknown Speaker  05:25
sure.

Speaker 2  05:28
So we've got meeting scheduled, meet 11 again. Drew may be on, be able to be on for part of it. But actually, Matthias, if you could just send me the call it number. Yes, probably have it somewhere, but I will be on for sure. Drew may be on for part of it, and then we're skipping the next two weeks.

Unknown Speaker  05:52
So

Speaker 2  05:56
I guess while we're looking at schedule, just curious. Matthias the 25th What's your you're going to be at the Shed show? Are you? Are you speaking? Are you?

Matthias Miller  06:06
I am speaking. I also have a booth. I will also be. I can drop a copy in the mail for you, but also be. Have copies of this, the

Speaker 4  06:18
rock solid shed business. Rock Solid shed business, sure. So

Unknown Speaker  06:25
it's the only book you ever need.

Speaker 2  06:32
Where's the best place to buy a copy of your other book? The frictionless teams. It's on Amazon. Okay? Is this one on Amazon as well? It's,

Matthias Miller  06:45
it's going to be in a day or two. Okay? If you want to beat the if you want to pre Expo special, should be able to order it.

Speaker 2  06:55
Okay, so what's your job? What's your talk on?

Matthias Miller  07:00
My talk is on 2 million a year sales reps. So,

Speaker 2  07:07
well, I was not planning to go to the shed Expo, but I'm, if you're there, well, I'm kind of, where's it at

Unknown Speaker  07:18
Knoxville. Oh, well,

Unknown Speaker  07:21
that's a great place to go in the fall anyway, so

Speaker 2  07:25
you'd be interested in doing I think a few people from here might go. But

Unknown Speaker  07:29
September 25 I don't

Unknown Speaker  07:36
know,

Unknown Speaker  07:40
punishment I am, but what? Not sure how much of a glutton for punishment make things complicated for myself.

Unknown Speaker  08:00
Good. So,

Speaker 2  08:13
okay, so doing a meeting next week, and then I guess we should actually get another one on the calendar, because we're doing we got debt priorities for the 12th.

Unknown Speaker  08:26
What is

Speaker 2  08:28
after the 25th would that be? What is that September or October? 1 or second? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  08:37
our regular schedule would be October 2 and October 16.

Speaker 2  08:42
Do those do those dates work for everyone? I think if they do, we lose

Speaker 1  08:50
I need to check when I'm flying sometime right around there, oh,

Matthias Miller  08:56
I'm going to be out of town sometime in there too. What is that?

Unknown Speaker  08:59
What was the date?

Matthias Miller  09:03
Second and 16th, first and third? Thursday, okay, I'm good of October.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
The things that work for

Speaker 2  09:17
me, for me, let's plan for those days. If something comes up, then we'll we can make us. But

Speaker 4  09:26
good, that's good. Okay,

Speaker 2  09:31
so one and two Drew. Those are things you've been working on. So go ahead. Besides, you want to just open the incident. Yeah? Grabbing it

Matthias Miller  09:45
now.

Matthias Miller  09:51
So Seth, do you remember the talk about adding this ID for nachhi Id customization for nachhi files? I thought we did. Do you remember what the field is?

Unknown Speaker  10:05
ID? Type, custom customer ID.

Speaker 4  10:08
Oh, okay, which is a that'll do it. Save. Boom,

Speaker 3  10:15
yeah. Okay, so nothing else needs.

Unknown Speaker  10:19
Okay, that shot she did.

Speaker 3  10:24
The number two is just, I don't know if you can make it auto refresh, because there's couple buttons, and so it's like, click the button and then it shows up that you have no that you can't save changes. So the first gut feeling is, Oh, I did something wrong. It's not going to save what I just did. So if you can just make it auto refresh the page after clicking those three different buttons, it's just a sequence you have to go through cool

Matthias Miller  11:02
will, do we make it exit edit mode, Seth, at least, so you don't get the weird warning. Are these X 30 buttons? I mean, it

Speaker 3  11:15
would be a little bit of a it would be doable too, but to have to go back into edit mode is you have to go to Edit Mode to export, but then I guess it stays in edit mode. And I'm not sure if, if you have to go to Edit Mode to do the the emailing, or not. I mean, I'm generally in edit mode, but I don't know if it's required.

Speaker 1  11:45
No, it's I don't think it's required for well, okay, where's the email left?

Unknown Speaker  11:56
This is how the new declare.

Unknown Speaker  12:02
That export service, your call,

Unknown Speaker  12:08
confirm, uploaded, sent,

Unknown Speaker  12:14
then you have to refresh the page.

Matthias Miller  12:17
Also, okay, if we want a really cheap solution,

Matthias Miller  12:26
make the buttons exit edit mode, add a success message telling the user to refresh page. I don't know that we've got except,

Speaker 1  12:38
can we not do success messages? No, we can do. We can do a success message. How are you going to make it exit? Edit Mode. Just save record because that's already set.

Matthias Miller  12:47
Don't you have an X 30. You don't have you can't change x 30 to exit, edit mode like that. I know of

Speaker 1  12:56
I think we can. We can tell it to save record before running, but we can't tell it to accident

Speaker 3  13:02
and it and it is saved. I mean, because there's no save button or nothing that I you know,

Unknown Speaker  13:08
it's doing that part.

Matthias Miller  13:11
You could, okay, this is really, really obnoxious, but you could, um, um,

Matthias Miller  13:31
okay, I'm just horrible idea you could, you could have a red label in edit mode that says exit, edit mode to confirm uploaded, and Then you exit edit mode and button becomes visible. You could have a report that you run that just shows this, or you could, you could put this in a, actually, this might not be a, when do you actually? When do you actually literally need to edit this thing? Do you ever need to literally

Speaker 3  14:03
edit it? Not anymore. I did need to back when we were having some issues, but anymore I haven't needed

Matthias Miller  14:11
Steph. What if we had a what if we had this as a report with this with an auto push up pane for the detail screen and a and a report button for the Confirm uploaded, etc,

Unknown Speaker  14:28
we could is that too. So

Speaker 3  14:36
would it all function without giving those messages. If it were not in edit mode,

Matthias Miller  14:45
it would not refresh. It just wouldn't give the messages.

Speaker 3  14:48
So you still have to refresh, like to go from this to where it shows you the email thing, you'd have to refresh, okay?

Speaker 1  14:58
Well, I wonder if it's. This just a success message is decent, but then you still have to refresh the page. That's my

Speaker 3  15:07
success message, instead of one that says warning you say you're stuck down to save.

Speaker 1  15:12
Well, that would probably that still show, oh, for some reason, I was thinking if it was, say, record on an import, then it would refresh. Must not

Unknown Speaker  15:26
seems like it. I

Matthias Miller  15:29
mean, it probably refreshes, but it's not going How are you ending up in edit mode? That's my other question.

Speaker 3  15:40
I have to in order to hit the Export button, because the Export button is not there if you're not in edit mode. Now that might be something that we could change too, but that's why I was wondering if you could all function out of edit mode. Could we just move the Export button out of the edit mode and makes it that all works without going into

Matthias Miller  16:05
edit. Okay, so if we do this,

Unknown Speaker  16:08
oh, think it's only visible in edit mode,

Matthias Miller  16:12
well, basically change the status from draft. Or do you need to change the status?

Speaker 1  16:17
What would well, okay, so you have to hit the Confirm ready to export button, which then shows the export link. Is the Confirm ready to export?

Speaker 3  16:27
Oh, if you would refresh after, yeah, okay, that might be the

Speaker 1  16:34
Yeah. Might be the case. I mean, that makes sense, right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  16:41
Okay, but why wouldn't we just

Unknown Speaker  16:48
okay

Matthias Miller  16:50
so we could do so still this, this goes back to this, to this.

Speaker 3  17:14
Mean, I guess it also been a pain to have extra open windows, but if it just opened the next step in the next window, like it does do that for the email. But maybe that's just as impossible, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  17:34
whereas not,

Unknown Speaker  17:38
oh, that's super easy. I mean, not without extra clicks.

Matthias Miller  17:44
Okay? Well, we have, we have the we have the five minute fix, which is just telling people to refresh every time they click click a

Unknown Speaker  17:51
button. I'm gonna be Josh and say that's what we should do,

Speaker 3  17:58
yeah? I mean, as long as there's a name, yeah, you do. And you do, and you have this gut feeling that you did something wrong with getting the message that that does show up. That's the only message. So if we fix that, at least, that would help.

Matthias Miller  18:16
And then if we yeah, there isn't, there's an option to make it more more streamlined, I don't I personally don't think it's completely unreasonable, but it's more like an hour instead of five or 10 minutes. So,

Unknown Speaker  18:31
so another

Speaker 3  18:36
10 seconds per time, maybe 30 seconds a week.

Matthias Miller  18:45
Eventually pay off in a couple years. Yeah.

Speaker 2  18:52
Should we also look at, are you done with this portion of not just yeah, we've talked about this before, but if a vendor calls AP and says, Hey, I didn't get my payment, a quick, easy way to for AP to go see the notcha, to see the email that was sent to the vendor at the time, the not sure was initiated is there? I know there's a multi step process that we can do but I don't, is there a way that we can make it as easy as viewing a check?

Matthias Miller  19:31
Says I thought we had talked about this, had we

Speaker 1  19:33
yeah, we did, and I something, but started working on it, and then we ran into difficulties, and then I went and got married and

Matthias Miller  19:42
gotten back to it a couple later after how I mean, how complicated is it just to show a memo expression that shows with the email. Expect the email to be, um.

Speaker 1  20:00
Uh, as I recall, it was more complicated than expected because of, I

Unknown Speaker  20:05
don't remember why,

Speaker 1  20:07
let me, I think I might have notes in it, job on my side.

Speaker 2  20:13
Well, as long as it's cute somewhere in at the very least, I'd want to make sure we have an incident for it, and that it doesn't fall through the crabs. I mean, it's, I think it's just something to work on it.

Unknown Speaker  20:32
I think I haven't, yeah, I

Speaker 2  20:45
So Seth, how much, how much work? Do you have any idea on how much work? So when we go to prioritize for death priority in q4 is that, is it big enough to talk about then, or is it just a paper cut project and you just put in, um,

Speaker 1  21:01
I don't think it's that big. Well, how? What's the threshold for something like that? I don't know what size jobs you're normally talking about. I think it's more of an annoying paper cut than we have to find a way to do without duplicating too much code.

Speaker 2  21:19
Okay. Wow. I mean, typically, that's it. We shouldn't be talking on dev priorities, jobs that take at least three take at least four days.

Unknown Speaker  21:31
Yeah, it shouldn't be anywhere close to that.

Speaker 2  21:34
Yeah. Okay, so you said there is an incident.

Speaker 4  21:39
Yeah, good. Let's say.

Speaker 2  21:51
Did we get sorry? Little confused? Oh,

Speaker 1  21:56
sorry. Back to back to that. Dad had said that one option would be to have to just have a simple, blind, carbon copy email address that but I think when we had written this up, it was AP was wanting to see these emails. That would be an easy way they could go look, literally, just look in the email for that email address, yeah, that would be very simple on our end. Then

Unknown Speaker  22:27
they would, then they would just have to search for some key phrase,

Speaker 1  22:36
yeah, for for this email address, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:40
the vendor name would

Speaker 2  22:41
probably pull it up. Wayne. Do you have, I mean, from a workflow standpoint, do you have any thoughts on that, like so AP gets a call from Looney Grove bomber saying that asking about their ACH payment. It goes a vendor invoice, see that if or asking about payment, they wouldn't necessarily ask, but I see if they go to the vendor invoice asking about payment, and then they would, how would they be able to intelligently respond to that vendor

Speaker 5  23:18
Like, if we How would they know now, is there? Is there? So there's so there is already a link on the front. There is already a notch, a file link on the on the vendor invoice,

Speaker 3  23:34
yes, to the file, to the notch of records, but to actually see the email that went out, if they don't like it's just kind of complicated. They have to know what they're looking at.

Speaker 5  23:48
But, I mean, what? What are they going to gain from knowing of seeing the email?

Unknown Speaker  23:53
Yeah,

Speaker 2  23:55
well, okay, can we? No, I wonder, Should we just cover this with Dwayne later today? Like it seems like we need to, let's just cover that later today, Dwayne. I think we can figure out exactly what we need from a workflow standpoint. And that advice that sounds good. Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
Go ahead. I ahead.

Speaker 3  24:24
So this is that sales and AR, you sent something back by email, maybe put it in

Matthias Miller  24:33
Yeah. So question number one, why does it take two to three months to find out something's tax exempt. Am I allowed to ask that question?

Speaker 3  24:46
Well, yeah, I have the same question. I'm I'm not sure why, yeah, why is there that amount, the amount like, Okay. Occasionally, but it seems like we have quite a few that get changed

Unknown Speaker  25:03
way late.

Speaker 3  25:06
So, I mean, I don't know Dwayne, maybe you know or mark, you know more why they would be switched from taxable, non taxable, two months late draft. In fact.

Speaker 2  25:22
I mean, I don't without digging into it, but my guess is just lousy, a lack of a decent process up front, like you get the sales order, you should at that point, you you should know whether it's tax incentives or not, and if it's not, then you get fixed. I don't know. Do we have? Is this Wellspring solar? Is that? Do we have other you don't have other examples. Off top of

Speaker 5  25:47
i There are, here's my suspicion, Wellspring solar is probably some sort of corporate entity. And so whoever was in charge of getting this building went out and got the building, and then it gets to corporate, and corporate says, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't, we don't be sales tax exempt. And then there's this whole process to get it back around to us, is what I suspect.

Speaker 3  26:09
So it's not like somebody's in charge of making sure that buildings are taxable or non tax and he's just three months behind. And

Speaker 5  26:20
so if this is anything like some of the sales that we did with a solar company here in Virginia, it was, it is a corporate wrangling process, because they, like the guy who's in charge of going and getting the building has nothing to do with their AP and, you know, he just it becomes this giant email Round Robin and on and on and on. And so if this was, if this was an actual customer name, I would, I would probably drop the hammer a little bit hard. But things, it was a solar company. Yeah, it's, I suspect it was, yeah, it just an issue of getting, getting all the ducks lined up in order to get the right paperwork. And, yeah, it reminds working with the with the solar company in Virginia, reminded me, like working with the state of Virginia on the own one of the buildings that we sold through through the state. It's a it's fun. Maybe

Matthias Miller  27:21
you should have added a stern charge, not a discount.

Unknown Speaker  27:27
Yeah? Probably so, I mean,

Matthias Miller  27:29
so this is inevitable. It's going to happen sometimes, yeah? So come

Speaker 5  27:36
back to that, come back to that sales order. Oh, never mind you. Sorry. You were on the accounts receivable. I saw she has directive Indiana. I was like, wait a minute, but it's not the same thing. Never mind. No, it's not.

Matthias Miller  27:50
So then we've got two options, basically, one, one, the first one we have to talk about when Seth gets back, about effectively having tax changes hit accounting immediately, which, you know, when we were just doing liability, it didn't we need sales tax history immediately. So there's that. The other option, which I'm less is simpler to implement, and I'm less fond of, is having a sales tax basis. And have one option be latest filing, and one be, you know, current sales order

Unknown Speaker  28:37
for the accounts receivable report, yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:39
for the accounts receivable report. I mean, I think you make a good argument well. I mean, you can make a good argument that I don't know. You can make a modest argument that accounting should be up to date as we flip tax periods for sales orders,

Unknown Speaker  29:00
right? Um,

Speaker 2  29:01
so why? Why would we not update it daily?

Speaker 4  29:07
I wish the biggest Go ahead. What was

Unknown Speaker  29:10
the downside to that? I don't

Matthias Miller  29:14
think there's any downside, besides differential of implementation cost. Basically, we are not. We will have to add sales tax history rows without an effective period end date, because we don't know, probably wait to process these until or for there's the man

Unknown Speaker  29:45
Seth, yes.

Matthias Miller  29:50
What? How terrible would it be if we would add a, basically a an effective date to the sales tax history row, which is when we added the row? Yeah. Okay, and we added these on a daily basis instead of when you file sales tax. And would you auto calculate the period end date for the next ending period, or would you leave it blank until and just stop it in when you

Unknown Speaker  30:17
you run

Matthias Miller  30:19
your sales tax,

Speaker 1  30:21
I think probably leave it blank until we run sales tax next, and then we go grab all the rows that need it yet.

Matthias Miller  30:28
How terrified Are you of this?

Unknown Speaker  30:38
Think it's too bad. So take some work.

Speaker 3  30:48
Question on, if it is going daily, do we need to have a run the sales tax thing at the end? Or isn't that what's happening each day?

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Sorry, one more time

Speaker 3  31:10
so, so if this is being calculated daily, then is that running of the sales tax report that I have, is that going to still be necessary? Or can I just pull up the report and say, Oh, it looks like this is what sales taxes do right now for that,

Unknown Speaker  31:36
the period we're reporting on, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:50
like, if you go to the menu, really understand what I'm saying. I don't know, sorry, maybe

Speaker 5  32:02
I should just ask my questions verbally, instead of, instead of chatting in the background with with Matthias on, on, on this.

Unknown Speaker  32:09
So I'm what

Speaker 5  32:13
walk me through. Why? Why you want to update sales tax daily?

Matthias Miller  32:18
Now, when you say Update, Dwayne, we're not literally saying update. We're saying, we're saying, like, as in pinging. We're saying we want to update sales tax history rose on a daily basis to catch changes, and if there are any changes, we're going to push those changes to accounting on a daily basis. So first of all, is

Speaker 5  32:38
this only sales tax rate changes,

Matthias Miller  32:43
rate changes, jurisdiction changes, use tax changes.

Unknown Speaker  32:48
I mean like, how often does this stuff change?

Unknown Speaker  32:55
Fairly good percentage. I would say

Speaker 2  32:58
what we're trying to achieve is so that we look at our accounts receiving the report that that total matches the total on the balance sheet.

Unknown Speaker  33:08
Why wouldn't it?

Speaker 2  33:10
Well, because of because the accounts receivable report looks at all the sales orders and their status, and the balance sheet looks at the transactions. And so if I'm understanding correctly, what's happening with if we have a currently, if we have like this, Wellspring solar accounts receivable, report immediately updates when it says, oh, there's no sales tax. So the AR amount goes down by it for the amount of the sales tax, but the balance sheet does not know that, oh, we don't need to that transaction does not update the balance sheet, does not know that we do not need to pay sales tax until drew runs to sales.

Speaker 5  33:50
So this is not, this is not necessarily you're not then that's okay, if I'm understanding what you're saying. You're more concerned about changes in transactions that are happening on the sales order versus rate changes, or used a tax rate changes. It's more about what's happening on the sales order versus,

Speaker 2  34:12
well, it's, I think it's all about the transactions. Yeah, connected to the about getting the transactions updated in real time. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  34:21
that makes more sense.

Speaker 3  34:23
Like sales tax functions perfectly fine, the way it is, as far as AR and looking at what we have there on the records on sales orders, that works fine. It's just the balance sheet and the sales order report or not, they

Unknown Speaker  34:41
patching

Matthias Miller  34:46
Seth half a day,

Unknown Speaker  34:51
probably

Unknown Speaker  34:58
after Seth. Half a set, half a set day.

Matthias Miller  35:08
Good. So this means, though, that drew, if you're in the middle of something, and some sales guy hops in in the middle of the day, it'll, you'll see a discrepancy until the next morning, just so you know, yeah. Okay, good.

Speaker 3  35:22
Then do I still need to do the same Yes, tax history thing that I was doing before?

Matthias Miller  35:32
Yes, you will still preview sales tax liabilities and and then at that point. So basically, we're going to add sales tax history roads, but not define what period they're for. You're going to look at this, okay, push it in and then say, yep, might actually be a little bit more than half a day, because the previous sales tax liabilities should yeah, it's probably closer to a day.

Matthias Miller  36:01
Okay, unless you literally Seth list, we can literally ditch this and just assume that all this tax history rows are in there. And so this report just shows dated items. Mm, hmm,

Speaker 5  36:24
okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask, I'm gonna ask another question. You really want to ping tax jar every single day on all open sales orders? This isn't paying tax jar. It wouldn't, so wouldn't ping tax jar.

Unknown Speaker  36:35
No, got it.

Speaker 2  36:40
But good point when you were thinking, because we pay tax jar based on the amount of pings. So we Yeah, that would add up, yeah,

Speaker 5  36:46
if you, if you were going to ping tax jar every single day, that the pings go through the roof.

Unknown Speaker  36:52
So our table files with equal change. So the the

Speaker 3  37:06
paying happens anytime the sales tax is changed. If somebody went and made a beta change sales tax, then it won't repay at that point, and then that creates the sales tax history, rather, right? I

Speaker 1  37:20
mean, I think it's named. When it's a ping run, it's invoiced, and then there's ways to manually repaying it. So if we see that the rates or jurisdiction changed, then, from what, from what has been pinged, from texture, yes, then we will then that night, the scheduled task will run, and we'll cash row in the history Archie

Speaker 5  37:48
adjust. Is that a theoretical three ping transit on each sales order. So once at the beginning, when you get the tax rate, two, when you invoice it, three, when you run sales tax you're running. Are you paying again? Then

Unknown Speaker  38:02
we're not being again.

Unknown Speaker  38:05
So only, only, really two, unless you manual

Unknown Speaker  38:08
pay, unless you manually pay. I think

Matthias Miller  38:11
as far as I know, you want your tax rate to be effective as of the data was invoiced.

Unknown Speaker  38:16
Yeah, that makes sense.

Matthias Miller  38:20
Seth, if, if we, if if we, if we said this report only assume that everything was already calculated, yeah, which I think is

Unknown Speaker  38:31
fine. I think so

Speaker 3  38:33
there's occasionally some that come through that something is wrong and I have to go in and repaint. Now, I've never run into any issues that it didn't want to go through then. But there are some I don't know. Maybe you can't see them on this yet. Maybe another column space to the right, but wherever the x is there. So there you got some. So is that what you're talking about? You're talking about. You're assuming you have a thing on, incorrect or not.

Matthias Miller  39:06
It's more like,

Matthias Miller  39:15
I think the worst part, no, it's

Matthias Miller  39:25
I don't know, still makes me it does make me nervous, though, not that it's fine to be

Speaker 3  39:32
if you know if the system, if we want to leave it to where we still run this that I don't know that's problem,

Matthias Miller  39:39
so that I can work out the details. Yeah, mm.

Unknown Speaker  40:04
Good, good. So

Speaker 2  40:11
purchase transactions, not linking to asset, I have some response. Added a response there? I think we're misunderstanding, or we're missing each other just a little bit. Matthias, so, no, maybe not. But so there's, there's two different sets of accounts we're looking at. One is predefined accumulated appreciation accounts, which I think we can just set that on the company. Add an RTD accounting company. I think that's what you're thinking. Is on the accounting company. You add, like, your your class, and then your, your accumulate depreciation. With that, is that correct?

Matthias Miller  40:58
Yeah, or why wouldn't we? I'm going to change my proposal. I think it makes more sense this way,

Unknown Speaker  41:12
on the

Matthias Miller  41:15
on the accumulated depreciation account, an asset. Well, I don't know. I guess the other way makes sense. Okay, so this is the

Unknown Speaker  41:30
Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  41:35
One of the questions I have right off the bat here is, I

Speaker 2  41:46
yeah, there's only those six or seven accumulative appreciation accounts, which are pretty rigid. I don't see us. I mean, the next five years, maybe adding one or two, but maybe not. I mean, it's pretty they're pretty much big buckets. I mean that those are now, okay, now these depreciation expense accounts, these are more, more likely to change. Which is this list?

Matthias Miller  42:19
This list here?

Speaker 2  42:21
Yeah, those are basically saying what part of the company is, is using this or renting this asset, like the 1004 ones are depreciation that's hitting production. To 52 is logistics. To 60 is sales. So,

Speaker 4  42:40
uh, what is it?

Speaker 2  42:45
So, yeah, like property improvements. Or, if you take property improvements, for example, if we do a, let's say the the cave, pave. We spent $20,000 for paving a parking lot on the accumulated depreciation account that all is going to depreciate under the property improvements depreciation, regardless of it. But then where we expense it? Where? If it's used for parking, for import, employee parking, production employee parking, then it'll be expense in the 1004 account, if it's being used by drivers to park. Well, what's more likely to happen is, if we would do that, you spent $20,000 and it calculates to $100 of depreciation expense per month. We may say, Well, okay, half of it's used for production employees. A fourth of it's used for haulers to park their REITs, and the other 25% is used for administrative or for sales people. And then we'll, we'll split it out to those different expense accounts.

Matthias Miller  44:12
All right, so one question I do have depreciate so we are currently.

Unknown Speaker  44:21
How do we know?

Matthias Miller  44:36
Hang on assets. This is what I'm looking for. Okay, so if we go into asset here, have the accumulated depreciation account. Okay? Why wouldn't we? Here's a new proposal.

Unknown Speaker  45:53
So, so, so,

Speaker 2  46:09
yes, wow. Okay, walk me through how this would work on if we're setting up an asset, a new asset, or if you go back to the asset we had that's and just sure put it in edit mode. And so typically, what I will do is I'll come in the details at top and come down and select the asset class, yes, and then okay, based on your proposal. What would happen then? Or how would you fill it? First

Matthias Miller  46:37
of all, I would move this section down below depreciation. Or I would move depreciation up above accounting so that you naturally fill an asset class. So then you would select asset class, and then in here we would show all expense we would filter this list down to expense accounts that are tied to this

Unknown Speaker  46:56
asset class.

Speaker 2  46:58
Now the expense accounts, I don't, I don't think they're necessarily tied to an asset last the asset class just says, Okay, how many years of depreciation is there, and what should be the accumulated depreciation? I think it could be, I think that the expense account would just show all depreciation expense accounts, unless I'm missing, I don't think, well, it

Speaker 3  47:27
would be possible that a particular account could be used for multiple classes, right?

Speaker 2  47:31
Yeah, like, I'm just looking at my list here. Maybe I'm okay. I might be missing. No, you're right. Matthias, I think, yeah, you're from one step ahead of me. You're thinking, if we use the building to building improvements, asset class, and we would only get the building and building improvements, like, in this case, there's like, three or four different ones, we would only get those.

Matthias Miller  47:59
Yeah, let me, let me see if I can, Let me see if I can prove,

Unknown Speaker  48:05
prove my point.

Unknown Speaker  48:26
Would any actually be different classes?

Matthias Miller  48:31
Rolling stock? Okay, so Well, yeah, it doesn't hold it definitely does not hold up because you have a property improvements could be property improvements real estate. Rolling stock does, portable buildings, does? Rolling stock does sometimes, but sometimes production equipment and fixtures is tied to rolling

Unknown Speaker  48:54
stock. Those might be more incorrect in

Speaker 2  48:57
existence is because of the manual. So can you add, how hard is it for you to add the the the account number prefixes to that, to that. Louise,

Matthias Miller  49:12
wait to the the, sorry,

Speaker 2  49:14
what you found, I think, what? Okay, like in the first one. So you've got, that's the the GL account, and then the list that you have down below is just, is that just the occurrences of, what is that list? The building those are

Matthias Miller  49:29
asset those are asset classes

Speaker 3  49:36
for particular transactions that are in there, but for

Matthias Miller  49:39
No, not for trend, I mean, for for assets. So, Oh, sir, for the building and improvements expense account. We have buildings and improvements, production equipment and fixtures, property improvements class, real estate class. So I. Yeah,

Speaker 2  50:01
okay, the real estate, we can rule that one out, because we have, yeah, but I think your theory does hold true. I think we're just looking at mistakes here. Because, okay, let's just look at building and building improvements. So

Speaker 3  50:21
is there a hopper in building and building improvements,

Speaker 2  50:26
property improvements, like that should be placehold improvements, concrete pad, property improvements. I mean concrete pad should be under property improvements. It shouldn't

Speaker 3  50:38
be here, or it should we have some incorrect depreciation expensing going on. I think

Matthias Miller  50:45
that's not bad for a guy who's not an accountant.

Unknown Speaker  50:49
Well, how about let's do this.

Matthias Miller  51:00
But then presumably we have the same issue as well, which we could actually do. I

Speaker 2  51:20
now, yeah, are we now looking at accumulate depreciation?

Matthias Miller  51:27
Now we're it's both, it's the expense account and the accumulated depreciation. So here we have, we have some where I

Speaker 2  51:47
Okay, the 12, 1208 12.08 are all those are the accumulated appreciation ones. So the, okay, I can the buildings and billing improvement ones. So, so one glitch we do have the real estate. So real estate does not depreciate, but it forces us to select and accumulate depreciation accounts. So we just select, typically, select the building and building improvements, and it just depreciates $0 every month.

Unknown Speaker  52:16
Sure You mean select real estate.

Speaker 2  52:20
We select the real estate asset class. But then it, yeah, then it forces us to we don't have, maybe we don't have a depreciation, accumulate depreciation account for real estate, because

Speaker 3  52:32
so it will say buildings and building improvements early is not mm,

Unknown Speaker  52:50
so then

Matthias Miller  52:54
I mean, here we have here we Have this mismatch that we saw. So real estate, effectively, doesn't. Well here we actually do have depreciation entries for real estate, but presumably, like you said, like it doesn't, it's irrelevant production equipment and fixtures that all looks good property improvements. So then here we have real estate. Is

Matthias Miller  53:29
Real Estate always property improvements?

Speaker 2  53:35
Yeah. I mean, is that the correct way to handle it? We could add a we could actually create a GL account for accumulated real estate depreciation, which is kind of, we'll never use it, but we

Unknown Speaker  53:47
could, it would just always be zero, and I

Matthias Miller  53:52
don't know that you need to,

Speaker 2  53:55
okay, I think it should always be one. I if I pick one, I'd pick property improvements. But,

Matthias Miller  54:01
okay, I mean, I would in some way to simplify this report

Matthias Miller  54:11
here. Let's do this. We could do this.

Unknown Speaker  54:19
Well, I don't

Matthias Miller  54:20
know that's strictly necessary. So here portable buildings, portable so here's one rolling stock, accumulated depreciation of rolling stock that's in production equipment, fixtures.

Speaker 2  54:39
I gave it. What did you do there? Where you combined the two? You've got 5229 rolling stock, and then production equipment and fixtures. Where's

Matthias Miller  54:48
the I'm showing the expense account and the accumulated depreciation account.

Speaker 3  54:53
So it's accumulating in production equipment, fixtures and being expensed as rolling stock. Right? Is

Matthias Miller  55:03
there another way? Would it make more sense to this might actually make more sense, let me, let me, let me, let me. What if we did,

Speaker 3  55:10
well, it is a rolling production mixture, right?

Matthias Miller  55:13
What if we did an asset just did it like this?

Speaker 2  55:17
Yeah, I think that asset classes and then.

Matthias Miller  55:34
And then, you can see fairly quickly where, and let's also do this.

Speaker 2  55:41
Um, can you switch the this is getting pretty picky, but the accumulated depreciation expense first that have that column on the left is because that's typically the order we said. It's and

Matthias Miller  56:14
then we could do this as well.

Matthias Miller  56:33
We can sort by asset ID, because I think it's not going to be sorted by, okay, so this will tell you fairly quickly. Now,

Matthias Miller  56:48
this one, these don't have classes.

Unknown Speaker  56:49
Yeah, there's probably this.

Unknown Speaker  56:53
They get in there.

Unknown Speaker  57:00
Well,

Speaker 2  57:03
so Matthias is your thought that should we take this report, go through and clean up anything that needs cleaned up, and then verify if that

Unknown Speaker  57:17
holds true to where the

Speaker 2  57:21
selecting the asset class would give you only would give you would pre populate the accumulated depreciation expense, and it would give you a filter list of depreciation expenses that only pertain to that asset was

Matthias Miller  57:44
Yes, and I think, I mean, from what I can see, because these are duplicated rolling stock, portable buildings, so vehicle lease does not, I don't know what

Speaker 2  57:54
that I mean that should not be there. Go ahead and delete that. That mistake. But cake, bank

Matthias Miller  58:02
all of these appear on the surface to be a one to one to an asset class.

Speaker 2  58:07
They they are. So we're wherever you have a buildings and building improvements asset class, you should always see the buildings and building improvements. You're exactly right,

Matthias Miller  58:17
yeah. Okay. So then I mean, yes, I think, I think that is a, I think that is a fair proposal. So, so what I would

Unknown Speaker  58:30
is it,

Matthias Miller  58:33
you guys should clean this up, clean up this list. And

Speaker 2  58:44
yeah. So what happens if we make a change, like we go through say, oh, not sure what we were thinking here, but we make the change, will it past transactions? It will just leave, like, in the wrong depreciation expense account, which is, it's okay,

Matthias Miller  59:09
yeah. And then when you sell, it'll tie it all out.

Unknown Speaker  59:13
It'll still link all of the transactions or bring those in,

Matthias Miller  59:20
pretty sure. I guess I don't even know.

Unknown Speaker  59:33
I don't know the i

Speaker 4  59:44
That's the wrong maybe create asset sale you're checking Seth, yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:56
because we're not using. In some ways, it would have made more sense to simply have depreciation events with a date and an amount on the date and the amount on the asset. And

Unknown Speaker  1:00:19
got that idea from

Matthias Miller  1:00:25
and then use that, and then use that to push it to accounting so that if you switch accounts, which maybe you don't want to do this, but then it could automatically create adjustment entries to get into the right account.

Speaker 1  1:00:40
I don't think it's gonna work right if we switch accounts.

Speaker 2  1:00:46
So if, if we do that, okay, if we do switch accounts, but we simply have to go in and edit all. Be pretty painful unless it edit all. But let's say we find one and say, Oh, this was going to the sales depreciation expense accountants should actually have been somewhere else, and we added all those past transactions. That's what we would need to do. We could

Matthias Miller  1:01:12
show you a report. Well, yes, except a bunch of these are going to be back in 2024, um, in a closed period. So

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
we could easily give you a report of all transactions where the accounts don't match, where the depreciation of I think depreciation and transactions should be able to Well, this one wouldn't have depreciation. Let's do something like

Speaker 2  1:02:17
you're saying you could easily give us a report that would allow us to go here and change like you have, almost like a find and replace, let's say all of these,

Matthias Miller  1:02:30
maybe something like that. I'm not,

Matthias Miller  1:02:41
we don't have a good way to we would show all transaction line items, right? No, yes we could.

Speaker 2  1:03:01
I think we actually should just go and do this, because we're also if we want to audit our asset list with our accounting, and this is like the accumulated depreciation stuff, mainly the accumulated depreciation is the Wrong place, then it won't tie out into the look.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
Has come to alcoholic, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:04:50
well, I think we just found of Okay. Do we think.

Matthias Miller  1:05:06
Do we think that the account changes in class changes, account changes are liable to happen in the future,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
not accumulated depreciation changes, depreciation expense accounts, maybe more likely, but let's say you have, I don't know You say

Speaker 2  1:05:40
you start looking at numbers and say, Oh, this mule that we've been listing as part of production overhead. A year ago, we started using that one to deliver sheds. But the accumulated depreciation, no.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:59
But, I mean, I think all of this is this,

Speaker 2  1:06:03
this report that your editable report, your you outlined. I think I would consider it a clean up, a one time cleanup report. And if we run into that in the future, it's we can do it manually,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
right? Okay, all right.

Speaker 2  1:06:23
So trying to think we would Okay. Step One would be, we would go through this, the report you created, and make any changes, make the changes, make the required changes on the assets where we have discrepancies. And then your accounting cleanup report would look at that and say, Oh, your current transaction, your the old transactions, do not match with what the asset currently shows, right? And you could go ahead and edit that, and then and only that. Once we've done all of that, then we would look at making changes to the actual asset stream.

Matthias Miller  1:07:07
Yeah, yeah. And I think, I mean, I guess one of the questions, one of the one of the things, tickets, so should we go ahead and do we believe in this design enough that we should go ahead and implement it?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:35
You're saying that the changes to the asset

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38
drop list?

Speaker 2  1:07:41
No, I would. I would want to do the cleanup portion first before we do that, because I'm afraid we'll, we'll uncover things that we don't know. Now. How

Speaker 1  1:07:55
are you going to deal with locked grades? Are you going to just create a transaction to move

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01
it across.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:05
Well, couldn't we just unlock those queries and just run the end of the report and then

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14
lock them again?

Speaker 2  1:08:17
Yeah, okay. The reason we need to okay if we don't change lock periods and we go to make the sale of an asset, those transactions won't pull in. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
Right now, they wouldn't I think, well, what it would do, I think, okay, is change the current depreciation account by the total amount, Instead of looking through history.

Speaker 3  1:09:00
So, so if, if 20,000 got expensed to some prior account, and now we have it set to a new account, and 30,000 was there, it would, it would in the sale of the asset, would all 50 would go to that latest account. But wouldn't that just simply be a change that can be made to the transaction. I mean, just, or does it? If it just looks at the total depreciation, there's no way that we'll know that it actually was two different accounts.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:36
Probably you wouldn't

Speaker 2  1:09:38
know offhand, okay, but we're just talking about accumulated depreciation accounts, right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:45
I think it's just the accumulated depreciation one.

Speaker 2  1:09:49
Well, I don't think there's, there's a need to go back into to change 24 I mean, the only thing that would. Yeah. Well, the only reason would be so that it matches with our asset management list.

Speaker 2  1:10:14
So okay, do Am I thinking correctly? If we unlock the period we push those changes in 24 What would change? The balance sheet? Number nothing would change. But within the accumulate depreciation, some numbers might shift around,

Matthias Miller  1:10:30
which should be fine. The

Speaker 2  1:10:32
only thing is, if we had depreciation expense, no the expense accounts, we would just not update in 24 because that could, that could change. Because some go to balance sheet, some go to income stream, that could, we just have to be careful, just update accumulative depreciation.

Speaker 3  1:10:53
Yeah, I think we could appreciation and then, and then, that's the only element of it that matters in the sale of the asset then ended,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:03
so good.

Matthias Miller  1:11:12
So the so the cleanup then can so we can limit the cleanup to, do you want to limit the clean? Cleanup just accumulated depreciation? Or do you want to fix the expense accounts year to date?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:27
Yeah, fix the latter.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:37
All accumulated in year to date.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
Expense you

Speaker 2  1:11:43
going to change your report to show that Matthias, or do we just need to watch that and Philip

Speaker 4  1:11:50
edit edit them. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
a three, extremely

Matthias Miller  1:12:22
bad, so my vote is we just do all of them

Matthias Miller  1:12:34
and basically give the same report, but you split between accumulated depreciation versus depreciation expense, and then you can set a minimum transaction date, and you guys handle it

Speaker 2  1:12:44
good. I like it well, thanks for slogging through this with with us. This is one of those things. I expect it to be a five minute discussion, but,

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
well, you never know what you're going to uncover. So yeah,

Speaker 2  1:13:02
for better handling, for retreat buildings, that is said, I simply made a mistake on what account to pre populate. So that's all that that is. Well, okay, Matthias, you had a note on referencing you said,

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
maybe not. I thought inventory

Unknown Speaker  1:13:24
further up you had a

Speaker 4  1:13:30
So, so it should be sorry. I

Matthias Miller  1:13:44
so it should have been. So you said, finished goods, inventory, raw materials.

Speaker 2  1:13:52
Is it the FDI destination account? So you're saying, you'll just reference that, and then there's no, no need to to send it again on the accounting company, right? Perfect,

Matthias Miller  1:14:03
Seth you want to she got that

Speaker 1  1:14:05
scenario, which one I was trying to find the other account.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:14
What? Simply the FGI destination.

Matthias Miller  1:14:18
So this change, we should use the FTI destination account instead. Are

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
okay? Got it

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
good? Okay?

Speaker 2  1:14:42
So economy's preferences to finish goods inventory. That's need to move that one forward so we can. We're shooting to have a complete audit of balance sheet counts by end of September. This is uh.

Matthias Miller  1:15:00
On I this was one. This is one that's in my court to chase to find out what's going on. Is that

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
right? Yeah, got it duly noted, um,

Speaker 2  1:15:15
cash flow reports. So this is probably something for Joel, but yeah, what is needed to complete cash flow reports about a year ago. We, over a year ago, we were into this. We kind of shelve cash flow statements as a lower priority then, but we're looking at making this a priority for fourth quarter. So

Unknown Speaker  1:15:38
I think Joe wanted to hand it off to me.

Matthias Miller  1:15:44
For Joel has known coding changes that need to happen, or,

Speaker 1  1:15:50
I don't know I just last November, he said that once this needs to happen, then

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
wants me to take it. So

Speaker 2  1:16:03
I think what, what would the idea of us? If you get with Joel, get an idea on you, you get an idea on what the size of this project is. So we have an idea on slotting it into the artist fourth quarter, if we could have then sometime before the 12th would be ideal, is that, is that fair? And if you

Speaker 1  1:16:27
need that's just to talk with him and figure out what we need yet and what size it is

Speaker 2  1:16:33
correct. And I think he has all the details. Well, I guess that's the other question. If you need more details from us on exactly what you're looking for, what we're looking for, then, yeah, let us know. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:52
let's, let's skip seven,

Speaker 2  1:16:58
jump to any wholesale dealer portal. So Wayne was going, we're looking to shift part of this to be free into Seth's part. Wayne, do you have details for Seth? Or what?

Speaker 5  1:17:10
I have loads of details, if you will, open up the incident. 677, before I

Speaker 2  1:17:30
this makes me feel better doing I see that a lot of this was done nine four, a lot of my notes and things for Reddit, nine four as well. We didn't need it

Speaker 5  1:17:40
before the days. Thankfully, that the time is not on there, that way, that way you would not see that it was done like two minutes before, before we got on the call.

Matthias Miller  1:17:50
Did you mean like this?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:55
Something like that?

Speaker 2  1:18:01
Yeah. Well, Dwayne is there? Okay, now's good time to go through this or not. I mean, basically Seth, what we have here is we're hoping to to have this wholesale dealer portal by end of the month, end of September, for several wholesale accounts to start using. Wayne has the details here.

Speaker 5  1:18:22
Oh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go jumping in there yet. Matthias, it's, it's nowhere. So essentially, what we're, I'm going to do is I'm going to copy out a lot of the stuff from the retail sales portal. There's some key changes, and we're going to adapt a lot of these reports that are already there. There's some key things in here, if you want to, you want to dive into this mark.

Speaker 2  1:18:43
Well, is that the best use of our time? I mean, we're down to 10 minutes, but I think if you and Seth connect by me at a later time, I think that would be great. So,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
yeah, let me know if you Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:19:03
and then prioritize projects. But let's run through seven real quick. Yeah, the split income statement. I'd like to get an idea of size on that before death priorities as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:20
Hey, so good.

Speaker 2  1:19:26
I think this is, well, I think, but I'm not a developer, so, but I think this is pretty straightforward, create a split income statement. This is kind of going back to the classes idea, which we dropped, but we're splitting it to revenue channels as detailed below. So the revenue channels would be three different channels, retail, wholesale, and says right based on the settings on the dealer.

Speaker 2  1:19:53
And then three options of splitting out each account mark.

Speaker 5  1:19:58
Let me ask you a question. You said. It retail, wholesale and sheds direct. Are you going to divide between wholesale and sheds direct? Well,

Speaker 2  1:20:08
so the note at the very bottom could just be added directly to our income statement report as a prompt with a multi selection. So you could go either way. You could say, I want to, I want to see them all, all three individually, much like the Well, same as what we're doing on the accounts receivable report now that prompt,

Matthias Miller  1:20:32
why wouldn't we use classes and Add Class support to accounting impact. And then,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
okay, I

Matthias Miller  1:21:11
and then the only real question is, I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:28
we need to,

Matthias Miller  1:21:37
because your entire sales order is always Under so this Okay, two things. Two things. Number one, this only applies to sales orders, correct,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:46
no. It applies to to every account on the income statement.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:55
So

Speaker 2  1:21:58
it might be more helpful. If you look at the example I've seen how I've been doing it in Labor Office. Yeah, look at that briefly. I don't know. I don't want to repeat the your story this morning. It's kind of timely. Or this is with the $10,000 Excel mistake your stories.

Matthias Miller  1:22:25
Okay, so, not very helpful. Okay, there are some

Unknown Speaker  1:22:30
I'm going to assume,

Matthias Miller  1:22:34
okay. Basically what you want, though, is you want to be able to to manually assign classes for all automatic sales order transactions, if we go the class approach on, but then also have default class excitements

Unknown Speaker  1:22:53
Thursday

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
for

Matthias Miller  1:23:01
on a per account basis,

Speaker 2  1:23:06
yes, now this, obviously, there's something broken here. So this is worth, not almost nothing. But

Speaker 5  1:23:14
is that the $10,000 cheap mistake? Is that, what is that? What this is, I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35
is,

Speaker 2  1:23:41
I think Matthias, you're, you're thinking these, the transactions themselves, would be split

Matthias Miller  1:23:49
or no. Well, I'm thinking, I mean, on the sales order for, okay, for sales, on the sales order transactions, yes.

Speaker 2  1:23:57
And I'm thinking like, the the accounting transactions tied to like a sales order would remain just just as they are. And we're basically saying, if we use this class, this approach, we have the Totals column on the far right, and the glasses column is just good, simply dicing those numbers up. Yeah, oh. Uh, dicing up those total numbers. But, but, well, if, okay, if we go to three options of splitting numbers per each account, so, so, so something like revenue, we're going to say, okay, just look at the invoice and determine which, which for it allows, right? And then the other commonly used one is a percentage of total revenue. So if we have $5 million total revenue, and $3 million is a million dollars is retail. So. Else, then 20% of that account goes to that expense. Account goes to retail meet. 80% goes to the or

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
right. It's prorated based on

Speaker 2  1:25:17
and it would shift based on the time period you're looking at or it could like, if you look at it, if you have, if you're looking at it for one month, and the split is 5050 or retail is 50% but for a year it's retail is only 10% then it would be divided differently.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:46
What are the these

Matthias Miller  1:25:50
would be like for for cogs and similar types of things?

Speaker 2  1:25:54
Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing we could look at on my spreadsheet, that that has some value is if you go, if you expand the rows between h and r, you can see how, how I'm splitting those. So the revenue stuff, all of that is per invoice, except, like carport commissions, 100% is going to retail. That's the fixed percentage. And then you come down to the calls that's all per invoice. It's only calls and revenue that's per invoice. And then you get into logistics stuff. Most of that's just a fixed percentage, where it's just a say, Okay, for this company, 85% or 95% is for it's a fixed percentage. And then you have percentage of revenue, which is more like in the admin costs, like management wages or support wages. It's like, how much time do you most of those are just as a percentage of revenue. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:27:04
it seems to me like the sales order piece you could get very close by assigning

Matthias Miller  1:27:24
Uh, sorry, by assigning building costs based on the sales order. Now, if you have vendor invoices that don't get tied out like that, then that ends up failing the other the other approach is just straight up ditch. I'm a little leery of the income statement is complicated enough that if there's a way that we can tie it back in directly with the income statement. It would dramatically simplify our lives. Now we could still see

Speaker 2  1:28:30
are you saying create a report that runs off of the income statement, like a separate report?

Matthias Miller  1:28:35
Well, I mean, yeah, we have two. Okay, I'm going to assume you're going to want to want to do things like alternate period comparison, like other or is that incorrect?

Speaker 2  1:28:56
No, because if we do that, we already have, let's say, three columns, if we split it out and then we to try and do comparison. You're comparing three columns to No, I don't think we would need that. I mean, if we want to do comparisons, we could just do it, create a report for one period and then run it again for another with the two side by side. I think

Speaker 3  1:29:30
the difference between this and classes is that classes would be determined on the transactional level, or this is more determined on the account level, right?

Speaker 2  1:29:41
Yeah, it is. All of this would be determined on the account level, except the ones that per invoice, like the revenue the calls,

Matthias Miller  1:29:50
right? But that's where on the per invoice. It would be really nice to specify that. I mean. Mean, I don't know how to say it. I mean, specify it on a transaction level. That's, that's where the idea of it some kind of dynamic classes of some kind. Or maybe those would be, maybe we just, we, maybe we would just use classes only for buildings and sales orders for account building and sales order accounting impact, so that we can pull those numbers out appropriately.

Speaker 2  1:30:33
I almost feel like we should start out with some type of user report on this initially, if that's possible, to make sense and then,

Speaker 2  1:30:50
like the SO, SO backing up. The sole reason for doing this is to try and give us we have good financial information now with our income statement, but is to to say, okay, where, where are we making money, where are we losing money, or what, what portion of the business is doing well and what's not doing well, that that's the, that's, that's The the goal we're trying to achieve here. So

Matthias Miller  1:31:24
can we? Can we cut corners on on this by doing things like,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:37
Okay, if, if,

Matthias Miller  1:31:41
if we can, if this doesn't have to print out, like a, like a standard income statement, and it looks mostly right, but not completely 100% right. I mean, you'll, you'll still have things in this order, etc, etc. But maybe, maybe we don't have, maybe we don't have total rows, or, I don't know, like, at least for version one, I'm very nervous the income statement looks deceptively simple. It's one of the most complicated reports in the accounting system, and so either we have to come up with a model that fits well into that fits well into that structure, or we need to create a dumb down income statement.

Speaker 2  1:32:36
Well, I think starting out with a dumb down version, and then maybe later, moving to, if we determine that it's necessary worth it, moving to something more like the income statement would be the right approach to take. And are

Matthias Miller  1:32:53
you looking for an estimate for the whole project? Are you looking for an estimate for

Speaker 2  1:33:01
Well, I'm looking for an estimate that would do the equivalent of what this spreadsheet does, which I wish you could see the right

Matthias Miller  1:33:16
I'm gonna wildly make up numbers and say It's one to four weeks, and I think it's almost certainly less than four, and it might be close, I don't Know I, I'm, I'm,

Matthias Miller  1:33:39
I'm slightly nervous. Well, I think, there you go. I think Ford is very, very pessimistic. But I, I don't I'm not even completely comfortable with, I'm not completely I'm not comfortable with with a design, even for a user report

Unknown Speaker  1:34:03
you're not comfortable with what

Matthias Miller  1:34:05
I'm not comfortable with.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:17
Oh, hang on. I

Unknown Speaker  1:34:39
yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:34:41
I think that's my, I mean, I think that's my basic answer. And the first thing, even for temporary user report, I want to make sure I'm happy we're happy with the design, even for a temporary User Report, because even that, even there, we need to, we need to make sure we're going to be adding fields for it and supporting it in that way. And I. Uh,

Speaker 2  1:35:07
well, I'm wondering if, I mean, maybe the right thing to do for right now is, I don't know it's, it's cumbersome and it's clunky, but is, is the right thing to do for right now is to continue just there's work I could do on my template where I basically all I'm doing is exporting the income statement for a period, dropping it in here, exporting a sales order report that shows all sales orders, no and the calls, and dropping it in here. And it kind of works. Hey, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:43
Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
we're over time. I need to, I need at least a little bit more information before I can give you. So I think, I think spending some time talking through it, if it's, if it's a value and importance, I think spending, I don't know, 15 to 30 more minutes talking through more precisely what this ends up looking like, and give you a way better estimate might be, way less might be, I don't know. Maybe there's an option that's a couple days I don't know. I just don't have enough information to or I don't think we're enough on the same page,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:22
sure. No, I think that's

Speaker 2  1:36:29
kind of thinking we should do that now. Or should we just, I mean, we could look at it next, next week. Wow,

Matthias Miller  1:36:39
I can. I need to, I need to drop now. I would have some time this afternoon if you want to, if you'd want to drop back in or,

Speaker 2  1:36:51
yeah, I think, I think that would be good. What? What's a good time for you?

Matthias Miller  1:36:54
I can do three, three to four.

Speaker 2  1:36:58
Yeah, let's plan for three. Um,

Speaker 4  1:37:01
and then we can

Speaker 2  1:37:10
truly discuss priorities then as well on what we colored. Her, yeah, we can do that.

Speaker 4  1:37:17
Okay, all right, sounds good, awesome. Appreciate it. Yep, thank you. Applause.
