How to know when you are micromanaging.

Speaker 1  00:06
Many of us have experienced the micro managing leader dot someone who has been looking over our shoulder and making sure that we do everything right. Many times when we're in the situation, we feel like nothing that we do measures up. But here's the question

Unknown Speaker  00:26
sorry, back up.

Speaker 1  00:28
Even though we never want to be that kind of person, many of us unintentionally fall into that trap of becoming a micromanaging leader. So how do we avoid that trap.

Speaker 1  00:40
To understand how to do that we need we need to understand what effective delegation looks like.

Speaker 1  00:47
There are two ways of delegating. You can delegate, you can have task driven delegation, or you give small assignments and individual steps for people to follow. Or you can have outcome driven delegation where you where you show people what needs to be done, and allow them to determine the process and to allow them to control the process to getting it then let's take a look at something something sorry, back

Unknown Speaker  01:19
up.

Speaker 1  01:24
When when using task driven delegation,

Unknown Speaker  01:30
we basically end up treating people like machines, we tell them,

Unknown Speaker  01:33
we give them direct step by step instructions

Unknown Speaker  01:35
of what needs to be done,

Unknown Speaker  01:39
we have to understand that

Speaker 1  01:41
we have to understand that people are not machines, and we can't treat them like that

Unknown Speaker  01:46
outcome driven

Speaker 1  01:49
delegation allows us to clearly define what it is that we're looking for, what are the non negotiable and allow allow our team members to find the best best path from here to there.

Unknown Speaker  02:03
Just because we use output

Speaker 1  02:06
outcome driven delegation does not mean that we don't, we don't document the the steps required, or we don't follow it a checklist. But it does mean that

Speaker 1  02:17
we put the control of the process into the hands of our employees.

Unknown Speaker  02:24
So the first important distinction

Unknown Speaker  02:26
is between task driven and outcome driven delegation.

Speaker 1  02:32
The second important distinction, and the second important element of effective delegation is setting clear expectations of

Speaker 1  02:42
of the timeline. In many ways, this is just a matter of clearly defining the outcome.

Speaker 1  02:48
But many people fail to set these this this expectation clearly, and because of that,

Speaker 1  02:54
the the leader will check in frequently with their team member to see and ask them question, is it done yet? Is it done yet? Is it done yet,

Speaker 1  03:05
and this ends up becoming a in this in the end of micro managing their team members. In that way,

Speaker 1  03:15
I want to make an important note on outcome outcome based delegation, outcome driven delegation.

Speaker 1  03:25
Just because you're delegating an outcome to a team member does not mean that you it does not determine whether or not you help them with the process for some team members. Some team members will be highly engaged, when they have the opportunity to figure out the process. You let them know what it is you're looking for, and they find the best way to get there. other team members will find that overwhelming. And the best thing that you can do for them is give them an existing process, give them a roadmap that they can follow, and they'll they'll follow and they'll they'll make sure that it happens and there's there's some hybrids between the two of people who want to have a starting place for process but they'll do they'll do whatever it takes to continue improving upon that process and making it better and making it their own

Unknown Speaker  04:07
in the next email we're going to take a look at

Speaker 1  04:10
what what it takes to set effective outcomes

Speaker 1  04:15
and the next email we're going to look at how to clearly define outcomes and how to set up your team members by success by clearly articulating what it is that you're that you're looking for. Until then, let's with
