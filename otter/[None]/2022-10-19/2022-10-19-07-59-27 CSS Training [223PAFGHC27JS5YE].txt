Unknown Speaker  02:37
Good morning Matthias merry Morning. Good Morning see? All right okay All right alright, so ready to go. Is

Matthias Miller  05:28
Yes, I am ready to go.

Speaker 1  05:32
All right. So we are looking at images again today. And I think probably the thing to do would just be to start with the to do mm items take it from the top

Unknown Speaker  05:52
and go through

Speaker 1  05:57
Nick and I have a call with the clients right after this call. So probably actually want to wrap this one up 510 minutes early. And we'll be ready for that call. And for that one, we're planning to go through some to do items for them. And then once we get through all of those questions, then we'll probably start reviewing the proposal from the top with them. The whole down to row 210 is actually down to row 250 Or further is pretty much ready for further review. So just we have some miscellaneous questions for you and and then well minus a track record which is still a bit chaotic, but hopefully it will be able to clean that up on this call. Okay. Anyway hitting it hard

Unknown Speaker  07:02
making some good progress all right. Best place just to start from the top. Yep, let's start from the top.

Speaker 2  08:40
Makes sense well, I guess question would be you know, if this is this is

Speaker 1  08:50
this attraction on a per tract, Rick wreck basis record. So I don't think they're going to want to have to go record every time. So this is basically I guess, just to make sure because the overview here, this is this first one here the downpayment amount is they, they would make a for tiered percentage of they would make a deposit or down payment to the landowner of say 10k. And this is kind of to help ensure the landowner gets paid for something because it's it's kind of like a commission based thing for these these tiered percentages things so, landowner might not see any money for a long time, if they don't start harvesting right away. So they give them a downpayment of 10k, and then they don't pay them. It's kind of a credit that that all the tallies go against that credit until they've harvested $10,000 worth of logs?

Matthias Miller  10:09
Can we just do this? And then when we calculate totals on a payment? I mean, it's a question of where it gets stored, isn't it?

Speaker 1  10:21
Yeah, now there is. So this that was the basically the initial thing. And then later on, they told us that they that they want to be able to, they want to be able to edit that amount. So they can keep pre paying the landowner, that if, okay, if they want to be able to keep money in the landowners pocket, just because yeah, to help keep things. But sometimes the landowner will get start getting a little grumpy if they're not getting paid for anything. And there's all kinds of work going on on their property, but they're not getting let's see money for it.

Matthias Miller  11:00
Do you understand the proposal here?

Matthias Miller  11:08
The original proposal that was proposing these work.

Speaker 1  11:14
You seen the one the highlighted proposal number two or

Matthias Miller  11:18
general principles? How is I was planning to handle down payments and with expense withholdings?

Unknown Speaker  11:27
I'm not sure that I do.

Matthias Miller  11:30
Okay, I think that's the problem. I think if you understand that, then the rest of it will make sense. So they will have a so a downpayment and expense withholding is just shuffling money around. Of when money gets transferred, it does not affect who actually ends up. It's it's not, it's not a question of who owes money when it's earned. It's not a question of who has earned money or who is owed money. Technically, it's a question of timing on how we pay them, right. And so my plan was that you would say, Okay, I'm going to make a $10,000 down payment. And then there's a payment that gets associated with that. And then the next time I make a payment, I'm going to say, Oh, I have a balance of a $10,000 down payment that we need to recoup, I'm going to do a minus 2000, and recoup 2000 of that. And ends. And so, in the same with expense withholding, oh, we made, you know, buckets of money here, but we're going to have to build a road. So I'm going to do an expense withholding of $5,000. And then later when I expense it out, which we haven't really talked about how it works to expense it out. Well, no, then then you say, then you go build your road and you go cut timber. And you make boatloads of money again, and you pay them the $5,000 back? Am I understanding it correctly?

Speaker 1  13:24
Let me just double check what my notes were for the expense withholding that one was. Yes, right. So that was expense withholding. They withhold a certain amount and then although I'm not sure if they ever I'm not sure if they ever actually pay them back for that amount.

Unknown Speaker  13:52
Oh, it's just a like I think it's like I use

Speaker 3  14:00
good usually added value to the property so they keep the

Unknown Speaker  14:05
money that they withheld. All right. Explain it.

Matthias Miller  14:13
Wait, they owe? Like if I if I, if I write I build a road. Then what you just said

Speaker 1  14:27
you're getting a road instead of a $7,000 payment.

Unknown Speaker  14:34
Got it? So

Speaker 1  14:48
they're essentially handled the same way but one is, yeah, one is a down payment of a check and one is added value

Unknown Speaker  14:58
to the property. Okay.

Matthias Miller  15:02
And okay so so in that case what we should do is

Unknown Speaker  15:11
we should

Matthias Miller  15:24
okay so the down payment is just shuffling money back and forth the expense is actually saying hey we don't actually owe you that much now the question really comes down to when do they open when do they

Unknown Speaker  15:37
When do they

Matthias Miller  15:45
so the the expense never has to balance out I don't really care doesn't really matter which where it lives

Speaker 1  16:06
I don't think it matters where it lives as long as they can as long as they can set it on the tract

Unknown Speaker  16:13
and you configure it

Speaker 1  16:16
edit it over time on the tract like they might start and $1,000 down payment but then they want to add I mean, I guess they could create a $10,000 payment that then just you know has a

Unknown Speaker  16:30
macro and

Speaker 1  16:33
track those down payments over time but then they still would have to count all the you know, the yard tallies and pulpwood loads against that take them out of that essentially,

Matthias Miller  16:55
why is it important to edit those on the tract mostly ask him to understand

Speaker 1  17:05
well the tract is the central central place for for information about the tract I don't think they've been thinking of these as payments they're thinking these more as like expenses that get entered on the tract. But now that we do have a separate payment record, we could use that for the down payments

Speaker 1  17:30
add a new payment type of down payment and then have a macro that just shows all the down payments the total down payments over time but the expense withholding

Unknown Speaker  17:54
I guess maybe we could do a payment type for that too.

Matthias Miller  17:58
Or just let's just do this. Now it wouldn't be a payment type it would be an adjustment of payment and so I'm fine with this

Matthias Miller  18:12
so it's not that different from a pulpwood load you have a date down payment and then you still have a

Unknown Speaker  18:32
this is an orgy on the track record Yeah. Like that

Speaker 1  19:42
alright so we've got a payment adjustments RG on the track record date, who downpayment expense withholding payment ID and The down payment would be so if they put on $10,000, then it would a $10,000. line item essentially would be added to the payment. You say that may be negative?

Matthias Miller  20:19
Yeah, I mean, on the down payment, the first one is 10,000. And the next, you know, next month you do n minus five 5k. And the next month minus 5k. And that's how you would apply your down payment towards payments.

Speaker 1  20:32
So you would, you'd have to manually you'd have to manually add that or negative amount back into the payments.

Matthias Miller  20:43
I thought they didn't want it to be automatic. Or they sometimes didn't want to do it all in one fell swoop that they wanted to spread it out across a couple of months.

Speaker 1  20:51
Oh, no, that would be they would be adding to the down payment amounts like they would have.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
And, Nick, you can

Speaker 1  21:01
chime in to hear if you think this is how it is. But I think they would still be they would have made that $10,000 down payment, but then say three months, six months later, they're giving another that point, it's like an advanced payment or additional payment of 5000. So that that thing of the down payment being editable would it would keep increasing, they wouldn't necessarily ever decrease that a down payment amounts. So they do an upfront payment of 10,000. And then maybe three months later, six months later, they do another

Unknown Speaker  21:41
another 5000 Is that how you understanding it, Nick?

Unknown Speaker  21:48
I'm not remembering that but I could just

Matthias Miller  21:55
So Tim, the way you're remembering it is that they make a $10,000 payment and and they don't write a single check until the next time they've crossed the $10,000 boundary. And if they make an additional down payment, they don't write a single other check until they've crossed that boundary and the down payment gets automatically applied.

Speaker 1  22:14
Right this is I have a note further up this is basically pre paying the landowner so you they read $10,000 downpayment check and and they harvest logs until they reach 10,000 And then once they reach 10,000 Then they start paying the landowner for those logs unless they've written another $5,000 Check and so now that now the logs will keep piling up Yeah, until they reach 15k

Matthias Miller  22:51
Okay, but in that case

Matthias Miller  23:27
so there's a difference what they're doing is they're adjusting.

Matthias Miller  24:02
Okay, so let's start with expense withholdings, and I'm not sure whether this should be one or G or two. Maybe it should be two or GS. Expense withholding is simple. That's like a pulpwood load

Unknown Speaker  24:16
except it's negative.

Matthias Miller  24:21
Simple one time adjustment gets tied out to payment. And you in our payments report. We never pay a payment until it till it's more than zero. Right? Everything's fine with that. The downpayment

Speaker 2  24:45
gets a little tricky but what might be nice? Is

Matthias Miller  24:59
like how We know is a downpayment

Matthias Miller  25:27
should you make a down payment

Unknown Speaker  25:49
why can't they be handled the same

Matthias Miller  25:55
Why not on a payment record

Unknown Speaker  25:58
because yeah I get

Matthias Miller  26:13
what you're saying so basically what you're saying on a down payment record you say I've made these down payments against this particular payment which takes the balance down

Unknown Speaker  26:25
and

Matthias Miller  26:27
the running balance just increases increases increases until it crosses zero and then it finally gets paid

Unknown Speaker  26:39
what if

Unknown Speaker  26:42
what if we wouldn't even use the payment records

Unknown Speaker  26:46
for the down payments

Matthias Miller  26:51
What if we wouldn't use the payment record for the down payments What if it's any with both of these it's

Unknown Speaker  26:56
just a again going back to that scary virtual wallet thing it's just a credit on their account essentially

Matthias Miller  27:06
it's actually easier than that

Matthias Miller  27:24
downpayment you can think of as a prepayment right

Unknown Speaker  27:39
and well here's how you could do it

Matthias Miller  27:56
you could wait to zero out you can allow multiple I don't that's not that doesn't make sense. Good I said that okay, you could do a virtual wallet

Matthias Miller  28:17
so when you calculate your payment balance how do we validate that you can only have one pending payment at a time

Unknown Speaker  28:29
we haven't been planning on that and I think

Matthias Miller  28:35
the problem is that we're tying out pulpwood loads I don't know I think what virtual wallets are just getting weird because we're tying out specific pulpwood loads to specific

Unknown Speaker  28:56
Okay, here's an idea.

Matthias Miller  29:00
I kinda like it kind of don't. down payments are a new payment type.

Unknown Speaker  29:07
down payments

Matthias Miller  29:10
do not have to be immediately tied out to another payment but at some point they do

Matthias Miller  29:18
when you pay a down payment

Unknown Speaker  29:26
I hate this Lincoln

Matthias Miller  29:36
Why could we not?

Unknown Speaker  29:56
What don't you like about this approach?

Matthias Miller  29:59
You haven't been urged? On the track with the date, amount check number and then a payment ID that it gets applied to

Matthias Miller  30:15
and it just takes the balance negative that amount and if you magically zero it out and then you put in a zero check number and you

Unknown Speaker  30:26
close out which will never happen but

Matthias Miller  30:31
once it crosses back the negative boundary into the positive number then you make

Unknown Speaker  30:37
a payment so they would eventually I mean you would have a

Speaker 1  30:45
you just would have that payment sitting open for potentially months until having a yard tallies to

Speaker 2  30:54
bring it to a positive yep Mm Hmm That makes sense yeah, I think I like that

Speaker 1  31:21
it sounds really simple you're not having to run with like said it's simpler than a virtual wallet I think I like that as long as they don't need to settle somehow more frequently than that but they would still with with report we've got they would still if we allow the report to show unpaid payments, they can still send summaries we're just piling up a whole bunch of yard tallies on the summary for this payment and they can still send those to the client or the landowner Yeah, so it worked that way for both down payments and the expense withholding

Unknown Speaker  32:23
basically yes

Speaker 1  32:33
and they could just keep adding rows and either RG and we keep

Unknown Speaker  32:38
adding that to an NP payment I think that

Speaker 1  32:47
sounds really simple. I think like I said the only question would be as if they would for some reason need to to settle things more frequently than that. But I think that's a question that we can ask them here on a call today Yep. So would you mind if you could then like remove all the strike through text down to history and then just put a

Unknown Speaker  33:24
brief summary

Unknown Speaker  33:25
under your your RG there

Unknown Speaker  33:29
to argies saying this is putting into argies would set the

Matthias Miller  33:43
I'm gonna I'm losing track of my endurance you guys can reinvent.

Unknown Speaker  34:05
As a negative amount on the record rate. Name is And then this one

Matthias Miller  35:44
here it says treated the same as down payment as far as no tele payments until

Speaker 2  35:51
until the balances until no balance reaches zero.

Matthias Miller  35:56
So it's effectively the same thing as a down payment. Yeah, like functionally it works identically right?

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Yeah, I think so.

Matthias Miller  36:08
So I'm gonna argue

Unknown Speaker  36:09
this can go actually, if you

Speaker 1  36:12
could leave some of those notes Well, I guess I can pull them up some of the details of visibility and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
Okay.

Matthias Miller  36:25
So that in that case, I'm still gonna make an arc one more argument to make this a single payment adjustment

Unknown Speaker  36:33
RG

Matthias Miller  36:35
with the type downpayment versus expense withholding if they function identically why clone the RG?

Unknown Speaker  36:47
That's it is that too confusing? Maybe it's not a big deal

Speaker 1  36:57
we'll be fine as long as they again they're gonna be using the software every day so they'll they'll know where to go I don't know

Matthias Miller  37:08
maybe doesn't matter Nick Do you have an opinion

Speaker 1  37:22
we're gonna put a note in there and I can ask them if they have a preference between

Unknown Speaker  37:27
and what it is it is clear to have two orgies substantially clear I think it's fine to leave it like that.

Speaker 1  37:40
And I would maybe even argue to have all that first one pre payments or something like that. Since they're going to be including payments during harvest, it's not just an initial down payment.

Speaker 2  37:54
But right so it depends to what that yeah and their terminologies yep okay

Matthias Miller  38:13
walk or advances would be another Yeah. Possible term

Matthias Miller  38:32
they're wanting to input the prospectus section,

Speaker 1  38:36
right so this is a variant for inputting information about the prospectus and then automatically comparing that with with actual harvested information.

Matthias Miller  38:51
Got it what happens if they don't account for specific species that's there in the prospectus?

Speaker 1  38:59
We would the this RG is going to automatically fill with a row for each species for each species in the active species record in the solution so they could just leave the number of trees blank or I mean zero

Matthias Miller  39:20
right.

Speaker 1  39:22
Leave it blank and then if you know if they're no maple on the prospectus, but they harvest three maple it'll just show up as you know. They harvested three more trees than

Unknown Speaker  39:37
than expected. Got it Okay, um Well I missed that.

Matthias Miller  40:00
I mean I think the RG is fine in that case

Matthias Miller  40:13
is the average literally from the RG or is it a weighted average in any way

Unknown Speaker  40:20
pretty sure it's a literal average from the RG

Speaker 1  40:25
so like they're up in the screenshot like the third column average DBH it'd be a little average of now I mean I guess you got the question if it's zero then if you're excluding zero then although How would an average take into take a blank field into account as a treat it has nothing

Matthias Miller  41:13
I mean normally in an average would be treated at zero but I think if you typically if you had we just need to specify

Unknown Speaker  41:32
I actually have to do DM

Unknown Speaker  41:37
there about it here Hmm Can we put

Unknown Speaker  41:45
can we do averages in an RG or they have to be separate

Matthias Miller  41:56
they have to be separate fields and macros underneath

Unknown Speaker  42:00
I'm sorry this tape Well technically but yeah, no thanks.

Matthias Miller  42:21
Technically you could you could have a total row and have everything be an editable expression and if it's the total row it shows the total and otherwise make us give giving me the hairy eyeball

Unknown Speaker  42:55
that's what I would do so basically you just add a

Unknown Speaker  43:07
total field total sum

Unknown Speaker  43:10
average field into there at 24 Yeah.

Speaker 1  44:16
And by seamless You mean they would actually be a row at the bottom of the three only

Unknown Speaker  44:21
RG yes

Matthias Miller  44:43
maybe taking it too far there are some options. So you could say

Unknown Speaker  44:58
not just Don't think it's terrible

Matthias Miller  45:05
one or both of those options I mean is it that unreasonable that when you go in to enter these things that it's twice as tall as it needs to be

Unknown Speaker  45:22
that'd be like on a child screen yeah on screen and

Speaker 1  45:32
that might be a good option because they would presumably only be entering this prospective and prospectus information once at the at the onset the track record

Unknown Speaker  45:48
so that could be a reasonable approach Yep. That's cool

Speaker 1  46:12
and how much like what would be the difference that you'd think and as far as cost and complexity between just having a big RG the defaults to 15 rows and

Unknown Speaker  46:28
has the expressions underneath versus your data entry or child screen and read on the original the main screen

Matthias Miller  46:47
I think that cheapest option is a child screen with a bottom report. mid size option is an RG which will have a fixed row height and then the most expensive option is a fixed row with the embedded table embedded directly into the

Unknown Speaker  47:09
into the screen

Matthias Miller  47:11
neck with you and I'm going to guess that the if if it's going to be 20% cheaper to do the bottom report and it's going to be 30% more expensive to do the memo on the main screen actually maybe a little bit more than that 40% Nick does that

Speaker 3  47:38
that sounds right I don't I've never done a bottom or don't think it'd be very difficult so yeah pretty straightforward

Unknown Speaker  48:06
so if you do AD AD middle option is.

Matthias Miller  49:33
Here's this one actually going to be cheaper though.

Unknown Speaker  49:39
You still have to do all the calculations. Now you have a separate component to manage. It may be a little easier to code mostly because the component is is easier to work with.

Unknown Speaker  49:56
I don't know I'm going to say that these two I don't know maybe I'm kind of backpedaling now a little bit I'm gonna

Matthias Miller  50:35
I'm gonna guess that given some kind of margin of error that these two can basically be considered to be the same price and technically, no, they're not. But there's an acceptable margin of error that they're

Unknown Speaker  50:50
fair. Yeah. Right. Very helpful.

Matthias Miller  50:59
Is this a 2d dm? Or is it something else?

Unknown Speaker  51:01
Yeah. into 2d dm. Okay.

Matthias Miller  51:05
Well, we're 10 minutes till and yeah, not make it anywhere close to all the way through here.

Unknown Speaker  51:15
That's all right.

Speaker 1  51:18
You made some good progress on that, especially on track record, the payment stuff. So I think yeah, I think that's good. Okay, and, yeah, I get to go ahead and wrap this up. So we can, I want to export a copy of the first most of the first part of the proposal here to send it over to them, so they can review

Unknown Speaker  51:43
with us on our call here. So let's get that ready and whatnot. was good. All right. Well, thank you very much. Next time

Unknown Speaker  51:56
Yep, sounds good. Bye.
