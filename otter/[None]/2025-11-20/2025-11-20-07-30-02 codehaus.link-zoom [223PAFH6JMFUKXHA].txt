Unknown Speaker  01:14
Good morning. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  01:17
Why don't I hear you?

Unknown Speaker  01:21
Because you have to,

Speaker 1  01:24
because of the boom problem, because you have to do the boom flippy, flippy, boom flip I

Unknown Speaker  01:31
am joining the I'm joining the camp of big headphones on heads.

Matthias Miller  01:36
Wow, are those beats or something else.

Unknown Speaker  01:40
They are Sony, wh 1000s

Matthias Miller  01:44
Gotcha. Do you like him?

Speaker 1  01:48
I haven't figured out whether I like the what happened to my video, where'd go come back here? I haven't figured out whether I like the the noise canceling. Yet I always feel like I'm like, It's sucking on my ears.

Unknown Speaker  02:04
So that's weird.

Speaker 1  02:06
Which ones did she get Sony's Sony Wh 1000s? Are

Matthias Miller  02:30
brand of inspiration for the day, it's a lot easier to hold people accountable, and you can actually pull reports out of your accounting system.

Speaker 1  02:38
Pardon me, while I use my video camera is as a mirror. What in the world you have? You've never done that before. It's like very often,

Matthias Miller  02:50
yeah, let me pull the dose. Here.

Unknown Speaker  02:56
It comes with age. Set that comes with age.

Matthias Miller  02:59
I know it's terrifying how how fast ear hairs can sprout.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
And they're and they're like, they're

Unknown Speaker  03:09
persistent little buggers. They are

Speaker 1  03:14
Sorry, sorry, Mark and drew you walked in us talking about ear hairs and nose hairs. I Good

Matthias Miller  03:25
morning. Hey, good morning.

Speaker 2  03:29
I'm not sure what's different. Some you have a new look. Maybe it's your Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:39
well, I'm trying out these, these headphones, because I I like being able to sit out here at my other desk. The problem is that if there's a lot of noise in the with the other individuals, it tends to be pretty disruptive. And so these are supposed to be noise. I don't know background minimization. I don't know what the all the fancy terms are, but they supposedly do fancy things,

Unknown Speaker  04:05
yeah. But

Speaker 2  04:07
how do you where's your your mouthpiece is that also,

Speaker 1  04:11
no, they're like, they're like, there's like, several, uh, microphones around the sides of it, and it just supposedly picks me up.

Unknown Speaker  04:18
It's good quality. Audio really sounds

Speaker 1  04:24
good. Just make makes me, makes me look like I've got, you know, a whole football helmet on my head.

Unknown Speaker  04:30
Video types problems.

Unknown Speaker  04:33
I was thinking pilot when I saw you,

Speaker 1  04:38
but it's it the the first time I flew in Matthew Weaver's jet. Well, the only time I flew in Matthew Weaver's jet told me to put the headset on, and he said, Now push that button, which turns on the active noise cancelation. And I literally thought they shut the engines off. It got it gets that dead quiet. It's just like you. You take them off, and it's like, whoa. It's noisy in here. You put them back on, it's like, dead silence.

Unknown Speaker  05:05
Wow. It's, it's weird,

Speaker 1  05:10
yeah, yeah. Bose is active noise cancelation for pilots. Headset are is pretty amazing. Like, yeah, it's but you have to get used to it. It's like, always like, it always makes you feel a little bit disoriented, until you kind of get used to

Speaker 2  05:33
it good. Well, I am hopeful that today would be able to strike off wrap up a number of these projects that we've been working for a long time. I was telling drew, I wish there would be a way to convey how much work went into these like I tend to say, I mean, the end goal is to have a report that matches the balance sheet numbers like that matches, that's easy. How many hours and hours and hours went into getting where we're at?

Speaker 3  06:12
I can well, not hours on the phone, hours we spent on development, on pretty easily. Joe has thrown.

Unknown Speaker  06:23
Seth, we can, maybe it's on our side. We can 15

Speaker 4  06:32
No, the only hour earlier, No, Mike was turned down or something. When you're Dwayne, fine,

Unknown Speaker  06:38
you have to talk louder. Seth, yeah.

Speaker 3  06:45
Here we go. Is that better? Yeah, it decided that it wanted to use my laptops mic instead of my headsets, Mike, that's two inches from my mouth. I don't know why, so we switched that. We're good. Oh, I was saying, I could pretty easily tell you how much time we've spent on development on these projects. I can't track Matthias time or time on phone calls as easily. Sure that would be interesting to see. Just tell me which incidents you're curious about, then I could track it down.

Speaker 2  07:16
I know two. One is customer on deposits.

Speaker 5  07:21
Those are an AR

Speaker 2  07:35
good, so I think we've got the next two meetings. Well, we did confirm those, so no use to look at that. I suggest you just go to the that if you guys go find

Speaker 6  07:58
it sure you necessarily due to Bruce Bush, right? I'm not sure.

Speaker 2  08:12
I think if you add Nick to it, maybe Sean will have and then I saw do this all the time. Otherwise,

Speaker 4  08:38
I had a big disappointment the other day, I went and clicked something to save my favorites, and I said, you cannot save any more favorites. That's funny. That's was just trying to mess with me, or something like, let's put a limit on him.

Matthias Miller  08:57
That's hilarious. That's probably, it's probably a sign. That's probably a sign from the Lord.

Speaker 2  09:06
Well, I figured you're gonna say you, you tried to open one in your favorites, and it said, Oh, this has been archived. Oh, I had two of those, which I think Seth got tired of waiting on us to standardize and force you didn't hear back from us. So it's very easy to restore, but

Speaker 4  09:29
yeah, we'll slowly go restore everything you archived,

Speaker 2  09:34
standardize it. But anyway, so the first, the first unprioritized, is some we that Nick Miller, and that's one that we looked at when he was here. I think him and Seth have a plan on that, so I don't think we need to look at that. The only thing is just a priority on it. But I.

Unknown Speaker  10:01
Yes, correct.

Speaker 2  10:03
So, yeah, that's waiting on us. So if we go to the let's start with the production per man hour. Well, that's a nick thing as well. No, we don't, let's, let's look at the next on the dashboard for account balance audits. You date.

Speaker 2  10:26
If Seth is on up, I think he had, he's

Matthias Miller  10:30
zoom crashed, and so he's he's waiting, trying to get back on.

Unknown Speaker  10:42
Let's blame cloud fair.

Unknown Speaker  10:51
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:01
I sent Nick and Seth an email on this.

Unknown Speaker  11:09
Yeah, but the Nettie sent in

Matthias Miller  11:15
desert Dow, yellow, what questions you have on the

Speaker 2  11:22
dashboard? So, Seth, did you see my get a chance to look at my email this morning. I should

Unknown Speaker  11:27
have been not much.

Speaker 2  11:29
Let's just Final Four of an at 1.2 I think this is pretty much done. Well, let's just take a quick look at

Unknown Speaker  11:41
I didn't find

Speaker 2  11:45
which email it was in 10439 6435, and a half. So Seth, I believe the only things remaining here are according to your notes you're wanting to do to narrow

Speaker 2  12:12
the understanding correctly that you want the balance sheet to filter down to just the one account. Yes. Okay, so that's one thing which

Speaker 3  12:25
I think Nick is. Nick was just making that change, and that'll take an update.

Unknown Speaker  12:33
Oh, the the field ring will take an update. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  12:39
okay, then the other change, oh, it was one of the reports that

Speaker 2  12:46
they use your Yeah, I don't think we need to. I think it's just a few small changes, and we can communicate, if need be, if something but I think I tried making some changes using what I learned when Nick was here, and some of it kind of worked, but yeah, sure it's not professional, but yeah, good. I think that's there's really nothing more on this. So fix AR report, let's say drew added a note way down at the bottom on this one yet, one customer

Speaker 2  13:35
deposits. Why is the refund, the customer deposits instead of,

Matthias Miller  13:43
er, I would expect the cancelation. I mean, if it's I would expect the cancelation would have reverted. It did the refund happen after cancelation?

Speaker 4  13:54
No, so on the same day as invoicing, the refund payment is on the same day as cancelation. And if you look at the transactions, we change the last one, there is customer deposits, and it should be going back, okay.

Matthias Miller  14:14
I mean, that's just a boundary issue Seth, we can get our heads together.

Speaker 4  14:22
I see else too, but it was like, yeah, very exact same situation, same same day, cancelations and stuff like that.

Matthias Miller  14:34
I mean, it comes down fundamentally to the question of, Do you invoice at the beginning of the day or end of day? Or do you it's cancelation effectively, and same with cancelation So, and I think we can, I think, I think it'd be good to chase why this wasn't on the errors report. Perhaps something broke with that.

Speaker 4  14:55
Okay, so you know you're saying that the highlighted note is. Or the second,

Matthias Miller  15:02
no, yeah, the highlight of the mule rent for mule line like that should have, that should have been on the earnest report. Okay, I think both of these are things that

Speaker 2  15:15
okay, so you're gonna, you're gonna look why it wasn't on the errors report, and also change the the logic on that same same day, cancelation, refill, yep, does that okay with that, change this. We're expecting this to complete the AR

Matthias Miller  15:39
report, just like the last three times. Yes,

Speaker 2  15:46
well, I'm more hopeful than I was with the other that's fair, okay, right? Optimist, I'm really optimistic today because we're Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:57
is there any can we?

Matthias Miller  15:59
Can we basically put this whole thing into history, except for these bottom lines.

Speaker 4  16:05
Yeah, as far as I know, I mean, what I don't know, probably from my note on 1118, from there down, all has to go with that last thing there, yeah, no sales tax.

Matthias Miller  16:19
Well, this one has nothing to chase, right?

Speaker 4  16:23
I think it's, I think it's the next one. Is the one that you're commenting,

Unknown Speaker  16:27
yeah, like, comment is

Unknown Speaker  16:28
where you have to chase it.

Speaker 7  16:30
Yeah, yep. Let's, let's simplify.

Unknown Speaker  16:36
Took about a month to make that big, long string.

Unknown Speaker  16:41
I think, look at all my work.

Unknown Speaker  16:42
That's progress.

Matthias Miller  16:44
It's progress. 10, 1016, hey, look at that.

Speaker 3  16:48
Oh no, just barely a month. That's a lot of things in one month.

Matthias Miller  16:53
That is a lot of things. All right, good, good.

Speaker 2  16:59
So undeposited funds. I think we're okay so Nick, we believe where we're at with this right now is Drew, and I need to now just work through this and figure out what remaining discrepancies there are. Nick excluded all those stripe payments, pre one, 124, and now we need to figure out we're still, I did a quick check for affordable. We're all like 80,000 but, and it varies some, but without any, it's we'll just have to work, yeah,

Speaker 4  17:42
figure out what's going on. It's that variance from 80,000 that we need to figure out, not necessarily the 80,000 itself. Yeah,

Speaker 2  17:49
that's not as big a deal as why does it vary from one time to the other?

Matthias Miller  17:55
One thing to note with this, no, that's undeposit funds. Never mind. Yep. Exactly makes sense.

Speaker 2  18:01
I mean, the will we run into issues with the stripe payments? So Josh took some took that update live over the weekend on on link stripe with that way in here, like I think it was he set up an Advent schedule on strike, payouts to to do that, to do that, linking to go back, because the linking is not so well that. I mean, it's, we expect it to be fixed from the 15th forward. But do we expect that to create issues in history?

Matthias Miller  18:40
He, did a certain amount of history in his cleanup.

Unknown Speaker  18:45
Do you know how far back he went? That if you have any an easy way to see it might

Matthias Miller  18:51
be helpful. I mean, we hadn't seen, I would suspect it had something to do with the 2024, date, because that's when we stopped seeing, seeing those issues.

Speaker 4  19:05
So, so you're saying the ones that were excluded, like actually ended at 24 at the end of 24 it's not that, it's not that, we're just saying, well, we don't care about what happened in 24 it's like, they only were up through 24 and then they quit.

Matthias Miller  19:23
Yeah, the only ones that, the only ones, well, why don't

Unknown Speaker  19:28
we be helpful? The only things that are causing problems are 23 and older.

Speaker 2  19:33
Okay, let's take a quick look at the most recent report we have on that. And just just, I guess, actually, yeah, the one that says, or that Nick, where I, I think he has a link to this report down at the bottom. Yeah, that stripe demons, missing one. Believe that's the one.

Matthias Miller  19:59
So this one. I get this. Got it? Yeah, these are all 2023 to 2021

Speaker 2  20:04
or no, I'm sorry that's that's not the I think Nick's into Nick's personal folder.

Unknown Speaker  20:21
I should speed key, because

Matthias Miller  20:26
they make these things for

Speaker 2  20:28
Mark, I think it's in the format folder and then undeposited. No, yeah, okay, it's undeposited funds. Ignore stripe payments or something like that. You want to search for

Speaker 3  20:42
that, Oh, that one's in your that's in the IFR folder, and it will be deleted on Monday, because the standard report will happen.

Matthias Miller  20:56
Ignoring old okay, but which

Speaker 2  21:00
don't use that one. Go. Don't use the one I go up to the this guy, yeah, this is reminds me that whack a mole, sorry. Template version 1.4

Matthias Miller  21:16
you guys may have been a conscious or unconscious inspiration, but not just kidding.

Speaker 2  21:22
Oh, so So set the the as off date to but to the day or yes, yeah, today is, yeah, good. And then just make a compliment, whatever, probably ABC. Here's where we'll be spending most of our time today. And I just want to make sure that we're I think it, I just think it has So Drew. Here's what we're showing now, 99,000

Unknown Speaker  21:59
and this will be everything since 23

Speaker 2  22:03
I mean, like, yeah, the cut off date is 1231, 23 I believe so, anything beyond that. And you know, just looking at this, there's, we have no payments older than 1111, which is really reasoned now, how do the the isolated? There's a prompt on here, or an as prompt where we can also show, yeah, those. How do those?

Matthias Miller  22:35
I don't think it matters anymore. I think it was,

Unknown Speaker  22:43
wasn't that what Josh fixed?

Matthias Miller  22:46
Yeah, I think it was a worker for Josh's stuff. I would like to take. Is it on the live report

Unknown Speaker  22:54
or the standard?

Matthias Miller  22:56
Should we not just take that?

Speaker 2  22:59
Okay, but now we're the amount changed to 71,000 Okay, that's you're saying the 99,000 that we had originally,

Unknown Speaker  23:09
that's what we should be seeing these.

Speaker 3  23:11
That's what it should know there are, there's some pretty big negative payments in 24 that are isolated, apparently. Yeah,

Speaker 2  23:24
like that, that first one, that negative, 16,000 do we need to think about that on where

Matthias Miller  23:33
doing our I don't know. I don't know why. I mean, these are all just refunds. I

Speaker 4  23:43
um, well, what does isolated mean? I don't think.

Unknown Speaker  23:51
I don't necessarily means

Unknown Speaker  23:53
just no leak, or does it,

Matthias Miller  24:00
or is isolated. It's a credit card payment that doesn't isn't linked out to stripe at all,

Matthias Miller  24:13
and it only searches

Unknown Speaker  24:14
necessarily mean that it's not accounting Correct.

Matthias Miller  24:21
Yeah, but I mean, your books are going to be wrong because you don't get the full amount back,

Unknown Speaker  24:28
oh, because of fee, right?

Unknown Speaker  24:31
Yeah, yeah, there could be that

Unknown Speaker  24:35
difference.

Matthias Miller  24:36
So refunds basically aren't getting, or, I don't know if there's, if it's any sum or all, but we're seeing refunds not getting tied out.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
It's probably refunds that aren't on the same day as like, if they come in within a payout, then they're not being correct. Don't get them.

Speaker 4  25:00
So I don't know back that refunds get charged a stripe fee like so if we refund money and we send money back to them, we have to pay a stripe fee. But I'm not seeing it on actual cash, so I'm not sure where it's coming from. So it might be part of this.

Unknown Speaker  25:17
Well, if it,

Matthias Miller  25:22
if, was just an author, I don't know, okay, like, if you go on this guy, theoretically, he we have a stripe payout. That's the weird sending us to a stripe payout. Wait a minute. Yeah, that's not straight, right? Stripe payout blank transaction ID that it's linking out to, Seth, we should, we should hide the payout link. If the stripe ID is blank,

Speaker 4  26:01
the are these two different things? Or why are we paying out to two different companies,

Matthias Miller  26:07
banks? It's bogus. Forget the other one. It's a bug. So here we have a payout on three, 424, for 16,000 but then if we go to three four for Ohio, so let's go to stripe payouts, Ohio, go back to three Four. This maybe, here's the reversal, 16 523, 6616, 520, 16, 523, see we have but it's not linked out. The refund never got linked out to this guy, but we did get the full amount back.

Matthias Miller  26:58
Hang on, right? Is this the same?

Matthias Miller  27:07
Somehow, that guy is linking. Wait a minute. I'm confused. This guy is linking to the so ID,

Unknown Speaker  27:18
Oh, Okay.

Matthias Miller  27:26
We have a payment ID.

Unknown Speaker  27:36
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  27:51
No.

Matthias Miller  28:00
Two Three, that one does not have one, two and three, but the payment ID is this guy, which is why we're getting Yes. Well, I

Matthias Miller  28:36
the reason why these are tying out in accounting is that there's a separate entry for

Unknown Speaker  28:44
No, it's not because it makes yet

Speaker 4  28:53
the stripe payout has its own push to accounting. So even though the two aren't linked, they can still be happening, right?

Matthias Miller  29:08
Well, the fees recorded separately, so that's where the fees hitting, hitting your account. He's still lost. He still spent four $80 on this because

Unknown Speaker  29:18
of the refund. Right?

Matthias Miller  29:22
The I think the short answer is that Josh's logic isn't tying out refunds.

Speaker 2  29:31
So will that that'll create issues for us when we try to audit this right? Like we're,

Matthias Miller  29:40
well, I'm not completely sure,

Unknown Speaker  29:42
not, as the dates are the same.

Matthias Miller  29:45
Yes, it will be. It will create an issue. Check out. Check out. What the Let's take a look at the at the 311, three, four. No, maybe it won't. It goes into a deposit

Speaker 4  29:58
or the payouts dated as I. You know, if the refund is dated as 310, or 312 then it'll then, right, that's

Matthias Miller  30:08
right, because we're going to be using the wrong Yeah. Okay, well, Josh, happy birthday.

Unknown Speaker  30:34
Okay, there you go.

Speaker 2  30:35
Would you hold off on trying to audit this until refunds are tied out or no? Well,

Matthias Miller  30:48
you're gonna have a lot less of them. That's good news. I don't mean.

Speaker 2  30:53
Will it change? Okay, so go to the balance, or maybe you can open the balance, like, what's the balance? The Trial Balance showing as of 1119 for for undeposited funds.

Matthias Miller  31:13
Let's go take these guys out, because these are actually relevant

Unknown Speaker  31:18
undeposited funds. I mean, we have a

Unknown Speaker  31:21
so 1000 and on the report, we're showing, what was it?

Matthias Miller  31:27
99,000 Yeah, something like that. So the

Speaker 2  31:31
99 that's what you would use to, I mean, in a perfect Well, hopefully we'll look at a number of days in history and this, yeah, just what you're doing there. And this, it'll be consistent, and if so, we can just journal that difference to a correction on one on one.

Matthias Miller  31:55
But Well, the real question is, where's this wild swing coming from? Well, I know that's a big swing.

Speaker 4  32:06
Well, I think it would be worth a little bit of time to just see if the discrepancies that we do find are from refunds, or if they, you know, the first couple we pull up or refunds, then we stop and wait for that to handle.

Matthias Miller  32:25
You still have you have 70k right here. Why did I do six six? I don't know, because six, six is easy to type anyway. I mean, I think you're right. I think the discrepancy is far beyond again, 17,000 discrepancy is far be well,

Unknown Speaker  32:46
I don't know, maybe not.

Speaker 2  32:48
But worse, no, okay, we believe the accounting. Well, no, if we now say the report is great, then that means, like, what's the other side of of his account. It's all like we're showing way, like undeposited funds as much too high. So

Speaker 4  33:13
did the Josh's fix adjust dates when he did the linking, like, that's what it's supposed to be doing. Yeah, sounds good. You had left me a voicemail about something that, because

Matthias Miller  33:26
that's a good question, because did that actually hit accounting impact,

Speaker 4  33:32
like undeposited funds is an extremely short term asset? Yeah, the 100, the $200,000 that are on deposit funds today are not the same 2000 or three days, you know, right? So if we're off by one day, we can be way off.

Matthias Miller  33:53
That makes sense. Okay, so in in this report, we are using the payout date is the deposit date. So, I mean, I think fundamental, the fundamental issue probably is,

Unknown Speaker  34:14
well, wait,

Speaker 2  34:16
no, the deposit No, is,

Speaker 4  34:22
yeah, the payout date is the deposit date for accounting, but isn't the deposit for he'll reach out to you

Matthias Miller  34:32
pay out arrival date. I mean, we're using to pay out arrival date here, yeah, not for refunds or other stuff. I Hey. So in theory, yes.

Speaker 2  34:47
So we're using on, on the sales order in the payment RT, the payment date is what we're using Hey, to put it on this import like, if it says yes, and then it's coming off when it's. As of today, as deposit correct.

Matthias Miller  35:08
If the deposit Well, hang on, it's Yeah. If the payment is deposited after the as of

Speaker 7  35:16
it's deposited, good. If it's deposited,

Matthias Miller  35:27
if we have a known deposit date after today, then it's on the report. If the payment method doesn't allow deposit, it's off. If strike payments are based on the stripe, payout arrival date, if, wait, this is not correct.

Unknown Speaker  35:45
Is this correct? If, why?

Unknown Speaker  35:50
Yeah, was before or equal,

Matthias Miller  35:56
okay, include, shouldn't this be great? Oh, and not okay, that's correct,

Unknown Speaker  36:04
yes, because

Speaker 4  36:07
so that means after today. Yeah, it means after Yep. I was taught in school not to use so many negatives in one sentence.

Matthias Miller  36:19
Yeah, the teacher once said that, you know, double negatives, never, never. And then talking maybe the comment about double positives, and the smart students said, yeah, right.

Unknown Speaker  36:38
So yeah, I mean, we're

Matthias Miller  36:41
actually ridiculously actually ridiculously close to the fairly big discrepancy here, but we should be Anyway, don't, don't get my curiosity on a problem.

Unknown Speaker  36:56
Just use the trial balance report that

Matthias Miller  36:59
that's that would make sense. All right, so,

Speaker 2  37:06
no, this is right. Where do I find it that's in the

Speaker 3  37:14
no for Mark folder.

Matthias Miller  37:17
Look at that. Go Nick being organized. Trial, balance dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  37:21
Now hang on. This is which

Speaker 4  37:24
one is it true? Well, do that one or the mark one down two. I forget which one is working currently.

Speaker 2  37:31
I think it's the mark one. I think.

Matthias Miller  37:35
Okay, so we're going to do this is undeposited funds, and we're going to do 31323334350,

Speaker 2  37:46
hang on here. We want to do it the other way, right? Judy, yeah, okay, this is not the report. There's, there's two things wrong here. You want the Yeah, the report, the Tony, if I've lapped up the Yeah, that one. I believe it's that

Unknown Speaker  38:04
one. The Mark someone here just open

Matthias Miller  38:06
it is, that is the one. This is

Unknown Speaker  38:08
the one. Okay, well, then open the other one, because one of them

Unknown Speaker  38:12
does that. This one, ABC.

Speaker 4  38:17
Now go upside down with your dates. So, oh, latest date, three

Matthias Miller  38:21
sticks. 35343231,

Speaker 2  38:29
the trial balance will always put them in in this order, but this way the report matches the report. Total collapse. Now this shows, yeah, the reason I didn't show it wasn't working quite right, and so I didn't know how to make it just show totals only. So that's why we have to look at the list

Matthias Miller  38:53
here. So wait a minute, I thought I was, I was closer in the ballpark. So let's do like, 312, 21, 214, 221, 115

Unknown Speaker  39:19
so here we have

Matthias Miller  39:26
anyway. I think I should let you guys chase it. I'm not close enough. I like your proposal. I was hoping. I was hoping we were this close to finding it, and I think I lost myself in the conversation.

Unknown Speaker  39:40
I was hoping you would show me a trick that I don't know.

Speaker 2  39:45
We were hoping for a 10 Minute, like 10 minute fix to this, this audit. So don't

Matthias Miller  39:53
we, don't we all good.

Speaker 2  39:59
So. So customer deposits report, I believe that the only thing there is changing the name and location on the same report. I think everything else on that is, is, is that correct? Come

Unknown Speaker  40:12
through with the next update?

Speaker 2  40:13
Yeah, I think so perfect. Um, the Create import, yeah, I saw you started. You have some notes on that? Is that just questions for Matthias, or is that

Speaker 3  40:37
I had talked with him? I should have updated the incident. Sean is working on getting the these simple records in place, and then he'll so we're starting to make a bit of progress on here, but it won't be ready to be used for a bit.

Speaker 2  40:54
Okay, when you say a bit, you're thinking, the reason I'm asking is we usually do this fifth or sixth the following month. So, buddy, would you expect it for December? 5? Secret? Well, okay, I guess even if it is, it'll it'll require, probably, if that's the, probably the earliest we would use it if it's done, because if it's done, great, if not, we'll keep doing

Unknown Speaker  41:24
with Thanksgiving next week. I

Unknown Speaker  41:25
doubt it okay, but

Speaker 4  41:27
if it's if it's done anytime in their month, it'd be a great excuse for Aaron to get the payroll entered and try it out. So it'll be,

Unknown Speaker  41:34
oh, yeah, you're doing great. Yes,

Speaker 2  41:41
we'll be very happy when this this works, and we don't have wonky, somewhat disconnected spreadsheets.

Unknown Speaker  41:47
Which version is that?

Unknown Speaker  41:51
We only have one version of that. It's great.

Speaker 3  42:00
So are we leaving the include isolated credit card payments for now, I will positive funds report. Well, for sure, we knew kit,

Matthias Miller  42:12
that's great question and deposit. I mean, I don't, I don't feel like it adds meaningful numbers to the report. But why? I guess one of the questions would be, why does, why do those refunds not show up on

Speaker 4  42:32
Yeah, well, if you take it out, when are you? Would that be this weekend? Yeah.

Speaker 3  42:39
I mean, if we shouldn't, then we can wait, but that's what I was thinking.

Speaker 4  42:43
So if we would look at it, if I'd be able to work on that, say tomorrow, it has meaningful information in it, I can just holler and say, Hey, don't kick it out.

Unknown Speaker  42:57
Or, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  43:05
I mean, here, let's update this report a little bit. I mean, this is, this is expanded to all credit card rows that,

Matthias Miller  43:20
well, yeah, to all credit card rows that. So there is this weird one here on the 15th where we have a credit card that never got stripe leftovers.

Speaker 2  43:38
That's interesting. Oh, there's applying the extra from taxes for this problem

Matthias Miller  43:52
does make you wonder if that's the right way to handle it. But anyway. But yeah, you can see here refunds. Here's another one where somebody put a credit card

Unknown Speaker  44:07
in. Oh, there's no fee. Well, that one's

Matthias Miller  44:19
more minor adjustments anyway. I mean, I'm, yeah, I'm not opposed to keeping that checkbox in there. I just, I'm not sure that it's

Speaker 2  44:27
Well, I think it may prove helpful for auditing. And then, yeah, so are you thinking to leave it there? I mean, Tuesday, ignore it if, yeah,

Speaker 6  44:41
just just in the case, and like all the favorites and you

Speaker 3  44:49
know, then non standard reports in the folders sounds like a classic vestigial organ. Leave it there just in case. You.

Matthias Miller  45:02
All right on the NACHA stuff, Seth and I, and my proposal is that we start storing when we export it and when we upload it on the NACHA file, and use that to push to accounting, and then use that to also update vendor invoices after you upload. And presumably the upload date would be the effective date that we would well, I guess that's true. We did find some instances where notch files were up were marked uploaded about anywhere from a few days to a few months after it was exported.

Unknown Speaker  45:42
So I don't know when.

Speaker 4  45:45
I'm guessing that is simply because of missing to click the box. I'm sure they were not uploaded month later.

Unknown Speaker  45:55
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  46:01
So do you want to mark them? So which date do we want to use? So we could, we can use either date, or we can say when you mark upload that we'll ask you what date it was,

Speaker 4  46:11
oh, and then just have it default to the at that day

Matthias Miller  46:16
today. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 4  46:20
yeah, that would work. Yeah. I think that would work best. Give it, give the option to say, Oh, actually, this was uploaded last week. Could this be easements to

Speaker 2  46:33
why we have that big, like 100,000 discrepancy on that one day and AP, four or four that would have looked at me,

Speaker 4  46:41
yeah, yeah. It's, it's, I mean, one day it's like, you know, it can be our big the notch file was, if it's a huge amount, it's only there for one day, it's, it's this,

Speaker 2  46:54
and this, this will fix it if, if he uses new feature correctly, like, default today, that's pretty much always the case. Some rare like, what would be situation where it's not so late in the day depending on the bank?

Speaker 4  47:09
No, it's not, no. So practically, it was doing this for every single one because the defender invoice payment record says the day that you created it and and the notch file posts to accounting on the effective day, which is the next day. So we were, we were making that discrepancy every single time it ran the notch file. Mm, hmm. And this is making the the payment day be the day that you created, right?

Unknown Speaker  47:46
You upload it to the bank, or is,

Matthias Miller  47:47
yeah, yeah, the date is upload,

Speaker 2  47:51
or taking the upload day as the day that you write the check or make the thing,

Unknown Speaker  47:58
right? Yeah, right. Okay.

Speaker 2  48:04
And this will change accounting, but not the report, right?

Unknown Speaker  48:12
Well, this will,

Unknown Speaker  48:13
would it fix anything historically,

Matthias Miller  48:18
and we can, we can run, we would probably run a historical update to sync vendor invoices with notch of files, okay?

Speaker 2  48:25
And it might shift the payment date on them by a day. Yeah, yeah. Accounting, it

Unknown Speaker  48:32
doesn't change the report.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
Well, it would, if you change

Speaker 4  48:36
well, I mean, it'll change the value of the report, but, but the report will continue to do what it has been doing, right,

Speaker 2  48:46
correct, but, but accounting, the accounting transactions, nothing would think it's there, right

Unknown Speaker  48:54
for most cases, yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:56
oh, okay. There are some situations on accounting where you're, well, your notcha file currently we're using, we're using the date that it's anticipated to arrive, and so we're going to use the date of upload. So that further adds the discrepancy. I mean, that's one more, okay,

Speaker 2  49:19
yeah, wow. Had we known all these things when we said, Let's do accounting and assist we probably would have, I think, just similar with journeys in life.

Matthias Miller  49:32
Yeah, would you, would you have gotten married and had a family if you would have done everything?

Speaker 2  49:40
Maybe, well, I think God's Well, we know his timing is perfect. But have you ever thought like, how many people would get married if you wouldn't marry it till you're maybe 70 or 65 or whatever? Like, think how backwards that would be like when you're young and flexible and full of optimism and. Or G Yeah, or having children at 50, or Dwayne. Can you imagine being up at night with newborns?

Unknown Speaker  50:11
No way, no how.

Matthias Miller  50:13
You don't even have to wait until 70 for these things to start. Get set in your ways and all this stuff.

Speaker 4  50:23
Well, I think this is also the, this is, I've always wondered, like, when people try to do their own accounting programming, a lot of projects get abandoned because they just, they run up against walls. And I wonder, well, what are those things? And I think this kind of stuff that we're dealing with is, is a lot of that, like, seemingly endless. Oh, this doesn't work. Oh, now that. Oh, how do we fix this? Like, just the

Speaker 2  50:51
easy, like, the 95% that's piece of cake. But, like, when you get into stuff like this, it's just,

Unknown Speaker  51:02
it is It? Is. It's true.

Matthias Miller  51:05
How much of this just gets how much of this is because you're going off and doing your own thing, instead of using sage or NetSuite or QuickBooks Enterprise or something else, and how much is just because those systems let you you just kind of wave your hands and hope everything's okay, and you don't actually have the capacity to drill down into the details. Yeah, it's, I was, I've got a client. I've got a pallet manufacturer who's who's running on stage, and got to whip up a report from him out of his accounting system this morning, because, well, Sage won't tell you this information, but we can sure get it for you. So there, there's a the report of the depth of reporting that you guys have access to is quite spectacular.

Speaker 2  51:58
Well, it is like modification history, accounting, transactions on, on most of the records, and just, yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:11
well, in most of, most of even in this scenario, we're running into issues because, I mean, there are just certain reports we're not able to get very well. And most of the accounting reports are based on when it posts, which means that there's a, you know, whatever, you approve your vendor invoice to post accounting, your invoice to post to accounting, that's when it hits accounting, which means that if you run accounting reports, it's a few days off from your your invoicing reports anyway, it's it's just some of this is maybe fix with with more software expertise on the on the other side of the fence, but it's just it, is it when you actually start falling down the accounting rabbit hole, there's A lot of complexities, including sales tax rounding.

Speaker 2  53:07
Good. So the next one is, oh,

Matthias Miller  53:11
by the way, you'll, you'll, will you put a priority on this? Or is

Unknown Speaker  53:18
there a priority on this? Okay, so, so that's

Matthias Miller  53:24
that's fixing notch invented voices

Unknown Speaker  53:27
there is a priority. But,

Speaker 4  53:33
I mean, it's very easy to spot when that's the problem in AP, if it doesn't match up. So I'm not, I'm not really concerned about it. I mean, when we're talking about balancing the reconciling the balance sheet, there's a lot other stuff that is more important. I mean, that's, that's we can be reconciled. It's just a couple dates and be way off, and we'll know what it is and don't need to worry about it.

Unknown Speaker  54:03
Well, we'll add a priority to it, just perfect

Unknown Speaker  54:08
little portal. Why is this here?

Unknown Speaker  54:10
Or who's it assigned to? Is

Unknown Speaker  54:13
this Dwayne?

Speaker 2  54:18
I don't think we need to look at this now. Okay, good. The next one, have you created that that report, or that's, that's where this is waiting for a eight answered person to go, click, click, click, right?

Matthias Miller  54:40
Okay, that's something that can be

Unknown Speaker  54:44
do you have the report?

Matthias Miller  54:46
No, not yet. We've been chasing other discrepancies first. Yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  54:49
but this have any impact on our audit? It would right. This will, yeah,

Speaker 4  55:01
it could mean that our initial entries are all long term,

Speaker 2  55:07
okay, but most of these are just one cent or so, right? Well, we don't know.

Matthias Miller  55:14
We don't think for these in particular, that these themselves don't, but right, you might have a few that are problematic, that are buried in there that you can't spot because of them, correct, correct.

Speaker 4  55:28
So that's why we're having mega reports that somebody just

Speaker 2  55:33
clicked blindly. Why? So true, doing, reconciling. Okay, this is mainly what affecting AR custom deposits.

Matthias Miller  55:44
So, FGI, FGI, mostly, yeah,

Speaker 2  55:50
but are we okay to make? Is your thought? We can make the adjusting journal entry on one, 125, before we have this keep going. And then once we do this, then we may have to go back and discuss that like none of this will fix things in 25 or change numbers, right? Okay, it shouldn't. Okay.

Speaker 4  56:11
Um, good point. The idea is we're still checking to see if our balance sheet reports are working, you know, correctly. We can fix stuff in 25 we can do all that stuff before this is the only this is going to change, possibly, is that initial journal entry. So if we know that everything's working, and we come up with a current number that's suddenly off, as soon as we go through the rest of those mismatches, then we just go back and change our journal, perfect.

Speaker 2  56:44
So, okay, we also had another one where there was like 12 of those sales orders on sales tax stuff. I think, yeah, I did, yeah, we're going to expand it. You corrected those. Okay. So nothing to do,

Matthias Miller  57:02
but, but isn't there? Weren't there, aren't there? Potentially other. It's not just buildings. There was another thing that we changed that could have,

Speaker 2  57:11
yeah, it was sales. There were 12 sales orders that had one cent discrepancies, okay, because of sales tax rounding, right? Or bad debt drew saying all of those.

Speaker 4  57:23
Well, I don't know that there were 12 that were one cent, but there were a bunch that were one cent, and there were probably about 12 total, but they were not all one cent, but maybe, maybe I was looking at the wrong thing. Well, let's I just what I did is I went, I selected just sales orders in the mismatch report, and I cleaned everything up. So sure, not hitting mismatch report, then there might still be an issue.

Speaker 2  57:48
Well, this is if this is no longer on the or I wonder if it's a closed project. I think it is. I think you had it noted on that incident with us, the sales tax rounding one. Yeah. I, maybe I

Matthias Miller  58:08
don't know, Seth and I, when we do this, we'll keep our eyes open. I'm still, I'm still thinking there's something in the back of my head that there's some other thing that we were expecting to show up like crazy on here. We'll keep our eye open for it and

Unknown Speaker  58:22
handle it, if, if it makes sense that,

Speaker 2  58:25
I mean, that's just a project. The next one, nothing to do. Cash Flow, is that, I think he started on Matthias, and if Drew, answered or responded, he went, I didn't do anything with it.

Unknown Speaker  58:40
So, well done. From there, we probably should go through this.

Speaker 2  58:49
And I guess Matthias is there things you want to you want to go through this, and now or should? Would You Rather we just look at it your questions or comments and get back to you?

Matthias Miller  59:05
I don't care. I'm I've the clocks. I mean, if we're looking to get this by the end of the year, the clock's ticking, and I've basically been waiting for you guys for the last 10 days, nine days week. It feels a little longer than what it has been. Um, and I don't, I don't really care. I feel like there's some, there's a greater than zero possibility that we're going to want to get our heads together after you go through it. I do have, I do have some availability. I don't know, I really don't you guys could go through it. We could. We could circle up in a little bit, or we could.

Speaker 2  59:57
I'm fine with that. I mean, I only that in your quarter. You think it's helpful to discuss it in discuss it now we can if you think it's more helpful for us to go through and follow up with questions or comments, then we

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
I think okay, this one just requires you guys to make sure you agree with reversing reversing operations for credits to accumulated depreciation, even when we're debiting the FDI assets, which is what the with the prior reports behavior was, and That's how Joel left it. That's probably something to wrap your heads around. I I do disagree a bit with our I think we're using account subtype to to categorize things on the income statement. I think that's wrong. Generally. I think account subtype should be used to define what the type and role of the account is, and if we need to categorize it differently on the income statement, we should use a different field for that.

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
So that might be something to talk through.

Speaker 2  1:01:21
Yeah, when you say, Do you believe it should use the, okay, the account subtype. Those are like the parent, no,

Speaker 6  1:01:34
there's like codes, administrative expenses.

Matthias Miller  1:01:40
I mean, as an example, accumulated depreciation has a subtype of fixed asset, not accumulated depreciation, because that's how we wanted to show up on the income statement.

Speaker 2  1:01:54
And your proposal is that we add more subtypes, and then those defined what?

Matthias Miller  1:02:04
Well, it's not more we already have that. It just allows us to properly classify what it actually is. I mean, this is accumulated depreciation. It's not a fixed asset,

Speaker 2  1:02:14
but, but right now drew you set all of these up, but it's right now. It's basically used as a sorting tool to put them in the right place and defaulting.

Speaker 4  1:02:24
Well, it's defaulting this cash flow category. But can't we go in and change the cash flow category? If we can, like, it's an asset, but we don't want it, you know, as that we can switch it, but you're saying you have a different way to do that

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
we can accept for things like accumulated depreciation and, sorry, I should know the other one. What's the other one that gain or loss in sale of asset, where we need some kind of identification, because it's not as simple as just throwing it on the on the cash flow statement. And so we either can use the account subtype, which we already have, to identify these because that's what it is, or we can add other classification for it. Other ways to say this is this is accumulated depreciation, which currently I believe We are looking at.

Matthias Miller  1:03:40
We are based here.

Matthias Miller  1:04:02
You see using version one. So currently, to determine, to determine whether, whether something is accumulated depreciation, we're needing to look up the asset on the line, look see if it's the accumulated depreciation account for that asset, and make sure that the line items on this, on this transaction only impact accumulated depreciation and depreciation, depreciation expense, which we also get off the asset definition. And so I mean, effectively, we're, we're inferring whether it's depreciation, depreciation based off of whether it's defined on the asset. Now, we had also talked about linking here's where it ties into this other piece we talked about linking, linking depreciation, accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense to an asset class. So we can add. Validation that you're selecting the right accounts when you're setting up an asset. So if we had a way to say this account is accumulated depreciation, it would simplify. It would a simplify the class of, okay, not a must have, but would simplify classification that for the Cash Flow Report, and would also give us a way to say we need to tie it out to an asset class and link these together. It makes more sense to me to say on the chart of accounts that this is the integration of asset classes and and accumulated depreciation and depreciation depreciation expenses, rather than defining it on the on the per asset that we're building.

Speaker 4  1:05:55
So, so what you're saying is we should make its own subtype of accumulated depreciation, and then simply place it in the income statement where we want it to be.

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
That's my proposal. Yes, because we already have on the on the on the chart of accounts, we already have a balance sheet role which is used to override where it gets put on the balance sheet. And my proposal would just be adding an income statement role where we could, we could then control placement on on the income statement, and then the subtype no longer like the subtype literally is what type of, what type of account is this? What type of asset is this? It's not. Where does this go on the income statement?

Speaker 2  1:06:53
So we're okay, we're looking at it, yeah, balance sheet added here, what? What's defining where, where it's placed on the balance sheet.

Matthias Miller  1:07:03
On the balance sheet, it's this plus plus this, I believe.

Speaker 2  1:07:08
So the balance sheet rule. How would we use that? What's in the drop down there? If we let's

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
go see if we have any where you've Well, you have current assets, fixed asset, current equities, long term equity and liabilities. Let's see where we set it.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:22
I Is it just the subtypes?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
Yeah, let's just stick

Matthias Miller  1:07:28
around. Oh, is it just,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:30
I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:34
so if we look at

Matthias Miller  1:07:39
well, let's do this too so we can see the

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
I doubt there's actually been any accounts that we can use.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:56
Long term liabilities. Are we never

Matthias Miller  1:08:06
are we never actually here? Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
I don't think we would utilize it

Matthias Miller  1:08:22
long term okay? I mean, the hyphen in long term liabilities, that's a big difference. So, no, it doesn't look like it's effectively being used. Well, that's a good point.

Speaker 2  1:08:45
So if you go back to the the Chart of Accounts, what you're is, is what you're suggesting

Unknown Speaker  1:09:01
that we, we use the subtypes.

Speaker 2  1:09:12
We do a better job of using the subtypes like we call all, all accumulated depreciation. We that. We call it that, right? I mean, is, are there others that you've seen that that are wrong or not?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
Well, I have not bank accounts

Speaker 2  1:09:29
and okay and, and the reason for that would be, it would help us on the cash flow statement. So

Matthias Miller  1:09:37
like, Well, yeah. I mean, we don't have a way to identify which which current assets are banking or not banking. I mean, that's and

Speaker 2  1:09:44
it won't change any existing things that we're doing well, like it won't. It won't change the balance sheet if we go,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:54
not if we put those balance sheet placement.

Speaker 2  1:09:58
I mean, do you. You see a problem with doing that too? Like, this is just, am I correct that this is, we just didn't do this. We just call everything current assets because they were,

Speaker 4  1:10:10
yeah, for now, there's no place to everything in the right I mean, like, so it's really more of a another level of type, you know, they are all at current assets or current liabilities, like they are that it's just a particular, you know, kind of current asset. So that's fair,

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
but we do need a more particular delineation, because we do need to know what is actually cash. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:10:46
probably the only place that I'm thinking of that it might create hiccups is on some of those reports where we can select, like, we can select some type of accounts to show up, you know? So if we want to administer the expenses, but we never use that, yeah, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
I always go to the exact account.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:08
Yeah, there's maybe two.

Speaker 4  1:11:14
Nah, it's very rare. But okay, then it's usually on the income statement. Now, well, that okay, if you go to the,

Speaker 2  1:11:23
let's say our primary checking, if we switch that from current assets, bank account, and then go to the view account, button or column link, or whatever, Edit Account, will that change our don't we have a that, that long string of,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:48
oh no, it probably will right out at the bottom,

Speaker 2  1:11:51
yeah. Is it? Yeah? Well, that changed that associated GL account. It won't it. No, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
Off. Okay? It just won't. It'll think it

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
just won't match, right, good, well,

Speaker 4  1:12:09
and that should be it. Probably what it actually probably would do, it would be remove the need for the uses reconciliation checkbox there in the middle of it,

Matthias Miller  1:12:20
just to the left there, yep, potentially, although, yeah, potentially, because you just say

Speaker 4  1:12:27
all bank types, you know, use reconciliation, bank, credit card, whatever, and the others do not.

Speaker 2  1:12:35
Is there a good is there a report somewhere that like subtype, where we can say, see what accounts receivable, subtype, yeah, and so can we? Can we make edits? There is that all stuff that's predefined.

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
So some of them are predefined. You can um, you can actually move. That's weird. You should not be able to move that. That's really weird.

Matthias Miller  1:13:13
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't let you do that, um, but the what I'm not sure about, I mean, there's stuff like this. This is where, where stuff gets interesting, where you have I would argue that this should be a separate. Well, maybe it's not. We need it. We need it if we want it showing up as a separate. You

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
it's almost expense with this income statement,

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
it's almost like you want a expense role, right? No, this is how that works, because this hang on, right? So we're saying logistics COGS is, is functioning as a cogs role, although this is more than accounting statement presentation, potentially, it's, it's really what you want to do, I think is from a very high level. Say, I want to create my own version of a cogs role so that I can further sub categorize it,

Speaker 7  1:14:38
balance sheet role is that the same for

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
Yeah?

Speaker 4  1:14:56
Is there? There is no like cogs and. Expense are all treated as expense. As far as, where do they go on the income statement?

Matthias Miller  1:15:07
Well, we do split them out on the on your income statement. We do. We are right. We are split right,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:14
right. But it,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:18
I don't know how to say it.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
Oh, so we can create new subtypes on our own.

Matthias Miller  1:15:24
Um, yeah, you do currently.

Matthias Miller  1:15:33
Okay, so this, this is good news. I didn't realize this, that these guys do specify.

Speaker 2  1:15:42
Oh, we have an expense subtype of depreciation. Like, are we using that one consistently on like, we're using depreciation expenses in a lot of different places, and this on your cash flow. You could use this to add that back onto the in constant

Matthias Miller  1:16:02
amount whatever, yeah, but the six Spence rule doesn't have enough options in it. Spend statement categories. This is all about expense rule is just about the income statement. That's all it's about.

Speaker 6  1:16:17
Yeah? Because we basically have those three buckets on the income statement, right?

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
That makes sense, and then subcategories within that.

Matthias Miller  1:16:41
I mean, I think one of the questions is, do we, do we and should we clean

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
clean this up?

Matthias Miller  1:16:50
Or do we see if we can get to the Cash Flow Report and punt this down the road a little bit this clean up? I

Speaker 2  1:17:06
It seems like okay, part of me would like to just keep this down the road, because it it works for income statements and balance sheets. Just just find the way it is, and adding or making changes there, makes, does make me nervous. However, if we don't, we'll, there'll be more work on the cash flow statement, like we'll have to go, it's more like we need to go to each account individually and said where we wanted to go on the cash flow statement, rather than deriving it off the sub types, right? Is that, am I thinking about that correctly?

Matthias Miller  1:17:47
The biggest thing is that cash flow well, or one of the substantial things is that cash flow ends up being, if we don't clean this up a bit, cash flow is going to end up to be something specialized, specifically to you guys, and additional maintenance outside of that falls in your court. Because from a court for from a court accounting perspective, it's really weird to have a cash flow statement that treats something as a gain or loss and fail about that, or as a as a as accumulated depreciation or depreciation expense, When that's not actually how it's set up the the

Speaker 2  1:18:43
So are you saying, if we do this, if we do the cleanup, then on the cash flow, you can just look at the subtypes,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:54
right? I think, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
Mean, barring anything unforeseen, it it won't take long to change those,

Speaker 2  1:19:09
to make the subtypes correct, and then we'll have to do, possibly do some reorganizing where they appear on the balance sheet or income statement, right by using what is the that other field?

Matthias Miller  1:19:25
So I think we would, I think what we would do is create a new field to override the presentation role on the income statement and balance sheet, and then and use that whenever necessary to avoid messing that up.

Speaker 4  1:19:45
So I'm wondering, can we, if you create the new field, do you have fielding that you can say, Okay, this is where it's at on the income statement. So. Therefore that's where this this new field needs to be XYZ, and then this is what kind of account it is. So therefore the subtype needs to now be XYZ, where you can just take the information that's already there and put it into the right field so that everything works.

Matthias Miller  1:20:20
Yeah. Close. I mean, account accumulated depreciation isn't quite that simple, but we could, we could look at assets and find out what's accumulated depreciation, I mean, but even that's very obvious, looking at the chart of accounts what's accumulated depreciation and what's not but, yeah, yeah, essentially, yes,

Speaker 4  1:20:40
you know, like, I mean, take all the cogs ones. You know, they're just going by the name. We know that all of the ones that are called the subtype need to, that's the rule they need to have on the income statement. So there we plug that in, and we know that they are a cogs account, and so they should be that subtype. Yeah, I'm not, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:20:58
not worried about doing migration to make sure that income statement balance sheet. Balance sheets don't don't change. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
so good.

Speaker 2  1:21:14
So it sounds like we want to do this. So what's the I guess probably the best thing is, if you go ahead and write out the steps that you see is needing to take, Matthias usually bring order to chaos by

Matthias Miller  1:21:29
by doing that. Yeah, I think, I think it's a good next step. I think fine tuning more, getting better definition, for sure, how, how this role actually needs to work. I think it's, I think it's probably as simple as adding a new field that gets, gets used appropriately, and and then, and then, just take it from there the

Speaker 2  1:22:04
so are we on the cash flows? There's typically three sections on a cash flow. I believe there's,

Speaker 6  1:22:14
do we? Yeah, I think we have those three

Matthias Miller  1:22:19
operations, financing and investing, yeah, I think this is the new one. I mean this is this is here. Here it is as it stands now. I

Matthias Miller  1:23:00
I know one of the one of the questions had been around, and maybe this requires you guys to talk to but this is one of the leftover pieces too

Unknown Speaker  1:23:14
for you guys to discuss

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
or talk about. How

Matthias Miller  1:23:26
it's these equity related owner capital payouts and things like that. Make sure we handle those correctly.

Speaker 2  1:23:34
I know we initially, we talked about, do we make so they so the cash flows work over the end of a of a year when we do distributions, and is I remember Larry saying that their cash flow statements don't, but if you handle it correctly, it should work just fine. Or at the end, you typically do distributions to owners, or distributions, you move the monies from net income, from current year earnings, to the owner's equity accounts. And that has no Well, it does have a bearing on cash flow statement. It in order to, let's say, you want to do a six, 624, through six, 625, cash flow statement, you'd have to say, Well, what? What are my earnings in 20

Unknown Speaker  1:24:38
for the first half year and then, or for six, 624, plus my earnings through six, 625,

Speaker 2  1:24:49
like is your intent, that it would work over the end of the of the year or not,

Matthias Miller  1:24:56
you guys get to determine scope. It sounds like we were talking about making. At work over the end of the year, but that's your call in which you guys went,

Speaker 2  1:25:05
Well, I think, I think we do want to just because, I mean, that's typically when we

Unknown Speaker  1:25:13
instead, it can be that time of year when we when we're dealing with a cash Crown. So I think we should just make soda for

Unknown Speaker  1:25:44
Okay, so this,

Matthias Miller  1:25:57
how should functionally this report here,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:02
we're running it. Start, 2123111,

Matthias Miller  1:26:10
to one. Okay, so function only here. It here. Let's do this. 1231, 23, or 20 411. So 125,

Matthias Miller  1:26:37
so you have, you would have a So functionally, how would this change? You should have an adjustment to net income.

Speaker 2  1:26:52
No, you're it just moves from current year earnings into capital, right? Are we calling capital? Is that? Call it owner's equity. Capital. Yeah, if you were to look at a cash flow statement

Unknown Speaker  1:27:12
from one, 1.1

Speaker 2  1:27:16
22, weeks, I can see capital. Lower, and current capital would be zero, we know, and currently earnings would be 305,000 right? Isn't that what we expect to see? Wow, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:40
for 20, okay, we have a

Matthias Miller  1:27:45
we have, we have an issue here, probably because of the closing transaction.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:03
Retained earnings,

Speaker 6  1:28:07
well that should be showing change, not where they were.

Speaker 4  1:28:17
What if you make, make your first dates through 1230, 24,

Matthias Miller  1:28:33
well, I guess this doesn't really matter this. Oh,

Speaker 4  1:29:01
hello. In I'm actually thinking too simply, but basically, if there is one of those distribution things there, it creates a negative. I mean, there's, there's no change in cash. We just simply know that we moved this much value from current year earnings to retained earnings, but it doesn't affect our cash, which is correct,

Matthias Miller  1:29:34
but should we even? Is

Unknown Speaker  1:29:39
your question whether we should show it.

Matthias Miller  1:29:41
Do you? I mean, do you want it here?

Speaker 4  1:29:50
I mean, it's cash moved within the company from one financial account to another. If.

Speaker 2  1:30:04
Oh no, I'd have to get my head around better.

Matthias Miller  1:30:10
Well, I think, I think this is, this is a piece that can be in you guys's court to consider. Then the 1231, 24 this guy. Do we ignore do we need it? Can we ignore closing transactions? Or should we be ignoring closing transactions?

Speaker 4  1:30:40
Yeah, that was the, I think that's the one we should be ignoring, because we're just saying, this is a temporary account. We're trying to zero it. Money did not, actually, we didn't get any cash back for all the right?

Matthias Miller  1:31:01
And so if you were ever to do a cash transfer on any closing transaction, which, why would you you're going to get into trouble. But right?

Speaker 4  1:31:10
Because if you do, then you're not going to balance your checking account.

Matthias Miller  1:31:21
Okay? Well, I mean, I think, Okay, two more questions, really quick. I know we're at the top of the hour. Are you going to want to break down the operations, you know, further into admin, sales, marketing, self storage, like you do on the income statement? Or do you just want cash?

Speaker 2  1:31:41
So we would break or we break it down so we've got depreciation. We're adding back on the decreases or the changes in balance sheet accounts for, accounting for, I'll do those. Okay, why do we have those separated decrease, and is it by asset and liabilities? Yeah, oh, okay, you're seeing the net cash from operations, which is net cash from operations.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:09
This is, you know, how these all add up

Speaker 2  1:32:14
the income, the 688, is matches the income statement,

Matthias Miller  1:32:20
yes, currently earning.

Speaker 4  1:32:23
So basically, the the question you're wondering is, like, did the cash change because of admin or because of marketing, like?

Speaker 6  1:32:39
So this is that's like, we don't have separate balance sheet accounts, like they're not balanced.

Matthias Miller  1:32:50
No, you'd have to trace it, which I think makes it a moot point.

Speaker 2  1:33:00
I can't think of why we like, Okay. This is saying, Okay, our operations netted us 2.3 million in cash. The same time we invested, we probably bought a lot of property for 1.5 and we also finance, which, in this case was probably went into our line of credit, I don't know, 630,000 so we're seeing, am I thinking about that correct? But like

Speaker 4  1:33:30
so yeah. I mean, the the admin or expense or so on is involved in the net income number at the top, the cash, net cash from operations, is just, how did we move money in between balance sheet accounts? Yep, yep, makes sense. I think that. So, I mean, it would be an interesting report, but I think

Unknown Speaker  1:33:59
it'd be a different report. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:34:04
Do we want any form or do we don't, and revenue channel doesn't make sense either, because that's Income State related. So I mean, there really is no other breakdown. This is what we're after.

Speaker 4  1:34:14
Yeah, yeah. The only other split outs you could do would be like, Okay, what? You know, credit card liabilities, or, Oh no, like, like, if we wanted to split those further, you know, or what current liabilities were we paying out, all right,

Speaker 2  1:34:31
deep the property, plant and equipment, I think that one like splitting that out, was it real estate? Was it because of how heavy we are? Storage like, would that be difficult to hit?

Matthias Miller  1:34:45
No, that wouldn't. And I think that's you actually have that Configure. You already have that capacity. Because what you would do is in your where is it? Well, what was that pull?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:00
Oh. Seven is for the briefings.

Matthias Miller  1:35:03
So like, here you would, you would just add different casual line descriptions

Unknown Speaker  1:35:11
for each of these.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:13
Yeah, well, then we have to function on the mood.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:16
Good. This will be fun.

Matthias Miller  1:35:21
I so we think, we think retained earnings, we think all of this stuff can be resolved with ignoring closing transactions. Everything else looks good, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:34
Think, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:35:36
and then I mean, you guys obviously can stick your head in there. Yeah. Or

Speaker 2  1:35:49
barely. So are you going to come back with something more on

Unknown Speaker  1:35:56
Chart of Accounts? Or do you have,

Matthias Miller  1:35:59
I think, I think I would have what I need to go do it if, if you want it done, but if you want to, if you want to dig in, and that would then get us pretty close to implementing this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:15
What do you think I mean? Is there a reason not to just go ahead and

Speaker 4  1:36:17
do it? Should we look at it? I think if, if, if you got a good plan on the migration, I would, I would go ahead to do it, because I think there will also be more things that will it will become useful for some

Speaker 2  1:36:33
of our reports that we now have transactions or whatever we could use the subject, they Were more, right? They were used more

Unknown Speaker  1:36:40
well, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:43
You know, if you want a banking report or whatever,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:49
yeah, good, okay, good.

Speaker 2  1:36:55
Okay, sir, anything else we should look at real quick? I know the last one of the highest section that, okay, the split income statements. I think we have a plan on that. I don't know. Is that just, I mean, we're basically just not going to allow. Oh, that's right. So is that showing

Matthias Miller  1:37:20
disallow with lesser levels. Let me just back it out and I can lesser levels.

Speaker 2  1:37:37
We're going to say on a split income statement you can't work as tricky as if you, if you and perfect world, it makes it look so right now it it works because on every account, you say, how do you want this account split income statement, but when you roll them together, like something like, what's an example, maybe that the individual accounts basically look different, yeah? Because if you roll, let's say, sales together, so maybe everything in sales except the sales manager's wage is 100% retail, the sales manager's wage maybe 7% retail. And when you roll that together, it

Unknown Speaker  1:38:20
don't just don't work. Yeah, when we just do this,

Speaker 2  1:38:24
because I asked why I suggested, when I brought this up to just,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:28
yeah, does this level five? Is all that works?

Matthias Miller  1:38:30
Yeah, can we do you care of level five, the detail level? Okay, you know we'll do this move detail level below split by revenue channel,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:47
hide it. If split is checked, make sure it runs on full level.

Speaker 3  1:38:57
The alternative is to hide the split checkbox, if the detail is not set

Matthias Miller  1:39:03
to because the revenue channel diagnostics and the compare with growing well, you also want to do you also want to hide the revenue channel diagnostics and you can have multiple levels of nesting. Got a game, right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:19
similar to not allowing people to have more favorites. Okay? I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:39:28
Seth, are you comfortable delegating this off to somebody? Anything else that we should look at here, the

Speaker 2  1:39:38
mentoring was not posting raw materials at a point as expected. I think Drew and Seth were looking at that. Maybe we should take a quick

Matthias Miller  1:39:48
look, just so the VI had a PO removed in a building. Link to the non PO line

Speaker 2  1:39:57
mean that Matthias, if you have time. And if not, we can, yeah, I do have time.

Matthias Miller  1:40:04
I had a cancelation after this

Unknown Speaker  1:40:14
transaction to accounting Robert

Matthias Miller  1:40:18
po in a building linked to. Okay, so the vendor invoice we expect to post.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:35
I think to fix it I tried to do, yeah, was not effective.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:47
Let's do this. Are these both the same, 56 and 57

Speaker 7  1:40:59
Oh, come on. Really should have an ask prompt on this one. Really 1156,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:49
there and,

Matthias Miller  1:41:56
okay, this non po

Speaker 3  1:42:01
active page. There is something. There's stuff in the underlying RG. Yet I didn't dig into this much trans table.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:23
Right, but this should still have,

Matthias Miller  1:42:34
okay, so it's getting ganked here. We're getting zero amounts. It's summing out to zero. Row.

Speaker 2  1:42:45
Why is it? Oh, why is it linked? It looks like it's where is it linked to?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:52
Link to a building. Is that your question?

Speaker 2  1:42:56
Yeah, okay, and this is because it's a manufactured building that we're buying. Okay? We had one recently that was linked to an asset. I thought that might be issues.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:20
So we have, we

Speaker 7  1:43:26
have a single line item to accounts payable. Why is it not?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:36
Where does the

Matthias Miller  1:43:44
the invoice.po, string table.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:55
This guy,

Matthias Miller  1:44:04
right, that's what it is. Are you seeing it still has a Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 3  1:44:17
Like the RG did that virtual RG runs off.

Matthias Miller  1:44:22
Oh, well, but Okay, but how does it still have something like that on there? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:44:33
So that's why it's not if we were to go bi accounting impact, and if we were to just,

Matthias Miller  1:44:49
yeah, like, suddenly, everything's perfect.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:55
Is there a way to view that? RG

Speaker 3  1:44:58
only? I think. If you turn test environment on, you could

Matthias Miller  1:45:02
probably not a good idea.

Speaker 3  1:45:06
Check the test system. How recent the test system been updated?

Unknown Speaker  1:45:10
Because that's great idea. Look at you. Welcome.

Speaker 3  1:45:19
Hour and a half on this call. Wait what? Who's updating it?

Unknown Speaker  1:45:33
I don't know. Gonna check? Lost their hearts. Check the building, yeah, okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:45:50
sorry, what? What this guy?

Matthias Miller  1:46:00
So we have a single row.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:09
Here's the purchase order for it

Matthias Miller  1:46:14
was Delete. Somebody deleted the purchase order.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:22
Yep. Okay, and let's go look at this one.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:37
No, this guy, the same one. Nope. Giana deleted this one.

Speaker 7  1:46:58
Okay, so let's do let's do this. This will be fun. I

Unknown Speaker  1:47:24
and let's make sure these aren't blanks,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:31
just doing that as an A, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:41
Then,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:49
sorry. Seth, you're putting the IFR folder. Is that your apology?

Unknown Speaker  1:48:00
Yeah, that's my apology.

Speaker 3  1:48:03
Well, we have it down at 60 and it was at 210 so I still feel pretty good, as you should.

Matthias Miller  1:48:15
Okay, so we have these other ones with these issues. Do

Matthias Miller  1:48:29
add a add validation against deleting a purchase order if, if a vendor invoice links to it and then do historical cleanup on the RG for deleted purchase orders.

Speaker 2  1:48:54
Okay, so basic, basic, go ahead, when you say validation, you're saying make stop, not just a prompt, but you actually can't, right? Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:49:03
disallow. I mean, that's the solution, pure and simple. And then once we get these rows here, let's do some I want to check something else here.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:21
Yeah, the 23 walls don't have any Well, actually, 24

Speaker 4  1:49:25
Sure, the stationary express ones we have already been battling with and have done updates and things to

Matthias Miller  1:49:37
fix them. Okay, so we should have a they've

Unknown Speaker  1:49:41
been on the mismatch report for eons.

Matthias Miller  1:49:45
Well, let's, let's, let's put them to rest. Shall we?

Speaker 4  1:49:49
Yeah, it'll probably mean we need to do a new correction

Matthias Miller  1:49:53
transaction Exactly, exactly

Unknown Speaker  1:49:56
this. This would affect AP, right? Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:00
Where's I think all that old stuff's been journaled already, but,

Matthias Miller  1:50:08
okay, Seth, you like it? I'm slightly terrified. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:50:13
also slightly terrified, but I think it's right.

Matthias Miller  1:50:19
And let's make this be let's make this be an editable report. And let's do, oh, great. Oh, saving the Okay, fine. Let's just not, okay, let's do this.

Speaker 3  1:50:36
And let's do, I'm like, one of the 23 ones, or something first. That's great idea.

Matthias Miller  1:50:44
Let's actually do this. One more. One just Okay, so 23 is there a 23 with lots? Okay, 23 this guy, it's the only point.

Speaker 7  1:50:57
Wait for it. Boom. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:51:02
Modification history deleted this guy. Okay, so then now let's go to this guy.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:10
Let's keep him open, just in case.

Matthias Miller  1:51:16
Boom, look at that. He still has his rows and all right now for the grand finale, drum roll please. Boom. All right, so now we're gonna go back to this guy, no or that report

Unknown Speaker  1:51:37
that I closed this guy, how you like that? Wait till tomorrow and it'll show up raw materials,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:49
pushing accounting update, probably as soon as we get out the call. So

Speaker 4  1:51:58
that's final structures, FGI, so, yeah, I haven't been. I mean, I probably did enough to find that, and that was about where I quit.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:11
Good, well, that, that alone calls for a what's the, what's the cool new thing that coffee shops now serve the living? Oh, a

Matthias Miller  1:52:26
matcha? Matcha? Yeah, I'll have to go either get or make me a matcha right now.

Speaker 2  1:52:35
If I have what is a good matcha to buy, I can

Matthias Miller  1:52:41
send you, do you want an Amazon link? Sure, I can get you an Amazon link for what I for, what I get, and then you get one of these, one of these immersion blenders, at least that's what I do. I haven't gone all the way to the like the brush you're supposed to like the way they do in the coffee shop. They brush it in and all this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:01
What do you mean? You brush it

Matthias Miller  1:53:04
like they have this little brush that they use. They put it in a bowl, and they like, dissolve it using a brush in the in the hot water.

Speaker 2  1:53:12
So it's just hot water. You put that that finally, well, tea.

Matthias Miller  1:53:17
What I do, what I do is, I will, I'll put the tea in with just a little bit of water. I'll blend it. I'll do a very healthy dose, dose of half and half, sweeten it up a little bit, blend it again, and then top it off with more hot water. When I do it myself, that's, that's my combination of making it, you know, the trade off between good and lazy.

Speaker 2  1:53:47
It sounds better than the yarba. What is it? Yarba, mate, I tried to convince myself that I could learn to like that, because it's kind of cool. But it never worked.

Matthias Miller  1:54:05
Did you? Did you try that special kind that I sent you?

Unknown Speaker  1:54:10
No, I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:14
I think

Unknown Speaker  1:54:15
that there's one that doesn't taste like Al valve,

Matthias Miller  1:54:20
yeah, that's, that's the one one of my friends from, he grew up in Mexico.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:28
I forget what Uruguay or wherever. It's

Speaker 2  1:54:31
wrong. Oh yeah, it's a big thing in South America. But okay, you could do there's, I think there's three different keys that people use for yarba, though, or no, no, I'm getting this all confused. Yarba is a tea. I think it is a tea, yeah. And there's also one from Japan, like, R, O, O, some, I think,

Matthias Miller  1:54:52
oh, Roy boss, yeah. So our local coffee shop uses Roy bus and for their Chai, which gives you. Decaf, a naturally decaffeinated chai tea to add. Yeah, I sent you two links to the matcha I have, the one I have right now, and the one I got before that. And then I just get a little there's also I got a little teaspoon measuring thing and a immersion blender, and try not to sneeze or spill stuff because especially not right before it called, because it's very green.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:31
Yeah, good.

Speaker 2  1:55:37
Well, I think that we've got all the important stuff covered.

Speaker 3  1:55:41
Then sweet too. I just seeing your email about adding validation make sure we don't invoice before build date.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:53
Oh yeah, thanks for Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:57
Is that something we should be doing

Unknown Speaker  1:56:00
soon? I me

Speaker 2  1:56:03
at some point. I don't think it's, do we have it? No, we have it's on that incident, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:56:11
but is the incident open or closed? I think it might

Speaker 2  1:56:17
be closed, maybe, maybe closed, because it's DF,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:23
oh, it is open. Yeah, it's open. What in but it's assigned to Drew. I should assign it back to myself. Okay, now I'll see it. I think I'd switched it to you because we're waiting on you to

Unknown Speaker  1:56:41
look at it.

Speaker 4  1:56:44
I mean, I really can't come up with any incidents where they should be able to be I mean, other than, like, JR trying to up the sales numbers for a year right before the end of the year.

Speaker 2  1:56:55
So like, is there? Should we have Matthias and Jeff creators in report where that actually happened, of ones that were invoiced before Bill gate to help us clean up. It

Unknown Speaker  1:57:07
would be helpful for cleanup. Yeah, that would be great.

Speaker 3  1:57:11
A new IFR report coming up.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:14
Yeah, I need more favorite space. I could favor it

Matthias Miller  1:57:20
down too well. We can do the same thing to your favorites that we did with the IFR reports. You can just blink it out and you can start.

Speaker 2  1:57:30
You probably wouldn't miss good So Seth, yeah, if you could get us that report yet, and the validations report is probably the more help. Well, it is. The third four is probably the easy one to do, and then we can clean those 175

Unknown Speaker  1:57:47
of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:48
What invoice before build date?

Speaker 2  1:57:52
But do we need to go back? I mean, do we anything prior to 25 should? Should be ignored, right? Yeah, I would look at either ignore anything. It's not in 25 built date or invoice date. Yeah, either date you're saying both dates have to

Speaker 4  1:58:12
be 20 No, either date can be in 25 if either date is in 25 keep it on the report.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:19
So your expression would be, or

Unknown Speaker  1:58:26
probably has three negatives. Yeah, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:33
Good, anything,

Matthias Miller  1:58:38
sorry, what was it? Anything else? Yeah, no, I can't think of anything. Okay, good, good, and we'll talk

Speaker 2  1:58:45
in two weeks. Yes, have a happy or less Thanksgiving, and you guys staying home for Thanksgiving and traveling.

Matthias Miller  1:58:58
Hang home. Yeah, we have, we're staying in Colorado, staying home. We have friends of ours that are who, against our will, decided to, are deciding to move to upstate New York. So we're going to have one last Thanksgiving with a group of us hanging together, hang out a lot, so good and persuading them to stay. So we'll, I guess we'll be cordial and have a Thanksgiving together and

Speaker 2  1:59:26
send them off. So you're doing the turkey and everything. Are you? You are more and more people are doing steaks and Thanksgiving,

Matthias Miller  1:59:38
no turkey, turkey or ham or something, doing a fairly traditional Thanksgiving thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:43
Yeah, yep, good, good, awesome,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:51
affluent people that are too close to green egg or

Speaker 2  1:59:58
you. Not too sales order, games, relatives, I think, had had ribeye.

Speaker 3  2:00:05
So I found a sales order that was invoiced 71 days before it was built. Yeah, I'll send you the report.

Speaker 4  2:00:16
Then, yeah, there was, there was one in ABC that was, yeah, at least it's probably that one that I found

Unknown Speaker  2:00:25
