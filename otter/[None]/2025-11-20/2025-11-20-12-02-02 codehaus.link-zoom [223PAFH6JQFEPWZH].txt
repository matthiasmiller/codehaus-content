Unknown Speaker  00:10
Made them for me. They made the cookies. Okay,

Matthias Miller  00:14
I like cookies. Oh, give me cookies. Give me cookies.

Unknown Speaker  00:18
Um, okay. What are we working on today?

Matthias Miller  00:26
Matthias, potentially RTO, PRO data review and just wrapping your head around,

Unknown Speaker  00:34
oh, yeah, I don't think so. I think we're good.

Speaker 1  00:39
Okay, okay, I meant to go look at that, and instead, I was having too much fun playing today with listen when, when you have software, when you have AI software tools that you can just go build a website. That's pretty freaking awesome.

Unknown Speaker  01:00
It is

Speaker 1  01:03
I, I just, I started redoing all of our, our RTO sites. Go to, go to, to cricket, share your screen and go to cricket Valley, rent a shed. Calm. I think it is cricket

Matthias Miller  01:17
Valley, rent shed, rent shed, render shade. You didn't tell AI to redo the logo, though,

Unknown Speaker  01:25
not my logo. That looks a

Matthias Miller  01:28
lot better. It looks a lot more modern. No kidding. Send us some send us a message. You can't, you can't, oh yeah, you can't cancel out. Just click on you can't hit escape.

Unknown Speaker  01:46
Look. Stop poking holes. Now, I have to go back and fix that now.

Matthias Miller  01:51
Warning, bus call, oh, it's a telephone link. Look at that. Look at that. That's beautiful. Now this part probably isn't well, that's like, sorry, this is, this is words from, I should read you this straight, straight up, this. This was just too good.

Matthias Miller  02:21
Justin, no, this is from a client of mine who will I'll leave anonymous, making a lot of changes in the company. Just need a little more info and prep as the car is headed into a corner, like around the curve, I'm trying to let people know that we're making a turn slash heading into a corner. So hold on. But I'm not sure if everyone will be able to stay in the car. The centrifugal forces may throw some people out of the car if they are not holding on properly, bless and keep them. Lord, I know he's a great dude anyway, so So I thought of that when I was looking at this. This is like driving a car going, we're on a highway.

Speaker 1  03:01
I just think, I think it's insane. Like, so the first one I did, if you go to M O R, space m o r, s, p, A, C, E, rentals.com. I think it is more space rentals. Yeah, that's nice. This is the first one I did. And so, like, literally, I went and just literally copied the files from the original website. Had a hostinger, yeah, and threw it into bolt and said, Hey, we want to redo this whole entire website. It has to look it has to look way nicer. Has looked more modern. And, you know, I spent a couple hours on it, but, dude, I can't write code like this. Are you insane?

Matthias Miller  03:47
Yeah, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
I mean, it's, it's mind blowing. I think,

Matthias Miller  03:54
I think the fascinating thing I found, I find about this is that all the stuff further down the value chain, just keep getting increasingly less valuable, and the stuff further up the value chain. Just keep getting more and

Unknown Speaker  04:07
more valuable. Tell me what you mean.

Matthias Miller  04:10
I'm working through. I have so many existential crises that can't, you know, count, can't count them all, but I'm working I'm working through like a brand foundations class from somebody who's gone deep down the rabbit hole of what is the deep essence of true essence of brands, beyond just logos and all this stuff, and it's like, that kind of stuff that's like, that's like, super, super, super high value, and knocking out a website and Even coming up with slogans that's all like, and even increasingly marketing copy and content, some of that stuff isn't quite there yet. Some of it is like getting the getting the foundations right, the like, those types of things right. Really, really matter more and more than ever, I think, or. Not more than ever, become more valuable.

Speaker 1  05:02
Here's the crazy thing so, and this is what blows my mind. So I'm like, between, between bolt as a coding platform, chat, GPT and grok. There's just about nothing you can't figure out. Yeah, no, there's not. And it's like, you know, because the, like, the survey forms and all this, I didn't really want to go set up a database side to do this. And so I'm, like, having this back and forth. I wanted to be, it's pretty much a static website, because it they're very low, like, they're very low impact. And so it's just, it's just basically a front end in order to get to the Make a Payment screen, is all that it is. And so, but yet, you know, you know you want to have some communication factors. And so chat GPT says, Well, fine, if you don't want to do, if you don't want to do it, set up a database and all this. Well, you just write PHP files and and have the have the server or have the hosting jerk, just email the stuff. And so I don't know what I'll go get fine. We'll go, we'll do that. Works like a charter.

Matthias Miller  06:00
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

Speaker 1  06:07
And then the funny part is so much fun, I go copy out it. Bolt wrote one of the PHP files for me at one point. And so I copied over to chat and said, What do you think of this?

Speaker 2  06:20
And it's comment was, hey, bolt actually wrote something clean. So it's like, it was like ripping on both, like, it's like we got a eyes ripping on AIS now, right?

Matthias Miller  06:34
Oh, that's hilarious, man. All right, good stuff. Um, well, from a developer bottleneck standpoint, we could turn Sean loose whenever we have RTO pro stuff down.

Speaker 1  06:51
There's this, where is the you sent me the file, right?

Matthias Miller  06:54
There's a giant you put it

Speaker 1  06:56
in the you put it in the same folder. You said, okay, yeah, all right, let me get to that folder. If I remember where I put the folder, share with me. Come on. There you are. Drive. Oh, come on. Hey, Google. Seriously, why do I have to verify all the time,

Matthias Miller  07:17
all the time, all the time. I and

Speaker 1  07:26
then I have to go through last past two factor authentication. And here I am whining about authentication.

Matthias Miller  07:37
So just based on file sizes, I'm going to say the receipt table. Well, I don't even know, I don't know file sizes. Do it?

Speaker 1  07:49
Okay, just bear with me for a second. I want to, I want to get to the place where I can look at this V go. All right, seriously, what? Verification Code for the Google Authenticator app? Who set this up?

Matthias Miller  08:09
Should I go make some coffee while we wait?

Unknown Speaker  08:12
Just give me a second go for a jog. I

Matthias Miller  08:26
talk to grok about what I should say. I

Speaker 1  10:00
Be like me. Okay, so what's so need Allison to get the code we can set you up with the DR Matthias, while we while we stand here, yes. Hi, Matthias, Hey.

Matthias Miller  10:20
How's it going? You just watch me scratch my back. You're on headless. I can't even see your face. Man,

Speaker 1  10:27
we had to get down. Get There you go. There you go. It's been

Matthias Miller  10:31
a minute. Pull that door shut. Hey, it's been a minute. You need to come out to Colorado again. I'm lonely out here at my office there in two weeks. Were you

Unknown Speaker  10:39
really it's coming out there skiing?

Matthias Miller  10:40
Dude, all right. Well, if you're around, drop by.

Unknown Speaker  10:44
I might say hi, bring you a gift basket or something, or like,

Speaker 1  10:52
tell her to open up the app on her phone. Why don't you? I don't know why he decided to put, put two factor authentication

Unknown Speaker  11:04
code or app anyway. He says too many suspicious people have been logging in.

Unknown Speaker  11:15
Well, I get that all the time. Suspicious people logging in or putting out mostly,

Matthias Miller  11:23
mostly me, mostly me. Our podcast assistant was made a comment about being excited about one of the posts and wondering if it was weird to be so excited about it. And I was like, you know, I'm the wrong guy to ask about weird.

Unknown Speaker  11:43
Still not 770063,

Unknown Speaker  11:45
that's what I put in. It says wrong code. Try again.

Unknown Speaker  11:54
This is ridiculous. All

Matthias Miller  11:57
right, let me see if I can convert these into, I mean, I can, I can screen share all this stuff, if you know.

Speaker 1  12:06
And that's what we're just going to do for right now. Okay, so Well, just bear me through for one more minute. Yep, if we can't get one more minute, then we're going to, we're going to abandon the ship,

Matthias Miller  12:20
then the car is going to hit the corner and people are going to fly fly

Speaker 2  12:23
out. People are going to fly out. Yes, that's funny. We got to go around the corner here. I'm not sure everybody can stay in the

Unknown Speaker  12:31
car. Is this your pallet shop? People?

Matthias Miller  12:33
Yup, is my palette shop? We're having so much fun, fun on this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  12:39
Are you building? Are you building a

Matthias Miller  12:42
an ERP form? Yeah, and it's just like thing, yep, we're getting, we're getting Board Flip per hour. We're getting all kinds of, we're getting crazy problems, power on all

Speaker 2  12:56
machines. All right, I'm I'm okay. I'm looking at you now. All right.

Matthias Miller  13:01
Look at me. Look at me. Let's

Unknown Speaker  13:04
look at the Shema.

Matthias Miller  13:14
So this is, these are the tables. It doesn't say how many rows are in each one. I'm trying to pull up the data here in Excel is just dying. Receipt table is the biggest one.

Speaker 1  13:29
Comments, okay, let's look at let's look at history here.

Matthias Miller  13:36
Let's do this. Let's open Yes, Notepad plus, plus would be a far better option.

Matthias Miller  13:48
So history comments, okay, so history is transaction, date type, due, date, days, late, amount,

Unknown Speaker  14:02
okay, hold on. Oh, hallelujah,

Speaker 1  14:05
okay, but Matthew Warman, okay, transaction type, contract suite.

Unknown Speaker  14:13
Oh, dude, we can,

Speaker 1  14:15
can you? Can you split the columns? Dude, this means, this means we can build entire history just like that.

Matthias Miller  14:25
Well, I'm not quite sure it's just like that, but don't need to do

Speaker 1  14:29
everything in it. Like I feel like I want to go through every one of these and be like, Yeah, we don't need that. We don't need that. So number, Transaction Date,

Matthias Miller  14:42
sorry, I'm struggling. Excel, actually, more specifically, is struggling.

Matthias Miller  14:53
I don't know Sure. Okay, Warren, we got the transaction date. We get the account. Number, which is a link to the account table. We have the receipt trans type, which is an r and a P,

Unknown Speaker  15:08
R trans R and P.

Speaker 1  15:19
Due Date, next due date, days late, perfect. I

Matthias Miller  15:22
love how we how we store days late instead of just calculating it payment form.

Speaker 1  15:32
So just so you know other is late fees. Okay, I don't know if you just want to make notes on this, or how you want to do this. Well, what I

Matthias Miller  15:41
would want to start first is just, let's figure out what literal data we want in the system, and then let's

Speaker 1  15:49
obviously, we need a, b, c, d, transaction type. I'm going to guess we need it, rent. Oh, R is rental. P is payment, no, but there's an RNP for,

Matthias Miller  16:12
like, the RNP for each and then zero, there's a $0 amount on the rental. And

Speaker 1  16:28
let's do this. Hold on a second. Hold on a second. Let me get into vt cloud. Let's look at, I want to look at an actual Do you? Can you determine which company this is? It's it? Or just tell me what was the if you go back to the folder and just tell me the store number, it's in the it's in the file, in the backup file name, okay, I think it was store four. Store. Where did it? No, no. If you go back, just go back to the to the

Matthias Miller  17:01
door to, I think it's store for you. That's no store to this one, the, I think this one store two.

Speaker 1  17:10
Okay, but which one, which one was the Okay, so the so the bigger one, the 4.8 kilobytes, is gigabytes. Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Is one that that's going to be the full the full data set. Well, and this one

Matthias Miller  17:24
would actually work, I think, now that I figured out how to get it

Speaker 1  17:29
to export, well, that is okay. So there's like, three levels of data backups that you can do. You can do data only. You can do a full backup, which basically backs up the entire software. Yep, you can do a full data backup without images, and then you can do a full data backup with images. Now, when we get into with images, that means that we have to have s3 up and running in order to push all the contract

Unknown Speaker  17:55
images, right?

Matthias Miller  17:59
I mean, which, which? That all ties out to, oh, where is it I saw here, images. Is it images? No, maybe it is.

Unknown Speaker  18:11
Yeah, it's giving you the foldering. Oh, never mind.

Matthias Miller  18:14
This is, this is linked out in the database so you can, and then we can just suck these out, push them to s3 and link them on the record. Yeah,

Speaker 1  18:23
you see how, you see how the folder name is in the file name. And I'm assuming that that's a contract number, probably 2107 see the

Matthias Miller  18:31
contract number? I mean, some of these are actually also represented in the database, like there's an image with an ID, and maybe it's, maybe it's, maybe it's the docs, because there's also these dot Well anyway, but yes, those translate over. So we are looking at the history table right now. Yeah,

Speaker 1  18:52
I want to get to you said store two, correct? Yeah, that'd be cricket Valley. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  19:00
You said store two,

Matthias Miller  19:01
yes, well,

Speaker 1  19:03
okay, give me a give me a contract. Number 1002, is it account number contract?

Matthias Miller  19:11
Contract number 1002, for Matthew Warman, 1002,

Speaker 1  19:17
Matthew Warman, let's look at history. History, history. History. What am I calling it? History? Yes, okay,

Matthias Miller  19:27
so we want here. Let's do this, Tools, Data.

Unknown Speaker  19:40
Oh, goodness. This one goes back to 2007

Matthias Miller  19:44
I've seen 2006 in here.

Speaker 1  19:46
Well, I'm looking at, I'm looking at, I'm looking at the payment dates on this stuff. Do.

Matthias Miller  20:07
Okay, so we have translate account. Translate. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  20:23
May have to research some of these terms,

Matthias Miller  20:27
but we need the

Speaker 1  20:28
because what's really interesting to me is that in the history itself, it doesn't reflect some of this information it, but it's reflecting it based on on receipt. The receipt number carries the C and the P, I mean,

Matthias Miller  20:49
but why wouldn't we just pull in these first sets of columns? Because we were pretty confident we need that.

Speaker 1  20:58
So the contract type defines it. You're in history, right? Yeah, so there is okay. So tax zone

Matthias Miller  21:10
Texan tax rate, probably at least need tax rate. Store you're going to need,

Speaker 1  21:22
where's the store? Oh, yeah, store number two, yeah, that that tells you which RTO company it's with. But there's I'm looking for. Scroll to the left. There should be a payment form.

Matthias Miller  21:40
The payment form. Yeah, right here, LMO, yeah, payment form, you need a refund.

Speaker 1  21:52
Check is k, credit card, I think is C, don't remember what, what cash is.

Matthias Miller  22:00
Well, my Okay, so we should have a notes. I need, I need a notes. Let's do this. Insert one column left. Okay, so this one history, where are we? Okay, so this one should be name, would be a list, date account is a number. Receipt is a probably a string, trans type list, contract is a number. Date, date number, number two decimals. All of these guys are numbers, two decimals. This would be a list. And then the refund is a Boolean. Well, I guess it's a Boolean. Or is it a, is refund a yes, no, or is it a,

Unknown Speaker  22:52
an amount, it'll be, it'll be an it'll be $1 value.

Matthias Miller  22:56
Okay, do Um,

Matthias Miller  23:05
okay, is that good? Is there anything else we need out of here? What's the hokey? It

Matthias Miller  23:14
looks like a link to some other record or something, but,

Matthias Miller  23:22
or maybe it's a unique identifier. It looks like that is what it is.

Unknown Speaker  23:30
It's the Hokey that's what's

Matthias Miller  23:31
Hokie. Why would you call it a hokey history? It's a history something key. I don't know what the something is but so we want the hokey.

Unknown Speaker  23:44
I think you want the Hokey for something.

Matthias Miller  23:49
Oh, we want it for keying on the import.

Matthias Miller  23:57
Okay, so that's the hokey. That's the history.

Matthias Miller  24:06
What else we got? Do you want receipts? I'm not sure why I'm opening this one, because it's what killed me the last time.

Speaker 1  24:14
What is what is receipts? What is the receipt? I don't know that we need a receipt, because we could, in history, we could be able to generate our own receipt out of it. The receipt table, I'm assumed, is some sort of stored something or other. Is there a way to look at it without it breaking?

Matthias Miller  24:35
Yeah, if I, if I just do this, yeah, it literally is the text receipt, it's the text receipt. Yeah, okay, so you don't care about

Unknown Speaker  24:46
that. I don't know that. I really want to.

Matthias Miller  24:52
I mean, the only reason that could be useful is if you want to cross reference or something.

Speaker 1  24:57
All of this, all of this, is generated. From the data that we like. Once we're in the software, we can generate our own receipt.

Matthias Miller  25:05
The only reason would be if you want to the

Matthias Miller  25:13
the if you want to cross reference for some reason,

Speaker 1  25:18
how is it? How is it tabling like? How does it? How is it putting the data?

Matthias Miller  25:22
Like, it's this guy. I'm pretty sure this guy translates into, see here, this ID gotcha is tied to,

Speaker 1  25:35
yeah, I know I get that. But I mean, like, the actual text file. How, like, how would you even? How would you even if we wanted, if I said I want these stored somehow, how would you even get them in store?

Matthias Miller  25:48
I would import them into a separate database level and just put them in a memo, understand your question. And then we would, we would build, okay, so, the basic model for this is, we're going to replicate RTO PRO data model in the silver loom, and then we can build you custom reports. Say, Hey, I want to look up a receipt for this. We're not going to import it into the existing system. It's just Gotcha. But let's not, if you don't think it's necessary, let's not you. Um, I'm probably complicating things.

Speaker 1  26:32
Okay, here's what I'm struggling with. I'm struggling with is there, is there a case for something that may have been given to the customer prior as a receipt. Is there a case for having that? Yeah, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  26:59
Let's I don't think we're going to paint ourselves in a corner if we come back later and say, Hey, we want that.

Speaker 1  27:05
Okay, that's what I want to do.

Matthias Miller  27:09
Comments, by the way, we have rich text formatted comments, but we probably don't need that for now. We have emails. What's the master bore?

Speaker 1  27:23
Or in theirs stands for balance on rent. But how are they using it? Master, garden, shed, table, open.

Matthias Miller  27:40
Master board, okay, so we got the board date, beginning and ending. Board, new, rent, re, rental, pick up, early payout, payouts. Get have a category, rented, idle, transfer in, transfer out, history key. I mean,

Speaker 1  28:11
I don't think we need this. Okay, so then

Matthias Miller  28:15
we have the you got the bore the action table? What's this guy? Sure to convert it. Why not Bob? Action date? Oh, this is invoice printed, etc. We don't need that, do we? Wow, letter by mail.

Speaker 1  28:40
I mean, I guess the only, the only thing valuable to this is that

Matthias Miller  28:47
importing notes,

Speaker 1  28:49
well, it's, it's, it's basically saying we printed an invoice on this date,

Matthias Miller  28:56
gave commitment, printed, NSF, letter, payment, coupons printed.

Speaker 1  29:02
Okay? If I was to, if I think we want this, but it's, it's basically a a, okay, let me see the headers. So do we have an okay? We have an account number. We have a contract, okay, yeah, but it's not, it's not gonna give you a contract number. I don't think you can scroll. Don't think you can scroll the way down through and does it? Is there ever

Matthias Miller  29:25
a contract number in there's, there's 4000 of them. So it might have started. Maybe they started adding contract numbers later. It

Speaker 1  29:31
must be. But this was that this information was generally in the notes history, like it would, it would, these line items would go in notes history. And so I kind of feel like you just literally per con, like, on a per contract basis, you just go find everything that matched up with that contract number, then put, put it in in date oriented, in one big, giant note. And so you can, you can pull it up in history and say, Okay, we sent them an invoice on this date. We sent. At them, this particular letter on that date, we did this, we did this, we did this, we did this. And it's, that's all it is. I think it's valuable information to know, but it's aside from that. I think it's all, it's just into a note.

Matthias Miller  30:14
Okay, so we're going to want for our purposes. Do you want the employee? Yes. H O update. What in the hang is H O update? A hoe update. When you say it like that,

Speaker 1  30:34
the hoop date is never see any information, any valuable information in it. It's always going to be zeros. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it pertains to. I never have Okay, for some reason we I always thought it said hoop go, but hoop date, I always thought was hoop date. I never thought. I never read it as ho update. Do you

Matthias Miller  31:01
want the handle flags or action type or handle employee? Is there any valuable

Speaker 1  31:05
information? Is there any valuable information in action? Type three, I don't even know what that is, ID. Message ID probably pertain to, like, SMS messages. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. So, I mean, that may be, I don't you know that we don't know what we sent to them at that point. So,

Matthias Miller  31:28
string, contract, string account, string action, action, date, string date, string, date time. Okay, well, we'll start with this ones. Security. We probably don't need.

Unknown Speaker  31:54
What's security?

Matthias Miller  31:59
It's probably, oh, it's, it's another log.

Unknown Speaker  32:05
Oh, my goodness, you gotta be kidding

Matthias Miller  32:07
me. Due date changed. Oh, so

Unknown Speaker  32:09
this the due date log change? Yeah. Mount

Matthias Miller  32:16
EOD, discrepancy. Hold it. I I hold it. This looks like a convoluted history thing, but do you want it? Hold on one second. Yep, I'll be holding

Unknown Speaker  32:53
thought we had till the end of the year,

Speaker 1  33:09
oh, RTO Pro, they're gonna make my life miserable.

Matthias Miller  33:13
Yes, okay, do you want? Is it even? Is it? Is

Speaker 1  33:19
it? It feels like there should be a league, like you should be able to make a legal case. You can't just, I'm currently using a credit card processor in conjunction with your software. You can't throw me out of that relationship.

Matthias Miller  33:31
You would think, okay, sorry. Back to you. I mean, do you want this stuff? Which 1am I looking at security? What is it? Due date changed? Yeah. I mean, it's due date change. It's it's all kinds of just crazy discrepancy, date end of EOD discrepancy,

Unknown Speaker  33:52
we're going to need to know due date changes.

Matthias Miller  33:56
Well, I know, but not this isn't fielded. I would think there's another place we can get it. But if

Unknown Speaker  34:00
you want to go, it actually was fielded in the history,

Matthias Miller  34:05
that's what I thought, I mean. So if you want all this information, great. It's just this, to me, looks like a notes and comments field that's, you know, ballooned out of control. And so I'm happy to add it. I would, I would look at it like that. That's what it in my opinion, what it is

Speaker 1  34:26
but, but historical due date changes. How are we going to? How are we

Matthias Miller  34:33
going to? It's not in the history, do I that's not in the history,

Unknown Speaker  34:40
like in the payment history? Yeah, I mean,

Matthias Miller  34:43
that's what I would think. That's what I would think. So the

Speaker 1  34:47
rest of the stuff, like payoff, amount changed. I don't know that I want to care, do I it is a log, but I mean, I'm wondering if the due date, I'm wondering if the due date changes are somewhere else. This looks more like, wait, wait, what was this thing called security log? No, no, never mind. We do not need this. This is the security log. I know exactly what this thing comes from. This comes like you can actually download this out of the security section of RTO Pro, and it's basically just gives you a running history of stuff that they think you probably know it's security log.

Matthias Miller  35:17
Yeah. Okay. Do you want web payments? Probably, yeah,

Speaker 1  35:24
but the weird part is, we need to cross reference if they're already in the payment history, then we can straight up disregard this because, I think because RTO pro had a secondary processing platform online that would talk to the database. And I have a feeling this is the history of that,

Matthias Miller  35:47
but we do, but we do need this for some situations.

Speaker 1  35:50
Well, what I'm what I'm curious about, though, is if we can, if we can verify, like, if we were to pick an account and verify that the payment is actually there in the in the payment history record, then we don't need this.

Matthias Miller  36:04
Well, let's go try Clarence Stewart for well, let's just by receipt. Search by receipt.

Unknown Speaker  36:12
Get a more current date.

Matthias Miller  36:14
Oh, you want a recent date? Okay? This guy, Cheryl. Cheryl is not in here.

Speaker 1  36:29
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Is he literally building? Is he literally building the history for the account from like several different tables?

Matthias Miller  36:39
Wallace, Cheryl is not in here Wallace. Is there any Wallace? There's no Wallace in history. Are

Unknown Speaker  36:50
you sure you have the payment history, table

Matthias Miller  36:52
history, that this guy? Well, sure, yeah, sure. It seems like it.

Unknown Speaker  37:01
So I guess that means that he's combining from multiple different tables.

Matthias Miller  37:07
So we need rent, we eat all that. We don't need the you. I hope the credit card number is just like he's I hope that's not literally the credit card number.

Unknown Speaker  37:17
I'm hoping he's gonna get I'm hoping the token number is there.

Matthias Miller  37:22
He does have tokens.

Unknown Speaker  37:23
You have a token table,

Matthias Miller  37:28
credit card number, well, actually, hang on, record number, no. That's the last four No. But if we go recent, it changes.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Are those the tokens,

Matthias Miller  37:41
bank account. They look like they could be credit card expiration date. It looks like he, he grabbed the credit card expiration date for the token.

Unknown Speaker  37:56
There's not a token table, is there? Um,

Matthias Miller  38:03
um, we're here. Let's do, let's search for credit card, credit token.

Unknown Speaker  38:15
This seems like a very inefficient database.

Matthias Miller  38:19
Oh, I don't believe that they've I mean, it looks a nightmarish to me. There's a reason why it's crappy. Rec, no updates. We need a store. Probably need to stop saying that number. I

Matthias Miller  38:43
a due date, the date, date, process date.

Speaker 1  38:50
You know that, like, if you go over to column H, it pretty much is telling you exactly what's there.

Matthias Miller  38:57
I know, but some of them don't, don't translate completely, perfectly, okay, don't suit yourself. Ring. I don't know what a var is, but it's a variable character, length, variable string length, tracking number. Do we need tracking number?

Unknown Speaker  39:12
Probably tracking number, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  39:19
Yeah, let's store it.

Matthias Miller  39:25
Total paid string. String, trans, day is that day or daytime? That's the biggest, probably the biggest thing, date time, date time string, this is actually okay.

Speaker 1  39:46
What is a big integer? What is this moment?

Matthias Miller  39:49
Yeah, big, big integer. Just how big it can go. Okay, so we have web payments. Now we have contracts. Well, I suspect we're going to want some of this. Yeah.

Speaker 1  40:00
Think, Well, okay, hold on, a second wait. This is the wait. Which one, which one are we in

Matthias Miller  40:07
contracts? The bottom

Unknown Speaker  40:09
the bottom one, the bottom one

Matthias Miller  40:11
is in his contracts in French. This

Unknown Speaker  40:13
is payment history. Oh,

Matthias Miller  40:18
no, yeah. It's payment totals.

Matthias Miller  40:45
In the world, are you?

Speaker 1  40:54
I mean, goodness, you have, you have, in column n is the status of the account. It's paid out, it's returned to repossess like we have, we have, yeah, but

Matthias Miller  41:02
this is not payment history. This is, this is a summary,

Unknown Speaker  41:06
you sure? Oh, yeah, no kidding. Amount Paid, okay,

Matthias Miller  41:13
contract account. We want this. We want the due

Speaker 1  41:18
date. Like all of this stuff is, like, stored and updated all the time. This

Matthias Miller  41:22
is just see what I mean. I mean payment. We want last trans seems unnecessary, yeah,

Speaker 1  41:31
but this is like, these are sums. I don't even know that this, I don't know there's a ton of value here. Well,

Matthias Miller  41:37
we need the contract definitions. I mean, sure contract date payment would make sense. Contract amount would make sense. Yeah, amount paid, other paid, other pay other due, charges, due, status would make sense. Con type,

Unknown Speaker  41:54
that's contract type.

Matthias Miller  41:56
I'm slow. Sorry. Terms, payments. We need bore. What would you say? Bore is,

Speaker 1  42:04
it's called balance on rent and balance on rent it literally, it's like, okay, for that contract, there is one balance on rent and, and I don't know that the bore is any value to us.

Matthias Miller  42:16
Do you want model numbers and serial numbers and descriptions on these.

Speaker 1  42:21
Well, I mean, that's all, that's all product information. Do we have a Do we have a product? Is there a product record? Is there? Is there a build, or is this how they stored this?

Matthias Miller  42:37
We have an inventory. Okay, with the model and serial hole.

Speaker 1  42:41
Okay, so this would be, this would be your product record. Then

Matthias Miller  42:45
you are kidding me. I mean, it seems like we should store model and serial number descriptions. Seems to me like it's likely duplicated.

Unknown Speaker  43:01
It would be, it's coming from the inventory record, right?

Matthias Miller  43:08
But we use this for linking. You can only have 1010, models per contract. What does that mean? You know, I don't know. Wait, this is tied back to the contract record. I don't think we need these. Does this thing have a rec? No, what's a rec? Now, record, record number, is there some kind of unique identifier on this guy?

Unknown Speaker  43:39
The contract number.

Matthias Miller  43:44
But you can have multiple per contract number. That's the thing to be. Contract Number is probably model plus. Is model number unique?

Matthias Miller  44:01
Yeah, model number is a unique ID. Okay, so we need to pull these model No, we don't need to pull these, because these are just, oh, dude. Okay, let's get the inventory. But we know we need that, then when we come to inventory, so product, we have the description. Do we? We don't need rates, probably,

Speaker 1  44:20
oh, we need cash. I don't think there's any valuable information in rates. Well, rate one would be, I'm assuming the the but that would have probably been the payment on that building.

Matthias Miller  44:30
I would think so, in the way this is looking. But why

Unknown Speaker  44:34
would he have stored that on the inventory record?

Matthias Miller  44:38
123, 84, one, I mean that one might actually make sense. I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  44:56
Do we do? It feels like there is so much, there's so much in these tables that was like duplicate information, like dude keeping and like,

Unknown Speaker  45:11
there's, there's a hoe update too, and a knob,

Matthias Miller  45:22
what's the sack date?

Unknown Speaker  45:26
Well, I mean, look at that. Look at the date. It's

Matthias Miller  45:28
useless. Well, I know, but it becomes useful probably sometime.

Unknown Speaker  45:34
Well, it

Matthias Miller  45:37
doesn't okay, but you get when you have a hoe update, it's terrible.

Speaker 1  45:46
Why? Why would the oh, we're in the contract record. Never mind. You're not the inventory record. I thought you were in the inventory record. So, yeah, that doesn't make sense at the

Matthias Miller  45:54
discount. Okay, pay off discount. Seems like it could be useful.

Speaker 1  45:57
Yes, that would be the rental fee percentage,

Matthias Miller  46:03
right?

Speaker 1  46:08
Is there anything in the salesman column? Yeah, there's a few. Okay, jump over to the inventory and see if it's stored over there. It

Matthias Miller  46:29
doesn't look like it really.

Speaker 1  46:33
That would seem like something you would store on the inventory record. Who was the salesperson? Okay, we have a vendor, but there's not really much information in that

Matthias Miller  46:55
that come on. Tax Rate probably should, maybe, yep, should, maybe up extra rent, or we have, is there

Unknown Speaker  47:10
anything in that column? I don't think we were using somewhere, really. I don't know what it is.

Matthias Miller  47:23
No like, here's a recent one, 175, on 915, 25 extra rent. I don't

Unknown Speaker  47:35
even know what extra rent

Matthias Miller  47:36
is. I don't know, but sounds good to me. I

Unknown Speaker  47:45
Well, extra rent you get applied as regular rent.

Matthias Miller  47:52
Tags, exempt codes, I don't know dealer ID. We definitely have dealer IDs. Seems like that could be useful.

Unknown Speaker  48:05
Scroll down. Don't see one

Matthias Miller  48:09
should be coming from a dealer table.

Unknown Speaker  48:12
I don't think we have a dealer table.

Matthias Miller  48:17
Yeah, you do? You sure? Um, ah, yeah, there it is, dealer table. I want to see it. Dealer table. Dealer table. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  48:34
Oh, no kidding.

Speaker 1  48:38
And then there's the unique ID in the first Yeah, that's unique idea. Okay, would that be valuable to know?

Matthias Miller  48:45
Okay, so we went, I don't know if we need web ID store, not active. Seems useful own county.

Matthias Miller  49:01
I don't know if you don't need ship from that doesn't that's not useful. Yeah, okay. Contracts like a do, ID, deposit, deposit amount probably seems useful.

Matthias Miller  49:22
No, there's also some of the stuff on inventory, I don't know. I kind of feel like we may just need to take our best shot. Maybe you want to go deep, deeper in the weeks. And I feel like going at this stuff and,

Matthias Miller  49:39
okay, we also have back in inventory.

Speaker 2  49:45
What is d e l inventory, Dell Dell deleted

Matthias Miller  49:50
inventory, I'm guessing,

Matthias Miller  49:56
Dell Dell Dell.

Matthias Miller  50:05
Yeah, it's deleted inventory.

Unknown Speaker  50:08
Why do we care about deleted inventory?

Matthias Miller  50:13
Well, because when you don't have activity

Unknown Speaker  50:20
history, can we just straight up, ignore it?

Matthias Miller  50:23
Well, we're gonna, we're going to for now, yeah, I agree. Okay, okay, we have, okay, back to inventory.

Matthias Miller  50:39
Hey, hello. Inventory. Okay, here we go. So we need we need model, serial, stock. Actually, probably don't need stock. We need description. Might want brand. It should be a list.

Matthias Miller  51:06
Date received account quantity is quantity ever, not that well, apparently it can be zero.

Matthias Miller  51:22
We need the contract.

Unknown Speaker  51:24
There's a zero quantity on an inventory.

Matthias Miller  51:30
Yeah, I don't know where, but somewhere he is. Let's do this

Matthias Miller  51:50
data filter. Well, it's more like I wouldn't say zero is our biggest problem.

Speaker 1  52:06
Yeah, hauling dry run. These are items that we sell out as, apparently, items we can put on a contract to pay for. And it's really, really for us, those are just like other fees. And the only way you could do it in RTO Pro is to make an inventory item that you're going to item that you can assign to the account and

Matthias Miller  52:25
actually have the customer pay for it. Oh, my cow, yeah, I love the negative quantity. That's just classy.

Unknown Speaker  52:39
Well, I'm not sure what is campfire? Campfire cabin? Oh,

Matthias Miller  52:52
I love how we put in different model numbers, because it has to be unique. But hauling Holly, moving Holly on Hollywood. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  53:12
vendor, vendor would make set we need, yep, customer, it's not, probably don't actually need. Should be able to get that off the contract, off the inventory.

Speaker 1  53:30
Rick, we don't need the customer because we have, we have serial number, model number, I'm sure we have contract number. It's tied to on here somewhere, too.

Matthias Miller  53:36
Fill, price, cost, agent, depth, period ID. I have no idea what that means, real book value, depreciation, period, depreciation, date, first sale, date, what is a flipped term?

Unknown Speaker  53:59
Is there any value in for this? There's nothing in it.

Unknown Speaker  54:06
Term flip,

Matthias Miller  54:08
yeah, you've, you've, you've flipped. The term once, just straight up, ignore it.

Matthias Miller  54:21
Store. We need. Do

Matthias Miller  54:27
you need the rental versus retail those?

Speaker 1  54:33
Huh, go ahead. Which one, which column are you looking at? This guy? Yeah. So, so basically, you should see some retails in there, because that's what, that's what they turn into when they, yeah, that's what they turn into when they, when we sell them out of the inventory

Matthias Miller  54:55
status, seems like that would be on the contract. Yeah. Uh huh. Category could be useful. Maybe

Speaker 1  55:12
invoice that would that, yes, we want that. That's the invoice that we have a field for that on our product record. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  55:25
A ho key and a hoe update. What is 1e plus 10? What is that ho key?

Matthias Miller  55:33
It's just a fat key. It's just Oh.

Speaker 1  55:38
So they are unique IDs, though. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  55:44
what were they for?

Matthias Miller  55:46
I'm assuming some tie up the history somewhere, but I'm not sure what it is. I'm not really caring too much, but maybe I should events

Matthias Miller  56:02
pick up. Pickup Truck.

Matthias Miller  56:11
Oh, my cow. I wonder

Speaker 1  56:13
if this was off of the their little scheduling thing. I'm gonna, I'm gonna say the events thing we can just, sort of, let's just push that to the outer edge of the circle of possibilities.

Matthias Miller  56:28
Sounds good. Customer. We need name, alt, name, address, departments, home, phone, commitment. When the hang is a commitment.

Speaker 1  56:39
Expand the column a little bit. There's, I would have thought there would have thought there would have been

Matthias Miller  56:45
something like, here's one, yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  56:49
we don't even know what it's tied to, a

Matthias Miller  56:53
mess. What in the hang is a mess. It's

Speaker 1  56:58
a phone number message, probably, probably a message, like first SMS

Matthias Miller  57:03
message, so we have a cell,

Unknown Speaker  57:07
yeah, I would say we, well, there's some numbers in the

Matthias Miller  57:09
mess. Yeah, we keep it directions.

Speaker 1  57:15
Yes, we do want that, that that should be. Oh, do you remember this? Do you remember this conversation about having a note that you could pin to the top that always is, yeah, like that. So that was the directions, um, messages that would show up at the very top of the account. That's what. That's what it is

Matthias Miller  57:37
comments. What in the hang are these comments?

Unknown Speaker  57:42
Um, to open it, open it, expand the column a little bit. It's just,

Matthias Miller  57:54
there's nothing really here. It's probably something tied to, I know what it is tied to, comments this comments table right here, yeah, but we don't need it. We'll get it some other way.

Unknown Speaker  58:11
Well, but I mean, is there stuff in it not

Matthias Miller  58:14
meaningful? We should pull in the comments table if we want it right? What is the no open,

Unknown Speaker  58:26
no open. Is there anything in it?

Matthias Miller  58:30
All Zeros. There's something. Come on. Let's just do the filter, the whole thing.

Matthias Miller  58:44
Oh, I meant this, okay, do as. I mean not as I stay okay. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  58:57
no, open. I have no idea what it is.

Matthias Miller  58:59
It looks to me like basically, don't re rent or some or,

Unknown Speaker  59:08
oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. It

Matthias Miller  59:10
looks like some kind of bad customer flag.

Speaker 1  59:31
I wonder if it's the do not accept any more checks or ACH payments.

Speaker 1  59:45
It's on the cusp. Is it on the it's on the customer record, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:00:04
Unless it's unless it's the opt in, opt out for the cell phone thing,

Matthias Miller  1:00:13
no open, or maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
what's the highest numbers that are

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
there no open. It's 0123, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:00:23
well, there's three options on, sell No, opt choice, sell No, opt choice, sell, opt in for texting. Sell opt out for texting. There's three options there. Then there's another one that has four options in it. But that's, yeah, I don't know,

Matthias Miller  1:00:46
zero seems to be the most common one,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
which would be sell, no opt choice.

Matthias Miller  1:00:58
I would it must be a we can pull it in, it seems customer date, what's

Speaker 1  1:01:08
the what's the note? Oh, the note go to the no check. Yeah, that's the that's the No, do not accept any more checks. Or Ach, one, I guess, is true. Zero is false, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
Let's see if they have no check, because it would be Yeah, it's a Boolean.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:25
Say it's bullion, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
chicken Boolean.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
What's the urgent? What's the urgent? I don't know. Well, give me, give me urgent

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
mess, urgent message,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
okay, also believe

Speaker 1  1:01:55
I'm gonna say that no open was probably the opt In, opt out, for sell, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:01
but no update. Well, that one's not used, okay?

Matthias Miller  1:02:14
We'll just pull it in as a number and interpret it when we get there.

Speaker 1  1:02:17
Okay, driver's license, one driver's license, two, deposit. What's the deposit? Is there anything in that?

Matthias Miller  1:02:27
Yep, lots of stuff. Well, not really, lots.

Speaker 1  1:02:31
Oh, wait a minute, deposit is per it's either security deposit. Oh, deposit balance. I guess that's, that's security deposit balance.

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
That's current, huh? That's a calculation, then, but

Speaker 1  1:02:50
that's what it is, security deposit balance. Okay, why you put that on the customer record? I don't know. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:59
we're not getting credit card info, although we do have tokens here of some kind,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
do we really?

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
Unless you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:10
suck them in, these are clear tokens. Zip.

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
Do we want any? We have any. We have, we have ACH tokens too, but we're not,

Speaker 1  1:03:24
but ACH tokens are gonna be useless to us if we're going with explore pay as the ACH provider. Okay, now, does, does it? It doesn't, but I mean, Ach, I thought would, is it? Is the ACH number somewhere else

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
with its only token. Well, it's only tokens. We have a routing number and a token, darn it, unless, unless this is actually an encrypted you know what? Check this out. It was, well, there are some account number, no, that's routing. Sorry, yeah, routing

Speaker 1  1:04:07
our account that's that's routing. So this is probably an encrypted account number.

Matthias Miller  1:04:14
Let's ask our buddy,

Speaker 1  1:04:16
copy a bunch into perplexity and say, is this? Is this a hat. Is this a assaulted, assaulted hash i

Matthias Miller  1:04:51
That's base 64 encoding.

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
No, it's some kind of basics for encoding. Oh, it might be an encrypted value they might have a well, if it's from Firebird using binary blobs. I

Speaker 1  1:05:24
it's entropy FYI, we have seven minutes to the boys get on, or six eight minutes of the boys get on, and I have a hard stop a few minutes before the bottom of the hour.

Matthias Miller  1:05:36
So do we want customer? Customer date.

Speaker 1  1:05:41
I mean, if we want to jump on this again tomorrow, I have availability. I might not have availability depends on what time it would have to be 4:10am,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:58
see it'll be 410 or late afternoon.

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
Before 10 or late afternoon looks to me like very unlikely I'll be available before 10. Are you doing your full meeting day on Tuesday? My What do you mean? Do you have

Speaker 1  1:06:26
any I have, dude, my Tuesdays have freed up because they got rid of board calls. So I have, I'm available between 11 and four.

Matthias Miller  1:06:34
Oh, well, here I can change this 11. Here. 11 and four. Let's do I have I have one I can move past four. Let's do Matthias, Dwayne RTO pro Dwayne

Matthias Miller  1:07:10
Okay, And then I

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
um, so that gives us from

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01
what's the, what's the one, right? What's a column? AP,

Matthias Miller  1:08:05
column. AP,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
Ach, routing,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:10
routing. Oh, so that is a number. Okay, got it.

Matthias Miller  1:08:14
It seems like sell OPT, cell option. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:08:19
so, so sell OPT is, that's the, that's the Okay, so it's not the no open one is, I was wrong on so there's your there's your cell authorizations, and aw would be for the primary cell phone in the AX would be, but we don't

Matthias Miller  1:08:35
know what the note the other one is, but seems useful. Customer date we should probably have might be useful.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:45
Entry date, maybe

Matthias Miller  1:08:47
prph, that's not used. Maximum rating, auto charge form, okay, that's the customer stuff. Okay, so let's go see if there's anything else that I think that gets most of that inventory we did, inventory, table master model.

Matthias Miller  1:09:12
We don't use models like this.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
What is it?

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
I think it's something that's like a preset for models, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:24
Nope, disregard.

Matthias Miller  1:09:28
Okay, where's my ACH table. Ach table.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:39
Oh, so this would be the transactions.

Matthias Miller  1:09:47
I mean, I'm guessing we want these.

Speaker 1  1:09:49
Yeah, we're going to want them how we're going to use them again, this, this is, if this is the, if this does not end up in the in the history, the transaction history, then yes, we need. Did. I'm just surprised that, like, is he really building history from, like, a several different tables?

Matthias Miller  1:10:08
Well, I wonder if he's logging in some capacity.

Speaker 1  1:10:19
Can you imagine? Can you imagine if you bought this software a company, and you had to try to learn this thing?

Matthias Miller  1:10:28
No, I can't. No, it's, it's absolutely horrific. It's,

Matthias Miller  1:10:40
maybe we want the confirmation image file. I'm going to say that's basically what we want out of here. But if you want, if you think we need more out of it, then

Speaker 1  1:10:48
we need, we need the sufficient data in order to to, well, we do need AC, because that looks like it's denoting payments to to an NSF. Either that or it became an NSF,

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
yeah, I do have that.

Speaker 1  1:11:04
The account probably there's a rec, no column. What's the Rec? No column. That's the

Matthias Miller  1:11:08
record number. Primary. Got it? Yep, okay. I mean the status, date, this stuff, account type, we don't need to know whether it's checking or savings, routing and bank account. We can't read bank account anywhere at this point. Check number, micro doesn't appear to be used. Entry class. Do we need? Entry class doesn't seem like we need a purchase ID, transaction ID I'm pulling in case store. I mean, it looks like that. I think that's most of what we need there. Yep, deposits. We want deposits.

Speaker 1  1:11:52
Yes, we do what's expand column, C, oh.

Matthias Miller  1:11:58
We want a. We want this.

Speaker 1  1:12:04
Oh, so I'm assuming deposit CC is credit card,

Matthias Miller  1:12:09
the pocat. Pocat. Pocat. Okay, we want the description, which would be a list. Pocat is a list. Trans date.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
What does po cat mean?

Matthias Miller  1:12:29
Purchase, purchase category, or

Speaker 1  1:12:30
I don't know, Poe type, what's the Poe type? One and Two versus two is credit card and one is whatever. I don't know. Okay, so, but there's no, there's no idea as to what account it goes to.

Matthias Miller  1:12:48
That's a separate table, which I found up above, oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53
based on, based on

Matthias Miller  1:12:56
what the Hokie, the we have to be based on the it is the hokey. So the Hokey is actually a primary key in some cases, yeah. What in that

Unknown Speaker  1:13:12
thing? Pick up, pick up, pick up.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:17
Pick a schema. Skim.

Speaker 2  1:13:20
How do you even say that schema, schema

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
or shimmer in ditch?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:29
Do all the Shamma?

Matthias Miller  1:13:31
Oh, we have a temp hokey here. Hey, Jonathan, as he almost hops on, is he almost

Speaker 1  1:13:43
do not enter this call unless your brain wants to melt and looking at database tables.

Speaker 3  1:13:51
Okay, I've worked with Microsoft Access before. I'm immunized.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:59
Yeah, it. I am not I am not immunized, and I just want to be like, what was

Matthias Miller  1:14:08
this guy doing? We have a to do events. Table anyway.

Speaker 1  1:14:13
Oh my. What's an EOD? Explosive Ordinance table,

Matthias Miller  1:14:17
what is EOD? End of end of day end of day numbers, probably we have all kinds of things that are cashed in tables. Because, why? Because I presumably we can't calculate them efficiently enough. I have no idea. Anyway.

Speaker 1  1:14:42
Sean, your life is going to be miserable. How come? Because we're gonna have to stare at some of the most cluttered database tables in your life.

Matthias Miller  1:14:54
Well, he actually doesn't have to do that much in the short term. But yeah, we're getting ready to. Of spec out a whole bunch of dummy detail screens and extra or not dummy, but, well, I mean lightweight storage detail screens and extra use for you to suck in RTO PRO data.

Speaker 4  1:15:11
Ah, gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah, I'm not worried. Yeah. I'm actually kind of looking forward to it, but maybe I should be more scared than I am.

Speaker 1  1:15:19
Look, I know there are people who love this kind of stuff. Just don't put me on this. I will. I will quit tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
Hey, that's fair. That's fair.

Speaker 2  1:15:30
Actions. Seth is always a new place. Every single time he gets on a zoom call, he's somewhere else. That's not true. I mean, every time it's mostly today, yes, well, okay, it's not even have a very listen. I'm a short term memory. I'm like a goldfish.

Speaker 5  1:15:53
95% of the calls I've been on with you, I've been in the same place

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
it took me to get my joke.

Matthias Miller  1:16:07
All right. Well, we've got a hard stop at the bottom of the hour.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:13
I have to go talk to Jonathan's friend,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:16
my friend, who's my friend, Clarence. Oh, clear it.

Matthias Miller  1:16:28
So biggest things the Dwayne and I have been working on, it feels like project has officially shifted to a lot more execution than design. And so I've been working a little bit with Seth, and Seth can update you on everything I've been working with him on. And I have been we do finally have a way to unfreeze the RTO pro backups and suck the data out into CSVs, and we're going through the data model, which is a blend of all kinds of calculations that are frozen into columns so that you don't have to do relational lookups and sometimes copied from other tables. You know, other tables. You don't have to do relational lookups to get numbers out. It's just so it's not always immediately clear where the true where the source of truth actually lies. But we're probably have about 80% of, well, I don't know, maybe 60 to 8060. To 90% of the fields flag that we that we need. So that's kind of what life is like on our end.

Speaker 5  1:17:36
Catch up on our side, I've been mainly working on calculations with Matthias. So splitting stuff taxable versus well not taxable versus non taxable, that makes things confusing, but having macros for calculations with and without tax, so that's been a big thing. We were wrestling with EPO for a while yesterday, and have some more wrestling to do, especially once you realize that, oh, wait, we're gonna have to figure non taxable fees separately so that we don't apply tax on non taxable fees at the end. But we're getting there. That's you can you can freeze

Speaker 1  1:18:18
it all in a bunch of different columns so you don't have to do relational lookups. You relational

Unknown Speaker  1:18:26
lookups. So wait, we build real software.

Speaker 3  1:18:33
I've been working, working on ironing out the the all the different flows, sort of more technical stuff with with clearance, because, you know, when you go to the checkout page, you have saved payment options, and then you also have the form field if you want to add a new payment option. And you know, we obviously want to display that in the clean way, but two very, very, very different things are happening in the back end with the information we have and what we need to do with it. So, so I've been working on that to make sure that we're headed the right direction with that. So yeah, that's most of what I've been doing, also just paying down a bit of technical debt, and Matthias was code reviewed my stuff, so I've done some refactoring with that as well, but hopefully next week, I'll have the whole checkout process working and everything, and then we can update the live system and kind of have that Online. So that's what I've been

Speaker 1  1:19:41
doing. Jonathan, make yourself a note. One of my one of my customer service reps, sent me a note says, Hey, if you are checking out, or if you if you're making a payment for a customer, and you input a credit card, if you input it prompt to ask if you want to. Save it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02
and store it. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:05
Yes, I can add that.

Speaker 3  1:20:12
I assume we would want to display that for external users as well. So if they're logging into the portal and checking out to have that option as well. Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:20:27
okay, I worked some on book depreciation settings, mostly fielding for rental companies, but then also tying that in a little bit. Yeah, it's mostly just Fielding, also dwf stuff on contracts and auto pay still lingering around a little bit with some of the more complex logic for essentially trying to reduce complexity to simplicity and logic for calculating auto pay dates.

Speaker 4  1:20:59
So most of what happened? Yeah, my work has been Yeah, kind of random things throughout the software. One thing was that dwf is now required on the contract definition record. You have to have at least one row for that the manufacturer. Manufacturer premium stuff on the product record has been, yeah, fields have been thrown up there now, and there's some calculations that have been worked in. There's still some more stuff that will need to be done with that, but at least the fields are up there now. Product types have been renamed to more accurate names now, or Yeah, the newer names that you wanted, and there is validation, oh yeah, there's validation now on contract records so that you can only select rentable products. So yeah, that's new.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:59
And on the

Speaker 4  1:22:03
This is, yeah, on the contracts record, I have thrown up a bunch of sales tax fields, mostly without calculations. There's added a few macros, but basically just getting fields in place so that calculations and work can be done to make that work later. So yeah, that's been my work. Matthias.

Speaker 1  1:22:21
Was there a reason on on product types that we went rentable structure and rental other. It seems like we should standardize the nomenclature there.

Speaker 5  1:22:30
They were supposed both supposed to be rentable. I think, okay, so got it. I might have had a typo when I spiked it out or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:41
Or maybe I read it too fast. There's two options here.

Speaker 3  1:22:45
No, I went through, I was reviewing, and I was wondering why on earth the two are different? And I was going to go Devin put Sean. And then I looked at the job memo, and it said it was actually different for the two. So I just said, Well, who might hit the speed with RPO gods?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:01
I think that was a case of Seth mistyping, probably,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:03
yeah, the RTO gods,

Matthias Miller  1:23:08
very arbitrary, capricious God that must say,

Speaker 5  1:23:12
I have it right in one place in the spec and wrong in the other. Sean, you can go, yeah, yeah, deal with the fallout of my, of my typo,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:23
somebody put somebody put sets initials besides it.

Matthias Miller  1:23:35
Cool Nick you've been busy with non CRT stuff, right?

Speaker 2  1:23:45
Yep, Mark was loading. The market was loading up with all kinds of fun zfp stuff, wasn't it?

Speaker 3  1:23:52
I had a grand old time building some very complicated reports.

Speaker 5  1:23:57
We're already two and a half times our normal number of hours for them month. And he said to just keep going.

Speaker 2  1:24:06
Did you do? Did you do any help with the with the bomb rule expressions at all? Did you okay? Because, like, that was supposed to be the whole intent of you going out there. He's like, and then I heard, like, Mark's like, oh, we said, do this and do that and do that. I was like, I'll bet they never even did

Speaker 3  1:24:22
any bomb. I did. I did help Aaron with bomb rules, and then he was kind of gallivanting off and doing some more. So we did, we did work on that, but there's a whole lot of other stuff we did as

Speaker 5  1:24:31
well. You were, yeah, for like, was it five days you went in, yeah? Something like that. Ink, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:24:37
Wait, is this the first is this the first call since you've been engaged, or was that the last Yeah, last week's call.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:46
Last week, I think

Speaker 1  1:24:47
last, yeah, last. Well, if I didn't say congratulations, I'll say congratulations. I don't remember if I said it or not. Thank

Unknown Speaker  1:24:57
you. Thank you. Okay. Is

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
there anything else? Biggest, I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:25:02
that's awesome. I got, I got three minutes. Three minutes. I

Matthias Miller  1:25:06
think the biggest question from you Seth is, are you guys, where are you guys at on workload? And how soon are you needing more? Are you going to need more stuff from us in the next two weeks? Basically, because that's what we're looking at with thanksgiving, which obviously you guys are going to be lower capacity as

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22
well, but we're going to be a fair bit lower capacity.

Speaker 5  1:25:30
I think there's probably enough stuff, especially if we're you can, because January spec, there are things in there. We can move ahead on if we need to. We're needing to some of the big pieces yet. We need to work on you, and I need to work on EPO a bit more. I think the calculation side is getting close, but I'm sure we're going to find wrinkles to iron out due date calculation, or due date calculations we need to get in. And I want to work on, automatically adding rows to the event searching. And then Nick is doing work with depreciation and working sales, and Sean and him right are working sales tax through. And then Jonathan always has whiskey stuff. So I think we have a decent bit of

Speaker 3  1:26:17
work, yeah, but I'm close to wanting some more spec on the whole like external user authentication workflow. I'm not sure. I know there's some basic spec in the proposal, but unless Justin is going to do that quickly, which I assume, he's not going to have that done until early December, then I might want to meet you up and try to give it more of a complete spec of exactly what those what that flow looks like. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
Well, ping me if you need something, I'm going to be out most of Wednesday.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:04
Go ahead. Can I drop

Unknown Speaker  1:27:06
Yes. Thank you, sir. Thanks guys.

Matthias Miller  1:27:10
Ping me if you need anything, I'm mostly out Wednesday through Friday of next week, and Tuesday is my Yeah. Happy to happy to do that. Let's just spend it good Seth, I want to chat with you just briefly on assist stuff, yep, for a few minutes if you got

Unknown Speaker  1:27:35
good thank you guys.

Matthias Miller  1:27:41
Is there anything on the is there anything that we need to get done for this update? This week, we have the discrepant, the accounting Impact Report,

Speaker 5  1:27:52
yeah, let me see. We have, I feel like most of the things we have so many niggling little paper cuts. But the beautiful thing is, I just keep throwing them to Sean, and he keeps cutting them, ignoring old stripe. Payout, payout, exactly, exactly. I just threw it to him and it happened, and Nick found a bug when he reviewed it, and then I skimmed over it looks great.

Matthias Miller  1:28:25
Love it. Customer deposits. Accounting impacts is a, is a, is one that would be nice to have live by the weekend. The errors report probably can wait.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:39
So what were we needing with customer deposits. Yet

Matthias Miller  1:28:42
we have a we have, it appears to me like we have a discrepancy between day, end of day handling on that, and we just need to reconcile that.

Speaker 5  1:28:57
Is it customer deposits, or is it sorry? This, this is a customer deposits.

Matthias Miller  1:29:07
We have a refund. The refund was issued on the day of cancelation, and it's, it's effect, it's, it's coming out of customer deposits instead of accounts receivable.

Speaker 5  1:29:19
Oh, but which? It's a different incident. It's not the customer deposits incident. It's the AR report. AR, okay, okay, okay, now I'm tracking.

Matthias Miller  1:29:29
I think that's the only thing so I have, I would have 30 minutes now. I would have some time at five o'clock. I could potentially do some time. I don't know what do you want to do? You want to do tomorrow? Okay, let's do now

Speaker 5  1:29:45
be good to hit EPO. Then too, at some point

Matthias Miller  1:29:50
I'm gonna have some time on Tuesday. Tuesday AM, okay. Are you free? Okay, I should be out early, 8am

Speaker 5  1:30:02
I mean, if you tell me what works well for you, because I can, I can flex.

Matthias Miller  1:30:07
I mean, I'll start the best time at this day, my day basically is full after 10 Central, okay, okay, so doing eight would probably work well for me. Okay, yeah, we can do that. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:30:41
So, so account impact, the invoice rows are considered the ones prior to cancelation.

Matthias Miller  1:31:10
So cancelation is considered to be morning of Amy to count you up.

Matthias Miller  1:31:24
Is in a R,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:27
doing share screen?

Matthias Miller  1:31:28
Yes, sure. So we have accounting impact invoice rows are considered anything prior to the to cancelation, at which point we reverse them at the point of cancelation, okay, but okay, that's The thing that's a little weird. Here it was invoice. We had a payment on the 29th it was invoiced on the 29th so invoice increases AR, decreases AR. It was canceled. It reverses AR. But we never moved. We never move the funds from AR to deposit. That's the real issue. So on the cancelation,

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
if voiced, Rose 29 ninth,

Matthias Miller  1:32:52
invoicing accounting impact. Okay, this is invoicing, not payments, so payment accounting impact, if it is, are we just literally never removing it from customer deposit, never moving into customer deposits.

Speaker 5  1:33:34
Well, the payment wasn't that payment after the day, after invoicing, yes, and so it goes to AR Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:33:47
And when we do invoicing customer, we have a when we when we invoice, we look at the deposit and we convert it into accounts receivable, but we don't do the reverse on cancelation.

Speaker 5  1:34:12
Well, and aren't we looking at the payment accounting date? No. Okay, never mind invoicing, which it won't

Matthias Miller  1:34:33
be right, this is it is on invoicing and cancelation happen morning of and so any payments on that date would technically payments refunds would be customer deposits. So we basically need to take this amount here

Matthias Miller  1:34:59
and. It and transfer that from well, we need to do one of two things, one payments after cancelation, okay, it's not right. It's not really right for payments after payments, refunds after cancelation, to be an AR, because it's not. It's not receivable anymore. Really the right thing is in the cancelation here to add an entry.

Matthias Miller  1:35:48
The real question is, how do we get what is the simplest way to get it was invoice. E, S and A on it,

Matthias Miller  1:36:13
B, payment, gross amount.

Matthias Miller  1:36:28
I don't know that we're handling I

Matthias Miller  1:36:47
I don't know that we're handling owns, write offs correctly. I

Speaker 5  1:37:50
so is the problem? Because the refund is on the day it was canceled.

Matthias Miller  1:37:57
No, I don't think so. I think it happens regardless. No, okay, well, it would mean we're never converting payments. I don't see any place, yeah, if the refund would be before it would work. But we're never converting accounts receivable into a customer deposit. Wait, can't we just use

Matthias Miller  1:38:28
so accounting balance? Why would you

Unknown Speaker  1:38:31
convert accounts receivable to a customer deposit when you cancel? Oh, it's when you cancel. I

Matthias Miller  1:38:43
Yeah, because it's no longer it's no longer receivable. I mean, it's no longer like it's it goes from asset to a liability. Now have to pay them back,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:57
right? Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:39:00
Um, why couldn't we okay, this is, this is the, here's the idea. Do we have a, do we have a sales order impact, thing that we can steal? Should we do somewhere?

Matthias Miller  1:39:32
So this is 1120,

Matthias Miller  1:39:48
so then this one, we're going to start.

Matthias Miller  1:39:57
This guy, we're going to delete. Delete this guy. Okay, and then we're going to do this guy.

Matthias Miller  1:40:20
Okay, so here I'm going to suggest that we do a

Matthias Miller  1:40:45
and we're only running this if We've invoiced, and then here should have a concat. I'm

Speaker 5  1:41:34
did balance at calculation? Sorry, cancelation, include the refunds that happened the day of cancelation. No, and we're

Matthias Miller  1:41:52
actually going to flip everything, because everything would have changed earlier. So customer deposits, accounts receivable, we're just Going to go,

Matthias Miller  1:42:13
Okay, we have the I'm

Matthias Miller  1:42:47
well, I suppose you could Do

Matthias Miller  1:43:03
this guy can go, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:43:24
this is fun.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:30
It's a

Unknown Speaker  1:43:39
lot. Have we not seen it? Noticed it before?

Matthias Miller  1:43:43
I have no idea. We've not tried to reconcile AR in customer deposits. Yes, I can dance a lot. Okay, so let's do. Let's do. Here's the 2025, one. We have six. Well, it was paid, paid on 710, invoiced. 519, so we had anything canceled on 10, nine. That does not look right. I know what my problem is, no accounts receivable, sales order. Maybe this would help. Was.

Matthias Miller  1:45:22
Okay. So here 2023, 25 let's go find a short 2020, well, maybe not. Okay. So here we have a it was paid the old one, 519, to 10, nine. Okay, so on the cancelation side, here we

Unknown Speaker  1:45:40
have ar,

Matthias Miller  1:45:43
ar AR, and then we cancel and we take It Out of AR

Matthias Miller  1:45:55
22 but AR netted zero, at the time of invoicing

Speaker 5  1:46:07
AR is something's wrong because on sales order cancelation, we're netting zero on AR Just

Matthias Miller  1:46:19
because we want the accounting balance, not the total limits and write offs, yeah. And let's do this date sorts, sort string, sort string, so cancelation date plus date, sort string, invoice date. And let's reverse sort and let's save

Matthias Miller  1:47:06
Next time, we're just going to run it for 2025,

Matthias Miller  1:47:15
to burly, let's go to a simple one here. So we have it was paid. We have three payments. It was never invoiced. It was canceled. So we only need to do this. It's

Matthias Miller  1:47:45
obviously, if it was never invoice, we would never

Unknown Speaker  1:47:59
say or instead of and there, if the invoice date is blank or the

Matthias Miller  1:48:07
Yes, I do I'm moving too fast. I

Unknown Speaker  1:48:20
mean, that's looking a lot better. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:48:25
okay, let's go find a simple one. This guy. Okay, so it was invoiced. It was invoiced on the six it's created an AR of 845 and then here we had 845, ar, and then on cancelation, we it's because of this that's just dumb again, no account impact receivable on the cancelation.

Matthias Miller  1:49:12
All sales order CD is the customer deposits.

Matthias Miller  1:49:25
Invoice, no, but we reverse that. That's the problem. We reverse. We want the difference. We need the difference in balance. Because if we're we're reversing

Unknown Speaker  1:49:41
to reverse invoice.

Matthias Miller  1:50:23
Okay, this should even have fewer.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:35
It's looking pretty comparable.

Matthias Miller  1:50:46
Is pretty comparable. So we had a payment. This doesn't have any payments. So how is this even?

Unknown Speaker  1:50:57
The balance is somehow different.

Matthias Miller  1:51:00
Sales tax, yes, because the so accounting balance is looking at the deposit, the deposit

Unknown Speaker  1:51:11
sales tax, jurisdiction changes, or

Matthias Miller  1:51:13
no, no, it's, it's because the accounting balance takes, takes invoicing and cancelation into account. So Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:26
because it's zero, it's zero. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:51:48
Assume accounting total as of so we just need to do, okay, this is not the end all, be all, but posit some That's correct.

Matthias Miller  1:52:15
Wait, why can't we use payments and write offs as of

Unknown Speaker  1:52:26
that one's date sensitive, isn't, I mean, isn't? Oh that way, that seems, yeah, I think that I

Unknown Speaker  1:53:00
a May Hey, maybe, okay, yeah, third as many,

Matthias Miller  1:53:11
find, find me a short one. There are no short ones, okay, so here we have a cancelation where we Move.

Matthias Miller  1:53:32
We never moved anything big.

Matthias Miller  1:53:40
So we had, here, let's go pull up the actual sales order. So we had invoice on the 24th canceled on the 18th,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:52
so refunded

Matthias Miller  1:53:55
and refunded on the 18th. So we should have, I mean here, sales order CD zeroes out accounts receivable. See accounts receivable left to 1704, stranded. Here, it zeros out. Now it's a little weird, slightly weird to have that

Unknown Speaker  1:54:33
you like transaction,

Matthias Miller  1:54:36
yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:42
It sure makes it easier to track down when you do all if you'd look at transactions,

Matthias Miller  1:54:51
it's fair.

Matthias Miller  1:54:59
Otherwise we need. Split out. I mean, I think that. I think the answer here is basically,

Matthias Miller  1:55:21
and then this is, and

Matthias Miller  1:55:40
then, ideally, what we would do is write a report that looks at the net impact, net account impact, wherever we have that macro you're saying, Yeah, okay, you think

Speaker 5  1:55:58
it's going to be different. Aren't all of these going to have a different net account impact.

Matthias Miller  1:56:04
They will all have a different one. But the idea would be that we could track that. Okay, here I'll show you what I'm trying to say. If I do, I do this, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:56:26
Can I group by account? You should see AR, it leaves AR, it got some deposit, non zero, currently, currently? Yeah, and if we do this right, then these should zero out in this column. It'd be another way of verifying our changes, like net account mismatch errors, but net account impact settings. Maybe there's one in here,

Matthias Miller  1:57:08
impacted net.

Matthias Miller  1:57:15
Well,

Matthias Miller  1:57:47
know we are doing encountered and expected. This is both and

Matthias Miller  1:57:56
so this is encountered.
