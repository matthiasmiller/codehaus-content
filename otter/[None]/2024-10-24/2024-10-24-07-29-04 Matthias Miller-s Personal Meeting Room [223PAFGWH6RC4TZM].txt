Unknown Speaker  01:30
Hey, good morning. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  01:37
Good morning.

Matthias Miller  01:39
Anything new and exciting in Ohio.

Unknown Speaker  01:44
Yeah, I have my truck almost done. I replaced the frame rail in my truck.

Matthias Miller  01:49
Oh, you did it. You're not forsaking your accounting expertise in literally doing it.

Speaker 1  02:01
Yeah, I did actually literally do it. Oh, wow. But yeah, Saturdays and evenings for a little while, but it's a Tundra from the days when their frames rusted out. So just total rust bucket. Like, yeah, it's like, when the metal falls apart. Like, you know what that is? Like, the moisture and steel very well, and they, they just disappear. Oh, you guys out there,

Matthias Miller  02:39
yeah, we always, we always look, look with a little bit of skepticism for any vehicles coming, coming from your direction.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
Oh, there's good reason why.

Matthias Miller  02:55
In addition to that, that's interesting. In addition to that, we have a almost cult, like water religion around here. So they don't actually salt the roads here. They throw down gravel and a few intersections, but yeah, so that makes an impact. So how many, how many weeks has this been in? Or how long has this been in the works for

Speaker 1  03:17
you? Um, it's been in the works for what are we about? Third week of October, um, end of August, I think was about when I started it. So about two months. I mean it, you know, some weeks you have one evening you can work on it, and other weeks you have two, and some you have none. And there were two Saturdays that I was going to weddings or other things and, you know, so it's just yeah, thankfully, it was something that could kind of sit like that, but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:54
oh no, I probably have 30 hours in it. I would guess somewhere in that neighborhood,

Matthias Miller  04:02
you'll have to figure out something to do to celebrate, that's for sure, once, once it's all squared away.

Unknown Speaker  04:15
Maybe we should give him some suggestion. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:21
that was a celebration

Matthias Miller  04:24
that would be, you're not you're not walking everywhere you were

Unknown Speaker  04:30
maybe 18 or so, you could do some burnout.

Unknown Speaker  04:36
Are we talking about

Unknown Speaker  04:39
sales tax, obviously, definitely not

Unknown Speaker  04:42
sales tax. I hear something about 30 hours and something and burnouts, and

Speaker 1  04:50
I, I replaced the frame rail in my tundra, and just finished it up last night. I'm besides an alignment. So. So anyway, that's what we were discussing. Nice frame had been all rusted out, so it's kind of a hot thing.

Matthias Miller  05:21
Well, sounds

Unknown Speaker  05:22
like Seth has some

Speaker 2  05:26
exciting things to show. So my suggestion would be, we run through the small stuff quickly. I don't think it'll take very long, and then we spend most of our time on sales tax reporting, that's you should have gotten an agenda. So let's just start with that. And so next week, we're on for Wednesday, 130 to three. And then I wanted to see about November. Are we good? Seventh, 14th, 21st to do the regular 930, day 11.

Matthias Miller  06:09
Let me take a look.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
Objection for the seventh, but the other shooter,

Matthias Miller  06:21
yeah, I'm gonna be out on the seventh as well. But, and actually the fifth and the sixth I could do. The fourth is pretty open up until three,

Unknown Speaker  06:42
yeah, or Yeah.

Speaker 2  06:46
Always do Wednesday, the week or so, yeah, we will, is there?

Speaker 1  06:54
I it'd be fine with me to just skip that week, but I don't know what I'll have, where we'll be at.

Speaker 2  06:59
Well, that all, yeah, if we, depends where we're do we think we're going to be at a place where we need that on sales tax reporting, like we start using it? We, maybe we, maybe we should come back to that

Matthias Miller  07:19
after I do we want to here's my proposal. It's easier to throw something on the calendar now and take it off than it is to let me fill it up or anybody else fill it up and try to squeeze something in that doesn't fit. I vote for either 11 or one on Monday, the fourth as and just block out the time. Block out 90 minutes. And yeah, I guess one, one,

Unknown Speaker  07:51
good. One to 230

Unknown Speaker  07:55
so 11 four,

Matthias Miller  07:57
I guess that ends up over your lunch stuff.

Speaker 3  08:02
No, I'll be in PA right.

Matthias Miller  08:05
Look at that.

Unknown Speaker  08:08
I'll be in Indiana, so not a big loss there.

Unknown Speaker  08:14
Just to do without,

Matthias Miller  08:16
do without you. That's what we're trying to do, Dwayne, but I don't know. I The

Speaker 2  08:21
14th and 21st Does that look good?

Unknown Speaker  08:29
Let me take two, but you're

Unknown Speaker  08:32
gonna do the 11th and then the 14th,

Matthias Miller  08:36
fourth and then the 14th, oh,

Unknown Speaker  08:38
the fourth, if you're saying the fourth, then yes, I'm

Matthias Miller  08:40
still around. Okay, let me, let me add you one.

Unknown Speaker  08:47
It sounds like a collective groan there. Seth bomber, he's gonna be around.

Speaker 2  08:53
What do you mean? You said you're still gonna be around. Are you? Do you have plans to do some travels in Europe or something?

Speaker 4  09:01
No, no. The following, I thought you were saying the 11th got it on that time frame,

Unknown Speaker  09:11
I would say Europe sounds preferable to

Matthias Miller  09:16
Indiana, judgmental.

Unknown Speaker  09:17
Maybe

Speaker 4  09:21
neither, neither place sounds real preferable in November, unless you're going to do like the south of France, or, you know, south of Italy. Maybe, yeah,

Speaker 3  09:31
we did Italy in December, one time it was kind of cold, but it was worth it.

Matthias Miller  09:39
Iceland.

Matthias Miller  09:47
What about the week of Thanksgiving? Do we want to pick a pick a time for that week? Or wait until we get closer see where things are at?

Speaker 2  09:56
I would suggest we wait till we're closer. I mean it. We have the sales tax reporting thing behind us. I could see where we we may just be able to skip that. So I'd say if we've got the fourth, 14th, 21st nailed down, then we're good. 14th and 21st through the 930, to 11, right?

Matthias Miller  10:19
Let's see. Let's see the wait. The Yeah, 14th and 21st Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 2  10:27
Okay, good. So if we go down to the agenda book value of assets, so this is live and working, I understand is there and drew. Maybe you have we didn't even have a chance to look at this. But Did, did you look at that like the change that Seth made?

Speaker 1  10:56
When was the last change on it? Was it over the weekend?

Speaker 3  11:01
No, I think it's, let me check. It should have been a while. I think,

Speaker 1  11:08
I mean, because as of just Monday or end of last week, I forget it was still, it was still not the well, I guess we're talking about value. That's right, including

Unknown Speaker  11:27
the sale of

Speaker 3  11:28
the did you change the sale transaction to be a sale type?

Speaker 1  11:40
Because yeah, no on the book value thing, I did not look at it.

Speaker 2  11:45
I wonder if it said, if it might be just, you know, worth taking a few minutes and doing a screen walking us through that. Are you saying we have to go back and edit that sale? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:00
So it's just on the transaction, yeah, I could

Unknown Speaker  12:03
just share the 449, house or the probably be the

Unknown Speaker  12:12
um, trying to remember,

Unknown Speaker  12:15
it's managing asset or asset management,

Speaker 3  12:18
yeah, but Is it? Oh yes, shed time k, I always forget which one it is, and then include solder abandoned. And then this one.

Speaker 3  12:36
Okay, so this one is the one that was the sale, right? Yeah, okay, I think so if you set asset sale or abandonment, which normally I would, if you use the new transaction for sale or abandonment, it'll populate what it thinks it should be here, which this is whacked because of this other transaction, and then set the type automatically.

Unknown Speaker  13:12
But so if we set the type here, I think, Okay, this is not, I mean, this will show value change. That's fine. Okay, I don't know if that number's right, but it's at least closer.

Speaker 2  13:37
Is that? So we're saying the asset value is, is 141 Well,

Speaker 3  13:41
this was the purchase cost. The current book value is $0 because it's been sold, yeah, but we have purchase cost depreciation that doesn't have any link depreciation, right? No impairment. But we had,

Speaker 2  13:58
we showed it was like 20,000 so I'm wondering, is this because

Speaker 1  14:03
we expense the loss, so it should be now showing zero? No,

Speaker 2  14:08
I'm but the purchase cost is lower than what I would like. The purchase cost, I want to say, like one, almost 180 like what we had, the cost we incurred in the asset. Is that because it's grouped like it's part of an asset group?

Unknown Speaker  14:38
Is this the same thing?

Unknown Speaker  14:40
Oh, yeah,

Speaker 2  14:41
I think that's why I think we have that in the 12. Yeah, those two, okay,

Speaker 1  14:46
yeah, so that's going to take a little bit of work to because we'll have to, I add to those journals to try to bring that whole group together. But yeah, it looks like that would be worth. Can go, I mean there, if we ignore the if we ignore the group, then that's right.

Unknown Speaker  15:08
Good. So yeah, that, yeah, good.

Speaker 2  15:20
So if we drop down to the paper cut projects, the drew this is the one that you checked on Monday that was not working yet, and that was because Josh did not do an update over the weekend. Oh, okay,

Unknown Speaker  15:37
that was you reached out to Seth last week about the making. So the list of be linked only show. They're only supposed to show assets, not yet.

Speaker 1  15:55
Not yet in service, not yet. Yeah. So if there's future date or no date, it should show up.

Speaker 3  16:03
I think I made the change. I think it'll come through. Then once, yeah, and then I made the status on a vendor invoice required as well.

Unknown Speaker  16:13
Would that go live? Next update as well? Yeah, good. I

Speaker 2  16:25
um, anything, anything else on, or any updates on three, four or five, or the rest of these items.

Speaker 3  16:38
I didn't do anything with the rest. Okay, I had I was pretty buckled down on sales tax, sure.

Speaker 2  16:46
So eight, I wanted to look at scheduling a meeting for which we've now moved that meeting to 11 for Dwayne you said that dozer does not work for you on the fourth, November,

Speaker 4  17:00
November 4. The fourth does, but the 11th of November does not. Okay.

Speaker 2  17:07
Well, I would be hopeful that by the fourth, we are in a place where we can spend a good bit of time here. So I would say, Let's plan to to cover the FGI actual cost thing.

Unknown Speaker  17:22
November 4 that you this was, um surrounding around repo buildings. And, yeah, we talked about this maybe two weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago, and you wanted to see if

Speaker 2  17:46
how we can better, what we can do to to better handle repo buildings. The problem was, they have a brothers not do repo buildings thing. The problem was initially they have so you have the same standard when it initially you have just the standard cost, like the raw materials and labor, and then you you basically the companies are buying it back at a different price, and now you need to re enter so

Speaker 4  18:25
Mark we could get, we could get incredibly rich with the amount of RTO companies out there. If we design software that gets 99% of people to actually pay for their buildings, and we go to a 1% repo rate, we would, we could. We could really make some money.

Unknown Speaker  18:40
Well, I can think of a lot of unethical ways that you could maybe

Unknown Speaker  18:47
that that automatic missile wonk

Speaker 4  18:50
Seth is really good at this, at this stuff. Maybe, maybe he could design some sort of AI bot that just, you know,

Speaker 2  18:59
I heard this, this story recently from a hauler that went to repo a building. I guess a lot of these are, are there's kind of this rough, rough group of haulers that kind of, I don't know. And so the guy went to repo the building, and next thing he knew, he woke up in in the ditch nearby. So the custom out and clobbered him with a bat or something, I don't know. And so they so next time they went back to get the building, him and all his buddies, I guess, went and then they were armed, and so, you know, they were really gonna take, take care of business, and they did. And then customer came out, paid the thing off in cash.

Speaker 4  19:55
You're you're implying that we start the RTO mafia hit squad. You.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Oh, no,

Speaker 4  20:05
bunch of haulers with bats coming out there breaking people's knees to get them to pay for their buildings. We don't need software.

Matthias Miller  20:12
It might be easier. Might be easier than that, just once, once they're there, you know, 30 days behind or something. Start doing daily, daily, daily charges. So you try 500 bucks, it fails. 250 and hey, if you can only collect the dollar a day, you're still making progress. So you might

Unknown Speaker  20:30
need, you might need to turn off the recording for the rest of this conversation,

Matthias Miller  20:33
right? We don't

Unknown Speaker  20:37
need a paper trail on this one. This gets people put in jail.

Matthias Miller  20:45
Man,

Speaker 2  20:48
alright, well, let's plan to cover that on the fourth then, unless we're talking unless we have things that are more pressing. Thanks. So good. Judy, you have something else that you had to okay, then I think unless you guys have something we're we're ready to look at sales tax reporting. Oh, Matthias, I added your notes to sales tax reporting. I guess the one who would wouldn't go there, but C, D and E, so if you want to cover those now or later your volume.

Matthias Miller  21:24
I don't, I don't care. Let's, let's do the demo, as long as, yeah, as long as we get to it, let's do walk through and see what shows up. You

Unknown Speaker  21:36
want me to share? Matthias, yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:38
I think, I think so. And I guess it would be easier if you get more data in your test system, your local system.

Speaker 3  21:44
I have way more data in my local system. Let's, let's do the local system, rather than data set up for sales tax. Anyway, right. Okay, now I need to get that booted up, because I did not have it running yet this morning. I

Unknown Speaker  22:08
one second.

Unknown Speaker  22:21
Okay,

Speaker 3  22:25
trying to think what the I've been running this. And there's probably all sorts of weird I just because we can't ping tax start actually, from here, I've just been throwing numbers in. So I don't know that how accurate stuff is, but

Unknown Speaker  22:45
I'm not quite sure how to I'll just show you what we got. So got the sales tax history. RG,

Speaker 3  22:59
this will not be editable in detail screen, but store a whole bunch of information on here. Josh added, sorry, just

Matthias Miller  23:11
for a little bit of context. So every time every end of period for every vendor you're going to go in, select the Period End Date and say, basically, go calculate sales tax liability, and it will, yep, menu item. So you choose the vendor,

Speaker 3  23:32
and then it doesn't, I mean, we calculate the date, we have a list of dates based on there's a new system switch to say when to start calculating sales tax from. And then, depending on their filing frequency, we show a list of dates, and if you've already run it once, and we say rerun. So you know that, Oh, you did this already, it won't be problematic. Well, it's not going to create duplicated rows or anything.

Unknown Speaker  23:59
It will just change what's there. Well,

Speaker 3  24:01
if there's something, if anything has changed since you ran it, it'll it'll add a new row, adjusting to what it thinks it should be.

Speaker 2  24:13
The list of like sales tax vendors come from. Those are

Speaker 3  24:20
so on the menu we have sales tax vendors here basically already put a couple in for you, yeah, I saw a few, yeah, um, basically it's a contact type of vendor. It will need to have the company payment type. And then down here it'll have to fill in the state, and they have to be unique by state. And then it'll require this, and you have these check boxes as well, which this affects how we do reporting on the main report. Then

Speaker 4  24:53
how are you handling? How are you handling destination versus location based sales tax? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  25:02
I don't know how does it currently get handled? Well, I

Speaker 4  25:05
mean, it is state by state requirements. So like in the case of Indiana, I think those are location based sales tax. I think Ohio and North Carolina are both destination based. I would expect you're going to want that as part of the I mean, it's, it's currently, it's currently handled based on, on what tax jar is giving back to us. But I wonder if we ought to denote that as part of the record, what type of

Matthias Miller  25:33
just so you know, because tax jar, we're just going based on what tax jar says. So I'm assuming that if it's location based, texter says, Oh, well, this is, yeah, boxville, whatever, always instead of the destination.

Speaker 1  25:50
Well, whatever the nothing with, there's nothing with filing like the destination versus origination is all about like, calculating that sales tax like, so that's the tax jar thing. The actual reporting of the sales tax doesn't matter. It's just per county, you know. So whether it was the origination in that county or the destination in that county, it just goes by whatever tax jar says is supposed to be applied. That's fair.

Matthias Miller  26:29
So it seems to me to mostly be informational for Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so then at the point that you calculate liabilities, if you want to jump back to sales order. That's sales tax, sorry, in the sales tax history, that's when the sales tax history rows get added. So you can make change, change, change, change onto the sales order. And then somebody goes and calculates liabilities, and then it says, Oh, well, let's go look at everything that changed and figure out what it or let's go figure out who's liable at what rate and for what dollar amount. And let's go amend, create amendment rows to get this thing squared away

Speaker 4  27:14
so that that's what writes the RG was not it doesn't necessarily write RG rows on basis on change the sales order. No, Okay, gotcha

Speaker 3  27:24
now we expect it to basically be run after the should be run after the period ends, and then you just run it and populate it. And really probably should only run it once. I mean, maybe you'll run it and then realize, oh, wait, this sales orders wrong for the wrong district or something, then you could run it again. It would work fine, but I would hope that normally you just need to run it once and then so that would fill this stuff in which the values we're pulling for tax are from New fielding that Josh added in the live system, you'll be able to just click this ping and save the record, and it'll automatically update this if you think the rates might have changed.

Speaker 4  28:11
Will it also update the sales tax rate field? But on the, on the on the detail screen there? Not, yeah,

Speaker 3  28:21
not sure. I don't know what his logic for that is. I can. Let me make a note. It's

Speaker 4  28:25
fine. I asked Josh some of these things on Wednesday, and he said, it, it does. I have some, I have some thoughts on how to use this outside of the sales tax, but that's outside of this conversation. So don't, don't spend time

Speaker 3  28:41
looking so he said it will update the tax rate. That's

Speaker 4  28:45
what he said. And I'm hoping, I'm hoping that's correct, because it would make, it would make creation of sales orders on the manual side for miscellaneous type sales, or 10 times easier if, if that actually works that way.

Unknown Speaker  28:59
Let me just make a note. It's

Unknown Speaker  29:00
outside of this conversation.

Speaker 2  29:04
But for for, like, just your typical Chad sales order, when would you use that ink? Would it only be like you think it might have changed so you want

Speaker 3  29:19
to Yes. Do you know more? I feel like that's Josh's land. I'm not quite sure

Matthias Miller  29:24
there's an X 3030, that let me pull it up, the texture stuff. Text, your service, texture, response, import. I a tax Yeah, is that so tax rate on the main screen? Yeah, so that gets updated every time it gets pinged. I think, yeah. I think would go ahead. It

Speaker 4  30:00
is there? Is there a process that we're going to reping all sales orders that we're about to calculate sales tax on?

Matthias Miller  30:10
No, but we might want to set that we do anything that we reping When you invoice a sales order,

Unknown Speaker  30:18
I didn't do anything.

Matthias Miller  30:20
Can you make a note is run a field change expression that when the invoice date actually you could probably have an on change on the invoice date, that whenever it changes to a non blank value, that it pings tax jar or or just get set.

Matthias Miller  30:53
I mean, the plan was, the plan was that we would do it automatically when it gets invoiced, which would be a couple days post delivery, and then you don't really need to after that, and that's the rate that you should be using. If taxes go up until you file, you should still be using the old rate, right?

Speaker 4  31:15
That was gonna be my next question. DREW. Is that, is that? How is that, how sales tax is, or is it at the point of of paying that you have to encapsulate the new rate?

Speaker 1  31:25
No, it would be as of the day of sale, as of Day of sale.

Speaker 2  31:32
And so if we, if we automate that, if we automatically ping when we invoice, that should, that should allow us to take care of like the ER site, pretty much right away, because the potential exists that I don't know if you were on for this Wayne or not, but the potential does exist Once we go live with this that the customer gets a sales order at the time of sale, and that's really the only physical copy he might see. And so he pays based off of that. Let's say that the sales tax rate was 7% so he pays that amount, and then, you know, he pays the remaining balance, day of delivery, and then a day later, we invoice, and the tax rate is going up to Saturn, to border. Then it looks like he short paid. And basically what we're going to do is the thought is we would handle that as a as a just a short payment or an underpayment. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:43
let me just eat it, yeah, yeah, well, yeah,

Speaker 4  32:45
the potential exists for overages and underages and so therefore, we'll just handle like we've been handling those types of things,

Speaker 2  32:53
yeah, on the on the front side, underneath the hood, though, we'll have to handle it'll be handled slightly different because it, yeah, so that we lower the so if we're short, paid $10 because of that, then we're not eating the food $10 we're just, we're going to the state and saying, Oh, By the way, because we short, we didn't collect the full amount you're only going to get.

Speaker 1  33:28
We don't. We don't have to pay the sales tax on the part that we're short paid, right?

Speaker 4  33:31
Gotcha. So you're gonna, you're gonna manipulate sales order to zero it out so we don't have to concur. That is that what you're saying,

Speaker 1  33:43
you might I forget if we were going to do that automatically, or if you're going to have to write in a underpayment adjustment, RJ,

Speaker 3  33:52
you're going to have to add a row, or a payment method that has a new field. I

Unknown Speaker  34:05
uh, the Adjust sales tax liability for bad debt.

Unknown Speaker  34:09
Oh, okay,

Speaker 3  34:12
so if you add a payment row for that, then sales tax will automatically calculate correctly

Speaker 4  34:18
what have, what happens in the case of an overage, so the customer, for whatever reason, they paid us too much and we're writing that off. Do we pay sales tax on that, or is? Is

Speaker 1  34:28
that's a bonus? Okay? Now, if we, if we collect too much sales tax, in other words, if, if we charge them too much sales tax, and they pay it. We need to pay that in but if they just gave us an extra 20 bucks, we just go have coffee and enjoy the 20 bucks,

Matthias Miller  34:54
or you pay down somebody else's RTO. Yeah, I.

Speaker 4  35:00
That can set, can you set it up, on, on, on some of these overages like that, that it automatically generates gift cards out to random people, you know, like me and Mark and Drew, and just those three. Just those three. Nobody else. It just, you know, every time there's an over, it just sends out a card. The

Unknown Speaker  35:22
recording, still on. Dwayne,

Speaker 4  35:29
can you delete that part? Matthias, now

Matthias Miller  35:35
you're gonna ask for my data retention policy.

Unknown Speaker  35:42
Oh, on the now, back on to the recording,

Speaker 4  35:52
like we're on, like an interview thing, okay, this is off the record. That's on the record.

Speaker 2  35:59
The other day, Dwayne and I were on the on dialed head, and my phone was was not working well, but we got back on. It was pretty good. When we're talking about the presidential election, he was saying, you know, why Harris? He just said, like, well, she's such a terrible candidate, like that, the lion like, everything cut out.

Speaker 4  36:19
Okay? It was pretty consistent. Every single time that we tried to talk about the election, the line would cut off. And so the last time I said, You know what, we're not supposed to be talking about this, and we went on and talked about business, and never cut off after that. I think, I think that proves my conspiracy theory.

Matthias Miller  36:38
That's funny. I uh, so I have friends who would eat that up. Go ahead. No kidding.

Speaker 1  36:49
They might have published it in the what was that newspaper Epoch Times, if I publish

Speaker 1  37:00
so on the on the ping button. If we're going to reping, it's going to need to reping as of the invoice date, you know, like, say the invoice date was changed for some odd reason or something like, but anyway, if it's a reping, it should still reping As of the invoice date, not as of the current day. So I don't know if there's a possibility like that or not. So if you're repaying, you just take the risk. I guess

Matthias Miller  37:28
you take the risk. I don't

Speaker 3  37:35
see invoice date change itch we can make so it automatically repings. I mean, that's what we're planning on, that if invoice date is that or change, then it'll, it will automatically repay.

Speaker 2  37:49
But when it pings tax, probably the only option we have when paying tax dollars, we just say, pay tax, or what's the rate today? Like, we can't or can we go back in time? Like, let's,

Matthias Miller  38:01
let me take a quick look.

Speaker 2  38:03
Just the one we're looking at here. I'm thinking, so if we change the the invoice date to 910 and we said reping, oh, would it? It probably would ping as of 1024

Unknown Speaker  38:18
Yeah, I'm assuming so

Matthias Miller  38:23
I think when I could dig into this briefly, I think the real thing that you should do is ask Josh If you can ping as of a specific date. Um, and then, yeah, sorry. Well,

Speaker 2  38:52
I think if, if tax jar doesn't allow us to do that, then I think we should build it so that, if, if we, if you try to ping, like in this one, it would say it would just, it wouldn't ping for today, because it potential exists if you like it. Would you say if, if you have no invoice date, or the invoice date equals today,

Speaker 1  39:22
then think, yeah, but then it's pointless having that ping button, because, I mean, isn't that button always going to be an after the fact use?

Unknown Speaker  39:31
I think Dwayne has some uses where

Speaker 4  39:35
don't take away the ping button. Okay, because what I want to end, okay, so this whole thing of selling car ports and some other misleads has become really a pain in the butt on the configurator side, and so I just want to be able to generate manual sales orders and be able to ping for tax jar for the sales tax rate without having to go, like, open up sales tax calculator from tax jar and go figure. You know, manually figure it out. It would just, it would speed up a whole lot of things, if I could just ping sales orders. So I really, I was, I was really excited when I saw the ping button. I may or may not have pushed it a couple times to see if it works.

Unknown Speaker  40:17
Does it work yet? Does not okay?

Matthias Miller  40:22
Should we? Should we push the ping back in, into the texture Screen button?

Unknown Speaker  40:26
I wonder if it should disappear off the main

Unknown Speaker  40:31
I'm fine with that.

Matthias Miller  40:33
Yeah, let's do it. Except or No, should

Speaker 3  40:36
it drop into here, not here? What's don't, because don't, don't

Speaker 4  40:42
put it too far away, because I want sales reps to be able to find it whenever they're creating a sales order. I don't care if you take it off of immediate like I don't. I don't care if you put it on the tax like putting it on the tax Chart button might not be a bad idea.

Speaker 3  40:58
I'm not sure if this is sticking around as my thing, because Josh building here that business tax chart, I wonder if it should go in there, but because that would be clear, because that's what it's actually updating, right? Or am I wrong? Yeah, right. Is that

Matthias Miller  41:18
good? Or should we just leave it out there? I didn't know sales reps needed it. So

Unknown Speaker  41:23
I'm I'm ambivalent. Okay,

Speaker 3  41:26
should we restrict it at all or not? Or we don't care.

Matthias Miller  41:30
We don't care. Okay, um, okay, one question, though, do we who should have the ability to manually edit tax rates? I'm going to jump in with this question because it's relevant now. It's what we're talking relevant now. It's what we're talking about. There's a possibility of tax rate, if you put in tax rate of eight here, your sales tax liability and your like things are going to get thrown sideways, because your your breakdown doesn't add up to eight. And realistically, do you really want most people to be able to edit?

Unknown Speaker  42:03
No,

Speaker 2  42:07
anybody be able to edit it or what? What is? What's a use case where anybody would ever edit, like, if we have the ping button, and

Matthias Miller  42:16
I can't think of anything. So are you fine if we I think we lock it down so you can't edit it in the screen, the detailed screen. If Duane really does, really has an itch to edit it, you can go build an editable report and figure out how to change it there.

Unknown Speaker  42:30
What are you proposing not to edit

Matthias Miller  42:33
the tax rate and the jurisdiction and sub rates?

Speaker 4  42:39
I mean, there are a number of times where tax jar has got it wrong for whatever reason. I would hate to see it like I don't care if you restrict it to Administrator level, but okay. I mean, in particular, tax jar gets very confused about whenever you get into some cross district stuff, and it's just there are edge cases where we have to go and make changes to it.

Matthias Miller  43:10
So editable stuff, editable by admins or not. In detail screen and a warning on save if tax rate does not equal the sum of the components

Speaker 1  43:26
and the minimum of a 200 word memo and a link to where you found the tax rate is supposed to be.

Matthias Miller  43:38
I'll let you work that out with with Dwayne. I'm staying out of that. So Matthias,

Speaker 4  43:41
back, back to the variance between, I didn't quite understand your statement about the variance between sales tax and components. What explain?

Matthias Miller  43:52
Set click the little star button, if you don't mind, there's nothing. Okay. So you see here one, two and four. So cities, 1% counties, two, state is four. So that adds up to 7% so if, if somebody gets real snarky and changes the tax rate on the main screen to six, but doesn't change these breakdowns in here, then we're going to end up in with an accounting discrepancy of our sales tax liability being off, and I don't want to feel like thinking through all the implications, but we're going to pay the state seven, or we're going to file for file and pay seven, but we're only going to think we should have paid six, and so I

Speaker 4  44:33
don't, let's drive the tax rate on the detail screen based off of this, like make it uneditable.

Matthias Miller  44:42
That needs to be run past Josh and there's some old sales orders. We need to handle old sales orders.

Speaker 4  44:50
Where Gotcha? I'm assuming I see 124, I'm assuming you're handling two decimal points, at least two decimal points,

Unknown Speaker  44:56
three, three decimals,

Speaker 1  44:57
yeah, up to five. 505. Well, you could if, if the main one gets adjusted, it's probably a local tax that needs adjusted, you know, like, if it's off, it's probably not that it has the wrong state jurisdiction in mind, and therefore is off. It's probably more a local jurisdiction that it has incorrect.

Speaker 4  45:28
I mean, I'm, I'm a huge fan of making the the one on the detail screen uneditable, and driving it from from here.

Matthias Miller  45:37
Okay, so, so we could add, well, I don't know. I feel like we're delving into Josh territory here. Part of me is like, why don't we just, oh, only admin should ever be changing this. So let's just add a warning if it's out of sync and admins and it'll just tell admins, you got to make sure they match. Easier than connecting some of the stuff with Josh and TaxJar Seth, the only thing of the validation error is that if none of the other percentages are filled in, then we shouldn't warn because it's an old sales order.

Speaker 3  46:18
What if we check the sales order creation date, or one of the dates based off the new system switch that.

Matthias Miller  46:27
Yeah, the creation date, past that, past the effective date could work. Yeah,

Speaker 3  46:35
that'd be fine. That feels otherwise someone could go in and just nuke all the maybe dumb, but you could go in and call the fields and leave the main tax rate, and we wouldn't complain.

Unknown Speaker  46:49
Bad idea.

Matthias Miller  46:52
Government and software have a principal role, which is generally protecting people from their own exactly themselves. Generally, generally,

Unknown Speaker  47:03
we should decide which one does a better job

Speaker 1  47:09
for that one, exactly, we will end up in conspiracy land real fast.

Matthias Miller  47:18
All right. Good.

Speaker 3  47:19
You got all that Seth, thanks. No. It was make these fields these and the tax rate at will by admins or not, in detail screen, and then a warning on save if they're different, if they're different, past,

Matthias Miller  47:33
the past,

Speaker 4  47:36
because, in theory, if, if someone that's below an administrator level needs to update the tax rate for some reason, hit the ping button, and it'll do what it's

Matthias Miller  47:44
supposed to do, good doubly. The worst case is a dealer is trying. Somebody's trying to close the deal, and the sales tax is wrong, and customers in an argument, in which case they should ping dealer support and

Speaker 4  47:56
get one last thing that I feel like is probably going to end up being fairly important, and that is, we need reporting on if you hit the ping button or if your reporting hits is we're trying to reping sales orders and something's wrong with the address that tax jar does not give us back and act like doesn't know what to do with the address. We need to know what in the world's wrong. It's really difficult. If all you get is an internal server error or something like

Matthias Miller  48:24
that, can we add a okay mark or Dwayne, whoever maintains this agenda, have a conversation with Josh. See if there's a way you can have an error field or a text or status or something like that, where when it fails, that it stomps the error message onto that screen, and you guys can figure out what went wrong. Like to Josh mark,

Speaker 4  48:48
you want to put that on your agenda? Yeah? Making, yeah, because I promise you it's going to happen that, you know, something happens with the ship to address, you know, something's going to go sideways somewhere, and we're going to get errors, and it's going to be fun. Okay? I mean this, it happens often enough in the configurator already that, yeah, let's make sure we handle it.

Unknown Speaker  49:17
Okay, I'm trying to think what? Okay, so let me start closing some of these down. I have too much stuff open.

Speaker 3  49:30
So these are both what you would run end of period. This is, if you want to just this is the report that drives the import. I don't think I have any data that would actually show up in here right now because I ran this several times. Yeah, no, but this is what, basically, this is just showing what's going to be filled into the RG. So you could run this, if you want to look over the data before you import, you could. To run the preview and just see if it looks reasonable.

Speaker 3  50:10
And then we have the logic to create transactions, and again, have it split into the preview and calculate, which you don't have to run preview before you run calculate, but it's just, again, if you want to get a preview of it, okay, I do have, actually have data here. So this would be to create a transaction where ABC as of well, for this vendor as of for the period for October, which normally this wouldn't be an option yet, but I had, I Created data before we had filtered stuff down completely. So what it does is it's grabbing all the rows with a vendor getting the this is a sales tax liability account, right? Yes. And then this one doesn't have the other account configured, which is pop

Matthias Miller  51:22
it open fairly quickly,

Speaker 3  51:26
trying to remember this, it's on the accounting company. It's on the vendor. It's on the vendor,

Matthias Miller  51:41
the change it from cash to primary child. Oh, that's why for you payment, because

Unknown Speaker  51:49
my and

Speaker 3  52:01
then it should There we go. So it gets all the sales tax amounts, and then has the sum which is every bad debt in here We which have a few credit rows mixed in. But it's fairly straightforward. I think I don't know, in basic so,

Speaker 1  52:25
so that's the transaction. Then, yes, so do you do anything to actually post that transaction? Um, or after you've calculated, like, when does it, how does it get a data fixed? When this transaction is?

Speaker 3  52:46
If you okay, if you run calculate sales tax payment and actually run this, it'll, it'll actually create the transaction, and there's, it'll fill in the transaction date with this ask prompt. It defaults to today. But is there anything else?

Unknown Speaker  53:05
Okay, very good. How do I edit that transaction? If needed?

Matthias Miller  53:16
Why would you need to edit it just as a segment? Well, pull it up so

Speaker 1  53:22
they give discounts, but like there's there's discounts or additions based on whether you're early or late, for a lot of states.

Unknown Speaker  53:36
Do we have a contacts,

Matthias Miller  53:39
by the way? Seth, let's talk about a sales tax payments report that would be you wouldn't need it, but we could fairly easily create a report that just shows,

Matthias Miller  53:58
maybe it's not necessary.

Speaker 3  53:59
The ABC, oh, you're this is a different one that I actually created. Okay, ignore all the weird data. But so this would be so you could filter by contact, which would be the sales tax vendor and the company, and then it would show you the then I would show you the transactions. But we could, like Matthias was saying, we could create a sales tax payments report, we do link to the sales order from the transaction, and vice versa, from the trans from the sales or sorry, from the transaction to the sales order, then from the sales order to the transaction. So there's linking across there.

Speaker 1  54:54
So could we on that? If you go back to that, create the payment? Yes. Could it just be that you can open this up and then add another row or something and then hit a, you know, post button, or I don't know, like and then actually post it later.

Matthias Miller  55:19
We could give you an option to select a an account with a debit or credit amount. That would just be one more, one more item,

Unknown Speaker  55:40
right here,

Matthias Miller  55:41
right here?

Unknown Speaker  55:42
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  55:49
that would probably work.

Speaker 2  55:54
So when you're calculating the sales tax payment, you're you're calculating the transaction, but then to actually go and pay it. It's that, is that a manual step then that you take this transaction.

Speaker 1  56:07
I mean, it's you're actually paying it elsewhere. This is just recording that you have paid it. Yeah.

Speaker 2  56:18
So does this? Does the the payment. Then also go back to the sales order. Like on an individual sales order, can you see both the liability and the payment?

Unknown Speaker  56:32
Here's a link to the transaction.

Speaker 2  56:36
And you're showing, so you're showing so the 1049 there is one

Speaker 3  56:43
I we could show the tax amount too. We've actually, this is the subtotal adjustment.

Unknown Speaker  56:53
Show the actual tax.

Unknown Speaker  56:55
We haven't actually been showing the actual tax here.

Speaker 1  56:59
I mean, it was. It would probably be good so you can see which line on the transaction is, though. I mean, I guess it would be other ways too.

Speaker 3  57:09
I mean, yeah, you can, it's linked across by there's a unique row ID here. I don't, I mean, I don't mind adding the tax amount. It'll, it'll potentially be, just be a straight negative reversal of a prior row if jurisdiction changes or something.

Matthias Miller  57:35
But, I mean, it's, it's five minutes to add it I see, and

Unknown Speaker  57:40
it makes sense to have it on, yeah,

Speaker 2  57:42
adding the the liability. But then could we also add the payment? Or, do I misunderstand was, were you saying you're adding the payment amount or the i

Matthias Miller  58:04
We're assuming that you pay the liability amount.

Speaker 1  58:13
So this row here shows tax jars, paying that transaction, giving us this tax liability, and then you'd have to go to the link, and you would see, okay, here is where this row was paid instead of and then you'd not be recording it as a list item here.

Speaker 2  58:39
So, but what happens if, let's say, so we make this payment, it all zeros out, but then the customer has short paid us 500 and so three months later, when we go to three months later, we say, well, we're never going to collect on that.

Speaker 2  59:01
Like, how does that show up in the in here? Because I know that that's a question that's going to come up. Like, okay, how much sales tax hit or have we paid sales tax beyond what we should have? I

Speaker 3  59:24
I can't this. The date on this thing is too old. I mean, do

Matthias Miller  59:31
you have one where we have bad debt? Could you just pull up that sales order? And so here's a

Speaker 3  59:41
case. Just walk through the story which this one I was doing all sorts of stuff with So, but essentially check period end date. So this was the initial one it was at at this location. Just. $205 subtotal adjustment. And then this all happened the next one. So this row here is a reversal, because jurisdiction changed. And then this row was for the sales, 20504, adjustment. And then we said, oh, wait, we have bad debt. So there's a 1939 bad debt adjustment, which, if we show the tax amount, then that's be a credit of 141 I think is the and then do you

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
want to pull up the sales tax report for this, for the 1031, period for 10? And, yeah, I

Matthias Miller  1:00:52
and then here we see the 205 of work reversal for noble, we see the 20504, sale for tempestuosity, and then the the negative bad debt, credit or domesticity.

Speaker 2  1:01:19
This is then the reporting that he used to file, and this, this, this report is driven by the sales tax contact type.

Speaker 3  1:01:37
So you're saying whether we report this like bad debt and current sales separately. Yeah, right, yeah. So if we would go to the sales tax vendor,

Speaker 3  1:01:57
and if we would uncheck this, then that would be lumped in now. So now it's right here

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
is that, does that make your job a lot easier?

Speaker 1  1:02:14
Yeah, that should work, great. So the just looking at this report, also the breakdown on the right is that, is that for the whole page, or what the whole thing?

Speaker 3  1:02:30
So it's, it's for the vendor and period,

Speaker 1  1:02:37
okay, um, what I need to be able to get it for a county, okay, as well. So I need that, but I also need a county like, you know. So we take just Noble County. How would that break out?

Speaker 3  1:03:01
So essentially it would be exactly like this, except filter to just this counties. Okay, okay, so I can, I could just add another sub pain and label which one they are. But because I think I could bait, I could use the same report, I just need to add a prompt, and depending on the prompt, I'll label it differently so you know which is which. But it should be pretty simple,

Matthias Miller  1:03:28
so Drew is it fine? Then for you just to be able to click on a county row and have a pane pop up with those counties totals,

Speaker 1  1:03:35
that would be that would be great, rather than needing to go back change the prompt. Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:03:45
yeah. So this one, this pane, would just stay the same no matter where you click, but then the one down here would change depending on which county.

Speaker 1  1:03:53
Yeah, sounds great.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57
That should be pretty actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:58
you should maybe.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
Can you okay? I'm not sure, like if we have counties left listed with different rates.

Speaker 1  1:04:23
Um, so let's say, let's so say, because of a local jurisdiction, there's a Noble County, there's a there's a city in Noble County that charges 6.6 and a half. So that's going to separate those out into two separate groups. Like there's going to be the 6.275 group and the six and a half group, but the county rate is actually the same all the way across those two groups. So I need the total of that county. I. And then I need just the extra for that city, you know, so what if it would go by, like, what's highlighted, or something like that, so that you could just highlight one group if you want, highlight two groups to figure them together, if you want, or maybe there's a better solution for that.

Matthias Miller  1:05:30
Do you? Do you sometimes need to have totals for the 6% tax rate versus the 7% tax rate within the county,

Speaker 1  1:05:39
right? I need to have so like, I'll need the county total.

Speaker 1  1:05:49
I wonder if many counties are there. That way, there's not many. It. It might be a thing to where, if there is that case, you just find out what the one groupings total is.

Speaker 3  1:06:12
I mean, we group here by the total tax rate, which is grouped under County. So you could see the totals here.

Matthias Miller  1:06:22
So we could also have three panes. This might be overkill, but we can have all counties and this county all rates, and this county selected rate. Would that be the trick?

Speaker 1  1:06:36
I mean, if that's easy, it would be the trick. Yeah, it's for the few counties that it is adding together. You know, something out of the groups isn't going to be too hard either, but

Matthias Miller  1:06:51
Seth would, what do you think of that

Speaker 3  1:06:54
that should be pretty doable, basically. So all counties, then this county would just be everything in this grouping, whether they have the same tax rate or not, and then the last one would only be ones with this exact tax rate right, which they could theoretically be in different cities if the city has the exact same tax rate or not.

Speaker 1  1:07:21
Yeah, I mean within the same county, I don't think it's gonna matter, okay, because the county is a greater grouping anyway. So I

Speaker 3  1:07:46
Okay, and what date were you want to hear? I think I put the invoice date, but I hadn't been quite sure from the Yeah, that's what I put. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:57
Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:08:03
Can we call it invoice date? Because it

Unknown Speaker  1:08:06
just doesn't yeah, there's

Matthias Miller  1:08:10
not a lot of dates that really make sense with these liabilities, besides Yeah, I guess we could do invoice or cancelation date, where there's a cancelation date, we show the cancelation date, and if it's invoice, we show the invoice. I don't know. I don't care. I don't know if you guys need to see that or not.

Speaker 1  1:08:35
Yeah, that actually would be good. I mean, if, if it's a cancelation date, we need to drive off of that cancelation date

Matthias Miller  1:08:46
two columns, actually, because you can have something invoiced and canceled and well, then it would show up at the same period. No, but you still want to know. You

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
probably want to know. You probably want to

Speaker 1  1:08:59
know if it's Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:09:03
yeah, I vote separate column, but I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:20
this is starting to give you a Pretty big report.

Speaker 1  1:09:32
Squeeze down the dealer. Oh, sure. I

Matthias Miller  1:09:42
how far you

Speaker 1  1:09:45
can go, more than that, if you want, but might make it harder to look at. Maybe he needs something in there. In fact, the name I don't much care about either, the billing name could be squeezed down as well. I. Should work.

Speaker 3  1:10:15
Okay, well, are there more questions, or is there anything else?

Matthias Miller  1:10:23
One other question, when, if you have a sales order with raw materials cost, anybody is allowed to attach a stin, which means that the raw material cost would get blanked out. Is that fine if we just quietly blink out the raw materials cost, if somebody attaches a stint, or do you want to give an error? Say, you you can't do this,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
or you had suggested a warning, maybe on, say, for

Matthias Miller  1:10:55
a warning, what? What's,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
what's the scenario? Somebody, for some

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
reason, writes up a sales order with a raw material. Cost. So I don't know why they would do it like this. So

Speaker 1  1:11:10
yeah, I do you'd write up a sales order for something, a use case, situate a use tax situation. So you're going to be nice to your neighbor, and you're going to go build him the deck, you know, because you're slow or something. And you then write him up an invoice for $5,000 worth of materials and $2,000 worth labor or whatever. And then you put your raw materials cost in and then he says, Oh, and by the way, I want you know that barn you have sitting on the lot. And so somebody goes and attaches a stand to it as well. Might be a ridiculous thing to do, but, but that's why you would have an invoice with a with a raw materials cost,

Matthias Miller  1:12:02
well more even it feels really

Speaker 4  1:12:04
edge case to me, because if you just go attach a stand, there's so much other stuff that does not happen. I'm like, there's, there is a whole like, there's no automation that happens, doing it that way for like, scheduling to haul it, or anything like that. So it if somebody, if somebody did that, they need to be knocked on the head. Okay? So

Matthias Miller  1:12:28
we can just give an error if you try to attach a standing with the raw material cost, and they need to go find one. You need to go blank it out. If that's really what should happen.

Speaker 4  1:12:35
I'm not saying it would never happen. It's just there's, there's a lot of stuff that would go wrong, if, if I try to do that, there

Speaker 1  1:12:43
would be plenty of reason to just write a new sales order for that stem. Yeah, is what you're saying you should do.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:50
Yeah, absolutely.

Matthias Miller  1:12:52
So let's make it an error. Okay, that takes care of I don't think there's anything else. How important is it to you? Drew, did we come up with a good solution? As far as the do you want to prompt for the additional line items, discounts, fees, whatever on the sales order, payment prompt?

Speaker 1  1:13:21
Oh, you're saying, if tax changed,

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
no, I'm sorry. When you're making a sales tax payment, you're paying, oh, yeah, should shed times in September or October taxes, and you get a 1% cash back because you're fast, because, because of us, obviously. And do you do you want? Are you looking for a way to add that in when you make the payment? Are you wanting to go back in, just into the transaction, and add it in?

Speaker 1  1:13:54
I don't know. I mean, it's going to happen just about every time. Well. I mean, the states that it does that, does it, it's going to happen every time, because most those you either have a discount or a extra penalty. I don't know why they don't have time in between those two, but anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:16
so to pay sales tax, now you're going to do the the preview.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
Like, I need to file online based on this, and then I need to go out to that other thing and create

Speaker 2  1:14:30
the transaction. Yeah, so you're going to file on this, and then you're going to know what your discount or your penalty is. And then so so you take care of all that, make your payment, and then you come back in and create right after that, you create your transaction, yeah, oh, and so if you could do it right in that, that window, you otherwise, you'd have to create your transaction, open up the transaction at the end, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:54
right.

Speaker 1  1:14:56
So going into the create sales tax payment, if it could be put in. They're in those prompts that would work really nicely.

Speaker 3  1:15:04
Do we want this menu item or not? Sorry, do we even want the preview menu item here or not?

Speaker 1  1:15:15
Preview sales tax? Oh, okay, do that one again. Let me see what that is. It's

Speaker 3  1:15:21
just showing the data that it'll put on the transaction. Oh, do you want to be able to see that easily or not? I mean, if we add it to the other one, we'll add it here too, because these are very linked. I mean, this is what drives, this is where the data comes for the import. So one gets the prompt, the other does too.

Speaker 1  1:15:49
Okay. Well, I guess this is probably a dumb question, but is there any way that that the payment that posts is different from what that reporting, that last reporting page would say

Speaker 3  1:16:01
only if you did the reporting and then you went and made some changes and then calculated sales tax liabilities, and then went to create a sales tax payment. Otherwise it should be the same.

Speaker 1  1:16:18
Okay, okay, um, I mean, I don't know. I would say, if you have it there for now, leave it there. Sure, just, I don't know. It's a little bit scary hitting a create this transaction without ever being able to see what the transaction is. You know, generally you create and then you hit save, but this is hitting Save and then, okay, now this is what I saved. Yeah. So the preview is kind of nice, sure, after I see it 100 times or less than that, and it's never wrong, I'll probably say, just get right up, right?

Matthias Miller  1:17:04
So, so, so I would, I would add a an account and debit, additional line item, account, debit, amount, credit, amount, to the detail screen. And we might even want it to the previous well, to both, I'm sorry that right are reported and import, wow. It might even be nice on the on both previews to add a add a Calculate button, either calculate or create payment button that passes the reports as prompts into the X 30 and just runs it Sure,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:48
yeah, I guess it'll let it run something that calls itself,

Matthias Miller  1:17:52
yeah, okay, yep, this is yeah, because it's not interactive. I mean, it's not running it interactively. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:18:18
Okay, so, good. Anything else for this? I mean, I think we've gone over what we need. Oh, I was wondering what permission should control menu items and, well, yeah, like, who should be able to run these? You probably don't want just anyone.

Speaker 2  1:18:45
And is there nobody other than an admin should be in the sales should be in sales tax, I would think. But I mean, is there? Is there a reason why? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:53
I'm questioning why

Speaker 4  1:18:56
it's under sales. Should it not be, not out in accounting now?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:02
Yeah, what was that

Speaker 4  1:19:05
I said? I'm questioning why it's under the sales tab. Now, I think it should go out in accounting, and I think it should carry the accounting privileges.

Speaker 1  1:19:11
Yeah, that would be about, right? I mean, you can do the preview sales tax liabilities. I don't. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:19:19
like having them together,

Speaker 4  1:19:22
like all of the cat tax, sales tax, all of that stuff. There's no reason for it to be under sales anymore. I think it

Unknown Speaker  1:19:30
should all go

Speaker 1  1:19:33
out to accounting. Now here's just another thought, instead of having the create sales tax payment, and basically that's a Active button there. Could that button be on the now, which report is this previous sale tax liability? Did that one. For

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
which Which one were you saying?

Speaker 2  1:20:02
I think that's suggesting here, yeah, is have it on the previous sales tax payment like you preview it. Everything looks good. Then you have a button. You just Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:13
right, instead of a main menu button,

Speaker 3  1:20:16
yeah, yeah. Do you want to take both of these off? Both the calculate and the Create, and then you would just run this, and then there's a button inside run this. There's a button inside

Unknown Speaker  1:20:29
that would work. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:20:32
Then what do you want the menu items labeled? Do you want it to still say preview or just say sales tax liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
That would probably find industrial tax liability. Yeah, sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
Okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:45
Um, sales tax button a bread above that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
this, that's the new report. It's like for all the,

Speaker 1  1:20:58
oh, that's what we had to okay, I thought, nevermind. Um, in that case, you might want to leave the preview name on the other one,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
sure, right? I mean,

Speaker 1  1:21:17
preview shows before you run the calculate or not,

Speaker 3  1:21:23
I'm getting you mixed up. Yes, well, there's two different previews, because there's a preview sales tax liabilities. That's before we add anything to the RG, okay, that's what will be added to and then the sales, we could call this preview sales tax payment transaction. Then you know, that's to create an accounting transaction. Does that help?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:48
Yeah, that would work. And

Matthias Miller  1:21:50
then also the sales tax report itself. I mean, this is it's really the sales tax Filing report, sure? How does that sound? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:22:13
I Okay, well, I think I have a few things to work on. Then I can update the test system then, but if you all want to be using working on the test system in the next few days before this gets live. That would probably wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  1:22:51
hurt. I don't know if

Speaker 3  1:22:53
you want to just start trying to do sales tax in the live system right away, or if you want to mess around with it in here first. I mean, we could, I don't know, Matthias,

Speaker 1  1:23:06
when is it? When are you pushing it live?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:10
I mean, at this point it would come through with the next update.

Matthias Miller  1:23:14
Oh, okay, so Josh does an update on Saturday, it would be live Monday morning through.

Speaker 1  1:23:22
Well, thing is, is I really don't have much time to punch around until then.

Speaker 3  1:23:29
And even then, you could do it in the test system first, if you wanted to.

Matthias Miller  1:23:35
So I don't, yeah, let's if Drew doesn't have time, that answers the question. So nothing more needed there. The the one thing we have not talked about, which is the Go Live process. Because we can say, Do you want to track historical payments? We can just say, as of October 1, we're going to look at all new cancelations and new sales beyond that point, and you drew, get tasked with the responsibility of finagling any kind of weird, I don't know, fall out. If there is anything, are we good with that?

Speaker 1  1:24:18
Can we have a place to put a date in, because we are going to want to eventually include the year to pick up all those canceled sales that we have not picked up yet.

Matthias Miller  1:24:33
So you have a bunch of canceled sales that you haven't reported through the beginning of the year, right? Oh, well, that's fun.

Speaker 1  1:24:41
So I'd like to be able to look at just this month and say, Okay, is it working correctly with this month? And then once we've determined that everything is functioning correctly, we could say, Okay, now let's pull in the past. Cancel. Goodness. I. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:25:02
could we do this? Do we have any historical reports that we could run where we could say, go calculate sales tax for January, and we could manually delete sales tax history rows that we didn't pay? And then I Oh, I don't even know what happens if

Speaker 4  1:25:25
there's the larger question is, how do you know you didn't pay them?

Speaker 1  1:25:29
Well, I have, I have reports from assist on everything that. So like when I went to pay sales tax, I exported it and saved it. So it could be a matter of, we just pull a year to date report and I subtract all the values that I've already paid and say, Okay, it says we're, we're, we're due or overdue, or, you know, we're liable for another $200 or we get $5,000 back, or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
I know the pain of that one. I've done that, and it's painful. I mean,

Speaker 2  1:26:09
that's likely what you're going to have is we're due money back. Yeah, so how do you then include, include that,

Speaker 1  1:26:20
oh, it just changes our gross sales, or retail sales. Like all I need to put in there is the top big line number, as far as the stuff per the counties and all of that. I mean, if I could pull a report on the cancel sales, and I could say, Okay, well, I'm just going to adjust this county by this much because we had these sales and call it as good as possible. I don't know. You

Speaker 2  1:26:49
don't have to break it down and provide a lot of you can basically. I think what you're going to end up with is, is I paid 200,000 year to date, and now looking back, I only should have paid 180,000 like that negative 20,000 Right, right. You can just show that as a single line item when you go to file in November. Well,

Speaker 1  1:27:17
what I would do is it would be short paid. So we've short paid prior in the year. So far, we've overpaid $2,000 this month. Liabilities, first is $10,000 and so I, I, I take

Unknown Speaker  1:27:35
$8 yeah,

Speaker 1  1:27:37
but now on the on the states that require county lying lining out each county, I have to look at, okay, here's Council sales in this county, and adjust that counties, amount, amount like that becomes a lot more difficult. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
I have a proposal. I don't know this would work or not, but I have a proposal for the first time, using a new system. We tell the new system, we're paying tax from January through end of October, and it generates a massive report, and it's massively complicated to work through, and confusing and all that. And you do some work to get the reports right and get everything squared away. You file for October now, theoretically come November, we should have everything should be in sync. And

Speaker 2  1:28:37
so how it is okay? We're obviously just in the test system now, but, but you would go to the sales tax report and just run it as a one, one to 1030 or 1031 or whatever. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
we'll have a system switch that says, when we start the new tax system. Actually, we can't go back all that that far because, I mean, well, we'll have to repaint tax jar for all of those folks. Oh, you're

Speaker 2  1:29:06
saying you're going to have to repaint tax jar for everything, every sale that was invoice year to date, yeah.

Speaker 4  1:29:13
Well, then you're definitely going to have to have the as update as part of the

Matthias Miller  1:29:19
pings. So that means we can't do that.

Speaker 2  1:29:24
Well, I Why don't you just ping? Why don't you just recalculate, basically, self total times the store, tax, jar, tax, rate value?

Matthias Miller  1:29:36
Well, we don't have jurisdiction and and we don't have jurisdiction information year to date. We've only had that

Speaker 2  1:29:47
for a little bit. So do we need to go back to Josh and see Kenny do that as of a specific date? I mean, if he can, then that would solve everything, right? But. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:30:01
it would we can recalculate everything historically. Alternatively, it would mean that we give drew reported cancelations from January through September, and the new system kicks in October 1, and we just calculate everything from October 1 going forward.

Speaker 1  1:30:19
That's kind of what I was thinking of going to is just, can we just get a report that shows, you know, all bad debts, all cancelations, and then call it good? I don't know. Here's,

Matthias Miller  1:30:38
here's another thing we could do. No, you can't, but you're going to need to know what

Matthias Miller  1:31:01
one 930, hang on, maybe I'm lying. I am lying. We do have jurisdiction information. Why was I thinking we don't?

Speaker 2  1:31:16
Well, it was, but it just wasn't broken down. It wasn't broken it's

Matthias Miller  1:31:19
not we don't have the rates. That's what it is. Couldn't

Speaker 2  1:31:23
we just use Couldn't we just use the we just have the total or the aggregate rate is we only have one rate right for historical like a 7% so Couldn't we just go through again and just use whatever that 7% times whatever the current subtotal is that that would give us. Here's what we should have paid. If we already know what we what we did pay, like that. That's from a very high level. That's what you need is, is we know what we paid. We're just saying, what should we have paid? But then to document that difference, or to like, you need to break down that difference. You're saying you're just going to take your best shot and break it down, though,

Speaker 1  1:32:19
per county or per like, you know. So if I take the old report, if the old report would bring in all canceled sales and bad debts, I'd be able to figure out pretty quickly where my difference is. Oh, well, if

Speaker 2  1:32:39
you have that old report, you can just, couldn't we just take the old report and add several columns to that and bring in the new current information, like it looks at sales order, 123, from the old report and says, Oh, but this one has now changed X amount.

Matthias Miller  1:33:01
Oops. Something like that, my word,

Speaker 1  1:33:05
as long as it's not repping texture as of a current date, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:09
But how would you, how would you bring in the old report?

Speaker 2  1:33:13
Well, I mean, is it simply a an Excel thing that that should be done, where we create? Yeah, maybe this is too simplistic, but I'm thinking we could take Drew's reports that he saved from what he filed on, and now run a new sales tax report for that same time period and just, yeah.

Speaker 4  1:33:34
I mean, that's, that's what I've done in times past, is I just, that's exactly what I did.

Matthias Miller  1:33:41
Used to be lookups, or however you want to do it, or just comparisons, or pace side by side, or whatever.

Speaker 2  1:33:49
I mean, it seems like that might be the best. Sounds like a duct tape option, but might be the best for, yeah, for getting this.

Speaker 3  1:34:00
I mean, it is a one time thing, so, yeah, it feels like it'd be expensive to try to code support for it, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:34:09
but thinking about going forward, if, if a period was filed and you went through this process and it was done incorrectly. Let's say you didn't calculate enough. You didn't pay enough for whatever reason. Will when you go to File again the next month, say there were changes on invoicing, or new invoices were backdated into the previous period, or whatever. Will those all be picked up in the in the current period? Then

Unknown Speaker  1:34:45
I think so, everything

Matthias Miller  1:34:47
that should all be part of that. Everything. So every period calculation, we go from October 1, which is going to be our go live date, we're going to look at all sales orders from october 1 through the period end date. Anything that was invoiced or canceled within that entire time period, and we're going to look at it, we're going to calculate current liabilities, calculate deltas, and get reconciled. So we'll keep fixing it up, yeah, as long as we need to.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:14
So that would truly be a one time situation.

Matthias Miller  1:35:18
The only weird thing is that we might run into issues. Is if somebody cancels a sales order, a really old sales order, we won't have the breakdown of rates. And so we might have to, I don't know, probably the best thing is calling Special Forces and have them clean it up. I don't know. I don't expect much of anything to happen? But,

Speaker 1  1:35:42
well, if the breakdown is editable, you know, if we have this breakdown thing, we can go in and put in what the breakdown should be

Matthias Miller  1:35:50
exactly, and you and you'll Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2  1:35:56
So what happens? So a few things that I guess we're after 11. Here are we good to continue for another 510, minutes? So the go live date? Are we? Is that a given, that as of October 1, is Josh was pinging tax jar or like, do we know for sure what our go live date is like, where we have broken down by jurisdictions?

Matthias Miller  1:36:30
We could check activity history on Seth, you could do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:36
I'm looking

Matthias Miller  1:36:40
where he's also got his, he also pinged me when he sent the it was confusing. I've got two Josh's in signal,

Speaker 3  1:36:49
except she doesn't. There's only one sales order that has a jurisdiction on it, and I think he was testing or something. Oh, do we not actually have I don't think he's been bringing it in. I don't know why, but

Matthias Miller  1:37:06
are you guys and the ping is but the ping is working in the live system,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:13
no, oh,

Matthias Miller  1:37:19
are you okay if we use end of October dates for any sales in October or end of October rates for any sales in October,

Speaker 1  1:37:28
yeah, it's very rare that it changes within a month.

Matthias Miller  1:37:32
Okay, um, so, so we need the pinging working before the end of month, and then anything, anything that was invoiced from October 1 on, okay, so I think to make a change so that we auto ping on invoicing and then Monday morning, we need to set the system switch to go live system switch. And if Josh is pinging working, then we need to go ping all October sales orders, anything invoiced after on or after October

Unknown Speaker  1:38:21
1. Don't

Unknown Speaker  1:38:23
leave ping behind.

Speaker 2  1:38:29
So so we should, so drew should plan to up to september 30. Plan to do the the Excel like version, and then after from 10 one on, use the new version. So, so when you go to file for when you go to File, first part of November, for October, you're going to need to combine both of those, right? You'll get the new slick report and add all the old reaches that we we think we ate,

Speaker 1  1:39:05
and that then brings in on that adjustment, to put that, that adjustment line item in, to adjust the amount of the payment, maybe should make space for, like, More than just one, you know, because I want to hit accrued sales tax liability with our big, huge adjustment for the early part of the year. Plus, I might want to hit, you know, a vendor discount type of thing or whatever, for that, for that discount that we receive.

Matthias Miller  1:39:41
Because

Speaker 2  1:39:43
wouldn't you just because it's a one time thing, wouldn't you just go edit the transaction? Oh,

Speaker 1  1:39:47
yeah, that's right. Or just edit the transaction, yeah, or just write totally a separate transaction. Know that they reconcile out and the checking statement. Two, or put together in one,

Speaker 2  1:40:03
it'll work like, the part that makes me a little bit nervous about this is, like, from an audit standpoint, it could look really like we would make an audit across, I mean, is it what? How would we explain

Speaker 1  1:40:16
this? I mean, or is it if we have, if we have, like, so we'll have a report then saying, here are all your canceled sales that you didn't figure in yet, and we'll save that. I mean, if the part that I'm a little bit concerned about would be, you know, all month long, we've been saying, here's our sales, here's our sales, here's our sales. So it kind of follows pattern. Well, all of a sudden, if our sales is now 25% of what it has been, that just looks a little fun, you know? And then the next month, it goes right back. I was like, wow, that was a bad month. Well, I mean, we don't know. But again,

Speaker 2  1:41:01
enough, we could spread it over two months. We could, we could. Not ideal, but so

Speaker 1  1:41:09
the 100% proper way to do it would be to go File amendments for each month, which I don't know. I mean, maybe it would be worth it, but it is a royal pain. Filing amendments in some states. Some states, there's nothing to it. It's very simple. But others is, is just, it's a pill. And so you just, you just roll all your amendments into the current month, and the way you go,

Speaker 2  1:41:40
Well, why don't we just document it? Well, I'm just throw that up. So, Matthias, you. So any cancelations or invoicing done after 10 one, understand that what happens on a sales order that was invoice 915, and I don't know it's, it's short paid, or we the subtotal changes after the fact, that wouldn't be picked up in the new reporting. Would it like or that wouldn't be picked up after 10 one, because we're not changing the invoice date. So, so the what you're doing Drew, would have to pick that up and in it to it, the chances that, well, okay, the the real thing that is going to happen is, when we have, if we have short payments, we're short paid something that was invoice in September, we Don't actually acknowledge it until October or November. Mm, hmm. Okay? Or will this? Will this reporting the bad debt with this new write out functionality, will that? So let's say we have something invoiced in September 15 and then November 15. We say, Okay, let's write off this 500 we can collect the bad debt. Will it recognize the write off date as of 1115 and throw that into this report, into the November report, or not, as as bad debt?

Matthias Miller  1:43:19
This is for one invoiced, win, 915, no because, like this system can't do that because we don't know it's all based on what was filed previously, and we have no record of any historical filing. So if you really want to do this right, we should have come December something, run a report on all bad debt from for things historically, invoice, you know, January through September, and make adjustments for that. But realistically, well, I mean, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:04
probably not worth the hassle to run after. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:44:08
probably cheaper paying the state whatever bad debt you collected on sales tax and bad debt during that period than it is to fix it. But that's your call.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:19
Good. Well,

Speaker 2  1:44:20
was that give us what we need? You'd want it well, we're out of time. So yeah, that's fine. So

Speaker 4  1:44:30
I have, I have one quick question before, before we all jump off here,

Matthias Miller  1:44:37
if we have time. I got a quick answer, no, go ahead.

Speaker 4  1:44:42
So right now there is an error if you, if you create a sales order and you did not fill in any tax information, I think it errors based on the sales tax rate on the detail screen. Are we going to maintain that if or are we going to go to the. The to the actual itemization, or the whatever you called it, are we going to trigger off somewhere if we're going to make the sales tax rate uneditable, like if you're if you can't edit the sales tax rate anymore on the details screen, we're going to have to change that error to make sure that we always catch if there's no sales tax information. Can

Matthias Miller  1:45:20
we disable that error if you click ping? Well, I mean,

Speaker 4  1:45:25
if you, if you click ping and it fills in the information, obviously we're not going to get an error. Well,

Speaker 3  1:45:29
it doesn't ping until save, I think I assume it, yeah, save the record, and then it pings. So that's what Matthias, Oh, gotcha. So Seth, I think we

Matthias Miller  1:45:37
should loosen the validation and if somebody clicked the ping box, we don't give an error, so you'll still save should

Speaker 3  1:45:44
I did it or do I let Josh deal with it because it's sort of related to his stuff or not? Oh, I don't,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:52
I don't know,

Speaker 3  1:45:55
because there's other tax stuff we're needing him to deal with. Let

Speaker 4  1:46:01
me further clarify my question. What? What I don't like right now is that the error is based off of the sales tax rate field, and so what that means is, if you just drop it right in there right now, you won't get an error, even though you haven't filled in information, which is, it's it's bad, because we can, then you can end up with a rate, but you have no idea who it's assigned to. So let's, all I'm saying is, let's make sure that we encapsulate, making sure we have information in all of our fields, sales tax fields, in as part of that error process.

Matthias Miller  1:46:35
Got it, got it. Got it, got it. So, so Seth, just on anything on or after. If, if you specify a rate, well, you need to specify a rate. You need to specify, okay, let me speak this back to you coherently. Basically, currently, we're validating that you have a tax rate. And instead, what we're saying is, if you have a non, if you haven't have a non exempt sales order, you need to specify the tax rate, and three jurisdictions and three rates where you can't save, yeah, there's, there's, or you have to ping,

Speaker 4  1:47:16
yeah, there's an additional thing, and this goes to sales tax exemption fields, is that, I think right now, from the configurator side, I think when we do sales tax exemption, I don't know that Josh is actually pinging and giving us back the who, what the I'd have to go double check this. So don't hold me to this. But from the sales tax if you create a sale, a sales order manually, and you do sales tax exempt, we still need to make sure that we paying for the sales tax rates or the sales tax information

Matthias Miller  1:47:47
correct, but we don't have to do that until invoicing on an exempt order fair.

Speaker 4  1:47:51
But then if, if that's the case, then you're going to like, depending on how you do your validation for your error, and you got to make sure you account

Matthias Miller  1:48:03
for that. So we need if it's if it's not exempt, or if it's exempt and invoiced, then then we either need to be pinging or we need to have the combined rate, three jurisdictions and three jurisdiction rates.

Matthias Miller  1:48:36
And the biggest thing, seven, I think it's okay if you do it. The biggest thing that Josh cares about is that you cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot break X 30 sales order creation from the configurator. So it shouldn't get any tighter than what it is, for sure, and I would have some time. If you need to change today, I'd have some time to review it. Okay,

Speaker 4  1:49:07
so the reason I'm asking is because that so there was a number of things every month that I'm doing when, as far as in a data evaluation that goes, and I think we've now covered all the stuff I've hunted for invoicing has covered most of the stuff that we used to have when it comes to like build on site, buildings and some of these types of things. All of that has been cleaned up. A lot of what anymore I was doing is I'm scrolling through all sales orders looking for missing data. And so if, if we actually handle all of the erroring processes correct, we should never come up with missing data, which means that all the stuff I was ever doing for the sales tax side of things is no longer relevant.

Matthias Miller  1:49:54
Okay, good. Exciting times. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:59
nothing more. It's. Adding the sales tax, right?

Matthias Miller  1:50:03
It's nothing, nothing more exciting than making sales tax easier.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:09
That's That's it making it easy. Good,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:13
good Drew. Are there any accountants who like filing sales tax?

Speaker 1  1:50:18
Hopefully only with those who do things that are harder than that.

Matthias Miller  1:50:25
Good answer,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:26
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:30
Good. Thanks guys. Yep,

Matthias Miller  1:50:33
