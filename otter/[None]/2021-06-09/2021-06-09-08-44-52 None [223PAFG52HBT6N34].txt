Alright there's a handful of things. This could be it's possible that it's personal, although I don't know if that's actually the case. It's more, it's possible to their prior situations that are influencing their feedback now that's also possible. I don't understand the connection with the detail importer. I also don't understand. And well there's impossibles possibly she's there one is just one is just potential collisions. One is that with people outside the team involved in that, who might not have background. And so the concern of like taking scarce resources I guess to code review or something I'm not sure what it is. I also don't understand the maintenance burden. Now this might also come down to a philosophical question about do we want to add features to the platform that do not specifically have investor tools benefits. And if that's actually the underlying thing that we need to understand that that's the underlying thing. So then with that is, are there ways that we can determine whether or not this has investor tools benefits, Or is the answer just sort of no we don't make platform changes. And if it's straight up no then there needs to be further conversation around that because philosophically, I'm opposed to that. I don't think it's right. I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's good. This whole idea of let's not ruffle feathers is indicative of an inability to work through issues.
