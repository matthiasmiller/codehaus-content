Unknown Speaker  00:36
Hey, Sir, Hello, okay.

Speaker 1  00:44
Where do you let's see we've got RTO is where we wanting to go today.

Unknown Speaker  00:52
Yeah, I had a good conversation with

Speaker 1  00:57
Dwayne. I think he was pretty surprised that I was asking those questions about the ethics of RTO, but it made a really nice conversation. One thing that was encouraging is, I mean, it is just eye popping rates in some ways, but it is also they do have to. There's lots of laws about how to disclose it, and they do have to do that. The other thing that was interesting, he said they used to do basically three year contracts, and then with all the prices going up, they've gone to four year and then to five year contracts, but the

Speaker 1  01:39
but the payoff has consistently been about 22 months, even as the contracts have gotten, law got longer. Yeah, got oh, wait, that's hilarious.

Unknown Speaker  01:59
That was probably

Speaker 1  02:02
when they were Trying to switch Mike I

Unknown Speaker  02:31
I'm Oh, okay,

Unknown Speaker  02:50
sorry, Ops is trying to

Speaker 1  03:00
opsis was trying To change my ivory Tools account type, and they just nuked my Zoom account. I think so. So, so the fact that people pay it off early is a good sign. I mean, if so, it's it's not, I mean, it's still pretty painful, but at least it's not, and they have that option. They also the option not to pay back. And anyway, I think, I think I feel comfortable with it. So I Okay, yeah, not sure it's a business that myself would go into, but it doesn't feel I, after talking with I was like, I think this is not, I mean, I think it's, it is a it's, I feel comfortable building software for it. So, sure. Okay, so I think the big thing question he has is, what is this thing going to cost, which ISIS, you know, actually figuring that out specifically is, I mean, that's a tough question for sure, but I think we jump in and see what we can do, right?

Unknown Speaker  04:12
Let's see, do you

Speaker 1  04:15
want to share your screen and we go for it? Sure. Did you

Matthias Miller  04:24
just working out of here? Or did Sean? I guess I could see if did Sean do? I don't think he didn't. No,

Unknown Speaker  04:32
okay, all right,

Matthias Miller  04:36
all right. So then let's do I

Unknown Speaker  05:06
Ah, there we go. So we

Unknown Speaker  05:22
have so we have, we

Unknown Speaker  05:26
don't have one in there yet now, gracious templates, I

Unknown Speaker  05:51
should I?

Unknown Speaker  05:56
Should I be

Unknown Speaker  05:58
typing in stuff for you while you estimate,

Unknown Speaker  06:04
Yeah, we could let me share my

Unknown Speaker  06:19
All right?

Speaker 2  06:21
I we have

Matthias Miller  06:35
might want to have like five lines at the top for whiskey stuff. Sure send me links, sure. Here is

Unknown Speaker  06:59
that one.

Matthias Miller  07:02
There's the here's the Google Doc. I'm

Unknown Speaker  07:23
Yeah, so, so.

Unknown Speaker  07:51
I have no idea how to even begin.

Matthias Miller  08:01
Manufacturer portal for contract submission. I mean, I wonder if some of this can be, if all of this has to be a whiskey,

Speaker 1  08:14
yeah, why would the manufacturer have to have a whiskey? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  08:22
if think the biggest tree

Matthias Miller  08:37
we had one

Speaker 3  08:39
where I contract entry.

Matthias Miller  08:48
We talked about three different ways to do contract entry. One is one is a whiskey. One is the contract entry record that has x 30s in the back end after you save and then the other one is just existing silver records. You create the contract, you select the customer, and create it if they don't exist, and add the building if it doesn't exist, etc.

Speaker 1  09:13
I see, well, I mean, so if you'd have a whiskey, it could just, it could be a relatively simple whiskey that would request the core, basic information that you're needing.

Matthias Miller  09:30
Yeah, in an ideal world, you would have a JavaScript PDF viewer on the left that would show your PDF, and you'd be able to select text and drag it over into text boxes in the right or something like that,

Unknown Speaker  09:42
or even just a click to copy

Matthias Miller  09:47
feature of some kind.

Unknown Speaker  09:49
So what are you copying over?

Matthias Miller  09:51
So they may have a I think most times, well, I.

Matthias Miller  10:05
You would upload the signed contract, and then you would implement. You would enter the information from the signed contract. So what's the building? What was the customer, name, address, phone number, what's the value terms, etc.

Speaker 1  10:22
So is the sign contract not generated from our system?

Matthias Miller  10:28
Signature? Obviously isn't.

Matthias Miller  10:36
I was thinking

Unknown Speaker  10:38
the answer is. I yes,

Matthias Miller  10:43
no, I was thinking, I mean, like, typically, I think there is a phase at which it might be, but typically the contract would be generated by something like the shut app or some equivalent system, sure, and you sure,

Speaker 1  11:15
we don't want to just have them key things in at this I mean, because if it's A Wait, but if it's a signed contract, this is we would be needing to do some kind of OCR to get the taxes. That's not no longer unless it's E signed. That's fair. It's if it's C sign, that's true. I

Matthias Miller  11:34
don't I don't know that we need to do a copy and paste for the first iteration. Yeah, sure, but I think it seems likely that having a side by side view could be quite useful, sure, sure.

Matthias Miller  11:52
But then you know, but then the question really becomes, again, this is a scoping question. Do you do this as a whiskey or do you do to me that? I mean, the entry record is kind of the okay. I was telling Dwayne, like, look, this is why you pay people $5 an hour from the Philippines, and they smile every day entering this information, right? He's like, yes, but from a sales perspective, when I'm selling it, I want to sell it as this is so easy to enter this stuff in or

Matthias Miller  12:34
and so for that reason, I wonder if the contract entry record might not be, I don't know might be a better first iteration, especially if we're looking to do long term integration at some point.

Unknown Speaker  12:51
Right, right?

Speaker 1  13:01
So do you have that specked out as I mean, so is this a data model here right now, for

Matthias Miller  13:07
this data model, okay,

Speaker 1  13:11
for most of the core stuff, we'll have to go back and fill out a bunch of short other pieces. So, so this is actually contract submission, maybe in in in system, right?

Matthias Miller  13:26
In which case I would think that even with the fields in X 30s, it's what, maybe a week, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:40
So this would be, I don't know,

Matthias Miller  13:55
contract submission. This is priced within silver loo, yep.

Speaker 3  14:02
Um, Customer Portal.

Matthias Miller  14:06
I mean, this one is just like, I don't know, like, you really do need, you need a mobile friendly it does not need to have offline support. I don't believe you need a mobile friendly way to for customers to go see all of their account information. And if I had to make while the hand wavy decisions, I mean, it's stuff like, obviously login and payments and all these other kinds of stuff, if I had to make hand wavy gestures, it would be something like 10 to 15k

Unknown Speaker  14:48
let's just do 15k to get started. And I can actually enter that maybe we should. Actually swap roles, but,

Matthias Miller  15:05
sure, I don't care, merchant processor, go for integration. Well, I mean, we can, I don't know we can. Let me, let me mean, try a hybrid approach to merchant account processor integration. So I'm thinking authorize.net, on this or so, and or stripe, and so it seems to me, like, but I don't know, like, why not work with the gateway, and then they can use whatever merchant processor they want

Unknown Speaker  15:39
to, like, authorize.net I'm trying

Matthias Miller  15:45
to think Google deposit works with let me check what they Say, what gateways they're working with.

Matthias Miller  15:56
Deposit. Let's see. I

Unknown Speaker  16:11
pause it authorized. Yes, I'm human. I

Unknown Speaker  16:27
This is

Unknown Speaker  16:47
okay, success, payment gateways.

Matthias Miller  16:51
I mean, I'll authorize that net, I think I would probably say price for authorize.net and stripe. It seems to me like that's the 8020, and I don't know what that is. Is it? I mean, I think fundamentally it's it's tokens, it's authorizations, it's all this stuff, but I guess it needs to be coded into the database. We might need payout logic, and so we just make up a $15,000 number as well. Sure, I

Matthias Miller  17:46
sales tax support we have not fully specced out. So if we use a submission record, presumably we have a trigger on save that goes out and calculates it and checks it and stomps it back in. So

Matthias Miller  18:07
and I don't know how to price that 7500

Unknown Speaker  18:13
some of this may be high, but

Matthias Miller  18:16
I don't know what else to do. Overdue payments dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  18:21
This one.

Matthias Miller  18:24
Let's get back to and see if it's covered elsewhere. Role based, admin portal. I don't think this is really, I don't know. I mean, I don't know that there's not much specific with it, but we could integrate it here. Secure document handling

Unknown Speaker  18:51
is just I

Unknown Speaker  19:07
I think it's just permissioning, depreciation. I

Matthias Miller  19:20
I wonder how much of this stuff is on the building record. I

Matthias Miller  20:06
Declining

Unknown Speaker  20:08
some of the years.

Matthias Miller  20:18
I think, on the data model. The one thing we're missing here is, I think we should have something somewhere around

Speaker 4  20:30
depreciate, depreciation method.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
And I

Unknown Speaker  20:52
um, I don't know if this is I

Unknown Speaker  21:08
book value Beginning times two.

Matthias Miller  21:19
That's book value beginning of year,

Unknown Speaker  21:38
and I'm I

Unknown Speaker  21:43
Don't know that you need asset class. I

Unknown Speaker  22:03
uh, and something like,

Matthias Miller  22:12
some of this is really not clear. Like, do buildings have? If you have a 12 by 32 or 14 by 40, do you use a 20% salvage value or or into use a 20% salvage value across the board or, and do you use longer terms for bigger buildings to use shorter terms.

Unknown Speaker  22:49
Now, you might have multiple terms, wouldn't you?

Unknown Speaker  22:54
Or is this on the contract?

Matthias Miller  22:57
My thought the contract? My thought is on the con? Well, no, on the building. You would specify depreciation on the building record. We have a building record, and so I suspect somewhere we need some kind of definition and and maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's more like a depreciation rule, or depreciation rules that are defined somewhere where, if you have a building that's this many square feet, then you use this salvage value and or term.

Unknown Speaker  23:40
So you think they want a different for different sizes? Well,

Matthias Miller  23:42
I don't, but I guess I don't, I don't know. Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  23:55
Have default settings, and they can always change if they want to depreciation. Will speculate like this depreciation method.

Unknown Speaker  24:05
Does this apply to both tax and Book value?

Unknown Speaker  24:20
So

Unknown Speaker  24:31
what is the i

Unknown Speaker  25:05
General,

Matthias Miller  25:08
2% or energy declining balance.

Unknown Speaker  25:16
All right, this is a i

Matthias Miller  25:58
Okay, all right, so we will, but then On the building, record

Unknown Speaker  26:12
buildings,

Unknown Speaker  26:20
book, depreciation

Unknown Speaker  26:25
method,

Matthias Miller  26:27
salvage, salvage value in dollars, term in years,

Matthias Miller  26:40
date, depreciation, and then a current book value, and then you have tax depreciation. So

Unknown Speaker  27:03
F year

Matthias Miller  27:06
applies to 40% greater than replaced in the last quarter of

Matthias Miller  27:19
the year. I don't know if it's exactly like this, but I'm

Matthias Miller  27:43
editable, historical depreciation events With permission control visibility. So here we need I

Matthias Miller  28:07
something like that, and I'm

Matthias Miller  28:27
all right, so that takes care of most of the depreciation issue and logistics tracking retrievals. We'll get to I'm

Matthias Miller  28:47
so then we have

Matthias Miller  28:56
you would like to integrate accounting out of the gate.

Speaker 4  29:02
I so I don't, isn't that? I mean,

Speaker 1  29:09
isn't that a bigger okay, how do I think? Do you

Speaker 1  29:20
don't you think there are people, I mean, do we have to do two accounting implementations? I'm just imagine there's people that will hate the software because of the accounting. There might be others who like it because of that,

Matthias Miller  29:35
well, but, I mean, but isn't this something that can be turned on and off? Like, sure, sure. For now, the only accounting we do is integrated accounting, writing our accounting system. The advantage is that this is such a stupid, simple, yeah, finances, this is not, this is not a manufacturing company. Exactly fair, and so we need to know detail. About where things are posted. The other thing that's in our in our favor is that this is like, I feel like Assist is like high school or college level inspiration, and this, I think, feels like elementary school. And I don't think I'm exaggerating. Yeah, now,

Matthias Miller  30:25
I think it's very likely to introduce support issues, but I don't know that that's an implementation cost. But right? I don't know that that's our responsibility. I think there's a question for what you want out of the gate, just for the accounting system. I

Unknown Speaker  31:12
do we have any sense? How many clients he's talking about?

Matthias Miller  31:16
Does he have any sense? Dozens? I talked to a guy in Wichita that runs a accounting RTO software wouldn't be for Dwayne. I would be having deeper conversations. He's dying to speed up diversions and implementations from RTO Pro. And I think I have a really good shot at hoping being able to help him pull it off. Wow. Not particularly interested in going head to head against Dwayne if not going to do this project. I'm also not interested in leaving money, money sitting on the, on the on the table. Good money sitting on the table, if, if he's not going to do it. So sure. So there's a, there's a the in the RTO world, and I think even in the shed industry as a whole, we've gotten to the tipping point where people are past the Why would we even need software? Sure, sure. And now we're, we're past the early adopter stage. And he said they're, they're implementing one a week, one company a week, yeah, but he wants to take it up to five. So,

Unknown Speaker  32:32
yeah, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  32:34
So he's implementing RTO pro. He's implementing, no, he has his own software. He's, he's migrating people off RTO, pro Got it, got it, which is the behemoth, Windows based or whatever. Yeah, I

Speaker 3  33:21
um, I so, I

Matthias Miller  33:25
guess that's something you have to answer. I don't know what that

Unknown Speaker  33:30
the so. So

Speaker 1  33:33
what we have been saying is 195 I'm trying to think through, well, what does that I mean, as far as, okay, he's a partner. So from an implementation standpoint, I just think it's whatever it takes to tie it in. Then I then it's then I need to decide, well, what's a fair price to, I mean, to say that this is, well, this is what you need to, I mean, is it 195 to to integrate it? I Yeah. I also get the, you know, we also get the 10 ish percent or whatever when he

Matthias Miller  34:11
every time he sells it or whatever he sells it, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  34:18
Well, I

Matthias Miller  34:32
um, I think you're going to be happier long term with MRR on it, as long as you're not direct losing, direct costs on the well, maybe, okay, put on your analysis hat. Yeah, if he pulls the trigger on it, it drops 200 grand on the project or whatever. Yep, what's the likelihood that he's going to be able to sell. All 20 grand a year of subscriptions, or whatever that's going to be, or of implementation plus subscriptions or more. Yeah, right. And what's going to be the lifetime value I'm going to I can't imagine that if he actually does what he says he's going to do, that lifetime value is not going to be five or 10 years on the right, right on these clients, yeah, and so if you're confident in his ability to pull it off, yeah, my suspicion is you'll be happier getting MRR on the subscription on it long term then, but if you're but we've also both been in places where somebody's talked a big game, and it's always harder to execute than it is, though, than people think it is, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:46
well, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  35:48
my thought is, okay,

Speaker 1  35:58
um, having lots of people in accounting does feel like a bit of a of a long term. I mean, both of encouragement and a bit of a cost as well. So I mean, I guess I'm kind of sticking with 195 unless you should tell you to tell me I should go up or down, or that I should consider going up or down, but there would be, it'd be, there wouldn't be any, there's no cost for him. He can just flip it on. He just pays me when, when people start using it.

Unknown Speaker  36:34
Sure. I mean,

Matthias Miller  36:37
I suspect this is also something depends how negotiable you are, but he may want, end up wanting to negotiate in some way, or he may have input and want to negotiate one way or the other, Sure, sure.

Unknown Speaker  36:56
And I think that's that's fair.

Matthias Miller  37:01
The you Yeah, I think it's reasonable. Okay, so, okay, so we have the accounting impact, and I don't know how to do this contract signature. I mean, a lot of this stuff comes down to fundamentally, what are the events? We export it to flat file. We sync it up with accounting.

Unknown Speaker  37:30
And, I mean,

Matthias Miller  37:35
it's maybe a day with two days of of overhead on the whole accounting impact thing for I mean, it's so hand wavy, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:46
yeah.

Matthias Miller  37:51
So then we have the payments record. And I just think this is

Unknown Speaker  38:05
maybe two

Matthias Miller  38:13
I don't know not to support is going to be, I don't know, two days of refactoring to pull it across. Now,

Unknown Speaker  38:34
do you think there's any

Speaker 1  38:41
How much is this the main place that we're actually pulling, clearly, pulling stuff across. I mean, we've always said that we retain the rights to whatever we build.

Matthias Miller  38:53
Yes, this is the only place off the top of my head that I'm aware of. My argument, for not sure, is that not in my mind, even check writing deposits? Yeah, those in my mind, there's so like, there is nothing proprietary about that. Really, what they're doing is saying, we get accounting for a low fee per month and and we build, we pay for development and sure all is good,

Speaker 1  39:24
yep, yep. So part of what you're saying is not just, should just be part of accounting anyway,

Matthias Miller  39:31
I I think so. I mean, I, like you guys, might want to end up using notch at some point. Yep. Now it doesn't. The only thing is, I mean, there is no, basically not sure. Is its own independent little thing with customization thrown in that fits in with IMS or with the. The the inventory management stuff, the IMS record by itself is just an IMS or, sorry, the notch record itself is just really a notch a file. And then you just, you have a base, vanilla notch file, and you throw in records, or you throw yields, or whatever you need to populate, populate it and link it appropriately.

Unknown Speaker  40:25
So how much did affordable barn pay for NACHA?

Matthias Miller  40:30
It was under 10 for sure.

Unknown Speaker  40:36
Yeah, does

Unknown Speaker  40:41
QuickBooks have not just support out of the gate? I don't know.

Speaker 5  40:56
The others plugins that do plugins, right? Yeah, so that's those are cheap, usually, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:06
fine, fine.

Matthias Miller  41:19
Interesting. Here's one that's $40 a month, anywhere from, yeah, 40 210

Unknown Speaker  41:26
depending on the

Speaker 1  41:31
and, well, now that's also a fair question whether there should be, and I don't know how this should happen, but long term, should there be? Although, I mean, right now, our accounting is just so embarrassing that you kind of want to give the people what they can. But long term, should there be? Should there be opt in fees? Like, if you take notch, it's an extra $50 a month. And if you take, and I don't know what other things like that. There's there should be, right? Because your base, your base person, doesn't need, not sure. And if you need not, you're at a scale where you're willing to pay for it. So,

Matthias Miller  42:20
yeah, I mean, there's also the check writing issue. Yes, most people want, I mean, we don't actually need here, so we're all doing handwritten checks, I think.

Unknown Speaker  42:29
But

Matthias Miller  42:34
if you go down that route, then all of a sudden it applies to everyone. But you have support for and we have, we have dynamic check positioning, yep, but,

Unknown Speaker  42:48
but, but, yeah, yep, okay,

Matthias Miller  42:56
straight payouts. Now, I guess this is another one potentially. I Okay, and also authorize that net payouts. And I don't know if this falls under No, not really, because we still have to do a county impact integration and stuff like that, and we have a straight payout record, much of which could probably be reused in some capacity. Authorize that net, not so much, unless we genericize it, plus you have accounting impact. And I just, it just feels so clear.

Matthias Miller  43:56
All right, now we're getting into future phases. Let's or revenue.

Speaker 1  43:59
Do you want to go ahead and maximize your screen there, and we'll just go hand wavy here. See what we think about phase one. Sure. There we go. Yeah. Okay, so now and when you were bidding these, were you bidding these for a US developer, or for a

Unknown Speaker  44:21
US, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  44:33
Say for and I guess those could get pretty okay, so that's, that's phase one there, but not the data model we got. So now let's get down to Data Model. Aha, sure.

Unknown Speaker  44:46
Silver loop settings is like

Unknown Speaker  44:52
one maybe

Matthias Miller  44:54
RTO company, and it was point five. Save depreciation method. We got rid of contracts.

Matthias Miller  45:18
Link to company payments. I'm going to save this one

Unknown Speaker  45:27
two days,

Matthias Miller  45:30
then we have the payment, just because of the calculations, it's going to be 1.5 it's going to be two days because we're going to need a people are going to need to understand dwf and all these other weird things and balance stuff. Um, contacts we have.

Unknown Speaker  45:53
How does this one actually work? This one does a

Matthias Miller  45:59
Okay, include fixed cost. So the contacts, we said customized contacts, I think, is 1000 is that right? Yeah. And then we also have some customization, including have a gracious risk scoring variables. I

Matthias Miller  46:40
I'm not sure what I meant by this. This is a little embarrassing. Risk

Matthias Miller  47:09
scoring variables. We're going to collect and store risk string, variables, um,

Matthias Miller  47:27
but we're going to throw on an extra couple days for that, because We just don't know.

Unknown Speaker  47:35
Product detail screen.

Matthias Miller  47:39
Oh, gracious. I Let's go back up here. Building manufacturer.

Matthias Miller  47:58
Okay, I'm gonna guess on the building. This is very unclear, but it's manufacturer primary identification, Number, length, width,

Unknown Speaker  48:18
color, model style,

Unknown Speaker  48:31
build date, I'm

Matthias Miller  48:45
I mean, this is just a I know this isn't everything, but yeah, Of course.

Matthias Miller  48:58
Well, let's do this and then depreciation. I is going to be an import, and that's going to be like, I don't know. I'm scared four days, yeah,

Speaker 1  49:10
and I'm gonna have to drop in eight minutes or something. So, oh boy. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  49:18
Track scripts.

Speaker 1  49:22
Do you just want to show me how far data models go? Oh, no, you're almost done. Okay, recording and stuff like that. I wonder if we should go high level for a bit here, and then you decide if you drive ahead or if we just get to schedule a second call. I

Speaker 1  49:52
The is, the is the 10 to 40% padding, about minus 10 plus 40, about right if. Do you think on this one, the you know, within the places where we use your time, that's also going to substantially impact costs? So it almost makes you wonder if we should, I don't know what either jump the 40 or rename the section 174 up charge to something else, right?

Matthias Miller  50:34
There's a lot of places here for bad surprises. Yes, yeah. Now you could do, you could still do a design, a $12,000 design, that's fair. That will narrow it down, that will help. But I do think you could easily add, I don't know, like I mean, but okay. Another way to look at it is that we are. It's more comfortable to say, well, we kind of think, we just think there's a lot of bad surprises in here, and we think it's 100 to 130 right where we're at, or 140 right where we're at, right, where you make it even a little bigger, 100 150 right where we're at, right? The only way we can nail it down is we gotta get the details fleshed out right now, Dwayne, if you've got

Unknown Speaker  51:32
a slushy budget, yeah, right. Yeah. And I Okay,

Speaker 1  51:43
and, you know, we can keep going. So that's kind of my sense, is that,

Speaker 1  51:54
and or if you say, Let's go bare bones, we can, you know, we're willing to also start implementing going bare bones,

Unknown Speaker  52:02
right? So totally.

Matthias Miller  52:07
I mean, if we run a lean ship with a keen eye, yeah, and we have project management design calls that are booked it 45 minutes, and we hop on and knock stuff out and hop off and do that instead of 90 minute calls, and Dwayne knows that all his chitter chatter is being paid for out of his pocket. Yep, there's a lot that we could do and with very hyper focus, yeah,

Speaker 1  52:38
what if you would change the on this one, what if you change the padding to 0% minus? Because I I just don't think we're going to go less. And then the plus is, you know, is it 60? Is it 80?

Unknown Speaker  53:01
And I guess that's without adding additional stuff.

Matthias Miller  53:10
We could put this whoops, ah, stop. We can make this the bad, bad surprise charge, yeah, which is like,

Unknown Speaker  53:23
I was gonna say 22

Matthias Miller  53:26
Yeah, super precise. I mean, that actually gets us really close to actually 102 I mean, that's really conservative, but not completely wrong. I mean, I say conservative, we think it's conservative on the upper end, right, right? But,

Unknown Speaker  53:43
yeah, yeah. And I,

Unknown Speaker  53:52
yeah,

Speaker 1  53:55
okay. And I think part of why it makes us more variable is he's really trying to get this good enough to sell was just, you know, if it's one person you're trying to make happy, it's all, I think that's part of what it is, actually, right?

Speaker 5  54:10
And the Yeah, how much more stuff

Speaker 1  54:19
are you going to be filling in? Is this, is this 100, 200 this 100 to 160 suddenly going to charge up 220 to 200

Matthias Miller  54:32
Well, I mean, it's not, not necessarily for phase one, because risk scoring is at phase three, and your reporting and stuff is already mostly baked in cash. Cash flow analysis is revenue projections. I think merchant fee asset management

Speaker 1  54:52
and the bad surprises are not going to be detail screens and reports,

Matthias Miller  54:57
not in Kansas. No. And I think if we. Actually, Dwayne, we're gonna to cut costs. You're gonna build your own reports in the User folder, and we'll clean them up and put them in the standard folder. Sure. I mean, he wants to, if he wants to, he might actually kind of enjoy that control,

Unknown Speaker  55:16
right? I

Speaker 1  55:23
it. What level specking Do you think we want to have on the end system then, I don't know. I think what we do is, is we tell, we tell Kansas try to be kind of like Tim, and we know they won't be. And that's about right?

Unknown Speaker  55:43
It's probably fair.

Matthias Miller  55:46
I really wish there'd be a way to put documentation in the Catalog Editor and be able to generate the spec from the catalog in some fashion. That's interesting. The biggest thing we need would be a descriptor on there's a lot of things you could do with the help and description category and I mean, I'm basically doing a variant of this already for myself, but then a kind of a, what is this record level like, a help description on the record level and some other documentation records, perhaps, but interesting.

Speaker 1  56:22
Oh, Okey doke, well, so, so we kind of think that we are, it's reasonable to ballpark like 100 160 for build out.

Matthias Miller  56:33
I think phase one. Yes, phase one, if you're clear about phase one. Now, if you need to price the whole thing, that's a big scary, I don't know. I Yes, yeah.

Speaker 1  56:46
And that is, if we don't get too many exciting gleams in our eye as we're going out. I mean, we think, as we expected, it's 100 260 if we, if

Unknown Speaker  56:57
you're going to get

Speaker 1  56:59
creative on us, then you're gonna have to start adding numbers to that. So, yep. Okay, very good. Thank you, sir. Yep. Thanks.
