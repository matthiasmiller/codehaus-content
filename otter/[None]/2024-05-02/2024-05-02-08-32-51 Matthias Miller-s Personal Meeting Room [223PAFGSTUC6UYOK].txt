Unknown Speaker  00:41
Hello, hello

Matthias Miller  00:48
I'm not sure how to handle this. I haven't heard from you guys in a couple of days.

Speaker 1  00:53
We just that our heads down the hall so far that you're just going to hear

Matthias Miller  00:59
muffled screams or something

Speaker 2  01:06
a lot of good, good things have happened in in the meantime. So.

Unknown Speaker  01:12
Awesome. Good No

Unknown Speaker  01:26
Wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  01:29
guys hear me okay

Speaker 2  01:40
so sorry I didn't actually reach out. But we we do we're at a point where we do want to take some time today and prioritize projects that we last we pushed off last week because we heard Yeah.

Matthias Miller  02:01
All right. Sounds good. Well, why don't we Why don't we go ahead and do that? Wait for Georgia Hyjal a hail. Hello. Hey, Joe, you've got a hard stop at internet in 55 minutes. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  02:21
That's right.

Matthias Miller  02:22
Okay. So we'll just keep that in mind. If there's anything we need before then. Or anything we need from you. We'll get it done before then. And I think it will, we'll go ahead and it sounds good to you, Mark, just jump in and start with the prioritization. Yeah. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  02:49
See me hear me got the share screen going on here. Okay, great. Cool. All right. So we should just start at the top, I guess and see where we're at. Yeah. So we still had this depreciation for closing books, you know, enter several of these using standard procedure for Mark. Is that still happening?

Unknown Speaker  03:11
This is done. Done.

Speaker 3  03:13
Okay. How about support invoicing for wholesale build on site from Matthias Mark, this

Matthias Miller  03:21
should be live. Is there anything that you want from me on this?

Speaker 2  03:28
No, other than theirs. Yeah, that's I just need some clarification at some point on they're working correctly on the sales orders meeting invoicing report. What I'm not sure is do they need you when they do a build on site does the transit task also have to be completed in order for it to work correctly in all areas of accounting and finished goods? What happens if a building is marked complete? Smart build, we mark we invoice it? Do we also have to have it updated and logistics to show? I would say that neither we don't have to change that now. Unless you know the Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:20
I'm not aware of any special handling unless you're unless you have some kind of labor intensive building rule that adjusts that okay good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:36
That that's done.

Speaker 3  04:37
Okay. Good market is done. Yes. The bias create a process for moving payments from one sales order to another

Matthias Miller  04:54
which should this has been languishing for a while but

Matthias Miller  05:03
It's still going to take some it's going to take some attention for me to shouldn't take longer it'll take some attention to get it off to Jonathan mark where do you see this?

Speaker 2  05:15
I'd say it's a low priority we pushed it out long enough and it's not so

Unknown Speaker  05:21
yeah

Matthias Miller  05:25
so do we want to push it out to do we want to push everything that we're not going to get to out to something like July or what are you thinking?

Unknown Speaker  05:32
Yeah, I'd say yeah

Speaker 3  05:42
drew the track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation Event Log said it was working but to us refinement bumping to mid April. How are we doing on that

Unknown Speaker  05:57
Oh,

Speaker 1  06:00
um, the report is what is what can use some refining? Um, I don't know here again is not really something we need right now. Like we have works I just would not want to print out

Unknown Speaker  06:21
some of those were like 85 pages long Yeah, it just needs some formatting so that it's not okay.

Speaker 2  06:29
That's a big Yeah. And when we want to print it out, just to have a hardcopy just

Speaker 1  06:36
Yeah, I don't know that we don't really want to print it out. But it just it just as

Unknown Speaker  06:42
a human That's right.

Speaker 2  06:46
Oh, I'm just gonna ask him if you want to rent it, you could dump it into Excel. Like let's say you need it tomorrow and dump it in Excel and move it around till you have

Speaker 1  06:57
some money. Yeah, I mean, now it's, it's a PDF.

Matthias Miller  07:03
Yeah, it's a Word template. So do we get to that from the get go? You

Speaker 1  07:09
could copy the actual screen like you can do a copy and paste to the screen to excel

Matthias Miller  07:21
I wonder if this is a thing that we could fairly easily just say dear Jonathan, distinct grenson at some pages go fix and

Unknown Speaker  07:35
yeah, and

Matthias Miller  07:37
probably about as much time as we haven't managed to just get it done.

Speaker 1  07:42
The the ones with only like five transactions are generally at least two pages long. So

Unknown Speaker  07:52
I think that sounds reasonable was eyes

Matthias Miller  07:54
okay

Matthias Miller  08:07
okay, I decided to say I'm going to delegate to Jonathan and I'm trying to keep it on the radar it's not going to take much involvement for me and as soon as I get this written up then we can let's actually see, I would actually vote to close this one out. And I'm going to write up a new change request

Unknown Speaker  08:41
okay

Speaker 3  08:47
may find that when it's done and all associated so we know what's going on

Speaker 3  09:22
all right. Are we ready? We're ready. Okay. Allow company specific signature adjustments on the bias. You were going to check out there was an update Drew said it wasn't working last week spoke.

Matthias Miller  09:39
Yeah, it was implemented incorrectly. Which I'm not sure this is one that we can just drop in Jonathan's lap. Maybe we could

Unknown Speaker  09:54
what's the priority on this for you guys? Yeah, Not

Speaker 1  10:00
Hi. I mean, we're, we're using them. And we have more issues with you USPS not delivering, then we do.

Unknown Speaker  10:17
very competent July. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  10:19
wouldn't even I wouldn't have the reusability. All right.

Speaker 3  10:27
All right, Matthias, we've got show ending bank balance or credit card balance for pending items.

Matthias Miller  10:34
This isn't the vendor invoices needing payment, Drew, you mentioned wanting to be able to see what's the impact going to be when I go pay this?

Matthias Miller  10:48
And I think I think we said we need some design or some thought,

Speaker 4  10:53
as I recall. Yeah. Yeah. Like, basically.

Speaker 1  11:01
It is, and I'm, I'm not necessarily even doing the cash management.

Speaker 2  11:07
I mean, I think it'd be good to have, but should we respond to July? Yeah, this is usually going to license an issue, but okay.

Speaker 1  11:18
Well, and the other thing with that whole design is we're gonna think about it, there is a sweep attached to it. Because the ledger is gonna be at negative something, so it's not going to tell you it. Anyway, so

Speaker 2  11:37
we got to, in some ways, you'd have to do ledger choice.

Speaker 1  11:43
Right. Right. Like there'd have to be multiple things tied to it to actually

Speaker 3  11:48
be helpful. Okay. All right. How about handling historically reconciled transactions for shift reconcile numbers from the guys? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:02
There's a possibility that when somebody modifies a vendor invoice that it messes with your reconcile numbers. And so, what if it really bothers me, but it's not been at the top of the priority list? What? How do you guys feel about this?

Speaker 1  12:26
I mean, I would, yeah, it's, it's kind of handy, because there are ways that it does. It'll get rid of or change, reconciled stuff. But I would say it should go ahead have all the July stuff. To remain keep it and see what we have. What else we come up with?

Speaker 2  12:52
I think so. I mean, how often do we like we expected? Now that we've done first board, and we're closer, would you expect to see two per company per month? That shit? Well, my

Speaker 1  13:05
guess is we're gonna see the closer we are to current, the more we're going to see, because they'll go in and change something.

Speaker 2  13:14
And, and it being rankings, probably does not stop them.

Speaker 1  13:21
In all situations, I'm not sure what the situations are. But

Speaker 2  13:27
well, let's keep it on the priorities list. See what we have. Yeah. Prioritize.

Speaker 3  13:37
Sounds good. With the support for importing transaction line items was for Drew.

Unknown Speaker  13:46
Oh, that was the vendor. Yeah.

Speaker 3  13:47
It said it's done except for it works if the contract if the contract is a vendor. Yeah. There was some discussion here.

Matthias Miller  13:57
We talked about using matching employee names, I suggested vlookup to map from QuickBooks over to or something along those lines just to get the spreadsheet to do what it needs to. But I don't know if you guys handle it in the spreadsheet level. I don't know if you guys figured that out. Or if we need to do

Speaker 2  14:15
what's been dependent what's going to be the benefit of doing this? Is it for handwritten checks? Kevin, the name there for reconciled?

Speaker 1  14:25
Yeah. Well, that and for our payroll transactions. So that we have like, currently, we're throwing the vendor name and the reference number into the notes. And so if we can, if we can get those into their correct fields, then it will sort proper

Speaker 2  14:52
like on a transactions by contact with protocol, yeah, but it was still so it would, it would only apply it For the ones that,

Speaker 1  15:00
you know, like here, those check numbers would be over here. And then it would sort in line with those. If you search for the, for the person, it would line out. So, yeah, transactions by contact, or Forbes, well,

Speaker 2  15:17
but can't we just use what we have? Can we? What do we need to do to just put the check number girl close? Like, could we just change? Because we only have a small amount of employees and getting hand written checks and the other saw are going to be lumped together as one? Or would they not? Would you see is? Um,

Speaker 1  15:40
there might be some other uses. But I don't know that. They're not as big as

Speaker 2  15:47
it sounds like we can easily do the check number with the check number, the reference. Is there a way to do that with what we have now? By just changing the imports?

Speaker 1  16:01
No, I think the Matthias, you might know better than me, but I'm pretty sure the reference is only per transaction. There's no line item.

Speaker 4  16:12
You might be right. And wouldn't know without looking it up.

Matthias Miller  16:17
If you if you well, we don't have a reference number on the line. And we do have notes and I'm not sure if that's included in the importer time.

Unknown Speaker  16:27
There there is a line item reference on the input. But the record just doesn't have a space for it. Is my recollection.

Unknown Speaker  16:42
That's weird.

Speaker 2  16:49
I should talk in a week go and make that important break down on the expensive side, break it down. Even if it's a lump sum payment, break it down. Well,

Unknown Speaker  17:01
what will we do multiple transactions. We put different different was that first number? Yeah, that code thing.

Speaker 2  17:15
But that actual code that

Speaker 1  17:18
matching code thing, matching key matching key? Can we do different matching keys and throw? No. Well, we could do we could put the we could put the liability payments on separately. We can we can do the payroll?

Speaker 2  17:38
Well, it sounds like I mean, should we? Could we bump this out to July and look at it?

Unknown Speaker  17:57
Okay, sounds good. All right, Matthias, how about streamlined vendor invoices, meeting payments?

Speaker 4  18:07
Up to 33 I don't know what it is we're for streamlining it.

Matthias Miller  18:13
Something was the the manual button only sometimes being visible, making the check button visible for all payment types. And the way to set payment types is check ACH or other. Just, I guess the button the way the button works. And this thing is unwieldy.

Unknown Speaker  18:32
Maybe not too intuitive.

Matthias Miller  18:37
Drew to it. See this affects you.

Speaker 1  18:39
Yeah. Um, I know how to use it. And at this point, we're not having anybody else try to use it. So I think we're fine to push it out. July or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  18:56
know that's actually Joel or Josh, that handles ACH. Was there was that one there? Was that one element that's not working? Yeah.

Speaker 3  19:12
Okay, let's see. vendor invoices, validate against link ledger account or ledger accounts for ledger accounts.

Matthias Miller  19:19
So basically, I think what we're gonna say is, if a ledger account doesn't translate to a GL account, you can't save the vendor invoice. Or well, we're going to talk about it. Do we hide it from the list? Do we want to unsaved do we air out? Do we need to talk to Dwayne and his team on how we want to handle it? But can we keep them from creating it? We might it's becoming less of an issue, I think but we want to keep them from creating these because they won't be able to get pushed to a county

Matthias Miller  20:02
There is another really crafty idea we can do. If we had a, I don't know what other expense account or something like that, where, instead of not pushing it to accounting, we would push it to accounting. And if there's, if there's a debit credit imbalance, we will put the balance into that account. Or if there's an account that can't be mapped correctly, we put it into that account, it would still get pushed through accounting, but you would notice it in the reconcile or while you would notice it on the income statement that

Unknown Speaker  20:31
you get stuff showing up there.

Speaker 1  20:35
But they just have to know what to do. Like I would say, don't just be some pop up, you cannot do this recode to unchain expenses for something well, but I would tell them, but wouldn't want to do,

Speaker 2  20:48
wouldn't we want to just automate, like, they're happily doing their thing, selecting what they think is right, and it shows up over there.

Speaker 1  21:02
It would be nice if it would automatically generate a note that, you know, they would plug in their thing, they would go save, it would say, oh, you can't ever never tell them. But it's just saying, you know, plus and such line was, was coded to this, but which is not mapped, you know, like, so that when I open up on categorize, expand, and so that I realize what's going on, because I'm afraid, just gonna be like, Oh, well, they should have put it to this account. And so I'm gonna try and you know, the whole thing again?

Matthias Miller  21:37
Well, the other option is we keep the current behavior, don't push it to accounting, and we give you I mean, we have a report that's, that is supposed to show you all the errors. It might just be a matter of let's see, I mean, first of all, we want to make sure that these are actually meaningful. But if they are, we could send you daily emails, weekly emails, something with a here's a list of them. That's a fairly easy. I'd be a fairly easy thing we could.

Speaker 1  22:18
Yeah, just. I mean, it would, well, I guess you could probably discovered anyway, you do it. But I would say a daily email or something? Like, if there were some that are created?

Matthias Miller  22:37
Do you only want new ones? Or do you want to give me send you an email with all of them that have errors? Sorry? Do you only want to see new ones that were created? Or do you want to see old ones? So it'll keep sending you emails every day until you get it fixed?

Unknown Speaker  22:53
Um

Speaker 1  23:03
I mean, if it's a if it just has a link in to the ones that are the ones that are needing fixed, I would say just put everything in that's needing fixed.

Unknown Speaker  23:16
Sure,

Unknown Speaker  23:17
but should it do it every day until they get? There's not going to be that many. It probably should.

Speaker 1  23:31
Okay, I mean, because as long as we're not creating any new accounts, or the system's not crashing and forgetting something, like there, once I fixed one, it should be fixed from then on out. So it's not like it's not like Uncategorized expenses where we get some random thing and you know, it's not something like that

Unknown Speaker  24:00
alright,

Unknown Speaker  24:02
well, where should we put this? On a date?

Matthias Miller  24:06
Let's see. 920 4am I moved to can we? I guess no. Yeah, back to you guys. I think I can delegate this to Jonathan. And have him reach out if he's got questions.

Unknown Speaker  24:30
As long as it goes

Matthias Miller  24:34
as far as your priority, do you have you guys want to set?

Speaker 1  24:49
I don't know it's not as high as some of the things we got but maybe, maybe make it be June 1 thing

Speaker 2  24:59
I I think we could do July 1 is stuff that sometime June 1 is stuff like this that and then the rest of the prioritize does that sound fair to you in class like

Unknown Speaker  25:18
ready to move on credit memos

Speaker 2  25:26
okay is this with like doing credits handling credit

Matthias Miller  25:32
okay this is yeah this is yesterday

Speaker 2  25:35
we want to discuss priorities on this I think this is the whole credits refunds thing is our top priority from what we see and yeah so

Unknown Speaker  25:59
okay for Matthias revised purchase order exports

Unknown Speaker  26:04
the 931

Speaker 4  26:16
I'm going to bump this over to Jonathan and see if this is something he can take

Matthias Miller  26:28
mark this is the received column second avoid second page if possible Is this a June or July thing okay why it will take much this or yeah adding the repair risky received quantity and then seeing if we can get it down to single page with the example with an example of that you so

Speaker 2  26:55
yeah, I would say that that's well here's all that was we've talked about Yeah, this we talked about this with Josh the other day as well because we want to make a number of changes to this and I think what he said was well figure out what you want to do. And then he said send it to me and I'll probably send it off to someone so I would almost vote to close this and we just make this change part of the the really the other revisions that we want to make too and just haven't done yet that was easy All right.

Speaker 3  27:53
Okay, we have do checks linked to vendor invoice

Matthias Miller  27:57
so this is live except it's not a link it's a button and a shop and email I think Jonathan would change it to a link so I would still keep it open but drew there there is a button in the payment section for view checks that

Unknown Speaker  28:17
don't need AR AP

Speaker 3  28:25
great Oh, a friendly way to lock historical transactions for accounting impacts.

Matthias Miller  28:33
Big word good here. Close it up. Excellent. Thanks to 60 Hang on let me let me make sure there's different slightly different variations

Unknown Speaker  28:45
Okay. Link tasks to it so

Unknown Speaker  28:50
latest statement

Matthias Miller  29:02
yeah this I mean this includes stuff with a statement ending date and such so making sure that

Unknown Speaker  29:17
work

Unknown Speaker  29:25
I got sidetracked looking for this fantastic button

Unknown Speaker  29:32
do not click the big blue button.

Speaker 3  29:37
Fantastic button sounds like it should be a team novel or

Matthias Miller  29:45
exactly. Yeah, okay, so

Unknown Speaker  29:49
we've closed out friendly way to lock historical trends.

Matthias Miller  29:52
Well, I don't actually know or we don't. Um this is the Let's keep the AP people from making changes to vendor invoices for things that have already been reconciled what's the end I assuming we still want to do that? We've got to design for this already written out that looks solid to me, but we can review it What's your priority for that?

Speaker 2  30:24
Well, how is this different from what we covered earlier? One of the first items on the agenda where we said where they can still make edits that affect

Speaker 2  30:45
they can make edits that they can edit a vendor invoice that has already been reconciled

Matthias Miller  30:58
on this case, but that one was was what that one would be I think is as long as the reconciled amount doesn't change, we preserve the reconciliation if it does change we may block

Speaker 4  31:19
we may block the accounting impact or just make it fail so we get a notice that I get a notice when you chase it

Matthias Miller  31:27
this would be do not let them modify even if they want to reassign a GL Account from a reconciled transaction they wouldn't be able to do that they would have to go through true

Speaker 2  31:40
Oh and this this would would cover more than just reconcile it would also cover transactions to accounts that are there is no reconciliation but we're saying if it's already in a closed period then you have no FTAs got it right so what happens currently if they make a change like that they just make a change the numbers change on the income statement as life goes on right now. That's is that what happens now?

Matthias Miller  32:09
Yeah, for 2024 changes to 2024 vendor invoices.

Speaker 2  32:15
Well, I think this should be pretty high priority because the closer we get I'd say for review in our priorities discussion with you.

Speaker 1  32:26
Yeah, I think so. Because you know, we have quarter one income statements for some now you know, and print those out and two weeks and have something shifted significantly it's going to be like another round of questions and vigor Yeah.

Matthias Miller  32:48
You don't want that Well, I

Unknown Speaker  32:50
don't mind it if it's legitimate but not dispersed

Speaker 3  33:00
All right, so I tagged that for an agenda discussion let's see changes for labor intensive buildings 9632 For Matthias Yeah, we

Matthias Miller  33:11
we wanted to labor intensive Effective Date field and the ability to I think change when it's applied some other things like that marketing

Unknown Speaker  33:25
at June 1 plus some yeah

Unknown Speaker  33:33
buyers take write offs from source bank accounts

Matthias Miller  33:40
this is I mean this goes into there's similar change requests written up about write offs and fees and premiums So Drew that's you raised it but

Unknown Speaker  33:55
yeah

Unknown Speaker  34:02
probably a June first thing

Unknown Speaker  34:09
okay

Speaker 3  34:12
about in the transactions or add a column for the general ledger account see if any speed can be gained.

Unknown Speaker  34:34
DREW I think this probably fix you wouldn't anybody?

Speaker 3  34:40
We're gonna send it let's say it said. My last note is Matthias and social talk. This is for the ledger report. Of ledger main transactions report. Maybe slow ledger report is running is read more critically about

Matthias Miller  34:59
it. What's the priority in these reports? speeds? That's the real question.

Unknown Speaker  35:08
What's the ledger? Or

Unknown Speaker  35:12
just in general,

Speaker 1  35:13
just general ledger showing everything? Okay. Um, I don't know. I mean, I avoid using them as, except for last resort. I mean, just actually, I've discovered that the transaction by contact, which essentially is the same thing is a lot faster. So maybe put them in put it? I don't even July.

Speaker 2  35:50
Unless this is something that can be shipped off to. Yeah, no, that doesn't take it up a lot of bias.

Matthias Miller  36:00
Then Joel, do you think Jonathan's at a point where he could troubleshoot indices and report speed and figure that out? Or is that pushing him?

Speaker 5  36:14
I'm not completely sure what the answer is, but we could explore. I mean, I could be paying LS and yeah, LS would have a better idea.

Unknown Speaker  36:28
Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  36:33
Well, I would say explore the explored and if, you know if it can be done without tying up biased and I'd say let's write quicker than later.

Speaker 3  36:51
Okay, Joe, I'm putting this on your list to explore that with us.

Unknown Speaker  36:55
Okay, well, I get a notification.

Speaker 3  36:59
That change. I'm not sure if you're there notification from clickup. But I could send you your updated list after we talked.

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Sure. That'd be awesome. Thank you.

Speaker 3  37:13
Okay, great. Now we've got so accessory GL accounts. That was an email.

Matthias Miller  37:22
We don't have any support for any special handling anymore for success. Three GL accounts, if I recall correctly,

Speaker 2  37:29
that July 1 is finite. Right now. It's all just lumped together but that's,

Unknown Speaker  37:37
that's, yeah. That's

Speaker 3  37:42
about the income statement for pole barn. Revenue. Let's put it on the priorities to call. Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Allow deactivating right off reasons in the BIOS updates. So

Matthias Miller  38:07
do we have any old ones that we want to deactivate?

Unknown Speaker  38:14
deactivate the right off. Yeah.

Speaker 2  38:20
The premiums? We did? Yeah, I don't

Unknown Speaker  38:30
like there were some that I just

Unknown Speaker  38:33
removed.

Speaker 1  38:35
Like, or I already did deactivate I thought. Okay. So I'm sure if there's no anything

Matthias Miller  38:48
there's nothing deactivated right now, I guess the the main thing is, this is like if you want to do something with it, like if you don't want to premiums showing up as a write off reason. We should deactivate it so people don't use it going forward.

Unknown Speaker  39:01
If there's others I'll just

Matthias Miller  39:07
leave in your court. Do you want to leave this open?

Speaker 1  39:15
Don't know that we need to, I mean, this pretty much would apply to freemium. Coming back, is what we want deactivate.

Speaker 2  39:28
What happens when you deactivate? So we discovered that doing RTO premiums as a write off doesn't work very well for two reasons. One is we're trying to parse the data into well, one it doesn't have a lot of as much value as we thought by attaching that to the sales orders, and the other one was the other reason was we're actually Receiving a check for, let's say, five different art five to one tech for five buildings. And you can't you can't deposit a ride oh, by the way, it's currently. But the the use case for this deactivating a write off is is if you had a an existing you were using the you were using an existing write off and suddenly you said that it's not worth tracking that anymore or we want to call it something else and you could you could deactivate it, it will no longer be there to select, but the ones that have the earlier transactions resulting from it, which would remain intact, right?

Unknown Speaker  40:47
Yeah, correct. Okay.

Speaker 2  40:52
So drew it sounds like you should see if there's any there that you don't want and tested and if it doesn't work then

Unknown Speaker  41:03
to go back on the list, but

Unknown Speaker  41:06
as far as we know, it's working. Is

Speaker 1  41:08
there any report available already that would show if these are like what write offs are being used or have been used on those

Matthias Miller  41:25
No, but I don't know if this this sales order report would be it wouldn't be completely unreasonable to add that as an option search option in a sales order to filter by right off

Speaker 4  41:47
if you would, if you would find that useful. Yeah.

Speaker 2  41:53
But you're asking was there a place where you can go to see what are all the existing write offs we have? Oh no,

Speaker 1  42:00
I can do that. I want to see which sales orders have they been used on you know, so that if there is a premiums I mean, it's gonna have to be fixed. And what I did with that one that we found is I I went to the deposit then and just added a line to make the deposit come out right made the check the right amount then went to deposit created an income line there.

Matthias Miller  42:31
I can I can quickly make you one and send it over to you. Okay, and if you want something more permanent than that then

Speaker 4  42:42
Yeah Okay

Speaker 3  42:53
sounds good. So I'm putting this in Drew's list and biases right in the report and drew we keep it April 25. Just kind of keeping it where it is on the list

Unknown Speaker  43:09
Yeah, okay.

Speaker 3  43:13
Okay, Joel Hi Joel. How about the Cash Flow Statement add Cash Flow Statement

Speaker 5  43:20
no progress. I am hoping to work on it in today and tomorrow. So

Unknown Speaker  43:31
keeping the date as is

Speaker 5  43:36
I am inclined to say yes unless others object

Speaker 3  43:45
I don't hear anything All right. Let's see I had something for Ben and I don't think Ben is here but we had put the process for splitting parent account into child accounts as a documentation task for Ben. We still want this on here.

Matthias Miller  44:07
I think we know it well enough among us that we can

Speaker 4  44:12
close it out. Okay. My vote Okay.

Speaker 3  44:21
Let's see for drew the kid bank, two sheets integrate with all banks. Is this still a task we need to be looking at here

Unknown Speaker  44:35
make it a July.

Unknown Speaker  44:38
Thank you.

Speaker 3  44:43
So we're kind of getting into change reconcile report to show all Uncategorized transactions we'd already kicked out to August. And then the budget amount on parent accounts we've kicked out to September. If there's no problems keeping those was there? Got some incoming ones? So let's say we had ad printed today and time to footer format. Matthias what's going on with that

Unknown Speaker  45:14
should be

Matthias Miller  45:17
printed. We said printed today time that is now an option. So I think whenever you guys want to coordinate with Josh, we could, whenever you guys want, we can start changing the putting that on all the all the reports. And I think that depends on where Josh said his stuff. So,

Speaker 2  45:34
and this you'd send a note and email with Josh, who talked about the other day and he said he said, there's some things he wants to discuss with you on that, because he was asking questions, and yeah, I didn't know. So. Okay. This is what you're saying is you you've built the framework. And if we like, it sounds like Drew could turn that on to show that but if he did, then it might also update some existing reports that Josh has created.

Matthias Miller  46:15
Yeah, it would affect everything it would, it would, it could affect a lot of things going out on the phone menu as well.

Speaker 2  46:22
Where do we set that? I mean, the cheapest quickest way would be to set it play with it. And if things go sideways, we just know that then

Unknown Speaker  46:35
I can

Matthias Miller  46:39
put it on the agenda to play around with

Unknown Speaker  46:43
pure again. Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker 3  46:50
Do we want to add new dates to it yet? Just keep it worked out.

Unknown Speaker  46:56
Yeah. Mark, what did you want on it?

Speaker 2  47:02
Well, I'd say just leave it on for the the agenda today. We have minutes

Speaker 3  47:09
Yep, that works. Okay, let's see we've got these premiums versus write offs. Is that the same as what we were talking about? Or is this a separate task that we're keeping

Unknown Speaker  47:24
that's related thing

Speaker 2  47:30
to you just recently sent an email on this

Unknown Speaker  47:41
so this this requires some Yeah, discussed some discussion so.

Speaker 3  47:55
Standardized customer deposits reports. So this is gonna pop back up. Yeah, I thought I might be done. Add some tags sorting issues. So the next few might be so payments on quotes as an email.

Speaker 3  48:20
prior discussion mark will talk to Josh about disallowing payments for clothes will continue to exclude no closer and accounting impact. Is this a task that needs to be dealt with at all?

Speaker 2  48:32
I would I would close this out and we'll make this part of our credits and Okay, refunds and discussion. I think

Matthias Miller  48:46
we've got to two discussions ones credits, or credits on vendor invoices and once credits and refunds and sales orders, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2  48:55
I got it. Thanks for clarifying. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3  49:00
credits and refunds discussion, but regardless, it's documented somewhere else I can close this. Yeah. Okay, great. Check placement adjustment needs work. So this was an email

Matthias Miller  49:19
this one is the signature adjustment I'm pretty sure the signature adjustment Okay, yeah, that's yeah, we got it you can close this one

Unknown Speaker  49:33
right

Speaker 5  49:38
and I'm just realizing I may actually need to balance just a few minutes before 1030 Is there

Speaker 3  49:46
the next thing and gold so let's just look at this one real quick. The include current year income and balance sheet. Oh, did you do something with this?

Unknown Speaker  49:59
Yeah. As of your jumps had a chance to look at the

Unknown Speaker  50:07
new Okay.

Unknown Speaker  50:09
Fair enough

Unknown Speaker  50:12
income at a you sent that update?

Speaker 1  50:15
Yeah, I assigned those accounts and it was yeah it was working we pretty sure didn't

Speaker 2  50:26
see any the balance sheets that had like had a footnote saying it didn't

Unknown Speaker  50:31
right

Speaker 2  50:36
so we can consider this done right. So yeah

Unknown Speaker  50:42
cool. It was easy

Unknown Speaker  50:43
okay appreciate

Matthias Miller  50:45
it. appreciate y'all

Unknown Speaker  50:47
I think it's

Unknown Speaker  50:49
all right thank you good seeing y'all good

Unknown Speaker  50:56
like this it's

Unknown Speaker  50:59
really disappeared deposits

Unknown Speaker  51:02
now yeah

Unknown Speaker  51:10
so

Unknown Speaker  51:13
we have a task to disallowed do I need to

Matthias Miller  51:19
let me know let me create a change request and bump it over to Jonathan disallowed deleting deposits Okay. Let's see other disallow deleting deposits

Unknown Speaker  51:34
with late payments

Unknown Speaker  51:42
you should not be able to delete.

Matthias Miller  52:35
Alright, eagles this went out you'll get a new you'll get we can create the change request once it comes in.

Speaker 3  52:43
Great. And then the last one was the ABC contra account is missing stuff. I was unsure whether or not this even belonged here but I put it here because it was a reminder to check in on it.

Matthias Miller  52:55
I'm not sure either drew this came up in conversation. I don't know if it's a thing or not. I think you've mentioned something but this looks kind of like a thing that we would have cleaned up as part of our somewhere in the course of the last number of months.

Unknown Speaker  53:09
Does that sound right?

Speaker 1  53:11
Yeah, I mean as far as I know. Well, what's your comments mark more on you have something that it was going to be today.

Unknown Speaker  53:25
Oh

Unknown Speaker  53:27
oh the Elian costs something Yeah,

Speaker 2  53:30
but what did this mean I know nothing about that contra account. Basic stuff.

Speaker 1  53:40
contra account kind of what is that? What's the raw materials to buildings?

Speaker 2  53:49
Do we have Don't we have any email or any more notes on it than this? was?

Speaker 3  53:53
It was that Matthias sent me as a reminder to talk about it so I don't have any background on it in here.

Matthias Miller  53:59
I took a note during a meeting at

Speaker 2  54:00
some point I'm not aware that there's anything remaining to be done

Unknown Speaker  54:14
so that's a sufficient check in I can close this out.

Unknown Speaker  54:16
Yeah. Okay, great.

Unknown Speaker  54:20
Okay

Speaker 3  54:24
well, I tagged the tasks that go on your agenda. I could send that to you Matthias if you'd like set the next part of our discussion. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  54:31
I think so. You gentlemen

Unknown Speaker  54:34
need me for anything else

Matthias Miller  54:42
I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  54:46
We can take a look probably

Speaker 3  54:48
adjust all of this until you until you guys are done talking and and then I can make one big revision to this list. If that works. All right, have a great meeting. See you later.

Unknown Speaker  55:01
Awesome. Thanks

Matthias Miller  55:07
All right, let me go ahead and pull

Unknown Speaker  55:09
that list up as well so

Matthias Miller  55:20
this one year

Unknown Speaker  55:33
9573

Matthias Miller  55:47
is actually vendor credit memos and I'm going to let's do a new one for you

Unknown Speaker  56:02
order credits and refunds

Matthias Miller  56:14
Alright, so I guess do we want to

Matthias Miller  56:25
where do we want to? I guess what do we want to start? Do we want to start just looking through these we want to prioritize these

Speaker 2  56:35
I think so maybe do a brief I mean kind of where we're at is we're still needing to complete vinyl structures first border so our thought was maybe prioritize these but the big one is the credits thing and I think before we can have any valuable discussion, we need to I started we need to have some bring some real life examples of those situations and my thought was could we do that? Possibly next week Drew and I do that and send it over to you ahead of our What is it may 16 Call because you're you're out next week? Right?

Matthias Miller  57:24
That is That is correct. I was gonna talk about that. Yeah.

Speaker 2  57:29
So I don't think that we need to spend on I don't think we really need to spend any more time on that now. Okay, so between now and say the 16th Do you have like do you do are you needing stuff to do? Or should you take that time and I don't know just wrap up loose ends get stuff off to Jonathan and kind of make sure that we're ready to buy the 16th to dive into Reddit

Matthias Miller  58:09
I will have a look

Speaker 1  58:17
this this vendor asymmetry thing I think

Matthias Miller  58:26
I might have some time to get stuff off to Jonathan I'm actually not going to have I've got another project the week of the 13th I'm I might have some flexibility might not

Unknown Speaker  58:38
you're just gonna have to

Speaker 2  58:42
do are you saying pretty much what you get done today and tomorrow is about all you'll you'll be able to get to on our stuff anyway. Until the week of the 16th

Matthias Miller  58:54
Okay, I might I might have some time on the eighth I mostly out on the ninth and 10th Potentially time on the eighth potentially time on the 15th depending how my project goes but yeah, between those two that's yeah. But I don't have just a ton of

Unknown Speaker  59:17
a ton of time. So

Speaker 2  59:22
why don't we just why don't we run through this list and look at a few things that I have on my list as far as prioritizing the credit is the top priority

Matthias Miller  59:41
what date should Okay, so we're gonna have it designed by the 16th. Do we want to are we aiming for the we use the first of June for other stuff good. Do we want to

Speaker 2  1:00:00
Well I think this is going to go longer than that because I think it requires collaboration with Josh as well I'm wondering if we shouldn't plan to

Unknown Speaker  1:00:09
bring him in possibly in the same meeting because it also affects we'll have to think it will affect how pieces will fake pieces that he's built as well like sales orders for customers and purchase off while not Yeah, purchase orders and vendor invoices as well.

Matthias Miller  1:00:38
I'm, well I'm not sure that we could. How long how long do your do your Wednesday calls go? Usually?

Speaker 2  1:00:50
We vote 745 645 to 745.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
Was six revives a little more doable than what I had been remembering

Matthias Miller  1:01:09
I would be open to this it's a little better for me to take a look at a at a seven o'clock but if you would want me to join one of your Wednesday meetings we can take a look at that.

Speaker 2  1:01:29
You're thinking like maybe the 15th we have it ready before then. I don't know would that work for you too? We do.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
Yeah, the first team

Speaker 2  1:01:47
that I just thought something that's our anniversary night. I need to keep that open because

Speaker 2  1:02:00
what about the six to 16? Like it's sad and if Josh could make that work, I don't know. Like you've planned for Yeah, 90 minutes like seven 830 Did I just reach out to Josh and see if he's available

Unknown Speaker  1:02:14
and yep. So

Unknown Speaker  1:02:18
I'll let you know

Matthias Miller  1:02:24
Alright, so this is I'm just going to do I'm going to set this out just to keep this on the radar

Speaker 4  1:02:37
mark and drew to do to get examples mark to schedule a call with Josh and I on six teams next milestone 16th. Setting the date

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
All right. So then that takes us to the 16th and then what would be the number two

Speaker 1  1:03:18
I think this year is would barely be the number two or unless the locking

Speaker 2  1:03:25
the locking is probably immoral. I mean this is yeah, probably probably.

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
I think there's actually a reasonable chance that you get that done by the 16th I'm gonna put it on 17th Because

Unknown Speaker  1:03:40
the order

Matthias Miller  1:03:44
number three, okay.

Speaker 2  1:03:45
Well that printed today we just want to look at that and guess that I guess we can kind of ignore or you want to be

Matthias Miller  1:03:54
I mean I can show you what it takes. Yeah, so there's a system okay, I've never admin admin admin systems, which is search for footer. There's a footer format, changing the printed date today in time and hit save.

Speaker 2  1:04:17
Well, let's just do it now and Drew can access this and unintuitive

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
Yes, I guess I can also do let me just do I can shoot you a quick email with this as well and this will help jog your memory DREW.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:59
Good

Matthias Miller  1:05:03
So we will, do you want me to close? Okay, is this one in Josh's?

Speaker 2  1:05:10
Well, you know if he wants to, and I will just close it out and if it if there's great problems and we'll bring it back, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
All right, number two fees and premiums versus write offs or final structures income statement

Speaker 2  1:05:36
what what notes do you have on that pole barn? thing? I think that needs some design, but it's also

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:05:49
so your market sales order first for pole barn

Speaker 2  1:05:53
and use a guest that using dealer instead, which is better.

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
So we would basically say we want an income statement by dealer. And it would find all sales orders for the dealers in all buildings built all transactions associated with the building that was built for that dealer or something like that.

Speaker 2  1:06:21
Now have the ability to link multiple purchase orders, vendor invoices, cities, again that needs a little bit of design. We have other use cases. don't notice this. I'm wondering if we shouldn't just cover this at the same time we caught the tried to cover this gap. Somebody's designed ready for this and covered at the same time we do. Because because this also gets into judge territory somewhat where we have purchase orders in IMS trying to link to specific standards.

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
No, do you actually need to tie it out to a specific you need to tie that to a specific standard? So you can apply that cost to the building?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:22
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:07:25
Right now we have two options when we buy, say, a non standard building when we buy a lumber package or a metal roof package. You know, most times it's like a job site delivery, it's all you know, the entire purchase order is for that building. So it's easy to say well, this, all of this is for the Matthias Miller job. But we the two options we have are one. Well really the only option we have is to just expense it immediately. And we're just expensing it in immediately in custom cogs. And most times the timing is correct, but we're not. We can't put it in inventory because IMS doesn't handle that. And I think there's I think what we need to do is is in my NB to the small note there's I think we need to create a new account. An account for jobs specific materials. It goes there when it's created and it comes out of there.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:40
When the building is invoice No, wow. Okay, when the building is built or invoice when it's invoice. It says oh, I've now been invoiced so well it gets a little What

Matthias Miller  1:09:01
do you do you want build on site to go into finished goods until it's invoiced? Like

Speaker 2  1:09:11
from from the time it's built to the time it's invoice

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
if the more we can

Speaker 2  1:09:18
make good I think we do I think we Yeah. But where were you going with that?

Matthias Miller  1:09:25
The more that we can if we can. This is kind of the holy grail that we're after he gets good the more we can make it work like other buildings, but still give us what we need. The happier we're going to be long term

Matthias Miller  1:09:43
it's somewhat akin to it's not a labor intensive building but it's it is a here is the but it is a I'm overriding the material cost on this and I'm doing that by linking it to these purchase orders and vendor invoices. And so however you want to account for that, I don't know if it really matters that much. It can it can it still run through the same inventory accounts. But but then when you go out to apply actual costs, this will be excluded from your inventory usage. And in you'll already have overridden the actual cost for this building.

Speaker 2  1:10:33
Yeah, see, there's a manual element there that when we say how much does this custom Matthias Miller building costs, it's what we typically will have is, say two invoices that are specific for for that project, like a lumber package, because we're buying nonstock to buy eight rafters, or we're buying. And we're buying longer pieces of metal, so we buy those two invoices. But then we also take pieces out of inventory, like our flooring and our smart side siding. Windows might be so so each one will need some manual elements or what I'm thinking we'd say we have a way to link the invoices to purchases that are specific to that, but then we should have a report where a builder looks at and says, Okay, this Matthias Miller building, we've gotten the metal. And the, here are the invoices that we purchased specifically for this. Now, I need to estimate how much dollar worth of raw material inventory I use, much like we do for the miscellaneous sales orders where we're estimating raw materials. And then we enter that on the building. But it's it's not a, it's entered as an actual cost, and not as a standard costing. And sometimes, depending on how unique the building is 90% of it will be those specific invoices and other times only 10%, you know, and the remaining 90 coming out of inventory. So but but we'll need to take, what that would do is it takes that element of it doesn't, it has no effect. Depending on how accurate you are on your estimate the raw materials use, it has no effect on the standard buildings. And it should also make so that your timing is when they call those cogs hit at the exact same time that the revenue does. I think we'll just have to put some examples together and have, you know, a working design ready for that? I mean, what what's your thought? Are we trying to do too much to do both of those? In that that meeting? The six? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:09
we are.

Matthias Miller  1:13:14
I hate to be the bearer of bad news. But I think this is a priority question. I think we need to pick one or the other. This This looks on the surface to be Oh, it's not that bad. It might not be that bad when you get around to implementing it. But I think getting a design where it isn't that bad. I think that's I think there's actually a good bit of

Unknown Speaker  1:13:40
wrangling with it to get to something we're really happy with. But it could be wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
Well, so I think what we should do is is

Unknown Speaker  1:13:48
this, this does not trump

Speaker 2  1:13:49
the priority of the credit. And I think in the meantime, there's nothing that prevents us from just internally starting this process where those those invoices, just our expense whatever they happen through costume talks, and that's, that's okay. But then we start the process of saying, Mr. Builder on this building, how much raw materials should we use? And can you tell us or show us again and just like how would How would probably somebody Berman how would they apply? We see this building. We estimate $5,000 worth of raw material costs, how do they apply that as an actual cause so that it remains fixed?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
To make your screen

Speaker 2  1:15:03
if you go back to what you were they just entered there and select Freeze does that?

Matthias Miller  1:15:11
If they would, if they would do sure if they would do this. Oh, and freeze it. And then the accounting basis would be pretty standard cost as actual costs. I'm not sure if I mean, I'm going to assume technically, they should probably do this and then it doesn't matter what I would get something like this would be the right way.

Speaker 2  1:15:39
So how would we guess that like? This just you want it and and follow through the system and see if it works.

Matthias Miller  1:15:51
You could I think you can also

Speaker 4  1:15:58
trying to remember there's surely there's a good way to see what's excluded date range, not building cancelled. Weighted cost dollars?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:08
If

Matthias Miller  1:16:13
you Yeah, I mean?

Speaker 2  1:16:23
Well, just freezing the numbers will that? Will that freeze whatever we have either. What happens when you when you just select freezing those numbers, and there's nothing an actual loss? Would it just freeze to standard costs?

Matthias Miller  1:16:40
Well, you wouldn't be able to

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
I'm not sure what we do we have any kind of

Speaker 2  1:16:52
oh, what would be helpful to have from you, Matthias is, is how to use that on a building by building basis, and we could start that with one company and and it would it I think that would teach us a lot before we go to build software to to handle it.

Matthias Miller  1:17:15
Yeah, I think you're right.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
i

Speaker 2  1:17:26
Well, how's it being handled on miscellaneous sales? Well, that okay, there we're talking sales orders and not skins. But we wanted to work like, like, I believe the miscellaneous sales orders.

Matthias Miller  1:17:41
Well, there, you're there, you've got a special report. Okay, this way, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54
yeah, that is what we're doing.

Matthias Miller  1:17:57
Okay, here's what you should do. I mean, you should just, you should just mimic this completely, but just apply it to raw materials. Check the box, change the standard cost to change the standard cost to what it should be check the box, set the date, to presumably the build date. Set the actual cost to the standard cost, you will you will have zero variance and use actual cost accounting basis. And if you just if you just straight up replicate this, you'll be good. So

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
why do we have to change the standard cost?

Matthias Miller  1:18:41
Because we're freezing the standard cost as the actual cost. And when we're calculating the distribution we're looking at. I mean, it's just an assumption that standard. The freeze is to free senior cost, it has actual cost.

Speaker 2  1:18:57
And so we have to enter actual costs. But to keep it simple, just edit the state change the standard cost freeze, then enter the actual cost and set the accounting bases to actual boss.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:14
Yes.

Speaker 2  1:19:17
Well, that that's Yeah, I think just starting to use that the one thing will happen with that is on a building where we only use 10% of the materials from inventory we'll have you know it'll look really really cheap. Sitting in finished goods inventory for a little bit but the other parts about at the same time should be Yeah, I think that's

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
good. I'm glad you said know how to do trying to do both at the same meeting.

Speaker 2  1:19:52
I think this is the better approach anyway because we get to test like without a manual process to support it into it. Fall on its face anyway

Speaker 2  1:20:13
I think software development a big part of it is being a good teacher steps 1234

Matthias Miller  1:20:21
The there is a lot of that that's yeah, you're right. Being able to break things down into steps, and there's also pattern recognition This is that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:32
good. Well, I think we've, we've got a patent on

Matthias Miller  1:20:35
this. Okay. So, and then fees and fees, premiums and write offs. We'll just I mean, do we set that for the end of May we want to get to it but I would say Yeah, the other stuff is more important. And in this one we're saying alright, so in the status on this one is Mark will start using manual process

Speaker 4  1:21:10
to handle items from inventory

Unknown Speaker  1:21:19
however

Matthias Miller  1:21:28
and gold date on this is June.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
Yeah. realistic, but I'd say June, mid June. Because I think you're right, it's, it's gonna turn into a bigger project than we think.

Matthias Miller  1:21:50
All right. So that's priority, that's credits and refunds, creating vendor invoices when doing reconciles. Go ahead, do that.

Speaker 1  1:22:05
Oh, that's this one. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So we have that quick transaction entry tool, which works great when we're a long ways behind, but when we get to what once we're close to current with our reconciles and stuff, then there will still be some lagging receipts and invoices, whatnot all coming in to AP and we thought if instead of only creating the transactions, we would create the vendor invoices. as much information as we have and then then it would be much more like a regular process to just simply go in and change a few things with the additional information they received and then move on rather than having them go over and start editing transactions and we'd have you know all that so I don't know if we can take a very similar idea to the quick transactions it would just we'd have to add a few more few more information fields

Unknown Speaker  1:23:12
like

Speaker 1  1:23:20
the you know, we'd have to instead of only having the payment account, well the payment account is standard and then and then all we're doing is entering into the into the asset or expense account numbers, but we'd have to set we'd have to be able to give everything that is there and probably not have an account on the backside unless it's accounts payable, but then we'd say okay, and we this thing was paid we'd have to have an account that it's paid with

Speaker 1  1:24:02
and then just automatically get entered as paid status

Unknown Speaker  1:24:14
it would throw in the payment information

Matthias Miller  1:24:24
Alright, so we'd have

Speaker 1  1:24:26
Yeah, so the the day all that would be correct there. The account name would be The would be the account and gets expense to should be correct. And the amount

Speaker 1  1:24:49
um, vendor invoice I'm probably genuinely not going to have the vendor invoice number. Because, you know, all I have is an amount of Um Yeah, I would go in as a non Pio GL account

Speaker 1  1:25:15
I'm trying to figure out if we need debit and credit we

Matthias Miller  1:25:20
don't have we don't have that here just be an amount

Speaker 1  1:25:24
right it would just be amount which would be a debit

Matthias Miller  1:25:37
Well, I mean just

Speaker 1  1:25:39
the total it would go in the total field and it would go in the Payment Amount field and the the non purchase order amount field it would just you'd have to hit all of those

Matthias Miller  1:25:52
guys right

Speaker 1  1:25:59
is there gonna be same from from the bank reconcile perspective right. And then I would say it can just use one date as well which would just hit all of them which is the invoice date and the payment date because for all I know there's no difference now they might get an invoice later you know, and then want to change that payment date possibly your

Matthias Miller  1:26:42
vendor and so the prompt then would be

Matthias Miller  1:26:51
looking at

Speaker 4  1:27:11
and then the payment

Matthias Miller  1:27:16
built to location, the payment type do you want payment ID on

Speaker 1  1:27:26
um, yeah, we want a payment ID on there. So that I can put in you know, if it was a check it was a missing check or something. I'll just put that in and then they just get entered as paid I think because I don't think like if they get entered as pre paid on verified

Speaker 1  1:28:00
I mean, I guess they could go in as prepaid unverified because you know, later if they would later receive it, that's what they would have done. You know, even if it's to wait two weeks after the fact they would have put it in as prepaid unverified so but now I would want to create a note just that would just stamp the user in and just say something about incomplete information or something so that they know that it's okay to change you know the the expense accounts or whatever

Matthias Miller  1:28:56
Yeah, what's a good way to

Speaker 1  1:29:00
you could just say yeah, it was created per the bank statement or something

Speaker 1  1:29:24
something about you know, because they might sometimes be attaching POS you know, they'll get into Oh, this is the one for po that's nice. So, just something that about the

Matthias Miller  1:29:39
well we just say

Matthias Miller  1:29:53
yeah, maybe something like that.

Speaker 1  1:29:55
Created from limited information on the bank account for some Anything like that from the bank account would be better. And basically an indicator not to change the payment type or the or the payment amount because that's what we know is right

Matthias Miller  1:30:31
is there a way to

Unknown Speaker  1:30:39
Yeah, we put this as a

Unknown Speaker  1:30:59
we'll make it a setting so that you guys can control that.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:11
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:19
Good. What's What's your priority on this one? Well,

Speaker 1  1:31:34
if you get to something, you have space to do something before we have the credit memo thing ready? I would say go ahead and work on it. But once we have credit memos ready, then we should that design ready, we should probably do that first. So

Matthias Miller  1:31:51
I wonder if this this one might actually

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
be something we can hand off to Jonathan.

Speaker 1  1:31:57
I mean, I'll start using it as soon as possible. So. Okay.

Speaker 2  1:32:12
All right. Um, I'm wondering if we should advise if United just connect this afternoon on some of those questions on applying actual cost wise and buildings with us being passed while we have another meeting at 1230 here that need to prepare for? Would that work for you?

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
Yeah. Could we do something around two or a few minutes after? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
Why don't you do 15? Yeah. Should we? Should I just call you directly?

Speaker 4  1:32:52
That's fine. Yeah. Okay, so that's perfect.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:56
Is there anything else that I kind of jumped in?

Speaker 1  1:32:59
Yeah, no, that's fine. I do have one other thing. We talked about getting other user accounts set up for my coworkers. Like a long time ago we did Yep. Is there a way that we can use our Outlook email addresses to log in instead of a Gmail because we all have like, you know, minds drew at our services and and we only have like one or So Gmail accounts that are connected to the company that people can use and so it's

Matthias Miller  1:33:36
this is you can create so

Unknown Speaker  1:33:44
actually, so it wasn't really

Unknown Speaker  1:33:48
the app hosting zone thing it would be

Matthias Miller  1:33:52
well,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:55
I'm trying to remember something here

Unknown Speaker  1:34:07
what is this secondary.

Matthias Miller  1:34:28
I think there might be a way to do this actually, where they could log in with. Okay, so this is secondary.

Speaker 4  1:34:37
Login or auth? I'm not sure which is B. Ope. Student Help in the wiki

Unknown Speaker  1:35:12
do this search

Unknown Speaker  1:35:34
New Hire

Unknown Speaker  1:35:59
that's really username

Matthias Miller  1:36:05
maybe it needs to be

Unknown Speaker  1:36:09
thought this was the

Matthias Miller  1:36:23
Okay, well there's two ways you can do it way number one, just create Google accounts but using your Outlook account and there's a I can send you this link

Matthias Miller  1:36:50
the other option I

Speaker 1  1:36:51
have them using it a lot more so I am kind of urgent to get this done

Matthias Miller  1:36:58
before all the blame for their work comes on you

Speaker 1  1:37:05
Yeah, well I can look at something like man did I do this? Or did they do this? You know, but okay,

Matthias Miller  1:37:12
there is a way to

Speaker 1  1:37:18
and then or something and say okay, create a user for this person who was this login address or I

Matthias Miller  1:37:25
wouldn't work with I would work with Dwayne on user

Unknown Speaker  1:37:29
access I think

Matthias Miller  1:37:33
now there is there would be one other way I think there might be a way that we can set up a

Matthias Miller  1:37:45
right now loads Yeah that's

Speaker 4  1:37:50
awesome override it's like a big long script

Matthias Miller  1:37:57
this is this is the all the behind the scenes stuff that you did not even want to know existed Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:03
hello system switch

Matthias Miller  1:38:05
to allow writing down thinking

Unknown Speaker  1:38:06
Ah

Matthias Miller  1:38:11
I think there is a

Unknown Speaker  1:38:18
medication second

Unknown Speaker  1:38:27
is secondary

Unknown Speaker  1:38:45
it's

Matthias Miller  1:38:48
I think there is there might also be a way that we can we can let them give them a link where they can log in with a username and password

Speaker 4  1:38:59
not get current right login page. Which is secondary. Why are you not secondary

Unknown Speaker  1:39:16
predication?

Matthias Miller  1:39:19
Yeah. So I guess, I guess it's up to you. I think both are well.

Speaker 1  1:39:29
We'll shoot this one once and see how it works and go from there. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:39:35
sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:38
Yep, thanks.
