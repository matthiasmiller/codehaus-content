Speaker 1  00:42
I'm gonna talk to you forever and I get to talk to you twice in one day. How about that?

Matthias Miller  00:45
Oh, it's a beautiful thing

Speaker 1  01:02
somebody sent me a document. And I opened it up. And it's in. Rather than bold black headers. It's in bold purple headers and in pink text. I literally send them a message back that says, holy cow, I can't get the pink and purple. I just melted it. What on earth take in purple?

Matthias Miller  01:35
I'm going to start doing that. No. Just for Dwayne. That's it.

Unknown Speaker  01:43
Oh, man, that was that's painful.

Matthias Miller  01:46
That's funny. I'm going to use a little image generator in signal now going forward. I'm just gonna send you pictures

Unknown Speaker  02:02
right.

Unknown Speaker  02:11
Doing

Speaker 2  02:17
so I'm going to work on updating the other two off of our conversation and send those out again, but I think the biggest Yeah, get more information on landmark so that we can win. There's really nothing you could do on that. Recording payments, right? From what you're still waiting on relevant information for me to proceed with that.

Matthias Miller  02:51
Well, I mean, I think so. I mean, I think waiting for information for you is probably the most efficient way to go about it.

Speaker 2  02:59
But there's there won't be a lot for you to do on that. Other than handling the fees. modeling how we handle the fees once we know how that's being done in real life. Right. That's kind of the main thing.

Matthias Miller  03:11
Yeah, that is the main thing. It's, it seems pretty minimal to me.

Speaker 2  03:18
Yeah. Good. Well, let's go through this billing. I think this is pretty straightforward. The end goal here is just to maintain a reliable billing process that generates error free invoices for all products and services for which we expect to be paid correctly reflect those Billings. Billings I'm seeing feelings instead of invoicing because that's the term used in accounting tools and so I take them to be professional so the great revenue and AR and accurate sales tax that customers will require so some of this we've talked about already the first well okay, the biggest thing that excites me about this most is once we initiate this will finally start to report revenue correctly. Cancellation so the first one required sales or rain was telephone assistance prevailing post billing those. When you talk to Josh this morning in our meeting, he said he thinks most of the work on his side is your prep work is done. Like on the sales order, sales order, showing sales order or invoice changing the numbers, the estimated tax and the sales tax and all of that so anything to add to that Matthias or what what needs to what needs to happen on that Yeah to take that all those changes live on the

Matthias Miller  05:08
you know, says Dwayne's office needs to start you guys need to start actually doing the daily invoicing process

Unknown Speaker  05:20
okay that's the step that they just take them back

Matthias Miller  05:24
or remind that's down there Josh had said something about maybe there's something sort of that I need to let him know when it goes live but or when I'm ready for it to go live but I don't remember the kind of thing that might be one one switch that Josh wants to flip perhaps when when this actually goes live but it could be wrong

Unknown Speaker  05:56
okay, so on this you're waiting till number four happens to take these changes live

Matthias Miller  06:06
we take a look I'm not sure

Speaker 2  06:17
find some I did see on invoices that it's st estimated tax now so it appears

Speaker 2  06:32
but wow the ones I saw were still saying invoice and not sales order but

Matthias Miller  06:48
were there any sales orders that came through this morning? Maybe it would have been fruit yesterday try this area let me try one of these. Okay, so this is so we said in one invoices and if we don't have anything meeting invoicing at this point if we go back and share your screen or is it something that oh yeah I'm sorry yes

Unknown Speaker  07:30
is it on our side but it's not

Matthias Miller  07:32
Oh, there we go. He's got the wrong notes. Okay, so yeah, there's a switch that Josh needs to flip I think to start using the our prefix from what I can tell and I think we were waiting until number four happens to start doing that

Speaker 2  07:54
good to is great a standard template for all miscellaneous sales orders initially created outside of CES that's just well, two and 302 is pretty straightforward is create a standardized template that has all the correct information in an attempt to get Wayne's office all the correct information for entering that and then three is implement a process for entering in assist all of these miscellaneous sales orders initially created outside of CES A should be that's a typo that shouldn't be there. But step one would be sent sales orders to go and we'll have to talk about what do you want there maybe you know that already like were these miscellaneous sales orders? We just sent those to orders at Berman dot biz

Speaker 1  08:58
What are is that permanent up is? Is that where we Is that where you send the Pardon my ignorance but is that where you'd normally send the like? Amish sales like like Robert Yoder

Speaker 2  09:16
you were supposed to know because I had to all I can find out but you want to send to the same place.

Speaker 1  09:23
Yeah, I would think so. Okay, good. Send them to Matthias at Code house.

Unknown Speaker  09:33
Okay

Speaker 2  09:39
and then your office we'll just we'll enter that information just like a robbery Yoders shit sales. Sent the sales order back to the builder a builder would verify that it's correct and correct. Proceed to the next step. If not,

Speaker 1  09:56
I would, I would think it would follow the exact same process. Like, the shit would that, you know when that Nick Childers enters it would seem like it should follow the exact same process.

Speaker 2  10:08
I'll plan on that but once we're ready to implement that I'll talk with you man for sure.

Unknown Speaker  10:13
You're

Unknown Speaker  10:14
gonna put your name

Unknown Speaker  10:17
well oh

Speaker 2  10:22
and two and three I've since entered dates of October 18

Unknown Speaker  10:30
And then four

Speaker 2  10:34
Wow, this is kind of a okay, I put my name there to implement that with the districts to like, actually start using it but it's also Matthias there's things that you're going to have to do well, okay, let's let's just talk through this so at once we go live with his process billing will automatically create the following transactions Am I correct and the class that that framework is already built for those transactions?

Matthias Miller  11:11
Yes, we haven't really had a chance to test it and we've been running into some of this you know, like the stripe payout issues. But

Unknown Speaker  11:26
yeah.

Speaker 2  11:29
So be thinking through how to transition from current process of moving buildings. So currently, that's happening automatic but I think we'll have to coordinate with Josh to make sure that we don't like how we stopped doing that and start doing like we switched to the new process.

Matthias Miller  11:49
So it's no wonder based on delivery, but it's based on invoicing? Yes. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  11:58
Are you familiar enough with that process that

Matthias Miller  12:04
I would think it would be best to put in Josh's courts court but

Speaker 2  12:12
oh you mean the the entire like for the billing like so that all of these steps happen when when Dwayne's off as Mark marks these as as ready to invoice

Matthias Miller  12:46
if it's built not canceled it's based on in this case it's based on final delivery date

Speaker 2  12:56
there there are still some some gaps in in some of his logic like if you were to last I think last week or the week prior there were some for North Carolina there were some I think was last week some pole barns on this report like a $237,000 sale that it appeared on this report correctly but I think it was because of

Unknown Speaker  13:35
a number of

Matthias Miller  13:42
this one here

Unknown Speaker  13:54
was this one bill

Matthias Miller  13:57
let's see it was the built on the

Unknown Speaker  14:00
more reason

Matthias Miller  14:07
let's do where's the built on here we go

Matthias Miller  14:16
well,

Speaker 2  14:18
these would have been out of these would have moved to accounts receivable because there's that still automatically have

Matthias Miller  14:28
so if I go as of last week, but it

Unknown Speaker  14:34
could be one

Speaker 2  14:40
or maybe it was the week before 230 I think it would have just okay it was Mark built and delivered the same day which is

Matthias Miller  15:13
Building build or district building will be building by an all delivery equals building build is.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
This guy, yeah, that 234.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
So, okay, this one appeared

Unknown Speaker  15:44
there's no transit task attached to this one right.

Matthias Miller  15:50
To build on site transit task.

Speaker 2  15:54
Okay, so there was a transit test. So I mean, what happened is they send in their builder power report that same day that they also manually entered a delivery date. Yeah. 10 for Nick Childers, updated delivery date per Shannon. So what would have happened had an E children's not which, typically, which is more typical to happen, where the builder does not communicate that until maybe two days later, had he not updated that until 10? Six, one, would that have appear? On that list on 10? Six.

Matthias Miller  16:30
So it would have been on that list, it would have been on the FTA lists from 10, four to 10. Six,

Speaker 2  16:35
and it would not have appeared on the sales orders needing invoicing until 10. Six because there was a transit tab. Correct?

Matthias Miller  16:44
Because it needed delivery.

Speaker 2  16:47
But Dwayne, am I correct that a lot of these build on sites would not have a transit test, and would therefore show up, potentially show up before the delivery date has been entered.

Speaker 1  17:01
Most of the times, I mean, if they're the dealer's checking them out correctly, we would have a transit test. But the check off of the transit task actually, like in the case of Ohio actually happens at a later timeframe. They'll let us know now. Well, most of the time, they don't ever check them off because they are considering it when they mark it built to actually be the date of delivery.

Matthias Miller  17:25
So when we did this, do buildings.

Speaker 2  17:36
We have pretty much all of those have a transit test still do have a transit test even for Ohio.

Speaker 1  17:43
You usually do but they oftentimes it's pretty delayed on ever marking them off, which puts them outside of automation window. And so it really ought to be that delivery date should be marked at for a build on site building a delivery date should be marked at the date as the date of built

Speaker 2  18:05
or which we I mean, we have a manual process that's supposed to surety.

Matthias Miller  18:31
We could

Matthias Miller  18:37
well, we can ignore build on site trend to test for the purpose of the proposed invoicing date or we can just say you need to fix your process.

Speaker 2  18:47
But Dwayne, do you know are the bill on site Billings? Are they consistently enough? marked as build on site?

Speaker 1  18:55
Yeah, there's there's enough consistency because they actually are supposed to select Build on site. So there's a built on site icon shows up the builder diagram. And it's pretty consistent.

Unknown Speaker  19:06
So you're thinking that would be a better mean, it would be? That would be a good way to handle this right.

Speaker 2  19:13
Matthias is saying if I have a building that contains a build on site, line item, then make it show up. I then I think it needs to be invoiced. The moment is built. It's Mark built and disregarded the delivery. I think that would be correct.

Speaker 1  19:44
Wait, say that last part. Again? You're saying you said somebody disregarding something I didn't I didn't track okay.

Speaker 2  19:49
So assist says if I whenever I have a building with a built on site, build on site is like a lane item right just like an item. Yep. If I have a sales order with a skin that also can with a standard that contains a build on, well, if I have a sales order that contains a build on site if I have a sales order that has a skin and it also has an item of build on site, then ignore the delivery date. And just assume that once I see that it's built, I'll throw it on the list that that's ready for invoicing.

Speaker 1  20:35
So is is the trigger point for invoicing currently the delivery date is that what is that what I'm understanding

Unknown Speaker  20:40
is yes I mean that's fine

Matthias Miller  20:44
Oh effectively we're doing is well has a transit tasks task

Unknown Speaker  21:00
as

Matthias Miller  21:13
was just do this we have nine

Unknown Speaker  21:17
well no

Matthias Miller  21:24
let's do this

Matthias Miller  21:37
so I would like to take time to do this now getting us derailed but basically

Unknown Speaker  22:01
in

Matthias Miller  22:11
well it's really this if it's

Matthias Miller  22:21
alright, so it has any if it has any transits transit tasks without transit tasks if it's no if it's without transit tasks

Matthias Miller  22:50
or it's built on site

Matthias Miller  23:04
something like that

Speaker 2  23:09
yeah, buildings without transit task or with build on site it invoice day after Bill Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  23:17
So let's do this. And let's see if we can

Speaker 3  23:25
Yeah, no more we really, really want to we don't really go many downgrade.

Matthias Miller  23:35
What don't you like about me?

Matthias Miller  23:45
How about we do Salesforce?

Matthias Miller  23:53
Open walled brain, see, and we can see this pull up anything that we would have?

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:12
Okay, here's one that we said was, it hasn't built on site. It was built on the 11th. But the transit task is not yet completed, it has not been delivered. So this one would have shown up needing invoicing as of the 12th or Wesleyan Marshall. And then most of these, were just saying, well, we should have invoiced them a day earlier. prior to delivery. Here's this one. Other build on site, same story, or same thing build on site, same story, and this one would have been built on delivered on the 10th built on the 10th so we're saying the delivery in this case we're saying it was built yesterday we're going to invoice day we're invoicing it on day of delivery day after build so that's why these are all a day later I mean, looks right to me agree. So okay,

Speaker 2  25:35
okay, we had one well the ones that send out Tuesday for sure that we had a bunch of old stuff showing up like really old stuff showing up at the top I don't know they didn't have to do with so if you I'm looking at a copy of the Ohio the Ohio one from those sent Tuesday Yeah, Tuesday morning. And I have buildings that were built 2018 2021 22 at the top just I'd like to troubleshoot and see why why those are showing up

Matthias Miller  26:13
we which day was this

Unknown Speaker  26:16
the report found out Tuesday morning at six I think

Unknown Speaker  26:24
yesterday Okay

Matthias Miller  26:28
and this was or Ohio

Matthias Miller  26:43
919 12

Speaker 2  26:54
Was it some change that was made that duck these up or what? Like

Matthias Miller  27:01
these are from these were from way back You're right okay let's go with the oldest 191 Here Okay, so nine one invoice date

Matthias Miller  27:21
added a payment added a payment

Unknown Speaker  27:38
this would have been

Matthias Miller  27:45
site prep we had delivery

Unknown Speaker  27:49
delivery was

Matthias Miller  27:54
mean this one let's see when the building was built. Building was built on the 25th it wasn't delivered until attend

Unknown Speaker  28:04
now that one looks legit but I have one here actually the

Speaker 2  28:14
wow, I guess this is much help with the invoice IDs were white. I mean, do you have a way of seeing the transactions that would have gone out Tuesday morning?

Matthias Miller  28:25
No, do you have the invoice ID or not?

Unknown Speaker  28:28
No

Speaker 2  28:34
well I'm going to assume that it was just cleaning out some old stuff from some change over the weekend because this would have Wow Yeah, we don't have the original anymore if I might have one from

Matthias Miller  29:09
this one where do these emails get?

Speaker 2  29:17
Okay, I have some here that we could could troubleshoot. So I have an n i n this is a shift right i n 24852522.

Unknown Speaker  29:35
And this one

Unknown Speaker  29:38
has a delivery date of nine eight but it didn't show up until today so what would have paused

Matthias Miller  29:51
so

Matthias Miller  29:58
but doesn't have transit tasks. It's not district x. So it would have been based on final delivery date. I mean, Vanessa came in and entered a delivery date for Stephen

Unknown Speaker  30:18
and five enter delivery date of nine, eight.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Okay

Matthias Miller  30:29
it's built on. Wait. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  30:33
So my guess is this was one that fell through the cracks and we didn't we had I think this was we were cleaning up some. Yeah, we were trying to

Speaker 2  30:50
clean up some old buildings. Try and get them moved to the finished goods inventory. I think that's what happened here. So let's take a look at one more. It's bi N

Speaker 2  31:06
two, it's two four. I n 24856722. This is probably the same deal, but I'm not. Okay, that's doing exactly what it's supposed to. Good. So. So, Matthias, are you saying number four? coordinate all of that with with Josh, like how that ties into his existing processes?

Unknown Speaker  31:43
Well, we can

Matthias Miller  31:44
we can take that live. And then I think once Dwayne's office is actively doing the the marking these as invoice we can go to Josh I think that the next step then is telling Josh to start using the prefixes

Speaker 2  32:01
Okay, when you say you can turn this or go live with this you're saying that would then overwrite some of the automated processes, moving buildings from finished goods inventory to AR and

Matthias Miller  32:21
Well, moving to moving. Okay, this would this would move Yes, on the accounting side, then that would tie into into there currently. Currently, what we're doing is whenever whenever assist every morning, we say what are the sales orders that need invoicing, we're sending off that email and then we're just rubber stamping it and saying we're going to invoice as of that date. So what we need to do is have a stop rubber stamping it and let these accumulate and have you start sending these into Dwayne's office Once that process is rolling, then we can go back to Josh and say Josh we are now ready to have to start using the our prefix that we talked about up here and he can flip whatever switches he needs to have that start happening.

Speaker 2  33:07
Okay one just to clarify you said Assist is rubber stamping currently if I had thought it's still following the old process like the Josh would have it's not rubber stamping based on this list, but it's moving buildings based on oh, what would be

Unknown Speaker  33:29
time to move for the

Matthias Miller  33:34
FDA reports is moving buildings based on on the on the delivery date, but for accounting impact, I believe it's using invoice date.

Speaker 2  33:44
Okay. But like on the finished goods inventory report, we want to also when we go live with this process, the Stop stop using the delivery date and not moving it out of his inventory until we invoice it. So that that matches with what accounting shows. Right? So is that is that something that needs coordination with Gosh or or no

Matthias Miller  34:18
I think so, um, I think probably

Unknown Speaker  34:23
want the two to happen at the same time.

Matthias Miller  34:49
Well, I mean what does it need to happen at the same?

Speaker 2  34:55
Well, I guess it could happen slightly different times. Now, but in the future will want to have what I am s thinks is in finished goods inventory be in sync with accounting, right? Short term, it wouldn't have to happen at the same time you're right.

Speaker 2  35:19
So your suggestion would be let's go live with on the accounting side. And then immediately after that work with Josh to go live with moving them off of finished goods inventory.

Matthias Miller  35:36
If my accounting side, you mean, let's go have Dwayne's office start, let's, let's start this process with Dwayne's office? Yes. If that's what you mean, then yes, let's do that. And then have, yes, have Josh, immediately take a look at, then we know we're generating correct sales order, invoice dates, and switch, Josh will switch that over to look at sales order invoice dates. And then we'll probably want to do a, we might want to pull an FTA report before and after Josh makes that switch. Just to make sure buildings don't accidentally pop on or pop off. Okay.

Speaker 2  36:21
Good. So I think what we'll need to do is we'll need to double check these reports for at least through the rest of the week. And also get districts builders ready to start using this. And then at that point. Like how much like when once Dwayne and I believe we're ready to start actually doing this process, how much? What do you need to do to switch that over?

Matthias Miller  36:55
I just need to turn off. I can show Dwayne what needs to happen. I don't know if Dwayne wants to know what he's about to find out anyway.

Unknown Speaker  37:08
You can ask me later, doesn't plan on doing any of it?

Matthias Miller  37:12
At all? Let's see. This is the invoice Oh, no, we're gonna have to switch over how these get emailed out, won't we?

Speaker 2  37:29
Oh, you're saying start sending them directly to each other?

Matthias Miller  37:36
Yeah, to the builders?

Speaker 2  37:37
Well, we can start that. I mean, we can do that. Is there anything keeping us from what keeps us from just switching that over? Right away? Even before we while we're just rubber stamping?

Matthias Miller  38:00
Doing I created an email template to send these out, is there a documents scheduled document that I can create to automatically send these out the right way to do it

Unknown Speaker  38:22
without mandatory? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:25
So

Speaker 1  38:28
where are you? Are you saying sending out by email or just send it out by the phone system?

Matthias Miller  38:33
Well, I would prefer the phone system. So it's all in the same place. Sure. But

Speaker 1  38:40
this know that Scheduled Documents is the right?

Matthias Miller  38:45
It's not the right thing.

Speaker 1  38:46
I don't know. So wait, is it what? What are you sending to him? It's a database. Yeah, okay. I don't know I expect we probably ought to create a parent tab of accounting because it's probably going to start or maybe we already have an accounting parent tab. I'm not sure. We don't we probably should.

Matthias Miller  39:11
Do you want to take the time to set this up now or do you?

Unknown Speaker  39:22
Be asking me or Dwayne

Matthias Miller  39:26
primarily Dwayne am doing I think this is kind of I think using these reports is the right thing to do. I haven't set these up I'm happy to do it. Now if it's simple and easy were few and I need to get our heads together later and get it done then that's fine

Speaker 1  39:49
I don't care. miles miles, miles miles polish it off. And here I'll make you a new apparent tab. If I can remember how to

Matthias Miller  40:05
can I? Can I actually just basically copy this?

Speaker 1  40:15
I don't think you want to send it to all those people. Well, not all those people just save it. And once once you have once you have the Ask prompts assigned, you got the report? Yeah, save it. I'll take care of the rest. Just send me a URL to

Speaker 2  40:30
Okay. Right, I can think of a list of who I want, or a list of what does anywhere wire then.

Matthias Miller  40:41
Still on the, on the go live, Dwayne. Mark's gonna get duplicates. If he's on the other list, which was fine but and then in the, in the meantime, this is the scheduled task that needs to be disabled once your office takes over but if you

Matthias Miller  41:06
but again, if you need help just holler. This is the thing that rubber stamps them all is invoiced, whatever we think should be

Speaker 1  41:18
more specific about what we need help for. Because if you start saying that, I gotta ask you for all kinds of things.

Matthias Miller  41:24
Okay, let's narrow the scope down to the automatic rubber stamping of sales orders getting invoicing, goodness, psychiatry, and therapy and comedy are excluded from this offer.

Unknown Speaker  41:45
So

Speaker 2  41:46
good, I think, on that, I think we have everything we need to get everything we need there. I said, Wow, disregard number five on the one I sent earlier, but I sent a later one that says basically says replace five with this create sales boarder aging report. So can we also create a sales order aging report? That's yeah, look at your most recent email would have the details there, because we already covered that five as far as well. We talked about

Unknown Speaker  42:27
the bill to premier reality.

Speaker 2  42:31
Yeah, there's so there was concern from builders that looking at this sales orders needing invoicing that, no, that's more than their memory than they can really remember. So they're just kind of some of these unless it's real obvious, just blindly marking off these ready for invoicing. But I, it is the right thing to do. If we happen to mark one. If we happen to invoice one that we shouldn't have, it'll sit in accounts receivable and just stay there until somebody figures it out that it should not have been invoiced the other side. The other side of that is something that a sales order that we somehow fell through the cracks and we never invoice for and should have. So if we have a sales order aging reports that we can look at every so often that says, well, here are all your open sales orders that have not been invoiced, and have an aging report. And you can see that these are, you know, here's the sales order that was created 270 days ago, then you better check it out and see, why was it not? Why is it is it legit? And if so, why has it not been invoiced? So I feel like we're with with that and accounts receivable catching both sides of the catching mistakes on both sides of this billing.

Matthias Miller  44:00
Okay, so you you want a report that shows sales orders is it just sales orders? An aging report of sales orders that have not been invoiced? Where

Matthias Miller  44:25
this is we do require a

Speaker 2  44:28
man it would basically be this report, the sales orders needing invoicing minus all of your criteria just like just dump all the sales orders there that have not been invoiced.

Matthias Miller  44:44
Where I get it, I mean, right because it's basically

Unknown Speaker  44:55
this

Matthias Miller  44:57
No, no and not so is quote in that so cancel cancelled and it was it was the well I mean

Speaker 2  45:25
but but we're also getting okay all the sheds right like all of the old sheds re building sitting on their lights on commission basically do all buildings and finished goods inventory have a sales order assigned to them

Matthias Miller  45:54
I don't know. Dwayne.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
He just asked me a question because he saw I was looking away

Matthias Miller  46:03
I did do all MTI buildings of sales orders

Speaker 1  46:13
you all FGI buildings if all buildings on finished goods inventory have sales orders No.

Unknown Speaker  46:20
But I think we're seeing

Speaker 1  46:26
so I mean unless you're using FGI in a different way of my understanding I mean we have tons a lot buildings that don't have sales orders attached to them that are sitting on finished goods inventory

Speaker 3  46:46
will every I mean it hasn't been invoicing you know, we haven't been making the switch those everything's still come up as a sales order or should

Matthias Miller  47:08
this is one that says that it was built straight this was built but not delivered so I mean, I think these are

Speaker 1  47:20
and that's those are buildings that are prior to do the agreement STI agreement, which we never used to mark them off as delivered before

Matthias Miller  47:37
so we need some kind of minimum date or something

Unknown Speaker  47:40
yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:43
Um assuming we should exclude I will no

Unknown Speaker  47:50
mean September 1 or September 30.

Matthias Miller  48:04
Like here's one spilt on the third this is an FBI building How do we show that

Speaker 2  48:18
on this does have a transit to me is this one that it's built for a customer just hasn't been delivered?

Unknown Speaker  48:25
Yeah, look at the tasks

Unknown Speaker  48:30
well, that's one URL

Unknown Speaker  48:32
lower.

Matthias Miller  48:33
There you go. Scheduled for the 24th

Speaker 2  48:38
Yeah, so this would be a perfect example of one that we want to play like

Speaker 2  48:48
maybe maybe we should go back further than that. than 930 but some some type of

Speaker 2  49:02
six one that that? Yeah. Halfway

Matthias Miller  49:08
through then here's one. Great This is $0 so that doesn't matter. Here's one stomped in from SDI that $0 building that was it's a discrepancy

Speaker 2  49:32
we just turned Josh just turned those off last night so shouldn't Yeah, I would say like a report like that. That just shows us

Matthias Miller  49:50
so for any sales were recruited on June 1 Or after

Speaker 2  49:54
or should we be like looking at a rolling? No, let's let's just leave it as a fixed date. And is that something that's easy to put on the phone menu as well?

Matthias Miller  50:07
Yeah, once I build it Do you want this broken down by district or by all districts

Unknown Speaker  50:13
broken down by district?

Matthias Miller  50:23
So really what we're doing is include

Matthias Miller  50:37
include not yet ready

Matthias Miller  50:45
include

Matthias Miller  51:07
we'll do a default value of six one.

Unknown Speaker  51:14
Okay, good.

Speaker 2  51:20
Well, this, this will not include, like, if we were to tomorrow morning request a sales order, like an aging report. It would not include the buildings that assist things need to be invoiced. Right. It's getting a little technical, but or would it include those? Either way? It's fine. I just

Unknown Speaker  51:47
make it up until yesterday?

Matthias Miller  51:51
Like, well, I mean, even that's like, Well, yeah, that's not even that's not quite right. Because you can have something show up and it says it should have been invoiced. You know, two days ago. Um,

Unknown Speaker  52:06
yeah, both places are only one

Matthias Miller  52:10
let's do all add a grouping to this thing. Sales Order, so proposed

Matthias Miller  52:29
reverse the order on and then. Okay, so we really are getting in the weeds here, but we love the weeds

Matthias Miller  53:03
all right. What we'll do is this one, we will we'll group them based on the ones that are already and the ones that aren't. And then you can you can see this.

Unknown Speaker  53:19
Yeah, those at the top and then the others right below.

Unknown Speaker  53:22
Yeah. Perfect. Good, so I will update these lists with

Speaker 2  53:35
what we discussed. And sent those out. Hopefully tomorrow and then

Unknown Speaker  53:41
we will regroup.

Unknown Speaker  53:42
Right in three, right?

Matthias Miller  53:45
That is correct. Right. Yeah. Three. Good, good. Awesome. Thanks, guys.
