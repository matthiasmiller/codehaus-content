Unknown Speaker  00:33
Hey guys, what's up? I'm going to kill my video here

Unknown Speaker  00:54
all right

Unknown Speaker  01:01
all right

Speaker 1  01:16
oh yeah. So Drew reached out to me yesterday and was asking some questions about FGI allocation. And so I hopped on a call with him yesterday afternoon and he was wondering where exactly like when they set up an FBI allocation Where where are the affected areas once that it's set up

Speaker 1  02:01
Does that make sense? So like when you set up? Yeah. One of the FBI financial allegation and then the FBI accounts it is supposed to show something in those accounts? Or Where's where's the information that it's connected with those like the first place he would see it is in the kind of impact report and then for that to get pushed to the accounting system you'd have to reconcile with accounting

Speaker 1  02:44
Does that make sense? Yes. To be the accounting impact report, it would be the I mean, it depends which section B changes it would either be the building accounting impact of the sales with your accounting impact Gotcha. Okay

Unknown Speaker  03:09
I see okay I'm just running it really quick to see

Unknown Speaker  03:35
while I wait on that and then we were also looking at the

Speaker 1  04:03
Oh, the FGI reconcile report so you had sent an email about

Unknown Speaker  04:11
that for sure, it's a that makes somewhere. They like they could import from the like they use the standard failed order ID reconciliation that was throwing a handful of errors and we couldn't quite figure out why.

Speaker 1  04:44
Which, which one was the seen the reports that actually, it was it was the building account and the sales. Now, you ascend Thank you Email I thought I'd save the link somewhere but you had sent an email back a little while ago

Speaker 1  05:21
see oh apply accounting changes good sent that email out the Select Options and the standard building FTI reconcile with accounting report those like trying to run those like putting in bins and sale order IDs it comes back with some errors talking about they need an account name and a debit or credit field but we're not sure exactly where those are supposed to come from. In order to be able to run those in i Is there a date that I can run that can I just do that

Unknown Speaker  06:05
in the test system? I guess I could run it three weeks to I don't know it's done shoot he had written or he had done the date sometimes you may forget what the exact date was

Unknown Speaker  06:47
let it run here and see what

Unknown Speaker  07:04
sticks

Speaker 1  07:36
because like we had tried to answering specific standards and sale orders and that's what I was doing errors

Unknown Speaker  07:51
oh it's only when it only happens when you put in a specific sin mm oh

Unknown Speaker  08:04
so.

Speaker 1  08:30
Like it doesn't recognize like I was having issues because I was wondering if it was something that then I was doing exactly what you're doing first. And I don't know what I did and then all of a sudden it starts showing the correct building. But it still wasn't working for these two other things you had shown

Unknown Speaker  08:58
these are the two things you could set.

Unknown Speaker  09:30
It's pretty painful.

Unknown Speaker  10:08
Let me just make sure I get this straight I'm doing reconciliation on Austin's works with these the ones I sent over once he sent over running this for for Austens does that work that still gives you errors that still gives errors as well got it

Unknown Speaker  10:34
okay then but it's only

Speaker 1  10:47
it's only if you answer a specific thing but it was an error Do you have an example of that skin

Unknown Speaker  11:03
I just bought a random one I think so even if the skin doesn't have a illustrate with a skin that doesn't have any changes yeah a couple of different ones

Speaker 1  11:33
this dispatch server we got to fix that kill that

Speaker 1  12:01
okay I just pulled from initially just pulled from that top the top one that we got that one was completed so then I looked into what happens if there's one that's not complete and it was still giving the same errors

Unknown Speaker  12:38
with accounting

Unknown Speaker  13:00
with this Gi Oh

Unknown Speaker  13:19
Why would it be

Unknown Speaker  13:28
always just one error that you're getting

Speaker 1  13:34
it's specified then does not exist and then it's actually three enter either a debit or credit must be specified and account name is required

Speaker 1  14:13
I just sent you what I get whenever I yeah, like I just pulled off of the top and Bill and Amanda lamb

Unknown Speaker  14:32
Sorry, I just want to fix it. So we're trying to hit input settings header row.

Unknown Speaker  15:17
Why we don't

Unknown Speaker  15:27
okay

Unknown Speaker  15:33
yeah maybe the change of processes.

Unknown Speaker  19:17
Okay

Speaker 1  19:18
so it's basically a harmless error if it's that's all you're getting. It's obnoxious but harmless. But there you go I was just looking at all the transactions that are here in the app or as many as would show up and none of them have been connected to them

Speaker 1  19:51
I was looking at all the transactions that I can find here in the system by going accounting and accounting report transactions and none of them have transaction or have been connected to them

Unknown Speaker  20:10
so it's simple as that being the issue the other ones should have been imported as well though

Unknown Speaker  20:24
is there any way to

Unknown Speaker  20:53
well it's not showing anything with any impact

Unknown Speaker  21:08
on the way buildings why does

Unknown Speaker  21:22
this fast

Speaker 1  21:28
this is answering Wow sorry try this let me show

Speaker 1  23:14
it's a splinter group

Speaker 1  23:41
well that would be why there's been progress but Lena let's go with it

Unknown Speaker  24:08
Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio

Speaker 1  24:17
Do you know for sure if there's a district that has these has any differences? I don't know for sure. I mean, if not, what's the obvious answer but

Unknown Speaker  24:37
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:20
Ah

Unknown Speaker  28:28
yes just gotta be a little more patient with

Unknown Speaker  28:40
so again if we just pick one randomly

Unknown Speaker  29:27
well I mean I think the easiest way without literally doing this this just here would be the meat this is not right

Unknown Speaker  29:48
at all

Unknown Speaker  29:56
your mapping is wrong through mapping is to different companies Ah fair enough so they're going to create bogus transactions the lenders I mean I'm gonna guess the issue is they haven't actually run the reconciliation

Speaker 1  30:20
that's where you're not seeing transactions but yeah

Speaker 1  30:59
so essentially then what they need to do is fix their mapping and then go from there yes, correct

Speaker 1  31:22
fix the mapping and then running reconciliation So, fix the mapping and then run reconciliation again and it should then they should see this transaction showing up

Speaker 1  31:42
Okay, cool. I think that gives me what I need. At least take that back to the drew Yeah. They're still running issue issue. Oh, can you again, but that at least Yeah, it's moving in the right direction. Cool. Thank you. Thanks. Yep. Thank you.
