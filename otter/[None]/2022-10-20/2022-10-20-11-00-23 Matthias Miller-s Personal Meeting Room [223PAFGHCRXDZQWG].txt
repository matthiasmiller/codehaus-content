I actually send an email to Mike this morning about maybe canceling this meeting and he only had two things and we never actually confirmed whether or not we were canceling this so that I give him a few minutes and see if you have signed that we're gonna plan it's canceled

I'm just gonna go ahead and drop off call it a no go. I'm pretty sure it's not showing up and if you happen to see anything otherwise in the email inbox, feel free to ping me. I'll just stay for a bit then. See, maybe they're gonna show. Sure. I'll make you the host and drop off. You'll have to let them into the waiting room if you didn't.

Yeah, yep. Thanks.
