just a heads up on timing of this call I'm gonna have to head out probably about 215 your time getting an appointment I need to be at and pick some stuff up in preparation for that. So I don't know if that changes what we spend our time on wanting to mention in case Sure, a little bit. I probably won't go into much on the general CSS part of things then.

Unknown Speaker  04:54
Let's see. Yeah, then we should probably just go into go into Simba stuff. which case maybe we should actually switch over to the other call and have the recording so, yeah, let's do that. Alright, sounds good to be there.
