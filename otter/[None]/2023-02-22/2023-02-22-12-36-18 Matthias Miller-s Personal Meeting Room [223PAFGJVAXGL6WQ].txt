All right, well,

Matthias Miller  00:51
I'm gonna keep this short, my wife stood in the snow to buy fish and chips from a local food truck for lunch. So very nice to avoid making you listening.

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Can you

Matthias Miller  01:10
chase getting any additional screenshots together that we would need for that? I think basically what we do, we have the project management incident type. And I think there's a lot that we could do just with assigning dates to it, you know, assigning dates to the specific projects, and we don't have hours budgeting. And we don't have some of good Zags, BNC, rejiggering stuff, but might be able to get most of what

Unknown Speaker  01:43
most of what we do most of what they need.

Matthias Miller  02:24
So let's start talk to LS is put together offline, worthless retail pricing been.

Unknown Speaker  02:41
Attack.

Unknown Speaker  02:48
Remember, we're tech pro tech systems. Which one of these?

Unknown Speaker  03:03
All right. Anyway, do

Unknown Speaker  03:04
you have any further thoughts in the

Unknown Speaker  03:06
conversation? No, thanks. So it's encouraging that he's willing to

Unknown Speaker  03:18
move forward with a little bit of stuff after the number of

Speaker 1  03:21
ones that have chosen to look elsewhere? Yeah, it is.

Unknown Speaker  03:28
Yeah. It's kind of makes it kind of difficult that he's

Speaker 1  03:35
on a very tight budgets. So he got to kind of be careful of how much are we? Yeah, we're limited on how much we're able to do for him. But yeah, well, I think stair stepping.

Matthias Miller  03:50
Here's the thing. Here's the really optimistic thing. It sounds to me like the ideal client if he just if he can just grow.

Unknown Speaker  04:02
And if we can get him

Matthias Miller  04:03
on a retail system, and if we can get him used as making little customizations here and there. It might be a long haul, but he might, instead of spending that 20k upfront, it's quite possible spend that 20k Over the next two years.

Speaker 1  04:17
And go on from there. I mean, yeah, yeah, that's very true.

Speaker 1  04:27
So, okay. Yeah, good. Very cool. Anything else? Not at the moment. No. Thank you. Good. Appreciate it. See
