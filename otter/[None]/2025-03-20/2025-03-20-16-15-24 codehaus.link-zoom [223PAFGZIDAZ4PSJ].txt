Matthias Miller  00:40
All right, you're gonna have to put up with two of me here. Oh, that's all right. It's easier to do this than try to prepare my headset with whatever.

Speaker 1  01:02
Yeah, I see you're at Starbucks.

Matthias Miller  01:06
I am. It's that kind of end of day, I suppose. Actually, hang on. I do have my ear pods. Give me a second. Oh, okay. I

Speaker 2  01:25
All right, yep, there we go. Okay, awesome, good.

Unknown Speaker  01:35
So

Matthias Miller  01:37
I don't know what all you wanted to do. My thought was that we jumped into highest priority and I am in Hold on. Let's knock, step, knock, step out mode. Is that good? Perfect.

Speaker 1  01:48
Yep, perfect. I won't. I'll do my best not to slow you down. Alright,

Unknown Speaker  01:55
where do you want to start?

Speaker 1  02:00
If, do we want to start on if we're looking at the sheet, I guess 911, that's still support, I don't know. And then number three, does anyone know why? After computer doesn't update my phone in GHL does not ring. I have bought him a port. I don't know if he's actually connected it to the Ethernet, but it's he has all the tools in his office to do that. Okay, so maybe we, I would say we could jump right into the workflows need to be set up for assigned users.

Speaker 2  02:46
Okay, unless you know that's That sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  02:52
Assign

Matthias Miller  02:54
double task. Example of Michelle Wolf, all right, so what's doing?

Unknown Speaker  02:59
Good. Diagram. Them

Matthias Miller  03:15
as well, until we search for Michelle Wolf. I

Unknown Speaker  03:25
is

Matthias Miller  03:35
here we have a

Unknown Speaker  03:47
one task

Unknown Speaker  03:50
pipeline and so on.

Unknown Speaker  03:53
Opportunity I

Matthias Miller  04:07
opportunity created, updated, updated, change if it was, I have no idea what this is.

Unknown Speaker  04:20
How is Michelle look?

Matthias Miller  04:25
I'm only seeing one opportunity here.

Speaker 1  04:36
They're not seeing any tasks. Where was Michelle's name? I'm still looking at the other document trying to Oh,

Unknown Speaker  04:56
multiple opportunities cannot be created for a customer. I. I guess so,

Matthias Miller  05:02
oh or no, so, is there anything I'm looking at number one, is there anything that, Oh,

Unknown Speaker  05:07
I see some of these got turned on recently.

Speaker 1  05:21
Tiles, I don't know if he is still being double tasked. I can go, oh,

Matthias Miller  05:28
we let's make a list of things going past him.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
So let's do,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
let's do.

Matthias Miller  05:40
But he did have a question about about the full bond leads. So let's go pull up this guy.

Unknown Speaker  05:53
And this was specifically an opportunity

Unknown Speaker  05:55
in here. I

Unknown Speaker  06:16
Yeah, all right, so

Matthias Miller  06:22
I'm assuming

Matthias Miller  06:29
is resolved, because you're not reading task toolbar, and then i i

Speaker 1  06:44
Yeah, I just asked him if he's still receiving double tasks, and use Michelle as an example, and he said, Not recently. So All

Matthias Miller  06:51
right, so I think this has been double strike three format. Okay, multiple opportunities cannot be created for customers that buy one shit, more than one shed, American landing,

Speaker 1  07:18
yeah, so this guy bought either like four or six sheds with his organization. And then, actually, Caleb just sold six sheds to pueblos, one of, I think, the Pueblo school district.

Matthias Miller  07:40
So what happens specifically when you sell multiple

Speaker 1  07:46
well, because it's typically with an entity instead of like just an individual, we Elaine works with them on how to receive payment, and typically we go through it that way. As far as working the lead up until that point, it should be treated the same as any other lead. So they would the salesman provides, if X amount of they in shed app, we have to design that same shed X amount of times, and then the shop needs to have six separate orders. And so that's how we do that.

Matthias Miller  08:24
And then how does it show up in the pipeline? Where's the where's the breakdown in the pipeline? You just, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  08:35
so if you look for,

Unknown Speaker  08:40
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:47
let's do the filters. Everything

Speaker 1  08:54
or not, let's go might be under Bob Lufkin. I

Matthias Miller  09:03
let me go over to the let me go back to the contact and just pull it up there. Okay, wait. Why is that not

Unknown Speaker  09:15
opportunities? What am I missing? It says zero.

Matthias Miller  09:36
I'm so confused, because if I go over here,

Unknown Speaker  09:42
right, you can see that the opportunity exists,

Unknown Speaker  09:44
right? And why is it not?

Unknown Speaker  09:53
That is.

Unknown Speaker  10:04
Any Bob. There

Speaker 1  10:06
we go. Here it is, oh, it's in production. Oh,

Matthias Miller  10:09
I just didn't scroll right. It's probably there. Hold along.

Unknown Speaker  10:19
So I

Matthias Miller  10:25
you break down what's happening and what you want to have

Matthias Miller  10:34
happen. Let me talk to you what I think the problem is. The problem is we don't know. When somebody says, design this building, this building, this building, this building. We don't know if that's them changing their mind or they're saying, I want

Speaker 1  10:47
four. Right, right? Yeah. So the only clarification here is that Eric's opportunity value will replicate like that will show that it's either one expensive shed or multiple at the 21,000 mark for the opportunity value. Other than that, I think, I think probably what we would like to happen is so like, for example, let's say that they wanted to Bob, wanted to buy a greenhouse and a barn style. What I believe the problem is, is, right now it would just, it would just be one opportunity for Bob, regardless of the variety that he's trying to purchase.

Matthias Miller  11:36
Okay, so multiple split based on the variety, yeah,

Speaker 1  11:41
or variety, or even, I mean, or maybe it's just like they can, it's not a lot. They're not allowed to have more than one unit per opportunity.

Matthias Miller  11:57
I mean, the problem is in the quoting phase, once again, like, yeah, I want a greenhouse. No, no, no. I mean, this is not a very common example, but you still don't know the difference between I think I want a greenhouse. No, I'm gonna do, I'm gonna, I don't know, have the chicken windows, chicken goo. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  12:16
Yeah, no, I That's true,

Matthias Miller  12:19
but what we could do is, and I don't know if this is happening, but I would expect, at a minimum, that when an order gets processed and it's a sale, then we should always create an opportunity, no matter what, Right, and that's probably the now so then, or it, well, it's, it's really, yeah, it's, it's when the in the Yeah, once we get down payment, um,

Speaker 1  12:52
yeah. Because right now it's right. Because right what we're saying for the there should be, instead of one opportunity of Bob's sitting in production. It should be. There might be three in production right now. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:13
Okay, this is just, that's just something I need to chase somebody. I mean, I think if that's the only behavior change, I don't know how to handle the reporting five different sheds here.

Speaker 1  13:24
I mean, could it be as simple as we just turn that into a could we create a tag and just say, Trust change mind, or something like that, so where we could at least filter it out when we're trying to gather data, data.

Matthias Miller  13:51
But logically, you want an opportunity to be the opportunity like, I mean, this is, again, like philosopher, topically, the most ideal world is when what's in the outside, external world reflects what's in the software. So, so in this case, it is a change of opportunities. Now, what we could also do, perhaps, and I think this could work, is if there would be some kind of way

Unknown Speaker  14:18
to

Matthias Miller  14:21
and I think if you would put in the No, it's not until processing that we link it together. But if you would, when you modify a building design, does it create a new quote with a new ID.

Speaker 1  14:43
You know, if it, if it's saved, it will okay.

Matthias Miller  14:48
I mean,

Speaker 1  14:51
so the way TSA works say you went and designed four different styles of shed one night, and you saved every single one of them. I will get no. A fight of every each of those is an individual quote in TSA.

Matthias Miller  15:09
Okay, here's another option. Doing one of if you need to manage it in the pipeline, would be having a an override on either the quantity or the opportunity value,

Matthias Miller  15:39
I would still tend to,

Unknown Speaker  15:47
I don't know how it was done in HubSpot.

Matthias Miller  15:53
I would still think of conceptually if a bill, if somebody's building is buying multiple buildings at the same time, even though it's multiple buildings, I would still consider that a single opportunity, unless it's two different you know, buying for a business versus a campground versus their home, and they're getting all three locations at once. Sure, um,

Speaker 1  16:18
so would you say? So say you wanted to buy a greenhouse and a chicken coop? Would you say that's at me as the salesman, I feel like I that's two individual opportunities, because it's two separate things I have to sell the customer on.

Matthias Miller  16:35
Okay, that's fair, but if I'm buying three chicken coops, right? So that's

Unknown Speaker  16:40
different than like a bulk order,

Unknown Speaker  16:44
okay? So,

Matthias Miller  16:57
all right, let me, let me. I. I'm

Unknown Speaker  17:10
trying to remember what we have in the

Matthias Miller  17:17
what we have is for how TSA thinks about, thinks about these as separate lines. Okay, so you are still proposing, oh, we can do this.

Unknown Speaker  17:39
So I can

Matthias Miller  17:41
take it. We don't have to leave same time with that. Now, okay, is that? Is that what you're after?

Speaker 1  17:49
Yeah, so the specific example where that we used here with Bob Lufkin, is he, he wanted to buy a bulk of the same, I think the same shadow maybe like two two, like multiple of two styles or designs. So I think what Eric was originally saying was that that couldn't happen. But I think where it actually gets more, where it actually gets more important is if I have a customer who wants to buy a horse shelter and a chicken coop, or a greenhouse and a chicken coop. So I think,

Unknown Speaker  18:32
I think that's more important, because Eric might disagree, but I I can, I can ask him, and I can add a note if needed,

Matthias Miller  18:48
yeah, I mean, I just think there's, we can give you a manual way to split out something into separate opportunities, and we can have some kind of way of trying to match. I mean, I can see what it takes to try to match it. It's just doing this automatically. Is, well, because, like, TSA does not track where this one came from. If there would be a way to say that, well, they quoted this, and it turned into that quote. And here's the new idea. And we could trace that history, right? But we can't.

Unknown Speaker  19:27
So, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  19:32
yeah, but I'm a little I am somewhat. The other thing is, does the is there any field in TSA that we could use like,

Matthias Miller  19:51
like, for example. This is a little crazy, but could we let you say, um. And, you know, could we have some kind of tagging system where you could, you could put a tag in the notes and that will split opportunities.

Unknown Speaker  20:12
Oh, interesting.

Matthias Miller  20:16
It will not help when the when the when the customer is modifying quotes. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  20:22
So that's downside?

Unknown Speaker  20:27
Yeah.

Speaker 1  20:33
I think if we get that far in, I would probably want feedback from the guys that are more sensitive to it.

Matthias Miller  20:44
Okay, I'll let you chase that. I will look at this part I can take a look at or we can hear from you. Okay, so when I clarify this, Jesse and this is for Matthias, all right, focus on the TSA customer has an opportunity. Needs to update, the opportunity to share the latest quote, quotes designed on TSA, right? Customer,

Speaker 1  21:14
Oh, yeah. So um, so say. So there, there are scenarios where you're in TSA, and you design and save a shed, and in TSA, it's not assigned to anybody yet, for some reason. And so it's not so it the quote is just sitting there unassigned until it's manually updated. So I don't let me. Let me. I mean, manage quotes.

Matthias Miller  21:48
Let me. I mean, yes, I believe you, but let me see if I believe you.

Unknown Speaker  21:54
I don't know if you'll find one.

Matthias Miller  21:57
Let me check something here. So if I go into I mean,

Speaker 1  22:11
so and I don't know if you scroll down in our manage quotes, if you look at somebody by the name of Allison Bucha, B, E, Q, U, e, t, t, e, or even Dana Franklin, D, A, n, a, and then Franklin, you'll see that that quote exists, but if there's no assigned sales person,

Matthias Miller  22:36
okay, let's go to Sir Dana

Unknown Speaker  22:40
Franklin.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Okay, so here we have

Unknown Speaker  22:50
the opportunity

Matthias Miller  22:54
signed to you.

Speaker 1  22:57
That's so this is one of my former customers back when I was a salesman, and so they're a returning customer. So I they saved a quote, I think I went in, found it, assigned it to me, and then handed it off.

Matthias Miller  23:16
I guess it was not originally that created with you. So let's go see what happens. Was there, was there any tags on spot? Let me also see recent. Has this been happening with

Speaker 3  23:42
Hey? This Guy, that's what I was looking for.

Matthias Miller  25:35
While we could choose, I'm missing some stuff here, and I can figure out where,

Unknown Speaker  25:41
that's where it is.

Unknown Speaker  25:48
There we go, there we go, there we go.

Speaker 2  26:00
I Let's find the contacts.

Matthias Miller  26:20
I thought we had maybe, maybe that's Part

Unknown Speaker  26:37
of the issue.

Unknown Speaker  26:42
That's when I would have imported everything. I think

Unknown Speaker  26:47
this was the import.

Matthias Miller  26:54
This would have probably been. I

Matthias Miller  27:20
But are we sure that this is really a good example? Because wouldn't

Speaker 1  27:26
I'm no, I'm not sure this is a great example. No,

Matthias Miller  27:32
but because you were the one, let's see where you find where you assigned it. Here's where you assign it. So you did manually assign it, and then here's This integration, February 403,

Unknown Speaker  27:46
where we set, okay, that's, that's

Unknown Speaker  28:05
followers removed. We removed a follower,

Matthias Miller  28:11
and you signed it to somebody else. So this was the import,

Unknown Speaker  28:15
I mean, but if it was

Matthias Miller  28:19
okay, but then there's this other thing,

Speaker 2  28:28
Robin, I,

Unknown Speaker  28:46
let's see I don't think I ever I

Matthias Miller  29:04
here's

Unknown Speaker  29:13
what I think it is

Matthias Miller  29:16
Well, and I guess Hang on, because if we I

Matthias Miller  29:24
contacts or tags. Some ways we should rename this auto created isn't really a I

Matthias Miller  29:44
isn't a great name, it's really like auto sign, right? You'd be able to rename, which we can't easily do, but I think, I think that the real best solution is, i.

Matthias Miller  30:16
Okay, Does anything need to happen with this? Wait, some conversations are sent through HubSpot.

Speaker 1  30:26
HubSpot is that is that's been fixed. We can close

Unknown Speaker  30:31
that out all right, okay,

Matthias Miller  30:34
so this is all very soundly in my court, which I can chase.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
Okay.

Matthias Miller  30:42
Ask page.

Matthias Miller  30:50
I don't, I don't know, like I would think the janky she could maybe be done for 500 to two grand.

Matthias Miller  31:19
Yeah, I don't know what your thoughts on that.

Speaker 1  31:22
How other from from user experience, how much time do you think is lost without that task page right now, I think it's

Matthias Miller  31:33
a lot. I think it's it's the kind of thing that's the it's the five seconds, five and 15 seconds that adds up. And the worst part of it is, I don't know if you've ever seen any of the studies around cost of context switching, but it's the whole I gotta, it's, it's, I suspect the biggest issue is actually not just the literal time lost, but the I need to go find my place and remember what I was doing, right? Yeah, right. It the same as an interruption when you're in flow state. So here's what I would do, actually on this one, let me see if I can find this. So let's go. I want to, I want to do this. Make sure these are cross linked. I and then what I would do is, let's go make up a sheet viewer, and let's go to tasks I

Unknown Speaker  32:46
So we would have,

Matthias Miller  32:57
we have title,

Speaker 3  33:00
we'd have a have description here. Let's do this now. Let's do this. I

Unknown Speaker  33:25
and then we have

Unknown Speaker  33:28
contact and

Matthias Miller  33:44
I know why GHL insists on putting names in lowercase, but anyway,

Unknown Speaker  33:58
due date,

Matthias Miller  34:00
come on, let me copy you. And we're using like that, so Just let me do

Unknown Speaker  34:15
it. I'm then also, do I.

Matthias Miller  35:15
The actual opportunity, like this opportunity, right? Come on. No crazy

Unknown Speaker  35:26
attending I just saw the time i

Unknown Speaker  35:44
is in the

Unknown Speaker  36:01
okay? So

Matthias Miller  36:09
when I say janky, I meant it okay, but, but, but imagine something like this, where it's sorted by opportunity stage. You can pop into the link here. You can pop into the contact and you can go into the pass. Let's see if the pass pulls up, the property up and the other should, but this one, see, this one does. No, it doesn't. Oh, great. I don't know if there's any way to i Well, I think the answer is, there just is no, you can't go straight into the past. You pop into the opportunity or the contacts, and then it's going to be, it'll be sorted by opportunity, stage, latest, first, and then by due date. So latest stage, earliest, due date, earliest, the latest within that.

Speaker 1  37:04
Okay, and so if I'm the if I'm the salesman, I have that open in a separate on either a different screen or a different window, and in my then you

Matthias Miller  37:18
would do, you would do something like this. Let's go into agency settings.

Unknown Speaker  37:30
I don't know where these

Unknown Speaker  37:34
press the menu Links. I

Unknown Speaker  37:46
that's a crop or whatever I

Matthias Miller  38:08
say, like it here i

Unknown Speaker  38:31
i really like

Unknown Speaker  38:39
me. I

Speaker 1  39:02
I don't know Anyway, the idea, yeah, sorry, go ahead. Oh, go ahead. So it would just be a tab on that left column on that and we see

Matthias Miller  39:12
if we can get it to pop into this middle space. But first what we should do is,

Matthias Miller  39:28
we'll drop this in the link or in the doc, and you guys can take a look.

Unknown Speaker  39:39
What am I looking for the CS um.

Matthias Miller  40:40
I don't know, But yeah,

Speaker 1  40:42
I think so, yeah, I'll, I'll see if, see if he's good with that. And we think this is more of the, this is just getting our foot in the door to maybe a less janky option down the down the road. Or are we saying this is,

Matthias Miller  41:01
well, it might be a toss up if you're happy with this general approach. Yeah. I mean, we can have this be a list in key option, and have it actually be a web page and and all that. So I'm it might not actually be that much cost difference if you're pretty happy with the if you guys agree in this kind of model,

Speaker 1  41:24
okay, that sounds good. Then I'll review it with him, and then we'll get back to you there. He might have other questions about it, but have you done is that? Is that that model something you've done with a client before?

Matthias Miller  41:41
No, I now, what we've done with clients before has typically just been so what we've typically done, what we have done before, has been setting follow up tasks auto, automatically created follow up tasks for a 5pm due date with auto advancing to the next day if it's incomplete, okay, which means that your manually created tasks then are always at the top. And you could do something similar to that as well, if you wanted to where you, I mean, you, you could say you're late stage, or due at 1am and your next stage at two, in your previous stage at 2am 3am 4am and use that to control the sword. But, I mean, I don't know that, but the filters is the other issue. Like, you got to get the filters right, all this, all that stuff. So,

Speaker 1  42:38
yeah, okay, I'll see, yeah, I'll see what Eric thinks and how that aligns with what he had in mind. And if he's good with it, then it would probably, I'd like it seems like a small investment for a solution. So

Unknown Speaker  42:58
something, okay, alright.

Speaker 1  43:02
Well, I yeah, that's, that's super helpful. We'll be at the Home and Garden Show. So if you guys are going out there for with the family, poke your head in

Matthias Miller  43:14
cool which? Which one is that it's a

Speaker 1  43:17
Pathfinder. It's the, I think it's the Fremont County. It's Friday and Saturday, not 9am to 4pm so nine to four,

Matthias Miller  43:26
what I should do is go work from the See, I don't know what I have tomorrow morning, go work from the poor house for a few minutes, and swing by and say hi. I'm like, way there. Yeah, yeah. There you go. What time did you say again? Nine to four. Yep. Okay,

Speaker 1  43:41
great. So good deal. Um, also, this is totally random, yeah, you sent me an invite to do your podcast. I'm happy to do it. I got caught up in filling in the boxes and then just interrupted. But if you ever want me to do that, I'd be happy to help

Matthias Miller  43:56
out. I don't want that anymore. We had it was pulling teeth to book. Like, I had a guy who says he's done this in every industry everywhere, and it's always worked. And he's like, we've been calling people, we've been flipping over rocks and like, everything. And he says crickets. And I had like, three, like three quarters of them, no shows, oh, and so. But I do have something and ask for you, if you're open to it, I am getting ready to publish a book, release a book in 10 days, a booklet like pages on frictionless teams. Oh yeah. So if you want to read it and provide a little bit of a blur to go with it. I'm looking for credibility within the shed industry. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  44:48
yeah. Is that you have? Is it a digital booklet? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:52
it'll be digital for now and then in about a month, we'll have print copies out.

Speaker 1  44:57
Okay, yeah, I'd be happy to read. And give you a blurb,

Matthias Miller  45:01
sweet, awesome

Speaker 1  45:03
man. Well, thank you so much. Hope you guys have a good evening, and we'll talk to you soon. All right. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  45:09
Thanks, Chris. All right. See ya. Yep. See you. Back.
