Unknown Speaker  00:16
Hey Austin

Unknown Speaker  00:17
Matthias

Unknown Speaker  00:20
Happy Thursday.

Unknown Speaker  00:22
Happy Thursday guess Tim is joining us to probably

Unknown Speaker  00:32
yes he is supposed to be see where he was going CSS wiki I think has lunch Good morning. Good morning

Unknown Speaker  01:16
Austin, do you have cold yucky weather this morning too?

Speaker 1  01:22
It's cold. I don't think it's raining yet. Think maybe it's supposed to rain a little later.

Speaker 2  01:30
Yeah, we were supposed to forecast last night was showing snow for a few hours this morning. changing to rain later, but it's been

Speaker 1  01:38
sleet that's in the low 40s here, so probably no snow.

Speaker 2  01:48
Yeah, all righty. Matthias any idea if Nick is going to be joining today? I

Matthias Miller  01:58
don't know if he's joining today or not? And I can I think we can probably you message him? And if he comes, he comes if

Unknown Speaker  02:09
he doesn't show up then Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  02:18
All right. So basically, here we're looking at different things, see how far we can get along this list of

Speaker 2  02:32
ideas and projects is we can start from the top and just try to

Unknown Speaker  02:46
avoid getting too bogged down in anything if we yeah, we are getting running out of steam on something, we can table it for another time. And? Sure, go from there. So sorry, someone, someone's gonna say something,

Speaker 1  03:07
oh, I just, I was gonna say something about this particular one here. As we get started, had put a little bit of thought into this one. And this one, I started this one in the first place, the more I think about it, the more I think my original idea probably isn't the best option. And at least for my purposes, I don't know about for bigger, bigger level project management purposes. And I think it's becoming less of a pain point as I get a better understanding of how things are supposed to be working. But I do still think that a two pane report testing jobs change requests could be beneficial. Just to get a bigger picture of what's going on. That could be testing jobs, change requests that can be filtered down, easily filtered down by

Matthias Miller  03:58
project by client code, client code. Yeah. I mean, can we just literally give it a shot? No, nevermind, because we'll have to have a oh, I have an idea. We could do this if we have a left pane of client codes. And then we can use existing reports. So we do a what is it called subscription? Now that's a Wow, no wonder what would help if I do this in DC

Unknown Speaker  04:39
Sch.

Speaker 2  04:45
This will be all testing jobs and all change requests or would it be like you'd have it could it could be.

Speaker 1  04:55
They could show all my thinking is it could show all testing jobs and all change requests. Is but would be most helpful to narrow it down to client code.

Speaker 2  05:08
So it wouldn't be just like for for CWA views, the change requests and the corresponding testing jobs

Speaker 1  05:18
reports Yeah, and that's that's how I think it would be used most of the time, but I think it also could be helpful to see all of them could be nice to see all of them.

Matthias Miller  05:30
Alright, let me let me let me try this

Speaker 3  05:36
so this pain is this guy key list item. Now let's do this make this macro. Low subscription. P. Actually, let's Oh, yeah, that's probably better way to do it. Anyway. Okay, woke. subscription. And then the change request report we exit slow. Oh, yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1  06:37
Yeah, and if we're gonna prioritize something, I would prioritize getting that change request reports but up over making this new report.

Unknown Speaker  06:48
That was Nick and Ellis, we're going to choose that or at least Nick.

Matthias Miller  06:58
You could ping Nick and see where it's at. Unless and unless you can easily find it in client cockpit. We're gonna call this the client cockpit. And then we're also going to have

Unknown Speaker  07:10
a concat no a plus

Matthias Miller  07:17
to get a blank item and then we're going to show

Unknown Speaker  07:20
the place an A and then I encode the ask and then we're going to have a sub pain

Matthias Miller  07:40
to pain columns to the right.

Unknown Speaker  07:44
Resize so panes column two. Oh, yeah. That'd be column two. 100 Uh huh. Save it run it send it out. Y'all drop in the chat here. Look at that soup today

Matthias Miller  08:10
that's a little weird because when I have an ask prompt and I guess we could actually give an Ask prompt

Unknown Speaker  08:14
and have it

Matthias Miller  08:17
filter the left pane down to the Ask prompt but having having the client code on the left makes it we have the client code on the left it makes it easier to reuse the existing reports

Matthias Miller  08:37
can do the initial selection very easily

Speaker 3  08:45
Okay, I can't really but what we could do as crops this would be easy ask subscription list subscription incidents subscription code Yeah, try that.

Matthias Miller  09:23
I don't know what prompts you went on the you send me what as prompts you went on the change request report? I can

Unknown Speaker  09:31
plug that in. Yeah.

Speaker 1  09:38
Did you let's see, what did you change your okay, you added that prompt.

Matthias Miller  09:42
I added the Ask prompts if you select it, and then you'll see just that item in the left pane cool. Oh, actually, I have a better idea. What if in the in the left pane Don't we have a note section that has all the information related to a client? Like the system the

Unknown Speaker  10:08
on a contact record you? Oh, yeah. Come on

Matthias Miller  10:14
is yielding to this,

Unknown Speaker  10:16
if you could display here,

Matthias Miller  10:18
oh, even better, we're gonna just hang out one moment, we're gonna get this thing nailed soon. Okay, so we're going to do so the Ask prompts, look, subscription is going to be okay, this is going to be a contact level report.

Speaker 3  10:33
And contact height equals

Matthias Miller  10:38
ad posting client and is found the Ask subscription in

Unknown Speaker  10:45
the contact name.

Matthias Miller  10:49
Match the do not match case match whole

Speaker 3  10:51
word. Okay. And then this is going to be contact notes. Text. And then look subscription becomes just the Ask prompt. So let's try is easy. Okay, the left pane needs to be wider. To like, column, this column needs to be. 50 students laughing about? Yeah, try that. See, it looks

Speaker 1  11:54
like we got those details multiple times. I think probably because there's multiple contact records with the same information. Maybe?

Matthias Miller  12:03
Yes, we could do

Speaker 3  12:06
sort by. Here, let me do this. I think I can. Max, X number of rows. duplicates, suppress duplicates, grouping plus sort. And we're just going to do

Speaker 3  12:38
okay, well, we'll just do the do the first one. Refresh, and you should have it.

Speaker 1  12:47
That's really cool. Yeah, I like it. Yeah, I would want to play around with it a little bit, especially the columns and the column order, that would be most helpful on the two panes. But, yeah, I think we're getting there. Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  13:08
this one dropped the link. Tim, can you drop the link back in? And it's back in Austin squirt to come up with whatever revisions he wants?

Speaker 1  13:14
Sure. Am I going to be on that link? I'm going to be able to go in and edit the columns just like anything else, right?

Matthias Miller  13:21
No, I'm using the standard reports. Okay. But what we could do is we can we can convert these. There's a I don't know if we have any systems or if you run across this, but there's a report customer? Oh, no, I don't remember what it's called. There's a feature that lets lets you define a report as being customizable by a per user basis. And we could enable that for these two reports. And then you could come up with a report configuration that puts the shows the columns in whatever order you want, in whichever columns you want, but then it's going to be applied anytime you run the report.

Speaker 1  13:59
Yeah, anytime you run the standard change requests or testing job report,

Unknown Speaker  14:03
okay, yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:06
No, if we if we need to clone those reports to customize for the cockpit, I'm we can consider it the other the other thing we could also do is instead of doing a side by side layout, we could also do a top and bottom layout

Speaker 1  14:25
I think I prefer a side by side layout personally, but I can I can work with that. But that that gets me the mechanics I can work on coming up with what exactly I would want for the layout.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
Okay, sounds good. Sure.

Speaker 2  14:47
Would it help Austin is part of the the issue with like, Would it help be able to shrink down the left column?

Speaker 1  14:55
Yeah, part of the issue is the width and just having scroll all the way on the right Report score always the right. Like, I don't care about most of that information in this sort of report, honestly. So as long as I can see what I need, then I don't care if there's extra information to scroll over to the right.

Speaker 2  15:21
Yeah. Do you have a preferably? Do you have a viewer preference of which is the middle pane like this? In my mama, we

Speaker 1  15:34
change I think the change request should be the middle pane. Yeah, you're right. I

Unknown Speaker  15:38
mean, it is a flow of

Matthias Miller  15:40
stuff. To me, you can go into the settings and just

Speaker 3  15:44
flip the look around. Just change the pain numbers. Under sub pains. Pains.

Speaker 2  15:55
Oh, just seems just one to two. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
What is that like that?

Unknown Speaker  16:09
Can't see what that message is saying.

Matthias Miller  16:17
You have an extra pane at the bottom, delete that one and that'll be happy.

Unknown Speaker  16:24
If you can't if I need to save

Unknown Speaker  16:33
messages saying here

Speaker 3  16:39
maybe it's requiring you to you might actually have to manually swap the contents. Okay. So janky, but that works. There we go. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:13
Excellent. Cool. That was fun.

Unknown Speaker  17:20
Yep. What else we got?

Speaker 2  17:25
All right. So that was done. Back to you, Austin. Yep. I will. Next one here is to have input metrics, and pseudo input metrics. And you got notes here about what clients good uses.

Speaker 2  17:55
So, yeah, my guess where Matthias? What would you like us to chase on this? You want us to pick things out of this, that would be helpful for us? Do you want us to potentially clone this and spec it out? Well, what are your thoughts here?

Matthias Miller  18:16
I mean, it's all of these questions. Um. Let's see. Yeah, I don't know if I understand fully. Nick, every time a dev input is created, it creates a row in the does the tester create multiple rows of data? Multiple issues?

Unknown Speaker  18:43
Yeah. Well, it's supposed to,

Matthias Miller  18:48
was supposed to.

Unknown Speaker  18:59
I think. I think I don't

Matthias Miller  19:10
think there's any syncing required.

Unknown Speaker  19:15
I think we could just make

Matthias Miller  19:16
we could just replicate the behavior. I think the question is, there's two questions. One is, excuse me, is Ellis on board with having his with this general concept of having a documented history reasons and having his guys document the resolution?

Speaker 3  19:40
And, if so, do you guys agree with, like, test a

Matthias Miller  19:48
reason? I think testing testing instruction clarification, expected behavior, confirm testing results. Request for test data requests enhancement, awaiting triple code, the only thing I don't think we need awaiting triple code. You could put that in strikethrough. But I think all of the others do make sense. to Austin, are there other reasons that you would check a div and put?

Speaker 1  20:16
Okay. To clarify clarification, unexpected behavior, confirm

Unknown Speaker  20:24
test data request enhancement. Let's see.

Speaker 1  20:35
Requests for Yeah, let's see, um, what are some of the other things?

Unknown Speaker  20:41
Let's see,

Speaker 1  20:43
maybe that request for test data that's getting at when I don't have access to something which isn't that unusual or happens sometimes, like there's a file that I need, I don't have access to that happens sometimes. The other one, and maybe this is this would come under ti clarification. But there, there are some circumstances where something comes through in a test job and it seems to me like a discrepancy with a proposal, or the mockups or something like that. And sometimes it's the case that things were changed and not documented or things were changed and I didn't and then they were documented, but I didn't know about it. And and I didn't quickly find the documentation. So and maybe that's proposal discrepancy or something like that. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think that's covered in that list there. I don't that one doesn't happen all that often. unexpected behavior ti clarification and sometimes I don't know which of those it is but I can guess and sometimes I think the dev ought to be able to change that if my guess was wrong

Matthias Miller  22:13
I think proposal discrepancy I think it's probably worth noting

Matthias Miller  22:34
so then you would basically for every issue you would you would add a row and then I think you might Nick does the tester then notes it in the testing results which

Unknown Speaker  22:49
issue it is

Speaker 4  22:56
I mean all all of that stays in the RG Okay, so well the typically the test will add a row they will add the testing issue whether that's to add a clarification you know, whatever unexpected behavior often they'll copy their notes in the notes section sometimes they don't and then the Dev is supposed to respond and march resolution but essentially none of that actually goes into the testing results

Unknown Speaker  23:33
so

Speaker 2  23:47
am I understanding correctly like do they do they still leave the same comments in the in the testing results? Like commenting in line with the TI like like you currently do, as well as setting the RG rose? Yeah. It was kind of like a tag for documentation of what the issue type is. So there's some double entry work in a sense, provides a lot of a lot of

Speaker 3  24:24
data for reporting

Speaker 1  24:29
it doesn't feel like terrible much double entry it's pretty straightforward ya know that

Matthias Miller  24:41
on the clients good side, there's a good bit of back and forth to make sure that it doesn't

Unknown Speaker  24:46
become heavy handed for the for the development for the developers. We don't really want to burden anybody down with A whole bunch of stuff.

Matthias Miller  25:29
I mean, is that, so what I guess what I would? Okay, so then there's two things that are worth documenting, I think what is, what does Austin do when he has a dev input? Well, you know, add the row, here's what needs to be specified, what is what is the developer expected to do? And then what's the resolution required to flag a dev input? And to clear a dev input? When you check, give input, presumably you should have unresolved items? Well, actually, maybe not. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:01
I don't know. Nick, you probably know better than I do, even with allegations.

Speaker 4  26:11
I'm not sure what the validation is for checking in, because we don't do testing. But we do have validation against clearing or providing resolution for all testing issues, and then leaving dev input checked.

Unknown Speaker  26:34
Maybe,

Speaker 1  26:35
maybe it's two checkboxes on these rows, like one has a checkbox that's dev input needed. And that would uncheck when the dev responds to a specific issue and another one is resolved. And the tester would check that one, when the tester feels like that row rows issue is resolved.

Matthias Miller  27:03
Or if it needs to go back to the developer, it's another dev input row. The resolution specified basically tells you whether it's dev input or not.

Speaker 1  27:19
So you're saying create another row? For the same issue? If it's back to Dev.

Matthias Miller  27:28
Nick, how would you guys do it there's a tester clear it or do they clear the resolution? Or do they?

Speaker 2  27:44
We'll think it would be handy to have a way to track at the same I've gone back and forth one or three or five times

Speaker 4  27:56
sorry, and representing that doesn't that doesn't typically happen a whole lot. Usually would be if there was no a TI clarification. That wasn't clear enough.

Speaker 1  28:16
Probably actually, the big the biggest time when that happens is if my dev input isn't clear enough I think Sure. Oftentimes, if it's if it's coming back I think probably the majority of the time it's me needing to clarify something in my question or we sure

Matthias Miller  28:41
you can you can have a resolution of a

Unknown Speaker  28:47
tester

Matthias Miller  28:52
tester require I don't know tester clarification required and then you would clarify it and clear the resolution and bump it back

Unknown Speaker  29:14
or even a unable to

Matthias Miller  29:21
unable to resolve or something like that. They would bump it and then it come back to you and you would

Unknown Speaker  29:28
that's not exactly right

Matthias Miller  29:39
It seems to me that the two checkboxes I'm not entirely opposed to but it seems redundant with the resolution drop list.

Speaker 1  29:44
What if What if you have another another list that is Devin put me to test your input needed, resolved, or something like that?

Unknown Speaker  29:57
Like a status column

Matthias Miller  30:03
just thinking

Matthias Miller  30:14
so you're looking for a sign off process from the tester to say this issue

Unknown Speaker  30:19
was resolved I think so.

Matthias Miller  30:29
Okay, well, you could do two checkboxes tester reason notes, tester input needed checkbox, resolution and then after resolution or after after related

Unknown Speaker  30:43
tests are confirmed I think Devin Yeah, Okay, nevermind, you're doing that right with that you have the snippet button there.

Unknown Speaker  31:21
But that's just for those those incidents.

Speaker 1  31:30
By the way, one of those snippets got us into a bit of trouble on a testing job a bit ago on a change request. How was that? So I wrote up the change request, Tim ended up writing the client requirements. It was that one Nick, you you were the depth for this? That's the one in in CPP where, where it was supposed to show all the church rows and you were like, Oh, yes, the client requirements says this Well, I think that wording was from a snippet and it created a pretty big confusion sure

Matthias Miller  32:11
how to create confusion more efficiently create an unclear template replicate wildly

Unknown Speaker  32:24
This is why am

Matthias Miller  32:26
I gonna get us distracted. Okay, so ending basically cloned this

Speaker 3  32:34
what is fn something number we get on the VPN here. Nikki might be able to erase the neck

Speaker 4  33:15
have no idea job testing issue row num is the field. Its description is job testing issue row number. So that's it. I don't know why it's labeled an S N Yeah, I mean it's just a row number the RG

Unknown Speaker  33:34
row number but it's the row number.

Unknown Speaker  33:38
Yeah okay,

Speaker 4  33:42
happy isn't it is actually a field been an expression I think

Unknown Speaker  33:45
well just change it to your ID right righty or just straight up ID

Matthias Miller  33:59
I think it's no it's visible so that you can symbol yeah

Unknown Speaker  34:05
it's so that you can cross reference yep. Okay sure. So

Matthias Miller  34:16
okay. So you can delete a waiting to propel you could add your an incident does have the right tester right active testers

Speaker 1  34:36
add proposal discrepancy with adding proposal discrepancy for my tester reasons do we need wrestle different resolutions for for those. That That might mean we might need a proposal clarification and the resolution

Matthias Miller  35:01
Yep, proposal clarified.

Unknown Speaker  35:07
And then we're not doing triple codes yet.

Matthias Miller  35:12
Oh, fun fact, not to distract. But zfp is in development and is awaiting updates because they're wildly reworking some core platform features that could result in all faxes, all historical facts is being sent out again, if we were to update if we had updated at the wrong time. So here's why. And they think they're going to be done by the end of the month. But we have like,

Unknown Speaker  35:37
some fairly

Matthias Miller  35:42
interested business stakeholders and some changes that are coming out. And so here's why we don't run in development. I am very, very grateful cch is in staging and beyond delighted. So.

Speaker 2  35:52
Wow. Well, somebody just earned their paycheck for the week by just covering that. That would have right?

Matthias Miller  36:03
That's, that would be a big back spill right there. I don't even think about it. Okay. So then

Matthias Miller  36:17
then after notes, we would have a test your input, test, test your input needed.

Speaker 3  36:33
After Oh, before resolution, yep.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
The checkbox? Yep. Yeah, checkbox.

Matthias Miller  36:47
And then after related, we would have a tester confirmed.

Unknown Speaker  37:04
And then

Matthias Miller  37:05
you say no, just stealing way back? Is this where we want to be spending our time and the rest of the call here? Or is there other things that are that would be higher priority

Unknown Speaker  37:11
nailed down? Good question. Hmm,

Speaker 2  37:31
fair question. I guess we can it can be good to have something else keep things moving and should like should often and I circle up to write more

Matthias Miller  37:46
stuff here as far as what I think I think we're really close. And then it's just a matter of what specific validation do you need? To make sure that everything, nothing goes sideways. And then from there, it's a good sign off, make sure Ellis is on board from a workflow standpoint. And good.

Speaker 1  38:06
One of the things we have to figure out here is how this is going to affect the statuses of, of the jobs. Because I mean, theoretically, you could have a job here with this RG that's both in dev input and testing needed. I'm not sure how our statuses are going to handle that. I mean, ideally, all your rows would be either resolved or you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have both testing needed. And dev input needed. Checked in the same in the RG on the job at the same time.

Matthias Miller  38:46
Yeah, the developer should resolve everything they possibly can. Yeah. And so if the developer needs to do anything, it's testing test or dev input needed Yes. Like there's no reason for that to be.

Matthias Miller  39:14
Again, not opposed to spending our time time on this now, but I do think it is at a point where the rest of you guys can.

Unknown Speaker  39:33
Okay

Speaker 2  39:37
yeah, well, let's plan to circle up I guess one quick question Matthias incident types that this should be applied to.

Unknown Speaker  39:47
Is this

Unknown Speaker  39:48
clients go? Bug bug

Matthias Miller  39:50
enhancement or research? Bug enhancement research? Okay. Anything that currently shows the dev input checkbox

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Okay okay,

Speaker 2  40:16
yeah well let's play the circle up on a flat Austin and maybe next year we'll have input and then we can bring it back to us

Speaker 2  40:34
even another call to iron things out or we will feel like we haven't far enough to just send it out

Unknown Speaker  40:42
to get approvals All right, then see this one is this one

Speaker 2  41:21
the newer preference between talking about this basically improve the documentation process versus the other linking with three letter codes and

Unknown Speaker  41:37
last update dates and stuff like that.

Speaker 1  41:40
Mmm hmm. I don't know that I have much of a preference. I've been really confused. I mean, where that last update field conversation has been going has been a little bit over my head and my head it seemed a lot simpler than was whatever it is that's happening with it now but

Speaker 2  42:01
whatever that might be a good place to go because it kind of impacted me other stuff can you scroll

Matthias Miller  42:19
down so I can regain context?

Matthias Miller  42:31
Okay, so you would like

Unknown Speaker  42:36
Ah ha ha ha. Yeah, but okay, here's the challenge.

Matthias Miller  43:03
In terms of where something is, we use what version something is, we use a release date based on the target production date, which would be the end of the staging cycle. So, so that's so soon when we could into something into development development is something like 2020 two.or 20 23.02 or something, because that's when it's gonna hit production, or it's probably a three by now I don't know. And then that version follows it. So when it moves into staging, staging becomes a version etc. When entering under normal development cycles when you're not double coding it that that works perfectly to know whether staging has the change or not.

Unknown Speaker  43:45
Because I'm

Matthias Miller  43:55
okay, what that means is if you look at release date, the release date is the same at the beginning of staging and at the end of staging but if you double code it means that there's a feature that the beginning of staging didn't have at the end of staging didn't have. Now if we so we could do a there's Okay, here's how we could do it if we would track release date. And what date was it updated?

Unknown Speaker  44:24
Well, it still doesn't exactly do it. Why did it

Matthias Miller  44:33
Josh was saying he doesn't like

Matthias Miller  44:43
handling double codes becomes the issue. How many times are you wanting to see version information on double codes?

Speaker 1  44:50
I mean, I guess in my thinking of adding the field and Tim, you could correct me if I'm wrong, but I was thinking that I was more concerned with the Just seeing the date that it was actually updated. And if we need to see version information, we can open the system and look at version information.

Unknown Speaker  45:14
Well, let's see. Subscriptions.

Speaker 2  45:19
Let me let me think about something. Right. Like for us, for us, non developers, the especially like, developers find support people it's most helpful for us to be able to see when did this literally go to the clients system? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  45:39
Basically.

Speaker 2  45:42
When yeah, sometimes that's to know whether or not it has been deployed. Sometimes they have a reference say we did your update on this date and then you had this team so I think for the client support testing side of things, the actual deploy date the date that it was added to this is most helpful for us. That's not right

Unknown Speaker  46:19
let me check something how do we handle Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  46:35
All right. So

Unknown Speaker  46:47
SMS helper

Matthias Miller  46:52
Why did we not use an X 30 list for this?

Unknown Speaker  47:14
Okay let's do this. Okay, but then I'm taking over Sure.

Matthias Miller  48:15
Okay, but then, but then here's the question, though. Yeah. It does not give you a definitive answer. You're wanting to use this to to know. Okay, as long as you were telling you, this is when z ACH or the Z ACH subdomain was last updated? I'm fine with that. And if you are manually inferring from that, is this change live or not? I'm good with that. If we want an automated automatic status that says yes, the client this has been deployed to the client. We're going to need some more complexity because we have some more detail.

Unknown Speaker  49:07
Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 2  49:13
I think we can we can go to the client system and click on the about most of the clients and we can see the last build date or whatever.

Speaker 2  49:30
This would be helpful for the zEC and once we don't have access to but I think the most helpful would be to literally be able to see the status of

Unknown Speaker  49:40
has this change been deployed. So in that case,

Speaker 2  49:51
what what is the complexity there? What are the pieces that are needed

Unknown Speaker  49:55
for that? Well,

Matthias Miller  49:59
then you need to know Okay, so what happens if you complete testing on a job or, you know, ready for testing, you deploy a ones, there's a bug fix, and they and so the code another change. Now it needs to no longer be deployed. So you need to know specifically,

Unknown Speaker  50:19
what

Matthias Miller  50:29
you can't just do it based off of the date, or what if they coded it you updated in the morning, they put it in the evening? If you're basing it off of date? Well, if it's the same date, then it's indeterminate, whether it was deployed or not. So if you want to definitively know was this deployed or not? I still think the only way to do it is you check to see if it's the same version.

Unknown Speaker  50:51
If it's well I don't if it's

Matthias Miller  50:54
it's the target.

Speaker 2  50:57
Though we don't have we don't have like a field on the PC or something to definitively say this was deployed on this

Matthias Miller  51:06
what we'd have to do well the problem is you might have a development revision you have to translate from development to staging revisions staging versions to determine whether it was the case so so you would have to say okay, let's say we limited is staging only.

Unknown Speaker  52:06
That's all we need to do so.

Matthias Miller  52:42
Let me see if we

Unknown Speaker  52:43
see ah lists so,

Speaker 1  52:51
sorry for thinking about things from different angles here but we have the testing on I'm thinking on change requests we have testing completed checkbox Once testing is completed then that changes live in the test system so long as are the test system and alive systems always in the same

Unknown Speaker  53:14
branch should be well

Matthias Miller  53:19
known well unless we're moving somebody to staging Yeah.

Speaker 1  53:25
I mean, it seems like so long as the testing system and the live system are in the same branch when testing completed as checked on a change requests and the last update is greater than that testing completed date then we could auto set delivered

Unknown Speaker  54:04
you seen the last update to the live system

Speaker 1  54:07
is the last update till if the last update to the live system date is greater than the testing completed date than we ought to be able to set delivered except for maybe some edge cases that

Unknown Speaker  54:18
I'm not even sure

Speaker 2  54:24
you're really educated is like where you update it the same day what you do the same day or, or greater.

Matthias Miller  54:32
Yeah, but then you have edge cases the other direction in which you may think you've deployed something when you didn't.

Speaker 2  54:43
Write you would have some cases where you ran an update on the live system in the morning and then you tested a job in the afternoon.

Matthias Miller  54:55
I'm doing I'm nervous about it. Okay. What's the consequences of it going wrong? client calls up. Why isn't this here? Well, you should have it. It's not in your system. Why is it in your system? Shows us being in your system?

Speaker 2  55:14
Yeah, then you have to you go and you look and see, okay, it's not in your system. Okay, we'll give you another update.

Matthias Miller  55:28
But we can cache the ending revision.

Speaker 3  55:32
This might make it simpler. This would make it simpler

Matthias Miller  55:37
on any given.

Matthias Miller  55:53
I feel like shouting, sorry for the caps

Unknown Speaker  56:08
Why would we

Matthias Miller  56:12
just makes the logic simpler.

Unknown Speaker  56:19
I have an idea.

Matthias Miller  56:26
On every job, we track the minimum staging revision, then we have a manual process says, I just deployed an update. And it gives you a report and then you say mark these as deployed, boom, done.

Matthias Miller  56:44
Again, okay, on every given job, we track the minimum staging revision. So, to get this full thing, it has to be at least at this point. And then after you run the update, you go check what the version number is you copied into an x 20x 30, run an import or a report, you drop it into report and it says, Oh, they just got these new change requests, or here the change requests that are below those minimum requirements, that's included and don't have a deployment date. Then you say okay, mark those as as deployed now, not automated but it gets us 80% of the way with probably 20% of the work

Speaker 2  57:35
are there specific situations that you will see is getting missed?

Matthias Miller  57:44
Yeah, if somebody codes a makes a change to a change request after it's been deployed, it wouldn't get unflagged

Unknown Speaker  57:56
don't happen very often.

Matthias Miller  57:59
That seems pretty rare. And it should involve a manual process. And also it seems like it'd be very useful to say I'm thinking about updating let me go put into the test system and now I have a report of all the change requests that are gonna hit the client

Unknown Speaker  58:14
that would be lovely.

Unknown Speaker  58:17
We spend a lot of time tracking goes down sometimes All right.

Matthias Miller  59:27
Okay, well I should drop off before too long. Oh, often on a scale from despise it. I can tolerate it. And I'm absolutely in love with it. What's your feedback?

Speaker 1  59:43
So to do what you're doing what you're saying, is that going to be a field on the subscription record or we're having to open the the live system to get that. Revision I'm still I still don't feel like I totally understand the workflow there.

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
I'm proposing you open the live system to get the number. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:00:08
I mean, that's great. So long as I have access to the live system, I need to get the number from.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
Okay. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:00:20
then in that case, we can still add the fields. For John to stamp in the numbers in the billing system. Go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:00:30
I still think I want my last my simple last updated field on the subscription record.

Matthias Miller  1:00:39
Okay, I think,

Speaker 1  1:00:40
yeah, I think we understand that, yeah, that doesn't always mean that change request data before that are deployed.

Matthias Miller  1:00:49
Okay, I have a variation of that, that I'd be willing to compromise on if it's not automated if it's a manual process. And we give you a similar report to say I want every every change request that is not deployed, but was tested prior to a specific date.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
Or what is the status? Here, let me pull up a change request here. So. Come on.

Matthias Miller  1:01:37
So if you could filter by tested date.

Matthias Miller  1:01:46
So then, then what you would do, we'd have a last updated date, date and subscription, super, super simple. Nick can make that change and slight coordination required with Josh. Or however, and it's not that terrible. And then we will give you the change request report, we will give you a way to filter by

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
by certain status as of a certain date. Was it tested before this date?

Matthias Miller  1:02:15
And then you would manually you would be responsible to manually go through and actually make sure that these are literally correct. And but but where you can easily find them?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
Your thoughts? Yeah. I mean, I think that's all right.

Speaker 1  1:03:01
Bye, I still am having just a little bit of a hard time totally visualizing everything, but it's right.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
Okay, um

Speaker 1  1:03:18
I mean, this whole, this whole change requests here was like, I would like to have a last updated feel in this subscription, our record, and oh, it would be cool if we could manually set the documented box. With that. I know, I feel like we're getting into way lots of complexity to try and do my Oh, it would be cool. If we could do that. You're right. When all I what I was after, is not that complicated.

Matthias Miller  1:03:49
Okay, I over emphasized the oh, it would be cool to and if you're happy with the last updated date on the subscription record. I'm happy with that. And all this rest of this, this discussion. This is basically what we need. And either I should do it, or Nick can do it. And I can coordinate with Josh. Just giving you the last updated dates, but I'm fine with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:26
I mean, Tim, does that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
sound right?

Speaker 2  1:04:33
And then from there, you would just be able to see which jobs you do come to the testing jobs report a change request report and see which ones were updated before and after that and and get your information with that.

Speaker 1  1:04:48
Yeah, I mean, the status is that we are already using like, if it's ready for deployment, and it's tested like like those those change request status have been working just fine to get a list of change requests that will be deployed. Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:05:09
I am going to I really do need to drop off here. So I think you guys know where I'm at on this piece of it and happy to circle back by email if

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
necessary. We're future. Appreciate it.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:33
Okay, yeah, go ahead with your saying feels a bit working. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:05:41
I'm just confused as to what all it is that we were trying to do with this date.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:49
I think the I think it was my pain here being able to automatically car is

Unknown Speaker  1:05:57
delivered timesaver to

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
so I think then that was

Speaker 3  1:06:05
adding the field sounds really simple. And then

Speaker 2  1:06:09
taking it from there to here sounds like it's mostly doable, but just could be not that simple. After all that complexity, complexity. And

Speaker 4  1:06:18
yeah, a simple date isn't sufficient to ensure that will actually correctly market as delivered.

Speaker 1  1:06:27
And I guess I'm fine with just continuing to manually mark those.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
Yeah, are we able on the

Speaker 3  1:06:45
no, we don't have a column for for that on the Change Requests report. So we still have to go in and edit them individually.

Speaker 2  1:06:58
But it's, I guess one thing, we could just do this as as a kind of a step by step process, if we get the last updated date first. And then we use that reference that for a while. And then if in a month or three months, we circle back to this and say, Hey, how's it working? There's something else that we can do to improve it by another

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
10% 20%, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
Where do we want to go ahead and dive into

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
working out all the logic to to be able to

Speaker 2  1:07:35
and automatically mark is deployed and all of that? Okay, so Matthias is saying this is what we need the rest of this stuff is

Unknown Speaker  1:08:08
extra.

Speaker 1  1:08:22
I guess I'm still Still I didn't totally understand what's wrong with just

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28
comparing the last update with

Speaker 1  1:08:36
if it's greater than testing completed, because, I mean, what's the point of testing if we don't know that our testing is going to work in the live system when we deploy it?

Speaker 1  1:08:51
I didn't quite understand what was wrong with that logic. Like if it's been tested, when we update the life system and not to deploy it, right. I mean, I guess that was my understanding of how things are supposed to work.

Speaker 4  1:09:08
Yeah. That sounds right. I feel like there's I feel like it surely can't be that simple. But I'm also not coming up with anything to any reason that it wouldn't be.

Speaker 2  1:09:25
Is that what it had to do somewhat with? If there are any, like revisions or to that job, after it's been employed, which again, percent of the time it should be or if a if a change is actually reverted. Those will be instances to rare instances, right because you got the

Speaker 4  1:09:59
river Due to changes and additional changes should never be made after a job has been marked testing complete and closed those should be made in the child job

Unknown Speaker  1:10:08
right. So if a whole

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
job will job is reverted

Unknown Speaker  1:10:15
Oh same thing

Speaker 4  1:10:21
applies if it's been if it's been tested you have you would have a child job sit there would be reverted all in caps than the job title and it would just be to revert the job yeah, but I mean the basic rule is never to make coding changes when a job has been marked. Testing complete

Unknown Speaker  1:10:43
Well

Speaker 2  1:11:01
I guess we could send that out. Well, maybe what I'll do is this job this team requested specifically for adding that field should

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
HC not core correct.

Speaker 2  1:11:23
It would be been done in HD, but I think it's being done as part of core I'm not quite sure how that works. Do you know MC better? Um,

Speaker 4  1:11:35
I think it should be labeled as core that's how it'll be. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that the change will initially be an HC but it's one of those kind of like change requests and cch that's it's NZ ch but it's a core change for our posting Sure,

Speaker 2  1:12:04
so if we do this if we did this one for this specific job and then maybe if we started another one for the

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
automatic automatically setting the delivered

Speaker 2  1:12:18
delivery box and pose that question and see if anybody can think of a reason why it doesn't work that's a related but different separate conversation anyway. So yeah, Austin, would you want to write write up that change request and mentioned that we discussed this on our call today and you want to just send it out to consideration where you can share?

Speaker 1  1:12:57
And I should send that out too? I always have a little bit of a hard time remembering who all this kind of stuff should be sent out to should that just be Matthias should I go to ls to Nick new and

Speaker 2  1:13:12
I think you just sent it to the CH at crafters. Because Ellison Nick been added to that one now. Sure, that'll be Ellis and Nick and Matthias and me and you and

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
then

Speaker 2  1:13:28
it'll think Ian's on there anymore. So that we get the need then. Okay. Sounds good. So I'll send out a few emails here of stuff we've talked about today. And

Unknown Speaker  1:13:58
we will

Speaker 2  1:13:59
plan to pick up some of these others

Unknown Speaker  1:14:03
this time than

Unknown Speaker  1:14:10
anything else from you guys where we wrap it up?

Speaker 1  1:14:15
I wanted to say something to you, Tim. But it doesn't have anything to do with Nick.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:21
Drop off. See you guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
Alright, thanks so

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
much.
