All right, so welcome to the walkthrough. I'm going to walk you through this when your time back tool. And so first thing you're going to do is you're going to use the same you're going to use your email to log in, hit Continue, and you'll get a six digit code. And so I'm going to go, go ahead and pull that up, and I'm going to copy it across and hit verify and continue. And then you're going to find you're going to see your if you got multiple times these, you'll see them here, but this one, it'll it'll be under, show up and close. If you want to name it differently, you can. And then we're going to break it down into different categories. And so what I found is that it's just helpful to use logical categories for whatever it is that you're doing. So, I mean, if you're a full time, like, if you're a dealer, you might have something around, you know, things that you do, like, lot maintenance, or if there's any kind of financial bookkeeping stuff like this, there's kind of like, all the admin stuff. If you're doing your own marketing, maybe that's the category that you have. But just looking for big buckets, if you're an owner, it might be, you know, certain types of leadership stuff, certain types, you know, whatever the big buckets are. And so in this case, let's just assume that we're spending some time on marketing. We're doing, it's, it's customer appointments, for lack of a better term, I don't know that this is perfect. We're not looking to get perfect, just looking to get some some things in here, and then we're also going to do, let's just do lot maintenance, slash admin. And so this is, again, just big buckets. Three to five is about, typically what I found work. Works really well. And I see here that I have a It's not working. Sweet, see what's
