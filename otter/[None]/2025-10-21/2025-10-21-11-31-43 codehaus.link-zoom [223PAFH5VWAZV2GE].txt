Yes, sir, hey, yes, sir,

Matthias Miller  43:12

Matthias Miller  43:17
What's your schedule like tomorrow? Could we? Could we do something tomorrow?

Unknown Speaker  43:22
Yes, yes,

Matthias Miller  43:25
I got, I don't know that will be, I've got time to cover quite

Unknown Speaker  43:33
Yeah, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  43:36
Okay, yep, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  43:40
What's what's good for you tomorrow? Yeah.

Speaker 1  43:51
So anything other than 1212, to two is my only not good

Matthias Miller  44:01
Eastern let's do your first thing with with

Unknown Speaker  44:07
730 Yep,

Matthias Miller  44:09
738 30, yeah, I will. I'll move this event. But you want George on there?

Speaker 1  44:18
Yeah, unless we have any time now, do we have a couple of minutes now?

Matthias Miller  44:22
I can I can hear, hang on. I got about 15 minutes.

Speaker 1  44:26
Okay, that's enough for the random thing, isn't it? I think, yeah, all right, I'll grab him real quick.

Unknown Speaker  44:40
You go over there.

Unknown Speaker  44:47
Hey, can you pop over? Awesome?

Speaker 1  44:53
Yeah, he's gonna join right now. Matt, quick question aside. Yeah, I need to add, and I need to add some hardware or fasteners. Let me get out of

Matthias Miller  45:07
there. Yeah, he had, George had mentioned something to that, to

Speaker 1  45:12
that extent, when, when he

Matthias Miller  45:15
had called in, when you weren't, when, you know, showed, see what was

Speaker 1  45:20
up. You mean now today? Yeah, today. Oh, sorry, did you I saw your text of sorry.

Matthias Miller  45:28
I meant, I meant duration, and that was not clear, so I apologize.

Speaker 1  45:33
Oh, I'm sorry, Matt. I thought gotcha. I thought you meant anytime in the next 60 minutes. Yeah, gotcha Sorry, man, yeah, no, we'll get done

Matthias Miller  45:44
here. That's so good. My bad. I

Speaker 2  45:50
Yeah, timing was, I thought that's what you meant. Okay, sorry. Well, okay, how do we how do I enter those or is that clear? I will, I will.

Matthias Miller  46:04
I need to push that report to the live system so we can keep going through stuff, and by the time we're done here, it should be good

Speaker 1  46:10
to go. Okay, sounds good. Well, then do you want to talk about your your random proposal, or is that, yeah, so that, does that mean we would use that 40 inch layer calculator to generate the cut list? Or you have another idea?

Matthias Miller  46:30
Yeah, that's right. But the question, the question, as far as taking a look at that, I can just push that those changes into the live system. I'm a little skittish if we're using that to generate live cut lists that I don't obviously I think I like to think I get everything right the first time, but I don't want to throw things sideways, so we would,

Speaker 3  46:57
yeah, well, is it easy to is it easy for you to do the mop. Just try it.

Unknown Speaker  47:02
Yeah, okay, yep, sounds good. So

Matthias Miller  47:04
I'll set that up, and then we can, we can then take a look at that in the morning.

Speaker 1  47:09
Okay, yep, he's, he's a gun right out of time here. I thought he got a 60 minute window to start, but I miss.

Matthias Miller  47:19
I misspoke. He missed. He didn't, he didn't catch it. Communication breakdown, how's that?

Unknown Speaker  47:25
Okay?

Matthias Miller  47:28
Was there anything else on the what was the other big piece? The Yeah, I think everything else is an email.

Speaker 1  47:43
Yeah, no, well, yeah, the random was my question. It's on. It has to do with rounding up the number, whether we round it up like, if we're saying a skid takes 1.2 then 10 skid takes 12, right?

Matthias Miller  48:06
So my plan was to round it up to a 10th the first time and then to a hole on the cut

Speaker 1  48:13
list. Perfect. That's exactly what we were talking about.

Matthias Miller  48:16
All right, good, because, yeah, I ran into that same question on

Speaker 1  48:21
on the splitter, like, when we, when we split lumber, like inch and a half by three and a half gets split into 11/16 if the job needs 11 pieces, and we're getting two out of one. And we also will that also round up. Those are next. Yeah, right.

Matthias Miller  48:41
Well, yeah, it will, it will,

Speaker 1  48:45
yeah, technically, we'll need five and a half to make 11. So if there's only one pallet or three pallets, we're going to end up with a half. Yep, but we want the guys, we want to round that up as well for the cut list. Yep. So for the item, for the item data, it could say five and a half. That's what it says. Now, perfect. But then for Yeah, sounds good. Matt,

Matthias Miller  49:15
okay, if you open the Configure fasteners, report the buttons there.

Speaker 1  49:18
Now, okay, did a man awesome? Did Amanda send you the? Oh, yes,

Matthias Miller  49:23
hang on. I need one thing from you. Can you grab the let me see if I still have it open, I'm going to need a confirmation code from you to log in.

Speaker 1  49:35
Well, let me see what we got here.

Matthias Miller  49:38
And I need to, I need to send you in a new one.

Unknown Speaker  49:42
Well, for that,

Matthias Miller  49:46
AWS,

Unknown Speaker  49:47
yeah, did she not send anything?

Matthias Miller  49:49
No, she did. She did. But Amazon's sending you a confirmation code, and I need that confirmation code to log in. It's a new email.

Unknown Speaker  49:59
Yeah. All right, did it come? It's gotta be right,

Speaker 2  50:03
yeah, verify your identity that top one, perfect two here. So top one, yep,

Matthias Miller  50:11
all right, see it, yep, check and checking. All right.

Unknown Speaker  50:21
All right, good, okay,

Matthias Miller  50:25
awesome. I got, I think I got what I need on that one.

Unknown Speaker  50:28
All right, nice. So configure fasteners. Oh, yeah, never mind. What am I doing? Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  50:39
New fastener. Bam, got it.

Speaker 1  50:43
Yep, all right, off the name score sort call name and cost. I think that's what we were doing so far.

Unknown Speaker  50:52
Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  50:57
okay, we're gonna say two dots, ballpark, $1 some of them are

Unknown Speaker  51:12
okay, no dollar signs,

Matthias Miller  51:17
no dollar signs.

Unknown Speaker  51:21
Shoot. One.

Speaker 1  51:24
So I'd be like, if it sends just one point, yeah,

Matthias Miller  51:29
1.03 is $1.03

Speaker 1  51:33
tight. Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  51:41
Got it

Speaker 1  51:44
doesn't like my spelling, all right, good deal. That's it, then, sweet man. Save that right now. And I want to add another one. Do I need to get out of that or refresh the?

Matthias Miller  51:57
Go, go back. Get out of that. Go back to where you were here.

Unknown Speaker  52:04
Let me go back here.

Matthias Miller  52:06
Go back to the fasteners list.

Speaker 1  52:07
Right? Where is it down here at the bottom? Are these done by order of entry? Maybe kind of looks like it.

Matthias Miller  52:17
It's by price, I think, yeah, or score. And then, no, it's sword order. Sword order.

Speaker 1  52:26
Yeah, we did that. We were on a money. Well, no, yeah, we were on,

Matthias Miller  52:30
yeah, we Yeah. We didn't make up our minds quite yet.

Speaker 1  52:35
Do we use hot glue for a lot of stuff? All right. Matt, so other than that, it's just that, that conversation about the pricing and I want, I want to remember, just jog my memory on, what was our discussion with Rick about

Matthias Miller  52:56
that? Okay, the the main thing with Rick, yeah. Sorry, thanks. Mike.

Unknown Speaker  53:02
Man. So 730 Yeah, you bet Thanks, George.

Speaker 1  53:06
730 tomorrow morning. We'll try to hammer out the rest of that, or check it out.

Matthias Miller  53:14
So the thing with the conversation for Rick is, are we good entering payroll numbers into silver loom, which would give us the grand total. And then the other thing would be the pricing spreadsheet, which

Speaker 1  53:33
so he would enter payroll totals into their

Matthias Miller  53:40
silver limb daily totals correct?

Speaker 1  53:43
Because currently he's he is planning to be taking he's going into silver limb. He's getting reports from silver limb right now, and he's using that report to mirror against his, his other spreadsheet, which is, I think it's excel at this point, and then, and then, around the palette, pricing, just, I don't have much memory of our remember we talked to him about, I just don't remember, like, the the the gist of the conversation, like, because he was willing to share the spreadsheet.

Matthias Miller  54:26
Yeah, sorry. We had decided then, I don't remember the full context. We decided then that we don't technically need it, so we went on without it. I do know that he had left it, that he'd be willing to share with it. Share it with us. I think my whole argument has and I think I think I've argued this probably half a dozen times, and various ways have been rebutted, so I might still be wrong, but I've made consistent arguments that if we don't know how to get to the pricing, then we don't know how to do the. Scoring, right,

Unknown Speaker  55:03
right, right, right, right, right.

Speaker 3  55:07
Well, it doesn't it lend its lend towards,

Speaker 1  55:15
well, I mean, it helps the incentive program too big time. If we I mean, well, I guess we can rely totally on pricing for for incentive purposes, but Right?

Matthias Miller  55:33
But you get a better sense of what actually like, you could, you could, D, you could, you could, what's the word, but? But you could make it fair based on different types of lumber and price, or, you know, I don't know what heat treating, and I don't know what it is. You could,

Speaker 1  55:52
again, yeah, because we already know that pricing is adjusted at times for, you know, like, if our salesman is, if the salesman is generating, the is generating, then he gets cut out of what are the prices? If it's a Remi, still making them for Remi, we're going to have a lower price point because they're handing the sales, we're just making their palette. Then it's a lower price point. If all these things, man like pressure from this guy? Well, it doesn't mean the value of the guys anyway. It doesn't mean the effort got easier, didn't get any easier. So, yeah, I would love to dial in that, that entire, entire conversation around the formula or a score. I I know, I know. Gosh, it's just a matter of hitting all those data points and then just adjusting the ones, you know, whatever I mean.

Matthias Miller  56:51
So if you if I can get that pricing before next week, then our conversation can be about we're scoring. If I don't, our conversation is going to be around pricing. Yeah. So it's all about, how far do you want to move the ball down

Unknown Speaker  57:04
the field? That sounds I want to be up there.

Matthias Miller  57:08
You want to move it down the field talking your language.

Speaker 1  57:12
There you go. Yeah. Oh, man, um, so you don't have to color the screen for me, because, anyway, the team I like is whatever, no, hilarious. Anyway, sorry, I'm thinking something's happening in my head. I'm John has couple small things. I said, John mate, I said, I told John and George, you're here next week. You're here Tuesday. We'll get together with they'll have time with you on Tuesday to ask any guys, any questions, or what ifs. Or could we do that, like write all that stuff down here? Oh, talk through that. Okay, it's 229 so I need to let you go. Pretty good. I'll respond like email with around that. I'll let you know there was Rick. Shouldn't be a problem. Okay? Far as next week, I don't have any other agenda. I mean, just kind of like, make smooth out everything we possibly can. And then there's definitely more conversation around tracking, sawing, and then, course, pricing and score. We don't know where we're headed there, so those, those pieces coming together is really, will be really sweet if there's, you know, tracking, sawing and assembly and scoring and pricing and all that sort of, and then incentive, all kind of comes together. Oh, my word that's, that's awesome. That'd be great. That's the That's a big goal. I'll say this, Matt, um, dad is, I just found out in this meeting, when I was talking to dad and buying time with you, was, um,

Speaker 4  59:18
asking for what? Yeah, I guess I bought time. I don't know if I paid for

Unknown Speaker  59:21
it. No, you didn't pay for it.

Speaker 1  59:26
Was around the decisions they're, they're making. I mean, not, but he's, he's, he's offering to start, he wants to sell his shares here in the near future, like he wants to, he's, he wants to sell his shares of the business, and he also wants to sell the land. So, yeah, that's very, very, very good, um, just to be able to, you know, so that, I mean, there's some other things that I went through my head and all that, just like, Okay. Okay, there's, there's things that I have to process, some things that never happened, that I was always hoping would happen one day. You know, if this and that it's it's fine, it's no problem. But I say that to say again, the goal, the goal, in my mind, with some other advice, is owner of the business share. What the business will be one entity, the land would be another entity. Ownership shares would mirror from one to the other, yep, yep,

Speaker 2  1:00:33
makes sense. Makes a lot of sense to me.

Speaker 1  1:00:37
So that's, that's the direction that that we want to go to so. All right, yep, good. All right, bud, man. All right, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
see ya yeah, you bet See ya yeah, yep, likewise.

Matthias Miller  1:00:58
Here, I'll let you hop off so can let the others, others on All right, bye.
