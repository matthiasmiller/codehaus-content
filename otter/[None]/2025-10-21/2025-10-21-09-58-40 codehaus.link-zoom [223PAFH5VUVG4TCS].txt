Matthias Miller  00:12
Hola Senor, how are you good? How are you

Unknown Speaker  00:17
doing? Well, guess what I have today. Tell me I it tell me be put my TV back in.

Speaker 1  00:27
I forgot I had one sitting up there in the closet from a former employee, and so

Speaker 2  00:33
it's like time to put it back to work, albeit, think I might put this one in the conference room and bring back my nice Vizio, because this high sense is it doesn't make a lot of high sense.

Matthias Miller  00:47
It's a little bit of low sense. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  00:50
here's the question,

Speaker 2  00:51
RTO contract templates and assist, can you run a report in there?

Unknown Speaker  00:59
No, but

Unknown Speaker  01:03
no. Okay,

Matthias Miller  01:05
so it stands now. But do you want to? Do you want to? But you could

Speaker 2  01:10
let me, let me explain what I'm trying to accomplish. So work has this wild requirement where they require you to give a breakdown sheet of what the EPO would be on every single month at the beginning of the contract, as part of the contract. So I'm

Matthias Miller  01:27
like, yeah, here, pull up, share your screen.

Unknown Speaker  01:32
Um, hold on a second. Let's see here. Let me grab

Matthias Miller  01:35
well, I guess the question is, is it worth them paying for this? I mean, it seems so.

Speaker 2  01:38
Okay, not necessarily. I if you wanted to do a, okay, somehow there's, I mean, obviously I can build a macro that's going to do the calculation. I'm not sure how exactly I'm going to do it to be dynamic based on the length of the contract, but I don't know what's your thoughts?

Matthias Miller  01:59
Well, okay, if you, if you, if you have a way to, if you have a way to calculate the value, which is the biggest thing. I mean, you could literally do something like this. So you could do list, substitute numeric, date, no numeric type list, one to 36 assign B, date

Unknown Speaker  02:26
equals. Can you make that dynamic one?

Matthias Miller  02:30
Okay, well, sure. It would

Speaker 2  02:32
be, what would be one to sort of least, sort of one to sort of least term of lease. It wouldn't it be you could, you could. Okay,

Matthias Miller  02:39
got it, yeah, I mean, yeah, date value, current item. Sorry, this is not it's month. Inc,

Matthias Miller  03:02
sorry, this is not it. V start, date, value, current value, current item, assign, EPO, value equals, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a

Speaker 2  03:23
Yeah, well, see this is what. This is where we're gonna have to make up calculations as you go along.

Matthias Miller  03:34
And then you could do a

Matthias Miller  03:46
like 14 plus format itself. I

Matthias Miller  03:55
don't know what this should really be, but don't you. Don't you like about me? I mean, don't list all the ways.

Matthias Miller  04:14
Oh, sure, okay, 15 is obviously way too

Matthias Miller  04:24
it should be more like 100 or like 8050,

Matthias Miller  04:34
70 and 70 for you know you could do, I mean, you can do something like this. You just need your EPO calculations in there, makes sense,

Speaker 2  04:55
and and that macro will dynamically create the.

Matthias Miller  05:01
The table, the table, you just need to plug in an actual EPO value instead of using random numbers. Okay.

Speaker 2  05:08
But how would you calculate a EPO value where New York, it has this fun EPO calculation, where it's it's cash price times times

Unknown Speaker  05:24
amount

Speaker 2  05:29
remaining divided. Oh, man, it's one of these fun New York ones. So like, how do you calculate? How do you do that at every single

Matthias Miller  05:37
Well,

Speaker 2  05:42
hang on. I have my where's my spreadsheet. I have this thing. Where is it? Oh, dear. What did I do with it?

Matthias Miller  05:47
I mean, it's something like V,

Speaker 2  05:57
okay, it's cash price, times, parentheses, B, 22 what's b t, contract balance divided by total monthly rent, no, sorry, total contract price. So contract balance divided by by, okay, this

Matthias Miller  06:14
is the contract, okay. So this is the right contract. Contract contract balance. So first month, at the end of the first month, it's 99 Yeah.

Speaker 2  06:32
I mean, you can plug all these hypothetical values and I can go pull them off of the contract, okay.

Matthias Miller  06:36
But then, okay. Then the how do you calculate the V the EPO is what

Speaker 2  06:42
it is, cash price times open, parentheses, contract balance or amount that's been paid so far.

Matthias Miller  06:51
Here, cash price is this, okay, so then the VPO is the cash price times open print

Unknown Speaker  07:02
contract. Balance,

Unknown Speaker  07:05
divided by

Unknown Speaker  07:08
divided by b, total contract. I

Matthias Miller  07:15
mean, it's, I don't get the different I don't know what I don't get what that's doing, but sure,

Speaker 2  07:20
trust me, it comes out to the exact same number as if you take, if you take total contract minus what amount paid times cash price, or, yeah, cash price percentage. It's the same thing, but it's New York's fancy way of being stupid.

Matthias Miller  07:39
I'm ending up with the contract balance itself. So the cash price the

Speaker 2  07:44
contract balance is going to be for every, every month that you go down, you add the monthly payment to become the new contract balance,

Matthias Miller  07:51
right? Yeah, so I'm doing, I'm subtracting 100 so that I do, I take the contract balance times 6.6 just to get the cash price for fun, whatever. So, so that, Oh, I get what I'm doing like that. Okay, I the math may be wrong, but the principle behind it probably isn't

Speaker 2  08:23
contract value minus monthly payment times, value current, okay, so now I understand how you're doing that. Okay, I understand what you're doing. Copy that and drop that to me,

Matthias Miller  08:33
done, done, done, done. And so then

Speaker 2  08:37
that we Okay, that would actually create the table.

Matthias Miller  08:41
And if you want headers, I mean, do you want, yeah, I mean, you can. Then if you really want to, you could do things like date and PPO, and you could do, you can, you can format this stuff.

Speaker 2  09:07
So here's, here's how I Okay, let me just, I'm going to share you a screenshot of what this thing's supposed to be looking like, and this will help you actually make this thing, because it has to be a little bit different, I think, than your what you're doing here, but it's not beyond your comprehension of of making it do exactly what we want. This is the fun little table that New York requires you to include in an RTO contract. I sent it to signal

Matthias Miller  09:42
after month one purchase price.

Matthias Miller  09:55
Well, I mean, okay, so I.

Matthias Miller  10:25
Okay, dude, just, oh, that's why start up there first. Shall we purchase price?

Matthias Miller  10:49
I just to make it easier, to keep it all in sync, and then we could do, could center these. Center this guy. You could even center this guy, if you want. We could be centered.

Speaker 1  11:16
You make sure the font type is, is size 10,

Speaker 2  11:22
all right, I don't know. Actually, don't worry about font size type right now, because our font type size, I have to go figure out exactly what.

Matthias Miller  11:29
Well, let's do this. What is required. Let's, let's respect it everywhere,

Unknown Speaker  11:40
though, Yeah, there you

Matthias Miller  11:46
go. V font size,

Matthias Miller  12:04
okay, let's just make sure this works. Look at that. That's a thing of beauty. I'll leave it at six for you. For your I don't think we could do Comic Sans, but let's we can do we can do courier. There we go. Oh, that's a thing of beauty, and that's gorgeous. All right, you happy. Calculations are completely bogus, so sure I gotta

Speaker 2  12:33
mention the calculations to make sure everything's is working right. But okay, so got it so I can pick this thing into a macro, and then that macro just sits in the inside of the contract,

Matthias Miller  12:46
yeah, you just, you know, like New York, RTO, EPO, like that, or whatever, EPO table or something.

Unknown Speaker  12:59
This is obnoxious, yep. All right, very good.

Matthias Miller  13:11
All right, let me go. Let me go make sure, I mean, you're not paying for it anyway, but let me go make them pay for that.

Matthias Miller  13:26
Sweet, you ready for mock ups?

Speaker 2  13:27
Ready for mock ups? Mock up of breakdown,

Matthias Miller  13:33
mock up of a breakdown, literally, the five minutes before the call, I got a message. Mock ups are done. Okay? We are looking at auto pay, so it'd be contracts.

Matthias Miller  13:53
Okay, frequency, by day of week, monthly by day of week, we have the date.

Speaker 2  13:57
Oh, God, so you're so there, so you are proposing that the preview would just be a table that generates right below it, rather than, I guess

Matthias Miller  14:09
that's what he was suggesting. I don't I don't know.

Speaker 2  14:13
I Okay, my preference would be something that I can print out as a PDF. So I would prefer to turn it into a report. Okay, that would be my preference, because what, what's going to end up happening is, you're going service reps are going to are going to create these, and then I expect they're going to like, Oh, let me just download the send this to you so you have it in an email so you know exactly what's going to happen. Mr. Customer, you

Matthias Miller  14:45
okay, but then we need a, this is actually more of a,

Matthias Miller  14:56
but you want to show all active. Payments, right? I mean, like it would be for everything on the contract, right? What do you mean? Could we just to clarify?

Speaker 1  15:22
Yeah, there you go, view all upcoming payments.

Matthias Miller  15:25
Click, dun, dun, dun, dun.

Speaker 2  15:30
And that would, that would generate based on what you have there. And can we respect? Can we automatically? Okay, here's, here's here's one thing that we haven't talked about in this thing, this whole auto, auto payment thing, needs to respect if this thing was, if this thing runs through the end of the contract, it needs to automatically close the contract and be done like it can't door. And the reporting on this needs to respect that as well. So in other words, if you have it, if you have no ending date, and it'll just run out into eternity, and but it like it can't run out, we can't run out into eternity.

Matthias Miller  16:16
Yeah, here, let's do this. Let's actually do this.

Matthias Miller  16:36
I like that. Okay

Speaker 2  16:41
and okay, here's something we haven't talked about yet, especially because we want the customer portal customers be able to pay off their account, and in some form or fashion, it would be really stinking cool that. Well, I don't know how we want to do this. I don't even know this is I'm speaking off the cuff. But if, if an auto pay pays out a customer's account, how are we going to send them their transfer of the what we call payoff letter, transfer of ownership, letter, whatever, like, somehow we need to have either reporting on that, or it needs to auto generate or like we need to hook it up to some lights in the office, but go Blinky. Blinky. When it when it happens, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  17:30
Well, this feels to me like, by the way, we ran into some of this when we were cleaning up the spec. This feels to me like an operational question. So, I mean, how do you want to do it? Do it? Do you want automated emails? I mean, I'm going to assume that you really what we should have is a report of zero balance open contract or $0 open contracts. Yeah, and that you want some kind of review process that says, I mean, we could automatically attach a note with with a an assignment requires follow up. This says this thing has been closed out, or this thing has a zero balance but has not been closed out.

Matthias Miller  18:10
That's an easy way to do it. It shows up on somebody's to do report,

Speaker 2  18:15
right? How would we define who gets that?

Matthias Miller  18:22
I um, I don't know.

Speaker 2  18:23
Would it be okay? No, no, let me rephrase the question. Let me rephrase the question. How would you how would that be done through a scheduled task? Yeah, so then you would be able to, you'd be able to set that as part of the scheduled task, right? Yes, you could. Okay. I like that idea.

Unknown Speaker  18:43
I like that idea a lot.

Matthias Miller  18:46
Okay, so is that a December thing or spring thing?

Speaker 2  19:17
Um, I think I want to say it's a spring thing, because, how hard would it be to go build some, some user reporting to just, you know, tell somebody to run it

Unknown Speaker  19:30
once a week, every week. Yeah,

Speaker 2  19:37
what would we report on in this regard? Closed like contract status.

Matthias Miller  19:45
Well, it's, it's really, except the report and the x 30 are, so I don't know, like, maybe we should report right to report that drives the x 30, but then you could almost just create the x 30. But basically, you report on on balance and status. Yes, and also, does it already have an open Task meeting follow up? And if it doesn't, or it looks to see

Speaker 2  20:11
if, I'm saying, if we, if we didn't, if we didn't generate like, if we did, what I'm saying is if we didn't build out the functionality to automatically, you know, to assign the note, etc, etc. It would just close the account. If we just build some, some, some user reporting around a closed accounts should be pretty simple,

Unknown Speaker  20:32
shouldn't it? Why do

Matthias Miller  20:33
you want to automatically close it?

Unknown Speaker  20:36
Because it's paid off. If you

Unknown Speaker  20:39
went, if your balance went to zero, it should automatically close.

Unknown Speaker  20:48
Or if you pay the EPO online, it should automatically close.

Matthias Miller  21:03
I mean, I mean, you could, if we, if we do the automatic closer, then we're writing an X 30 for automatic close as well, or something.

Speaker 2  21:17
Well, might as well attach a note at the same time as what you're saying is that, what is that? What I'm understanding you're saying,

Matthias Miller  21:29
I think so. Or, or maybe when you modify it, I mean, but then at that point the contract resolution, I mean, but do you know the contract?

Matthias Miller  21:42
I guess you can infer the contract resolution. If the balance it's zero, and you did an EPO and it has an EPO attached, then it sets it to EPO. Otherwise it's a payoff or payout. We

Speaker 2  21:59
don't have to handle this today. We do need to have a note for this that we need that we need to we need to think about some form or fashion of this needs to be done by December. If, if we can punt some of it into spring. From it, from an, from a automation standpoint, fine, if we, if, if we can come up with manual ways to do some of this by December. I'm also fine. So maybe it is, you know, daily reporting that you run on contracts that have reached their balance, or have EPOS, and you go set the statuses, I don't know, but it's, I mean,

Matthias Miller  22:33
we can have the contract auto close to the point that you that you close it. The question is, really, how does it, if we automatically do it? What's your How do you catch these, these things, to do a follow up,

Matthias Miller  22:51
like you did you? Do you? Do? You have require a specific the x 30 could require a specific task type. So you could have a task type for, for, you know, contract close, or transfer of ownership, and you make sure, then if there's none there, it creates one that's, I like that. Well, what do you think of that?

Speaker 2  23:17
The task that, that it would be generating would be the, the the

Unknown Speaker  23:24
template letter for contract close, or

Speaker 2  23:28
for the transfer of ownership. So, yeah, I mean, it's it. Well, we could you could you could go look for transfer ownership templates that were created today,

Unknown Speaker  23:36
report on that,

Unknown Speaker  23:40
and go, go print them out and send them out.

Matthias Miller  23:53
Okay, if a contract for any closed contract that does not have any tasks of the assigned type for the contract, create one and assign it to the assignee, or does not have one created on slash After the contract close date. Which one do you want?

Unknown Speaker  24:45
Why am I having a hard time understanding this does

Speaker 1  24:52
not have any tasks of the assigned type for the contract. Okay?

Matthias Miller  24:59
So. Let me, let me, let me. Walk it through verbally, verbally. On a contract, it reaches a zero balance. You hit save. We say, okay, hey, do you have an EPO on it? If so, the an EPO payment on it, then, then it's resolved as EPO. Otherwise it's, it's, it's resolved. It's payout, payout. All right, good. Done now it's closed gone. Now, next morning, the thing runs and it says, Here's a closed contract, but it doesn't have the transfer of owner, or the the notice of closure letter, or the transfer of contract letter, or anything like it doesn't have that note type attached to it. So I'm going to go create one and assign it to this person, because that's who gets it, because x, the scheduled test told me I need, I always, every contract needs a note of this type and this assignee. Now that's the simple version. Now, if you if somebody wants to use a different type of note, type that might be used before the contract is ended, like they just want to say a follow up task or something, I don't know. And where a task like that is going to exist before the contract is closed, we're going to look at it and say, Oh, we already have this task, and not realize that that was a completely different task. That's the

Speaker 2  26:21
so what your what, what your false positives, is a concern, right?

Matthias Miller  26:30
Unless we have a I don't really like this, but we could have a flag.

Speaker 2  26:46
Um, do we have a when there's a type, but when there's a template, does it replace the type? Or no?

Matthias Miller  27:07
It's tied to sets the type.

Speaker 2  27:11
So the question, but I guess the question then exists, though, if you, if you set the type without the template, we should probably just have some validation for that that says, hey, you're setting a use. You set this note as a transfer of, you know, a payoff letter. And there's no template like, Um, hello, stupid guy that was done.

Matthias Miller  27:38
Let's change this.

Speaker 2  27:55
Oh, there you go. Prompt for the template, not the type for any

Matthias Miller  27:58
close count. Does that have any tasks with a respective template, create one and assign it to the assignee, uh huh, and okay, then if somebody's dumb enough to create a payoff template before it's paid off, I guess you could say, if it doesn't have one, it doesn't have any tasks,

Speaker 2  28:16
that's a different problem. I don't think we need to necessarily worry about that, okay, if that, if that happens, okay.

Matthias Miller  28:27
So we could further require that the task,

Speaker 2  28:32
but that okay, but, but this logic, your your scheduled task, would come along the next morning, and it would say, it would it would say, Oh, here's, here's here's a, there's already one here, so then I don't need to create one and assign it, right? That's what would happen.

Matthias Miller  28:48
Now, if you we could have a check and still create one, if it was completed before contract close, just as a as a bulletproof

Speaker 2  29:00
Okay, I think we're good enough for December. What I think in the future, what we probably should have is is either inside, somehow, inside the same schedule task, or a different one that goes along and looks for that and sends out a, a, I don't know, maybe just signs a note to an admin that says, Hey, why is this exist? I don't know that this is going to be an issue, but it could be.

Matthias Miller  29:28
Well, couldn't you? I mean, we could also, very simply say, note, if one of these tasks were completed before the contract close date, create a new one, right? Unless you would

Speaker 2  29:44
just create a different, a different task, right? Create a, create a create a note that's create a note with the type of contract task, assign it to whoever the assignee and says, Why does such and such exist?

Unknown Speaker  30:01
That's that's probably the better way to do it.

Matthias Miller  30:24
Okay, so are you good with them? Obviously, we need to figure out how this, these automatic payments, get the reporting and all that. Are you good with them?

Speaker 2  30:37
Running with this. Okay, so let's walk through this so there's nothing in those drop downs, right? It just,

Matthias Miller  30:45
we're not showing it, but we could pull up the, let's, let's pull up the auto pay. So we have one monthly by we have one time we have, I think we should just go through each one actually, and,

Speaker 2  31:00
yeah, put a put all the ones there that would be in a drop down, so we can just make sure we see it

Matthias Miller  31:06
one time, weekly, monthly by day of week, and monthly by day of month. You know,

Matthias Miller  31:15
we're going to get fancy here, and we're Going to, actually,

Matthias Miller  31:22
I'm day of the moon. It

Unknown Speaker  31:42
don't you hate when you can't get things to line up.

Matthias Miller  31:48
Well, unless it's something that my name is behind, I usually don't care. But okay, so this one needs a Okay, weekly, by day of month, so then we do starting date,

Matthias Miller  32:12
Every number of months, continue until all this stuff, box,

Matthias Miller  32:25
yes, box inbox.

Speaker 2  32:28
So the the starting date in this case would be monthly, by day of month is the 1023 would be the date. How are we going to prevent from someone from saying 1031

Matthias Miller  32:42
well, if you do 1031 then it adjusts to 932, 28 it goes to the end of month.

Speaker 2  33:00
Okay, reporting will help with understanding that, albeit,

Matthias Miller  33:08
we could add a note,

Speaker 2  33:10
why wouldn't? But I thought we also had, like, last, last day of the like, didn't we have some other

Matthias Miller  33:15
we had the last we had talked about?

Speaker 2  33:20
Yeah, but by first Thursday got it. But why wouldn't? Why would we do? Why wouldn't you use that? Okay, never mind. I know what? But okay, yeah, I mean, I think this is fine. When you run reporting, that's gonna, that's gonna, you know, someone's gonna say, well, that that didn't work. That's not gonna work. Well, yeah, well, you should have ran the reporting and looked what. And looked what

Unknown Speaker  33:43
your schedule was going

Matthias Miller  33:45
to do, right? But that's, I mean, like, to me, that's like, what do you want to do every other

Speaker 2  33:54
No, I think, I think you're right. I do think we need to write some, some explanation around, around this in the in the documentation, at some point that says, hey, if you set by day of month, and you set it 1031 then hey, it's gonna, it's gonna go, you know, the equivalent of what that would be in a month That doesn't have that date,

Unknown Speaker  34:17
something like that. Probably, okay.

Speaker 2  34:37
Okay, and every number of months needs to be a whole number. You can't put a fraction in correct. You couldn't put,

Unknown Speaker  34:47
yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  34:49
that would be funny

Matthias Miller  34:54
of odds months. See,

Speaker 2  34:58
this is why we do mock. Because it generates fun questions.

Matthias Miller  35:02
So the weekly you have a weekday like this. So the one question is, had we taught how we set this? Why wouldn't one time just use the starting date?

Speaker 2  35:19
Yeah. So the date, the date thing could go away, that that column could go away,

Matthias Miller  35:26
correct? Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

Unknown Speaker  35:28
Um, here's my other question, will the RG auto filter based on active

Matthias Miller  35:34
sort it will. That's

Unknown Speaker  35:36
what I meant. That's what I meant to say. What did I say? Auto Filter. Okay, auto sort based on active, yes,

Matthias Miller  35:48
I think active start date and frequency, or something like start date plus, let's do end date plus, something like that.

Matthias Miller  36:05
So then weekly repeat every number of weeks, continue until,

Speaker 2  36:12
so the repeat, monthly, by day of so we okay, you do have that one? Okay, perfect. I see what you're doing now

Matthias Miller  36:21
is active. There you go. Ending date is implicit, not relevant.

Matthias Miller  36:38
Let's do like some weird

Speaker 2  36:43
and this thing would, this thing could live under some sort of, like, automatic payment schedules button on the contract record that you click and then it opens this, I don't know. Does it need to be right there? Does it?

Matthias Miller  36:56
Yeah? Like, what if we did something like, I'm not sure what he's doing with this fancy gray background, but it sure looks cool.

Matthias Miller  37:12
But what if you had view all upcoming payments on the main like or next automatic payment

Unknown Speaker  37:22
right below the button or something.

Matthias Miller  37:25
Yeah, I'm not sure how to Okay, so you have something like this, where you have four automatic, for active act number of Active automatic payment payment schedules for next automatic payment date.

Matthias Miller  38:10
Well, here we go again.

Unknown Speaker  38:16
Figuring out his formatting is fun, isn't it?

Matthias Miller  38:19
It is all right, so then we have this one, I guess if we should technically, do you want to? Do you want to merge them all together? What do you mean? Like, if you have four payments on the same we should, if you have two payments that land on the same day, we should merge them,

Speaker 2  38:41
sure, but I'm not sure why you would ever do but yes,

Speaker 1  38:44
well, yeah, you're correct.

Speaker 2  38:49
So that would be on the contract page somewhere. But then if you click the automatic schedules button, then you would get this, this page here,

Matthias Miller  38:57
yeah, then it's like a The other thing

Speaker 2  39:00
you know, the other thing you could do, you could put the view all upcoming payments link URL out there with that on the on the contract page, and then, but in it, once you open this up, just do a whole like breakdown right here.

Matthias Miller  39:17
You mean, show this on on there,

Speaker 2  39:19
what he was going for the preview automatic payments thing. Cool. So if you're on the contract, you can click, click the thingy and and it pops up in the report. And he's like, oh, okay, great. I see what's going on here. Okay, so this

Unknown Speaker  39:43
is.

Speaker 1  40:13
I know you don't realize this, but do you know how much better this is than what RTO Pro has or RTO smart has?

Speaker 2  40:20
OMG. This is like so far beyond what, what any of these guys have. It's like, it feels like a whole, like automatic payment module, like fancy, get creative. Be flexible, right?

Matthias Miller  40:40
You okay, so, all right, I think we're good, so we should probably put here main screen. See, mock ups, child Details screen.

Unknown Speaker  41:08
See mock ups.

Matthias Miller  41:20
Or something like that.

Speaker 2  41:34
And then we talked, did we talk about in payment history denoting Whether it was auto pay or not.

Matthias Miller  41:45
Yeah, disallow a

Unknown Speaker  42:08
um,

Speaker 2  42:14
I do have, actually, I think we should add one more thing, just for the sake of of visibility, yeah, go back to the go back to the very ending column in the RG should be a simple note field where you can leave a little note that says, deactivate it because of whatever. Or you could leave a little note there.

Speaker 2  42:55
It's not, it's not RTF, it's just simple. Okay, now you're gonna just get fancy, aren't you?

Speaker 1  43:06
Yeah, look at you. Look at that. Make because it's a virtual RG, you can do fun things like that. It's

Matthias Miller  43:12
just well as it doesn't have anything to do with, I mean, it's a you do that with any RG,

Unknown Speaker  43:17
yeah, that's, that's the right thing to do.

Matthias Miller  43:20
Look at that. That's a thing of beauty. Man, should, should the, should

Speaker 2  43:24
the payment method not be up in the in the RG as

Matthias Miller  43:27
well? It's gonna be super wide. But probably, I mean, that's, that's fine, that's fine. It would make sense, though, conceptually, to put it up in here.

Unknown Speaker  43:37
Yeah. But you're right. It's going to get super wide.

Speaker 2  43:54
We also need a way to add payment methods here. In other words, if there's not a credit card token on file that you can add it or an ACH I

Matthias Miller  44:32
it was probably

Speaker 2  44:33
repeat every number of weeks. If we can get better on that wording, we can shrink that column a bit.

Matthias Miller  44:43
But we could also just change the heading height.

Unknown Speaker  44:47
That's true too,

Speaker 2  44:49
because, but those two columns right there and the next one right beside it, those could skinny up a lot.

Matthias Miller  44:57
So let's try a. Well, let's do here, and we're

Matthias Miller  45:18
just going to temporarily size these down.

Matthias Miller  45:36
Do you want something like wks? Here's this for your old man eyes.

Unknown Speaker  45:41
Hey, I got big TV.

Matthias Miller  45:47
Just because you have a big TV doesn't mean I can't give you hash just

Unknown Speaker  45:52
because I'm big TV doesn't doesn't mean you can't annoy me, right?

Matthias Miller  45:55
Yeah, exactly. Please. I don't know where my There we go. Oh, I get man, that'll give you some space. Continue until first, last active, boom, ready to go build, and we can look at it tomorrow. Do what ready to go build, we can look at it tomorrow. Hallelujah. All right. Your Kansas notes added to mock up, to mock up and spec

Speaker 1  46:46
All right, that's Exciting. That thing is. That thing is so exciting. I

Speaker 2  47:14
hmm, the payment method. Okay, we're gonna be this if we're gonna have, if we're gonna on on the payment method type of thing. It should reflect the drop down. Should reflect, you know, like the last four digits of the cards that they may have on file, right?

Matthias Miller  47:28
Yeah. It is something like that. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  47:38
Yeah, yeah. Sweet.

Matthias Miller  47:42
Okay, so for the demo, we had hidden gain or loss on sale of asset. Do you care about that at all? I

Speaker 2  48:08
I don't care about it. I don't know. Like this is one of those things where if I don't care about it, that doesn't mean that other people won't care about it. And I don't like if a client wanted to set that methodology up, how would they go about doing so?

Matthias Miller  48:32
Well. I mean, we just need to be able to say something gain or loss based on contract resolution type, probably like you could specify the gain or loss account based on the resolution.

Speaker 2  48:43
And would that be, would that be part of accounting impact setup? Yes. And so if you didn't set that up, then it follows, it disregards that whole fun stuff.

Matthias Miller  48:55
Well, I mean, you have to set up something for gain or loss. You

Matthias Miller  49:08
What are you going to do?

Speaker 2  49:12
Sorry, I'm scratch scratching back through my memory on our last conversations about this, and I don't I'm not recalling. Can.

Matthias Miller  49:22
Okay? So we had most of you

Speaker 2  49:25
were okay, my memory recalls that you had proposed a more simplistic version versus what some of these guys were doing.

Matthias Miller  49:32
Yeah, well, some of these guys are breaking down gain or loss based on any number of factors, which I think could conceivably make sense. I mean, if you Well, I I don't even know, like, let's skip to building. How do you want to gain or loss on sale of asset is predominantly used only to account for various rounding errors. Dollars through the EPO side of things, and so I suspect there are some people who want to say, We don't care about gain or loss. We just want to, we just want to depreciation expense or something to get it to tie out.

Speaker 2  50:14
Okay, it's your question. In regards to December or Paducah, or

Matthias Miller  50:20
I'm Paducah, is the only question right now, I don't even

Speaker 2  50:25
think that's a question. We don't even worry about that for the for this moment, it if that, if this is like, if they if, if Jay says, Look, this is really important. We handled a gain and loss and blah, blah, blah, and then we're okay, fine. Noted, we will have it, you know, by the time we go live in the spring.

Matthias Miller  50:40
Okay, that's, that's the only question I really care about.

Speaker 2  50:46
What's happening right now on the, on the balance sheet of the income statement, I guess it would be the balance

Matthias Miller  50:52
sheet. We zeroed it, okay, what's happening right now? It's, it's showing up in the income statement based on, um,

Matthias Miller  51:09
by the way, do you care whether we start at two or 230 start what? Start back up again at two or 230

Speaker 1  51:18
No, I don't care. Guess what they Well, I think they are having, are they? I don't remember. We should probably know that wait

Matthias Miller  51:30
contracts. Let's go

Speaker 2  51:35
wait our time today for this, for this time block. Okay, we're almost out of okay. So yeah, we're

Unknown Speaker  51:39
almost at a time, okay?

Speaker 2  51:42
But no two or 230 I do not care. The only thing I need to be done by is four o'clock, okay?

Matthias Miller  51:47
Well, I might, I might have to play by ear. I've got another client buying for my time, and I want to give them some love and attention. And so if it's all the same to you,

Unknown Speaker  51:56
we don't do well, George, on

Speaker 1  51:58
my, on my I did not. That is the wrong

Matthias Miller  52:02
never serve calendar invites when you're on the phone with you somebody else.

Unknown Speaker  52:09
I don't know who Merv and George are, but they don't have anything to do with me. No, they don't.

Matthias Miller  52:16
They're wanting some love and attention. They're absolutely sorry. That's That was hilarious. This is why I don't anyway,

Unknown Speaker  52:23
no, I don't care whether we started two or 230

Matthias Miller  52:27
Okay, let me, let's, let's, I'll text you and see that. See what we need. So the gain or loss amount. How are we calculating the gain or loss amount? The gain or loss amount is, what is the cash portion paid over the life of the contract, minus the EPO amount. So practically speaking, it only comes out to a rounding error based on PDS accounting that he shared with us,

Speaker 2  52:57
and that's fine for right now. Okay.

Matthias Miller  53:09
Good. So, okay, just just because I'm paranoid about this for the demo, I have handed off the actual accounting impact implementation. So I've set up the settings, and we're going to take the user reports, and we're going to standardize them, and all that's basically good to go. And you can actually see the settings here, but all this stuff is configured. Okay? But see

Unknown Speaker  53:42
that just looks so cool.

Matthias Miller  53:46
And then, and then the the other thing, so auto pay. It's getting coded. It's off to be coded. Nick is going to do the date calculations. And I mean, probably all of it, it might be ready for us to look at tomorrow, but for sure, Thursday. Okay, so that then gets us to the that gets that, that gets us to, I mean, that gets our demo critical stuff done, right?

Speaker 2  54:22
Um, where was sales tax in this in this conversation, did we? Did sales tax? Is that tax wasn't in this conversation? Was it?

Matthias Miller  54:30
You had not said that? It is. But we're close enough that, and I don't know what their capacity is like, but we're probably close enough we could beat it over to them.

Speaker 2  54:39
Well, okay, I'm assuming that's what we're going to do this afternoon. At two or 230 we're going to, we're going to hammer around sales tax.

Matthias Miller  54:47
Yeah, we're very close to done, I think. But we might actually want to pull in Seth, if he's what happens to be available.

Speaker 2  54:56
All right, so then, if I if we can. Dropped seven minutes early from one o'clock, so like a cup of coffee before the board call. That'd be great. Awesome. Then two or you're gonna, you're gonna, we're playing my ear,

Matthias Miller  55:10
for sure, 230 but I'll message, oh, I'll message

Speaker 2  55:13
you. All right. Well, enjoy your enjoy your George and Merv. Thank you,

Unknown Speaker  55:19
sir. All right.
