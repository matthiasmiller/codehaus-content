Speaker 1  00:03
Did not turn my video on. Sometimes it seems like it does by default. Thing is

Unknown Speaker  00:08
grumpy. It's grumpy.

Matthias Miller  00:10
It's grumpy. So very, very grumpy.

Unknown Speaker  00:15
Somebody educate me on the thing I just dropped in the chat. Mom.

Matthias Miller  00:23
Starts at 12 increments by eight and stops at 60. Just do it times 12.

Unknown Speaker  00:30
So start at

Matthias Miller  00:36
okay, like do this. I need a way to how do I do that?

Unknown Speaker  00:55
But numeric pipeless is only mins and maxes.

Matthias Miller  01:08
So it's something like this. I mean, why would you do something like this?

Speaker 2  01:16
But is it? Does that go in the min or the max? So you do a one through

Matthias Miller  01:21
one through seven,

Unknown Speaker  01:25
like this.

Matthias Miller  01:28
Wait for it. Stuff is going to beat me to it, isn't he?

Speaker 1  01:32
Well, I was working on that. I stopped. Should have kept going. I think it would have beat you. I think you probably would have substitute.

Unknown Speaker  01:41
So what's what's the list? Substitute, help me understand the list. Substitute

Matthias Miller  01:45
takes a pipe list, and for each item, substitutes it with something else. Yeah, there you go. Value current items.

Unknown Speaker  01:55
I have so much to learn.

Speaker 1  02:00
It makes a difference if you've done this full time for a while.

Unknown Speaker  02:03
Well, I haven't done this full time. I

Unknown Speaker  02:06
know that's what I'm saying.

Unknown Speaker  02:08
There you go. There it is.

Unknown Speaker  02:11
Well, here just for, just for kicks

Speaker 3  02:13
and giggles. I'm gonna, I'm gonna show you. I'm attempting to, to help, to help Aaron solve some of this, because this just makes my makes me want to cry. How about this? There is actually try, try that on for size.

Matthias Miller  02:33
If, well, you would do a if building equals 12, you would do a modulus. If, if.

Speaker 3  02:44
Okay, so this, this actually sits in the bill of materials, rules things. It's there is a field setting for a 10 wide building. Okay, okay, I'm curious. Seth, if you were to, or one of you were to rewrite this thing, send it back to me. I want to see how you would write this.

Unknown Speaker  02:59
It's gonna take me a hot minute to figure out what it's doing.

Speaker 4  03:06
That's what I was trying to figure out. And then I got halfway through, and I'm like, Okay, first,

Speaker 1  03:09
so if it has over, it hangs, then it's 48 plus 19. Otherwise it's 13 times two divided by 12.

Speaker 3  03:18
I don't understand the math. I don't know what he's doing with the math. The math just makes it's Amish math. But some like, that long of an or statement just made my head want to hurt. And like, can we please do an assign for the overhangs once so we can query that once and not twice?

Matthias Miller  03:34
Well, surely we could do something like an in range. Or, I like, what about a 13 foot building? Or what about a 61 foot building? Like, what's the point? Like, what's the point? Like, that's a little bit

Speaker 3  03:43
worse, okay, but no, but that's inside of it. It's, it's, it's incrementing on eight for, for,

Unknown Speaker  03:49
I don't it's all American buildings. If it, if it's a has that all American tag, then you do the building length plus 16 or 32 divided

Unknown Speaker  04:05
by, yeah,

Speaker 3  04:07
I think I suggest Seth, you wrap your head around some of this, because Mark's already talked about having you start to help Aaron figure some of this stuff out. I

Speaker 1  04:14
think, no, I think this is a nick helps Aaron figure this out. Nick literally goes a mile from their fist like every month, because his girlfriend is from right around there.

Matthias Miller  04:26
Yeah, they totally should bring him in for a day or two. Totally absolutely, yeah, we completely should, yeah, I agree completely

Unknown Speaker  04:33
Absolutely, that's a

Unknown Speaker  04:36
great idea have, because Nick would

Matthias Miller  04:38
enjoy it. Oh, he'd get it. That'd be way more fun than working remotely. There no kidding,

Speaker 1  04:43
and it would be great for them, and he'll teach them better than I would anyway, I'll just fix it for them. Nick will make so that they can do it

Speaker 3  04:50
exactly. The last time I looked at one of these rules, I sent him back like he had a ton of nested IF statements. Instead of doing just an ifs, i. Um, string, yeah. And I'm like, why aren't you using the IFS function? He's like, because I didn't know it existed. Okay, it

Unknown Speaker  05:06
exists.

Matthias Miller  05:09
Like, there's this thing. I mean, I think that's pretty close to what

Unknown Speaker  05:14
the Yeah, extra feet, if I

Matthias Miller  05:17
don't know if this is okay. Here, use Pascal Pascal style comments, please.

Matthias Miller  05:40
I, you know it's something closer to that.

Unknown Speaker  05:55
Okay, I'm curious if this works.

Unknown Speaker  06:00
Okay, stop it. Okay.

Speaker 1  06:02
I just want to, like, where are these random numbers actually coming from? Like, 32 divided by 12. What does that mean?

Unknown Speaker  06:11
Invalid trailing. Okay, okay, fine.

Speaker 1  06:14
There's it's just remove the very last of Michael, and you should be good. Yeah.

Speaker 3  06:19
But it's why is okay. If mod building length minus

Matthias Miller  06:24
12, that should be modulus. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:29
there we go. Yeah, there you go.

Matthias Miller  06:33
And then you could run it on all,

Speaker 4  06:35
I look really smart. I'm gonna send this to here.

Matthias Miller  06:39
Do This You can get even smarter. Just do a quick, quick sanity check. Where go take his old one. I

Matthias Miller  07:05
It's called the regression test. Boom, it comes out the same.

Speaker 3  07:09
Yeah, it does. Because I haven't dropped I have his sitting on a building expression evaluator to see if you were coming out the same. It does.

Unknown Speaker  07:17
This is gonna, no,

Matthias Miller  07:19
I would, I would, I would fix the variable names, yeah,

Speaker 1  07:23
please, yeah, sure. But anyway, be us, all American. Be us. The

Matthias Miller  07:33
extra feet. I love we how we have V A a gunaholic gas

Speaker 4  07:38
overhangs, V gas over things, V gas overhangs. V gas overhangs. This the assigns should not be in Dutch.

Speaker 1  07:51
They shouldn't, huh? I mean, it's the code, essentially, is shouldn't the assigns be too? I guess it isn't anymore.

Unknown Speaker  07:58
It's called contextualization, exactly. If you use Dutch logic, you gotta use Dutch, Dutch variable names,

Matthias Miller  08:13
rocking.

Unknown Speaker  08:15
I gotta move

Matthias Miller  08:20
the reminds me you're going to move this guy,

Unknown Speaker  08:33
randoms.

Matthias Miller  08:37
You gotta love being able to create an event they call it randoms nice. We having a random call tomorrow. Nice. It's not random. Oh, I couldn't hear them, but

Unknown Speaker  08:53
I could hear you all talking about them.

Speaker 3  08:55
Yeah. Well, okay, all right, let's get to work. Enough, enough of of Aaron's fun.

Matthias Miller  09:02
So the real question is, does it does? Does is Mark paying for that conversation too? Are you doing that other goodness of your heart?

Unknown Speaker  09:09
I'll do that. That's out of the goodness.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
It's fine. Okay, um,

Speaker 3  09:15
I am gonna, I'm gonna suggest that he that they pay for Nick to come out for a day or

Matthias Miller  09:19
so. Please, do make it. You're actually here's the real deal. If you want to make next day, you say you cover his plane tickets to show up plane tickets in time, and he will be he will bend over backwards. And, I mean, I'm reading between the lines, but I'm pretty sure he'd be pretty, pretty tickled with that arrangement.

Speaker 1  09:37
He's already leaving. It's next he's buying out next friday. I think he's gonna be there a week.

Unknown Speaker  09:45
Where is he going?

Unknown Speaker  09:47
His girlfriend, which is Ohio. That's why I said, like, come on.

Unknown Speaker  09:59
Oh. Do you have a

Speaker 1  10:01
Yeah, I think he's there. Nick, you're there the third to the seventh. You're there the week of November, three to seven. I am, I am. He's there the whole week about that November, 3 to seven. So it'll be a little while after that, though, until he's back out, because she's coming here over Christmas. But gotcha get

Speaker 3  10:22
his, get his, his dating trip paid for. I mean, this is that is tantamount to winning the lottery,

Unknown Speaker  10:29
I would say. So

Matthias Miller  10:33
I had that happen once, but that was my father in law paying for for gas for an eight mile trip.

Unknown Speaker  10:37
So this is different. All right, eight mile trip.

Matthias Miller  10:43
I mean, sorry, eight hour.

Speaker 4  10:48
He was poor as a church mouse. He needed to lose your 73 cents.

Speaker 5  10:55
Take it and be like, come off my take, please. All right, so, sales tax

Matthias Miller  11:03
focus, guys, focus. We're going to use a shared tax jar, API key for everybody, use a database trigger, boom, and then respect rate limiter status codes with retries.

Speaker 1  11:18
And then are doing texture. We are doing tax jar. Okay, I thought official. Okay, last I heard that we weren't sure because of how pricey they are. Or is that something else?

Matthias Miller  11:30
Dwayne has problems with decimal points, but now he's happy. Okay. No, no, it's not that, but go ahead. I mean, we it was just a misunderstanding of how pricing is, but it's actually sane, and the plan to avoid price Enos is to cash it on the contact I mean, this doesn't really help that much, but you can cash it on the contact record, so you only pay once per calendar month, per address and and so that way, if you encourage fee and in the month you don't. I mean, it's just still like eliminating only, you know, one to 10% at most of pings. But things are also pings are also ping is a 10th of a of an order. And so pinks are actually pretty dirt cheap. Like we could be running 2000 contracts at, like, what do we say? 100 bucks a month or something ish, okay, so at that point, if somebody's running 2000 contracts a month, I think, I don't know, we'll, we'll figure out a way to either whatever.

Unknown Speaker  12:27
But it's not, I mean, it's, yeah, I mean it's, but it's like

Speaker 3  12:32
for, I mean, it wasn't, I don't know what exactly was 30 or 40 or 50 bucks. I don't know for it to get to that level of ping.

Unknown Speaker  12:40
So it's not, it's not terrible.

Speaker 3  12:46
It what I'm going to follow the same plan that RTO smart is, is that we're going to pay for we're going to include the ping costs, we're going to include the tax jar, but address validation costs into the price of the software. If you want to go, if you want to pay your sales tax through that, then you're going to have to pay for your own account. That tax jar

Unknown Speaker  13:05
does that, which is just, that's where

Speaker 3  13:06
you get into the orders conversation. Because of every time you pay a sales tax, one of those is considered an order. And you get a you get a certain amount of order, so it gets it gets infinitely more expensive when you start to pay your sales

Matthias Miller  13:19
tax through it's 10, 10x as expensive, yeah. Okay, so, so we're planning to have a sales tax filing frequency list, very similar to to assist. Yeah, exactly. Surprise why you're here, sales tax filing frequency and filing period start month like we do contact record, have this, have an update rate from tax jar check box, which would be auto set anytime the address changes. Have a read only RG of the effective date and the I think we should probably have, if you address, yeah, we should have the ad

Unknown Speaker  14:03
the business. Okay?

Matthias Miller  14:07
State, Zip, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  14:11
We assume we're not having Canadian we're not playing potentials.

Matthias Miller  14:17
Okay? I've talked to a couple of Canadian shed companies in my life, but I don't know that we're planning to, we want to support country.

Speaker 1  14:25
Just thinking, are like, Are there RTO, places that are in New York that would like, they're close to Canada, they actually sell to Canada,

Speaker 2  14:32
not it's a good point. There are,

Speaker 3  14:37
I don't, I don't. I have never explored into what are the Canadian laws around RTO,

Speaker 1  14:44
so that would be its whole, I mean, a December release. It seems pretty sane to think about just

Matthias Miller  14:52
Yeah. We can always Yeah, yep.

Unknown Speaker  14:56
Should we add a note somewhere? Not. Is that

Matthias Miller  15:02
long term?

Unknown Speaker  15:04
Oh, I would be really,

Unknown Speaker  15:05
really curious. What are the rental laws in Mexico and Canada?

Speaker 1  15:10
Then you'll have better luck in Mexico than Canada, than Mexico. Mexico, that you

Speaker 3  15:16
have a customer across the border in Mexico, if you're in Texas,

Matthias Miller  15:21
well, you have plenty of manpower for retrievals down there. Are

Speaker 1  15:31
you thinking like an Amish style retrieval where you like, pick up the barn, walk away with it.

Matthias Miller  15:38
I'm thinking more like I'm thinking more like the Texas that kind of that kind of

Speaker 1  15:44
retrieval, I gotcha. No, I was pictured straight up manpower, not like manpower. With that was that like

Unknown Speaker  15:53
firepower, except I

Speaker 5  16:01
don't think they use peace dots. I don't think it's peace is the right word.

Matthias Miller  16:09
We have an X 30 then that updates tax rates for all contacts with active contracts, and we will schedule it for the first of the month. So basically, we'll preemptively ping tax jar. It could actually be a actually. I like this even better. Daily X 30 to ping all contacts with active contracts if they do not have a cashed effective date in the current calendar month, sure, and then we have the contract record which we have a button to update rates from tax jar, which updates the contact on the events? RG, I think we need to store for each event, the state, the state rate the County, the county rate the city, the city rate, and the other and the other rate, yeah, probably an expression for combined rate, and then auto populate based on any cash rates.

Speaker 1  17:15
Do we care if this RG is getting super, super clogged up? I mean, people aren't really digging here. We I was thinking we could theoretically not show them on detail have, like, energy or something,

Matthias Miller  17:28
but maybe we don't care. We've already said it's admin only

Speaker 1  17:36
throw them at the end. I think we put the combined rate first and then all the other rates. Yeah, I like that. Then you can say, Oh, it's a we literally have the rates stored right now. We don't have it broken down, but we have the total one stored, I think. So that needs to change away from a total rate

Matthias Miller  17:56
well, or maybe we need it to be a total rate and we just stomp in the sum.

Speaker 5  18:03
Right. No. Taxation is going

Unknown Speaker  18:08
to work. Where do you get that?

Matthias Miller  18:13
Well, if it's included, doesn't even matter. Dwayne like, are we even going to have to handle it if you're throwing in the price? Who cares? Why would you be so dumb as to turn away free tax, sales tax, family,

Speaker 3  18:27
I'm sorry i You were thinking about our G's and I zoned out for a second, right?

Matthias Miller  18:35
Well, there's, you know, the the trying to avoid making dumb plumbing and septic jokes, the the that really lost my train of thought,

Speaker 3  18:50
something about free sales tax validation manual. Okay,

Matthias Miller  18:53
why would anybody do manual sales tax ever? We wouldn't. Okay, thank you. So there's your answer.

Unknown Speaker  19:02
We're including. That's what I wanted. We're

Speaker 3  19:03
including at this point. So I mean, why does it matter

Speaker 1  19:07
exactly that's what I was wondering. That's what we were all wondering. That's what we were all wondering, is what we were all trying to ask ourselves. So can we

Unknown Speaker  19:14
go around this circle a couple more times I'm getting dizzy,

Matthias Miller  19:19
like that case or something. Who is talking about ice fishing? Somebody was talking about ice fishing in Norwegian merry go rounds, or something like that, where you cut, you cut a big hole in the ice, what? And you put an outboard motor in it, and you hop on the ice and you let it spin. Okay, so merry go rounds. So also, I'm trying to bring us back on track. Dwayne, come on, seriously. Why do you keep it up that

Speaker 4  19:45
was so ridiculously random. I don't even know what I'm still hold on, I'm paying for this call. Let's go back to the fact about putting outboard motors in a circle and going, what?

Matthias Miller  19:58
Okay, so you do. You, you go out on the ice, like when it's, you know, six to 12 inches deep, or whatever. And you, you put a put a drive a stake in the middle, use a rope and cut a big hole, big circle and so. And then you, you out towards the edge. You draw another hole, drill another hole, drop an outboard motor in there and turn it on, and you have your own little ice merry go round out in the middle of the I

Speaker 3  20:26
thought, I thought rednecks in my area were done with some of the stuff they do that. That one's just a whole nother level.

Unknown Speaker  20:32
There you go. It looks actually pretty cool. I never knew about it before.

Unknown Speaker  20:37
Today, you find it

Unknown Speaker  20:42
my mom had a saying, what boys won't do to give their butts a ride,

Speaker 4  20:55
an ice carousel powered by two outboard motors. Okay, back on track.

Unknown Speaker  21:04
Focus.

Speaker 4  21:06
So listen, we have got, we have got

Speaker 3  21:09
to, okay, somebody tell me that the news section of the software. How do I put stuff in there?

Unknown Speaker  21:17
Ooh, oh, I don't know

Matthias Miller  21:19
if you can,

Speaker 4  21:20
because I'm sorry, this is the kind of stuff I want to put on the news in the software one day. It's like, random thing, you know, I don't know, ice carousel without outboard motor. Ice carousel. It's like, everybody just get dying laugh out of it.

Matthias Miller  21:38
I don't know of any other. I mean, I have to admit, you are by far the most fun like I think the laugh factor is higher working with you than anybody else I've ever

Speaker 3  21:49
worked with. What the whole news section is that, is that something that I'll have access to

Unknown Speaker  21:57
right now, it's investor tools only, I don't know.

Speaker 3  22:00
I mean, if it's if it's, if it's not something we can put there, then, then let's get can we remove it?

Matthias Miller  22:08
It's, it's on here.

Speaker 3  22:10
Hit the, hit your, hit your arrow button in the bottom. Yeah, there it

Unknown Speaker  22:19
is. Yeah. It shows an assist.

Matthias Miller  22:25
Oh, that's using the new layout,

Speaker 1  22:27
yeah, UI stuff. Where'd it used to show it was in notifications or something. If it came up or where was it, did it?

Matthias Miller  22:39
It was on there. It was also sometimes on the menu.

Speaker 1  22:44
I think that that's something we need to look into actually.

Speaker 3  22:52
I mean, I actually think it's a really great thing. I just want to be able to, like, I want to be able to use it to communicate to my clients,

Matthias Miller  22:59
yeah, yeah. But the news feeds controlled by here, it's controlled. It's it's controlled here, yeah, we don't want to give you access to, I mean, but it's a little scary.

Unknown Speaker  23:14
It's all product stuff like

Matthias Miller  23:17
this is you could do client visibility, boy, it's scary to think about this going out. Yeah, investor, tools, client, can you imagine them getting ice?

Speaker 5  23:26
Cares to lose so Wall Street guys like way. What? What happened? I

Speaker 3  23:42
is it? Is it? Is it something that can be removed from if we don't have access to it?

Speaker 1  23:47
It needs to be. It should be, wait. I don't know how much work it is, but I'm, I'm thinking, Alice, okay,

Matthias Miller  23:55
so my thought then is, when you add events, we grab, we see if there's one for the current month prior to the current date. Grab that one. If it happens that we pinged later in the month, we find the earliest one after the incurred date. Alternatively, we could just ping the one within the current month that's closest to the current date. I don't know that it really matters, but we grab, we grab a rate based on the current date, and if there is no cash to date in the current month, then we throw an error, and you can't incur any charges, which shouldn't happen in that case. But in that case, you have to go in, hit the ping, hit the ping button, then either fix the customer addresses, the address is invalid, which reminds me, we need a

Unknown Speaker  24:43
Yeah, we need invalid address reporting

Matthias Miller  24:46
error, yeah, and then we need some kind of visibility into invalid addresses. Ooh, I'm getting so happy with these notes. But can. You just go create a note, say the address is invalid

Unknown Speaker  25:03
and assign it to someone, but who?

Unknown Speaker  25:09
Well, that's good question,

Unknown Speaker  25:18
because otherwise, what's the point of it being there?

Matthias Miller  25:25
Well, unless unassigned notes show up for everybody, and people just know to grab it or assign it out.

Unknown Speaker  25:31
Yeah, I don't do that. That's that could be obnoxious.

Matthias Miller  25:35
So we could have, I mean, you could have it be part of the configuration of who is responsible for handling invalid addresses, or you could assign it to the person who, who, if they're a note assignee, at least not all of them might be, but to the person who created The contact.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
Oh, great idea. That's a great idea. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:13
You know, you know, that's an interesting thought.

Unknown Speaker  26:16
How often will this happen

Speaker 3  26:18
for larger size companies like say, J mag, where blocks of customers are potentially assigned to a group of people, might be something we need to think about like,

Matthias Miller  26:30
you're more like teams, yeah,

Speaker 3  26:37
and so, so, like, if, well, I mean, essentially, what, what, what we're saying is that if, if we had a contact record called team, and you, well, I don't know, some type of record like something for the future, it's some, it's something that I think we're going to, we're going to need to handle. So basically, you could be assigned to a team that, if, if a note like this needs to be assigned to, you know, a team like that that you it automatically shows up in your list of notes to handle,

Speaker 1  27:07
and we just add a section for that in the blue sky one you want to leave it because otherwise we're gonna, we're

Matthias Miller  27:16
gonna have to Move it again. Yeah,

Speaker 1  27:20
something my wife has discovered recently is if you have something in your hand, you should just put it away. Don't put it one place and then try to put it and then put it away.

Matthias Miller  27:29
If it takes it's kind of the class. If it takes you five minutes to do the task, just do the task. Yeah, exactly. Okay, Canada, this

Matthias Miller  27:42
is not good to market

Unknown Speaker  27:48
terms.

Speaker 3  27:50
No, this is, it's, this is where's your this is not even a spring thing, but it is something

Speaker 1  27:55
No, go down, down, down, down. It's after the complete section. Yeah, down here, unscheduled future enhancements here, wow, I can't read. That's okay. That's

Speaker 5  28:07
Thank you. Makes me feel so much less alone.

Unknown Speaker  28:12
And around the ice carousel, we go.

Matthias Miller  28:18
Okay, 16 teams, all right,

Speaker 4  28:20
Canada, the idea of posting this on an investor, tools, clients, getting the ice carousel, I would laugh about that for weeks. All right.

Matthias Miller  28:37
Okay, now we were in sales tax. That's where we were. Okay? So,

Unknown Speaker  28:47
so addresses.

Matthias Miller  28:50
Now we might still not have a valid person, person in this case, in which case I don't know what you do with it, like, I mean, the person might not be able it might be a, I don't know what, if it's automation or admin, who doesn't have a doesn't get note assignments, or, I don't

Speaker 3  29:07
know what for, error addresses, assigning like something like that, assigning it to the person that originally created the contact record is a great stop gap until we come up with a better search.

Matthias Miller  29:19
Okay? And then we have so in the events, RG, we went through this, we went through the rate calculations. I think we prevent incurring events if no sales tax rate exists, no available, no sales tax rate exists. In that case, that case you need to ping, okay, so then, now, now it's really now. We finally, about 30 minutes into the call, we finally get down to why we really wanted stuff here,

Unknown Speaker  29:51
reporting, I got to learn about ice carousels,

Matthias Miller  29:53
exactly which you would not have gotten

Speaker 3  29:56
otherwise. Your life has been enriched by this. This conversation.

Unknown Speaker  30:02
Um, can we so?

Matthias Miller  30:06
Okay, I'm torn between one of two things. From an accounting impact standpoint, it would kind of be nice to have a sales tax, I don't know, tie these out to a bill or something,

Unknown Speaker  30:23
instead of trying to scrape it from the row or what?

Matthias Miller  30:28
Yeah, or maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe we just have a, if we have a just a separate event for sales tax payment, that's not terrible. We can merge them all and have a model running or something, and lump them all into a single transaction. That's not terrible. I don't care. Forget that my thought was on each row. Do we need sales tax history? Types of, type of NRG here,

Unknown Speaker  30:56
that's separate from the main RG,

Matthias Miller  31:00
from the events are G and my thought is, you theoretically,

Matthias Miller  31:14
in some ways it would be nice, because it gives you the flexibility to edit historical events without messing up sales tax liability.

Speaker 1  31:29
If you edit a historical event, aren't you changing sales tax liability? But if you don't

Matthias Miller  31:37
have a history, RG, you don't have a good way to reconcile between what did I pay for? Who and what do I owe?

Speaker 1  31:51
So are we basically duplicating our history rows? The history rows would be similar to zfp, where you're saying it would like, run, we'd run that once a month as well, and it lumped together all the tax that we like for everything that was paid that month. We get the tax for that. Is that, right?

Matthias Miller  32:16
Yeah, it'd be something like, like, it's, it'd be a sales tax liability that would be based on state, it's all this, right? And and then it would have a and a period, period, end date, yeah, some kind of period. And then a and an amount,

Speaker 1  32:38
or a sounding very, very similar to what we did,

Matthias Miller  32:45
subtotal amount. I mean, I think, you know,

Unknown Speaker  32:49
there's none of the use tax.

Matthias Miller  32:52
There's no use tax, but we probably need to handle, presumably, what we want to do is a taxable adjustment, non taxable adjustment, because presumably we should Dwayne, I'm assuming. Tell me if I'm wrong. I'm assuming you still report non taxable revenue.

Unknown Speaker  33:19
Yeah

Speaker 3  33:22
And yes, I get there have been, there have been times on non taxable revenue, customer doing a rent to own on a, you know, a building they're putting on their farm, or something like that. I'm trying to think if there would be other non taxable revenue. That's the only that jumps to mind initially.

Matthias Miller  33:43
But I mean certain fees, non taxable fees.

Unknown Speaker  33:45
Yes, correct.

Speaker 3  33:57
But yes, you would still those would still be reported. Like, yes, we still report non taxable revenue,

Matthias Miller  34:06
right? So we need a tax adjustment, not taxable adjustment, or a non might make more sense, like a tax amount.

Matthias Miller  34:20
Joe Dwayne is thinking at this point, bad debt just gets written off as non tax as a deduction of taxable revenue or non tax.

Unknown Speaker  34:34
No, no

Speaker 1  34:38
tax a road or bad debt,

Speaker 3  34:41
okay, so, so at this point, most RTO companies, okay, so I'm assuming you're referring to the conversation about whether, if you close account and there's, there's outstanding rent on it, and you would consider that to be bad rent or bad debt, correct?

Matthias Miller  34:57
Okay, hang on. Let me take it. Take this back. Debt. Duane was saying, we pay, we pay upon cash collected. And so there is no bad debt. So

Speaker 1  35:10
there is yes, yes understood.

Matthias Miller  35:13
So we use the so if I, if I bill you in in April, and you don't pay until now and the tax jumps, you still pay April taxes in the current

Speaker 3  35:24
your rate is upon incurment, but you're liable. You

Speaker 1  35:27
pay it when you get your cash right, I see, okay.

Speaker 1  35:42
Be documenting that anyway. I mean, I assume that's maybe that's pretty clear to everyone. No, it's not to me. It's yeah, okay,

Speaker 3  35:59
and okay. The only thing that we haven't discussed is Matthias prior to this is how to handle cash sale in where you are, cash sailing a repo out.

Matthias Miller  36:12
Well, we haven't done anything with cash sales whatsoever, ever. And so,

Speaker 3  36:18
well, well, yeah, okay, yes. And no, we've had conversations. Okay, so if it's buy back, if it's a, if the manufacturer buys it back, that's going to be non taxable revenue,

Unknown Speaker  36:32
I think, yeah.

Speaker 3  36:36
But in, in, in the event, because it would be selling a building for resale, but in the in the event where you sold it directly to a customer from the RTO company, we would need to handle that tax, and that would, that tax would be handled very similar to anything that we're doing over in assist.

Matthias Miller  36:57
Does that mean where you pay it right away, or Does that just mean, I don't, I don't know what that means. Why would you just create a is it sold to the contract owner? Is it sold to somebody else? The

Speaker 3  37:14
way that we handle this in RTO pro right now is you create a contact record and you sell the building to it in this case, we have an invoice. We have an invoice creation thing on the building record now where you could, you know, essentially, tie that out to a contact record and

Matthias Miller  37:31
sell this. This, this. This is predominantly, I would like to move this here, because I think it's extending beyond the scope of what we need to drag torture Seth with although I would love to, I think this is

Matthias Miller  37:51
a of a built building,

Speaker 3  37:54
as long as this particular thing doesn't cause a hiccup for what he needs to go off and do.

Unknown Speaker  38:00
Well, I think,

Matthias Miller  38:02
I mean, isn't there a world in which you would theoretically create and close out this contract with the current customer and or transfer the contract over and do a sale like, how would this not be what? What do they pay on it? And could this effectively be an EPO, like a transfer of contract plus EPO, it's

Speaker 3  38:23
not, it's not a contract, it's a repo building. So we repo the building and we cash, sold it off again,

Matthias Miller  38:32
which is the same as the people who have lot inventory, and they sell the building, right? And I guess my point is we haven't handled this anywhere. No, we haven't. You're right. And so the options that we have,

Speaker 3  38:49
and we don't be theoretically, do we I miss? Okay, no, rephrase, we don't mean maybe before I say this out loud and make sure I'm correct on this, I'd have to go ask Leanne about how we're handling some of the other RTO companies, but I think most of them are, are now in buybacks to a manufacturer. So we don't need to theoretically handle sales tax, but reporting on it as non taxable income, but so we don't have to, I don't think we need to cross this bridge, per se, by December. We will need to do it by spring.

Matthias Miller  39:29
Okay, so I have a solution. Tell me if you like this Seth, because this is based on cash collected, could we move sales tax liability to the payment record, which would then allow us to share the payment record between the retail sale of a building and the contract payment so.

Unknown Speaker  40:09
If you're talking Seth, you're muted. Sorry.

Speaker 1  40:15
There was noise in the office earlier, and I turned it off. And then, yeah, I would say I'm not sure that I love having having the payment broken down on the contract, but then storing sales tax liability stuff on the payment.

Matthias Miller  40:35
So would you rather have a duplicate RG two liability RGS, one on the payment and one on, say, an invoice, if it comes down to that. The other option is because sales tax liability. I mean, it seems like it's effectively just okay. Here is where Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. We could literally have a sales tax liability record,

Unknown Speaker  41:04
and then you link each row. You

Matthias Miller  41:06
link each row back out to the contract and wherever it came from. You could have a source record type. I mean, initially it would only be the payment to contract IDs and payment IDs. Eventually you could tie it out to what's really even just a contract.

Matthias Miller  41:32
And each contract could then say, and then you would balance on a per contract basis. And then the future, if you want to tie out to other records, you could do that. You could do that now

Matthias Miller  41:53
we're going to difficulties

Unknown Speaker  41:55
here is that we'll just have to be jumping across records to figure out it's not that bad.

Matthias Miller  42:03
It's a complicated report. Yes, yes, here's we could take it one step further, sales tax liability could be a special kind of bill, because it is what it is. I

Unknown Speaker  42:26
a menu. Remember what we don't

Matthias Miller  42:39
have the bill yet?

Unknown Speaker  42:42
Oh, yeah, I'm not sure,

Matthias Miller  42:50
like the bill has this, but you could have something special where you know hidden field or type or something where you Have an RG of sales tax jurisdictions and

Unknown Speaker  43:16
related information,

Unknown Speaker  43:27
hmm.

Unknown Speaker  43:34
And then you create one of these per month, per rental company,

Matthias Miller  43:43
one per period, per rental company,

Speaker 1  43:44
per sales tax, sales tax, vendor, sales tax, vendor, right, right, Yep.

Unknown Speaker  43:56
I mean

Speaker 1  44:00
the RG would be what you spec plus, like contract ID or something or a row ID, contract plus row ID, probably,

Matthias Miller  44:10
I think, he would have a not some per contract highly, give a second RG with the details, with the sales tax details, and you recall on the bill, okay, and you either require an RG line item to the sales tax liability account for the sum of that amount.

Matthias Miller  44:54
Or like you auto create.

Matthias Miller  45:04
Not quite tracking, okay, so you would have, you would have an RG of, and this is sales tax liabilities. And then on the bill, you would require that. So if your total sales tax liability is this much, if the sum of this RG is this then your other RG would have a no product ID. That way sales tax liabilities.

Speaker 1  45:54
So that where your accounting impact completely runs off of

Matthias Miller  46:00
no it can just run off the top. RG, you just have validation that to the top and bottom line up. And this is only for this is basically just for liability management, and you can decide how granular you want to be. Do you want to get granular down to the per payment level and reconcile on a per payment level or on a per contract level? Do Is

Speaker 1  46:28
that a decision we made? Now you're saying I don't know if we have to, mean we should make it right now, probably I don't,

Matthias Miller  46:37
but it's a technical detail that only depends on the efficiency of massive RGS and right x 30 and R 20. That's really the, probably the only real,

Speaker 1  46:52
the only real issue on a payment level thing, it's going to at the least double DRG size, right? I mean, that's the very minimum if you're just paying damage, waiver and rental with monthly payments.

Matthias Miller  47:15
But you could conceivably have, but conceivably if you do on a payment level, you could just say, No, you need the jurisdiction. Duh, silly, yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:31
I mean, how is this worse than a portfolio pricing history, RG, those go to NP.

Speaker 1  47:38
I mean, there's no way it is like we're not even going to be close to why? I don't think

Speaker 1  47:51
so. Worse, you can page the RG, can't you? And that would do it, yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:56
I mean, it's not like you have to

Unknown Speaker  47:58
Yeah. I mean, I it's not going to be that size even,

Matthias Miller  48:03
no, I don't think so. I mean, it's a 2000 contracts times maybe five entries a piece. That's 10,000 rows. And each for each RG

Unknown Speaker  48:12
row, it's split between states. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  48:17
it's split between states. And furthermore, if you really, if even the reports become too atrocious, you could do record totals grouped by contract and row Id like I just don't see any reason why per payment ID would be an issue for

Unknown Speaker  48:40
payment ID, meaning, per event row.

Matthias Miller  48:45
Sorry, per event row, okay, yeah, sorry, that's what I meant, prevent row. The cool thing is, you could go to any event row and say, what sales tax do they pay in for which jurisdictions? It said, Well, first you paid in this much to this jurisdiction, then you reverse that jurisdiction, and then you move it over to this jurisdiction, and then you adjusted the total, and you paid each of these. And here are the payment, payment dates for each one of those, and you can drill in exactly into what happened for each specific one. Yeah,

Speaker 1  49:13
that's what I think you want long term. I mean, the odds that stuff changes that much is low, but when it does you

Matthias Miller  49:23
it's a nightmare to reconcile. Otherwise, go ahead,

Speaker 1  49:25
exactly so I was guess I met Sister. That was the gist. I stole yours. I don't know if most RTO companies are gonna be that careful with their books. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  49:39
Probably not. Are you? What do you think of using bills?

Unknown Speaker  49:42
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Unknown Speaker  49:53
There's a model reality.

Unknown Speaker  49:56
I mean, kind of, kind of, does. Is it

Speaker 1  50:03
Ohio's knock on your door saying, Pay us this much. I mean, not quite there. You have to report it. But essentially,

Matthias Miller  50:11
the only thing is you have to, you have to defend to the state of Ohio how you came. I mean, okay, here's the only difference. Ohio not only says, cough up the money. Ohio comes and says, go buy this. Write your own invoice and tell us how much you owe and why.

Speaker 1  50:31
Talking, sometime we're going to come around and see if you're actually telling us the

Matthias Miller  50:34
truth. And if not, it will we will slap you, slap your hand and charge you interest. And if you're in the state of New York, we'll send you very large threatening letters claiming that you owe us 10s of 1000s of dollars just so that you return our phone calls. And then we'll, we'll negotiate down and settle it for just like, couple 100 or a couple 1000.

Unknown Speaker  51:02
I kind of like it.

Speaker 1  51:14
My one concern was that bouncing it off to another record is going to make it slower the checking liabilities, because now we're going to have to look at all the records for we're

Speaker 1  51:31
going to have to look at the all the records for this. You index off of payment row or event index, index or record totals either way. But then I think pulling something like that off the contract, okay? Number one, it makes it more flexible. We can, if we do need to handle sales tax from something that's not on a contract, we can right. Number two, it eliminates another massive RG from the contract record, which is probably not horrible,

Matthias Miller  52:06
probably not horrible. I think the flexibility and versatility is the biggest thing that I really advocating for here. I also love the fact, even though I wasn't wasn't hell bent on it, I do love the fact that it gives us a record for accounting impact that says, Yes, we paid like and it actually ties out. Now we just have to go back to

Speaker 1  52:31
so then you would, you create your the process would be, you run, run whatever creates this guy. You review it. Yeah, this looks right. Do we have a period date on the bill? Then,

Matthias Miller  52:46
yes, I think Do you want to type this?

Matthias Miller  52:56
Something like that, sales text,

Unknown Speaker  53:00
kind of like calling it a Sussex liability.

Matthias Miller  53:05
So then we have the period.

Matthias Miller  53:20
Is it Period, end date and

Speaker 3  53:28
an answer to the IDD question? I think it should be accounting company,

Unknown Speaker  53:35
agree or disagree,

Matthias Miller  53:36
we use, do you want to the fundamentally, it comes down to do you want to use bills for the guy who has his hauling business in here?

Matthias Miller  53:57
That's the only practical difference where you guys are running Berman accounting through here, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:03
but that would be an accounting company,

Matthias Miller  54:06
right? You want to use that's what

Speaker 1  54:09
I'm saying for them. Yeah? Then yes, it should be accounting company.

Unknown Speaker  54:14
Yeah, I think it should be accounting company.

Matthias Miller  54:21
Okay, so then let's go back to here sales tax. This would be on the bill record, and then we're going to go back to Bill because I can't stand not bouncing around. I'm

Matthias Miller  54:47
so then this would be the bill record we would have the

Unknown Speaker  54:52
contract ID I'm making a math request,

Unknown Speaker  54:56
event ID.

Matthias Miller  55:03
The period isn't relevant anymore. Taxable, non taxable in the tax

Unknown Speaker  55:08
amount, taxable, subtotal tax amount is, could be calculated. It's literally, yeah, exactly, yeah.

Matthias Miller  55:24
Okay, then the process is basically preview sales tax liability, select vendor plus period, create Bill X 30, and then, would we have a and then on the bill?

Unknown Speaker  55:49
Well, then don't you just pay the bill? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  55:52
but what if you want to amend the bill? That's That's what I'm after. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  56:16
would that be the same?

Unknown Speaker  56:20
Yeah, yeah. I wonder

Speaker 1  56:25
if we're gonna want to get our heads together on this report pair program or something.

Matthias Miller  56:30
I probably makes sense.

Speaker 1  56:35
Yeah, I don't know. It just feels like it has potential to get nasty if we're not careful.

Matthias Miller  56:44
Okay, so then here we would also have, I mean, you could theoretically have a link, and I don't know if you want this.

Speaker 1  57:04
Maybe the events are G Yeah, another is this out of, Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  57:17
Actually, really, what you want is, I think it's just based on contract ID, yeah, you're not gonna want

Unknown Speaker  57:23
often by

Matthias Miller  57:45
even know, if you need, you could even conceivably, I

Matthias Miller  58:00
I hopefully we have to figure it out. I don't feel strongly about that. I feel like something would be useful, and we'll probably want something about it. Okay? And then the CSV export for tax chart is basically on this, on the on the bill.

Unknown Speaker  58:20
Then what's the

Speaker 1  58:25
so is that to pay from texture? Then, yes, I don't know this how this set of things works.

Matthias Miller  58:32
This is the flat file, export, flat. Okay?

Matthias Miller  58:46
Yeah, and then also a potentially, well,

Speaker 1  58:53
what we have a standard export for bills? Well, I guess it had to be different for sales tax liability, but I assume we're going to want some standard just view PDF

Matthias Miller  59:07
or not? Yeah, I don't, I have, no, I

Speaker 1  59:15
don't know. I mean, that's feels like it's probably not a right now thing.

Matthias Miller  59:18
No, it's, I mean, we got the data model right, and I feel good with it. Good about this. Okay, schedule for this. This is a must happen by, by December, right?

Unknown Speaker  59:34
Yeah, yeah, yes, it does.

Speaker 3  59:40
Because unfortunately, states seem to think we have to pay these things. What? That's

Matthias Miller  59:45
ridiculous. I agree you need to live in a more libertarian state. You know, like California.

Unknown Speaker  59:52
Are there any states that don't charge sales tax?

Unknown Speaker  59:56
Delaware? Delaware

Unknown Speaker  59:59
doesn't. Have a sales tax.

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
I bought, I bought something in Delaware one time, and I was traveling to Pennsylvania, and I stopped by Walmart and refunded it, and they got sales tax back. And I was like, Yeah, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
moving to Montana, out there,

Speaker 1  1:00:27
so you got interest on your item basically,

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
yeah, it basically did, that's nice. Yeah, it covered miles that my father in law didn't pay because we miss communication. Go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
I was just saying, I feel someone tried to start making use of that, they would probably catch it

Matthias Miller  1:00:52
pretty fast. Maybe. Yeah, I would, I would think. I would think so, if you would do it consistently. Well, think of how much merchandise at 7% I mean, if you moved, if you moved 100 grand a product every month. I mean, you could have either in a pretty nice living.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
That's ridiculous.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:16
Oh man, although

Speaker 3  1:01:18
most of these states say that they allow their locale to actually charge a sales tax.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:25
So it's just not a state tax

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
rate wide. Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:01:31
your city or your, you know, your county might charge a sales tax.

Matthias Miller  1:01:37
Okay, so this is a, this is back to to do set delegate. I think we're ready to, I think, I think this can go to Jonathan and,

Matthias Miller  1:01:50
well, is Jonathan the best? Does Jonathan have capacity for texture stuff, and is he the best guy for it we theoretically have, if Josh, yeah, we can check with Josh. I don't know what Josh wants to do.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
I'm not sure check with Josh if Josh

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
wants to do the tax jar, because he did it, he did it for assist. He's done it

Speaker 1  1:02:15
for assist already. But I'm not quite sure what availability is like here. I think Jonathan's working on payment portal, making progress there. I don't know. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:29
feel like there's, I mean, I'm not, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:02:35
the fielding and stuff. I think we can have, like, it can probably have Nick or Sean do that depends what all it is, but a lot of the fielding stuff isn't

Matthias Miller  1:02:52
here's what I would do, have them stub in a fake ping that generates some randomness in there. So like cycles between, yes, gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
Yeah. I mean, that's easy to do. And then you and

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
I can actually build all our reporting. And then, literally, the only thing left is to tie in texture. And I'm not worried about tax or getting tight in because hope, I mean, I don't know. That's not rocket science.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
Sorry, Jonathan, you're not a rocket scientist. Well, maybe you are.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
What was

Matthias Miller  1:03:35
nuclear physicist?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:36
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:03:40
slash Lutheran slash vineyard, Pastor slash C.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:44
Developer, like crack C Plus Plus. Developer,

Matthias Miller  1:03:52
okay, so this one manual. We're not doing manual. Look at this, dude. Come on. Look at that. All right. I love it. Dwayne, we nailed it. Well, I'm pretty sure you guys have worked through the rate of next week, I think so yeah,

Speaker 3  1:04:11
but we'll so am I having a conversation with Josh, but doing texture or what was, what was the final, final decision there?

Matthias Miller  1:04:21
I mean, I'm not white knuckled about it. John having Jonathan do it, I think it's not going to happen in the next few weeks, but he's not going to stop us from doing the rest of the sales tax work. That's bottom line.

Speaker 1  1:04:33
We're going to, yeah, we're just going to stub in dummy rates for now, and then we can build all the fielding and stuff. And then we just need to integrate

Speaker 5  1:04:42
the texture. Yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  1:04:50
All right, Dwayne, let's I think that's all we need. Need from you. Seth, I appreciate you awesome making making time from your

Speaker 1  1:04:58
mind to sleep. Schedule? No, I don't have many meetings. I'm basically I spent over eight hours yesterday, Cliff, the nine hours yesterday working on this bag

Unknown Speaker  1:05:08
and delegating and stuff. So I feel very good about it. We make good progress. Thanks. I will let you all do that now.

Speaker 3  1:05:18
Well, if you're bored, good take around on your on your

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
outboard ice.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
It's not quite cold enough here for that yet. Have to remember that this

Unknown Speaker  1:05:34
winter. Okay, so, Yep, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:05:38
Are convenient speeds part of Phase One December.

Speaker 2  1:05:42
No, nope, nope, absolutely not. I'm

Speaker 3  1:05:50
not even sure they're going to be available for for spring. I mean, they're probably not a ton of work, but it's like, you know what? If you're charging a convenience

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
fee, then

Speaker 3  1:06:05
maybe you just bake it in as another fee that you put on every single contract. But no, I mean, definitely not by December.

Matthias Miller  1:06:14
Okay, we'll move it to spring, and we can always bump from there at least good do um, are we

Matthias Miller  1:06:25
doing contract entry by December?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:28
More than just we gotta have a way to enter contracts. I mean, manually.

Speaker 3  1:06:35
So there is some contract entry thing that you started on in here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
what? Okay, what do you mean by contract entry?

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
Well, what I mean is like a fancy one pager where you just go down the list and but to me, like it might be obnoxious, but can't you just go create a contract and create a product and then go create the sorry, create the contact, create the product, create the contact, and Just finesse it enough to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19
Or

Matthias Miller  1:07:22
I have an idea,

Speaker 3  1:07:24
what if? Are you ready? An idea, too? And that is that we go off and create a a spreadsheet thing where you drop your details in, which creates a CSV that we just make

Unknown Speaker  1:07:35
it No,

Matthias Miller  1:07:36
it's better than this. It's better than this. You have a you have a dashboard. When the dashboard runs, it generates a unique, random ID, and it opens up a

Unknown Speaker  1:07:54
content, a contact.

Matthias Miller  1:08:01
How is it? Maybe this doesn't work with existing contacts.

Speaker 3  1:08:06
Are you gonna Are you gonna say it's gonna open up three panes. One opens up a record for the contract and new record for the Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:08:16
and it stops the hidden magic ID in a hidden RG so it can link them all together.

Speaker 2  1:08:27
You know, that's not a bad idea. That is not a bad idea at all.

Matthias Miller  1:08:38
The main thing you need then is a a like, I assume your dashboard would prompt for a contact, and if it's blank, it would create a new one, and you could prompt for a product as well. And if it's blank, you could add a new one. That's actually, that's like less than half a day at work for

Unknown Speaker  1:09:01
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:03
say that last thing again. What was that again? Say it

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
again. Okay, so the dashboard would have to ask props, show me the who's the customer and who's the who's the customer. Wow. And what's the product? And blank equals new, new customer, new product. So you pop over the contact list, and you'd search to see if they're in there. If it is, you selected if it's an existing product, you would go put in the product. If not, you would leave it blank. You get continue, and now you get the three things, and they're all set up to link to each other.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
Um,

Speaker 3  1:09:42
dude. That's not bad. So then, basically you have a you have three pains,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:51
right? Is it three? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:02
I mean, the only

Speaker 3  1:10:17
question I'm going to have is, how do you take the initial payment. How do you input the initial payment?

Matthias Miller  1:10:28
Because that affects the contract value.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
No, it needs to be there. I mean, because that's

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
part of entry. So you have three pains. I

Speaker 3  1:10:48
I mean, can, can we could? Could we make it that if once the contracts in and you say, take a payment, it populates

Unknown Speaker  1:10:54
a fourth pay

Unknown Speaker  1:10:56
with the with the whiskey?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
No, that's probably not going to work, is it?

Matthias Miller  1:11:04
Why would you just, when you save the contract, say that's what? When you take the contracts, have a an enter payment, enter initial payment. I'm not sure I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22
like where you're going with this.

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
Do we even need the hidden magic linking thing?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:30
I don't know

Speaker 3  1:11:33
some, I mean, some way, like, in some way, you need to, I mean, I think so. I think there needs to be some way that automatically link all three together.

Matthias Miller  1:11:47
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
okay, so let's talk a little bit about initial payment entry. I mean, you kind of want to use the whiskey for that, don't you?

Speaker 3  1:12:55
Well, okay, so here's my question. So you do all three, you save, you save, you save, and then the take a Payment button would be there. What happens? You just go and take the payment.

Matthias Miller  1:13:08
Why could we use it? I mean, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:13:10
what would happen when You click it there in the dashboard, but I good

Unknown Speaker  1:13:46
don't know if We have

Matthias Miller  1:13:48
wish you could find one for you.

Speaker 4  1:14:02
I i go back

Speaker 4  1:14:18
to signal, okay, if I'm the funniest client you've ever worked with, How do other people get through this stuff without just finding hilarity?

Matthias Miller  1:14:27
Oh, they just go bonkers. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:35
Right pain. I

Matthias Miller  1:14:43
what I wonder, though, is you could also do this just by having a contract entry process, where, when you save the contact, it says, Okay, now let's take you over to the product you. And you would pass the hidden ID the whole way through. So you would hang on,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
wait, why does he think that he likes Lord of the Rings more than I did

Matthias Miller  1:15:12
because you were hating on wizards? I

Speaker 3  1:16:28
So okay, you're saying so you enter the contact on save something happens that takes you to the next step.

Matthias Miller  1:16:37
Yeah, so basically, contract entry, so you

Unknown Speaker  1:16:41
have a I like your multi pain way better

Unknown Speaker  1:16:44
you do. Oh, the multi

Speaker 3  1:16:47
pain thing where it's like, Okay, here's, here's my contact record, here's my contract record, here's my product record. Well, I mean, probably we have to have some sort of it would probably, actually, would probably be contact product contract, but that it's way cooler. It's like it's all right there in front of you. Go fill it out,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:06
right?

Matthias Miller  1:17:10
The main thing that we have to be sure of is that people always save all of them before they leave.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:18
Yeah, but I mean, if I mean,

Speaker 3  1:17:22
Chrome would I think, if they're not saved, doesn't chrome stop you from leaving it once it or the software stops you from leaving I'm

Matthias Miller  1:17:30
assuming it does in a dashboard

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
that. So that is a question.

Matthias Miller  1:17:39
Yeah, it does. I know it does. I've been playing around with this stuff, other dashboards, in other places, pretty sure, I've created my own little task management dashboard that's just ridiculously awesome, complete with KPIs and other types of stuff. Okay, so if I go to, let me test it here, if I go to, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
well, I think we're really close on that one. I mean, it's not so. Then you,

Matthias Miller  1:18:28
when you I think, what happens? Then when you save to the contact, and you jumped over to the contract, it would pop up to say something like, there's a new contact and you have to hit a button to actually apply it to your contract.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:55
But I mean, okay, in theory, on both the

Unknown Speaker  1:18:59
both the the

Speaker 3  1:19:03
contract could automatic, okay, for both the contract and the product, like both of these are, sorry, but the con on the contract record for linking a contact and linking the product. I mean, you could do that yourself on the on the record itself, just by hitting the drop downs, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:19:21
you could, you would have to have any magic linking stuff to do that, right, which would be a great December thing.

Speaker 5  1:19:28
Yeah, didn't we just say this is like 30 minutes of work, yeah?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:36
So tell have Nick go whip it up.

Matthias Miller  1:20:11
Do you want to wait to? Hey, hang on.

Matthias Miller  1:20:23
Okay, but we have not handled hang on

Unknown Speaker  1:20:30
bird ran, is it logged in the events on Deer, let

Matthias Miller  1:20:59
is dwf always calculated you're responding.

Speaker 3  1:21:16
So if somebody's on a weekly basis, then at some point in the month, dwf would need to be so the probably, if someone's on weekly then, or some other frequency, they would the first one inside of the month frequency would be the one to hit it with.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
That seems complicated. Okay, I need to drop

Matthias Miller  1:21:43
likewise, we'll talk tomorrow. Good stuff, man, good progress. That

Unknown Speaker  1:21:48
was, that was very, I don't know, I can't think of the word I'm looking for. It was very productive. There we go. Agreed.

Matthias Miller  1:21:58
All right. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks, sir, good.
