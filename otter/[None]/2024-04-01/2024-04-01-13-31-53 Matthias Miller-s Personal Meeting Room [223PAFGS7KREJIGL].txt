Unknown Speaker  01:02
back again.

Unknown Speaker  01:03
Hey back again

Unknown Speaker  01:11
sign of

Unknown Speaker  01:15
do you have 130 there now?

Unknown Speaker  01:17
I do have one Yeah 130 Here

Unknown Speaker  01:52
Mark

Speaker 1  02:00
you're on. Yep. Hey, Drew quick while both of you I just talked to Leanne about fixing those RTO premiums well I guess she had a good point if you I think this is something that you can do she said Well, if she'll she'll get it fixed. It'll be tomorrow for noon likely. But if this if we're not going to do this ongoing, can you remove probably inactivate that right also nobody can use it moving forward.

Unknown Speaker  02:40
Yeah, the meow that's going to do that.

Speaker 1  02:45
So what happens if you like if you right now inactivate that would that still allow them to open the existing ones delete the transaction, but they couldn't use it moving forward. Like okay, yeah, I'd say go ahead and just just do that and then we'll so that's Are you ready to look at finished goods inventory? Yes, your and stuff I think this is pretty straightforward, but I send you two pages one is the chart of accounts the other is an example of what I plan to send to you for each district. So let's look at the last the finished goods inventory number first. But what I intend to send you is here's a list of all the sins all the buildings in inventory as of 1231 just as of 1231 23, the spin number the material number the production labor and the production overhead. If you want me to I can add columns that say all what is it freeze as freeze free standard number as actual or whatever the terminology is terminologies that we use there

Matthias Miller  04:15
Hang on just one second here so this is is this a spreadsheet that you sent over?

Unknown Speaker  04:24
No, it was just a PDF that I did a PDF

Unknown Speaker  04:29
sorry I'm not in the right

Speaker 2  04:31
it's on the don't the thing of the response on the giant bumping to 330 got it

Unknown Speaker  04:41
where it is

Unknown Speaker  04:47
I send it was add

Speaker 2  04:54
I don't think so. Oh, yeah, no.

Speaker 3  04:58
So seeing Okay, I'm seeing a phone menu and

Speaker 1  05:08
it looks like the phone menu but is it yellow and gross? I'm sorry Yeah, it does look like our phone menu. It should be the second page have that

Speaker 3  05:18
got it I'm sorry that was you so this is

Speaker 1  05:23
really basic but but my intent is to send you in the the page that's in landscape to send you one file like this probably Yeah, probably one file that says district you know as of it should say 1231 23 And then stands for all buildings that are in finished goods inventory as of that day, the material number production labor number the production overhead number and then I mean, if you want me to I can add columns to the left of each of those that say whether you like freeze production labor or freeze freeze standard cost as actual costs or something like that you have a yes and no option if you if you were to go to any one buildings, finished goods inventory calculations are breakdown

Unknown Speaker  06:38
Alright, so we would want

Matthias Miller  06:45
do we want this to be both the standard cost in the actual cost

Speaker 1  06:52
Yeah, I mean is that we want it to be a fixed cost so whatever

Matthias Miller  07:06
I mean, so we could we in some ways, it's more accurate to say the accounting basis is the actual cost as long as we set the accounting basis to the actual cost, there won't be any variance

Speaker 1  07:34
I'm looking at this FDA calculations file that you'd sent for that broke down you'd send it as a along with the income statements in January where it shows breakdown of each everything in revenue and then you have a raw materials percentage, raw materials dollar value, option labor percentage production labor dollar value production overhead percentage production overhead dollar value and then of the actual costs out of that or you have raw materials freeze yes or no raw materials actual cost amount raw materials labor freeze yes or no production labor actual costs and production labor production overhead actual cost yes or no? Right free so

Speaker 1  08:41
yeah, whatever whatever works best to just freeze these numbers permanently

Matthias Miller  08:52
if we freeze we do it going to probably make some notes got this

Matthias Miller  09:12
thank you we said the actual cost date to the build build date

Speaker 1  09:21
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I don't be the only there's two things we want out of this. One is we wanted to create an aggregate number for balance sheet. And then two is we want these numbers to reflect as cogs. Once these buildings are invoice I don't mean setting it as of the build date. I don't think I think that's correct.

Speaker 3  10:06
Do you are you going through? Okay, sure.

Speaker 1  10:09
What what we're seeing is, these buildings were built a long time ago, we did not have good records of how much actual costs were incurred. This is our best estimate. We want to permanently fix these values on these buildings and then is what it is.

Matthias Miller  10:35
Yeah. Um, and there's no reason why going forward, you would want to you would want to track the the difference between the standard cost that we thought was the standard cost versus the actual class that we came up with?

Speaker 1  10:59
No, there's there's not because we have no good data to. From underwater, I mean, we have no better day to do. So this was

Matthias Miller  11:18
yeah, that makes sense. No, I think so. I think that's pretty straightforward. Now we're going to have to, yeah, I can import that in right away. And then we'll want to get that pushed over before we before we freeze the the, the accounting or freeze the accounting, in fact, for 23.

Speaker 1  11:50
Now, what are we okay, here's what I, there are going to be here and there, you're going to? Here's what I would suggest. I'll send you this list. Imported. And if you could just send back to me? Well, no, I could do that on my site. Like, how do we handle? Oh, there's there's buildings and finished goods inventory that? Well, I know there, there are a handful of buildings in finished goods inventory. They show in finished goods inventory. But technically what they are is repossessed buildings, still owned by the rent own company need to be in finished goods inventory. So they saw that dealers can see them to sell them. So for those was put in a $0 value, because when they sell there's no we never bought them back. There's no calls. There's Yeah, that's enough of an edge case that I'll just put zeros in there. So, I mean, is that is there anything else you need from me on that other than an Excel file with four columns? Like I have here?

Speaker 3  13:16
I don't think so. No. Okay.

Speaker 1  13:22
Should be able to get that to you tomorrow. And then. So, now if we go back to the Chart of Accounts section that I just want to run through that real quick and tell you how we're planning to use that. So the three rounds highlighted in green, the raw materials completed buildings and buildings, again, for production overhead. ones I'll send you these files. And then we'll import those laws, then we'll want to the other transactions any transactions not tied to those buildings will want to get rid of in accounting. So if I have 500 buildings in a district then we we should have 500 transactions in raw materials 500. Debits completed buildings and 500, debits and the other completed buildings and accounting should have the exact same total as if I were to add up my my columns. So that's on the on the green, the yellow, those are all asset accounts. We're going to handle like expense accounts that at the end of every year we empty all of them and they start at zero. So, what Drew is planning to do is make a journal entry to

Unknown Speaker  15:17
your out each one of these as of 1231. So that we have we want to, we want to apply actual cause for

Speaker 1  15:33
for January for all billings news in January and February so we want to measuring all of those out. Then if we go to look at what big payroll taxes and insurance what we would, what we would do is we would add together we'd say okay, how much actual cause have we had in payroll taxes and insurance from January one to February 29, how much indirect labor indirect labor employee transportation and subcontract labor add all those together, they this is our actual cause, apply that actual cause to add then all of the fancy math and calculations that we built all of this actual costing and by doing that, that would also make sure that the production labor to finished goods on contra account is equal to that. So if the sum total of the other we're using as expense accounts is 250,000. or So standard costing is 230,000. When we apply the actual costing it'll change our costing to 250,000. And it will also be the negative entrepreneur Tupiza $1,000 value in production labor to finished goods. So does that make sense? I don't know that it's I mean, I think Drew has a real good handle on that. But is there anything that you can I don't think it really affect you but I think it's still helpful to have you in the know.

Matthias Miller  17:27
Yeah, I think it makes I mean yeah, it makes sense to me. I don't know that I've got much to add it seems seems pretty straightforward. said all this work. Yeah. That's what they say. Famous last words.

Speaker 1  17:50
Okay, so let's look at asset management or depreciation. Now, this is the file I sent to you. I'd like to get into this just a little bit if we have

Unknown Speaker  18:09
so you're, again I want to send you this file. Have you run an import for all of these assets as of 1230, or all of the assets that were put in service

Speaker 1  18:34
prior to January 1, and then have you run an import for all these assets including transactions for depreciation expenses year to date, depreciation expenses should automatically post the first day of the month so January first February 1, March and April 1. Now there's new and I recently looked at one of these that we'd entered kind of as a test the bird What is it birds mouth? Not sure on Row 20 Row 26 on my file

Speaker 1  19:37
so okay, the one thing that we did notice on this is that there appear to be no assist was not posting automatic transactions changed and expenses per month of 6420 Nine per month to predict count which I haven't

Matthias Miller  20:13
let me see if so it looks to me like a shadow birds now it might just be that we didn't you record

Unknown Speaker  20:27
that function on

Matthias Miller  20:29
Yeah, I just think we never started doing that. So but the bird smell by the way do you have an ID column on these?

Speaker 1  20:41
I do if you yeah if you if you click on the little two at the top it'll it'll expand to show all my columns today

Matthias Miller  20:53
okay but but it is not filled in yet or you're planning though we're

Speaker 1  20:59
planning to I'll only have one I thought Whitney had an ID column for her tax bases ID she does not so we'll just need one

Matthias Miller  21:11
so let me make sure my numbers match we have a on the on the Bird's Mouth trust not sure yeah, that's the issue we have a value six it might be good to see value link transactions so we have here maybe good just to run it through and see if the auto calculated value is what we think it should be

Unknown Speaker  21:58
so slow

Matthias Miller  22:06
let me share my screen so that at least through can follow along if he wants to.

Speaker 1  22:12
I'm looking at the screenshot true that you had sent me of the or this asset is configured and set up I know this was the one that we had thought we had entered transactions Yeah. Okay that correctly for backed moving forward in 24 it's a different story, but all of these that already are partially depreciated we somehow had to walk through you know we somehow had to enter it so that will asset value still remained but that a portion of it had already portion of the depreciation the correct portion of the depreciation had already expense

Matthias Miller  23:06
correct so we have some a little confused there because we have here date put in service 625 whereas the spreadsheet says 917 21 was when it was put in service do Am I looking at the wrong one?

Unknown Speaker  23:29
No, I think that's the one

Unknown Speaker  23:33
and the

Speaker 1  23:35
what do you seeing it? Are you on row 26 on the spreadsheet?

Matthias Miller  23:40
Sorry? No, apparently not.

Unknown Speaker  23:44
Thank you probably several burrs

Matthias Miller  23:48
right 7200 So we're okay. There was saying 6429 is the monthly depreciation expense. And let me go find this guy. 60. But he's wanting to

Speaker 2  24:07
Yeah, so we so we had to write the other side the depreciation

Unknown Speaker  24:16
right?

Unknown Speaker  24:18
The amount that has already depreciated.

Matthias Miller  24:23
So it's wanting to depreciate at 572 for January 1 5014. Okay, is AD the ad is the depreciation amount. Is that what it is? Set 771 48. Our

Speaker 1  24:51
ad is just that that's what I said. That's for January one. That's for the, for the year, for the 12 months and 23. I said for 29 times whatever start and end date and this is what I gave to Whitney for her journal entry on what depreciation expenses are for the year.

Unknown Speaker  25:20
But we need a good

Speaker 1  25:25
well, I know there was the the asset we set up the asset and assist the depreciation expense as honored 2857 per month on COVID, I think there was some and it shows like there's still what $514.29 left to depreciate of this asset with the X month in in, because at the end of useful life is June 30 of this year. So if I divide that by six men 8572, which is what you not sure where you're seeing you, and if I send you to miss is but

Matthias Miller  26:20
okay, the the bottom line is somewhere in the spreadsheet, I'm going to need to know what the asset value is. As of January 1.

Matthias Miller  26:41
Are all historical breached depreciation one or the other? I mean, I guess I could calculate that that I could do. Although the calculation I can easily

Speaker 1  26:55
mean I can easily calculate that in a spreadsheet to if you want me.

Matthias Miller  27:00
Yeah, I'm just a little confused because your spreadsheet says that depreciation is 6429.

Speaker 1  27:07
Oh, you don't want I? I'm pretty sure that. So I have a salvage value on this thing. And there is no salvage value in assist on this. Ah, that would explain anything production equipment and fixtures. And I'm not sure which is right, because

Unknown Speaker  27:32
we see

Speaker 1  27:35
the asset Yeah, that we never did complete the asset classes. In assist, we never completed all of this setup in assists. But if that was were 25%, then I think we would agree on this.

Matthias Miller  28:01
Am I allowed to change the production equipment and fixtures asset salvage value to 25%?

Speaker 1  28:07
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'd be good. All

Unknown Speaker  28:11
right. So let's, let's try this again. And see what it thinks it'd be now. Let's do production

Matthias Miller  28:26
Why are you not there we go. Now it's $1,800. Now it insists that we are $0 a month. That's weird. Well,

Speaker 2  28:35
yeah. Because Because we only owed 700 bucks by the end of last year. So

Matthias Miller  28:44
we're not gonna Yeah, so we won't depreciate this thing going forward.

Speaker 1  28:50
Oh, our journal entry then is is wrong. Right, the journal entries that we made to own well

Matthias Miller  29:01
so do you want that to be 1800 plus 514 29?

Speaker 2  29:10
Me? No, it should just be 1800 And then the rest should be in depreciation.

Speaker 1  29:19
No, it should be. So we have six months of depreciation remaining in in 24. So it should be six times the monthly depreciation amount of 62.

Matthias Miller  29:34
Okay, 64 2914 I'm coming out with 2185 74 Does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  29:46
You'd be in the right.

Unknown Speaker  29:49
sounds right to me. I haven't. Me too.

Matthias Miller  30:02
Well, he's more comfortable when you confirm it Mark than when I just go his my

Speaker 1  30:08
2021 84 Yeah. And I don't know what we're doing with the rounding, I'm sure Matthias thought about that I didn't mess with the rounding on my spreadsheet, but I think I rounded to the monthly I just rounded to the nearest nearest cent. But then if there's assuming if there's money left over any one way or the other a few pennies, then it just all gets applied on the last month.

Matthias Miller  30:46
We I think what we do is we just take the current balance divided by remaining months and round. So there's typically if we'd be running for the whole length of the period, there would be a one, you know, maybe a penny variance from month to month.

Speaker 2  31:05
Oh, it would adjust as it goes. It would adjust as it goes. Wow, tech stuff.

Speaker 1  31:16
So Matthias, if you have nothing else to do some time, and you'd like calculations like this? I think we should. You need to figure out how to calculate when solar eclipses are. I've been messing around I've been looking for there's actually books out there that teach you how to calculate wrangles and your rotations in plants so that you Well, obviously it's a mathematical calculation so that you can you can figure out where the center of the eclipse is the Southern limit, the Northern Limit. I'm getting off track here.

Matthias Miller  31:59
Well, that didn't take us too much further off track. I had somebody who runs a Sign Company, a CNC routing, for signs for acrylic signs, and was looking to do automatic pricing calculations. The only problem is that based on a conversation I had with a colleague, the moment you get into geometrical computational geometry, you run in all kinds of bait basically, computers are designed for four aren't designed well for fractional and irrational or whatever. Not irrational. But, you know, for numbers like that, and you run into weird kinds of precision issues, make it extraordinarily expensive to develop software like that.

Matthias Miller  32:56
All right, well, now I'm seeing this can't be right, though, because so we set the value the values to 185. Well, maybe this minus 1800.

Unknown Speaker  33:14
Should be about right.

Matthias Miller  33:16
divided by six, six quarters. This is not this is taking the

Unknown Speaker  33:23
that amount was wrong last time, too.

Matthias Miller  33:26
Oh, but Nintendo's wrote that because we haven't depreciated for the first three months. But if I say go tell me what depreciation should be for Virginia, we first stop it because we don't have any depreciation recorded. So we're saying, wait for it, wait for it. 6464 29 Bingo. Okay. So we're good.

Speaker 1  33:59
So, so Matthias, tell me what you need from me. Import. Okay. I want to get the asset. If we can do it, do an import to get all of the existing assets prior to January 1, forced into the asset management. I will add let's take a quick run through my file here. So I will add an ID to each one of these. C D, that's their E I'm going to add some groups. A few of these are going to be grouped like some renovation properties or some things where if you remember the group conversation then I think that's I think it's just a way to organize basically. Then date is I tried to match It's your layout a format that you have when we set up new ones individually. Date is the going to use that as the purchase date. As well as the date put in service, I would imagine the column F is the day we use for assume this is when we bought the asset initially, and it's also when we put it in. B is the account, the asset account. H is amount, which, oh, you're the cause, you have, I'm not sure why we have amount and caught while Yeah. In assists, now we'll have these were pretty much all just single transaction or what we'll handle them a single transaction assets. But the amount cause date put in service, I'm just going to use the same day as column F salvage value is just be calculated off of the asset. Why as which drew you will have to make sure that we have all of that set up correctly before Matthias does this knowledge value the allocated percentage is like if 25% of a mule to move sheds, maybe 25% of the time, it's used on a sales lot 50% It's used on or logistics and the other 25% It's used at a production facility something like that. So you can split it up to where to multiple occasion expense accounts, most of those will only be on depreciation expense account. The accumulated depreciation account that the asset class said that the useful life is determined by the asset class started useful life is always the first day of the month who are following the day? Put in service so it's putting service April 1, then that would be start of useful life. I think that's modeling what what you build and of useful life? Which I don't know this. Really, you can just ignore these really messiahs I think because most of this stuff is just automatically calculates this like the expense per month. So an abandoned on which I don't. So tell me what else you need from me to do the

Matthias Miller  37:56
I don't think there's any thing the initial

Speaker 1  38:01
value as of like on this last 25 7040 Okay. I'll

Matthias Miller  38:08
just do a can easily calculate number of months to January 1 and prorate.

Speaker 1  38:20
So if I fill out this. So if Drew and I make sure that our classes are set up, like the tables for the classes are set up correctly. And now there's things like depreciation expense accounts and the ID. group if there is any, then to have everything you need. I think so.

Matthias Miller  38:49
Now we've I'm seeing real estate here with a useful life. Not sure how we're supposed to depreciate without useful life, or is there no depreciation? Wow.

Speaker 1  39:02
Okay, asset management does not well. So Asset Management is a place to store your assets. It doesn't mean that everything depreciate, so like real estate does not depreciate. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:19
Bad deal. Okay. So the main thing I'm not sure about is let's just try this in the test system. I don't know if well, I guess. So let's do a new asset. Let's see we do have land. Alright, so we do assets, manage assets. ABC, do we have land in here? No. I'm going to create a test system or test asset

Speaker 1  40:02
We call it real estate, I'm not sure if we updated there.

Matthias Miller  40:06
It's called land right here. But so we're going to do a niche. Let's see, we're gonna save the keyword to do put into service, one 120 20. Depreciation and.

Unknown Speaker  40:31
Building

Matthias Miller  40:37
don't know that there's a good place to put it, but we need to select a depreciation account. Alright, so if I create a transaction then or.

Unknown Speaker  41:00
Real Estate

Speaker 3  41:17
Assist is running really slowly.

Speaker 2  41:24
Mark, if I may just insert question here, we don't want Len Mark premiums available for write offs either do we?

Speaker 2  41:37
I mean, those would be the same as RTO premiums are?

Unknown Speaker  41:48
Not sure. Find more

Unknown Speaker  41:58
we do create a deposit for those.

Speaker 2  42:02
Right there's still needs deposited but I mean, it should function the same. They just might have to like landmark it doesn't come in a separate check doesn't

Unknown Speaker  42:16
know that's all one one payment. Premium and the other payment. Yeah, so they'll just have to split it out. Which is really gonna stink, but I'm not sure how to make it. Well

Speaker 2  42:42
no, because if they apply that to the to the building, it will be deposited then. Yeah, that'll work. Because the right off portion of landmark will have the premium will go to the right place. And the whole thing will be deposited because it's just a normal payment. Like the house. Okay, I'll leave that. I'll leave that one be. Now, Matthias, where are the settings for those asset classes.

Matthias Miller  43:28
Accounting, accounting, configuration, asset classes,

Unknown Speaker  43:31
accounting,

Matthias Miller  43:35
accounting configuration asset classes right now.

Speaker 1  43:39
Now, I'm going to need to run unfortunately, right here. But if you take a look at the tables sheet on my file that I sent to you, we might want to think about I think right now the way it's set up an asset class, you have a name for an asset class, which determines your salvage value and your useful life. I'm not sure if it if it designates or determines your asset account and your accumulated depreciation account. It could very well that's what I did on my table here.

Unknown Speaker  44:16
Where

Speaker 1  44:19
select your asset class and boom, you've selected your salvage value useful life, the asset account and the accumulated depreciation account. If we want it to look at doing something like that, and it's easy enough otherwise, I mean, we can do it manually as well.

Matthias Miller  44:36
Currently, it doesn't, but we could switch it to currently that's that can be changed on a per asset basis.

Speaker 1  44:44
I think if it's then let's let's leave it as is for right now. Because it's one of those things where we might I'd rather to. Maybe we will discover that there are some edge cases where we don't want that or we want that flexible Okay, so with that, let me know if there's anything else that you need from me on this other than what I have, and then we'll move forward from there. I

Matthias Miller  45:15
think I got what I need. I will let you know if that changes.

Speaker 1  45:21
Yeah. And as far as you're going to be out most of the day tomorrow, right? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:25
I might have some time to work on some of this stuff in the afternoon. It just depends a little bit but my planning to focus on Wednesday.

Speaker 1  45:35
Get my stuff as much as of it as I can like finished goods inventory and that stuff over to you. And we'll go from there.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
Okay, thanks.

Speaker 2  45:47
Mark, sending you an email with the current settings on assets, just mark it up and send it back.

Unknown Speaker  45:55
Okay, good. Thank you.

Speaker 2  45:59
Thanks. Matthias How much time do you have? Do you have a little just a little bit?

Unknown Speaker  46:03
Yeah, 10 minutes. Okay.

Speaker 2  46:05
We were looking at it was accounts receivable, and we found some stuff in there that was from a canceled sales or canceled Yeah, sales order. That was showing up and accounts receivable still.

Speaker 2  46:30
Case in point being $374,500, bogus invoice that was granted as a test. That's how we thought.

Matthias Miller  46:46
Well, I mean, Mark, and I had a conversation about this. I mean, this is a part of our conversation earlier, we're assuming that the correct process would be to do to record the

Unknown Speaker  46:57
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:58
record a refund going forward? For 2023. It was planning to do write offs to reverse this. In is that still where we're at? Are you thinking something different? Okay,

Speaker 2  47:18
that was for customer deposits received on sales orders. I think this is just a sales order where there's still a balance due there's no payments received.

Unknown Speaker  47:38
Oh, it's a canceled sales order with a

Speaker 2  47:42
canceled sales order. There's no payments. It's just saying, Hey, this guy still owes you $374,000. But it's canceled, like it should just

Unknown Speaker  47:55
give us sales already.

Unknown Speaker  47:58
Um, there's a transaction number

Unknown Speaker  48:00
me here. That's my

Speaker 2  48:04
sales are ideas and 23101761.

Matthias Miller  48:13
Okay, this one's canceled counting.

Payment invoice rows. It's invoiced and you're showing as canceled. She's weird. So what kind of impact? So I'm going to assume

Matthias Miller  48:57
if there were payments on a canceled one, we still want those to hit accounting, but we do not want to treat it

Speaker 2  49:17
can we write a reversal when it gets canceled?

Matthias Miller  49:21
Right if we would just do exact reverse of invoicing as the cancellation date? I think so.

Speaker 2  49:32
Because we don't necessarily want to say, Oh, just erase that.

Matthias Miller  49:38
We don't want to use the old one, right.

Speaker 2  49:43
I mean, partially because, well like this, it spans one on next. So if we pay sales tax on this, then it gets cancelled. We want to adjust the new month.

Unknown Speaker  49:57
Right? No, that is the right thing to do. One thing is it's gonna have to go through an update cycle

Speaker 2  50:08
well, we might have to do that no update thing in a couple of days or something.

Matthias Miller  50:15
Yeah. Let me I can choose it. That seems to me like priority number one.

Speaker 2  50:24
My guess is there's a ton more like this, but I don't know. Like, this might also be a connecting issue to that. You know, a lot of those other ones were actually zero balance do with the customer deposit thing. So

Matthias Miller  50:44
this shouldn't be this isn't going to be too. It's not going to be too obnoxious to do. You.

Unknown Speaker  50:57
Okay, yeah. All right. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  51:09
Two steps forward and back and sometimes three back.

Unknown Speaker  51:16
But you think overall, we're moving forward. All right. Awesome. Thanks, Drew.
