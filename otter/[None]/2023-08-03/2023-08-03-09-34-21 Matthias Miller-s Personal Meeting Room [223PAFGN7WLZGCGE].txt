Speaker 1  00:03
What do you answer one of the things that I think makes me successful

Speaker 1  00:24
worth continuing on with some of the experience of government

Unknown Speaker  00:35
exemptions

Unknown Speaker  00:47
get started which

Unknown Speaker  00:54
we'll get to revenues when

Unknown Speaker  01:09
we walk in

Unknown Speaker  01:20
in any famous person is not going to be the other person

Unknown Speaker  01:32
the person I

Speaker 1  01:49
am identification we'll take a look at

Unknown Speaker  02:00
that

Speaker 1  02:16
look at this which gives you an apples to apples

Unknown Speaker  02:34
reading what's going

Unknown Speaker  02:43
on

Speaker 1  02:51
Good evening Good morning

Unknown Speaker  03:11
second thing

Unknown Speaker  03:37
what I can do I think

Unknown Speaker  03:50
that's it

Unknown Speaker  04:25
yeah apparently we're seeing Fox racism

Speaker 1  04:53
like it's not like it's the glory of God. You can see when everyone's very serious In this video I think it makes

Speaker 1  05:11
a huge advantage that there is something here about that

Speaker 1  05:26
you're starting starting when you're just starting out it's like a clean slate something that at least great like the first five people are gonna be one of us but then as you're gonna do it's like well if there's 10 People like if I was on Thurs then okay put me up against 10 people and I can beat night and then put me up against and I think a lot of this stuff there's so much stuff to write reviews to be first of all there's a script if it's negative articles there's a lot of what I'm originally thinking of quitting

Speaker 1  06:23
but it's not the only time and there's things that motivate us that we're interested in and I think you know the downsides if you're somebody already guaranteed religious

Unknown Speaker  06:38
experience and a lot of value so it's important to me it's a niche within once you've found that if you allow your activity awesome if you can find a way to

Speaker 1  07:01
enhance its that's feedback you're just going to keep going

Speaker 1  07:18
and then the third mistake it's not that exciting

Unknown Speaker  07:31
money based on your income and mostly be the thing that motivated those years and I'm leaving now

Unknown Speaker  08:02
what's new but that doesn't mean that certain people want the

Unknown Speaker  08:19
most so it means government takes if you

Unknown Speaker  08:48
are going to be involved what are the impact on people who's been that person who's not successful I think one of the one of the classes of being the more that means getting rich

Unknown Speaker  09:22
obviously, it's not just a bulwark after infection, but it's not the attendance completely and so when it dawns on you what are those moments?

Unknown Speaker  09:59
Good day Do

Unknown Speaker  10:07
you change the expectation that means leaving the gym like that

Unknown Speaker  10:22
going to the lounge when you win

Unknown Speaker  10:48
one

Speaker 1  10:55
good English

Unknown Speaker  11:30
I think

Unknown Speaker  11:38
one of the gaps This is the guide actually wanting to

Speaker 1  11:58
know like his power not just going to be teaching more than just

Unknown Speaker  12:14
left and leaving
