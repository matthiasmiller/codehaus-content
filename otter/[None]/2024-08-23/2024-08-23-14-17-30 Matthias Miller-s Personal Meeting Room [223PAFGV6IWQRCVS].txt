Matthias Miller  00:00
Finally get them,

Speaker 1  00:01
I think, I think that literally, it's in the word, it's, it's a drink, yes, fair

Matthias Miller  00:07
enough. Selling industry,

Speaker 1  00:11
graphic philosophy, clarity shot is the entry point, right? And they stay for the philosophy,

Unknown Speaker  00:25
okay, so

Matthias Miller  00:28
what would it take? So what if I don't even know this just looks I think you're right, and I think having a model that they could visualize would be,

Matthias Miller  00:52
is there a way that we can prune this down where

Unknown Speaker  01:01
you can

Matthias Miller  01:06
they could sit down and spend 15 minutes digesting this and be like,

Unknown Speaker  01:11
I get it.

Speaker 1  01:13
Yeah, and they're like enough that they'd be like, I get it. There's some magic here to talk to you. Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  01:32
I mean, it's almost a, it could almost be a man of manifesto. We type of a,

Speaker 1  01:39
really, that's your philosophy becomes a manifesto, the 100 proof, the 100 proof manifesto.

Matthias Miller  01:52
So we live in Sanctuary, and here's the definition of sanctuary.

Unknown Speaker  01:55
I like that. I

Matthias Miller  02:06
or the 100 proof man in the center is you in the space you live in and create is sanctuary, like they're so tightly intertwined.

Speaker 1  02:22
I personally, I personally think that the model of you receive, you contain and you broadcast is fundamental truth. So you receive from spoken word, you contain yourself, and then

Matthias Miller  02:43
you broadcast, so there's actually a there, and you broadcast, which leads you. And incidentally, maybe this is hyper. Okay, so let's try this, right?

Speaker 1  02:59
And, okay, good. Can we work? Can we work from Sigma?

Unknown Speaker  03:06
Okay, let me create a file if

Matthias Miller  03:10
you want to. Can you share with me?

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  03:16
edit, do. I can edit anyone

Speaker 1  03:38
I'm going to post this in the chat, hopefully. Oh, why can I make I

Matthias Miller  04:03
I always thought bigma was just mock up and workflow. I

Unknown Speaker  04:07
didn't know it was graphic. What's that? I

Matthias Miller  04:10
always thought bigma was just mock up and workflow, oh, maybe I'm not UI, UX design. I didn't

Unknown Speaker  04:21
know it was graphics. Design.

Unknown Speaker  04:28
You can do it, little buddy.

Unknown Speaker  04:30
Well, maybe I should believe it,

Matthias Miller  04:33
sure, but the idea is, you could, you could have a circle around call, you know, receive. I

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Okay,

Matthias Miller  05:10
I still don't like, I know we've been down this road.

Unknown Speaker  05:20
You still don't like what

Matthias Miller  05:21
spoken truth to just without context. It's too affirmation. It should have a more revelatory

Unknown Speaker  05:31
Bentley

Matthias Miller  05:39
style. Well, I mean, but my pillar is union with it.

Unknown Speaker  05:59
Yeah, I Yeah.

Speaker 1  06:07
Okay, so for now, let's okay. You said you wanted, you wanted a circle.

Matthias Miller  06:15
My thought was what you're describing could be a growth, like a like, circular arrows. Circular arrows, like you receive truth, you embody it, or you,

Speaker 1  06:36
oh, yeah, my, my model was like, was, uh, um,

Unknown Speaker  06:56
I mean, ultimately, you receive, you contain, like there's an arrow and then out,

Matthias Miller  07:10
right? But what I'm thinking is it's like a circular arrow going from, you know, one quadrant to the next, three arrows, circular, kind of arc, arrows going around the outside. I

Speaker 2  07:26
don't know how to describe it if I'm making sense,

Speaker 1  07:30
maybe, maybe you actually need to edit it.

Unknown Speaker  07:37
It's not loading for me for some reason. Let me turn on my ad block and see if,

Unknown Speaker  07:40
what if I Okay, tell me where to put the arrows. Oh, there we

Matthias Miller  07:46
go. Um, do you how do what? Well, I mean, like, Here, I'll show you. Should be one going from here to here.

Speaker 1  07:58
Oh, oh yeah, it's the I understand. I understand. I You might ask, you might ask, like planet Perry support for the template to that,

Unknown Speaker  08:21
because I mean, maybe, maybe I created one one time, but it's, you're right, it's the it's a bending, it's a circular arrow. I understand that it's like the recycle arrow on the trash can, right? Okay, and but what direction you have it? What's the first what's the starting point?

Matthias Miller  08:58
You receive from truth to self, you embody, from self to strategy, from strategy to truth. Again, you it's like, execute, but it's not really arrows. It's like,

Unknown Speaker  09:11
it's a flow.

Matthias Miller  09:14
It is like a flow. I

Matthias Miller  09:27
yeah, that doesn't look like some kind of weird, non religious symbol that'll get me into trouble. I don't know what this

Unknown Speaker  09:42
i Well, for now I can cheat. I.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Is that what you want? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  10:09
yeah, something like that. And you could conceivably,

Speaker 1  10:15
what is this helping? I guess I'm curious, like, how is this helping? But what's the

Matthias Miller  10:21
I don't know. I'm trying to integrate your model, but I'm not even sure that we need to integrate your model, the receive, contain, release. I

Matthias Miller  11:00
i really like it. I like the simple.

Speaker 1  11:07
Tell me I'm wrong. Simple is best, like this is great, right here.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
Yeah, that's too simple. No, just kidding.

Matthias Miller  11:22
And the word the should be removed union with. And we could put, yeah, you could. You could title this whole thing sanctuary and the 100 proof view. No. I mean title, the very title.

Unknown Speaker  11:56
My gosh, that went to his i

Matthias Miller  12:10
Isn't there a word with sharing or I would keep sanctuary? I

Unknown Speaker  12:25
would you say we just

Matthias Miller  12:28
keep sanctuary in the middle? I

Unknown Speaker  12:46
What?

Unknown Speaker  12:51
Either way, there we go. Keep sanctuary in the middle.

Matthias Miller  12:56
Well, I mean, I don't know, show me what you're doing once,

Speaker 1  12:59
I thought there might Be a context where you do, it's

Unknown Speaker  13:05
it's both review,

Speaker 1  13:33
I like, I like the simple, clean, yeah, you know what?

Matthias Miller  13:39
Okay, that's why we suggested, I meant to suggest, just maybe page title or something. That's what I was trying to communicate.

Speaker 1  13:44
Okay, this is one of my favorite diagrams.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
Maybe it's i

Speaker 1  14:07
i can have, you can have something like this, plus this equals sanctuary, or equals equals, equals 100 per year, right? I uh, there's another wealth with God. There's another visual, this one that I really like, right sanctuaries here, or 100 proof view,

Unknown Speaker  14:44
which is a.

Matthias Miller  15:00
I have a question. Mr. Miyagi, am I?

Matthias Miller  15:22
Are we sure that sanctuary is not the bonsai store, for lack of a better term that they come into to be mentored into this, and that the center of the triangle was actually 100 preview.

Speaker 1  15:47
Well, typically, typically in the models that I developed for people, it's, it's

Unknown Speaker  15:59
sanctuary. Uh, sanctuary goes here too, right, you know? And you call it this, the sanctuary CEO. And then here you have sanctuary CEO, right? Like, that's, that's typically the way I would do it,

Matthias Miller  16:22
typically, you wouldn't have two terms you're fighting with is what you're

Speaker 1  16:28
saying, right? It'd be, it'd be one in the same the title. So one way, one way of thinking about this, is 100 proof. You, and then 100, 100 proof, 100 proof you. Okay,

Matthias Miller  16:56
this is the outcome right here, which you described. There's the process by which people experience that, which are the sanctuary sessions in which you enter in and experience my 100 proof me, so that you can become your under perfume. Does

Matthias Miller  17:35
that make sense or no,

Speaker 1  17:38
this is the outcome. Sanctuary is the process.

Matthias Miller  17:44
For the vehicle. It's barely a process. It's a series of experiences. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  17:53
well, that's good, okay,

Speaker 2  18:00
um, I think

Matthias Miller  18:13
sanctuary, no,

Speaker 1  18:16
oh, sorry, I'm this is waiting. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, no, no, but, okay, I that makes sense to me. It's just, it's just, here's the thing. I I, I agree. Because the issue is, I'm almost, I'm trying. It's like, you're, there's two, there's two separate things that we're selling, and they're, they're overlapped, right? What? There's this. So

Unknown Speaker  19:00
go ahead, yes,

Matthias Miller  19:01
but let's leave the overlap a secret. I think that's where I've tried to over explain the overlap is a secret. And as they get to know me, they're like, wait a minute, this guy's doing there's there's nuance and depth to what this guy's doing. So I think what we they connected out what we're doing is here is the model. This is who you need to become. And if you,

Unknown Speaker  19:26
yeah, this is, if that's

Matthias Miller  19:29
great. Andrew,

Speaker 1  19:31
proof is the is the promised land. That's the aspirational identity they want. And so one, one way of looking at this was, I remember the reason why I like the triangles was because it, it kind of had a structural like, it's geometrical and and you're like, I. It looks like a temple. So I'm not sure you even need to add a word, but you're saying like sanctuary, is the way into this. Yes, that I would say I kind of liked, okay, here's one thought.

Speaker 1  20:40
I'm sure you, I'm sure you, you are, you already have the fuller, fuller model that prepares DNA. I'm not sure where that is, but I'm I'm just going to use, I'm just going to use this as an example. So possibly what needs to happen later on is under preview, and then sanctuary is like. Sanctuary is here between

Speaker 1  21:22
truth. I don't know if there's a world where that makes sense. The issue is sanctuary can also give you collaborative strategy so

Matthias Miller  21:39
loosely I want to avoid over engineering and over complicating, which and I'm slightly impatient and not frustrated. I'm just impatient, and I want to get this out the doors. And so let's so I agree that there could be new ones with triangles. Sanctuary, in my opinion, as we discussed, could be environmental, it could be emotional, it could be spiritual. It could be a lot of it could be it could be cognitive. It could be, there's a lot of things that it could be. I still think keeping it simple, it's here is the 100 proof you. People aren't looking for sanctuary. Sanctuary is you. Here's the basic thing, here's the 100 proof you. Here's who you need to become. And, oh, by the way, if there is a story, I have been to hell and back, to create a space where you can enter into to formulate this and actually hear your own thoughts, not hear your own thoughts, but here, but to discover union with truth, and so will you end up with sanctuary?

Unknown Speaker  22:51
Possibly,

Speaker 1  22:57
I've got an idea. Let's just create two triangles. Okay, and they don't know like, oh, by the way, 100 proof you. But secretly, this was the sanctuary.

Matthias Miller  23:12
Truth should be clarity. Thanks.

Speaker 1  23:21
Okay, so, so you could, you could run with this today. Run with this I have good and then, like, literally, this gets mapped onto here

Unknown Speaker  23:35
later. So could we?

Matthias Miller  23:37
Could we do one other thing?

Unknown Speaker  23:40
Yeah, oh,

Matthias Miller  23:41
so you're saying we're selling the sanctuary

Unknown Speaker  23:43
right now on the sanctuary.

Matthias Miller  23:51
Okay, you can make this work if the sanctuary one of these turns into a Venn diagram.

Matthias Miller  24:10
Let me see if I agree with your premise that we're selling a sanctuary you've definitely I like this a lot better

Speaker 1  24:24
that way, we don't have to over engineer it, because it's like you said, it's A secret they'll discover.

Matthias Miller  24:32
But I thought,

Unknown Speaker  24:40
help me. I.

Matthias Miller  25:07
I'm thinking, I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  25:21
So the offer here

Matthias Miller  25:25
to schedule, please enter into the Yes,

Speaker 1  25:27
is this Yes, the outcome, right? So maybe you could almost think of it as two, two programs. You have program one or offer one sanctuary sessions, right? And those are, and then the other one. This is like the community aspect, 100 proof you i

Matthias Miller  26:23
I'm still going to argue, okay, sanctuary is the space

Speaker 1  26:29
or the Inner interval, inner knowing.

Matthias Miller  26:40
Sanctuary is a space that's created that lends these outcomes.

Unknown Speaker  26:54
I think I

Matthias Miller  27:04
I think the way that you describe this, maybe just that all we need to do is throw this triangle. I mean, we can have more copy around being too busy to hear yourself all always taking orders from somebody else, all this other kinds of stuff. But

Speaker 1  27:22
I think all you what, if you just focus on the positive and not necessarily identify all the life circumstances, is that where you're going.

Unknown Speaker  27:41
Yes,

Matthias Miller  27:44
sanctuary is a space that I think the sanctuary model could go on the homepage.

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Great. And I

Matthias Miller  28:05
and, you know, today, I want you to experience this gift and the truth, or, you know, it could be changed, but experience clarity, and then this is the place outside of all the busyness, where you hear, you know, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I think, a little tweak, and you can slap this sanctuary triangle on the homepage. The

Speaker 1  28:30
reason why I like this, it's a direct connect to from Winton, yep. And down the road, this doesn't need to be the main page, 100 proof main page. Right?

Unknown Speaker  29:00
But this is very clean,

Unknown Speaker  29:03
extremely

Speaker 1  29:06
and it's not some of this. It's what I like about it is some of this is interesting, but might need some explanation.

Unknown Speaker  29:15
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  29:20
and I like that. It's three, C's one word,

Matthias Miller  29:23
boom. Couldn't apply any better. Look

Speaker 1  29:26
at that. Okay, all of my pickiness is satisfied. Look at

Matthias Miller  29:30
that. We just had a very productive argument. You can have you can't have it all. I

Matthias Miller  29:52
All right, so let's go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  29:54
I will. What do we want? This? A title to be well, I

Matthias Miller  30:05
mean, I don't know that it needs a title. I'm already like here. I'm going to edit this page a little bit comfort is going away.

Speaker 1  30:13
Courage to your biggest I like connection. I

Matthias Miller  30:33
Oh, yeah, but just just like this, okay, no, yeah, just like that is right, okay, but then I'm going to save this, the One thing that I need On the homepage

Unknown Speaker  30:51
is I'm

Unknown Speaker  31:31
I've got I

Speaker 1  31:43
maybe it's not a perfect triangle I used, I guess. I guess I could make, I like it, I like the way it stretches, but I could make the peak a little lower. I

Speaker 1  32:05
Okay, maybe I just need to. I

Unknown Speaker  32:53
What Are you thinking now? Yeah, I

Speaker 1  33:21
I clearly, clearly, you should be doing something else with your time, because I'm not well, let's,

Matthias Miller  33:29
let's, if you want to, can you just put this on a back burner, and can we jump over to The homepage? And I feel like, okay, so refresh.

Unknown Speaker  33:50
Maybe refresh now. Okay,

Matthias Miller  33:59
the do you like the connection wording?

Speaker 1  34:02
Well, I I think, can you can say connection with your authentic self really easily.

Unknown Speaker  34:11
That's clarity

Matthias Miller  34:13
to your biggest question. Give

Unknown Speaker  34:15
like connection is a very human word. I

Unknown Speaker  34:28
connection with yourself,

Unknown Speaker  34:35
we I?

Matthias Miller  34:58
All right? Your refresh again?

Speaker 1  35:04
Yeah, great, eight minutes and seven minutes. Oh, oh, but this is for the 15 minutes. This needs to become, kind of need two pages, I guess, one for LinkedIn, which is the 15 minutes, and then one for one for what the scheduled? The scheduled?

Matthias Miller  35:35
Great. We need to spec this out,

Unknown Speaker  35:39
and I need the payment links.

Matthias Miller  35:42
I texted them to you, yeah, yesterday,

Speaker 1  35:45
one was broken and need to it's kind of hard to bring it for my phone over.

Speaker 2  35:53
Oh, got it.

Matthias Miller  36:01
Let me just email them over to you.

Speaker 1  36:03
And we almost had, we almost had for

Speaker 1  36:18
we'll call this the shot, maybe we need,

Unknown Speaker  36:27
I don't know what you okay. This is the third shot. Not sure what you want to call these,

Unknown Speaker  36:48
but

Unknown Speaker  36:53
I like sanctuary today.

Unknown Speaker  37:01
Oh, do you not have a one hour option? No, you see you want, okay,

Matthias Miller  37:07
I don't want a one hour

Speaker 1  37:09
sanctuary taster. I that's what I had, sure. And then sanction, and then just have sanctuary. I was

Speaker 1  37:26
going to call this plus, if you had a different one, a one hour

Matthias Miller  37:33
experience, it's almost like

Unknown Speaker  37:38
taster Sure.

Unknown Speaker  37:45
Yeah, I think that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  37:58
I like that because taste your experience goes, and do I say full day or just day day? Yeah, so, so explanation for this would go above what these, all of these are. So by the time they see the button? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:29
great.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
Very nice. If this is working now I

Speaker 1  38:48
I mean, do you want pictures above these? Or do you want me to find us some kind of icon that describes the day experience? I

Matthias Miller  38:57
think icons are probably fine. Okay,

Matthias Miller  39:12
okay, here's what I've done, same a stickler for decoupling in the if you go to just go to settings for 301, redirects.

Speaker 1  39:36
This on on I'm on the settings tab in WordPress, and

Matthias Miller  39:42
then go down to three or 301. Regards,

Unknown Speaker  39:44
Oh, I see, okay.

Matthias Miller  39:48
And just copy the link. Copy slash pay, slash 2h. Lym, I just added these in. But that way, if you want to switch out the payment link, we can do that without pay. Go through the whole site,

Unknown Speaker  40:01
right?

Unknown Speaker  40:20
I guess I did have the same links.

Unknown Speaker  40:24
Hello, what's up?

Speaker 1  40:28
The only link I didn't have was the sanctuary

Unknown Speaker  40:33
experience 15 minutes schedule, okay, okay,

Speaker 1  40:38
and I have open new tab on all of these good

Matthias Miller  40:51
and Audre and I talked about it, I think we're going to

Unknown Speaker  40:57
on The the

Matthias Miller  40:59
one days are difficult enough to schedule. We're just going to say, look, we're going to reach out to you within the next two business days and get this on the calendar as soon as possible.

Unknown Speaker  41:10
Yeah, it's just, it's too much to there's too

Matthias Miller  41:15
much complexity to try to keep those open spaces.

Speaker 1  41:18
Well, part of me thinks you say, Hey, we could do this as a six or four hours and then two hours after in 30 days. I really like that.

Matthias Miller  41:39
Do it as a your choice between six and four plus two,

Speaker 1  41:46
because it's nice. It's always nice to have a debrief, right?

Matthias Miller  41:50
Well, I mean, but shouldn't we always just do a, include a 30 minute debrief, 30 days from now?

Unknown Speaker  42:01
Right? But, but what? Right?

Speaker 1  42:06
But then you wouldn't have to build for it. I should say it's build it. You wouldn't have to give it, get it away. If it's part

Unknown Speaker  42:17
of the two hour,

Speaker 1  42:19
that's like a nice you. Yes, the 30 minute is already built into the extra two hour.

Matthias Miller  42:29
Why would we raise it to

Speaker 1  42:37
like to me, part of part of the line item for this full day is that you you'd get, You get telegram access,

Unknown Speaker  42:50
right, and

Unknown Speaker  42:53
then you have,

Unknown Speaker  43:02
you you'd have a,

Speaker 1  43:09
I don't know, I think that's a nice lead in to another two hours. It's, it's, it's just something to float by them. I

Matthias Miller  43:24
The other way to do telegram access is

Unknown Speaker  43:28
okay, well,

Matthias Miller  43:32
I would rather

Matthias Miller  43:40
increase the price slightly,

Unknown Speaker  43:43
and

Matthias Miller  43:46
I guess I would, yeah, do, do, and do A one hour debrief in 30 days.

Unknown Speaker  44:01
Okay, great.

Matthias Miller  44:07
And then, but within you know, what is it? What do we do? Is it 3500 Is it three grand? Well,

Unknown Speaker  44:20
I would, I would say 30 550% off is

Matthias Miller  44:29
we're not doing 50 offs. We're doing 500 off okay. Do

Unknown Speaker  44:49
well, just do 3000

Matthias Miller  44:58
Yeah, I mean, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  45:04
Okay, so there's 3001 time payment. Just,

Speaker 1  45:17
well, I maybe, before we do a bunch of payment stuff, the page needs to be built out with all the line items

Matthias Miller  45:26
that would make sense. All right, so let's we got about 45 minutes to get it done. Let me I want to make one change on the thank you page Before I forget. And we Were going to Say, I

Speaker 1  47:12
I put the the sanctuary model as a JPEG or Png on the main page.

Matthias Miller  47:19
Instinctively, It's a PNG. Okay? PNG.

Matthias Miller  47:42
Okay, all right, one

Unknown Speaker  48:20
day, two hours. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  48:24
do you want to spin up a Google Doc for me in the folder while I check one other thing here?

Unknown Speaker  48:32
Sorry. Do I want to send a create a Google doc

Matthias Miller  48:37
to start working on the page content?

Unknown Speaker  48:40
Yeah. Do that. I

Unknown Speaker  49:47
All right, I got to put

Unknown Speaker  49:52
right there. Anyone can add it. I.

Matthias Miller  53:26
Do you have

Unknown Speaker  53:28
that to the document we can start tearing into?

Speaker 1  53:35
Yeah, I think that sentencing. I Wait,

Matthias Miller  53:58
did you? You said you did create it?

Unknown Speaker  54:00
Yeah, it's you should look check your email.

Unknown Speaker  54:08
There it is, right,

Matthias Miller  54:12
all right. You want to throw the titles in you.

Matthias Miller  54:39
So easy way to start is I'm.

Matthias Miller  55:41
I don't know what this Is. I

Unknown Speaker  56:04
What did? What does Josh call his one on one, Telegram

Matthias Miller  56:12
or signal? It's signal. It's like he calls it memos.

Unknown Speaker  56:16
No, really. Josh. Love, I can look at that bottle.

Unknown Speaker  56:41
Oh, you're right. Memo access. It's

Unknown Speaker  56:49
kind of funny. It's not what I would picture for that kind of object. Memos from Josh.

Matthias Miller  56:59
It was from Josh.

Unknown Speaker  57:06
Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  57:27
What

Unknown Speaker  57:34
do $1,000 value.

Matthias Miller  58:10
We've been saying that's $100 value, but or it's a higher value, and we off sell it for 100 I

Unknown Speaker  58:33
private telegram.

Unknown Speaker  58:36
Well, you could just say one,

Unknown Speaker  58:40
we why I'm

Unknown Speaker  58:49
not sure if you need, do you need to do this for

Matthias Miller  58:51
the No, not necessarily, All right, because they're not bonuses. Yep, I

Matthias Miller  59:21
Oh, anyway, this is good. My thing. My buddy about my Facebook post last night about if you're the CEO of GM or second in command, he says, I think if you can address the emptiness these people feel when they leave the rat race, or understanding the feeling of, is this all it is like to achieve this level, and what's the purpose of what I'm doing? Might be the place to start. I've got a great story for that. In high school, I did my junior in a freshman and sophomore year in one year. And. Was recognized at the end of school, and I remember this moment of standing up, you know, for the applause, for, you know, what I achieved. And there was that moment that was, like, I did all that, and this is what I get, like, is this it? And I think that's a kind of a universal, like, I don't know. I've had these all amazing, these amazing wins for people. And Wait, was that? Is that all it was, yeah, and is there really anything to like, I mean, what? Anyway,

Speaker 1  1:00:41
so those are good stories. Maybe, maybe you could say, ask clients include, like, some kind of who this is for by pointing to past clients,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
so I haven't had

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
any mark. Griffey, I thought you've done. No, I've been well, let's, let's, what's, what's all this, 234,

Matthias Miller  1:01:40
they didn't do the one day.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:43
Oh, no, no, this is just at the very top.

Matthias Miller  1:01:45
Oh, past clients. Oh, um, oh, I get this.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
Um, like that. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
see coos,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
let's do this guy. Who's he?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
Can you say former company presidents? Former President of company? Is there a way of making this plural? I

Matthias Miller  1:02:44
I mean, but does it care, at what stage this is the, probably the accurate side. Didn't 20 plus year in tech, doing everything from design engineer to CEO and several companies. I mean, I think we could say

Speaker 2  1:03:03
serial entrepreneurs, yeah, I like good can consultants to top, top 1% of businesses,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
you just need three, yeah, three lines, CEOs. And serial entrepreneurs, I don't think you need former presidents.

Speaker 1  1:03:39
Maybe second and key words, goes above, consultants, lieutenants, second in commands, yeah, there you go.

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
I mean, this could be GM, COO, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:04:02
That immediately elevates the reading. And by the way, you could have, you could have if, if this was going to beyond Perry's list, I would say Mark Rishi, dash, $30 million man,

Matthias Miller  1:04:26
so I mean, I haven't done it for Mark, but I could say mark. I want to add you to the list. You want to

Speaker 1  1:04:31
do this with me? Wait, wait, I thought Who was the guy who was on your Scheduler page?

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
Mark. Gregory, Mark. Jeffrey, Mark. Jeffrey, Mark,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
a different mark.

Matthias Miller  1:04:46
Very different mark.

Speaker 1  1:04:48
Okay, clearly I should, of all people, I should know my marks.

Matthias Miller  1:04:57
Which one are you again? Kidding?

Speaker 1  1:04:59
I get, I get confused. Um, okay, great. This is

Matthias Miller  1:05:04
then there's Mark Ingles, and there's also Mark, what's the roofing Mark? Mark Shirley,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
I know there's three big marks.

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
You're in good company, man.

Speaker 1  1:05:11
Okay, well, I gotta distinguish myself as Marcos. So Marcos, okay, I That's funny because I don't run, I don't run into other marks, because there's a lot here is it? This is this is looking good. I like the past clients. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:47
why now, maybe has like a why? Now, why? You know why? Now I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
I think you just, this is where you say, hey, like, this is a very volatile time. I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:06:18
I The, this is, this is the value conversation, kind of like, what's the value of? Is there like a financial value you could attach to this? Like, that's what's the value of? Some of people's past decisions.

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
Well, I mean, I guess you could, I mean, we could also, I mean, I don't know, helping, a

Matthias Miller  1:07:06
I don't know how to articulate the like, I don't go back and I say, oh yeah. Like, I need this guy 100 grand in two hours. Okay. I mean, the closest thing I have to that is, you know, helping a salesperson clear 2 million in their first year of sales when their sales manager set a million dollar goal. Well, but that's not speaking to the target. So why now?

Speaker 1  1:07:39
Maybe this is your 100 proof you proof pitch,

Speaker 1  1:07:51
or the the missing, missing 5% pitch or the I?

Speaker 1  1:08:03
Maybe this is the sharpen your intuition, your the inner knowing for guidance. Well maybe, maybe this goes on the previous page. Maybe, maybe you don't need to go in, but eventually, the more copy you add this page, the better.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
More clear I

Matthias Miller  1:08:50
I don't know. I don't know why now,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
I mean, maybe a

Unknown Speaker  1:09:05
scary times, times you need you need signal,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:14
not noise.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:17
You need an you need a let me, let me show you. Show me. Let me show you, the guy who I think is the pricing master. Ah, oh, yeah, I have to find the page. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
Okay. Now I lost you. There we go. Oh, or am I sharing my I'm not sharing my screen.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
Why did I receive the payment page still resume. Okay, let's do this.

Speaker 1  1:10:30
All right. Did it resign? I Okay, so he, I was trying to design it a little bit after him with the bottom. I thought was really clear. I really like that, yep, but, but this is what he does. I noticed something different that he does is he prices the highest one first, yep. So that you get all the bonuses right, and then you can pick your package right. But boom, boom, boom, boom. Isn't that nice,

Matthias Miller  1:11:18
yep, but it's all crossed out beautifully. He

Unknown Speaker  1:11:21
has testimonials, right?

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
I need to get my one day, my my testimonials.

Speaker 1  1:11:29
So, I mean, this is like a fuller version. This is a fuller build out, but I thought that was beautifully done. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
I could still, I could send you this link if you want. I'll post in the

Unknown Speaker  1:11:54
documents.

Matthias Miller  1:11:57
I mean, I'm still all for I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
call me reckless. I

Matthias Miller  1:12:37
do you do limit one per person,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:40
and people start taking advantage of it all.

Speaker 1  1:12:46
No, I think, no, there's no, there's no bonus. For these guys, they're pay what you want. That's that's the best.

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
Well, it's what I'm it's not pay what you want. It's pay what you can, know,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:02
what you can. Okay if

Matthias Miller  1:13:07
it hurts a little for you.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:11
Recommended

Matthias Miller  1:13:14
or value. Just put value if we're doing I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:30
let me just

Speaker 2  1:13:38
two hour at one 250 value, it's 250 value.

Speaker 1  1:13:44
Oh, you change this to 1000 isn't it? 2000 I don't know you're right. We're good, we're good. 250 value.

Matthias Miller  1:13:55
I mean, for this page is right,

Speaker 1  1:14:02
and they get $500 off right,

Speaker 2  1:14:08
which is still a especially on the two hours, a wildly great deal.

Speaker 2  1:14:19
I and why now, okay, are

Matthias Miller  1:14:29
you comfortable with what you need for these guys? Sorry, are you good with what you need for these guys?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
I'm not sure what you mean by goodwith.

Matthias Miller  1:14:41
I mean, like, do you I guess, what else? Wait. Do we need to keep this line in there? I don't know what onboarding is going to look like

Speaker 1  1:14:53
yet. Oh, like, Can I start building out the page with this? Yeah, right. That's, yeah, that's fine. It's. So then and I tacitly, like I in napkin approval, yes, this looks good.

Matthias Miller  1:15:11
Okay, so then the why now still is the biggest thing to do.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:25
I mean one reason why now is,

Speaker 1  1:15:38
I mean special, special discount for for Planet parity, Like, obviously the page would change. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:15:55
I mean, I

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
and now I don't like hey, we're gonna grow you should go do it now. But I um, but I mean, it's not, it's not a lie either. I think this thing, I think this is legs,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:32
and

Matthias Miller  1:16:36
it's the cheapest and most available that I'm likely to ever be. Well, I know it's a little bit of a bold statement in the future, but maybe that's not fair. Well,

Speaker 1  1:16:47
okay, maybe we just need to go through Here's an idea. Let's pull out the promotions checklists. Here you go. And then we, you know what, which one I'm talking about. I've seen it

Unknown Speaker  1:17:09
before. I don't know that we got access to it.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
I do.

Matthias Miller  1:17:20
Mcgi gave me his pass password to his account at one point, like, whoa, I've got the whole halt, really. McGee once gave me the password to his entire to his to his membership account. I didn't really think it was ethical to go digging through everything, but I was like, wow, I could have the whole thing, and I wanted to. I

Unknown Speaker  1:18:11
Okay, well, I

Unknown Speaker  1:18:24
I guess what I could do is I

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
I'll just paste it at the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:53
Does that work?

Matthias Miller  1:19:02
That would distracted. Mark Jeffrey has done something with high performance sports.

Matthias Miller  1:19:13
You probably even you could potentially say top 1% of businesses and athletes, but I don't know if that's true.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:21
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:19:29
our deadline, we're not doing that consequences if you miss,

Speaker 1  1:19:34
okay, well, one of the well, limited quantity. We already listed that, but we can, let's put it in the taster, right, limited quantity. So.

Speaker 1  1:20:12
Yeah, for early action. Well, that's kind of the limited quantity. I Oh, okay, the first, the first, the first five clients can get, can get telegram access. How about that,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:43
for which one and for how long?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:48
Well, shoot, I like it built into the offer, But

Unknown Speaker  1:20:58
so let's not i

Unknown Speaker  1:21:18
Is there a guarantee? I

Matthias Miller  1:21:23
I'll be fine doing one get 15 minutes. You know, first 15 minutes you can get your or something like that

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
on a two hour. And you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:38
it's saying The first 30 minutes, I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23
I mean, whatever This word is,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:25
We Can I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:26
I'll do what I can to get you taken care of or something i

Matthias Miller  1:24:04
i hate the second concession, where it was going was if you continue past the 30 minutes, you know we're assuming that you're there because you're getting value. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:24:19
you know what? Are you saying about if that, what's the then? Sorry, what? What's the then, if you continue past 30 minutes,

Matthias Miller  1:24:31
then we will assume that you're happy with what you're getting and you're delighted to spend money.

Speaker 1  1:24:36
No, you don't need to put it, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:48
and and our full refund and our and our what's best wishes are. Or

Unknown Speaker  1:25:08
here, let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:12
You can add a search. You can add the session,

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
okay, I don't know. I don't know that. I want to, okay, this is what I'm after. I want them to know you have to stop, for crying out loud, you're not going to get to the I didn't like the first 30 minutes. Like you can end the session early and walk away with a full refund. And I'm not going to say we're going to be friends. Excuse me. I don't want to be a jerk, but you might be the jerk. Maybe we can't be friends, but I'm still going to treat you respectfully, and maybe we're going to be friends. It's just not a fit. I don't know. Again, that's probably too much truth telling for marketing speak, but that's kind of how I feel

Speaker 1  1:25:59
about it. I respect your time, your time and then in time and, and I'm here to get you results or something. Yep,

Matthias Miller  1:26:16
I respect your time and, and I will do, I will do a restrictive time, and I will do what's in my power to give you the best possible experience or to get you the best possible result, best possible experience, I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:36
don't know. I

Speaker 1  1:26:57
I'm not sure if I like that will do anything in my power. I and here in here to give the give a give a positive experience. Give

Speaker 1  1:27:14
here for you, for you like to help them win or get a result. I you.

Matthias Miller  1:27:25
Okay, here's the fine line. My sales call yesterday, I sort of asked the guy, so how would you feel if this came down to relinquishing some of your control over the outcome.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:47
Terrified, and

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
my concern is two things, you are not coming. You do not come to the sanctuary, telling the sanctuary what you need and and the the outcomes. I don't what is this? I trust the process. I believe the process is going to produce value and outcomes, but

Speaker 1  1:28:24
this is a rare This is a rare experience. Is not for everyone. This is a unique experience.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:36
Yep, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:28:46
Okay, so here's what I would do.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
Ah,

Matthias Miller  1:29:10
I mean, and I had somebody frame the call saying they're, you know, very skeptical and the open or latent. I And I think, and I basically recipient it was like, Look, if at any time I'm making you uncomfortable with this, like you have the freedom to interrupt me. Like, go ahead. Like it all right, can

Unknown Speaker  1:29:37
you say that again? Yeah, I've got a trash truck. Okay, you're good.

Matthias Miller  1:29:46
There we go. I don't need a trash truck. Just your voice being funny. I heard somebody who, by their own admission, were open, but very, extremely skeptical. I. And, you know? And I basically reciprocated. I'm like, hey, look like, if, if at any time, let's give it, give it a whirl. And if at any time you're uncomfortable, like, just holler. And it ended up being an incredibly positive time together. But I think that's, this is exactly what we're doing. I just like how it's right, that's all I'm saying.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:26
Make our time together.

Speaker 1  1:30:33
Our tender is positive false. Make our time your time together together as positive for you as possible. However, if you can, I just say if you aren't delighted, however, yeah, okay. If

Unknown Speaker  1:31:04
a unique experience, guarantee, sure.

Speaker 1  1:31:18
If you're guaranteeing a unique experience, well, it's just like, hey, if it's not okay, that works, all Right.

Speaker 1  1:31:33
Okay, we have a unique offer, unique Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:46
Specific problem solves,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:53
not sure,

Speaker 1  1:32:00
immediate result. That's the thing. Why Now this gets immediate results.

Matthias Miller  1:32:06
Okay, so the useful

Speaker 1  1:32:08
this is the just add. Why now the useful components.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:15
Okay, why now, by

Matthias Miller  1:32:21
