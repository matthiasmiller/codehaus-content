Hi, hey, compass item code mapping.

Speaker 1  00:34
Did you Did did you when you were when you were able to do compensated when you were doing compensated kidnapping? I know you can't this whole thing has been kind of abandoned. Right? Were you getting colors on Slyke exciting colors

Matthias Miller  00:52
last from the past?

Speaker 1  00:54
Or or was our did we get the? Or is the only reason I have some of that information based on when you did A a PDF scrape on STI

Matthias Miller  01:07
buildings? No, it was not a PDF scrape, you would have encompass mapping.

Speaker 1  01:11
So is it possible to rerun that and get and get the historical information?

Matthias Miller  01:24
Probably,

Speaker 1  01:25
or, or okay, I've dug through your compass item code mapping. So every so often I get these requests from, from insight for usage, reports of say siding or Windows or any numbers of things. siding is one of those things that comes that I have codes from SDI, unlike VB 12, you know, 1216 or something like that, but I don't Is there was there color codes that went along with that

Unknown Speaker  01:59
too. I don't know without.

Speaker 1  02:04
But I mean, I dug through your configuration stuff. And I didn't see color coding. So I was curious where you were getting color coding from? And if it can't be done, it can't be done. Whatever. I'll just you know, I'll just tell him

Unknown Speaker  02:18
to map wall color. Do you know how long it's been? No. A long time

Matthias Miller  02:28
they've done this. The reports don't even run anymore. It was May I mean I think the short answer is well let me see if I can get you a short answer.

Unknown Speaker  02:39
So the building

Speaker 1  02:42
building compass map wall color expression. Let me look at

Matthias Miller  02:45
that. We have we have a wall color. We have a trim color. We have a roof color.

Unknown Speaker  02:50
Is that an expression? Oh gee. Yeah, you are building compass map color. G All right. Well, no, no. Oh, there it is.

Matthias Miller  03:03
I mean, if we actually believe in this, we should.

Speaker 1  03:06
I don't know. Okay, so here's here's the here's the overarching reason Ohio's about to go off and reevaluate all of their siding colors and wall color paint colors, all on that stuff, all that stuff on district x I have 100% access to on all that information. SDI is the sketchy one but you did all this fancy mapping and so forth. So and I really don't want to take up your time if you can send me off in a direction to try and figure it out. I'll be glad to try and chase everyone figured out texture color compass colors

Matthias Miller  03:39
here. Here's what you could do. I don't know if well here in sight okay short answer is like I'm literally need to walk out of the office like now but

Unknown Speaker  03:54
what you can sorry oh my goodness how about this?

Unknown Speaker  04:07
Are you are you are you working tomorrow? Are you out?

Matthias Miller  04:10
I'm out tomorrow Give me one second okay

Speaker 2  04:29
wait a minute where does he store this input variables? skews item colors? Oh darn it Oh, that's not even a building. Oh, ah item coats. Here is

Matthias Miller  04:47
here's this stuff. Oh no, I do have it. Please don't run the inputs.

Unknown Speaker  04:51
Huh? No, no, no, I

Speaker 1  04:53
forgot that. I forgot what Okay, the building item codes has this map. I can map this nevermind it just

Matthias Miller  05:00
Okay, live. Yeah, you're right. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:02
no, it's on the building record.

Speaker 1  05:06
Well, this is well, it depends on whether this is what you pushed it the building item codes are G, is that information you push? Or is that get tracked every single time? Building records building on the building record the item codes are G under cost tracking.

Unknown Speaker  05:26
Is that tracked every

Speaker 1  05:27
single time or is that is the building I'm looking at something you pushed?

Matthias Miller  05:34
Go look at the settings for the x 30 that really emphasize a mapping x 30. Actually,

Speaker 1  05:42
okay, you know, I have enough information to go dig on this. So, you go back to whatever you're doing. I'm good. I'll look at what you said to me, and I'll see if I can, if anything goes any further. Okay, sounds good.
