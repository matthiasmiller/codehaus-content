For one more follow up thing I've been reading breakthrough advertising which is like one of the almost like the Bible of direct marketing, one of the things he talks about is that you cannot actually create a market desire you can only exploit the market. And see, look at the people who've been most successful with your software projects like the one innate desire that they have is, is for system ization. That's not something that we can instill in somebody it's only something that we can capture So the real question is, how do we capitalize on that and that's what's kind of like the unique thing, and. And so, I mean if if you have somebody who is initiating and follow through or has a strong follow through bent. There's 100% going to be that kind of a desire for that. And then if they're in a custom type of business, there's going to be that frustration. And, like I feel like that's where we are as a business ourselves but it's it's it's kind of the the breakthrough that we're looking to create for ourselves, but it's also the breakthrough that we can create for other people and helping them remove that obstacle.
