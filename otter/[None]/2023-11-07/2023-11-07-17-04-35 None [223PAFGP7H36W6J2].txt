Hey, so I would like to spend some time working on a project plan for you to sheds. So we can block out some time for that on Friday. And I would also like to have a two hour time block on a Friday in in December, preferably towards the beginning to do a handoff of bookkeeping from Amber to Ben. And so it should involve myself Amber and Ben. And I think that's it
