I don't know that I have what I need to get to Tim and Ben. Today, but I think I could get some stuff put together tomorrow that we can get over to them. And they can work on that Thursday morning, if there is if there are things that need to be done. One thing that I would like to add to my agenda with Ellis is to talk about the think Inc accounting project. And whether we want to use the inventory management module or whether we want to do that completely custom. Also, I will need to reschedule my call with Tim today. I would do it sometime Friday morning at the beginning of his workday, it's fine by me if it's pretty early in my morning. I can take that call on the road. One thing that I would like to talk to him about is about rent and office space wince when he moves. And I'm going into a meeting here with Yoda sheds so I won't be able to do our morning standup but I will probably want to talk with you about putting together a project plan for the shed for your sheds. So yeah, if there are urgent issues, we'll have to address them by text later today. Also, it might be good to text or email Amber and Tim, and let them know that there's a chance that I will not be able to make the financial heartbeat call. I'm going to try to make it but there's a possibility that we won't be able to do that.
