Speaker 1  03:26
Hey, good morning Mark, good morning. Matthias, how are you? How are you doing? Well, have a bit of a hit a head cold. But otherwise, yeah, doing. Well, how about you?

Unknown Speaker  03:42
Yes, doing well,

Matthias Miller  03:49
not just a whole lot. Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  03:50
oh no, no, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  03:55
I don't feel like I've got a whole lot to report. But

Speaker 1  04:02
do Dwayne was here first Monday through. He just headed south this morning. So quite a bit of time here.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
And,

Speaker 1  04:16
well, Josh actually stopped in your Monday, which you probably knew doing. What did he call it a dog and pony show? Yeah, I think he called it a dog and pony show up to visualize herself. And then Dwayne was, yeah, it's always good to have him here in person for few days. It seems you can get so much more done, if you look at this face to face meetings and and then, of course, the got all started talking about, hey. Essential conspiracies in the whole Trump assassination attempt, it's just as he saw it. So

Matthias Miller  05:14
there is, I got friends of mine that I respect. They're, they're, you know, it's, it's hard for me to hear some of those theories for about 99% of people, but this guy's got a solid head on him, and at least makes me stop like I at least they'll completely blow it off. So it's interesting. Maybe I'm just maybe I'm too cynical. The other way.

Unknown Speaker  05:49
You mean, like, just not get wrapped up into it and just like,

Speaker 1  05:58
how do you know that that your conspiracy hold any water. Is that what you're Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  06:05
mean, I could, the problem I face is that. I mean, first of all, I mean, I get it. There's people trying to hide. Stuff happens all the time, but I could take anything, any event, my brain works. I can take any event and spin pick facts, and spin the facts in a way to make it look like conspiracy. I think so, at least anyway,

Speaker 1  06:37
yeah, well, I think there's, there's there's probably just as much conspiracy one way as the other way. Like, you know, whether you're far left or far right or it, you know, there's, there's people locally here, there's a lot of people that would say, like, I don't know if you, if you know what Epoch Times is or not.

Matthias Miller  07:06
It's you. It's, I mean, I think you might have seen a cock or two. It's a little publication that goes out,

Speaker 1  07:14
yeah, and it's, it's, it would definitely be the far their version of of truth, of what's happening in the world, and it's, yeah, I earlier this year, I jokingly made a comment, well, I was just jokingly. I just mentioned, like something. I said, Well, we were talking about some event, and I said, Well, let's, let's go to the source of truth, go to the Epoch Times and see what they say. And this guy was, I didn't realize that he was that adamant about it. He said, Well, that is, that is true. I mean, they are the source of truth, and the conversation just kind of petered off, or we didn't get in real deep. But, I mean, who's, who's to say that Tom or all of that is, or is it true?

Unknown Speaker  08:20
I know, right it, I don't know. There's, I don't. I found that being really involved in knowing a lot about that has done me any good

Speaker 1  08:39
way. I like Dwayne's opinion. He says, if he spends too much time with that stuff, he's gone bolt wants to grow and his bean cans grow larger. So

Matthias Miller  08:58
reminds me of this is too completely unrelated, but kind of tangential. It's tangentially connected. Met up with a friend of mine. He was a realtor for many years, and knew knows how to how to make friends with people. That's the bottom line. And and ran his practice with ethics. He'd actually do showings for the realtors, and even write up contracts for other realtors and they were out of town and let them keep, keep everything that was kind of the guy he was, but he and you know, so he knows everybody we're chatting, and somebody stops by and talking about friendships and how far back they go, and one of the guys makes a joke about them having the same parole officer. And my friend said, Yeah, well, he used to make that joke too one time, until the person looked at him. He's like, Oh, who's yours? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  10:00
Definitely make these, make these jokes. Do,

Unknown Speaker  10:04
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  10:07
More more serious. More serious connection is, it's interesting that I've been one of the discussion groups sales discussion groups have been part of people were talking about, you know, how to improve sales calls. And one of the things that came through repeatedly from some of the from some of the top guys, is that they don't bother doing call reviews and their bad calls. They go listen to the calls that went well, and they they listen to those repeatedly, and focus on what works. And I think news intake is can be a lot the same way, rather than what's going wrong with this world, let's fill in mind what's what's going right, and it's probably going to be more helpful in the long run.

Speaker 1  10:59
Well, it is, I think it's even scripture talks about that, that whatsoever, what is the verse? Whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are true of a good report. Think on these things. So, yeah, that's a good point. I didn't, I didn't. Usually, when you the conspiracy stories usually are pretty sinister. So Drew Are you on? Yep, yep. I'm curious. Just my, my, maybe you disagree with me, but I kind of of get the sense that this the community, our community here, a lot of the Amish and Mennonites are Becoming, some extent, more involved in politics and and, you know, then, then also, like taking this, this view of, you know, somebody like Trump is, is What we need to turn this country around. And he shoots straight and says, you know, calls it what it is. And you know, we need someone like that, at the same time, blissfully overlooking the fact that, you know, the lifestyle that that he lives and has lived, is, is is not aligned with our I don't know that. I just, I just,

Speaker 2  12:52
yeah, with that. I think there's more and more people I uhm going to it. I mean, especially, especially, seems like younger people are, I mean, I ran into it some in my school teaching days where I'd be like, yeah, the Mennonites all went out and voted for Nixon too, you know. And, and the Mennonites in Germany voted for Hitler, and like, because he was going to make Germany great again.

Unknown Speaker  13:38
And, like,

Speaker 2  13:43
it seems like every time that our people have been like, oh, this person's gonna set things straight. We need it. We need to back this person up. It has been like, really, really a bad deal. But I presented to my students back in the last election that you know, being Republican is not essentially being Christian, like there's there's two different things here. We're on two different realms.

Unknown Speaker  14:18
So they didn't seem to like that.

Unknown Speaker  14:25
So, yeah, that's a little

Matthias Miller  14:29
What is it about? I mean, there's got to be something about culture, cultural values and the message that connects and resonates. I'm kind of curious what it's always good when, when there's something like that, you're drawn to something. And I think it's always good to ask the question, what is it that pulls you in that direction in the first place? And it might be something. I mean, it's probably something, or often it's something good that's just kind of overextended. It. But I'm kind of curious. What makes me curious, what that is?

Matthias Miller  15:10
Sorry, Martin, you started saying,

Speaker 1  15:13
Oh no, no, I was just curious. What drew is going to say it like what I think what you're asking is, is, what is it that that draws the kind of resonates or draws the people from the conservative community to the republican the republicans that

Matthias Miller  15:38
right? Well, I think even more specifically, it's Hitler, Hitler Nixon Trump. Why those in particular, like, why wasn't it just for example, Bush

Unknown Speaker  15:58
or, I don't know. I

Unknown Speaker  16:06
curious what your thoughts are, Drew,

Unknown Speaker  16:09
well, I don't know.

Speaker 2  16:18
I mean Republican in general, I would say it has to do with our money.

Speaker 2  16:28
My old boss, back when I was working in the truck garage, he always tried to get us to vote. He was a voting man, and he always tried to get us to vote. And finally I told him, Well, if I would, if I would vote, I would vote Democrat, because they help out the employee side of things.

Speaker 2  16:54
But yeah, he also wanted me to go Social Security exempt. So I told him, Well, if I do, will you pay me the seven, whatever it is, 7.3 or whatever percent that's your side of it. Oh, I already pay you too much. It was mostly like, if I look at his thing. It was, well, he was really involved in End Times things, and, you know, the US, Israel relations, and trying to predict what all this stuff means. And like to him, the political world was very connected to establishing what is good and right, like, like the day, the day when, when the Supreme Court essentially ruled to allow gay marriages, I believe, is what it was anyway. He just, it was just, it was just the downfall of America, and America was going to go, go dreadfully terrible. And I was like, well, all it's revealing is what America already thinks like. You know, because those people were voted in for that to make those kinds of rulings, and it's because of how those people align, is why they were placed in that position. I mean, I guess judges aren't necessarily voted in, but people who put to select them or voted in anyway, and it's like it's, it's just aligning the laws with what America really thinks. And you know, while it's not something nice, it's not, it's not the other way around that now America is going to think a certain way. And I don't know, I wonder if that's not a little bit how, where we're where we're headed, or where why people are attracted to them, is we tend to forget that that good is not established by political policy. You know, the the whole Anabaptist view that we normally would have adhered to would be that one would, you know he's right because people in societies are good because of people's hearts being in the right place, not because of laws and and certain leaders and stuff making and forcing people to do right things and have right laws, but and why we're I'm not sure why we are seeming to lose track of that. I.

Matthias Miller  20:00
But isn't there? This is also the temptation within the Anabaptist circles, because you have the broad range of people who say the Anabaptist tradition is, it's cultural, it's an expression of the heart. It's it's all of that. It's just practical obedience. And then you have other people who say, no, no. Like this is, this is how we make sure that people's hearts are in the right place through, through this. I mean, it's, we see that same kind of tension inside, and it's, in a lot of ways, it's, it seems, perhaps taking some of that same thinking and applying it to the government, and it just becomes simplified.

Unknown Speaker  20:48
Probably, is that's fascinating. I

Speaker 2  20:55
don't know. I mean, maybe we, I mean, I know, personally it's, it's a lot easier to think that there will be a lot of good if we just get the right laws in place, you know, people to put the right laws in place, than if I just go talk to my neighbor, you know, I mean, Mark, I think we had that discussion back on on the Ohio abortion thing that was up last fall, or whenever it was, You know, like, are we going to go around try to get everybody to vote that, oh, no, you shouldn't do abortion and have, you know, you should, you should vote a certain way. Or are we just going to go, you know, it's a lot easier to do that than it is and go around and talk to our neighbors about why you shouldn't have an abortion and, you know, or else, help them out if they're in the situation where they can't, you know, they got a baby and they they can't do anything but have an abortion.

Unknown Speaker  21:46
So,

Speaker 1  21:50
yeah, we did have that discussion and and it was, I remember that that that was a good angle to like, people were pretty up in arms about it, because, and I think the only thing that really changed was you could, if you could have illegal abortion later. Well, I don't know you remember that. What was it? How many weeks later? It was pretty much full term.

Speaker 2  22:19
Yeah, that's pretty much changed. That and parental consent for younger people isn't needed anymore. I think, I think it was kind of those two things, and they're probably the world of nuances. But

Speaker 1  22:39
you had pointed out that you know, you know, are we? So we were up in arms about this, but what are we doing about now? If there's an, yeah, just like you said, a needy family, or there's child that doesn't have enough to eat on a nearby city, are we? What are we doing about that I don't know you're probably familiar with. I know some people that are involved with while doing some inner city work with children in Canton Drew. Do you know anybody that goes like helps out at Canton Cross Club? Probably, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:20
yeah.

Speaker 1  23:24
So I'm always, I was just asking the guy that, John that drives me, takes me home in the evening. He his children are involved there, and they're doing this week. They're doing Vacation Bible School with with inner city children in Canton, and they're helping out with the snacks and stuff. And I was asking them, What? What? No, what motivates the youth you know, to do that because they think they, I don't know, is it once a week or so that they also, they, yeah, with

Speaker 2  24:05
those every Thursday night or something, or Tuesday night, I forget.

Speaker 1  24:11
And no, I said it's, it's not hard for me to understand if they get into recreational things or sports and, you know, want to spend, you know, put energies there. But what motivates them to do things, you know, to devote their time and energy in places like this and well, he, and if his children are involved, he said he his hope is that it's, you know, it's motivated by their love for the Lord and their their desire to spread that to others.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
I think things like that. I do if I take that on the one side, versus feeling that we need good, rigid laws to help us live properly. You know, I think helping people like they are there.

Speaker 1  25:25
It's can do a lot more good. It's sure it's way more difficult and uncomfortable to do that like you don't just

Speaker 1  25:40
yeah, that would take a lot more commitment and sacrifice, I'm sure.

Unknown Speaker  25:47
Yeah, yeah, that was definitely,

Speaker 1  25:50
well, that's it's besides, isn't that what, what Ben, Ben was doing for like, four years, and he needs prior to getting,

Matthias Miller  26:01
yeah, he was down there with, I forget what organization it was, but yeah, he had been been down there for a while. I don't remember exactly what it had been.

Matthias Miller  26:22
It's interesting. Two random thoughts, we could probably keep going forever, but we've got stuff to get to, but a few more random thoughts. The one of the biggest cures for addiction is human connection. And so that's which I think is a when you get when you don't have that, in one generation, the next generation, there has to be an intentional effort to rebuild that, if you want that, if you want To change the course. And also talking about practicality, the the movie The sound of hope and the story of Possum Trot has gotten some Mark. I'm sure it hasn't, hasn't really made its rounds in your circles, but has gotten a lot of attention. It's it was a church that that took the most difficult foster care placements, and I think it was, was it 100 or 150 mile radius? They they emptied out the foster care system. And that's those are very practical. I know a lot of people kind of shy away from that because it's messy, and it doesn't always

Unknown Speaker  27:38
if you want

Matthias Miller  27:41
some kind of picture perfect family. It doesn't always look like that. But in terms of practically changing, changing culture, helping, helping the least of these, helping rebuild some of the brokenness and, and, and, you know, redirect some of these generations. I think it's that's another very practical, practical application of of that. And if all the churches across the US, it would, I think it's only a few children that each church would actually have to have to take to do the same thing. So,

Speaker 1  28:26
anyway, cool, yeah, that that you mentioned something that really caught my, my attention. You mentioned, you said, having a picture perfect family, and I think that that can be a huge

Speaker 1  28:47
detriment, or like, why do we as humans so often, our goal is to appear Picture perfect to people around us when you know, sometimes I know, for me, it's if I step back and if I'm honest with myself, I know that that has way too much importance. Sometimes, if you're, if you're, if you're living like you should, then you don't have to worry about what image you said to anybody, yeah, and I Yeah, well, and

Matthias Miller  29:34
if you can have grace and understand that there's a reason Jesus died on the cross and we're not looking. I mean, we're, we're looking to be transformed a bit. There also has to be an honesty about our humanity as well in the midst of that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  29:56
yeah. So you. I agree we've got some work that we've got work to do. But one more

Unknown Speaker  30:06
before we move on is like, what have you I mean, you're, I don't know, you're still involved with, with, is it prison, prison babies and I Colorado, Matthias, where you're at. I think that's what

Speaker 1  30:28
can't think of the name right now. But like, how just, what is that program and what is that? Yes, auto shaped. You. About life and,

Unknown Speaker  30:47
um,

Matthias Miller  30:50
that is a good question.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
I think

Matthias Miller  30:56
that's a really big question. It's really easy in the day to day.

Matthias Miller  31:10
That's one of those things that you can take a very nice spend enough time in marketing, you can take that and spit it and make it look like just an amazing thing. And it really is,

Unknown Speaker  31:22
I think,

Matthias Miller  31:24
I think some of the ways that I'm grateful for, you know, especially early on, I was like, how is it that, because there's loads of training that you had to do to get started and on an ongoing basis, and it's kind of weird that parents don't have that same level of training of how do you bond with your child? The simple fact that one of your primary responsibilities as a parent is to communicate to your child that you're glad to be with them, which happens naturally for for many of us, for all, all of us. But there's moments when that has to be an intentional choice. And then the other thing is teaching them the emotional pathways to go from any emotion back to Joy and and if you give them that as a foundation, and you give them a and if you can give them a secure bond, emotional bond, and that's all very early, early stages of life, there's a dramatic impact on their quality of life, throughout their life. And so I think you know so that, and

Matthias Miller  32:47
I think being in that world gave me much more of an openness to taking a look at my own story and history and Family patterns and saying, Well, maybe there are some things here that weren't that to grow from. Weren't, weren't, weren't healthy, definitely lots of good, but definitely, definitely gaps. And I think also, I think also

Unknown Speaker  33:27
there's,

Matthias Miller  33:34
it's, it's made me, I don't know, I'm probably already naturally sensitive to some of this stuff, but it's made me more sensitive to individuals dynamics, what drives them when you've got kids who are, I don't know, different types of sensitivities, Different types of traumas, different types of you know, just struggling, struggling mentally, sometimes just being overwhelmed with simple tasks and stuff like that. And you kind of have to slow down and work with them and understand what's going

Unknown Speaker  34:17
on and, um,

Matthias Miller  34:19
it's, it's kind of, I don't know how to describe this. The the difference in any field between a novice and an expert is not in the 80% of knowledge. It's in the 20% of nuance knowledge. So it's the, it's the it's Larry with the CFO stuff, where it's like, yeah, we're in the ballpark. But here's this little distinction that really makes a big difference in how you should deal with your financials. And it's the same way working with people, working with kids, working with trauma, working with you. So with that, it's, I think, for me, it's been helpful, sometimes overwhelming, but also helpful to be able to pay attention to the little things, see the see the precursors, and then learn how to learn how to help, learn how to help them self regulate, calm down, find helping them find tools for for situations when they're overwhelmed. So I don't know. I don't know if that answers your question, yeah, kind of a rambly answer. Yeah.

Speaker 1  35:44
Yeah. I'm sure we go on and on about these types or with these types of discussions. Yeah, it's, it's Bentham, rewarding and helpful from time to time. But, yeah, yeah, well, should we jump into our agenda and talk about less important things

Matthias Miller  36:13
holy, just a different kind of holy? Oh?

Speaker 1  36:25
So Matthias, unless you have something you want to cover, first, we can, we can go,

Speaker 1  36:36
let's see we have until 1030 right when, when Audra joins for project updates.

Matthias Miller  36:41
Yes. And I mean, if it's better to spend our time on this and not do project updates, it's probably not the end of the world to just focus on this too.

Speaker 1  36:55
I almost think maybe we should skip project updates and go until 11 on this, if we need to, and then do project updates next week. But I'm

Matthias Miller  37:08
going to be out next week, but I still don't think, yeah. I mean, things have slowed down second which I still skip next week.

Speaker 1  37:19
Well, I yeah, let's, let's, unless you see a reason drew to do project updates, plus you have something that

Unknown Speaker  37:27
no, that should be okay.

Speaker 1  37:32
You're saying skip the meeting for the eighth, and then we're back on the 15th,

Unknown Speaker  37:37
correct?

Unknown Speaker  37:40
I'll probably need to skip the 15th.

Unknown Speaker  37:44
But okay,

Unknown Speaker  37:49
back with your office the 22nd

Speaker 1  37:52
mark. Okay. Should we, I mean, should we move it? What do you think Drew? Should we try to move it to another day that week. I don't know if that wouldn't work for Matthias, but or you think we just that would mean that you were skipping, yeah, I'm not

Speaker 2  38:11
sure how that week will look. It's probably we're kind of planning to go back in to Ohio that week, so I'm not exactly sure how we'll look, but I'm hurrying through this, so Thursday will be gone. So

Speaker 1  38:26
let's just, let's just, let's see Matthias. Let's plan you and I do the call at the 15th, and then drew will be back on the 22nd

Unknown Speaker  38:37
right? Sounds good. And

Matthias Miller  38:38
if you need, need to change. We can good. I let Joel know and Audre know. So, okay, so

Speaker 1  39:00
as I was looking at your response on invoice, sales or aging report. Yes, that that's it, that it excludes quotes. We don't have any invoicing data.

Speaker 1  39:17
Okay, if you take a look, I think we're missing each other just a little bit. If take a look at the R that the sales order activity history on our two three that one I listed here.

Matthias Miller  39:33
Ah, okay, here's what happening

Unknown Speaker  39:42
to we

Speaker 1  39:44
looked at this when Dwayne was here, and he said, Oh, that should be a simple fix. And then, well, actually, he did. He just created a user report off of it to

Unknown Speaker  39:54
see how that would change it. But then this morning, I. Okay, what's what's happening here is we're using the sales order. Oh, where is that creation date of wode?

Speaker 1  40:17
Well, oh, so on, on 1226, at 1:41pm there's an so creation date of 1226, 23 which is, I believe it's that date that the the this report is referencing.

Matthias Miller  40:36
It's the order date that you're after.

Speaker 1  40:40
Yeah, so the data, so what happened here was, this was a quote, but what we want is the 718, 24, date, when it went from a it says so as quote, when that went from yes to No. So I'm not sure what field or when the sales order ID went from Q, 231, R, 231,

Unknown Speaker  41:11
right.

Speaker 1  41:15
The intent of the report is just to say, here are all the sales orders that we have created, they have not yet been invoiced. We just go through those every month and say, Did we miss anything for invoicing? Now, obviously, 98% of the items, because of the logic you build, show up on the sales orders needing invoicing report just fine when the delivery is completed when it's a wholesale order. However, we set that up different all those nuances and their invoice, but then end of the month, we want to look at at these and say, What? What are sales orders that have not yet been fulfilled? And like the one we're looking at, you know, we're looking at this one saying, well, customer only placed his order in July. So why are we? Yeah, does that? Does that make sense?

Matthias Miller  42:12
That all makes sense. That's what he was missing. So I was Yeah. The one question is, do you want this also sorted by the sales order, date, yes, and then the currently, we're filtering out any old invoices, anything that was created before June of last year. It would be fine to change that also check the order date for the exclusion. See we got 189 let's just see if it let's just see if that changes anything in the live system. That would be an easy answer. And if it doesn't, then nobody cares.

Unknown Speaker  42:56
Let me do this. So we've got 504

Matthias Miller  43:08
and we got no four. So order date. Let's

Matthias Miller  43:22
do many. Minimum here, order, date,

Unknown Speaker  43:32
10, five, I have A four. Why would that? Though? I

Unknown Speaker  44:02
um, oh, does this include No,

Matthias Miller  44:12
I'm confused here. So creation date, so we've got okay, but some of these have blank order dates. Should these not be on the list if they're blank, I guess it would have a secondary invoice number. It should be either it should be the order date, if specified, otherwise it should be the invoice date, right,

Unknown Speaker  44:38
or the creation date,

Speaker 1  44:40
yeah. Are you saying some that don't start out as a quote, just have the Esso creation date. Like

Matthias Miller  44:50
wholesale orders don't have an order date. Handwritten invoices don't have an order date.

Unknown Speaker  44:58
But what do those have? Then

Unknown Speaker  45:00
they would have a creation date.

Speaker 1  45:04
Oh, and the reason, if we use, currently, we're using creation date on everything, which is why we're getting some of these going when the quote was created, right, right? So I think that would be correct. What you're saying is you would, you would if, if they have an so order date, use it, and if not, use the so creation date. I've that sounds correct, because what we show on the list is, at least from a high level, is correct. Like all of these that we're looking at, we're seeing, well, yeah, these are all legit, other than the miscellaneous ones, which you said you added those now, or you made a change to add those

Matthias Miller  46:02
now, if I do this with our cutoff, yes, but if I do this with the cutoff, we will have, let's see which ones these are. Then ask man, so date is less than there are five new sales orders that are showing up that were All created. Wait, so creation date?

Unknown Speaker  46:35
I think there's I

Matthias Miller  46:47
nine wood there are four buildings

Unknown Speaker  46:53
ordered

Matthias Miller  46:57
that were quoted. Yeah, were there four buildings that are missing because they were quoted before June of last year.

Speaker 1  47:08
So can you just remove that time frame and just go back to

Unknown Speaker  47:14
I think what I want to do, we try this.

Matthias Miller  47:21
Think we can maybe get away with let's do this order date 18.

Unknown Speaker  47:35
Got these all the way back to I

Matthias Miller  47:44
I'm the only one that's,

Unknown Speaker  47:54
hang on.

Matthias Miller  47:57
It's not quite right.

Unknown Speaker  48:02
90 18. I think if we

Matthias Miller  48:12
change this to 915

Unknown Speaker  48:19
okay, if we change the if we change the date to

Matthias Miller  48:37
I'm gonna have To make some notes here. If we change the cutoff date to this new date that we're using is on or after September 15, the report contents won't change, except you'll get these four new sales orders showing up like they should. Okay

Speaker 1  48:59
that you're using the cutoff date. Well, what? What cutoff date are you using now? Number 15,

Unknown Speaker  49:06
June, oh,

Matthias Miller  49:09
June, 30, I think

Speaker 1  49:11
of 23 Well, yeah, of course. 23 Yeah, 23 and years you're uh.

Speaker 1  49:35
You have, you have orders listed. The standard report currently just shows any sales orders that have buildings. What do you have now is, is all sales orders?

Unknown Speaker  49:51
Well,

Matthias Miller  49:52
I thought the current one is showing did I? Did I make a change for it to i. Include

Speaker 1  50:01
no so that that was on an earlier email that I had sent. I think you responded and said, Okay, maybe okay in B there, oh, I

Speaker 1  50:20
think that's what you're saying. I'm not familiar with this. Can Dwayne No,

Speaker 1  50:31
is that what you're saying? I'm not familiar with this. Can Dwayne handle this is where I say include miscellaneous sales orders. No, I

Matthias Miller  50:39
meant I meant that for the skew sheets. Oh,

Speaker 1  50:46
okay, but to say the standard sales order aiding report that I was getting the last few days for last week or so still, still had no it only showed sales orders where there was a building attached. You're saying now that that speaks,

Matthias Miller  51:09
I didn't make any changes, and it seems to be working. That's what I'm confused about. Well,

Unknown Speaker  51:14
I wonder if they're sending different that

Unknown Speaker  51:17
specific

Matthias Miller  51:20
ones that were missing.

Speaker 1  51:28
Yeah, there were no, you know what? Think I know what the deal is. So if it's a miscellaneous sales order, it has no, no building. It automatically assists. The logic says, at time of creation, you're ready to invoice, right? Which is why I'm not seeing any. Oh, I think that's because I do see some up here on the in the top section, the ready to invoice. I think that's what's happening. Okay, which is correct.

Speaker 1  52:18
Now, could you send me? I'm assuming these changes, yeah, that's what's happening. These changes to the you made, these won't go live until the next update, right?

Matthias Miller  52:30
No, not unless it's more urgent. I can take a few minutes to push it up,

Speaker 1  52:41
if you don't mind, and do that, that would be great, because we're at the end of the month, and that's usually when we do that. So that would be great if you could do that. You're saying that will be live then, like it, it's not a one time thing. This will basically like Josh being an update,

Matthias Miller  53:02
yeah, but just for this specific report, yep.

Speaker 1  53:06
Okay, so by when would you expect that to be updated? And then I'll just have someone send me updated reports, and should be good to go. Oh,

Matthias Miller  53:14
have that running in the I'll keep this going in the background so that I don't cover that and don't get pulled away. Check back.

Speaker 1  53:25
So the the other you said you're not familiar with this skew sheet thing. So Josh told me similar to like adding standard reports to the phone menu. He set up something where I don't know what he called it, but we're where other users can add any selected standard reports to the this list, making them available what, what he currently calls the SKU sheet. So I was just I thought, well, if this is something that you could find, we just added to that. I wouldn't need to bug anybody to send me these reports. I could just get them myself.

Unknown Speaker  54:06
Let me

Speaker 1  54:10
It's something he just did over the weekend. He said, You made it available. Haven't

Matthias Miller  54:14
had an example of something that's going out. I

Speaker 1  54:19
do like the sales orders needing invoicing report or the accounts receivable report, both of those are like that, or, yeah, both of those reports are accessible.

Unknown Speaker  54:37
Reports. Oh,

Matthias Miller  54:45
um, let me see if I can get this to work.

Unknown Speaker  54:55
Skew to.

Matthias Miller  55:00
So this would be an invoiced.

Matthias Miller  55:20
All right, so then this is the,

Unknown Speaker  55:33
all right.

Matthias Miller  55:35
Well, I don't know if there's anything more than I have to

Speaker 1  55:40
do, but you're saying it should not be available. It should,

Unknown Speaker  55:49
yeah, I see it.

Unknown Speaker  55:50
Okay. Fair enough.

Matthias Miller  55:54
Magic, good. I

Speaker 1  56:03
Good. So that concludes number one, two questions on applying actual costs. Review why we're needing to take into account amount off after applying costs. Now this goes to the file that I sent to you, which is Um,

Speaker 1  56:28
the I think it's called inventory consumption 1.2 i

Unknown Speaker  56:43
But what's happening here is,

Speaker 1  56:51
so we go through this whole process of at the end of each month when we apply actual raw material costs and say, like, if We're if you're looking at that spreadsheet, let's take

Speaker 1  57:07
a column E, or end of a for example. So E, 28 we're saying 578,004 7922 is the raw materials that we consume build standard billings in that month. So that's what will apply as raw materials, actual cause. Now the part that has us confused is I should ask, do you have that file? Does that make sense? So far?

Unknown Speaker  58:02
I messed

Matthias Miller  58:14
you might have to walk me through this again, so we've got just trying to try to get it open over here.

Speaker 1  58:30
So, okay, this is oversimplified, but basically, at the end of we apply a raw materials actual cost. We do a we do a physical condo or inventory. We say we have 250,000 worth of raw materials on hand. So then we do all of our calculations to say how much we consumed in the in the month, obviously ending up with 250,000 on hand. So we apply whatever number we come up with to buildings filled in in that month, and when everything said and done, we should have on our balance sheet, we should have a raw materials number the no 5105,

Speaker 1  59:31
finished goods, the sum total of the of those two, basically the raw materials minus what we've consumed so far this year, should equal 250,000

Matthias Miller  59:46
lost. Where's the 250

Unknown Speaker  59:50
okay. Do you have the file open?

Matthias Miller  59:52
I do scroll. Okay, I got it. Let's

Speaker 1  59:58
use actual numbers. We'll go to 531, so number two, or in row 12. E 12. That's what the balance sheet shows we had. It's basically saying this is what we had on hand January one, plus everything received from that point. Then E 13 is, this is how much raw materials we've consumed, January one through May 31 so in a perfect world, the sum of those which is the total in E, 14, 2,000,004 7333, should equal the raw materials you know that you have on hand. So but what, what's happening is, is we do the calculation, like in this case, in E 28 the 578,000 we come up with that number, we apply it, and then we're closed to 578, by the time we're done. But we're not, not quiet. We're, you know, sometimes a couple 1000 or that, that's what we have in row. 16 is the amount we're off after applying. Also drew will take these numbers, why the cost? Go back and double check and say, Okay, we're off just a bit, and then apply it again. Which, which is why you're if you look at the formula in E 28 you'll see that he's including row 16. Now what, what should be happening is, if we should be able to delete row 16, delete those numbers, apply the the cost that we now have in 28 and it should all is working. If you look at the in the purple down below, from 36 to 45 the delete those numbers now you're totaling up to the difference between accounting and I imagine, is zero. Now there's there's nuances here which are not important to like the whip section in row, 23 and 24 and the applying or miscellaneous sales orders in row, 27 I don't mean those are just more details that I don't think playing here. But what we're seeing in the end, down below in if you take a look at 3738 39 that's, you know, basically your raw materials on the balance sheet, minus the contra account equals your total raw materials balance sheet, which should equal up to, you know, the different basically all of our counted inventory, which is row 42 plus any work in process, or minus any work In process. And that should end up, but if we're so so I think basically what we're seeing is what's happening if we It would almost seem like we apply. We figure out the amount that we think we need to apply, we apply it, but then it looks like it doesn't apply quite all of that amount, or just a little less, I think. I mean, Drew, am I? You do this all the time? Drew so you can go ahead and explain,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:54
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
pieces that I might be missing.

Speaker 2  1:03:57
I mean, that's about, I'm not sure what it's what it's doing, because, well, one little nuance that might explain on this sheet is column D for April. You know, also in row 16 says that it's 4800 off, but that's actually April was fine, because when you make the change to march in row C, if you fix that, that, of course, accumulates. And so April was right on.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:35
And then the 743

Speaker 2  1:04:40
is in column E is how much May is off without making the march change. So when you make the march change, may would would actually be like $4,100 off. Or you. No, actually it would be like $5,500 so April worked out just fine. It did exactly as was supposed to, but March and May did not

Matthias Miller  1:05:14
okay. So I'm a little confused, because when I, when I look at so the original number was 570 without any corrections, was 579 222, 69 when, when I run the report, it correctly calculates the adjusted cost the whole way through.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:42
So what this means is

Matthias Miller  1:05:48
there is a transaction affecting

Unknown Speaker  1:05:55
either presumably

Matthias Miller  1:06:00
there's a transaction affecting raw materials to finished goods that is not taught, that is that is either not tied to anything or tied to a building that was not that's dated during that date, but not tied to a building that was built during that date. Right? Oh.

Speaker 1  1:06:21
People, oh, well, we could do it. We could do a transaction search. I didn't think about that, but you're saying mistakenly, somebody could have posted $784 or 4800 or whatever, to that, that 109 account and writing it,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:48
I would try very plausible.

Speaker 2  1:06:52
Well, shed time, I just got done doing shed time overnight and this morning and June and February didn't work out, but all the rest of the months did.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:08
So explain. Part is that we want to listen

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
financial accounts. This is a i b, a, b, c, 10, come on. Please give me my choices, don't I don't want to have to make me type it out. Fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32
Be that way.

Matthias Miller  1:07:35
Okay, so there are, okay, yes, we're looking for accounting transactions.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:52
And

Matthias Miller  1:07:54
in range account transaction, the date would be between five 124 and five 125, no, sorry, 530, wow, 3031,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:11
24 help. And

Matthias Miller  1:08:18
it's not tied to it's a manual transfer or and the account trans event type is not a

Matthias Miller  1:08:37
wait a Second. Account trans event type

Matthias Miller  1:09:03
or building field account, trans event, record idea, record ID, building, build date, or we're not in range. Five, 124

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32
531, 24

Unknown Speaker  1:09:41
here drew let me

Matthias Miller  1:09:47
share my screen for you. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
Hello.

Matthias Miller  1:10:22
How do invoicing events impact the balance?

Speaker 1  1:10:33
Well, okay, invoicing, no, okay on buildings, the the bill date is what impacts this 109 account like it, it increases. Never we enter a build date for a building. I'm wondering which is if this has something to do with miscellaneous sales orders, where we have made so that we can, we can say, okay, Drew bought five, two by fours from us. So we'll create a sales order. And cost of inventory items that he's using is, is $10 so that $10 will also hit this 109, no,

Matthias Miller  1:11:26
yeah, we, I mean, that's raw materials to finish goods. 107, 71 Where's that coming from? Raw materials cost, yes, this is your miscellaneous. Is your raw materials cost?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:39
Okay, let's,

Matthias Miller  1:11:40
let's try this. I'm going to create a new report. Let's see browse new and what we're going to do is this would be a sales order report. And the so district equals Ohio and in range. So invoice date is five, 124, and 515. 3124

Speaker 1  1:12:08
the one where the file we sent to you is for for vinyl structures, if you're wanting to, oh, I'm sorry that one,

Matthias Miller  1:12:14
thank you. And that is in a so raw materials cost. And then we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
a sum on this. Oops,

Matthias Miller  1:12:30
and it's getting grouchy at me for some reason. Is

Matthias Miller  1:12:40
total is wait.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:44
Well,

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
so vinyl structures is off, okay, well, let's do this account, transaction, company Id think, go find a vinyl structures, nope.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
These are, oh, well, that would, sorry, that's them. Let's try that.

Matthias Miller  1:13:14
And let's do

Unknown Speaker  1:13:18
there's invoiced

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
and source record and the invoice date was five, 124, why is it not showing anything? District,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:37
let's do this. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:13:44
so, district, company, let's do this. So, county, so,

Matthias Miller  1:14:03
you like me now? No, you don't?

Matthias Miller  1:14:14
You? 23, 317, 81, no, but this is, this isn't completely it, because cancelations would have a reversal. And so it's this. And I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
or

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
in range. So cancelation date, let's do this. Let's do macro, low. Raw materials. So if in range, then it's so raw materials cost, na else it's if in range, if we cancel, we subtract it back out.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:33
And

Matthias Miller  1:15:40
here throw this guy in. Okay, so that'll so then we should show so invoice date and so cancelation date.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:50
Let's try this, see

Matthias Miller  1:15:53
if we get a familiar number, 18, 393, 75 does that mean anything? Or no. I

Speaker 2  1:16:03
No, but what is okay, that's cancelation. What's the invoice date on that? Cancelation?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
One, six, this guy. One, eight, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:16:20
could that be part of our effect for the first quarter number

Matthias Miller  1:16:25
4089 let's take a look at the number.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:29
I mean, that's where oh 743,

Matthias Miller  1:16:34
40 Libre Office is giving me grief. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:52
4089 number looks

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
intriguing.

Speaker 2  1:16:59
Where are we? Oh, so that 4089 52 plus the $743.47 that we were off in May equals the 4800 3299 that we were off in the first part. So that that transaction right there, definitely has something to do with it. What's what's unique about that transaction?

Matthias Miller  1:17:24
Well, I mean, it's a cancelation. So we could expand this search a little bit to say we could go back to January, and then we could group by, uh, sort of string so

Unknown Speaker  1:17:47
well,

Matthias Miller  1:17:50
not completely. Let's just do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54
Our cancelations

Unknown Speaker  1:17:58
properly, backing out

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
so they're not

Speaker 2  1:18:09
so this is the same mark. This is the exact same thing as the thing of moving Deluxe card where we told accounting that this happened, and then we counted differently on a different date,

Speaker 1  1:18:25
I think so. So are you saying the 20? Okay, if we go back to the spreadsheet that the leeway office spreadsheet, are you saying the miscellaneous sales order total is incorrect, like the the 22 in E 27 the 22,043 27 is incorrect in that it includes $4,000 worth of canceled stuff.

Speaker 2  1:18:54
It would, it would include $4,000 there, but then

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
it gets canceled in May.

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
So where are you getting that? Were you getting this miscellaneous sales order number from?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
I'm sorry we go to

Speaker 1  1:19:17
where we get that is on that built buildings report, we go to the built buildings. Report, I'm assuming that's where you

Unknown Speaker  1:19:29
get it. Drew which is it's

Speaker 2  1:19:33
so I have it. What is it called? It's the one that we always get the name mixed up on

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
raw materials. There we go.

Matthias Miller  1:19:46
Alright, so it needs to happen on this report. So let's do North Carolina for five 124, 531, 24 and I'm going to guess that what needs to happen is I. Let's see how this is working. Raw materials. Model building Sten, so we have the building raw materials, the so raw materials and in range. Haha, it's something like this will be fun to get right, oops, or in range. So cancelation date,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:40
let's actually do,

Matthias Miller  1:20:44
let's do loc so raw material impact for date, for so raw material

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
net impact. And we're going to do,

Matthias Miller  1:21:02
I'm zero and not is NA or zero, so raw material, low net impact,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:15
that's not quite right,

Matthias Miller  1:21:19
okay, and this one is actually going to be quite similar to what we're doing over here,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
no over here,

Matthias Miller  1:21:33
except we're going to I a lot taken

Unknown Speaker  1:21:52
off. All right,

Matthias Miller  1:21:54
so this says that the raw materials value is four. I don't know how this needs to tie into the spreadsheet.

Speaker 2  1:22:06
Um, so that last set of numbers with no buildings, those are the those are the miscellaneous sales orders.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:17
Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:22:20
raw materials, value. But are we seeing any negative amounts? No, that. Hang on. It's still not quite right, because the raw materials should actually be loc

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
building. Loc, so

Matthias Miller  1:22:43
so raw materials, net impact, which takes it from, okay, so the let's compare this to without my changes. See what it says. This one says 429, why is that not changing? I would expect that change. If invoice date, it's then it's wrong. It's a cancelation, it's negative.

Matthias Miller  1:23:19
But we're not seeing any negative values during this range which would but the cancelation was, where's the cancelation? Date it was canceled.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:38
Then, yeah, it's 513

Unknown Speaker  1:23:40
but go Hold on

Unknown Speaker  1:23:48
those transactions. Just a little

Matthias Miller  1:23:53
bit these guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:56
right?

Speaker 2  1:23:58
So I am not showing what I had before this. This one oh on the eighth, January 8. This raw materials, finished goods, 109 account. I am not showing that in my list of things that I applied for January.

Speaker 3  1:24:22
I uh, well, like, take a look at this.

Speaker 4  1:24:27
I mean, because shouldn't, yes, because there's Joe

Speaker 2  1:24:32
as a legitimate sale, January, February, March, April, and then in May, say, Wait, this is canceled. Then at what point do we say? No, those raw materials never were consumed. So

Matthias Miller  1:24:50
it was invoice on January 1. Nick added, okay, Seth's changes to lockdown, reconciled transactions. It won't, oh, we might need to extend it. But does invoice january 1 Nick created the raw materials cost, which created an adjustment for January, which throughout your January numbers by 394, then in June, he said, No, that wasn't right. So not only did he adjust that, end up adjusting, sorry, 426, assigned raw material cost. May 13, canceled it, which created a reversal on May 15, and then on Friday, June 14, he changed raw material cost, which means that we went back and we adjusted the the January and the May transaction

Unknown Speaker  1:25:39
to to adapt.

Speaker 2  1:25:51
That makes sense. Yeah, I'm not seeing his earlier number either, which I shouldn't be, because we would have done we've still done it after that last thing in June.

Speaker 2  1:26:12
Wait, no, that's not a miscellaneous sales order. That's a building, isn't it? It's

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
not tied to standard.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:23
What is this?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:28
No, that is Miscellaneous sales order. I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:53
So what is the issue? Is it that we have a cancel miscellaneous sales order that reverses that inventory, adding on to the contra account.

Speaker 2  1:27:15
So it's it's ordered in builders, invoiced in January, and this is the raw materials numbers that's in it, and then it gets canceled and reversed in May, so the accounting just follows that logic, reverse raw materials back as of the invoice date.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
Yes, well, oh,

Speaker 1  1:27:55
what happens if we cancel a building, like, if we have a building that's built and we well, yeah, I think you're right to had it done that, then your previous numbers would have stayed in sync, right?

Speaker 2  1:28:14
I think because it would have if it was not on the sales or it was if it was not in the invoice list anymore, which applies those raw materials costs. Then it's also not that inventory number anymore as well.

Speaker 1  1:28:37
What was the dollar amount on this raw materials for this building, or for this miscellaneous what was the dollar amount that we that was used or that was entered?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:50
4089 52 the other way here, because

Matthias Miller  1:29:01
is to have the raw materials for period create a reversal on the date of cancelation. And, I mean, this is up to you. You guys are the accounting experts. My argument is that that's better, because if somebody like, in this case, do you really want it going back and shifting your January numbers when they cancel something four months later, like, don't you? I guess that's a question for you guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:33
Well,

Speaker 2  1:29:35
that's a little nuanced right now, because we're sorting through so many things that we end up going back and changing things all the time. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:29:41
sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:44
Well, okay, if we, if,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:48
yeah, go ahead Mark,

Speaker 1  1:29:50
if we do it that way, then this would have, we could go back to January, or let's say, March numbers, and it would all be, everything would still. Match, assuming no other changes were made. But then, come May, when you go to apply those costs we withdrew, you would have to have visibility into the cancelation and say, Oh, instead of the 22,000 worth of materials used for raw materials for those, I'm, I'm going to do 22,000 minus the 4000 and use 18,000 right? But you're and okay, it wouldn't okay, because it would. You would do that on your on your spreadsheet, but on the the accounting site, that would have already happened as of the date of cancelation. On the day this was canceled, the 109 that contra number would have, let's just say it was negative 200,000 it would have gone negative, change to negative 196,000

Speaker 3  1:31:01
well, but I mean,

Speaker 2  1:31:07
so the thing that I'm not sure, what do we do with is, so our February count is going to be wrong because, because we're going to go out and we're going To do a count, and we're going to count those materials, and then in March, we're going to count those materials again. I mean, you know, all the way until May, when it gets canceled, then we're going to be correct again, because, because

Unknown Speaker  1:31:43
accounting says

Speaker 2  1:31:47
again that we should be counting those materials, whereas for several months they said, No, we should not be counting those materials.

Matthias Miller  1:31:58
But you don't know whether those materials were stolen, used, scrapped, whatever. So what it's going to look like is your buildings in January or February were point 1% more expensive than what they actually were, and when it got to made, the ones built in May were point 1% less expensive than what you thought they were, right? It's, it's just going to change how the cost could apply,

Speaker 1  1:32:26
right? No, it would do it the it would make the earlier work less, less expensive, because we would actually have more inventory on him.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:35
But yeah, that, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:32:39
So on these small ones. I don't think it's a big deal how we handle them. I'm just thinking if we have, let's say, a whole truckload of OSB, and this were the, I guess we would have other we would accounting, would we go to counter inventory? And there's a truckload more there than accounting things, there is then we would,

Speaker 2  1:33:10
well, I but this would be selling a truckload of OSB on this side of things, which is a lot less likely to happen. But,

Speaker 1  1:33:24
yeah, I don't really have, I mean, Drew, I guess it's I don't have a strong opinion on how we handle it when we

Speaker 2  1:33:36
So, so if we now have these canceled sales showing up. Okay? Does this report also do the same thing for canceled barns? Like,

Speaker 4  1:33:52
how do canceled buildings affect this?

Matthias Miller  1:33:57
But you don't unbuild a building. I

Speaker 2  1:34:03
right, and we're going, that's right. We're going by built buildings, not sold buildings, correct? Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:34:11
I mean, that's the service that Ohio started offering.

Speaker 1  1:34:17
But, but if? But what happens if occasionally a building will get Mark Milton, no, no, no, this was we got the wrong building, sorry. And we, we take the build date back off again. Does that reverse that?

Matthias Miller  1:34:34
Yeah, drop off the report. And so if you already applied actual costs, your actual costs are going to shift. I Perfect. Sorry, your your balance sheet, if it happens before you apply actual costs, no harm, no foul. It's just like it had never, never been built. If you do it after you apply costs, then your balance sheet is not going to match, because you. We had reconciled it, but now building went away and yeah, yeah, that's

Speaker 1  1:35:05
almost a non issue, because there's enough delay from usually it's within a day or two that we find out about that mistake. So that's yeah. So Well, what we're trying to figure out is when, on what day, when a sales order with miscellaneous sales order is canceled, that we change the 109 number, is it on the day of cancelation or the day of the sales order was created?

Speaker 2  1:35:38
I mean, from an accounting perspective, it would be correct to have it on the cancelation date.

Speaker 2  1:35:51
I guess most times we're not going to be carrying inventory for five months. Like like this, should be rare that an order is invoiced in five months left later canceled,

Speaker 1  1:36:11
and because of, because of how we're doing, our physical counts, we would have, in this situation, we would have counted it for all those four months. And but, but accounting says it's not here, and then, like, okay, the physical inventory on hand in this situation most likely never changed, right? Okay, we're and the other thing is, what if somebody takes the two by fours and brings them back a month later and says they were, I don't know, he doesn't like the smell of them, and so he brings it back, and then we put him back in inventory. I mean that I would probably lean to just do it as of the cancelation date, and it's, it's, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:37:00
so is there anything else that can affect the 109, account that does not come from buildings like that's what we I think that's what we're against, isn't it? Because we only apply cost of buildings, and then it doesn't come out quite right, because something else is, there's,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:24
there's a transaction in 109 that has nothing to do with the building. So this is one of them. But then where's the seven in May there was that 700 something amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:41
743 47

Unknown Speaker  1:37:47
you need to leave, right?

Matthias Miller  1:37:49
I need to drop. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:51
So,

Matthias Miller  1:37:52
I mean, do we know for sure that drew I would run the report since January and see if the 743, 47 shows up as a cancelation anywhere that's that's where I would start,

Speaker 1  1:38:04
or have you included cancelations now Matthias, because yes on this report. Oh, okay, perfect. I was just thinking, Matthias, unless you have some time to regroup this afternoon, we have a few other things that would be real good to cover. Is that an option for you or not? Let

Matthias Miller  1:38:26
me. Let me take a look. My day is a little potentially I would have, well, it's up in the air. It would be from about 230 to

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
430

Matthias Miller  1:38:44
Eastern, if I would. And I've got one other thing I need to nail down, but I can

Unknown Speaker  1:38:54
actually, I would have,

Matthias Miller  1:38:58
I would have half an hour. Well, I don't know if that's enough time, so I've got something else. Yeah, I might. I might have some time this afternoon, but I'll have to kind of take a look at how things shake out and let you know.

Speaker 1  1:39:09
Okay, let's do that. If it works, let us well, I guess either way, let us know. But yeah, we would be available. Then

Matthias Miller  1:39:17
if that works, sounds good. Appreciate it sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:22
Thank you. Bye.
