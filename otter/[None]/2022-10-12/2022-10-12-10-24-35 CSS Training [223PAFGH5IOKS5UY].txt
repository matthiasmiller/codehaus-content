Matthias Miller  00:51
Yes, it helped us to save. Second This is completely random, I got fed up with

Unknown Speaker  01:02
Google's

Matthias Miller  01:04
email filters. So I wrote a Google script that filters out what emails are sent to a list what emails or subscription emails, what email their personal emails and what emails or calendar invites and have an Excel spreadsheet with my filter rules works a lot better.

Speaker 1  01:25
I have barely had the need to use them other than since apparently, if you move one promotion email from your promotions to your primary, every single email from that company or at least in this case, it was with famous footwear because it had I wanted it my primary email because it was a

Unknown Speaker  01:49
motional code to use

Speaker 1  01:53
and I didn't want to scroll through all my promotions to find it and so I did that and then like I would get two emails a day from them and no matter how often I tried to move them into promotions or keep coming into my primary tabs eventually I just had to set up the filter to get rid of them

Matthias Miller  02:11
oh that's obnoxious

Unknown Speaker  02:12
yeah that's weird yeah you know machine learning is great except when it's not

Matthias Miller  02:24
yeah that was really good for the road

Speaker 2  02:54
check in with Josh on that I mean. Well, that's okay. Each breaks it cetera? Well the question I would have is, on this

Matthias Miller  04:39
report, can we successfully just export it as PDF as a PDF format and have it actually work? I don't know the right approach and do we know what columns we've gotten how that should have? It's going to work. I don't have that page breaks will work magically well

Unknown Speaker  05:07
Is there a reason not to just I don't know how to predict this

Matthias Miller  05:19
you know something nice to print out is pretty big

Unknown Speaker  05:31
yeah

Unknown Speaker  05:55
I should be able to now got it okay

Matthias Miller  06:54
we're gonna work from the bottom up because I don't want

Unknown Speaker  06:56
to talk about this right now. Well

Matthias Miller  08:25
I don't know how oh no this is easy if I would think that the best way to do this, most printers actually have a print by email option email that email attachment to the ER I see most some printers do

Matthias Miller  09:04
if the printer has a print

Unknown Speaker  09:20
I see You should be taking these?

Matthias Miller  11:53
where should this setting be

Unknown Speaker  12:07
is there a What are we

Unknown Speaker  12:42
for the setting? Are we talking about a link to the order or checkbox? Oh that way

Unknown Speaker  12:48
for who gets the alert Do you think that is that too janky that's for we could have you could do a well yeah, that'd be fine. You could have a catch all

Speaker 1  17:54
email address for replacing a login email address was that but it would amount to the same thing as sending

Unknown Speaker  18:07
sort of whose email do all those stand up in? He wants all of them to open their Why are we not able to attach? You can attach via mail to links Actually MSG is very specific you could be interesting if

Matthias Miller  25:55
you could have a if you would export it in the EML format

Unknown Speaker  26:09
then you can have email

Matthias Miller  26:15
you can have an option from email exports that download all emails as a zip file with EML files inside it

Speaker 2  26:40
next month quite storage efficient right as it XML is quite storage efficient right so this is

Matthias Miller  26:49
an XML it's EML it's not super it's basically the same format as emails going across the wire and it's not super efficient but it would zip

Unknown Speaker  27:02
well we're not going to. All right, well,

Matthias Miller  29:23
we got everything squared away except for the last knotty issue

Unknown Speaker  29:27
of

Matthias Miller  29:32
payments on contact records

Unknown Speaker  29:39
I'm

Matthias Miller  29:46
almost inclined to

Unknown Speaker  29:47
So in the in that case we would put Marina we would put all people we put all payments in the contact record Yeah, I think oh

Matthias Miller  30:24
then our credit debit miscellaneous

Speaker 1  30:26
payments is one well no, nevermind yeah all payments could do on the contract

Unknown Speaker  30:30
within our down payment Oh, that gets messy. Does it go? It goes on the track don't record Oh, unless you have multiple tractors Oh, I did not think about that side

Matthias Miller  31:02
if you have multiple track owners, you create three entries per person

Unknown Speaker  31:20
how do ordinary payments

Unknown Speaker  31:21
work because it should work exactly the

Speaker 2  31:23
same. It should be the same as ordinary payments. Ordinary payments aren't split out, are they? No,

Matthias Miller  31:32
they say Oh, this guy gets 33% of $5,000 Okay, well that's I think so that's easy, but that means it has to stay on the track record. So you would put logger payments logger payments would go on the contact record Yep.

Unknown Speaker  31:55
or non tracked this mean on tracks and stuff?

Matthias Miller  32:28
Let me see if he was to do them and was actually about this just maybe.

Unknown Speaker  33:19
You I'm not

Matthias Miller  33:57
on as me throwing up my hands in despair because I've spent

Unknown Speaker  34:02
my heads over my headset we're

Matthias Miller  34:11
I do think we need to legitimately have a good bit of focus about how we do payments and how

Unknown Speaker  34:24
Yeah, how we manage that.

Matthias Miller  34:28
I don't know if QuickBooks integration actually is a deal killer because

Unknown Speaker  34:37
I know what to think get through I mean part of it is my head's a little weary of this stuff payments are complicated how can we make them be less complicated? I think we're we're thankful We're thankful

Matthias Miller  36:36
what are the implications of having a separate payments

Unknown Speaker  36:38
record See you later link I tracked

Unknown Speaker  37:41
I mean it simplifies

Unknown Speaker  37:42
the track record I'm not sure the totaling becomes more obnoxious

Matthias Miller  38:28
Okay, I'm gonna say this. This is my instinct. It could be Wrong

Unknown Speaker  40:42
Bring your data

Matthias Miller  40:43
it's not a design questions are its favorite?

Unknown Speaker  40:44
Hey, hey,

Matthias Miller  41:43
glad I saved my favorite for you. Okay, let me switch my time and then we'll

Unknown Speaker  41:53
dive in.

Matthias Miller  41:59
Okay, what can I do for you? Okay, so, EBS has multiple types of payments, number one, they do these agreements with a landowner and they have different ways of slicing and dicing that and they go go log off of the land and based off of that, they make certain types of payments to them. Okay, and so our plan is that is on a on the tract, that we would that we could track payments, what the payments would be for certain loads. And they could do downpayment and expense adjustments on the payment and in the Calculate payment amounts, put in payment date, etc, etc. Okay. Then they also have loads coming in from independent loggers. Sure, and we want to track payments. So, a logger might bring in two loads in one day, and we want to have a single payment for them. Okay. What we're planning to do on the track payments was to have a payments or G with a payment ID. Actually, I don't even know that we even need a payment ID with no, we were planning to do yes, we were planning to have to always have a blank payment and unpaid payment on the track with a payment ID and then as loads come in, we just assign them over to that blank payment. And that unpaid payment just increases until whenever they pay it Okay, now so

Speaker 3  43:39
what is the Okay? She just want to pull up like a notepad or Google Doc or something. And so that we can kind of jot down the different record types that because I'm a little bit I'm a little bit foggy.

Unknown Speaker  43:54
So we have

Matthias Miller  44:03
got the tracks. Yep. Which is the piece of land then we have the cow the tally, which is a logging load. And then we have here we have an orgy of payments, okay, with an ID. And so the tally can be and then we also have

Unknown Speaker  44:26
contacts,

Matthias Miller  44:27
which are, you know, like like loggers Okay, so tally you can be either for a logger or attract. Sure. And then my thought was that on the tally, you would assign a payment ID that links it back to a certain payment and paid payment on the track. And that's how we linked them together. Sure, okay.

Unknown Speaker  44:54
And then, and then,

Matthias Miller  44:57
the auction the thought was on the On the logger, we could also have an orgy of payments with ID. And we do the same thing, we just tie it back on this record. The only

Speaker 2  45:14
the only lightly obnoxious piece is that we now have

Matthias Miller  45:23
to get to different IDs that we tie them back to.

Unknown Speaker  45:31
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:33
The other issue, go ahead. Yeah, no, I totally understand. Now, the other the other option would be a payments record. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 3  45:46
I toyed with something kind of like that. Now, if they would be logging the the extra land on a church, would that be a gospel tract or not?

Matthias Miller  46:05
If it weren't for a chiropractor? Would that be a backlog?

Speaker 3  46:11
Great questions. Okay, so um, so let me think about payments now, with a logger does is this Do you have a single? Again, I'm toying with a better name than payments record, but I'm not even quite sure what, but would you have a almost like a log source or something? And it would either be track, here's the track record or contact? And here's a contact record. Or logs, logs provider maybe?

Unknown Speaker  47:06
And then. So,

Unknown Speaker  47:17
or, or I count?

Unknown Speaker  47:21
The Go ahead. So then would

Matthias Miller  47:26
the question I would have is, with that,

Unknown Speaker  47:29
I mean, we kind of

Matthias Miller  47:33
are you suggesting that we would actually merge, like the logger would actually have an account and account could either be a tract or it could be a logger account?

Unknown Speaker  47:42
I'm wondering about it. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:45
And then you would you would have records to two record types

Matthias Miller  47:56
or just a Type field that says this is a larger account and

Unknown Speaker  47:58
this is a

Speaker 3  48:00
one of those two? So I guess I mean, in one sense, you're almost treating the logger as a source is what you're doing. So and here we might have to So what term did I just have before I said source you talked about account so so I like both count and says the act as a stream of of money. Well, I mean of us I think of payments as one particular payment not a whole orgy of you know, over the course of many of two years to a specific logger. So I think

Matthias Miller  49:00
that was actually proposing multiple record payment records tied out to

Speaker 3  49:04
I see Well, that would also Okay, so every payment becomes independent payment record that either ties to a that's not a bad either. Okay, so So now we're getting so here we're getting the several different two different data models that seem pretty reasonable to me. One is to

Unknown Speaker  49:24
have a an account

Speaker 3  49:31
although see account isn't great because they may have in their books they may have account having an account

Unknown Speaker  49:39
so the

Speaker 3  49:48
other one is to call it a now if it's from a log or do they need to know anything at all besides I mean, do they do they track at all how the where the logger got it or how he got it or anything like that? Or is just showed up from that this logger. Well, I mean, they're tracking the logs and the load and stuff like that. But they're not saying oh, he caught he got this, you know, and, and, you know, Harrisburg county or anything like that?

Unknown Speaker  50:15
No, I don't think so. Um, all right, Nick. No.

Speaker 3  50:21
Okay. So I see, well, I think about a log source. record that and you can either have a the and then it has this a source field or type field. And you can either the source can either be a tract or a logger. If it's a track, you've got additional fields to describe the track, if it's a logger, you just have a contact ID for the logger. Now, so it's so so that's the one model. The other model is to the other model is to is more like the is more like the individual payments

Unknown Speaker  51:13
option. So and there's good

Speaker 3  51:28
there is no right answer. I mean, there's not a clear right or wrong answer actually.

Matthias Miller  51:38
Well, there are pros and cons to each

Unknown Speaker  51:41
yet one of the cons to the source

Matthias Miller  51:49
is that unless you bypass contacts completely

Unknown Speaker  51:52
you're going to

Matthias Miller  51:56
I mean, we could we could change lagered sources not to be tied to a contact but if you typed your contact when you said the contact then you said the logger Yeah. Oh noxious, but you can have a screen that says hey, you haven't set the logger yet. Click this button boom creates a logger for

Speaker 2  52:14
you. Yeah, it is a little weird. But then the weird thing with the payment record is

Matthias Miller  52:26
you almost have to make it a do you make it a lookup record so that you can auto create new payments if there's no unpaid payment that you know what tie these things out to?

Matthias Miller  52:44
Or do you make them run a process to tie out all tallies to you know create create new payments where necessary and tie them out

Unknown Speaker  52:55
to them Okay,

Speaker 3  53:00
talk to me a bit I've got one more thing I'm I'm churning around talk to me about tracks is attract always do they ever own. There's always strikes

Unknown Speaker  53:11
from me, it's always

Matthias Miller  53:16
it's never their own. I mean, you might effectively be made contracted out for a fixed fixed rate or percentage. Sure, sure. But okay.

Speaker 3  53:26
But even with so with a tract, isn't there a contact involved with a tract as well?

Unknown Speaker  53:31
Yes, but you can have multiple owners.

Speaker 3  53:34
Oh, nasty. So you have to send split the money in different directions with a single track. Okay, that answers my question because I had toyed with putting the creating a track record button the payments were just on the owners contact record.

Unknown Speaker  53:57
But that doesn't work so well. So

Matthias Miller  54:17
the other fun thing at some point, if we do a QuickBooks sync, don't have to think through how to

Unknown Speaker  54:25
link these out to multiple payment transactions. I think

Matthias Miller  54:31
we can. I don't know that we need to actually track this stuff in the database if we just use the percentages and

Unknown Speaker  54:37
round appropriately and make it work. Sure.

Speaker 3  55:02
Okay, let me let's go back to the tally so you have a tally coming in this is a load it's either from this logger or from this tract that made that's pretty clear and and it's got the the whole bunch of stuff about it

Speaker 3  55:31
and the payment is right now as you've designed it is the payment ID generated on the tally and then it's then it's, it's added to the track or the contact or what were you thinking there? No, the way it's designed now is the track always has a blank payment with a

Matthias Miller  55:49
new payment ID and that's the only way to manage the Multi Record relationships to make sure that these can be linked together without needing to run some kind of process to do the linking. Right. And that can be as simple as if you'll change expression on save to make sure to add a blank row if it's you know,

Unknown Speaker  56:06
if necessary. Now, so is there a

Speaker 3  56:15
Wait What if I get two logs in two loads in for the for this same track? Is that

Unknown Speaker  56:22
a single payment?

Matthias Miller  56:24
Eileen Yes, it was sort of accumulating on that payment ID

Speaker 3  56:28
ah until you make a payment so okay until you make a payment and you just do a search to figure out how much is there and then you enter your payment and then that ties those out and then you start a new one

Unknown Speaker  56:53
now here's an option yeah

Matthias Miller  57:00
you could continue having the track type you can have an audit net okay, this is warning this is getting into the magic so I don't know if we want to go here but you could have your count which is basically a track record and on the contact record on the save

Unknown Speaker  57:17
you would you would

Matthias Miller  57:23
you would generate you would stop a random ID and do a hidden field that would cause this thing to get created and then every everywhere we would just show the link contact name instead of the underlying ID

Speaker 3  57:39
we did this somewhere and we were either did it or design that and then

Matthias Miller  57:46
where was that? It was it was in z and H when we actually stuffed meaningful information into the ID Okay, yeah,

Speaker 3  57:55
I remembered I need something was a little bit good memory yeah so good times good times it's definitely like CNAs to make me smile

Matthias Miller  58:09
sheet

Unknown Speaker  58:27
so here you would if it's a logger?

Unknown Speaker  59:09
Okay, a really

Speaker 3  59:10
bad idea, just tossing it out, just in case.

Unknown Speaker  59:13
It is. Yeah. But

Speaker 3  59:17
he says we're opposed to bad ideas. You could make the tracks a special contact type.

Unknown Speaker  59:28
Oh, that's not terrible.

Speaker 3  59:33
So it would have a type of tract we would call it an organization. I mean, it's a bit of a stretch. I probably put an insertion point across the top that would that would put all the track fields very prominent across the top and you'd have all sorts of I mean, either we see if they can tolerate all the contact information down below.

Matthias Miller  1:00:00
or, or not? Well, or you put it all in a child screen, and you make them jump into a child screen to edit it. Like, the report would always drill into the chat.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:17
Excuse me? That was my lunch that might have you

Matthias Miller  1:00:21
might be both. Excuse me, I'm sure. And then you would just exclude them from other reports.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:30
I mean it's a little

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
wonky. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
I've yet to see a situation where we've done that we've been like, wow, we're so glad we use questionnaires for inspections. Yeah. Yeah. Although part of that was the hyper customization. Okay, here's another idea. We could also use my random ID generator

Speaker 2  1:01:06
for payment ideas. And so when you save a tally,

Matthias Miller  1:01:13
we say Do we have any payments tied out to this? Excuse me? If so,

Speaker 2  1:01:20
we're gonna go do that. And

Matthias Miller  1:01:27
and we're gonna pick that one. Otherwise, we're going to create a new random ID and

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
create a new payment record.

Matthias Miller  1:01:36
Makes sense that payment records have bizarre random underlying IDs. That don't make any sense. Yes, sure. Sure. Now,

Speaker 3  1:01:47
and then on initially initialization, the payment record, but how does the payment record? No. It would just need to go hunting out there to figure out what who it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:02
Or you don't know that we can populate it? Why didn't

Speaker 3  1:02:19
it work to have to put in good information having to put meaningful information into the into the list

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
item? Or didn't work?

Matthias Miller  1:02:33
I think the issue was we were changing the list.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
Item on save.

Matthias Miller  1:02:44
But we could have our payment ID the payment ID could be am I logger attract? And what's the record ID of that? And then what's my random ID? Like there's nothing wrong with that is there?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:00
Now thanks.

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
Then you just have a field chain expression that populates those fields based off the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
copy ID then wait a second. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:03:30
Okay, now we can't look up anything off of because the list item is going to be saved? I think before the the talent Wreckfest saved. Right. So I don't think we can look up anything off of there. So we do have to stop in anything we want to fill in with.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:53
So we can't

Matthias Miller  1:03:55
we can tie it to the source. And we can type the type but we can't tie out the tally record.

Speaker 2  1:04:00
Correct? Correct. So so

Speaker 3  1:04:15
the so the payment ID would just become type plus source record plus random ID. And the source record is really just

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
well, okay,

Speaker 3  1:04:30
the source record is the would you make it the track name as of when we started looking for I mean, or would you would you make it the numeric ID?

Matthias Miller  1:04:44
The list number less numbers? Sure.

Speaker 3  1:04:47
Sure. So as long as you're not merging anything well, even if you merge it we I guess we just don't trust it very far. So if you ever merge them Have you ever merged contacts, then the list numbers will still I mean, we won't fix up IDs, but it doesn't matter, because we've already fielded the source record separately. Right? Does that make sense? I mean, we do just we do keep this as as pretty much random.

Matthias Miller  1:05:21
I mean, I think this is payment ID. Yeah. And somewhere, we just need to say, Look, guys, like, you cannot trust these numbers. This is for initialization only. Nothing more. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
Yeah. Yep.

Speaker 3  1:05:43
I mean, that's not bad. So now, okay. But you would first when when you're doing this, you first check to see if there's an open payment that you can use otherwise, you create a new one,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
correct? Yeah, yeah. No, it's that's, I

Speaker 3  1:06:04
think that's pretty clean, because then you can have a report of open and closed payments, which is really

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
clean.

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
Okay, and then, one possible caveat with this is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20
what was my caveat? Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:06:21
so on the payment record, so we'll have to write index expressions to get things like

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
oh,

Matthias Miller  1:06:34
like down payment balances, will basically do an MDX sum or something, to find out, what we're planning to do on the payment, the payment says, we're going to pay you for no loads, but we're going to pay you 5000 down payment. And then the next time we pay $10,000 worth of loads, and we debit $1,000 off your down payment. So so they like to distribute the, you know, recoup the down payment over over a couple payments or something to improve cash flow early on, because better emotional hit to the client.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
Sure, sure.

Matthias Miller  1:07:14
And so that just means for calculating these totals, either we have to have a report, or you know, I mean, ultimately, what it means is we have to have an index that doesn't do something any except to find those balances. Sure, sure. Yep. Which is fine. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
I think it's reasonable.

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
And then it also means that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
when

Matthias Miller  1:07:34
you can't create payments directly on the I mean, obviously, you can't create payment, like we'll have to have a new payment link or something from the tract. If that's why they know that that's actually ever really necessary. It might be like for down payments. Sure. They'll have to save and create a new payment and do it that way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Nick, is, is this clear enough in your head that you could go ripping through this and revamp this or

Unknown Speaker  1:08:11
shoot a sunrise from scratch? Somewhere summary.

Speaker 3  1:08:22
This is being recorded. So if we say what time it is, can I just give a verbal description of what's going on? Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:08:33
let me let me stop my share, and then that'll be easy to find. Sure.

Speaker 3  1:08:41
So what we are doing is we're creating a payments record. And a payment. Particular tracks, there'll be a, there'll be a payment type field that says I'm a tracked payment, or I'm a I'm a logger payment. But either that or you just have to list fields and you eat can specify one or the other. I'm not sure which ones which way is better that might be adequate just have to list fields to fill in.

Matthias Miller  1:09:20
Well, we have similar list on the we're gonna have a similar list on the tally. So I don't know why we wouldn't.

Speaker 3  1:09:25
So just use that lucky use that list field. And then you've got the Type field and then you've got one for a contact field if it's a logger and a track field, if it's a tract the this is a payments is probably is a is probably a lookup list. And it's got an ID that is is a somewhat what is somewhat random but it's essential. The and it's typically is yeah, it's tip, it's type hyphen list number of the source hyphen random number

Matthias Miller  1:10:19
except instead of hyphens use underscores or something to account for negatives.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
Sure, that'd be fine. Yeah. And then

Speaker 3  1:10:42
when you create a tally, you for you want to see on the tally, we're going to have a payment ID. And you'll have a macro that's called something like, find, oh, open payment or unpaid payment. And that will just for your, for your source, we'll go to see if we have an open payment for that source. And if so, you just set your payment ID to that one. And otherwise, you'll have a macro that's called Generate new payment ID, which takes source list number, and adds a random number. And then you store that new add into your payment field. Now your payment field on the on the tally payment date, it'll be called tally payment ID, the tally payment ID, because here's where the magic happens. The tally payment ID is a list field, we've set it to what the new record ID is going to be. And then when you save the tally, it will automatically save that new item to the list and automatically create a payment record tied to that new payment ID. Does that make sense? And when you so on initialization of the new record, you say, Oh, I've got a new payment ID I need to initialize myself. And you say okay, well you fill it, you scrape out the the two, the first two parts from your ID one is your type. And then the other one is your well, it's your type. It's your contact, if you're a contact, it's your tract if you're attract, and you fill in your payment fields based off of that. All hunky dory Yep.
