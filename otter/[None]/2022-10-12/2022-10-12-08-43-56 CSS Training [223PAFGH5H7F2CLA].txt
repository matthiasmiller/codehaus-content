Unknown Speaker  06:47
Hello good morning. Good morning I'm already putting the carpet stay in a shoe.

Matthias Miller  07:02
Was there anything else that besides EBS?

Unknown Speaker  07:07
Oh I sent an email about

Unknown Speaker  07:16
about linking about

Speaker 1  07:19
incorrectly linked incidents in CC have

Matthias Miller  07:29
bajillion emails at sea in my inbox

Unknown Speaker  07:33
is it how much pain is it causing

Speaker 1  07:38
it's not causing that much pain it's causing like two jobs to show up in the data input needed email and they shouldn't be but it's not it's minor.

Unknown Speaker  07:50
Okay one three, okay. Good.

Matthias Miller  07:59
Me, we I can try to if I know it's that I can try to

Matthias Miller  08:10
there's an update from Janelle And by the way I don't know what oh, you can use with my and that needs to be

Matthias Miller  08:32
so let me go ahead and schedule that day while I'm thinking about it. schedule tasks cch ad hoc update my bias

Speaker 2  08:42
cch update today

Matthias Miller  08:46
okay, so that'll go live tonight unless we could probably actually almost

Unknown Speaker  08:51
see using the system Alan was in the system you me let me see he's working only well we're gonna need this for the nevermind

Matthias Miller  09:12
I was gonna see we got to know people we're going to use a system for this probably not

Unknown Speaker  09:19
Yeah. Report Okay, let's get back to so this is all payments. Okay, well,

Speaker 1  09:47
let's do this slightly, slightly sobering. I looked at the dashboard report and it says that there's like 25 to do in EMS.

Matthias Miller  09:57
bits that is a bit

Unknown Speaker  10:07
That's a bit sobering

Matthias Miller  10:55
Hi I'm Sophie confused 5k in law and payment 10k and likely owe them 5k But they want to leave the 5k

Speaker 1  11:09
Yeah so sometimes they want to they want to keep cash flow going to grease the wheels with the customer and make them feel a little happier so they won't

Unknown Speaker  11:26
recoup the

Speaker 1  11:28
all of the down payment immediately because they weren't I mean that they said they just find that the whole logging process goes better if they have if the client keeps getting money along the way. So basically they just hold back

Unknown Speaker  11:56
make sense?

Speaker 1  11:57
back some of the recouping some of the down payment and the next month or whatever

Unknown Speaker  12:01
payment

Matthias Miller  12:39
Are they are they literally wanting to know ticket 5k Down payment they take 1000 out and one month and 1000 2003 1004

Speaker 1  12:59
I don't think it would typically be I mean for from what they said I don't think it would typically be like four times but it could be twice

Speaker 2  13:08
twice I'm not 100% sure on that but boy it was B once well. See how

Matthias Miller  13:47
I might want to do this

Matthias Miller  13:57
one option would be to have a debit credit system

Unknown Speaker  14:02
where you have an orgy of down payments and you know positive

Matthias Miller  14:15
values and you make a down payment and negative values and your goal would be to zero it out.

Unknown Speaker  15:47
What do you think of that

Matthias Miller  15:54
there's this little part of me that says I don't know there's this little part of me that says

Unknown Speaker  16:02
it's completely independent from payments

Matthias Miller  16:16
when you tie them out to two payments though what is okay here's another concern about how we tie this out to payments so the other option would be on the payments or G to say how much down payment are you using towards this payment then you can tie it out totals come out correctly, you have a subtotal actually like that better

Unknown Speaker  17:00
and it certainly simplifies logic.

Speaker 1  18:11
We wanted to split as down payments used to down payment

Unknown Speaker  18:14
remaining Yes.

Matthias Miller  19:00
Expense withholding amount which is the so could we make the down payment

Matthias Miller  19:14
expense withholding amount basically means you're building up a balance Okay, so So what if we have a credit debit credit system that has a word down payments and expense withholdings can go in

Unknown Speaker  19:38
and so if it's expense withholding.

Matthias Miller  19:50
The main thing we need to look at what would be the equivalent

Matthias Miller  20:03
Anything with the accounting equivalent would be on a balance sheet? And I mean, on a balance sheet, you might actually have a

Unknown Speaker  20:24
what if we call

Matthias Miller  20:25
down payments and expense withholding something like customer credit?

Unknown Speaker  20:47
Got to clean up the boundaries a little bit.

Matthias Miller  20:52
We had it as customer credit, and then we and then we allowed you to well, okay, hang on the expense withholding, does that always come out of a payment?

Speaker 1  21:09
Yeah. I think so. Because I think it's treated essentially the same as a down payment as far as how it interacts with customer payments, but it is. It doesn't. I feel like it's it could be valuable.

Unknown Speaker  21:33
To have it separate. I don't know. What if we did this? What if we had

Matthias Miller  21:47
to cut? What if we did away with a down payment amount? So if you do a down payment

Unknown Speaker  21:55
it would just be a payment

Matthias Miller  21:59
row not tied out to any tally or pulpwood loads? And it would have a

Unknown Speaker  22:07
oh, what's the number it would have a

Matthias Miller  22:15
it would have a down payment it would have a down payment adjustment column and it would have an expense

Unknown Speaker  22:26
withholding column two now,

Matthias Miller  22:49
how are we going to include other? Don't we have an option to include to have other expenses that need miscellaneous expenses that no.

Unknown Speaker  23:06
Yeah, there's miscellaneous expenses or gee,

Matthias Miller  23:09
that's for payments that they're making out. So but these expense withholding accounts get paid out of those get paid out of their percentages or whatever. They're not built directly to that Yeah. Here's where I wonder if we could almost maybe this is to simplify. If you wanted to simplify way down, you could simply have a credit column. So on a down payment, in the credit column credit notes on a down payment, you would add a payment row it would not be linked to anything and it would have a $5,000 and negative $5,000 credit

Unknown Speaker  23:59
so you're saying you're saying that's the first payment rule that's ever added?

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Yes. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then they would then when they and then on the expense

Matthias Miller  24:28
they would have with expense withholding, they would have a negative amount and that would still get zeroed out then at

Speaker 2  24:53
okay, so choose him as a single I think you've probably split him out for clarity. Well

Speaker 1  26:51
okay, so then you just add whenever you want to. I see Yeah, so if you're wanting to recoup some of your down payment when you add your payment row you just add a negative however much in the down payment column

Unknown Speaker  27:07
Yes. Elder Care and pastoral work I think that's actually going to fix this. So I still think this one here is my recommendation

Matthias Miller  28:57
if you ever need insight into how my brain works, somebody once observed that a self guiding missile is filled with 1000 You know, does not actually set a single target, but it's it uses you know 1000s of micro corrections. Not unlike your hand looks for something in the dark. So you're like way over here and we're here and then over here over here. Hopefully you land on something that's alright. So if I'm ever confusing, you're trying to figure out what my brain is doing. My brain is going way off to the left and we're off to the right and then trying to find its way back to the middle so

Unknown Speaker  29:39
yeah. Do you do you like this?

Speaker 1  29:43
Yes, I do like it. It's it's a lot cleaner than having two separate

Unknown Speaker  29:48
number fields. Yeah, how do we

Unknown Speaker  29:56
do Totals Row, total rows on an RG?

Matthias Miller  30:02
You just put them in a little labels underneath it

Unknown Speaker  30:05
okay so we don't actually have like a total row keyword or something nope it'd be really cool if we did that we can't get to Florida we have to

Matthias Miller  30:41
understand why it seems like the images recently quit working again but

Unknown Speaker  30:45
sure why

Speaker 1  30:46
Yeah, I think Tim said sometimes you have to refresh

Unknown Speaker  30:49
to get them to

Speaker 1  30:52
work and that really worked for him the time's right it's so

Unknown Speaker  30:56
weird would they be okay

Matthias Miller  31:27
with having this be a

Unknown Speaker  31:31
harvested

Matthias Miller  31:47
does this have to be on the detail screen or can it be a report?

Unknown Speaker  32:08
Probably could be record is a report that's not a I mean it's specters detail skin section but well. Right Bye. Should See Think the bottom report

Matthias Miller  35:25
bottom report oh boy I gotta drop in the bottom yeah I did not allow some time here

Unknown Speaker  35:35
so I'm gonna say this oh well what do you think of that um

Unknown Speaker  36:56
I think it'd be fine I don't know that I've ever done that

Unknown Speaker  36:58
mean oh string table what it's I don't remember what it's called we use it in client scope

Unknown Speaker  37:28
so you basically have to have a you get your list of species and then get your amounts total them up the total road becomes a bit obnoxious

Matthias Miller  37:50
I think

Speaker 1  37:52
sneaking suspicion that this is the type of thing that suddenly balloons in the inordinate amount of time spent doing it but it also wouldn't need to be that way

Unknown Speaker  38:28
do that you guys are gonna have to wait priorities I thought we were only using this is the first time we're using So

Speaker 1  39:07
the deal is that most of their they always use oil but most of them numbers come in, in international

Speaker 1  39:23
I mean occasionally, I forget where they're getting these numbers from but occasionally they'll get they'll come into

Unknown Speaker  39:30
oil. Most people are using international

Matthias Miller  39:35
International. I mean I think drugless is

Speaker 2  42:30
So are you saying using the Ask prompt in the show completed tracks acts as prompting

Speaker 1  42:42
me you can't use you can't reference other ask prompt names in a in a list as prompts

Speaker 2  42:50
list definitely we could have a remind yeah

Matthias Miller  43:45
doesn't seem terrible to me but correct me if I'm thinking about Iran

Unknown Speaker  43:51
include states are being used on tracks shouldn't be a whole lot less than that be

Matthias Miller  44:32
all right well, I'm going to ping you when I'm off this next call and we can

Speaker 2  44:37
circle back up and keep going. Sure. Sounds good. We should

Unknown Speaker  44:41
see
