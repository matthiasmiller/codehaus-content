I think people in business are very familiar with the idea of the pyramid, like top down, like, here's the boss, and all the way down to the bottom of the organization. So and and even people who try to build scalable models in business tend to use the same type of language. So network marketing has been called the pyramid scheme, because you've got the uplines and everybody down there who, who benefits from that. But you can take that, you can flip it upside down and and you, rather than building a series of downlines, which is which is implicitly constrained. You flip it upside down, and you have a self you have some form of self replicating system. So in this case, the my client had a particular Marketing methodology that that fit well with this, and and had a training centered around it, and could and and so rather than, you know, let's go occupy this market, a way to shift the perspective on what he was looking to do was, let's go build People who mastered this technique. And then let's have them go replicate it with the people in proximity to themselves. And then let's go, let's go expand that further so that those people gain mastery, and then they they spread to the people around them. So it's, it's contrasting the difference between a, once again, pyramid structure, top down constraint, or a, I guess, another way to say this is that it's, it's building a viral component to business so that so it becomes self replicating, and it doesn't face the same kinds of constraints that most most businesses do if.
