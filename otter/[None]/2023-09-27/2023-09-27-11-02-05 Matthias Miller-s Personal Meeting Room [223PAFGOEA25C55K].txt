Unknown Speaker  00:37
either Hello?

Unknown Speaker  01:41
Hello

Unknown Speaker  01:49
You saw me there?

Unknown Speaker  01:59
So

Speaker 1  02:02
I just have we just have a short list here unless you have you have things to cover as well.

Matthias Miller  02:11
biggest question I would have is at some point I would like to set another deadline date between now and the end of the year and go over the list of things that we would like to have done before then. And I'm trying to remember, Dev priorities is the 27th. And I wonder if we should, at some point, just basically go through a list again and say, Where are we at in what do we want to have done by October 27? So

Unknown Speaker  02:50
you're thinking in the next two weeks do that? What are you thinking,

Matthias Miller  02:55
given that we're so close to her September 30 had been are going to first deadline. And so I'd probably like to do it sooner rather than even even sooner rather than later. Just if we wait too long. We're going to be halfway to that. Yeah. I

Speaker 1  03:19
wonder if we should plan for next, like next Wednesday?

Unknown Speaker  03:25
I think that would.

Unknown Speaker  03:37
Be we're, I think our third or fourth? Good.

Unknown Speaker  03:55
Yeah, I think that's good. Anything else you have

Unknown Speaker  03:59
for us? Okay. So

Speaker 1  04:03
payroll module updates. Employee verification report, is that what you referenced is going live with the next update? Okay, which is I just included my marked up deal again, that's basically setting it to be conditional. If it's a salaried employee and getting rid of the quantity and rate and just

Unknown Speaker  04:25
like similar.

Unknown Speaker  04:27
Is it pretty much like this marked up? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:30
Okay. It is. I mean, would it be helpful to I can push those changes live if it'd be helpful to test before? I know we're wanting to start some things Monday. It'd be helpful to push that live before then. Before the update. It would be an option. Yeah, no.

Speaker 1  04:46
I mean, what would be what would be helpful as if you could just send us an example say for shed 10 columns label for this, the current week Is that easy to do?

Matthias Miller  05:04
I could do it for a like, beginning of August, or possibly I might even have this time period in my

Speaker 1  05:11
that's fine. Yeah. Any salaried employee? That's yeah. Ideally, if you could do a salaried employee for shift, and that would be good. And then the second thing was a B include owner payout bonus on his employee report C attached, is that possible to do to do that?

Matthias Miller  05:45
That would be if it's an owner, you would just have another line that says payout owner payout bonus.

Speaker 1  05:56
That Aegis, either that or we would just ideally, it would come over automatically just could could we just show that as the salary instead? Does that make you complicated

Matthias Miller  06:08
as the weekly salary? Yeah. Let me take a look. At should be fine.

Unknown Speaker  06:24
You're saying that should be possible?

Matthias Miller  06:27
Yes, it should be possible. I mean, we take a look at the implications, obits shouldn't be a huge deal. Okay.

Speaker 1  06:34
And then see where that takes us to the senior, elite extra for payroll items, this appears to be one that we are able to edit. And I just see now that that's the one that we're using, like district exponents, if we could just, that's always going to be called a district X bonus, and we can just replace the extra with the district X bonus, that would be good. And maybe that's something Drew can do with the correct permissions, I don't know. But

Matthias Miller  07:07
the best way to do that is if I rename it to district X, bonus, on my end, then if there, there is anything that happens to be in the system like that, it'll be it'll switch the extras over.

Speaker 1  07:22
Okay. And we already we just created the district exponents, I guess, if you need to, you can just delete it.

Matthias Miller  07:30
It'll just just work. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:39
Good. So

Speaker 1  07:40
the, we discovered group formations don't allow him full access to payroll, he can only see the time tracking portion. So can you change that to that?

Matthias Miller  07:49
Yeah. Let me just do that. Now while we're talking about it.

Speaker 1  07:53
And maybe I don't know, if you want to just share your screen? And just, it might be helpful for you?

Unknown Speaker  07:59
Or would it be helpful to do this?

Unknown Speaker  08:01
Yeah, just to go over what's there.

Matthias Miller  08:05
Okay, so we've got under admin, user group administration, you are not able to change your own permissions. That kind of defeats the purpose. Here's your user account. If we look at here there's some payroll permissions you're missing. So I drill in Wait, maybe we need to take a look at actual let's let's take a look at what the accounting

Unknown Speaker  08:48
admin

Matthias Miller  08:53
should Whitney be able to change compensation settings?

Speaker 1  09:00
I mean, no, I'm not. No, he shouldn't. But if I wouldn't be worried if she could, I guess.

Matthias Miller  09:12
I mean, this is flagged as an accounting admin. And so I think if we think that perhaps you shouldn't, and we should make another group for just different accounting roles.

Speaker 1  09:26
Is Whitney, the only person that has accounting admin access Whitney and drew?

Matthias Miller  09:37
Yeah, then Ben and Duane do as well.

Speaker 1  09:42
I'm fine with just adding, like the accounting admins that the accounts payable accounts receivable people won't be. Will they be set the accounting admin at some point?

Matthias Miller  09:56
I mean, they shouldn't. I don't know why you would.

Speaker 1  10:00
Then let's just add that information to that group.

Matthias Miller  10:04
The main thing would be to, perhaps communicate with Dwayne, whenever we think Dwayne would know not to make them an accounting admin. But he would, he's probably going to be the guy sitting, setting them up. I guess we could even take a look with groups. Do you know who I forget who's working in? In AP?

Speaker 1  10:29
Shannon Jones does most of that work? Shannon and Hazel?

Matthias Miller  10:40
No, she has permission to edit.

Speaker 1  10:42
Oh, okay. But she does. She's the one that's entering timecard payroll information, all of that. So she would have to have that. Right. You'd have to have that. Yeah. I think she's okay. She, Alison. Alison, also does some work with.

Matthias Miller  11:02
So she also does,

Speaker 1  11:05
because they're the two that work in or that are currently doing the payroll data entry.

Matthias Miller  11:14
Trying to think if we, I mean, if we store because we're storing compensation information on the timecard? I kind of I'm not completely sure. That might influence whether we need that or not.

Matthias Miller  11:35
Might I'm not 100%? Sure. But why? Well, yeah, it just depends how you want to want to. Well, why don't

Speaker 1  11:54
we just set it for Drew? Just? Can you just set it individual rather than

Matthias Miller  12:03
juice? Got it? On? Oh, just set it for Drew personally, instead of the?

Unknown Speaker  12:07
Yeah, I think that might be better.

Matthias Miller  12:16
I'm trying to think if I can do that, if no, it has to be. It has to be in a group at 150 users. There should be this is probably not high on Dwayne's. I want to do this list. But it seems at some point that some kind of security and permissions audit wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to do.

Unknown Speaker  12:37
Yeah, sure.

Matthias Miller  12:42
So well, I guess it's not 150 active users, it's, it's well, 100 331 active users, some of them being CCIE. Or?

Unknown Speaker  12:53
Yeah, well,

Matthias Miller  12:56
we've got we've got 10 of those being

Unknown Speaker  13:01
being external. So yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:06
Well, that gives them access and I think do you should we should we note this is something to come back to as far as taking a look at who can who can access what we're

Unknown Speaker  13:20
even getting down on your list? I think we should

Matthias Miller  13:25
let's just do this. Not quite sure where it should be but.

Speaker 1  13:45
Yeah, deductions to net so you want to just explain what you're looking for there. And we want to make sure that

Unknown Speaker  14:04
and then

Unknown Speaker  14:08
all right. ls your list now go back to your list?

Speaker 1  14:16
Could we do a quick just a real quick crash bars of the payroll module the parts that you cannot see this?

Matthias Miller  14:25
Yeah. As far as how the payroll module works and where the different pieces are?

Unknown Speaker  14:30
Yeah, just

Unknown Speaker  14:32
Yeah. So those are the three horses that have

Unknown Speaker  14:36
already had.

Matthias Miller  14:40
Sorry, these are the

Speaker 2  14:42
right that's what I already was looking for. Okay.

Matthias Miller  14:47
Have you taken a look at the builder configuration as well?

Matthias Miller  14:56
So this is I mean, this is company wide. I mean, this is builder specific settings. Pay Period with bi weekly monthly company types of pools is a parent of three types of child companies. And the owner payout and pool payout to name payouts are being used. payroll reports that are going out, break times are used to automatically inject break times. So somebody clocks in from eight to five, but there's a break time from three to 315, we'll subtract the three to 315. From that custom payroll, custom vacation days, people handle vacation days differently. So we we said we're gonna give you full control over how that gets calculated. build our holidays. This is then where the production totals get stored on a weekly basis. Once we freeze payroll, and then track of when we verify payroll, which will lock down time cards for that period.

Speaker 1  16:00
But those updates have all been that locking all of those additional fields down when Okay, perfect.

Matthias Miller  16:11
So employees, I don't know that. So you saw this? Is there any any further explanation or commentary you need on this?

Unknown Speaker  16:21
This is just settings,

Matthias Miller  16:23
like compensation settings.

Unknown Speaker  16:26
Oh, okay. And that was on the employee tab.

Unknown Speaker  16:29
Yeah, yeah. One thing,

Speaker 1  16:36
one thing that would be helpful that we were looking for is where the timecard and the payroll items are entered, and you just walk through through that. I think it's pretty self explanatory. But

Unknown Speaker  16:51
payroll.

Matthias Miller  16:55
Thought it was here. So you would go into, okay, so you got to go to payroll, go to timecards, enter, it's going to shed time shows the list on the on the left. And you just hit edit here. It looks like trying to remember how these different companies I thought were set up different ways. Some of them do total number of hours, and somebody's starting in time. So if it's total number of hours, then it's just, you know, who nine 9.5 If it's Well, that's weird. Okay, we don't allow that. But if it's, you know, if it started in time, it might be something like that. And this is this is an example of the warning, it looks like payroll has been verified already. Now, here's

Speaker 1  17:53
where we were, for some reason, we weren't able to see that. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:58
When you go into edit mode, there won't show until you go into edit mode, and you start making and it jumps down. Okay. That's why that's the

Speaker 1  18:12
hero. I currently show the list that that you said, probably.

Speaker 2  18:17
Yeah, that would be the one I wouldn't be expecting to see. Anyway.

Matthias Miller  18:23
Let me make a quick. Let's always show that warning, even if we're not in edit mode, because otherwise you'll never actually see the warning because of how we so generously. Remove in edit mode from

Unknown Speaker  18:43
Tang or third Red Label, okay.

Matthias Miller  18:49
Yeah, payroll items are down here. Break times are copied from the company. So it's frozen on here on the timecard. I don't know it's so yeah. And then you just hit save and keep keep going down the list. And then at that point, we've got the with triggers those reports going out. Mark, do you know,

Speaker 1  19:20
currently there has been sent manually when when they're done with at some point. I think the thought was to set them up at a scheduled time just like we do Accounts Payable verification reports, but currently, those are being sent manually, which is fine for the time being. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:40
So these are the That's right. Thank you. So these are the verification reports finalized payroll then says we're good to go. And that will run on a

Speaker 1  19:52
wait, here you can see shutdown has been finalized. So yeah,

Matthias Miller  19:57
yep. So there's a little menu fly out spread Here's the most streamlined way that you would go in and hit finalized payroll for whatever has been finalized. Which

Speaker 2  20:10
when you hit that it would simply just run the process now archived. Yep,

Matthias Miller  20:19
exactly. Then we have this guy, which if you ever come to, particularly myself, but Seth or myself with questions about how payroll works, or any of us, our first thing first answer is probably going to be this report. And it's not the speediest but it sure is detailed. And this has every last possible factor. Just because I like random trivia that doesn't matter. All 52 columns you can export to Excel and do whatever you need to with but I mean, this is the this is the x ray machine of the payroll module.

Speaker 1  21:15
And it does get really really complex I mean it is it is maybe it is really complicated. I mean to try and wrap your head around the way to overtime call it when you have people working at two different inputs not full production and non production they have overtime and if you want to make some minutes I'm happy with where we're at. But it's it's one of those things that relate more than five minutes to understand that percentage well this is great

Matthias Miller  21:51
this is one of my we've got to have this or we're gonna be in trouble kind of things and I'm very grateful we did Steph is is he's he's young but he's a smart developer. And you know when Seth starts talking about things being complicated that you probably you probably hit some upper limits of how far we go update payroll what all does this update this is everything

Unknown Speaker  22:37
what is this do

Matthias Miller  22:43
this updates the frozen the Okay, I think I'd have to figure out exactly what all it updates but I believe it updates these numbers on all pay cart I'll timecards across the whole system which it should prompt for company and week at a minimum

Unknown Speaker  23:10
and

Matthias Miller  23:13
I'm not even sure like why do we even

Matthias Miller  23:24
it's a little scary to me to have this just sitting on the menu

Unknown Speaker  23:31
like what would it update

Matthias Miller  23:34
let's let's let me find a list

Speaker 1  23:37
are you saying like I will pull it off and that's fine too

Unknown Speaker  23:45
well, I mean

Matthias Miller  23:47
the whole idea of having something like this that updates all timecards tries to update all time cards across all time is just that's not even useful and really not what we want. Okay, so let's go to timecard store date

Unknown Speaker  24:17
timecard stored date

Matthias Miller  24:23
okay, we only do it for unverified Okay, well, that's good. We only do it for unverified grades word pride

Unknown Speaker  24:47
so

Matthias Miller  24:54
it will not update the actual PTO hourly rate Um, we'll update the company, the employee type in the compensation type, it will update the work hours in the production hours. And it will update the total payroll effective hours. It will update the employee display here. Yeah, it will, it'll update the stored values for calculation section down here.

Speaker 1  25:29
So what's the use case? Like when when would we use this?

Matthias Miller  25:36
You went in and you forgot, you enter time cards before you remember to update compensation for all the employees and you enter time cards, then you go change employee compensation. And you and you do it for more than when I'm employed. And you don't want to just

Unknown Speaker  25:59
you think

Matthias Miller  26:02
you should be able to just manually go in here and make one simple little change, save it, and it would update those numbers if it's not verified.

Speaker 1  26:13
So it vie for situations where you enter time cards, and after you've entered the hours, then you realize, oh, you had to make a two of these people needed to enter the race, on their hourly rate, or whatever. And then

Unknown Speaker  26:37
yes,

Matthias Miller  26:40
this was before. Soon after we coded this a bit after we coded this, we added a totaling feature to the platform which can maintain background totals. The reason for this the reason that we do it like this is because the calculations are so complicated that if you don't store some of these on the timecard some of the frozen numbers on the dirt, some cash numbers on the timecard it becomes unbearably slow updates the stored values word calculations for any or

Matthias Miller  27:39
I mean, the least we could do is

Unknown Speaker  27:42
oops okay.

Matthias Miller  27:51
The least we can do is at least give an explanation about what it's going to do before you do it

Matthias Miller  28:07
employees pay due

Unknown Speaker  28:10
does this

Matthias Miller  28:15
could we have this show a blank report if payroll has not been verified or finalized?

Speaker 1  28:28
I mean, isn't wouldn't that be ideal that would?

Matthias Miller  28:32
Yeah, I mean, I would think so. Yeah.

Speaker 2  28:37
Because until you certify that that's what it's supposed to be. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  28:46
I'm just afraid otherwise it will run into Yeah, I don't know. There's there's no other stopgap to make sure that the verification that finalizing actually happens.

Speaker 1  28:59
Oh, I remain zero until it's finalized. Otherwise, somebody could just go ahead and process payroll never finalize it and they need to be open to edit.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
Yeah, perfect.

Matthias Miller  29:13
Then the exceptions report is basically

Unknown Speaker  29:18
are you doing that on your screen? We're still seeing the I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  29:23
I I switched I thought I was doing both I'm sorry. Yes, I am. So the do report you're familiar with but that's just that

Unknown Speaker  29:41
has also really slow

Matthias Miller  29:45
me faster, but we'll see. Okay, so then the other thing and then there's the exceptions report, which I believe gets emailed automatically. But these are all the Okay all the validation issues that we've got so Adam

Matthias Miller  30:13
is not configured for payroll right now so we shouldn't have some kind of way to

Unknown Speaker  30:26
why do we

Speaker 1  30:30
It looks like we're just showing all builders because we've got you know there's only six that we're

Unknown Speaker  30:36
actually

Unknown Speaker  30:40
lying to us for the time being

Matthias Miller  30:44
is this even is this this exception isn't even meaningful is it?

Unknown Speaker  30:48
No it's not let's

Unknown Speaker  30:55
let me just was this called look exceptions I know it's a little bit of a

Unknown Speaker  31:10
missing pay period exception

Matthias Miller  31:25
okay following employees or hourly or salaried employees using time tracking but do not have hours spent on their time cards,

Unknown Speaker  31:34
LeBron Shetler

Matthias Miller  31:37
so for some reason LeBron didn't have any looks like we didn't probably just didn't enter anything for cherrystone the work orders deducted from the employee pool $0 for the employee production bonus was negative some crazy amount

Matthias Miller  32:05
you know what that is? No

Unknown Speaker  32:08
How was it really bad we

Matthias Miller  32:12
built the buildings

Unknown Speaker  32:16
no I don't

Matthias Miller  32:24
we're sticking your nose into or should we

Unknown Speaker  32:31
Yeah, let's take a quick moment.

Unknown Speaker  32:33
So this would be I don't know where the best places to start but let's

Matthias Miller  32:50
so the

Speaker 1  32:53
but they're all straight hourly paid straight hourly. So there's no so why is the bonus pools negative? There should be no bonus pool like there's no because they're not paid a bonus pool so it's I don't know how we set up that company

Unknown Speaker  33:23
pay period monthly

Unknown Speaker  33:24
means often

Speaker 1  33:28
on our pay our company type parent company that's mean That's correct. Right just a company with straight hourly employees

Speaker 1  33:42
in the production, the pool Production Production pool percentage

Unknown Speaker  33:48
is blank

Unknown Speaker  33:54
we go to the

Unknown Speaker  34:06
prod bonus type and see how we use the production bonus

Unknown Speaker  34:15
yeah

Unknown Speaker  34:23
see what's outside of here that we do

Speaker 1  34:26
what why do this trivial question Why do developers work with black backgrounds?

Matthias Miller  34:35
I don't know. I started doing it recently and I liked it. So

Speaker 1  34:46
I figured it might have something to do with it's better for your eyes or something.

Matthias Miller  34:52
I think I did feel like the glare was probably less overwhelming but Okay so we have bonus type input builders that's unrelated stored tempered values we're not using that in any way

Unknown Speaker  35:21
prosper onis method this types

Matthias Miller  35:39
so is this is simple as

Unknown Speaker  35:49
already yeah right

Matthias Miller  35:53
out little bonus pool if we

Speaker 3  36:16
but he might as

Matthias Miller  36:21
well I mean I can change it to blank out I don't know what's going to

Unknown Speaker  36:28
well I think it could be helpful to look at the the company or the owner verification reports that might be sure yeah, let's do the company payroll

Unknown Speaker  36:47
your payroll verifications and final structures

Unknown Speaker  36:51
yeah for 917 Yep

Speaker 1  37:00
we've got production total the pool okay. The pool base pay Okay, that's just the sum total of all the the hourly pay which we're seeing down below in the second page 24 hour 17 minutes and $30 an hour sometimes a

Unknown Speaker  37:25
minute that that all looks correct

Matthias Miller  37:34
so we've got something that's hiding the this is the company

Speaker 1  37:42
is it only what's showing on the report or see seeing the amount of hey

Matthias Miller  37:50
yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  37:59
Production pool percentage pool total

Unknown Speaker  38:04
pride total

Unknown Speaker  38:12
let's go

Matthias Miller  38:32
think it's probably worth it probably worth checking into

Unknown Speaker  38:45
on yeah, let

Matthias Miller  38:48
me see what the implications are just blinking out that number and I mean, I can't imagine why would be an issue but to make sure that

Matthias Miller  39:14
okay, good. And that ends up. That's that.

Speaker 1  39:26
Yeah. Good. So I think that's all um, just a quick recap on payroll module is number one, you're going to send an example of a salaried employee. And then one B, you'll look at adding that to the next update. We already covered C I believe you. You renamed extra to district X bonus and that should all just work now.

Matthias Miller  39:55
Oh, I did not. I will have it on the next update.

Speaker 1  39:59
Sure. I took care of D and then E Drew's Drew's working on creating the required report for processing payroll should have this later the day, which should be expected. It's pretty straightforward. He just pulled together the right information then Okay, so we're still hoping to go live with this starting Monday but even if we may, just for the first week or two, just use the individual employee breakdowns and pass that off to Whitney for her to process payroll that should get us what we need to get started. Yeah, until we have that report. And then FDI allocation just basically a note saying that we've not done our homework yet on creating that process then there's one other thing that I didn't list here but the report sales orders meeting invoicing

Unknown Speaker  41:12
that report is

Speaker 1  41:20
it looks like we need to change the logic on that. Go to to the affordable barn company one four yesterday.

Matthias Miller  41:31
Huh? Yeah, give me give me a moment. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  41:38
If you can, if not, we can. I've got

Matthias Miller  41:41
it from my email. Oh. Timber. Wait. No, here, let's do this. Again, and.

Matthias Miller  42:06
So great. That's Indiana.

Unknown Speaker  42:08
Yeah. Ohio. So a great. Yeah. Okay. If you look at the Okay, the second one, the so that is a wholesale sale. And

Speaker 1  42:28
the, the idea logic on that? Can we here's what we want to say if possible. We have a building, we know when it's built, or we we have a building we know when it's built. And then does it have a transit tasks attached to it? If it does, then it shouldn't appear on this list until the delivery date is complete. It appears like we've like we said on the report, we said retail buildings will always have a transit task. All others will not. So does this one have a transit task attached?

Speaker 3  43:07
It's good to go. Yes. So preferred delivery.

Speaker 1  43:12
So until that transit task is until, okay, if there's multiple transit tasks until the ladder until the last transit task is completed, then it's not ready for invoicing.

Unknown Speaker  43:31
So, yeah. Is it?

Matthias Miller  43:38
If it has any transit tasks, then wait for the final delivery date. Otherwise they after it's built? Correct. Okay. Possible. Yes. So let's go here. And we would say and actually, let's let me just make a note

Speaker 1  44:05
of the reasons for the reasoning behind that is some wholesale buildings. We are responsible for delivery. We and others we're not if we do the delivery with our trucks, and there's going to be a transit task. And the sale does not happen until the delivery is done. If we don't if they pick it up, then we invoice the day after spilled.

Unknown Speaker  44:33
I will

Speaker 1  44:38
make that change. And it can vary. It can vary depending on the season and the workload for a

Unknown Speaker  44:47
wholesale builder.

Speaker 1  44:50
So, do you feel like we can accurately match that logic?

Matthias Miller  44:58
I mean, we it's As long as the transit task is completed correctly, we'll just check whether it has any transit tasks attached. Yeah, I don't see any issue with that.

Speaker 1  45:09
Perfect. Then the the other caveat is on sheds direct buildings. All buildings built by his rank were in invoicing on this list we're inviting day after build. However, Josh set up a set it up to work every Monday morning, it invoices. Every Monday morning, it invoices. All the buildings built the prior week. So if we could match that, okay, and what he's doing is he he stamps in a delivery date, he takes all the checks, right Billings. Every Monday morning at seven, he goes through and looks What did we build for sheds wreck last week, and then gives it a little bit a delivery date of that Monday.

Matthias Miller  45:59
But they won't have transit task attached?

Speaker 1  46:01
They will not. So if we could match that logic as well that would

Matthias Miller  46:09
and so if it has transit tasks, or we're looking at or it's not district x

Speaker 1  46:23
well, what is the legacy sales or is that only for district x?

Unknown Speaker  46:32
Let's find out how that's used.

Speaker 1  46:37
I guess we need to match the logic that Josh using Monday morning. The same criteria that he's using Monday.

Matthias Miller  46:47
Let's go take a look at it. Let's see if we can find what he's doing. SDI SDI accounts receivable looks right.

Unknown Speaker  46:55
Is this one is it Monday morning at seven five okay, he just recently changed it to seven 920

Matthias Miller  47:08
this is the this is the email.

Speaker 1  47:10
I yeah, I think that's an email a file going out in a Friday. No, this is on a Monday it

Matthias Miller  47:16
is scheduled for Monday is

Speaker 1  47:19
about halfway down the report report prior week SDI production I think that's it

Matthias Miller  47:25
so here we do Mark building delivered user data SDI production and takes the last week SDI production okay let's go to

Unknown Speaker  47:40
last week SDI production

Matthias Miller  47:47
see what he does okay so if if it's built in the range and check the district filter and it looks at the building is district X sound cancelled in that building as district district x so

Unknown Speaker  48:14
you see do we where was I? Right here

Matthias Miller  48:30
do we need to check for canceled buildings? Would we ever have non canceled sales orders for canceled buildings

Unknown Speaker  48:41
I don't know non canceled sales orders for canceled buildings right

Matthias Miller  48:52
because we could do this not sure

Speaker 1  48:57
is there any things that happened with JetDirect buildings I know

Matthias Miller  49:03
as attached to nine canceled building building

Unknown Speaker  49:19
and

Unknown Speaker  49:36
All right, so if

Unknown Speaker  49:48
Well, first of all

Matthias Miller  49:53
wait and it's where it's not district X sign me up. attached to SDI building

Unknown Speaker  50:33
let's do this

Speaker 3  50:44
okay why is this not

Unknown Speaker  50:50
not building this

Unknown Speaker  50:52
building okay so

Matthias Miller  51:03
wait to invoice SDI buildings and all buildings with with transit tasks until they are delivered district X buildings transit tasks this would actually be a simple way to do it so if

Unknown Speaker  51:43
let's do this if it's

Matthias Miller  51:47
it's not canceled and it's district X

Unknown Speaker  52:05
building

Unknown Speaker  52:22
okay

Matthias Miller  52:23
so district X buildings do not get district X buildings might not have with transit tasks

Matthias Miller  52:47
wait districts buildings without transit tasks get invoiced the day after build all other buildings get invoiced on delivery

Unknown Speaker  53:04
let's move this down here

Matthias Miller  53:19
okay so if we have a building that was not if it's and then here

Matthias Miller  53:31
the building was not canceled and it's district x and it does not have transit tasks then we do it on the build date all other buildings unless they're canceled

Unknown Speaker  53:44
well yeah

Matthias Miller  53:50
I think we can just do this you're not gonna have a delivery date and a building that was canceled you shouldn't you better not

Unknown Speaker  54:00
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  54:01
and you'll catch it on the verification if you do. Or you should Alright, so building that was canceled and it's district decks and it doesn't have any transit tasks go ahead and do it built for all other buildings or do it

Unknown Speaker  54:26
well at home

Unknown Speaker  54:41
yeah, if I can

Unknown Speaker  54:50
so,

Matthias Miller  54:51
I mean, I think this this looks right to me which in this for this particular a sales order that we're looking at would not. Here, let's do this. Now, let's throw this into this report. And these these three buildings in this case would not have gotten invoiced or would not have shown up on the report. Correct? Only this one.

Unknown Speaker  55:22
Yeah. Yeah. You're on a CD.

Unknown Speaker  55:33
Those that also with the next update, that should be live.

Unknown Speaker  55:35
Why? We?

Matthias Miller  55:42
Yeah, let me go ahead. And I'm going to I'm going to lose if I have like, 30 seconds to get this in here, so don't lose track and then the answer will be yes.

Unknown Speaker  55:56
Yeah, so do live in the next update. Okay. Perfect. Good.

Speaker 1  56:03
The only other thing that I could think of, who should we ask? We were trying to talk this morning about how we're going to hunt down. The actual costs incurred? Should we ask Matthias about? Like, would he haven't suggestions on that? Or do you want to poke around on that

Unknown Speaker  56:19
cost incurred for?

Unknown Speaker  56:22
Oh, you're talking about the FGS? Yeah. Um, yeah,

Speaker 1  56:28
I think so. But that's what we were trying to figure out how can we explain so how the calculations work on the FTI actual costing to build or so we entered an actual costs for production overhead of 11,003 and $62 in some sense, ah for the month of July. The way that we came up with that cost I believe, was we looked at we looked at the accounts payable verification report the IMS side and do are used for what was received in that time period. Yeah. And then you would you imported that into the accounting system, put it on the transaction Import File, import it into the accounting system. So now ideally, what we want is a way to go and just more or less show an expense report you know, showing here is here all the vendors we bought from to cut to end up with this 11,003 or 6208 that we enter into Yeah, because it's it Okay, these were posted to an account on the balance sheet they're not showing on the income statement

Unknown Speaker  57:55
Yeah, they could be

Unknown Speaker  57:57
like that part one would be the part that has

Unknown Speaker  58:00
to but

Speaker 1  58:05
yeah, we're looking at actual costs incurred like that that you would have done on your import. Yeah, so it seems to me like looking at a general ledger for a certain time Yeah. Would and showing the the the account probably showing I don't know Can we can we filter by only showing child accounts of production? Overhead

Unknown Speaker  58:47
waiting

Matthias Miller  58:49
there's not a great protection or these are right nevermind. I mean, yeah, you could.

Unknown Speaker  59:01
This is

Matthias Miller  59:04
not the production overheads. So we would do okay, this is not the most elegant way to do this. But

Unknown Speaker  59:17
it isn't us right.

Matthias Miller  59:28
Before that one of the seven you know we there is there are understatement of the year. Not the most ideal is one of them.

Speaker 3  59:53
Yo yo yo Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
Yeah, automatic transaction you'd be looking at? Well, I mean, what's the best way to do this? Is it better to do to pull that out of accounting? Or do you want to pull it out of? AP?

Speaker 1  1:00:40
Well, we could also, I mean, we could take a look simply at the report file that

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
unit or the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:48
verification report?

Speaker 1  1:00:49
Well, we could look at that, or I mean, you already did that on your import? Maybe we could you probably do you still have the input file? Or you did those friends? Yeah. I mean, if we, I think it was, wouldn't it be just simply using? Like, we could basically delete every other line, because we don't need to show the debits and credits. We just want to show it that shows that we have children, right.

Speaker 2  1:01:10
Well, I think that was not was not organized by type of account, by account, like it's just organized by date. But the account is the account is less the week it sort by the account column. I think that might be the cleanest way to do that.

Matthias Miller  1:01:27
Okay, well, you could have another idea just to run this by you. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
I don't think this is.

Matthias Miller  1:01:47
I don't know which we want to go

Speaker 2  1:01:49
mid second minus the first. I mean, the first column minus the second column are the difference.

Matthias Miller  1:02:01
two decimals align rate. use commas please.

Matthias Miller  1:02:13
Still, we just need to

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
is that a line? 363 28?

Matthias Miller  1:02:20
Down? Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:02:24
Wow, further now? Yeah, the alignment 362 28 on production already finished goods? I think. Is that the amount we had?

Speaker 2  1:02:31
Thanks. I mean, I was I was exporting that exact thing, and then just putting it in a spreadsheet and doing that subtraction. But is that does that include everything that would have been spent in those categories? Or is that only going to be right, but got applied to certain buildings, you know, whether or not sold or?

Matthias Miller  1:03:02
Alright, let me let me let me okay, what we want.

Speaker 1  1:03:08
What we want is basically, like an expense report off the income statement, if we want to say what did sales What were our sales expenses for a month, we want to show that same thing for production overhead and for raw materials. But I would almost let let us take a look at using the imports that drew create it, because I mean, that's where the information came off. So I think just finagling those and adjusting those will give us what we need. I would say, well, let's do that. If we need something more. Well, we'll reach out to you that

Matthias Miller  1:03:53
yeah, we've definitely got lots of options as far as what we can do with reports. Once you know moving forward, we might not have anything stock, but we can absolutely put something together.

Speaker 1  1:04:03
Yeah. Good

Speaker 2  1:04:07
on the cash flow categories, and you sent email with the legs. So the the the ones that didn't have anything assigned, I'm assuming is what you want to filled in. So there's, we have a bunch of accounts under current assets. And they there's some of them, like all our bank accounts are listed under the subtype of current accounts. Like all those bank accounts at the top are all under current sub type of current assets. So those would be cash is where those should be. And then like, is there a way to separate those out? Or do we have to change the subtype on all of those?

Matthias Miller  1:05:06
So you could see what I would do. Is there something that the majority of these would be?

Speaker 2  1:05:14
Yeah, operating expense, I think is what the majority would be. They'd be an operating thing anyway. Oh, fine.

Matthias Miller  1:05:25
If I go ahead and save this? Yeah. Yeah. So then we could, so we could do that. Okay. It's, and then we'd go back in here and overwrite these old turn into got it?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:45
Yeah. Is that

Speaker 2  1:05:46
right? Yeah. Okay. That cetera that works. Yeah. Makes sense. I was thinking I'm gonna have to go make a big huge adjustment to me.

Speaker 1  1:06:01
It's amazing how easy things become when you talk to people. That right.

Speaker 2  1:06:10
One item on payroll that we talked about, just for your it would be nice list. I'm not that needs done right now, as we should have a space to put items on that do not get figured in with the gross pay. So like, you know, the hourly, the bonuses, all that stuff goes into gross pay to come up with that gross pay number. But the the transaction, I mean, that's transaction, the transport bonus is one that from our understanding, technically, that should be a net pay item that comes out of net.

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
So would you want to so two ways we go about it on the payroll, or one way to go about it is on the payroll item itself be able to configure whether it's a gross item, or an item was paid on paid on gross or paid on that? We then give you some visibility into that. I don't know though, because they really behave pretty differently as far as how you want them to show up on the I was wondering if we don't want a separate separate box, separate box? What would you call them? If they were as a separate box?

Speaker 2  1:07:40
Um, it was a separate boxes, I probably just call them like

Speaker 2  1:07:58
deductions. I mean, for the most part, if you're actually paying them something in this, it would be as if you, you know, they bought something and you're reimbursing them which you really should just pay them as a vendor in that case. I would call and probably deductions from that, like payroll deductions or something like that, or deductions for payroll.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28
Just like,

Speaker 2  1:08:33
Yeah, I think separately would be good, because it's going to be items where there's something like this, you're charging him for something. And if he could just write you out a check for it, then it would be it should be an after shouldn't be a net pay item. So they're gonna currently just keep running it the way it is, it's not like we need it done right now. But there's just kind of a compliance thing that we'd like to get to eventually. And then the the heck, like, we can set it in QuickBooks to to run like it's supposed to. But it's just if it shows up as subtracted from the gross pay on the one pay stub and they get another paid stuff and it's different gross pay and starts making lots of questions.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21
So

Matthias Miller  1:09:25
and it'll when we round trip it back in. It's all gonna work okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
I'm gonna run into issues

Speaker 2  1:09:44
while we're getting the amount of tax from there I think it should work because we're saying we're saying take $36 out of the check

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
and

Speaker 2  1:10:01
We'll come back taking those $36 out if they won't all come out in the same spot. Like, it will eventually come out of his gross pay, but it will the taxes will be calculated calculated first and subtracted and then this will be subtracted. I think it should work

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
doesn't

Matthias Miller  1:10:37
work. Okay, I'm struggling to wrap my head around it, it seems

Unknown Speaker  1:10:55
like,

Speaker 2  1:10:56
I mean, it would be it would be best to have a classified here as a as a deduction from net pay. Right? You know, just so we're not running into that kind of thing.

Matthias Miller  1:11:10
But I am. You might be right. I cannot wrap my head around. So I mean, that they're gross and our gross, sorry. We're gonna think that our gross is higher than QuickBooks does. Which means when QuickBooks reports taxes, these things aren't going to balance out. And we're going to have to account for this somehow.

Speaker 2  1:11:42
You know, yeah, I'm this, this system is going to subtract the way it is currently, this system subtracts that transport amount from the gross pay, and then says, Okay, your gross pay is $36 less than it was calculated by the hours and bonuses and stuff. And now here's what we calculate taxes by QuickBooks would when I mean we can set it either way, and we'll just set it the right way, the same way. But it's just not the correct way. But if we went Bridgeworks will then say, your gross pay was $36. Higher is simply the total of hours, bonuses and whatever you have assigned to you. And then you calculate your taxes off of that amount. And then you subtract your net pay. I mean, you subtract your, your transport cost.

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
So you're thinking in the short term, you'll still you'll still

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
pay this. I will do it just like they haven't. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
yeah. Okay. Got it. So as long as the two systems match, I'm completely happy. Okay, got it.

Speaker 2  1:13:01
Okay. Good. I think that should be it. Oh, and the, I'll be sending you a list once I get it together and what we need. My understanding is they are not calculating workman's comp, or or tracking workman's comp through this. So, so we won't need that. And I don't know yet what what order the categories or the columns are gonna need to be in, but I'll give you the information for the columns and the littlest matter rearranging them if we're wrong. So Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:13:45
Sounds good. Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
All right. Thank you.
