Speaker 1  00:16
Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing? Pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  00:23
Trying to stay warm, right?

Speaker 1  00:26
We're cold weather. Yeah, it was 25 out here

Unknown Speaker  00:31
a couple hours ago it's up into the 30s now but oh boy still still pretty chilly would be silly not not used to this weather after Phoenix for four years

Unknown Speaker  00:50
Yeah,

Speaker 2  00:52
that's fine when I moved to first moved to Colorado where we go jogging and zero degree weather and a short sleeve shirt and I'm like, This is awesome. Because it's like low humidity. We're

Unknown Speaker  01:02
like now I've acclimated to

Speaker 2  01:07
the cold and the cold actually feels cold. Or maybe perhaps too warm. Yeah, if only there were a way to somehow anchor your body in a different temperature so it doesn't adapt anyway

Unknown Speaker  01:30
to anywhere with us

Unknown Speaker  01:38
trying to figure out your location there. You're in an airport or something.

Unknown Speaker  01:44
I met the road boards, etc. Hey, go local coffee shop this morning. That's it

Unknown Speaker  02:02
all right. Turn on screen sherry. yeah

Speaker 1  02:15
by the way, side note, as well, he is rolling. Have you met a Daniel horse up there recently? I

Unknown Speaker  02:27
haven't met him. I saw him and I'm like, he's not sure horse brothers. He was like that. It's like, I've never been so. Like,

Unknown Speaker  02:41
I was like, it looks like it's better. Not to make a second Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  02:48
It's interesting.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
Either cousin.

Unknown Speaker  02:54
I forgot you. Yeah, you'd said the job was your cousin as well. Obviously.

Unknown Speaker  02:59
About that.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
What's your What's your connection with Joel?

Unknown Speaker  03:05
But I don't know. I

Speaker 2  03:07
think it's just shared. You know, somewhat similar personalities and interests and Facebook friends more than anything else.

Unknown Speaker  03:15
Gotcha. Yeah.

Speaker 2  03:18
I don't think we've ever we've you know, we've messaged back and forth about a few things here and there.

Unknown Speaker  03:24
So yeah, gotcha

Unknown Speaker  03:32
I say personality because it gonna be really moving some shared interests

Unknown Speaker  03:46
Yeah. That fun fact. Rolling. I was at I was at a men's retreat Spanish church here and then another

Speaker 1  04:01
New York this past weekend. And they were you guys from Honduras? And the conversation one guy from here and one guy connected church up there. But turns out that guy from up there knew the guy's wife, the wife of the guy from here and anyway, just kind of funny. Oh, yeah, you're married her? Oh, yeah. She is. You from the same country in different parts. But anyway, now living 1000s of miles away and meeting up and realizing a connection. Funny how that works. It's one

Speaker 2  04:48
might be getting pretty close to your wedding band. I forget the exact dates. But speaking of connections and random people, are you going to be going to Richard Miller's

Unknown Speaker  04:58
storytelling The Event

Speaker 2  05:02
controllers are telling. It's him and like three other guys Dayspring sostiene

Unknown Speaker  05:10
Oh, that's a fake Chris. Oh, yeah. Got about that I I'm not sure yet.

Unknown Speaker  05:21
I forget what exactly date that is but

Speaker 1  05:27
okay. So we'll have to have to see if

Unknown Speaker  05:34
wedding planning and stuff is going. Speaking of

Unknown Speaker  05:41
Oh, that. So you remember Jeff show Walter and Bridget Brennaman from out there.

Speaker 2  05:46
Oh yeah, absolutely. So I am marrying Bridget sister Ciara. Oh

Unknown Speaker  05:59
that's funny.

Speaker 2  06:00
Yeah. Bridget was yesterday or the time that the vs larious

Unknown Speaker  06:11
found out that they knew you over Christmas time. I kept forgetting to mention that. But

Unknown Speaker  06:17
yeah

Unknown Speaker  06:26
all right. Any others?

Unknown Speaker  06:30
random connections waiting to be made.

Speaker 1  06:34
The Richard what's the what's the name of his last name that was used last Miller? Miller. Yeah. He's like he. Yeah, he's connected with Spencer. Brother in law. He that's way back.

Unknown Speaker  06:55
That's just that's his friends, right?

Speaker 1  06:59
Yeah, yeah. Are their friends through internet connections way back? Sure. But are you? Are you?

Unknown Speaker  07:08
Are you guys old enough to remember? Is that a discuss?

Unknown Speaker  07:12
I've heard about it. I've not experienced it, but I've heard about it.

Speaker 2  07:19
Yeah, so I guess Hans, this mass would be your area as well. Yep. So one of my friends and I did a parody. This is when we were young and dumb and didn't have anything better to do created a parody called meta disgust that calm

Speaker 2  07:42
is like, you know, before battle and be like, you know, trying to spin off the onion kind of, you know, rebrand this for this type of

Unknown Speaker  07:54
more like, as a jig

Unknown Speaker  07:56
on consumer. Anyway.

Unknown Speaker  08:00
Anyway, so recently

Speaker 2  08:13
there have been stories that we can get into CSS golf

Unknown Speaker  08:22
very hard. All right. Digital signatures on new member card. Yep. 23. I saw your email your conversation with Josh. Your comment there. Just wanted to review it quickly. So you say this is for digital signatures only doesn't work as wet signatures when

Speaker 1  08:53
needed. As in is that saying that there's not a way to convert from what signature this?

Unknown Speaker  09:01
Right. Like a DD to one signature, we need to give them a template they can fill out and sign.

Speaker 1  09:07
Okay, right. So yeah, so then they would probably want a separate way to be able to be able to print the unsigned copy. So

Speaker 2  09:18
what would what would be ideal, and I don't know if we can do this. I don't know what it takes but it probably would be ideal then. The 20 that generates the PDF contract to have a system switch to say whether it's generating a wetter generated for wetter digital signature because there's template keywords or there's, there's keywords that you embed, that gets pushed over to Panda dog that informs how and where to sign

Speaker 1  10:02
And then it would be $32 a pop this is a per signed contract not for signature

Unknown Speaker  10:10
understanding my understanding it's per document all right

Unknown Speaker  10:25
dollars per deck

Unknown Speaker  10:30
and I don't think they need there's no monthly fee

Unknown Speaker  10:34
okay so step 1000

Unknown Speaker  10:43
plus the 20%

Speaker 1  10:50
and coding is done by CCI.

Unknown Speaker  11:05
are 20 to tender SPF record

Speaker 2  11:10
so the contact custom fields on the contract record that links back to the Add add add something somewhere some bullet points for CCI add a custom field to the contract record to link it back to

Unknown Speaker  11:27
the member

Unknown Speaker  11:35
going back to the Member. Member

Speaker 2  11:42
or isn't this isn't this linked to a sanctioned member? Or is it linked to a vehicle?

Speaker 1  11:50
Oh, it would be like Yeah, it's like this is like from the contract factory track record. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  12:13
Actually a generous contract on track records. So we would need to add Oh, we have a contract record. That's part of Josh's, Josh's, not much.

Speaker 2  12:28
Yeah, so imagine, I mean, so here's how it works. You have you have all your customer stuff, and then generates this con contract record. And the contract record says go run this report to generate the PDF and go past that this these Astra answers. So when that record gets created, it reaches out to Josh's whiskey and says Dear whiskey, go generate a panda doc and it goes sends it out to Panda doc and then it basically says hey, can you tell me when this thing gets signed? And when it gets signed then it updates the or when it gets sent with this essential box back in you know posting on the contact record contract record and it gets signed it updates the same checkbox as well and any kind of verifications that we want to do we can just do based off of the contract record such as new contract has been signed

Speaker 1  13:25
or you know going blank right and we doesn't have a multiple signatures for

Unknown Speaker  13:33
per contract

Unknown Speaker  13:40
cool all right

Unknown Speaker  14:01
okay when the question is that's gonna cost four

Unknown Speaker  14:14
CCIE is one of it

Speaker 2  14:23
do we need to didn't even check weeks? Let me see what fields he's got on the

Unknown Speaker  14:32
Do you know, the blueprint designer in general together.

Speaker 2  14:44
Wouldn't it be cool to have a sync from the catalog into the blueprint designer so that you could go searching for fields and different catalogs?

Speaker 1  14:58
Right from the blueprint designer Did you just say for example

Unknown Speaker  15:04
on the contract I'm gonna go see what fields are in the contract record

Unknown Speaker  15:07
hmm

Speaker 1  15:16
And then we have a list of you could almost run into them you probably wouldn't run into much issues with like permissions and people on people seeing stuff

Unknown Speaker  15:39
that much there's no data it's the data model is or that much that's proprietary

Unknown Speaker  15:45
probably not

Unknown Speaker  15:49
the Tronic contract

Unknown Speaker  15:51
thanks so yields

Unknown Speaker  16:11
yeah has a link

Unknown Speaker  16:16
to view within the

Unknown Speaker  16:24
that's currently how you would access it

Speaker 1  16:29
from the contract record Yeah. That's how they would have to access it like a PDF to download

Unknown Speaker  17:08
okay

Unknown Speaker  17:19
okay, well that's cool there

Speaker 1  17:36
all right. Anything else from you and Matthias on this one?

Speaker 2  17:43
Oh, yes. Actually one last thing. If you can persuade me of this and be if you can persuade me to take the time to do this and see you can find a compelling use case within cch

Unknown Speaker  17:59
you can play around with it. You're wet. If if

Speaker 2  18:06
if you can find a compelling, compelling zip to use DCH then you get to play around with it and cch as well. Ah, gotcha. All right. So

Unknown Speaker  18:28
we got to think about that all right

Unknown Speaker  18:41
next one here worth getting into now

Speaker 1  18:54
we can wait on that. Actually, maybe we should actually just tell us a little bit more on the signature thing. So this this what we're what you're proposing here this option is the this is a full package. Again them full functionality of digital signatures linked with App hosting. Do we want to give them those some other options like you know, a third party software where they can upload the PDF and then take Adobe or others do this to upload the PDF and then do the digital signature map or manually on the PDF?

Unknown Speaker  19:43
I mean, they could do that. I don't know the digital signature pads are well, I don't know they still require integration with something somewhere. I think most others you're going to be looking at recovering subscription B's

Speaker 2  20:12
digital signatures made for us

Unknown Speaker  20:17
not sure though

Unknown Speaker  20:32
Well,

Unknown Speaker  20:33
I mean I know somebody who could research digital signature platforms for them if they wanted to

Unknown Speaker  20:41
30 buffer options

Unknown Speaker  20:52
yeah

Unknown Speaker  20:55
yeah can't remember I think there might have been some that do

Unknown Speaker  21:14
attacking evidence I guess kinetochore Beach Street if you don't do

Speaker 2  21:31
its thing want to manually create ended up being breed works as long as they're willing to place the signatures and presumably you want them Do you have it all under one shared account

Unknown Speaker  21:48
do you

Unknown Speaker  21:50
do on sub accounts probably have to have a paid subscription

Unknown Speaker  22:04
what is

Unknown Speaker  22:09
almost everything else is in some form of resigning these five documents in the

Unknown Speaker  22:22
form yeah

Unknown Speaker  22:37
everything else

Speaker 2  22:38
is on some form of or 90% of what you're going to find is going to be some kind of subscription model and I don't know how shared document access is going to work and other things like that. Are you concerned about that

Unknown Speaker  22:57
well then would you be able to do some quick research on a few different options two to four options that just give you an idea of what's out there as far as

Unknown Speaker  23:08
third party three years is subscriptions process Yeah, maybe we can have two different angles to go bring to them Okay

Unknown Speaker  23:30
two places to start looking at you went

Unknown Speaker  23:37
okay

Unknown Speaker  23:40
besides for students searches

Speaker 1  23:47
Okay, very good. And then this one save that for another time thanks think what direction they want to go with digital signatures next, let's hits items EVs and this one

Unknown Speaker  24:16
is it's fine.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
It's 741.

Unknown Speaker  24:38
Questions for you Matthias. Cleaning up here on the export Telly record. We have the photos here. You And we're going to have buttons to remove rows and to delete or I guess button remove remove rows is just in there by default LS has some suggestions here

Speaker 2  25:22
the main reason to use our plan with s3 storage s3 storage is so ridiculously cheap so unless they're

Unknown Speaker  25:32
uploading a 10 gigabyte videos

Speaker 2  25:40
they're not going to notice it in pricing it's pennies on the dollar and so our plan has been just to allow just to keep it in s3, delete the role and if at some point they're concerned about all kinds of deleted photos, we can basically put together a report or something that products it's actually linked in the database and go delete everything else from s3 but no it's just barely worth

Unknown Speaker  26:20
it's barely worth it really.

Speaker 1  27:05
So your idea would need to request to not even have the Delete link the photos or G

Speaker 2  27:16
get the photos or G was to either delete one you just delete it

Unknown Speaker  27:19
from the RG

Speaker 2  27:23
Okay, so anybody who has the link for whatever reason

Speaker 1  27:33
right so in the event the day well so it would client and their customers could in theory have links and then they delete the TV deletes the rows and then customer goes back six months later because they open up the email

Unknown Speaker  28:03
insert something

Unknown Speaker  28:35
I don't know exactly how this works

Speaker 2  28:44
if it isn't an issue we probably have a way in the moment we do this

Unknown Speaker  28:57
this

Unknown Speaker  29:00
story attachments to read attachment you know he does have a way to delete the attachment

Unknown Speaker  29:33
oh,

Unknown Speaker  29:34
maybe he's just saying except the Delete link is literally a link. I'm not sure what else is proposing

Unknown Speaker  29:52
check one more thing analysis

Unknown Speaker  30:00
The Hungary representative on

Unknown Speaker  30:06
the attachments

Unknown Speaker  30:42
long

Unknown Speaker  31:00
the short answer is we need to find out from Josh how this works

Unknown Speaker  31:16
that's the short answer

Unknown Speaker  31:19
okay

Unknown Speaker  31:26
all right

Unknown Speaker  31:32
okay the delete

Unknown Speaker  31:33
button will delete it from the RG so

Unknown Speaker  31:49
the okay so

Unknown Speaker  31:54
it will automatically be removed so a bunch of remove rows

Unknown Speaker  32:00
is not necessary you use the Remove blank

Speaker 1  32:06
okay so I need to get rid of this for you you use the

Speaker 2  32:13
button to remove rows and customers whoever has the link can still access it well we're actually maybe not even that maybe that's not actually an issue because these view links the links that we sent to the customers probably won't actually be the traveling the attachment will probably be linked to the Triple D or to the DBS and that could Shepherd deleted rows

Unknown Speaker  32:45
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  32:50
it's probably clean as to keep the Delete

Unknown Speaker  32:57
okay delete them

Speaker 2  33:24
the purpose the first comment that if we instead of the plan is that if we keep if we use the minus button it will keep the auto industry

Unknown Speaker  34:00
then using the Delete link will literally repeat it from s3 as well

Unknown Speaker  34:06
from s3 and it will remove it from the record

Unknown Speaker  34:27
all right

Speaker 1  34:37
so then as far as here he talks about the Delete link edit mode. So when you click the Delete link, it will automatically edit mode for the detail screen.

Speaker 2  34:51
You should just make make a note of that of the spec. Okay, like that. Exit setup mode and opens up wishing

Speaker 1  35:33
and thoughts on his comment here about it namely Delete Row Row Delete link there's only one row at least

Unknown Speaker  35:47
That sounds reasonable

Unknown Speaker  35:50
okay

Unknown Speaker  36:13
why only if you want to grow on to everything about that

Speaker 2  36:18
because because we only require that they have one or more photos and

Unknown Speaker  36:24
if they exploded

Speaker 2  36:26
and we took a photo that they want to exclude surely they're not breaking validation to remove it

Unknown Speaker  37:10
well if the

Unknown Speaker  37:17
loaded checkbox

Speaker 1  37:54
okay good and then I have a question here is an answer to whether clicking the link automatically does

Speaker 1  38:31
is there any validation on on file type for this work with a dragon a whatever file they want a Word document or Excel sheet or a PDF you don't know that we validated

Unknown Speaker  38:48
that need to explore adding functionality for

Unknown Speaker  38:54
that I don't think it needs a lot of this will be done yesterday in the week Okay next question and the bookings report we have two pane report left pane is bookings and right pane is corresponding export tallies for the selected booking.

Speaker 1  39:32
That's the Ask prompts here and most of them are for the left pane for the bookings. But here we've got ally loaded start date

Unknown Speaker  39:47
that I was planning to have just before writing but Ellis was wondering if first question here if the left pane was so

Speaker 1  39:59
easy don't match how to handle that. I think it would be better to just have to have it affect the left pane. But that's I mean, it's not the original spec here. Does that cause problems since we're looking at our field on the yard I'm sorry, the export tally instead of the booking record.

Unknown Speaker  40:24
So we're looking at old booking records that have metalli that was dated within that range

Unknown Speaker  40:34
it's doable either through

Unknown Speaker  40:40
minimums for bottles or

Unknown Speaker  40:50
basically making that that left pane run on both bookings and export tallies.

Unknown Speaker  41:05
So you would you would pull to both left and right pane or just the left pane and you would see all

Speaker 1  41:13
tallies I think at that point, we would just do the left pane we just have the left pane show all bookings that have a tally loaded D that range and then the right pane the right painkillers reporting anything

Unknown Speaker  41:38
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  41:42
I mean, under the hood, well, okay. Yeah. I don't know that it's more complicated than showing the 10

Speaker 2  41:53
The question then is what do you show for number of loads? Right total number of goods

Speaker 1  42:02
currently, the plan is that we have the total number of loads on that on that booking for that booking.

Speaker 2  42:15
Yeah, I mean, either way, if you're showing the amount of work to show x of x of y, we're just excluding ones that don't have any drink ranges is it's not that much difference between one versus the other.

Unknown Speaker  42:30
And the way that

Speaker 2  42:32
the password for passing into the right pane is I mean effectively what happens is the main main report password and passes it down into the sub pane because the sub name can prompt so it provides the separate the right pane has prompts with the provided by the tenant

Speaker 1  42:50
report okay so is it a visual question for the client how he wants it to behave whether he wants to go by the right pane and only show and the right paint wants to be in that range? Or whether he wants to go at the left pane show bookings and therefore all tallies for the booking that have totally in that range

Unknown Speaker  43:26
I think we can make a reasonable proposal I think I think a reasonable proposal is

Unknown Speaker  43:45
so the filter buttons I think it's confusing this show

Speaker 2  44:00
think the number of columns are confusing with this approach. But it's the client itself and that's what matters

Speaker 1  44:10
now this my my thought here is that this would actually be

Unknown Speaker  44:23
when they hear I'm thinking this would actually show all

Unknown Speaker  44:32
sorry, you're saying the right thing would show?

Unknown Speaker  44:46
Okay, if

Speaker 2  44:49
it's just a filter that shows which bookings have tallied within these dates, for the right pane shows all dates from tallies. It seems to me is in those numbers numbers seem less confusing to me so it probably is a question for the client I think it's semi reasonable to make a recommendation or present present options

Unknown Speaker  45:34
okay and I missed there what you were saying your your preference would make more sense to you

Speaker 2  45:52
I think either we should I think the columns on the left pane and the contents of the right pane should be congruent so if you think of the right pane we should indicate that somehow on the left pane but if we don't then it's fine to have a pane as it is. It's my opinion

Unknown Speaker  46:38
okay

Unknown Speaker  46:57
all right, one more item for discussion here. And this actually isn't specifically related to TVs, but it's more of a CSS all topic

Unknown Speaker  47:14
there on CSS wiki so we had mixed up our specs a little bit on the record of record alerts leasing we had

Speaker 1  47:33
included some things that the record holders don't have. So LS was playing some stuff to us the other day just wanted to make sure that we get our snippets accurate for the for these

Unknown Speaker  47:59
so

Speaker 1  48:00
I went ahead, they're just one snippet. And that's I think part of what would make confusion so I want to separate the snippets like the and just make sure we're up to date and record on them.

Unknown Speaker  48:18
So for record alerts for both of them, I write the title can be an expression that's right.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
And

Speaker 1  48:36
record alerts do not use me do not have the extra text like the database or is there a different term we use for database for

Unknown Speaker  48:48
real time notifications? Okay.

Speaker 1  49:05
And then LS Lawson's put proposing we use a word other than trigger for record alerts

Unknown Speaker  49:17
Well, it's a subset

Speaker 1  49:24
I guess the thing would be what what makes the most sense client was this with a client

Unknown Speaker  49:39
like she just said display within 15

Unknown Speaker  49:45
minutes

Unknown Speaker  49:54
and describe what what happens

Speaker 2  50:00
There will be rows for what to record student

Unknown Speaker  50:08
what causes that notification to be? displayed?

Speaker 2  50:15
Basically, the way it works is it's a, there's two ways. There's, there's the auto dismiss, where you basically, as soon as you click it, it gives you a version number. And as soon as you look at, you won't see it again until simplistically, it's a report that shows an alert when it has records in it. So every 20 minutes we run the report doesn't have records in it. And if so, then we show an alert and then some of them will disappear. When you resolve problems like dev inputs, well, when you resolve them inputs are dropping report and they'll disappear, others will disappear when you

Unknown Speaker  51:16
other times, it's

Unknown Speaker  51:17
based on basically you give a version number. And you say, here's the

Unknown Speaker  51:26
will be example. We could

Speaker 2  51:29
show you all records have been modified since we base it off of activity history, for example. And so so all incidents have been modified. And then report has a hidden column or an expression or something that says this report ran as of this version number, so 12345 then when somebody runs the report, and it says, Hey report, go rerender so and your last version number was 12345 and it says Oh, were there any edits since 123450 There were okay let me include those now. And have those types of reports of report alerts there's two kinds one where it automatically dismisses so soon as your report says okay being done I won't bother you again. And the other one is you open the report and you click the dismiss button goes away so

Unknown Speaker  52:48
we're out of this

Speaker 2  52:54
or this dismiss when alert is open as well.

Unknown Speaker  52:58
The second option okay

Unknown Speaker  53:09
got

Unknown Speaker  53:12
it sure this is right.

Unknown Speaker  53:15
Let me check my

Unknown Speaker  53:19
stuff of attacking intuition.

Unknown Speaker  54:49
They actually require you

Unknown Speaker  55:02
without prior

Unknown Speaker  55:02
dismissing

Unknown Speaker  55:14
there's the dismiss system that applications for example

Unknown Speaker  55:51
I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure

Unknown Speaker  55:58
okay, oh we have a call with him Thursday afternoon so

Unknown Speaker  56:24
So then on the

Unknown Speaker  56:25
report alerts it's good to report awards

Unknown Speaker  56:33
go back to

Unknown Speaker  56:34
the report alerts Yes.

Speaker 1  57:04
Is that as far as the user should notify is this based on you can you set specific users or

Speaker 2  57:16
user groups you subset you use the subset and the report to make report be blank for users who doesn't apply to

Unknown Speaker  57:28
trouble here that you're that

Speaker 2  57:30
you you assign a subset you put the user group you check the current user in the subset and you say the record is blank for that user

Speaker 1  57:42
okay. So, it is it is based off of user group initially Can you also if you say I want this specific user get this report or this based on this user

Speaker 2  58:00
any anything referencing the current user it could be a permission the user has it could be a setting somewhere it could be a user type

Unknown Speaker  58:13
Okay sure.

Unknown Speaker  58:37
I would do a new section for

Unknown Speaker  58:41
that spec

Unknown Speaker  58:48
and then

Unknown Speaker  58:54
this is if

Speaker 2  59:08
if dismissing before items are resolved.

Unknown Speaker  59:40
As,

Speaker 2  59:42
specify if the specific users resolve specify what should cause this alert to reappear?

Unknown Speaker  59:58
Most likely it should be Based on

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04
modified fields in activity history

Unknown Speaker  1:00:15
modified so

Speaker 2  1:00:24
let's say that you have a tally record that has some kind of alert you dismiss it and then and then if they've modified fields XY or Z on Italian record it should show up

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
again okay,

Speaker 2  1:00:44
I mean really, I think we need to think this through when you're dismissing if you're going to allow dismissing the alerts

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
and we need to specify them maybe that just means involving me let's start with this on this level those temporary real time notifications of stupid questions on us

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
now that sounds good

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
here we got a title and text that can include expressions trigger whatever what causes these alerts to play

Speaker 2  1:01:28
display when ex record is modified and matches this condition

Unknown Speaker  1:02:02
all right, and the real time answer Yes no. This information

Speaker 2  1:02:10
is real time the question is do we play sound we show a banner in urgent

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
oh who is oh right

Unknown Speaker  1:02:29
and the banner is on the menu menu

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
I think it's on any page

Speaker 1  1:02:40
Oh yeah. Across the top of the page Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
Okay wait, let's do let's do

Speaker 2  1:03:15
actually change the display when maybe it's a display when a sub page

Speaker 1  1:03:21
with record type, action update, create delete and condition

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
say Update, create create update

Unknown Speaker  1:03:47
and

Speaker 2  1:03:50
then the condition I would just say can include old and new volumes

Speaker 1  1:04:10
this this condition is specific to any, any field on that record. It's for

Unknown Speaker  1:04:18
the the actual the condition is for any field in that record? Yes.

Speaker 1  1:04:25
Okay. So we do need to read. So like if I owed values, you're saying any that's looking at activity history to see if this field ever was that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
it's the prior value can include prior and current values. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:04:51
Like I've changed from change to Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Okay

Unknown Speaker  1:05:02
we also need users to modify

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
right you also need users modify which users can trigger it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
no that's done below

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
how to do that is that the same as same as record alerts yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
and then the dismiss type with this out is that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:51
there is no dismiss type

Speaker 1  1:05:56
okay it just goes away automatically because of

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
yeah I think because of you clicking the report link or whatever it happens

Unknown Speaker  1:06:30
see an elephant said that specifically persists for other users basically each user has to write on it

Unknown Speaker  1:07:06
go to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
record safe

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32
there's your alert, you click it

Speaker 2  1:07:36
you can either dismiss it briefly click into the report

Unknown Speaker  1:07:45
and then when you click into the report now it's still there

Unknown Speaker  1:07:54
when you can it becomes red and you can dismiss it

Speaker 2  1:08:03
and let's you haven't been able to medications that

Unknown Speaker  1:08:15
are just gonna be a little bit of visual if that works

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
cool yeah. What is this little white button up here

Speaker 2  1:08:31
it's a live updating report. So if I were watching that report now you'll see my notification show up. And then this will also show up on detail screens in the bottom right any any pages of Toronto show up

Speaker 1  1:08:51
any any detail screen Quebec live? Here? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:08:56
let me go back to the year I'll send you an alert go back to the previous tab.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:04
Okay, and then Britain

Unknown Speaker  1:09:12
say that No, I did not. Instagram system

Unknown Speaker  1:09:25
oops. Let's try again. So that's what it looks like. Detachment.

Speaker 1  1:09:42
Cool. So okay, I can now we could, you know,

Speaker 2  1:09:51
and now I found you guys with create a scheduled task that sends random notification to random times.

Speaker 1  1:10:02
Random puns and GIFs and

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
you can also go to your user profile

Speaker 1  1:10:19
by I don't have my tablet my user profile oh it is in general Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
Go down to notification preferences

Unknown Speaker  1:10:31
the strapless here

Speaker 2  1:10:34
this is what you want to these are the options for the default notification is probably what you want is ideally this is what we actually have in the snippet receivers an easy way to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
save me some typing

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
then

Unknown Speaker  1:11:34
now the urgent stays

Unknown Speaker  1:11:37
days

Speaker 2  1:11:39
and the action is what report for grabs shouldn't open

Speaker 1  1:11:51
seeing this action down here what happens to what report opens? What report or graphs you open?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:30
Think that's it for that one. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
We don't actually use it in real time. Okay. Which is more common?

Speaker 1  1:13:01
All right. Well, that is super helpful.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:14
We're good. On this live report Live Updating report. Is that a new feature? No, we've had we've had for a while. Is it available in any report? Or is it only for reports?

Speaker 2  1:13:35
It's I think the restrictions are mops editable reports only which don't have to have any editable columns. Can you think of any use cases we went?

Speaker 1  1:13:48
Well, there would be some there been some recently, I think in design scheme, where there was some report

Unknown Speaker  1:13:54
that they that we told them they're going to have to refresh.

Speaker 1  1:14:01
Maybe like the yard, the yard tallies report or the vendor even to report or something like that, where we're going to be pulling in information that is getting added out in the yard. And if they have it up on their screen, they're going to have to refresh it to to see you know to see new things that have come in maybe it wasn't quite like that. But I feel like something like that where you know a guy sitting there in his office he could wait for the notification to come in or he could just see it happened to see it pop up

Unknown Speaker  1:14:47
I also think it's it can't be defined and user components either.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:54
Don't remember if we ever I think what we should do

Unknown Speaker  1:15:04
And there are limitations to what we can do for live updating.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
Think we should

Speaker 2  1:15:59
also this is the kind of thing that it isn't it is likely more expensive and comes with some restrictions predominantly because of the restrictions. And

Unknown Speaker  1:16:21
yeah.

Speaker 2  1:16:24
Sort Order for example, I don't know what the groupings I think there's various limitation to that. Sure. without actually going through the source code. I don't know that I've gotten some good feedback on what works and what doesn't work. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:52
Okay, cool. I'll put it in there and comes up with a good use case for it. Great stuff. All right. Thanks a lot for all of that. And we did not get to the CWA job

Speaker 1  1:17:24
this one had some questions in the email. I don't think we've gotten answered yet. So we could go did you said Oh, you'd have to do a call and your eyes are glazing over.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
I have another go.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:47
No, I we can just squeak in all the time. into our time here.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:52
All right. Sounds good. Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:01
And we will do next time. Later. Right. Thanks.
