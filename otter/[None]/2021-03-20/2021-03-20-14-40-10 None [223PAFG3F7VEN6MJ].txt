So one of the major shifts that is happening right now is the understanding that God is my Father, but he's also my military commander so when he sends me into battle. He is going to absolutely protect me and he's going to make sure that we've got my back but there's certain things around this whole idea of identity, actually, to preserve. And in reality, the identity in Boston, in the context of the individual identity. In the context of engineering and so I think this is actually a huge piece to this there's this, there's this trifecta of will mind and heart, that we're all of us must be striving so will that is a will that overpowers the heart or heart that parents will remind that overpowers any of them they must all be in subjection to each other and being independent to each other actually allows them to grow, keep hearing it and going straight into the battle.
