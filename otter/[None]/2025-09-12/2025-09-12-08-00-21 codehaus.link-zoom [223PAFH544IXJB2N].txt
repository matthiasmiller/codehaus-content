Unknown Speaker  10:45
Hey, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  10:49
Good Morning, Sir,

Matthias Miller  10:51
good morning. Happy Friday.

Speaker 1  10:54
That work. Man, what will Amanda? What will her username be?

Matthias Miller  10:59
Amanda, just her first name, first name, yep,

Speaker 1  11:03
okay, you got it and Friday 12, she's jumping on for the first time. There you go. You can set your own password. Oh, okay. All right. Um, yes, sir. All right, man.

Speaker 1  11:31
Matt, can I start with asking about John's current status? From your perspective?

Unknown Speaker  11:38
Yes, I and

Unknown Speaker  11:43
he things are the ones that are flagged right

Speaker 2  11:55
Friday 12, saying New Users must first be created by administrators in that state.

Speaker 3  12:01
I mean, means your username, which double check your username,

Unknown Speaker  12:05
double check username.

Matthias Miller  12:16
That doesn't make sense. It should work. Should work,

Unknown Speaker  12:25
yeah, because I

Speaker 1  12:28
username, I don't username and password, I should be able to see that right somewhere.

Matthias Miller  12:35
Yeah, you go into user group and go to the menu, go to Advanced, go to User Group administration,

Speaker 1  12:44
yeah, okay, wait, I want that's where I'm at.

Matthias Miller  12:50
And then you can't see your password, but you should see her user settings, and you can reset her password with me. Okay.

Speaker 1  12:58
User Settings is new. User review, all settings, user

Matthias Miller  13:09
group administration, click your name on the bottom left hand side under active accounts.

Speaker 1  13:20
Okay. Email Address, pass, user folder. Name is that her username?

Matthias Miller  13:30
No, the username name is the user ID at the very, very top.

Speaker 1  13:34
Oh yeah. It's your first name, Amanda, and then your password is, oh, it's,

Unknown Speaker  13:41
I can't see it.

Unknown Speaker  13:45
It's you, yeah, it's your first name, capital, lowercase, lowercase,

Speaker 2  13:51
one, two, right? And I did that, and then they gave me, okay, now I can put my new password in. Look at what I need,

Unknown Speaker  14:01
right? Again.

Unknown Speaker  14:08
No change.

Unknown Speaker  14:13
Yeah, see it's very so new users must first be

Speaker 1  14:16
created by administrators. New Users must first be created by administrators, Matt,

Matthias Miller  14:22
can you snap a picture of the screen?

Unknown Speaker  14:26
Yeah, here.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
Yeah, shoot. Do

Unknown Speaker  14:34
that, and I'll send Sorry. Guys.

Unknown Speaker  14:42
Coming at you. Matthias, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:17
Hey, hi, we're

Speaker 4  15:24
Um, oh, there's some brightness. There's

Unknown Speaker  15:32
a there's one, uh, first agent.

Unknown Speaker  15:37
I have no idea. Um,

Matthias Miller  15:44
does not make sense that. And if you, if you go through, you set, enter the old password, you set a new password, and hit Change Password. It gives the same thing again.

Speaker 1  15:55
Yeah, right back. Delete it all now on login settings, change password. Next login is turned on. Should I turn that off?

Matthias Miller  16:03
I mean, you can turn it off, and she can just use that password for now, and or she could enter a new password on your computer.

Speaker 1  16:12
I'll try. What password Do you want? Amanda, what's what I did? Okay, perfect.

Speaker 1  16:27
And then I'll hit Save the passwords do not match.

Unknown Speaker  16:35
Type it in both boxes, okay,

Speaker 1  16:39
confirm password, yeah, in the confirm box, okay, okay, there's confirm I'm gonna turn off that thing. It's saved, so now you should be able to, you don't have to put old and new in there anymore. I changed your old password.

Unknown Speaker  17:03
Can you go back to previous screen? No, refresh the page. Yeah, now just your password.

Speaker 5  17:22
Should we? Yeah, good, yeah. Seth, alright.

Speaker 1  17:27
So back to with John. So you have us shoot, take it, man, can you tell this individual that he's welcome to stop by. We're in a meeting, but he wants to bring an invoice on him to check he's welcome any sorry, Matt, yeah, with John, what's his status there?

Matthias Miller  17:52
Hey, um, his status is, he's emailing back and forth because he doesn't understand this stuff. So I'm, I'm, uh, there you go. I think I've gotten everything taken care of on my end that he needs. Sounds like he still has some questions. We'll see if this addresses his questions or not, right?

Speaker 5  18:17
Um, yeah. Um, welcome,

Unknown Speaker  18:22
yeah,

Speaker 1  18:27
my hat. Am I not screen? Am I screen?

Unknown Speaker  18:33
You're not screen sharing. I'm not. Should I? Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  18:40
Oh, well, just, I mean, it might, it's a no brainer. All right. Thank

Unknown Speaker  18:53
you so

Speaker 1  18:58
Ah, sorry, man, I'm my brains, couple places right now, I'm not focused very well. What was our next goal here? Okay, so

Matthias Miller  19:12
big, big picture project goals number one, let's get I mean, everything she needs to get everything cleaned up. Yeah.

Speaker 1  19:26
Potentially, yeah, so, so,

Unknown Speaker  19:31
yeah. Well, I know I'm going back and forth.

Speaker 1  19:34
Well, Zach can come over here too. So there, let me scoot around here, here. Let me do this. Right. Okay, Matt, we're going to set up on another screen with silver loom morning. Yeah, so we, I, I'm trying. I, I. I don't know, trying to explain silver loom to her so she can understand it. But I know I haven't. We haven't spent a lot of time. Um, so the the main page like assembly tracker warnings. There's still few. There now are those that time Matt and that fabric was that stuff that you're able to work on that?

Matthias Miller  20:36
Sorry, I should, I should have a better memory of this stuff. The timeout stuff was that the situation where we assembled a different quantity than the sales order called for

Speaker 1  20:50
issue. I'm not sure. I think that was, I thought that was a program issue, but I but I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  21:05
time at jobs, okay.

Matthias Miller  21:17
Okay, so they're not okay if we want to jump back on the fabrial one, that 9913,

Unknown Speaker  21:27
yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:28
okay, jump into that one. He had said that there was an order for 1000 that wasn't

Speaker 3  21:40
he said they made this doesn't make sense. He said they made 1200

Matthias Miller  21:48
200 was on a separate number, which is fine. The other 1000 is the order not showing up.

Speaker 1  22:00
Under under this, under sage order, row,

Matthias Miller  22:08
yeah, I guess so Is there are there is there an order for

Unknown Speaker  22:12
what orders are in? There

Unknown Speaker  22:14
nothing. I mean, well, yeah, there is. There's no quant.

Matthias Miller  22:21
We're not showing quantity in the list. It would be useful if you did,

Unknown Speaker  22:29
I don't know.

Speaker 1  22:34
Oh, this is bundle blocks. This is bundle blocks, 712, 594,

Speaker 4  22:40
I virtual

Unknown Speaker  22:46
needs.

Speaker 1  22:51
Wait, this was on 825. These orders are from Oh. Here we go, 822,

Matthias Miller  23:01
the 80358 was the $1,000 order, or 1000 item order,

Unknown Speaker  23:06
80358, is what that's

Matthias Miller  23:09
the 1000 item order that hadn't been showing up earlier and is now showing up. These weren't showing up because of the back order. How we're marking them back ordered, but they're here now,

Unknown Speaker  23:26
so I don't

Matthias Miller  23:28
it's still not okay. So based on basically text messages, this is where this one should be. And I wonder if the other babble is the and then there should be a 10047, work order. So save this once.

Unknown Speaker  23:50
Okay, then go back.

Matthias Miller  23:56
Let's go take a look at what one's there's the top one

Speaker 1  24:00
there. This is an issue. So this one was well, 826, so wait,

Unknown Speaker  24:10
okay, so what's

Speaker 1  24:17
Well, this should go towards the balance of that should go towards that 1000, I guess.

Speaker 5  24:27
Oh, but I don't, maybe not, maybe not. That's beyond

Matthias Miller  24:31
my

Speaker 1  24:32
Yeah, I have no idea. We don't know, because I don't know if there was entries sent in between there, right?

Matthias Miller  24:38
No, it's not, um, I can. How about this? How about I shoot John an email, copy you in and tell him that the the 1000 item sales order for these two, I'll just copy my text over

Unknown Speaker  24:55
if I can buy it again. Um.

Matthias Miller  25:06
I mean, he can, he can just search for the search for the the FA 037, and clean them up.

Speaker 1  25:21
Yeah, should I do that? Can I be down in that? Can I do that now? Yeah, let me

Matthias Miller  25:28
yeah, if you know which silver you want to tied out to,

Unknown Speaker  25:33
no, I don't. But

Matthias Miller  25:36
filter down, yeah, ah.

Speaker 1  25:41
Uh. Fa This is federal 037, yep. Then we hit continue. This will, it'll bring up all of the entries for that, for that item. FAS, there's the quantities, the dates.

Unknown Speaker  26:02
Um,

Speaker 2  26:03
there's two for that one on.

Speaker 1  26:10
So we had 400 400 fulfilled. 200 did it eight, and then it did the rest. So that's good. Then we had the 1000, which was the balance of that one we just did

Matthias Miller  26:24
the 10, 0047, should be going to that 1000, because we have a remainder of 286, right? And then the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:40
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:42
Wait the 594 we Yeah, correct. I get Yeah, right. But then the nine

Unknown Speaker  26:50
we were just Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:52
so this should go towards

Matthias Miller  26:56
the 80358, yeah, and that'll wrap up that order. Hmm.

Speaker 1  27:03
So we can open the work order. Here, we come down. Here, he did. It's the 286 we go back. I can find there's this age order. Now it's saying needed remaining balance. They did that. So that's fulfilled.

Matthias Miller  27:22
So now, if you go back, that should drop off the Yeah, now, now the only, the only open one we have, is the 600

Unknown Speaker  27:33
quantity, 80434804340

Speaker 1  27:40
yeah. Down the bottom, yeah, yeah, which is right? Well, the ones he did on, but that's interesting, because he did some yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  27:55
I don't know, but he tied that to 80507, anyway, hopefully that's correct,

Matthias Miller  28:08
80507, I mean, the the numbers are basically sequential, 80507, wait, why does the Wait a minute? Why is 80507 not

Speaker 1  28:28
that's, I wonder if that's a later 180434,

Unknown Speaker  28:34
let's see what this.

Speaker 1  28:39
Yeah, see that's a 916 order, all

Unknown Speaker  28:42
right, okay,

Unknown Speaker  28:45
it's row three order.

Unknown Speaker  28:49
Numbers are never gonna be in sequence, because that's everything.

Unknown Speaker  28:56
What do you mean by sequence? They

Unknown Speaker  28:58
won't be in any kind of sequence, right? Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 1  29:01
the numbers keep going higher as time goes by, right, but they won't be like, one, two, like for each item. No, they're the sage order. Numbers are spread out. They're entered, right, exactly. But my point is, if

Matthias Miller  29:19
that one, why is that one not showing?

Speaker 1  29:28
I just don't. Well, you know, my question here, I don't understand why. See, here we have one in order. Order. Day was 92499, it was never fulfilled. But this was a nine nine order. And there's an order for next week that he's allotting

Speaker 6  29:52
these two. This isn't done yet.

Speaker 1  29:55
Well, no, he did three, six, I'm saying the ones that were built yet. Yesterday, John added to next week's order. This week's order for 600 he just skipped it.

Matthias Miller  30:11
There's a problem in this report, and I see what it is.

Matthias Miller  30:22
Okay. Let me, let me.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
It's been really? Is that a real struggle of keeping

Matthias Miller  30:42
sage over numbers in the right order and not

Unknown Speaker  30:48
like every entry needs to be attached to the correct sage order number,

Speaker 2  30:53
right now, what if something changes that, you know, they decided to Move that order onto another order.

Speaker 1  31:01
Well, if the order, if it's still an open order, it still needs fulfilled,

Unknown Speaker  31:06
correct, if it what, if it changes the date, or

Speaker 1  31:09
if it gets canceled, well, the date change isn't going to affect the order number, but down there's a place here where we think, yeah,

Speaker 5  31:26
she's here. Go, he's here. Okay, yeah, thank you.

Speaker 1  31:29
Yeah. There's a place here where Matt can explain to you, Amanda, but Yeah, Matt hasn't set up a place where we can edit the order quantity when it changes. Okay, Rick didn't want to do it, but you want to make sure that's done, because that's going to change everything. Tina didn't want to do. Rick didn't want to do it. When they enter the sales, they don't always, they don't always, I don't know. He didn't want to bother with it. So now John, now we're tasked with John with adjusting it so orders are reconciled. So we've made, you know, so quantities that are ordered are matched, and it's clean, and so it's, it's, it helps to close out one order correctly. Adjust the quantity to

Speaker 2  32:17
meet the actual everybody has to do their part, though?

Speaker 1  32:21
Well, apparently it's falling on mostly it's on John right,

Speaker 6  32:24
because, see, we had that change yesterday with International Paper. We ended up sending their order today because they wanted it for Saturday, which eliminated their order for next Tuesday, but they still kept an order for Wednesday, but then added another order for the 19th. So how does that play out when it all. You know what I mean? If they ended up making

Speaker 1  32:43
them canceled in order, I'm assuming Tina would, right, canceled in sage,

Speaker 6  32:49
right? But it's not gonna the dates might not always look the same of when they originally it

Speaker 5  32:53
was promised. Okay, no, maybe so to go

Speaker 6  32:57
completely by date, right? Number, right? Exactly like to be able to use something like that numerically, or whatever,

Speaker 1  33:07
how most times the dates are in sequence, right? John has a good idea of that, right?

Speaker 5  33:13
That's, yeah, that's, that's tricky. That's tricky.

Speaker 2  33:22
This is a isn't it? Goodness.

Matthias Miller  33:25
So, I mean, this is, this is very much. So what happens whenever you, whenever you systemize things? So MERV, if you want to,

Speaker 6  33:36
he actually did step out one minute. Matthias, I'm sorry, that's

Matthias Miller  33:40
fine. Can you hit the back button here and we wait until he comes back to but All right, there was, there are some orders that were missing down here on the bottom of the list that shouldn't, probably should have been on here. So we can take a look when it gets back. But it's

Unknown Speaker  34:02
Hmm.

Matthias Miller  34:02
Like we have one that was due on the ninth where we didn't assemble anything for but we did assemble for one of the

Speaker 3  34:18
due on the 16th. Huh?

Speaker 6  34:38
I guess I what I wonder is when Tina makes an adjustment in sage, and it's resent, obviously, that's going to change a lot of things. It's going to change stuff on the George's end, and then obviously on John's end. So does that that's going to change? Could potentially change the order number too, right? Right?

Matthias Miller  35:01
So do those changes happen after it's assembled, where certain assembled items get moved to a different sales order? I

Speaker 6  35:10
mean, I guess that's, that's, that's more rare than but I guess it, I mean, it could happen. I mean, a lot of times they try to keep it the same, but sometimes it's putting two together too.

Matthias Miller  35:21
Putting two together, we handle it's, it's more like, if they we've already built something for a specific sales order, and then it comes back out and it moves somewhere else. That's, you know, if it's already in the system, then we, you know, it would be, uh,

Matthias Miller  35:47
I think it would be useful to show a warning for that. But most of this stuff, like the one scenario it doesn't handle is if, if you assign something to a sales order, and it gets canceled after that, but any changes that happen prior to that will update and they exhaust, yeah, just accordingly, even quantity updates on existing ones, if they've already been already built. They said they wanted 1000 and they drop it to 800 then it'll show on the bottom as having been overproduced. Okay, so,

Speaker 6  36:31
yeah, this is a new perspective for me. I worked, like, with the item IDs and entering a lot of that information to be able to utilize, like, the cut list. But this is on the opposite end. I haven't really seen a lot of so I'm kind of learning this for the first time too, what it looks like and how it works.

Matthias Miller  36:50
Yep, yeah, it's in software. We have two terminologies, are two terms that we use. One is usability and one is learnability, something that's easy to learn versus something easy to use. I think the learning curve, unfortunately, is it's easier for John because he's, this is and that's his. This is his frame of mind. This is how assembly thinks about you know, you do? You do it back to jobs on a per day basis with a team for and recording a certain amount of hours for a specific item. But hopefully, once we get past some of the learning curve, it'll get easier.

Unknown Speaker  37:36
But, yeah, understand

Speaker 6  37:40
definitely Now my question is something, and Merv wasn't quite understand what I meant like, because this is web based now, which is so much better. I mean, this is so much cleaner, and I don't there. I don't have when I look at this, I don't have as much fear as I did with, like, an Excel, layered type setup. But because it's web based, like all of us could potentially be in the program at the same time, and everything's live as it's updated, so there's nothing going to hinder there. Now, if MERV would leave this open on his computer, because he's very good at leaving many, many tabs open at one time, I know, like with Excel and stuff that can create an issue. You know, stuff is done in the meantime. Can that same thing happen with this or no? Like, if he does

Matthias Miller  38:31
so, so it doesn't matter, like it's everything is first come first served with us. And so if you sit in over here and whatever, and you make changes, and he comes back and refreshes. He sees that you can do what you need to the only, the only time it doesn't work perfectly. And there's, there's changes coming in the future that'll make this work better more often. But if you're both on the same work order or the exact same item, and you're changing the work order details for this case of a work order, or changing item details in the item, and you're both in there, putting information in, trying to update this stuff, and then the first person who saves wins, and the other person gets an error message and says, hey, somebody else changed this thing. You can't save your changes. But realistically, the the likelihood, you know, realistically, no two people in the in a business are doing exactly the same thing, as

Speaker 6  39:33
long as they're saving, what they're doing right, right? If they don't save and they walk away, like, that's where I get nervous with, right? Where? Because he'll walk away and then not save, then say the other person didn't save yet, but they've been working in it kind of the same setup. Then, you know this, I don't know. Then he goes back and thinks, oh, well, I did that, but you didn't save it. Then someone else went in and changed something. I I guess that was my fear. Like, that's what I was trying to ask him, like, I'm. To obviously there's human error, because we all make mistakes, and there's things that aren't going to be 100% perfect. That's just the way it is. But I there's frustration that comes and we had a lot of frustration with the Excel program in the fact that we felt like we did everything correctly. But if you don't delete something a certain way, or whatever it would, it would make bigger, bigger issues where that's what I want to make sure, it's a demurb. I want to make sure, because it's very frustrating if people are think they're doing something correctly, but maybe they're not, like, that's where we need to start. It might not be the information that's wrong or or what have you, but it's maybe it's the way it's being entered, or, like, I just want to make sure that we're not creating the problem. If that makes it number always calling you to fix it, you know, kind of thing,

Matthias Miller  40:48
that's fine. I think you're right. Like the number one thing is, and it is one of, maybe one of the biggest learning curves, is just save often. The reason why it doesn't auto save is because, well, sometimes you're doing stuff and you make a mistake, and you're like, that was dumb, like, I did not want to do

Unknown Speaker  41:08
that. And you get too deep at that point,

Matthias Miller  41:12
you're like, wow, what was this? And how did whatever? You know, right? So, so save often. And then even if MERV does come back and he's like, oh, yeah, I didn't say, Well, if somebody else changed it, we're going to tell him, and he'll hopefully, you know, that's a habit, then he'll learn for next time. Right, right? And yet, that probably is the biggest, the biggest thing, the other thing too, is I tried, on my end to make it as foolproof as possible without it's always kind of tricky. Like you want to, you want to stop people from doing stupid things, but you also don't want to limit them from doing their job right, right? And sometimes you got to do kind of weird things that make things because I don't know, it's just life happens. Things are weird sometimes, so, but we have full control over, oh, I don't know. Like, we'll warn you if on a work order, you over assemble for a sage work order, like,

Unknown Speaker  42:15
okay,

Matthias Miller  42:16
that's weird. Why are you doing that? And so we have full control of those types of things. If there's certain types of data entry mistakes that are happening a lot, we can, we can add either errors or warnings to keep them from, keep them from happening

Speaker 6  42:34
right, to teach, basically, to, yeah, how to not do that. And I think it's neat how it separates and pulls out things that you know, it is red flag, and you can scroll down. It's not so overwhelming. It's not scrolling through every item you know, trying to figure out what's what's wrong, you know, and glad that it separates it, that you can kind of see that right away. And it seems pretty clear. I mean, I don't understand all the information, but it seems pretty clear if you work down through there, something's missing, you know, something's not where it's supposed to be. So that seems easy,

Matthias Miller  43:03
yes, and we've and again, it's, it's pretty trivial once the once the data is in the system, it's pretty trivial to add new types of reports or new types of filters or change how things show up, or, you know, those types of things. So and especially as you get into cleanup, you you know, you might not know if something is fixable or can be sped up or made easier or but I think just keeping your your eye open, it's like this one thing, it takes really long. I don't know if it's supposed to take this long, and if it you know, but bringing those things to the table, or here's a here's a common mistake to keep making, and we whatever, right?

Speaker 6  43:48
I mean to me, the confusing thing that I see just with this little portion that that we were working through this morning, for me, and maybe it's just my perspective, like when a product, when a product is finished in an order, like the numbers, the silver loom ID is diff Well, I guess some of them are the same. I guess it is the same. But I guess it would be neat to see, like, a check mark, to know, hey, that is done. It's complete. Everything's fulfilled, you know, like, because right now, like, the one at the top is kind of, it's not done yet. It's not finished. So, I don't know, like, I guess, I guess that's just me. When I go to look through that, especially if it jumps, like, say, they start work, working on something on the 10th, and then it's not finished till the 13th. So you're getting that day in between. You're not getting dates that are in order necessarily, or item ID, like the silver loom ID in the same order, or even the sage number, like, I guess, I guess that's what's a little confusing for me. Like, it'd be nice when a job is done, it either changes to another color, or, Hey, it's complete. Because, I don't know, maybe looking back even from another. Perspective, would that show, hey, why? Why was this job? Was it not complete, you know, or what? Maybe, maybe I'm wrong. But that would that's going to take a little bit for me to get used to learning those, the IDs and the like using the sage number. I mean, it's all new for me too.

Unknown Speaker  45:16
So, yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:20
So one option on that we can run past murder. I'm sure he's got an opinion as well. But basically what you're looking for, if you want a numeric value to that, basically what you're looking for is the remaining needed minus quantity assembled, which is how many was left after this work, where it was done. And I don't know what you what's the, what you call that,

Unknown Speaker  45:46
even the,

Unknown Speaker  45:49
yeah, like, the orders 400

Speaker 6  45:51
like, I'm looking at that one, and they still need 400 but there's 360 left, or there's 360 made. So there's basically 40 that need to be made yet today, right, right?

Matthias Miller  46:05
So it's almost good, no, it's

Speaker 6  46:07
gonna say, you do have to kind of think about that, because you're like, until he updates that, and depending when he does, it's not going to be accurate,

Unknown Speaker  46:15
right, right?

Speaker 6  46:21
Yeah, yeah. And I don't know he does that, like, is it end of the day? Is it morning? Is it, you know, will this get updated Monday? You know, I don't know what that looks like.

Matthias Miller  46:30
I think he's doing that basically daily. But I mean, the challenge, and here's part of the disconnect, because the guys out in the shop are not thinking about sales orders, right? They're, they're thinking, I have this I have this item, like the three of us have this item that we're going to assemble for the next four hours, and and that's how they think about it. And so part of this ends up being a translation, feel like kind of a fairly core trans translation gap, because you have been thinking about it in that way. We're trying to tie it out in sales orders. That's just two different ways of thinking so, but we could, but to your point, it's currently reverse sorted by completion date, because that's what makes the most sense for for John, right? You can sort any of these columns. And so if you wanted to, you could click sage order number and sort the heading and sort sorted by the number. Or we could also group. We could give you options on,

Unknown Speaker  47:42
yeah, how to group them? Or, right? Because I just,

Speaker 6  47:47
I mean, yeah, when you look at it, and you can look and see all the numbers that you can tell what man as the more I look at it, and the more I work in it, it will make sense. But like, I can look and see, you know, what's finished. And I guess, when it changes like I guess I'm looking at the one. Okay, so let me just see. So that's the same stage order between the 25th and the 26th

Matthias Miller  48:17
so here's another interesting thing,

Unknown Speaker  48:21
the color coding is

Matthias Miller  48:24
designed for John because the reason for the color coding is that, yeah, the reason For the color coding is that you might have assemble a bunch of stuff over multiple days, right? And so John wants to come in and put in Monday's hours, and he comes in the next day and put in, puts in Tuesday hours, and then puts in Wednesday hours, and then on Wednesday, he bundles all three together and says, across these three days, this is how many we assembled. Okay? And so the reason for this color coding is to say, to say, which days

Speaker 6  49:08
are grouped together. I see okay, for

Matthias Miller  49:11
your perspective, it really makes more sense. It would make more sense. Yeah, it would be by sales order, right, right.

Speaker 6  49:19
What's finished? Right, right, right. Like to me that the 25th and 26th same stage orders, obviously the 1000, it would look better if they both said, you know, that they it was like 1000 they were finished. You know, as opposed to seeing 594, and 286, and then seeing it in two different colors.

Unknown Speaker  49:41
Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  49:42
Would you want to see it? Yeah, would you want to see it finished as of across all time, so that we're worse or see it that I.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
Okay, like, I

Matthias Miller  50:03
know I'm getting very much in the weeds here, but on the 1000, on the 1001 would you want that checked on? Like, 80358, sales order 80358, that was ultimately finished. Would you want a checkbox on the first row where you completed it, but not a second one, because, as of that work order, it wasn't done. Would you want to check mark? To say, grand scheme of things, this thing got done, right?

Speaker 6  50:32
Like the check mark? Yeah, grand scheme that it's finished. Like, whether it took two days, five days, 10 days, whatever that it that it was complete. Because, I mean to me, it just as as looking at it quickly, if you're trying to verify and even look over things to make sure everything looks like it's lining up. That to me, maybe it's just me. It's just kind of confusing for me. Like, yeah, that might have been the expectation for that particular day. Is to finish the 286 but ultimately it was to finish the Order at 1000 right?

Matthias Miller  51:03
Yeah, let me, let me try something here. Yeah, I mean, I don't

Speaker 6  51:06
know, I don't, I guess I don't want to change it for everybody. But to me, it just that would be a quick way to look to say, yes, that's finished, finished, finished. Like, to me, that's just per day, fine, but not for job.

Speaker 4  51:19
Yeah, Oh, great. Thank

Unknown Speaker  52:15
Let's ride I mean is

Unknown Speaker  53:02
Interesting, it

Unknown Speaker  53:34
all

Speaker 3  53:36
right, This would be, Then, I think

Unknown Speaker  54:02
that let's.

Speaker 3  56:26
This and then should actually be equal.

Matthias Miller  57:24
You have a lot, we have a lot of sales orders that are not buying out completely. I'm going to save this here as a I'm

Matthias Miller  57:51
I think this could even be I think we can take what you're proposing one step further. If you click the click a little star, the star icon

Unknown Speaker  58:04
over here. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  58:07
right. And then go to User folders,

Unknown Speaker  58:09
okay,

Matthias Miller  58:12
go into click proposed assembly tracker down at the bottom,

Unknown Speaker  58:15
okay.

Unknown Speaker  58:19
Hit continue.

Matthias Miller  58:25
So, I mean, we could do something like this, where we use the same sorting by date, but we have them grouped up at the top with incomplete sales orders, okay, and and then if you scroll down quite a few pages on the top, yeah, scroll the top. One down.

Unknown Speaker  58:49
Oops, sorry.

Matthias Miller  58:50
Goes all the way so good. Goes all the way back to 623, okay. Keep going. A little bit more. Oh no, sorry, not that. If you go to line about 353 60, if you hover over the road, if you hover over the road, will tell you what row number you're on.

Speaker 6  59:15
I don't even know where you're seeing the number. And so I was like, what date? What they Yeah, what date.

Matthias Miller  59:22
Okay, so if I mean, if you, if you take the there's a break, there's going to be a break between 623 and 911 so if you, or Yeah, so if you, if you take this one down to 623 you'll see a break into the next No, it went to 911 it went too far.

Speaker 6  59:42
Laptop, up. You said, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  59:47
go

Speaker 2  59:49
go ahead, go ahead. Well, you're understanding what he's saying. Let him

Unknown Speaker  59:53
Where do you want to be? Matt, no, we were

Matthias Miller  59:55
chatting a little bit. Amanda was suggesting that we have a way to visually differentiate. Between sales orders that have been that have been completed, and ones that haven't. So I was playing around with the version of this report. If you scroll to the top this, this is for any complete sales orders. So here are ones, I mean, and we can go down to the list. Of course, we expect recent ones to not be done, but if you keep going down to the list, we have it would mirror the bottom report. It's just a different way of showing that information, or mostly mirrors it. But we got a bunch of orders here, where like it's not.

Matthias Miller  1:00:54
If I did this, if I did this, right, 1128,

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
we. Where we where we over assembled or under assembled, right? So Amanda was just saying it'd be easier if, if you could filter out the ones that aren't aren't complete, the sales orders that haven't been complete up at the top. So I don't know if you want to do this. Do it like this, but it's an option.

Speaker 1  1:01:22
So what are, yeah, so what are the the other, let's just the other options for um, ways to see this is the bottom is bottom

Matthias Miller  1:01:36
is still there. Another option would be, it would be to show a balance of remaining needed, minus quantity assembled,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:47
yeah, or, or

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
beside the sage order, we could also do this beside the sage orders have The the remaining quantity,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:00
yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:02:01
that would, that would also be a, I was saying

Speaker 6  1:02:05
it would have been nice to see, like, a check mark, like, done, done, done that way, if that maybe would get caught sooner if they looked at it at glance, like, when, because it's almost, it's kind of nice to get that. Cha Ching, you know when you know, you can remember something, what?

Speaker 1  1:02:20
Matt, oh, we were talking about having, like, when you if I, if I go to, if I go to, the drop down, say, hit, you know, I don't know if Phase 017,

Speaker 1  1:02:39
this guy here, and then continue, and then up at the, oh, it does do that at the bottom. Now, okay, it wasn't doing that the last time I did. I'm sorry. No, this is, this is very helpful, um, um, also, here's complete, okay, I see when I broke

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
it. Do you like it broken apart like this, or is that just confusing?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
Yeah, no, I hear you, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
I see what you're showing me now, I didn't, we didn't.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
I think I'd rather

Speaker 1  1:03:32
well like if the the incompletes and the completes could all be, could both be wrong when it comes when it comes to attaching the correct sage order number with the correct work order, right, you're right, and that, for that reason, I'd rather see them in date order and then have Another have, like a different color, maybe for the incompletes,

Matthias Miller  1:04:06
right? I mean, we can, we can very easily. Instead of doing it like that, we could very easily do a let's

Speaker 3  1:04:16
see sage order number. What if we did something like this?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
Is sage?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:34
Are you? Are you kind of

Speaker 6  1:04:36
understanding? I just said it was really confusing at a glance, when you're looking over stuff, when the colors are different, it was whatever that one was. We were looking at the fabril, the one where it was two different days of work, but you're only seeing like you're seeing like it was 1000 and they did so many in one day and so many other it's nice to see when the full 1000. Is done. So whether, whether it was like with a check mark to say that order is complete, it's done, you know, or that number seeing that the full quantity is finished.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:18
Oh, he's getting the course Amen?

Speaker 1  1:05:24
Yeah, we're going to try to back and reconcile. That's what I'm working on. I'm saying back pre on the old stuff, on Excel stuff too. Hey, Matt, hey, hey.

Speaker 7  1:05:38
On the bottom stuff, there is all that stuff flagged. I mean, there's no flags on it, but it's all that need something done to it.

Matthias Miller  1:05:48
I mean, the bottom line is, yes, all of these are the ones in the bottom. Don't have a zero tie. We have either over produced or under produced on the sales order,

Speaker 7  1:05:58
right? But on some of the ones I'm going through now, like the HF on there is stuff like for 925, it hasn't even happened yet.

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
No, no, just ignore it. Ignore it. We don't have a good way to say, I mean, we, you know, it's, we're just worried about old stuff that's not like your list. This list, ideally would only be the stuff that's you're working on, or is is coming up. There's also going to be probably a little bit of the stuff right around 623, when we switched over. That might be, I don't know how that'll be to tie out. Might be a little tricky. I don't, I don't know for sure, but,

Speaker 7  1:06:37
yeah, that's now. So that's some of that stuff I did. I did a lot of it, actually, but I was just wondering why the stuff that hasn't even happened yet was down there. That's all,

Matthias Miller  1:06:49
yeah, it's just because we have a I guess we could. Well, yeah, we could. We could, uh, it sorted by. It's sort of currently by due date. I believe we could give a little bit more of a visual if we needed to, between ones that are due or pass through versus the others. But you don't, we're just throwing everything in there.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:18
Okay, all right. You want to go more by date. Well, 920 not having the exact right?

Speaker 1  1:07:26
Yeah, you mean on the bottom here, yeah, that's just open sage order numbers or ones, the

Speaker 7  1:07:31
bottom stuff supposed to be stuff that needs fixed. Oh, out of this, right? So, if not,

Matthias Miller  1:07:36
all of them on the bottom do need to be fixed. But it is, it is, I mean, assuming this information is right, then it's concerning to have a sales order for 1245, and we've got 30 left. You know, we're down here somewhere. You see these negatives. We had an order for 42 made 84

Unknown Speaker  1:07:56
I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00
just starting up there. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:02
that's Hey, Jeff, yeah,

Speaker 7  1:08:06
it's not even here yet. Okay, I'm just, I'm just trying to fix the stuff on the bottom. I just took notice of that when I was going through it. So I just, yeah. Now the yellow flags, they're not there anymore. That's still, that still means they need fixed right on the bottom.

Matthias Miller  1:08:21
Somehow, the yellow flags on the top, yeah, if they show up on the top, there's still something to be fixed. We got the we just got done wrapping up the we actually closed all of those out. Now those are good to go.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:37
The what we so I

Matthias Miller  1:08:39
don't know if you remember the issue with babrill, where one of the sales orders wasn't

Speaker 7  1:08:43
showing up because of how stuff all right, right, right, yeah, so the sales

Matthias Miller  1:08:48
order showing up. Now we went ahead and cleaned that up. And I'm actually not seeing the time at I

Speaker 7  1:08:55
just took care of that sweet I just matched them all up.

Matthias Miller  1:09:00
So we gotta, we gotta clean slate on the warnings here. Yeah, okay, okay.

Speaker 7  1:09:06
So, yeah, I'm just saying, like, if it doesn't have yellow flags, and I don't, I don't need to do anything with the bottom stuff, then

Matthias Miller  1:09:12
no, if you still, we still need to clean up the bottom stuff, because we have, even if there aren't yellow flags, because if you have us,

Speaker 7  1:09:26
I mean, a lot of that stuff, not even mine, like long run, Gotcha,

Matthias Miller  1:09:32
okay, lumber and stuff. I mean, if there's lumber and stuff, then we need to update the item data and get that out of the list as a non assembly item.

Speaker 7  1:09:40
Yeah, there's a lot of that stuff in there too. You

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
can let them throw it off. Just waste time. Well,

Speaker 1  1:09:46
that's just me too. So one time we go in the item data, mark it as a lumber item, right? Non assembly item, check the box, and then it'll be taken care of. Well, Matt, like. I think John's wondering like this, due date 925, why is that one down here on the bottom? Isn't that just an open

Matthias Miller  1:10:07
order? Yeah, it's an open order. You're sorting by item code, and then it's sorting by due date within it, it's an open order due on the 25th and we're showing, we're just showing this is all due date.

Speaker 1  1:10:25
These are all orders that are still open. Is that right? Right or incomplete? So they're not all necessarily all for wrong.

Speaker 2  1:10:37
So this right? This is not under assembly at lunch of June, because it's boards. Is that what you're saying

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
the six, three, which one?

Speaker 6  1:10:46
Like, just like I'm looking at date. So if we went to this, this order here, I'm still saying it's not fulfilled. Are you saying that that's under No, no, that's under assembly

Unknown Speaker  1:10:55
start? No, I don't know. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
there was no. I mean, like, it's not

Speaker 1  1:11:02
that one. Eric, have been that was June 23 so that was probably, that was probably assembled the old system. On the old system, the entry was finding the old system. It's never been connected to, right, but, but then there's another one. This one's from, but, yeah. Matthias, here you have like, 1114, showing up, 922, yeah, that's nice.

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
Is it longer? Well, I mean, we can have a future cut off, like, I don't want to see anything that's due more than X number of days out. But how do you set that? Or, I don't know, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
if we go by due date,

Matthias Miller  1:11:42
well, due date is how it sorts. It sorts oldest to newest, right now, if you just let it sort myself,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:52
what's that? I just wonder what the July stuff was.

Speaker 7  1:11:56
They're all stoked in order. So I was wondering the impression everything down there needed fixed. But I mean, if it's if it's if it doesn't have a yellow flag, then it doesn't need fixed, right?

Matthias Miller  1:12:06
Everything in the bottom needs not everything needs to be fixed. The bottom doesn't have flags. Yeah, we do, but we do need to get it caught up so that the only sales orders are the ones that we are either working on or need to do, right?

Speaker 1  1:12:21
There's still on the bottom that haven't the amount, the quantities are, aren't right? Are they

Speaker 7  1:12:28
canceled? I need to, I need to go by due dates then, or say, Yeah, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:12:34
Okay. So the easy. So there's an easy way to do it then, though, if you want to, if you want to go up in the like if you click by item code, I would the easiest way is probably to fix it up by item code. So if you click the item code here,

Speaker 7  1:12:49
well, that's what I was doing, and it does it alphabetical. So I started

Matthias Miller  1:12:53
with click, click on the name itself. So Go, go, click one of these. So click wave 77, five. Yeah. And now it's going to show all this, all the work orders for that one, and it's also going to show all the sales orders.

Speaker 7  1:13:09
So right, so all those that come up need fix somehow,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:14
yeah, all of this, I'm not

Speaker 1  1:13:18
this is just the history of this item, and here's sales orders, and here's the work orders.

Speaker 2  1:13:25
It's not showing yourself when it's separated by days that that's very confusing for me,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:32
separated by teams, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
But I mean, when it's finished, I just that's confusing for me.

Matthias Miller  1:13:44
Okay, so what needs to be cleaned up on this specific screen is sales order, 79718, we did not assemble anything for well, we gotta figure out why, why that was and which one needs to be tied out, then the next one we over assembled. So I'm going to guess that the work order that's tied to the 79768, should also have been tied out to 79718, like right? Because we we produce exact double, then on 80301, they murdered 484, but we only made 483 well, is that a typo? Did we under assemble? Do we need to override the the actual, you know, the the assembly total on this? Got to figure out what that is, and then the 916 is, well, you don't got to clean that one up. That's, that's due on the 16. That's right. So this whatever the guys are doing with that.

Speaker 7  1:14:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I figured out how to override now. Matt, so I'm good, does

Matthias Miller  1:14:44
that make sense? Is it? Is it

Unknown Speaker  1:14:46
that's better? Yeah, yeah, okay,

Speaker 1  1:14:52
but yeah, John, you're Are you overriding just to make your numbers work, or rewriting to that like the trucking schedule? Know it when you override quantities,

Speaker 7  1:15:04
I'm overriding what we're actually shipping,

Speaker 1  1:15:07
yeah, but it's still the exact same as we're shipping. It's just It's when the sage, not when the order number, when the order quantity is changed. You're matching that, right? You're not overriding just to match what the guys are saying. They did not necessarily, right, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
No, I'm matching what we're shipping. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
this right here, like this, probably

Speaker 6  1:15:32
now, did they not? Did they cancel that order? And then it went the next week, and you sent both.

Speaker 7  1:15:36
And I was, I was just, I was just, I need to know where to go, so if I just click on the job and then that comes up, and anything down below there, well, I gotta fix

Speaker 1  1:15:46
if we open this, see how's this work, if I open

Matthias Miller  1:15:52
that one, then you got this order here? Yeah, this one would

Speaker 1  1:15:57
be right. So the 791, I one, it's still later than would have that been the seven, eight due date. John, potentially. No.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:17
So, I mean, I don't I mean, would that change

Speaker 7  1:16:19
that, right? It was months ago. I don't know. I had to look it up,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:23
but that would potentially

Speaker 1  1:16:25
change. I mean, easy, so, so both, both of these work orders, they did 484, both of them were attached to the same sage order number,

Speaker 7  1:16:32
right? That's all I need to find the right number for wallet.

Speaker 1  1:16:37
I mean, possibly it's this one right here, because there was none attached to here. And two, two were this was doubled, so the easy way would be just to attach it to the seven eight order. But it's weird because this was both done after seven eight could be right, could be wrong, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:54
oh, I can, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:16:57
And then this might have been a typo here, right? The 483 was done matting. One still needed, unless the guys came up one short somehow, it's

Speaker 7  1:17:08
probably what happened. Man, see, that's a case where you override it. Just override the quantity 483 and then it's good.

Speaker 1  1:17:16
Was that what was shipped? We so you would have to confirm that on the shipping side, right? Yeah, I'd be surprised. They did 40, but that's what's and then this one here is September 16. Are you doing one like, what, Monday or Tuesday? Making a load for Tuesday? Uh, actually getting ready negative, so that's this one here, 804, so, I mean, that's what John's saying. What Matt's saying, I know is like in this in the assembly tracker. Let me get out of here. I might do this right

Speaker 2  1:18:02
here. Does happen when somebody cancels an order, changes in order, mules in order. What happens? Yeah, like,

Speaker 7  1:18:10
if that's not all the online do they just delete it? Montina deletes it and it should delete it here,

Speaker 2  1:18:16
then our general, if it's readjusted, you're getting a whole new sage number.

Speaker 1  1:18:19
Then, yeah. I mean, if one gets deleted, then another one has to be absolutely, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:27
yeah. No. Wrong thing is

Speaker 6  1:18:30
that, what's happening? I mean, for another day, like, did that get moved around? And that's why they all went at the same time, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:36
Huh? What's the question? Amanda, well,

Speaker 6  1:18:39
like we were looking at that one where it was like, there was none. It was showing none. And then the next week, it showed double.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
Like, did it all get

Unknown Speaker  1:18:47
put on one order? Then,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:49
like, did they know it says it's time to I just gotta look at the right order?

Speaker 1  1:18:52
No, they were, they were the entry was attached to the same so, Sage order for some reason. Yeah. Well, yeah, coming down here and doing it online, going by due date is and go back that way, and then click on these number over here, and then it's showing this, the wrong quant, the sage, and all the work orders are here so you can, when you gotta start at the bottom, we need all of the work orders in the top section. Yeah, because you could, because here it's showing what they did and the sage order number that it was attached to correct, like what we just looked at. It was very obvious that those two work orders were both attached to the same sage order which was incorrect. So we're trying to create a window. We'll have a window where we can see what's wrong and correct it, correct, right? And I think, I think we have a good window

Unknown Speaker  1:19:55
at this point. Yeah.

Speaker 7  1:20:00
Some of that stuff. I opened on the bottom there, and then I checked it. I mean, everything's great, dude. So I'm not sure, was it? You mean old stuff? Well, no, just like, like, I'll just, I started with a jet just went down.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:13
Oh, you mean the new order, yeah? Because that hasn't been made yet, right?

Speaker 7  1:20:18
No, not all that stuff. Stan, just, just what

Speaker 1  1:20:22
was right down the bottom. I don't know you're saying the Kalani ordered was right. And, yeah,

Speaker 7  1:20:29
it was 200 order 200 I'm going over stuff with Tina in here. She's looking up the making sure I have the right sage order number on her end to match it up. Well, if you have

Speaker 1  1:20:39
an example of one that's on the bottom, that's That's right, just bring it to Matt's attention.

Speaker 7  1:20:48
Our attention to see, okay, what it was. But okay, it was an HF, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:20:53
yeah, so John, we did fix that issue. Did you? Were you able to confirm that 308, to 220, quantity change? Did you confirm that those quantity changes are coming through now?

Speaker 7  1:21:04
Oh, yeah, they are, yeah, yeah, they are now. And it was, it was happening with Georgia system too, like he wasn't getting them in from, from that,

Matthias Miller  1:21:14
yep, yep, stuff like that. That was, it was just a, it was a, an issue. We gotta pull in the pulling the original number instead of the latest one and anything like that. If we get, if we get specifics, there's this one. It should be this, it should be that, whatever,

Speaker 7  1:21:30
figure it out. So I texted it to you like that, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:21:34
Perfect. Appreciate it very much. Yeah. Do you know which

Unknown Speaker  1:21:47
two maybe try this 11 here?

Speaker 1  1:21:50
Yeah, the 200 here. I'm seeing an order for 600 on 711 another 100 on 711 and then 700 were done. But they were all signed this guy here. So this will Matt. We can't Well, so if I click on there, this is an easy fix. They were all so if I open this work order, some of these should go to 79934,

Speaker 4  1:22:22
I'm add

Speaker 1  1:22:29
new road. Can add to that Amanda

Unknown Speaker  1:22:33
hit the plus button, 79934,

Speaker 1  1:22:39
there's 100 Can I change the quantity?

Matthias Miller  1:22:43
Yeah, just drop that one to 600 and put in 700 or 100 down at the bottom,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:55
like that, and then save it, yep.

Speaker 3  1:23:00
So that'll be boom, that's prepared. What am I doing here?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:10
Sorry, can I refresh that page?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:16
Yeah, just hit refresh.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:18
Let's run them in. No, I know I didn't see anything.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:21
I'm just, yeah, John, did you have another question about okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:26
okay, so I should give them order date and work up.

Speaker 1  1:23:32
Well, due date, maybe I yeah, alright, start with the oldest ones. Yeah. Excuse me, yeah. But if the oldest ones are right, like we did with that burger, yeah, it kept correcting, and we now that doesn't mean we don't have to go back in time. We have to go back in time. But if you started then, like June 23 June 26 window and it's right, you know. And come front then, then we know we're clean. So now, yeah, as far as going back free Excel stuff with with Steven's excel program, that's where probably have a man to work on reconciling some of that stuff, if we can.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:18
All right, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
All right. Do you have questions? Amanda, no,

Speaker 5  1:24:26
that's good, yeah, yeah, okay, um, yeah, learning. All right. Um.

Speaker 1  1:24:37
Matt, so back to the well, a couple things here, Amanda, you were saying that you would like to see the ones that are complete.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:46
Can you

Speaker 6  1:24:50
it's just, to me, it's just confusing, like, it's just nice when you see something that it's complete, like when it's separated between two days and it's certain amounts, or, I mean, potentially even three days, depending on what it is. Is just it's hard for me. Maybe I'll be used to it as I look

Speaker 1  1:25:03
through it. So, so when you're talking about complete, are you? What are you? What would you like to see as being complete?

Speaker 6  1:25:12
Like when I look across here and we see total needed and what was assembled, you know, that is just clean to me. You know, when I look back through, and then I see, right? You know that it's not finished. I guess that's what.

Speaker 1  1:25:26
But these are, we have the completed ones in here because we need that history. Oh, correct, right. But what? What is the confusion? It's okay, no, no. But what's the confusing part?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:43
You understand what I meant, Matthias, right?

Matthias Miller  1:25:45
Yeah. I mean, it's just being able to tell at a glance which one of these sales orders are zeroed out. Like, that's, that's the, that's it in a nutshell thing, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:58
right? Because

Speaker 1  1:26:01
that's all the sales orders are on the bottom. This is the work orders up here,

Matthias Miller  1:26:04
right? No, but even when you're looking through the work orders as you're looking for what to clean up, what needs attention,

Speaker 1  1:26:10
but that's where, but Matthias isn't that the isn't that the other window where we're saying assembly tracker warnings,

Matthias Miller  1:26:20
um, the warnings won't necessarily tell you. The warnings will tell you if the work order doesn't have a isn't tied out at all, or it over produced. It won't tell you if the sales order was never attached. Okay, right? I'll never pose down if a sales order was attached, but I

Speaker 6  1:26:51
guess it's hard to me. That's where I'm coming. Like, that's that respect, like, the sales order. I guess that's where I'm obviously, we take the order we want to complete and finish. Like, so that's where I'm like, jumping right in the middle.

Speaker 1  1:27:04
Well, I'm trying to think of, no, I'm trying to hear what you're saying. But right what? Let me see

Matthias Miller  1:27:10
if I can get you a

Unknown Speaker  1:27:14
a little visual, and just

Speaker 1  1:27:18
like, here's one, 911, 42 needed 84 assembled. Like we know that should have been different, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:32
So then

Speaker 5  1:27:38
8024 done. But then, like,

Speaker 2  1:27:41
it's the finished part up here, because it's a different day. I guess. If you go to the top of that, what's that? If, if you scroll up to the top of the screen, yeah, or which way is it going? That's tall.

Speaker 1  1:27:56
This is the latest entries, yeah, whatever the screen was we were looking at

Speaker 2  1:27:59
earlier. And this one's a lot clearer because it's it's showing them, for the most part, finished. You know what was expected, what got finished and what's done.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
There was just one that just because it's separated by day,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:19
but yet the color was the same. I can't wear that one went to show you. It's okay, okay.

Speaker 1  1:28:36
Um, Matt, am I? Am I looking at this right, like in my mind, the down on the bottom, the sage orders, we're trying to fill, the orders the work orders are. That's our tracking. So I'm not so concerned about the work order numbers as I am about the sage orders being filled correctly, right? So, like, up here we have work orders that, and I'm seeing I'm not well, this was yesterday, so I guess these guys would have finished these jobs today. Like here, there was 35 and they did four. They still need four. I'm not sure what that's about. I guess here's 50. And they did two. So that was probably at the end of the day yesterday, 4221 here's 142, and 84 like, that's concerning, like, I'm not sure why

Unknown Speaker  1:29:40
it worked from 1253, to 357, on this high steel.

Speaker 1  1:29:47
They did 84 and this order is for 42 so, like, that's not right. John just entered that this morning. So, you know, like. Well, I'll get a safe. I'll get a safe. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:30:07
want to make it harder than

Unknown Speaker  1:30:10
it needs to be by any means.

Matthias Miller  1:30:14
Here you want to pop open that report again. We can, and I don't know. Maybe it's not meaningful. Maybe it's are we? Yeah, are we going to learn I didn't hear

Speaker 6  1:30:25
what you said. Sorry. It's never right.

Matthias Miller  1:30:28
I've got, I've got an idea when, when MERV gets back.

Speaker 6  1:30:32
Okay, he just came back. Yep, he's right here. Do you

Unknown Speaker  1:30:35
need him? What's your schedule, Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:30:37
I've got at least until 10, maybe 1015, my time.

Speaker 1  1:30:45
I'm looking at the order dates for high steel, which is usually Monday. So that's the 15th we have. What they do here, h 2.5 there are 84 there are 84 on order, 80497, that doesn't make sense. Why is that showing 42 well, they were the wrong quantity. Yeah, the quantity needed saying 42 but the sage order the printout meant maybe she put that role in the printout.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:33
You see that

Unknown Speaker  1:31:36
right here, it's 84, 80497, but in the computer, it's saying 42

Unknown Speaker  1:31:47
it's just a lot of mistakes, and it's driving me

Speaker 6  1:31:50
nuts. And then for me to come into a blind it makes

Speaker 1  1:31:53
it even harder. So put the sands on them. Matt's doing. Matt is doing a really good job of giving us the tools, and now he's giving us tools to clean up our own mess, and we keep making more messes, and we're asking him to fix the tools so that we can right. You know what I mean? It's like, we gotta get this right. Like we can't just keep asking Matt to change the cleanup tools because, but

Speaker 6  1:32:21
if we're making the product, this should have already been looked at beforehand to know that everything was aligning like you should be able to use sure you know what I mean, to check it to make sure that. So if I you're making

Speaker 1  1:32:31
so here I just my main focus here Matt is I want to. I want to. I'm trying. I want to try to bring Amanda into this in a way that she can understand it and be helpful. Yeah, yes, sir. James, chuckling, who's June's trucking?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:53
June trucking schedule? Yeah, that's it. I have

Unknown Speaker  1:32:55
the ones from Cecil,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:58
and you have George's.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:01
I have no,

Speaker 1  1:33:04
I have Cecil, but there were my desk and I grab, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:09
yeah, they're in that.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:14
Wow, um,

Speaker 1  1:33:17
oh, dude. Anyway, So Matt, does that make sense? So if, if Amanda's saying it's confusing, I'm I want to, I want it to not be confusing for you. Amanda, right? So, like, that's what I'm trying to understand. What was confusing you?

Speaker 6  1:33:33
Well, maybe separating it and seeing it down here at the bottom, like I said, Well, maybe that's what. Maybe that would be better for

Speaker 1  1:33:40
me. This is the bottom is the sage orders that are incomplete. And this is by this is by due date. So this is going all the way back to June. Man, is that? Am I right here? Yeah, it's by duty. So, like, right coming forward. Here's July ones that need cleaned up, like these are where, and we can see the order. We can see the if there was an override, the quality, the worst symbol, the remaining need. So we know there's issues correct. And I can see that clear, as all the information up top is like, just ignore. It's the same. It's going to fix that as soon as I click on one of these and see, like, like, here's 504 or 501 like that. I don't know. The guys should have, like, wobbled in and make 501 I have no idea, but they needed three more, and it should so, yeah, we can go back and arrive. But here's one. It's like, we needed 20. We did 60. So like, so we think extra or not. Well, we click on the sage order number, okay, in here.

Matthias Miller  1:34:50
There you go. Here it is player's day.

Speaker 1  1:34:54
Um, this is 79981, dash, 08, they needed 20. You. They did 20 here and there. They did, I mean, it was 40 extra.

Speaker 5  1:35:04
This is that how that's negative 20 there. Well, like,

Speaker 1  1:35:11
so, um, this order was for 711 they probably did diesel on the ball. Let's go see what it says. So now we go search 213, to 430, 20 pallets and seven tops. So they didn't the 20 didn't even apply. Okay? It shouldn't say 20 because it didn't. It should be a zero entry because they're not finished. Well, this was Pat. This is a crate kit, so this was the pallets and the tops, which is not completing it. But let's go back. We'll go back now. We'll look at this work order. This is part of the 20 and here they may let's see if you put notes in sides. Only 40. Yeah, and we're not allowed to. I mean, sides don't count. So it's just, it's just, it's a seriously, a lot of really bad entries,

Speaker 6  1:36:14
because it really shouldn't be completely until, until they're completely made.

Speaker 1  1:36:19
It shouldn't be right. So when they're doing if, if they're doing parts for the whole thing, the parts don't count towards the whole thing, like only the time, 20 of the crate kits is what we call these. You could call it a crate. You could call it a whatever you want to call it a box, yeah, but there's 20 ordered for that order, we need 20 pounds. We need 40 sides and 20 tops, and I don't care how many ends and whatever else all but when they do the all those pieces, that's not a quantity completed entry. It's a zero quantity completed entry. You can still attach it to the sage order number, but it's zero quantity. That way, the time that was spent, and the people exactly yes, and understand, understand completely. And then

Speaker 8  1:37:06
when they've completed, when they assemble, right? The whole assembly that's done, they

Speaker 1  1:37:12
assembled the 20, if they did three yesterday, enter three. If they did 17 today, enter 17 today. We got 20. And all the time, and everybody's effort is accounted for, and the sage oil is complete. Got it. So if we go back here to this assembly

Unknown Speaker  1:37:32
tracker,

Speaker 1  1:37:35
all we have here now this is last entries that John did. If we go by date 911, we can scroll down now we go, 910, nine, nine. This. That's all it is. Down on the bottom, Matt has created this window for all the sage orders that are either not completed or quantities don't match correct. So this is the window that we look for. And like, you can even drag this thing, which is fun. You can get right out of the way, or bring it up here, and you can scroll down. And if you're like, Okay, if you know high serve seven, here's a discrepancy. Well, then let me check all my high serve sevens, just to see if there's a pattern, or right, if there's always 100 off. And so now we now we hit item code, we scroll down, and here we see all these high serve sevens that have issues. So you see a bit of maybe there's a pattern to me, you know? It's just a window, and then as soon as you click on high serve seven, boom. Now we have all the high serve seven on the bottom and up top, you have all the work order entries for high serve seven, whether they're right or wrong. Because if there were other orders in this date range from June 23 to 915 if there were orders that were done right and the quantities matched, even if it's the wrong sales order, Sage order number, it's not going to show up on the bottom, and that's fine, but the way to do this is go back to the oldest one and and clean the oldest one, and then just keep working forward. And does that make

Speaker 6  1:39:16
sense? I'm just trying to figure out how we're getting the negative ones minus 63 so is that because it's the parts so that that's what we're entering, is the parts that

Unknown Speaker  1:39:31
click on the work order, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:33
Because that's what's throwing the numbers off.

Speaker 1  1:39:37
They work from seven to 1030 they did 84 mm.

Matthias Miller  1:39:41
Four. So some, but not there were some during this time period where we automatically added rows to balance things out, and nothing got double checked. And so somewhere it. Was over, like this one got over, produced earlier and and then there was a subsequent one that corrected. And then, I don't, there's some of that that happened for a period of maybe a month or two in here, okay,

Speaker 1  1:40:19
but it's, it's to do it like, correctly, is have the trucking schedule. And even there, Matt, I found, like, there was a couple of those burgers that we, we cleaned up all that burger Oh, 3.5 and there were some of those that weren't even on the trucking schedule, but they did get shipped. And so then we had to go to Tina, and hey, did we ship an order? Sage order number? And she's like, Yeah, we shipped it. So it's, uh,

Speaker 1  1:40:54
yeah. So, so a combination, man, of having this shipping. Matt, I'm showing Amanda. This the shipping schedule, which has, there we go, date, quantity, customer, sorry, look at that sage order number. I don't know all that stuff. We have one for every day. We have the old printouts. So it's a good reference point, like, if I go back here.

Speaker 6  1:41:24
So how do we? I don't know how you fix that one then. So this one here, total needed was 84

Speaker 1  1:41:28
I have to go back well, so now we can do this without taking Matt's time. But okay, I would say like so. So this was, they did this on eight, eight. Well, if I hit, if I had a drop down here, it's going to show all the, all the orders in history. Um, wait, let me go back here. What was

Matthias Miller  1:41:58
I said? These are still sorted wrong, aren't they?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:03
Man, I don't know. Maybe

Matthias Miller  1:42:04
no, no, no, it's just this one's at the bottom. That's it. Never mind

Unknown Speaker  1:42:08
which one was on there. Was it this guy? It was this guy, wasn't it?

Speaker 1  1:42:19
Yeah, like, i i The 84 that they did got attached to two different sage orders. The right thing to do is, is to go back with the trucking schedules from June, July and August, and just look at the quantities, like if I did this on eight eight. You know, eight eight was, I mean, this is elaborate, but eight eight was a Friday, so they probably shipped on 811 so the order date was probably 811

Speaker 6  1:42:54
but it could potentially be under two different stages. 811 needed 63

Speaker 1  1:42:59
why? There was this is odd. I mean, like, yeah, negative, this number, this sage order number, was obviously used for another, well, 80416, let's go back so now I can search the sage order number two, if I go here 70 tracker and hit this drop down, what was that? 80416 I can go 80416 continue, make sure historical and make sure these boxes aren't checked, because it'll do a different thing. Now it's showing me 80416,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:45
that's not even the same. That's not it, because that's running.

Speaker 1  1:43:50
No, it was wrong. I had the wrong one. It was high serve. Seven, yeah, uh,

Speaker 3  1:43:55
shoot. Which one was it? No,

Speaker 1  1:44:00
84 I not showing up now. Oh, was this guy right here? This 88014680410,

Speaker 1  1:44:17
there you go. Go back here. 80146 80146,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:31
so here

Unknown Speaker  1:44:34
they did, 77, on the eighth.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:47
Now what's going on here?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:49
Yes, yes,

Speaker 1  1:44:52
0146, it is seven, and we did 37 and. 77 and like, it's just a lot of different. The some of these aren't This is the one there. Well, 801 so now, if I go like this high serve 7801, step right here. There was 63 made on the eighth that was entered. Here was 63 made on the seventh that was entered, and six another 63 on the seventh. Like it doesn't

Speaker 6  1:45:35
it should be this should never be negative. It should have been 84 minus 63 because that's what's needed.

Speaker 1  1:45:43
Anyway, the numbers were all chopped up, right there, you see, yeah, this is what we've been anyway, watch Matt. We Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:56
it's like I got a headache.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:57
Yeah, I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  1:46:01
it's hot in here. I knew that.

Speaker 1  1:46:03
Yeah, we turn off the AC so we can hear, and

Matthias Miller  1:46:08
I'm gonna have to drop you a big Bluetooth speaker so at least we can do something like that, and you can have the air running hear me over that. I know,

Speaker 1  1:46:17
I know I need, uh, we need some help with that set up and stuff. Shoot, okay, I want to make sure we cover others things we need to cover. Matt, we have Amanda's user. We're good there. Now you can get on Amanda. Yeah, yep, we need, man, I were talking about this a week ago. We need somebody that can handle details to make this program work. And if that's if that's you, I'm not sure what pieces would fall under your responsibility or watch, but

Speaker 6  1:47:07
at least, like I told him, I was used to looking at item ID, looking at that end before preparing for a cut list, that was where I spent a lot of my time in. Yeah, this is all new to me as well. Yep, not that I don't understand it, but I'm I think it's just my I'm coming from a different perspective, and then I'm also coming from the sage order number and fulfilling the order, because I see that end of it also. So that's where now it's just putting it all together, because it is kind of like a puzzle,

Speaker 1  1:47:37
and that's okay, but yeah, well, I can walk through some of these,

Speaker 6  1:47:41
but I'm seeing stuff that doesn't look right. So that's, I mean, that's already showing me that I'm at least developing a vision for what needs to happen.

Speaker 1  1:47:49
So Matt, the other thing I sent you was, I just said, so we're trying to build out sort of eight, uh, Personnel Information. What did I write on there?

Speaker 6  1:48:05
Oh, yeah, underneath the employees, where you can put information like their address and all that,

Speaker 1  1:48:10
yeah, employee data page, um, you already have some some things in here. Matt, um, employee, employees, yeah, which is great. If I click in personnel, we have, mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:34
can we use that

Speaker 6  1:48:37
for all personal information I was creating? I've used a tracker that I had in Google that I was entering it all in, but boy, it would be nice to have it all in one place.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:47
Yeah. So

Matthias Miller  1:48:48
the biggest question that we need to talk to through is data privacy.

Speaker 1  1:48:53
Yeah, right. My question I asked Matt was, can we build this out for HR management and private documents, or should we file private documents separately? Yeah, Matt, what are your thoughts?

Matthias Miller  1:49:09
I mean, we, we can.

Matthias Miller  1:49:18
So you would want, I'm assuming HR, HR is a single permission somebody either can see HR stuff or can

Unknown Speaker  1:49:28
Right, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:49:30
and, and you would lock down, would you lock down the phone, address and email as well, personal contact info,

Speaker 1  1:49:39
no contact info, address. I mean, there's some things that could be available to anyone that has company access,

Matthias Miller  1:49:55
but the documents, the main thing would just be having a way to put documents in here

Speaker 1  1:49:59
that. Or private, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 6  1:50:02
And if we wanted to scan something in, like, maybe there were, yeah, documents, maybe MERV typed up something about a discussion he had with an employee and then wants to save that. Like, where could we put that? Where it would be private, whether it's sent there, or if it's something scanned, because maybe he hand wrote it because it just was convenient, I don't know, like, whatever, or maybe it's a picture, maybe it's something that happened, like, maybe it's from an injury, or, you know, whatever, like,

Speaker 1  1:50:28
and, and I'm not, I'm not, like, totally opposed to keeping that separate, in a separate, you know, either in a in a drawer, locked cabinet, in a paper file. I mean, I'm not opposed to that, right? Um, we're just a man. Amanda's helping me, Matt, and we're like, we're gonna, we're taking on, we're realizing that we need to. We're gathering data. And I am already doing HR, and I have a, I have a little bit of a paper trail. Love to have it clean up a little bit more. So either way, we'll clean it up, even if we if it's complicated to file private stuff alongside of this platform or program, then that's not the worst thing.

Matthias Miller  1:51:20
It's not super I need to, I need to check in just a handful of things. It's not super complicated. I need to do a little bit of,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:27
okay,

Speaker 2  1:51:31
really, probably, because everything else could be available. Well, I don't know,

Matthias Miller  1:51:37
yeah, you depending how much so you can actually there's two things I need to check you can actually upload files in here, but I want to make sure I'm not. I'm not sure that the files that you upload directly into here have the same restrictions that we'd be needing to have. I need to research that, and also the storage fees on files in here are we can, we can put it in here, but have it, have it stored somewhere else without getting into the weeds. Have it all be here, but have a lower cost storage option so that, especially when you're uploading pictures and PDFs and stuff like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:23
so that we're not but let me, let me, if

Matthias Miller  1:52:26
it's only documents, then and then we and then, yes, for something like executive notes, we can control who has access to see executive notes. And so if you just want to, if you just want to type up notes, we could,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:45
yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:48
We could also have that,

Speaker 6  1:52:49
and we could start from there moving forward too, like the way we put a lot of stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:54
I mean, it's obviously something we could do on a different on a different workbook, or, you know, platform,

Matthias Miller  1:53:08
it's, it's obviously not a huge deal to do it. I just need to check, check a little bit, and it's maybe in an hour or two for me to get set up

Unknown Speaker  1:53:20
email where we could scan it stuff in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:24
Yeah, you scan it and upload it in here.

Speaker 1  1:53:27
Well, then for us, we're currently scanning like would that have to be scanned at a particular computer?

Matthias Miller  1:53:36
You would scan it in and then grab the scan and go through an upload process to upload it

Speaker 1  1:53:43
so you could scan it to your Yep, scan file.

Speaker 6  1:53:49
I'll move it. However, if I would send it to my email, you would have the ability then to upload it whatever. Yeah, yep, it would be really helpful.

Speaker 1  1:53:58
I guess I'm I'm sorry. I'm a little hesitant. Maybe that's fear, but I'm a little hesitant to go through that process, because we I don't know. Why am I? I shouldn't be well.

Matthias Miller  1:54:15
I mean, it's not, it's not the worst. I mean, it is sensitive information, so you want to be mindful of that we do have. So here's how I think of these things. I mean, where are the vulnerabilities we have banks who depend on our data restrictions to make sure that they're in compliance, to make sure that they're not, you know, I don't know. It's not insider trading, but it's that kind of a thing where this department can't see what this department is doing, right? So, from a software side, not worried. But there's the, you know, it's, it's the probably, wait until we get back like a bridge, yeah? Right? Well, it's like, it's a breach, it's it's a bad password, it's, right? Mer Merz, laptop gets stolen. Somebody jumps in the conference room while he's using the bathroom on a conference call. That's a bigger vulnerability to this stuff probably, but you still want to be mindful of Yeah, what? Yeah, so yeah. But as far as contact info and all this other kind of stuff, go fire away.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:34
What's that?

Matthias Miller  1:55:37
I mean, those are the considerations on the file uploads, and there's workarounds too, if you are more comfortable with it, having a like a Google Drive, or if you're switching to office 365 having a SharePoint folder or something with things organized in there,

Speaker 6  1:55:54
yeah, that's what I have now, Google, Google Drive. That's what I was working in right now.

Matthias Miller  1:56:01
Um, but as far as contact info and all that kind of stuff, I would

Unknown Speaker  1:56:06
put that in there, yeah, knock yourself out. That's great,

Speaker 1  1:56:10
right? No, it's good. Matt, um, okay, well, let's we'll discuss a little bit more. I That's great. Matt, um, I

Speaker 6  1:56:24
have one other question. This is like, totally I'm gonna go down another rabbit hole. But did George reach out to you about his issue that he had yesterday when he went to print that it was a PDF render fail. Did he tell you

Matthias Miller  1:56:40
about that I have been seeing. He did not tell me about that. I saw that we recovered a number of times from those.

Speaker 6  1:56:50
Now he was able to do another thing at the top. Like, I can't think of what the words are, but once he clicked into that, it kind of like reset, like it was another list, like, for his cut list, like he has several different ones, I guess, for different machines like the Keystone or the brewer or whatever, he clicked into another one and then it reset. Because I had him restart his computer. We tried everything, and once he clicked into that other file, then he went back and it was it allowed him to open it up again in print.

Matthias Miller  1:57:22
So the backstory is that the platform that we're using has a has PDF generation that is not, let's just say, is not top of the line, PDF generation, it works, but it's not the highest grade. There are plans on the platform side to upgrade that, but it's it's a fairly big investment, and it's just a matter of prioritization, until it happens. So it's been on the radar. Might happen in the next, next year or two, if he has a rendering error, the first thing to try is refresh the page, generate a different PDF, try that, you know, I don't know, up to maybe half a dozen times I don't know, and but If, if you're still having trouble, then we can reset some things on our end. And if it's non urgent, shoot me an email. If it's hair on fire, we gotta get this stuff out, then give me a text or a call and let's get it figured

Speaker 6  1:58:37
out. Well, you know how it is. It's always timing, you know, and that's what he was trying to get them done and printed so he could get under the guide. You know, it's just how it is, but it worked then.

Matthias Miller  1:58:47
So, and we have, we have hunted, we have tried to figure out what's going on. We have, like, it's been a big rabbit hole to try to solve this thing. And I don't know there's one of those. I wish you had a better answer, but I don't. So that's

Speaker 6  1:59:05
okay. Well, at least we kind of what to do, and if it, if it keeps being an issue, then obviously we'll have to figure something out. But, yeah, cool, yeah. Well, I'll let him know that.

Speaker 1  1:59:16
So, So Matt, we should, I mean, you have a little bit, yeah, you have a minute or how long yet?

Matthias Miller  1:59:24
I should probably duck out in about 10 minutes or so.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:27
Well again, you have five, five minutes yet,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:30
as long as I can get to

Speaker 9  1:59:31
Georgetown by 1215,

Speaker 1  1:59:35
Oh, okay. Well, then so my next other thing is, then I know John is trying to clean up everything since June 26 so if, if we, if Amanda, would focus and myself focus on the old stuff. Uh, where are we

Matthias Miller  1:59:57
go to the assembly tracker. Click the title. On the on the title of the assembly tracker,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:04
yes,

Matthias Miller  2:00:06
like show historical work orders.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:10
Show historical work orders. See that some

Speaker 2  2:00:14
are you with? I'm just writing it down, yep. And

Unknown Speaker  2:00:17
then hit continue. I

Speaker 1  2:00:23
now they're gonna Okay. They're gonna see back to January 24 and that's historical sage orders as well. Is that? Is that right? Matt, I missed that. Sorry. Is that historical sage orders as well?

Unknown Speaker  2:00:44
Yes, yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:48
there's here. You can see there's 4478 since January 1, 2024,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:58
Matt um,

Speaker 1  2:01:03
sorry, remind me, there was about 8000 and you said ballpark, 4000 were reconciled automatically, yep. And are those not in this order?

Matthias Miller  2:01:17
No, they're not. They're not. They won't show on this list, because they were reconciled, right?

Speaker 1  2:01:24
So what we have here is a whole bunch of ones that have quantities don't match. Well, they were never they were never filled out.

Matthias Miller  2:01:34
So for some of them in early January, you're just not going to have the history, and you can just

Unknown Speaker  2:01:41
ignore them. Of last year

Matthias Miller  2:01:43
of 24 January, 24 we might not, if they got December or something like that, we might not, do we,

Speaker 1  2:01:53
oh, man, why again? Did we say we want to go back here and tie out the siege orders?

Matthias Miller  2:01:59
You get more accurate per employee,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:02
right information, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:02:41
I mean, realistically, you can't you

Speaker 1  2:02:45
still there, yep, still here. Yeah, sorry.

Matthias Miller  2:02:50
Realistically, you can't use historical information because the quantities are all bogus, like you don't know if it's sides or ends or anything like that. So the only way that you can make use of this is if you, if you tie it out,

Speaker 1  2:03:06
right, right, right. And here you have a bunch of flags, which is that the ones where, like,

Matthias Miller  2:03:19
yeah, the flags would be if you want to, if you filter it down even more, you could click the box to only show work orders with warnings, and that should show you all the historical like part one might be, go pick an item code and go clean up all of the sales orders with

Speaker 1  2:03:37
warnings, which, that's what we're Are you Still on screen?

Matthias Miller  2:03:40
Share, you. You killed your screen. Share, oh, my

Speaker 1  2:03:43
thoughts on Oh, I know something changed, but come on, come on. It was a glitch in our internet service, which is,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:56
everybody went to lunch. They're all using it.

Speaker 1  2:03:59
Are they on it? I don't know. I don't think it the public access that's true. Well, I don't know. Maybe they do, um sorry, um Yeah, Matt, like, that's what I just did here. Burger. Oh, two. And then you said,

Matthias Miller  2:04:12
if you go up to the to the title again, yeah, tracker and click, only show work orders with warnings. They continue. Seems to me like the first step would be, let's go clean these guys up.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:32
Clean up the work orders first,

Matthias Miller  2:04:36
and figure out what in the world's going on with them. Yeah.

Speaker 6  2:04:42
Now what's gonna happen with well, they're not us who don't work here anymore, like is

Unknown Speaker  2:04:46
that it's fine. It's

Unknown Speaker  2:04:49
not gonna change anything.

Speaker 1  2:04:50
No, we still need to track it accurately so that there's another people's doesn't okay. They don't get credit for what somebody else didn't somebody else don't get credit for what they did. Yada yada. Gotcha. That's one way look at it. Yeah, we just have to go back here through time and try to reconciliation like, here's all the ones that aren't fulfilled, and here's all the ones Matthias, is there any way to is it terrible, but to know they the quantities that were never assigned and the quantities that were never fulfilled, like, total, we can't just, like, mesh it together and be like, Oh, weren't I off by 50? That's not fair.

Matthias Miller  2:05:47
Well, okay, so and again, you could do this granularly, like you could say, let's look across a this five month period. And we are month, five, months, 612, whatever, two year, not two year, but this period. What's the total ordered? What's the total assembled? Is it close enough? All right, let's, let's, let's lump all of that together. What you do lose then is that gives you a baseline. Then to say, well, this is about how long it takes to build this thing. It doesn't allow you to get more granular to say, well, back in 2024 this guy, he's not with us anymore, and he was twice as slow as anybody else that comes down. So not enough.

Speaker 1  2:06:35
Yeah, I I'm just wondering how we can do this without spending days and days. Yeah, that's a lot. Um, yeah.

Matthias Miller  2:06:42
Lot. Well, I think one, I don't know how to answer that question. I think part of the question is,

Matthias Miller  2:06:57
I almost think you have to start you have to pick a place to start, lean in and see if you can spot the pattern, yeah. And then if you can spot the pattern, then we can find ways to speed it up. Yeah. Right now, there is no pattern in this. I mean, what I've and that's, that's how I've historically, when you've got a big mess like that, that's how you have to approach it. Like the 4000 that we did was because we knew there was a pattern that these items get completed within seven days prior, seven or five business days prior to the due date. All right, simple pattern, boom, half of them are gone. All right, next. And so then you just got to go through the mess and see, see what other pattern that you can find. Maybe there's another pattern. We can get another 1000 of them cleaned up, because this is all basically the same thing.

Speaker 1  2:07:55
Yep, that's the that's the question. Yeah, that's good. Okay, we'll look for that. Matt, All right,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:05
sounds good. That's

Unknown Speaker  2:08:07
the question for today. 912, 25, All right, thanks a lot, man, yeah.

Speaker 8  2:08:14
Amanda, no, I'm good. Well,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:17
just again, but we need to. We'll see what we can come up with. Yeah. We need to.

Matthias Miller  2:08:21
Yeah, good. Sounds good. Merv, I am, I am, how I am helping a client get ready for an expo the week of the 22nd Well, me and the client are both getting ready for an expo the week of the 22nd Yep. So I'm available for I will have some availability next week, here and there, I'm going to be office the 23rd through the 23rd through the 25th Okay, and probably not worth much on the 26th So, yep, just heads up. Yep, text we can and I've got some time if you need some time next week, but that's what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:07
That's great.
