Unknown Speaker  00:35
Yo, yo,

Matthias Miller  00:38
Buenos Dias, check out and make sure,

Matthias Miller  00:50
hey Mark, hey, Drew Morning.

Unknown Speaker  00:55
Morning

Matthias Miller  00:58
yellow. Yeah, you. People looked over, yeah,

Speaker 1  01:02
Matthias, we may need to do introductions again. It's been so long since,

Matthias Miller  01:09
exactly so this is Drew.

Unknown Speaker  01:16
You're Matthias, right,

Matthias Miller  01:17
that's right. We can make some connections. My mom grew up in Holmes County.

Unknown Speaker  01:31
Dude, there's a bald guy at the bottom there.

Matthias Miller  01:34
I think that's this is her colder fella.

Unknown Speaker  01:39
He's not to be trusted. Wow.

Unknown Speaker  01:46
Well, we don't know if he has a hoary head or not.

Unknown Speaker  01:51
You have to go by the beard. When

Unknown Speaker  01:57
did you get back to him?

Speaker 2  02:00
So I actually stayed Tuesday night in Charleston. Then I got in about lunchtime yesterday. Okay, I was, I was really glad I did just, just getting to Charleston. I was already like, either I'm gonna have to heavily caffeinate or quick get there.

Matthias Miller  02:31
There It is. I

Matthias Miller  02:40
Good morning, guys, thanks.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
We're trying to make so that we can hear you guys better.

Speaker 3  03:22
All right, but maybe we had some bout of silence I didn't know about.

Speaker 4  03:30
Okay, there we go, and to figure out which speaker was using and which volume was set for which speaker.

Matthias Miller  03:36
Like the prank when you go to a coffee shop and tell them, anytime they say something, you tell them, Don't talk to me before I have my coffee. Mm, coffee morning, I can help you. What do you want? Don't talk to me before I get you get my coffee. Okay, that'll be 1010, 45 don't talk to me until I have my coffee. Here's your money. Okay?

Speaker 2  03:55
All right. Reminds me. Reminds me of the sign in that Kristen I saw at a coffee shop in Bucha Vista, it said, I love you more than coffee.

Speaker 1  04:09
Just not before coffee. So Seth, how is are you settle into a new normal, or working on it, or

Speaker 3  04:19
working on it? We're we've been back here for a week now, so still working on it. This was my first week of work.

Matthias Miller  04:27
Okay, we're getting there.

Unknown Speaker  04:29
Yeah, it's good.

Speaker 1  04:31
How was your you were going for your honeymoon? Was what like a week, week and a half, just

Speaker 3  04:37
over a week. And then it took a bit to drive back to Kansas and then unpacking in Kansas. No,

Speaker 1  04:45
what was your, your, your route that you took? But what areas Did you travel?

Speaker 3  04:52
Um, for, well, for honeymoon, we were in eastern New York and Vermont and then so we had eight. Hours back from Vermont, and then the next day, we drove to St Louis, and then from there, we drove to Kansas. So I needed to do the math as to how far we traveled in those three days, but it was far from zero.

Speaker 1  05:16
Yeah. Did you go to where you had late? Is it Lake Champlain in New York or in Vermont? You were? No,

Speaker 3  05:26
we were just in the southern part, like Wilmington area, that's close to Green Mountain National Forest.

Unknown Speaker  05:39
Did you go all the way out to the coast.

Speaker 3  05:44
Yeah, we're the south western third or so.

Speaker 1  05:48
Vermont doesn't even Vermont touch the coast.

Speaker 3  05:52
I'm just looking on maps now. It doesn't, no, yeah, I drew,

Speaker 1  05:58
I don't think you were here yet yesterday morning, but when Larry, Larry treyer Just got back from his he retired, and then he went west for four or five weeks, I think six weeks, and they drove all the way out to big Rockies. So instead, they travel 9200 miles. No, 10, 10,000 miles? Yeah, wow.

Speaker 4  06:30
There's a family that I know from Western Ohio that they them and her parents took motor homes up to Alaska, and they're just on their way back now. But when you're have a motor home for like, two days of travel with no service, I mean, I don't trust motor homes that far, but

Unknown Speaker  07:00
ask Matthias

Matthias Miller  07:04
several years ago, that's an unforgettable memory.

Speaker 1  07:08
Where did it break down like you were going south, south

Matthias Miller  07:11
side of Indianapolis on the interstate and spent the next three hours calling for a tow truck, and tow trucks to haul motor homes aren't aren't cheap, not easy to come by. Well, finally, the guy should finally be fined one like side of town, like 3045, minutes out. So he comes, picks us up, and the first thing he says, he's like, Well, can't let anybody ride with us. And we put on our fleeting, sad puppy dog eyes, and he's like, Fine, like, just crawl in the back, like we're all the guy was up front the bachelor to see people of the kids, and he was was in the back with all the others. And we piled in there, and, goodness, borrowed a van from from friends in Goshen and packed up and went the rest of the way, like, literally, a good I mean, we were debating whether we wait for it to get fixed or whatever, but they ordered the wrong part. They whatever. So it literally got done, like a day or two before we got back to pick it, pick it up again. So,

Speaker 1  08:24
yeah, yeah, but you were, it was probably originally built right in the area where it broke down. So you should have been able to, that's true. If there's anywhere they could

Matthias Miller  08:36
have fixed it. Exactly, exactly, i

Speaker 1  08:43
Good, well, should we jump into the agenda? I think there's, I know there's a lot of stuff that I think you guys are waiting on answers from us, and there's some new stuff that we have. So,

Speaker 4  08:59
yeah, when Seth goes on vacation, my riches really piles up.

Matthias Miller  09:06
Good way to feel needed.

Unknown Speaker  09:11
Yeah, coming back, I feel almost too needed between all the different ones that need me. Apparently,

Matthias Miller  09:20
the Old Testament instruction was not to go go to war within the first, you know, the first year of getting married. So hopefully this doesn't feel like war.

Speaker 1  09:30
So how does that translate in real life, or in into not in today's do any cultures practice that, or how do they

Matthias Miller  09:45
I had been I was

Speaker 3  09:47
just gonna say, I'm trying to not take on responsibilities I didn't have before this year. Keep it basically the same for this year, and then after that, we can start taking on other responsibilities, not necessarily work as much. Just for, I think, more church and

Matthias Miller  10:04
other places,

Unknown Speaker  10:09
that's commendable. You're you're using a lot more wisdom and discretion than I did.

Matthias Miller  10:17
We had mentors that highly encourage that for us, and I'm really glad we did. It's like, it's one thing, if you know, bonita worked at the thrift store a little bit the first year, or whatever, like, but keeping avoiding all commitments that keep you away from each other, because the moment kids start showing up, like life just goes crazy. I Yeah, good. So let's look

Speaker 1  10:51
at meeting schedule first. If I remember correctly, Matthias next week does not work for you. Is that correct? Oh, I

Matthias Miller  11:00
think it actually does. So,

Speaker 1  11:03
I mean, I don't that doesn't work for you, right? The 24th I'd asked about meeting with drew on something else later, you said,

Speaker 2  11:15
Oh, that particular Well, it was, it predominantly the time, and it was a Thursday,

Unknown Speaker  11:24
yeah, it

Speaker 2  11:25
conflicts with another Matthias call. A

Speaker 1  11:34
more exciting Matthias call, probably than this. At least Dwayne's got a really fun project going. So does it? Does that work for everyone? Next

Matthias Miller  11:53
the sorry, the 31st fourth or the 24th

Speaker 1  11:55
Yeah, next week, same time, yeah, okay. And then two weeks later, on eight, seven, August, 7.

Unknown Speaker  12:10
So the 24th Mark, you're saying that the 24th at 930

Speaker 1  12:15
does, yeah, we'll plan for that. And then, if the seventh works, we'll plan for that as well.

Matthias Miller  12:25
We threw this on for Yeah, 24th and yes, the seventh words, okay, good. The seventh would get us back on our that's back on our regular schedule.

Unknown Speaker  12:45
Oh, for bi weekly

Matthias Miller  12:48
first, I think it's actually first

Speaker 1  12:51
third, first, third. Okay, well, does the third be the 21st does that work for everyone as well? I

Unknown Speaker  13:08
yeah, I think that works for me.

Speaker 1  13:12
Yeah, we'll plan for those three days. It puts us well almost into September. So wait, what was

Speaker 2  13:20
that? What was that? What was you said the 21st what was the other date

Speaker 1  13:23
mark? The seventh. So we've got July. 24 August, 7, August 21 Yeah, yeah, good. So, and let's go to the projects here, talk through them, and then at the end, prioritize ones who know size on some of these and urgency. So let's start with the not to file update. I think that one's pretty straightforward. Go ahead to you have most of these. You have

Unknown Speaker  13:58
Matthias is showing we're good.

Speaker 4  14:08
So that one there, the grouping of those things works, except for the name, if you notice here under the receiving ID number for the brickholder transport and brickholder management. It says nine invoices. So it's it's doing two things, calculating the total number of invoices in the nachhi file, not just the number of invoices for that vendor. And then it's also assigning the number, like the nine invoices to vendors that only have one invoice, instead of the vendors that actually have multiple invoices. Because I don't think you can actually see in the screenshot here. I think the vendor where there's multiple invoices actually. They would be scrolled down further in this particular

Matthias Miller  15:03
incident, but

Speaker 4  15:04
it's, it's got a wrong, wrong count, and then it, it hits the wrong vendors with it,

Speaker 1  15:11
I'm saying on the mittens email that they get.

Speaker 4  15:15
No, this is this receiving ID. Is what shows up on their Bank Ledger. Oh, so, so a vendor that's getting only one invoice paid with this not to upload, it would say nine invoices for them, and they would say, well, we only have one if they say, Well, that doesn't mean anything there. That's just bogus information. And then the other thing, the second additional change there that I'd like is, since it's what they are seeing on their invoice, I'd like to switch it to our company name, following the invoice number instead of their name, because they don't want to see their own name on their own invoice, because it doesn't tell them anything, and we can still see who it is by the receiving name,

Speaker 1  16:05
like who work gang. So you're seeing on their invoice or on their

Speaker 4  16:09
budget, on their on their bank statement, it will say this one here would say nine invoices, Burke holder transport. Well, Burke holder transports looking at their own Bank Ledger that doesn't tell me. So they want to see, well, yeah, they'd want to say shed time, or they are affordable, or whatever, and it won't be able to put the whole name in. But that doesn't

Unknown Speaker  16:33
matter. So

Unknown Speaker  16:35
I can do that.

Unknown Speaker  16:37
That's That's all for that one.

Unknown Speaker  16:41
Is that a pretty small light

Unknown Speaker  16:44
that should be very fast, okay, if not, then I've really lost my touch. Well,

Speaker 4  17:00
the sales tax liability. So I went to try to reconcile this and found that when there was a change applied to a sales order that changes the sales tax on it after it's been filed, it just edits the old transaction to whatever the new thing should be, instead of leaving the old transaction in place. So therefore, when I go back now and I pull a ledger of sales tax accrued liability. It doesn't match with what I filed.

Matthias Miller  17:50
So because we're using, because we're the accounting impact is using the actual sales order liability, not the sales tax history. RG, to populate the liability is that what you're

Speaker 4  18:09
saying like the liability is using, so when I filed report, it's using the sales tax RG, type of thing, right? So like this. This is the transaction that was created when I paid shed time she paid Indiana sales tax in February. So this 358, 82, is from an invoice that got switched to tax exempt on 220 which is the day after I filed, and it is, it then became a credit on the next one, you know, on the next payment, which, that's all right, it's just a ledger. The the accounting ledger for accrued tax liability doesn't, doesn't track, um, uh,

Matthias Miller  19:08
trying to remember where this stuff gets.

Speaker 4  19:19
My thought was, maybe, you know, when we run the RG for the coming up with the report, then it would, it would send over transactions to accounting, and then just leave them there. I don't know if that's could work. And then the next time you run it, it would say, Oh, here's the change, and it sends over a new set of transactions. I don't know what the function is. I.

Matthias Miller  20:17
We could I'm

Matthias Miller  20:33
we could Have I don't know if

Matthias Miller  20:45
Is there a place you could have that money be sitting until you run sales tax on the balance sheet? I don't know what it would this is the answer is probably no, but I'm gonna ask a stupid question anyway, like if, if these rows determined sales tax liability, is there a place we can have that money sitting from revenue collected? It's, it's basically like, I

Speaker 4  21:23
so it's, it's like money for sales tax is what your account, but we haven't,

Matthias Miller  21:33
okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:36
yeah, what accrued sales tax liability is?

Matthias Miller  21:39
Well, I think that, I think the real answer is that the that, the that the sales tax liability on the original transaction needs to be, if there's any sales tax history rose, then that needs to reflect whatever is on the earliest row. And if it has no rows, it's just current liability. And then we need to create additional transactions as of these payment dates that alter sales tax liability.

Speaker 1  22:22
We that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:26
it would be, I'm not comfortable freezing, I'm not comfortable saying, I mean, that's, yes, yeah, I mean that's, that has to

Speaker 1  22:37
work. And that's, that would be the same thing that we do with actual cost applications. Would it not or very much the same, like when we have a an actual cause variance, like it leaves the original transaction, right? So am I, I mean, right now, drew that we're getting it right, and what we're needing to pay to the government. What's not matching is, if you go to look at our on the balance sheet, our crude sales tax liability number, if it says 20,000 that one, it might actually, might only be 18,000 or it's that one's

Speaker 4  23:20
right any any period that had any change made, it comes through correctly on the next payment to the government when we calculate that, but it doesn't,

Unknown Speaker  23:32
doesn't reflect it on account, right, right?

Speaker 4  23:35
That payment will no longer match the accounting for that vehicle, that original payment.

Speaker 1  23:46
So Matthias how much to make so that each line item here or RG has its own transaction or adjusting transaction. What? How much work is that you have an idea on sizes and sort of

Matthias Miller  24:06
hand wavy numbers. It's like Seth and I working together for half a day to a day.

Matthias Miller  24:20
I'm trying to think, I wish there would be 19. I just don't think there is a way to, if there's any way to simplify it. Seth, could we freeze, just freeze the sales tax amount upon invoicing invoice, basically the invoice sales tax amount. And then for each of these rows, we would use these as deltas against that. So. And then you would create transactions for each of these rows, which you know, unless they're zero. I don't

Matthias Miller  25:19
know if that would be simpler.

Matthias Miller  25:26
Anyway, we that's the implementation detail. We don't

Speaker 1  25:29
have to. As far as the priority in this, this is, is going to be one of the lower priority ones. I Yeah, I'm sure. So you can mull about it. And

Matthias Miller  25:39
I mean, I mean, just let us know. We'll figure out when we're doing it, what's the best way we should document this, though, yeah, proposal for the sales order, invoiced transaction, when calculating the sales tax liability is the earliest, earliest row in the sales tax history. RG, if present, otherwise, calculate it based on the current sales order settings. In addition, add transactions, add a sales tax, sales order, event type that is tied to the stacks, history, RG, use, The transaction and

Matthias Miller  27:43
Okay,

Speaker 4  27:44
so with this, if you think of our reports like as of a certain date, reports that we have for AB and they are and so on, would we be able to have a sales tax liability report that reads the RG and all of that as a particular date. Would that match the balance sheet, then for that particular day? Or would we have to go by like the day we run the RGS? If we run the RG on on the 17th, it would match on the 17th, but on the 15th, it might not

Matthias Miller  28:23
well, we can give you and if it solves your I don't know if you want this, but we could also give you a sales tax liability report as of a specific date that takes us into account. It seems to me like that'd be relatively easy. Do we have a sales tax liability?

Unknown Speaker  28:50
Only, only like that filing report,

Matthias Miller  28:51
but not like a balance sheet equivalent? No, no,

Unknown Speaker  28:57
you probably do want that. I mean part of,

Speaker 4  29:02
yeah, I mean, basically what I've been trying to reconcile against is just that each period that I filed matches the the amount that I paid. You know, so it's kind of a measure lifting yourself by your own bootstraps kind of thing. It's more just making sure that there aren't more transactions that sneaked in in the past, that's kind of only thing I have to go by.

Matthias Miller  29:34
Seth, how much so for the sales tax liability report? Seth, I'm assuming we use the subset that we already use to see whether sales orders are within the sales tax world, or whatever that is, and then we calculate, like how much work to look at sales tax the strategy. Rows up until a specific date and

Matthias Miller  30:10
calculate the taxable. Just be looking at calculating the

Matthias Miller  30:22
the taxable subtitle adjustment up until that point, and then using the rate of the latest row, you

Unknown Speaker  30:47
and then based out the payment date.

Matthias Miller  30:49
Yeah, you payment date, you know, Filter, Filter Rows based on payment dates up through the as update, find the the the sum of the total adjustments for those rows. Use, use the most recent row, up until the payment date to calculate the rate. And that would be your that would be your liability, your contributing liability. But then you need to come account for, yeah, Drew. Here's the problem, accounting for payments,

Unknown Speaker  31:31
because we don't put payments on that. RG, right,

Matthias Miller  31:33
right. We're not tying these back back together. I

Speaker 1  31:44
uh, but no, even if we'll always be looking at it the last day of the month, like, because the balance sheet says 20,000 like, Okay, what? What are those 20,000 like, how do we break it down? Just like, er, like, Yeah, but yeah, well, that no, but

Speaker 4  32:07
that should work, because that should be fine, because the balance sheet should always say whatever has accrued that month. You know, theoretically, if on June 30, the report says, Hey, this is what our account should be. That should be what your next payment is going to be, and so you're not you

Speaker 4  32:43
this, this report should probably more be a beginning and ending date, right then it should be a as of date, like looking at a little bit more like an income statement kind of thing.

Matthias Miller  32:58
Why would, why would this be like just based on a period end date.

Speaker 4  33:07
Um, because I might want to throw a couple periods together, you know, I might want to say sure, this year so far, are we on, are we tracking?

Matthias Miller  33:16
We could have a starting period and ending period, period, end date range, yeah. And then it's just a matter of for each row, subtle adjustment times rate. Sum it all together. And if the sales order has any net balance plus or minus zero, you show in the report,

Speaker 4  33:37
right, right? And then, if I'm doing five periods, I can subtract out the amount of payments that I did make during those periods and see If we come out to where we should be. You.

Matthias Miller  34:05
Okay, but then this is I'm questioning now my we should not be using payment date for the transactions. We should be using the period end date for these transactions from from the prior conversation I was missing that uh, RGS period and data as the transaction date.

Speaker 4  34:29
Yeah, you're not, we're not trying to get an as of any particular day report.

Matthias Miller  34:35
What I'm saying is back when we're when we are, in order to to make the balance sheet work. Then on the 10th, we should increase sales tax liability by a certain amount, and then on the 20, and then on the 31st we'll look at it again. But of course, it won't have changed ever. It should. Food. And then on the 28th we'll say, Oh no, we that's wrong. And we'll create an adjustment, General Ledger entry on the 28th to adjust,

Unknown Speaker  35:14
yeah.

Matthias Miller  35:16
And then the payment date is when you zero it out zero. I mean whatever you but it'd be irrelevant for the report I wrote. Well, irrelevant for the report and irrelevant for accounting impact for the balance sheet,

Unknown Speaker  35:28
right, right.

Matthias Miller  35:33
So this one is max, a couple of hours obsessed time in, in the flow and and coming back, it's like two days.

Speaker 1  35:49
Matthias, could you in the Status summary? Just just add in the amount of time you think this project takes? We've started doing that with Josh, just to kind of so we can look at the report you're

Unknown Speaker  36:01
saying there,

Unknown Speaker  36:05
up at the top in the right, but I want to put

Matthias Miller  36:07
it down in here, because there's two parts to it, yeah,

Matthias Miller  36:17
and it's that seem reasonable. It just doesn't, I mean, I don't think it'll be whatever, yeah. I mean, this is, I don't know, how do you want it for? Well, what

Speaker 1  36:29
we usually just do a day, or, if we want to keep the same format, we're just using this. I mean, we're just the status summary above the assignee. We're just putting it in there. It's not, you know, it's not the right place, but yeah, we just do like, one day, three, day, whatever. So, yeah, it is. Helps us when we're looking at it, to say, to get an idea,

Matthias Miller  36:54
sure. Good. Understood, good. All Right, Cui, seven, five, okay.

Matthias Miller  37:23
Getting subcontractor reports. Do you

Speaker 4  37:35
when we file an audit, an insurance audit, then we need to know who we have certificates of insurance for who we don't. So this is just to make a report, basically a pace, to store these on the vendor record, and then field the end the expiration date, and then we have a report that shows us the expiration date for that vendor. And now we can see, oh, this one, this one here is expired. This one here is good. This one here, we have nothing.

Matthias Miller  38:13
Okay, so we're just storing these as attachments or something, right now,

Speaker 4  38:16
right? It would just be stored as an attachment, but we just have a field like, I'm guessing something like the tax ID number or whatever. It would just be the COI expiration date, and if that's filled in, you know, we know we got it, and if it's not fill in, we assume that we don't have it.

Matthias Miller  38:36
And then you're using I'm assuming that you're looking at. If you didn't pay a vendor during the audit period, you can ignore them, right,

Speaker 4  38:53
right, right. So we're pulling What did we pay these guys? And we need to report them differently if they have, if we have a certificate of insurance on hand for them, or if we don't, sure, you know, like we need to cover them, if we don't have their certificate of insurance saying they are covered. So the transactions by contact report is just simply that report where it lists, you know, you can select which accounts you want to pull out. And so I would do like the company ID, you know might be ABC or whatever, and then actually, I leave those and go to just the account, this third one down there, and type in subcontract or sub, and there's those top three, would select those three, and then whatever period it is,

Speaker 1  39:44
you know, I mean, is that rigid enough or fixed enough that that subcontract, that that could just be pre populated?

Speaker 4  39:52
Yeah, for this, we kind of, I mean, unless we always want to see more on this report, we'd make our own specific, dedicated report for this. Yes, but this is the basis. This works perfectly fine. All I need is the additional COI expiration date,

Speaker 1  40:08
because this gives you the total of of all the subcontract labor, but which we need to report to our to the insurance company for their audit. But yeah, we need to break it apart. Who, who's, who has a COI who doesn't,

Speaker 4  40:25
and so here's and in reality, for that report, all we need is the totals as well. Like, yeah, we don't need all my listings,

Matthias Miller  40:36
my proposal would actually make, make it a vendor level report prompt for company multi select of accounts using the we'll select subcontract labor and then a grouping like you mentioned. I

Matthias Miller  41:11
and then for date range as well. That's right. Thank you. Date range columns would then be vendor, name, amount paid, COI, expiration date, and then Amount Paid equals sum debit minus credit, all selected transaction line items in the range

Speaker 4  41:50
in those accounts, it was possible materials from these people which would not be valid

Matthias Miller  41:57
for this, right,

Speaker 1  42:00
right? So, right? Oh, so this would be, rather than showing all 10 transactions or 10 purchases, it would just show a sum total per vendor, right?

Matthias Miller  42:15
We could, then, if we wanted to, I

Matthias Miller  42:24
this might be overkill. Probably is overkill. You can drill into the can you drill into the vendor to see the to see their transactions.

Speaker 1  42:39
Yeah, yeah, if you go to the vendor inbox, like vendor invoices and select that battery voice,

Speaker 4  42:47
it would be nice if you could drill into that total. That would be very nice.

Speaker 1  42:51
You're saying on this report they're creating,

Speaker 4  42:55
yeah, like vendor invoices or something for that vendor. That would be fantastic,

Matthias Miller  43:04
but should be the terrible link to the Transaction Search report and just pass through date range and contact

Speaker 4  43:13
that's starting to get to the vendor, reconcile thing I

Speaker 4  43:23
maybe once Dwayne has this fun project on the go to that fun project?

Speaker 1  43:31
No, I don't think there's a capacity. She was just on the development side. If, yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:44
okay, seems Same here. We didn't really put a

Speaker 2  43:47
this is, this is always the danger when you don't completely pay attention, and you're only half paying attention, then you hear your name and and things like capacity, and suddenly I'm like, wait what

Matthias Miller  44:00
we were saying we're going to take away capacity from your project. Since he wasn't listening,

Speaker 2  44:10
we'll discuss that in the next call. Right after this, right

Matthias Miller  44:15
after this, that's why you schedule it like this. You have veto power.

Speaker 1  44:22
Well, was drank this. What is it called a Philip What does Congress call that when they just

Matthias Miller  44:28
filibustering? Yes, beating. Ran three hours late. Seth, do you have a time estimate? Two to four hours. That seems generous, but

Speaker 3  44:41
yeah, two to four, where in reality it should be too.

Unknown Speaker  44:47
That's both the feeling and the Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:49
yeah, perfect. Good

Matthias Miller  44:59
contact. Uh,

Speaker 1  45:06
I want to say that this you, at least from from my perspective, using incidents has been a huge help in moving us forward, like, I feel like we're about twice as efficient on in our communication to you want? We're looking for the other way around. So I think

Matthias Miller  45:24
yes, because everything's right there, and you guys are putting in like 80% of the like, rather than copying and pasting your notes and stuff, it's right there. Just, just beautiful.

Speaker 4  45:39
So bad debt is calculating on the sales what portion of the bad debt is sales tax being calculated on the wrong basis?

Matthias Miller  45:58
Okay, so we have tax here. So this is a bad debt method, right?

Speaker 4  46:04
Well, it's, yeah, it functions like bad debt. The same way we're saying we did not get paid for this item, we will not get paid. So therefore,

Matthias Miller  46:18
total before 4260, because you don't pay tax on bad debt,

Speaker 4  46:22
right? So it should be 4260 is the bad debt and the the 298, 20 is the is the credit to the tax. But we've, we're assuming we've paid tax on this already. Now, the problem is not that easy. When the bad debt is is $200 you know, like, when it's the whole invoice, you say, Well, yes, the subtotal of the tax, that's what it should be, and that's how it caught my attention,

Speaker 1  46:52
yeah, but okay, there's, there's a process issue here. This invoice should have been selected as tax exempt before they when they were doing this, like, right? I mean, that's how we're doing all of these donation buildings currently.

Matthias Miller  47:09
But the other thing too is that when we get to we don't process bad debt until we actually process payroll liabilities. And so what's going to happen? Cross your fingers. But should happen is, right now it shows it, there's a tax liability, and it's going to stay present until we run, like there is a sales tax light liability, until we run, do we run it? And then it's going to create an entry in the history RG, that says, right? We actually reduce the subtle adjustment and increase the bad debt amount,

Speaker 4  47:48
right, right? So there's a couple things going on. This was entered wrong. So that's what Mark was pointing out. It should never have been taxable to start with. But that's outside of this discussion. This one doesn't have sales tax history, because it's prior to the whole sales tax history RG thing. So, so that kind of creates an issue. So, but it's the one that I found the the bad debt calculation problem on because, see, you can see in the notes, instead of 298, 20, it says 319, is the tax. And what it did is it said, Okay, there's 500 and or $4,558 is our bad debt, and 7% of that is our tax credit. So it said, what's 7% of 4558 Well, that's $319 and it should say 7% this is 107% the 7% is the tax, the the 100% you know, it's our basis. Is wrong. This is a percentage, not, not the the basis, um, you see my formula in the so?

Unknown Speaker  49:22
Basis? Suspect Hill and

Speaker 4  49:26
custody. So what it's doing, it's calculating as the write off amount times the tax rate equals tax credit, and it should be the write off amount minus, well, the write off divided by the tax rate plus one, you know, equals the max pros,

Matthias Miller  49:41
but, but you can't have a bad debt more than because it affects sales tax. You can't have a bad debt right off more than subtotal. So if we just validate against that the math, if it's still math, would it? You?

Speaker 4  50:00
Yeah, except for the problem is, then when we have a $200 that we didn't get. So, so it was a $4,500 bill, $200 we never got, so we're writing it off. So it's not 7% of $200 it's $200 includes the tax. It's 107% of our basis the $200

Matthias Miller  50:35
I'm slowly catching up. Let me repeat it back to you when you have in this case, just to make it super stupid simple, if, if you have $558 of bad debt, 558 $20 of bad debt, so you got a $4,000 check, let's make it even more stupid simple. You get a $4,500 check. Part of this 5820 has to go to the subtotal, and part has to go to tax, and you have to adjust your basis such that basis plus tax equals 4500

Unknown Speaker  51:15
Right, right. Got it,

Speaker 4  51:21
and that your your basis plus tax equals the amount that you're writing off.

Matthias Miller  51:30
Yes, right? But the bad debt adjustment is the basis,

Speaker 4  51:35
right? Well, not the amount you put in your payment RG, and you say, we're writing off this $48.20 that's,

Matthias Miller  51:50
well, you're you would say you have, well here it's 58 cents. And so whatever the number is like, let's say 58 divided by 1.07 you're going to say really had 5439 less taxable sales, and 5439 more bad debt,

Speaker 4  52:14
right? And then, and then the $2 or whatever the $4 is, is a sales tax credit, though, the remaining $4 but what I'm going to write in RG is the total amount to get to zero,

Speaker 1  52:33
right? Yes, helpful to look at at. I mean, this is a donation building. If you looked at one that we had an actual ride out

Matthias Miller  52:45
so but then this should what i don't know i

Matthias Miller  52:56
Is there ever a time I

Matthias Miller  53:03
do we require this? Aha, good soaping case.

Speaker 1  53:21
So does this mean it all up until all, uh, that debt has been calculated wrong. Which, which is throwing our

Unknown Speaker  53:30
which is also enough? Yeah, our

Speaker 1  53:32
on the balance sheet, our accrued sales tax on the balance sheet, all by that,

Speaker 4  53:36
well, it is, but it's showing the amount it's it's throwing off the amount we are crediting ourselves when we get bad that we're crediting ourselves a little bit too much. So I don't know what it would do historically, you know, on the payment RG thing, but Well, what's

Matthias Miller  53:54
going to happen is we're going to create adjustments. I mean, if we get this coded by next time you run it, we're going to probably not, well, okay, then after that, the next time after that, then we'll create adjustments his for all those historical ones that we messed up. And we're going to, it's going to be right going forward, yeah, okay, great. I'm going to say it's half a day. It's counting impact. I don't think it's, it's, I don't know Seth, any argument. No, I think we need to pair program it. I don't think either of us wants to do it so.

Speaker 1  54:38
So that's what pair programming means. If it's a nasty job,

Matthias Miller  54:46
it's, it's one of two things, either it's really complicated, where it's, it's

Speaker 1  54:55
like mocking out the barn something, yes, exactly

Matthias Miller  54:58
front. This fun story with that. My my my uncle, by marriage, grew up in this had this property where they used to have the Sunday school house for the church, and then they turned into a little like calf barn or whatever, and he wrote my aunt when they were dating about mucking out the Sunday School House, which created no end of confusion and amusement all at the same time. So

Unknown Speaker  55:37
I can imagine,

Matthias Miller  55:39
okay, so bad debt, miscalculation, I like it. I'm happy with it,

Speaker 1  55:46
that first one. Let's just take a quick look at it. I think that's done, but I

Matthias Miller  56:05
so no, you think so? Well, Josh,

Matthias Miller  56:19
we're not posting to a waste account,

Speaker 1  56:25
but we won't automatically, okay. Well, am I missing something? I mean, I think okay, Seth the change you made calculates like, like the example, right? Like it does. It takes into account the Bill of Materials value, right? I think so. I don't know why the waste report there. I mean, the waste report is basically, well, okay, it might be look. Might be worth looking at. Josh created a new standard report called the waste report. Let's just take a quick look at it and make sure we're not missing something. Pick shed time and do six one to 630 and yeah. So this is basically saying, Okay, there's there's there's re as far as we know, this part is working correctly. But if you look at the the edge goal, it says we, we actually consume based on account 708 pieces. The Bill of Materials calculated 444, so that leaves the discrepancy of 264, and then we look at that $5,801 that's the per piece price times the 264 pieces. And say, Okay, Bill materials did not account for these movies. Loss. Was it bad stuff? And then we would just make a journal entry for $5,800 if we determine that that's accurate. So I don't, unless I'm missing something. This has that that wage report really shouldn't have been included in that incident, and the incident would be done. Would you agree

Matthias Miller  58:22
it's up? Sounds to me the basic impact of this is saying, Oh well, we should go adjust or DOM or bomb rules too, right?

Unknown Speaker  58:33
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  58:37
I mean, yeah, seems straight to me.

Unknown Speaker  58:40
Okay, yeah, then I think we can

Matthias Miller  58:45
close that one. Okay, boarding discrepancies program, I think that's another one. Exactly. Okay, so,

Speaker 4  59:04
well, let's, let's go. I think that. I think number one is all. I think the first part's done, okay, well, number two, so we can move this thing history. I think. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:21
okay. So, so amount owed. We did this. I'm going to say

Speaker 3  59:27
we did it and then it caused problems, so it was reverted.

Matthias Miller  59:30
So can you get our heads together? Yes, but if we're going to have unit tests for this, if that's going to be a fair bit of work, well, I don't know that we have to do unit tests, but we do have to make sure that we don't that we put in a way that

Speaker 4  59:46
works. We we created a little list there of ones that should be that are on the report currently and should be kicked out once everything is working.

Matthias Miller  59:58
Am I right that the basic. Issue is that we actually, well, okay, here's the frustrating thing. There are two kinds of balances. There are accounting balances, and there are AR balances, and you want to tell your customer that they owe money before it's invoiced. But you don't want accounting to know that they owe money until it's invoiced. And so the so amount owed, I think, I Think, basically, I

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
let's do this. I think.

Matthias Miller  1:00:58
Wow, inhale. We have accounting balance versus customer facing balance customer facing, slash

Speaker 2  1:01:23
guys, I'm going to step away for just a bit here. I'll be back in a few minutes.

Matthias Miller  1:01:32
All right, so this is pretty, pretty clear what needs to

Speaker 1  1:01:36
happen, and I can tell you that that's going to be one of the most the top priority. So is that time frame we're looking at? Don't know, until you look at

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
it, or is it, well, you can, you can have one piece of candy today. So pick your piece of candy.

Speaker 1  1:01:56
Wow, I'm gonna say this, that this, because what's happening is, it's, well, okay, let's look at to the pain it's causing. Is the the immediate pain is, we're looking at accounts receivable report, and it it shows canceled fillings on there that should not be on there, which I think that's what would what your change would have fixed, that would have reverted. But could we just look at that? Just pick one of those, and let's verify one of these invoice numbers and verify that it would kick that one out.

Matthias Miller  1:02:41
Sorry, sales orders, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:02:46
accounts receivable. I mean, if you go to the accounts receivable report, is what the not that

Matthias Miller  1:02:54
this one, no, you were right. You were right. Or this one, okay, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:02:58
Oh, and while we're at it, this want to Well, okay, let's look at this first, and then another question on that. So, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:03:10
this is canceled as of 11 nine, so

Unknown Speaker  1:03:14
there's no payment on it, as

Speaker 4  1:03:19
if you go on down further online or net zero. So nothing to owe the customer back, nothing else.

Speaker 1  1:03:29
So what's confusing is, if whoever's responsible for a company's AR is looking at this and they try to collect which they wouldn't benefit, like try to collect this $4,000 from the forum only if they're not you're saying it would kick this one out.

Matthias Miller  1:03:47
Yes, perfect.

Speaker 1  1:03:51
Um, go back to the prompts on this report. Maybe this is something we just throw in here. But do I Okay? So, you have in tight, you can select district X or SDI or blank. Blank does not, I don't think it gives you anything. It just gives you one, one set of them, yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
definitely blank be all

Speaker 1  1:04:15
well, either that or I don't think we even need that prompt. We just throw everything together because we can, we can sort by vendor. So everyone is just, if you want to see sheds, right?

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
I mean, you pick, it's easy to make it work the way that it should.

Speaker 1  1:04:34
Well, okay, we're everything. We're moving, rather than having, like, all sheds, right, act like a special thing, like legacy sales orders are special. We're just kind of saying, Okay, that's all part of this, part of our customer side. I would vote for this, unless you see a reason to not to to just,

Speaker 4  1:04:54
I mean, the only thing I can think of would be if, historically, we have them, have them split, and then we're trying. To say, Okay, what was the change in this particular one? When can

Matthias Miller  1:05:07
we is there? Is there another field, like a dealer or a

Speaker 1  1:05:12
yeah, there is, if you select your on the report, you can already select by dealer.

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
Oh, so why would you just do,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:28
if you need to pull that links, why is what you're saying?

Speaker 1  1:05:31
Yeah, take type away. Or, I think it's called type, yeah, yeah. I've

Matthias Miller  1:05:39
always found it confusing. And then we can merge the menu items too. Yeah, it's Yes, sounds

Speaker 1  1:05:47
good. I mean, I'm assuming that's an easy thing. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:52
really easy. I guess

Matthias Miller  1:05:56
maybe we could do that up however we want to. Okay, good. Seth, let's, let's get our heads together after, I don't know when I'm available this afternoon, I have a little bit of time.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
Let's skip that one for right now.

Matthias Miller  1:06:20
Okay, AP is the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
Yeah. AP is the other one.

Matthias Miller  1:06:28
620, entry below

Unknown Speaker  1:06:30
that's down a little ways this guy, yeah, and so some of it. Let's see. Well, to break it down, the report is not respecting

Speaker 4  1:06:48
dates on credit memos that are unused. So once the credit memo is used, it seems respected, okay. But when it's not used, it doesn't respect that start date. So if credit memo has a date of, you know, 413 it will show up indefinitely into history as on the report, even before 413 so that's my last issue that I've

Matthias Miller  1:07:15
found in this custom report here,

Speaker 4  1:07:19
unless there had been a new one at some point. I don't know if this is the one or not.

Matthias Miller  1:07:25
This is why we live. It would

Unknown Speaker  1:07:28
probably be further in the notes.

Matthias Miller  1:07:32
Let's see. So this is the aging let's look for aging, undeposited payments, aging payables. Agent b2, I oops,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:45
yeah, I think it has a v2 on it now,

Matthias Miller  1:07:48
aging v2 well, prior version backup, because I accidentally rewrote the v2 and I was actually trying to create a v3 but that's fun. I switched the company. Okay? So,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:04
so if you go,

Matthias Miller  1:08:08
do you have a,

Speaker 4  1:08:10
yeah, go down. But is it negative? So, like, I think, what date are we as of here?

Matthias Miller  1:08:22
I 1234,

Speaker 4  1:08:25
do like, make it current, okay, like 630 or something. Was it affordable? What was it? Another car? Affordable? So,

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
I think you were looking at it.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
Was it vinyl? No, it was, was

Matthias Miller  1:08:47
it for 630 like, Let's drive 630 and see if it was finals of 630 there's, like, four here's this guy.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
Yeah, no.

Speaker 1  1:08:57
But it was, like, a lot of 60, $70 ones, right? I think it was another company, because I

Speaker 4  1:09:03
think we were looking at Vinyl 30. There's probably some in both.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09
Yeah, there they are, the bed for regional

Matthias Miller  1:09:11
water, bed for regional ones, yeah. So these are the date is, five, seven,

Speaker 4  1:09:22
right? So, okay, so pull like a 331 report now, and they'll still be on those same ones.

Matthias Miller  1:09:34
Okay, so let's go here.

Matthias Miller  1:09:41
Vi credit memo, num, IDs, credit memo, date, a, oh, well, maybe we should i.

Matthias Miller  1:10:08
Invoice date is greater than mint date. Bi balance, oh, the credit note balance, because the vendor invoice balance

Matthias Miller  1:10:30
I'm but The credit memo balance does not

Matthias Miller  1:10:50
credit amount remaining.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:11:06
We have that cell. Well, this is a little bit more complicated, because

Matthias Miller  1:11:16
it's uh,

Matthias Miller  1:11:30
if it's applied to i

Matthias Miller  1:11:49
Our total amount is almost, I should almost defer this, but it's so close, it's crazy. Credit memo date is greater than or equal to this, then it's this. Else It's Na and then, if

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
not a date,

Matthias Miller  1:12:14
sorry, thank you. Some field where we don't, we can't do it there, if let's just do this and assist. Date is greater than or equal to, yes, update and and

Matthias Miller  1:12:39
memo the invoice payment date,

Matthias Miller  1:12:48
her credit memo is applied to invoice. Good,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
yeah, the greater than the as of date, or less than the sorry, yes. And same with all the others.

Matthias Miller  1:13:07
Wow. Okay, so if correct, okay, if the credit memo date, deposit date, and if the the payment date would be the date that the credit minimum was applied to the vendor invoice, right? That's

Speaker 4  1:13:22
the vendor invoice, right? So when it when it gets you're saying, like, when the credit is used up? Yes, yeah. So when the credit is used up, it already jumps off the report. The problem is, if it's not you, well, it doesn't respect date, though. So, right,

Matthias Miller  1:13:42
the question is, do you want it to drop off the report as of the invoice date? Or do you want it to drop off as of the invoice payment date? Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:13:53
yeah, it should drop off the date that it gets applied as a payment So, generally, I apply the payment from the credit memo the same time as I pay, make the payment on the remaining part portion on that invoice. So I would go by the payment date, not the date of that invoice, Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:14:21
And then this should be, ask, not

Matthias Miller  1:14:28
necessarily.

Matthias Miller  1:14:42
I Sure, let's go ahead and save it be. Because we're feeling wild and free. Um, well, that looks fun. Let's go back to 630

Matthias Miller  1:15:15
so they're here. Give one cent remaining. And then, but then, if we go back to five, so five six, we should see them all disappear. Yeah, five seven, they'll show up again. Whether right, they're there, and then usage, whatever report that shows where they were used.

Matthias Miller  1:15:57
Maybe they weren't,

Speaker 4  1:15:58
yeah, that would be kind of nice to have a link from the credit memo to where it got used, but, I mean, if you have a link to where it comes from or comes from, but not to where it got used, that's not necessary for now.

Matthias Miller  1:16:15
Okay, so I think the i

Matthias Miller  1:16:25
Okay, let's go take this up to here, because this is all

Unknown Speaker  1:16:31
number four.

Matthias Miller  1:16:32
Yeah, number four. Let's try to kind of sort of keep them together. Okay, so I think oops. Drew Do you want to review this one more time?

Speaker 4  1:16:45
Yeah, I'm gonna go over it again.

Speaker 1  1:16:48
Guys, how do you move that? How did you camp those left right? Like,

Matthias Miller  1:16:52
control left bracket, square bracket and control right square bracket,

Speaker 1  1:16:59
say, control left bracket, move on the left,

Matthias Miller  1:17:02
yep. And then control like like this down. Okay, so there's that one, yes, okay, so then that takes us down to the undeposited funds.

Speaker 1  1:17:15
But on this one we have a user report, right? And then once view says, Good, then it will turn it into a standard report. But from a functionality standpoint,

Matthias Miller  1:17:26
we have, it's all done Correct. Theoretically, if you trust my wild coding,

Speaker 1  1:17:36
what should I say? There's not, I couldn't improve on it or even try.

Matthias Miller  1:17:44
No standard, no basis for standing.

Speaker 1  1:17:48
Fair enough, I think that's all we we want to look at in here, right now, right there's there's later. We need to come back. But yeah, so the retrievals better handling for retrieved buildings. Okay, can we move this to top priority, knowing what I know now, I think this should be like a number two priority, right after that AR thing. But what does it this is a combination of you and Josh working on, okay, the reason we want to move this up is we think that this is these retrievals are creating a mess on our finished goods and try we need to do this first and clean up those retrievals properly before we try to even do an audit of our finished goods inventory or with the balance sheet. Is why we want to move this up. So I

Matthias Miller  1:18:44
this is just no it's for code crafters to replicate the business process of entering repurchase retrievals and purchase buildings. So I think, I mean, I think basically what we need to do is have a way to, I mean, this goes back way back to our discussion a long time ago to say, this is not a manufactured building. This is a this is a purchase. I don't know purchase. I mean, it's a retailing it for, I don't know what you call it. There's got to be a good term for it. So,

Speaker 1  1:19:19
yeah, I thought somewhere we had all kinds of notes on details on this. Maybe,

Matthias Miller  1:19:28
I think, I think we do, from me to mark greenhouse seems like the key

Unknown Speaker  1:19:37
keyword. I think those would would also

Matthias Miller  1:19:42
design for handling retrievals. Yes, I have it here. Oh, okay, here, let me

Speaker 1  1:19:47
I think we can go two routes. One is we can, I mean, Drew, and I can work through. We're doing some of these retrievals manually with what we have. And just kind of write out the steps and then start from that, or we can start,

Matthias Miller  1:20:11
isn't your source account going to be different for these?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:16
Yeah, yes.

Speaker 4  1:20:22
Well, the problem, one of the problems that we have noticed that we are not addressing, is the call the building built, and building invoiced transactions connected to the buildings. When we do retrievals and we disconnect them from the invoice. We go stomp right over the old building, build and building invoiced college transactions,

Matthias Miller  1:20:48
right, which Josh, but if we have a secondary stin, then the manufactured building is going to exist. Then we'll have another building record for the purchase of finished good, which makes it all go away. Yeah, right, so I think what I would propose, oh, gracious, you guys have impeccable timing. Um, the as well. Yes, close.

Matthias Miller  1:21:28
I will simply have to see. I mean, that's the only

Speaker 1  1:21:34
do you feel like you have like Do you have the information you need to start or not. I mean, is it so? I think we could. The other thing we could do is, as Drew and I work through several of these, and can clean them up. We could in great detail. We could basically write out what we did to correct them, and then next week, in our meeting, we could look at that and and start from there. I, personally, I would be more comfortable with that approach than taking these notes from six months ago just because I think there's things we may not have

Matthias Miller  1:22:27
thought or covered,

Speaker 3  1:22:33
I think Josh will want to be involved in design as well, or at least, yeah, remember he was getting concerned Last time that this was going to add too much complexity, depending how we do it.

Matthias Miller  1:22:46
I think, I think it dramatically simplifies. I think the basic design I'm leaning towards is something along the lines of, well, we actually have to stop but simplified design is something like type on building record which is manufactured or purchased, a purchase of finished good, if the latter, either if the latter purchase price, and Then update, update accounting impact accordingly, and or the

Matthias Miller  1:23:40
is. But if, if the original orders, if everything stays linked together, we just need to handle the new building, and we need to be able to say this new building was purchased, and maybe it needs to be tied out to a I don't even know,

Matthias Miller  1:24:01
right? I'm fine with that. If you're fine with that,

Speaker 4  1:24:06
forward this email, maybe to me or mark or something again, just so we for sure, don't lose the data that we already put together

Matthias Miller  1:24:14
or Well, I think this is, I don't think much of this is relevant, actually, because this is before we were considering to use multiple stints. I think this line here literally is the most valuable I can

Speaker 1  1:24:32
so what you're saying is is keep the original skin, invoice number, everything completely intact, and we just create like a secondary building. It

Matthias Miller  1:24:44
is a secondary building, and there's a link between the two. It's called the secondary Sten. Why I think it is, but I'm not. I'm not. I need to understand from Josh how he's planning to handle it. My My thought was we would have a separate building record with the secondary stin that links back to the original building. So. Can search for one and see, see them all, see all the related buildings, but each building is its own entity then, and each one has its own price. But I might be misunderstanding where he was going with it.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:14
It sounds to me like that should work.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
So do we need to? How do we proceed from

Matthias Miller  1:25:20
here, I should see if I can get on Josh's calendar for Monday and see if I can have him explain to me what.

Speaker 1  1:25:36
What about see at this point you have, there's nothing you need from us, or is there? Well, it

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
sounds to me like you're planning to do this process manually.

Speaker 1  1:25:48
Well, we Yes, but I guess if it's if this is something that's going to happen in the next little bit, then we'll just hold off. I think until then, because the manual process is,

Speaker 4  1:26:04
yeah, I'm afraid there's some things in the manual process that we might have to do manually anyway, because of removed records at this point, you know, like we figure out how to recreate the original and building Bill transactions and stuff like that for some of those.

Speaker 1  1:26:26
So Matthias with this proposal, What? What? What are you thinking time frame like assuming,

Matthias Miller  1:26:32
I don't know. I need to talk to Josh and find out how he keeps implementing it, and then I

Speaker 1  1:26:36
can give you an answer. But we're less than a month. I'm assuming, like, it's, yes, it's

Matthias Miller  1:26:41
less than a month. I mean, I'm hoping that this takes us down to Okay. The optimistic side of me is like, well, this is going to be, I think really what it is is going to be the first round of implementation is going to be about two, two days, and it's another week of Seth's time to go chase all the edge cases. I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:27:02
Well then, okay, hearing this, I think drew we just hold off. What do you think? We hold off until we have development for this, and then we start chasing this? Yeah, with the old buildings, we'll have a lot to test with. So good. Well, we're almost at 11, so I'd say we have to, we need to wrap this up, the mismatch transactions that can wait till next, yeah, next week. So as far as priority, if we would, I'm not sure all that, but it does. So the the AR thing would be number one, the retrievals would be the second priority, and then beyond that, like that, the notch of file updates.

Speaker 1  1:27:56
Those are all, oh four, the top four on the list here, I think you're all a day, or less than a day. So, so is there one? Okay? Three. We don't need four. Okay, I think just doing them and yeah, do that in the order of

Matthias Miller  1:28:14
their list. Can you true? Would you be willing? I mean, sorry, Mark, would you be willing to take five to 10 minutes after the call, and just put this back together again with the updated priority

Speaker 1  1:28:27
I can unless there's a way to unless there's a way to prioritize them on the projects, that would be really nice. Actually, we did okay with the naming, not that might not be the cues, maybe like 13, three, nine.

Speaker 1  1:28:55
That's what we did with the the items out of the dev priorities. But so please forget that. What if I would just put them into maybe do well, I guess what? What works for you? Yeah, I'm happy with do whatever makes sense for you.

Matthias Miller  1:29:18
I think that's fine. I don't really care how it happens. We have the

Unknown Speaker  1:29:26
have the

Matthias Miller  1:29:29
very high, high and medium.

Speaker 1  1:29:34
I think these are all one of those two. I think if the retrievals and the AR thing are very high, and the others are in high. And I can just shuffle them around to wonder what place them in the order that we want them is that that's fine.

Matthias Miller  1:29:54
Aaron retrievals and then COI, we don't i.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:00
There actually.

Matthias Miller  1:30:07
The main thing I want to know is, are also things for said that I'd get our heads together on,

Speaker 4  1:30:14
yeah, just do whichever one first you can get done the fastest at

Unknown Speaker  1:30:20
that first, all you need from the top

Speaker 4  1:30:22
floor. Then, yeah, like the ones that they want to work on together.

Matthias Miller  1:30:26
Oh yeah. Alright. Well, we will okay for, for our priority, for for Seth and I working together, we're going to prioritize retrievals, probably after that, the bad debt miscalculation, and then the sales tax liability. And then says, you can just knock out these. These other ones should be pretty straightforward, one, one and three, and we're going to do the, sorry, the AR, one, AR one, first error retrievals, bad debt and then sales tax. Okay, good,

Speaker 1  1:31:13
okay. Well, this has been good. We covered a lot, and excited for the do you know if Josh is doing an update this weekend or not.

Speaker 1  1:31:26
I think he's at the Air Show in Oshkosh. You said for three, three days out of the year, that's the busiest airport in the world.

Matthias Miller  1:31:40
Wow. I used to always be jealous of them as kids, they always went to go see like the Blue Angels in Wichita. How cool is that? Anyway? Cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:57
Thank you. Thanks, guys. Yeah.
