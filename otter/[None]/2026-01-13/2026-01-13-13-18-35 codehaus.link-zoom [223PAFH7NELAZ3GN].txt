Unknown Speaker  01:07
Thanks, see ya. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:09
Mike, hey, yes, sir,

Unknown Speaker  01:11
alright, good deal, alright. Got got that if we need it. Yes, sir,

Speaker 1  01:20
okay, how you man, good. How are you good?

Unknown Speaker  01:25
How's family? Family's good.

Matthias Miller  01:27
Bonita had an appointment with Adrian this morning, so I've been covering for that. But yeah, family's doing good.

Speaker 2  01:36
You, yeah? Hey, can I? I'm little side John and Ruth, we went. We were with him Sunday, um, Dawson, gosh, I can tell you that, did you know John or Ruth pretty well or,

Matthias Miller  01:52
I mean, ish. I mean, we weren't super, super close. We were back and forth because we were both foster parents,

Speaker 2  01:59
yeah, well, um, it seems like it seemed like he's still, he's really struggling with rejection. Seems like it like the spirit. I mean, that's probably was that really is that? Is that inherent for a child that is adopt or like that, that is separated from their from their biological parents at all is that sort of

Matthias Miller  02:25
very, I mean, it's impossible to the I'd probably be a little careful in how I exactly phrase it, but it's, it's impossible for for a child to be separated from their biological parent in any way without having some kind of imprint in some way, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  02:45
So, yeah. And so they're like, and then Ruth, she's like, Yeah, boy, sure, perfect. And then we'll catch up with George tomorrow. Thanks, Chip, Yep, sorry I'm one of call. Hey, you're good. Yeah, yeah. Anyway. And then I think Ruth, like she, she's trying to make up the difference. And, you know, they try to make the children feel accepted. I know they're big on that and, and I don't know how you guys do discipline, but I know they,

Unknown Speaker  03:17
they've, they've

Speaker 2  03:20
erred on the side of caution in their discipline with the children, I think so. But I could see Mom was kind of like, I mean, she's like, worn out and trying to make make sure he feels accepted and all that. But yet he's struggling. So nine years old. Well, man,

Matthias Miller  03:45
there's a, there's a foster, an adoptive mom conference in Lancaster, end of January, my wife and a bunch of ladies are going to it's called filled but I think, you know, I don't know that stuff's hard. Structure. Healthy structure can, I mean, in each kid is different, in how they respond. Healthy structure can sometimes really be anchoring, kind of give this sense of belonging. And there's a part of the world that feels safe when you have that. But every kid is different, and you

Speaker 2  04:18
guys do that, you guys are pretty, pretty Adam. I mean, I've always thought you guys were pretty strong in that structure. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  04:28
Yeah, we Yeah, and try to focus a lot on I know we're imperfect in this, but we try not to save our kids from natural consequences of their decisions. There has to be an encounter with real world hardship, sure. And yeah, so we don't do it perfectly, but we do, yeah, I think, I think somewhere, I mean, it's a, I don't know. It's attention you want nurture. You want structure. You want discipline. You went, you went, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:08
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  05:13
so there, yeah, yeah, yeah. Man, maybe think about pray for him, another, another try. And I think there's a man, because there's a well anyway,

Unknown Speaker  05:29
at a certain age, at a certain age, children

Speaker 2  05:32
just don't respond to discipline very well anymore, right? I mean, like, it

Unknown Speaker  05:39
just seemed like they have to

Unknown Speaker  05:42
discipline needs to happen at a younger age,

Unknown Speaker  05:45
yeah? Otherwise,

Speaker 2  05:50
well, here's a scenario that happened like, I think I can share this, yeah. So John bought him a BB gun for, I guess, for Christmas, and Dawson went for a walk. Was out, and I guess he was talking about shooting himself, and I guess he went for a walk, or, I don't know if that happened. I don't think it all happened the same time,

Unknown Speaker  06:19
but he left the house

Speaker 2  06:22
with the BB gun. I guess John thought the best thing to do was be let him go, and then he come back. And I guess he came back, and his comment was to his mom that dad didn't even come after me, type of thing. There's probably a whole bunch of stuff in there that

Unknown Speaker  06:46
I don't know. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:50
yeah, but

Speaker 2  06:53
nine years old talking about shooting himself like that's just crazy.

Matthias Miller  06:59
Yeah, my perspective on that has shifted a lot from, I mean, growing up that was like the unpardonable sin, and you don't even dare touch it with a lump with a 10 foot pole. And it's like, to me, it shows the I really reframe this, not as life is not worth living, but life as I'm living, it is so impossible I don't see any alternative, right? And it's a place of really deep overwhelm, and, yeah, like, there is this, yeah? So one, on one hand, it's, it's like, you gotta, you gotta give kids their freedom, but on the other hand, you got to stand between them and their

Unknown Speaker  07:53
ignorance. So makes sense?

Matthias Miller  07:59
Yeah, we, a lot of our peers, do the, I don't know what do you call it, the gentle parenting, sure, and it's all like, it's all pendulum swing from we don't want to be authoritarian, and we didn't like how, you know, the over the top ways that our parents were strict. And, yeah, or I say, I say that it's not all of them, but maybe a third of our peers are, like, way on that side, a quarter or third or something I don't know. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:38
yeah, man, discipline is Yeah, but discipline is important. I mean, I think it's super important. But yeah, obviously, there's many ways

Unknown Speaker  08:54
to sort of to

Unknown Speaker  08:58
deal with their ignorance. Ain't Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  09:05
Yeah, hey, all right, I don't.

Unknown Speaker  09:07
I don't care how far or how long we go here,

Speaker 2  09:11
if we are done by four, does that make sense for you or works for me? Tomorrow I have I may not be available before, like it may not be available yet by 730 but I should be by eight, 830 but then we have a meeting at 1230 so, like, I couldn't go till 1245 on a call. So I don't know,

Matthias Miller  09:38
what do we try do? It try for? We can try for 1030 to 12. I might not be I can text you when I'm free. I might not be quite free, quite right, yeah, it's fine. Or yeah, 1030

Unknown Speaker  09:54
1030 ish, 1040 1045 whatever. Yes, yep, yep. Okay, all right. I mean, I think,

Matthias Miller  10:14
I think there's, I started working on the the pricing breakdown, there's a bunch of pricing stuff that we're going to need. If

Matthias Miller  10:36
one question I had on the sizers, on the sawing breakdown, I was, do we have a separate rate for how are we counting the sizers? Were we counting that as a board feet being processed, or did we have a separate number for that?

Matthias Miller  11:10
Like, if it's going through the sizer and another saw, you count it being processed twice for sawing?

Unknown Speaker  11:17
Yeah, yeah. So

Speaker 3  11:21
the your, your, so your question again was,

Matthias Miller  11:29
we had talked for sawing about just using a price per board foot process. So if you run it through three three saws, it's board footage times three,

Speaker 3  11:42
right? So like one time through the sizer,

Speaker 2  11:47
sizers, one pass, notchers, two passes, yada yada,

Unknown Speaker  11:52
yeah, yep. Is

Matthias Miller  11:54
that how you want to do it? Yeah. Okay, so I'm not. I'm not handling the I'm not including the sizer in that count yet, but I'll change it to include that. Okay. And then if you want to pull up silver loom, you can, you can pull up the current pricing thing that I've got, I made some changes. So if you hit folders on the left there,

Unknown Speaker  12:28
yes, yep,

Matthias Miller  12:30
go into pricing calculator and hit the third one down items pricing and hit continue. And so the only reason we need to know quantity for the sake of pricing is so that we know how to bill for setup time. Okay, assembly setup time, but if you want to size or go find one that you want to start with,

Speaker 2  13:05
okay, is this quantity a total of what

Matthias Miller  13:10
it's set based off of average or median order size over the past year to Something like that? Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  13:18
Yeah, all right, let's see,

Unknown Speaker  13:24
no, let's go to Burger as a familiar. No option. We'll do option,

Matthias Miller  13:32
okay, okay, and then you might want to size down the left side so you can see more

Unknown Speaker  13:37
on the right. Yes.

Matthias Miller  13:40
So average order size is 1104, here's the lumber board footage without curve. Raw material is can't. Optimal can't size, as in, what's the can't with the lowest curve, optimal curve percentage, we're calculating it off of board feet with kerf, which gives us five times 2.4

Speaker 2  14:05
so can I come back here real quick, optimal? Can size? Does that mean that's, that's it's going to price according to optimal or

Unknown Speaker  14:15
Okay, and

Matthias Miller  14:18
this is and maybe I misunderstood the conversation. My understanding from our conversations, what were that we want to price based on the can't with the lowest curve, and if we choose to do something different, there's a reason for it that should be to our you know? You know, I don't know.

Speaker 2  14:39
Yeah, well, yeah, um, but this is bait. This is that two by four equation. That's where that that's where this internet by three and a half

Matthias Miller  14:50
is coming from. That's coming out of a two by four. Yes. Then we need to change those to. I think we're done with the automatic I don't I mean, should we have identified these as two by fours? I don't think there was anything in there that besides Internet by three and a half.

Speaker 3  15:20
So what was your question? Again, you said,

Matthias Miller  15:23
should, should we have identified? Yep, well,

Speaker 3  15:27
I don't know about that, but they just, I'm not,

Speaker 2  15:33
we don't want to use that equation for pricing, because, you know, we're never going to, um, that 7/16 is actually, I mean, it's almost impossible to get three 7/16 out of an inch and a half with the curve. So, like, you'd have to use this. Like, I don't know how he's doing it. He's not getting, he's not ending up with the full 7/16 I'm sure, right, this is not an option on these guys. So I almost, gosh, I put that in there yesterday as a possibility. Not, yeah, but that doesn't bode well in this scenario. Um, there's like one job that he's doing that for some reason, again, he's not ending up with the full 7/16 which is not an option with this job at all. Um, how?

Speaker 3  16:34
So, yeah, I'm sorry, Matt, I forget the conversation if we talked about pricing it based on optimal curve.

Matthias Miller  16:43
Um, I mean, if you want, I can, what we could do is, I mean, I can price it off of the literal can't size.

Speaker 1  16:53
I Yeah, like, yes, okay, yes.

Speaker 3  16:59
Um, the inch and a half by three and a half is, is

Speaker 2  17:06
only in the pine or yellow pine conversation, if you know what I mean. Like, we're never going to use it. So I don't know if you can separate that. Can you separate that?

Matthias Miller  17:18
So should we so all inch and a half and three and a half should be. But then is that always going to be SPF, or is that going to be

Unknown Speaker  17:30
yellow pine to like, yeah, yeah, SPF, or the YP, okay.

Matthias Miller  17:36
But then, how do I know it's not designated here? So how to does George need to review that?

Unknown Speaker  17:44
You mean on this item?

Matthias Miller  17:46
Yeah, jump into the item. I'm well, I'm guessing it's not, it

Speaker 2  17:49
wasn't, it wasn't on there be previously. But what do

Speaker 2  18:00
we got here? Can, yeah, that changed with,

Speaker 3  18:06
see, that's enough that also that must have changed when that

Unknown Speaker  18:11
migration happened.

Matthias Miller  18:14
You had, you had switched it over. What? Sorry, you say you had switched it.

Speaker 2  18:25
Well, no, when, when we, when we did the whole can configuration and entered all the Pines this. This was not what I'm sure this isn't what George put in here.

Matthias Miller  18:38
Let me take a look. All right. Description, Okay, Amanda changed the description, put an outside height in. Said the raw material to can't, miscellaneous prep had been oak, wing flush, length and width category, palette, George, move the notching from the sawing to sizer prep. I mean, it's been oak or popular from the beginning.

Speaker 2  19:22
Yeah, but not the cants were not inch and a half by three and a half.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
The cans would have been three and a half by six.

Matthias Miller  19:38
Let me go sure is that what's in there is the actual can

Speaker 3  19:44
Oh, that's awesome. What? I'm not sure. What happened to the cant size on this job. It should have been

Unknown Speaker  19:51
three and a half by six,

Speaker 1  19:56
unless was, unless.

Speaker 3  20:01
Yes, unless he didn't have it in there because of scalpy. But I don't understand, George isn't here right now.

Matthias Miller  20:07
Middle one, the middle one has a three and a half by six, but the others, right? Because it's scalpy, it wouldn't have had a can't size in there. Yeah.

Speaker 3  20:16
Well, let's so what did the inch and a half? Okay, ancient half by three and a half popped up as optimal, but not

Speaker 2  20:25
as a recipe, right? That wasn't part of the recipe, um. It just popped up as the optimal.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
Sorry, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  20:37
yeah. Well, if I look at

Speaker 1  20:41
shoot, um Burke tech, what's that? This guy? Burger, burger, burger. That's not the one I was looking for. Um Virgo, too. Yeah, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  20:57
Now, there's your 716, three and a half. Wait a minute, I gotta get in the item on my bad. So 63 and a half.

Speaker 2  21:10
That's why, because it's Brewer and it it's optimal, and should have a three and a half.

Matthias Miller  21:17
Well, this one doesn't have a canned size on there as a site on the second one,

Unknown Speaker  21:22
yeah, I'm not sure why not.

Matthias Miller  21:31
We should. We should do I mean, I made a note to to warn if we're pulling out a CANS without a cant size, and then I'll put that on a cleanup report for George.

Unknown Speaker  21:43
Yeah, so can you,

Speaker 3  21:50
um, so again, what was your we went to Marietta because I was saying, can you eliminate the inch and a half by three and a half from the options, when it's not, when it's not yp or SPF, from the optimal,

Speaker 2  22:13
does it? Well, yeah, it has to come out of there, because there's more curve if you take it out of a can, right?

Unknown Speaker  22:22
Which is what we always do.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
Another or, yeah,

Speaker 3  22:41
I mean, even my like, I think my question is, rather than pricing it optimal, can we price it based on the prescription or based on the recipe. Yeah, we can. I'd rather do that.

Speaker 2  23:08
Then, if it's scalpy, how do you price that? That's got to be, can't prices?

Matthias Miller  23:14
Well, yeah, you need to start putting cants in for scalpy, and wouldn't it. I mean, how does that work on you guys's end? Do you price it? Would you price it the same as you doing it yourself?

Speaker 2  23:27
That's a sad answer to that question is, in my mind, 100% we should be but Marietta, our most high volume. Rick just passed them the scalpy savings. Now, this last year, I'd found out about it not long ago, but in my mind, just don't ever do that.

Matthias Miller  23:54
But right, if you I mean there,

Speaker 2  23:58
I mean you can argue with, you know, high volume and all that.

Matthias Miller  24:03
But then let's be intentional about a high volume. And I mean, there's all kinds of other ways to it. All depends on your pricing philosophy, I suppose. And I guess some way, but, but it doesn't

Speaker 2  24:13
feel good to know that. And then, and then, and then Scout, we shut down for four weeks in the winter time to update their or remodel their saw mill, and, oh, now four weeks is all of a sudden, eight weeks, and we're cutting cans here, and now we're now we know we're losing money like That's

Matthias Miller  24:31
just that sucks. That's painful, that's painful. Okay?

Speaker 2  24:41
And mean, I can't fix that in a, you know, me, and I can't fix that in one, I mean, I ah, it's just a conversation. We need to, oh, man, because I have other stuff. I need to go to her about the buyer. I need to talk to her about some other issues we're having with our trucks getting unloaded. And they're ordering material, and then our driver's going up there, and we have two trailers sitting there all the time. So they order other items besides the 40 sixes and and whenever they get jammed up like this is just an ongoing issue for years is that they don't always get or they don't always unload our trucks on time. So then our drug truck driver will adjust his hauling schedule to accommodate their lack of getting stuff unloaded. And so it like it's it's just a basically, it comes back to we're kind of managing our inventory, but we don't type of thing, and it's like we're at their mercy, and it's, it's just and then you, you know, you're, we're passing them savings on, like it's just

Matthias Miller  25:52
ridiculous, yeah,

Speaker 2  25:54
so that's a strong reason to me, for me to say, Let's not if we can find savings somewhere on a on a process or a method, that's not the norm for us, you know, like that's not baked in, like our baked in method is, can't on a sizer, that's the baked in. And I think we should price everything accordingly. I'd definitely be my philosophy.

Unknown Speaker  26:23
Yep, apart from that, but yeah, so, yeah, okay, if Yeah.

Speaker 3  26:32
So if we have the if we're saying if scalpy, or if we're saying

Speaker 2  26:40
sizer, then it should always be can't pricing or can't, which we threw inch and a half by three and a half into that mix, right? We did. So sorry, I don't know how you can you discern from those?

Matthias Miller  26:58
Yeah, I mean effectively over what we're gonna say is that I'll try to find a clean way to do that. But engineering by three and a half should never come from a can should always come from a from a two by, well, same with, same with, let's see I mean Same, same with your engine app by five and a half and by seven and a half or no? Yes, yes, correct. Okay. And then Engine app by eight still is a can't,

Speaker 2  27:44
yes, yeah, that's right. And that has to be, that's actually, yeah, no, that's good, because it it, we do use inch and a half by eight poplar for the one New Holland job,

Unknown Speaker  27:57
At least. Yeah. Okay, all right, so back on the

Unknown Speaker  28:29
go back to here.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
So will you Hi?

Unknown Speaker  28:48
There you go. Yeah, sure, that was alright.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Matt OPT, so optimal you're you're going to be

Matthias Miller  28:56
able to use actual can size, yeah. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  29:00
and then curve

Unknown Speaker  29:04
board feet with curve

Unknown Speaker  29:07
number of units, what is, what is

Speaker 4  29:09
that one that would be the board feet with, okay, yeah, um,

Speaker 2  29:18
got it. Um, the price per unit, yeah, is it? Is that? What is that? Where you how you pulling that?

Matthias Miller  29:33
I mean, that's set on the whatever the can't pricing is

Speaker 3  29:39
an assigned number, yeah. Sign number is that. Are you pulling that number 65 from somewhere particular?

Matthias Miller  29:48
Yeah, it's in the it's in the raw material settings. Okay, so whatever that, whatever that number should be, yeah.

Speaker 2  30:00
That must have been in there for a long time.

Matthias Miller  30:03
Imagine it's something that you had thrown out a while back. And I had no idea if it's still accurate or not, but yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:13
Hey, are you still good on Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  30:16
just got to take the conversation outside. But I'm good.

Speaker 1  30:19
Okay, um,

Speaker 2  30:22
lumber is so that's total

Matthias Miller  30:31
number with curve, yep, times the board foot.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
Well, there's our lumber number, yep.

Matthias Miller  30:38
Sewing board foot is off because we're not including the sizer specialty cuts. We need pricing for specialty cuts.

Unknown Speaker  30:47
Okay? So we said, Okay, I'm looking at that

Speaker 2  30:56
number of angle cuts. And then there's the dollars, number of bevel cuts. Dollars, number of holes? Dollar, yeah, perfect. So boring, machine beveled chop saw. That's great. And then everything else,

Speaker 3  31:14
everything else we said, is a pass,

Speaker 2  31:20
we, price, we it's the same price, whether it's the sizer, the notcher, all the other things, they all if it if those board feet go through that process, it's one time. If it's sizer and notcher, it's times two, if it's size or notch or pointer three, whatever, right? That's what we are.

Matthias Miller  31:46
We still so on the on the angle cuts, Bell cuts and holes, we do. We have a set of costs and a per unit cost. So it's this much setup, and then this much per angle cut

Unknown Speaker  32:03
I want, I would like. I mean, I was hoping,

Matthias Miller  32:08
do you need a good, sorry,

Speaker 2  32:11
I think we, I think we need to look at reports on those. Thought we might be able to come up with a number for that works across the board there. But again, I don't, maybe

Matthias Miller  32:27
not per a per unit number across the board.

Speaker 2  32:31
Yeah, are those? Are those have each I haven't looked at all. I haven't tried to get any reports on sewing at this point. No, I

Matthias Miller  32:39
don't think we're at a point that we can really but okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:44
so yeah. So then it's sewing board fee,

Unknown Speaker  32:53
sawing dollars,

Speaker 2  32:56
and then over at the right is the grand total right for each line Item.

Unknown Speaker  33:05
How did I just do that? Lumber

Unknown Speaker  33:17
and sewing?

Speaker 3  33:26
So we had a little conversation around sawing and overhead. Are you me? Are we on the same page or an agreement of far as Do do you, well, I guess it's the question is, do you feel like we should assign

Speaker 2  33:54
the sawing in in A more specific manner, like this, or does it make sense to continue to do what Rick's been doing, which is sawing as a part of overhead?

Matthias Miller  34:20
Well? I mean, the, I mean, the short answer is it depends. But if you have some jobs that require three times as much sawing as another job, right? And if I know it's still not the majority of the cost I'm assuming, well, actually, I don't know. I mean, it just depends on how accurate you want to be and how much is how much? What is the percentage of total revenue or total price that's sawing and how much does that variability matter?

Unknown Speaker  35:04
If we, if we, Inc, we're going to,

Speaker 2  35:12
we're going to say board feet times sawing, board feet times whatever is going to equal the sowing dollar.

Unknown Speaker  35:25
So, like, I mean, I guess

Speaker 2  35:32
if to do it right, we would what I mean, sorry, I'm spit balling here. But how do you see it?

Speaker 3  35:39
Like labor? Based on historical and sorry, labor based on historical

Speaker 2  35:51
hours and hours per board feet. So then we have a labor number based on labor rate, and then we also have a

Unknown Speaker  36:05
historical machine, and I don't know what like do we want to go labor?

Matthias Miller  36:15
Simple way is go figure out total board feet, process per item times the orders that we had for the past year. I mean, you're, if you just, if you just figure out total selling board feet processed, which is a number that we don't, we can't get without our item definitions. And then you just look at total, total money spent on sawing, which would

Matthias Miller  36:49
I mean? In my mind, it does make sense that if somebody does, you know, does six times as much sawing as somebody else, that they would pay six times as much sawing overhead as anybody else. So you would take your total labor and sawing overhead for the year, and that gives you the price per board foot process.

Speaker 2  37:14
When you say sawing overhead or you think, can you like, what categories would you fit into there? I don't

Matthias Miller  37:23
know how specific you want to be. It could be. It could be as simple as it could be as simple as just sawing equipment, you know, cost, depreciation, maintenance, etc. It could be as much as what you know. I mean, you could throw in maintenance into that. You could throw in property value for the part of the shop that's used for selling. It just depends how, how granular you want to get with it.

Unknown Speaker  38:00
Well, I mean, I think

Speaker 2  38:04
is it is the world okay with if we would just say, yeah, here's our sowing rate, here's our sowing labor rate. And this is what this item is costing us based on labor required, oh, but over, but overhead. We're just going to do that as a percentage at the end, even though some items are using up a lot more sewing than other items. We're just going to spread it out with everything. Or does the world appreciate? Does our business appreciate if we would break our overhead into a couple categories and try to try to charge a little more overhead when there's a little more labor involved,

Unknown Speaker  39:09
right Which way would you?

Unknown Speaker  39:16
Are you leaning in one way or the other?

Matthias Miller  39:19
And you're certainly at some point, you okay if, if we were three years down the road, it might make sense to divvy out, you know, property and equipment into whatever. But we're not there, so there's diminishing returns at that point. I don't really know how to answer your question. I mean, the short answer is, it depends. It seems to me, there is a sane argument to be made that if you're doing three times, six times as much sawing as the next guy, and you're using more sewing equipment, that you. Should pay for that, because that's part of the complexity of the palette that we're making. And so if I had to choose a middle ground between representing what true cost actually is to to produce, to manufacture it, that's the direction I would go that's from a very operational mind. If you go from a sales perspective, it is kind of nice to spread the overhead out so that your big customers pay for more overhead proportionally, and your smaller customers pay for less overhead proportionally. Potentially, it just makes it easier to sell. I mean, it sells. Selling works fine in both directions,

Matthias Miller  40:53
or it could potentially, I don't think so. My personal instinct would be labor, plus basically selling equipment. But I

Matthias Miller  41:12
don't know that it's a hill to die on.

Speaker 2  41:13
I think so too. I think that's a good I like, I Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  41:21
I so we had sawing labor,

Unknown Speaker  41:34
and then we have, sorry, it's just my little notes.

Speaker 2  41:53
Yeah, I'd have to break it out so we Yeah, so it'd be our cost instead of a labor category and an overhead category, we'd have a sawing with overhead and assembly with

Unknown Speaker  42:09
overhead, yeah,

Speaker 2  42:13
potentially captures some of that machine cost, yep, better on the machine versus hand. So I like, Yeah, I think I like the link where that's going to Be. I

Unknown Speaker  42:51
us, sewing labor, and then, if

Unknown Speaker  42:56
assembly is

Unknown Speaker  43:03
assembly overhead,

Unknown Speaker  43:13
assembly machine,

Speaker 1  43:20
plus assembly labeled now, make sure I don't skirt over Homework here or you know,

Unknown Speaker  43:41
so in order to go that way, oh man, here I need a There we go.

Unknown Speaker  44:03
This sawing machine overhead number,

Unknown Speaker  44:11
annual, right? I need, like, an annual,

Matthias Miller  44:15
I would, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:17
annual. A slowing machine

Unknown Speaker  44:26
cost, yeah,

Speaker 2  44:34
and then on the labor side, it's again, you phrased it out. I'm looking for annual sawing labor cost and annual sawing board feet.

Matthias Miller  44:56
But the board feed, if we're using, if we're using. In four feet based on times processed, we'll have to calculate that number out of item data.

Unknown Speaker  45:15
I'm not going to have historical

Speaker 1  45:19
times processed. You'll have a sage.

Matthias Miller  45:24
You'll have orders for the year, times item data,

Unknown Speaker  45:29
okay, if we do it that way.

Speaker 1  45:33
But then so my point being, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:46
for the last two years, right,

Matthias Miller  45:50
dude, we can pull in. We can pull in order. I mean, as long as the item data is good enough, and I don't know if it is or not, we can pull in. We could pull in prior years from Sage, I think,

Unknown Speaker  46:05
and then we would so then the actual board feet

Speaker 3  46:13
invoiced would not be the Number we use. We would actually use board feet processed,

Unknown Speaker  46:23
correct volume, correct

Unknown Speaker  46:27
so then I need,

Speaker 2  46:32
do you have full sage access now? Yeah, yes, it's in there. I mean, there's historical item data. I'm not sure how many years back.

Matthias Miller  46:48
I should just make sure we didn't pull it in already. I

Matthias Miller  47:09
Yeah, we just have 2024 Okay,

Unknown Speaker  47:16
yeah, so historical

Unknown Speaker  47:23
item sales data per year, and now, is this a whole nother spreadsheet that you're gonna have to build out? Yes,

Matthias Miller  47:44
do you care if would you use the finish yield board footage, or do you want to get smart with sizes or processing you know, yeah,

Speaker 2  48:04
oh, no. Let's do like invoice, yield, Yep, yeah, yeah, let's stick with invoice on that, yep, yep.

Speaker 3  48:19
So historical item sales data per year

Speaker 2  48:24
is that shall I write down Matt will

Unknown Speaker  48:29
pull out of sage, yeah,

Speaker 2  48:40
just for sakes of follow up the sewing machine overhead, annual sewing machine costs, I'll work on,

Unknown Speaker  48:58
I'll work on getting that number.

Speaker 2  49:06
Um, no, okay, back again, historical item sales data per year. You're going to pull it out says you're also going to look at item data

Matthias Miller  49:23
to find the processed

Speaker 2  49:26
how many times we processed? Yeah, is that going to be hard for you to does that there's little angle cuts, bevel cuts and holes? Is that going to throw a wrench into that. Or is that, can you

Matthias Miller  49:43
we're missing that from the item data. So how do you want to? I mean, currently, those are going through the saw, but I don't know how you want to. What?

Speaker 1  49:53
Yeah, hi. I. Would it

Matthias Miller  50:07
be? I think for those, you have to, I think the easiest way to get those, I don't know how you're going to get them, without talking to, I mean, basically figuring out from the shop floor how much it actually costs to do it.

Unknown Speaker  50:20
Well, we're tracking.

Unknown Speaker  50:23
We're tracking now,

Matthias Miller  50:26
but you don't. How do you translate that to

Matthias Miller  50:37
if? Okay, so you look at total process board footage. You look at percent of but there's no time measurement. All that you know is that you processed this many angle cuts,

Speaker 2  50:55
we should have the time measurement on the sawing from George analysis.

Matthias Miller  51:05
Starting in December, which is maybe not enough information to give as much

Speaker 3  51:10
size or units can't linear, feet, yeah, stick with that. Okay, yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  51:26
Oh, do I have a grand

Matthias Miller  51:30
Oh, here one of your feet per hour.

Unknown Speaker  51:34
I'm not. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  51:38
What's that bottom number

Matthias Miller  51:41
that should be. Let me just double check this should be linear feet per hour.

Unknown Speaker  51:44
Average linear feet per hour. Got it.

Speaker 2  51:50
So, here's boring machine. Here's single boring machine. Bevel cuts, and where's the I

Unknown Speaker  52:03
gonna take Benzi. Baker. Baker,

Unknown Speaker  52:06
we're missing that

Unknown Speaker  52:07
chop soul. I think

Unknown Speaker  52:16
if I hit View, yield. Man, what is what is that?

Matthias Miller  52:23
That shows you the yield for that

Unknown Speaker  52:27
day. There's one with boring machine.

Speaker 3  52:48
Where's he? Oh, is that yield for the day? On the right there, the over, under number,

Matthias Miller  52:58
yeah, that, yeah, that's, that's today's yield.

Unknown Speaker  53:02
Okay, which day are we on here, December, 3.

Speaker 3  53:13
All right, let me see here, splitter, can tech Ben, Izzy, Baker, boring machine, four.

Speaker 3  53:36
Ht, lumber stamp, he puts that on a boring machine. I

Unknown Speaker  53:47
Oh, wait, wait, wait, no, no, that gets drilled. Never mind. That's just a miscellaneous additional four is the

Matthias Miller  54:00
quantity. The Well, four is the four is the lumber quantity,

Speaker 3  54:09
36 is the holes. Nine holes per is that? Do we know that?

Unknown Speaker  54:18
What is he? I don't know.

Speaker 2  54:25
Well if I go to item data that's for the NH, 9038577690386,

Unknown Speaker  54:40
all the cows fast. My good, yeah, I'm good.

Unknown Speaker  54:55
9038,

Unknown Speaker  55:01
Oh yeah, this guy,

Unknown Speaker  55:07
one oh fives

Speaker 3  55:15
to drill, boring machine. We don't know that. I don't know what that is. I don't have well, I don't know understand the 36

Unknown Speaker  55:44
I mean, I Guess I do like that order was probably

Unknown Speaker  55:49
December 3,

Speaker 2  56:13
way he Cut it December 3, that means they assemble it after

Speaker 1  56:25
people days, right here, seven,

Unknown Speaker  56:38
seven IDM kits,

Unknown Speaker  56:42
apparently that was the order

Unknown Speaker  56:46
of, I don't know, man,

Speaker 3  56:53
so we don't have, okay, so anyway, we don't have the holes.

Matthias Miller  56:59
We could calculate the holes based off the selling item data, if we, I mean off the selling numbers, if we wanted to, you're right. Not.

Speaker 3  57:12
I mean not, no, like, you mean on, like the sawing yield or the timesheets.

Matthias Miller  57:21
Well, if the if the yields correct, which it probably isn't,

Unknown Speaker  57:27
yield would be pieces right.

Matthias Miller  57:32
So then you would take yield times, look at the timesheet and yield yield times number of holes, and figure out what it came out to.

Unknown Speaker  57:41
But, but we're not tracking number of holes, are we?

Matthias Miller  57:44
Yeah, it's on the item data.

Unknown Speaker  57:47
Why couldn't I? I was trying to find that. How did I miss that? Oh,

Speaker 2  58:07
it's in here. Maybe I glossed over it, oops. Should be

Unknown Speaker  58:16
right here, down a

Matthias Miller  58:18
little bit. Down, down, down, down, right there. Saw one number of holes, two holes. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  58:39
Does that? Does that solve?

Matthias Miller  58:42
Yeah, we, I mean, we can. I still don't think it's a ton of data to go off of, but we can make a best guess that's fine, right?

Unknown Speaker  58:58
In other words, you'll pull it in.

Unknown Speaker  59:00
You got, are you

Speaker 3  59:09
when it comes to sawing cost, you're going to do everything in board feet,

Speaker 2  59:16
based on labor and overhead historical,

Speaker 3  59:22
except for the the holes in the bevel and the angles, and that's just going to be a piece rate.

Matthias Miller  59:30
Yeah, that's, that was the that's the plan.

Unknown Speaker  59:33
Is that fit that. Sorry. It

Matthias Miller  59:36
means, if you want to be completely accurate, you need to subtract, you need to take the sawing time on those machines and subtract it out of your big number and adjust the overhead. Well, you don't have to adjust the overhead. No.

Matthias Miller  59:57
You need to. Yeah, you need to. So. Subtract that labor out, out of the big number, out of the big number, and cost it appropriately.

Speaker 3  1:00:11
Or, I mean, it's very minimal, like it's, it's less than, less than 2% it's my feelings. Now, I'm guessing less than 2%

Matthias Miller  1:00:35
Yeah, or you just set the price. So just,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
just just assign a number, assign a number.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
Is that what we're talking is that what?

Matthias Miller  1:00:48
Well, I mean, I think, I think we can, we can take a look at what data we have. I don't know if it's, I don't know how accurate it's going to be, yeah, like, it's just that's a month or two of, or barely a month of data, right? It give us something to start from. We could see if it looks reasonable,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
right? I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:24
Yeah. So we're that linear feet, the linear feet number.

Speaker 2  1:01:38
How do we make sure that doesn't? Yeah, but how do we make sure that doesn't

Speaker 1  1:01:43
good shape? Wait. Are you over here for a little bit? I'll catch you before 430

Unknown Speaker  1:01:52
sorry, Matt. Are you this is Is this gonna listen,

Matthias Miller  1:02:03
if you want. You could also break sizers, sizing labor. Gang saw labor and overhead out and price that by linear feet, if you would prefer.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:22
Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
no, I don't.

Speaker 3  1:02:34
I don't know. I kind of like, in other words, breaking that out, what would to accomplish what

Matthias Miller  1:02:51
I don't know I mean

Matthias Miller  1:03:01
that I don't not, I don't think it's anything relevant.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
I think

Speaker 2  1:03:07
that I really like the idea that we, we have, we take historical years of total labor and total board fee through sawing, which is more than invoice, because some of that stuff passes by a couple times, goes through a couple processes. So total board fee process historical versus total labor, historical, and that's the cost. That's a sign regardless of whether it's a sizer, whether it's the bump, whether it's the Yata kabata, like we base it on that, and then, obviously, based on, based on the material, the raw material cost, which we're going to have a couple variables,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14
I guess I'm saying, like, at

Speaker 2  1:04:17
what point does that? Does it rip anybody off if, if we ran it on the sizer, and it didn't take as long as if we ran it on the you know, like we paid less for random we ran on the L M, the bump, the L M, and the splitter and the lumber was cheaper, but it took us longer, and hopefully we didn't lose money. Like, I don't know, it just all kind of comes down to, I

Speaker 3  1:04:48
mean, I think we're capturing this, the different pieces of it, pretty well, and I feel like spreading that labor out evenly across. Board feet processed, I kind of like that for Yeah, that's good. So then my if you break, if you would remove,

Speaker 2  1:05:14
in other words, board feet processed on boring machine or bevel cuts or angle cuts, if those would be separated into another,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:31
like in other words, per cut,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37
which could be a hole, a bevel, an angle you and just, and we come up with a price per, I

Matthias Miller  1:05:49
mean, that's basically you want an hours per or a minutes per or a probably a cuts per hour, basically on each of those,

Speaker 3  1:05:58
yeah, yeah, yeah. So we find out how many, yeah, exactly, find out how many cuts per hour, and then come up with a price.

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
Yep, I know you mentioned wanting to drop to hang out with your dad. Yeah, and I got plenty to Okay, okay, plenty to go until tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
Want to make sure I have my if I can do anything,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:27
I'll do, I'll work on

Speaker 3  1:06:32
sewing machine, annual sewing machine cost, and I'm assuming at some point we're going to also need annual assembly machine cost

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
and annual assembly labor.

Speaker 3  1:06:52
And labor, yeah, and sewing labor, Yep, yeah. Let me. Let me work on that. So, annual,

Speaker 2  1:07:09
sewing labor and annual assembly labor and also annual sawing machine costs and annual assembly machine cost so yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
if you want to jumpstart it, we also need, maybe you have it already. We're going to need lumber, all the lumber pricing, or if you

Speaker 2  1:07:37
Yeah, understand, like the CANS versus SPF versus number Yep. Can I enter dumb question? Maybe you can interrupt yep In the Configure,

Matthias Miller  1:07:54
configure lumber or raw materials, either one,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:57
either one, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:08:01
Do they can't pricing. You can't put in yet. You can't you'll be able to tomorrow, sure, but lumber and plywood I have in is by linear feet. Okay, that's fine. That gets away from and then the special order, we're probably gonna have to break into different special into different special

Unknown Speaker  1:08:24
order items. But hold on, what's linear? Linear feet is,

Speaker 2  1:08:33
sorry. Linear feet is lumber and plywood,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
and can't just board feet with

Matthias Miller  1:08:43
curve, cans cutbacks and random are board feet with curve.

Speaker 3  1:08:47
Can't cut backs random board feet with curve. Um, okay. Plywood, linear feet, price,

Speaker 1  1:08:56
how, how are you? I uh, okay, is that what

Unknown Speaker  1:09:08
we on the plywood? I can't remember. That

Matthias Miller  1:09:10
is what we had decided. I'm open to changing it. We don't have to.

Speaker 3  1:09:15
Yeah, do you remember real quick? Because we talked about using one two feet, I forget.

Matthias Miller  1:09:23
Yeah, I haven't put that stuff in there yet. I have notes in the Excel file, but I haven't

Speaker 3  1:09:27
put that comes back to linear feet. Is that what we're saying? Like, in other words, if a piece uses say, we use 18, sorry, 16 by 96 that's a third of a full piece, are we then going to be charging the customer for a full piece, because it's 96

Matthias Miller  1:09:51
Well, that, I mean, based on that model, yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
yes. Um. One Weren't we gonna go buy a piece on the plywood and then and then charge it either, either, like the whole sheet, or half the sheet or a quarter of the sheet?

Matthias Miller  1:10:18
We're gonna round up to 12346, and eight. And if you do by linear foot, then it'd be, it'd be an eighth of a piece. The unit price would be an eighth of a piece. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
But the problem is, and if you do like us,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
you know me and a 16, my

Unknown Speaker  1:10:38
name it. What?

Speaker 2  1:10:43
Um, 1234, yeah, I understand what i Man shoot.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:50
Well, we can maybe. Do you want to talk about that later?

Matthias Miller  1:10:53
Yeah, we can. One alternative would be to require George to put in the square footage, or the number of pieces of plywood that are being used, and then just make sure that we don't use more square footage than what's specified on the on the price.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:13
I'm not tracking with that. I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:11:15
Okay, he might just have to manually say, hey, we need two pieces of plywood, two sheets of plywood, and then when we look at the lumber, anything we pull out of plywood, we make sure that we don't use more than, more than that square footage of plywood. It doesn't. So we wouldn't get smart enough as far as a cut list or anything like that. But just, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:39
we can talk. Okay. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
all right. Thanks, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:43
What we say for tomorrow, 1010, 4510

Matthias Miller  1:11:47
3010 45 Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
perfect. Okay, thanks, man. All right.
