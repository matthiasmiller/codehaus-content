Speaker 2  15:27
Okay. Sounds good. Joel track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation Event Log

Speaker 1  15:39
basically done. Bangladesh is still working on wrapping up the job. So I'd say 90 to 95% done. Yeah, wrap up review testing. Okay.

Speaker 2  16:01
Sounds good. Okay, Joel, how about the account names wrapping in PDF? Oh, sure. I had it doing this

Matthias Miller  16:14
wasn't the one that you replied to that you said you you liked was it

Unknown Speaker  16:21
later on?

Matthias Miller  16:22
continuous use an income statement? I think that's actually a little bit. Yeah, that was you didn't do that. Is

Speaker 2  16:30
that the same one is the printing issues and income statement. Okay. Okay, so let me I have given myself a duplicate tag. All right. I know right. Come on. You can do it. Okay, you can't do it. Okay, nevermind. I'll just write myself a note

Speaker 2  16:57
statements. Okay. All right. Matthias closing process for accounting impact.

Matthias Miller  17:07
Notes change except I think I came up with a simpler way to do it. So I hope so.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
How about blockout time for the Go Live plan?

Matthias Miller  17:18
I think we're supposed to talk it through today if we can

Unknown Speaker  17:23
allow companies specific signature adjustments

Matthias Miller  17:27
that was delegated to Jonathan updated eta February 15. March 15. I'm sorry. Okay.

Speaker 2  17:36
Great Uncategorized Expense Report revision

Matthias Miller  17:41
and juice quarter review

Speaker 2  17:50
validated on the deposit record miscellaneous items account is different from the main deposit account it says it's tied to a nick task but I didn't find it I didn't find it so I think I can go back and look forward again if it's dropped.

Matthias Miller  18:49
We're gonna call into the Zoom boyfriend

Matthias Miller  19:00
tighter knit cast. I think this is a duplicate of something but I think that it's done waiting to be verified

Speaker 2  19:14
I just need to figure out how to find whatever duplicate we think this is I guess. Deposit record. Okay. About that.

Matthias Miller  19:30
Mark, and drew, are you guys able to hear us?

Unknown Speaker  19:34
Yes, we are.

Matthias Miller  19:39
Alright, so we got started going down through just through the task list that we've got. So Roger might do we do want to just jump to the top and yeah, we can go back through a quick run through. Okay. Sure.

Speaker 2  19:55
So mark the documenting the procedure for closing books for 2023 Do we have any updates on that item?

Unknown Speaker  20:03
No, no change on that. Okay,

Speaker 2  20:06
great. drew the vendor invoice worn on missing information or add warning icon that was yours to review we have an update

Unknown Speaker  20:22
Yeah, I think that's all taken care of.

Matthias Miller  20:24
No, I did. I did hang on before we go too far with it did make some fairly substantial revisions to how we handled the duplicate warnings. And so whether it's Drew or whether we've got somebody like Austin pick a look at it. I do think it wouldn't marason testing.

Speaker 3  20:46
Okay, so you've made some changes recently to that.

Matthias Miller  20:50
Yeah. And so that's waiting for an update and might not be ready until I'll see if I can get an update tonight and if not tonight, hopefully this weekend.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
Okay. Oh, okay. Not alive.

Matthias Miller  21:00
Yeah. Not alive yet. Correct. Okay,

Speaker 2  21:04
okay, that's fair. Let's wait on that one. Okay let's see Joel told us that the reconciliation event log is 98 95% done we're just waiting on wrap up drew for handling payments for multiple Essos the note was we need to make sure this is being enforced

Unknown Speaker  21:33
update multiple payments

Speaker 4  21:42
that already that wasn't on the deposit record when last week

Speaker 3  21:46
is that is that multiple sales order in a payment or multiple payments per sales are

Unknown Speaker  21:57
guys Do you remember this?

Speaker 3  21:59
I mean if it's the multiple sales orders in one payment yes that is all functional incorrectly

Unknown Speaker  22:08
multiple so payments follow each other

Unknown Speaker  22:13
okay, yeah, I think that's

Speaker 2  22:15
okay, we're going to mark this as closed then good luck we didn't have an update yet on closing process for accounting impact that guys are still working on that we were going to Matthias told me you're going to work today on blocking out time for the Go Live plan and then we're close to being caught up drew the the vendor invoices do not match accounting issue has that been resolved

Unknown Speaker  22:55
I'm

Speaker 3  22:58
really good we move that was there something you were still wrapping up on that

Unknown Speaker  23:09
guys you're muted

Matthias Miller  23:12
sorry I don't I don't believe so. I think I think all of that was frozen as far as they know that is good to go.

Speaker 3  23:20
Okay to check into it. Okay,

Speaker 2  23:23
great. The next item is for Drew again 1099 summary report

Unknown Speaker  23:35
that is

Matthias Miller  23:39
hang on is that we make sure that's actually live yet it slipped my mind to push an update last night

Unknown Speaker  23:54
Wait a minute

Matthias Miller  24:03
it is live. It's not on the menu

Unknown Speaker  24:12
me

Matthias Miller  24:15
I will miss Drew. I'm gonna send you a link so you can take a look at it. And then I will add it to the menu.

Speaker 5  24:27
Okay Okay. Great.

Speaker 2  24:38
The next task is also drew Uncategorized Expense Report revision for bank and credit card transactions. The note was are you happy with the expense report?

Speaker 3  24:54
Yeah, we want to make a little bit of changes we can cover that pleasure okay

Speaker 2  25:06
good okay Matthias validate that on the deposit record we did this Didn't we already? This is a duplicate nevermind Mark put together budget totals in an Excel spreadsheet for Matthias to import

Speaker 4  25:23
I'm still no change on that. I would expect some changes happened Wow. That got pushed back on our site so I would date that for about March the 21st. Okay

Speaker 2  25:40
I'll move that out right next one is for Matthias transactions by contact report. That's pending update. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  25:51
it's done pending an update

Unknown Speaker  25:56
what is is that

Unknown Speaker  25:58
transactions by contact was that

Speaker 3  26:03
that's the one that we use for subcontractors. Yeah, that's shouldn't be anything update already use it

Speaker 2  26:26
Okay, well, it should if you've used it then it is in fact closed right? I can. I can. Well, we had

Matthias Miller  26:34
I mean, I think it's fine. We had he was using a user recorded version like a non standard version. Okay. All right. Yeah. It was just making it standard and adding it to the menu. Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 2  26:53
Make sense? Let's see for Drew we had an ad account subtype groupings for balance sheets that was going to be going live this previous weekend. It looks like did you get a chance to look at that

Matthias Miller  27:11
sometimes Bounce

Unknown Speaker  27:15
Bounce she looked okay when When did you mark

Speaker 4  27:23
last week or last week, but the income statement if it was there something wrong with the balance sheet. I thought the income statement is what the income statement it was grouping in the operating expenses it wasn't grouping like we wanted it to it didn't respect the numbers. Do you have notes or reference on more notes on what this was

Speaker 2  27:54
I can just open this thing's for balance sheets Okay, so we had a full proposal Matthias is there a better way to describe this than just to read it out.

Matthias Miller  28:12
We wanted to we gave you guys custom categories on accounts for how they should be categorized on the balance sheet

Matthias Miller  28:32
so that to match the end you guys had sent a PDF over to us of the balance sheet that you wanted laundry if you pull it out, maybe we can get a little bit more specific so groupings for current assets, scroll down and let's take a look at the other highlighted items of fixed assets current liabilities long term liabilities and basically having those showing those groupings on the balance sheet that's what this is for. However I believe it does require some configuration within your financial accounts to categorize these correctly

Speaker 4  29:21
Yeah, the reason I'm drawing a bit of a blank because I thought I didn't look real closely but I thought they were they look correct

Unknown Speaker  29:36
you remember, Are there parts

Speaker 1  29:39
under Can you pull up that those notes again? I'm seeing on January 7 teen there's a will be going live this weekend? Yeah. Okay. That is I was also feeling a bit lost. So I think I think we're basically looking at history and this case meaning I think this is done and delivered.

Matthias Miller  30:23
So this isn't, this isn't drew squirt. And we need to, I think, you know, I think the best thing to do is drew some time when you've got when we can do a screen share. We can maybe walk through this, what's required to get this walkthrough the specifics of what this is for and how to set it up in your system. Yeah,

Speaker 3  30:51
what they will the configuration be happening on the records of the accounts, or is it going to be somewhere some other configuration?

Speaker 1  31:01
Place? Either on the accounts or on the subtypes?

Unknown Speaker  31:06
Yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  31:14
Cool. Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 4  31:18
What is what is wrong with holidays? Now? Are they just, they're not pooping properly?

Speaker 3  31:24
That was the issue. I don't recall seeing that my printout looking by on that regard, but there was no, there was no distinction between what's current assets and what's like, property plant equipment sections. Got it? I forgot to look at that part of it.

Speaker 2  31:58
Okay, this is builder cash transaction reports.

Matthias Miller  32:02
That is a duplicate of

Speaker 2  32:06
Well, yeah, it says it's duplicate. I think I merged it. Already. merged it backwards, me.

Matthias Miller  32:25
See if I can pull it up on my view. I thought we thought we'd talked about this was the one that we talked about that they had. Let's see. We had some revisions require that we're going to talk about today

Matthias Miller  32:47
you believe shoot me the link to your click up view? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:03
Yes, okay. Well, Dialpad.

Matthias Miller  33:15
So, this is the same one as

Matthias Miller  33:25
seeing there's Uncategorized, no response

Speaker 2  33:31
on the checking and credit card spending report was a task that was the duplicate of this. So I merged it together. And now it's just called builder cash transaction report. Should I rename it to check in and credit card spending reports?

Unknown Speaker  33:51
All the same thing.

Speaker 4  33:55
We now call it the cash, cash and credit card transactions report. So I mean, that's what it's actually what the user report is Nate. Perfect.

Matthias Miller  34:09
Note, drew just one clarification. Is this the same? This is the same as the is there a separate Uncategorized transactions report or no? Yes. Okay, because we have the earlier email that we've tested we've looked at was actually talking about both. Is there anything that you need on the uncategorized expenses report?

Unknown Speaker  34:43
Do we have a task for Uncategorized

Matthias Miller  34:45
expense? Yeah, if you scroll, okay.

Unknown Speaker  34:47
Yeah. Okay. There we go. It's,

Matthias Miller  34:49
it's that one's actually tying two tasks together.

Speaker 2  34:55
Is it together or is it just two tasks from the same email? two

Matthias Miller  35:00
tasks from the same email. Okay.

Speaker 3  35:08
I think there was something an additional column that are wanting to not forget.

Matthias Miller  35:18
Grouping totals you wanted

Unknown Speaker  35:27
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  35:31
So some of the some of these things are getting lost in, in emails and I'm not. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:39
Getting lost in my brain.

Speaker 2  35:42
Yeah, I did. I have been splitting up some of these emails into separate tasks, because they've been talking about separate things. So the emails are attached to both tasks in this case. Yep.

Matthias Miller  36:04
Well, I will, I will add, I can,

Speaker 3  36:07
I'm looking at one. I'm looking at a copy of an old one here, and I'm not I'm not seeing anything more that I need. I'm in the roofing totals would be great.

Unknown Speaker  36:28
But

Speaker 3  36:31
maybe I'll run into it another time or else it was on another. Another report, there was a report. Sometime recently, there was a report that I wanted to be able to see the account connected, but this has that so it wasn't. I think that's done.

Matthias Miller  36:54
Okay. Well, I will. I'll go ahead and add the grouping totals. And I think I think we can satisfactory close out that first Uncategorized Expense Report revisions and and the other issue in the banking credit card transaction report email was about the income statement detail report being accrual based and how we wanted to handle that. And I think we've addressed that all separately. So I think right, yeah. So so that tasks can be either the the uncategories expense, and this one yes, can be closed out. And we will handle the cash and credit card transaction report changes in the task below.

Speaker 2  37:47
Okay, so I'll link that up. Close them both. And then we will okay.

Matthias Miller  37:55
This one's not done though. Which

Speaker 2  37:58
one? The last one. Translate Transaction Report? Yes. Okay. So don't close them both. Okay.

Matthias Miller  38:05
Just the first one Yes, correct. And then on that update actually the update on the cash and credit card transactions report there are additional revisions required which we will talk to you after we're done with the project update call.

Unknown Speaker  38:24
Okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  38:27
Okay, good. Okay.

Speaker 2  38:31
The next one is for Drew allow attaching statements to reconciles let's see we had the last note was add non RG memo on reconcile screen for attachments and Matthias would email Nick and CC Joel. So where are we actually at with this?

Speaker 3  38:52
I haven't got that far reconcile to find out where it is or Okay.

Speaker 2  39:03
Okay. So the next one is for Joel ad budget columns in some statements. We just had some updates on this, I think. Sure.

Speaker 1  39:15
So in the live system, you can specify budgets on accounts. There's a budget comparison report in changes that have been made but not yet deployed to live basic ledger spending update those reports or those budget values can be shown on the income report. So essentially, development is done. Subject any any problems found? No,

Speaker 4  39:59
I use During the the budget numbers versus actual numbers report is will be live after the next update and showing budget numbers on the income statement is already alive.

Speaker 1  40:16
The converse actually the comparison to budget report is currently live the columns in the income statement will be live after the next update

Unknown Speaker  40:29
good real good cool

Unknown Speaker  40:37
so sorry putting this in Drew's court to review

Unknown Speaker  40:43
sounds good to me

Speaker 2  40:46
works excellent All right, the bias we have a vendor and company mismatch situation

Matthias Miller  40:53
we need to mark and drew this isn't on the college me yet we need to talk about the vendor and company mismatch. Well, let me hang on I'm making too many assumptions that I remember exactly. I'm pretty sure I do. But let me double check

Matthias Miller  41:29
Yeah, let's let's Yeah, Mark drew one of you guys can we're here I can is let me just grab hold on there. We

Speaker 4  41:41
have. Let's I think on our agenda, the last item on the list. HB is Is that so? We're good that's what you want it yeah, good

Speaker 2  41:59
are we good there? Yeah, just leave it okay. The fires investigate or create a process for moving payments from one zone to another?

Matthias Miller  42:08
No change. Okay.

Speaker 2  42:12
For drew assists, checks and deposits validate against duplicate main and RG accounts.

Unknown Speaker  42:23
Duplicate name? Oh, yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  42:27
right. So I created a pretty troubling Dwayne's office, it seemed to be working

Speaker 3  42:41
wrong. They were, well, the most common thing that I ran into is they would on a deposit, you'd select the bank and depositing into miscellaneous items and say, well, this goes into that bank. So let's put the bank again.

Speaker 4  42:58
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Duane had typed up an epiphany about our long list and send it to Matthias and I and then next morning, we were on a call we answered while that's all working Dwayne, I think it's all good good times. Okay,

Speaker 2  43:22
well let's see my next task is handling historically reconciled transactions and I think I might have a potential duplicate down here is this the same as add non RG attachment memo to reconciliation child screen?

Matthias Miller  43:40
No, but the non rd attachments memo is a duplicate of the one that Drew said was it's not healing historical reconcile transactions it's it's the attaching statement

Unknown Speaker  43:57
attaching statements to reconciles

Unknown Speaker  44:02
Yeah, that's the one that I haven't gotten to yet

Speaker 2  44:13
Okay, Mr. Salt let me go back up. So we have handling historically reconciled transactions. Last note was was waiting it needs clarification. Drew or Matthias do we know what's going on with this one?

Speaker 3  44:33
That is that's waiting on me now. So I think I have a clarification. Although one that I just ran into this morning, do Matthias do I have to put in the ending date that I would have put in when I did those old reconciled or can I just put a The ending date of any sort in and it will pick up anything that was reconcile between those things

Speaker 3  45:14
like, suppose the credit card statement was actually dated the 21st of the month and I just put the 30th of the month in would it? If I make that be one of my reconcile sections or periods or whatever you call them would that tie all of those that are reconciled for the statement ending 21st into that period?

Unknown Speaker  45:55
Wait, did he drop off? I don't see him all of a sudden.

Speaker 1  46:00
A phone number just entered the waiting room. Oh, okay. All right. Why is your silence was mystifying until we realized that your disappearance was more mystify?

Matthias Miller  46:21
Well, it wasn't the rapture or anything like that. We we lost power and I couldn't tethered to my phone either. I had to find that. See how wide wide reach this is and see if I can find a coffee shop that will accommodate me

Matthias Miller  46:50
Okay, well, I was saying something that I okay.

Unknown Speaker  46:56
No, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  47:00
But I remember what it was refresh me.

Speaker 3  47:06
So on the clarifications about the reconcile statement, reconcile periods, something like that as it's called

Matthias Miller  47:24
you had you had had some questions and I just I had explained to you last time about a certain report that showed you which statement and data needed to be entered and where we had left it was for you to enter in go back and enter statement information or any statements that you had reconciled since we started tracking that.

Speaker 3  47:49
Yes, yeah. And I recall that now it was there. Did you say you have a report that shows what the statement date is?

Unknown Speaker  48:02
Yes.

Matthias Miller  48:05
And this okay. I'm pretty sure email that to you but

Speaker 3  48:12
okay. Well, let me let me check for that email and let's roll on up here okay.

Speaker 2  48:23
Okay, good. Okay, the next one might be a duplicate again that I couldn't find the assist checks and deposits validating is using parental or parent financial accounts. TNM is in parentheses there and then there's one right under it it says assist check record add notes memo that TNM is also in parentheses under they have different incident numbers but are these related so

Speaker 3  49:00
not using parent accounts that that is functioning properly? Okay, great. What was the second part?

Speaker 2  49:13
The next one was add notes memo parentheses.

Speaker 3  49:20
The the notes memo is present, but I cannot add any attachments to it. Okay,

Speaker 2  49:26
that makes sense. That is the notes I think we had last time so check that back to Matthias.

Matthias Miller  49:34
So the now there's also another task as far as the notes memo, okay. Are you able to is that just on checks and deposits or is there anywhere else where you're not? Where you're not able to do that

Speaker 3  49:53
those are the only places that I've noticed that regular transaction, I can add an attachment Now, when I say add an attachment, I can I can copy it into the notes box. It's not, it's not the additional link to place attachments on the other platform.

Matthias Miller  50:19
Right. So I think there's a separate test for being not being able to attach to checks and deposits. Okay. Which is the same thing as this is an either way, it's a waiting, I fix that this morning and it's pending an update.

Speaker 2  50:42
Okay. See if I can find duplicate task, but Okay, so it's pending update. Okay.

Speaker 2  50:59
So I'm going to put this back in Drew's court to review what we're waiting on an update. Okay. How about drew the printing issues in the income statement? We already go over that.

Unknown Speaker  51:16
That was the lines with no, yes,

Unknown Speaker  51:18
that's taken care of. Oops.

Speaker 2  51:28
All right. So Joel, add cash flow statement.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
And no update on that.

Speaker 2  51:35
Okay, we're getting into March 1, actually. So I don't need to do that one. So let me scroll down to any incoming and then we're almost done. So company name on the balance sheets I have as an incoming transaction.

Matthias Miller  51:52
What's the priority on that? I don't know.

Speaker 4  52:02
I would say we we've committed to having balance sheets legit balance sheets by end of March. So I would say March 21.

Unknown Speaker  52:17
Okay. Okay.

Matthias Miller  52:19
That's, that's in Jonathan's record, and we should be able to have it by March 15. Good.

Speaker 3  52:34
I don't know if there was a job or not. I don't recall that. We went over it. But the suffixes on the Check Names. On that is all done.

Matthias Miller  52:46
Good. So

Unknown Speaker  52:49
subject that after a call with Josh. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  52:54
I don't recall having

Speaker 3  52:56
people stopping. Didn't have any.

Speaker 2  53:01
Gotcha. Okay. I jotted it down. If I can find something to update I will. The next coming one is support for importing transaction line items.

Matthias Miller  53:15
Probably similar question here. What is the priority for this? We can do a march 15. Or we can explore expedite options.

Unknown Speaker  53:33
Explore next day options you said.

Matthias Miller  53:37
Excellent. Well, we can explore that too.

Speaker 4  53:47
Well, the import I mean, do you the imports happen every Thursday or Friday? So like this week? We have Yeah, Thursday or Friday the imports happen so it obviously won't make it this week. I mean, I guess do whatever you

Speaker 3  54:01
were fortunate, okay. Without it doesn't stop us from doing anything. It just improves the system. So it's not super urgent. But we do use it every week. So

Matthias Miller  54:15
there's a lot will allow you to what search

Speaker 3  54:19
it makes those transactions are more definable when the the reconcile but the 15th for whatever that date was that you said that'll work?

Unknown Speaker  54:34
Okay, march 15. That is and that is

Unknown Speaker  54:42
I should ask this question. Sorry, sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 3  54:51
I was just saying you tend to get beginning things that faster than we can test them and utilize them. You know, some of those things anyways,

Speaker 1  54:59
Oh, nice problem from our perspective. Well, actually, I do have a question similar to Matthias is on the cash flow statement. He especially given that I am flying to Bangladesh for a couple of weeks on February 29.

Speaker 4  55:27
What's your you're saying Joel is doing what you're seeing is you're going to be hands on in Bangladesh. So you can expedite it if we ask if.

Unknown Speaker  55:36
Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.

Matthias Miller  55:39
about 24 hours of travel time, there should be plenty of time.

Unknown Speaker  55:53
Now, that was

Speaker 1  55:57
Yeah. But really, I mean, we do want to, to give you folks what you need. And I'm.

Speaker 1  56:12
And I am looking with fear to say the least and march one.

Speaker 4  56:20
Well, okay. So cash flow statements with where we're at. I'm going to say, in our transition from QuickBooks to this accounting system, that those in when you can because there's like, I don't think, okay, eventually it will need them. But what we're doing right now, we still managers are still used to the old sets of reports. So these these new cashflow statements that are correct from an accounting perspective, it will take some time to understand to implement and for them to do much valued. So all that to say I would I wouldn't, I mean, fit it in when you can, but don't. I mean, if it's April 1, and that's okay.

Speaker 1  57:16
Okay. That is really helpful. Well, and assuming we don't have other crises that I think April 1 seems like it should be pretty doable. Because yeah, I think for the stuff on which I'm a bottleneck, I think that's rapidly fading.

Speaker 2  57:42
So Joel sent we're kind of using dates as priorities here. Not necessarily as hard deadlines. Do you want me to switch the date to April 1, or do you want to keep it somewhere in mid Ma, for priority sake? You know,

Speaker 1  57:57
I mean, I think this is the next one on my plate, so maybe we should keep it earlier. Even March one.

Speaker 2  58:08
Yeah, whatever works for you works for me. I just wanted to ask before I moved it, sort of down the priority list by move. Yeah, yeah, that's helpful.

Matthias Miller  58:17
Can I Can I jump in? Maybe I'm, you know, out of answer, but I like the idea of dates, reflecting reality as much as possible. And I think we just said, it really isn't, it's not going to be overdue. And I think a from what I want to see in this report, it would be really helpful to have a with 80% probability this is going to be done by this date, and I feel very comfortable committing to it without the anxiety of it turning red and being overdue.

Speaker 2  58:49
Okay, so I do want to change it to April one is the idea. Okay. Sounds to me too. All right. No, I think consistency is the only key here it doesn't matter to me which one we choose as long as we choose it consistently. Sure. Okay. Matthias add default GL accounts to standard employees report.

Matthias Miller  59:12
This is also slated for March 15. delegated delegated to Jonathan.

Speaker 2  59:33
And then account balance diagnostic is the only one to look at here. This is this one. Is this related to a current task or do I need to create a new task?

Matthias Miller  59:46
Sure it is but I'm not sure where it's at. We have it on the agenda to talk about

Speaker 2  59:53
check instead of with a vendor invoice. Okay. Fix Oh, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
I mean, you can keep this on with the deadline date of today just because we're going to be talking about it. We'll figure out what needs to happen. Okay. Sounds good to me.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
Okay, I think we finally got through it.

Matthias Miller  1:00:24
On the RTO. Actually, the rent to own

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
let's see which one is

Matthias Miller  1:00:36
the rent to own payment rounding error? 85 for a second on the bottom. Oh, okay. Gotcha. So Mark, we found a bug in our rent to own calculations, where we did not round out sales tax Damage Waiver fee and initial or base payment amount before calculating the total, which resulted in Penny differences. We have fixed it, we are now rounding those before we, before we calculate the total amount for my review of the code, it looks good to me. But do you want to have anybody in your office or Dwayne's office? Taking a look at that before we just start issuing RTO contracts with this?

Speaker 4  1:01:31
So Well, first, it how did you just came across it right and found found the air it wasn't something that that anybody Dwayne's office brought up?

Matthias Miller  1:01:43
Correct, it was found internally in testing on our end?

Speaker 4  1:01:49
I would guess you just implement the change, and we keep going, but that this is an area I'm very know very little about but it on the sales side of things currently does assist calculate, like, customer wants to buy a building a $10,000 building, put it on a rent to own and the state of North Carolina for a 48 month contract. Does assist. Calculate that monthly payment amount? Yes. Okay. And that's that, is that where the the rounding? Okay, then you were? That's where the difference that that's what's changing? That is correct. But then it was it was not matching with, like, with RTL Pro software, or what with what was it not matching,

Matthias Miller  1:02:50
it was not matching, if you added up all the pieces that were supposed to go into it, which would be the base payment, the DW F and the tax. And if you added those together, and looked at the total payment, it was off the total payment was off by a penny. But we did not compare it with our to Pro software or anything like that.

Speaker 4  1:03:13
And it's used only for the initial payment. And then from there, the whole everything shifts to RTL Pro software, and has managed throughout the remainder of its life from there. Right.

Matthias Miller  1:03:26
That is correct. Now there's there is a theoretical possibility that the customer might sign up that if our calculations differ in our rounding, that the customer might sign a contract for $349.19. And we in RTO pro builds them for $349.20. And across a 36 month term, overcharges them by 36 cents.

Speaker 4  1:03:57
Yeah, most of that clientele is not accounting so

Speaker 4  1:04:06
I don't know. I mean, I think that that makes sense. I've heard Wayne say that, you know, that that's something they run into a lot with, you know, other companies they manage our to for, like, what the salesperson tells them, and then what the software actually tells them is is various from you know, does vary so they just walk the customer through that and said, you know, so no, I think I think good thanks for flagging that but I don't see any reasons why. You can't just take those changes live and we just I mean, unless I'm missing something. No,

Matthias Miller  1:04:46
I don't. I don't think so. So I think you get close this one out

Unknown Speaker  1:04:56
Okay, anything else?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:58
Good. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
no, I don't. Okay. Well, yes, there is something else. Sorry. Do you want to take a look at upcoming tasks? And make sure that our priorities are established correctly? I think, Joel, you're pretty clear on what we need from you. Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:29
I mean, I think shepherding the wrap up of several jobs, and but then moving forward into cash flow.

Matthias Miller  1:05:45
Sounds right. So I don't I don't know that we have anything. Unless there's something from the agenda that we need Joe for I think we just

Speaker 3  1:05:58
joltin carried the reconcile reconcile module changes.

Speaker 1  1:06:06
In broad strokes, yes. If you have stuff to talk about, then yes, we should talk about that.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:06:17
Well, it can be whatever you want. But I was working on textiles morning. And it might be me not knowing how to use it, or might be a problem with it, I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
Well, I'd say let's talk about that then.

Speaker 3  1:06:40
What I had after I reconciled, and I wasn't able to send these screenshots and reports out, but after I reconciled, then I went to export the file, you know, the report that it creates. And there were transactions listed on there as unreconciled that had not been in the and not been listed even on the page before I had reconciled it.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19
Don't leave a problem.

Speaker 3  1:07:26
I can for you, I can send you the report. I did screenshots of before and after and reports of before and after you look at those changes. And then once I ask them service, I'll send those to the thing was the report following the account balance? And how much like the total that the bottom, though, reconcile out? When you reconcile that that reloads the page? As though you're going to continue reconciling and says, Okay, nothing is now selected as being cleared within this period. It like reset, and then the report that it gives you for what was reconciled? Has that reset portion at the bottom? Instead of you know, what?

Speaker 1  1:08:24
I was reviewing reviewing some work last night, and committed changes last evening, actually, that so I think I know what you're talking about. It shows the correct starting balance, but then it shows no, no. debits or credits, no transactions, and then it shows the exact same ending balance, which is right, yeah. So with an update, that should be resolved. Okay. The, the output report sounds like something that that I need to check into.

Speaker 3  1:09:15
Now, I did just think it might be from not having previous reconciles, assigned properly or something, too. Because I got a little uncertain of what I'm doing there. And that's why I brought that up earlier. So that might have something to do with that. I don't know. Okay, well, I'll send you those before and after things so you can look at it. And then I'll wait for the update. Where would the attachment place the notes and the attachment? Be? Would that be like on the original page when you go to log in wherever that may not login, you go to create a reconcile to do,

Speaker 1  1:10:05
right for that one I will refer to is I believe,

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
yeah. So when you when you go to reconcile it prompts you for the company name, I believe. And then it shows a screen with the list of statements or Yeah, name and account which let me just pull this up so I'm seeing the right thing. And then there's a reconciliation, that list of statements at the top and then underneath that there's an attachments memo. Okay. You'll have to hit to upload, okay

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:11:12
y'all need anything else for me?

Matthias Miller  1:11:14
Um, yeah, I did want to make sure that there was nothing that we were missing as far as there any March. Okay, let's see here.

Speaker 2  1:11:30
Show ending bank. Would you like to just read through this Matthias or do you want me to talk through it?

Matthias Miller  1:11:36
I can, I can do it. I'm sure any bank and credit card balance for pending items? Well, that one I can get to. I think that's okay. That's fine. There was just a some time streamlined vendor invoices needing payment,

Speaker 1  1:11:47
actually, just confirming Should I drop off? Anything

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
else for Joel? I think that's it. Is that right?

Speaker 4  1:11:55
I do in 30 seconds. Joe, how were the pandas.

Speaker 1  1:11:58
They were awesome. They sat. They were very obliging in and enthusiastically munching on bamboo. And we circled back through the exhibit several times throughout the day. And I think our daughter was very, very pleased. was delightful.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:28
Yeah, good.

Speaker 1  1:12:29
Thank you. Oh, and thank you for that. That email with the link to the book. I I think I will, will pursue that.

Speaker 1  1:12:44
All right. Well, thanks a lot. I'll talk with you later.

Speaker 4  1:12:55
Because you guys have time to go beyond 12. We're okay, here. The only reason we're asking is we're going to see if we can move our meeting with we have a meeting with Dwayne and Leanne at 1230. See if we can move that later.

Matthias Miller  1:13:10
Yeah, I'm, I'm good to go for quite a while. Okay.

Speaker 2  1:13:21
Okay, so we were at streamline vendor invoices meeting payment?

Matthias Miller  1:13:27
Yeah, let's I guess I have a, I have a proposal Blitz. I don't know that you actually need to hang around for this either. Audra. What if we go through our meeting agenda? And on the heels of that, if we could review some of the items that we've got slated. Coming up that either need more definition or need prioritization? Maybe we could talk that through because I feel like these are, these are not just any ready to go. Let's go get it done by March 1. These are some of these needs need additional conversation.

Speaker 2  1:14:17
Okay. That works for me. Awesome. All right. Have a great meeting.

Matthias Miller  1:14:23
Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank

Matthias Miller  1:14:31
you all right. And while we're at a stopping point here, I'm going to break for just a few minutes I'll be right back.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:25
Not sure where they went

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
there they

Matthias Miller  1:16:30
switch into zoom

Unknown Speaker  1:16:36
hey look at that

Speaker 6  1:16:38
yay. Back in the land of the living again

Matthias Miller  1:16:42
if you've been hit by the AT and T outage the

Unknown Speaker  1:16:46
idle

Unknown Speaker  1:16:49
okay No No

Unknown Speaker  1:17:05
we're good to go

Speaker 7  1:17:27
now we know that Ben is on I had he was so quiet I didn't even know he was on

Matthias Miller  1:17:35
I've been staying mostly muted because I'm getting over the flu. So I had a lot of a

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40
cough and going on over here

Matthias Miller  1:17:55
all right, well jump in the end

Matthias Miller  1:18:07
payment ID for ACH. You guys just want to start going down through the list sir. Care Payment ID for ACH payments. I mean, I don't think there's really much to add to this

Matthias Miller  1:18:30
let me see. I mean, there's there is a

Unknown Speaker  1:18:38
we've seen

Matthias Miller  1:18:44
I think the biggest question would be what's your priority

Speaker 6  1:18:55
us sooner rather than later. It I didn't realize what was going on until just recently actually, but just with them all lumping together now I gotta go and just do a lot of math to figure out which is which so the sooner I can stop doing that. But let

Matthias Miller  1:19:15
me just take a look. Maybe now I'm going to change exactly what I said. But let's go to paid

Unknown Speaker  1:19:26
payment. Does that mean the payment that these are all the same?

Speaker 6  1:19:29
No, what I was doing is making them all so this would actually have been different. So if we have like ACH and then I want to put the date and that way everything that was paying on that day has the same ID so then I can see which ones go together.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:49
But why is it auto filling?

Speaker 6  1:19:53
The payment ID there's already a payment id space they Oh just doesn't autofill Josh was working On like he made so that the date autofills and like all this stuff and you hit the button that just fills up the man.

Speaker 7  1:20:06
But what is the payment? ID is it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:10
would be like a check number if it were a check

Unknown Speaker  1:20:16
or ACH or what I

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
want those just like ACH No, I I had just been putting in ACN

Speaker 7  1:20:23
all but you're wanting to fast to make so that it automatically goes ACH and that today's the day oh okay.

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
Yeah makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:35
Let me

Matthias Miller  1:20:48
source destination bch

Matthias Miller  1:21:02
each response

Matthias Miller  1:21:17
let's do this

Matthias Miller  1:21:26
you care how the data is formatted? Like

Speaker 6  1:21:31
I can just be formatted as the number if you want, you know like Oh 222 24 I really don't care.

Matthias Miller  1:21:41
What about 2402 22 That

Speaker 7  1:21:48
bad that's kind of like metrical standard. Everyone should date because it's

Matthias Miller  1:22:04
completely. Okay, I will. I'm gonna shoot yourself an email to myself. And it looks like a pretty straightforward change. All right. Standard police report status is we'd

Speaker 7  1:22:25
say March 15. At least on the GL. Account breakdowns. Does the same go for the employee addresses?

Speaker 8  1:22:32
Yes. On on number one, what

Speaker 7  1:22:35
is the timeframe on that? Are you thinking like live this weekend? Is it that month or?

Matthias Miller  1:22:43
Week? Three? Thank you. No, I think it's that minor.

Speaker 7  1:22:57
Good, so I have nothing else on to unless you mean, let's see two. Three, we already covered withdrawal. So

Matthias Miller  1:23:10
cash and credit card transaction reports. I thought I did

Speaker 7  1:23:14
get we haven't looked reason to sell. Okay. Should I

Matthias Miller  1:23:18
mean it should still be yes.

Matthias Miller  1:23:27
Transfers use the name of the account instead of the contact. Okay, transfers in and out. So basically, we had been saying we're excluding primary checking. From transfers now we're saying we're actually going to show both sides of the of the trans No.

Speaker 6  1:23:49
We're, we're going against what we had decided before but not quite perfectly a little more perpendicular maybe 90 degree change. The issue is so we'd like to show money coming into their his account, like the primary checking account from the line of credit. But we'd like it to be in a transfer section not just as regular deposit and what I had seen was that we can we can make it show up in the regular deposit. Start shortening.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:32
Share time was the example if you go to share.

Speaker 6  1:24:50
So if you don't exclude that one, then it will show up as a deposit. But if you do exclude it, then it's not On the record at all.

Speaker 7  1:25:02
So now you see the farmer state banks we listed? Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:25:07
this one. Okay. So switch transaction IDs. This one is a give it didn't how transfers? How can we said the transfers work though? What type of

Speaker 6  1:25:32
see the normal transfers are? Assets? This one being a line of credit might function differently because of that.

Matthias Miller  1:25:42
It's probably right. What kind of liability? Yeah, but why wouldn't we just

Matthias Miller  1:25:55
is transfer transaction primary accounts, which is checking asset and liability

Unknown Speaker  1:26:13
for

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
you, but we're not showing all liability accounts, if we would say primary liability accounts, and we say we don't need.

Matthias Miller  1:26:53
So if we do this, okay, there's two things we could do one, we could turn on reconciliation for the line of credit, and then it would show up in your standard drop down. And when you do that, it would, then it shows up down here in the transfers.

Speaker 6  1:27:13
Okay. Okay. So it would be because it's not a it's not set as reconcile account?

Matthias Miller  1:27:21
Yes. I mean, so there are two. Sorry,

Speaker 6  1:27:25
I mean, it should be, it should be whether it is or not, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:27:31
Well, it's it's not so it's not. So if we, if we do that, then

Matthias Miller  1:27:43
if we, I wonder if we could actually get away.

Speaker 7  1:27:49
You're saying that you said to reconcile because you're going to work, you're going to reconcile that any.

Speaker 6  1:27:56
I mean, any of the any of the loans should be set to reconcile. So. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:28:03
You're gonna want to break out? Yeah. I think that's pretty straightforward, then in that case, and then ultimately, what we're doing on the transfer in versus transfer out, is if

Matthias Miller  1:28:26
these are all three primary accounts. And so if it is a if the I don't know how to think through it just just attach, but it's not bad.

Speaker 6  1:28:49
Mark, brick thought here. The transfers that we want to show are all liabilities, right? So should we put that in the terminology of the group? In other words, its liability, draw transfers and liability payment payments

Unknown Speaker  1:29:10
first. You mean interlinking? Damon's

Speaker 6  1:29:13
like no. The first section coming into the bank, we are drawing on a liability. Well,

Speaker 7  1:29:20
not all of them because like the the deposit only like the chief bank account transfer would mean I think it would be

Unknown Speaker  1:29:28
even those are going to show

Speaker 7  1:29:33
transfers in is saying here is something where we're transferring or adding money into the primary bank account.

Speaker 6  1:29:44
Right, but earn if if there's a if it got deposited into another bank account, like it could be the Chase Bank, it's going to be listed in that deposit section, isn't it? So Like I'm thinking it is only the liabilities that we want to be showing here, which is basically whether we are paying off liabilities or creating more liabilities. So

Speaker 7  1:30:13
let's take a look at that report again, just to see what if we go to the existing transfers? What do we have now? I think you're right. So we're paying down credit cards.

Matthias Miller  1:30:29
Hang on, let me show transaction ID. So we can look at the underlying. We're actually even better, let's do one better.

Matthias Miller  1:30:43
Let me

Speaker 6  1:30:46
because like that payment, yeah, that payment to the expense account is going to be duplicated as well. I mean, theoretically, this is a somewhat false report, because it's not, it's not based on time correctly. But

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
why would that be?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:08
That was listed as transfer out. All right. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:31:12
Okay, here's an example expense checking transfers. Okay, so.

Speaker 7  1:31:19
So there were taking money out, that would be a transfer out. Right, all of these would be transferred out, except the operating line of credit would be transferred in?

Speaker 6  1:31:33
Well, it couldn't be out to do you know which way those are? I mean, it's, it's positive, the same as the rest. But do we switch? The switch here? And that was part of the question was, that we're trying to solve here is, how do we know which way these are going?

Speaker 7  1:31:52
Yeah, you're looking at the transfers. Most of them are pretty explanatory. But like the line of credit, in a week, you might draw on it, you might pull money in, and then a customer makes it a bank deposit, and then you push money back out. Yeah, I think those, what you're saying to that those if we only in the transfers, we only look at liabilities. Then we,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:22
well, we're still

Speaker 7  1:32:26
but we're still showing those double like we could just as well like to we're paying down the say the lowest car, we might have five lowest charities up above as well.

Speaker 6  1:32:37
Right. But like, we're kind of showing them two things at once. Here's your business operation, expenses that you've incurred, or deposit coming in because of business operation. And then the transfers the liabilities and just here's what here's how you've been moving money to take care of liability. Like it's, it's a financing cash management, not a operations catchment.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:09
Like if we do distributions, where would those money transfer out?

Unknown Speaker  1:33:18
Yeah, maybe we should make that liabilities and equity.

Speaker 7  1:33:33
Why are you saying we shouldn't show money coming in from say, with Chase deposit account, like the lump sum, but we're showing the individual payments you're seeing that we shouldn't show but on the liability side, like the credit card charge, and then paying on the credit card we show that? That was?

Speaker 6  1:33:58
I mean, I guess it can be either way this is this is me trying to make a cash flow statement. And they're they're trying to there's no capital savings. I always want to know, like, I think every president was in their cash flow statement too much.

Matthias Miller  1:34:21
Oh, here's, here's an example. Tell me this is right. What you're looking for. Transfer in

Matthias Miller  1:34:34
transfer out

Speaker 7  1:34:38
Okay, so the 109,000 on one four. Do we not show that up here as well? No, we didn't. Okay. So, for this period, we removed 191,000 in to take on our line of credit and we paid back

Speaker 6  1:35:01
Learn us, you'd have to calculator but

Unknown Speaker  1:35:08
whatever that total is, we're paying that back in that timeframe. I think this is I mean, this is exactly what we want.

Speaker 6  1:35:16
And we can just, and we just leave it on there. And they just have to know that. You know, this is just a transfer from the expense checking, or to the expense checking.

Speaker 7  1:35:27
But here we have to like why do we have to transfer out the expense checking? Do we do to 2500?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:35
On the same day?

Matthias Miller  1:35:39
Yeah, we did. I mean, we say we did.

Speaker 6  1:35:49
We say we did, but okay.

Matthias Miller  1:35:55
Do different contact. This is voice access transfer doesn't have a contact on it. This one does. That's why we didn't catch the duplicate. Does

Unknown Speaker  1:36:02
either one of them have a? Neither one source record?

Matthias Miller  1:36:08
This is good. The PDF?

Speaker 6  1:36:13
Zumbro brand new guy forgot to they did it before? Probably duplicate transaction? Yeah. So probably what happened is, I saw it on the bank statement, and then later got a got an email with something the

Speaker 7  1:36:26
others. Like, if you look at the other secondary Chase, that means we paid off photography as the 21st loads, we fade that

Unknown Speaker  1:36:36
I think this will work.

Speaker 7  1:36:39
I mean, that on the liability side, or the the money coming in side. So it would be fair to say that on the money coming into the primary bank account. We're never double listing that. We're never listing that twice, like,

Speaker 6  1:37:00
no, um, we could like in the case of the chase, somebody for ABC, somebody deposits into Chase, and it shows up in our deposits. And then we transfer into the main checking account. But the exact opposite of this expense check.

Speaker 7  1:37:15
Are we not exploiting assets? asset accounts there, we have asset account transfers?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:20
Well, not here. We haven't. Oh, okay. Well, I think that's

Unknown Speaker  1:37:26
consistent, though. Like,

Speaker 6  1:37:28
I mean, we show it coming in as long as you know. I mean, it's an extra, it's just an explanation of, you know, these are just transfers from accounts are not operational. So there's a little bit of duplication. If I have let's

Speaker 7  1:37:41
take a quick look at Vinyl structures for this time frame and see if distributions I know there were some oddities. Those are, how those are shown.

Speaker 7  1:37:56
So with this change, that takes care of them, one of the credit thing that we look for

Matthias Miller  1:38:01
no idea what I want, and

Unknown Speaker  1:38:04
you don't even have them. Because they're all 30. Numbers. We're just totally excluding them.

Matthias Miller  1:38:17
Oh.

Matthias Miller  1:38:24
So you're wanting are these?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:28
Well, have you set them up already?

Speaker 6  1:38:31
Yeah, they're there. I mean, this is this is just going back to the cash flow statement. Is that what it's supposed to be? Like? You know, because that then is a I mean, it's kind of like financing. What is What are the three groups? There's operational financing

Unknown Speaker  1:39:04
anyway?

Speaker 6  1:39:07
I mean, are, what are they wanting to see? Are they wanting to see? Are they wanting to see the money they spent on expense accounts? Or are they wanting to see where their money went? Because Because our basis is all wrong here if we want to show them where our money went. Because Because these didn't even happen all in like, these didn't get the bank within this time period. They we said we want to buy this within this time period. And we're showing them as though they hit the bank and this time, like it's almost this is no no it's not. No, this is this is an expense listing of stuff that will at some point hit the bank

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
All this is like the bank register. Is it not? Like, we're on one? Like, Andre slave or here we said Miss day that our bank account is that we deposited this on to did we not?

Matthias Miller  1:40:21
It's like an unreconciled bank register, isn't it?

Speaker 6  1:40:24
So well, what's your what's your date range that you're looking for?

Matthias Miller  1:40:29
Just to January 1.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:33
To till now

Matthias Miller  1:40:34
I guess to Yeah. Future indefinite. Okay, we'll

Speaker 6  1:40:39
just, like pin it down to one week, once, because, like, the longer your span, the more accurately it's meant to be a cash flow statement.

Matthias Miller  1:40:49
All right, do you want to do as last week, as

Speaker 6  1:40:53
well? Do? We can January's it's more complete?

Matthias Miller  1:40:56
Sure. Alright, so let's do 121 to 127.

Speaker 6  1:41:15
So, like this date here, you know that first one on the 18th, so that'd be it was initiated or the, like the sale was the 18th. It hits on the 21st. It was

Matthias Miller  1:41:33
deposited on the 21st. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 6  1:41:39
Okay, so. Okay. All right, when I'm done talking, um,

Speaker 7  1:41:56
and then the charges would be, here's when you write out the check, or wrote out the check or whatever, when they do, but the point is, you know, totally dependent on

Speaker 6  1:42:05
Right. Right. So it's, well, yeah, and it's kind of a cross because we're never looking at which ones hit the bank and which ones didn't to me, you're saying we wrote these out all right. Um, so yeah, I mean, I guess we could just put a put an equity section in there or somehow select those equity accounts and just add them I would add them in the transfer steps.

Speaker 7  1:42:37
Yeah. In the transfers. So where do those if you do that, besides where do they show up that or how do they show up? I just

Matthias Miller  1:42:46
it would be

Matthias Miller  1:42:54
it would show up in I mean, we get here we make us show up equity accounts. Equity counts equity and then

Matthias Miller  1:43:25
Alright, so let's go see how this looks. So you do everything but retained and currently earnings. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:39
Yeah, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
And then, mean, here we have

Unknown Speaker  1:43:56
I would say that we weren't. I think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
Okay. Yeah.

Speaker 6  1:44:05
So and we're still we're still wanting to skip those sweep accounts. Right, like those?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:16
The I think so. Which

Speaker 6  1:44:18
is that is that simply a matter of not selecting them and in their

Matthias Miller  1:44:29
will sweep account isn't?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:32
Where is it? The

Unknown Speaker  1:44:34
sweep account should be an asset it should be.

Matthias Miller  1:44:38
Do you reconcile the sweep account? That's probably why it's not there. I mean, you know, not seeing a sweep account, named here. I'm not sure what it is for. What is

Speaker 6  1:45:03
Even I've written on it, I'm sure had well go to go to ABC.

Matthias Miller  1:45:11
I mean ABC yes there you have primary checking and it's it is a free Yeah. And then here you have your sweep account

Speaker 7  1:45:27
so by just exploiting the sweep account there you don't have that movement back or you could choose to exploit that movement back and forth right? Yeah.

Speaker 6  1:45:40
But it would if you include it, then it would show up which section was showing if you

Matthias Miller  1:45:48
include it, if you check it here it shows as a transfer if you uncheck it, it shows as a deposit. If you exclude it, you don't see it at all

Unknown Speaker  1:46:02
that's what we would do normally is just exclude

Speaker 7  1:46:05
so is this I mean, I think district board is gives us exactly what we're looking for. Is this something where this needs to go through an update saying or do we just would it make sense to just create this as a user report for drew for right now?

Matthias Miller  1:46:24
We can actually fairly easily let's see if

Matthias Miller  1:46:37
I can relatively easily push a lot push these changes live for you without an update right so it's a negative amount it'd be transferred out or charged otherwise it's transferring or positive

Matthias Miller  1:46:59
and what would you you would use it if you had it before tomorrow? What was that we would use it before tomorrow or Monday.

Speaker 7  1:47:16
I mean, we'd probably use it today if we would have it just while Drew is in office and we probably create a set of reports but that's not and then what works for you.

Matthias Miller  1:47:28
Now that works I can I think it's just as easy probably just to keep everything in sync ticket to get live and push a new version a new version out

Matthias Miller  1:47:47
me one moment I think if.

Matthias Miller  1:47:58
Now Alright, so we are just to recap the changes. Showing accounts for all transfers account names for all transfers, we are included allowing including you this needs to change.

Matthias Miller  1:48:33
Including prompting for equity accounts, and including those transfers.

Matthias Miller  1:48:45
If for negative amounts, negative transfers are transferred as out of the bottom negative other transactions or checks and charges right above it. The bill is going in reverse order positive transactions are transfers or transfer in positive transactions or payments

Unknown Speaker  1:49:12
All right. All right. I will

Matthias Miller  1:49:18
see if we can get that fish live before the end of the call. We can keep going. Um, number five payroll transaction imports. That one we said is going to be the 15th. Yeah, at this point unless we do something different.

Speaker 7  1:49:48
It is looking at our schedule for so if you say March 15 That would go live that weekend. Then we could use it for the 2018 like our 22nd Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:50:03
reconcile report issues addressed on the call earlier I believe check attachments should be already live this weekend invoice and account numbers on checks I did add the invoice number tax but this is might be something different we're what is what is seven B?

Speaker 6  1:50:32
Yeah, that's what I'm after. Okay. Yeah just you had made a comment that you were going to do something with it and it was just how the status is of that so that's why this weekend Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:50:49
Account Balance diagnostics All right, here comes the fun to that

Matthias Miller  1:51:01
so no, this is the wrong one

Matthias Miller  1:51:09
so let's see accounts. Let's do Accounts Payable Alright, the big thing I did was three make this because what three panes three panes is makes that vendor invoices are listed by themselves until they're paid and well until they're paid by cheque and at the point that they're paid by cheque they Oh come on

Unknown Speaker  1:51:47
this isn't live

Matthias Miller  1:51:53
it's right here this is as all the information as of last night but as soon as they get paid they get paid out to the check now here's one that doesn't balance out

Matthias Miller  1:52:26
we had this one has a five nine is coming from the check Wait a minute why is this not well 1-802-766-0101

Unknown Speaker  1:52:48
The credit

Matthias Miller  1:52:58
for six seven so these totals actually add up correctly Yeah, but these something's not getting included correctly here 1305 57

Matthias Miller  1:53:23
Sorry Well my dear okay so we have still included these two that's right it only included

Unknown Speaker  1:53:35
yes says I'm confused

Speaker 6  1:53:48
doesn't have the check amount is that what we're missing

Matthias Miller  1:53:55
so we have a credit EP off of that then we have a debit of 746

Matthias Miller  1:54:20
We don't have the original five and 5901 included in here

Speaker 6  1:54:29
because it was that would be a negative to accounts payable somehow someway

Matthias Miller  1:54:44
there was no transaction created for it.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:48
Was that right there? Isn't

Matthias Miller  1:54:50
I mean, this is the vendor invoice but oh, there's no

Unknown Speaker  1:54:53
trends. Got it.

Matthias Miller  1:54:56
So why not?

Matthias Miller  1:55:03
We have paid we have a payment date payment account

Unknown Speaker  1:55:12
something stopping it because it's negative or something

Matthias Miller  1:55:16
telling us should Alright, let's just roll this back and accounts payable is zero

Matthias Miller  1:55:42
so it's not excusing that one this should still have

Unknown Speaker  1:55:58
amount

Matthias Miller  1:56:03
this table is together some were 32

Unknown Speaker  1:56:19
Mmm

Matthias Miller  1:56:21
it's eating its own tail it's a debit and credit to and from Accounts Payable

Unknown Speaker  1:56:36
Dave how's it right Devin?

Unknown Speaker  1:56:44
Oh yeah. Should we expense accounts?

Matthias Miller  1:56:54
Yes, they should

Matthias Miller  1:57:01
let me make sure the live system is showing. Yeah. Well, I will you

Unknown Speaker  1:57:14
wonder how many more of those there are that were credits and this? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:57:22
Okay, well, that's why that one doesn't. So that the diagnostics actually working? Yeah. All right, well, Oh, you were wondering which other ones there were? Let's find them because there was one right, right below that. There were some others. This guy

Speaker 6  1:57:47
so if they're, if they're doing what they should, straight across there would be equal, right? Correct.

Matthias Miller  1:57:53
But here's an here's another one. No. recycling and waste removal. know maybe this is a different situation. So we've got Yeah, let's go all the way down. Like these guys. You know, everything's happy. And then we get to some time or gear. Well, it's probably just not paid. We get to hear and then it's like right, if there's an amount in both columns, and there's some kind of mismatch

Speaker 6  1:58:31
so amount in both columns means all right, they would have been paid for somehow in

Matthias Miller  1:58:40
15 minutes. Yeah. So let's go see this is this is about as good as the Sherlock Holmes novel mystery of the mismatch of this sort order is different isn't it

Matthias Miller  1:59:05
let's try going back to us. They guarantee there's one one Yeah, if for some reason Okay, those are those are not that one's good. That one's good. That one's good. So let's do this. I don't know why it's sorting sorting differently but let's let's do it definitely it's open to two copies of this. We can just search by amount are being

Speaker 8  1:59:42
given that try putting that on a holiday page and

Matthias Miller  1:59:48
when we look at this one here

Speaker 8  1:59:56
Oh 230 402 38 system calm.

Matthias Miller  2:00:02
Here we have

Matthias Miller  2:00:14
the waste removal Oh

Unknown Speaker  2:00:26
this was this now we have the

Unknown Speaker  2:00:34
food here on

Unknown Speaker  2:00:42
oh well it's good

Speaker 6  2:00:45
it's almost got to be somewhere again here because we are equal at the bottom of all of that so recovering they haven't threatened like somewhere what are the accounts on those This

Matthias Miller  2:01:01
one's account AP and recycling and waste that's correct me three but here we have this 915 That's not tied out anywhere but if we go into the let's go into the invoice for this one so here's the check here's the credit primary checking sales expense okay let's do this so it had an AP debit for 915 and any expense credit transactions

Matthias Miller  2:01:52
915 I wonder if this is not showing up in the report in the right place

Speaker 6  2:01:56
that should be the other way around there should no no it's right you're wrong

Matthias Miller  2:02:05
I'm gonna be faster to search for waste now it's not in the aggregate 915 915 Here it is. Okay this guy should have been grouped up with

Matthias Miller  2:02:26
this should have been grouped it up with the other transactions but it wasn't so why not

Matthias Miller  2:02:36
because if it would have been then everything would have been tied out so let's go take a look at how these things are grouped

Unknown Speaker  2:02:49
right

Unknown Speaker  2:02:54
yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:03:12
it's good to

Unknown Speaker  2:03:19
have you

Unknown Speaker  2:03:25
okay

Matthias Miller  2:03:40
okay, well not 100% convinced this is completely 100% accurate but it might be good enough for the sake of this report

Matthias Miller  2:03:54
where am i

Matthias Miller  2:04:14
We're gonna save this thing as a 402 22. Alright. And then we're gonna come back here and we are going to not show this is going to fix that one. This is just a problem with the report. It wasn't grouping that one payment in with the vendor invoice correctly. So now this one's off. Well, closer, so recycling and waste. So we should see Why is this not okay well that's alright let's go forward to 30 Now let's go back and see what's going on we're showing a negative

Unknown Speaker  2:05:19
way we doubled it

Matthias Miller  2:05:22
yeah we doubled it so

Unknown Speaker  2:05:53
so much

Matthias Miller  2:05:59
evening this is coming down to

Matthias Miller  2:06:41
subset count transaction might account so if this is the line for the AP if this is the AP line

Matthias Miller  2:07:21
we want to say

Matthias Miller  2:07:37
an account type equals asset or in count to equals liability then a

Matthias Miller  2:08:17
see body knows it's quite right

Unknown Speaker  2:08:25
yeah

Matthias Miller  2:08:49
if it is if we have a negative

Matthias Miller  2:09:03
maybe we shouldn't even do it like this maybe we should say

Matthias Miller  2:09:18
I don't know bottom line is

Matthias Miller  2:09:34
if not maybe we should break it down into debit and credit amounts okay. So if you have a multi sales order payment then it will go into undeposited funds which is an asset and so you want to show thee which which a payment will default in an increase of an asset so if the payment amount is positive then it would be a debit and if it's negative it would be a credit

Matthias Miller  2:10:43
so it would be a

Matthias Miller  2:10:50
let's do this sign B is debit so payment amount is greater than zero and let's just do as TF string

Unknown Speaker  2:11:07
either designated

Speaker 7  2:11:13
no this already exists you know already but information

Unknown Speaker  2:11:25
can save

Unknown Speaker  2:11:31
you save an awful lot to get seated.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:34
Right Is that right all right

Matthias Miller  2:11:44
so then on a deposit exactly the same logic if it's a positive amount it's a debit and if it's a negative amount it's a

Unknown Speaker  2:12:04
positive file documents I think

Matthias Miller  2:12:14
on a vendor invoice a vendor invoice

Matthias Miller  2:12:27
is the opposite it's a debit if you have a negative invoice certainly and then

Unknown Speaker  2:12:36
the this is a

Unknown Speaker  2:12:40
good zap so yeah

Matthias Miller  2:12:44
okay and then asked me some in credit some give

Speaker 8  2:12:58
me your card I'm telling you a favor spin invoice number two

Matthias Miller  2:13:05
and then

Speaker 8  2:13:07
invoice number already exists on price and let's get this off

Matthias Miller  2:13:24
push pop up but then we need to balance different steps normalize these because you can now end up with debits and credits overall both columns so the other way to do this would have been to say that it needs debits let's do this

Unknown Speaker  2:13:57
permission

Unknown Speaker  2:14:07
me there's

Unknown Speaker  2:14:10
it. Here's the box have just

Unknown Speaker  2:14:14
forgotten how to do this. Don't watch this.

Matthias Miller  2:14:17
Alright, so really what we can say is okay, the alternate amounts are positive we're debits and negative credits. Multi so payments that's normal this mean do this and then here update

Matthias Miller  2:14:51
positive vendor invoice totals or credits not debits. It's all Look at some of the buildings in magic okay and then here when we're looking to the debit minus credit equals all the time to stop here if here what we do is if it's greater than zero it's a debit yeah run by already you override less than zero saving

Matthias Miller  2:15:51
we don't do like now

Unknown Speaker  2:15:57
no tips yeah a

Matthias Miller  2:16:00
little bit of truth You didn't talk to you about that man

Speaker 7  2:16:03
can do the often short term No, but it has been a track and Kanima to me exactly this

Matthias Miller  2:16:13
either is going to work or it's going to be wildly off like that okay, now the problem is we've got on the 18th we've got showing up twice

Unknown Speaker  2:16:35
the net on file exists the

Matthias Miller  2:16:39
old existing there it's not showing up at all naturally 266

Unknown Speaker  2:16:45
Yeah, I think so on a

Unknown Speaker  2:16:49
beach What did I do

Matthias Miller  2:16:59
this is the same

Unknown Speaker  2:17:00
out what

Unknown Speaker  2:17:07
would you can do it

Matthias Miller  2:17:11
doesn't make sense. Democratic multiplayer isn't that relevant anymore

Unknown Speaker  2:17:21
why would that have

Matthias Miller  2:17:29
you're we should never have any rows with duplicates you should listen

Unknown Speaker  2:17:46
since already since I rarely tell people because

Matthias Miller  2:17:57
I I am so confused

Unknown Speaker  2:18:04
in Excel

Matthias Miller  2:18:08
Oh, wow.

Matthias Miller  2:18:17
double negatives don't anyway, gets in trouble. All right.

Matthias Miller  2:18:32
Message me that. Okay. So that one's happy now. So that one's still off, which we expect now. This one we have to 60 to 60.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:51
So, this

Unknown Speaker  2:18:53
is just not originally in class. So

Matthias Miller  2:18:56
let's go back into 208. Here's the check. Here's the 208

Unknown Speaker  2:19:10
So we

Matthias Miller  2:19:12
went on to we're paying two away but it never showed up in

Speaker 6  2:19:15
Oh, it's not it's not connected somehow. Well,

Matthias Miller  2:19:19
it's an old it's before we even started. Got

Unknown Speaker  2:19:22
it. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  2:19:25
We want somewhere we really missed an invoice. Six months later, we paid it. So seven months.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:34
So can we just Wow Can we still have

Unknown Speaker  2:19:42
the Wow.

Speaker 6  2:19:46
Well, we can just move. Can we just moved that date into the current? Yes. Like this just goes back to what may or something? Something 17 I don't know that that will be wonderful. You had a problem

Matthias Miller  2:20:12
Oh, you're okay so theoretically come on okay but here's the thing Oh

Unknown Speaker  2:20:25
pathline in the flow CNN revision revision sin fishnet no usually and check on it definitely come on got the out

Matthias Miller  2:20:43
okay, this guy get 150

Unknown Speaker  2:20:51
Welcome to Chico

Matthias Miller  2:20:58
what's going on here?

Speaker 6  2:21:00
So this is another credit that's not in the right place or connected let me let's do because that 168 would match the payment for those other two

Matthias Miller  2:21:19
okay that's that's an A raw materials it's a vendor invoice source record also vendor invoice FTI this one there's this guy

Speaker 6  2:21:36
yes you're in the wrong spot all right, I

Matthias Miller  2:21:40
will send you this guy it's like as well

Matthias Miller  2:21:56
all right

Matthias Miller  2:22:02
let's just go straight to the sea it's off by about 301 A 3d Seven The 395 Isn't there

Unknown Speaker  2:22:15
so

Unknown Speaker  2:22:22
you

Matthias Miller  2:22:28
Yeah, and this Okay, so there's that one

Unknown Speaker  2:22:33
so we're the same like

Speaker 6  2:22:42
Yeah, so I don't really know how many other bugs there could be

Matthias Miller  2:22:50
so it seems like the next place to start

Matthias Miller  2:22:59
I don't know this needs to be if we need a better report or not but we can at least do

Speaker 6  2:23:08
vendor invoices will chase their tail. Exactly.

Matthias Miller  2:23:15
count equals

Matthias Miller  2:23:23
Oh no, no, what is it current liabilities liabilities

Unknown Speaker  2:23:33
next one right now. Accounts Payable Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:23:37
All right. So let's do something like the invoice date and be the invoice vendor and the invoice amount

Unknown Speaker  2:23:48
be invoiced?

Matthias Miller  2:24:03
Well, it looks like it's happening quite a bit

Matthias Miller  2:24:10
so,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:11
well there were a lot of credits just last this week last week for a night

Speaker 6  2:24:26
and I'm pretty sure I already sent them a thing about how it's supposed to be done.

Matthias Miller  2:24:32
Okay, well here let's do let's let's make their life just so easy. They don't even know what to do with themselves.

Matthias Miller  2:24:46
Okay, vendor invoice.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:07
All right so then

Matthias Miller  2:25:12
I guess I will leave this in your court and I think the bottom line is I need to make my fixes to the account balance diagnostic it appears to me like it's now working as expected and we've got some cleanup to do

Unknown Speaker  2:25:31
Yeah

Speaker 6  2:25:32
Okay fantastic

Matthias Miller  2:25:58
your invoice okay let me do

Matthias Miller  2:26:13
it all right your cash and card transactions live now vendor and company mismatch

Speaker 6  2:26:38
Yeah Mark had brought that up and I know we had talked about it and that was like I'm not sure if we ever came to any conclusion on that thing.

Matthias Miller  2:26:45
No, I'm pretty sure we didn't

Unknown Speaker  2:26:50
here let me

Matthias Miller  2:26:53
before I forget let me

Matthias Miller  2:27:09
Alright, so let me pull this up

Matthias Miller  2:27:59
so we have

Matthias Miller  2:28:12
the problem is that the PIO is getting posted to one company and the vendor invoice to another is that right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:18
I think that's like that, yeah, that's probably the root of it.

Matthias Miller  2:28:30
Couldn't we say that the moment that a Pio gets tied to a vendor invoice, it gets tied to the accounting company that pays it no matter who ordered it
