Matthias Miller  01:14
Expert, I am on Zoom and ready to go. Let me know. Expert, I am on Zoom and ready to go, and I will need to drop at the bottom of the Hour. I

Matthias Miller  04:13
Potentially, yes. Can you message me around the and.

Unknown Speaker  05:09
Let me see what's going on.

Matthias Miller  05:30
Paul strauston palette,

Unknown Speaker  05:46
hey, Amanda, this is Matthias, good. How are you?

Matthias Miller  05:55
I am is he running around there somewhere?

Unknown Speaker  06:00
All right, thanks. I,

Speaker 1  06:41
on legal. Too bad, because it's not when you because it's not to say.

Matthias Miller  07:01
I mean, it's co host that link slash, zoom,

Unknown Speaker  07:10
Okay, sounds Good. Dot. Link slash,

Matthias Miller  07:19
yep, All right, thanks

Unknown Speaker  07:29
for Waiting.

Speaker 2  07:41
Know, just make sure.

Speaker 1  08:19
Then science students, think he

Speaker 1  08:30
runs a budget in science the last time, because they tried everything else. And

Unknown Speaker  08:41
I need to add in fact that I

Unknown Speaker  08:46
need to add

Unknown Speaker  08:48
agenda six My minutes. Up

Unknown Speaker  09:24
my views, but

Speaker 3  09:40
on. Hey, MERV, hey, buddy. How you doing? Man, it's.

Speaker 4  10:11
Um, so yeah, I have

Unknown Speaker  10:17
wish couple things. Matt, um,

Unknown Speaker  10:28
how you doing? On your side?

Matthias Miller  10:30
I'm doing good. I've been it's been a little. It's been a crazy few days.

Unknown Speaker  10:35
Sure, we

Matthias Miller  10:39
we hit 80 grand on our auction, and we netted about 15 off of the Friday Night Dinner.

Unknown Speaker  10:47
So yeah, would you hit total?

Matthias Miller  10:51
Total probably just right around, just just shy of 100 grand, somewhere pretty close to that.

Speaker 3  10:59
So yeah, that's awesome. It's a lot of work, ain't it? It is, sure is. Man, it takes a lot to generate 100 I know it just does. Yeah, we just did it. We just did our school auction. And, I mean, we had a really good auction. A lot of stuff showed up, you know, I think we netted 140 something. Well, I mean, this is an auction with a much bigger school than what you guys have, and lot more people so, and that's part, and that was a lot of work. So it's, yeah, no, you guys are doing good, but that it's debated. It's debatable on the, you know, if it's a school fundraiser, I know yours is more than school weight, but as a school fundraiser, sometimes I wish they'd just add a little more on tuition. And let's save our save some evenings and Saturdays for for more whatever family stuff.

Matthias Miller  11:58
But it's so inefficient to take sponsor dollars, turn it into product and turn it, turn it around and resell it, and hope for that it goes for, you know, close to retail. I mean, it's just, you want to talk about, let's not look at it from an efficiency standpoint. It's just, it's playing with the human emotion and getting them to give money like that's I don't know.

Speaker 3  12:25
I know. I'm not I'm actually not a big fan of it. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of exhausting.

Matthias Miller  12:38
My wife and I can barely find anything even to buy. But, I mean, our worlds are so different than whatever everybody else is, but whatever it's, it's, it brings people together. That's the upside. I don't know. I know

Speaker 3  12:50
it does, it does bring I know there's a community element to it that's that seemingly is valuable.

Speaker 4  13:01
I don't know. I'm not sure, yep, so are you chase?

Speaker 3  13:11
Are you ready? Are you good? Are you ready for for career change?

Matthias Miller  13:14
What are you looking at?

Speaker 3  13:19
I just came out of a manager's meeting here. Yeah, tough tough crowd, man, tough crowd.

Unknown Speaker  13:27
Jeez. Guys are brutal,

Speaker 3  13:34
brutal, man, I'm sick. It's crazy. Only what is wow. Anyway, is what it is. So I'll try and,

Unknown Speaker  13:49
yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:53
Well, you know, I'm always up for adventure. So

Speaker 3  13:55
Well, that's I keep that adventurous band. I mean, I mean to that, yeah, today in the meeting. I mean, we were in the middle managers meeting and talking about incentives for next week. And right in the middle of, you know, everybody that's here, Rick's like, I just don't think silver limbs accurate enough. He's like, I'm just skeptical because it doesn't have the lumber in it. And just yesterday, we talked through it all him and I in the office over there. This is a system. Here's how you do. Oh no, it was last week like he needs to be on the lumber side. Just go by the daily lumber sales. We know it's not real time, but at least we have the daily numbers and and, and add that to the silver loom results, and that's what we got. And yep, he agreed to when they were sitting in a manager meeting. And he's telling everybody, I'm just skeptical of silver loom and Merv, I know it's your baby. Yada yada. Don't take this wrong way. Gee man, you.

Matthias Miller  15:00
Dude, I just, I just take that as an invitation. I'm like, All right, man, you want it accurate? Help me make it accurate. Let's go like, let's make it happen. Yeah, I'm game. I love working with these guys. I don't know why it's one of the things that it's one of the wires that God probably crossed wrong when he made me, but CFOs and their and they're all that stuff, like, totally man. Like, let's figure it out. Get to the bottom of it. And, you know, I'm not, I'm not scared to to me. It's just like, it's not accurate. Let's fix it. Like, show me where it's wrong. Let's figure out why. And it's, it's very solvable, like,

Speaker 3  15:42
well, he said it's because of because he knows there's a couple items that aren't showing the value as they they, they're doing the work, but the value is not attached to it. And one of them is a 4840s which you and I got to talk about today. I said, what else is it? He said, Oh, there's another one. And then after the meeting, he got it. He said, It's a Basset. It's not showing a value, okay? I'll look at it. You know, that's why, that's all I could come up with. So, I'll look at it. Oh, we'll fix it, and we won. He's not like it. He's just not helping,

Unknown Speaker  16:14
yeah, oh,

Speaker 3  16:16
I'm sick of it, man, if you, if you would live here, if you would live here, Matt, if you would live here, and you would volunteer, you would present yourself, and we could land on a on an on a price that makes sense both sides, I'd be all in right now.

Matthias Miller  16:42
All, I would be too. Problem is, we don't have those conditions. I'm out here and you're there, I know,

Unknown Speaker  16:55
yeah, so Cut The Chase.

Speaker 3  17:02
I can't. I gotta try to keep my emotions out of it. Can't I'm I'm not always able to do that completely. So,

Unknown Speaker  17:13
yeah, you're human too. Apparently, apparently,

Speaker 3  17:20
well, they remind me many, yeah. So I get reminded a lot. So, yes, yes. Um, so the point the big one Matt on, on the sawing, on the cut list generator. Let me go. This is a different thing here.

Speaker 4  17:41
I I'm not sure what I was looking I'll get on this one note,

Unknown Speaker  17:55
looking at this items. One that came up was

Unknown Speaker  18:08
right here,

Speaker 3  18:13
in the multiplier. You seeing this? Yep, okay, in a multiplier. So George had in here. He had, oh, let me back up. There was this particular palette calls for six pieces, 1116, three and a half, 48 it's what it actually is. Is a two by four that gets split in half, two by four. Actual measurement is one and a half by three and a half. Split that one and a half, you got 211, 16. He had this number where six at three and 1116, by three and a half. He was calling that two by four, which, well, no, he had six two by fours. And the reason he had six in there was because in the multiplier, it's not accurately multiplying the from one machine to the other, for some reason, apparently not, seemingly not, do.

Matthias Miller  19:21
Um, so you would start with three inch and a half by three and a half, 611, 16 by three and a half. Correct?

Unknown Speaker  19:37
The saw one

Speaker 3  19:40
is that saw one raw material sawing. Can tech saw one multipliers one, so yields Well,

Matthias Miller  19:52
yields one, and then the pen, the monster saw you or the pen do splitter yields two or total of six?

Unknown Speaker  19:59
Right? Venue splitter is two total of six, but if you go to it's not showing up that way in the sawing list.

Unknown Speaker  20:20
Oh, can I do

Unknown Speaker  20:27
completed items?

Speaker 3  20:36
I'm not sure if there's one of those is in here, right now

Matthias Miller  20:41
I'm seeing there was one for there's one scheduled.

Speaker 3  20:47
Okay, we can look at that. Where's that? What date is that?

Matthias Miller  20:52
It's at the top of the penduce just do just it's the top of the pendu splitter section, or the bottom of the pending splitters scroll down a little bit. Yeah.

Speaker 3  21:09
Well, splitters, where it gets multiplied the

Matthias Miller  21:14
can tag

Unknown Speaker  21:21
there it is, 12 146

Unknown Speaker  21:30
Wait, 1240 is the quantity.

Speaker 3  21:40
See, this isn't right. This should be saying, three,

Unknown Speaker  21:46
two by 431,

Speaker 3  21:48
and a half by three and a half by 48 is what this should say. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:07
It means that we it

Matthias Miller  22:15
means that we have to, I it

Matthias Miller  22:29
means that we have to have dimensions after

Speaker 3  22:49
Well, apparently this number is showing up in canteac. But the reality, the reality is that

Unknown Speaker  23:13
this inch and a half by three and a half by 48 eight.

Unknown Speaker  23:24
So

Matthias Miller  23:26
need, we need raw material. I mean, ultimately, what we need to do is we need to be able to put raw material dimensions in for saw one and saw two. Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:52
so

Matthias Miller  23:53
go ahead. No, go ahead. I mean, that's what we need.

Speaker 3  23:56
That's what we got to do, which is you're proposing is that I can't I thought we had this figured out when we said when we designed this. I'm wondering if we are just not entering the right information, or do we need to change the design?

Matthias Miller  24:14
Well, because, because we're looking to group Well, hang on. I

Matthias Miller  24:23
were we just expecting?

Matthias Miller  24:36
I think we were just expecting that the guides know that on the that that that's the raw material they should be using, I suppose. I mean just off the off the miscellaneous prep, that that's what they should do. Um,

Unknown Speaker  25:03
right? This should say two by four, or whatever, inch and a half by three and a half, split, 1116, to me, that's what it should say in here.

Matthias Miller  25:20
And it's not like I'm trying to remember

Speaker 3  25:25
this raw material info was it? Is this typed in? Is this item specific? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  25:34
so it's for all the saws. But yes, well,

Speaker 3  25:38
how do we? Because off the cantek, because it's going to splitter. The yield on the cantek is different than the yield on the splitter. The splitter is going to yield us the 11/16 by three and a half 48 that we need, right? But the can tech is going to yield something different. What it's showing now is it's showing the same thing as the as the splitter is right, six, right, three, yeah.

Matthias Miller  26:19
So if you don't want to just put comments in the raw material info or in the miscellaneous prep, then what we need to do is, when you specify a multiplier, if you scroll down a little bit, it's almost easier to visualize.

Unknown Speaker  26:35
Yeah, right, right, right.

Matthias Miller  26:38
If you specify a multiplier, then you have to specify the starting dimensions, right? I mean, that's the

Unknown Speaker  26:46
No, that's fine. Where do we put that starting dimension?

Matthias Miller  26:50
After between saw one and saw one multiplier, and also between saw two and saw two multiplier.

Unknown Speaker  26:59
Oh, what about the raw material info?

Speaker 3  27:11
Well, I'm trying to think while we put that in there, because we have miscellaneous prep.

Unknown Speaker  27:24
Well, no, it's because

Speaker 3  27:29
trying to think there, but on the like we use on our old schedule, we would have, we would have a line above, just like the sizers, a line above, telling what cans we're using. The line above would tell us what the raw material to cut, then the second row, which is what you need, the amount of pieces and the size was the second row. So the raw material info is fine for three and a half, heat treated pine. It's a two by four. It should have three and a half. But what we're yielding at what we're Yeah, we're trying to get inch and a half by three and a half by 48 off the canteen and then splitter. We're trying to get the final, which is 1116, three and a half, 48 Yep. So I don't think, as far as I'm concerned, we don't need to add it after splitter. What if we have more solves, more multipliers? So then I guess we do.

Matthias Miller  28:31
They allow two multipliers. And so that's why I'm suggesting we add it for

Speaker 3  28:35
Go ahead. Would you say about two multipliers?

Matthias Miller  28:39
We only allow multiplying on solid one and two. Okay, and so that's why I'm proposing that we allow it for both. Because I'm assuming there's a situation in which you multiply it on solid one, in which case you do have to handle it there as well.

Speaker 3  29:01
Yeah. I mean me, yeah, maybe,

Speaker 3  29:12
if it's not a, if it doesn't use the multiplier, then it does

Unknown Speaker  29:18
well, you don't need,

Speaker 3  29:19
at this point, Matt, everything, everything is yielding the quantity and dimensions, right? Right there in the beginning, right?

Matthias Miller  29:29
That's the yield, but not the raw material, correct, right?

Speaker 3  29:33
But, but whether it's in the whether it is multiplied or not, this is what's showing up as the end piece, correct? So the only time we would need a different end piece is

Unknown Speaker  29:48
if it was

Speaker 3  29:52
split, like if it was if there was a two step process, I guess, in other words, rather than a. It's repeating, because

Matthias Miller  30:02
dimensions are not raw material dimensions, it's the finished dimensions. So we only need those dimensions as So really, all we need is saw one yield thickness, saw one yield etc,

Speaker 3  30:16
yeah, if it's different, if it's different, yeah. We only need it on items where it's split, yeah, or, like, for example, anyway, comes off of the L and M, or the web situation, where it comes off a gang saw, then it goes, like, it comes off a size or then it goes over into sawing, and then it gets cut in the shorter pieces, because the gang saw can only cut things down to like 22 inches. So if we're cutting seventeens, for example, we have to take it from the gang saw, stack it there, and then take it over to this to the other, pop up saws and cut it shorter, which that's a step that we're not we're actually not capturing right now, because it's sizers over here, and then it's sawing on the other and then we're not bridging that

Unknown Speaker  31:18
Currently,

Matthias Miller  31:21
I gotta, I gotta drop I gotta drop over.

Matthias Miller  31:28
Okay, do you I can? Know I can, I should be free in about 30 to 60 minutes. I can text you.

Unknown Speaker  31:39
That's fine, yeah, okay, thank you, sir. All right, bye.
