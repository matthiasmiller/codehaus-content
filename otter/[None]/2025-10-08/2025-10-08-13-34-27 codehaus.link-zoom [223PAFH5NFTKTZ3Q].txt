Unknown Speaker  00:52
Hello again.

Unknown Speaker  00:54
Let's go share.

Matthias Miller  00:59
Okay, so so the only hole I can think of in our proposal is, do we need to have two separate raw material fields?

Unknown Speaker  01:18
Um,

Unknown Speaker  01:24
no,

Speaker 1  01:26
no, because we're taking lumber from step one to step two, which changes the every some of the steps change the dimensions or the so step one, the goal on step one, or the yield on step one, is one thing, but then to take that yield and step two will be a different yield.

Matthias Miller  01:56
So it will be the final yield. The final

Speaker 1  01:59
yield is the item is what's in that item in for it's what's in here already. It's, oh, shoot on that thing here. I'm sorry, yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:10
it's all good. But because the saw two is the only one with the multiplier, it means, by definition, saw two will have the final yield,

Speaker 1  02:20
sure. But I'm again, I'm just thinking of all the other items where there's not multipliers, final yields the same, right? So yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:29
right. It'd be the same the whole way through. Yeah,

Speaker 1  02:34
you're saying soul. Soul. One can't be a multiplier.

Matthias Miller  02:38
It can, but if solve one's a multiplier, then you have the same yields the whole way through as well.

Speaker 1  02:48
Okay, so here's MX 10, here's this is the same thing, Matt, like the random the half by 4048, there's actually another question there. I need to ask you about that decimal point, shoot. Let me jot that quick,

Speaker 1  03:14
well, quick bunny trail right here in the quantity 1.5 um, we're saying a full layer is 40 inches. The length is for the length of the material is 48 a layer is 40 inches. The coverage that we need is 60. So in order to get 60 out of 40, we have to do 1.5 layers, 1.5 times 40 if you go to sewing cut list for that same job on a new splitter. Here it is mx 10, half by 4040. It's saying two, essentially two layers. The 1.5 is getting rounded up to two. Um, can we make a an allowance for a decimal point there? Um,

Speaker 1  04:34
I think the decimal point would be a direct correlation to what's entered in the item information, item data, like it wouldn't be a calculation anywhere along the process. It would just be a instead of full numbers, there'd be times where it's there's a decimal. Point with yeah one digit on the end.

Matthias Miller  05:08
Let me just go ahead and

Speaker 2  05:15
decimal point and

Unknown Speaker  05:25
oh two.

Matthias Miller  05:42
It's not going to change on the cut list, because we're not storing a decimal point. We're rounding it when we store it, I can,

Speaker 2  05:53
I can edit it, edit after.

Unknown Speaker  06:01
So okay,

Matthias Miller  06:05
I can edit it after the I can manually edit it afterward, after it goes live too. That's not a big deal. But then the five is actually 4.5 Well, no, that's a different dimension.

Unknown Speaker  06:20
Okay? I

Matthias Miller  06:22
think, I think we're good. I'm good on that,

Speaker 1  06:25
okay, yeah, because down here, this other MX 15 and MX eight, those are going to be same thing. They're going to change. Okay, got Got it. Got it. That's good there.

Speaker 1  06:50
So you're going to add, is that you're going to add a decimal? Is that right?

Speaker 1  07:02
Can you hear me, Matt? And yes, I will, sorry, sorry, I didn't know if you heard me or not. Actually, I don't know if I did hear you. Um, okay, um, back to this other Here we go.

Speaker 2  07:20
Your

Speaker 1  07:28
last question, what? Well, that I'm confused because we have saw one multiplier and saw two multiplier.

Matthias Miller  07:41
You can multiply. Let's see if we have anything. Let me see if we have anything that multiplies in the first step.

Unknown Speaker  07:58
Probably not. I

Unknown Speaker  08:18
There's you say there's not

Matthias Miller  08:22
the fairway for let me go to see what this is for.

Unknown Speaker  08:28
EU, sorry.

Speaker 1  08:32
UK, I keep glitches off your audio.

Unknown Speaker  08:35
Hang on. I

Matthias Miller  08:47
The audio is better on here, but it feels like I'm flying an airplane. Oh, the the on the on the fairway for pu you can laugh at me.

Speaker 1  08:59
You're you're flying an airplane. Bro, this thing, I said, this thing's gonna fly. We're getting we're getting this. I just landed an old, rickety, jacked up thing with a prop on the front. I'm taking off in a freaking jet. Let's go,

Matthias Miller  09:17
Man game on.

Speaker 1  09:20
Henceforth your silver loom icon, as you can see

Matthias Miller  09:23
exactly, rocket ship. Let's go the the go pull up the fair fairway. Four pu you.

Matthias Miller  09:45
All right, and then scroll down, down, down, all right, right. There we have it going straight to this first piece goes straight to the slaughter. Saw.

Unknown Speaker  10:04
Mmm,

Unknown Speaker  10:06
but it's not multiplying.

Matthias Miller  10:11
So we end with a three quantity. The raw material quantity is 1.5 what that that's,

Unknown Speaker  10:29
is there any others? Is that the only one

Matthias Miller  10:31
that's, that's the only one? Oh

Unknown Speaker  10:32
my gosh, that's weird. Let me check with George. Hang on stitch. All right. I

Unknown Speaker  10:43
There we go.

Unknown Speaker  11:00
Apparently he's Not at his desk. George copy.

Speaker 1  11:20
I Sorry, kicking hold of him. Matt, I uh, let me look at it. So we got 23 nice to think 546, is whatever we're getting them out of the is this in sawing, or is this in wait?

Unknown Speaker  11:42
Size or sizer is okay, so it's Brewer. Saw one sizer, raw material, 1.5

Unknown Speaker  11:59
makes no sense at all. I don't get

Matthias Miller  12:04
it. Not much. Let me

Speaker 1  12:06
look here, what's this? What's he got here? Five, 696, someone gets slotted slaughter Saul. I

Unknown Speaker  12:23
I gotta, I have to ask George about this one me, one second I

Speaker 1  12:57
George. George Fay, please stop by the conference room. George, please stop by the conference room when you have a moment. Thank you, sir. Good. Sorry, Matt, I don't know there. Um, can we go down another route for a stitch? 48 by four minute. Jump on my other silver limb window. Here. I'm going to look at this item, 48 by 40 it's a stock item, all right, right. Here, 48 by 40 Grade A, repair. 4040 Grade B, repaired. John is not recording A's and B's. It is a potentially difficult thing to do, because when they repair palettes, they're doing A's and B's in the same time frame. So if we go to wait, I need to go to Analysis Report tracker. I need to get a tracker. Um, there we go, 4040, gray days.

Speaker 1  14:19
So what John has been doing is what John's known to do. He's putting entering everything as grade A's. So my question is, guys are doing I'm gonna have to go back in history. He hasn't attached any of these. No, these have been attached to any orders at this point. Okay, neither, not, not the not so important right now. Here's a work order. Here's George. I'm going to skip back to the other question, Matt. That is George on fairway, on Fair. Away, we have the multiplier. So saw two, multiplier like the meridian and RW IMT. Saw two is the splitter, or we're splitting it. We're multiplying a piece for getting more yield than off of saw one. Matt's question, do we

Speaker 3  15:27
ever use I had it in there. I had it l m, yeah, and then splitter, yeah. I had the L M as one, and the splitter right,

Speaker 1  15:36
two. The question coming up is, do we ever use a multiplier for Saul one like and then Matt found one, and it was this guy right here, this fairway. It's the, let me go back over here, 1116, 916, 546, is some get slotted. And for some reason, we're showing, well, if I go scroll over here, it's not to get smaller cut on a brewer. For some reason, on raw material, quantity, we're saying one and a half on the slaughter Sol one. We're saying multiplier, but that doesn't seem that's just a typo. Mate, would you say that's a typo? So put a one there.

Speaker 3  16:34
I wouldn't put anything. We're not doing that multiply.

Speaker 1  16:38
Okay? So yield. Well, then how do I get rid of this? How do I get rid of that 1.5 number? Does that automatically go away?

Matthias Miller  16:49
Matt, yeah, if you change the, if you change the, if you change that, yes, it does.

Speaker 1  16:55
So now I have saw one single head, not sure, no multiplier.

Matthias Miller  17:01
But then there's another row in here that has a multiplier. Unsaw One like if you scroll right,

Matthias Miller  17:17
right there the second one,

Unknown Speaker  17:18
okay,

Unknown Speaker  17:21
same thing, yep,

Speaker 1  17:28
that's what, all, right. But I just want, want to make sure make

Matthias Miller  17:31
sense, so we could Okay, so we can get rid of the cell one multiplier,

Unknown Speaker  17:35
right? Okay, sure, yes,

Speaker 3  17:38
oh no wait, because if I do two by fours.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
So I got i n t,

Speaker 3  17:46
no, I n t, 1020, okay, see what that says on there. I mean, just we're cutting them on the can tech as one, and we're splitting them on the splitter as two. Here we go. So that would be where you're out to 48 so you've got so can tech, or can tech, Saul one? Can tech, right? I got a multiplier. Keep going out well, but that's one of these guys are working on,

Speaker 1  18:22
yeah, but, yeah, but you're not like, right? Here it is. You're not multiplying it on the contact. You're just mold it's getting multiplied on splitter, right?

Speaker 3  18:31
So you don't need that one, because it's telling you that's one, two by four, and then if you do it on the splitter, it's 211, 16. So, I mean identifying it on the soil list, right?

Speaker 1  18:47
But again, we're not It's not being multiplied on soul one. We know it's being multiplied on the splitter, but the fact that it's being multiplied on saw two. Excuse me, it's being multiplied on Sol two, therefore the yield off of Sol one should be less pieces than the yield, or a larger size than the yield on like the yield off of Sol two, we're getting two out of one. So that means the size that we yielded on saw one is twice the size.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
Does it recognize? This?

Speaker 1  19:36
Is that at all? Should we just do a manual? Does that need to be a manual entry, right? I guess Matt, is that? What are your Do you have a proposal?

Matthias Miller  19:44
Matt, okay, run, yeah, catch, catch me up to what's going on here.

Speaker 1  19:49
Saw two. So we've eliminated the need for a multiplier on salt. One. Okay, so saw two. Yield is ex. Exactly what we need to make the palette, which is 611, 16, three and a half, 48 that's all to yield. Yep, the fact that it's a molded the multiplier is two. That means, that means we started with something other than 1116, three and a half, 48 that means the yield on the yield on salt one was a different size than the yield on salt too, because salt two, because it's a multiplier, so salt two increased our quantity times two. So we started with three pieces, we ended up with 611, 16, three and a half by 48 so we started with three. What? What did we start with? It could have been 1116, three and a half, 90 sixes. It could have been inch and a half by three and a half, 48 it could have been 1116, by seven by 48 right? Yeah.

Speaker 3  20:58
But in your sewing prep, right? Prep. That tells you taken out of the two before, slow, after the

Speaker 1  21:08
miscellaneous prep song, right? See, it's

Speaker 3  21:12
right, but that's zero. I'm saying two, right? He wanted me to change the internet. And then you're splitting the 18 sixteens. But after saying 1116 and then when it comes on, the soloist, take 1116 three and a half, 48 right? Split 1116 well, they're already 1116 so that's when I rate in their 204, 45 just so them guys know what they're right? I'm not going to split 11/16 and 1116

Speaker 1  21:40
No, right, but, but in order to fix this, like on the what's the goal? Right now? What's the goal on the cantek? Because if, if I go to the sewing list, the can text showing it needs six pieces, 1116, three and a half, and then the splitter is also showing six, which is right, but the context not so somehow we have to get that data into here, saying, What are we trying to get off the cantek, so we either type it into this sewing, miscellaneous prep and use that as the end to is this inch and a half of three and a half heat treated pines that's showing up on the cut list above the like we always have, just like the sizers we have cans above. And then here's what you're trying to cut. So this is out of there.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
Well, they're back to the comet. You know when you have to hear me say comment,

Unknown Speaker  22:42
what's the silver?

Unknown Speaker  22:45
Go down the song schedule, cut list, and then go, what are you can tech? Are you looking at

Speaker 1  22:53
splitter? Well, either one can't. Let's go to cantek first. Since that's first step, I gotta get my schedule. It's scheduled. Wait, that's not I thought that Meridian was in here.

Speaker 3  23:05
Well, just go to sign schedule and you'll it's already in there.

Unknown Speaker  23:12
Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  23:13
You get on the Undo splitter.

Unknown Speaker  23:21
Sorry. Where we at here?

Speaker 3  23:23
Half inch right down there, at the bottom right there. So it's inch and a half, three and a half heat treated pine. Oh, right here. Yeah. So Roy, I gotta change that. Well, you'd have to put two by 445, there instead of inch and a half. That's going to

Speaker 1  23:41
turn into splitter. No, right, right. It's what this what,

Speaker 3  23:52
and see what I've been doing is just right in two before 45 above the split on 16th temper, or until we figure out.

Speaker 1  23:58
But really, George the this the raw material for saw two, which is this, the scrolling here, wait, oh, no, I'm sorry I missed the pendu split, or raw material. Hey, this is a bunny troll. I'm sorry, guys, George, would you like this pendu splitter being a larger font than the rest, or do the guys? Are the guys able to look for huge you're good, yeah, that's nothing that you know. Fine, sorry, um, again, the pendu splitter, the raw material here should be what came off the cantek. What came off the cantek was an instant Apple three and a 48 inch heat treated, fine,

Speaker 3  24:47
yeah, but you don't have separate entries for everything. You got your raw material sewing and you got your

Speaker 1  24:57
so this morning prep. Okay, let's go to cantek. Right here.

Unknown Speaker  25:04
Where's that?

Speaker 1  25:06
What's the one here? Right, right here, inch and a half by three and a half heat treated pine. That's the right we start on the canteen. We start with inch half, three and a half heat treated pond. Don't matter if it's 4896 is 144 92 whatever we start there, and we want to cut and this is what we got to get it corrected. This 11. We don't want to end up with 1116 we want to end up with a inch and a half by three and a half by 48 and that same inch and a half by three and a half by 48 needs to show up as raw material on saw two, which is the splitter. So we have to find a way to enter inch and a half by three and a half by 48 into the end, end of the cantek and the beginning of the splitter. Track with that.

Matthias Miller  26:03
Matt, yeah, but I think so, I mean, we're

Unknown Speaker  26:08
Yeah, yep, yep. So

Unknown Speaker  26:16
if I go to that item again, was that MX, 10,

Unknown Speaker  26:30
yo,

Unknown Speaker  26:35
raw material

Unknown Speaker  26:41
is in

Speaker 1  26:44
George. Matt is going to fix that decimal point that the 1.5 it's not it's showing up as a two in the quantity. He's Matt's going to add that decimal point so that that transfers to your soil list. But again,

Unknown Speaker  27:02
where am I at here? Yeah,

Speaker 1  27:07
saw 1am. I looking at the same thing? George, I'm not looking at, I n t. I should go that. I n t. I'm sorry, that's meridian, yeah, I know I should be looking At IMT, 1020,

Unknown Speaker  27:32
yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:41
So if all that we would do in the raw material for sawing is split the dimensions and the species, then anytime we have a multiplier, we could just swap out the prior dimensions, prior yield dimensions, into the into the raw material,

Speaker 1  28:13
right? But the prior yield dimensions, yeah, exactly. But we're still going to have, you'll

Matthias Miller  28:19
still have to put it in, yeah, we're put it in. Yeah, we'll manually enter that,

Unknown Speaker  28:25
right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  28:27
I mean, get it set up in the item data for the first time,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
right? Yes,

Speaker 1  28:32
sorry, buddy, that's so so if i the entry point is up here, right, Matt. So I would say,

Matthias Miller  28:44
well, or you can do it down, up there, and below is the same thing,

Speaker 1  28:49
10 four. So I would say, raw material. I snap three and a half feet tree, applying. That's right. Sawing, sawing, miscellaneous prep

Unknown Speaker  29:08
that

Speaker 1  29:11
does that show up at each saw? George, yeah,

Speaker 3  29:17
well, no, I don't know about that, but 1116 shows up at everything

Unknown Speaker  29:20
this right here, split, 1116,

Unknown Speaker  29:25
I don't think it shows up on

Unknown Speaker  29:28
where's that? Showing off Matt, so I go back there again.

Matthias Miller  29:32
I go back. Might need to. I can tell you my memory's not,

Unknown Speaker  29:35
no, it's fine, sorry, schedule, no, I'm just,

Matthias Miller  29:44
yeah, it'll, it's, it's on everything.

Speaker 1  29:48
What am I looking at? RW, i and t, I'm, was it in here? Return? Yes, little 16. So I. This is my wife, sorry, guys, three times in a row, grab this. Yep, yeah, I'm just in a meeting. What's up?

Unknown Speaker  30:12
Yeah, okay, oh, goodness.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
Then I

Unknown Speaker  30:45
what's to say that? Sorry, this is, this is,

Unknown Speaker  30:48
that's a splitter, right?

Speaker 1  30:52
And you are splitting it 11/16 but that instruction is just for the splitter, for can tech, same thing, split 1116, so

Speaker 1  31:12
miscellaneous prep should really be entered. Should really be entered before each saw if there is an application. In other words, right? Sometimes it's not going to be needed, sometimes it is, but it's basically it's saw specific.

Matthias Miller  31:36
And for the existing one, do we just want to copy it to all the saws, or do we just want to put it on the first one.

Speaker 1  31:44
Sorry, I'm not, I'm not absorbing. Okay, question, Matt, say you maybe say it again. I don't sorry.

Matthias Miller  31:51
Yeah, yeah. So if, if you have something with multiple saws, how do we, how do we migrate that over? Do you just, do you just want to copy the miscellaneous prep onto the miscellaneous onto all saws. Um,

Speaker 1  32:14
I guess, I guess at this point, yeah, if you're going to make it saw specific, we'll leave what's in there, and then that's thinks a little bit for you, those words, but you'd have to edit it the first time through. Some would have to be edited. Not all. How is, is there a lot of these were your two souls. I mean, there's probably a lot of that, but they're already on all of them. Matt, so it's not like, it's not going to be worse, but it gives George the ability to change it or delete it, right? Yep. So then,

Unknown Speaker  32:58
yeah.

Speaker 1  33:02
So, yeah, so it's, saw one, miscellaneous prep. Saw two. Miscellaneous prep, is that? Is that what I'm am i right on, yep, yep. And then do we call it the lat, the yield on saw two or whichever is the last saw is always the dimensions that are needed up here. What if there's other dimensions? Do we call it at play on words, maybe. But is it either, oh,

Speaker 3  33:45
it's just going to be a plain box. Because if you don't have a multiplier, it's a plain box, right? And it would just be a black box.

Speaker 1  33:53
So soul, one multiplier, I could say zero. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  33:56
Matt, you wouldn't want to do zero. You could leave it blank, or say one but, but, I mean,

Speaker 1  34:03
if we're right, right, right, right, blank but, but if we're going to

Matthias Miller  34:07
get rid of it, then it doesn't

Speaker 1  34:09
matter. It doesn't matter. So one yield quantity, I guess, basically what we're what we're missing is the saw one yield

Matthias Miller  34:24
saw one yield dimensions.

Speaker 1  34:26
Yeah, so one yield dimensions instead of saw one multiplier, really

Matthias Miller  34:31
well, except it aren't there times when

Unknown Speaker  34:36
Saul is the multiplier.

Matthias Miller  34:40
I mean, don't you? I mean, we can switch it from saying, from specifying the multiplier to, I mean, the splitter is a straight up multiplier. No, that's. Weird. That is really weird.

Speaker 1  35:03
It the splitter can be a multiplier, but the band, the the band saw, can also be a multiplier, and a rip saw can also be a multiplier, which happens for us. Currently, it's the pendu splitter is also our, yeah, we rep it and we split it on there. But we have two bandsaws that can also multiply,

Matthias Miller  35:29
but you're but you're okay. The reason why we don't need a yield for saw two is that saw two always yields the final yield,

Speaker 1  35:42
right? If, if there is a saw too,

Matthias Miller  35:45
if there is a saw too,

Speaker 3  35:53
I think we got it. Give any alert, I got it.

Speaker 1  35:57
I know. Yeah, thanks for importantly. Was catching up on board of living in

Speaker 1  36:24
So Matt, can we make it optional

Unknown Speaker  36:32
if we only multiply once? But there is a possibility.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
Installing that?

Speaker 1  36:51
Gosh, I'm trying to get this right. There could be a scenario where we're using the sizer

Unknown Speaker  37:00
shoot.

Speaker 1  37:02
Can we run the same material like could I run this 1116, three and a half by 48 off of the brewer and and then I'll get out of there. How do I get at that? Can I cut that on a sizer? And then later I would also do something in sawing.

Matthias Miller  37:33
But then we need to know what the Yeah, typically, the way that you would do that is, then you would put this, the sizer, yield, into the saw, the sawing raw raw material.

Speaker 1  37:46
Let me look at an item here. Wave crackers, this stuff here, I'm sure.

Unknown Speaker  38:01
Okay, here we go. So this is what's he got here.

Unknown Speaker  38:10
Wait He does have it to slot Saul, one can tech and

Unknown Speaker  38:26
I need two and a quarter by three by 17, one eights size or raw material, two and a quarter by nine and a quarter by 10.

Speaker 1  38:48
He's running that through long length, and then after that, it's going to sawing and cut 17 and one eight on the cantek and

Speaker 2  39:00
so

Matthias Miller  39:09
here's where I almost I kind of wish we could change things up. In some ways, it would be nicer if we could have one list of raw material that's going in

Speaker 2  39:26
and listen, Matt, hi, hey, hi, there. What's that

Speaker 1  39:39
about that? Can I talk to you out. To little later. Are you with mom? Cool, I'm thinking Amanda's here right now. So Okay, now we'll help you out. Alright? So. You say,

Matthias Miller  40:02
so in some ways, it'd be nicer if we would have a list of raw material and then have a instead of the lumber, have a series of transformations, where it says, start with this. Start with this. Run this sizer or saw and yield this, and then the next row would be a separate row. Start with what you just did over here. Run this, yield that, and and have a separate row for each, for the for each sizer and saw the whole way through the process,

Unknown Speaker  40:38
right?

Matthias Miller  40:42
Mm, not saying it's good.

Unknown Speaker  40:45
Yeah, no, no, I mean that that it won't. You wouldn't have to tweak this much to do that, would you?

Matthias Miller  40:56
No, let's see. We would have to, you

Speaker 1  40:59
just get rid of multiplier in the whole thing, and just say, here's the here's raw material, here's the yield, here's the yield size. On the next step, here's, here's the raw material, and here's the yield size.

Matthias Miller  41:15
Yes, and you need to say, I mean, on the raw material, it's like, Where's this coming from? Is it coming from, if it's a size, or it's always coming from a can't, if it's a saw, is it coming from inventory, or is it coming from a previous step?

Speaker 1  41:32
Well, yeah, if, I mean basically each, yeah, step one to step two is never going to change until there's a multiplier and then it right, right. I don't know that really needs to be tweaked much, though, does it?

Matthias Miller  41:56
No, we can. We can. We can. It's fine like this. The thing that it doesn't, I think we basically have it spelled out.

Speaker 1  42:14
Yeah, the only thing I'm missing is because we have saw one yield. We just need yield quantity. We just need saw one yield.

Matthias Miller  42:29
So yeah, is the multiplier and quantity? Is that the right way to do it? Do I

Speaker 1  42:46
what the reason we baked that in there was because, because we wanted, Okay, love you. The reason we baked that in there was because we wanted to track the quantity accurately.

Matthias Miller  43:09
But we could do this if, if, if, if we get rid of the saw one multiplier, yeah, then we could change the saw one yield quantity to be editable, to let you edit the saw one yield quantity and have the saw two multiplier auto calculate.

Unknown Speaker  43:31
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:35
maybe that doesn't make sense, but maybe it's six of one and a half dozen of the other, and we're not well.

Speaker 1  43:45
Saw one yield quantity is doesn't change. Saw two yield quantity changes based on a multiplier. I um, well, what you said because of the multiplier? No, that's not what we see

Matthias Miller  44:09
you. The way you get the quantities is you enter the final quantity, then you enter the multipliers. And that gets you this, the saw one yield and the raw material quantity,

Speaker 1  44:22
we know the end, the end result. The end goal was six, love, 16, three and a half, 48 Yep, because the again, this soul one saw two. That's just a we're not saying that anywhere else, except for here, right? But because saw two has a multiplier, the quantity off of saw one is three instead of six. But it doesn't tell us what the dimension changes are. So we have to enter the dimensions to. And saw one multiplier is like, I'm trying to think of a scenario where we multiply it twice, but we just don't. So I

Speaker 1  45:25
the only time we need a different yield size is if we apply a multiplier, yes, so we could call it saw two multiplier two, or we whatever we could say multiplier is two, and then based on multiplier two, then we say previous yield inch and A half of three and a half by 48 so

Matthias Miller  46:12
what if? What if we did this? What if we had a checkbox above saw one, or maybe at the top of the sawing section, which is basically, basically a requires splitting. I don't know what the right is. Right great thing is. And at that point, that's when you see the multiplier, you see the saw one yield, and all of those things become required at that point. And if you don't want that stuff, you uncheck it is, does that help simplify it in any capacity?

Speaker 1  47:02
Probably and it's sickness with length, sizer, sizer. Matthias, prep, raw material, raw material, quantity, raw material. Info. Excuse me,

Speaker 1  47:30
raw material quantity is three. That's that's accurate. The raw material quantity needs to change when there's a multiplier. So that's all that's baked in you bake that in there.

Unknown Speaker  48:01
It's just that the raw material info is Different from step one to step two. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  48:32
So

Speaker 1  48:45
but again, that raw material quantity for sawing, I don't

Unknown Speaker  48:54
Is that showing up on the saw list? Think so.

Unknown Speaker  49:12
I go to can tech.

Unknown Speaker  49:21
No, it's not

Speaker 1  49:28
so that raw material quantity is not showing up anywhere, right?

Matthias Miller  49:31
I don't think so. Maybe that's only that's

Matthias Miller  49:42
yeah. That's probably right. And it,

Speaker 1  49:53
I mean, should it show up somewhere? I. Not sure.

Matthias Miller  50:10
I George has never asked for it, but who knows.

Speaker 1  50:14
What did I just do that? Do some training there? Oh, something weird. Um, some

Speaker 1  50:40
weird raw material for the cantek is inch and a half of three and a half heat treated pine, the quantity.

Unknown Speaker  50:58
Man,

Speaker 1  51:06
it has to work backwards, because we need six, level, 16, three and a half, 48 off of the splitter,

Speaker 1  51:20
but because it's a multiplier, we only need three of whatever off the can Tech, I don't think that yield that raw material quantity is I don't know if he's writing that in to the schedule. There's no quantity given.

Speaker 1  51:58
Like in other words, when we do sizes we're doing. We're doing a quantity. I

Unknown Speaker  52:26
really have a six. I mean,

Matthias Miller  52:30
I think that's that is a question to explore if we want that quantity showing up anywhere.

Unknown Speaker  52:37
You mean, in sawing,

Matthias Miller  52:38
yeah, and sawing, that, that raw material quantity

Unknown Speaker  52:44
definitely is so let me look here again.

Matthias Miller  52:58
By the way, I'm gonna have to, all right, I'm gonna have to drop again. Okay. Are we close enough? Are you comfortable with the with those Cutlass changes that I can go ahead and make them, or do you want to hold off on that?

Speaker 1  53:18
What we just talked about? Yeah, what changes are you?

Matthias Miller  53:26
Getting rid of the saw one multiplier, adding the saw one yield dimensions, splitting raw materials for thawing into the dimensions and raw materials so we can properly generate the new raw material, the raw material for saw two and beyond as necessary, making miscellaneous prep be saw specific.

Speaker 1  53:49
Yeah, if you're not, go ahead. Sorry, no, I think I didn't track with everything we can.

Matthias Miller  53:58
Yeah, sorry, I really do have to drop. I don't mind picking up a time and going back over just to make sure we're on the same page. If that's helpful, yeah, do that,

Speaker 1  54:09
yeah, for sure. I had a couple other have a couple other things that really kind of are popping up important. It shouldn't be this, well, I don't know. Shouldn't be too complicated, but

Matthias Miller  54:23
let me, I gotta drop to get ready for the next call. But let's, let's set up a time. I'll shoot you. Let's text, text to find a time for tomorrow.

Speaker 1  54:37
Tomorrow's Thursday. So am I'm out. PM, is a possum? Yeah, okay. PM, all right, Eastern Time. Thank you, sir,

Matthias Miller  54:49
yes, you bet. Thank you.
