Speaker 1  01:50
I think Good morning. Good morning.

Speaker 2  02:17
Well, I have to say that so your your delay allowed me to knock 10 more of these old retrieval buildings back out, cleaning cleaning this up, which I have to say, This thing actually works fairly well,

Unknown Speaker  02:41
the new methodology, yeah,

Speaker 2  02:43
and what? It's a it's a giant I started with 58 buildings for the year that needed to be evaluated and figure out, you know what, what the story is. And I'm down to four now, and that 58 started out sometime last week, and but I have it down to a science now. It's, it's literally a bunch of clicking and clicking, copying and pasting and clicking and copying and pasting. And have a cramp in my hand.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
That's this, I

Speaker 2  03:18
can imagine. The problem is, the problem is it would have been, it wouldn't have been rocket science to go write some sort of import. The problem is not every single one of them need, like, needs the same solution. And so it's, it's always, you know, 90% of them need the same solution, but there's the other 10% in there that you know, weren't and anyway, thankfully, thankfully, we figured that one, we got that one sorted out. So

Unknown Speaker  03:53
I'm sure Drew and Mark will be happy to have their accounting, whatever, whatever it was affecting, fixed,

Unknown Speaker  04:01
exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 2  04:07
Well, you're feeling you're feeling more alive this morning,

Matthias Miller  04:13
not by much, I'll be honest, I woke in the middle of night and couldn't sleep, so that's not good for feeling alive.

Speaker 2  04:20
Well, join the club, because I sat down last night about, oh, I don't know it was like, close to 10, decided I was going to knock out a bunch more of these buildings, these retrieval evaluations, and then finally, worked until after midnight, so I felt like I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore, and then went to bed and couldn't fall asleep. And that's the

Unknown Speaker  04:41
worst, that is the worst. That is the worst.

Speaker 1  04:59
Yeah, I don't. Think there's been much over the last,

Matthias Miller  05:07
I don't know, maybe ever that's felt made me feel quite as exposed as taking such a I don't have any doubt that the right people in right conditions, we can deliver on the promise. But that's making me. Made me feel so exposed, taking stuff to the expo.

Speaker 2  05:28
So you should try deploying an unfinished software product. Yeah?

Speaker 3  05:33
Well, I think we should just commemorate together. Probably, I suspect

Unknown Speaker  05:36
that, yeah.

Matthias Miller  05:39
I mean, like, literally, like, I like, yeah, it's just like, sometimes it's almost screaming in my head, like it's crazy.

Speaker 2  05:50
I've been meaning to say this, but next week, not next week, the following, after the show. We are not doing any development calls. We're taking an entire week break.

Unknown Speaker  06:03
I like it.

Speaker 2  06:05
We're, we're going to, we're going to put a development freeze on for a week and just be like, I'm not having, I'm not thinking about this for Yeah, we just, we need to after that sprint. We gotta sit, we gotta stand around and pant for a while.

Speaker 1  06:31
Contract, let's make sure I got this right aid.

Speaker 2  06:35
I probably should. I should probably inform Seth of that too, so that he's knows what's happening.

Unknown Speaker  06:41
Yeah, that would be good,

Unknown Speaker  06:43
yeah, I'll drop a I'll drop a line.

Unknown Speaker  06:49
Okay, so we have a loop meaning, yeah.

Matthias Miller  07:02
Well, here's all the ones that are overpaid.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
Oh, and that's partially why.

Unknown Speaker  07:33
So we should we?

Speaker 2  08:39
How much, how much interaction do you need for me in this process?

Matthias Miller  08:43
Not very much. All right, but I was wondering where I might just throw on my headphones and let me I can keep sharing my screen. I don't care. But yeah, I'm

Speaker 2  08:54
going to drag zoom to the side window, and I'm going to go back to finishing off these four retrieval buildings.

Unknown Speaker  08:59
Okay, text, maybe anything, but that's fair. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
How's it coming? I'm I think that

Matthias Miller  1:04:46
and sorry, I got muted, um, I accidentally hit the annotation and

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
couldn't bother to clear it.

Speaker 2  1:04:54
Literally, was like scratching at my screen, though, something on my screen, I was like dragging apps over top up, Nope, it's not my screen.

Matthias Miller  1:05:01
It around. Well, actually, no, it jumps.

Speaker 2  1:05:04
Okay, what is, what is this little orange slash, and it's like,

Matthias Miller  1:05:11
your annotate. I don't know how to,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
I don't know how to get rid of it fast.

Matthias Miller  1:05:22
They're all drawing. There we go. Oh, no, it's, I can, know,

Speaker 4  1:05:28
wait, how is it? Is it a zoom thing? It's a zoom thing. Ah, gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
What in the world?

Matthias Miller  1:05:39
Okay, so here's a transaction on a this is the payout. So we take the original purchase price of the building, because that was the asset value, we reverse that, and reverse the accumulated depreciation, and then use the total cash, the cash amount, to adjust for gain or loss. So there's a 16 cent rounding error. Then we post accounts receivable for the for the payoff amount, and have a delta for sales tax payable and the balance goes into barn rental income. Now I don't know if this is correct.

Speaker 2  1:06:21
Well here's the deal, does it? Does it, does it? Does it make sense in your head? Well, not like, what? What do you know of accounting? Does it? Does it make sense? Because essentially, if somebody questions me on this at the show, I'm literally going to go, this is what my accountant wanted us to do for gain or loss on sale of asset. You're apparently my accountant now, well,

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
okay, let me see if I can talk it through to rationalize it, because that will make me happier. I

Matthias Miller  1:07:05
so basically what we're saying, yes, basically what we're saying is that we report

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
the cash portion as revenue until the sale of the building, and at that point, we reverse the reported revenue

Matthias Miller  1:07:39
to account for

Unknown Speaker  1:07:48
to account for that. In other words,

Matthias Miller  1:07:55
the cash portion of the building is is reported as revenue. But when it comes to selling, the building,

Matthias Miller  1:08:11
said, differently, we want to report gain or loss on the sale of an

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
asset

Matthias Miller  1:08:22
based on rent, based on the cash portion that we collected, and for that reason, we're doing that at The point of sale and writing off the balance. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:45
money from revenue. I don't know

Speaker 2  1:08:52
if that's so. The sum of what is the sum of 3034 53 357, 41 and 3911 45 What's the sum of those three?

Matthias Miller  1:09:03
It's well, this is the balance of all of these 7283 minus this plus gainer loss. So this number here is the total cash paid, the total cash portion paid, minus accumulated depreciation.

Speaker 2  1:09:22
So Where's, where's the, where? I'm assuming this is a transaction on an EPO, correct? Oh, no,

Matthias Miller  1:09:28
no, no. We were going to expense out. This should be an depreciation expense line item. We said we're gonna, we're gonna depreciate the rest of it at that point. That's, that's what it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
This is why we talk it through. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
Accumulated.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:01
Yeah, that makes way that

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
makes way more sense, way more sense.

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
Yeah, perfect. So these two, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
but this isn't quite right, because we should actually expense out that 16 cents we should actually

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
report as revenue.

Speaker 2  1:10:35
So what's the what's the 357, I really just

Unknown Speaker  1:11:05
I think, all

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22
right I'll answer your question just A moment.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
this is the original, sorry,

Speaker 5  1:11:40
the No,

Matthias Miller  1:11:58
this is the building price minus accumulated depreciation these 230, 3453 plus 424847, equals the original purchase price of the building. So we do want to expense it out,

Matthias Miller  1:12:21
except that

Speaker 1  1:12:32
let me move that depreciation expense up to up there, because that makes more sense up there, you have dropped, don't you?

Speaker 2  1:12:44
Oh, thank you for reminding me. Yes, yes, I do need to drop. I would have, I would have blind blissfully, just continued on here. Okay, so we're back at 230 ish, somewhere in that

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00
neighborhood.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
All right, see you. Then, awesome.

Speaker 1  1:13:07
Keep going solo. Okay, so now we have farm building. We have depreciated it, but how do we account for the gain or loss? Because now we have additional cash listing,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:29
really at this point, we now have

Speaker 1  1:13:41
AR goes up by this we need a bar rental income that

Matthias Miller  1:13:46
is the subtotal

Speaker 5  1:13:54
minus Gator loss. So. loss.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:42
Sorry. Let me take sorry

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
this should be correct.

Speaker 1  1:17:34
To prepare myself to share my screen here so we got um um filter here for content resolution we're going to do repay off

Unknown Speaker  1:17:50
game.

Speaker 1  1:17:56
So here we have run out the building and expensive immediately

Unknown Speaker  1:18:04
we don't have a EPO probably won't have a difference because

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
of how we calculated it. So here we have you gain a loss.

Speaker 1  1:18:20
Pay our amount, report everything, the rental income is basically the subtotal minus the gain or loss.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
And we're going to go

Speaker 1  1:19:41
Yeah, so the income statement, we have rental revenue, late fees, LBW, gain losses, sale of asset. We have manufactured premiums and appreciation expense. Join net profit of $270 A balance sheet we are showing everything walking crazy. We have half the checking, 50 and AR, 2000 AR, we have bundlings, last accumulated depreciation. We have 14,000 in AP, 112, and sales tax, payable, oops, Off. Um, I I'm

Speaker 1  1:21:40
I'm I think we've actually said that our basis for that is 630 June, 30.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:20
Today.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:30
Yeah.
