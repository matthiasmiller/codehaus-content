Speaker 1  04:18
Really well does just go through instead of, like telling, asking me to verify that the recording is being whatever

Unknown Speaker  04:28
sign off forever. I know well, What?

Speaker 1  04:34
What? What? What mad geniusness Have you been cooking while I've been accomplishing other things.

Matthias Miller  04:42
We need some good news for the day. Do what now I said, we need good news for

Unknown Speaker  04:47
the day. Check this out. Okay, I'm checking,

Speaker 1  04:58
oh, he's going into the income. Statement, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:04
AR, 2.4

Matthias Miller  05:07
in assets, 1.2 and accumulated depreciation, 15 and AP, 112 and security deposits, six in CRA, 15 grand sales tax payable, and then we have three quarter million in rental income, late fees, LDW. We have 64 cents gain our loss on stay on barn sales.

Speaker 1  05:34
Can we get rid of that? That's just that's going to make somebody screw up their eyeballs like, I don't know, like, journal entry into petty cash,

Unknown Speaker  05:48
spoken, Spoken like a non accountant,

Matthias Miller  05:55
yeah. I mean literally, the reason is because of rounding issues and they the rental portion did not precisely match the what you paid for the building. But if you want to scroll it away, we can,

Unknown Speaker  06:13
I mean

Speaker 1  06:18
somebody's somebody is gonna go, what is with the gainer loss of 64 cents? And I'm gonna have to be like, um, and that's what I suggest, like, I should just journal entry all in to ask my accountant.

Matthias Miller  06:42
I mean, we can change, well, I'm assuming we want to write it off and not just change accounting impact, yeah.

Speaker 1  06:53
I mean, just for the sake of, yeah, sure, oh,

Matthias Miller  07:01
that's the income statement. That's not gonna work.

Unknown Speaker  07:06
60 411,

Matthias Miller  07:10
25 that's a little bonkers. But hey,

Unknown Speaker  07:17
wait a minute. Oh,

Matthias Miller  07:24
well, it would probably

Unknown Speaker  07:27
that would probably

Unknown Speaker  07:32
help. There we go. Happy, happy.

Matthias Miller  07:35
Here are all the buildings we expensed out. All um, you can see here,

Unknown Speaker  07:46
pick one

Matthias Miller  07:48
zero out the asset based on purchase amount, handle accumulated depreciation, AR sales tax, depreciate the rest of the building, reported gain or loss based on rent. Received report rental income,

Unknown Speaker  08:11
boom, boom.

Unknown Speaker  08:14
Somebody was having some fun, so

Matthias Miller  08:19
we got income statement and balance sheet that actually cost. Actually kind of looks

Speaker 1  08:23
sane. All right, let's go. Let's go fix that. It that's looking phenomenal, by the way.

Unknown Speaker  08:31
Um, it

Speaker 1  08:32
is a thing of beauty. Your work is phenomenal.

Matthias Miller  08:38
Thanks. It's rough pitching it to a whole bunch of people who don't care quite as deeply as Mark and Cruz, but

Speaker 1  08:46
Well, listen, we just have to pitch it well enough to convince people that it works that there'll be plenty of people who care very deeply about this in the future, trust me. I mean, so Okay, we're gonna be this total side question. How is accounting impact configured in assist side then? Because obviously you're not writing all of that in a subset of some import,

Matthias Miller  09:18
it's all set on the accounting company. So what we would do somewhere on the accounting company, we would link it to the rental company, and then, like Seth and I were recently doing something with customer deposits. So you just look at the accounting company, what's the customer deposit account, and you just literally configure all this stuff. So I mean, it's just a bunch of settings here.

Speaker 1  09:45
So this is, this will have to be built out on the accounting company, yeah, and got it, yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:55
And we'll have to basically any, any place I heard good at a financial account. I mean, it's like, what's your AR account? Account, what's your sales tax payable account? Where do you want LBW to go? Or any of your fees? Where, what revenue accounts do your fees go into? At some point, we'll have to have something that says either, either, a methodology like, are you treating your Are you treating your sales as cost of goods? Are you treating them as sale of asset? I don't know all that, all that stuff, but

Speaker 1  10:35
got it. But that is a conversation for sometime after sometime in October.

Unknown Speaker  10:42
Yeah. Sweet,

Speaker 1  10:46
does have they pushed? Have they pushed anything in regards to fixing of calculation macros?

Unknown Speaker  10:54
Yes. Um,

Unknown Speaker  11:01
so we can go work on this now. Hey, numbers are they're not shown negatives. Weird, I would say

Matthias Miller  11:19
contract balance should have a comma. Wait, why don't we use like,

Speaker 1  11:28
okay, great. Let's just, let's make, let's just, let's go column by column and fix all this stuff.

Matthias Miller  11:33
Yeah. Okay, so we have customer. We got that address. Is fine.

Unknown Speaker  11:48
All right, come on

Unknown Speaker  11:52
purchase. I think I was pulling in purchase amount, yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:56
well, it's not actually what we want. We want this guy,

Unknown Speaker  12:03
yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  12:06
Contract total contract value is what we're calling it.

Speaker 1  12:11
We probably should get, we should probably go get fancy and where you, I forget how you do this, where you do double columns so you can do the amount to dollar string and yet still sum the column at the bottom, kind of a whole thing in majiggy.

Matthias Miller  12:23
Oh, okay, we can in a minute, or we can have them do it early.

Unknown Speaker  12:27
Payoff, sure, that's fine. That's fair

Unknown Speaker  12:30
remaining months.

Unknown Speaker  12:40
And here we should do a two decimals,

Matthias Miller  12:49
fee period, but we went the total with tax.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
What were you looking at? The

Matthias Miller  13:00
payment amount is that, sure?

Speaker 1  13:04
Let's show we're doing them with all with tax. So yes, so yeah, they would be Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  13:10
this guy,

Unknown Speaker  13:18
Whoa.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
So Joe,

Matthias Miller  13:35
I am really confused about his. I

Matthias Miller  13:55
You don't have to tell him that, but he reminds me of a mini me. The only advantage disadvantage he has is he has less experience than me, and he's still

Unknown Speaker  14:04
opinionated.

Unknown Speaker  14:07
Who are we referring to?

Matthias Miller  14:09
Jonathan?

Speaker 1  14:13
Who are we? Who are we referring to? Got it? You don't like, you don't like his macro names?

Matthias Miller  14:20
No, a total fees to be entered. Like, why are you calculating it? Like, talk about touching your nose the wrong, wrong way. Like,

Unknown Speaker  14:35
let's fix it.

Matthias Miller  14:41
Okay, contract, I'm gonna alright. So here's his way, and here's what I'm proposing.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Contract, value.

Matthias Miller  15:10
He is getting wrong values. He is getting wrong values. Is he

Speaker 1  15:14
calculating the monthly payment? Is that what he's calculating? Yeah, and what's he doing? Let me see it.

Unknown Speaker  15:21
He's taking.

Matthias Miller  15:24
He's taking how much unpaid, unincurred Rent divided by how many periods, how many months until the end of the contract date you

Speaker 1  15:43
for the for the for the monthly subtotal, yeah, well, this is straight wrong, contract, film, contract. Go back to contract value. What is contract value?

Matthias Miller  16:01
That is the rental base divided by divisor times term like, why would we just use this as the monthly payment?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Yeah, well, have him fix it. You can be,

Speaker 1  16:36
I get to be like the Amish right now, and I decide I

Speaker 2  16:40
Okay, whoa.

Unknown Speaker  16:54
And contract rental base is, is, it's the

Unknown Speaker  16:58
CRA minus CRA,

Matthias Miller  17:01
something or other, it would be good to find the CRA con. Well, do you want to find a CRA contract and see Sure?

Speaker 1  17:08
Let's do that. Let's make sure. Let's make it. Let's find a CRA contract and make sure this is all correct.

Matthias Miller  17:14
Okay, I lost my

Unknown Speaker  17:17
Where did I have my report? Okay, this is just wrong. Do you

Matthias Miller  17:38
want to add a filter for RTO type or not?

Speaker 2  17:40
Yes,

Speaker 1  17:47
yes, yes, sure.

Matthias Miller  17:52
Why not call it RTO tape. Okay, so let's do

Speaker 1  18:22
move, it. Move it somewhere where it makes sense. Oh, yes, I really should do this whole blank equals all that's going to throw off your your the start and end date ones, but,

Matthias Miller  18:36
oh, because you have

Speaker 1  18:39
no I mean, it needs to be, it needs To be moved.

Unknown Speaker  18:42
Yeah, okay, let's go do

Speaker 1  19:02
somebody somebody should do some work on the reporting engine to make, to make the date fields auto align and auto, auto format where they belong. That would be awesome, wouldn't

Speaker 1  19:19
it, though, either, either that, or have it be like, recognizable that when you do a start and then, like you should be some sort of like you should have some sort of macro that just automatically puts the correct fields in,

Unknown Speaker  19:35
someday, someday.

Matthias Miller  19:40
Okay, now let's do this. CRA, feel

Unknown Speaker  19:47
free to clean up this subset if you need, if you feel the need. Um.

Unknown Speaker  20:05
Uh, did I forget the Oh, for Pete's sake.

Unknown Speaker  20:14
Wait, you can do double oars in there. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  20:19
I You just can't mix them within parentheses. You can't what. You can't mix them within parentheses,

Unknown Speaker  20:29
sure, because that's

Unknown Speaker  20:46
and

Matthias Miller  20:48
All right, here are these.

Matthias Miller  21:00
Okay, so let's go to

Speaker 1  21:01
we probably should add a term filter into that

Matthias Miller  21:07
would make sense.

Unknown Speaker  21:27
The number, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:42
the I got that

Matthias Miller  21:45
about date as well.

Speaker 1  21:47
Wait, wait, no, shouldn't we don't have a, we don't have a list that we can drop in.

Matthias Miller  21:53
Well, I guess it doesn't. Yeah, we do. We can. It would be, um,

Matthias Miller  22:15
um, sure, bath,

Unknown Speaker  22:36
okay

Unknown Speaker  22:38
before the date, yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:42
he said, sadly,

Unknown Speaker  22:45
well, it's yeah,

Speaker 1  22:52
that now you just have to go and rejigger all your dates. But, oh no, you did, yeah, you already did.

Matthias Miller  23:08
All right, so we went 36 Do you want multiple? Multi? Select on term,

Unknown Speaker  23:19
sure.

Speaker 1  23:23
And I probably, probably the term needs to be multi select, probably the type needs to be multi select.

Matthias Miller  23:30
We only have standard NCRA.

Speaker 1  23:34
So if you want all of them, just uncheck, well, you won't always just have standard NCRA. Potentially exists. You might have a whole lot more than that sort of

Matthias Miller  24:36
stays out. Let's do a three. Let's do 12 and 60. All right,

Unknown Speaker  24:46
248, I.

Speaker 1  25:04
Okay, so now we have, I'm wondering, I'm wondering if we should go, go back to the Ask prompt. I wonder if we should turn, turn the account number, Contract Number, thing into one ask and we just search both.

Unknown Speaker  25:23
See if we can declutter a little bit. Well, okay,

Matthias Miller  25:28
but when do you need account number? Because you can search the customer list by account number you want to search by, I don't

Speaker 1  25:42
have we started. I don't think we started concatenating

Unknown Speaker  25:45
that. Have we, oh,

Matthias Miller  25:51
some of them we have. We don't. We don't search it

Unknown Speaker  26:00
or something. I don't know what we're doing. Why

Matthias Miller  26:04
is it so, why is it customer drop list?

Unknown Speaker  26:10
It's not a drop list.

Matthias Miller  26:12
I mean, why don't you want it to be a drop list?

Speaker 1  26:15
You're saying? Why isn't it, right? Well, I'm yeah, sure, that's a very good point, and you just literally start typing the name in there.

Matthias Miller  26:46
And then you can do, what is that?

Matthias Miller  26:59
This? That is the weirdest thing where that disappears.

Unknown Speaker  27:15
But you can't do the 747,

Matthias Miller  27:17
no, you can't do the 747, you have to do the it, hmm, okay. Well, maybe we do one contract slash account number, or account slash contract number,

Unknown Speaker  27:33
well, but I mean, you could,

Speaker 1  27:38
I guess you can't turn, you can't turn well, I guess you could turn those into a list as well.

Unknown Speaker  27:52
You could, yeah, that's

Speaker 3  28:01
a little weird. Okay, let's skip the account number.

Speaker 1  28:08
Let's get rid of the account number. Let's do contract number. And since you can, since you have customer name, and you literally can say, Okay, what's the name on the account start typing the name, and it's like, there you are. I forget, I forget how well this works inside of here, instead of like, I'm still used to the RTO Pro. It's like you're just typing it in then, then it searches right?

Unknown Speaker  28:44
How's that?

Unknown Speaker  28:48
Yes, me likes,

Matthias Miller  28:55
okay, so back to CRA. We have a you.

Matthias Miller  29:13
What's the advisor on 21 six? Sorry, yeah, 21 six dwf? Oh, we had a negative monthly dwf on this. Oh, that's not going to work. Okay.

Matthias Miller  30:14
Okay, well, that's just completely going to screw this up. I'm

Unknown Speaker  30:27
Um,

Matthias Miller  30:29
well, we can't, we don't know if CRA is right. I mean, I suppose we could

Speaker 2  30:35
put ah,

Matthias Miller  30:45
uh, financing base is 5225, okay, it's fine.

Matthias Miller  30:54
I mean, I don't trust any of his numbers with dwf being the way it is. Uh,

Speaker 1  31:03
pick another pick another. CRA, let's see if they're all negatives.

Unknown Speaker  31:19
Darn it.

Unknown Speaker  31:22
What? Is going on?

Matthias Miller  31:24
He's calculating the total dwf, unpaid dwf, divided by months remaining. Why? Because he had it in his head that that's how it should work. I don't

Speaker 3  31:36
know. Can we, can we? Can we fix it? Can we fix can we fix his his thoughts,

Matthias Miller  31:45
let's take The land. Heard back,

Unknown Speaker  31:52
okay, but could we

Speaker 2  31:58
CRA amount? CBD,

Matthias Miller  32:04
even CRA a bit isn't is

Speaker 1  32:20
this one he updated, or is this one we haven't even talked about yet so far?

Unknown Speaker  32:26
I don't know.

Matthias Miller  32:30
Okay, so Well, okay, but theoretically this should be calculating correctly, though, if we went to 455, 225, 2587, this was no. 241, 94 Well, that's because that one's just wrong. So we have a contract. So subtotal. Okay, this was for the other one. Let's go back into the other one. This guy. We have eight. No, this is 5967, tax is 7%

Unknown Speaker  33:22
cash two is 1000

Unknown Speaker  33:37
Oh,

Matthias Miller  33:42
okay. Cash. Due amount is 1000 effective value is 5967, tax adjusted is this dwf of f times.

Matthias Miller  35:46
Here 21.6, divided by 1.07

Speaker 1  35:52
does the does the extra V's in the in the vvv tax rate,

Unknown Speaker  35:58
so many V's

Matthias Miller  35:59
the old, the old language parser, wouldn't, would not. It would. It would have a naming conflict if you have two macros with with identical names, gotcha. And so you'll notice somewhere out here, there's probably, there's a V to, I don't know, it's just,

Unknown Speaker  36:25
yeah, there's a VV security deposit.

Matthias Miller  36:27
Yeah, for that reason, somewhere, somebody has a a, who knows. Okay. So that part,

Matthias Miller  36:47
effective value

Unknown Speaker  36:51
to 1000 bucks

Matthias Miller  36:54
With the effective value times the contract adjusted rate.

Matthias Miller  37:35
Which number are we going for? We're going after CRA amount.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
So this guy,

Matthias Miller  37:57
so we would also expect, if you want to, I get real clever that we should be able to do the same thing here. We have 1000 we have no shipping, no tax.

Unknown Speaker  38:13
We have

Matthias Miller  38:21
five minutes,

Matthias Miller  38:47
736,

Matthias Miller  38:53
I mean, that's matching up. Why is the report not matching up? Got

Matthias Miller  39:11
no shipping. Shipping is not taxable. Tax rate 21.6, 4.4 4.5

Unknown Speaker  39:30
741,

Unknown Speaker  41:30
To deal with

Matthias Miller  42:10
uh, thank you. That helps a lot.

Matthias Miller  42:19
Okay, then let's do viewer debugger. Let's come down here, 1000

Matthias Miller  42:36
dwf Rate.

Matthias Miller  43:01
What is it to select? Disallow

Matthias Miller  43:23
Haha, you.

Unknown Speaker  45:12
Okay, well, there's the problem.

Matthias Miller  45:15
So it looks to me like the CRA amount is correct. The calculator was not insights. Calculator does not calculate a report does not correctly handle dwf. Okay.

Matthias Miller  45:36
Jonathan says he's fixed the dwf. You want to push an update.

Speaker 3  45:43
Sure, while you do that, I'm going to Go find some caffeine. Sweet.

Speaker 1  48:01
Oh, that's nice. Oh, that's nice. Made myself an espresso.

Unknown Speaker  48:07
Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1  48:10
We had, we had a, we had one of these Nespresso machines that we had in here for a while, and then for a while it was over at the Airbnb, and now it's back in the office again. And I confess to having a

Matthias Miller  48:31
expressive addiction,

Unknown Speaker  48:33
a bit of an addiction. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  48:38
that's nice. I

Matthias Miller  48:43
I did tell the team that the CRA calculations are working. They seem to be congratulations,

Speaker 1  48:49
boys, congratulations for all the things that we've been nitpicking on, at least your CRA calculations are working. Don't say that.

Matthias Miller  48:58
I was just getting ready to type it out. Man.

Speaker 1  49:02
Dwayne says, for all the things we've been nitpicking on, at least your CRA calculations

Unknown Speaker  49:07
are working. That's not a very nice thing to say. I

Speaker 1  49:13
don't know. Man, I'm liking my MacBook. I will say for all the for all the years that I have hated on Mac. I'm like, I'm liking it. So far,

Unknown Speaker  49:24
I like it. It's just

Matthias Miller  49:31
here. This is this. This applies to, oh, if you're

Speaker 1  49:40
going to yank out the GK Chesterton quotes, of course it's going to be

Matthias Miller  49:52
good. Oh, yes, I'm human. Uh.

Speaker 1  50:20
The most poetic thing in the world is not being sick. I think

Matthias Miller  50:30
MacBooks are kind of like that at this point. At least they didn't used to be. They used to have more, wow. But it's just like,

Speaker 1  50:37
oh, it's kind of why I decided to go with a Mac to give this a whirl, because it's like, I just want something that is not somewhat temperamental.

Matthias Miller  50:47
Yeah, it just works. I mean, just I need, I need,

Speaker 1  50:51
like, when I plug it in, it needs to work. Now that being said, I've had no ending, amount of random ending, no amount. I don't know what I'm trying to say. I've had issues with Leanne's MacBook, but hers is probably hers is older.

Unknown Speaker  51:10
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  51:14
Okay, details.

Speaker 1  51:16
FYI, you can pick up 2019 MacBook Pros for

Unknown Speaker  51:21
a steal.

Speaker 1  51:25
I just just bought one for Leanne's assistant for like, five or 600 bucks.

Matthias Miller  51:29
Nice.

Matthias Miller  51:35
Okay, Jonathan, what exactly did you mean? It's fixed. I 360,

Speaker 1  51:49
wait, what did he say? Something hard code, true.

Matthias Miller  51:59
It's not true.

Matthias Miller  52:17
The period is but if you want to show the contract monthly amount you should be showing something else in the detail screen.

Matthias Miller  52:31
I am so confused, like this is no okay.

Matthias Miller  52:42
You should have created macros and called it a monthly you

Matthias Miller  53:58
heavy wealth.

Matthias Miller  54:08
You want term length right aligned? Doing what term length right aligned?

Unknown Speaker  54:14
Term length, I don't

Unknown Speaker  54:22
know what you said, but yeah,

Matthias Miller  54:23
the the link this column, right align.

Speaker 1  54:27
Now, now I am understanding what you're saying. Right aligned.

Matthias Miller  54:33
All these numbers would make most sense. Right aligned,

Speaker 1  54:36
yeah, when you say that really, really fast, it sounds like you're making a word that I was like, What are you even saying? Red aligned, right aligned. It almost, it almost sounds like, red aligned. What are you saying? I have no idea. Yeah, remaining months, one remaining. Month for that one person

Matthias Miller  55:07
value, contract balance payment amount, okay, but this, this doesn't make sense. Contract balance. Monthly payment is 512, contract balance, it's like three months remaining. Mm,

Unknown Speaker  55:26
a good catch,

Matthias Miller  55:27
months paid.

Speaker 1  55:29
This is, this is why we're doing this, because, because somebody is going to be eyeballing this thing with evil eyes and gonna be like,

Unknown Speaker  55:36
well, that ain't right.

Unknown Speaker  55:44
What the

Matthias Miller  55:48
Okay, now I'm just a little he

Speaker 1  55:50
just Look, why don't you just get him and Seth on here. So we

Matthias Miller  55:56
I'm a little annoyer These. This is getting arguments with my boss, but I did know where my limit started and stopped. Okay, let's fix these calculations. I

Matthias Miller  56:29
The contract balance then,

Matthias Miller  56:42
where do attending contract balance to include late fees?

Speaker 3  56:51
Okay, we went, we went over this yesterday, yes,

Unknown Speaker  56:57
and tax and tax for any CRA I

Unknown Speaker  57:02
a good afternoon.

Matthias Miller  57:04
Good afternoon. All right, so maybe part of the issue here, then, is that we need a different is it a rental balance that we need?

Unknown Speaker  57:23
Okay, what's your what's your distinction,

Matthias Miller  57:28
whether you include late fees and CRA or tax for CRA,

Unknown Speaker  57:35
like you

Matthias Miller  57:40
shouldn't necessarily expand the number, number of months remaining just because you Have late fees, unpaid fees on it, right?

Unknown Speaker  57:57
Not tracking. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  58:03
Okay, so Jonathan, we need to make this report be at a minimum, rationalizable, because when I look at the contract balance, I have an EPO that's higher than contract balance, higher than the contract balance and a payment amount. That's a third of contract balance, but only one remaining month. And none of these things, like neither of those things really make sense.

Unknown Speaker  58:35
What's the contract ID?

Matthias Miller  58:38
11, 0654,

Unknown Speaker  59:47
1000.

Matthias Miller  59:58
But this is not a. We should not be including this CRA amount.

Speaker 4  1:00:09
So what's happening there is, if it's CRA, we include the tax. So we

Matthias Miller  1:00:27
have $1,100 of unpaid fees.

Matthias Miller  1:00:39
Was there an easy way to see where those are coming from.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
Yeah. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:01:16
Could be missing something, but I'm not seeing

Matthias Miller  1:01:24
contract by tax,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:27
though the the first period has no everything's paid in the RG.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:44
I said 1100

Matthias Miller  1:01:47
Yeah, when I evaluate this part of the macro,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
which

Matthias Miller  1:01:56
would make sense to me to be closer to right, 1177, 82 is what it says is the unpaid fees.

Speaker 4  1:04:54
I'm not incredibly confident on the contract, unpaid fees of type. I added it yesterday, but then Seth. Added a different macro that looks at the RG more directly with more parameters and stuff. And so I'm wondering if we should use that instead. I'm losing faith in using structs a lot here, which is how the contract unpaid needed type works. Maybe it makes it so slow, it is okay. I'm trying to remember what they're called. I

Matthias Miller  1:05:56
The other thing too is that we should be applying tax to the contract, total balance paid as well.

Speaker 4  1:06:18
What do you mean by should be applying tax to it, it Well, I mean that the calculation should include tax paid.

Matthias Miller  1:06:27
I mean, yeah, effective value, and then we're subtracting the untaxable to portion, which means it will double pay Tax.

Speaker 2  1:06:44
Yes or,

Matthias Miller  1:06:57
or we could conceivably calculate EPO. Like, yeah, let's figure out what it should be like. We could conceivably also do something like this. What do we do? Apply tax

Speaker 1  1:07:22
Matthias. I'm not bringing value here, is it? Do I need to stay? No, okay, I'm gonna drop them. Thanks, guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
Doesn't like me.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
Oh, I just sorry. I You just hopped on. You're good, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:07:39
I'm just, I'm just sitting here and my eyes are glazing over, so I'm gonna go do something that's worthwhile, that's good, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:48
so we could do so contract, so a way To see if it's a fee,

Speaker 4  1:08:01
as in, if it's there's a is no that's for the adjustment type is credit, so not that will mean that it's incurred. Or you could just reference incurred directly, just adjustment equals incurred. I

Matthias Miller  1:08:32
well, I mean, I guess, effectively, this is only calculence amounts, or

Unknown Speaker  1:08:40
calc paid amount

Matthias Miller  1:08:43
is if it's paid, post the adjustment got it, so it'd be like this. And we

Speaker 4  1:08:55
don't need to worry about other adjustment types, right? Because for this, you can't forgive okay?

Matthias Miller  1:09:03
It Well, here we go.

Matthias Miller  1:09:46
Subtotal that on these,

Matthias Miller  1:09:54
if some, some, I don't know, what am I missing? In.

Matthias Miller  1:10:17
Something in here, Reference, parameter, if,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
oh, duh.

Matthias Miller  1:10:53
The EPO. Hang on. It really. Does not matter,

Matthias Miller  1:11:30
okay, so it's current, so, but then the other thing we need is contract.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
That does not make sense.

Matthias Miller  1:11:57
Now we want to exclude

Unknown Speaker  1:12:34
what's the background? What are we looking for? Early

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
payoffs? BPO, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:12:43
so current, current macro, we play tax the product, effective value, minus balance paid just a non taxable cash portion, which ends up this, this is actually fine product, effective value, minus this, which takes care of rentals we want To exclude, and then

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
our fee calculations are going wild.

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
Three or 474,

Matthias Miller  1:13:32
which looks to me To be a little bit

Matthias Miller  1:13:43
are more plausible.

Matthias Miller  1:14:06
So then the remaining months,

Matthias Miller  1:14:41
metric balance then i.

Matthias Miller  1:15:10
We would expect, I'm a little confused then still about

Matthias Miller  1:15:20
this guy, do we have a security deposit?

Matthias Miller  1:15:30
379, like, how do we have one month remaining with a contract that higher balance? Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:15:44
what was the record? One, one of six, five. So

Matthias Miller  1:15:55
here we're taking the balance paid. Another way to say this is, why is this balance so high? Given that the EPO is only 304, 74,

Matthias Miller  1:16:10
shouldn't have a CRA because contract NP, n Pay Fees of type is miscalculating, which is exactly what we saw over here.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:36
Late Fee,

Speaker 4  1:16:39
sorry, I muted. I keep on being muted because we have allowed office first summing the rental fees twice. That's why I think maybe not

Unknown Speaker  1:16:52
unpaid

Matthias Miller  1:16:55
rental fees. No,

Speaker 4  1:16:57
no. Never mind. Because unpaid is only things that are entered but not paid yet. Never mind, but that shouldn't be as high as it is. I think we should switch to Seth's macro.

Matthias Miller  1:17:09
Okay, so this is if it's a rental fee or

Speaker 2  1:17:27
and we pay and we forgive, just Technically, which

Matthias Miller  1:17:37
so that then gives us

Unknown Speaker  1:17:41
this fees not included in balance, or we're just not worrying about them for now,

Matthias Miller  1:17:51
that's where I'm a little confused on what I think Dwayne wanted to include leafies in the balance, I guess remaining months.

Speaker 5  1:17:57
But I'm saying other fees, like, I don't know what, but if you have other fees you didn't pay

Matthias Miller  1:18:06
the remaining months, seems like it should be exclusionary of all fees.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09
I would think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16
Why it wouldn't be

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
so what if we made this be

Speaker 5  1:18:32
okay. We have a rental balance. That's what you're needing,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:38
I think maybe. And then

Speaker 5  1:18:41
we calculate the remaining months based on the rental balance. If he wants to, like, if you have, you have unpaid fees, then sure that that's part of the balance. That's not part of the rental

Unknown Speaker  1:18:54
balance, right? I would agree.

Matthias Miller  1:18:58
Remaining months would then be,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
be rental balance divided by terms essentially,

Matthias Miller  1:19:07
and then the contract the remaining ones includes or excludes the CRA.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17
How does CRA?

Speaker 5  1:19:19
Doesn't get applied at the end, though, does it? How does that work?

Matthias Miller  1:19:24
CRA gets converted. I mean, yeah, effectively does okay.

Speaker 4  1:19:29
So I think we would ignore so it would ignore CRA, right?

Matthias Miller  1:19:33
It would make the most sense to ignore CRA, because CRA really has no impact in the number of months. Yeah, Mm, hmm, it's basically, we put money away and at the end of the contract, we use it to back pay your lower monthly payments. I mean, it's right,

Matthias Miller  1:19:56
all right. Um. This balance that we show here doing includes fees, it would make more sense if we would show this as a rental balance because and use that as a basis for calculating remaining months.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
You lost me on the very last statement.

Matthias Miller  1:20:30
So the remaining months is basically what's your rental balance divided by your monthly subtotal. Correct? Okay. Are you fine making this be a rental balance?

Speaker 1  1:20:42
Sure. So then this and the rental balance includes what, just

Unknown Speaker  1:20:50
the rent you haven't paid,

Matthias Miller  1:20:53
ignoring late fees, okay, and we won't have any forgiveness. And I think, but then the question is, do you want to include, how do you want to show CRA with that you wouldn't okay?

Speaker 1  1:21:20
See, CRA is an amount that's applied at the point of payoff. And it's, it's so in the case of an EPO, it's EPO plus rental balance is the is the final quote dollars that are actually being transacted, although you're only actually paying the EPO.

Speaker 5  1:21:37
So EPO plus you said plus you said, plus rental

Speaker 1  1:21:42
balance. Sorry, EPO, plus CRA is the amount that that, but the CRA is money held, so it's just, it's it's an internal transaction, but the so the customer is only paying the EPO. But when reflecting these, when reflecting in this report, when reflecting these values, we're not going to reflect whether, whether the customer, we're not going to put those two numbers together. I think there would be value in representing a column for CRA so you can, you can immediately see which, which contracts have a CRA. Yeah. Oh, why do we have negatives

Unknown Speaker  1:22:36
calculating that it shouldn't

Unknown Speaker  1:22:37
I don't think those are CRA contracts.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:41
We should just bulletproof the macro to make sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46
I'll do that

Speaker 1  1:22:48
scroll so there should be like, two or three in there. Matthias just to verify, yep, there goes two, two or three. Yeah. I saw him go, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:22:55
So,

Speaker 1  1:22:59
okay, so the rental balance. And some, some that, some that column as well.

Matthias Miller  1:23:07
Okay, so the rental balance is the contract value, the full contract value, minus payments made. How's

Unknown Speaker  1:23:22
that? Than what the rental balance you said? No,

Matthias Miller  1:23:24
I mean, that is, that is what I'm saying, rental balance. I mean, okay, right? Yes, okay, so then with tax. So

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45
so we have the contract event total. We

Matthias Miller  1:23:49
have a contract value with that. I mean, sure we can

Unknown Speaker  1:23:58
contract event Total is with tax would be better.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
Um, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:24:25
so then the remaining months

Matthias Miller  1:24:33
should be about right, or should be right. 521, dot. 48 divided by 2425 214, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
Okay. Dwayne, for the for the EPO calculation, we're subtracting the CRA amount, but adding in tax on the CRA amount. Um, then we're taking the purchase, the effective value, minus how much we paid towards that, plus any other fees, plus any unpaid other fees, we should also, we should also include paid we should also handle security deposits.

Speaker 1  1:25:54
No, no, you don't need to handle security deposits because it's not the customer can EPO it out and leave the security deposit there and request that we send them the money back. I know that doesn't make sense, but that is the that is the way that it's effectively works,

Matthias Miller  1:26:14
minus forgiven. So that's so this gives us the I

Matthias Miller  1:26:24
and theoretically this is including tax.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:31
Make it early payoff,

Matthias Miller  1:26:34
early payoff, right?

Speaker 5  1:26:40
I don't not convinced that it's including tax. If you look at contract total balance paid, I don't think that includes tax.

Matthias Miller  1:26:51
No, none of these. We're implying tax in the whole

Speaker 5  1:26:54
Oh, I see, I see, okay, yeah. And then,

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
which technically it would, once again, probably be better to do this.

Matthias Miller  1:27:13
This guy should probably be,

Speaker 5  1:27:17
I mean, this one should just, we could potentially add it well, it should just look at contract event total. Is that will automatically. I mean, you can do that for now. I'm saying long term, this macro should be changed. Look at

Matthias Miller  1:27:35
right, but we don't have a macro for the taxable portion.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:40
Or not, okay, not existing, yeah. All right.

Speaker 1  1:27:50
I need to drop off again. If you need me to, if you need me to jump back on it, it'll be about 40 ish minutes, 45 minutes, so I would be available again.

Matthias Miller  1:27:59
Great. That was good. Thanks. All right,

Speaker 5  1:28:11
wouldn't we just assume that total balance paid includes tax by default or not?

Matthias Miller  1:28:19
So total balance paid is not actually total balance paid. It's cash portion paid. Yeah, so we can, I mean, we could directly assume. We could directly assume it. It's not immediately obvious true to me, at least, so then these guys can then become total, which gives us litigate some rounding errors.

Matthias Miller  1:29:00
And then this one

Unknown Speaker  1:29:05
includes tax.

Matthias Miller  1:29:12
Dwf is not we're not handling taxability on tax here, on this one, I I'm

Matthias Miller  1:29:48
okay, so remaining months.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:05
2600

Matthias Miller  1:30:18
this doesn't make sense to me, though, how do you get if monthly payments are 128, how do you get only 26 months left?

Speaker 5  1:30:30
Um, it's that on for the math is based on the rental balance. 128, 5510, 26 is, gives me 333, 4230, okay, so maybe off by his side, but fine.

Matthias Miller  1:30:49
I'm bad at approximating math. Obviously, that makes

Speaker 5  1:30:52
sense. I'm good at punching numbers in my calculator. That's same

Unknown Speaker  1:30:56
what I should be doing. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:31:00
this is looking a lot better, like you can eyeball and say, Oh yeah, that is about three payments, and EPO is consistently less than does

Speaker 5  1:31:17
look like. Our numbers are mildly we have weird rounding stuff. I think, but

Matthias Miller  1:31:21
I would expect that.

Speaker 4  1:31:25
Well, we're rounding at most steps of the way, intentionally, right?

Matthias Miller  1:31:40
Well, can I push this guys and then you can grab the

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
drive search?

Matthias Miller  1:31:54
There's a handful of two dudes, I think, to clean up. We added a bunch of prompts, and then clean up the macros. I think it's right. It's a little nerve wracking here,

Speaker 5  1:32:06
but oh my word, yeah. Do you want security deposit anywhere on the report?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:16
Why wouldn't I wonder if we want to.

Matthias Miller  1:32:42
I would was wondering about combining them, but I'm not sure it is kind of nice to be able to say that see the type of contract. Yeah, implicitly, I

Unknown Speaker  1:33:10
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:33:17
okay, we'll do this then. Hmm,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:27
I'd have to go to BBs for that. Rick, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:35
good.

Matthias Miller  1:33:37
Anything else, I don't anything else. Oh, right. US round three, and we'll see from here. Yeah. Okay, sweet. Thank you guys, thank you. Sounds good. See ya.
