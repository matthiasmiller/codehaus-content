Unknown Speaker  00:32
All right so

Unknown Speaker  00:42
wanted to touch base first about this

Unknown Speaker  00:45
sales opportunity Ellis

Unknown Speaker  00:56
what I actually should

Unknown Speaker  00:56
do is put an LS as comments

Unknown Speaker  01:08
signal

Unknown Speaker  01:23
so I guess just looking for

Unknown Speaker  01:32
where to go with this Do we

Matthias Miller  01:49
just to be clear Weaver Linda's fine with them looking to reuse this.

Speaker 1  01:55
We haven't talked to we related about that yet. Bruce, I'm not sure how Richard and Bruce connected but I'm guessing at some some event and Bruce was showing him

Unknown Speaker  02:09
we're showing him their system

Speaker 1  02:12
and Richard was seeing that it looked like it would do pretty much everything they want it to do there are some differences like some of this state specific reporting would be different

Unknown Speaker  02:32
Richards group

Speaker 1  02:33
does it does their annual renewal with the calendar year

Unknown Speaker  02:39
instead of instead of June.

Unknown Speaker  02:44
So there'll be some things like that that would be different but a lot of the stuff would be very similar

Unknown Speaker  02:56
and they possibly want to

Speaker 1  02:59
to have some more strict permissions for not admins what they can view

Unknown Speaker  03:07
but I think that would be would be one of the

Speaker 1  03:16
one of the first things to do is to talk to we really and and say hey, yeah, where do we go with this

Unknown Speaker  03:32
and see if they'd be willing

Speaker 1  03:33
if they're willing to for us to reuse their system at the foundations of it

Unknown Speaker  03:42
and give them a calm

Matthias Miller  03:54
Yeah, well, cci is interested in recouping about I don't remember what the number is. They're looking to recoup from this

Unknown Speaker  04:03
as well.

Matthias Miller  04:07
So yes, talking to Bruce about it, saying basically Bruce, here's what we're looking to do.

Unknown Speaker  04:17
Or I think just saying here's our plan.

Matthias Miller  04:25
We would like to take them through an in depth design goes meticulously through your proposal and and find out what it is that's sidenote have we updated we will and spec

Unknown Speaker  04:41
as living spec. Now Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:49
So

Unknown Speaker  04:50
no, it's it's still in the rough.

Matthias Miller  04:56
It'd be really nice to get that done first. Yeah for sure Do you know what the timeline would be for

Unknown Speaker  05:03
doing that then

Unknown Speaker  05:11
it's

Speaker 1  05:12
honestly it's kind of a mess in there right now we've the there are a whole bunch of links to product changes and change requests and stuff incidents in there

Unknown Speaker  05:26
it almost I think the idea

Speaker 1  05:30
was we're putting all those links in there that we can then go in and and follow those links and see all the other details all the changes that have been made I almost feel like it would actually be better to just with how with how rough the original one was and how many changes have been made since then.

Speaker 2  05:52
It might almost be best just to start from scratch like we are

Unknown Speaker  05:57
with zfp

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Yeah, I don't know how long that we don't really have a good benchmark for how long it'll take

Unknown Speaker  06:15
That's painful.

Unknown Speaker  06:48
Think I think you're

Unknown Speaker  06:48
right though like it would be

Unknown Speaker  07:15
or would it be actually

Speaker 1  07:21
does doing the high level design with Richard makes sense? Kind of as a cleanroom design, we just talk to him and hear from him what he wants what they need

Unknown Speaker  07:37
and then compare it with what with what we weren't we weren't already has that better than trying to shoehorn them into what we were learning has even if it looks, what cursory overview that looks like it'll be a good fit?

Unknown Speaker  09:23
Hang on I need to

Speaker 2  10:14
Sorry I have a client down situation here give me one moment

Unknown Speaker  10:26
it's not ideal but it is.

Unknown Speaker  13:40
Okay sorry I'm back so

Unknown Speaker  14:11
I need to make one more note to myself that I could anyway

Unknown Speaker  14:25
so

Matthias Miller  14:31
quickly cleanroom design versus not cleanroom design I think

Matthias Miller  14:48
as long as we have consent to use use we've really designed as a starting point I don't really see a huge need for cleanroom design you would argue with me?

Speaker 1  15:04
No, I think you're right that we don't need, like, if we have the consent, which I'm pretty sure they'd get us. I think it'd be fine. I guess my question would be more just to make sure that we're not trying.

Speaker 2  15:19
They were not getting the cart before the horse in this

Speaker 1  15:27
the high level of the cleanroom, high level design might be, you know, $1,000 engagements that have 3500. Just to talk with them and, and hear their business process and all of that, and not not put together all the details that we normally would

Unknown Speaker  15:55
I feel like

Speaker 1  15:58
maybe we didn't have something similar. But I feel like we might have had something similar in the past where we had a system that we tried to,

Unknown Speaker  16:07
no, maybe we did. We thought

Speaker 1  16:13
passes. Yeah, that's we were we were wanting to do something like that was pass.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
I don't know if there's

Matthias Miller  16:20
any others.

Unknown Speaker  16:25
We've been thinking about it some with the ads management.

Unknown Speaker  16:31
as well.

Unknown Speaker  16:34
They've never went to never went anywhere. Yeah.

Speaker 2  16:45
He's already seen, we rely on system and he, he thinks it would work for them.

Unknown Speaker  17:03
So I guess, if we

Speaker 1  17:04
would, if we would just base it off of that, if we wouldn't do the

Unknown Speaker  17:07
cleanroom

Speaker 1  17:09
initial approach, then we could go like LFC and go straight to the indepth design and, and go through all the comparisons and all of that?

Unknown Speaker  17:18
Well, here's what we could do. We could say

Matthias Miller  17:30
we're still going to do high level design, the high level design

Unknown Speaker  17:35
is going to be

Matthias Miller  17:41
meticulously going through. Well, taking a few passes or a pass through

Unknown Speaker  17:49
the system. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
My brains a

Matthias Miller  18:01
little tired with this. I think maybe my question is

Unknown Speaker  18:06
what gives us the

Matthias Miller  18:10
80% of the ideal outcome with needing to reinvent with needing to invent as little as possible

Unknown Speaker  18:23
Sure.

Matthias Miller  18:25
And I feel like if we had the if we had the living spec up to date, then the high level design could just be we're going to walk through this

Unknown Speaker  18:37
maybe you're right maybe you're right

Unknown Speaker  18:48
what if we?

Matthias Miller  19:24
Well, okay, there's two questions here. Number one. If if they're willing to conform the current processes, and make adjustments to it to reuse the Riverland system, then well, then there's our answer, then it's going to work. Probably, you know, 70% chance and there's this 5% chance that we'll find something that wildly throws up the whole project. We can't do it at all. And maybe it's more like 1%

Unknown Speaker  19:58
but if they're willing to die Have their processes

Matthias Miller  20:02
to if, if they are hardcore set that how they do it is the way they have to do it, then, yes, we need to have a robust process and maybe doing a high level design actually makes sense. My My concern is that it's, it's a lot more work to do. It's a lot more work to say, How can I take this product and this product? And let me find the shared the shared pieces of it and come up with a third thing? That's pretty complicated. It's much easier to say, okay, here is the product. What do you need to change to get it to fit to you? And I think that's the question that we need to be asking if we're not doing a full up full, full straight up custom built

Unknown Speaker  20:55
for them. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  21:02
Yeah, I think so. So basically, we need to know.

Unknown Speaker  21:06
We need to know their willingness

Speaker 1  21:09
to change. And we also need to know

Unknown Speaker  21:14
how much they would need to change.

Matthias Miller  21:17
And then we'll need to figure out, yes. And I think if they're generally open to change that I think I think it's reasonable to do a.

Matthias Miller  21:39
I'm very much a fan of what of a discovery process here of some kind. Is there openness to change? Maybe it's a matter of, well, let us go get this thing cleaned up? Or maybe it's a matter of?

Unknown Speaker  22:05
No, here's what we do. They haven't Access database, right?

Matthias Miller  22:14
Either way, even for the sake of migration, are we going to want to know what their existing data model is?

Matthias Miller  22:23
So why would we not make the $3,500 engagement

Speaker 2  22:26
basically be, we are going to.

Matthias Miller  22:57
We want to go through your existing system. And we're gonna, we want to find out what you're already doing. And we want to identify as many gaps as we can more off of our memory and knowledge versus and so basically is the same process. Let's walk through the database, let's find all the data points. And let's assemble a data model. And then let's go find and come up with reports, high level design, and then let's figure out where those variations are, before we end look for things that that throws a set off sideways.

Unknown Speaker  23:32
That I really like huh?

Unknown Speaker  23:47
We think, yeah, I think that probably sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  23:57
Because some of these

Speaker 1  23:57
questions, yeah, that will help us to have more clarity to answer some of the questions.

Unknown Speaker  24:04
For example,

Speaker 1  24:06
yeah, there probably will be some, some big changes that they're not willing or able to make such as, you know, state reporting, they are going to have their states are going to be of different reporting requirements.

Unknown Speaker  24:24
Their,

Speaker 1  24:26
their period start, you're going with the calendar year. They might not be willing or able to change that. But that might be a system switch. It might already be a system switch actually. Or something like that, that we can we can set so there might be some things like that, but then there might be other things that they can

Speaker 2  24:49
actually make adjustments and whatnot. So yeah, no, I think I

Unknown Speaker  25:08
think that's probably right

Unknown Speaker  25:11
before we make commitments one way or the other

Unknown Speaker  25:15
we do that discovery process like you said

Unknown Speaker  25:29
and I would also

Speaker 1  25:30
like if they only have 1000 vehicles there you know a 10th of the size we will end as far as quantity the vehicles

Unknown Speaker  25:44
don't know if they're willing or able to spend what what we will unspent

Speaker 1  25:56
so that's where having that flexibility to to adapt to minimal changes

Unknown Speaker  26:01
can very much be in their favor

Unknown Speaker  26:21
I'm not sure if you're talking with us or not but you're muted

Matthias Miller  26:24
no I'm sorry I just meant like I said Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:27
I agree

Unknown Speaker  26:43
well, so what next yeah

Unknown Speaker  26:58
so HLD

Matthias Miller  26:59
with Richard is

Unknown Speaker  27:02
is

Matthias Miller  27:04
somebody determining what their needs are based on their existing

Unknown Speaker  27:07
system or cleanroom design

Matthias Miller  27:17
or yeah going through going through going through the existing system?

Unknown Speaker  28:02
Identify points of difference

Matthias Miller  28:47
and then it looks like a good match to base it off and we will insist and then we need to create a insurance management of

Unknown Speaker  28:58
vehicle insurance spec.

Speaker 1  29:53
I guess some of that too would also be determining based on whatever

Speaker 2  29:58
points of difference would be

Unknown Speaker  30:08
like wood

Unknown Speaker  30:09
wood we rely on become the standard and then

Matthias Miller  30:14
no we would have a we would have a shared base catalog

Unknown Speaker  30:19
is

Matthias Miller  30:27
I mean it's similar to the app hosting context module except it's only used by two clients

Speaker 1  30:45
so then this clearing out all the data and we realized system actually isn't

Unknown Speaker  30:51
really necessary because we would actually be

Speaker 1  30:57
we almost do is spin up a new

Unknown Speaker  31:02
demo system

Matthias Miller  31:05
we could spin up a blank Riverland another blank Riverland system under under a different

Unknown Speaker  31:10
domain.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Okay

Unknown Speaker  32:29
so does that look look good to you?

Unknown Speaker  32:37
Yep

Unknown Speaker  32:43
yep all right so then

Speaker 1  33:10
for right now then I would need to

Unknown Speaker  33:14
run this by LS

Unknown Speaker  33:22
Bruce

Unknown Speaker  33:38
and then go from there so that's unraid Yep. Okay.

Speaker 1  33:45
All right, well then I will plan to follow up on that make a note

Unknown Speaker  33:50
here

Unknown Speaker  34:12
okay excellent

Unknown Speaker  34:25
All right.

Speaker 1  34:26
Next would be again similar, different I'm talking about the Z FB SFB client the change requests that I had sent out

Matthias Miller  34:50
let's see wherever the

Unknown Speaker  34:51
IS.

Unknown Speaker  35:03
subject of

Unknown Speaker  35:04
call with FB client today had to

Unknown Speaker  35:08
change requests in it so

Speaker 1  35:16
just curious as far as I guess we can just track our time discussing this on either one of those 7460 Maybe

Speaker 1  35:31
so yeah, just discussing this what we would see as being next steps forward on these

Unknown Speaker  35:43
one of the

Speaker 1  35:44
big big questions here is the question about possibly merging the two systems

Unknown Speaker  35:58
sounds like they're

Speaker 1  35:59
they're coming more and more together as far as people working in both systems and and this needing the systems to talk to each other better so that's that's something that he had interest in and still being able to have some some permissions and data restrictions and whatnot

Unknown Speaker  36:25
and then there's a whole bunch of other stuff

Unknown Speaker  36:29
some some large things some small things

Unknown Speaker  36:51
well

Matthias Miller  37:10
okay, here's the answer. What's their urgency on the portal?

Speaker 1  37:15
Um, none of it is super urgent it would be let's see. I think all of it they would want done by by August

Unknown Speaker  37:34
because that's when

Speaker 1  37:35
like they've just come through their busy season this starts in the fall and then they're going through kind of a dead are low have a slow season here in the next few months. So from their standpoint here in the next few months, I think would be a good time to go through the design. And then they'd want it up and running for for when things pick up again,

Unknown Speaker  37:59
starting in August can we use or

Speaker 2  38:09
could we should we use our cockpits for this cockpits?

Unknown Speaker  38:25
We don't have a demo card

Matthias Miller  38:33
so we have new functionality on the platform level. I think I sent an email about this, but we've demoed it that allows you to set a it's a different type of restriction. It's what detail screens are you allowed to look at? You can't view report settings you can't run the expression editor. You have a homepage report.

Speaker 2  39:00
And you can only view certain detail screens Uh huh.

Unknown Speaker  39:26
So would that be

Unknown Speaker  40:20
It would be wildly cheaper if we could do that rather than we need to manage then we'd have to manage

Speaker 2  40:37
user profile records or have a some type of signup process and

Matthias Miller  40:48
once we get up standard we'll have a framework for building out these types of things that might make this easier

Matthias Miller  41:36
do they need new signups in the member portal or is this just for existing members

Speaker 1  41:50
think so like they've already have their their online signup online application today so I think it looks like it's just logging in to see information related change information the contact information ability to change member information

Speaker 2  42:11
and then if they can do that on the SPE side then

Speaker 1  42:20
they would like to be able to do something similar for businesses and schools and and families on

Unknown Speaker  42:29
the scholarship side

Speaker 1  42:41
Oh, actually, I guess for the businesses they say send a link

Unknown Speaker  42:51
Yeah, I'm not sure exactly

Unknown Speaker  42:52
how all of that would work

Speaker 1  43:11
yeah, it does look like they're talking about filling out and updating applications for the schools and

Unknown Speaker  43:15
businesses. So yeah, there would be there's

Unknown Speaker  43:27
gonna be a lot of questions here of how, how they want it to work and whatnot.

Speaker 1  44:03
I guess my main the big question here for me, and I would be like, as far as general path forward, would this be? Should we have them sign up for a design phase? For us to be able to

Unknown Speaker  44:21
work on all of this

Unknown Speaker  44:23
one swoop, put it all in a proposal with an X FB section and zfp section

Unknown Speaker  44:31
and design it all out that way?

Speaker 1  44:36
Should we handle it more piecemeal and find out what we already have an order of priority here?

Unknown Speaker  44:45
So we're going to Well,

Matthias Miller  44:53
one question I would have is, is it really that much work to combine them besides the fact that we need To sync contacts across. I think contacts are the only things that are shared between the two systems.

Speaker 1  45:10
Yeah, if you don't have many other similarities Well, there will be businesses but I'm not sure if the businesses or even exactly the same. Well,

Matthias Miller  45:23
businesses are a different database level in

Unknown Speaker  45:30
an FBS MPSS Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  45:38
Okay. I guess here they don't

Speaker 2  45:43
they just use contacts for the members. Yeah. Gotcha.

Matthias Miller  45:58
With Okay, in terms of merging, okay, I think the portal, that might be a more in depth, but as far as merging, I think this could start as a change request

Unknown Speaker  46:12
to merge the two systems

Unknown Speaker  46:27
are they okay, losing activity history? Probably, probably. So.

Unknown Speaker  46:37
Do you have any edits in this incident, if I don't?

Unknown Speaker  47:14
And they'd be losing

Speaker 1  47:14
it for one of the systems whichever one is being closed down? Or would we merge the two together into a brand? System?

Unknown Speaker  47:22
No, we would.

Matthias Miller  47:25
Effectively, what we would do is we would do

Speaker 2  47:29
an export from all of the fields and

Unknown Speaker  47:41
I need to

Matthias Miller  47:42
drop off here. Other things to consider are separate menu options, you know, for? I mean, it's it just you just have SPE and FBSS and BSB E? Or what, what are the menu titles? Checking with the development team, slash LS and how the migration should work? Well, first checking with the development team to make sure that we can to find any issues with merging these two catalogs together, the two systems together to one coming up with the exports, from the old system imports into the new, perhaps doing a trial run on a test system.

Speaker 2  48:32
And then looking for all what are the types of configuration changes,

Matthias Miller  48:39
scheduled tasks or any other system switches or app posting settings or any other types of configure user profiles? Any other types of configuration changes that need to be made? Are there permissions that need to be put into place for people who only have access to half but not the other? And I think I think the short answer on this is this might be more in depth than it's a conventional change request, but we should track time on that change request. And then we may need to recoup some of that

Speaker 2  49:14
because of scope that's that's something that can be decided

Matthias Miller  49:25
and regarding permissions, we may need new permissions as well.

Unknown Speaker  49:50
Yeah

Speaker 1  49:56
okay, so you would see that as being first step then once everything is together in one system, one database, then that simplifies things to move forward

Speaker 2  50:08
with, with the other changes. Well,

Matthias Miller  50:14
I think some of the some of the spreadsheets and stuff, I don't know, are the spreadsheets pulling from both systems?

Unknown Speaker  50:23
I don't think so. I don't think so.

Matthias Miller  50:25
I mean, I don't see any reasons reason why each of the spreadsheets can be additional change requests as well. The businesses checkbox can be a change request.

Unknown Speaker  50:44
I mean, I don't

Matthias Miller  50:45
know, you think we should do this as one fell swoop? Because it's because of the scope of

Unknown Speaker  50:49
changes?

Speaker 1  50:51
The scope and quantity? This feels like it could be, it could be easiest, just to put it all into one central location of a proposal. And I don't know if Ellis would want to charge them for a design phase? Or not? Just because of how many things are are here.

Matthias Miller  51:15
mean, it seems to me if they're discrete pieces. That should be?

Unknown Speaker  51:19
I don't know, maybe it's me. But

Unknown Speaker  51:26
what's that?

Matthias Miller  51:28
I mean, if it's discrete pieces, it feels to me like the change request process is pretty much dialed in.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
And works well.

Matthias Miller  51:37
And less likely that things get lost and say, Oh, well, we met this and we have a process for getting the living spec updated. And, you know, fill in the blank. Now. We're the portal itself, the portal seems like that, in and of itself is a is a major conglomerate section of reports and things like that, that need to be developed or whiskey that needs to be developed. And that needs to be handled. I think that would make sense but

Matthias Miller  52:15
don't know, and you could even put these under you could make all these change requests under

Unknown Speaker  52:20
a parent. job if you wanted to

Matthias Miller  52:25
fit FBI updates 2023, summer 2023 And just categorize them that way. And then we can we can still because we'll still want to bid each of these individually. And then and then Bill for an

Speaker 2  52:36
aggregate. Right. I think I don't know.

Matthias Miller  52:44
Gotta be done.

Speaker 1  52:48
That's fine. We've done both before both approaches before? Yeah, both have their pros and cons. So.

Unknown Speaker  52:57
Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  53:00
At the end of the day, as long as it's streamlined enough on the development side, and not tons of hassle to well, anyway. It's pros and cons.

Unknown Speaker  53:14
Either way, if there's a

Matthias Miller  53:17
you're in the trenches, if there's a compelling reason to do it all as a single design process. It's an open to that as well.

Speaker 1  53:25
Okay, sure. Well, yeah, I'll take a look at it and Okay, sounds good. Thanks a lot. Yep.
