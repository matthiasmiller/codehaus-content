Matthias Miller  00:00
Or, I mean, you're not a tech company by definition, if you're doing this. So so size the company to have investable capital and cash flow to make it work to it takes a certain kind of founder, for sure, because there are some founders it you have to have a spark of creative genius and and the

Unknown Speaker  00:30
here Hang on,

Matthias Miller  00:35
I gotta drop off in 10 minutes. Here I Yeah, so, because, because, I don't know how, well, well, probably, probably don't have enough people in our network to name news, but you get that, you can think of the straight up hyper pragmatic business owner, like, let's just give me the system, rinse and repeat, keep it simple. Oh, it worked over here. Let's do it over here. Like, like, and that's kind of the quintessential business owner, to be completely candid. That's not the guy. And then the third component is, is there has to be some kind of custom element in the business, like, either, I mean, ideally, they literally are unique in the marketplace.

Matthias Miller  01:29
Well, I mean, sometimes it is, and then sometimes there are times, there are times but, but there's a lot of times where they just decided to do something different, and then they formulate. One of my mentors has an interesting saying. He says that the the the Enneagram, is your personal brand of narcissism, which is basically your own way of self protecting. And for some people, being unique is really, really important. And and I've, I've fallen into that trap far too often. And so yeah, like, I just want to be unique. I want to stand out. And I in the sense that you have to be super unique in order to be successful. But yeah, there's also the component of, there's sometimes integrations between kind of disparate or not normally connected industries that where, where these types of Things can make sense so many types of

Speaker 1  02:42
dealers. One works for what our customers are. But there is, as new COVID, different types of businesses that we could attracted to. We had a couple more things in this kind of vehicle that merchant suite is designed to be one software solution that we like to solution, and some businesses are just separated, right? Businesses?

Unknown Speaker  03:22
Now? Yeah, program, sure. Happy to hear any.

Speaker 1  04:00
Become happy to hear any ideas that you have on. I mean, just completely transparent with you. We just hire with our own cash COVID. So we're kind of out of place right now. Our monitor labor dollar pretty closely, and we're Doing great. Now, hire us and quickly. Xi,

Unknown Speaker  04:40
the final three. So I think in the next out of

Speaker 2  04:47
five years, really about what.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
Resources together,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
Yeah, yeah, important.

Unknown Speaker  05:43
That makes sense, it doesn't but I don't

Unknown Speaker  05:49
care. I would rather have a sustainable

Unknown Speaker  05:56
situation trying to

Unknown Speaker  06:02
balance that. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:06
five years is very short, both on the business side, both on the family side. So

Unknown Speaker  06:09
yeah, yep, all right.

Matthias Miller  06:15
All right, we'll do great chatting. Yep. Thanks, Jason.

Unknown Speaker  06:32
Recording your progress.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
You hello,

Matthias Miller  07:38
I'm sorry. Oh, it's all good. We needed to wrap anyway. Pretty good. I think gotta figure out what to do with people who say, Hey, we love collaborating. And then like, Okay, but what? What's your picture of that? I Oh,

Matthias Miller  08:05
well, yeah. Anyway, where do I fit into fitted?

Matthias Miller  08:14
That's fair. If it's common, it's not sensitive, it says It's not common, whatever maybe I walk.

Unknown Speaker  08:32
Okay? Do?

Matthias Miller  08:49
Yeah, potentially, potentially,

Unknown Speaker  09:01
I need to figure out how. I

Matthias Miller  09:05
need to figure out how to, how to make all of that really work on my end and even see, yeah, well, Let's go through it. I It's second

Unknown Speaker  09:29
point, sure you

Matthias Miller  09:40
here. Let me try. I can. Okay, there we go. I've messed up my office layout with Murph here so i.

Speaker 3  10:00
To compute over here. So this document for sure, I am writing heads like I know how to write this image,

Unknown Speaker  10:19
how to use documents. Information, how to update this document as you're going through it.

Unknown Speaker  10:31
If it doesn't make

Unknown Speaker  10:33
sense to make it work,

Unknown Speaker  10:35
coverage, don't know. That's still true, not logging. For me, you don't have to

Speaker 3  10:52
do this, but I've tried to start loosely keeping track of how long certain parts of this

Unknown Speaker  10:59
are taking these are the links to the training

Speaker 3  11:03
videos. I don't know if you need to watch it

Unknown Speaker  11:16
here, but in case, I just put

Unknown Speaker  11:28
out your basic

Speaker 4  11:33
workflow is just sort of a

Speaker 3  11:40
checklist of what I'm doing, the order I'm doing, how I'm doing it really just start at the beginning, kind of, kind of checking in

Unknown Speaker  11:48
on gender, sure, and then the

Unknown Speaker  11:52
end to means are, how is the deeper level of how To actually, how I choose, how the process may be. Process. The big one that you're going to need, and I am working on is how to create a function, and it's sort of a long, potentially involved process with a lot of people that, depending

Speaker 5  12:21
on the situation, up, yep, okay,

Speaker 4  12:54
sure, yep, I

Matthias Miller  13:07
metal structures, not As I mean, a little bit sheds more so I

Unknown Speaker  13:23
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  13:40
Yep,

Matthias Miller  13:56
assigned is what it's called here. I think I a

Matthias Miller  14:06
lot of time I

Speaker 5  14:20
up a lot of times I

Unknown Speaker  14:52
it's. I just know now it isn't so

Unknown Speaker  15:29
bad. I just been opening them up, grabbing their Copy.

Speaker 4  15:46
Sure, yep. Sometimes I'm adding it with the

Unknown Speaker  16:00
code using this sometimes I'm adding it, sometimes discussion, if it's a New lead

Unknown Speaker  16:10
I'm trying to manually

Unknown Speaker  16:16
Put into Jennifer.

Unknown Speaker  16:22
I right? I

Unknown Speaker  17:08
got it, yep,

Speaker 5  17:21
that makes sense. Yeah, pipeline follow up. So here's where,

Speaker 3  17:29
here's where some of the work really start happening. I just went in and out. They were five days. I just went through and opened them up and I moved a whole bunch of them lost because they were actually back from January, but

Unknown Speaker  17:49
just reminder to add or

Speaker 3  17:52
top view tag anytime you want to. So scroll through messenger first and find anything that looks like a response. That that's actually responded to again, because he gave us enough information to start

Unknown Speaker  18:16
working on right, nice, focus on seeing

Speaker 3  18:21
as no so what I do have, I guess, another interesting thing to take a look at is I have started finding some things to find, and generally, what those are things that he's actively in the middle of pursuing or Go now, sometimes they're things that just seem really questionable. They're not sure what to do. But I've been sending him a list every day of messages based on this my export and then I filter down the CSV file so that he can keep track of things he hasn't used it yet, but maybe over time, he doesn't.

Unknown Speaker  19:07
Conversation right when I'm going

Unknown Speaker  19:16
to do this job? There.

Matthias Miller  19:37
Probably be in there,

Unknown Speaker  19:46
and I just have the option to go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  19:57
film for Mike, and if there's any conversation, okay, this. Right,

Unknown Speaker  20:00
right,

Speaker 5  20:06
yep, yep, right,

Matthias Miller  20:17
Oh, for sure it is. It makes sense. So then

Speaker 3  20:22
after all that, speaking of which, this is taking a lot of time, just like checking, it's getting less and less time attempting, because obviously I'm learning more. And how do I refer back to my document list so I can

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Answer questions,

Unknown Speaker  21:01
We can't automate.

Unknown Speaker  21:39
Yep, So

Unknown Speaker  22:09
service sector,

Unknown Speaker  22:38
Okay, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  22:54
answering that kind of thing on

Unknown Speaker  23:02
The so that big piece, on

Unknown Speaker  23:27
that role, right? Right?

Unknown Speaker  23:37
Steve I

Unknown Speaker  23:47
yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  24:12
Yep,

Matthias Miller  24:18
where's the Like the scripts, like how you address it. Remind me again on that this response guide, i

Speaker 6  24:50
Us i have. This would be great. I'm Like my

Unknown Speaker  25:34
right, yeah,

Speaker 6  25:42
okay, seems pretty straightforward

Matthias Miller  25:57
on the tariff side of things, like those two part messages, how does the Second part? Are you going to clarify that? Like that one? Like one A, yeah, sorry.

Matthias Miller  26:20
Yeah, right, export explanation, if needed.

Unknown Speaker  26:39
Oh, yeah,

Matthias Miller  26:41
understand I'm notorious for doing Things like that. Good. I

Speaker 6  27:00
On she's got next Yeah, have many

Unknown Speaker  28:02
times say,

Speaker 4  28:18
it, yeah, I freezer. Yeah, So sure, yep.

Unknown Speaker  28:58
Interesting.

Unknown Speaker  29:07
That sounds good. All right,

Matthias Miller  29:12
so I mean, then, then, from, you know, giant step back, we're getting some interest in things that might close. I

Unknown Speaker  29:35
Okay, sure, I

Unknown Speaker  29:44
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  29:57
right, I.

Matthias Miller  30:19
Some of the voicemail if, if Mike is up to it, we could do by by appointment. But obviously, if his health is, you know, setting phone appointments, but if his health is, yeah,

Speaker 4  30:57
i Sure i

Unknown Speaker  31:11
This is,

Unknown Speaker  31:21
yep,

Matthias Miller  31:29
I think setup is here's what I think. I think this is a service that's incredibly valuable to salespeople, because this is not how they think, and this is everything they don't want to do.

Matthias Miller  31:52
I love it, I should. I mean, this is why we want you hoping to revive dealer leads, when, when there's room. All right, so I think this is, this is enough for me to go off of. I think one, one question is, okay, so you have me on the schedule for When. Again, I

Unknown Speaker  32:35
Right? I

Speaker 5  33:05
Yep, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:40
ah, I think the challenge is I don't have time for that,

Unknown Speaker  33:49
Right? So I'm trying to tie that we're

Speaker 6  34:02
doing, like, do I

Unknown Speaker  34:23
Right, right? I

Unknown Speaker  34:46
Right, right. You

Matthias Miller  34:50
You have to get new leads in. And if you have a triage dealing with new leads or reactivated old leads, is the way to go. And there. Is there is going to be diminishing returns on reactivating old leads, the further back we go.

Matthias Miller  35:12
Right. I

Unknown Speaker  35:30
uh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  35:37
Well, it might be worth it. But at that point I was I was wondering if there's a point at which we could just try to reactivate Old leads and not put them into GHL until I

Matthias Miller  36:00
Okay, right?

Matthias Miller  36:15
I, we just check to see what they're responding to, and when we put it in branch from there. I mean, I kind of think, I mean the, I think that's better, that's one efficiency gain, and then, and then and then we can, I mean, even, even going six months back, but if we have a three month block where we're not getting any responses back, I mean, at some point, obviously confirmed with Micah, but I think we should Just stop, like, that's awesome. It's

Unknown Speaker  36:57
gonna be funny.

Unknown Speaker  37:02
I right,

Unknown Speaker  37:12
that's fair. Well,

Matthias Miller  37:21
that's fair. Okay, yeah, I might talk myself out of it. Is it? Would it be worth? One question to ask is, I mean, because we've seen, we've seen leads close after, I don't know what the longest one was, but three, one, year, two year, even three years. So is it worth? Is it worth it well, if we're not putting it in the CRM, that drops time in Half. You're doing about one a minute or

Matthias Miller  37:53
right? I

Matthias Miller  38:05
Yeah. Well, there's also the don't make Facebook angry thing. That's the

Unknown Speaker  38:23
Rick, that's that's fine.

Matthias Miller  39:00
The the thing I wish, if I had a way, if I had time, break, space, capacity, whatever. It's all possible. It's just priority. I mean, this would be great things we could pull from his export. We could say, oh, here's, here's his message, here's his conversation. Volume, five month. I

Unknown Speaker  39:28
I should be

Unknown Speaker  39:36
Yeah, Okay,

Matthias Miller  40:03
do you need any more coverage between what we talked about like? I mean, theoretically, when I'm at the, well, I don't know, I don't know how late socializing is going to go over the equity summit and stuff like that, but I

Matthias Miller  40:23
I'm booked Tuesday and Thursday of next week, so it'd have to be Monday and probably indeed, no, none of my, none of my Monday afternoons are, are, are a thing anymore. After all, I

Matthias Miller  40:47
and I'm assuming, if I drop out from like, I don't know if I 30 to eight or something, that It's still i

Unknown Speaker  41:05
Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:40
what you get?

Matthias Miller  41:50
Inadvertent

Matthias Miller  42:02
only, whatever you're doing anytime, and get back and it's worth any

Unknown Speaker  42:20
questions, so

Unknown Speaker  42:22
i i

Matthias Miller  42:55
Let me, let me. Let's tentatively plan that way.

Matthias Miller  43:02
I and this is the hard part in the in between. I

Matthias Miller  43:47
No, we have not, and I've got a whole bunch of contacts and phone numbers.

Matthias Miller  43:59
Yeah, all of my out of offices, yes,

Matthias Miller  44:14
yeah, they are back to back meetings. I am free on Wednesday, on Thursday.

Matthias Miller  44:35
Man, I'm this close to saying I just need to go. Should just see about bringing Jonathan on, or is there anybody else that could cover from for me? Not?

Matthias Miller  45:19
I'm not completely sure I know he builds this, this type of thing for his I think, I think this is the type of thing he kind of sort of builds for his assistance. And I would give it maybe a 5050, chance, but I really just don't know. I

Matthias Miller  45:52
Well, literally, where my head's going is, man, if I would have a niece or nephew who wants some wants to pick up some extra

Unknown Speaker  46:04
side income.

Matthias Miller  46:11
Rhonda is. I mean, if Rhonda would be more tech savvy, she would love the work. But I don't think she's. She's not up to The job. I

Matthias Miller  47:23
I'm not completely opposed looking at like Wednesday night. And Wednesday evening when I'm traveling back, that's the kind of thing I can deal with the plane, I can do from the airport. I'm not going to have other stuff to do. And even, yes, the event starts. I fly out of the springs 1pm or something, and then come back again. Oh, I'm sorry I said the wrong word. I meant Thursday night, Tuesday, but, it's also potentially I am, I'm going to do my best. This is having me the most out of these trips to find some kind of social events on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But I would also guess when we get back to the hotel, it doesn't start until 9am or something. And so even the 11 o'clock, I don't know 11 o'clock scene, 10 or 11, but it's still doable that I can respond

Unknown Speaker  48:27
back to that. So

Matthias Miller  48:29
I if that okay.

Unknown Speaker  48:40
It, yeah, there's

Unknown Speaker  48:59
gonna make me faster About what. Faster procedure.

Speaker 6  49:20
All right? I good

Matthias Miller  49:57
way to test it appreciate a. All your work on this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  50:03
Okay, awesome.

Matthias Miller  50:07
Sounds Good. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:40
Second. Clarifying First,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:26
Hello. I

Speaker 7  1:20:40
Hello, you're gonna have to put up with my weird video.

Matthias Miller  1:20:50
My other fancy web can be map. Go ahead. I

Speaker 8  1:21:10
you know, if we easy, We could all be weak. I

Matthias Miller  1:22:11
That makes sense. I

Speaker 7  1:22:20
fair enough, exactly. It's always good to have People like that. I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:41
solid so

Unknown Speaker  1:23:33
That's fair. I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:15
Right, Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:33
Great, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:24:40
side of things.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:11
Right? I

Matthias Miller  1:25:23
Yeah. Well, your first statement is, what do you want? I keep narrowing down, fine tuning the list of people I love working with. And so should you, you know, it ties into long term vision, all that stuff. I don't really, I mean, we could explore that, but I can't answer that for you.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:47
I

Matthias Miller  1:25:50
don't know the depth of impact for of on prem going forward. I understand Josh doesn't have capacity for it. I understand you're tired. I look at this and I'm like,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05
this is

Matthias Miller  1:26:08
it's a really beautiful opportunity,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
and so

Matthias Miller  1:26:16
but, but you are by NO MEANS obligated to live Your Life by opportunity, I

Matthias Miller  1:27:00
but is there going to come a time where you literally have to have team right Install, or some other weird

Unknown Speaker  1:27:13
thing to run it? I

Unknown Speaker  1:27:59
Right? I'm right?

Matthias Miller  1:28:36
Or you have to, well, I mean, you're not going to be his wities, Right? I

Speaker 6  1:29:02
right Oh, Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:22
right. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:30:13
Yes, you

Unknown Speaker  1:30:25
right?

Speaker 7  1:30:36
You're, you're gonna have to run real development cycles, Real QA, real staging everything,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:00
until it did,

Matthias Miller  1:31:16
you could also, you could also deprecate query records and update records If you wanted to you

Unknown Speaker  1:31:49
Yeah, sure they did,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:57
Right? I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:10
Right? You?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
Business

Unknown Speaker  1:32:42
products On conversation

Unknown Speaker  1:32:50
with Josh,

Matthias Miller  1:33:00
is this one of those things where you roll your eyes and you're like, that's a dumb decision or or is it a betrayal? Basically, right? I

Matthias Miller  1:33:37
Well, that's a terrifying proposition for an organization of that size, just to think, to be between, you know, the The adeng and the and the their vendor, to continue,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:03
right? I

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
Right?

Matthias Miller  1:34:33
So you think it's a business. You

Matthias Miller  1:34:54
keys like a fear of religious persecution almost i.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:25
Use Right?

Speaker 6  1:35:36
I'm Right? Do?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:59
Could we Talk about okay,

Matthias Miller  1:37:19
and we would be open to having a conversation to explore what what that would need to look like

Unknown Speaker  1:37:27
For it to work. I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:01
It's awful. I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:23
it's not there.

Matthias Miller  1:39:34
Why people are curious about Josh and I took a very different stance on AI in the in the development priorities. Meeting Josh basically, was like, Well, it hasn't touched

Unknown Speaker  1:39:45
us yet. And I'm like,

Matthias Miller  1:39:46
yeah, here's what you see. People cranking out spaghetti code. Maintainability is, is becoming an issue. You've got just a lot, lot higher volume, low quality work.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:59
Um. Oh, so it's interesting I just read

Unknown Speaker  1:40:04
already to try to get

Speaker 6  1:40:22
everything here. Training to try to get everything I mean, It's

Unknown Speaker  1:40:42
just mistakes, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:50
Research, sheer insanity, sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:41:28
but I mean fundamentally, two giant sets back. I think they're sold on us, except for community and on Prem. You. We just

Unknown Speaker  1:41:51
got a sales pitch, But we

Unknown Speaker  1:42:11
people, Right? That's Fair to

Unknown Speaker  1:43:40
Okay, this is pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
Students, This is pretty great, right?

Matthias Miller  1:44:37
Well, It's for ourselves in their shoes.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:42
So

Matthias Miller  1:44:45
we've just talked to another vendor, so I'm going to assume, the more that we know about the other vendor, the more helpful it's going to be. Like, I don't know, like, what? What stack do they use? What I.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:00
Don't know if we know that.

Matthias Miller  1:45:08
You know recency ends up being an issue. What have they most recently heard? So I

Unknown Speaker  1:45:20
I ask myself the same

Unknown Speaker  1:45:42
question. Wow, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:49
Something like, I don't know, I

Matthias Miller  1:46:40
I don't know what you think.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:00
Recap of

Matthias Miller  1:47:20
may have some other ideas. There's, there's a draft at least, yeah, what

Unknown Speaker  1:47:32
else is new? What else is new,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:42
right? I I Think this year, I

Unknown Speaker  1:48:30
Think what

Speaker 6  1:48:42
I'm Thank

Unknown Speaker  1:49:02
you. The processes in place,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:51
relying heavily on spreadsheets and what.

Matthias Miller  1:50:06
Individual, separate systems, right, right, disconnected kind of doubling

Unknown Speaker  1:50:22
down. Right? It's

Unknown Speaker  1:50:54
Right? It's

Matthias Miller  1:51:02
not I mean in growing complexity of or growing maintenance challenges with spreadsheets, I would assume is an issue,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:52
but maybe they're not feeling that I

Unknown Speaker  1:53:46
I think it's fair.

Matthias Miller  1:53:55
It doesn't it doesn't speak much to business outcomes

Unknown Speaker  1:54:01
or cost or for business,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:03
impact, growth, impact, anything like that. I

Matthias Miller  1:54:23
reduced overhead and inventory is one example.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:39
Baby I Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:54:42
Well, in an ability to red diversify the revenue, or maybe that's coming, regardless, I don't remember, sadly, if that's it, yeah. So.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:05
maybe 1520, something like that. I Not really I don. very creative on this side of things, but I right? I do you need anything else? I we need anything else. I mean, are you thinking a walk through the proposal, a walk through the through The mock ups? I What does a platform give,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:27
yep, I, it's

Matthias Miller  2:00:50
So I mean, The the i

Unknown Speaker  2:01:20
They could Have people on their side.

Speaker 4  2:01:42
And the call it I The interagency.

Matthias Miller  2:02:22
Change, don't know how to describe like at the

Matthias Miller  2:02:31
well, sure, let's talk about this. At least I

Matthias Miller  2:02:40
I feel like our app hosting brochure probably talked about some of this stuff, but

Unknown Speaker  2:03:10
might be on the

Unknown Speaker  2:03:19
way I thought you should Sometime have that redirect app.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:00
Specific data resources. No,

Matthias Miller  2:04:09
that's usually A constraint validation.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:11

Matthias Miller  2:08:48

Unknown Speaker  2:11:18

Yeah, drop off. All Right? You?

Unknown Speaker  2:12:55
Yeah, That's fine. Matthias,

Matthias Miller  2:13:17
I think you should I think you should devote more time to number three,

Speaker 5  2:13:23
I think I don't think I don't Why don't know.

Matthias Miller  2:13:33
I'm not sure about I

Speaker 9  2:13:40
it should be, should we put the bump three and five down together and let you just have a middle section?

Unknown Speaker  2:14:02
Here's yeah and drop the

Matthias Miller  2:14:07
I don't know that maybe, well, maybe, probably not going to be the most meticulous one going through this. But I don't know that I plan for more than 10 minutes going through the walk through. I it. We might, we might just share like here's a little bit of what

Unknown Speaker  2:14:29
the what the system might look like.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:37
I right to.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:00
Right, okay, I

Unknown Speaker  2:15:20
how would we

Speaker 9  2:15:23
be so then I would, I mean, the last two Ever thought we just

moved together addressing these

Unknown Speaker  2:15:42
concerns? I

Unknown Speaker  2:15:53
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:01
I think it

Unknown Speaker  2:16:04
works for me.

Matthias Miller  2:16:12
If there's anything I would tweak still, I would personally lean towards 20 minutes at the end. But, I mean, but I know they're also Asking for pitch, so I don't know. Basically,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:56
sounds good, yep, plan on it.

Matthias Miller  2:17:02

Unknown Speaker  2:18:19

Unknown Speaker  3:18:26
sub account of mine,

Matthias Miller  3:18:28
Regarding sub accounting, I

Unknown Speaker  3:19:33
Okay, so Well, let me, let me,

Unknown Speaker  3:19:36
if that's the case, I

Matthias Miller  3:19:50
ah, probably not. Did he resolve positively, that this was resolved? I.

Speaker 7  3:20:03
Right? Yeah, that's the that's, that's the

Matthias Miller  3:20:09
issue. I was just following up with a ticket because I didn't have any context. But did he say that? Did He say it was resolved? I

Speaker 4  3:21:00
i don't have access to this particular one, but I will well.

Matthias Miller  3:21:14

Unknown Speaker  3:21:42
him reply. That. Okay, Okay, wonderful.

Unknown Speaker  3:22:02
I you good to know. One other question I had.

Matthias Miller  3:22:15
I've been having trouble converting that sub account into a SaaS mode. And last

Unknown Speaker  3:22:22
time

Matthias Miller  3:22:24
I called into support, they had me disable and re enable SaaS mode, have them fill in the payment information. But I was still not seeing any subscriptions, any way to attach a subscription to

Unknown Speaker  3:22:39
to the account. So

Matthias Miller  3:22:42
I mean, maybe I just need to do a recurring invoice and skip saswa for this account. I don't

Unknown Speaker  3:22:52
know what. Yeah, Same side account.

Speaker 7  3:22:58
Sure. I Okay, it's enabled, but I don't know. I can't attach a SAS plan, correct?

Speaker 8  3:23:40
So I disabled SAS mode, turned it back on, had the client put in payment information, and then went back in.

Unknown Speaker  3:23:53
Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  3:24:06
this is

Speaker 8  3:24:08
correct. That's right. There's no plans here to I Have plaque plans under SAS configurator. I

Unknown Speaker  3:24:51
Okay, so I need to add i.

Speaker 8  3:25:19
Source of use, here. I'm not sure how a new,

Unknown Speaker  3:25:34
okay, How do I create The old i

Unknown Speaker  3:26:22
Hi, no, I don't know. I just created the plans and they showed up like that. Okay. Sounds

Unknown Speaker  3:26:39
good. Sounds good. No problem.

Unknown Speaker  3:26:44
You're further ahead than we've ever been before on This problem, so take your Time.

Unknown Speaker  3:26:53

Unknown Speaker  3:47:36
Sounds good. Hey, hi, there

Matthias Miller  3:47:41
good. How are you?

Speaker 7  3:47:54
Yeah, I have a client that I just added as a sub account, and I was wondering if I can convert them over into SaaS mode. I mean, the most important thing is, I would like to set up automated billing, but if I can easily they're in SaaS mode, if I can easily attach payment to the SaaS mode, that'd be wonderful. And if not, we'll be fine. But I just need to know the best way to get them built automatically.

Speaker 7  3:48:29
Yeah, that's right. So it is. It is connected to SAS mode. There are no subscriptions here. When we go into the SAS configurator, all of my subscriptions Are v2 which appears to be the issue, but oh,

Speaker 6  3:49:00
okay, All right, I'm

Unknown Speaker  3:49:38
sure I

Unknown Speaker  3:49:52
let me. Let me try this in disable, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 7  3:50:03
Do I want to cancel this? Well, I guess there is no subscription, so that doesn't really matter, right?

Speaker 6  3:50:13
Okay, okay, so then i

Unknown Speaker  3:50:30
i got it

Unknown Speaker  3:50:34

Unknown Speaker  3:51:17

Unknown Speaker  3:51:27
Oh, sure.

Unknown Speaker  3:51:29
So I mean, when I it deletes the it

Speaker 8  3:51:33
deletes all the paper. It deletes all the payment methods when I do when I disable SAS mode. So

Unknown Speaker  3:51:38
let's check billing I payments.

Speaker 8  3:51:45
Sorry, this wrong billing. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  3:52:01
Okay, it doesn't have any methods on the sub account.
