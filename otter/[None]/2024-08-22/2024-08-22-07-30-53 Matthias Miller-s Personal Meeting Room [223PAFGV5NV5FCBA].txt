Speaker 1  00:13
One of those. Hey morning, Seth, I am forwarding over

Matthias Miller  00:20
the agenda. Josh is not introduced the support email

Unknown Speaker  00:25
so I have not introduced my water bottle, not

Speaker 2  00:31
going to be just like a worthwhile introduction, hoping I can introduce coffee fairly shortly. It's working on it.

Unknown Speaker  00:39
It's brewing. Correct?

Unknown Speaker  00:44
Nice. There comes through. I

Matthias Miller  01:19
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  01:19
if I'm on a call with you anyway,

Unknown Speaker  01:22
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  01:24
we you had given me that job for asset changing. Ooh, the asset drop list stuff.

Matthias Miller  01:33
I was really confused on that, because I thought that

Unknown Speaker  01:38
I pull up Asset Management.

Matthias Miller  01:39
I thought I had figured out a way in the test system to have the

Speaker 2  01:46
unless I'm just blind as a bat, which is possible, possible, but unlikely, let's be honest, unless, unless it was overridden in zfp or something, and I didn't notice expiration warranty. Sorry, what's the what's the date? Called again, service date,

Unknown Speaker  02:07
service date. That's the inventory asset. That's the wrong Asset Management. Hey,

Matthias Miller  02:16
good morning guys. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  02:20
We have

Speaker 3  02:23
a let's see required true asset service.

Unknown Speaker  02:38
What I would,

Matthias Miller  02:41
what I would do is just see whether it's a future date.

Speaker 2  02:49
Wow, Seth is realizing he's not as smart as he should be. You just have it. You just missed copy when you needed it. That's all. That's probably

Unknown Speaker  02:59
when you work with besides morning, Seth, morning.

Unknown Speaker  03:10
Hey, good morning Mark.

Matthias Miller  03:13
All right, we've got Seth on the call. I think I think there's an email explaining more of this at some point. But I think you guys have already seen I've been getting quite swamped, swamped with some other things, and I'm wanting to get some of these calls to expedite some of this stuff and be able to keep it moving, and may not be as much with bottleneck. So,

Unknown Speaker  03:37
yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4  03:43
Good. So did you want to talk about some of the things that so Jeff was working on, like accounts receivable, some of that? Or do you want to, is it more just getting him familiar with where we're some of the issues we're working with and

Matthias Miller  04:02
well, I mean, we can give you an update. I think there's one little glitch that we had filtering down the assets on the vendor invoice that Seth will take care of this week, but I think everything else should be live as far as pushing assets across to accounting, is that right Seth, or is there components? Yeah,

Speaker 2  04:23
okay, I think it's right. I mean that one thing to fix yet, but it's usable at this point.

Matthias Miller  04:30
So, so we should be seeing those vendor invoices, I guess drew this could be something for you to check or mark, or whoever, but we should be seeing those vendor invoices reflected on the asset now

Speaker 4  04:42
and then we have. We tested that Tuesday, after Josh did an update Monday night. And the other thing, Oh, the other thing we saw was, was Accounts Payable said, Hey, I can't continue with this. We. On invoice because it it forced them, it stopped them because they didn't know what asset to link it to. It was an invoice. So that's good. Thanks for that. And then this, just this morning, we walk through the steps of actually creating a sale of asset. And all of that seemed to we didn't actually save it because we still need to do a little bit of we're not done with the asset yet. We need to link some other to that yet. But so what's the is the the the one slide glitch is that anything we need to be concerned about or not. If we do, we're hoping you do to make a sale of asset, probably this week yet,

Speaker 2  05:46
the glitches list, having too many assets in the or showing too many of the assets in the drop list, we want to filter it down so you don't have just a massive list. Oh, but that's all so you can it should still be usable.

Unknown Speaker  06:03
We wanted the list to only show assets that are not yet in service.

Speaker 2  06:09
That's what I was working on doing. Okay, so it doesn't do that quite yet, but that's the one thing, and I can fix that in a few minutes. Now that Matthias revealed my ignorance.

Speaker 4  06:23
So Drew there was something else that you had requested or suggested on selecting the assets like showing, I don't know. Is it worth talking about that now or not?

Unknown Speaker  06:35
Oh, just a drop down list instead of, instead of opening up that other it's

Unknown Speaker  06:42
a drop down list. Now, yeah, that's the update.

Unknown Speaker  06:44
Good, yeah.

Speaker 4  06:48
And does it show? Okay? I thought there was also something about it, just showing the name, the actual name of the asset, and not the not the code, not the code name.

Unknown Speaker  06:58
Yeah,

Speaker 4  06:59
I guess, okay, for what we're managing that just, I think, just the the name,

Speaker 5  07:08
do you have it with the code name, the ID number at the end, or something like that? Now,

Unknown Speaker  07:15
maybe I have to go look, actually

Speaker 5  07:18
think that it feels like the name and the ID number,

Speaker 4  07:22
the name first, ID number, last. That would be great, because we're going to have situations where we're going to have similar items, like a shed trailer, and then that's

Speaker 2  08:12
I just track it down to see, yeah, right now it's The name and then the ID at the end,

Unknown Speaker  08:23
perfect. Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  08:31
I think that's all that we have on Seth, is there? I mean, that's what you've been working on. There's

Speaker 2  08:36
not really any other I mean, I worked on accounts receivable stuff with Mark just finding discrepancies and faster. I think we're up to date on that. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  08:50
think so.

Matthias Miller  08:55
Yeah, Mark, you just want to dive into the

Unknown Speaker  09:00
Sure absolutely. And

Speaker 4  09:02
do we have Audra coming on at 1030 to kind of do a project handout, or, let's face, okay, good. That's, that's

Matthias Miller  09:10
the plan. We can, we can bump, I think she's got some flexibility to, well, just trying to drop off it.

Speaker 3  09:19
Yeah, anyway, yeah, that's the plan. Oh, I just remembered

Speaker 2  09:22
one other thing. Did you all see the transactions reports should be substantially faster now in zfb,

Unknown Speaker  09:36
something was substantially faster.

Speaker 2  09:38
Yeah, transaction reports should display rows about 50 times faster than they were, so I hope that helps a little bit. Well,

Speaker 5  09:46
yeah, yeah, I forget what I was doing. Like Well, my internet must be good this morning,

Speaker 2  09:54
it should regularly be like that. Now for that report, I'm as I have time. I'm more. Working on, trying to speed up reports that one most of them, are not going to be that dramatic, but yeah,

Speaker 4  10:04
is that the general ledger report? Like, if you go open a general ledger, no,

Speaker 2  10:09
it's accounting transactions. So any you're searching transactions or something, it's basically there are other reports I want to be working on, but I was looking at what reports I use the most and how long it takes them. And it looks like that one was about the worst. So,

Speaker 4  10:28
yep, you're seeing then what reports, okay, because it's depending what Drew is doing. It slows all of this is down like they're calling Twain and saying, hey, you know that so you're seeing, you don't necessarily need a list from Drew, no,

Unknown Speaker  10:46
I don't think so I can figure out what's slow, usually, good.

Speaker 4  10:53
Okay, well, then let's just jump right into the agenda. I think we should be able to get through this by 1030 but so duplication warning not working correctly. Do you have an example of this or, well, go ahead,

Speaker 5  11:06
yeah, I sent you got an email shows up in the vendor invoice. I mean, it shows up in the reconcile page, and it wants to say that a check is a duplication of some of the invoices that it paid.

Speaker 1  11:31
I'm seeing that I think it was earlier. Ah,

Speaker 5  11:47
I have not found any rhyme or reason to why it selects certain ones

Unknown Speaker  11:54
or any

Unknown Speaker  11:56
like and it doesn't even say, Well, this total matches.

Unknown Speaker  12:01
So record type and IDs on the check, if Not.

Unknown Speaker  12:09
Oh,

Matthias Miller  12:24
it's when you have a

Unknown Speaker  12:40
Oh, man,

Matthias Miller  12:44
so for some reason we are

Speaker 3  12:52
duplicate invoice internal type and ID, Which means source record.

Matthias Miller  13:19
Okay, so the duplicate warning

Matthias Miller  13:28
is not handling it when the check has multiple vendor invoices associated with it.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
Let me pull this up for use death in particular.

Matthias Miller  13:47
I think so here's the macro,

Speaker 3  13:54
and let me just maybe send an email for notes. Account. Duplicate invoice descriptors, then

Unknown Speaker  14:11
existing records, if it's if

Unknown Speaker  14:28
this vendor, invoice, ID,

Unknown Speaker  14:38
existing records. I think what needs to happen. I.

Speaker 3  15:00
Is, if it's a vendor invoice, then we find the check if

Unknown Speaker  15:32
I don't know how we Want to handle this. What's the priority on it? Um,

Speaker 5  15:44
depends, depends how long it takes. I mean, if it's something that's going to we got other things that are a bigger concern, you know. So if this is a 30 minute project, then let's just do it and get it. Get it done. Out of the way, if it's a several hour project, let's put some of our other concerns first

Unknown Speaker  16:03
vendor invoice,

Unknown Speaker  16:14
the

Speaker 5  16:16
the functionality of getting a Warning when they actually duplicate an invoice at the at the vendor, invoice creation point. That all seems to be functioning, correct. So, I mean, the only issue we're having is they blow past the warning and do it anyway. But so that's not programming issue.

Matthias Miller  16:46
Okay, Seth. I'll see if I can explain it. So we, we have, we go find everything that could be tied to a jubilee invoice, which includes an accounting transaction, vendor invoice or a check. Currently we're just doing it based on level and ID, and I think what we need to do is do it based on level ID and amount, because some of these are broken down into multiple line items. So throw in be this amount here. Um, if it's an accounting transaction, then we should probably do a concat RG

Unknown Speaker  17:31
using

Matthias Miller  17:34
replacing a debit amount and credit amount as the amount for the check. We would do a concat RG on this. And

Unknown Speaker  17:46
I think we would

Matthias Miller  17:50
well, and then vendor invoice, we look at the associated check

Speaker 3  17:56
and do a concat RG on the dnm ID, um, and then

Matthias Miller  18:08
this needs to be a tablet item.

Unknown Speaker  18:21
And

Speaker 3  18:32
I'm not quite sure what else needs to actually change descriptors for this invoice me This amount. I out, actually, maybe it's a

Unknown Speaker  18:52
transaction. I

Matthias Miller  19:00
I wonder if actually what we should be doing.

Unknown Speaker  19:19
I don't know.

Matthias Miller  19:22
I think it's, it's more than a 30 minute change. It's a little tricky.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
Or do you want to move it down?

Speaker 4  19:31
Well, right now, you're the only one affected by it, right? Right?

Unknown Speaker  19:36
Well,

Speaker 4  19:39
I'd say, let's look at the size on the others and then determine the order. Okay. I mean, are you? Are you thinking this is more like a half a day? Change?

Matthias Miller  19:47
It's probably more like half a day okay?

Speaker 4  19:51
And let's look at the next one. Again. There was a vendor invoice that you. Uh, it's not paid, but yet it showed up on the bank reconcile.

Speaker 5  20:17
It comes from one our one of our recurring templates. I don't know if that makes a difference or not. None of the others do this, but

Speaker 3  20:26
for July, be this guy right here. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  20:31
this one you said

Unknown Speaker  20:36
was reconciled?

Matthias Miller  20:39
No, it showed up on the reconcile, right? It was unpaid, unverified

Unknown Speaker  20:48
payment date.

Matthias Miller  20:58
So we have, I

Unknown Speaker  21:03
so why is it pushing into checking? Let's go find out.

Unknown Speaker  21:18
Yo, non Po, do, of

Unknown Speaker  21:27
the payment string table, if it's

Matthias Miller  21:35
because you have a payment we don't look at the status you have a payment date and a payment amount,

Speaker 3  21:47
well or the payment amount, we go ahead. I

Unknown Speaker  22:05
AP, yeah, that's that one.

Matthias Miller  22:14
Would you? Yeah, and then we use the invoice total. If you don't have a payment amount. I

Unknown Speaker  22:24
I think this should actually,

Unknown Speaker  22:32
there's no check associated with it.

Matthias Miller  22:35
I mean, we could, I don't know. Well, we can find out what's what's affected. Let's find out. So we have vendor invoices

Unknown Speaker  22:51
where

Speaker 3  22:58
and the invoice status does not equal paid, and the invoice status does Not equal prepaid.

Unknown Speaker  23:17
And let's do the invoice date. Some of these might be old ones.

Unknown Speaker  23:31
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  23:34
okay, so So the sorry, reverse sort.

Matthias Miller  23:39
I mean, all your recent ones already would have gotten pushed over to accounting. If we go back like, here's Alpha Building Center

Speaker 2  23:50
that got pushed to accounting doesn't have a status. That's weird. Why does it? No, it's not, doesn't have a payment date, so it wouldn't be pushed through. Isn't your report getting the ones that

Matthias Miller  24:05
this is what we got. Okay? So here's most of them are pretty recent. The M 21 that you found is an issue. The merchants check Center is an issue.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
No stats.

Matthias Miller  24:22
Which? Which this one's actually reconciled. So the main thing would be to mark the ones that have been reconciled here

Unknown Speaker  24:34
the invoice status. I

Unknown Speaker  24:43
um, and let's make this one. Here's what I'm going to do.

Unknown Speaker  24:55
20 2408 22

Matthias Miller  24:58
the invoices. Is unpaid. The unpaid vis in accounting,

Unknown Speaker  25:08
so

Matthias Miller  25:11
drew your job is going to be, I'm going to send this over to you. Your job is to go through and any of these that have actually hit the bank to go update the vendor invoice status to paid so that they stay around

Unknown Speaker  25:26
and then

Matthias Miller  25:28
Seth, we should

Unknown Speaker  25:35
paid. I

Unknown Speaker  25:44
Let's see the invoice. What was you

Unknown Speaker  25:49
wanted? The payment dater,

Unknown Speaker  25:50
no,

Speaker 3  25:53
this macro here. So I'm just going to shoot you an email, because

Unknown Speaker  26:09
so we're changing this to where it's not paid, that we don't Push it. It's not pushing unpaid

Matthias Miller  26:22
the eyes to it. Accounting, all right, so Drew. Main thing is, fix that before the next update, then your reconciliations are going to be off. Good,

Speaker 5  26:35
okay. Did you send me a link to that? Or do I have to still find it?

Matthias Miller  26:39
No, I sent you a link

Speaker 4  26:48
that takes care of the ones on this list. And then moving forward, you're doing, you're making a slight change to catch right?

Matthias Miller  27:00
Yeah, if you don't mark, if the vendor invoice is not mark paid, it's not going to get pushed to accounting. Which or the payment isn't going to get pushed to accounting, right? Which is what should happen anyway,

Speaker 4  27:17
is that A is for size. How big of a how much time is that? 15 minutes,

Unknown Speaker  27:22
okay, five

Matthias Miller  27:26
minutes with coffee.

Unknown Speaker  27:29
I've got coffee, so 10

Unknown Speaker  27:31
minutes to go get coffee.

Matthias Miller  27:34
Yeah, five minutes to get coffee, five minutes to code and five minutes to I don't know what

Unknown Speaker  27:41
do. What comes next.

Speaker 4  27:46
So the next one should read, VI, GL, edit, breaking, reconciles. So we wanted to review prior to this project. This was a project code that you had on this Matthias and said that we also need to prioritize where we want this

Unknown Speaker  28:04
single event type for po payments.

Unknown Speaker  28:12
Can you enlarge your screen? We can't see it. Oh, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:15
Here, let me also. Let

Speaker 3  28:19
me do that, and also let me stop sharing the other one. Just focus on this one.

Matthias Miller  28:30
So my proposal is that, okay, Seth, we've got two on the accounting transaction, we've got two types of events, be V, invoice po payment and VO, be invoice non po payment, if A two different types based on,

Unknown Speaker  28:59
sorry,

Matthias Miller  29:02
depending on the invoice, there's a different type of accounting transaction that gets, yeah, created, and we want to use the same one. Yeah, sure. So my proposal is renamed the PO to obsolete. That way existing transactions can continue to persist.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
Change. Wait,

Unknown Speaker  29:24
no.

Matthias Miller  29:29
Migration gets tricky, ideally right after the update. Well, ideally, what would happen? Why can't we just change both the invoice, rename them both to be invoice payment? Do?

Unknown Speaker  30:00
I don't know what would go sideways with that.

Unknown Speaker  30:12
I don't know. Seems like it probably worked. I thought

Unknown Speaker  30:18
there was a reason. I didn't want to do it, but probably,

Unknown Speaker  30:36
how do we test to make sure this stuff doesn't I?

Matthias Miller  30:45
Okay, here's another idea.

Matthias Miller  30:53
This might be the most conservative approach. I

Matthias Miller  31:51
that's, that is the that is the most conservative thing I can think of.

Matthias Miller  32:19
And I don't really care which approach you take is, as long as it's

Speaker 2  32:25
going to be a big, massive, if it goes sideways, yeah, that's I was gonna say, I kind of like not having that.

Matthias Miller  32:32
So I kind of like the first, okay, if you're happy with that, I'm happy with, yeah, that's that I'm pretty comfortable with. And then, um,

Speaker 5  32:48
um testing changes to the warnings that we'd like to go with this

Matthias Miller  32:56
great one second, copying update to the test system, export balance sheet and income statement from ABC st, NBS Run,

Unknown Speaker  33:12
no, ah,

Matthias Miller  33:17
your accounting impact is going to I

Unknown Speaker  33:38
yeah, I

Matthias Miller  33:46
I think I should be good enough for testing, but I think it's a reasonable measure to make sure that, yeah, there's no surprises. The warning that goes with this, then it eliminates the warning about making changes and reconcile breaking as a

Unknown Speaker  34:10
on when they make changes to what

Matthias Miller  34:15
this will eliminate the warning when taking a vendor invoice that has no po or non po items, and adding a and this is where I'm not quite sure what it is via account impact. It's

Matthias Miller  34:38
where's the I forget which direction it is. There's the payment table. So if it has a PO, then it's Po, otherwise it's not Po. So,

Matthias Miller  34:59
so if you. Have a blank, if you have a blank vendor invoice, something shows up. AP doesn't know how to process it. They don't select anything. They just put in the total. You come in, you're like, Oh, this is this PO check. Currently you can't do that, because it says, Oh, you're going to break reconciliation. And now it's going to say, yes, you can do it, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:22
okay. Now,

Speaker 5  35:25
can you make so that if they change the payment date, it will still not show them, it'll just it'll let them change the payment date, but then, but the payment amount, or the payment account, or actually be the payment method, because accounts just driven off payment method. But those that will not let them save they just can't do it.

Matthias Miller  35:55
No, because no, not easily.

Unknown Speaker  36:01
Well, hang on.

Speaker 5  36:03
The reason I say that when you go to hook up a PO, if it was received, you know, let's say the original invoice was dated as the 15th. The po was received on the 20th. They can't connect that po to that thing without changing the receipt date, then they can't do that without changing the payment date. So to later go on, we need to be able to change payment dates.

Unknown Speaker  36:42
How often does this happen?

Speaker 5  36:45
Probably increasingly more, the closer we get caught up to

Unknown Speaker  36:48
current.

Speaker 5  36:52
I mean, it's in the scale of things, maybe what one or 2% of

Matthias Miller  36:59
I mean, is it once a week, once a month, once a day?

Speaker 5  37:06
Well, probably every month, there will be multiple because every time we reconcile, we are creating more of these that we don't know where to go. And then there's going to be a fallout of stuff after that that's going to

Matthias Miller  37:25
need help too. So, but before you reconcile, you won't find them before you reconcile,

Speaker 5  37:33
in the reconcile process. So we're going through, hey, here's stuff that was in the bank, here's payments that were made. We don't have this so we create them, and then we reconcile. So

Matthias Miller  37:43
you'll get, oh, okay, oh, you'll find the missing ones, right? And then create them, and then you may want to link them to POS retroactively, yeah. And the issue is that the that the bank statement may show a date prior to when the PO was actually received,

Speaker 5  38:06
right? So that's what I enter and reconcile on.

Matthias Miller  38:14
So just out of curiosity, what's the real life scenario in which I mean, are these prepayments

Speaker 5  38:23
Yes. Now we had one just this past month where I guess it would have been a prepayment that was

Speaker 4  38:31
right. Typically, I would expect credit card, like some companies, at time of more replacement, and then the product shows up later, two days later, whatever.

Matthias Miller  38:45
Wouldn't it make more sense to do something like if you have a a vendor invoice that's prepaid, you can link it to POs that are after with the reception, reception date after vendor invoice.

Speaker 5  39:00
Well, I've been wanting that for months, and Mark keeps dragging his feet well.

Speaker 4  39:07
So the theory behind, behind having an invoice date prior to product received date is, is you don't become liable to pay for product, and until you right, receive the product. So I'm kind of that's why I'm scared about changing that. Because, I mean, if we could lock it down to these, okay, could, could we lock it down to only these invoices that you create, not really like

Speaker 5  39:50
there'd be a way of tracking that quick vendor invoice creation.

Speaker 4  39:57
I mean, you're creating all of them through that, right? Uh, like, those are the, those are the, I think those are the only ones where we would need, or this would apply, or would it,

Unknown Speaker  40:13
yeah, there would apply.

Speaker 5  40:17
I mean, if we get them started at any point of kind of reviewing, you know that could be an issue short

Matthias Miller  40:27
circuit all this conversation. I think the answer is

Unknown Speaker  40:36
yes. So

Matthias Miller  40:39
Seth, here is your

Unknown Speaker  40:53
Oh, how do we Do this? Though,

Matthias Miller  40:56
validate new accounting impact

Unknown Speaker  40:59
impact effects you

Unknown Speaker  41:35
the invoice validate new accounting impact. Okay, so the number the ID,

Matthias Miller  41:45
the I can impact does the does,

Unknown Speaker  41:52
no, not always, um,

Matthias Miller  42:00
We are this close. It's crafty, but it's close. You

Unknown Speaker  42:29
You know, here's how we do it.

Unknown Speaker  42:35
I don't like it. I

Matthias Miller  42:45
Okay, set the X 30 only updates the RG if, if, if the RG row items change so you could change the accounting, the transaction date and everything would be fine.

Unknown Speaker  43:02
Okay?

Matthias Miller  43:04
Does that make sense or not? Really? When, okay, when you say, vendor invoice, what's your accounting impact? We go build a long list, and we say, push it over to accounting. When we push it over to accounting, we match up the transaction records, and we always stomp on. Is it voided or posted? What's the Transaction Date, what's the what's the reference number, whatever we stomp on, the main non RG fields in the transaction. The RG we only update if the RG itself changes, to preserve in order to preserve those items. So if we can loosen up the account impact changes affect reconcile transactions to ignore date changes.

Unknown Speaker  43:52
Then

Speaker 3  43:56
the transaction ID is the event type i

Matthias Miller  44:04
i think what you can do is just blank out.

Matthias Miller  44:19
This is one part of that. No, we do plank out the date so you're seeing it keeps you from this. It

Unknown Speaker  44:28
would definitely

Unknown Speaker  44:30
help the situation.

Speaker 2  44:33
Existing accountant, existing, because this validation is quite new with us, right? Like I yeah, this is just with the last update. I think I'm not sure you're

Matthias Miller  44:47
not sure that's what they're is

Speaker 2  44:49
this something you've had for a while? The problem you're talking about Sure,

Matthias Miller  44:58
we didn't used. Validate against this. Okay, so changing the date would just quietly, well, it would actually quietly work. I think

Speaker 4  45:13
you're saying what, the way it looks now, changing that date should be possible.

Matthias Miller  45:19
Here's what, here's what, I think

Speaker 3  45:26
like updates in the accounting impact for comparison purposes.

Matthias Miller  45:33
Then test to make sure, here's what drew. Could you give a test? I find a reconciled transaction, change the date, ignore the warning, make sure it stays reconciled. I think, I think it would be easier if you would do that than if Seth would and then Seth, what we would do is write code to blank out the dates in the vendor invoice before comparison, or, sorry, in the accounting impact before comparison.

Unknown Speaker  46:15
That would be relatively simple,

Speaker 3  46:18
and then obviously, please add comments while we're doing that. Yeah, it seems fair.

Matthias Miller  46:25
So this is disable, reconcile, reconcile warning

Unknown Speaker  46:31
when changing, when changing dates.

Unknown Speaker  46:37
All right, I think we're good. I

Matthias Miller  46:41
said that over to you Seth and drew as soon as you got that, you could let Steph know and you can go check it. Yeah,

Speaker 4  47:07
so on updates to vendor invoices needing payment. Drew has some details on this, but I

Unknown Speaker  47:23
Are you still testing that? No, oh, let me, I

Speaker 5  47:44
um, the main thing with the email is, like we had the functionality with the ACH payment type where it would automatically send a email. Um, did Josh do it? Or,

Speaker 4  48:01
I think Josh did that using ij gateway, like you initiated a payment in it, email the pay stub.

Speaker 5  48:11
Um, so I'd like to have that all happen with with the E payment type, if it comes if it was generate, like if the payment was generated by or not, the payment does the rec recording the payment was generated from the vendor invoices needing payment page. So if I'm using that page to pay them, create this email. If you just have it open and you say, Oh, this was paid by E payment, because you just transferred some money or whatever, you know, and you select that this one is paid and from the vendor invoice itself. Don't trigger that email, but if it comes, you know, as a normal paying function from that vendor invoice needing payment page, then that would trigger the email.

Matthias Miller  49:13
How many of these do you do on your regular payment cycle? How

Speaker 3  49:17
often do you pay these and how many do you do?

Speaker 5  49:21
I mean, there's, there's several companies that I will send emails to that it happens just about every week, like and for every week I'm sending emails, but I'm not to each company every week, but so it's, it's somewhat the time saving is also just for accuracy, you know, because sometimes, if it's 10 invoices till I get the amounts and the invoice numbers and everything all correct, and you know, if, if there was a credit involved, and just getting all those details in accurately is is almost more of a. Turning them the then the actual time saved. But

Matthias Miller  50:04
are these tied to a check? Are they tied to are they just recorded individually?

Speaker 5  50:10
It's just like, if you would select the E payment, which there's not going to be anything there, but so like E payment, ABC or SD, one of those, then when you hit the paid manually button,

Matthias Miller  50:30
but you might have multiple make paying be paying multiple vendor invoices at the same time,

Speaker 5  50:37
yes, but only one vendor at at a time, because it creates a payment record for those items, you know. So if there were three invoices totaling $3,000 to the vendor, it will create a $3,000 payment that hits the bank account in the books, in

Matthias Miller  51:08
the books, it will because we merge the 3 million voices together. But apart from that, there's nothing that ties them really together. Would you be I know this is janky, but would you be opposed to generating a check and then note notating that as an E payment, and

Unknown Speaker  51:29
then that gives you the total. That would be fine.

Matthias Miller  51:33
And then, and then having something on the check to email the vendor with this style of has issued, and it just might just say payment issued from has issued a payment to you on date, and the amount of

Unknown Speaker  51:53
we don't post date, it

Speaker 5  51:55
would Pretty much just create a a PDF payment stub?

Unknown Speaker  52:05
Well, we could,

Matthias Miller  52:09
we could do that. We could,

Speaker 5  52:12
like, if it had a way of creating a check, then instead of leaving a blank number for it to be printed, it would just put E in the in the check number space, and we would write on and that would be the PDF. I could then go to the checks, grab that PDF, and email it to him if I need to.

Matthias Miller  52:34
Well, it's going to have the signature on it. Is that going to

Unknown Speaker  52:40
matter? I don't know, does it look too weird?

Speaker 4  52:45
Be the same signature? I mean, we could that would be, I think that could be okay. So it would look, so how would it look as far as well, okay, you would be needing to manually send those. Then I

Speaker 5  53:06
still need to manually go get that PDF and send it.

Matthias Miller  53:11
We could give you a button to I guess what I'm trying to get away from. I think that would still greatly simplify our coding. It puts all the tools in the same place, puts all the information in the same place. And what was that? The same place, and what was actually paid, which is what we do under the hood for Ach, but, but for manual payments, we don't really have a Okay, so let's, let's just build something out here. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  53:47
no, it's not so do

Matthias Miller  53:57
sorry, we're we really are. Weird, perfect. I like it. You get a bonus one for you, one for you. The number would be E, Ah, okay, so we need a loose validation to allow number. Let's just do for now, I think we actually let you do this. Let's see negative 1d

Matthias Miller  54:37
print. Check,

Speaker 4  54:42
guys, I know we're I'm sounding like a broken record. But should we, should we push the projects think off until next week and continue on this list? Or

Matthias Miller  54:56
well, what if we did a. Could we just keep it super, super simple on the projects list? Is there anything that you need besides just the master list from Audra on projects?

Speaker 4  55:12
I don't think so. No, she, I mean, she did send me those files, so I have those. So I say we're good,

Matthias Miller  55:19
okay, if, you're good with that, we can just say this is in your court to manage.

Matthias Miller  55:38
Let me just ping her. I A,

Matthias Miller  55:49
okay, so

Unknown Speaker  56:02
And okay,

Matthias Miller  56:07
now, okay, so this is what it would look like. And if you would have vendor invoices, and those all be, I mean, these would be vendor invoices, so they all be listed individually, and we could then have a button called email, assist check, memo, known, assist, Check, What? What?

Unknown Speaker  56:34
What was it? Complete. Liking this we,

Matthias Miller  56:53
I think how terrible it would be. I don't even know that I want to okay, if, if this is easy, that I would just is,

Speaker 5  57:07
would they be able to take this PDF and go print themselves a nice check? No, because they wouldn't have the right to check number.

Matthias Miller  57:15
Check number. I mean, the one thing we could do, I we could also just give you a PDF with only the stub, only their stub, which is what's the difference between these two? Include the account. You give them the one, because this has the account in it. Create an expert with just this as a PDF.

Speaker 4  57:46
Okay, well, if we, if we look ahead at doing not to file uploads to the banks, which we will imagine like then we want to use this as well like are we? Part of me says, let's, let's take a little bit more time and build this to work exactly like we wanted to. In preparation for that, I

Speaker 4  58:23
I'm not sure how that would even I mean rather than guess, we haven't even thought, or I haven't thought through how that exactly would work. From a payment site like you probably select five of these to do e payments, and you export the file, and that the exporting the file is what stomps in your payment date and issues these pay stubs probably

Unknown Speaker  58:50
just one second. Mark Audrey, do

Unknown Speaker  58:55
you see the issue? If

Matthias Miller  58:56
mark is happy with the files, he's got, sorry, this is kind of a last bit change. If he's happy with the file. The files that he's got, is there anything you think we need to cover on the project management

Speaker 6  59:08
handoff? No, I don't think so. I think I probably need to make sure that in the interim, there are more tasks that have been added. So I should probably send you some updated files. Mark, but if you're happy with that that then that's fine.

Speaker 4  59:22
Uh, yeah, send me the updated files, and then if I have questions, I'll, I'll reach out to you. But yeah, I'd say that, yeah,

Speaker 6  59:30
that works for me. The simplest handoff discussion ever.

Speaker 4  59:37
It's innovative, actually, by by time constraints on this site to work on a few some other things here. So that's fair. Well, yeah, I'm available if you need me, but I'll get all that stuff updated. Get

Unknown Speaker  59:50
you updated files, and we'll call it good. So, yeah, take care. Yep, um,

Matthias Miller  59:58
and uh. Uh, Joel has no project management updates either, so he's also not joining which we need to revamp. So it's time to revamp some of these scheduling schedules. Anyway, um, I'm

Speaker 2  1:00:10
gonna have to drop in about 15 minutes then. So okay, I think normally I can stay longer, but I had stuff planned already before I got the invites for these calls. So fair enough

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
so the so we could still do a simple email button that attaches the check stub with the subject line of, you know, you've been paid. Please see the attached PDF, and we just show them this. And it's pretty inexpensive. Drew you generate the check. You click the button, it previews the email, and you hit send, prior to NACHA. And then once we get to notch everything, we nail down more automation.

Speaker 4  1:00:55
What you sounds good to me. The PDF you'd be creating would be just the stove portion and you and not doing the signature and stuff,

Matthias Miller  1:01:05
sure, we could do just the sub portion. That's right. That would be terrible with that. I

Speaker 4  1:01:10
mean, it on what you were matching. Were you trying to match what we had in ij gateway, or not? I mean, well, okay, I guess, I mean,

Speaker 5  1:01:22
you could use the same terminology. You have the terminology there for the email,

Speaker 4  1:01:29
oh, that we were using for ij gateway, yeah, he's got it done. So I think one of the things is, is there? So, so this is dated. It out like, from the date the payment was issued. It said seven days, I think, or something, this would now be shorter, like, yeah, like two days, I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:49
would say, within the next two days.

Matthias Miller  1:01:53
Worried, two business days.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
Check template stub, be data.

Matthias Miller  1:02:03
Okay, let's I'm going to roughly spec this out for you, Seth,

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
extract the the data part of into a macro. So basically, the I would probably just,

Speaker 3  1:02:37
just do all of this stuff, and then I'm sure we're creating a check. We're just giving the number.

Speaker 3  1:02:54
This is check. This is literally a number.

Matthias Miller  1:03:02
I'm not sure what to do about the assist check number, though you're currently expecting it to be a literal number with blank meaning

Unknown Speaker  1:03:14
unpaid.

Matthias Miller  1:03:20
I think we're fine with using negative one or zero or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
So check zero is it. Could you do

Speaker 5  1:03:40
the payment like I was thinking about, if we have all these ease and we start creating a ton of them, do we want to add, like the date to it, or something that's going to start Looking like a like a regular check number? If you know, if it's a six digit date, it's going to look like a check number, which

Matthias Miller  1:04:06
means we're going to start counting from there, right?

Speaker 4  1:04:16
So where's this number used? Is it used just internally, like or would you use these numbers

Speaker 5  1:04:22
in the list of checks and would put them in there? But I'd kind of hate to get these mixed in with paper checks, like, there needs to be some sort of differentiation for if you sort them, or

Speaker 4  1:04:34
what needs to be distinctive, some so what if we do negative numbers on all of those? Is that that's what you're proposing or suggesting. Matthias,

Matthias Miller  1:04:44
maybe it'd be an option. Yeah. We could also using on

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
It's janky. It's not perfect.

Speaker 5  1:05:02
What if you do just something like, like 00, and then a six digit date or something, you know, it'd be a it would be a longer number that you know isn't going to be on our checks at all, because we, because we

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
leading zeros, and it's still going to be greater than all of your existing check numbers,

Speaker 3  1:05:25
and we're going to want to count, try to count from there.

Matthias Miller  1:05:30
I mean, I think we're down to if we're going to treat these as checks, then we need to have a way to say that this is an E check or an E payment. And we need to anywhere we're searching by check number, we need to filter, is it e payment or not, and then what's the number?

Speaker 2  1:05:52
What's the logic behind checks? Is it fairly complicated to fill them out and stuff like, I'm one, my instinct is I don't like stomping stuff onto other stuff onto checks. I'd rather create another record, but I don't know what all goes on behind the scenes with checks. So Well, okay, here's

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
an alternative.

Speaker 3  1:06:18
Wait, maybe I'm just way over complicating

Matthias Miller  1:06:23
it. The rationale for using checks is that it seems like 80% of the functionality is already there we're looking for, and it unifies everything and ties it to a record. Yes, the alternative would be from the payments. I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:43
if we would,

Matthias Miller  1:06:53
well, it's if you would have an easy way from here to Okay. The right pain is showing checks, right?

Speaker 5  1:07:06
Yeah, it does when you have, when you when you have something in the left pane, if they're unprinted, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
couldn't you? I

Matthias Miller  1:07:25
i show items. You can have a bottom right pane that shows items that were paid today, that matches the district and payment type as needed.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
And

Unknown Speaker  1:07:52
what would people the right pain,

Speaker 5  1:07:56
sorts by payment type, no by payment account. So if I accidentally select a credit card payment type item and hit pay by check, it will try to create, it will will actually create a check, and then it will go to the credit card account. So it creates a mass but, but it does actually show up over there.

Matthias Miller  1:08:27
Okay, let, let's create a simple report that shows a list of that allows you to filter based on payment date, because the payment date is going to be today, payment type, and it shows you a list of all the vendors that you paid and and gives you an option to pop open an email that you can then send. It's basically a view paid vendors. View vendors paid today, where you could filter the district and the payment type and the date we default today. It would show a list of the vendors who were paid you could pop into and send email that looks like the ACH payment. That would show everything that was paid today. We would also show you would and then, based on the payment date to the to business days, I What

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
do you think of that?

Speaker 5  1:09:28
Does this still create a single record like a check would

Matthias Miller  1:09:34
in the accounting transaction? It will still it'll still get pushed accounting the same way. We'll still merge in based on whatever logic we have now. And I don't remember how it's working, but if it's working now, that wouldn't change. The only thing would be giving you a way to see the see the vendors that you want to that you paid today, and be able to generate the email for any, any one of them.

Speaker 5  1:09:55
Okay, I was just looking at my notes and the E payment method. Does not merge multiple invoices for the same vendor together into one payment record. So okay, like a check would, so if we did the check thing that would, that would solve that problem as well.

Matthias Miller  1:10:18
Or if we would have an E payment record like Seth is proposing. I think the bottom line is, Mark, you're right, Christina, I'm going to start deferring to you on software design. I think we wanted to figure out what we want to do for NACHA, and I think a whether it's an E payment record or something like that. If this is tied into that, I think it would make more sense of, what do we how do we want to structure the data for NACHA? And, I mean, isn't an E payment? Technically, under the hood is an E payment, an ACH payment. That's none that you manually upload

Speaker 5  1:10:58
most of the time. Yes, there's going to be the rare occasions where we're just, maybe it's just an account transfer from in the inside the bank, you know, moving from one account to the next. There's possibilities that it's, it's a payment that we don't generate. It might be on auto payment somewhere, and they're doing an ACH poll from from their side. That's pretty much the only other

Matthias Miller  1:11:31
only other options. Could we do this with a little bit of terminology? Change, change the ACH payment to a Okay? Am I right that the E payment as a term could encompass both current ACH payments and the transfer and ACH poles and everything that you're doing?

Speaker 5  1:11:49
Yeah, it could. The reason for separation is because ACH had a specific send and ACH function, whereas e payment is same thing, but it doesn't have a function like that. So,

Matthias Miller  1:12:02
so what if we would rename the ACH record to an E payment record? I think Josh would need to be involved in it, and then there's a checkbox on the ACH or checkbox or drop list of how do you intend to pay it? Well, it's basically a pay this automatically. Checkbox, and when you issued Ach, it does it automatically. If you don't, it's like, it's like a check that's waiting to be executed in some way.

Speaker 4  1:12:35
Won't we go to that is, are we doing any ACH payments using Dijk gateway anymore, um, shed time. Also, we still have to keep that around,

Speaker 5  1:12:47
unless we can get them to go to a bank. That's

Speaker 5  1:12:57
but that's only for that one vendor that won't take checks too, so

Speaker 4  1:13:03
well and have we exhausted with their bank, the options with their bank that they can

Speaker 5  1:13:09
not in a conversation about it? No,

Matthias Miller  1:13:20
I think it probably involved a conversation with Josh. First of all, if we eliminate I check gateway, well, then this whole conversation becomes quite simple. We just yank the automation

Unknown Speaker  1:13:37
and so um,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
yeah, Seth,

Matthias Miller  1:13:44
we might need to connect later today or something. Then me to drop, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
I'm gonna have to drop about now. So,

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
okay, thank you. Yep, see ya. Bye, bye.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:57
I would, I don't know.

Speaker 5  1:14:02
Okay, can from I check gateway, can we go to their platform and issue an ACH payment like log into I check gateway.com, open up our account for shed time, send someone an ACH.

Matthias Miller  1:14:24
I don't know I would

Speaker 5  1:14:26
do that. It is, it is very it's rare. I mean, it's a rare situation that we, that we did this.

Matthias Miller  1:14:43
Uh, mark is, does Dwayne know lead in? Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:14:47
I mean, I think, I think maybe the other route would be to talk with the bank. See, see, like we have an act. They had a conversation with the bank, like, we just know their online portal?

Speaker 5  1:15:03
Yeah, I'm just by going through their online account website, that would

Speaker 4  1:15:07
be the ideal, because it would be cheaper than I checked gateway if we don't, if we could. So it seems like that would be next step. And then if we can get rid of I check gateway completely. Could we use any of the functionality that Josh built for initiating ACH payments and reuse that for, okay, at that point we would have nothing but E payments, or we could call them all the same, right, as

Speaker 5  1:15:40
long as, as long as we have the functionality to either create a notch file with this included, or else no notch like, I want nothing to happen behind the scenes. I just want it recorded,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
right? Oh,

Speaker 4  1:15:59
yeah, could we recycle or reuse some of Josh's work on the ACH for that or not?

Matthias Miller  1:16:08
I would think most of the these records here everything, but the status might change. We might have a different status the log. Obviously, that's not happening, but everything else on the record itself, we could keep the tie outs that make these things show up correctly in accounting, impact all this stuff, I think that can stay and then, yes, whenever we get to NACHA, NACHA exports, we can pull information from from here to generate the NACHA file. I uh,

Speaker 5  1:16:45
so that would kind of be a second function. You'd go through, you'd you'd make your payments for the day, all that kind of stuff. And then you'd say, okay, create an option file for me, and you'd select, like, a two step process, or,

Matthias Miller  1:17:01
yeah, it would. So what I would envision is in the vendor invoices needing payment, you would have a bottom right pane with unprocessed e payments, and then a button on the top right to generate notch file that you download, and then something to mark, basically mark the E payments as being executed. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:17:22
but we can do this. We could do this in steps like the notch. Probably the most time consuming thing is going to be the notch file I export, getting that set up correctly with each bank and setting the bank up correctly. Which is going to be on your side, I would assume drew or largely,

Speaker 5  1:17:39
I mean, Notch file is a standard, standard format file, so it's matter of finding out what that file details are.

Matthias Miller  1:17:50
But that's, and it's it's a matter of Seth, figuring out how to generate the notch file. And I don't know,

Speaker 4  1:18:00
but in the interim, we could okay if we, if we yank the IJ gateway and we revise some of that functionality to say, sent the the remittance, emails and stuff, we could run like that for a while without the notch of files, and you would just manually be doing your bank right. So is next, is next step, figure out what to do to get around the IJ gateway city, wage in Indiana, and then regroup with with you. You Josh and Seth, or what is the what is next step?

Matthias Miller  1:18:46
Yeah, figure out, make sure that you have a workaround. Then I think we come up with a game plan, which is basically, what do we need to do to yank make sure Josh's automation doesn't run? How do we need to make sure that E payments show up correctly. I mean specking it out for for Seth, what he needs to change, what needs to change in the vendor invoices report, and then making sure that we coordinate Josh, yanking the automation and Seth making his changes. Okay?

Speaker 5  1:19:23
One other thing for this page would be to make sure that all the buttons are available and usable, you know, whether or not the page is filtered for that particular payment type.

Matthias Miller  1:19:40
So that is

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44
that minor or major? I don't

Matthias Miller  1:19:47
remember we talked about it marks in your list somewhere

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
it might be. I.

Speaker 3  1:20:07
Requires further discussion, requires design stuff.

Speaker 5  1:20:25
No, that's okay. That's what we like. That idea there manual payment button is only

Matthias Miller  1:20:39
so I think the big issue vendor invoices, needing payment. I think the issue is

Speaker 3  1:20:51
now, why is that link actions, they rename it paid manually. I

Matthias Miller  1:21:03
well, I think we would need to ask you, when you do, we could show it all the time

Unknown Speaker  1:21:10
and

Speaker 3  1:21:19
wait, what is the harm in showing it all the time? That's what I'm not sure about.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:28
You know, what could?

Speaker 5  1:21:36
Could there just be one button and then it goes by like, if it's primary check, you click the button and it creates the check. If it was, well, it will be ACH payment. It puts it in that other list. If it's a primary credit card, it just puts it in that other list. I don't know. Maybe that takes way too much other design, but

Unknown Speaker  1:22:07
it could be done.

Speaker 4  1:22:11
What you're looking for Drew is something that's more Alder, if other people use it, right? Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:22:17
that's kind of what I'm at, what I'm after, because you first have to open all the payment types, make sure that all your payment types are correct, sort them, move them around as they're supposed to be, and then you have to go back and filter for the particular payment type so that you can pay them. So I'm just trying to

Unknown Speaker  1:22:37
save that happens, but I

Matthias Miller  1:22:47
what happens if you select multiple payment types and hit pay and you select by check, does everything get paid by check? Or do we say, hey? Nope, you're not going to do that.

Speaker 5  1:23:02
Um, I think currently pay by check it, it creates a check record. Now the I, I'm not sure, but either it could say, Hey, you can't do that, if that's what we need to do, you know, select only one payment type.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:33
You know thing where it says you've selected multiple payment types. I don't know. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:46
I mean, what we could do is

Matthias Miller  1:23:53
how, I mean, depending how, how simple you want to make it. You hit pay, you select the payment type. And the payment type says, Does this generate a check? Does it generate an ACH, or is it a manual payment? So you just hit pay and hit the method, and it goes and does whatever it needs to do.

Speaker 4  1:24:40
Is this something we should just push out till later. Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:24:47
I mean, I don't know. It can, I mean, it's, it's not a huge issue. It can be, it can be pushed around. But I would like if it was kind of. Kept in mind with the, you know, the changes coming for the whole ACH e band, that we don't go create yet another set of buttons somewhere like

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
it sounds like we won't be adding new,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:20
new buttons, at least it should be slimming

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22
it down anyway that.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:34
I mean, I guess

Speaker 5  1:25:39
if it's something that you know, can easily be simplified. That's what I'd be looking for. If it's, yeah, you know, we need to keep the filtration because of this, because of this, then

Unknown Speaker  1:25:53
we'll keep working.

Matthias Miller  1:25:55
I think I'm going to flip it back to you. So this comes back to a question of what is, what is priority? Can we fix this and change it? Is there a good path forward? Yes, is it a day or two obsessed time? Yes, probably. Is this more important than I don't know, payroll module changes? I can't answer that for you, and I think that's where my only, I guess, not to, not to question you guys, but I think you guys have to decide what is the most important, and you guys can determine order, and then we just crank through what's order, I think. So here, here's how I would. So there's one of two ways I would, I would do it. This is kind of how investor tools does their prioritization. They have a they have their their dev priorities meetings, and they allocate a certain amount of resources to that. But then there's also departments within, you know, departments can make internal requests for a specific amount of changes, because we want to keep them happy. But it may or may not drive the bottom line that much or might not impact end users that much, and it's not major priorities. So what I would say to you, what you guys, what I would encourage you guys to do, is have have a list of these are the critical driving priorities that need to happen. The the big rocks has to happen. Then have the have a separate list of these. These are the paper cut issues. And tell Seth, Seth, we want you to devote whatever percentage of time, 20% of your time to paper cut issues, and just create through the list, but never spend more than 20% of your time on paper, cut issues and like that. I think having that kind of a list and prioritizing your list accordingly would be could be really helpful, because it's it gives you freedom to slip things into the priority without feeling like you're slipping the major, major priorities, but it also keeps all of these little odds and ends from disrupting the major whatever the major bottlenecks are, right? And then however fast stuff can crank through them is, however fast to get done. I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:26
so

Speaker 4  1:28:28
And the challenge for us is sometimes knowing how big a project is Drew. Well, what I'm hearing from you is like the vendor invoices needing payment page is, let's do let's do the the the right or the full on fix, rather than just some like, let's do it right, rather than just do A quick fix. Is that right? Well,

Speaker 5  1:29:02
how much do you want to get to the NACHA thing? Like, you know, if we want to, if we want to,

Speaker 5  1:29:20
like, how much, if we, you know, getting this put together. But how much does it take to just say, let's do this email remittance art like that would be step one if we put that into the priority, but we say this thing of payment buttons, let's have that just on the paper cut list. Or Or do they do both have to be together?

Matthias Miller  1:29:59
Okay? Mm. No, no. So I think the I'm gonna have to have to drop, drop here,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:08
the Yeah, we, I mean, I have a proposal,

Matthias Miller  1:30:14
vendors paid today be able to generate an email for any individual one looks kind of like the ACH thing. Little bit of time for me to spec, not more than half a day for sets time.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:34
Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:30:37
so we could do that separately at step one. I mean, that's, that's the most important thing right now, I'd say, let's, let's do that. So half a day on that. Three Drew is going to test. Two is 15 minutes of set time. And then duplication warning is a half day of work for set now, I'd say prioritize them, because they're all that short. Let's just prioritize those three in the correct or in in the order that are listed. Now, you don't have any time this afternoon Matthias where we could look at some of this other stuff. Or how does your day?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:38
It's fine if you don't I think

Unknown Speaker  1:31:47
I'm not sure

Matthias Miller  1:31:57
I could, potentially

Speaker 3  1:32:00
we could, we could keep going for quite some time here, if We wanted to. I, I could

Matthias Miller  1:32:14
potentially go from

Matthias Miller  1:32:21
so I'm not sure what to tell you.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:28
We need to, we need to figure out

Speaker 3  1:32:32
cadence here, and my life has been taken over by other things, rightly or wrongly.

Speaker 4  1:32:39
Well, let's drop it for this afternoon, unless you get an opening, I'll put together notes from our call this morning and try to put together kind of what you I like your suggestion on. Here's the big rocks, here's the paper cuts. And I'll, I'll try to create something that that shows that. And then we can, we can start working off of that. If I put things in the paper cut list that are not for Seth, or are, you know, big rocks, then so does he tell me? But sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:33:10
And I can also get Seth rolling on the payroll module changes that doesn't require any design. It just needs to happen. If that's a priority for you guys, and if it's not, it's then

Speaker 4  1:33:21
I'll put that in the paper cuts loose. It's not that. It's

Unknown Speaker  1:33:27
not that big of a deal.

Matthias Miller  1:33:31
Undeposited funds. Agent report. Just send an email, I think, send an email to Seth, specifically with what if you have a detailed screen and you can show them exactly No, yeah, sure what you want. That seems like something you could really easily hand off as well if you want.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:56
And probably seven the same way. Accounts

Matthias Miller  1:33:59
seven, same way. I think, okay, good,

Speaker 4  1:34:09
cool, okay, sounds good. Thank you,

Matthias Miller  1:34:13
awesome. Yeah, thanks. You.
