Matthias Miller  00:59
Hey, I like the stuff at the top. The only, only little thing I don't know there's a way around this. Am I literally going after is the COO who's leaving, treating this as an exit. I still feel like it sounds like sale of business.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Big, big, big, sorry.

Unknown Speaker  01:25
Can you say this sentence again?

Matthias Miller  01:28
It feels to me like, okay, big exit works for serial entrepreneurs, right? It does not work for the COO who is leaving. I one opportunity to go to the next.

Unknown Speaker  01:47
Can you say that we

Unknown Speaker  01:48
talked

Unknown Speaker  01:49
or business exit?

Matthias Miller  01:55
Yes, but swap business or career exit?

Unknown Speaker  02:00
Yeah. That might be great.

Speaker 1  02:18
Yep, Well, should I say business exit or career transition? Because career exit sounds like you're no longer working. Does that mean retired or just means you've stopped, right?

Matthias Miller  02:40
I still am biased against transition, but

Unknown Speaker  02:44
for career change.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:02
let's try. It doesn't have to be perfect.

Matthias Miller  03:15
Man, I like that first line, staring at the bottle. I

Speaker 1  03:25
um, I it's visual, and visual is persuasive. I like it, and it's good because, hey, that stuff was good. We want to celebrate the past, yep, but we don't want to put the past in the bottle. We want to put you in the bottle.

Unknown Speaker  03:45
Yeah? And we

Matthias Miller  03:47
don't want to put the past you in the bottle. We want to put the who you're because who you are in their becoming into the bottle. Yeah? Undiluted. Um,

Matthias Miller  04:08
is this where you introduce the you can't do this alone. Oh,

Matthias Miller  04:18
it could almost be the self, the reassurance, if you feel overwhelmed because You can't do it alone,

Unknown Speaker  04:34
well,

Unknown Speaker  04:40
that you can't

Unknown Speaker  04:46
here. I'm.

Speaker 1  05:29
Well, you know that line you can't read the label when you're in the bottle. Yep, but I don't want to bring too many bottle metaphors, because it'll confuse the 100 proof side. I like also, don't be the cork in your own bottle. You can't do this. You can't. Okay, you can't.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
You can't. Oh, man,

Speaker 1  06:02
if it's you can't do this alone. Don't leave the quirk in your own bottle. I maybe, maybe we don't need more bottle metaphors. Leave the first line nice and clear,

Matthias Miller  06:17
and then get to the 100 proof later.

Unknown Speaker  06:19
Get to the 100 proof later you

Speaker 1  06:44
you know what? Hey, okay, poshes first seminar on getting off the hamster wheel. This is like it, right? Yeah, you've got, you've kind of gotten off, but you're like,

Matthias Miller  07:07
you're hyperventilating.

Unknown Speaker  07:09
Your hyper says you're high you you've been hyper successful, and now you're hyperventilating just being on the hamster wheel. Yeah, I'm trying. I don't remember what he said,

Unknown Speaker  07:30
except for

Speaker 1  07:34
why he made an argument to not be off the hamster wheel, which I was, I was.

Matthias Miller  07:55
I loved this. I don't you think I like it like, Have you ever been on a What's the equivalent it? There's all these examples. You're moving gallons of milk or water, and then there's this empty one you didn't see it was empty anyway. And where you're on a whatever, like you're so accustomed to running, yeah,

Speaker 1  08:24
okay, maybe that would be the big title in bold.

Unknown Speaker  08:40
Or is that maybe that's a nice follow through after this?

Matthias Miller  08:46
No, but I think this itch, I think this is a pretty core itch, and I think you could say you're finally out to hamster wheel, but your feet want to keep running. You can't get your mind to slow down and you want your next move to count the intellectual sport, like I would do it like this as a statement the intellectual sort of business build your intuition.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
You've been

Matthias Miller  09:17
been moving too fast, and need to wait for your soul to catch up. Yeah,

Speaker 1  09:23
that's fine. And then this guy is, is the is the headline? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:37
So this is a little bit redundant with everything.

Speaker 1  09:47
Well, if it's redundant, it would. How should I put it? What's redundant, if put later, is just emphasis,

Unknown Speaker  09:56
Okay, fair enough do.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
So, so maybe that goes later.

Matthias Miller  10:09
I mean, I don't know if you want this. Maybe just went to invite you into i

Speaker 1  10:52
It's almost like a restored arrest, restored identity.

Matthias Miller  10:58
There's three things that Melvin gave me in his word about it, it's rest, refreshment and printing. He also used the example of Mr. Miyagi and his bonsai trees, unconventional lessons, ways of teaching, not not saying that that's integrated into the copy. But no,

Speaker 1  11:22
that's good because, because it puts them, I like the Miyagi, because it's, you're, it's, it's, uh, Bob HAMP, again, it's not learning. It's not about learning new things. It's about learning a different way.

Unknown Speaker  11:42
Yes,

Speaker 1  11:44
and so the Mr. Miyagi and he, you Bob HAMP uses Mr. Miyagi in the opening of his book. It's crazy. Is, is that? And that's going back to you. It's surrendering control, right? Because he thought, you know, he thought so. So Baba says that, like our assumptions and definitions are what get us into trouble, right, because we don't know what freedom is and what, you know, the Karate Kid thought, Oh, this is how you do martial arts,

Matthias Miller  12:25
yep. Well, he was sold, man, this is, that's really.

Speaker 1  12:31
He needed a direct. He thought he had a he had, oh, maybe this is an idea. You know, it's like,

Speaker 1  12:46
Okay, here's an idea from the Counseling Center. I forget the guy, he does a lot of trauma stuff. He's a professor at the University of Seattle and the Allender center. Okay? Dan Allender, yeah. So one of his meta, one of his metaphors for introducing, like, his program, I was the best ever I've heard. He talks about, we're like, we've been walk like you can be walking on a road, but when you're in conversation with someone and their story, you go off road, and you're like, off trail, and you're kind of in the wilderness, and there's no there's no path, there's that's the that's the main thing. So you've got these business people who've had a clear path, but yes, they've had a they've had a road, everything's been clear, paved, they've had GPS, but now they're off roading, right? But that's where, that's where a lot of rich stuff happens, right? You just, you have to be okay with going off road. It's like if you're trailblazing something new, it's it's trailblazing is requires leaving a paved road, leaving the known world into the unknown. I

Unknown Speaker  14:47
highways, yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:51
super highway, speedways, I don't know.

Speaker 1  14:57
Maybe, yeah, maybe, maybe, okay, I. Your your your five year business plan was the right but now you don't have a plan. I

Speaker 1  15:34
you know, after my PMA, all I wanted was for John pancher to help me, like, knock something out, like a sales page. But we just, we just went in circles. Was like, never

Unknown Speaker  15:53
interesting.

Speaker 1  15:54
I just, he was so focused on me getting a guarantee, yes, and I just like, I surrendered that to him. I thought, Hey, man, you're obviously I'm paying for you

Matthias Miller  16:13
quick mentoring moment. Yeah, trusting the inner knowing it's been a big shift for me. Well, it's conversations with

Speaker 1  16:23
that controlling or is that the internet? No,

Unknown Speaker  16:27
it's, I mean, it can be, I mean, you have to learn,

Matthias Miller  16:30
but I think part of it was learning to trust myself. There been times at roundtable where I'm like, I'm going to hear for an update, and I don't want to hear anybody's advice, because, like, I'm not here for that. And I know that sounds like, Oh, what a waste of round table. What? And I'm not sure if I should have been round table or not, but I am, and parts of it have been wonderful. And the connection with Perry is, you know, this, this might make it all pay off, but, but, or even, you know, just being willing to be like, Nope, that doesn't land. And catch the ball, throw it back, and it's okay. There's a land like, nobody gets to you're the client. And if you want to be a knuckleheaded client who wants to disagree and they want to push guarantees, like, Okay, well, maybe I don't need help with a guarantee. Is there something else you can help with? No, okay, well, fine. Like, obviously we're not connecting here. You're not giving what I need. So let's not try to force this. So anyway, just,

Unknown Speaker  17:32
yeah, it's expensive. It's expensive,

Matthias Miller  17:35
it is, but it's more expensive trying to but which is more expensive, leaving that and getting nothing out of it, or leaving that that and going a path that can is contrarian to your inner knowing and leads to frustration and spiraling Sure.

Speaker 1  17:57
It was just like six months of trusting a path that really wasn't Yep, and I'm not saying that it doesn't get results, but, but I wasn't. I wasn't in the right space. I guess it

Matthias Miller  18:13
might just not have been right for you, which is fine. Okay,

Speaker 1  18:16
I see i i Okay, I maybe we're just brainstorming. But I feel like maybe we have too many metaphors.

Matthias Miller  18:30
I don't disagree. Okay,

Speaker 1  18:33
I think this is, I think this is clear enough you want to keep running. We've already said you don't know where it's just, do

Matthias Miller  18:45
we need this?

Speaker 1  18:52
You can save it. I like, I like, this was kind of a setup that the way you've been doing things is setting up you up for this frustration.

Matthias Miller  19:03
Could we do this?

Speaker 1  19:18
You can't. Yeah, yeah, that's good. Oh, there we go. Look at that. Because this, this ties in to the hamster wheel. This ties in to this, and this ties in to the sanctuary. I like it all right,

Unknown Speaker  19:42
boom.

Speaker 1  19:48
I think I really think dose one clear problem really focuses that was that I. Identifying, yeah, I

Matthias Miller  20:04
don't know what the one sentence, okay, so then, okay, but then here is kind of the missing ingredient. Well, it's not really the missing ingredient, it's the how do you do we really, you said, the outcome is what we're selling here the sanctuary. Can this be as simple as this is a carefully crafted experience? Yes, for you to enter in connect with your inner knowing

Speaker 1  20:43
than fanaggy, do it? It's, it's your done. Fanaggy, right.

Matthias Miller  20:50
Uh, explain Megan

Speaker 1  20:51
to say to his Sten. Fanagy, oh, yeah, okay, that's the cliff, yes. And everyone sold to this, this thin, the thin space in Ireland, space.

Matthias Miller  21:05
Okay, I have my own version. Go ahead, yeah, whatever

Speaker 1  21:08
your version is, that's the that's the thing that isn't just marketing speak. It's, it's the experience side.

Matthias Miller  21:21
It's the, I mean, for me, it's the brick wall. It's the, let me switch my camera so I can show you on my laptop. It's the, it's the Fauci Alba T cell phones, yeah, live edge table. It's the speakers playing instrumental worship music. 24/7, it's the live edge conference table. It's the conference chairs. It's that notepad. It's show

Unknown Speaker  21:55
me your table. Oh my gosh. What's it made out of

Matthias Miller  22:01
live edge? I forget what kind of wood live edge, Colorado lumber live edge

Speaker 1  22:07
just means that it's the natural contour. Yes, you know, you know the edge there is, is. Where'd you get it

Matthias Miller  22:17
up the hill from the Royal Gorge, sawmill.

Unknown Speaker  22:20
I'm sure you follow black anvil.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
Black anvil. I

Speaker 1  22:25
think his name's black anvil. On YouTube, he does all these tables. No, I'll send you a video. Oh,

Matthias Miller  22:34
cabinet in the back. Oh, okay, doors with my server. Everything hidden. Clean the backpack. You really can't spend that much on a good backpack, but $100 backpack with zippers that just work. Nice padding on the inside, soft shoulder pads, all the perfect pockets in all the right places.

Unknown Speaker  22:58
What headphones do

Matthias Miller  22:59
you have for calpatis,

Speaker 1  23:02
I remember you mentioning some. I'm clueless. They're

Matthias Miller  23:06
they are $800 bluetooth headphones. Gotcha, do you? They're the highest, the highest. The only way to get higher quality is wired. Basically, they make beats sound like mud.

Speaker 1  23:20
I mean, all of this is kind of, all of this is kind of instructive, that being like, hey, like, I don't know what your sanctuary is. It's not just, it's not, it's not getting a nice thing and just having a space. It's about where you're centered, right? Like, it's about where that's that's on my map. What? I don't know if I'll ever have this business, but I told you, it's business bottlenecks, identity knots and flow blocks. And that's what you're describing. Is, to me, a flow block. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  24:08
it's Yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:15
And the thing is, the only reason these don't serve utilitarian I did not get these for utilitarian purposes. There is not a goal to be accomplished. I got them because they make my heart sing.

Speaker 1  24:25
Okay, okay. This is a good this is a good new dimension to add. When you say sanctuary, you're meaning also physical. Well, I think that's good. I think Go ahead. So this is my definition based off of what I'm receiving. Yep, sanctuary is, is anything that facilitates inner knowing you.

Matthias Miller  25:02
Yes, and to me, this is this is the thing I can't sell. But I've gone to hell and back to reorient my life around inner knowing. I made an extremely difficult decision to get out of a line of business. I jumped off the deep end because of inner knowing. I ran headlong into financial mayhem for inner knowing, why

Speaker 1  25:30
don't you tell that's that's your story, that's the proof. That's the proof. It shows what you've done for so, so here's earlier or last night, I was looking at the business freedom. You were in business to be free. Yeah, right. And you had a list, and I didn't think it was, it's like the typical things you'd put right on the list, but freedom, it's, it comes from being set free in the sanctuary, right? Yes, I think you, I think that's what you can do. Is like, hey, it's, you know, Tim Francis, it's not fame and fortune, it's truth and mastery, right? So it's, it's truth and sanctuary, like it's,

Matthias Miller  26:32
it's, I mean, or chaos and sanctuary, or the the game is, you know, it in Sanctuary, or whatever it is, it's, it's,

Speaker 1  26:42
and I think that's a good it's not, it's not that those other things. It's not that you don't want to have a family home and have all the right. It's, it's just that

Unknown Speaker  26:58
that's not, that's not what grounds you. It's not, it's not the eye of the storm. It's not like that.

Speaker 1  27:11
I don't know. I think there is a space for you to talk about what you've sacrificed for this pursuit of inner knowing. I don't have my ring. I don't have my ring. Have my ring on me, but it's, it's for my alma mater. It was a great books program study the classics. And our motto is goodness, truth and beauty. They're the, you know they're, they're the classic, I would say, secular, secular virtues. And I just, I just, I think, if you're selling and if you're selling an experience, then this is, that's, this is the stuff that needs to go in which is, which is your, your,

Matthias Miller  28:09
my desert journey, my,

Unknown Speaker  28:11
Your,

Speaker 1  28:17
what's shoot, what's the King Arthur? What's the, you know, the Monty Python? It's the Holy Grail, right? And you have to go through all these sacrifices, but, but you're, it's, it's, it's important that the they have the right, here's, here's what you're imparting. You're, not you're telling them what to search for, but you're also telling them the way you search for it, right? The way. And part of that is smashing idols, right? You can't have idols in a sanctuary, yeah, and so the way you do it and you tell all these idols you smashed, right? There are false prophets. They're false, false voices that don't give freedom. They actually enslave you, right? They just bring frustration and futility. I

Matthias Miller  29:25
Okay, so at what point,

Speaker 1  29:39
and I'm not even saying that needs to go in here. I guess it's, I think it's, it's, it's a connection that,

Speaker 2  29:46
yeah, all art

Matthias Miller  29:51
is made possible by war.

Unknown Speaker  29:58
And I.

Matthias Miller  30:01
There's a lot of ways in which I've fought the battle to create this space so that you can enter in.

Unknown Speaker  30:11
All art is war. All

Matthias Miller  30:14
art is possible by war.

Unknown Speaker  30:20
What do you mean by that?

Matthias Miller  30:21
So it's the only reason Michelangelo could carve the statue of David was because he wasn't being invaded by barbarians. Sure,

Speaker 1  30:44
I forget which founding father said, I go to war so that you could be an artist, like two as kids like you can have peace and then you can create art.

Matthias Miller  31:02
I'm a warriors. My son can be a merchant. Okay, well, let's

Speaker 1  31:08
maybe, maybe that's, maybe that's so so one connection, Psalms, Be still and know that I had gotten it the be still is actually, it's the commander's tent. It's the general's tent in time of war. It's, it's, it's the sanctuary, but you're, that's where you win, right? And,

Unknown Speaker  31:47
yeah,

Matthias Miller  31:49
so let's, if we just Okay, let's just take this top part. I'll keep going. Darn what you want to here it is, thanks for is the place for you to hear again. It's the hidden place for inner Knowing.

Matthias Miller  32:08
I think there is something I

Unknown Speaker  32:44
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:46
are listed

Unknown Speaker  33:01
for your spirit. Spirit is liberated, yeah,

Speaker 1  33:12
this is Where you master your craft. I

Matthias Miller  33:53
I don't know, and I don't know if that's the right path. Maybe it's not enough proof and not enough I don't know what.

Unknown Speaker  33:58
No, no, no, that's good. I would just pick three. So whatever we get to,

Matthias Miller  34:09
sorry, pick three. What

Speaker 1  34:10
like this is the way the CEO Dojo is, right.

Speaker 2  34:20
I well, I

Matthias Miller  34:28
mean, we said

Unknown Speaker  34:30
it's

Matthias Miller  34:32
union with, you know what the trifecta is? Union with truth, authentic self, collaborative strategy. Encourage connection, clarity,

Speaker 1  34:52
yep. I want to switch one or replace one of these. Next step, next move, on your you know, on your clarity around your purpose, or clarity Around

Matthias Miller  36:05
purposes? No, I mean not purpose.

Unknown Speaker  36:10
Yeah, it's i

Speaker 1  36:23
Well, this is has to do, truth, right, clarity, yes, it is on.

Matthias Miller  36:33
I mean, we could reference inner knowing somehow. I

Unknown Speaker  36:43
that's okay,

Speaker 1  36:45
because you have inter, knowing it'll go right here. So you have inter, knowing here

Unknown Speaker  36:55
free, and knowing I

Matthias Miller  37:06
it's not courage to lean into the it's courage to it's not battles in the right term,

Speaker 1  37:15
make Art and go to war. I By the way, just a thought, what if you have the warrior and they're the artist, like you'd go to battle so they they can make art, or maybe, maybe they need both in their life, but,

Matthias Miller  37:45
well, I think it, I don't know if there's a clear pattern or path I find like, let's go back to the First our first conversation. There was a part of, I

Unknown Speaker  38:11
It's the

Matthias Miller  38:16
the parasia thing, the but it's not, it's not, it's not into battle. It's, it's like you will find courage.

Unknown Speaker  38:30
Oh, I wanted true work here,

Unknown Speaker  38:35
because truth, truth is right.

Speaker 1  38:47
Right, and then this has to do with strategic i

Matthias Miller  39:00
a collaborative strategy is about breaking rules.

Matthias Miller  39:11
It could be hamster wheel

Unknown Speaker  39:15
okay

Speaker 1  39:19
to reinvent the rules. It's kind of kind of like, hey, if they're designing their life, I don't know that.

Matthias Miller  39:32
I completely agree with writing your own rules, but it's I also don't know that we're writing to walk

Unknown Speaker  39:44
your path. What is to walk your path?

Unknown Speaker  39:54
Your own path? There. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  39:58
Like it. You. People, okay.

Matthias Miller  40:03
Now, this is the first time we bring in clarity, shot, 100 proof.

Unknown Speaker  40:08
I think this. Let's save it a while.

Unknown Speaker  40:11
Do we keep this here? Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  40:22
Let's hear. Here.

Unknown Speaker  40:36
What about this? I

Unknown Speaker  40:52
work connection to your authentic clarity and

Speaker 1  41:10
on, or that on for your true work, or

Matthias Miller  41:15
for for your, for your true work, clearly for your true work, connection to your,

Speaker 1  41:22
to your and encouraged to walk you Yeah, courage To

Unknown Speaker  41:28
courage for

Unknown Speaker  41:34
connection with with your

Matthias Miller  41:37
authentic self. I

Unknown Speaker  41:57
That's pretty good. I

Speaker 1  42:04
uh, like, those are all larger than life dimensions that I think people in transition are like, I just want, I just want all of it, but you can't wrap your hands around it.

Matthias Miller  42:18
It's very Yes. So

Speaker 2  42:19
think people

Matthias Miller  42:25
in this space long it's like I'm in the ocean and my feet at the bottom, and I long for some stable thing and to put my feet on. And when you give them words like this that put language to transcendent ideas, there is A sense of grounding that they get

Unknown Speaker  42:55
in your circle.

Speaker 1  43:04
So I'm stealing that from someone. I hope that's okay. This gives

Matthias Miller  43:10
you a place to stand when the world around you, around you is shifting,

Unknown Speaker  43:20
or no,

Matthias Miller  43:22
when the world around you is shifting,

Speaker 1  43:30
yeah, that's some Good alliteration shifting. It's like, yeah. So something, something I uh, one of my favorite authors, Boethius. He was the last like Roman and first medievalist like he was in this transition period of what the fall of one, and the entry of the new and one. But he was, he was both Roman and Christian. And he had, he had, I think, he reached the highest political office, and he was thrown into prison over something he didn't commit. Anyways, he wrote, he wrote a book called the Consolation of Philosophy, okay? And it's where he's having to stabilize his mind, yes, because he's like, I did everything. I did everything for you. God, he's like, I did everything right? And then lady philosophy, it's almost like Proverbs, like Lady wisdom, right, comes, visits him in his cell and kind of like rebukes him. And it's like, hey, you've lost who you were, you've lost who you you're, you've lost and. And why? Because he's, he's blaming all these circumstances and his sorrows and woes, and he, she's like,

Unknown Speaker  45:11
you know,

Speaker 1  45:15
basically, he comes up with this beautiful Astronomy Picture of God as the center, and we orbit, right? But like any, any other way of ordering your universe, you're just free. You're just lost, right? And I love that picture of like the center is stabilizing, right? It's like, what do you what are you putting at the center of your universe? It's also something

Matthias Miller  45:52
very interesting in what you said about I've done everything right, and now this is happening to

Unknown Speaker  46:02
me, right? And they had the plan. They went after it. They built the thing.

Unknown Speaker  46:17
Okay? So I

Speaker 1  46:35
honestly, if it's just a 15 minute call, this is good enough, like you might we want to charge, but I think this is a good a good core,

Matthias Miller  46:53
yep. Is there anything that keeps us from just taking this and throwing this on my one page

Unknown Speaker  47:01
I like. And if you add, if you add,

Speaker 1  47:14
the video of the guy after on the next page, on the booking page, on the booking page, so that they're like, Okay, it's not just it's not Just speak, but there's, I maybe need some proof. I

Matthias Miller  47:49

Unknown Speaker  48:59
Hey. Are you? Are you using? Generate Plex.

Unknown Speaker  49:04

Unknown Speaker  49:20
Oh, can I, can I give you, can I give you a theme builder?

Unknown Speaker  49:30
Yeah, it's, yeah, it'll be an

Matthias Miller  49:35

Unknown Speaker  49:40
Yeah, no, that's, that's good.

Matthias Miller  49:44
Mark your administrator access.

Speaker 1  49:45
You won't Yeah, Marcos at being in the zone. All right, here

Unknown Speaker  49:52
always been paranoid about,

Matthias Miller  49:59
I. Um, send this in. I don't know. Do this as a private chat simply doesn't get logged in the logs. Add New User. I

Matthias Miller  50:56
By the way, not to get us derailed, because I want to keep rolling here, but I classical beauty and strategy are very, very closely integrated, in my opinion, um,

Speaker 1  51:16
I listened to a memo this Morning just because I was trying to think of, well, why would someone want to sign up for memos? What was the experience of it? And this is what they said, God is like wanting to release mysteries and unheard of beauties. And I was like, that's a good, good way of describing memos released mysteries, unheard of, beauties, more than you can think, imagine or ask for all you were created to be. So those are the four things I wrote down. Of like, these are good connects for what memos is about. Okay, you don't, you don't need to. Don't worry about adding anything I can. I can move stuff around, and I'll create a page so your your main homepage is, is saved. What's clarity?

Matthias Miller  52:21
Sorry, what's clarity? Oh, it's, it's Microsoft session recordings.

Unknown Speaker  52:33
Are those your weekly calls?

Matthias Miller  52:37
No, these are from. These are from people who've been on the site.

Unknown Speaker  52:48
Oh, user sessions.

Matthias Miller  52:50
User sessions, thank you. I'm sorry, wow, user session recordings. Gotcha. So some of these are probably you,

Unknown Speaker  53:02
yeah? I mean, I keep refreshing,

Matthias Miller  53:05
but some of them are not like this one. Here's somebody on my page for a minute and 15 seconds from Facebook, yeah? I mean, that's a really engaged reader. Yeah.

Speaker 2  53:21
I you could do

Unknown Speaker  53:28
hot jar at some point.

Matthias Miller  53:30
This is the free version of hot jar.

Unknown Speaker  53:34
Now, hot jar has a free version. Well, they do,

Unknown Speaker  53:36
yeah, is it better?

Speaker 1  53:40
I like it because it shows heat mapping and also clicks click mapping.

Matthias Miller  54:08
It clicks. I'm not sure. It may have just been phone caps, guys, okay,

Speaker 1  54:15
well, why don't you take a break? I'm gonna, I'll add this to the main page,

Speaker 1  54:32
and then we could see if there's anything else that could be added to it,

Matthias Miller  54:39
I guess. Okay, so, minimum, okay, the let me check this. Let me ask Audra.

Unknown Speaker  54:54
Can you update?

Matthias Miller  54:57
Update with me on the testing layer? Yeah,

Speaker 1  55:02
oh yeah. It'd be great to have, like, a running document of testimonials. Can you, can you create a shared drive?

Matthias Miller  55:11
I do have one. I can I can move these into there. I've got a whiskey account that I'm putting these into. Currently, these are the

Matthias Miller  55:40
yes and then I need To give her access to this one as well. I

Matthias Miller  56:12
I mean, it seems like we're waiting primarily on, I guess, big picture, my sprint is get enough in place that it can reply back to the list with a thank you, and here's what's up. I

Matthias Miller  56:50
so we need testimonials. We need a page. We need thrive, cart products, a coupon code for those. Names for these different products and levels.

Unknown Speaker  57:11
I'm sorry. Can you say that again? So

Matthias Miller  57:13
we need, we need a landing page for Perry's, for plant Perry. We need the testimony,

Unknown Speaker  57:22
or coupon,

Matthias Miller  57:26
okay? Or coupon, okay, no fear, but somewhere on the somewhere on the site. Where do you we're going to have a products page on the site with all the different things laid out, or is that on a landing page? I think secret.

Speaker 1  57:50
I think I think they

Matthias Miller  58:01
I think it's two options. I think one is free 15 minute or like, let's go straight for it, and then they have the option for the VIP the two hour the VIP.

Speaker 1  58:18
Let's Okay, let's open the offer page so I know which one you're highlighting.

Unknown Speaker  58:25
Author,

Unknown Speaker  58:31
can you share your screen you

Matthias Miller  58:35
want me to read? Sorry.

Speaker 1  58:36
I then, since like 630s my brain is a little brighter in it.

Matthias Miller  58:46
Okay, well, promise, I'll get you both of us.

Speaker 1  58:50
Okay, which, which offer you said this? Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  58:57
think it's these three.

Unknown Speaker  58:59
Yeah. Oh, totally.

Matthias Miller  59:03
So we need a page for these. Okay, you call this the shot glass, the something, the something and the something. But

Speaker 1  59:15
I don't, I don't think you need to publish the 15 minute, right?

Matthias Miller  59:23
You would, you would have it on the homepage as

Speaker 1  59:25
the I would always have, I would always have pricing, because then, if you want, oh, here's the thing. There's, there's a couple ways of going about this. It's something that you privately extend when you outreach, right? I really like that, because I don't if it's on the main page, people are just going to go to that.

Matthias Miller  59:50
And so you would have a paid 15 minute, which is 1005 it's $250 i.

Speaker 1  1:00:01
Oh, thinking of not even having that as an option, not having it as an option at all, and then just three, three options is plenty to think about. So you

Matthias Miller  1:00:09
have the homepage with a button to go to the next page, which is a products listing. Products could be or the products could be a page on the menu, and it has these listings however they're laid out, and then, and then, we need a

Speaker 1  1:00:31
the pay what you want. Does that take them to PayPal? Thrive,

Matthias Miller  1:00:36
cart, thread, cart has to pay what you want.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:42
How is that? Pay what you want.

Matthias Miller  1:00:46
They can put you can have a $1 minimum pay what you want. They

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
can customize it in Thrive cart.

Matthias Miller  1:00:54
Yes,

Speaker 1  1:00:57
I'm just not as familiar with I own it, but I've never used it anyway.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
Get it eventually. Yeah, I it? Oh, I do this for people who want to pay one off in the voices my credit card and I have a little script that populates the price and voice number as well. Just to put it in the it can generate a link. But anyway, that's neither here nor there. Okay, there's a choose your price. Great.

Speaker 1  1:01:40
And, and is this what they see, including, for if they wanted to say, hey, I want the one day option, would they have to fill in the Choose your price?

Matthias Miller  1:01:53
No, they would have, I would probably have separate products for each of them.

Speaker 1  1:01:56
Okay, so three separate, three separate link buttons. Yes. Okay, great. So that's, that's Audra. Can do that.

Matthias Miller  1:02:08
I don't know if I give it her access, I don't know, then

Speaker 1  1:02:11
that's horrible delegating this stuff. But that's something I could knock out too. You could. I would do it. You should do that because that's, that's your commerce controls, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:02:27
Now, I mean, if there's questions about the design, I don't know we said I was going to weigh this down for both of our sakes,

Speaker 1  1:02:36
just plenty. Just don't worry about design. We just need the wireframe,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:45
basically just this.

Matthias Miller  1:02:52
And then there's the question of, I guess we would put the booking page. I don't know how we limit the quantity. Is that limited in the booking page?

Speaker 1  1:03:05
You just remove the button. You just say, you just fill it in. You say, hey, it's full. You remove the button. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:03:14
I was thinking you have up to five seats a month. Or you have up to, oh, I can have a max quantity sold in thrivecart, too.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
I thought, I thought this was just for Planet Perry, for Planet Perry. Ah, Okey, dokey. But if you want, this could be an ongoing option for anyone pay what you want.

Matthias Miller  1:03:45
I love, love, love the two hour container. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:03:51
I thought this was just a way of being generous to specific communities so that they know that that's your heart, right? Yep, yep, but,

Speaker 1  1:04:18
and then, going beyond planet Perry, you get to reserve a 15 minute or 30 minute as vouchers. Hey, this is free for you 15 minute or hey, you know you want to pick my brain. Here's something. Pay what you want. I only make this available to five people a month.

Matthias Miller  1:04:47
So side note, these are not pick your problem, right. These are not pick your brain. These are all condensed or expanded versions of i. You need a session with me. I will. You can't afford the $1,000 let me, yeah, how about we do a 30 minutes, and I'll only charge you. X,

Speaker 1  1:05:11
yeah, it's, it's, I'm breaking my my business track rules. I'm breaking my rules for

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
you. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:27
All right, good. Then,

Matthias Miller  1:05:37
do you have time tomorrow afternoon to dig back into this stuff as well. Yeah, I'm free Mark 12 to about 230 Pacific,

Speaker 1  1:05:53
yeah, just even need to send me. I mean, yeah, that sure, black enough. Oh, that works. I

Matthias Miller  1:06:05
need, I need to block it out for me. That for you. I mean, even if it's, yeah, great. I brilliant. Appreciate it. All right, yeah, next steps, I need products. I feel like we're not putting product descriptions. It's just a 30 minute. What are these sessions called? How about this?

Speaker 1  1:06:30
Do you want to a sanctuary session?

Matthias Miller  1:06:35
Sanctuary session, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, two hours, one day,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:41
yeah, but you're not putting the 15 minute

Matthias Miller  1:06:45
right. That's not you don't pay for that. That's another link, sanctuary session. Let me put this in here.

Speaker 1  1:07:00
And that's good, because it's a little bit different than memos, like, just for the people who are like, oh, yeah, I know exactly that.

Matthias Miller  1:07:12
Like, no, it's not that. It's a flavor you've never tasted before. My friend, all right. And then on the thank you page, we could have a, we could have the we could embed the calendar link right there, if we wanted to. Is that the best way to do it, trying to think from a fulfillment standpoint, or the one, the one day is almost certainly going to require back and forth with Audra and me to get it scheduled, unless I know for a fact, two hour, I think we have a booking link.

Speaker 1  1:07:47
Here's, here's what you do is you reserve. You just start reserving a couple like one day every two weeks, and it becomes more of your own sanctuary, or strategy time with me, or whatever you can fill it in if it doesn't get used, right?

Matthias Miller  1:08:17
Or I could potentially open it up for two hours, there might be a logistical layer, but,

Speaker 1  1:08:25
and you could always tell them, hey, like, let's have, let's split this into two days, like, six hours. Like, why don't we just do four hours, and then you, you go off to your life and come back, we do two hours as a debrief. I By the way, that's way better than six hours. I like what Megan, what Megan does is you always have, like, an intake, you do the session, you do the training, and maybe there's a beginning, middle and end, right? Because it's kind of Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  1:09:10
I always wonder if the the one day could even be a three pack.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:17
What's a three pack?

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
Three two hour sessions? I

Matthias Miller  1:09:29
that I'm over complicating it.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
You can reserve that. You can ask them.

Speaker 1  1:09:40
I do wonder, though, if there's enough for people to feel like, oh well, a one day, like the three pillars feels more appropriate for one day and that content isn't in there, right? It feels like Is there enough? Me. Eight for one day.

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
I think it's higher tier people who know that they've been highly successful, and they want the in depth, and they feel like they have a really big problem to solve, okay, okay, yeah, they're just like, I want your time. Like, we are going to wrestle this thing, okay? Like, the one guy was talking to you about he thought, How do I make money in the next x runway that I have was a really big, complicated problem. I could have sold them on a one day, and we might have solved everything by lunch. And then it's like, okay, what do you want to do? Like, I love hanging out with you. Like, let's chill. You got anything else you want to just block out time? I'll hang out here. You start executing and putting some stuff together like but I think it's more perception on their end of how big they think the problem is and what level they've been playing before. In price tag,

Speaker 1  1:10:54
you could add a one day add A plus helpline to it

Matthias Miller  1:11:01
plus 30 day helpline.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:03
That's that's a bonus.

Matthias Miller  1:11:06
Like, would you do it for 30 days or just indefinite?

Speaker 1  1:11:14
A 30 day, yeah, yeah, and then maybe they revisit, maybe it's four hours helpline, and then you finish with two hours. I don't know there's, well, I

Matthias Miller  1:11:32
think even, even on the one day, I think there's a even a plus one hour debrief at the end,

Speaker 1  1:11:44
okay, three days later, what I like the I like the day. I actually like it all in one day. And here's why. You know these guys, they do vision, vision days. That's what this is, it is. And you know what? You can give them an assignment on the day, like, hey, go take a walk. Think through this. When you get back, I'm here, you can like, there's ways of making this interesting. Or like, hey, we I recommend you go book an Airbnb, or you go, I don't know there. I think there's ways in which

Matthias Miller  1:12:25
it's the Mr. Miyagi assignments.

Speaker 1  1:12:27
It's not it's not just standing in front of a computer for six hours.

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
No. And I really, really want to get them in person. And I don't know how much I can, but that's my goal for this stuff, pattern, interrupt, space creation. It's not that much. The big value add, and especially if they show up on site, is you've got, first of all, there's that, that connection and rapport, but people know you're out of the office, and they know they need to stop bugging you. And that's half the battle for some of these guys. Yeah. And then they can tack on some R and R on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
So let me know if this is possible. Could you advance 500 even, even 250 would be good?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
What do you mean? Advance,

Speaker 1  1:13:24
send, send a PayPal or Venmo.

Speaker 2  1:13:30
Oh, to you, that would be great. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:13:35
where, which one and where,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:39
which is easiest for you?

Matthias Miller  1:13:42
PayPal. Okay, I don't know why I'm asking you PayPal would be best.

Speaker 1  1:13:56
I literally, can I email you my information? Yes, I literally got locked out on my last pass. And they're, they're the worst. It's they're absolutely the worst. All of their password reset methods, like, none of them. It doesn't matter like, like, how much I confirm, like, it just a mess. It was like a week of trying to restore, okay, I'll send you an info. I I will. So I have, I have, I have, generate press plus, or generate press one, and it basically gives me, like, it's, it used to be you'd pay, like, $100 a year for just access to one, but I have 500 sites I can do this on. It's no it's no. Have my back to plug your intensity. Okay, okay, so I'll play around with that, and then I'm free later today too.

Matthias Miller  1:15:13
If I think you said two to four, I wrap up at four, because that's five my time. I'm going to have a little bit of time from one to

Speaker 1  1:15:23
just text me, just just text or call me

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
for anything. All right. All right. Sounds

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
good. Thanks, Mark. Yeah.
