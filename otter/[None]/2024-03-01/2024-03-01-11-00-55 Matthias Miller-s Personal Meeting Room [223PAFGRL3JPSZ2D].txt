Unknown Speaker  00:18
Jason Hey how's it going?

Matthias Miller  00:21
Good

Unknown Speaker  00:23
I think we show share a commonality here

Matthias Miller  00:28
everybody comments the fact room? Oh you have a real brick wall back there

Unknown Speaker  00:35
yeah

Unknown Speaker  00:36
yes yes I

Matthias Miller  00:37
do and so to you

Unknown Speaker  00:41
cool how are you doing?

Unknown Speaker  00:43
Doing pretty good

Unknown Speaker  00:44
good awesome awesome all right

Unknown Speaker  01:06
all right

Speaker 1  01:16
so based on a vector what is the total length of all lines within the vector scaled to a certain dimension right

Speaker 2  01:31
so the file your estimate about how the software figures out file or the price Yeah. So, it should be the file should be to scale okay. So it shouldn't have to figure out size it should have to figure out yeah, what the line length is and how much material it's taken for the entire thing. I should pull up my email here to see what exactly if it's used for details what's

Matthias Miller  02:12
the exact format or format

Unknown Speaker  02:15
so the vector files

Speaker 2  02:20
you're saying like the file format like dot EPS dot a

Unknown Speaker  02:26
DOT number PDF, so

Unknown Speaker  02:32
we can be

Unknown Speaker  02:34
okay

Speaker 2  02:37
you can save a vector file as a PDF and then you can open it in a vector program so like the suncat Send website that I had to view they're showing like DX DWG AI EPS step STP

Unknown Speaker  03:00
sure sure

Unknown Speaker  03:10
and then I got it fair enough

Unknown Speaker  03:33
Let me grab that your instinct clue

Matthias Miller  04:00
gigabit syncope

Unknown Speaker  04:01
senders and support

Matthias Miller  04:07
in one of the following formats, but not including stepping and STP are both 3d

Unknown Speaker  04:17
Not even exactly sure that sounds great.

Matthias Miller  04:21
Which you would

Unknown Speaker  04:26
do you want to support that?

Speaker 2  04:30
I mean typically what I do is I asked for EPs okay

Speaker 2  04:43
if they have a vector program they should be able to export as EPS or like aI files I can deal with to write every deal Do I think yes I

Matthias Miller  05:10
mean you could you would definitely simplify it if you can stay we only do we only do

Unknown Speaker  05:23
DBS

Speaker 2  05:26
Yeah, well that's what I prefer anyway so I'd be fine. Okay,

Matthias Miller  05:30
that's a fair concession

Unknown Speaker  05:36
okay

Matthias Miller  06:12
would you have any transformations in it scaling rotation that would

Unknown Speaker  06:20
could affect it

Unknown Speaker  06:25
you're saying where it would need to scale a file was rotated.

Matthias Miller  06:34
Yeah, I guess I'm not familiar enough with EPS, whether it can can use scale individual elements

Speaker 2  06:51
it's, so it's a vector file. So you could scale anything infinitely. Right? Right. But all the files that I receive are supposed to be pretty much production ready. Besides having like, adding this third placement, okay.

Matthias Miller  07:15
So, as far as the, the dimensions itself,

Unknown Speaker  07:21
are they what units are they in? Within the EPS

Speaker 2  07:29
Well, oftentimes when people send them in points, but I always change the files to inches, because I hate dealing with that. And I don't know why. It doesn't make any sense to me.

Unknown Speaker  07:47
And does the file specify the does the file specify the the format or is the EPS format always points?

Unknown Speaker  08:01
No, like I could save it as well.

Speaker 1  08:09
If we open one here, we take a look well

Speaker 2  08:14
as I think if I save it as a certain measure measurement

Unknown Speaker  08:34
stated we'd use the otherwise, I mean, I think I mean point points convert straight and convert to inches. So it might just be that you're so open somewhere, right?

Matthias Miller  09:06
Sure, okay. Fair enough. It looks to me like it's

Speaker 1  09:09
always stored in points. But then conversions are done in any number of different ways if you want to look at it in a different different way

Unknown Speaker  09:34
so

Matthias Miller  09:38
you take the total length of all the, all the strokes like are they all I mean, it could be any number of

Speaker 1  09:49
spec spackling to actually let's do one

Unknown Speaker  10:07
That is.

Speaker 1  10:54
Seems to me like there should be things that would get pretty close or that this is the kind of thing that folks other folks who want to do and you don't have to get TD into EPs and GA geometry to get this done that can be

Unknown Speaker  11:17
your sound like coding something or what

Matthias Miller  11:21
well I mean yeah, I guess my question is exactly how much custom coding there is if there's there should be at least some things that you could you could be able to wire together that

Unknown Speaker  11:36
that is

Speaker 2  11:40
I mean, here's the thing you got CNC control software though estimate how long a job takes to finish that's already figuring the lines and how quickly it can cut those lines based on the thickness of the material and the capabilities of the machine

Unknown Speaker  11:58
yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:02
so you just have to formulas for material costs and timeframe and all that

Speaker 1  12:13
Okay, let's see what um, Excel spreadsheet no we're not looking for that cost you know

Speaker 1  12:25
there's somebody built their own or did something I guess we could take a look and see if there's any indication that they've used a third party to calculate the stuff

Unknown Speaker  12:41
you're saying on Sunday

Unknown Speaker  12:43
Yeah. And that are similar that on a similar website

Unknown Speaker  12:58
they.

Unknown Speaker  13:46
Not sure

Unknown Speaker  13:54
okay

Unknown Speaker  13:57
by the way that

Unknown Speaker  14:04
green tree gateway that

Speaker 1  14:08
Yeah, I saw that but that's looks like a let's say current payment processor No. Argument sandbox

Unknown Speaker  14:28
fields they are checked out.

Matthias Miller  14:33
Yeah, that's the you can actually go pay for your thing after you uploaded.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
This offer Well, direct manipulation restrict activation.

Speaker 1  15:49
My actually if you're needing to do something custom and might actually be easier to add them submit

Unknown Speaker  15:57
DPS but converted to SVG okay let me take a look at what this is saying wait a minute

Speaker 1  16:23
would you have a file that sample files she could send over

Unknown Speaker  16:36
you want to end EPS or doesn't matter

Matthias Miller  16:38
I mean if you can get into SVG first that would make my life easier

Unknown Speaker  16:43
yeah

Speaker 2  17:39
and where are you gonna email that to you or

Unknown Speaker  17:44
emails fine yeah if that works in

Unknown Speaker  18:35
this has a crazy amount of little stuff on

Unknown Speaker  19:16
Do you know what the length should be to the length those

Speaker 2  19:30
the overall document is 50.2475 33.8 to seven inches

Unknown Speaker  19:44
does that I'm not sure what the units are in here. You don't know what units the SVG is? would use the basically

Unknown Speaker  20:07
pixels.

Matthias Miller  20:09
Pixels are okay 96 DPI 300 DPI give me an idea

Unknown Speaker  20:21
7272

Unknown Speaker  20:23
Okay

Speaker 1  20:29
all right, let's try this then. So we got 7262 inches Do you think there's 207 feet of etching on this one?

Speaker 2  20:50
Possible there's a lot of little, little thanks and thesis we could do something simple and like a circle or something and just see it the figures that are

Matthias Miller  21:08
so now if you how do you handle like these square blocks?

Speaker 2  21:23
Or like the server? This one? Yeah, this one is a file from actually another wholesale sign company that router stuff and they can't router this too. It's too tiny. And they gave me two pieces of acrylic. So that's why those two bonds

Matthias Miller  21:42
are good. But like

Speaker 2  21:44
when you typically it all be in one big thing? Sure. But

Matthias Miller  21:49
if you you've got a certain level. Maybe you talked about this in the email. Let me go

Matthias Miller  22:07
so would you just be cutting the edges here? Where are you cutting the

Unknown Speaker  22:13
cutting lines?

Matthias Miller  22:18
Okay, like let's say that yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:19
I'm cutting the black pieces out.

Matthias Miller  22:22
Okay, So doesn't this also require you to know how wide you can like let's say the H depending on the width of the H

Unknown Speaker  22:34
How many cuts to get that

Matthias Miller  22:38
or is that a single

Speaker 2  22:46
so basically, I'm cutting around all these bits and cutting them out.

Matthias Miller  22:54
So then I'm not like on breathing got it? Okay, so you're cutting them out see we're still just looking at the edges we're not you know size of object doesn't matter it's only perimeter that matters that's what I want to make sure I right

Speaker 2  23:10
right size matters to the effect of how much material is is being

Unknown Speaker  23:18
right makes sense

Matthias Miller  23:22
well okay

Unknown Speaker  23:49
regenerates the placement from mounting

Speaker 2  24:00
the other variable could be if something needs to change in a certain color, it would have to differentiate between the colors and add for paint. That's where you would need the area of the specific colors if we wanted to add another level of complexity

Matthias Miller  24:28
right

Matthias Miller  24:44
Well, I mean that might not actually be

Matthias Miller  25:22
yeah

Matthias Miller  25:57
I think

Matthias Miller  26:06
this gets complicated because I mean there's again it depends a little bit what other tools and get our hands on to make it easier, but you can have

Unknown Speaker  26:17
a wait is

Unknown Speaker  26:19
this actually accurate

Matthias Miller  26:24
because if you have a

Matthias Miller  26:42
you can have shapes that are formed by multiple overlapping

Matthias Miller  26:54
like you could have a square covered by a circle with

Unknown Speaker  27:06
this is actually matter

Unknown Speaker  27:15
so, I can send you

Matthias Miller  27:18
like, like the basic idea is that you can, you can have you can have an object, you can reverse part of that object, you could throw another object on top to create a complex shape. And so, if you just look at it from the standpoint of what's the perimeter of all the shapes, I guess the worst thing is you're going to overbid the job I don't think there's ever a time when you would underbid it does that make sense?

Speaker 2  27:46
Unless it would think like if there's a job with a backer panel and then you're putting letters on top it could take the backer panel and no top letters is one piece of acrylic in they actually need to be cut out into separate pieces but if they're separate colors

Unknown Speaker  28:19
like this just got on

Unknown Speaker  28:27
to sleep and not

Speaker 2  28:57
still seems like you could have some code in there where something if something's on top of another filled object that it would figure that as a separate layer that needs to be cut out of a separate piece of material

Matthias Miller  29:15
right like

Speaker 2  29:21
sometimes you would have letters cut out or cut all the way through so then you would just overdid the job

Unknown Speaker  29:32
question is I mean

Speaker 2  29:37
Oh no you want not if the letters were actually cut out in the material on the ball that they probably not. You're gonna say

Matthias Miller  29:55
yeah, I mean, even in the example you gave some of these In

Unknown Speaker  30:04
some of these shapes especially the bottom left

Matthias Miller  30:09
look like they could be that style where you get some kind of maybe that in the bottom left circle on the top left of that bottom left circle well in the top left of the any of those circles in the or just at the top left circle any of those blobs there look like they could be done with that type of you know exactly whether that's a single single object path looks like the kind of thing that could be done with multiple multiple layers

Speaker 2  30:48
so when you when you open the file you don't see a transparent background in between those objects

Unknown Speaker  30:58
yes

Matthias Miller  31:06
okay, do you have to

Speaker 1  31:07
understand Can you within SVG Can you can you have a shape that basically forces transparency on top of another shape

Speaker 2  31:27
saying well, you have a shape on top of a white sheet

Matthias Miller  31:32
Could you do Could you do something like

Unknown Speaker  31:34
have a black box with a transparent circle on top of it the transparency would be literally the color transparent not transparent to

Speaker 1  31:46
the bottom of the SUV to the behind the SVG not transparent to black

Unknown Speaker  31:57
maker pro

Unknown Speaker  31:59
probably not.

Speaker 2  32:00
What I'm saying is when I opened this SVG file it shows showing the black objects and everything else is transparency doctrine.

Unknown Speaker  32:13
And I see that

Unknown Speaker  32:15
so I'm trying to understand what you're saying because

Unknown Speaker  32:18
I think it's irrelevant

Speaker 1  32:27
Okay, so factor our cut lines factors are total length and thickness of material

Matthias Miller  32:41
and so your ultimate calculation for cutting is

Speaker 1  32:46
is it's CNC time that's your core your financial price on or laser time

Speaker 2  32:54
well, you're saying for the total price of everything for the

Unknown Speaker  32:59
for the cuts

Unknown Speaker  33:02
Yeah, so for the cuts that would be laser time

Unknown Speaker  33:05
okay, and then there's material

Speaker 2  33:10
material costs there's laser time there's really studying out system or tape there be that cost for the time and materials that

Speaker 2  33:26
patterns you know they want a pattern that we saw which is typically included when painting in the book shipping

Speaker 2  33:41
Okay, so the other factor is whether you have any objects that are larger than X for shipping because you can have a whole bunch of little objects or if you have one big panel that's 60 inches long that's a whole different story for shipping for packing it in for shipping it costs

Unknown Speaker  34:13
Sorry, I keep making it more complex

Matthias Miller  34:24
Okay, leisure time is easy, I mean ish, total length thickness of material, calculate you know, speed per inch or foot or whatever it is kind of speed metric or time metric during delays your time multiplied by cost per minute, or whatever the appropriate denominator is. Material also, that's basically square foot plus a times a you know, type of material square foot price times square feet.

Unknown Speaker  34:53
Right. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  34:58
Stood mount system.

Matthias Miller  35:06
Okay, so stem stem out.

Speaker 1  35:08
Excuse me stem out system sounds cool. But you've got,

Matthias Miller  35:15
like the example you gave. How exactly are you going to without some kind of AI or equivalent? How are you going to place those accurately?

Speaker 2  35:32
I was hoping you would have an answer for that. Yeah, no, I don't. Well, that was a long shot. So I'm I'm is, I'm not sure how you even do that. I mean, it seems like on most basic letters, it should be able to figure out if, but yeah, again, you're probably going to have to have some AI. Something to figure that out.

Matthias Miller  35:58
I mean, you're gonna have to figure out

Unknown Speaker  36:02
typically have three per letter.

Matthias Miller  36:08
You're gonna have to figure out first, is it a letter?

Speaker 1  36:12
And which way should I be turned?

Matthias Miller  36:16
Well, okay, okay, fair enough. Any object, but you're gonna have to figure out what's right side up for the object. No, do you? Or does that? Does that not matter? Okay,

Speaker 2  36:27
so here's the deal. Here's the deal with the, the example I sent you that's already nested in a crazy way. Yeah, typically, when I get files, they are how the sign would be installed. spaced properly whatever. So like that record meter box one that I sent you that's how the sign is actually going to be installed. So typically, it's not going to be nested and that's where I was wondering if the software could auto nest it somehow and figure out the square footage based on that right

Speaker 2  37:21
the other thing Sorry, I keep adding things. The other thing is so like this board meter box one, the backer panel is quarter inch and everything else is 316. So if the software cuts that out here the colors tell me the thicknesses of each right need to do something like that to figure the calculations

Unknown Speaker  38:00
so in this case,

Matthias Miller  38:05
you would have a cut out

Unknown Speaker  38:09
your back or

Matthias Miller  38:12
your you got back in panel?

Unknown Speaker  38:15
Yeah. Or

Matthias Miller  38:16
whatever back or now, you would have a suit when you cut it out. It would have Ford meter box cut out of it, and it would have like this. No.

Speaker 2  38:27
So the black box is this going to be one big panel. I'm gonna cut forward meter box out of white acrylic and glue it on top. Take out whatever. And then I'm going to cut out the Ford in the orange box and fillings in between the letters out of another acrylic and glue that on top of the black. So Black panels is going to be one big solid rectangle.

Matthias Miller  38:57
So is the orange. Does the orange have holes where the Ford cut out or is the orange solid? Okay, it

Speaker 2  39:09
has holes for the for that out and then I have to cut the fort out and then I have to paint them and make sure that I leave enough space for them to now typic

Unknown Speaker  43:52
Okay I think I'm back. All right, welcome back

Matthias Miller  44:01
so

Matthias Miller  44:09
do you want to fix this for your own company?

Unknown Speaker  44:11
Or do you want to start a software company

Speaker 2  44:19
Why do you think there's a big market for it to resell to other people or what?

Matthias Miller  44:26
I don't know if there's a big market or not.

Speaker 1  44:28
I don't know if there isn't, ah last year

Unknown Speaker  44:44
there you go.

Unknown Speaker  44:46
I'm not sure why I keep getting disconnected.

Unknown Speaker  44:50
I'm not sure what's going on.

Matthias Miller  44:54
So, I don't know if there's a big market or not.

Matthias Miller  45:03
Any pricing that you can do based off of

Speaker 1  45:05
perimeter dropped it's simple. I mean, you know this

Matthias Miller  45:14
the moment you start getting into things like

Matthias Miller  45:33
are you go do you want to? Okay, just call me on the phone. Yeah. So let me do that.

Unknown Speaker  45:42
Just gonna try it on my phone anyway.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
All right. Sounds good. Okay, all right back
