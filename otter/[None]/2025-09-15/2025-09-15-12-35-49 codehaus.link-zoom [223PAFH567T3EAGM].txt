Speaker 1  00:00
Thing that's gonna I want to make sure I understand how to how to do well, because his notifications are fun. People like notifications. I don't know why. I do know why because,

Speaker 2  00:14
yes, Dwayne and 20, minute zoom call starting 15 pm today.

Unknown Speaker  00:39
Okay, sweet.

Speaker 1  00:50
What in the world? What was that? Um, just playing with, switching over to my MacBook. Apparently there's, there's something called MacBook Pro, desk view camera. Oh, okay, it like looks down at your I don't know, weird,

Unknown Speaker  01:17
suppose, if you want to,

Matthias Miller  01:21
like, take notes and share things with people

Speaker 1  01:24
I don't know. I'm, I'm, I'm fairly familiar with Apple's platform. It's just there. There are nuances that, like, really, PC and Apple, Could you, could you not agree on the copy and paste key commands? Like, really, I have to learn. I have to do, you know how much muscle memory I have in control C and Control V? It's like baked into my brain from ages ago now to go to command C and Command V, feels like I'm literally learning a new skill.

Matthias Miller  01:55
I agree. And then you start doing pathways are happening in the brain. Then you do remote desktop into into somewhere, and

Speaker 1  02:06
yes, you keep opening their windows, window, the window start thingy, because you keep hitting the Windows team

Unknown Speaker  02:14
Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 1  02:15
Anyway. All right, all right. Things to get into.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
You ready?

Speaker 1  02:22
Yep, all right, let's go. I want to, I want to do, I want to get this thing working and sign off on it so we can push it over to Seth and company to turn it into the contract search. Go to user folders, reports, contract search. First and foremost, go ahead and hit continue. Let's figure out these negative, negative weirdness on, on some some of these, yes, some of that negative payment amounts that are like negatives. And what's happening?

Matthias Miller  03:04
I'm gonna guess the balance of being

Speaker 2  03:08
incorrectly calculated, payment, amount, contract balance,

Speaker 1  03:17
well and and we need to update some of some of this math stuff needs to go away, and we need to actually put in actual contract balance. Which I there is a contract balance macro, but it was returning nothing at all. And so I was confused,

Unknown Speaker  03:39
or I thought there was Go, Go, search the

Matthias Miller  03:49
Well, I mean, either way, I don't believe in your math

Speaker 1  03:52
well, but My math was, was, was making up numbers,

Unknown Speaker  03:59
cash price. Financing base.

Matthias Miller  04:06
This is CRA. This isn't even a CRA contract effective value, okay, there's a contract effective value.

Unknown Speaker  04:23
Are fees to be entered.

Matthias Miller  04:30
We have more fees, it says, and

Unknown Speaker  04:38
rental fee and occurred contract events, subtotal.

Matthias Miller  04:43
So it says that we have

Unknown Speaker  04:52
22

Unknown Speaker  05:00
What in the world we want to

Unknown Speaker  05:14
from September?

Unknown Speaker  05:32
How many periods

Matthias Miller  05:40
the incident has? $16,000 of fees. Well, part of the issue here is, is

Matthias Miller  05:53
it's using financing base versus the rental fees entered, which is just

Unknown Speaker  05:59
bogus. Should we get?

Speaker 1  06:03
Yeah, should we Yes? So, so this is, this is what I want to when I said last week that we we got to go through and make sure things are working correctly. This was some of the stuff I was referring to, because we got some wild math happening in here. Want to make sure that we now, now, unless, okay, what go out to the contract record, and what is the what? Oh, I thought you, yeah, you have a contract open. Go back over to your contract. Okay, I want to see the record itself. What is supposed to be the effective value? Is that supposed to be the building? Is that supposed to be the contract value? Like, what? What was the effective value supposed to be in in our calculations cash?

Matthias Miller  06:53
Well, I was thinking, that's the the effective cash price of the building.

Speaker 1  06:57
Well, that's what I thought, too. But are you sure they didn't mean for that to be the contract balance calculated off of the purchase amount times term, or divided by blah, blah,

Matthias Miller  07:06
blah, they're so they don't understand. They just don't understand. They're just wrong.

Unknown Speaker  07:13
Well, okay, I'm okay with that.

Matthias Miller  07:20
I wonder, Is

Speaker 1  07:22
it, is it valuable to have Seth a part of this conversation so we can get a lot of this stuff clear, so we can straighten it out and get things updated? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:19
wildly creative. Yeah, it's

Matthias Miller  08:55
yeah, okay, so I think I mean to Your point. Um,

Speaker 1  09:21
um and by the way, the math here you're currently have showing here was, I was making things up just so I could make the report look like it had a balance.

Unknown Speaker  09:31
Makes sense. It

Speaker 1  09:34
is in no way indicative of the way a calculation should it should take place. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  09:47
See. Let's

Unknown Speaker  09:55
see.

Unknown Speaker  10:35
But your CEO is gonna be pretty mad at me.

Unknown Speaker  11:53
Thing that'll

Matthias Miller  11:55
let us, I mean, that'll let us do live updates the system and get it all fixed up. Well,

Unknown Speaker  12:13
um, period, subtitle,

Unknown Speaker  13:05
because we then have, theoretically, there might be some inactive ones that,

Unknown Speaker  13:13
why are there no inactive contracts? You don't really have an inactive contract. I

Matthias Miller  14:01
we paid in full, maybe even overpaid. Who knows? Say again, this is probably paid in full and or overpaid. So who knows?

Unknown Speaker  14:49
We'll be right back. I'm.

Unknown Speaker  16:22
The Johnson Jonathan's hopping on.

Unknown Speaker  16:29
Jonathan,

Speaker 3  16:31
good morning. Wait, afternoon. It's not morning, good afternoon.

Matthias Miller  16:37
It's, I don't know that's a good money or bad money, it still feels like morning.

Unknown Speaker  16:59
Was I supposed to hop on or No, I thought we were supposed to

Speaker 2  17:02
join. Yep, something's happening. Okay, cool.

Speaker 1  17:07
Just, I just walked out to the other end of my office, and there's some work going on downstairs with the restaurant, and I don't know what they're putting down there, but it's like, seriously strong smelling caulk or sealant. I was like, whoa, this will give you a headache and a heartbeat. I

Unknown Speaker  18:11
Yes,

Matthias Miller  18:13
hello, we wanted to you're starting to take a look at the other report, and those numbers are all off. And the fastest way to get this numbers nailed down would be to get our heads together and fix it so and if we have a popular system as you can make changes and we can verify numbers.

Unknown Speaker  18:32
I don't care who drives I

Speaker 4  18:42
don't know what do you what's gonna be easiest? I have a copy of the test system I could throw to you, Jonathan, like you're gonna it's gonna be fastest for you to be working? Yeah, maybe, probably, thumb drive. Give us a minute and 30 seconds again.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
So what all numbers are you seeing? The everything

Matthias Miller  19:22
I mean, the monthly payments are just completely, wildly off. Really pay off. I don't think we ever implemented, well. I mean, maybe, maybe that's been happening since the last unless there's been changes.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
No, I don't think we've, well, let's drop this bill. Working

Speaker 3  19:36
on today, I think, yeah, I have been working on early payment. I'm not sure if it is correct or not. There were a few type like, I've been kind of pushing into the numbers. And there are few things where I'm like, I'm not totally sure. Just make an assumption. Note it and ask you guys if it's quite right or not. But probably good to have this meeting. That's the

Speaker 1  19:58
entire point of this call. We want to. Get all the assumptions out on the table and make sure numbers are correct so that, well, okay, the big ones are contract value. In other words, the total, the total price of the contract. This would be monthly payments times term contract balance, EPO remaining months, making sure that payment calculations are correct, making sure CRA impact on on those payments is all correct, basically all the calculation stuff to make sure these numbers are. So that when, because we started, I started to build a a crunch, a contract search, where I want to field, I want to field all of that, that whole entire list in an entire row for a contract. And so that when you, when you look at active contracts, everything is is coming up correctly. Because right now we've got crazy negative numbers happening and all kinds of fun stuff.

Speaker 4  21:03
I think that some of the contracts have been met wildly overpaid on I think,

Matthias Miller  21:12
Well, based on our based on what I've seen, some of them are wildness calculated.

Unknown Speaker  21:18
So that's I don't doubt that.

Matthias Miller  21:21
I don't know which is where it might it's possible, but

Speaker 2  21:27
we might have to do some dummy data cleanup too, once we get this graph. I think

Speaker 4  22:02
that go invest that exe and admin equals at a doesn't have a user for You, and it gets confused. I'm

Unknown Speaker  23:39
All right, we're back, right. I really need to make a script to automate that

Unknown Speaker  23:49
almost back. How would you do this?

Unknown Speaker  24:01
Okay?

Speaker 3  24:04
So the one of the things that I think I may be approaching differently than you all is I am very period first as far as calculations, because if we start with monthly and trend, if we always start at monthly and then translate it. Periods can become very, very confusing, and so the way that I've been running it is, I say, Here's everything that we've paid on the contract, I know how much we still need to pay, and then I figure out, based off of our current payment terms, how many more periods do we have, and then how much per period? So I not really sure where to drive, as far as what numbers are incorrect. Maybe Matthias can start off by start

Unknown Speaker  24:58
with monthly subtotal. I.

Unknown Speaker  25:01
That so

Unknown Speaker  25:06
I don't think,

Matthias Miller  25:09
hang on, let's get fundamental sense. I get what you're saying is just sorry to be rude and Robin like the i

Matthias Miller  25:25
How do you get the

Unknown Speaker  25:26
contract total then?

Speaker 3  25:31
So the contract total being the and we have financing base. How is contract total?

Matthias Miller  25:41
It's like, what's this? What's the monthly payment times terms? Because you can't use the how many fees have been it seems to me like it makes more sense to have the monthly payment Calculate, calculate what the default monthly payment is times the terms, to get the baseline for the for the total. And if you need to have an adjusted you know, what is the actual monthly payment that we're making based on the contract balance?

Matthias Miller  26:17
I guess, help me understand. So monthly subtotal is what you think. What is the balance we pay? How do we calculate the contract total off of, off of this in the contract balance?

Unknown Speaker  26:27
So the contract total would be, well, when you, when you, when you sign the contract, we,

Speaker 3  26:36
we get the financing base, based off of the purchase price of the building with these, right? Like, that's how effective value comes to be. And so, well,

Matthias Miller  26:48
effective value is the, is the cash price. But we need, Oh, I see is the cash price adjusted by the the effective value adjusted by the cash price, right? Dwayne say

Unknown Speaker  27:05
that one more time,

Matthias Miller  27:08
okay, the contract total is basically effective value. I mean, it's the way we always have been thinking about it is, what is your monthly payment? What is your monthly rental times, times number of terms, because, because your contract total, if we're not going to charge you 13 cents one month and 12 cents the next, so we need to round to the nearest 36 cents. So the Homer Simpson version of this is, well, just go calculate what the monthly payment should be rounded to the nearest two cents and multiplied times the number

Unknown Speaker  27:44
of term, the number of terms. But if

Matthias Miller  27:49
you have a better way to get to that, that's fine, but we need a way to but I mean, it's effectively, it's effectively the effective value, as in, I believe, divided by cash price, but rounded in such a way that your monthly payment is always, you know.

Unknown Speaker  28:08
Okay, let's start

Speaker 1  28:10
with the first question, effective value. Is effective value the same as the purchase price or the cost of the product? Should those two numbers equal each other,

Matthias Miller  28:26
yes, except for misprints in the contract and except

Unknown Speaker  28:31
for CRA okay.

Speaker 1  28:32
So what you're saying is that the reason we're not directly importing the number the purchase amount of that building is because there are potentials that somebody screwed something up, and we have to, we have to fix something up, make sense? So then effective value is the starting number that we start from. If there is no CRA then you would divide the effective value by

Unknown Speaker  28:59
the the divisor, which would give you your monthly rent Correct, right?

Speaker 1  29:10
If there is a CRA I don't even how you explain that math, but Well,

Speaker 3  29:19
I see, I wasn't sure how the rate divisor was supposed to be used, but that, I think that makes sense to me now that the rate divisor correlates to the term length in months and so, okay, that makes sense now, is that? Is that how it works? That's correct. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Um, yes. Um, so the Okay, so I think my, one of my assumptions, had been that the that the financing base, aka effective value after CRA if at present, um. Have already accounted for cash price and rental fee, but we actually need to throw rental fee on top of that and and then that's our contract value, right?

Matthias Miller  30:15
Yes. Dwayne, how do we represent contract total for CRA? Like is that, do we sue the contract total? The reduced contract total?

Unknown Speaker  30:28
Yes, yes, the reduced contract total.

Matthias Miller  30:34
So, Jonathan, could we do a So, basically, what we want to do is add a contract total. That is the base divided by divisor, rounded to two decimals times

Unknown Speaker  30:45
terms how much, how much work did throw that on the

Speaker 3  30:54
no, that shouldn't be much work. That's pretty straightforward. I mean, it's just swapping out a few things that what I'm calculating.

Matthias Miller  31:02
So then, so then the monthly subtotal is, so

Unknown Speaker  31:09
I think it'd be on the output.

Matthias Miller  31:12
It would be, if you're calculating monthly subtotal based on, so it would be nice to show that you have contract total. So then you have contract balance, which is the total sum of what's been paid, which is the rental fees in in well, not paid.

Speaker 4  31:35
Well, it's not the total, it's rental fee in dwf, probably, but not late fees and stuff, right?

Unknown Speaker  31:45
Wait, say it again. Contract

Speaker 4  31:47
balance doesn't include late fees and such.

Speaker 1  31:52
Contract balance does not include right, or does it? Hang on, hang on. Let me think. Let me think about this. It, it?

Speaker 1  32:19
Okay. I'm going to make I'm going to make a statement, and I probably should verify this against how RTO Pro was doing that. But it makes sense in my brain to say contract balance is total contract, minus rent received plus any outstanding rent, does not include late fees. Does not include Damage Waiver fees, because both rent fees and damage waiver fees are what I call variable costs. Because you you can get rid of a you can get rid of a damage rate fee, and you can forgive a late fee. But rent is always rent.

Speaker 4  33:11
So the total contract is the subtotal times the number

Unknown Speaker  33:16
of months,

Matthias Miller  33:18
not the way Jonathan's calculating the subtotal. It's the financing base divided by the divisor rounded to two decimals times the number of terms. But Jonathan's calculating the subtotal based on the what's the contract balance divided by? What's the number of periods we have

Speaker 1  33:34
left? What do you call? What are you calling the subtotal? Calling that the contract totals? Or is that what you're is that, how you're saying that,

Speaker 4  33:43
I say the monthly subtotal would be, you multiply that by the number of months, and that's your total for the contract, then,

Speaker 3  33:56
yeah, This is in context of a specific payment. So,

Speaker 4  34:04
see, we can't have the monthly stuff that'll change you on us, though, that has to stay the same throughout the contract, unless you change,

Speaker 3  34:15
well, it would as you pay off the pay off the contract in a linear way. I mean, if we're worried about it rounding over time, up or down one penny, then we can, we could potentially calculate in such a way that it doesn't change.

Speaker 1  34:35
Okay, what is the calculation in assist for total contract.

Speaker 4  34:46
Just do you want to find it? Think it is subtotal times months? That's what I was thinking. Anyway, let me look i.

Unknown Speaker  35:08
That own. Do

Unknown Speaker  35:16
you think the least subtotal that's a CRA. Let's not do CRA.

Speaker 4  35:34
Okay, so the lease subtotal is the monthly subtotal times the length of the lease. So a monthly payment. Well, monthly subtotal is, let me share

Unknown Speaker  35:47
screen for a little bit.

Speaker 4  35:58
Monthly subtotal, 383, and then there's tax added in no damage waiver. But the lease subtotal is the 383 times the 48 months.

Speaker 1  36:09
So lease subtotal and lease cost is lease cost with sales tax,

Speaker 4  36:13
yeah, lease cost is sales tax would also have damage waivers. No.

Unknown Speaker  36:22
It would not have damage

Speaker 1  36:23
waiver, right, and it should right. So those exact RTO lease subtotal and RTO lease cost are two macros that we need to have, like those calculating macros need to be in in only as well, because there are going to be times in both, in both the whenever we get a template in contracts that we're going to have to calculate both different ways, but both ways and in the I think what I'm going to instinctively say is, maybe even like when we build contract reporting, is To give like you can check and you can say, Do you want to see your your totals with and without sales tax? Because they're like everybody kind of thinks of this number slightly bit differently depending on a lot of times it comes down to the state as to whether we whether we show it in it with sales tax or without sales tax. But what tends to happen whenever you're doing contract reporting is the individual wants to see it one way or the other, so you're gonna look at all of your stuff without sales tax. You're gonna look at all with sales tax. So both and that's the case for the lease subtotal and lease cost, but then also with balance as well. I want to be able to see the balance with sales tax and without sales tax.

Speaker 3  37:49
Yeah, I took a screenshot of the calculations from that contract, and so use that as my my guide to ironing out these calculations.

Matthias Miller  38:01
The only reason that the monthly, the the monthly payment won't change during the missing something, monthly payment won't change. But the, obviously, we switched to a weekly contract that could, that could be variable,

Speaker 1  38:18
yeah, but we're the weekly calculation is a derivative off of the monthly anyway, right? And

Matthias Miller  38:30
then the only time you record the pool, go ahead,

Speaker 3  38:33
how would that be a derivative off of it? Are we trying to ensure that they paid the same amount per month, regardless of where weeks fall or how is how's week payment.

Matthias Miller  38:47
So because of rounding, you can't directly translate. So monthly payment is just the basis of, I mean, effectively, I think another way to say it is that we look at a 36 times 4.3 whatever the term is, was 13 anyway, like 52 week, 52 times number of years term. Break it down into a an amount where, if a weekly, it will wrap up before the end of the term, something kind of like that.

Speaker 3  39:25
So, oh, so we don't do, do we? Do we do a partial week at the end? Or are we? Do you always chop up? Okay, okay, so then

Matthias Miller  39:34
if you bi weekly, you could wrap it up to three weeks before the end of the contract. Yeah.

Speaker 3  39:43
Uh, so partial week where you're, we are not paying. I, I've been thinking of it the other way, where, if you're, if there are 20 more weeks, or 20 and a half more weeks in your contract, you're going to pay 21 more times. But that last payment is going to be a much smaller one.

Matthias Miller  39:58
Yeah. No, you might be right. We talked about this

Unknown Speaker  40:04
somewhere. It's somewhere in the spec.

Matthias Miller  40:08
We have a, we have a,

Unknown Speaker  40:16
I would

Unknown Speaker  40:18
prefer

Matthias Miller  40:20
not to tackle weekly payments before the expo correct 100% we

Speaker 3  40:27
worry about it. I mean, the way I'm designing it, I think it's important not to bake in only thinking about monthly but I think it's going to be easy to design in a way that I don't worry about the others. So, okay, good.

Matthias Miller  40:47
So then monthly price becomes a fixed number for monthly subtotal. The number of months remaining is just so are you clear on how to calculate

Speaker 3  41:07
contract balance? Contract balance is the contract value minus rent paid, and that's actual paid, not just entered. Is that the amount entered towards No that wouldn't be only the cash, cash price money entered. It's the full the full payment.

Matthias Miller  41:30
But the tricky thing is, if they do an EPO, that EPO needs to be adjusted, that the EPO affects it sort of what would have been the full rental amount for the EPO

Speaker 3  41:44
isn't EPO just the original cash price, minus whatever cash portion you've paid so far.

Matthias Miller  41:56
Yes, plus late. I mean, you have to, you have to be caught up. I mean, effectively, go catch up your account, since you pay all rental fees and then pay the balance of the cash thing. But when you add Yes, exactly, it has a disproportionately large impact on the cash balance. Exactly yes,

Speaker 3  42:14
you're right. So the early payoff amount, this is something that I was wasn't quite sure about the early payoff amount that we show on the contract, that should be like, the actual chunk that you still have to pay towards the cash price plus all unpaid fees that have already been entered. Yes. So when you look at that, you're like, just pay me this much on your credit card, and then you can have it. Okay, sounds good, perfect. I like that

Matthias Miller  42:37
that should include tax on the cash price portion correct, like it is the it is, including tax, yep,

Speaker 4  42:45
give me the money. And if you're overdue on months, then those months you'd have to pay. You can't just pay the cash price on you have to pay the full amount, right? Well, on any, any rental fees that have been incurred, you have to pay the full okay. So if you're on the fifth of the month and your contract is for the 31st

Speaker 1  43:04
and for, for the sake of the expo, let's, let's, let's look at everything with sales tax. So total contract that, okay, we need it. We need, we need a name for this that we can all say the same thing. We know exactly what we're talking about. We keep coming up with different names for this. I this. I don't know. What do we call it over in assists, we call it

Speaker 4  43:28
contracts, lease subtotal and lease cost.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
I can't remember that anyway, monthly payments, times term that, that thing that, uh,

Speaker 1  43:45
let's, let's think of that in tax. Let's think of balance in tax. And let's think of with EPO in tax. We're, we're going to, there's going to be a number of macros around this that, I think after the show, we'll, we'll sort all of these out. But the ones that we need for the show, let's, let's do them with tax. So the total, the total contract value with tax, contract balance with tax, EPO with tax,

Unknown Speaker  44:15
that clear, yep,

Speaker 1  44:20
and probably the the headers that the that is, what do you call, the labels, or the headers, or whatever that when, when you do these macros, let's always like, let me say, when we call, you know, when we say, it's total contract, let's put in, always in parentheses with tax, balance parentheses with text, so that whenever we pop these into reports, we automatically that we know exactly which ones that we're dealing with doing.

Matthias Miller  44:49
Can we rename effective value to something like purchase price over purchase price or purchase price override? Or is there another term between besides effective value? You.

Speaker 1  45:05
What are we calling? What are we calling purchase? Okay, under the product section, we're calling it purchase amount. Why don't we just call it contract, purchase amount? Or no, that's that's confusing. I I don't know

Matthias Miller  45:26
product value, unless

Speaker 1  45:32
you just literally put it, made it product effective value. I know that's really, really long, but you need to be able to glance at this when I when I'm demoing this, and everybody, nobody's confused about what value they're looking at,

Speaker 1  45:56
unless, okay, here's the other way we could do this. We could say we could go and call it exactly the same as what's on the on the product, purchase amount and and turn it into rather than a field, add an override checkbox and so and import it directly from from the product with a with an override checkbox that becomes real clear as to what you're doing.

Speaker 4  46:17
Then thoughts on that, yeah, I was just gonna suggest

Unknown Speaker  46:22
I like that. I like that a lot, yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:25
okay, then the finance base in the child screen, just to be clear, RTO is not financing,

Speaker 1  46:33
yeah, I really would like to not call it financing base. I mean, if you want to call it RTO base, or,

Unknown Speaker  46:48
yeah, RTO base. I don't have a better name unless someone else does.

Matthias Miller  46:56
I mean, it's only relevant for CRA and so a i The

Matthias Miller  47:09
CRA adjusted, this is too Long. CRA adjusted, product,

Speaker 2  47:16
purchase, amount is that I? I

Speaker 3  47:27
I kind of like RTO base, super short, obviously, it's only impacted by CRA, but it's a good, good name to use as your starter.

Unknown Speaker  47:34
Macro, I'm happy brings happy. I'm

Speaker 1  47:41
going back and forth my head, whether I want to spell it out, like rent to own base. It gets a little bit, gets a little bit long there, doesn't it? Rental base, rental base. I like that. I like that. There you go. Rental base. Loan to us.

Speaker 4  47:58
So what for the future? I'm guessing we're going to want to want to add good descriptions to all these macros. Then people can go into information mode and say, Oh, that's what it's doing.

Speaker 1  48:10
So in the output section, what is cash price below that?

Speaker 3  48:13
Then cash price is the cash price percentage applied to financing, aka rental base. No, it's,

Unknown Speaker  48:27
well, this it's,

Unknown Speaker  48:29
it's double cash pricing.

Speaker 3  48:36
Yeah, because I was thinking that this included both parts of the contract. So that's probably a major source of bad numbers.

Speaker 1  48:47
Do we? We don't need that value there the financing base, okay, if cash price, if you're going to put, if you're going to put the field there, cash price needs to be the true cash price of the product, which the only difference between financing rental base and cash price would be if there's a CRA involved. So if you're asked, if you ask me if, if you're transferring values across effective value, or whatever we're calling it out there now, and cash price are the should be the same number.

Speaker 4  49:21
I think we just pull cash price from the screen.

Speaker 3  49:26
I'm fine with that. Sounds right, yeah, agreed

Speaker 3  49:42
in these places where we're saying monthly payment, should dwf be included in that? Yes, okay, I Yeah. I don't know how much of this was originally here, but I have it broken out here. You notice you can see how much of it is rental tax and dwf. But. Wasn't sure if it should be

Speaker 1  50:01
included. Okay. To confirm monthly subtotal we are saying is the rental base divided by the divisor that should give us monthly subtotal correct. And then monthly tax, that's self explanatory, monthly Damage Waiver fee that's self explanatory. Monthly payment would be the with the sum of those three total tax plus Damage Waiver fee that should give us the the monthly payment and security deposit. That's self explanatory, cash due. Self explanatory, which would be cash due would be, I mean, right now I don't know what, why those two numbers,

Speaker 4  50:47
cash do is similar to how RTO or how zfe Does it inside, wow, I can't words, yeah, which is just the initial cash do.

Speaker 1  50:59
So, so, yeah, so let's name. Let's name instead of cash to let's call it initial payment, which would be any security deposit plus monthly payment.

Unknown Speaker  51:13
Well, security deposit or CRA

Speaker 1  51:17
Right, correct. Now, the only caveat to that in we haven't really got into this is when we ever get into this thing of one of the things that we have in, okay, I'm not even going to bring this up at the moment. That is what the number is. Just note stick in the back of your brain when we get into larger value buildings and where we're we're not, we're not thinking about them as percentages, or we're not thinking about them as monthly payments a percentage down. We have this on the contract definition where we're going to require certain things, but we for this for this time around the bush, we don't need to think about it if cash do is security deposit or CRA plus monthly payment.

Unknown Speaker  52:00
Johnson, are you getting notes of these

Unknown Speaker  52:11
things? Are there other things we should be digging into now?

Matthias Miller  52:19
So then we are clear that the remaining months is the contract balance divided by monthly payment amount,

Unknown Speaker  52:33
right? Yeah, okay, so you mean remaining, uh, remaining balance. Well,

Matthias Miller  52:45
the number the remaining months is simply contract balance divided by monthly payment amount,

Unknown Speaker  52:51
rounded rounded to a whole number,

Matthias Miller  52:55
rounded to rounded up, rounded to a whole number.

Speaker 1  53:00
No, let's, let's do it. No, no, that's fair. I think this is actually in the in the nature of transparency. I kind of like this. Let's run it to do decimal, two decimal points, so if you have 12.25 months left, bingo. I like that.

Speaker 4  53:18
That which that would only matter if they've been partially paying,

Unknown Speaker  53:23
sure, right? Sure.

Speaker 1  53:25
But, I mean, I like that. I think that's, I think that's actually, rather than rounding up and saying, If I have 12 point, you know, two five, rather than rounding down to 12, or if I have 12.6 rather rounding up to 13. Let's just, let's just give you the number. Let's give you the exact number. I like that.

Unknown Speaker  53:49
And what is

Speaker 1  53:52
okay right now, we are concatenating some text on remaining months to to we're getting a number of 19 parentheses, 20 monthly payments. What's, what's the story?

Speaker 3  54:08
Story is, um, it's applicable. It makes sense with non monthly terms, but I can remove it for now, yeah, if you, if you, if you buy, if you have bi weekly payments or something, and it's like 18 months left, then it's helpful to see how many payments you still have. But yeah,

Speaker 1  54:30
we, once we get into that, that support, we can, we can have that conversation for the for the show. Let's just, let's, let's reflect it in in decimal, two decimal points. Okay.

Speaker 1  55:01
So Matthias, then, in regards to if we sort all of this out, the next step would be to come back around and make sure that we clean up any overpaid stuff so that we don't have crazy, wild negative numbers happening.

Matthias Miller  55:14
That's correct. All right.

Unknown Speaker  55:18
Are we missing anything? Do

Unknown Speaker  55:23
I don't know.

Speaker 4  55:31
Circling back to the whole balancing again, you said that includes any like late fees and stuff that are currently due, right or not, is it not? You

Speaker 1  55:46
had to go and ask again. Now you have me second guess. Okay, hold on, I want to get Leanne's opinion on this. I'll be right

Speaker 4  56:01
back. That throws off the number of months remaining, potentially Well, minutely, but

Matthias Miller  56:10
number of months remaining, though, should be calculated based off of it, without

Speaker 4  56:14
latent fees, right? But then on the Sure,

Matthias Miller  56:17
EPO needs to include late fees, etc,

Speaker 4  56:21
right? But so does contract balance not show fees then? So there's a difference between

Unknown Speaker  56:30
or do we need to have an amount currently due? Macro says, As of today, what do you owe, right? Which is the sum of any unpaid rows Well, and that's where contract

Matthias Miller  56:45
balance is a little bit of a confusing term, but you might want a current balance and pass the balance, or you might even want it broken down into 36 and 90

Speaker 1  56:53
when representing balance. And this is, this is mainly for the comp, the question for the show, because we're going to have a number of different ways that we're going to be able to represent this when we get to the finished product. Contract balance is, does it include Damage Waiver fee and any outstanding late fees? So no damage waiver fee. What about late fees? Well, you can include that. You can include damage by your fee, minus one.

Speaker 5  57:23
In some states, I think we just exclude them,

Speaker 1  57:27
so let's exclude damage by your fee. Yeah. What about any outstanding late fees? Fees?

Speaker 5  57:31
100% there are some states that do not allow us to mandatorily demand that we collect them throughout the term of the contract, and we can only demand them at the final closure. And there are other states that don't say so that is 100 late fees must be taken care of so to close out the account because they are owed,

Speaker 1  57:51
no late fees, yes, all late fees. Sorry, no damage waiver fee Correct. Include late fees outstanding, any unpaid late fees,

Speaker 5  58:01
and also include taxes on any CRA s, that's very important.

Speaker 1  58:08
Okay, we didn't even get into the so does when, when we represent the contract balance. The CRA wouldn't be represented in with the contract balance. Yeah.

Speaker 5  58:23
So this always gets a little bit tricky inside of RTO Pro, because they the way theirs runs is not exactly ideal when it comes to a customer understanding it, because if you're holding $3,000 every year, you didn't collect tax on that. You only collect it at the time that you spend it on an item, right? It's just a deposit. And so you're going to pay tax on that 3000 now, whatever tax rate that is, but the contract is looking at it saying the contract was written on this less, whatever you put down, sure. So it doesn't want to say what that like. It doesn't automatically say the tax. And so if you have a significant CRA, you could have a couple $100

Speaker 1  59:04
so so this number right here in this report, the contract balance, are you saying you would want the remaining months of rent, plus tax, late fees plus tax. And if there's a CRA on the account, it's tax correct, not that, not the CRA amount, just the tax that we would charge on that. Are you tracking with that?

Unknown Speaker  59:30
Jonathan, yeah, yeah, that makes

Speaker 5  59:34
sense now, clearly RTO pro never figured out how to do that, so we could be stuck in the same scenario we are now where we have to, you know, tell the customer, no, I'm sorry, you still have to pay taxes. But it's easier if you can figure it all into one place.

Speaker 3  59:51
But you're saying that when they pay into the CRA initially, they are sort of already cashing the tax at that point or when they or if they do. An early payoff, and they were using the CRA, early payoff might increase a little bit, because they're gonna have to pay tax on the CRA at that point, correct?

Speaker 5  1:00:08
And so a lot of times that can be two or $300 more than a person expects if they've got a couple 1000.

Speaker 1  1:00:13
Okay, so then that brings up the question of the EPO. Should the EPO include, if there's a CRA on the account. Should the EPO include its tax as well? It's the CRA is tax as well. That's what we just said. We were talking about, contract balance. Do you want to are both contract balance and and EPO? Should it represent the amount of tax that we're going to charge on the CRA at the time of spend?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
I think, for the customer's sake, that is the most straightforward.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
Does that make sense? Are you tracking?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
Jonathan, surprisingly, yes.

Speaker 1  1:00:50
Okay, so just, I'm going to reiterate this one more time so that I don't so whether we're all on the same page contract balance, remaining rent, plus any outstanding rent, sorry, no, sorry remaining rent, plus late fees and the sorry remaining rent, and it's tax, late fees and it's tax, and the tax from the CRA that you will that will be incurred at the point of spend. And the same thing with EPO, your EPO calculations, plus the tax that you will incur at the point of spend on the CRA

Speaker 5  1:01:29
now, just to complicate things a little bit, is there leeway if we have a state who decides that everything must be shown pre tax?

Speaker 1  1:01:41
Well, for the, for the, for the sake of this conversation, we're talking about just the show. At the point after the show, we're going to get into some some variables in that regard that we're going to have to represent correctly. Okay, because

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
we can get into all kinds of fun state

Speaker 1  1:02:00
scenarios. Well, there will, yes, we're going to have to handle some of that and represent them correctly, but for the sake of the show, we're just going to represent everything with tax, fair enough.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
Good, soft,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:12
all right. Thank you. You can shut the door.

Speaker 1  1:02:21
Don't you love when, when someone says, Yeah, RTO pro never could get this one figured out. And so, oh yeah, that's the fun part.

Speaker 4  1:02:28
This is where we make ourselves valuable. This is where one of the

Speaker 1  1:02:33
places money right here is making sure it's correct. And the best thing. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at a client and some and somebody's gonna say, but this is not right, and I get to say, Okay, we'll go fix it. It's great. You don't have to call Ron Gannon and listen to him whine about going and fixing something and never doing it. For the next 10 months, we're gonna fix stuff. Maybe it's gonna be right. I say that now when I've got 150 con clients, and then I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
gonna be like, sorry, rabbit trail. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:13
All right, I've got plenty to work on.

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
Do you have ballpark? ETA, when, when I can look at numbers again? I mean,

Speaker 3  1:03:29
I should have a lot of this done by the end of the day. It's if we're only thinking of monthly at this point. It's pretty straightforward. I think Cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:50
Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:03:53
Thanks, guys. Oh, they're gone.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:00
All right,

Speaker 1  1:04:13
my mind was spinning as we're talking through that and realizing that we're going to have for each one of these calculations, we're going to have about three or four different macros in order to represent some of this stuff all the correct way every single time.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
so is the nature.

Matthias Miller  1:04:33
Who is the nature?

Speaker 1  1:04:38
This is, this is really, really important to have right because I plan to, I plan to sit, sit down with JMAG key people and be like, you want correct numbers. You want the right numbers. You want to be able to go to the bank. Here they are. You don't like. These. Okay, we'll drop in these other ones, which, what do you want to see? Like, you just tell me what you want to see in this report, and I can have it to you in five minutes for the most part, exactly. And if I can't have it in five minutes, I'll reach out to Matthias, and he can have it to me by the end of the day, exactly. And it's like, it and it's like, if we don't have macros in the system, fine, we'll make user macros. We can fix this stuff like, we like you would never go to the bank without, you know, the right stuff anyway. Rant over.

Matthias Miller  1:05:41
All right, so you

Speaker 1  1:05:42
want to go back around to doing past your dashboard now that we nailed that down, Yep, let's do past you dashboard actually, actually. Let's not. Let's not do that just yet. Let's, let's see here is there pull up any contract? I don't care which, and let's just kind of comb through,

Speaker 1  1:06:11
just to clarify this, I think I know the answer to this, but the primary tags are importing from the customer, correct?

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
That is correct, right? So we are not, okay, perfect. We do not have contract tags at

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
this point. That's fine. I think that's fine. We do have building tags, though,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:31
right, which we're not showing.

Speaker 1  1:06:34
Do we want to import building tags to the product section of the contract? I think we do,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
what's your thought? I mean, I

Matthias Miller  1:06:49
think it probably makes sense. I

Speaker 1  1:07:04
that I don't think we need. It's not something we need for the show. I think we just make, make a note of it some at some point in the spec that we need to throw that in there have those import I don't, I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for the show wise. Do you?

Matthias Miller  1:07:19
I don't know it does,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
yeah, agreed.

Speaker 1  1:07:34
Dude, I'm not kidding you. Do you know how many times recently I have been working in assist and I'm like, I just want to go make a note that I can assign to myself and put a follow up date on it. Do you know how many times I've wished for this?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:52
Yep,

Speaker 1  1:07:53
I have been. I have been slogging through fixing historical retrieval buildings, making sure there's retrieval buildings for all this, reconnecting up sales orders to their original buildings. And I'm like, I just want to go leave myself a note to follow up on this. It's like, and I just, there's nothing, there's no there's nothing. Makes me sad. You need to convince mark to put this this note system over in, in, in, assist, uh, scroll down on this record attachments, does the upload attachments work?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
No, okay,

Speaker 1  1:08:31
no big deal. Can we fake something in there that makes it look like there's no, I guess not. That wouldn't make any sense.

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
I mean, we could, but can?

Speaker 1  1:08:46
Is it possible to to to fake a something out to a Google Drive folder of something, something, just so that we have something to show? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

Matthias Miller  1:09:00
Not just dropped it simply, nah, nah, don't worry about it.

Speaker 1  1:09:03
Um, jump. Okay, so the take a payment thing is now here on the contract record. Hallelujah, that was gonna be one of the things I was going to ask for. And it auto imports the customer. Hallelujah, bingo. That makes me happy. Back to the contract record. Um, okay, let's jump over to the contact record.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32
Here is, here is a question I have in regards to, I

Speaker 1  1:09:46
uh, if you were to change the name of the customer, will it decouple the contract, or is the contract link? Okay, perfect. That's linked, that's linked to the contract. I. D on the on the contract, RG, where's How is it linked?

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
I mean, it's under the hood. I mean, under the hood, the database uses the ID, the uses

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
the record ID.

Matthias Miller  1:10:10
This guy minus 553, got it.

Speaker 1  1:10:13
Okay, perfect. That's what. That's one of the things that PD has brought up many, many times, every time, every time I have this conversation about him, because he went screwing around in the RTO pro database and decoupled some things by accident, and anyway, it caused

Matthias Miller  1:10:28
kind of his fault, but

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
Well, yes, changing

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
things in the database without understanding understood,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:40
what does it take to turn the phone number into the phone number link,

Matthias Miller  1:10:51
no as another column,

Speaker 1  1:10:59
No, usually when you're in like, I thought we did this, I don't know. Okay, one of the things I want to I want to push, and I have to go build some reporting around it in order to because after talking with PD at lunch, he started asking if we can treat this like a CRM, and 100% you can treat this like a CRM. And I want to make people believe that you can link out to a phone system based on the phone number. So having that be some kind of linked URL

Matthias Miller  1:11:27
or, okay, so this you can't edit and have it be a link URL. That's the only thing I'm saying. So we can have a little MRG thing that pops up underneath it with the link to call you can have a call column.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
Have a call column. Call column is great. Do

Matthias Miller  1:11:44
you want this pre Expo?

Speaker 1  1:11:46
If possible, it would be, it would be something that would be really nice little feature that people would see you as we're as we're demoing, that you could just click and call, and then they're going to ask questions like, can that be hooked up? Yes, that be hooked up? Yes, that can be hooked up to your phone system? Yes, yes, yes. It just, it's a nice little, nice little thing.

Speaker 1  1:12:16
Actually, actually, let's do this. Let's I don't know what I'm asking for, how hard it I don't know if it's one of those things where you, you click a button and voila, the columns there, and it's, or is it? Does it take, like, 30 minutes to if it, if it takes any amount of time to do it, let's, let's kick it down the street. If it's super easy, then let's throw it in there.

Matthias Miller  1:12:38
I mean, it's, I don't know 15 minutes of Seth's time. I don't know what it takes The other guys, but

Matthias Miller  1:12:50
assuming

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
I'm truly, we've got something in the I don't know I'm about To fall into a rabbit trail. We have stuff in the

Unknown Speaker  1:13:44
I know we have it here in assist. I

Matthias Miller  1:13:48
don't remember where it would be, though.

Speaker 1  1:14:13
I thought transit tasks did it, or maybe it's only for i

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
Yeah, transit tests are linked As a URL. They're

Matthias Miller  1:14:35
not formatted properly, but sure, I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
All right. Jump to the product. This all looks good.

Speaker 1  1:15:03
Yeah, I've already looked across all this, this all are we going to have? Will the rent collected, dwf collected, late fees collected? Are those going to be live by the demo time? Or are they not?

Matthias Miller  1:15:19
I don't know. Up. I think it's up to us.

Speaker 1  1:15:24
Probably. If we get these calculations correct, it should be pretty straightforward, shouldn't it? Yeah, well, if we can get it in there, that'd be awesome. I

Speaker 2  1:16:01
I'm by the way,

Speaker 1  1:16:06
okay, here's, here's what I would love for you to just give me a good, fast tutorial on everything else that's in accounting, when menu that we haven't really ever talked about I've played around with budgets. What else is here that I should really know about, that somebody may ask me about, that I should be able to explain?

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
Well, they're going to likely ask you for things like,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:34
okay, trial, balance.

Matthias Miller  1:16:36
You probably want to ask for your transaction search or counting somebody by context, maybe reconcile. We have bank reconciliation, um ability to close in line periods. We do have some Bill handling this has gotten almost no attention.

Speaker 2  1:17:02
Um, but

Matthias Miller  1:17:07
we do have it, they're very likely, likely to ask about things like rendered invoices or POS or other things like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:16
We're not currently doing any kind of POS. Vendor invoice would be

Matthias Miller  1:17:25
a bill, right? A bill. And I have honestly not used this that much, and I don't know how well it works.

Speaker 1  1:17:43
Yeah, I think it's fine. I think that this is the very high level stuff is is going through like a balance sheet and an income statement. And I did figure out, obviously you've made some changes to the income statement on inside of only versus what you're having assist. Because I don't think the one in assist has the break it out by show amounts by month.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
I think you

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
have to do it, don't you have to do it from like,

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
yeah, because they have some bizarre, customized income statement, which is why

Speaker 1  1:18:28
gotcha, you have it. You have it as part of a tool tip or something on the on the menu,

Matthias Miller  1:18:34
right, you can, you can go, be the standard one analysis, yes, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40
Version Gotcha.

Matthias Miller  1:18:47
Do you care about this? Ask my account content, amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:50
what is it?

Matthias Miller  1:18:59
We have accounts payable. Manufacturer premium.

Speaker 1  1:19:11
So these are calculated premiums that happened, apparently that We should they should be assigned to the proper account.

Matthias Miller  1:19:40
I don't think we have anything for that right now. Do we?

Speaker 1  1:19:50
Obviously not. Where would it fit? We have commissions.

Speaker 1  1:20:15
Where was the commissions you had? You had a commissions here in a second ago. So why wouldn't we make it. I mean, it's, it should be right, right there. What 6165 or or something like that.

Matthias Miller  1:20:27
Or these are mostly, theoretically, I don't know how they decide what order. These are mostly alphabetical, oh,

Speaker 2  1:20:42
oh. Just

Speaker 1  1:20:48
make an account for manufacturer premiums, and let's just, let's get that stuff in there.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:00
Is there a 6150 there were

Matthias Miller  1:21:10
sorry, 6150 you said, I

Speaker 1  1:21:12
don't know. Is there a 6150 No, I would say 60. Wouldn't that make sense? Right above which number wise, right above uh commissions, again, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:24
sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:36
Better. Bing,

Matthias Miller  1:22:33
Do we have any other fees? Do

Matthias Miller  1:22:57
A Damage Waiver, rental fee, security deposit,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
early pay I've incurred.

Matthias Miller  1:23:10
You don't have the RE installation fee. Yes, we do have repossession, redelivery, delivery processing fee.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:24
Be able to those

Matthias Miller  1:23:27
payments are so dropped and simple that I don't think we have anything in there. I I

Matthias Miller  1:24:21
think that's a little fishy. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:35
negative premiums looks a little fishy.

Speaker 1  1:24:44
But is some of this? Yeah, accounts, it's

Matthias Miller  1:24:54
okay. The expense should be a

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
