Unknown Speaker  00:43
Good morning. Good morning. Well the

Unknown Speaker  01:05
kind of impact is blank. It says

Unknown Speaker  01:09
blank seems a little

Unknown Speaker  01:15
less than ideal.

Unknown Speaker  01:17
Oh, I know why the

Unknown Speaker  01:18
subset is blank. Yeah.

Speaker 1  01:21
No,

Speaker 2  01:30
the subset is yes, yes and yes. So let's just see if let's go pick A building. Um,

Unknown Speaker  01:45
status is voided. Let's do I'm

Speaker 2  02:08
um, that's weird, right? Because it didn't have anything. It's not tied to an account.

Speaker 2  02:31
Let's just try random one of these and see if, there we go. Okay, this one used to have one. Okay, okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:55
If we have a growth date, right, look up Johnson.

Unknown Speaker  03:09
Are we needing replace an AOT amount? Just think there's no

Speaker 2  03:17
there's no actual cost. It's no actual cost did I not

Unknown Speaker  03:22
handle it correctly? Sir? No.

Unknown Speaker  03:41
Here.

Unknown Speaker  03:50
This is not returning anything.

Unknown Speaker  04:00
It's not the list filter,

Speaker 3  04:09
switch if you use extra cost for building built back to was it false? Just see that. I don't remember if I tested when I switched it back on that One, but that shouldn't do all the other ones. Yeah.

Speaker 2  04:59
A drink. Members, true, false, true, use actual cost, invoice and partials. Okay. Are we sure that

Unknown Speaker  05:20
I show let's

Unknown Speaker  05:31
do it on the first one, and let's just go grab this guy,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
throw it here.

Unknown Speaker  05:50
That a Mac thing that you can

Speaker 2  05:55
No, it's an alt. The alt shortcut works in here. It does work in special, okay, okay, so let's do, is

Speaker 3  06:17
there any chance this is my the double coded account, impact, refactor stuff,

Speaker 3  06:29
fusions that I thought I had been looking at this in my local system was getting stuff, but,

Unknown Speaker  06:41
yeah, we're passing district, and instead of the accounting company, you should be using,

Speaker 2  06:54
oh, because I Right, you should be using this guy, this guy, yeah, yeah, oh, that's a dumb stuff mistake. Oh, well,

Speaker 3  07:12
I guess we can build them a user one and run that.

Unknown Speaker  07:15
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  07:20
update it here, and then building a,

Unknown Speaker  07:29
yeah, building a user report.

Unknown Speaker  07:36
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  07:38
so it's, we think it's just this one thing, right?

Speaker 1  07:42
Well, I mean, if you do that here,

Unknown Speaker  07:52
I mean, I would see, let's do this. Let's remove the draft. I mean, it's very easy to test.

Unknown Speaker  08:05
Uh, expand expression,

Unknown Speaker  08:11
almost easier

Unknown Speaker  08:21
to do this.

Unknown Speaker  08:38
Let's do another local macro.

Unknown Speaker  08:56
Like, so this isn't no it's not that easy. I think you should just make a change, expand the macro and just see, but

Speaker 2  09:09
that is a glaring issue that seems likely to be

Unknown Speaker  09:18
okay. Yeah,

Speaker 3  09:23
I just need to create the report, export it. Or do I create the report? Export, import,

Unknown Speaker  09:34
yeah. We're just,

Speaker 2  09:40
let me just go ahead and change this one to use. Use the this user until we get it fixed. Yeah, fixed. Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Thank you. You bet Thanks. Bye.
