Speaker 1  00:50
Good afternoon Good afternoon Good afternoon

Unknown Speaker  01:03
right

Unknown Speaker  01:16
but

Speaker 2  01:17
something one here about GTK but maybe it didn't get added to the

Speaker 1  01:24
to the CSS call page

Speaker 1  01:39
quickly there were quite a few things

Speaker 2  01:47
were about a few things before we dive into Sindbis alright so the first one would

Unknown Speaker  01:58
be

Unknown Speaker  02:01
z TK auto created incidents

Speaker 1  02:09
so here this here

Unknown Speaker  02:20
let's see screensharing overturn on this

Unknown Speaker  02:40
so

Speaker 2  02:42
this one was one that had come in to the client and I think it was when you were swamped with emails there

Unknown Speaker  02:51
so just checking in to see what what thoughts you have on this so we've got an even working on inbound email stuff we're insight

Speaker 2  03:05
Do we have anything and so you had also been setting up some stuff for yourself and project management side and go like maybe that created incidents from text message or email coming in?

Matthias Miller  03:20
Text Message email is mean what happens when somebody replies to an email

Unknown Speaker  03:33
new asking

Speaker 2  03:35
he was asking here basically what like what our current capabilities are. I mean,

Matthias Miller  03:40
we have we have email integration

Unknown Speaker  03:46
we could I don't think it would be here here's what it takes to add actually there is a

Unknown Speaker  04:02
conversation

Unknown Speaker  04:11
he said that exists

Speaker 2  04:12
there he doesn't want to reinvent the wheel does we have an inbox for emails for managing printer support goes if we could use the subject as a title and use your body as the body of a default type that gets used and then have an email alert that gets sent to whoever monitors so that's that's what he's had in mind at this point. But he was wanting to see what we have

Unknown Speaker  04:40
existing and we have

Matthias Miller  04:43
not specifically built that out but it's not all that different difficult to. to do. And so basically here is

Unknown Speaker  04:58
well I say not that technical difficult

Unknown Speaker  05:07
should be dev specs

Unknown Speaker  05:25
standard email 30

Unknown Speaker  05:40
Oops I

Unknown Speaker  05:47
think I lost something.

Unknown Speaker  08:36
wonder if we could do

Speaker 1  09:20
I mean there you go there it is in a nutshell

Unknown Speaker  09:54
so this would simply be

Speaker 2  09:55
the what he was asking for as far as creating the incident and then we can Set up a set the the alert which we'd actually already been doing this of course wouldn't provide any of the outbound email like replying to the incident whatnot that's not what he was asking

Unknown Speaker  10:16
for us that

Speaker 2  10:18
that looks like a good start. So basically in short

Unknown Speaker  10:23
we don't have that

Unknown Speaker  10:28
we don't have it as a plug and play feature right now but

Speaker 1  10:33
it's not it's not $10,000 to add it correct Okay, sounds good

Matthias Miller  10:50
and it seems like we kind of I mean, if we implement this here we're gonna have to work through implementing multiple types of emails in the system

Unknown Speaker  11:04
or maybe talk to Josh

Matthias Miller  11:09
in wanting to do this anyway talk to Josh whether there'd be a way to

Speaker 1  11:16
identify the account perhaps from which it's coming. So we could resist ch

Unknown Speaker  11:31
but it doesn't matter I mean, it doesn't matter for them

Unknown Speaker  11:41
okay

Unknown Speaker  12:10
okay, then that sounds good there

Unknown Speaker  12:16
and then there was also

Unknown Speaker  12:25
this

Speaker 2  12:36
this email notifications I sent this one over and then you give a summary and ask was anything else? So, I have a couple other questions here for the questions

Unknown Speaker  12:50
Is there a name for this feature something that we call to call it

Matthias Miller  12:58
what's the setting that turns it on?

Matthias Miller  13:21
It's under no it's not under triggers it's under

Unknown Speaker  13:24
it's a scheduled task right. It didn't change requirements email incident wiki tracking

Speaker 1  13:38
tracking notification incident tracking notification

Matthias Miller  13:42
incident wiki tracking notification I think

Unknown Speaker  13:50
yeah

Unknown Speaker  13:57
like it and

Speaker 2  14:02
am I right in and remembering it the wording in the email is the same whether it's a new incident assigned to us or

Unknown Speaker  14:11
wherever no

Unknown Speaker  14:18
and any thoughts on how much we would charge to add

Unknown Speaker  14:21
it as is?

Matthias Miller  14:24
Let's question for ls this is who's this Z TK

Unknown Speaker  14:29
yeah

Unknown Speaker  14:40
generally requires this is not the internet check.

Speaker 1  14:49
Does that's question for Ellis. Okay, no, let me just Wait Where is that check one thing your first

Unknown Speaker  15:18
track indication

Unknown Speaker  15:39
that's right we have the tracking notification IDs guy

Unknown Speaker  15:55
come on

Unknown Speaker  16:02
now

Speaker 1  16:18
yeah it is something that we have to it's in the app posting tracking log okay question for him okay

Matthias Miller  16:30
we would need to I mean the two things that are required are adding it to their catalog and adding a scheduled task after update and then whether Ellis wants to charge any maintenance

Unknown Speaker  16:52
say adding it to the catalog and adding

Matthias Miller  17:01
adding the scheduled task after update

Unknown Speaker  17:09
okay

Unknown Speaker  17:31
okay excellent

Unknown Speaker  17:48
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  17:49
I think

Unknown Speaker  17:53
that should take care of that for now and

Unknown Speaker  18:12
yeah, anything else?

Speaker 2  18:14
I don't think we discuss these right now with Simba as being the higher priority

Speaker 1  18:19
anything else from a review on different things

Speaker 2  18:27
like on any other projects or anything that we should discuss your CSS side of things?

Unknown Speaker  18:33
Oh, ah

Matthias Miller  18:37
Can I tell you guys about Paul Nielsen

Unknown Speaker  18:41
so no

Unknown Speaker  19:05
the sky

Matthias Miller  19:08
so SQL Server is Microsoft's

Unknown Speaker  19:15
database database platform. And he's written all these books.

Matthias Miller  19:25
And a friend of mine split me up for lunch with him on Friday. Oh, wow.

Speaker 1  19:39
That's really cool. Yeah, nice. So is he

Speaker 2  19:50
database design and SQL development expert.

Unknown Speaker  19:59
Why No

Matthias Miller  20:00
So what questions do you want me to ask him and I need to spend some time thinking about what questions I'm gonna ask him because maybe we don't have to ask all the questions right at first but this can be a fantastic relationship if we can

Unknown Speaker  20:16
if it can continue hmm

Unknown Speaker  20:26
wow interesting

Speaker 2  20:42
it can be interesting to hear how he thinks about data modeling and how and designing a database

Unknown Speaker  20:58
mistakes he's made and learn from

Unknown Speaker  21:03
things that

Unknown Speaker  21:06
don't know I mean those are just like high level and open ended

Unknown Speaker  21:11
questions

Speaker 2  21:18
you've got lunch so it's an hour and a half or something probably so it's not like you can

Unknown Speaker  21:28
get a ton of

Unknown Speaker  21:29
information huh

Unknown Speaker  21:39
What do you say he's

Speaker 2  21:41
author and presenter of smart database design seminar

Unknown Speaker  22:02
collaborative work style

Speaker 2  22:12
with ice here's a place for new you to think up a new tool basically a knowledge distillery

Unknown Speaker  22:20
where you can like hook somebody up and

Speaker 2  22:26
like or not hook somebody up but like ask a list of questions that

Speaker 1  22:32
an hour and a half distills his 35 years worth of of knowledge and experience into

Unknown Speaker  22:48
something well enter the

Matthias Miller  22:51
8020 expert podcast so imagine that you had you you could talk to top leaders in various various aspects you have a series of questions that are all

Unknown Speaker  23:05
targeted towards the

Matthias Miller  23:09
mid 20s of their successes and failures

Unknown Speaker  23:28
yeah Wow I'll

Unknown Speaker  23:32
have specific ideas

Unknown Speaker  23:37
right can send your way

Speaker 2  23:45
that looks fantastic and opportunity. Ellis might have some stuff too

Unknown Speaker  23:54
that's a good point

Speaker 1  24:07
Yeah, so your your friend knows him or her strings Yeah. knows him from prison. Oh all right.

Matthias Miller  24:26
My friend is a chaplain and I am assuming policy volunteer

Unknown Speaker  24:39
got it?

Unknown Speaker  24:49
Cool.

Speaker 1  24:55
Good. That's all I got. Okay.

Matthias Miller  25:00
So yeah, when I'm not answering simple questions I'm going and finding books like that. Still random after church one Sunday, whenever our kids were playing, like, my son was playing with a box fan up beside, or whatever, and this other gentleman was over there. And we've never I mean, we talked very occasionally briefly, but don't really talk too much. went over and started chatting with him. And he's like, yeah, here's this guy who talks about this SQL stuff. And every time we talk to him, I'm thinking you would probably make more sense. This would make more sense you that this to me, and you guys should meet me for lunch. I'm like, Sure. And he's like, his name is Paul Nielsen.

Unknown Speaker  25:43
I'm like, that name. sounds

Matthias Miller  25:45
vaguely familiar. I don't know it really well. And when I went home and looked him up, and I'm like, Yeah, how about you set us up for lunch sometime? That would be amazing. Pretty cool. loose, loose links. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:04
Degrees of Separation.

Unknown Speaker  26:09
All right. So Sindbis, time tracking

Unknown Speaker  26:16
7721.

Unknown Speaker  26:25
And a few questions for you.

Unknown Speaker  26:34
First off,

Unknown Speaker  26:36
W had sent her an email, I think yesterday about

Unknown Speaker  26:41
about budgeting.

Speaker 2  26:44
They were trying to put together a rough estimate about our budget for the next 90 days, and then also through December of this year. So wondering, what are the projected investments in the software project from now to July 15? And then from July 16, to December 31.

Speaker 1  27:05
So they have the the estimates from the Yeah, the estimates

Unknown Speaker  27:15
that we sent them with the ILO ILO design.

Unknown Speaker  27:19
But

Speaker 2  27:23
yeah, with the breaking things into phases and whatnot, think they just want to have a rough, rough number. They're not. It says rough estimate answer.

Matthias Miller  27:36
Do we have an estimate of what percentage is phase one? What percentage is phase two? What percentage is phase three?

Unknown Speaker  27:43
Etc cetera. Not

Speaker 2  27:48
direct. I mean, we've got it broken out here somewhat. We don't have phase three, quite specked out. But like here, phase one is? Oh, it's probably 90% of the records and reports. But then phase two is heavy on the more complicated records and interactions, notifications and whatnot.

Matthias Miller  28:25
Any templates in phase one versus phase two or three templates has.

Speaker 2  28:32
Phase one has a very simple template that doesn't need a field filling PDF, and then also another one that would be printed.

Unknown Speaker  28:44
either empty or filled.

Speaker 2  28:48
Just those two templates. And then somewhere in phase two, and three would be two more templates

Unknown Speaker  28:55
that are

Speaker 2  28:59
as of yet undesigned, but probably not super complicated. Phase one has integration with

Unknown Speaker  29:12
s3, possibly Salesforce,

Speaker 2  29:15
but hopefully not. And then phase two, three would have possible integration with QuickBooks. You double check with him where he's at with with Twilio, whether that's something they want,

Unknown Speaker  29:30
or not. So making up numbers, I don't know if this is accurate or not, but

Matthias Miller  29:40
70 to 90% and

Unknown Speaker  29:42
phase one,

Matthias Miller  29:45
five to 15 and phase two, five to 15 and phase three. And these are made up numbers and subject to change but that's kind of where we see things I mean that's without Going deep

Unknown Speaker  30:02
deep into it I think

Unknown Speaker  30:14
yeah

Speaker 1  30:23
so one two it's three

Unknown Speaker  30:50
and

Unknown Speaker  30:57
this would presumably be in

Unknown Speaker  31:00
to be by July and then this would be the rest of the year

Unknown Speaker  31:16
are

Unknown Speaker  31:25
you my guess is it's

Unknown Speaker  31:40
this might actually this is actually probably more than

Speaker 1  31:42
definitely more than 10% 30% Sounds right

Speaker 2  31:51
so maybe this should be we could do 7080 or 60 to 80 to 80%

Speaker 1  31:59
and then 10 to 2020

Unknown Speaker  32:15
Sure it's fun

Unknown Speaker  32:25
those that as probably semi reasonable

Unknown Speaker  32:38
okay

Speaker 1  33:03
well and then let's see even with this phase one half of it would be due in July I mean

Speaker 2  33:13
who would you do by then for development to start

Unknown Speaker  33:24
and then other half

Unknown Speaker  33:26
will be doing deployment

Unknown Speaker  33:36
that's true

Matthias Miller  33:38
so now to July 15 It would be

Matthias Miller  33:48
if you wanted to break it down you could say 63 to 40% down payment or do to start face and then

Unknown Speaker  34:05
yeah

Unknown Speaker  34:32
okay, well that goes gives us something to work with here

Speaker 2  34:45
Okay, thank you. I'm looking at menus.

Unknown Speaker  34:53
Actually, first, let's look

Speaker 2  34:54
at the user groups and permissions you tend to ask CCI to investigate using candidate record to lock down the Edit ability of user profiles and user groups. Did you see Alice's reply to that

Unknown Speaker  35:11
did not okay

Unknown Speaker  35:21
he says

Speaker 2  35:25
he says Canada record on the user profile strikes me as concerning since we've forgotten to programmatically edit it in various ways such as logging in if required fields aren't specified when is best seen when setting last logon date when modifying favorites and he asked what the business use case was so I replied to him on that and gave a summary but you might not actually be

Unknown Speaker  35:53
are you on the high level design

Unknown Speaker  36:01
I'm getting blasted

Matthias Miller  36:01
with all kinds of emails and so

Unknown Speaker  36:05
users can edit Yes I am.

Matthias Miller  36:08
Okay, so I mean I think we should go back and probably the simplest thing is to say

Unknown Speaker  36:31
oh thank you

Unknown Speaker  37:00
he's a profile

Unknown Speaker  37:58
Were you waiting for anything else from here? No.

Matthias Miller  38:01
I mean I think I'm just getting a few things in mind I think

Matthias Miller  38:12
why would somebody why would a facility let's see

Unknown Speaker  38:15
what would a regional rep

Unknown Speaker  38:23
I think we just tell him we can't

Unknown Speaker  38:32
and just have the

Unknown Speaker  38:34
this allow the regional reps to to edit

Unknown Speaker  38:36
all yep

Unknown Speaker  38:44
okay

Unknown Speaker  38:52
so

Unknown Speaker  39:12
all right

Speaker 2  39:17
so then on the same topic of permissions and data access and whatnot for menus we were talking about having three menus for now Home Menu Super Admin Menu and advanced menu looks like we had noted that the super admins were the ones that could only once they could view the

Unknown Speaker  39:35
Advanced menu but

Speaker 2  39:40
I think I think I want to give it to the regional reps as well. Sure. Any like it's as simple based on the restrictions and

Speaker 1  39:49
whatnot. That's fine. Okay. Super Admin and

Unknown Speaker  40:04
Then

Unknown Speaker  40:07
a few questions about regions now

Speaker 2  40:15
so we're thinking as far as regions we have a region record with a name and you select a regional rep.

Unknown Speaker  40:24
And that is

Speaker 2  40:25
this correct it's the regional rep would be a drop list of contacts that are linked to a regional rep admin type user profile

Unknown Speaker  40:33
is that

Speaker 2  40:37
find a filter the list of contacts based on their links the type Yeah, they're linked by user group

Unknown Speaker  40:47
that's probably fair. Okay, I don't know how

Matthias Miller  40:56
whenever it makes much of a difference routine that and just a warning if it's not that Then

Unknown Speaker  41:00
or I mean even with that is it's

Matthias Miller  41:05
strictly necessary to filter it's a region how often do you assign regional reps

Speaker 2  41:20
he also they would want the Super Admin to also be on that list I found out today. Like, you know, if they don't have a regional rep for a region, they really just assigned like the executive director as a regional rep.

Unknown Speaker  41:36
That's still until they have somebody Sure. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  41:57
And then from the

Speaker 2  42:01
region I'd like them to have an easy way to view all the growth rings that are included in that region.

Matthias Miller  42:07
As long as we haven't asked prompt for the region on the grid for an airport that's

Unknown Speaker  42:10
easy. Okay,

Speaker 2  42:14
is it how much more work is it to add the tattered bottom report to the detail screen versus just a link to a filtered

Matthias Miller  42:23
it's it's not that much more work I mean, it's basically the same you have to create the report either way and then it's just a matter of specifying whether it goes in the bottom of the screen or creating a link for it

Unknown Speaker  42:33
okay, it's oops sorry I didn't mean to do that oh females click you're done because the first time and you did on a zoom call that an essentially inhibiting his freedom of speech if you do that well I mean is no he's allowed to speak

Matthias Miller  43:16
I'm exercising my freedom not to hear

Unknown Speaker  43:27
that's funny okay.

Unknown Speaker  43:53
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:54
well, I might just do a bottom report then.

Unknown Speaker  43:57
So

Unknown Speaker  44:02
you don't have to do another click sounds good

Unknown Speaker  44:16
all right.

Unknown Speaker  44:18
Excuse me. Now some questions on the contact record

Speaker 2  44:30
all right industry we want he wants to track the end he wants to track the industry or industries for each member. And it couldn't be multiple. It couldn't be probably not more than two. But if someone's an owner of multiple businesses

Unknown Speaker  44:53
or whatever the reason

Speaker 2  44:57
do we have it should just be an RG Do we have another way of doing actually we haven't got multi select

Matthias Miller  45:09
multi select that drives off in our G like for

Speaker 2  45:12
tags tags here again and then if I select multiple ones and it shows Okay, so does it it would have this button to the left and multiselect droplist

Speaker 1  45:29
wouldn't have to if you don't want to show the RG

Matthias Miller  45:33
so you could just have the multi select Drop list here we'd have to I mean we still have an underlying RG would just be red hidden Yep.

Unknown Speaker  45:41
Or okay nice

Unknown Speaker  46:14
Okay, very good

Speaker 2  46:18
um your question here about this the ID and having a standard format for important fields I like that idea and I think yeah, I think having an editable for admins can be a good thing or having a system switch that can be flipped to allow editable fields or what you said there about using a report any of those are good options and yes, I think documenting in CSS training would be

Unknown Speaker  46:53
good

Unknown Speaker  47:01
so I guess we can just find a documents and notes and stick them in their

Speaker 2  47:12
next one for you annual goals section this is at a RG like the address RG on contacts or displays what does that call is that the virtual RG

Unknown Speaker  47:32
Mr. G Mr. G we want to validate

Speaker 2  47:41
that there is you don't have multiple sets of goals in multiple rows for the same year I think this error message on Save is a simplest but is there an easy way to do this

Unknown Speaker  47:55
right away so that they don't add a

Speaker 2  48:01
whole set of goals for for the four second set of goals for the same year

Speaker 1  48:09
we could have a warning I mean we'd have an error on the you're on the year if there are other rows that have that you're okay that's fine we can get

Unknown Speaker  48:19
the deal okay

Unknown Speaker  48:42
and then

Speaker 2  48:48
your questions here note that contacts automatically deactivated after the membership ends date so we had talked a little bit last week or week before I think about automatically deactivating the user profiles should we is this is the automation there enough complication that we should just defer it until the future phase let them run with manually deactivating

Speaker 1  49:17
contacts and and producer profiles or no

Matthias Miller  49:28
I mean it's not that complicated.

Unknown Speaker  49:31
Okay have a

Unknown Speaker  49:39
like this

Unknown Speaker  50:44
should be enough to get them going okay

Unknown Speaker  50:55
right

Speaker 2  51:05
and then related to that if the like when the the membership ends and the contact is deactivated should we also go ahead and automatically remove them from the from the group

Unknown Speaker  51:28
um

Matthias Miller  51:32
what happens by the way if they don't update the membership and date and time

Speaker 1  51:41
then they will presumably get deactivated and want us to go

Unknown Speaker  51:47
in and reactivate them and

Unknown Speaker  51:49
set it up again which is something I

Speaker 2  51:54
think through a little bit more with legs. This was going to have been driven by Salesforce track more directly in Salesforce. And now if they go ahead with dropping Salesforce then then we'll have to let it be driven here.

Speaker 1  52:14
And with that will are we tracking

Matthias Miller  52:19
we're tracking start and end date for historical members as

Unknown Speaker  52:22
well or do they lose permanent access to their history when they leave a group no

Matthias Miller  52:35
memberships are tracked on the meeting.

Unknown Speaker  52:39
So it's removed got it? Nevermind.

Matthias Miller  52:41
I mean it's up to you. I mean it's as simple as this

Matthias Miller  52:59
well, it's not quite that because can the person be a member of multiple what happens if they're a

Speaker 1  53:03
facilitator? Group and facilitator. Yeah. And they're members of multiple groups

Unknown Speaker  53:30
probably the simplest one

Unknown Speaker  53:38
actually, let's do this

Matthias Miller  53:51
I do like that. So you go through and deactivate all the contacts, and then you deactivate any user accounts for inactive contacts and you deactivate any and by the way, do you reactivate if you reactivate a contact, you reactivate the user ID or no Well, what happens if they come back as a different contact type?

Unknown Speaker  54:25
Well, yeah,

Speaker 2  54:28
we only have three contact types. One remembers one for member organizations, one for other. So as possibly it gets switched to the other.

Matthias Miller  54:39
Shouldn't we actually move somebody from instead of deactivating the contact move them from move them to

Unknown Speaker  54:45
the other type?

Speaker 1  54:53
That'd be reasonable. Because you might

Unknown Speaker  54:56
enjoy the past members contact type something like that.

Unknown Speaker  55:05
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  55:30
don't know

Matthias Miller  55:31
it's probably slightly better because there's no accidentally let's go reactivate this contact we should send them an email see if he wants to come back and you actually make him a member again and he gets login access so the question would

Unknown Speaker  55:47
be do you want to

Matthias Miller  55:56
if they reactivate the member do they want to automatically grant access as well and that's just a simple dev spec chain basically, and we shouldn't clarify

Speaker 2  56:28
we also needed to ask questions such as we do, you'd ask questions do they want to track historical memberships? Like if if you're a member for a year and then you're not a member and then six months later you join

Unknown Speaker  56:41
again then we're going into like coverage RG like we have for Wheatland yeah

Matthias Miller  56:51
I mean if we really need to pull that information then we pull it off of what we don't have exact number dates but we have what meetings where they are it's

Speaker 1  56:58
part of sure isn't that good enough? I don't know saying we can we can pull information from that we will know the exact

Matthias Miller  57:13
start date we know what months they were members I mean I guess technically it doesn't matter if it's an RG

Unknown Speaker  57:29
no no. There should be a

Unknown Speaker  57:41
hoarders

Matthias Miller  57:42
TV show for people who want to collect more data than they ought

Unknown Speaker  57:50
vision data hoarders data hoarders

Unknown Speaker  58:06
the guy with his living room full of

Speaker 1  58:11
filing cabinets and external hard drives and exactly

Speaker 2  58:18
guy who builds a private data center in his backyard but a bunker in his backyard

Matthias Miller  58:28
it could very easily turn sinister got big Wi Fi antennas collecting as much information as you can from his neighbors make a great novel novelist

Unknown Speaker  58:43
the data hoarder

Unknown Speaker  58:50
even better self help book

Matthias Miller  58:54
breaking free from the information that binds wow I gotta go on a speaking circuit

Unknown Speaker  59:09
sorry of that keep going

Unknown Speaker  59:20
okay

Speaker 2  59:23
duplicate names he was find adding the contact ID to the end of the contacts name. Do we need to spec out anything else for that?

Matthias Miller  59:40
No, I mean basically just need needs to be flipped on.

Unknown Speaker  59:42
That's all Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  59:53
Is that a systems which

Matthias Miller  59:57
something like a system switch? Can you run an X 30 or Something no it's a an app hosting setting

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
named format name format we quit doesn't you're right contact

Speaker 1  1:00:26
less common ones include data system switch config contacts include ID and Name

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
sure less common oh sure

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
so then that one is

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
and then does that second

Speaker 1  1:01:10
you go in and you will edit the name on what? Oh there's a display name what Oh I wonder if you hit Apply change display name you that's not the

Unknown Speaker  1:01:27
the report must only show there

Unknown Speaker  1:01:31
Yeah, but

Matthias Miller  1:01:33
on an existing system you should still should probably run like be applied back over in the set app hosting settings run the Apply changes

Unknown Speaker  1:02:06
and then we can control where the weather

Matthias Miller  1:02:09
probably the main thing then is if there are places where we want to exclude

Speaker 1  1:02:12
the ID we should we need to specify them that's a good question

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30
like presumably the members directory

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Okay, good point.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
Excellent.

Speaker 1  1:03:14
Might be got a couple more.

Speaker 1  1:03:23
So print out growth ring. Worksheet printout is P F.

Speaker 2  1:03:34
Is this something? Do you know if it's better for us just to use? Literally just use this printed PDF? Word have the developers build one?

Matthias Miller  1:03:46
If we have flexibility over the design, the developer should come up with a simple way to do it. And if you go over to the PDF

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
is this for a build in or not filled in?

Speaker 2  1:04:00
And not filled in? At this point? It only be printed blank like this. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
in that case? Do they need to update it at all?

Speaker 2  1:04:17
It does need to be formatted. He just kind of threw it together. He would want to update it before. But

Matthias Miller  1:04:27
like every six months, they're gonna be refreshing it or No,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
I can ask.

Matthias Miller  1:04:32
I mean, I think I would do the same thing who would do the same design as we were Linda think?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:40
Or I think I would did we have a some kind of document record

Matthias Miller  1:04:47
or something that we uploaded these to where we had a wiki wiki category

Speaker 2  1:04:55
and we were recently working good design doing some design work to rework that for Are we willing but I think what they have good work well they had a look at

Unknown Speaker  1:05:08
what was it called it was a configure handbook but document

Speaker 2  1:05:29
we just have them gustavia Number one app hosting settings

Speaker 1  1:05:37
you II yeah you have a memo for Yeah. It could be just absolutely like it

Matthias Miller  1:05:58
there is an angel and the devil Angel says everything should be as simple as possible and no more and the devil is saying everything should be as complicated as possible and nothing less this is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
going to be part of my

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
breaking free from the information that bind

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
man

Matthias Miller  1:06:47
I'm happy very happy like let's just do it like this. I like it

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
okay cool simple simple simple simple

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19
easily

Speaker 2  1:07:20
okay and then the life goals worksheet I guess there's probably not much we need to talk about right now but this would be something that would be sometimes printed out blank and sometimes it'd be printed out

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
filled so anyway

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
oh I'm thinking about it

Speaker 2  1:08:04
all right and then automation says a member of Portal will automatically create monthly goal records for active members when a new growth ring meeting is created.

Speaker 2  1:08:23
And actually, maybe this would be better. Maybe this will be better discussed when once we have some more of the details cleaned up on some of these things.

Speaker 1  1:08:36
Okay, so here's the bottom line what we should do is we should have in our 22 Open

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
that opens and existing

Matthias Miller  1:08:59
are 20 that prompts for user plus meeting month or whatever it is. And if a goal record exists where it opens if it doesn't, it creates a new one and defaults it much like the open timecard report

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
works. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
And then what we could do

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
well the other option

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
other good options?

Matthias Miller  1:09:42
How soon do the new gold records need to be

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
created? So he said

Speaker 2  1:09:49
currently the current process that could change depending on how the software works best. Currently everyone sends their goals in after this month's meeting. And a facilitator would have I receive it all and then set up next month's meeting within a few days.

Speaker 1  1:10:08
So it wouldn't be you know,

Speaker 2  1:10:12
we met yesterday and then today and yesterday and tomorrow we're sending in our goals

Unknown Speaker  1:10:17
and then you know

Speaker 2  1:10:21
the after tomorrow or so the facilitator goes in and sets up next month's meeting

Unknown Speaker  1:10:28
however,

Speaker 2  1:10:30
so that's that's with their current system of email or whatever whatever they're using

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
here it's a lot it's we're integrated well, so why would we do this on the day of the meeting date we automatically create

Matthias Miller  1:10:55
an unscheduled meeting record for the following month he goes in and fills in the date or we just do we auto creep or we depending on its fuel that I don't remember how to seal it or we auto create one for one month in the future

Speaker 1  1:11:16
and mark it is scheduled pending or something that would be an option that'd be pretty straightforward then you go ahead and create all the well, you do

Matthias Miller  1:11:35
this for all the people who are going to be members next month what happens when membership changes in that 30 day window?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:39
Right? That's the obnoxious thing. But we have the Why would we why do we need to auto create goals

Speaker 2  1:11:51
he just makes it It automates things more and makes it less less work for the members but it's a click

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
Remember so it's not a lot it really helps them

Unknown Speaker  1:12:08
to keep helps prevent them from getting into but there's so much in that that they better not be forgetting

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
at the seams too complicated. What I really dislike about

Unknown Speaker  1:12:38
Well, either way if we create

Unknown Speaker  1:12:55
How can we simplify this?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
Because they

Speaker 2  1:13:17
should be able they want to be able to start setting goals

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
in advance. Like his

Speaker 2  1:13:26
Yeah, if the meetings tomorrow and he thinks I have to go ahead and set a goal for next month. He doesn't want to have to wait until after the meeting passes to confer goals to be created for him to be able to set out you know, to document something on his goal record. But he could still do that manually create a goal. I'm sorry, yeah, go record

Unknown Speaker  1:13:48
ahead of time.

Matthias Miller  1:13:53
Well, I mean, we could also always create goals seven days before the meeting day. Some arbitrary number. So the reason we want to share the goals is so that they show up in people's

Unknown Speaker  1:14:08
goals report or something? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:14:14
let's do this. Seven days before a meeting date. Sorry, how are how are months field it on a meeting are they?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:37
It's just meeting data. But so

Speaker 2  1:14:41
good. I think we probably should have month fielded because we're doing that for, for the goals. By

Matthias Miller  1:14:49
the way, if we do this drop list, why would we do something like 2023 Dash 12 as a format,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57
so it's sorted correctly.

Speaker 2  1:15:08
Yeah, we could rather than rather than December 2023.

Speaker 1  1:15:20
Yeah, I don't know, at least the underlying I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:15:26
I'm being wanting to make life easier for the developers and that's not necessarily the best route but

Matthias Miller  1:15:44
and then if you do that, then seven days before a meeting start date, you would create the meeting date for the next month, but you wouldn't assign an actual date to the meeting and you create multiple records.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57
And then if

Matthias Miller  1:16:01
and then the date of the meeting.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:04
You would

Matthias Miller  1:16:10
well, and you would do it based on everybody who's going to be a member?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
As of when hmm as of the first of the month I don't

Speaker 2  1:16:32
That's a good question, too. How do they set up memberships? Like do they set memberships to start immediately? Or do they set memberships to start on a future date?

Matthias Miller  1:17:04
Wouldn't be really nice as if their memberships would fall in a four month cycle so you become a member 6171 Like say April and the meeting is next week

Unknown Speaker  1:17:19
you'd set him as a member as of the first just makes it I don't know

Matthias Miller  1:17:33
seems like it'd be way easier to

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
and then when we require that they always end

Unknown Speaker  1:18:05
on the last day of the month as well

Unknown Speaker  1:18:23
if we can do that then this whole problem goes away well doesn't quite go away but mostly goes away

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
well

Matthias Miller  1:18:42
yeah, there still has to be some fixing up of meeting members adding or removing meeting members face to face

Speaker 2  1:19:00
what do we run into problems if the meeting is on? The meeting lands on the first or last of the month?

Speaker 1  1:19:05
No, no, because it'd be active Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
So then would

Speaker 2  1:19:34
with a membership ended date this is really technical, but it might ever slip starts April one. Would you with the membership and goes for a year?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:47
It would end

Speaker 2  1:19:48
on the end on March one, or the next year,

Matthias Miller  1:19:53
March 31. Go to the end of the month.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:16
Okay and then what happens if somebody and then we have a process that keeps

Unknown Speaker  1:20:47
was just obnoxious how do we keep

Matthias Miller  1:20:51
how do we keep the meeting members in sync? And or what happens if you had created a goal that the person is no longer a member? You're just straight up delete it

Unknown Speaker  1:21:04
that seems a little scary

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
question to

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
go status we'll probably just set the status to complete

Unknown Speaker  1:21:47
still way too complicated

Unknown Speaker  1:22:08
oh, here's an easy way

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26
I have validation

Matthias Miller  1:22:27
that you can't deactivate a member if they have if they're a member of a meeting

Speaker 1  1:22:31
and have a goal for that meeting. So if you want to deactivate them, you have to go remove them from there first and then you can deactivate.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:51
Does that mess with you

Speaker 2  1:22:52
the automatic deactivation that we were discussing earlier?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
No,

Matthias Miller  1:23:00
because the automatic deactivation can

Unknown Speaker  1:23:02
trigger if

Unknown Speaker  1:23:13
you can't trigger in that case.

Speaker 2  1:23:14
But then is it ever gonna trigger? Like they're always gonna have to do something manually?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:18
Good, not as they said it a month in advance. Sorry, I said,

Matthias Miller  1:23:30
Well, none of this none of these set none of these set the extra the end date a month out.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:49
So their membership end date?

Speaker 2  1:23:53
So quit falling, you'd have to be set a month earlier than the actual

Unknown Speaker  1:23:58
No, if, if,

Matthias Miller  1:24:01
if I tell the system that your membership ends on May 31, I'm fine because we won't have created any bowls or being memberships or anything past May. But if you if I come to you and I say your membership, if I tell the system your membership is ending April 30. Well, we've already created your goal and membership for the following month. And so and so of course you have to go clean that up

Unknown Speaker  1:24:33
mean I guess so.

Matthias Miller  1:24:36
What happens if you move somebody from one group to another group?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:44
Right. Then their goal.

Speaker 2  1:24:48
Their goal, presumably you'd be switched from one meeting to the other

Unknown Speaker  1:24:52
and then they'd be removed from the meeting.

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
Are we sure we do don't want some kind of extra 30 to

Unknown Speaker  1:25:04
manage members memberships

Unknown Speaker  1:25:13
maybe but what are you thinking? Well

Matthias Miller  1:25:21
what is everything that has to has to happen when you start a membership there's three actions start a membership moving membership and a membership you start a membership then we need to make sure that if there's a meeting that there are goals created for that if we end the membership we show a prompt that any goals after this date

Unknown Speaker  1:25:39
will be deleted

Matthias Miller  1:25:43
and if we move a membership then we would remove from one

Unknown Speaker  1:25:49
ad to the other and reassign goals

Unknown Speaker  1:26:07
yeah that?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:58
All right so

Unknown Speaker  1:28:00
you're saying start reasoning for the start membership

Matthias Miller  1:28:03
so start a membership you would set the membership start date on the content so let's do this contact record

Matthias Miller  1:28:16
set membership start date clear membership end date

Unknown Speaker  1:28:19
well unless you want to prompt for a membership end date when you do this to your set slash clear membership and well I mean it's

Unknown Speaker  1:28:32
it would set it yeah

Matthias Miller  1:28:33
okay set membership end date

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
then you would have a

Matthias Miller  1:28:42
oh you would also have a renew membership Mm

Unknown Speaker  1:28:46
hmm

Unknown Speaker  1:28:55
So then on the on the meeting record and start a membership

Unknown Speaker  1:29:12
that is a member

Matthias Miller  1:29:21
I guess growth ring you would also add as a member.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:41
Goal record

Unknown Speaker  1:29:42
creative missing

Unknown Speaker  1:29:54
renew a membership

Speaker 1  1:30:00
This would be the same as meeting plus sure

Speaker 2  1:30:09
no actually numbers or dates remains

Matthias Miller  1:30:22
meeting record and gold record would be same as above

Unknown Speaker  1:30:43
and that would be for the extra current months

Unknown Speaker  1:30:47
for any any months within there

Matthias Miller  1:30:55
thank you could you could basically do it for any months that are

Unknown Speaker  1:30:57
within make sure that they're a member for all all months of their membership

Unknown Speaker  1:32:00
so as traffic though with a goal so we create missing four well it's cool record

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:32:44
and then move a membership it's

Unknown Speaker  1:33:25
specifically non facilitator member

Speaker 1  1:33:32
is their facilitator you don't want to remove them right I think

Unknown Speaker  1:33:47
we all have free for all of these actually well and removing

Unknown Speaker  1:34:02
well

Matthias Miller  1:34:03
mean they might be members of multiple

Unknown Speaker  1:34:08
sorry gross ring record

Matthias Miller  1:34:10
remove as non remove as member if non facilitator

Unknown Speaker  1:34:19
Okay great. Sure. Yeah. Who question? Well, are we prompt?

Matthias Miller  1:34:38
Which membership would you like to move them from?

Unknown Speaker  1:34:40
Well, but you can't

Unknown Speaker  1:34:47
Yeah, I think you would use Select.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:52
Like this will have a prompt

Unknown Speaker  1:35:00
Why would this right so this the from group would be

Unknown Speaker  1:35:44
but

Matthias Miller  1:35:46
in which person is a non facilitating member

Unknown Speaker  1:35:50
right? Yes

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
that's that's the key

Unknown Speaker  1:36:08
um,

Speaker 2  1:36:09
we are only have about 25 minutes left. I wouldn't be in a restroom break do that or we can wrap it up.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:21
Do you mean, we try it? I think I have no preference.

Matthias Miller  1:36:30
I think you've got a pretty good idea where we're going with this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:32
But yeah.

Speaker 2  1:36:35
So we would have just, uh, yeah, I guess just to work on clarifying this a little bit more. We would have prompts for all of these

Unknown Speaker  1:36:41
right? Start Date end date? Yes. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:36:46
yeah, why don't you if you want to wrap this up, then why don't we break in?

Speaker 1  1:36:49
Okay, wrap it up. Sure. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:01
Okay so

Speaker 1  1:41:10
we would have prompts for we actually need a prompt for the contact rate yeah contact start beat and beat

Unknown Speaker  1:41:41
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:41:54
then

Unknown Speaker  1:42:03
it's a new end date

Unknown Speaker  1:42:22
and then should we

Speaker 2  1:42:23
remove your membership should we have an effective date as well

Unknown Speaker  1:42:28
or no we just happen to look bad yeah I mean

Matthias Miller  1:42:34
it has to happen automatically we can't really future

Unknown Speaker  1:42:52
okay

Speaker 2  1:43:02
would you see these as being like buttons on the contact record

Unknown Speaker  1:43:05
that would you'd read from their contact prompt

Unknown Speaker  1:43:33
adding buttons would have to have conditional visibility ability okay okay well I think that

Speaker 2  1:43:57
yeah, that gives you some good stuff to work with there

Unknown Speaker  1:44:06
so that takes care

Speaker 1  1:44:07
of a lot of stuff

Unknown Speaker  1:44:18
back to that

Speaker 2  1:44:18
question about auto creating the automating the monthly goals and

Unknown Speaker  1:44:23
meetings

Matthias Miller  1:44:31
so then I think at that point, this is completely

Unknown Speaker  1:44:32
fine. Using

Speaker 2  1:44:37
using which approach then the one or seven days before this month's meeting.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:45
We articulate

Unknown Speaker  1:44:46
goals for next month or meeting and goals for next month.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:18
All right

Unknown Speaker  1:45:41
and then there's still think this

Speaker 2  1:45:42
thing here of our 20 that prompts for user and meeting months

Unknown Speaker  1:45:46
creating an opening it does that technically you

Matthias Miller  1:45:50
don't need it if you're doing seven days before

Unknown Speaker  1:45:52
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:46:10
okay

Speaker 2  1:46:12
and then this these dev specs down here are these things that are still relevant

Unknown Speaker  1:46:36
you guys hit my face I'm sorry I'm thinking

Matthias Miller  1:46:55
fingers something like that

Unknown Speaker  1:47:26
okay

Speaker 2  1:47:32
sounds good. Well, we are hoping to get some answers from the client about Salesforce in the next week. Just need to ask about

Speaker 1  1:47:41
about Twilio books. That'll be later phase so

Unknown Speaker  1:48:06
Okay, well, I

Unknown Speaker  1:48:07
think Excuse me. I think that does it for now then.

Speaker 1  1:48:12
And we'll plan to keep working away at it. And talk again on Thursday. Okay. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:29
All right. Yep. Thank you guys. And we will end

Unknown Speaker  1:48:34
later. Okay, sounds good. Thanks. All right. Yep. Bye
