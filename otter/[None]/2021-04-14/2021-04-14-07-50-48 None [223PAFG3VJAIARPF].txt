If you want to understand how God works, you need to understand how rational versus emotional logic works. Emotional logic is three, rational logic is the plan. And so the idea is that these two are reversed and so when God looks at the outcome of who he wants to create, he works backwards from there. And that is the rational logic of getting us where we need to go. But from our experience we step into it from the emotional logic and so we see this problem and then as a result of this problem, then something else happens and then as a result of that we get led into this other situation and moving forward from there. And lo and behold we end up at the destination and we're shocked that we were actually actually able to end up at the next destination was the experience with God but this is also the experience. People get in terms of reading copies of when, when you do this emotional logic and when you, when you do this reverse forward, backwards approach that they follow you along and then they're shocked at exactly how the pieces, completely line up and completely are congruent. And that's one of those things that is really fascinating about this whole approach.
