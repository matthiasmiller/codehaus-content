Speaker 1  00:17
B Ah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  00:30
We were wondering about, do we use the cogs accounting basis anywhere?

Unknown Speaker  00:40
Me just share screen. I was about ready to send you this picture. If I didn't hear anything, I said, Give all the different ways to do it without saying anything.

Matthias Miller  00:56
I was I thought about sending a run for his run, but I didn't want to stop what it

Unknown Speaker  01:07
was doing. FGI, accounting, cogs, basis, I was kind of proud of that.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Why? Actual costs?

Speaker 1  01:32
If the county basis is blank, well, so here we try to use it. You said it?

Matthias Miller  01:43
I cost dollars? Do we use the accounting cogs cost dollars?

Unknown Speaker  01:51
I don't think we do

Matthias Miller  02:02
some macros. It

Speaker 1  02:03
doesn't Oh, yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:16
okay, cost, double check on cost variance, whether we use edge, I can't imagine we do, but

Unknown Speaker  02:42
doesn't look like it. I

Matthias Miller  02:48
don't know why we need to keep it. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if it makes you more comfortable. I can. I'm not.

Speaker 1  03:04
I don't think I'm really worried about it. I don't remember using it anywhere, and we're not seeing it. So I think we can go ahead and just do it. I

Matthias Miller  03:24
I'm fine with that. Hey, it's good. The only, the only downside now is that

Matthias Miller  03:42
we should almost when you should remove it in a separate update, but we should almost put, well, are we? Are we showing? Do we show just a regular variance in the RG? You go to row two. I Yeah.

Speaker 1  04:07
So we have the actual, actual cost variance, right? So that's what we all we need. I think

Matthias Miller  04:15
that's, I mean, that's visible to them. Okay, yeah, sweet.

Speaker 1  04:20
Okay, so I'll just go in and nuke as we're good to go. Yep, okay, perfect.

Matthias Miller  04:27
Oh, fun, fun story. Nick and I Yeah, the formatting might be terrible. It might not be sufficient, but Nick and I did the revenue channel income

Speaker 1  04:36
statement in. Like, that's awesome. I repeat it, then they're just went over it a bit, but I look great. How, how long did we estimate it

Matthias Miller  04:48
for that one? I have no idea. But okay. I mean, I think, I think we said, I don't know, half a week, I don't know. But yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  04:57
I'm happy to be under on some projects. I feel like. I've had too many bleeding long recently.

Matthias Miller  05:03
You can send me a small box of candy in the mail or something. Yeah. I mean, if they have to reform, if they really have to have it match the income statement format, then it's it's sure that's good. It's not gonna be awful, but it's gonna you have

Speaker 1  05:27
time bunch more work. Yeah. Then you said, Send a tea bag. That reminds me of the annoying I've heard stories of missionaries that would get barrels of stuff, and people would literally said used tea bags

Matthias Miller  05:44
to tell the story, just like how,

Unknown Speaker  05:46
okay, that's it. What? It's terrible.

Matthias Miller  05:49
Why? Why?

Unknown Speaker  05:53
Don't know? Just anyway,

Matthias Miller  05:57
they were taking the hungry children in Africa, just a

Speaker 1  06:00
little bit too far, I think so.

Matthias Miller  06:07
Okay, are there other big zfp projects that are on the that we should be, that I should be? Oh, I have some analysis, some numbers that are off, don't I?

Speaker 1  06:19
Yeah, I think so let's go to the to do list which I was going to standardize, and I haven't quite gotten to. The reason I haven't gotten to it is because they've duplicated so much stuff from the or Josh duplicated so much logic from the main report. So I kind of want to, I'll probably standardize it and then go back in and refactor, yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:44
Anyway, so payouts

Unknown Speaker  06:48
updates this one. Okay, yes, I'm gonna chase

Matthias Miller  06:56
here's a report of prepaid stripe. Payouts.

Unknown Speaker  06:58
Wait, maybe you did chase it. We did

Matthias Miller  07:00
it a little bit. I kind of like the posture of we told you guys we know where some of the problem is. Can you please fix

Unknown Speaker  07:13
it? Should we just choose ping

Matthias Miller  07:17
you, shoot an email to Drew, and I don't know whether you want to copy support or at least Mark and I and ask him, tell him, tell him, this is waiting on him and asking where it's at, where it's at, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:31
that's this guy. I want to add the little copy button.

Matthias Miller  07:35
That would be ridiculously awesome.

Speaker 1  07:38
We could literally just have it right here, right? Yeah, yeah. Should do that instead of the dumb Share button. I should have Sean do that. That's what I should do. There you go. Hey, we'll see a field pick for that. Oh, yeah. Okay, so this one customer deposits. Where's that at? I did this. It's in Mark's court to talk to Josh. Wait, yeah, yeah, good. And well, okay. And also, for him to look at this. I emailed him about that, so I, yep, not gonna care. I don't think do we need to email them about this job? Or probably not. Should we best for deposits about the he knows to talk to Josh. So Josh, he'll show up.

Matthias Miller  08:30
Yeah, I care less. On the back end of it for us, right?

Speaker 1  08:36
Hey, that's discrepancy for FGI. I'm gonna do this. There's, that's the only thing left at this point. I think sweet. This one's about ready to die, which would be amazing. This one you all just knocked out

Matthias Miller  08:51
first draft, at least, for sure,

Speaker 1  08:55
I'm gonna change it to doing and making Matthias coded a first draft of this will come through with the next update. What's this guy? Oh, so this is one of my next ones to be working on. Then this was, isn't this in Mark's court?

Matthias Miller  09:26
Clean alternative? Yeah, okay, but are we supposed to be coding this? I don't know, on the financial asset account at an asset class.

Speaker 1  09:35
I don't think we ever confirmed we wanted to code it, but we're ready to just leave that cash flow is going to be a doozy. We don't have details on that. We

Matthias Miller  09:50
didn't tell Mark that he needs to get his his rear end gear if he wants cash flows done.

Speaker 1  09:56
That where's it at? Is there stuff or. Ready on him for or do we, well,

Matthias Miller  10:04
we could, we could start cashing cash flow details on the transaction and start moving in that direction. I think if you've got the cash,

Speaker 1  10:21
some not, not just Googles, but if we want to start making progress, that would be the thing to do.

Matthias Miller  10:30
Yeah,

Speaker 1  10:33
because I think, I mean, they want project management first, so I should do that. But the thing is, cash flow is the one that's going to bleed

Matthias Miller  10:42
super long. Well, it's going to be so much back and forth, exactly. That's the thing that has me worried. Um, on the

Matthias Miller  10:55
improve project management, are you happy with the design this one? Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1  11:06
it. I think it's relatively simple.

Speaker 1  11:15
I check template so they have these templates, they essentially want to add a group to this that, and then this report would group by that, and it might bleed down to a few other places. And then we'd have an ass prompt on here. Both of these, we would add the grouping also the active projects report, and then the recurring schedule. I need to look at a little more. He wants it to be basically the same as Scheduled Documents. Recurring schedule

Matthias Miller  11:50
button there.

Speaker 1  11:52
That's where it is. Yeah. So, whoo. Schedule tight. That's beautiful. I

Matthias Miller  12:06
so I'll

Speaker 1  12:08
edit this temporarily, so it would be something like that. And then there's more options when you select, like, monthly or something.

Matthias Miller  12:20
By the way, I have a bunch of reusable code. I don't know if he has it here or not, okay, dude, but on email reminders, okay, we also have a and it's semi, semi modular. You would have to have, you need the you need the fields, but you had the macros and stuff. But you had the macros and stuff. And I also think that, and some of it's overkill, because you can do it the day before the third Wednesday. Wow. And I would also, if I had to do it all over again, I would use virtual RGS or multi select, ooh, multi, select with an orange underlining RG, which will let you use helper list, multi,

Unknown Speaker  13:13
select, as in, like, what

Matthias Miller  13:16
here?

Matthias Miller  13:22
Well, like.

Matthias Miller  13:31
So you can do which months you could do, Day of month, week, and then you on the Day of Week, you say is every week or which? Which week is it Gotcha? And you can also say the Tuesday before the first second and last Wednesday.

Unknown Speaker  13:56
Oh, my word.

Matthias Miller  14:00
I was wishing, if I wish, there'd be a way to take something like this, engineer size component so it runs off a string table or off something, yeah, yeah. Structure would be really amazing. Structure would be ideal, and then you should shove a structure into string field.

Speaker 1  14:22
Well, no, you could have, can't you can you have a field that says structure, I don't know. You can have a field that's an array of structure and trust that it has, yeah, I'm pretty confident,

Matthias Miller  14:44
would be incredible. Then you could basically define your own custom control.

Speaker 1  14:51
It's where, unless maybe it's only macros. Actually, I bet it's just macros. I. I might just be macros. I was thinking it was fields. No, I'm only seeing it for macros. That makes sense.

Matthias Miller  15:11
But if these were, but if these were helper lists and multi select, I don't know, maybe that wouldn't help that much. Mm, you could almost,

Matthias Miller  15:33
yeah, anyway, I don't know it's probably so the scheduling mirroring the scheduling

Speaker 1  15:43
thing, yeah, and they also need the ability to have a start date and a date to create the project on because they are doing things here. Let me share screen again. I know it doesn't make sense right away.

Unknown Speaker  16:05
They're doing things where this one was the project action template

Speaker 1  16:18
was negative five business days, because all okay, all of these to create a budget, it starts the reverse calculating from the start date.

Matthias Miller  16:33
Got it so you're setting right? So we need a budget by

Unknown Speaker  16:41
2727 27th

Matthias Miller  16:42
27th and then everything starts on January 2, for example, or whatever. Yeah, yeah. Except it's business days, so it's December already, right, right? So they want to be able to set schedule based on the earliest start date versus the earliest and or the due date

Speaker 1  17:04
we need to be I think what he was saying is that we need to be able to create we can't create the project on the start date. We have to create the project before the start date, because reactions might be before the start date, right?

Matthias Miller  17:28
So you need to, so you need to look at the template date, but your x 30 needs to do stuff, needs to create the project as soon as the first task like becomes do, no, not do. Starts whatever it is. No, you have to look at when it's due relative to the template. And then you need to look at how many days it should be created before the before then, and find the earliest for the entire Okay, fine. I mean, you

Unknown Speaker  18:02
get it. I think I know what to do the

Matthias Miller  18:05
So, the nervous thing in this whole thing, if there is one, is the complexity

Speaker 1  18:10
of mirroring the recurring schedule. Recurring schedule. Yes, because group fields dead simple. I can just, I should just do that now, or do it as soon as I can. And, boom, we're there. Yep, I'm invading the room, I guess. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:35
okay, okay. Well, sounds good, good.

Unknown Speaker  18:41
Okay, thank you. Yep. Hey, Joel.
