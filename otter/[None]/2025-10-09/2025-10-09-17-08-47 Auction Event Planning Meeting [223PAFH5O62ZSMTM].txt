Speaker 1  00:00
We can go get little clips out of it to use for different stuff out there than the things that you can be recording, because you will want and then put a camera on the back record everything, audio and visual.

Speaker 2  00:15
We just set up on the auction block. We just have a small camcorder just sitting there running all day. Okay,

Speaker 3  00:28
you guys can help me prioritize. We won't. We won't go through this point by point. But I would like to, I would like to kind of get the questions down that we have for to process thinking about the handbill software, whether that is just something we we just need to iron out, or there's something we need to consider, other software, whatever,

Unknown Speaker  00:57
and Then I want to

Speaker 3  01:00
process Friday night in general, and then Saturday as well. So those would be the three main points,

Speaker 4  01:13
and we can kind of pick and choose on the specifics that we

Unknown Speaker  01:17
spend time on, but there was some,

Unknown Speaker  01:23
definitely some feedback that came in

Unknown Speaker  01:29
about the, yeah, just prepping and stuff.

Speaker 3  01:43
You. Why don't we? Why don't we start with Friday I apologize for not having any more in order, but why don't we start with Friday night, more general conversation,

Unknown Speaker  01:55
and then kind of back into the software issues.

Speaker 4  01:59
So I would say I heard a lot of just positive people enjoying Friday night

Speaker 3  02:10
kind of started on our end. But what was, what were some of the things you heard negative, or maybe saw, felt i

Speaker 5  02:24
It's easy to focus on the negatives. I feel like overall, this is fantastic. Make 15 grand on first year we should, we should, like, yeah or Yeah. And the downside is check in and silent option thing that just that he because that's, that's, that was not our fault.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
So did you hear much about that? I'm not very worried. Yeah, it

Speaker 4  02:55
felt, felt heavy for a couple of us, at least, because we started checking people, and realized that it was not working out very well. People lined up pretty fast, and all of a sudden, our half hour from doors open and starting was gone. So we just started sitting, seeing people, and so then people were in the auction, but weren't checked in to do the silent auction bidding, so it just kind of snowballed on us. But the software, the way they had taught us to check in, for me, at least it was not flowing, and I tried to get a couple of the highest blues on board, but we did not spend enough time with them, getting

Unknown Speaker  03:41
that smoothed out? Was it?

Unknown Speaker  03:46
Was it a full time?

Speaker 4  03:48
Yeah, it was, I mean, I think we had some, some empty seats,

Unknown Speaker  03:51
but it felt nice and full.

Speaker 2  03:53
It's like Nevin. I asked Nevin if they went well. He ended up working late Freddie Maine, and he said they had not got a table. He said, after about when he got home Friday night, he was wishing they really had and I was like, well, that's a guy that probably next year will hop on board. And then he was saying he heard it was really funny, and Nelson and Karen were telling us that they thought it was really greedy. Good.

Speaker 4  04:21
No, I agree with what Matthias said on the sour a little bit there at the beginning, but the end of the evening, I was like, Man, this was a success for the first time.

Speaker 1  04:36
Think, I think the community needed it more than any of us even realize. Like the amount of people that even since have told me my husband has not left so hard, I don't know at all, like I'm talking about multiple people, like about a dozen people or more have told me that. And you know, just everybody, New Horizons, are doing their thing. They have good time play ball. But it just seemed, just in the feedback I'm getting, people just relaxed and just freaking enjoyed it. And so overall, yes, huge success, in my opinion. And I I think it's worth pursuing. And I told you this, but I'll tell you again. Josh, I'm glad you brought the idea to the table with it, and it was a really good idea, for sure. We the community needed it, and I would like to see if we can do it again.

Speaker 5  05:39
Also, the other thing too, I found it very interesting how few hands we need to mention this. When he asked, when you ask who's gonna be there tomorrow, it's like, so we got a whole new demographic, and there's a whole bunch of, yeah, I mean, just lenders and family and all those, like, some of those people who, and I think that's awesome. Like, we, we, I don't know if we're trying for this, but talk about expanding the banner pool. Well, I think we just found a pathway to doing that. And just, let's double down and not apologize that people coming to the auction are probably a different crowd than Friday, I think.

Speaker 2  06:16
And you'll probably have, as it goes on, you'll probably have people coming Friday nights at events, we'll start right Saturday.

Speaker 1  06:24
Yeah, I would advise next year we sell tables and we sell seats, see if we can get a hair lower than one, but at 200 down to 150 or something, maybe

Unknown Speaker  06:35
give we have closer to 250

Speaker 1  06:37
for the price. No, the price, price, price. I'm saying, like, not apologize for it, people can't come. They just can't count on me, because, quite frankly, the amount of people that came came there for free. I feel there should have been a little bit more money in the baskets.

Speaker 4  06:56
Yeah. Frankly, yeah. It should have been interesting. Bump up the table price, or the seat and the silver price.

Speaker 1  07:04
Sell the tables in the seat price, maybe just bring it down just a hair. I feel like 200 is a shade steep. Maybe, yeah, but not too cheap. I'm thinking, whatever we decide on, maybe just make it reachable for people and just not give anyway, because there's significant amount of people that that just a few of them just showed up, which is, was okay, but I think people now figured out it's fun. They've heard about it. They've talked about it, okay, we made 15,000 next year. We better make 20,000 in my opinion. And if, if they want to sit at home and hear about a second hand, that's fine, but, you know, third year, they're gonna want to come back. We'll keep creating a making we will be able to make it more profitable. Yes, I agree with you. I I honestly think, hey, we all deserve a pat on the back, and need to go celebrate this weekend. I think it was a slam dunk. There's a few things too I'm thinking about. But, you know, as a whole, I was too impressed. I thought maybe we'd be pulling more away from the auction. But actually, I was talking to like, one of the Amish guys from West but he said, Man, this made me all excited to come to the auction. I'm like, well, sweet. That's exactly what we've learned so and, you know, people like Ivan's like, man, next year, I want to have a table here too. I'm like, Yeah, this is sweet. You know, let's get some of these guys. Ivan, he was an Amish guy. He has the bulk food. He said he wants to have one for the deli. So it brings us more people we can go after. We should go after them, lenders, you know, a few other people till next year. And I want to have, you know, tap into more of that Amish. I love getting them coming. That was my whole thing with Aaron Stutzman. I thought too was good mention to try, you know, maybe that wasn't all of our favorite kind of music, but, you know, it was good. They're very talented, but it helped bring some of those people in, honestly, yeah, so, and they loved it. And Sunday night too. I know we didn't feel like doing it, but shoot Aaron got over 1000 1100 bucks more, and that really helped, really, yeah, I mean, probably more for you. So one thing I would love, I know this year, was tap put on me to brainstorm Friday evening. What can we do? But this coming year,

Unknown Speaker  09:30
true,

Speaker 1  09:34
I'd love to see it more of if we're going to do it again, more of like a team thing, like not that, if it's a go where it's going to either go or fail me, but we can all take responsibility. I honestly my takeaway. One thing I'm thinking about is I think we could go up with the table prices and down with the seat pricing. Maybe, I think we'd get 1750 out of the table. Honestly, I was thinking about New Horizons banquets. I think they get 70 under out of table. And if we look up the table price is 1750 that'd be up in at 500 bucks. We would have made an extra 15,000 bucks that evening, just right there

Unknown Speaker  10:19
we were four weeks out, and we have single

Unknown Speaker  10:21
table sold pretty much, I know. So we were scared for

Unknown Speaker  10:24
how much we were scratching.

Speaker 1  10:25
I think we did this year. I think it's phenomenal. But next year, I think we can build on that. Because I really think for everyone that was there was like, hey, I want to be there next year. Yeah, well, next year. Shoot, it's a little higher. Sweet. Well, we're gonna get you to pay for that. But if

Speaker 5  10:41
you really want to push it too, you can also do early bird discount, so, you know, eight and 12 weeks out, and then we have the money for everyone.

Unknown Speaker  10:49
Do I love that?

Speaker 4  10:54
So, yeah, I think if we push it to the sponsors that were there this year, they'll, I think most of them will do it again. Problem filling the tables.

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Were you gonna mention something

Speaker 1  11:11
good way. One thing about the hand bid for that evening. I know that was the first time that was kind of crazy thing. But even if we had the table that was there on Saturday, registering people in. Had all that help and got people, Hey, come over here. Here's your table. We can go over to them. We had an extra table of people helping. That would be

Unknown Speaker  11:35
tremendous. Yeah, we need more people on that, for sure.

Speaker 5  11:39
The people in phone that raised another issue, not having papers for the silent auction Friday night got in our way as well.

Unknown Speaker  11:47
We could have pretty easily done that.

Speaker 1  11:50
In my opinion, Friday night we I'm not the techie guy, but just the old country boy saying we could slap down some papers and be just as well off,

Speaker 5  11:59
yeah, as the app, and maybe not even to check in beyond,

Speaker 1  12:03
just because, I think one of the biggest things that we missed Friday night, like one of the biggest things that we should have thought about, in my opinion, the app we had issues with that wasn't really our fault so much, was we didn't think about The Amish rolling in there and not having the phones, and so

Unknown Speaker  12:24
we kind of did, but they said, Oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  12:26
not a problem. Oh, we had

Speaker 4  12:27
just log them in. Like this reason it didn't flow as smoothly, is it? I didn't realize, but yeah, it was an issue. You're right. The main issue was that we had sold tables, but we had no idea who was at those tables, and then it was just like these blank guests, more or less. That was, that was the way I

Speaker 1  12:49
yeah, I'm sorry about that too. I could have helped with that more. I were first time. We couldn't do a few things better next time. And

Speaker 4  12:59
the other thing is, not everybody that comes in has to check in as a bidder, so it's kind of, it was kind of

Speaker 1  13:08
hard to make that Friday night. You know, if we have issues with our system, if we switch systems, whatever, somebody could just, they could just put their names down beside it for Friday night to you. And then when they go to pay, they have to just put their info in or something. But once

Speaker 4  13:26
we had everybody seated and kind of moving through it, I don't, I don't think it was horrible. It wasn't. There was a couple items we didn't get much for on the silent auction. Some of them we got, like that espresso machine. I think I paid 400 for it, and they gave 600 for

Unknown Speaker  13:46
it. Like everything went, how much did the

Unknown Speaker  13:51
surfboard? I don't know what number

Unknown Speaker  13:56
you found. Who got it, either.

Unknown Speaker  13:59
I talked to the guy that got I think it was Linder, maybe.

Speaker 4  14:05
He said he's on the duck unlimited banquet on that board, I think.

Unknown Speaker  14:12
And there was a guy that introduced himself to me, forget

Speaker 4  14:18
his name now he said he'd like to help us with some video

Speaker 3  14:26
developing sponsor that videos for our sponsors. He said I can just send him the one we have made this year. He can doctor it up and show us what he can do is that file on our drive

Unknown Speaker  14:41
that sponsor, Josh, I do want

Speaker 1  14:49
you to know Friday night would not have been a success. I would not have blamed you. I yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:00
I think we were all on board to do it, yeah,

Speaker 5  15:06
yeah, yeah, no, yeah,

Speaker 1  15:09
it's all good. It was. Since I had to brainstorm on it, I was kind of stressed about that. We didn't carry

Speaker 4  15:18
a lot of weight this year, I just want to say thank you for doing that. I don't, I couldn't carry what you did this year. I do hope that we can get, maybe get an event coordinator, just somebody to run banquet. Is so much more to it than than, like the auction Saturday, or at least, yes, new stuff for

Speaker 1  15:43
us. A matter of fact, we really owe Miss Hodge that was there. We should give her a gift card.

Unknown Speaker  15:50
She worked

Speaker 1  15:57
again, you're right. I liked your suggestions there. Let's get MacKenzie to help out with that, or somebody

Speaker 3  16:05
talk about that a little bit. Would there be any other nomination? Somebody mentioned Jen earlier. She wasn't around this year,

Unknown Speaker  16:13
Marvin's daughter.

Unknown Speaker  16:17
I there thought of McKenzie. I don't really know what her

Unknown Speaker  16:20
that might sound like, yeah,

Speaker 4  16:25
Grace said she's be willing to help with that type of thing, but she's not really interested in adding it

Speaker 2  16:37
up. Jenny, I don't know she's supposedly they're having a baby in spring. That might be. That might change stuff for fall.

Speaker 3  16:54
Yeah, well, we didn't have a little bit time to process that, but maybe thinking about that,

Speaker 1  16:59
let's go take it's going to be, it's a unique role, pretty much, because the person is not, does not, that person doesn't have the final say, and yet they have to try to organize event around, some, around, around, you know what? Around an organized auction board

Unknown Speaker  17:27
next year, more organized. We are becoming more organized.

Speaker 5  17:31
The solution of that, the more that person can sit in these these conversations and be in the loop and be taking notes and organizing stuff as it comes up. It part of the issue with the organization. Of the organization is like, it's, most of us are good in the moment and very terrible following our stuff afterwards. I mean, that's you guys.

Speaker 1  17:59
That's great. But it'd be nice to say, hey, here's a list of things that needs to happen. Here's the volunteers to go after. Here you go. That's

Speaker 4  18:08
the type of thing that this year it was like, Well, Josh was running after tableware, you know, like the week of, and then Beth is printing out sponsorship papers the day of, and we were trying to see people five minutes before, you know, all that stuff, bring that together. Not so much the decision making, hopefully, but yeah.

Speaker 3  18:37
But yeah, we do need to process how, how to kind of flow out the footwork with as we expand. We've talked about how how much work Beth does, and how out of the loop she really is with the meetings. That's one of the reasons I I asked, besides, if we could record is we could at least maybe get an outline of like these things were talked about.

Speaker 6  19:03
That's a step. And I was working this year on developing some WhatsApp groups just

Speaker 4  19:10
just to have those, like next year, I can just send messages back here and say,

Speaker 3  19:19
so it's all in the works, but definitely it's something we need to keep working on.

Speaker 1  19:26
Kendall, I just wanted to give you a shout out. Thank you for all you're doing keeping us all organized. You're doing a fantastic job.

Unknown Speaker  19:32
Well, I feel like I had fun this year.

Speaker 3  19:41
Definitely don't feel like I'm an expert organizing, but I do enjoy working with you guys.

Speaker 4  19:49
I enjoy the energy you guys bring to the vision. I think it's really cool. And like Julian said, I don't know just our main goal was to go one step further and expanding our community reach. And I think we knocked it out apart with getting West, with businesses to buy in, getting a couple of Van loads over here, Dan Francis and his tribe showed up. He'll he'll be a networker for

Speaker 1  20:22
us. Who's his tribe? The tribe, it's AJ

Speaker 4  20:26
ball team. He texted me, said, sorry that my people had to leave the table to go out for smoke breaks. What can I say?

Speaker 4  20:46
So I told him, I said, I said I was hoping the lights would stay off a little bit longer. That's it, but I guess the center alert must have gone off.

Speaker 1  21:01
Well, maybe I turned Mr. Pearson back too much. He had a few jokes that I turned to. Did he give you a list or something? No, he the questionable ones. He came and asked me about Jason because there was a couple that were just a little over the top. For one was about smoking. The other one was about getting dressed. It's like, Hey, how about this joke? My wife comes in the room says, Well, why not? He said, Well, why not? She goes because it's wrinkled. He said, Well, I wasn't dressed yet.

Speaker 1  21:58
Off the Wall, she said. And I was like, it's pretty good for comedian,

Speaker 6  22:07
though, people, people enjoy. Kevin said, Kevin Miller, I

Speaker 2  22:18
think it all comes down to what I'm hearing is that as a first year experience being ahead, I think you did it. I heard you guys did it so and then we grow off of that.

Speaker 4  22:33
And I think a big part of that was just the quality of the entertainment, if you will. Like, like, I told somebody, we, you know, we go to some of these fundraiser banquets where you gotta sit through the thing and you listen to the talking, and it's great. But this people came and they got something from the outside, like, just fresh and new to treat.

Unknown Speaker  22:59
So it's good.

Speaker 3  23:03
Is there any comments on the program? Other lines, I think we've touched on

Speaker 5  23:10
some feedback too. This is from my wife. She's, like, it was pretty long, like we really wouldn't have you only need singing while people were getting the food, and for them to just keep singing. And singing was, admittedly, that's not, there's not much of that stuff using hang around her house much. But even beyond that, it makes for long if they both of these are coming in, they're used to having a full evening, and so it takes a little bit of setting expectations, like, No, we're not doing a double.

Speaker 1  23:39
Yeah. That is good feedback, too. My wife also thought singing got a little long, and I had initially told him, I think 45 minutes, somehow he came up with an hour, and I think it was a good hour on that. So that was my fault, though. I should have dialed him back. But same token, I want to pay for their money's worth. So what do you do? You're paying that much to come for 45 so yeah, that's why I left him no longer. But that's good. We should make some time they're about 45 I would save a half hour. Who's thinking about that too? Because I don't really think it was the wisest to have them sing while we eat. Because nobody was paying attention. Everybody was talking to each other. The music was gone. If you just watched like there was very few people watching them. Then when he got done eating, and then people turn around watching, he even mentioned that. So I don't know what the answer is, because obviously it would go too long. If people would just eat. It just seems like people would enjoy it more if they show up and eat, listen music, then the other guy, and also while they eat or whatever. We could be doing some announcements and maybe even sell a thing or two or something, but we would have to start. We would have to start at five o'clock, which I think would, people would still show up, I think longer for us. But that's all stuff that can be discussed later. Sometimes it's kind of something that was processing structure

Speaker 5  25:13
the program, where, if you can structure the program in some way that then getting food is kind of an intermission, people get up the ground, talk whatever, like having some breaks?

Unknown Speaker  25:24
Yeah, we had to keep rolling

Speaker 1  25:28
pretty good. And then the poor people that called in for diarrhea, I didn't catch that one. Yeah, all right, everyone who's got diarrhea, get up and exit now.

Speaker 2  26:00
Was good. Nelson had mentioned that he bought one table

Unknown Speaker  26:06
for, I

Speaker 2  26:10
don't know, was it workers, family, whatever, and then he bought another table to bring community people. And you know that many people might have heard is a little bit on money wise, but that's what we wanted. We wanted community people there.

Speaker 4  26:26
So, yeah, that's about sponsoring tables. Is getting Allison, or people like him, to pay for a table and then inviting people that don't have an initial commitment.

Speaker 1  26:40
Yeah, yeah, that actually I was sitting out there truck, and I knew that was missing some of my notes. There was another confusion about if you bought the if you sponsor the top sponsorship, and also did a table next year. I think we should just totally skip giving them one seat or two seats, yeah. And if want to do something, tell them they get a discount on the on a table or something. Hey, this top sponsorship, you get a 10% discount for a table or something, but just totally forget about the seats. Yeah, because wasn't that kind of confusing, or was it just me?

Unknown Speaker  27:15
We rolled with it. Kind of evolved, to be honest.

Unknown Speaker  27:22
And I'm kind of surprised how well it worked

Speaker 4  27:28
that there wasn't more confusion. But the end of the day, if people thought of it like, well, I can buy I can pressure my people into paying 200 per seat. Just be 2000 or I can pay 1250, and kind of see it as it's paid for. It's kind of a no brainer, so think it kind of made sense, if they thought of it that way. But

Speaker 3  27:57
Mark sent me a preliminary report, and I mainly wanted to know how much cash we made Saturday, Saturday or Friday.

Unknown Speaker  28:08
Saturday, we had. The

Speaker 4  28:09
closest number I can figure out is that our sponsorships were pretty much we're pretty much breaking even with our sponsorships for this Friday night, and then the 15 grand that came in was, was profit. So I haven't got closer than that yet.

Speaker 1  28:30
How many people are actually there? I mean, we fed 320 people with kids really. So probably 275 paying people what time you take us out of the equation and the kids? Well, probably, but we have, I would say, actually, because there was a few tables that were entirely full, but we had 300 set up, and then actually another table for staff. So yeah, we had 310 set up, plus the kids. So that means if there was 275 paying people there, we would have got about average of $54 person, yeah, see $55 roughly. And that surprised me, because I figured we would get more, but that's where I'm gonna have to if they don't, people don't give the table. Prices have to go up,

Speaker 5  29:24
in my opinion. What do you think a lot of people just came with the assumption? Well, it's a company sponsored event, right? They're footing the bill. I'm here to enjoy it. Yeah, right, yeah.

Speaker 4  29:35
That's where we need to be a little more creative, maybe in giving opportunities, green space. To develop that this year, but so they have, they have reason to give a couple times through the evening, like, like in the Elk Elk thing, like they were constantly selling something, and at the end of the evening, I think everybody felt like they want to buy something, whether it's raffle tickets or whatever.

Speaker 5  30:02
But also like giving away raffle tickets shots in the foot too. Like people giving away any rapid, any rip rap, because nobody like, oh, well, just use my chance and like, why would I or am I wrong on that? I don't know. Maybe not.

Speaker 7  30:19
My thought was that primes the pump a little bit

Speaker 5  30:23
like, right? But, I mean, it's more like, I'm not a raffle expert at all. What? Why would we when? Why would we do something more like, start on the evening and be like, raffle tickets. Are you raffle tickets for or whatever, some kind of discount. Get them to spend money in some get them to find the wallet a little bit. Yeah, just a $5

Speaker 4  30:46
bill for cheap, and as the evening goes on, or yeah, go that

Speaker 5  30:49
direction, right? I don't know. I don't know if there's something like that. It's just you. I mean, this is kind of like a plastic marketing thing, but somebody who spends $1 is worth 100 times more than somebody that has been anything. And so if you can just get them to crack a wallet somewhere, makes everything easier.

Speaker 4  31:10
That's the idea that you get them to get them to start

Unknown Speaker  31:13
buying, yeah,

Speaker 5  31:21
even something crazy like it literally could be just a crazy, like, human, yeah, whatever, some crazy good, irresistible offer to spend some money at the beginning, yeah? But then have the actual sign at the table, and have somebody there taking money for raffle tickets, and have that be double what you get at the entrance.

Speaker 1  31:49
I think that raffle was really cool, though. I to me. It blessed my heart. Steve, who got that raffle ticket, he's going to bring his whole

Speaker 7  31:59
community next year the computer. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:01
they

Speaker 1  32:06
use computers up there, but I thought about asset he wants to sell.

Speaker 2  32:15
It was it because I was pregnant, even like the hillside, I guess they call Were any of those? Owen was okay because, like, there's a couple contractors that we work for, and one of the young guys gave me an email address just months of show, Joe said that we'd start emailing his invoices to them from the hillside, not from the west. So they're doing more and more.

Unknown Speaker  32:52
Yeah, they must have been the ones

Unknown Speaker  32:54
that hadn't split.

Speaker 4  33:00
So we got around 30 to 35 of these back. These were the

Unknown Speaker  33:06
peels, which, I

Speaker 4  33:09
apologize but bought them raffle tickets and got them to donate 50 bucks or 300 bucks. It was just a way for them to check a box and donate. And so we made something off this, but we can probably expand it next year. How it works.

Unknown Speaker  33:28
Anybody do the old QR code donate? Or do you know

Speaker 1  33:34
there might be a couple $1,000 sitting there somewhere? What do you know about true? Please, yes, that was cool. Though I like making it easy for people to

Unknown Speaker  33:51
donate QuickBooks reports,

Speaker 4  33:57
I can try to upload it, but they just did so confusing.

Unknown Speaker  34:05
I mean,

Speaker 4  34:07
for this year, yeah, so those two numbers is basically what we had at the end of the day.

Unknown Speaker  34:12
I think 78,000 ish, what?

Speaker 5  34:20
Why not? No. I mean, we would have, had we, this would have been Saturday, yeah, 78,000 little over. 78,000 1000. Saturday, 58 table sponsors,

Unknown Speaker  34:34
auction sponsors, showing at 58

Unknown Speaker  34:37
we've never, had, never had

Unknown Speaker  34:39
that much

Unknown Speaker  34:42
may not have to look at exactly what it's

Speaker 1  34:44
what I don't understand. The auction sponsorships keeps getting so high. Where's my auction doing better every year, which this year did a little bit, but, but we had a 10 with $11,000 donation, donation, pretty much so without that, you know, that's what we normally get. We would bump us right back to our normal numbers.

Speaker 5  35:05
Do you know how many people work their butts off for years to get an auction in higher population areas, to get an auction that's just marginally better than us, like Catlett netted 125, I was talking to a guy in Pennsylvania. Murder. They didn't August school auction. They they let netted net flow, six figures. And both of those places have been going for years and years, and they're sitting in places that have money, and admittedly, they've got a lot more auctions to compete against. But no, I agree

Speaker 1  35:38
people say our auctions as well. Like, I've talked to other people at nonprofit, nonprofit options, school options, especially, and people say, maybe your auction actually does really well. My question was, if we're 50, if we got 58,000 this year and we got $40,000 last year, like, why? Worse, something isn't quite adding up, our numbers should be higher because we should have more product, more money leftover section. It's kind of like Canyon City. Money comes in. Where's it go? Last year we only got like 40,000 we're

Speaker 4  36:12
organizing it a little. We're condensing we're bringing our numbers together more accurately than we ever have to, like the 10,000 that that we get in Haiti probably wasn't in that.

Unknown Speaker  36:27
What's that 15,000

Unknown Speaker  36:28
it was, I mean, it was always included in

Unknown Speaker  36:32
there. Did we get a check for 50,000

Speaker 1  36:38
because we've done the auction for years for between 20 to $30,000 brought in by sponsors. I bet that includes some Friday night stuff.

Unknown Speaker  36:50
To 20,000

Speaker 1  36:53
because we have tables, if we have 50, there needs to be money left. This is, this is a pretty loose

Unknown Speaker  37:03
report. He said

Speaker 1  37:05
it sounds like it probably down closer to 40 that 15,007

Unknown Speaker  37:11
July, 19, but

Speaker 5  37:14
it looks like the same person that wrote the $10,000 check, sequential numbers. I don't know if it means anything. It looks like three checks, written

Unknown Speaker  37:24
checks, for sure. Is that like

Unknown Speaker  37:26
a quick is that a QuickBooks ID?

Unknown Speaker  37:29
I don't, I don't think that's check actually.

Unknown Speaker  37:33
I can spend a little bit time figure out, did we get

Unknown Speaker  37:36
15,000 that's a that's what

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Lauren got together in PA. That was the money he got together

Unknown Speaker  37:43
for us. Yeah, we got a $10,000 check and another we had about 30,000 just in Pennsylvania.

Unknown Speaker  37:49
And we'll have to see where it comes out to we might have, we might have a

Unknown Speaker  37:54
couple 1000 left,

Unknown Speaker  37:56
30,000 in Pennsylvania. Ish

Speaker 4  37:59
thought Lauren had got like 15, besides Mr. King no

Unknown Speaker  38:06
15, including, we

Unknown Speaker  38:11
don't have to dig into that right now

Unknown Speaker  38:18
for Friday night.

Unknown Speaker  38:21
This appeals

Unknown Speaker  38:37
for Friday night. Two more things I'd like to touch on.

Speaker 4  38:41
One is pretty simple, a child care. I didn't hear anything negative about it. So I'm assuming this something we do again, is there something that needs to be

Unknown Speaker  38:51
addressed regarding it?

Speaker 1  38:55
I would suppose, like, I like hearing that coordinator putting somebody in charge of all that, and then they're responsible talk with I think it was a little bit loose my daughter, yeah, she was in the bounce band people. Somebody jumped down top of her. And I just think maybe they should have it sound like it was pretty wild out there, maybe just a little more superficial. His first time. Who cares? It was, was good, but yeah, and I would, I would vote next time. Hey, let's make a list of these things that, and the serving and some of that here. This is your cup of tea that we don't have to worry about.

Speaker 5  39:40
I think it's hard for, I don't know, for some of these young kids, it's hard to be bad play, play back up out there. And there was, there were also times when even Tony to play back up running, some of the volunteers jumping ahead, but it wasn't even always supervising. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:01
that's why they signed a waiver, too. Kids

Speaker 5  40:10
are not liable, saying that one next year we do not sell an insurance.

Speaker 1  40:20
But we also could probably do a better job of advertising that if we wanted,

Speaker 1  40:31
anyway, just feel more relaxing for us to get a babysitter.

Speaker 4  40:35
So we just got a babysitter my kids, opportunity can find us.

Speaker 4  40:46
Okay, so this one's pretty major, Friday night east of the brew seats. And now we brainstormed it, and we decided that at least the expenses for Friday night could come out of Friday night. We didn't really propose exactly what would happen with the proceeds.

Unknown Speaker  41:14
Two points I think I would make is that

Speaker 3  41:21
I'd like to whatever we do. I think we need to skyline as our legal entity. We need to be clear with it. And the other thing, if we do want to save it for operating expenses, I I'm not opposed to that, but it's personally it's probably not my first I don't know

Unknown Speaker  41:54
I was thinking that, and this is just my opinion. I'm not saying it as a this

Unknown Speaker  42:04
is the way it should go. I hesitate to keep the funds

Speaker 3  42:09
for operating expenses, and maybe it's just because of the backlash we're going to get from the recipients,

Unknown Speaker  42:21
whatever you call them, beneficiaries,

Speaker 3  42:24
but if we want to think of it that way and propose it, I'm open to it.

Speaker 5  42:31
It's an easy pitch. Take what We gave them last year. Bump it up, which I don't know. What did they what was it? What did we know last

Unknown Speaker  42:40
year? 72 72

Speaker 5  42:43
I don't know how much you're looking to hang on to give them five extra grand. We bumped it up. And then, by the way, next year is going to be big. We promised it was going to be bigger and better. Did we deliver? Yes or no. Okay, fine. We deliver. Next year is going to be bigger and better. And better. And here's the here's the only way we know how to do it. Here's where we get we get screwed over every single time we go shopping. We get full retail for everything. Why? Because we have sponsors. We have money to spend. We want 10 grand to spend for Black Friday deals. And we're going to go buy up and we're going to get stuff at a 3% discount instantly, that money is going to turn around and make you more money. So you're going to get going to get it next year. So it's a bump from next year. We're trying to be generous. We're going to we're going to set some stuff aside, but we actually need this so that we can make next year be a better year. Yeah, that's my pitch, and I don't know, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  43:38
you guys kind of in line with that.

Speaker 2  43:40
I had any other ideas. I had a couple of guys asked me, Well, what's going to happen with money? I told them, we haven't really decided for sure yet, but at least one guy did mention that we were thinking, you know, operating expense would be really nice to keep a little back. And he was right away, he was like, well, that's just business.

Unknown Speaker  44:04
Not, yeah, it

Unknown Speaker  44:07
is great. Yeah, the barrel every, every year

Unknown Speaker  44:10
from our donors, yeah, to

Unknown Speaker  44:11
just get operating fund going, we're shooting ourselves.

Speaker 2  44:15
And I and I think you're, you're right. I mean, coming from the other actions that we did, if we can buy more stuff at a discount instead of paying retail, it's also going to boost,

Speaker 4  44:27
like Julian said, our 10,000 can turn into 40,000 instead of taking 50,000 turning to 70,000

Speaker 1  44:37
Now, I love that idea too. Honestly, I you know, as far as people are concerned, hey, it's going to school, it's going to safe, but we could leverage it this year to get a head start for next year. I'd like the idea of black Friday's, man. Well, you could, that would be a fun shopping experience, right there, to go Black Friday, snag stuff. The other thing is, if we could use part of it and like, Get a side by side or a four wheeler on a deal, come into the year and then start a raffle for that we can give away at the auction, I think would be phenomenal. Or even have a bigger item or two, like the four wheeler or side by side at the auction, it's good. You're going to get your money back out of it. Maybe you get more return Black Friday, but you'd bring more people to to have some big items. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:36
I would love to hear, can we

Speaker 1  45:38
I'd love to hear you were talking to some people about that side by side raffle. Let's say we use some of the funds to do a side by side raffle. I would love to hear how they did that

Speaker 2  45:49
and their returns. Yeah. I need to, I need to call Keith and get more on he's, he's head of the board right now, 80,000 on a raffle that would be

Speaker 8  46:01
next level, yeah, across several months, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  46:09
but I don't know exactly, and I just, Lori just told me, because Keith lawyer asked me, we want to buy tickets. It's it goes, anybody can buy it's not, it's not Holmes county that can buy goes all over and it's QR code, and the present the winner, no. And somehow they sell it really cheap. It seems like

Unknown Speaker  46:35
crazy. Number of Tickets, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:37
So where you say

Speaker 2  46:38
it's kind of confusing, like, how many that's that's something I want to talk to Keith about and find out exactly

Speaker 4  46:45
how they do that. So they might have 5000 tickets out there. Yeah,

Speaker 2  46:50
it sounds like more than that, probably because they're talking like, 25 bucks a ticket. You know, usually on the site is like, or something, you're talking about ticket, and somehow they're doing it for Wei G, but it's a volume of tickets that they're selling that's bringing it up. Okay, that was last year. Was 80,000 right now they're doing a raffle for this year and the the auction, and the time that they raffling it off, they do the raffle then at the auction. But that's the end of October. Here you get us a

Speaker 4  47:25
link to that ticket, whatever they sell, yeah, and then we could at least watch it if it's online.

Unknown Speaker  47:33
Yeah? Other, other

Speaker 1  47:36
friends, I'm just wondering. You know, imagine the hype you get, giving away $20,000

Unknown Speaker  47:44
year round.

Speaker 1  47:45
Yeah, imagine you're the one who wins it. I mean, you're gonna be so excited for

Speaker 2  47:50
next year. Do you know Bert and Mary from I don't they won against I mean, it stayed right in the school district. That's that. It's amazing. You saw 85 they're not usually you wouldn't think it would stay at homes County, but it did.

Speaker 3  48:08
Yeah. Final numbers, well,

Speaker 4  48:16
I had tried to get the cash number out of that, but the closest item is like 78 plus the cash and Matt lab had estimated

Unknown Speaker  48:24
five to 7000

Speaker 4  48:26
but I'm not seeing it on the report, like, actually, whatever came into the cash boxes, whether it was like checks or

Unknown Speaker  48:34
green cash

Unknown Speaker  48:37
that wouldn't have come through the

Unknown Speaker  48:38
app, is what, basically I'm saying, What

Unknown Speaker  48:42
are you finding out?

Speaker 1  48:51
I would like to see some more clarity on numbers, funds coming in, funds going out. I hmm, somehow, somehow, somehow, we need to have a bit, we need to keep better track of that. I literally, I trust everybody here. It's not that. It's I just like having clarity, because in my mind, I compare stuff to other options in like hell, if there's more money coming in, then we should be doing a larger, larger auction. Because, yeah, quite frankly, if we got $58,000, in I'm actually it's not as good of the auction as I was hoping. It would be forgot if, obviously, those numbers will not understand. Yes, I would actually be disappointed if that's the money, because I considered a record breaking auction, quite frankly, for the amount of product that we had, and the crowd size and everything, it's actually the best option we have had. We've had one that brought more money before, but as I told some of you on the phone, you know it, but that year, we had some two rich Grandpas from Pennsylvania. They were buying like $5,000 barrels for grandsons. And that cornhole board, there was a nice Colorado one there sold for three grand, right? And somebody donated like $5,000 worth of hay. And the people that donated it ended up buying it and then re donating it back. And so sold again. And so we just had money on top of money, flying

Speaker 4  50:21
whatever. That 58,000 is the last 15, 18,000 I don't know what. I don't know where it's coming from. That, According to my

Speaker 1  50:30
calculation, I think something's awful. But I'd like to have more clarity as we're,

Unknown Speaker  50:38
as we are, yeah,

Speaker 1  50:41
donating money. I mean, because his money's donated, money's coming in. And I, quite frankly, I'm very torn between about the funds for Friday night. I I would be with Caleb. What Caleb said, I I'm a little, I'm a little hesitant about the about the the flat, the flat we get people been mentioning that Josh announced in church it'll get over $100,000 and they're like, oh, deal

Unknown Speaker  51:14
that our

Unknown Speaker  51:15
one sent out 725,000 Yeah.

Speaker 1  51:19
And then we're not where they got those, because they're inflated, because the breakdown, the breakdown is actually at 100,000 you know, canyon that takes the schools down 10% they're cut down 10% at 100,000

Unknown Speaker  51:37
after 100,000 or From 50 and above the

Speaker 1  51:41
first 50k they get 75% right then, once we hit 50k they get 65% once we had 100k they get 55% 150, 50 and it so it's some, in some ways it would almost be better for them. Find that calculator today, oh, I got it. I went to a meeting way back in 2018 so the group I screenshot.

Speaker 4  52:09
I never quite understood that whole thing. And I know we want to clarify, but it's not talking about the whole lump sum, though, talking about from 50 to 100,000 that gets divided differently.

Unknown Speaker  52:21
I thought it was a long sum. No,

Speaker 5  52:24
it's it's stacked, it's tiered. So the first this much you get, it gets put this way, and then that. So you're never losing money. It's just once if we once a million dollars higher school loses out proportion, fortunately, but it's all

Speaker 1  52:40
good up until that level. So just to set the record straight, though, I think the church and everyone for all their contributions, and I said, you know, we had a great weekend. We, you know, between the two events, made nearly $100,000 in my word. See, people take that, because somebody today told me that you said 100,000 so people here,

Unknown Speaker  53:03
he did say the words 100,000

Speaker 4  53:06
Yeah, so the app and I took it on now, but the app had a scale on it that said goal, 133,000 and it said we got 125 said we almost never go. The numbers that we had punched in there were pretty accurate, but we almost reached him, but that's, I think, maybe where we got his but, and that doesn't all get divided up. We raised those funds, but the expenses did come out of that. That's another

Unknown Speaker  53:36
I did. I think I took it off from the front end now. But whatever we do

Speaker 1  53:42
whatever we need to do. We did we need to make. We need to make a decision on that tonight. And it needs to be clear to the school board,

Unknown Speaker  53:50
very clear,

Speaker 1  53:51
because I would put money on it, that there's some people on the school board that already had numbers on $120,000

Speaker 5  54:01
my proposal is that I think this fastest thing to get it cleared up is Caleb, who stand call and just tucks him through it. But unless there should be somebody else doing it, that's somebody here, so

Speaker 4  54:16
the only reason I hesitate to do that is because, as of that meeting I had with all the higher ups, I did not report

Unknown Speaker  54:24
to stand. Oh, good point I report to, I report

Speaker 4  54:28
to, basically Nelson or skyline, okay, and so I feel like that was a breakthrough this year. And the other thing I feel like we broke through might be abstract or conceptual, is that we showed them. We showed them. We're willing to keep the tears the same, but we're willing to grow and we're willing to take their advice, and we did it successfully. And I don't think anybody, I don't think anybody has bad feelings about that. Think we're all we're all happy for that. So I will, I will put a proposal together and but I do want our consensus on what

Unknown Speaker  55:09
that is.

Speaker 1  55:13
So for me, personally, I would be with Josh as far as what I want to do. I'm being 100% transparent. My fear of man would bring it back.

Speaker 4  55:21
And that's what, that's what I was trying to communicate to mostly a fear of, what's

Speaker 5  55:27
that proposal? We give them just the auction money. We keep the Friday night money as operating right?

Speaker 1  55:34
What if we gave them? Let's say, let's say we gave them 80 grand, a little bit of more than last year, and kept 15 back to or whatever the Friday night was, back to invest and say, hey, look, we think we can really expand this till next year with this ring, a head start on the Black Friday items and this stuff. I would have to think people would think that's a good steward. And then next year maybe we can give it to say, look, here's a bonus for your building plan that you're looking to do. I don't know I I'd love to, if we're growing and expanding it, I'd love for them to have goals and see where it's going actually, to be honest with you, and let's know, like, Hey, you have a goal to raise 100,000 for a building next year. Well, then let's know so we can go after people for like, don't I just love to know. I'd love to push them a little more for some of that.

Speaker 2  56:27
But I think, like, we're talking holding back 15,000 this year, I think next year, then we'd be careful. We don't start getting greedy. We keep maybe 15 to 20 so. But we were basically just keeping what we kept this year. We're not every year's taking more and

Speaker 1  56:52
more, dude, if we make, I'm serious, we make 50,000 next year. We can turn that 50 grand into 150 real quick.

Speaker 4  57:02
Yeah, if we structure it rather than amounts, yeah, the

Unknown Speaker  57:07
percentage,

Speaker 4  57:09
percentages or or even the thing that Friday night funds are fluid for our operating expenses.

Speaker 5  57:17
Some of that is just curbed by anticipated growth, we're not literally looking at triple, but adding 20% or 30% on 15 grand for next year, or, you know, whatever.

Speaker 4  57:30
Okay, so are we? What I'm hearing our consensus is that we would basically propose

Unknown Speaker  57:39
our Friday night income would roll over to to if

Speaker 3  57:47
we can prove that to our higher ups, not to the beneficiaries, but to

Speaker 4  57:54
then we would use that for operating expenses, and if They simply say no, then we'll just Give it to

Unknown Speaker  58:06
it so you can't

Speaker 6  58:22
is, I'll try to put something together,

Unknown Speaker  58:27
a best contract

Speaker 4  58:29
I agree with the thing of keeping track of the funds better. That was my desire with, like some of the sponsorship forms that we've done and the spreadsheets for some reason, like we get verbal commitments checks, and then we get Pennsylvania stuff, and we get and I just struggle, like actually keeping it updated. So I don't know if we do use hand bid, it might give us a channel to bring everything together better. If we put our sponsorships in there, we put our product in there, I don't know, but I'm with you. I want to, want to get more organized, more active on the numbers.

Speaker 2  59:18
Well, I know like, like Nevin had told me, yeah, he's gonna give for someone the same and then I put it in right away. Should we? Should we not put numbers in until we have to check?

Speaker 4  59:33
I would think he'd put them in right away and then made their market paid or not paid, but somebody, some of us are doing it right away, and some of

Speaker 2  59:41
us weren't, yeah, and then it gets confused, yeah, right.

Speaker 4  59:46
And then Mark would get a checker on the back, and we didn't know if it got paid.

Speaker 5  59:51
So yes, it wouldn't be for Sale Auction. I would totally just build the system for next year that knows everything. And and silent election thing is the

Speaker 6  1:00:04
only thing silent auction can go to paper. And then let's, let's negotiate a deal with a payment

Speaker 5  1:00:10
processor that gets us something better than straight. And there's you can get a percent bump your auction by percent, 1% 1% maybe

Speaker 2  1:00:26
that's another thing that legacy did for a couple years. They they did online and auction. And this year they went back to completely auction, no online, except for that raffle that they're doing. They just, they said, it just felt like there's so much work, like you're almost doing two options, yeah? And that's kind of what I'm hearing about, the hand

Speaker 5  1:00:51
bit, yeah. We ran into, well, yeah, hand bit is just,

Speaker 4  1:00:57
we don't have any skin in the game with them anymore. Like it was, like a one year thing. And I think we can use it. It could maybe run a raffle. If we do a like a raffle thing, it can maybe help us run something

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
like that.

Speaker 5  1:01:20
Look, this is just the perfect softball pitch kind of system, like we've done for BBs. I think we have proof that we can nail fast check ins. So, I mean, it's a little nerve wracking, yeah, but it's totally within the realm of,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
yeah. Yeah, it's just,

Speaker 3  1:01:45
it's making the, you know, you know how to put it together. But if we can, if we could bring our check ins, our

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
sponsorships and our product into a streamline. That's not all that much

Speaker 5  1:02:04
better, really. And Beth would be able to enter all of her live auctions just spreadsheet format, but have it all linked out, bad and easy?

Speaker 1  1:02:14
Yes, I would. And then you could sell the program once we're done. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
there you go.

Speaker 1  1:02:22
She would like to have most of the products in the system before the options ever started. If she can think she would do on her own, if she keeps

Unknown Speaker  1:02:32
so she could,

Speaker 4  1:02:36
if we Nate suggested that we would do that for the special items so that the catalog can be built exactly. And if we, if we expand it a little bit like we are already do Thursday setup, you would have that much more time cushion between the setup and the option to work on some of that be amazing.

Speaker 5  1:02:59
Could you literally set the could you literally do a full auction sold in order from start to finish? She's really not gonna have any auctions. You could actually be able to use the bathroom.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:18
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
if you get some people involved that have that knack for Order, order the product,

Speaker 5  1:03:29
you can literally then snap pictures to before and throw it into a slideshow and have all that be Travis, be

Speaker 1  1:03:44
we I gotta leave soon after 630 yeah, there's some stuff I'd like

Unknown Speaker  1:03:52
options. I don't want to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:55
right now. I'm just saying, like, Yeah, I

Speaker 3  1:03:58
think we're done with Friday. I gotta put that proposal together. Hand bed software was on the list. But let's just move into Saturday. We have kind of dissected the hand bid thing. Go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:04:13
No, I have 15 minutes left. No, go ahead. I'm processing.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
No, okay. You need some time.

Speaker 4  1:04:22
I sense the general consensus on hand is up in the air. We don't

Speaker 3  1:04:27
have any special love for them at this point, besides our

Unknown Speaker  1:04:37
pace event and people trained in a little bit more.

Speaker 3  1:04:51
I mentioned using Thursday for setup. I think the no brainer, center available Thursday,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:59
yeah, for sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:04
Can you? Can you program my whatsapp groups into your software?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10
That's beside the point. Now

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
there's be thinking about

Unknown Speaker  1:05:15
that. We We had a lot of complaints about that this year. Had some major issues.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
In some ways. I'm surprised we did as well as we did

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
on amounts with how much

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
this question. Well, stuff happened because

Speaker 7  1:05:31
everybody paid more. Paid more upfront, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:05:35
nobody paid more the option than they thought. They did. 3000 Oh, yeah, just take another bid. I had this $150 item. I could not figure out what I purchased in freaking this was the hand bid, not. The auctioneers could not let you do 50 cents. Yeah, is there's more. So I gave $3.50 for something or 30 No, $35 or whatever charge 350 yes, you're kidding. I'm serious, you get so great.

Speaker 4  1:06:06
I mean, whatever 257 bucks is worth messing with for me, but

Speaker 1  1:06:13
it it is for me too. But the thing is, just, it's whole thing, and figured out, get a chair, yeah, and then I forgot just hungry food, and didn't pay for it once. It's just a little water bottles so stuff like that. So I was going to add about 20 bucks on to cover some of that. And so I'm like, well, just whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
It's not okay.

Speaker 1  1:06:39
But there's you might hear that again.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:43
So what else we can look into that?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:49
Who is on the action here?

Speaker 7  1:06:52
So it was Nathaniel. But the week before I found out, and I know I didn't

Speaker 4  1:06:57
communicate this well with you guys, I found out he was bringing some other guys, because his normal guys were

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
and I, I didn't know what to do about it,

Speaker 6  1:07:04
but I should have at least told you guys. He said he's bringing a couple different guys instead of the ones he brought last year. Okay, that was, like, a couple days before the option so T Amish guys. We don't

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
know which one which

Speaker 3  1:07:22
word, doesn't matter what religion they were. But anyways, different guys, one of them, Josh, tried to stop being at 2000 he got by the

Speaker 1  1:07:35
guy looking at me. I went to anyone at somebody else my 500 I said, No. Next day I know, Hey, guy in black shirt sold 3000 I'm like, Dude, I wasn't on it. Like, what in the world? I don't know if the guy couldn't see or what, but,

Speaker 9  1:07:50
and the same thing happened on the other bike. And then she wanted to bid something way up, and they cut her off, and she wanted to go on it. But so she was, she kind of wanted it,

Speaker 1  1:08:08
the mug. I bid the money up to 200 bucks and stopped, and somehow I got it for $300

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
you didn't actually get

Speaker 1  1:08:14
the mug. I actually, personally, I got the money. Yeah, but I, I clearly shook my head at 200 bucks, and

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
that is not okay.

Speaker 1  1:08:24
Somebody asked me, whatever happened to the Garber brothers. I forget who it was. Was asking me about that. I did ask. I literally got asked that at least. But like I tell people, are we going to pay $6,000 for 1500

Speaker 5  1:08:40
Well, at this point, I think, I mean, this year does kind of make things look a

Speaker 2  1:08:46
little different. But like, I know I've got guys that would be willing to come, but what we ran into when I tried to get one of them is, you know, politics, yeah, they don't want to step on on toes out here.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:01
We can tell them we're not getting them. We have,

Speaker 1  1:09:03
yeah, we have other options too. Yeah, I

Speaker 4  1:09:06
don't mind. He Himself does a decent job at auctioneering. Did he make errors like that or not?

Speaker 9  1:09:17
No, and I was gonna be hard, so I'm not trying to

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
pick on them. It's fine. Was it the life jacket that you bought?

Speaker 1  1:09:33
Yeah, I think for $35.03 I'm trying 25 bucks. What was it supposed to be? 30? It was $325 so it was supposed to be $32.50

Unknown Speaker  1:09:47
Okay, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:09:54
some of their financial back end is horrible, like that. Can't have 50 cents.

Speaker 1  1:10:07
No, them guys should not have been selling stuff for 50 cents. I knew. I told my like they were like, 30. So I backed out. I didn't set back down. I was like, Well, I don't want this because I thought they were like, way, way higher. Like, what's he at? This doesn't make any sense. So, and you don't sell cents at an auction. That is a huge that really upset me, too. They were doing that. But then on the bikes, they were jumping 500 bucks.

Speaker 9  1:10:37
Jump 100 once you get auction here.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
What else did you have for Saturday?

Speaker 1  1:10:44
Honestly, it slipped me, so it's not important, but I need to check back for the difference. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
Overall. The entire auction.

Speaker 1  1:11:06
Quite frankly, the thing I was the most disappointed in was hand bid. Believe it or not, even I was even more disappointed by hand bid than I was the auctioneers. I was a little disappointed. I'm being I'm being very blunt, okay, I was a little disappointed that our auction team could handle the hand bid a little bit better, and why my wife had to be out on the phone Friday night figuring some of this stuff out. And I was like, I said, it's not your job. I was like, just let them take care of it. And she's like, well, nobody else wants to or will, or whatever. So we need to. We need to, it doesn't have to be her. We need to bring somebody on that can be a little bit more organized and help organize some of this stuff a little bit more, and can take responsibility on some stuff or whatever. I don't know there was something that was just missing. And I can't quite lay hands on it. I didn't this year, even myself. I didn't pull my weight this year. I don't know what the deal was. I felt out of the loop quite a bit this year as well. There was just something missing, just a little bit there. And I literally am not blaming anybody. It was just, I kind of look at the thing as an overall hole with the whole hand bid thing. And we had Matthias involved, and you involved, I'm talking about hand bid specifically. And then Beth kind of involved. And she's like, well, I probably got more involved. I should have, I shouldn't have, maybe got some involved. And did I push my way in? Was I asked to participate, or did I volunteer? Did you volunteer? We're just kind of trying to work through some of that stuff. So I'm not saying you're pointing fingers Exactly. I'm just kind of talking the overall thing, and I don't want to see that happening in next year, like, I don't care my wife gets involved that and makes phone call, whatever. But if she's gonna be that involved, I personally feel probably be part of the auction thing or something. I don't know if I want her to even honestly, it's a decision we have to figure out and make, I guess. But I just there there's enough stuff that we either pushed our way in on and know too much to get ourselves into trouble that we need to back off a little bit, or either we're picking up stuff that other people are just missing, or something. Am I making sense? Yeah, there just needs to be some kind of a little bit of clarity there, or something. We, we love the option. Honestly. I, I love, I love doing stuff for the option the day of and like, product stuff, but, but this year was kind of confusing, and we're like, man, we just need to back away from the entire thing, because, and not, you know, not, not do, Maybe not even involved. Just, just let maybe run smoothly away from something. So that's kind of my that's kind of the demo that's going on in our minds a little bit, because we do care about the auction. I do want to see it successful. And it was a huge encouragement for me, just the overall thing, because towards success, towards growing it more. So I'm just saying i i am 100% willing to step back from this auction indefinitely for a year or two. I don't really care. I just felt like this last year, something was missing, somewhere, somehow, and if it means that you need to come have a chat with me, we need to figure some stuff out. I'm totally fine with that as well, because, yeah, appreciating a little bit of sense, I'm kind of unloading my heart a little bit.

Speaker 4  1:15:01
No, I would say it's a couple things. One is quite

Unknown Speaker  1:15:06
a bit of growth in one year, yeah, one is for the

Speaker 4  1:15:12
of some of the details coming together Friday night, especially like that shouldn't have I mean, I don't know exactly how I would I knew that was my biggest stress point. Didn't know how to fix it. I didn't know who to get to run it, but I'm not trying to shift it. I'm saying I reckon that was that should never happen again, but some of it wasn't software, but

Unknown Speaker  1:15:42
exactly

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
I forget what the issue was that Beth was taken care of, but we,

Speaker 4  1:15:48
we all made calls to them that night, the three of us that were on the handed support calls and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
But by the time check in was

Speaker 4  1:15:59
happening, my brain was so fried, I wasn't good as much, and so I apologize for

Speaker 1  1:16:04
that. Well, that's what you have to recommend, a little part of use. Yes, have to put people in place or something, so that you have a little more capacity to I don't believe in bringing fried. Mine will let the chat before you, but you did, I mean, you guys, yeah, on the

Speaker 5  1:16:25
software side of things, I never found out about Silent Auction thing until it was all said and done and over. I had no problem battling people's chains when it comes to these types of things. And I will like the software, like the I mean, I think the call from Beth was the Senate auction, and so I did that multiple times on Saturday with Sarah. She's really rolling her eyes. Yeah, I think, I think there is a manpower issue as well. I I really, really like, I know we don't tend to get into it. But I really like the idea of bringing couples in, expanding the committee to having spouses join the committee, where they're open to I just maybe that's even on our end. Easy way

Speaker 3  1:17:24
talk more in depth in the next meeting. Be thinking about that. Maybe have conversations with your wife. I felt like our wives were all way more involved than ever.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:39
Beth has always been involved as all that way she went above

Speaker 3  1:17:45
and beyond on his sponsorship stuff, and I wish she would have more clarity up front to just

Speaker 4  1:17:57
be able to do it more empowered, I guess, is what I'm saying.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
So that's a huge appreciation

Speaker 6  1:18:05
from the committee for all the all the pieces she pulled together.

Speaker 1  1:18:12
Overall, she's, she's happy about everything. It's not like we're saying, right about all. It's just, it was stuff that we're processing, trying to figure out, yeah, yeah. You tell her, thank you. You know, I was even blessed, like she was getting the stuff together for the tables. And I felt I felt bad because I didn't know if anyone was doing I was trying to do it. But one thing I'm thinking about, and like this software, this is cool. We're trying to solve it wasn't your fault. That was glitching, but I think it'd be nice next year. Hey, Brad kimballer, somebody that had some charge. It's one headache off your plate. And honestly, the board members should be able to be there and enjoy the evening. If there's a problem, then take care of it. We shouldn't all have to have jobs. Honestly, that would be my takeaway. No jobs or no specific Well, it'd be nice if everything was managed particularly.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:14
Yeah, maybe I'm wrong, but Well,

Speaker 3  1:19:23
right? I'd asked him if he'd run this software, and he was didn't feel like he'd be able this year. He offered to really run next year.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
So we'll keep him

Speaker 3  1:19:37
penciled in for that. But no, I appreciate all this

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
working with you guys

Speaker 3  1:19:47
that have big visions and are able to stretch things and make things growing so

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
reported, yeah. So

Speaker 2  1:20:18
like Beth is typing in everything during the auction, putting all the prices down, everything is there ways that and process this item the next year, right? And because it did not, that's something we tried to get the Haiti option. I threw some

Unknown Speaker  1:20:39
exports onto the Google right in there.

Speaker 9  1:20:41
Under the Google manually, just have her license, if it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:53
consistently was a good those types of things.

Speaker 9  1:20:58
Yeah, just, just to give us a little feeling,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:09
if we could have it, where we could look at

Speaker 5  1:21:11
it, yeah, just take this picture, create a copy

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
some of it we don't

Speaker 1  1:21:19
have, because that's what Beth wants to do. So we got a bunch of props. Product from, I mean, all the stuff we have Pennsylvania, what receipts for? So she wants to go in and add all the products into the system, and that way we won't be able to tell everything, because, you know, somebody donates a drill set last minute. We can't type, we won't put that in. And the amount we paid for stuff we actually paid for in the system. When it pulls up Beth, we gave $200 for it, and Beth puts in we sold it for, you know, 190 bucks, or two or $25 and that way you kind of get a little bit of fuel, yeah, for stuff is out, because right now it's just going by our brains, honestly, quite frankly, mine, because I've been there the longest we tried to sell those.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03
And it's kind of, yeah, yeah, okay.

Speaker 3  1:22:11
Kind of keep those issues back your mind.

Speaker 9  1:22:16
You guys good with breaking till being here, type of thing

Unknown Speaker  1:22:22
we might have to

Unknown Speaker  1:22:25
have to communicate something

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26
the proposal for

Speaker 9  1:22:28
payout, but we can probably do that On

Unknown Speaker  1:22:33
so January,

Speaker 10  1:22:38
I was waiting for you to bring that up.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
That's not

Speaker 1  1:22:45
on the agenda. That's like we're bringing that's on the agenda another two years.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:51
What is on the agenda is the Constitution, and I'm about to add

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
some amendments that Josh has a five year term.

Speaker 1  1:23:02
I was just curious, though. I was thinking it

Unknown Speaker  1:23:14
was a two year term.

Speaker 2  1:23:15
For two years, you just get your you're just getting to roll, and then you get off.

Speaker 1  1:23:24
I'm just saying. I was just curious what that is, just so I know, yeah, and I don't want to overstay my welcome for sure either. Well, you

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
haven't crossed that line yet, as far as I'm concerned. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:43
it there is that thing of

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45
new blood being good for

Speaker 2  1:23:49
like chaos was eight years that I thought was long Julian's there, he knows. Or you're over 89

Speaker 1  1:24:00
this year, this year you had them, you had a better feel for everything this year, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:04
Yes. So,

Speaker 1  1:24:08
I mean, I I think community members should be on for a few years, at least, because the first year they got to kind of get in and get a feel for things and all that. For this thing to be successful, they have to be in a little longer, I'm not saying eight years, but

Speaker 3  1:24:23
I thought it was four years. Maybe it was,

Speaker 6  1:24:29
maybe it was based on position two, I don't know, but a request, but that shows how unorganized or

Speaker 1  1:24:37
metals funny miss out on. There's no stress with this job at all.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
We go go karting.

Speaker 1  1:24:48
Seriously, I'm having fun. I just, I was trying to figure

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
that out. Yeah,

Speaker 6  1:24:54
that's something I do have to work on. Is the Constitution too? I mean, I don't want to, but who else is going to do it?

Speaker 1  1:25:02
Julian, you want to work on the constitution that is way outside of my way. I don't

Speaker 5  1:25:07
want to do it solo. But if you want to do a morning knock it out of your breakfast kind of thing, I'm

Speaker 2  1:25:19
I'm open institutions. Going to be board members cannot be absent.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:27
Yourself in the foot, yeah. Finally, we figured out a way, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:36
12th or 19th,

Speaker 6  1:25:40
and I might throw a date out yet for this, for doing a supper or something this fall. Think it'd be fun to just get together.

Speaker 5  1:25:48
12th is better than, for me, than the 19th.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:50
But if I need when the house is done, I'd say, let's have everybody out.

Speaker 10  1:26:00
Josh must be planning to come off, because you don't even look at his calendar.

Speaker 1  1:26:06
I have a poor schedule. I'm around because the only thing I'm waiting for is Christmas. I don't schedule all that for you, though.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:15
I'm good to go. I'm pretty sure

Unknown Speaker  1:26:19
he said January.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:22
I'd like to pencil it

Unknown Speaker  1:26:23
in that way visit it.

Speaker 6  1:26:24
Yeah, right away. We can. We can re post going if we have to, but

Unknown Speaker  1:26:32
Josh, I, I don't strongly encourage you to stay on if you can, because you

Speaker 1  1:26:39
for real. You bring it. You bring a different you brought a different aspect that we have needed and do need, just, you know, not saying that butter you up. That's just straight facts. So if you can at all find it in you to hang in there, though, however many years, at

Unknown Speaker  1:26:57
least four years or something, would it would be highly appreciated like

Speaker 3  1:27:03
So wait, you carried on the Friday night

Unknown Speaker  1:27:08
was heavy this year, but

Speaker 3  1:27:10
the value that it brought us bigger than express appreciation,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:14
I don't downplay. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:19
we honestly appreciate

Unknown Speaker  1:27:20
that vision, and I

Speaker 1  1:27:21
want to say guys honestly, because I love you guys, it's fun working with you guys. You bring you know, it's been fun and you guys bring a it's honestly just been a tremendous team to work with. You guys are awesome people, so but if I was, if it was a four year term, maybe next year, it would be kind of cool. I think it'd be neat. Let's say we brought somebody else in, if they could kind of sit in on things, maybe the a few times a year before they get stuck with it. So they see a little bit how things are going, get an idea how things went the year before, maybe at least for a few of the things, just to think about that. So next year would be

Unknown Speaker  1:28:13
then three years for me, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:28:15
maybe, maybe it's something just to keep in mind for even this whole next year is to hone in on on the organizational aspect of it. We did. We had growth this year, and just

Speaker 3  1:28:30
just try to get some of these things down a little bit better, whether it's board terms or flow of software or recording or product all of

Speaker 6  1:28:45
that, maybe just make that a bit more, but from the point of this this next year.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:54
Thank you, guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
you're just having two of me. like it's completely.
