Unknown Speaker  02:53
These are

Matthias Miller  03:12
absolutely not A problem. Let me.

Matthias Miller  03:29
I did not take a close I glanced at it. I did not take time to fully digest.

Speaker 1  03:42
Does right?

Matthias Miller  03:52
I think so. The only thing with that is that, how do you Want to handle raw material

Speaker 1  04:00
For the second saw you to

Matthias Miller  04:42
easy. Do you want to split out the speed? Things so that you can show the species on the raw material, or Venus,

Unknown Speaker  05:14
miscellaneous prep. Well we

Speaker 1  05:28
was currently, good, okay,

Unknown Speaker  05:41
little. Okay,

Matthias Miller  05:44
sounds good. So we'll just use, we can use the literal dimensions for the raw, for the raw material on

Speaker 2  05:53
little, the little, they yield, just the dimensions. That's what I'm trying to say, the yield. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:18
so. It, I think, I think we're on, on the same page with that, then reading, on,

Matthias Miller  06:58
yeah, and I and I noticed that we're only, we only allow one decimal point, and we have some things like point seven and point eight. Is that good enough? Do we need two, three?

Unknown Speaker  07:10
You've Okay,

Matthias Miller  07:20
all right, yeah, that's, that'll be, that'll Go live next time We push things across. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  08:18
feet don't know what's

Unknown Speaker  08:37
happening, right?

Unknown Speaker  08:42
My Birthday

Speaker 1  08:51
probably be, yeah, I'm good. I'm right there. Yep, anybody?

Speaker 2  09:20
Over in our right?

Matthias Miller  09:37
I see you over there. I'm gonna switch

Unknown Speaker  09:51
Yeah, gotcha

Speaker 3  09:56
hop on this page I'm not sharing, am I.

Matthias Miller  10:00
No, you're not before I forget. So I'm not seeing any orders for these either. So that's something else that

Speaker 3  10:10
so so that, no, I have so they're being sold as other items, okay? And that's the other thing that I needed to ask is, and there is multiple item IDs, at least. There's at least eight. Sorry, I've got a little child that's been what do you do with a child that's whining?

Matthias Miller  10:34
Matt, well, start with food and water and a nap and then,

Speaker 4  10:41
yep, I don't know, food? Is it food? Is it water? We have food and water. Then it's an app. Do you see her?

Speaker 3  10:57
So she's three, and anyway, so here,

Unknown Speaker  11:02
watch, can't I get this? There we go. Stuff out. No, I don't want to do that.

Speaker 3  11:12
Here we go. Are you with me? Matt? Are we alright? So now I'm go. Well, I have to go to semi tracker. Um, her. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  11:29
wait a minute. That's not right.

Speaker 3  11:37
All right, Matt, so sorry. John is entering everything under the premise of 4840 grade, a repair when you guys are doing these jobs. So, for example, they worked seven to 430, they completed 106, 4840, some of those were a, some were B's the different. I mean, they're a different price, price point. So the problem is, I'm not, we're not giving the guys credit for the value at this point. So I have to tie it to a value. Ideally, I'd be like to tie this. Well, two things. First would be, what's possibility we can do 106 of these? Oh, boy, because some of them are A's and some are B's, and we haven't yet done that where we have assigned quantity to each without going back and trying to develop time. That's gonna be tough to do.

Matthias Miller  12:49
Well, how soon do you sell that? I mean, that's tough because, I mean, yeah, we are not currently looking at assembling two items in the same time period.

Speaker 3  13:04
So, so what we can't what I could do is just give them the lower value and say, here's what it is. You know it so right now, currently, Grade B is $8 Grade A is $10 we could just call them all grade B's sign a value and go with that. Or could just say 48 by 40 repair a and b combo call $9 down the middle, which they're most of them are going to be bees, usually so well

Matthias Miller  13:40
the the quick and dirty CFO version is, go find, go find how many you sold, what percentage from last year were A's and what percentage were B's, yeah, and set your price off of that,

Speaker 3  13:54
yep. And just give it a price. And so then what I might have to do is items adjust, make an adjustment here, so

Unknown Speaker  14:09
see what we got.

Matthias Miller  14:11
I mean, do we do we need separate items? Can we just merge A and B together into one item?

Speaker 3  14:17
I can for work order sakes, yeah, I'll just call it 48 by 40 repaired, exactly. So let's do that right now. Let's get rid

Matthias Miller  14:28
of this. Hang on. Hit the top the little arrow at the top right, little circle with the arrow

Unknown Speaker  14:38
way up in the corner, right there.

Matthias Miller  14:40
Yep, the bands merge duplicate item, okay, and then hit the find the 48 by 40 Grade A, okay. And what this does is it any place that we happen to have Grade B, anywhere it'll swap over. Yep, they'll call it Grade A. So. People to do that. Click See merged record and sorry. Well, I guess you'll have to get out and come back in. Let's switch over to Grade A, and all you need to do then is rename the rename the grade A, and you're good to go.

Unknown Speaker  15:16
Yeah. So close. This. Should I hit save? Nah.

Speaker 4  15:22
Okay. Back to here.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
40 by 40

Unknown Speaker  15:39
repair, I'm

Speaker 4  15:42
gonna say a slash, B, repaired.

Unknown Speaker  15:48
Yeah, that captures it. Let's

Matthias Miller  15:52
save and then clear, clear the clear the assembled as that's going in the wrong direction. Okay, you want to go to the poly 12 and say,

Speaker 3  16:09
Okay, I'm Gotcha. I Okay, sorry, yeah, well, I have to apologize. How am I clearing this? Just

Matthias Miller  16:18
all the way to the top, there's a blank item, Backspace, yep, any of that

Speaker 3  16:24
save? Okay, so now I have a list of eight, nine, I don't know how many items, so I can, I can do that with as many as I want. Yep. Is that right? Okay, perfect.

Matthias Miller  16:37
Yes, yeah. And then, and then those will show that show up in the bottom is incomplete. And you can go into the AB job, or the AB Yeah, and you'll, you'll see all those sales orders, and you can sell it as, or you'll see, yeah, you'll see all those sales orders. You can sell it as any of those 12 items, right?

Speaker 3  16:58
Um, wait, let's now I need to attach that value which, like I have to create a value. It's not in coming from Sage, like the other ones.

Matthias Miller  17:12
We scroll up a little bit. Do we? I don't know if we have a way.

Speaker 3  17:16
Yeah, I'm not sure that we do. I um,

Unknown Speaker  17:23
yeah, all right, well,

Matthias Miller  17:30
we can

Unknown Speaker  17:38
give you a way to do that.

Matthias Miller  18:16
If you do a price override, are you fine if we just completely ignore what comes in from Sage? Any do you care?

Unknown Speaker  18:22
Sorry, I mean, time is, yeah, what's, what was that question?

Matthias Miller  18:31
Matt, so I'll add, like, a fixed price override

Unknown Speaker  18:35
where, okay, sure. But

Matthias Miller  18:37
in, do you care if, if, what? If that's set? Do you care if we just completely ignore what's coming in from Sage? Is that fine? From

Unknown Speaker  18:46
sage is that fine? Do

Matthias Miller  18:47
you want to use Sage value?

Unknown Speaker  18:49
Well? So

Speaker 3  18:51
I'm assuming, I don't believe we have a sage value for this code. It's kind of a made up code. But if we would have a sage value you're saying, then you would make it override, yeah,

Matthias Miller  19:05
which? Well, if you this is a bit of a hypothetical scenario, so, but if you have both a price override on the item and the price in sage, which one do you want it to use?

Speaker 2  19:21
Um, I want it, yeah, I think as long as we

Speaker 3  19:29
have the, I guess both, I mean both options. But right now I need to price override,

Unknown Speaker  19:39
yeah, for this. All

Unknown Speaker  19:45
right, let's do this. I.

Matthias Miller  20:23
All right, I will, I'll go ahead and add that, and then you can, next update. You can, you can put in a default price, and you can, you can set that even if it's not in sage,

Speaker 3  20:36
okay, so just where

Matthias Miller  20:39
about it'll be, it'll be on the string, right above price.

Speaker 3  20:45
Oh, right there, yeah, well above price. You'll have another

Matthias Miller  20:49
it'll be, it'll say, default price,

Unknown Speaker  20:55
default price. Or Could you, could you call it like,

Speaker 3  21:02
Well, I wouldn't be default. It would be more like, it would be override price, right? I mean,

Matthias Miller  21:08
oh, I guess that goes back to my question. We're going to add these to all items. So if George puts in a number, yeah, items, do you want it to use the override no matter what we get from Sage, or do you want it to use the sage pricing if we have something from Sage?

Unknown Speaker  21:33
Well, if

Speaker 3  21:37
I guess, if so, this will be available for all items I get it. Nobody should be going in here and adding and changing the price unless you know we have some different price point. I don't even know. Why would it be different ever other than, I mean, there could be items that come along where we're just like this one. I mean, this one gets sold at different values for different so there could be more of those um, if it no anytime we at we do an override price, or whatever we're going to call it um, it that it should go with that number. Otherwise, it goes, it goes to Sage for sage by default, but override, Trump, sage, okay,

Unknown Speaker  22:30
yep, all right,

Matthias Miller  22:32
um, followed the price. Override. Is that good?

Speaker 3  22:38
Yeah, or um, how would we say it shop price?

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Maybe, like, I

Unknown Speaker  22:50
don't know, yeah, override.

Speaker 3  22:56
I mean, we're trying, yeah, it's not really the override. It's, it's kind of more like a shop value. And then if we can get more for it, we'll get more or adjust according to, oh. Then

Matthias Miller  23:08
let's call it something else, though. Let's call it more like, I mean, then price shouldn't be price. It should be, I mean, price could show his price, but we should call it something more like assembly value

Unknown Speaker  23:23
I was that's exactly what I was thinking

Unknown Speaker  23:27
when you were saying that, okay, yep,

Speaker 3  23:38
and that, and that's only, and then that will only dictate the value on the assembly analysis report. Right? Like it? Yeah, it's not, it's not attached to sage in any way. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  24:01
I Yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  24:12
well, that answers the question.

Speaker 4  24:30
Okay, any other things there? Matt, think that's covered.

Speaker 3  24:36
I think so. Okay, I'm looking at my other questions. So we're pretty good here. Yeah, let's see

Unknown Speaker  24:49
done that's done

Speaker 3  24:53
the again on that. Yeah, that is at this ad. Finish. Up to my notes here, again, on the let

Speaker 4  25:05
me, I have a couple windows here. Maybe it's this one, not that one. Similarly,

Speaker 3  25:17
analysis, where was that window? Matt, we were looking at, oh, it was the report. We were looking at value, or, yeah, like we were looking at the price adding a board. Do you have any questions about that? Like, again,

Matthias Miller  25:35
it'll come through in the next update. And

Speaker 3  25:37
then, and then you have, are you building in a category, a place where we can manually adjust, enter and then adjust, as needed, the board foot price. If like, are you at, yeah, are you calculating we have the board footage, but we don't have the board footage value.

Matthias Miller  26:03
You mean just showing the dollar per board foot, or

Speaker 3  26:09
what is the category that you're planning to show? I was just

Matthias Miller  26:13
going to add a column on the end that shows the dollar per board foot.

Unknown Speaker  26:20
Um, okay, okay, so dollar, right?

Speaker 3  26:32
I gotcha. I'm trying to think if that's if that covers what I have to let me look. I need to look at that again, because I'm I'm not sure that covers the need. I'm not sure that specific enough for dollars per hour is a it's a useful number. It's very useful, but it's it's only a reflection of what assembly guys can process in one hour. It doesn't capture all the cost. I know what we're trying to do here is, right? We're trying to create a window into,

Unknown Speaker  27:29
gosh,

Speaker 3  27:32
well, first thing my mind goes to is, what is the price? And this could be a bigger conversation pretty quickly. I'm not trying to get into some but again, I think you know, I've talked about this. I know you care and are interested as well, right on the pricing and so forth, with our 800 items a year, maybe, maybe more 1000s over the last few years, five years,

Unknown Speaker  28:05
I think

Unknown Speaker  28:09
so,

Unknown Speaker  28:11
dollars per no the

Speaker 3  28:19
there's A salesman that told me, If all else fails, if he could only, if there's a metric that he he says 60 cents of lumber for $1 in the price, like, for every 60 cents a lumber you should be able to get at least, you know, I mean, you're, you're, if, yep, If you're, if your lumber cost is 60% of your

Unknown Speaker  28:44
of your price,

Speaker 3  28:47
I think that was kind of what I'm so, what is the lumber cost compared to the actual price of The product?

Matthias Miller  28:56
So you need $1 per board foot.

Speaker 3  29:02
Oh, no, we need, we need the board footage showing up as $1 figure. It's almost like two different columns, like, it's okay, but

Matthias Miller  29:17
do you want this in this report, or do you want this in a separate item report, because you can pull that without assembly data.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  29:31
should we should do another report for that?

Speaker 1  29:35
I would. So, yeah, let me. I

Matthias Miller  29:43
let me here's, here's how I would I'm gonna, I'm gonna take over your screen. I'm.

Matthias Miller  30:01
So just for fun, we could throw it on the end of this one. So we have item board feet already. So would you so what would be

Unknown Speaker  30:11
no in the Items window, right?

Unknown Speaker  30:15
So then you're

Matthias Miller  30:19
you want to get Okay? So then what's the math?

Speaker 3  30:24
The math is 55 cents right now. So for every board foot, 55 cents. So then we would say the value of the board feet is one column, and then the as a percentage that value as a percentage of the price would be the next column. So it should be after fasteners,

Speaker 3  31:00
actually, yeah, it should be maybe, maybe shuffle like, put fasteners first, board feet second, then the board feet value next, and then the board feet value as a percentage of the price, and then the price.

Unknown Speaker  31:25
So let's see if we can

Matthias Miller  31:29
divide it by times the let's see.

Matthias Miller  31:40
Okay, so this would be, I mean, is this, is this lumber cost?

Unknown Speaker  31:47
I'm not seeing a real big let me see if I, oh,

Matthias Miller  31:50
here, let me I'll size mine down so you can see a little bit better.

Unknown Speaker  31:55
Sorry, I'm 100. What do you say, Matt?

Matthias Miller  31:59
So the times 55 would be lumber cost, or is there a different Right, right?

Unknown Speaker  32:05
Yeah.

Speaker 3  32:08
It's not accurate for all of our lumber, but it's a

Unknown Speaker  32:13
it's a good one to I mean,

Matthias Miller  32:15
estimated lumber price, Yep, yeah, yep, yep, estimated lumber percentage of price, and we don't need more than two decimals right align it, and then you have the price.

Speaker 3  32:33
Yeah, that's your percent. You could do your percentage and without decimals,

Speaker 4  32:40
yep, I like it. And then, um, can you so the percentage icon on that with that Number, Matt,

Matthias Miller  32:55
let me check something Here. I All right?

Unknown Speaker  33:35
This would be

Unknown Speaker  34:13
this

Unknown Speaker  34:31
um, There's gonna be

Unknown Speaker  34:42
a, there's a present,

Unknown Speaker  34:51
right? So, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:07
All right, let

Unknown Speaker  35:13
me go ahead and do this.

Matthias Miller  35:53
This has got to be this has got to be interesting once we get there.

Unknown Speaker  35:58
Yeah, what? Yep,

Unknown Speaker  36:05
are you done? I

Matthias Miller  36:07
mean, it's not live. I need to take it live, but that's

Unknown Speaker  36:10
fine. That's fine, but, yeah,

Speaker 3  36:16
no, I'm good on time. I'm not rushing. I'm not trying to rush. You're more than welcome to you're more welcome to tweak stuff while I'm here. I have plenty I can,

Matthias Miller  36:27
okay, I mean, I can. I'm as long as I've got, I've got what I need on this end.

Unknown Speaker  36:35
Well, if, if,

Unknown Speaker  36:38
how close are you to making it live?

Matthias Miller  36:40
I can give me five or five minutes or so and I can,

Unknown Speaker  36:47
that sounds Great. You're good. I

Unknown Speaker  39:19
in a minute. Matthias, yep, Mary, Harry. Harry one is going by the chair. One, two, I.

Matthias Miller  42:32
All right, started on the assembly values changes. I want to get those. I'm basically done with that, but I want to get those pushed across before. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  42:42
awesome, awesome, man. I. Man.

Speaker 4  53:51
Like, I'm on a call with Matt, yeah, some Money from Tina and George. Is that right when?

Unknown Speaker  54:03
Oh, they sent to like,

Unknown Speaker  54:06
Oh, really nice.

Speaker 2  54:19
Maybe like tomorrow, oh, yes, more on that. Tomorrow, one o'clock, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  54:28
All right, we're,

Matthias Miller  54:30
I got the estimated lumber prices in the life system. Okay, play around with that,

Speaker 2  54:36
yeah. Like to, like to look at that. Much.

Unknown Speaker  54:45
Share your screen again, if you want. Oh, okay, what happened? I.

Speaker 1  55:06
On, yeah, we didn't have to make them know about it. Stayed out in the gym until this thing. He was like,

Unknown Speaker  55:18
pretty much all right. There we go. Royal.

Speaker 3  55:29
Make this fit my screen here. Hey, hon, hon, I'm on a conference on my phone call here

Unknown Speaker  55:37
and on phone call here with Max.

Unknown Speaker  55:41
No, it's just,

Matthias Miller  55:45
Hey, Hi, there, yep. So, I mean, you can size one of the columns down, or you

Speaker 3  55:52
can, yeah, this heat notes, yeah, I'll do that. Thanks. Yeah, no, that's easy, but very, very good, very good. There you go. Let's go meet it down, yep.

Unknown Speaker  56:10
We gotta wait the other way.

Matthias Miller  56:19
How did what I just do, Matt, keep going back. I'm not sure how,

Speaker 3  56:23
when I drag, when I drag my cursor over there, that's what happened. Anyway, we're good. Okay, so we got

Unknown Speaker  56:33
description, fasteners, board feet. I

Unknown Speaker  56:45
estimated lumber cost. Now that's being

Speaker 3  56:52
these numbers are calculated by the sales Right?

Matthias Miller  56:58
Or what? It's irrelevant. Sales is irrelevant. It's 55 cents per board foot, the price being the most recently used price in sage.

Speaker 3  57:08
I'm sorry, man, I was thinking, I'm looking at this 176 board feet, but it's actually, might actually be right. Look at this big crate. Um, sorry, I I was asking, like, are these numbers multiplied. They're not multiplied. Well, what did I just so go ahead,

Matthias Miller  57:26
it's just calculated off of the lumber that's in the No, exactly,

Speaker 3  57:31
right, right? But again, it's not multiplied by anything. It's this is right? I was looking at the wrong item there. So Armstrong, AR, 001, for example, this guy, this line right here, eight board feet lower cost, four, set four, 9% the price is 972, seemingly at a good place. I know, like right here, we're off. I mean, this is just lumber, but man, really, yeah. Mean, 12% that's not near enough, yep. So you know that. Anyway, so as a great is a great is a great tool here, Matt, um,

Matthias Miller  58:19
then, I mean another fun thing to do is to sort it.

Unknown Speaker  58:25
Yeah, so Exactly,

Unknown Speaker  58:33
stakes,

Speaker 3  58:38
here's where it gets. Scary is up here? Scary is up here.

Matthias Miller  58:42
Scary is at the top. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  58:44
Mary's at the top,

Matthias Miller  58:47
like the remys.

Speaker 3  58:49
Wait, one by one by 36 that is not 10 board feet. I'm not sure what he's got going on there. That's off.

Speaker 4  59:01
Oh, now the New Holland one, that's that's a problem.

Matthias Miller  59:07
He's using one one by 40 by 36 to make a one by one by 36 so that way

Unknown Speaker  59:17
in the item. Yeah, what do you? How do you do that? Geez, buddy,

Matthias Miller  59:27
but I don't know that. I mean, you can't,

Unknown Speaker  59:30
can I edit it here? Yeah, you can. I should wait a minute.

Matthias Miller  59:36
One, one by random width.

Unknown Speaker  59:40
Here we go. One.

Unknown Speaker  59:45
I got going on here, my caps off. Number is off, okay,

Speaker 3  59:52
yeah, that's not random lit. That's just a one by that's a true one by one.

Matthias Miller  59:57
Yeah, that should that should make it look a little better.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
That should, well,

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
yeah, refresh. There you go.

Speaker 3  1:00:06
Yeah, all right. Um, no, this, this is good man, this is a great tool, right here. This New Holland, host editors, like that. Stuff's not, well, wait. Host editors, that's probably wedges. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:00:22
maybe wedges that aren't put in right?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
Maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
we got

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
one by 16.

Speaker 1  1:00:34
Wait, no. Wait three and put eight. Wait, what?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
Not? Something's not right.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
Yeah, something's not right there. I'm not sure what that is,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
again,

Speaker 3  1:00:59
so, yeah, great, great tool. Some of this needs to be, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
conceive of manufacturing. We got, not sure if this is right or not, but

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
at least we got it bears. The bears a look.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:19
Holy cow.

Speaker 3  1:01:23
I mean, some of the you know, like this, 264 by 12. I mean, that's a, that's a problem, man, yeah, no, I'll, I'll run this by Rick. Here's so how much you have to 415 right?

Matthias Miller  1:01:42
Yeah, I can. Actually, my next one got bumped a little later, so we can.

Speaker 3  1:01:46
So, so one thing that I'd like to, one thing I'd like to, well, I'm here now, I might as well, no, I'm in a good spot. I'm at home. I I have this weird phobia that if I'm at the office, it'll be it'll look better, and that'll make a difference. But, um, I need to get over that, because I'm actually at a better headspace here my own home office than I would be there.

Speaker 4  1:02:15
So you know, which is getting into other things that, um, you're not my shrink, right?

Matthias Miller  1:02:24
So sometimes not clear which one I am in some of my conversations, not just here, but anyway, keep going,

Speaker 3  1:02:35
um, so the next that so, but segue right into this. This is the next big if. If we do, if we add a couple more things to our assembly Analysis Report, maybe we caught something else. But to get real time production values, I we have, we have all the assembly stuff. What we don't have is the lumber cells. And what we don't have is, like, the the chips, the the it's Mount Airy, it's you. It's in the Yeah, kiddo, what's up? I don't know, but just, yeah, I'm not sure, but you're fine. It's in the items Matt, so if I do, let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:03:30
this is all items code.

Speaker 3  1:03:35
Yeah, right. Here we have again the recap to get for our incentive program. I'm only missing a couple things, and I could actually and then all I need is the payroll. I already know Rick saying, Well, I don't trust silver Loon, because, you know, he's not well. Yesterday, he did a report, and there was an an item that was worked on Monday with it did Matt. So there was a time entry, but no value. And then in that manager's meeting, that's when he was saying, well, there's, they're not all showing values. And it was the 4840s which we're fixing now. And then it was this hub asset, which I went in there with him and looked at and I was like, Okay, here's why I reckon. Oh, okay, he said, but, um, anyway, so for me, I have everything if, if we could bridge the lumber sales, daily invoicing. Now I don't do you see, can we see that from Sage right now?

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
Um, what? Well, break it down a little bit more specifically. What that is,

Speaker 3  1:04:45
lumber sales. Being lumber is part of production. We're cutting lumber, making special cuts at times like steaks, etc, and selling it, but it's never going into the assembly process. So. It's not going to show up as a work order entry, but it's, it's being done by the same guys out on the floor that we're trying to incentivize. So what we're trying I need to capture daily production value. In order to do that, I need the lumber sales. I need the Mount Airy sales, which is the hall, which is the chips grinding,

Matthias Miller  1:05:21
which, and that's based on, well, here I'm gonna let me, let me take over the screen, and let's start seeing if we can

Unknown Speaker  1:05:32
so so Mount Airy,

Matthias Miller  1:05:37
because wouldn't this basically just be items?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
Yes, historical or

Matthias Miller  1:05:48
it's either like non material items or

Speaker 3  1:05:55
not non material. We're gonna, we're gonna keep that out. It is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:01
non assembly items. That's it not this.

Matthias Miller  1:06:09
My non material item is one is what we had been using to exclude it from the these never make it to the cut list.

Speaker 3  1:06:21
Right? I think these are, I think what like this one right here? I think that's a heat treating price. I'm pretty sure.

Matthias Miller  1:06:33
I mean, the other option too, we don't have. I mean, we can do it any number of ways. We could also put in a customer and just give you sales by or is it more than that?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:55
Well,

Speaker 3  1:06:57
I'm trying to Rick knows the daily sales number. He wants to go by that. That's not right. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:07
daily is daily. Sorry,

Speaker 3  1:07:11
go ahead. Well, daily invoicing would be a better reflection. But what I want is daily production value.

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
But how do you know which day it was produced?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:23
Work Order entries?

Speaker 3  1:07:26
Oh, no, I don't, sorry, work order entries for assembly, but yeah, no for lumber, we don't, but we can. We can still go by the closest measurement right now is invoicing previous day or or we finish out the tracking of the sawing, which is going to be a progress. It's, I mean, a process. It's not going to be a simple thing. If

Matthias Miller  1:07:57
we can get, if we can get a reasonably close number.

Speaker 3  1:08:04
I would love to start because I'm asking Rick to start with daily invoicing. So then each day pay periods, 10 days after day one, we know the we know the assembly that was done, we have all the work order entries from day one. So we have Assembly value. If we can look at invoicing from day one and say, Oh, we sold a load of chips to Mount Airy and we sold $3,000 worth of lumber. Now we add that to the report. Those are the two other metrics that I need. I

Matthias Miller  1:08:57
just want to see which one these, which ones of These get flagged. I and why?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:08
Let's do this actually.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:25
So this is if

Unknown Speaker  1:09:31
it's a non material item.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
So

Matthias Miller  1:10:15
the wave, 5315, what's that?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
You say, wave 5315,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
yeah, not okay. Have to look at it. I might

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
let me here. Let me add a link here.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:40
Actions, I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
this is actually same voice

Unknown Speaker  1:11:23
man, I'm gonna, I'm gonna

Speaker 3  1:11:28
head. I do want to head to the office in the next 20 minutes, so I can either drop off and hop back on there, or,

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
I don't care, whenever I'm I'm flexible. If we're done in 20 minutes, we can drop. Or if you want to, I'm super flexible. Yep.

Speaker 3  1:11:50
Well, if you have some work to do right now, I'll drop. Or if not, I'll stick until you have a you say, Hey, I'm gonna work on something. Then I'll scoot down there.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
Well, okay, like, I think

Speaker 3  1:12:06
here I'm trying to ever analyze this just, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:12:09
so here's the, here's the we're

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
so, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
okay, you tell me, why does this one not need assembly?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:24
It's lumber. Yep. Sorry, it's lumber only.

Matthias Miller  1:12:27
Okay, so here's a lumber only item, lumber only rate is a non material item. It's not a

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
non material item, though.

Speaker 3  1:12:40
It's a non assembly item. Great. No, no, it's a, I didn't see it long enough

Matthias Miller  1:12:53
there to Okay. The no these, these require, these are going through the cut list, but not requiring assembly,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
right? That is the

Unknown Speaker  1:13:03
freight

Matthias Miller  1:13:06
doesn't matter for for incentives, right?

Speaker 3  1:13:12
The other, the other potential non material item is potential heat treat like that, Mount Airy one was a non material that Mount Airy 3b which you have that tab there, um, your second tab, you know that was, I'm pretty sure that's for heat treating. If you scroll down, think you're gonna find anything else. Pretty sure that was a heat treating price, like dollar 25 per i potentially, maybe not. I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but non material items, don't I don't. We don't need them for incentive like truck.

Matthias Miller  1:13:55
We need a different classification for these guys that don't require a cut list, but are included in the incentive, or should they be on the cut?

Speaker 3  1:14:09
This doesn't need to be this one doesn't need to be an incentive,

Matthias Miller  1:14:12
okay, perfect. So that can be a non material item, right? So the question I have here is the

Speaker 3  1:14:21
non assembly if we could all non assembly items that get invoiced, that's what we

Unknown Speaker  1:14:32
that's what we need.

Matthias Miller  1:14:34
All non assembly items that get invoice. Well, that's easy.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:38
You already have the orders, right? The orders are coming

Matthias Miller  1:14:40
through. Ordered. I have everything there, yeah. What about and then? And then, presumably, if we don't, if the item doesn't exist for some reason, we should show it in here and flag it so that we can fix it

Speaker 3  1:14:55
correct. And then that Mount Airy to go to the. One again, I is, does that? Is that a non assembly item? Or what do they have material? Again, I need to look. We need to look at that. I can't see it right now. Okay, that is not correct. Well, no, that's not true, because it's, it's, it's our grinding, it's our chips that we get from our byproduct, our off, our, yeah, cut backs and scrap pallets and all that blocks or and blocks off of the sawing in that. So that is, it's a material item, I would say that's a non assembly item,

Matthias Miller  1:15:43
but, but we don't have anything to push to the cut list, so we need to improve classification a little bit.

Speaker 3  1:15:58
But what? But what? Okay, but are you saying we can't stick it in the cut list, or we don't want to send it that way?

Matthias Miller  1:16:05
Well, I mean, should it be in the cut list?

Speaker 3  1:16:10
I guess I'm asking if, if that's the easiest thing, just run it through there. George will mark it complete, unless, now we probably shouldn't do that. It just needs to show up in when we invoice it. So, yeah, we can call it um, we can, we can name it something else.

Matthias Miller  1:16:28
I mean, we we could say no sizing slash sawing required, and have a different checkbox for that. It's it's not clear. It'd almost be better to change this into a list.

Speaker 4  1:16:48
This is, it's a byproduct. It's okay,

Speaker 3  1:16:54
I mean, but it's, but it's like, we pay guys to grind this stuff up. And it is, it is lumber that we buy. So

Unknown Speaker  1:17:06
I don't know. I don't want to, well, let's overthink

Matthias Miller  1:17:10
it. Why don't, why don't you? Why don't you run a run, run to the office. And I mean, I feel like we're super, super close. We just need, I don't want to, to your point, don't want to overthink it, but we also do need to make these classifications clear enough that, but you will

Speaker 3  1:17:34
Well, sure, do we need a separate category for that so that you can so that it shows up somehow in our report, like daily invoicing, like the non the non assembly items you're gonna I don't know what you're gonna call it, but we need that a report on that daily value. And this, the only thing with this $500 for Mount Airy is that also needs to show up daily value.

Matthias Miller  1:18:06
I mean, really, what you're trying to say is, okay, this would be an option. Add an exclude from cut list checkbox on here so you do have you've got it literally is a non material item, you should check this, but if it is a material item, but it doesn't need to be on the cut list, it's excluded from cut list,

Speaker 3  1:18:28
right? It because it is a material item, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
Okay, I like it. I'm happy. Okay, so, um,

Speaker 3  1:18:44
you said run to the office, or you do want to, like work on that, or how, sorry I

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
didn't work on this, unless you've got other things.

Speaker 4  1:18:56
Let me think quick, Matt,

Speaker 3  1:19:03
yeah, that. Matt, so again, it's that Mount Airy sells that $500 which is two times a week, most of the time anyway, and then the daily lumber invoicing, which is as close as we can get until we spend a whole bunch of time and track all the sewing, and even then, there's going to be some one day and some of the night, like it's gonna it's, it's not, it's a small percentage of our overall sales, so it's gonna show up one week, or the other daily Invoicing is as close as we can get. It's close enough, because my goal Matt is my goal. Then is I know my daily production amount, which is assembled items, non assembled items, and that Mount Airy chips, we know the total every day. And I'm going to mirror that against the total shop labor cost each day. And I'm and I know my so based on a production, 12% of that value is allotted to the the pool. 12% of that value goes to shop labor. So as long as shop labor costs come under that 12% the rest of it is a is is their incentive pay at the end of the pay period. So after day one, if there is extra in that pool besides what was absorbed by their labor there, that there's a number there. So what that number is going to be a percentage of it's going to be a percentage of the labor costs. So basically, we're going to say, Okay, after the first day, you guys are at 2% incentive, or 5% or whatever. And then we're going to put that number, that one single number on the board, percent incentive, incentive is currently sitting at 2% you know, like, that's something like, I don't know. That's what I'm trying to get to now, it's not going to be same for every guy, so I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
Well, you can have a, I mean, you can have an incentive score or something like that. They don't have to know that. It's a percentage. They just know, the higher it goes, the more you get. Maybe, I don't

Speaker 3  1:21:45
know now that's what it would be. It would be an incentive score. Because the reality is, the guys that have a higher hourly wage, if everybody works same amount of hours, the guys with the higher wage are going to get more of the incentive well,

Matthias Miller  1:22:04
but it's still proportional to their wage, and so it actually is a percentage. You could turn it into a percentage bonus, like you get a 1% 10% raise this week, because it doesn't matter, because the percentage bonus would be the same for everybody.

Speaker 3  1:22:26
Well, we weren't going to do it that way. I was going to, I was going to take each person's contribution over the 10 day pay period and then divvy it up by their percentage of contribution.

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
I'm sorry, right? Because they're No, it's gross wages. Nevermind, right?

Speaker 3  1:22:43
Yeah, exactly. So that's dictated by their hourly wage number. If everybody works in man hours, the higher wages still get more. If some guys are working more hours, they're going to get even more. So if you don't show up on a Monday and all that stuff, it's, that's your loss, you know? It's somebody else's game. Um, so. But the reality is, if, if we show that as a percentage, the average may be 5% but the higher guys might be getting seven, and the lower might actually be getting three. And so if, sooner or later, they're going to figure that out. So I have to do a better job in that.

Matthias Miller  1:23:22
But it'd still be a percentage of their paycheck way

Speaker 3  1:23:28
it's it would be, it just wouldn't be the same, which just couldn't put, put one number up for everybody, right? Um, so I have to think about that. Matthias, but

Matthias Miller  1:23:43
hang on, if one guy works two hours at $5 an hour making up silly numbers, yep, and another guy works 30 minutes at $20 an

Speaker 1  1:23:56
hour, they both get 5050, splits of the pool,

Matthias Miller  1:24:03
they both increase their take home pay by the same percentage,

Speaker 3  1:24:13
right? But if, if one guy's making 20 and it works an hour, or the guy's making 10 and he works an hour, the guy making 20 is going to get twice as much as the guy making 10, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
But let's say that your pool, then one's making 20 and the others, one's making $10 the other is 20, and you have a $3 pool. Well, one guy gets $1 the other guy gets $2 they both get a 10%

Unknown Speaker  1:24:41
that's true. So

Matthias Miller  1:24:43
you can do it as a percentage bonus, I think, I think that makes the most sense, and then they can translate in their head, but, well, I make

Speaker 3  1:24:49
That's right. No, you're right. What am I saying? I think you're right. The percentage is the same. Yeah, the percentage is the

Matthias Miller  1:24:58
same. You just got to translate it. From the 20? No, it's the same. So I can't, it's a funny formula, but no, I

Speaker 3  1:25:05
can't post that number. That's right. Yes, we can post that. It's a funny it's but it's easy. Yeah, that's right, that's right. I'm sorry. I hopefully I thought that through more, because I was confident about it for a long time already. I can't, I can't see you anymore. Not I mean, I don't know if that,

Matthias Miller  1:25:25
if you doesn't matter. I don't need to. I'm done sharing.

Speaker 3  1:25:31
I don't know if I can even but, um, so

Matthias Miller  1:25:35
under your window somewhere. What's that? I'm buried under your windows somewhere?

Speaker 3  1:25:40
Oh, yeah. Well, here I go. I'm sure I got it right here. Yeah, I got it.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:45
Um, so, so,

Speaker 4  1:25:55
okay, because if,

Speaker 3  1:26:01
all right? Well, you know, you that's a lot of stuff that we just went over. Is that a lot?

Matthias Miller  1:26:06
Is Yeah, so what's the what's the priority? In which order is it? The cut list changes?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:17
Well, when, when could you possibly have all of it?

Matthias Miller  1:26:21
I mean, I can have it. It's middle of next week.

Speaker 3  1:26:25
Okay? Cut list changes first, and then this report information second. You already did that items. You already added that to the items, right? That? Yeah, that's there.

Matthias Miller  1:26:40
I'll be coming through the next epic, yeah, the assembly value,

Speaker 3  1:26:45
no, the board foot cost, yeah, the board

Matthias Miller  1:26:51
the board foot cost, the the lumber

Unknown Speaker  1:26:54
cost.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:57
So yeah, the lumber cost, yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
all right, that's done. That'll come through the next update, I may. I'm gonna probably push that 55 cents into a setting so it's not, yeah, so we can control it. But, yeah, yeah, I don't

Speaker 3  1:27:11
know. They all these things are all kind of important at the same time. Yeah, you, you're, you're doing the multiplier thing. That's for George. It's, it kind of all comes together. Rick. Rick's tracking. Rick's track. He said he can track lumber and Mount Airy separately. I'm he should be able to. So that should be fine. Not a little test for him. But as soon as you have it, I'm just gonna look at I want to look at it with you and make sure, and then I can, yeah, I just need to make, we just need to look at what it acts now. I need to figure out how to get sage. I'll get his actual invoicing numbers, and then we'll look at it on our side. So, yeah, they're all kind of important in the same I don't know, whatever works for you, I think is good.

Speaker 4  1:28:04
Matthias first, um, all right, um,

Speaker 3  1:28:09
yeah, okay. Well, I've dude, I really want to, I really want to find a man. I just long. I long for a partner, dude, I long for a partner. I'm, I'm, I'm just like, gosh, it's crazy. Like, yeah, wake up at night and, and sometimes, and just like, when I start thinking I was like, something right? Like, I just know something is not the what it should be. There's a, it's like, there's a it's like there's a bad person, whatever is it a spiritual thing that I'm just dealing with? I don't think so. I think it's Something's just not the way it should be there and it and often, one individual often pops in my mind and it's and I don't know I was being encouraged today by some guys at a business group I do every, every second, second, second, Thursday, the month. Anyway, conversation. So good, good guys and just talk. And the one guy knows me pretty well. He's like, Dude, you got he said, For this your sake and for your family's sake, he said, if it's keeping you up at night and he's sleeping tonight. He's like, You got to make a change. Like, you just got to do it. So, um, but then I it would be and I'm I told him all he'd be so much easier. Because if I could stand there in front of him, with another guy beside me, with two people, deliver the news, that would seem so much easier. But maybe it's just something that I need to I need to walk through. I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  1:29:50
Well, I've mentioned this before. Two thoughts. One of the groups I was part of a number of years ago, one of the guys said. And basically, if you wake up in the middle of the night thinking about somebody who's who's not, who's not, sleeping next to you, you probably need to get out of your business. But if it's, I think it's we've had, I've been working with my colleague Josh long. He's he does sales, recruiting, sales and leadership recruiting, and we've mentioned him before, but

Unknown Speaker  1:30:28
yep, that

Matthias Miller  1:30:31
the the upside of not being a narcissistic business owner is that you're not a narcissistic business owner. The downside is that there's a propensity. And I've been guilty. He's been guilty. We've all been been guilty of hanging on to people far past their very useful life, to the business.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:01
Yeah. If,

Matthias Miller  1:31:04
if it is the kind of thing where having, okay, if you're looking for a partner, that's a completely different story. But if is, if it is the kind of thing where you're looking for a values aligned. So senior team member, I'm more than happy to set up a call with with the three of us, and we can talk through what that looks like. That kind of ends up being in your in your court, as far as what direction you want to go,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:41
yeah, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:31:44
Is it? It would also make a world of difference if you had had a highly competent person that you were bringing in and you you actually had a fallback, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:31:53
exactly, yeah, right. I mean, right now my contingency plan would be the accounting firm, the bookkeeping stuff, and I would certainly lean on you. And I don't know, I don't know what that would look like, I'll probably try to lean on you some more, and whatever that could be. But the exciting thing is, like we're solving so much, there's so much, there's so many solutions here that we're that are available with this, with these tools, I think it's, I think it's a win. You know, it's like investing, where you put your money, gonna keep spending it on or do you want to just because, I mean, there'd be a, there be a, it would, it would, it would require a, what's the word, severance package pay? There would be a severance required. But then, you know that, yeah, so, but it's the other factor, is dad, and so dad's trying to, need to have a couple we're trying to, trying to fire up some, some a couple conversation with dad, some tough conversations around ownership, roles, expectations, decision making processes. Also like, dad owns the land. So that's a that's a trip, right there, and some things that or, yeah, I don't need to get in all that, but just some difficult things there, with some improvements currently, and it's Yeah, like that. Any with the company should, I don't feel like the company should be paying 100% land improvements on property next door when the when he's not the majority owner, so a primary or so, yeah, but there's some things, you know, lease agreement and all that so anyways. But all right, thanks, man. I want to again the announced report is what it is, is it easy for you to bake, to bake this into where it maybe it will. It will include the Mount Airy and the lumber invoicing daily. Or, like, where that's optional. Or, how do you, how simple is that? Or do you want to put it all together?

Matthias Miller  1:34:17
I would, I would prefer to give you, I mean, what's easiest for me is to give you two reports, what was assembled and what were the other what are the other items that

Unknown Speaker  1:34:26
need to be included? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:34:29
that's that's all the same. Let's go that way,

Speaker 3  1:34:33
two different windows on the screen, right? Yeah, yeah. And if we want to merge that. I mean, I'm sure you can merge that, right

Matthias Miller  1:34:42
if, I mean, yeah, we can. I mean, we could take a look. Well, I mean, maybe, and maybe we should just straight up, do a third, which is just, just for the sake of both of our headspace. Maybe we should. Wait until this would make reasonable sense. Would be having a an incentive screen that shows all of the calculations, all of the values, and then breaks down into the employee bonus percentage. And then have a have links out to other reports for for cross verification, if you want. I think we should go that route. But for the sake of both of our headspace, I wonder if I should get some of the preliminaries, yeah, out first. And

Speaker 3  1:35:37
I'm trying to make we have the guy. We're shutting down tomorrow production at 12 tomorrow, and I'm trying to motivate the guys, and we're trying to say that, hey, if you guys work faster and work four or less hours on this Friday, like there's a chance you're going to make incentives.
