Unknown Speaker  00:29
Morning This I'm

Speaker 1  00:46
Hey, there you are. Does it shut your video off when you try to screen share? It might have frozen, I don't know, because it was just showing a gray screen without even your name, just like it would with had your name and no name either.

Matthias Miller  01:03
That's weird. I don't know. I still haven't restarted my computer and updated. That's like the most obvious thing. I would say those

Unknown Speaker  01:11
would be reasonable options.

Matthias Miller  01:15
Good morning. Good morning. Mark morning. Well, I'm gonna have to give Addison a hard time. He's he's been hanging out my office, and then last yesterday he was he was out, and today he's out. Give him a hard time about not calling into his boss to let him know that he's sick. I

Speaker 2  01:46
uh, Lane is not going to be on today. He asked him

Matthias Miller  01:52
why he's been done, but also

Unknown Speaker  02:00
so

Speaker 2  02:02
Matthias, you had mentioned the next week may not work for your the time minute work. Should we

Matthias Miller  02:12
well? So the the the initial potential conflict is okay, but we found out there was a friend of ours who went into the ER yesterday and very unexpectedly passed away. He was like, he was like, in his, I don't use his upper 40s, 50s, and so I don't know, I don't know what any of that looks like, so I think, I think it might just have to be a little bit of a of a play by ear and be in touch to see how, yeah, it would like to attend the funeral, if it, if it works. But we just don't really know anything at this point.

Speaker 2  03:00
Well, sorry to hear about that. What? What was it an accident? Or what happened?

Matthias Miller  03:06
No, I mean, he'd had heart issues in the past, and it was some kind of aortic aneurysm.

Unknown Speaker  03:22
So, yeah,

Speaker 2  03:26
yeah, that's fine to just play it by ear for next week. I I think, I mean, I'd be tempted to say that maybe just drop it all together. But we have what minutes. Why don't we go through the meeting see if there's anything that makes me a little nervous to go three weeks without any meetings, but we also don't. Doesn't seem like we have a lot of stuff on the agenda right now.

Matthias Miller  03:56
Well, and if I don't know how Seth feels about this, but I'd be open to I could do a seven Eastern Wednesday or Thursday, if necessary.

Unknown Speaker  04:08
I don't know if

Speaker 1  04:10
I could maybe do Thursday. I don't want to do it Wednesday. I'm flying Wednesday. I don't want to wake up too clearly,

Matthias Miller  04:18
fair enough. You guys don't fly late. Oh, even worse, we can. I'm fine. Let's, let's get what you said. I have nothing

Speaker 1  04:29
to add. Next week will be my last week that will be open until, like, the week of the 14th of July.

Unknown Speaker  04:39
Okay, so

Speaker 2  04:42
I will be able When is the wedding,

Speaker 1  04:45
28th of June. So I'm in next week. Well, I'm in. I fly there Wednesday, but then I'll work largely Thursday and Friday, and then the week after, that's the week right before the wedding. And so I. I might work a little bit, but I'm not planning on being very available.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
Are you, what are you doing afterwards? Are you going on it?

Speaker 1  05:10
Yeah, yeah, a little honeymoon trip to eastern New York and Vermont. Just some Airbnbs up there. Okay, so, yeah.

Speaker 3  05:22
So, yeah, you can't even go on a honeymoon in some other country or anything, because it's old hat already.

Speaker 1  05:30
I think we want to travel internationally at some point, but honeymoon, yeah, just stay local for that. And then sometime when we have more energy and we're a year into marriage or something, that we can go, Yeah,

Speaker 2  05:48
I was thinking the same thing. I expected it might be going to Bangladesh or India. Don't a lot of the local Mennonites go to Dominican Republic.

Unknown Speaker  06:00
Yeah, Dr and I love Caribbean somewhere down

Speaker 1  06:05
there. I'd rather do that at a time where I'm actually going to be more focused on travel than I would be over my honeymoon. I think so.

Speaker 3  06:15
Well, I think I think honeymoons are overrated. Like, I it would just be so much better trip, like, say, a year or two or five or 10 or whatever that's like. It's also like you can't even enjoy the trip hardly for a trip. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  06:44
that's fine when you really needed this in the thick of things, when you've got, like, this is my life, my stage right now, but you got kids running around and you're not getting any sleep, and life is crazy everywhere, like, Let's go disappear for a week. And, hey, sounds glorious.

Speaker 1  07:00
Life feels crazy enough just with wedding plans the last few months. So in that way, I'm pretty happy for just a very slow week,

Speaker 3  07:09
even even one thing, just on the very practical level, is like, at that point we barely even knew what we enjoyed together, you know. And so it's like now we would go do different things, enjoy together, makes sense?

Unknown Speaker  07:32
Good? Well, let's just jump to the current projects, the revised actual cost application. We just want to screen share with I think there's still a few things unique from me Seth, and then

Speaker 2  07:54
I'm hoping to do actual cost applications for the month of May today, which I want to see if there's

Unknown Speaker  08:08
should I be sharing screen with is or, I'm

Matthias Miller  08:10
sorry, the actual Hang on, hang on run that I got distracted by the reporting discrepancies. Can you repeat that? This bad meeting etiquette?

Speaker 3  08:24
The revised actual cost application. Where's that one going?

Matthias Miller  08:29
I mean, we have that

Speaker 1  08:32
we think, done basically, basically we talked about a little bit yesterday. I haven't made

Matthias Miller  08:38
that change yet. Do we have the report in the live system where they could talk through the terminology?

Speaker 1  08:45
I think so, because I think all my other changes were last week.

Matthias Miller  08:50
So we did, we did Mark, we tried to standardize some terminology, and hopefully it's close enough to what real world is. The way we're thinking about it is there's a standard cost which is familiar, then there's the assigned cost, which would be either frozen labor, which sounds weird, or the bomb value, And then the balance is the unallocated cost. So assigned cost plus unallocated cost equals the standard cost, and then we take the actual cost, and so for the weighted cost, dollars, if it's we take the the assigned cost plus a weighted unallocated cost. To come up with the weighted cost dollars, we have the rounding adjustment for the overall rounding that it gets applied to the largest unallocated cost, and that gives us the actual adjusted cost, which adds up to a.

Unknown Speaker  10:01
Uh, the actual cost for the period,

Speaker 2  10:04
does that? So, okay, the assigned cost in this example is, if we were to go to one of those buildings, it's probably an an actual cost, like for the full amount where we manually entered, yeah, so, but, what's it going to do with where we only have the flooring, or, like, $100 worth of assigned cause? So

Matthias Miller  10:32
in this case, let's pick a building. Let's say this one, we have $2,000 and let's say the flooring is 8582 so your standard cost would be 2085 82 your assigned cost to be 8582 your unallocated cost is $2,000 then to calculate the weighted dollars we're going to get, take we're going to, well, first we're going to take the 8582 and say, How much do we need to increase or decrease the 8582 to get? Okay, we have the big bucket of an allocated cost, and then we have the, well, think about it like this. This might be easier to picture we should have,

Speaker 2  11:11
but we, I don't know if it's helpful, but I think we, if we were to go, this is live, and we were to go to May, we do have a few buildings in May. Maybe that's not easier. I

Matthias Miller  11:25
don't know. We could do a you guys mind if I add a period

Speaker 2  11:30
here for no May, no, I'm going to do the same thing. I mean, so

Matthias Miller  11:34
we're going to do it looks like two, 220, I something like this might be 7.6% ish, maybe sort of, we don't know. Is that fine?

Speaker 2  11:49
Yeah, actually, just a note, completely different. But the manufacturer dollar number that we're bringing in here is not correct, all right, it should just show here's the buildings, the manufacturer, total manufacturing, price, buildings built in this period, which would be helpful to what is

Matthias Miller  12:12
it showing now, actual cost, date to the end date it's thinks it is, but obviously not if you're saying it's wrong, manufacturer price here,

Unknown Speaker  12:30
like there's,

Matthias Miller  12:33
let's try this,

Speaker 2  12:35
then it should be more like 600,000 or so instead of, yeah, them so the Oh no,

Speaker 1  12:50
never mind. I'm seeing the range now. It should be fine. Why is it

Matthias Miller  12:55
so we're in, sorry, we're in Indiana and in range building. Built, a built,

Speaker 1  13:05
is there some field take a range of dates within ellipses in between? Well, I don't know. That's what it's trying to do. I don't know if that's right. I

Matthias Miller  13:19
mean, it's weird that we come up with that big of a number if it's not 652, 78 oh,

Unknown Speaker  13:27
I think that's the problem.

Matthias Miller  13:30
Great. Apparently it doesn't support it. And this would be, would this just be all buildings of all time for well, it's also not broken down by, well, I think it's either, Oh, my word. That's probably an issue. I'm gonna guess that is the issue of bad. That is real bad. You should talk to the guy who did this.

Speaker 2  14:01
Uh, it's obviously not, uh, we've been living with it for a while, so it's not, it's been an

Unknown Speaker  14:09
ignored number for a long time. Okay?

Speaker 2  14:13
But what that would do is, okay, the period cost is simply a calculation that we're dividing the period cost dollars by the manufacturer dollars, right? Yes, which would be helpful, because we look at that,

Matthias Miller  14:28
yeah, don't spread any rumors about based on these numbers, because you can have people knocking down your door figuring out how you're doing

Unknown Speaker  14:36
it. Yeah, we're just combining other people's and ours too.

Speaker 2  14:42
Yeah, small hiccup that these developers pursue will fix real quickly, like I'm referencing part six of software series,

Matthias Miller  14:51
I guess exactly

Speaker 1  14:55
pick up that will be fixed well into a year after it was released.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Exactly. And

Matthias Miller  15:01
that would be an interesting metric. I really wonder, wonder how long it's been anyway,

Speaker 2  15:05
what's the small bunny trail? But what's the the what's next after this series is done now? Or is it,

Matthias Miller  15:16
um, probably, probably some reruns, or just more standard ads. We were cooking up a series. We're we're exploring things. It's fine to say we're exploring a Excel Nightmare series. I don't know if that's going to be story form or just ads, but it's really hard to take somebody, I think you guys actually mean you guys, the first time we did, but it's hard to take somebody who comes from a world of Excel and formulas. It's kind of structured, if you put some structure into it, but it's really unstructured, and it's really easy to customize and hard to standardize. And I don't know if you remember back to working with another client that's like they are. They've taken Excel spreadsheets to the NS degree like they have. They have multiple Excel developers on their Excel sheets. And it's a pretty big paradigm shift to go from, oh, let's just put together some formulas, to we actually have to structure the data. And it, it's actually really reminiscent, you know, payroll module. We made some mistakes, but, but on both sides, I think we could have, I mean, we didn't know what we didn't know, but it's also part of the cost of learning. It's a whole different way of thinking to think about Excel sheets versus a database. So it actually be really interesting at some point. Could be really interesting at some point mark to pick your brain, because I feel like, I feel like you've done well, you've had the you probably have put in your 10,000 hours on this, but you've done a really great job making that mindset shift, and it would be really interesting to hear your perspective about how your thinking has changed and what you've learned.

Speaker 2  17:16
Well, I mean, what one area where we're we're running into issues with Excel is not necessarily the culprit, but is how we calculate our manufacturing price numbers for your fifth right? How we need to move that into assist to standardize that. But the I'm curious you mentioned a company, is that the is it hostile versus, yeah, they talk to you, yeah, so, so have they come on board

Matthias Miller  17:45
with you? Are there? Yeah, they're planning to do a little bit in Paragon, and then we're taking over some of their Excel custom quoting types of stuff, which, when you think about quoting poultry barns, like, that's a there's not a lot of off the shelf software for voting poultry. Poultry barn specifically, it's pretty small, niche. Well,

Speaker 2  18:07
they have, with all the different pieces they have in their organization, it could be quite major to like any it said they run off of 1000 spreadsheets so, and it sounded like they're, for the most part, on top of their numbers, or they, you know, they, they put a lot of effort into that. To me, yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:30
no, and, but even even at that, at a scale that they're at, can you imagine managing inventory off of Excel spreadsheets for these, these large projects like this, with lead times up to a year to 12 to 18 months on certain of their nests, like, wow.

Speaker 2  18:46
And they're multiple they're in multiple locations. I think they have multiple manufacturing facilities for who I remember, and people working out of different areas and and they're also, I want to say that he told me their their email setup was maybe similar to what some of the Amish you have, like, they have a local guy that comes in twice a day with maybe that has changed, but like a download, here's all your incoming emails, and then some kind of upload that, here's all your outgoing emails. It sounded kind

Unknown Speaker  19:17
of Wow. Interesting.

Speaker 2  19:21
What was oh, I'm curious how fast the projects moved there, because I think he said they have 2020,

Unknown Speaker  19:31
some owners

Unknown Speaker  19:34
in the in the business like

Matthias Miller  19:36
I've been shocked. It hasn't felt bureaucratic. The one very interesting thing that I've found from them. I mean, it's definitely slower, but you're going to find that in any large organization. I don't care what it is. But then the one of the two of the really interesting things that I I found about them is one of their goals. I. One of their big rocks over the next five years, I think, is right people, right seats, and one of the second ones is, or one of the things that's shown up too, is being very intentional not to drive community standards forward just because of their size and cloud. And I think it's pretty admirable for an organization to have that scale, to have an awareness of the power dynamics that easily show up. Like, I mean, you could very easily just tell people to basically shut up and do your job, because you can and and you can also very easily play. We know how the political game can can work in these types of circles. And we would like to think that money doesn't talk, but it really does. So I think it's a high degree of they earned a lot of respect for me for for that kind of awareness and that approach,

Speaker 2  21:03
yeah. I wish I'd like to meet the guy at the one. I forget who called him, but he said he might stop in some time, if he's in the area that has Yeah. So they do. They have a huge role forming operation as well. Like, it's a feed Miller retail store. And I don't know, I mean, I think he said 125 employees on payroll, or another 200 subcontractors that they work with. That's, I'm going off of, mainly from, yeah, months

Matthias Miller  21:30
ago or so. That's crazy

Speaker 2  21:35
there. I think they originate from, like the sleeping preacher people, well or No, I should say that that was the assumption we put together.

Speaker 1  21:45
Interesting, I think that's right. Yeah, you know what?

Unknown Speaker  21:49
They're not the same guys as the egg

Unknown Speaker  21:52
processor, Jonathan

Unknown Speaker  21:55
like mid states eggs.

Matthias Miller  21:58
Mid states is one of their integrators. So they build for mid states,

Speaker 4  22:02
yeah, okay, and you do some work, that's what

Speaker 3  22:06
they are. No, I know a guy that works for them. And yeah, they have the same spreadsheet mess. And,

Matthias Miller  22:18
well, let me know you know, somebody can fix it,

Speaker 3  22:23
yeah, no. Work we do is for one of their growers.

Matthias Miller  22:26
Got

Speaker 3  22:27
it that grows, that produces eggs for them,

Matthias Miller  22:31
yeah, yep, makes sense. So

Speaker 2  22:33
your, your thought about the egg cell nightmare is that kind of going back to the, oh, there was maybe two years ago, an ad that it used three modes of transportation as a different software. That was a motorcycle was the Excel spreadsheet. It's fast and fun and but it also it can be dangerous, and a pickup, it doesn't cost as much a pickup truck was your custom software. It's kind of a versatile you can do. It's not your cheapest route. And then the bus was the public transportation. It's like QuickBooks. It's easy to you know, cheap and easy to keep, to buy, easy to use if you go where the bus goes. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  23:21
that is still, I forgot about that. That's still such a great analogy. I have to it's

Unknown Speaker  23:26
really good.

Matthias Miller  23:29
Man that might be, I might have to mention that back to Ellis, because I think that could be repurposed into a, you just do a different spin on that. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:52
you know anything about fish? I'm working

Matthias Miller  23:55
with a company up in Maine, which is pretty easy to chase down, if you do a little research, but they, they're doing software selection. We're doing a bunch of software demos, and there's only one software on the market at the moment that I'm aware of that actually has any kind of bomb handling. Well, there may be, there may be a few, but I just wanted to, I mean, if you guys don't know already, I need to tell you guys, and I know you do. So just remind you guys how impressive of a comprehensive solution you guys have put together. Because I think you guys are, I think you guys are ahead of I don't think there's any retail product. Uh, it, I would. It might not be glitzy and shiny, and you might not have fancy marketing to go with it, but put yourself up to any retail product out there, and even even there, I mean, you're, you're, you're costing your accounting, your all. All of that stuff. Admittedly, you guys have been a little slow to put together bomb rolls, all things in due time, but put yourself head to head against any of these tools, you guys have a very impressive suite of tools. So hats off to you guys.

Speaker 2  25:15
Wow, we couldn't have done it without guys like you and drew to help along the way, that's for sure. I

Matthias Miller  25:23
think I lost you. Is it on my end?

Unknown Speaker  25:30
Can you hear us now?

Speaker 1  25:33
I can hear you all. So I think it's Matthias. And I was a little surprised when he just cut drew off. But I wondered if there was something going on with audio.

Unknown Speaker  25:49
I thought maybe he was really well. We got

Unknown Speaker  25:57
to hear his little spiel. Anyway, i Good.

Speaker 2  26:06
Well, he's working on getting back on it. What kind of headsets we're currently looking at? Some new headsets. Aaron's trying out a lightener. Yeah, noise canceling. You have. What do you use?

Speaker 1  26:18
I it's just job revolve, 65 I think is what I have. Mine's older. Oh, okay, we don't, we don't specialize that much. We're just because we don't spend, okay, there, there, he's back. I don't spend that much time on the phone. So I This works well enough, but if I'd spend most, if I'd spend half the day or more every day on the phone, I'd want something better, probably.

Speaker 2  26:55
So I don't know Matthias, when you were what, what all you were able to hear. But

Unknown Speaker  27:02
we'll see back on again. I didn't,

Matthias Miller  27:07
I didn't catch any of what you said.

Speaker 2  27:09
Can you hear us now? Yes, again. Oh, I just said after your that it's, it's thanks to guys like you and drew that we are, we're able to do what we've done with accounting and Bill materials and so,

Matthias Miller  27:28
so I put Larry's Larry Troyer, his name on the list too.

Speaker 2  27:32
Yeah, yeah. The I didn't realize until yesterday, Dwayne, or the day before, Dwayne, was telling me that, like shed sweet and shed app, both of them, which, you know, market like they're, you know, an ant and tool, do not have accounting. Like, once you dig deep enough, it's like, Oh, you don't do that. Actually, though,

Matthias Miller  27:55
no, in most of these is basically, we'll push payments into QuickBooks. But even even shut up promised a few years I've got a client where we may end up building a custom integration, because they promised, because they're deep in shed hat, and they promised accounting integration. Several years ago, they switched to EBMs because on the roadmap, and two or three years later, it's we know where it's at. I at, like,

Speaker 2  28:24
You mean they, you're the client you're working with, switched to EBMs.

Matthias Miller  28:29
They switched to EBMs specifically because Shut up said we're building EBMs integration.

Speaker 2  28:36
Oh, and they still, they still aren't there. No, but are they? Are they so? Are they running both systems?

Matthias Miller  28:44
Yeah. I mean, all the sales double enter everything at the moment. Ah, making the sales enter payments into EBMs as well. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:56
have you worked at all with fishbowl?

Unknown Speaker  28:59
Fishbowl? Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:01
it's an inventory management BRB, deal.

Matthias Miller  29:08
Sorry, I'm letting a random stranger from the alley into the office. I'm back fishbowl one more time.

Speaker 3  29:14
Yeah. Have you used it at all? You know anything about it? If you've been trying out things.

Matthias Miller  29:22
No, I don't

Speaker 3  29:24
got a company that we're getting involved in that uses fishbowl, and I still need to learn how it works, of course, but they are pushing things into their QuickBooks that is not ready to get there, and should be dealt with over in fishpool side. So I need to learn if you can actually do things with fishbowl, or if it's just a bad program. But I sure hope it's not a bad program, because I would hate to

Matthias Miller  29:53
try to switch them. But inventory management, imagery management, yeah. So, so what we can. Be that bad. It's the number one inventory management software for QuickBooks and zero users, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  30:07
Number one in what users, Brickworks users.

Speaker 3  30:15
We don't know which county they were checking that, but folks,

Speaker 2  30:31
good, well, that was some interesting discussions. So,

Matthias Miller  30:38
so here breakdown. So here's, here's Honeyville, or, I don't know which one you want to take, here's, here's, here's a we have 3000 sorry, we have, we have 30 odd $1,000 in standard costs. We have two, almost $200 in assigned cost. Leaves us with about 2800 in an allocated cost. And so the way we do this then

Unknown Speaker  31:06
is I'm just going to

Matthias Miller  31:10
do this because I think this is the easiest way to explain how it works. And this is very old school, and Dwayne is going to laugh at me, but it's

Speaker 2  31:21
yeah for somebody like Dwayne that eats beef tartare and flies around private jets, he might laugh at it

Matthias Miller  31:28
exactly. He's just gonna have to live with us, your mortals a little

Speaker 5  31:32
bit. You know what? I'm gonna keep my stories to myself the next time.

Matthias Miller  31:38
Oh, don't worry. I'm getting I'm getting your series, even if you people do yourself, I got, I got an in now, right?

Unknown Speaker  31:46
So you have, yeah, you do, don't you

Matthias Miller  31:49
standard cost? So here's the standard cost, and then we have, this is the, can you see? Okay, so this is the allocated cost, which is frozen, plus bomb, and then this is unallocated. And in this case, are we standard cost? In this case, we're dropping. The actual cost is dropping. We can say however it's going to be, but so then we have the the actual cost. And this line goes straight across. And so when we're looking at an individual building, we say the actual cost of the building. We take the allocated costs and take it, take it, take it across, and then we take the unallocated portion and adjust it so that the what do we call? Do we have stuff? We have terms for these on the right hand side,

Unknown Speaker  33:04
the one that you're looking to introduce

Matthias Miller  33:05
go to. Do you remember what those are? Look actual cost, residual. Actual cost. Yeah, this would be this, this. We call them

Unknown Speaker  33:21
residual. Actual cost,

Speaker 1  33:25
which I don't think we show that anywhere on the report, that's just underlying. It

Unknown Speaker  33:29
is underlying. It is just underlying.

Matthias Miller  33:34
Do we have something for the and then we call this the total

Unknown Speaker  33:43
assigned cost.

Matthias Miller  33:47
So if we go back to this, and we don't show these, these grand total num Well, actually, we might, you might be able to see some of them. So we take the so for this, we basically take 197, divided by 21 No, never mind. It's not that we take the 2829 divided by the 24 243, 26 so that's what percentage of unallocated costs on this building. Then we say, then we take the 220 minus, 2141 well, which gives us the so the total assigned cost in this one is 2141 12. So this one is approximately 197 odd $1,000 up here. And then we multiply this percentage by that percentage that we calculated earlier, basically looking at the building translating the nl. Portion. What percentage of the unallocated portion is this building out of the total and then squeezing it down to fit, squeezing or expanding it using waiting to get it to fit into this but the allocated cost stays the same across all buildings.

Speaker 2  35:20
So let me just repeat it back to I think I'm understanding. But would it do the same thing as okay? The way we do it now, we have our standard cost, and then we apply the actual cost, which, let's say it's for this example, it it decreases the amount slightly, like, instead of

Matthias Miller  35:45
$2,000 it's,

Speaker 2  35:48
I don't know, $1,800 slightly less. And then we're basically doing that, but we're keeping the the assigned cost, like we'd say $1,800 minus $200 of assigned cost. No, that. That wouldn't do. Here's

Matthias Miller  36:12
another way to say it. It we basically what we're doing is we're allocating costs the same way that we did, but for the sake of allocation, we're ignoring everything under this line, so we're subtracting out. It's the same as if you would say, I mean, it's basically saying, what's the unknown cost, unknown standard cost. And let's, let's take the actual cost in your balance sheet and divide it out and distribute it across, across that just that portion, or said differently. Let's pretend that. Let's pretend that the bond values are not part of of the building building costs. And let's pretend bond values are not part of the actual period cost, and let's just distribute the remainder

Unknown Speaker  37:05
proportionally

Speaker 2  37:12
so. And this is all working, and in the live system currently,

Matthias Miller  37:17
parts of it are but it's not complete. The bomb freezing isn't done, and some things like that. Well,

Speaker 1  37:24
we're it's we're freezing it. But then I forgot to change the macro for the returns the assigned cost here. So after the next update, that will be fine, if you just apply once you're fine, where it could get confusing as if you'd apply and then the bond value changes, and you would apply again, I think, is that right? That sounds right? Because I think it should be fine the

Speaker 2  37:53
bond value. I don't think the bond value is going to change for the month of May, but we typically end up applying several times until we get it to to be what it needs to be for whatever reasons. So you're saying that should be fine, as long as the assigned bond values. Don't, don't

Speaker 1  38:21
ship, yeah, as long as Yeah, okay, good. Because, I mean how we how it should be working, is once you assign the actual cost, then we freeze the bond value, right now, we store it. But then if you design again, then we'd, we'd re, we'd reset it to

Speaker 2  38:41
whatever. Okay, is that on your side, that you're freezing the bomb value? Is that Josh? Josh thing? Because I know Josh.

Unknown Speaker  38:48
That's on our side.

Matthias Miller  38:50
Okay, yeah, we freeze it. So in the the other major change here is when we, when you put in an actual cost, we'll, we'll freeze the bond value for raw materials.

Unknown Speaker  39:01
Oh, you've added that

Speaker 1  39:04
as items. Okay, so, so what's missing is that the column and the report is always looking at the calculated value, not at the stored value here. Okay,

Speaker 2  39:20
well, I'll try it and but, yeah, I don't think the actual bomb values we have. I mean, the only way we just have a few skews currently populating there, so good,

Unknown Speaker  39:36
so that there's also,

Matthias Miller  39:38
there's actually no harm. I mean, as long as you don't care if bond values mean, but you could, if you recalculate, it will use the new bond values, right? Do change it that might actually be what you want. We should maybe actually drill into that just a bit

Speaker 2  39:59
well. So I know we told Josh that okay, because he was asking about, when do I freeze the bill of materials on a building? Like, when is it at some point you can't change it because it does all kinds of things to inventory. So we had told him, okay, the built date wasn't quite solid enough. Because on custom buildings, you're going to have times when we say, Oh, I forgot to add this and this and this, and go back in and add some items. And then I think we had told him that once we have applied actual cost to a building, like, on a monthly basis after like, well, basically, if we, if we back up to where the the actual cost those time frames, like, You can never,

Speaker 2  41:00
you can't go back and adjust buildings that were either buildings where actual costs have already been applied. You can't adjust the bond.

Unknown Speaker  41:12
So then the change I'm going to make is right,

Unknown Speaker  41:15
yeah, yeah. I

Speaker 2  41:17
think that's right. And yeah, unless you see a problem with that?

Speaker 4  41:22
Good, yeah, good. I like it. Okay,

Speaker 2  41:28
split sales tax, use text, I think that one, well,

Matthias Miller  41:34
think we're I reviewed that with Seth. I don't know where that Seth is that live,

Speaker 1  41:38
yeah, I think it's working in the live system. We Matthias and I made some tweaks to logic, but I don't think the behavior changed. It was just from a code quality standpoint, tweaking a few things.

Matthias Miller  41:53
So then we should probably walk through that a little bit. Yeah. Okay, so let's go to

Unknown Speaker  42:01
share again. All right, so we are at vendors,

Matthias Miller  42:12
sales tax, yeah, and then Ohio treasurer of state, and we're gonna, we're gonna go clean this guy up so we have use tax is filed and paid separately, and it's filed quarterly, and the filing period start month is what drew

Unknown Speaker  42:29
Daniel, right. Boom,

Matthias Miller  42:33
that's the main thing that so now we have a checkbox reporting some checkbox reporting packet separately. But now we have use tax. You can report use tax as sales. You can report it separately, which means it's filed and paid together, or you can file and pay it separately. I mean, it's just in my mind, it just makes sense. And then your sales tax. Let's go sales tax. Let's preview liability. So when you go to Preview of liability now you have two options for Ohio, because they're filed separately. You have a use tax and a sales tax option. So if you want to do use tax, you now get those use tax end dates, boom, nothing, because we didn't have anything in that period, I believe.

Speaker 1  43:25
Well, it's because it was filed already, probably, oh, and so there's Yeah, so there's probably stuff since the end of March, but there shouldn't be anything that fits those date ranges. So as soon as we took over into July, then you should be able to run it for

Matthias Miller  43:41
July, right? And then the sales tax preview, the payment transaction

Unknown Speaker  43:49
is also the same way.

Speaker 3  43:55
Wait, where's the is there a report?

Unknown Speaker  43:59
What's happening there? I don't like that.

Matthias Miller  44:01
It's not feeling that it's showing the wrong period end dates. Yeah, I have used tax. This

Speaker 3  44:10
is because we didn't run any reports for use tax on that yet.

Speaker 1  44:15
Okay, some things go back to the used period end date for the that macro that I'm calling there.

Speaker 4  44:29
Vendor getting the date just five before vendor accessory row is the right for,

Speaker 1  44:46
I mean, if you just Just shoot me that macro on or maybe we can look at it more now too. I don't mind, but I can dig into figure out what's going

Unknown Speaker  44:58
wrong software. Either. Or there's that, and I will just make it super, super easy.

Matthias Miller  45:04
Okay, so well, we don't know why that's showing the wrong thing, but the only time things don't work is on a

Unknown Speaker  45:18
demo, I mean, and then this is, yeah, okay. Very good, sweet.

Speaker 2  45:29
I like how you set that up to those prompts that make me, I don't use it, but it, yeah, I appreciate you guys. Don't just do exactly what we asked for, but think through it and,

Speaker 3  45:44
well, this is the one we went around, around in circles, and finally, just said, Just make something work.

Speaker 1  45:55
It took a fair bit of work. It was, it was just complicated, but we got it there. Well, close, not quite.

Matthias Miller  46:03
We did decide that we need to change terminology in the government. It's weird that you have sales tax and use tax. And sales tax can either mean use tax and sales tax, or it can mean like sales tax, but not the use tax. And so we really need a an overarching terminology for specifically for sales tax and for use tax and for non use tax, and that would make our lives easier.

Speaker 3  46:26
In West Virginia, you actually don't even file sales tax. It's just all use tax, at least in the filing. It is.

Matthias Miller  46:32
It's all just use tax, okay,

Speaker 3  46:34
but it's, it's sales tax compared to everybody else.

Speaker 1  46:42
Maybe our states do have a little too much autonomy.

Unknown Speaker  46:49
Definitely have a lot, at least

Unknown Speaker  46:52
in some areas,

Speaker 2  46:53
yeah, oh, this one, there's nothing. I mean, there's a minor change that Aaron's still needy, but nothing was, this is, did

Speaker 1  47:02
he? Did he reply with so I think Nick, Nick had replied to the last team, but we got

Speaker 2  47:08
Yeah, and then Aaron had, he didn't put it on here. He just, he just emailed

Speaker 1  47:12
me. So he emailed just Nick, I think, so I think he probably should put it on here, but, well, but I mean, I was in on the email thread and I didn't get anything, so maybe it was just just a nick.

Speaker 3  47:29
Well, it's not going to come back on the thread if it's coming from Aaron,

Speaker 1  47:33
right? But I didn't get an I didn't get another email from Aaron. I'll check with Nick then,

Speaker 2  47:39
man, I can just have Aaron upload it to the incident, probably be the cleanest way. Sure that would work. Yeah, it was just a minor um, shifting some things, moving some tapes around, just

Speaker 1  47:53
a little bit, but okay, because Nick had made some you're saying it was after Nick made a second round of changes.

Speaker 2  48:01
Yeah, something, okay, I think some spacing, Yep, perfect. All right, but then we that next one is Seth is waiting on me on that one that's, there's nothing to do there. Or, I think the reporting discrepancies is, yeah, we want to look at that. Okay, so

Speaker 1  48:27
this actually back to the actual cost thing. I chased it down that was, well, that was, it's been that way for almost two years and two months.

Speaker 2  48:39
In your defense, you didn't know it was wrong because we never

Unknown Speaker  48:43
brought it up. It's true.

Unknown Speaker  48:45
That's just how easy we are to work with,

Matthias Miller  48:49
exactly well. Or it speaks to how there's a I learned this this week. Promise we're going to stop rabbit trails. But there's in extreme programming. There's a There's a principle called yagni. And yagni just start stands for you aren't going to need it. It might have been a yagni. Maybe you should listen to the yagni principle. If it's taken two years to actually say, ah, we should probably get something better.

Speaker 4  49:25
Okay, so in this one here,

Matthias Miller  49:30
I did, I just manually pushed this one across, this change across. Just deleted and updated the totals because it was like, that's way easier pushing the new overpayment across death. What I did is the biggest thing is, I modified the accounting impact export to change the subject the accounting impact excludes full transactions, basically like pre accounting impact start date. And so I changed it, changed the subset to just give me this. Particular row that I wanted to import for this particular payment, and then I changed the import. The import has a go void all unmatched transactions thing because

Unknown Speaker  50:17
we expect you to import everything

Unknown Speaker  50:21
out every time. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  50:23
And if we really wanted to make this nicer, we would change it to an X 30 list, which is already x3 list, but have an X 30 list actually do the import. Then have it, sorry, an X 30 to do the important. Then have an X 30 that matches all the same ones, but then wins the opposite. I actually like that. Then we could just run straight up, run this, and you're not going to do anything stupid by accident.

Speaker 1  50:46
Yeah. I mean, at least we have locked periods too. At least we have locked periods, but sometimes a bit, but still, you could cause some major somewhat

Matthias Miller  50:57
sweating bullets, having visions of, yeah, all kinds of accounting history. Consider that would be a case

Unknown Speaker  51:03
of wrecking havoc, not even wreaking, but wrecking.

Matthias Miller  51:08
Yeah, well, the sweat might make maybe I might be wreaking havoc. No, that's true. Have a pun there? Um, so I don't know how much we want to do this in the future. It's really little nail biting and nerve wracking to do some of these things. I

Matthias Miller  51:46
and then it's in Drew's port. And so I locked and unlocked the periods. Let me just show accounting periods for vinyl structures. I did close and we lock after I made those changes. But Drew, you're going to need to go in and add that journal entry, moving from the overpayment

Unknown Speaker  52:03
back to the discount

Speaker 3  52:05
was that on that particular item,

Unknown Speaker  52:10
right? Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  52:13
Like so now we have let me pull it. I'll put a link to the transaction in there so you can see it. But we now have the overpayment here

Unknown Speaker  52:23
that needs to be, well, actually, let's do this.

Matthias Miller  52:34
Actually, it would be from we can even make your life a little bit easier. So the one that I deleted,

Unknown Speaker  52:48
yeah,

Speaker 4  52:54
should be this guy should match the uh, and then this guy would be

Speaker 4  53:11
that guy, which is excuse the word which, horrible formatting. I'm lazy this morning. Um,

Matthias Miller  53:26
so number one's now in Drew's work, good,

Unknown Speaker  53:29
yeah.

Speaker 1  53:31
Are you wanting me to make changes to the x 30 stuff or not? So art,

Matthias Miller  53:35
what do you think like we can make a change that would make it slightly easier for staff in particular, to push old transactions across. I think it's probably a valuable long term thing to do, because what happens if I'm on vacation and I don't know, I don't know what, like in January, and you guys are trying to clean stuff up, or I don't even know what, but, and it's probably, I don't know, Max, two hours of work

Unknown Speaker  54:07
for Seth, but it's also

Matthias Miller  54:09
not something that literally has to be Done.

Unknown Speaker  54:14
Okay? But what? What does this do that?

Matthias Miller  54:22
Yeah, it makes it easier for us to push arbitrary transactions into accounting

Speaker 1  54:30
to do a one off, instead of trying to, trying to rerun all of accounting impact, essentially, right?

Matthias Miller  54:38
Yes. And currently, if you want to do a one off, you have to use extreme caution so you don't accidentally void all of the accounting impact transactions for that type.

Speaker 2  54:49
How often would we use something like this? Is it was this mainly because of 23 stuff or 24

Speaker 3  54:58
that. That's what this one was. But it would be, anytime we want to push something to accounting in a locked period, right? Like we're going to push only one transaction one instance.

Speaker 2  55:16
So why would like, what's different between that and unlocking the period, updating the transaction, and then locking it again, like, just manual, like both you and I some of that

Matthias Miller  55:30
you could manually do that. There's no difference. And we could just say, going forward, that is what you're going to have to do, unless somebody's here to save the day. And I think that would be appropriate. I mean, that's that's

Speaker 3  55:43
appropriate too, okay, wasn't there in this case, wasn't there was no transaction, or it was, it was something

Matthias Miller  55:50
slightly different, okay? But no, no, here's why that doesn't work. Because this was, wasn't this showing up? Why was it showing up on a discrepancy report? No, this was, this is because we were trying to synchronize AR with accounting and so pre 2023 This isn't an issue, and if it is an issue going forward, it's going to show up on the discrepancy report. But if it is for a closed period, you just need to make sure that when you create the transaction, that you properly fill in the event type record ID and RG ID so that we recognize that it's there, but we can certainly walk you through where

Speaker 3  56:31
does the record ID and that stuff come from, and where do we find it if we have took it up,

Matthias Miller  56:39
the record ID in particular,

Speaker 1  56:41
be the numeric ID for whatever

Matthias Miller  56:45
link. So like over here, yeah,

Speaker 1  56:51
here. It's not on the detail screen. It's so num ID if you in the expression evaluator or go on the link, but we're

Matthias Miller  56:59
so nem ID, or on a vendor invoice, it's B invoice, nem ID, building num ID,

Unknown Speaker  57:12
mostly num ID for most records,

Matthias Miller  57:15
assist check system ID, etc.

Unknown Speaker  57:22
So it's so the

Speaker 2  57:25
way this would be used is, is we would have a transaction that we're trying to put into a lows, into a closed period. We would or a several transactions that we we just send it to Matthias or Seth, and you would this would allow you to semi automatically push them in. Is that my understanding

Matthias Miller  57:50
correct? And the and, like you said, the alternative is probably Seth and I telling you exactly what numbers really easiest thing is, here's the numbers, you guys, here's what you need to fill in here. Go manually created, yeah,

Speaker 1  58:03
and couldn't we just run the the report that we would feed into the import and then that the columns would tell you everything you need to put in. It would tell you everything. I think that's good enough.

Unknown Speaker  58:17
Okay, I like it. Okay. So here,

Matthias Miller  58:25
let me show you. Well actually it's not with sorry. It doesn't show it for historic period, so you would still need to change the

Unknown Speaker  58:39
subset to

Matthias Miller  58:47
but we could either way. Even then, we can give you a report that shows you what the record ID and repeating ID and the event type and all that stuff should be, and what what needs to what line items

Speaker 2  58:58
and notes. And then you you take this and manually enter it onto a brand new transaction, and that would make so that this transaction is actually linked to a existing sales order or whatever the

Unknown Speaker  59:14
Okay, yes.

Matthias Miller  59:16
The only downside, no. We do. Let you do it, great. Okay, so we will not doing says where I can generate the report that shows what needs to be manually entered.

Matthias Miller  59:41
Right? I like it to drew this is in your court to add the journal entry. So amount owed is just a matter of

Unknown Speaker  59:58
I. Fixing the logic.

Speaker 2  1:00:07
So with that, okay, there, I know yesterday, we were looking at some the shed time accounts receivable report. There's stuff on there that orders that have been canceled. But would that remove some of those.

Matthias Miller  1:00:24
I would not trust anything with canceled orders at this point on the error report, because

Speaker 2  1:00:29
there was one on there that was canceled. No payment was ever recorded, and it was still showing as we could take a quick look, I think it might be helpful just look at one of those and see if, if you just go to the district X AR report.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:55
Um, the second, yeah, that one and, or Indiana, that's good. Just, yeah, as of that day,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
it's probably just

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
balance on up

Speaker 2  1:01:11
there was down towards the I think that Patrick, no, the mark moment or whatever. I think that's that one. It's getting sold. And I don't think there was a payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
No payments,

Speaker 3  1:01:30
so showing balance due,

Matthias Miller  1:01:33
yeah, yes.

Speaker 2  1:01:38
After the fix, this would would disappear from di report, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:50
Okay,

Speaker 3  1:01:52
because before we were just ignoring cancel, no matter the date, and

Speaker 2  1:01:58
then we wanted to bring in cancel so that if there were payments that were not refunded or whatever it showed as Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:06
good. But so if so, if this guy would have paid $300 we would have a little bit, but after the 17th, it would, what would it show? Because we should be knowing about

Matthias Miller  1:02:26
negative, negative, okay, what do

Speaker 2  1:02:33
you mean after the 17th?

Speaker 3  1:02:36
So it was canceled on the seventh, oh, oh, because if it's if the balance due is that 497, 55 then it should just not show everything's done is taken care of. But if you paid $300 and the balance due is only going to be what's going to be other than that 4497 then we should know about it.

Speaker 2  1:02:59
So the behavior would change to where you're saying after, on the day it's canceled. Then if no payments were applied, if it has no payments attached, then it disappears. If we payment is attached, then it'll show the negative, unless there's an offsetting, like an

Unknown Speaker  1:03:18
Yeah, it would be the net of the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
Okay. Got it good.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:25
Okay, so sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
So this one, I was actually looking at it so, but Seth, can this can go in your list, or if you went the amount owed, the amount owed? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:03:44
I'll probably take it. It looks a little nasty to be working with, but I'm worried about it getting overly complicated.

Matthias Miller  1:03:53
I am slightly worried as well, but I don't I wonder if this, if there's a place for unit tests, we allow record base unit tests,

Speaker 1  1:04:01
don't we? Yeah, we do. I think this would be a great situation. It would be, I don't like the idea, but I like the idea. Yep, I don't want to make unit tests for it, but we probably should.

Matthias Miller  1:04:14
I think, I think there's easy ways around that. But anyway, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
delegate to Nick's

Matthias Miller  1:04:21
sample data. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
I'm thinking to me, Seth, one

Matthias Miller  1:04:31
thing to fall in love with the idea of a thing. It's another thing to fall in love with the thing.

Speaker 1  1:04:38
Somehow, making unit tests and regression tests and stuff, it's a good thing, but I do not like doing it.

Speaker 2  1:04:48
Maybe you have to do like Mark Twain did with the story, what get make motivated to do it for you. And he thinks he's like,

Speaker 1  1:04:59
What is the. It's a solid idea where I just leverage the fact that he's just back and needs things to do, and I have many, many things on my to do list, so I'll hand something off.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
So FTI discrepancies. Is there?

Matthias Miller  1:05:18
I think three to five requires Seth and, or, sorry, me and or Seth to just lock ourselves in a little cave and, like, go poke at it and see what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37
So, AP, discrepancies, anything you discussed. There

Matthias Miller  1:05:44
items that are paid before invoicing need to show up as negatives before invoicing, but won't. This won't, won't our amount owed fix this, because the base balance part of Invoicing is zero.

Speaker 2  1:06:05
But here we're talking about AP or the vendor invoice, like

Matthias Miller  1:06:08
on the vendor invoice, I'm sorry, items, right? No, this could be done.

Speaker 2  1:06:19
Okay, that that Invoicing is what's throwing us off it? I think it's it should say items that are paid before the invoice date or the vendor invoice. Yeah, shows negative. So are they not showing up at all?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40
No,

Speaker 3  1:06:42
there. Oh, what is it? Right? I think that's what it is. You're not showing up.

Speaker 2  1:06:54
Oh, and then it creates a like a positive to AP and reflected on

Speaker 3  1:07:01
the report here, right, right? It doesn't after the fact it shows up okay, like after both dates, but not after the payment, but before the

Speaker 2  1:07:12
end goes to and we're allowing payment date before, if it's marked paid.

Speaker 3  1:07:19
It's kind of funny. It can be, it can be status of paid and paid before the invoice date, but it cannot be prepaid and be the date before. Yeah, I guess that's because it's unverified. If it's more free, but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
required. Thank goodness.

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
So it's basically as of date is less than the B, it's the sum of if the invoice, if this is greater than or equal to the invoice date, then we would have the total B invoice total

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14
KP balance,

Matthias Miller  1:08:17
and it's else it's zero. And then if the B ask as a date is less than the B invoice payment date, or is here, let's do greater than or equal to, then it's minus V, invoice payment amount. Else at zero. And then this becomes stop it.

Speaker 4  1:08:41
This becomes balance, balance. And this becomes,

Speaker 3  1:09:01
yeah, over the end of May, no over the end of April.

Matthias Miller  1:09:05
We said, a date. One, 125, here should be significant. Negative. AV, oh, 612, version

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
two, pretty big. One, 125,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
and then we said, which one should show up? The you have a negative Is this the one the invoice 96188?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:44
Yeah, so it's paying before, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:09:47
we have all kinds of negatives showing up now. So do you want to, oh, email you this link, or email you guys this link, and then you guys can figure out if you. Like it, and then can we please make this a standard report going

Speaker 3  1:10:03
forward? And this would just be an improved payable, say, like this would be a better version than the one we already have, not necessarily a different report.

Speaker 2  1:10:15
Well, this is the report right, right for for right now, until we say it's good, and then you'll turn it into a standard,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:21
or you'll replace the other standard.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
Is there a standard, payable staging?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:27
Um, I think so. Or maybe I'm thinking of, I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
don't think there is. You said seeing one? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:10:37
you send me a link to user reports it is one of those.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:39
Okay, okay, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:10:43
those reports that we need to standardize.

Speaker 3  1:10:45
I was thinking of the undeposited payments month,

Speaker 1  1:10:48
yeah, oh yeah. I barely have any reports on the Accounting tab, so should probably add some.

Matthias Miller  1:11:01
Always room for

Speaker 2  1:11:04
one more. So last thing we had on that is there another fund

Matthias Miller  1:11:12
here? Let's do this. This is

Unknown Speaker  1:11:15
Drew to review

Matthias Miller  1:11:18
SAS I should make to standardize upon

Speaker 1  1:11:21
Nick to standardize. Oh, it's fantastic to have Nick back, and I can just throw him random things to do,

Speaker 2  1:11:35
well liked. So it's like having like, we just smile when we send things. And you say, well, I'll send it to Nick. And then a few days later,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
here it

Matthias Miller  1:11:50
is. Y'all spoiled, see, but nobody's complaining either side. So we're good. So

Speaker 2  1:11:59
VIP, what was it? Sorry, the VIP,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:08
So for that was only monthly meetings.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
Yeah, like two. This

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
is a V VIP, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
So the which one's missing the straight feet, or the 9209

Matthias Miller  1:12:32
undeposited aging Oh, This is this one,

Matthias Miller  1:12:41
almost daily changes in the difference that appear to be coming from credit card payments and Stripe payouts. Excuse me, a

Speaker 3  1:12:58
nod in my stomach so the the balance in the accounting changes a different amount every day, or almost every day, from what the undeposited funds report changes. So like, we have two different things happening all the time, and generally it's based on straight stuff. And

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
yeah, okay, because let me see if I can. I'm going to need some help thinking this through, because my brain, somebody still didn't brew copy this morning, and I'm not taking responsibility for it. So the the on a on a stripe transaction, when we run the charge, we immediately record a payment. And so it shows up as an undeposited, as undeposited where it should, up until, Will, up until the payouts received, right, good. So is this a case in which we are not I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
if it's a if the

Matthias Miller  1:14:13
it's not deposited, or it was deposited after the as of date I

Matthias Miller  1:14:24
and the payment method, this

Matthias Miller  1:14:33
doesn't have no break for transactions at all. I think we said we don't we're not trying to

Matthias Miller  1:14:50
what is an isolated credit card payment. It's not tied to so basically, all that needs to happen is this needs to start supporting. Being

Matthias Miller  1:15:08
so So ultimately,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:18
we need To

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
we tie these out.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:33
I Well, I would say, I would say,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:03
I think it's This,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:11
and I

Speaker 4  1:16:45
a district stripping out

Unknown Speaker  1:16:59
here and here go to the old one as well. So we have, once we have the source payment ID.

Matthias Miller  1:17:12
Does this need to work for really old transactions?

Speaker 3  1:17:19
What do you mean by really old, like in the previous locked period,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27
it's too nice. Let's see. Let's see how old it is. I'm set. Where has RG. I

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
like 2003 No, probably not 2320

Matthias Miller  1:17:50
23 okay, so doesn't have to work prior to 2023

Unknown Speaker  1:17:56
No, or even Prior to 24

Unknown Speaker  1:18:00
Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:20
anything with this one out, there's something else that we're doing here, straight pants these guys move out.

Speaker 4  1:18:43
I'm using the transaction anyway.

Matthias Miller  1:18:56
We're seeing the transaction Dwayne, do you happen to know that the transaction ID is a more specific ID for the specific refund and or specific charge, right? I'm

Speaker 5  1:19:15
not 100% sure, because, like, you can't there is not a it does not seem like there's a specific transaction ID when you run a refund, because, if you because it'll give you the exact same transaction ID, like the the source or the source payment ID, the PI number for the refund as it was the transaction. So, like, if you go try to upload that, it just give you the regular transaction, original transaction, so it doesn't seem like it like Stripe gives you a specific transaction number for the refund. I know screw up your face. I wish it did.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:56
Absolutely Dang. I wanted that gap do it.

Matthias Miller  1:20:00
Nah, because here we see the charge in the refund.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:05
No, like the

Matthias Miller  1:20:08
look, here's here's a charge and a refund same day you guys lost the fees. Yeah, so, but it has a different transaction ID. I think you're

Speaker 5  1:20:16
wrong, yeah, but the source payment ID is exactly the same. Payment

Matthias Miller  1:20:20
idea is the same, but transaction ID is what we need if we want to actually have something unique. And so do we have an so payment?

Speaker 5  1:20:29
I don't. Well, do we do? We store the transaction ID? I think we do.

Matthias Miller  1:20:35
Yes, we do payments,

Speaker 5  1:20:40
but we have no way. We have no way of applying, like it would be really, really cool if through the the admin portal that you could upload by transaction number so it would automatically apply the negative transaction. That would be really cool. Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:20:59
yeah, that's a Josh.

Speaker 5  1:21:02
But it is, it is difficult like from stripes page to get like, to find the actual transaction ID. Is not, is not wizzy wig. I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:21
usually want to stress both of Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:21:24
I guess on this one in particular, We could theoretically add a

Matthias Miller  1:21:37
loc payouts by I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:01
you?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:02
You just in largely subset, you had typed tripe, which was bringing me some joy.

Matthias Miller  1:22:16
We want the arrival date, right? Yes, and maximum versus minimum doesn't matter, but Okay, so then we have this. Then we have uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
so if

Speaker 4  1:22:50
that is in a we can just do this actually. This is better. I and then, if not, is NA So, payment, strike, transaction, transaction, ID, model, date, value, Log, payout, better. By this guy, don't

Unknown Speaker  1:23:42
you like about like

Speaker 4  1:23:48
it's overkill, but we potentially, no, we don't filter it. We don't require you to do that. So it's fine. And then here, here we can Say,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:20
and so payment, Stripe, transaction, so,

Matthias Miller  1:24:40
well, I don't know if it's right, but it's here. 523, linked from the admin page. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:26
Do we not Have a transaction? I

Speaker 4  1:25:40
We don't have a payoff for this one.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:53
Is it

Speaker 1  1:25:57
didn't it? Wasn't it? Wow, I can't words, wasn't that canceled right away, like had

Matthias Miller  1:26:05
a refund. That should still be,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:15
right, but,

Matthias Miller  1:26:18
but even in that case, why would there not be a Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:27
if you

Matthias Miller  1:26:29
know I mean, but this isn't but even if you charge and cancel right away, you're still going to pay $15.47 to strike. So it should be showing up on a payout. I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:47
Right?

Speaker 5  1:26:54
I don't know. So if you refund it, you're saying you still pay the the credit card transaction

Matthias Miller  1:27:02
fees on the on the payout, like it's right? And we saw that in the recent transaction I had pulled up a little bit ago.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:20
I, like I said I don't specifically know. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:27:28
that's a potential issue to start chasing down.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:39
Here's a financing payment. Is this one new?

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
But does financing? Financing, doesn't

Matthias Miller  1:28:02
I? Financing. Financing says it allows deposit.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:13
Is that true?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16
Yeah, because the payment comes into us by check. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:28:22
so let's do this.

Speaker 5  1:28:23
And so if that, if that doesn't happen, I don't know of any situation where we have to refund a customer on a finance that would be a very odd situation, but that would normally cancel out before

Unknown Speaker  1:28:41
was i Let's

Matthias Miller  1:28:50
okay. So obviously I changed something somewhere.

Matthias Miller  1:29:01
So if we have a deposit, we get a deposit date. If we have a strike transaction, we get a strike Transaction Date. Else It's Na and if it allows deposit, I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:18
understand this well, I would I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:29:43
I could be allowed to pause it.

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
Why would it not have been?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:51
Oh, I know why. See if this holds true.

Matthias Miller  1:29:59
It's like. Into a deposit that doesn't have a date.

Speaker 5  1:30:03
Yeah. How does that happen? Because I've, I've come across these every so often. Or how did that happen?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:14
Is it deleted?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:17
But can you delete a deposit date?

Speaker 1  1:30:20
I'm saying no deposit. Somebody deleted the deposit.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:25
If you delete deposit, the link goes away. No,

Matthias Miller  1:30:32
okay, well, here's so this legitimately should be here. Somebody had a deposit, they deleted it. So now this is not linked to the deposit, so it's right. It should be here. Now we have a separate issue, which is,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:47
consider

Speaker 1  1:30:48
what was the ID, the deposit ID, 481, or 747,

Speaker 5  1:30:59
you're going to go search through modification, through activity. I should see who deleted it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
Vanessa sardoma. Or have you seen your name?

Speaker 5  1:31:10
And this is, this is a classic situation I'd love for you guys. 24 you guys could please tell me why it happened even better.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:21
Well, now. Pm, on the eighth of May 2024,

Matthias Miller  1:31:25
deleted to combine to another deleted deposit record for the first payment line item to combine to another deposit record. Okay, she double entered it. Oh,

Speaker 5  1:31:37
look at that. She did what she's posted and left notes. Hallelujah. I love when the people do this.

Matthias Miller  1:31:41
So this is a double entry, and she said, why she did it, but she she deleted it before she got forgot to relink it, and then she didn't have a way to relink it after she deleted it,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
or get rid of the

Matthias Miller  1:31:53
payment on this page, or get rid of the payment of this page. And so this is some kind of

Speaker 5  1:31:59
because she didn't de link it before she deleted it, right? So, why? Why can't what? So, why wouldn't it be if you delete a deposit record, why wouldn't it automatically

Matthias Miller  1:32:13
unlink Well, or just say you can't delete it if there's any linked

Speaker 5  1:32:16
ones, well, that would be, that would be the other way to skin that case, yes,

Matthias Miller  1:32:20
I would prefer that actually, because

Speaker 2  1:32:23
you're saying I make so that you can't delete a deposit record if there's any,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
if there's any link transactions, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:32:31
But I recently had a situation where I, I didn't even I thought you I would have said you can't delete a deposit record, but obviously,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:41
oh, you can do the deposit record

Matthias Miller  1:32:42
after this happened too. I don't know

Speaker 3  1:32:44
this might have been before, because I know we discussed this last year, because we had this same issue,

Speaker 2  1:32:52
because I was thinking I recently had one that a bogus deposit, and I was just going to delete it, and discovered I can,

Speaker 1  1:32:58
if I was doing that as an A deposit ID and

Unknown Speaker  1:33:03
and thank you, but

Matthias Miller  1:33:05
if I put it in here, then I can show what they are.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:17
All right that I wasn't able to delete it until I on, on hope domain, or on LinkedIn.

Matthias Miller  1:33:26
Okay, so we only have two Well, let's do this. The minimum what we can do

Unknown Speaker  1:33:39
is the same deposit. I

Speaker 4  1:33:40
same closet.

Matthias Miller  1:33:45
So let's do all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:49
we're gonna do this and this, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:34:11
save you. Let's see if. Let's see if we can actually i

Matthias Miller  1:34:27
Oh, okay, well, no more, but now we have these cleanups to

Matthias Miller  1:34:38
Drew needs to clean up the

Unknown Speaker  1:34:39
deposits on here. Sorry. Drew, hey, somebody does,

Matthias Miller  1:34:48
um, Drew, can delegate? Do you have a younger

Unknown Speaker  1:34:52
brother? I do, but you don't want him doing anything in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:57
Ouch. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:00
They're good at other

Matthias Miller  1:35:03
things, the Patrick cricket Valley, cold. Daniel Howard barrier. Barrier

Unknown Speaker  1:35:12
is so here's,

Matthias Miller  1:35:17
here's the Patrick Weren't you looking for

Unknown Speaker  1:35:22
i Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:35:24
here's Patrick and Jonathan mark, cricket Valley cricket. And then there's some cricket Valley. But then we have stripe stripe. We expect, expect that Tanner and John, Stripe, stripe. Okay, so now we have stripe things showing up on here, but that's because I'm going to assume what as of due date, one, 125, because the payments were here on one, one. And if I go run this report now for one five, for example, Patrick should disappear. And Patrick's gone because it settled. And so also, let's also change this the deposit date

Unknown Speaker  1:36:13
to actually include stripe

Matthias Miller  1:36:19
deposit, slash

Unknown Speaker  1:36:21
settlement, date,

Matthias Miller  1:36:27
deposit

Unknown Speaker  1:36:31
or set excuse my slow spelling. I

Matthias Miller  1:36:48
Okay, so now, if we go down here, we do see that it was settled in a second,

Speaker 4  1:36:54
and that's why it's in the report. We can also kill these, because these are right.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:08
Um, these deposits to clean up. Where am I going to see them or find them?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:14
I'm in here. Okay, these guys, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:37:20
I was kind of making, I don't know why, narky comment about in the bank.

Matthias Miller  1:37:28
No, the only weird gotcha, most of these are very straightforward, like these two guys. This is just Vanessa's financing mix up. Whatever happened. This one is a, if we don't have the payout for these, Dwayne, can we just unlink them from stripe and make them be unlink credit card charges?

Speaker 5  1:37:55
Well, why do we, why aren't they linked up? I mean, we can figure out what, where it came out of, and we can sure are these linked up stuff in the past?

Speaker 3  1:38:05
Are these payouts? I mean, are these credit card from the other kind of credit card, not the stripe credit card?

Matthias Miller  1:38:14
No, we do have stripe IDs tied to them. So Dwayne, I'm sending you the stripe ID. Can you pull it up in the Stripe account, and what company North Carolina, vital structures, and can you see if you can find the payout for it? Sure I can. I'm not seeing a payout for it. And I wonder if, if, what part of what needs to happen is we go to Josh and say, Hey, Josh,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
can you please

Matthias Miller  1:38:44
push this payout over, or something, I don't know. Again, why is the payout here? When did this?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:52
This was

Speaker 3  1:38:53
somehow we have it accounted for because, and that's a long time ago, and it's been reconciled so, like, we have deposits somewhere that's not connected to this thing,

Speaker 2  1:39:04
yeah. But if it, what does stripe do, if it's if it's run and refund at the same day, they they don't just ignore it and

Unknown Speaker  1:39:11
say they get confused.

Matthias Miller  1:39:12
Is it multi day refunds? Were they if it would have been

Unknown Speaker  1:39:16
a hold, if it

Matthias Miller  1:39:19
would have been refunded on a subsequent day, they keep the fees. But if it's same, fees. But if it's same day, and it's just the whole they just cancel the hold or something, or

Speaker 5  1:39:26
get charged the the PI number that you sent to me does not have a refund. Are we? Are my confusing, two different things here. I have the P I have the payout ID, if you want that.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:37
Um, do you? How

Speaker 5  1:39:39
do you? How do you how do you track your payouts in, in, in here?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:45
Let's do so. This is

Matthias Miller  1:39:48
we. Let's see what I have on here. Yeah, I'll take the payout ID.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:55
I'm back to you. I.

Matthias Miller  1:40:21
Okay, so here's the payout Now, here's the refund.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:28
Oh, 123456789,

Matthias Miller  1:40:33
do you guys remember the we're only getting the first certain number of things in here?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:40
Yeah, I think it was six, but

Speaker 5  1:40:44
I thought we changed that. Okay, I have 10. I have, do you have the Do you have the

Matthias Miller  1:40:50
523 charge on here

Speaker 5  1:40:54
in stripe is a 523 refund? Yes, but there's not a 523 charge in that same

Unknown Speaker  1:41:01
well is the but the 507 is the

Unknown Speaker  1:41:05
Yes, here's the Ego.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:20
Okay, so we have the

Matthias Miller  1:41:21
so we do have the Yeah, the 507 is we have

Speaker 5  1:41:28
what? Hence? Hence the refund. There was 250, 760, ones. Well, sorry, there was two. There was two 520, 308, so and they refunded the one.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:42
Well, it should be another one should

Matthias Miller  1:41:44
be another charge on here somewhere,

Speaker 5  1:41:49
or go look at modification history, just in case somebody didn't put it in

Unknown Speaker  1:41:59
or took it out or did something?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:04
Is there a better

Unknown Speaker  1:42:06
plain text view top right?

Speaker 4  1:42:14
Okay, so here we we added one. Added one. No, well, unless there's a payment,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:29
these are really straight payment rooms, the notepad.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:42
No different building,

Matthias Miller  1:42:43
because the one on this payout, because we're not showing the second charge and the second charge isn't

Speaker 5  1:42:53
on, I will, I will put money on the fact that this is one of those days when when we had issues between assist and stripe. And the first transaction appeared like it didn't run, and yet it ran. And so they ran it a second time, and then we checked into it, and we that probably the second one never got applied into the into the the RG is what I suspect happened. Okay, so it's hard to prove that, but we have, we have enough situations with the, you know, Stripe and error messages to the dealer that probably potential is pretty high.

Matthias Miller  1:43:37
Are you able to get the I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:48
Am I able to get the what

Matthias Miller  1:43:49
a transaction ID for both of those charges for Lucinda? Yeah, but then, then the next question is, how do we actually want to handle this? Because I this is now in 2024, books. I guess we could just add it to the payout.

Speaker 5  1:44:08
Tell me. Tell me the transaction ID that you have that Well, I think you sent this one to me, didn't you? Wvl, okay, so let's go back over here. There's. WB, okay, here's the one that you're missing. Coming back to you,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:27
there's the PI number that you're missing,

Matthias Miller  1:44:34
okay, right? Which is the that's the PI for the charge and refund for the second charge, which is on the payout, but the but the PI for the but the other payout and Pi is missing from the strike payout. Okay, so there's two issues.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:55
Number one, I.

Speaker 5  1:45:01
Yeah, so can't We can't just, can't we just admin, add in that, that missing pi into the RG record, so that we can reflect the refund correctly, and then go over to your your payout and just update it.

Matthias Miller  1:45:15
So we would, I mean, basically add it, add it to the payout, into the payment. Now, all fine and good, but then this is going to introduce an accounting discrepancy. I have no idea how this got accounted for in accounting.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:38
What transactions does it shine?

Matthias Miller  1:45:44
Well, the payout, amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:48
Oh, you know what? That's a

Matthias Miller  1:45:50
good question. I wonder if we have, I wonder if we cover for it somehow.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:56
So

Matthias Miller  1:46:00
Well, how does the amount get

Unknown Speaker  1:46:01
calculated? Let's go with that set a field or a I'll bet you this is what's up. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:46:25
doing

Matthias Miller  1:46:27
27 593,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:30
yeah, so this one.

Matthias Miller  1:46:36
How did we 27 I

Unknown Speaker  1:46:48
world,

Speaker 4  1:46:55
523, I, the 842, We just create a delta. Doesn't

Unknown Speaker  1:47:19
make sense, though. I stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:47:28
This would be 28, 100 I

Unknown Speaker  1:47:52
so we have this plus I'm let's just do

Matthias Miller  1:48:07
this Lean I give it this, this transactions. Can you know this is a primary deposit, so yeah, but the deposit amount

Unknown Speaker  1:48:15
isn't correct, and somehow,

Matthias Miller  1:48:28
did we reconcile? DREW? Did we reconcile when? No, it says it's reconciled. So we need to go to the reconciliation period for February 24

Unknown Speaker  1:48:35
Did you add two together on the

Speaker 3  1:48:37
Well, that's what I'm wondering. Like I'm guessing there's another deposit somewhere to make up for that style.

Matthias Miller  1:48:55
This is why we said this is this February.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:00
Yeah, it is.

Matthias Miller  1:49:03
And so we're looking for,

Speaker 3  1:49:05
yeah, there's a 507 and 61 cent other deposit somewhere

Matthias Miller  1:49:11
to correct a straight payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:19
There it is. I

Speaker 3  1:49:25
Okay, so only that thing needs connected to another payment on this

Unknown Speaker  1:49:32
usso, okay, so this one I

Matthias Miller  1:49:56
and then the sales order is.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:24
Is missing

Unknown Speaker  1:50:33
This one I'm

Matthias Miller  1:51:01
Okay, this is the, this is the that's the ideal cleanup For the

Matthias Miller  1:51:13
but the other thing we could do is

Speaker 2  1:51:26
well, isn't that what we should do? Just unlock that period. Just go ahead and face it.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:32
Yeah, wait.

Speaker 2  1:51:34
Is this all of this, or does Dwayne need to add

Matthias Miller  1:51:39
it's gonna take somebody with, I don't know who it's going to take, but it's, it's not this is beyond Drew's jurisdiction to get this cleaned up. I think because we gotta,

Speaker 2  1:51:52
I don't know. And is there only one like this that was yes,

Matthias Miller  1:51:55
yes, this is the one. It's just one yes, but you need to, so you need to, yeah, but you need to make all three of these changes. And then you need to push,

Speaker 5  1:52:04
um, sorry, I zoned out for just a minute. What I know of two of them. So add it to the RG, add it to the to the payout. What's the

Matthias Miller  1:52:11
third then we gotta, presumably, can we update a reconciled transaction, reopen the recon. Reopen the Recon period. Push the reopen reconciliation period.

Speaker 5  1:52:34
So if somebody can open up that I can make these changes, then I can make the changes, and then somebody can do whatever, push, pull sideways, shuffle, whatever needs to happen, to close it back up again.

Speaker 3  1:52:50
Well, do we need a push, or can we just edit the transaction for the payout?

Matthias Miller  1:52:54
Well, you can, you just need to keep in mind that it's been reconciled, so you need to probably reopen the reconciliation period and make the adjustments,

Speaker 3  1:53:04
yeah, which is probably will allow you to just do that and bust the reconcile, and then almost have to like it again.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:12
So straight payouts. So then this is for vitals,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:16
Matthias. Can you drop me that sales order? URL? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:21
let me just give you the this thing

Unknown Speaker  1:53:28
down at the bottom. So then, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:53:35
let me go give you a is this? Is

Speaker 5  1:53:40
this is this under ideal cleanup? Yeah, so this one's the Miss, okay, got it? Okay, there's the payout. Straight. That's the sales order number, okay, so if I just go start editing the sales order in this this pi number, am I going to get or this payout? Am I going to get blocked? Or is something needs to happen before that? Or am I just free to go make this happen? Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:54:10
you shouldn't get blocked in editing sales order to pay out, but

Speaker 5  1:54:15
just know somebody needs to know that I'm doing this so that they can go account for it in reconciliation.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:20
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody knows already.

Speaker 2  1:54:25
So Dwayne's going to update the sales order, like who you're going to do the accounting site,

Speaker 5  1:54:30
and just to confirm, just to confirm, Matthias, the PI anything, and JC, why the wvl is the ones already there, I can see this modification is your

Matthias Miller  1:54:41
district guide, I don't know, but there's ideally, for the sake of this, you also need the transaction ID. It'd be nice to fill the transaction ID, because we're going to be using that. I'm

Speaker 5  1:54:51
seeing, I'm seeing both stripe IDs and modification history on this sales order,

Matthias Miller  1:54:57
yeah, once for refund, you're seeing the payment ID. Uh, once the charge for one and the refund for the other, but the but the charge for the refunded one isn't in there.

Speaker 5  1:55:12
So when it linked it in, I just added the negative. I linked I linked in the refund, and I just, when it linked in, I just added the negative to it so it shows up as a like a refund. Oh, fun. But okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:55:27
got it

Matthias Miller  1:55:28
gotta make sure that. I mean, I'm repeating myself, we just gotta make sure that the update transaction

Unknown Speaker  1:55:40
to match this.

Matthias Miller  1:55:45
And then the other one that we

Unknown Speaker  1:55:46
wanted was

Matthias Miller  1:56:02
jump on for Oh yeah, I gotta I got another ooh, I just saw the time. I really had to drop. I have to call it.

Speaker 5  1:56:08
Can I ask a two second question before you jump off? What so on the negative transaction on this I added the negative to the 520, 308, but there's not a negative on the which way would the fee go? Positive or negative?

Matthias Miller  1:56:27
I don't know. I have to go. I literally don't have time.

Speaker 3  1:56:29
507 is your final number that got deposited. 507 61,

Matthias Miller  1:56:36
Seth, I'm making you host. You can

Unknown Speaker  1:56:39
take it from here. Okay, yeah, we gotta go too.

Matthias Miller  1:56:43
All right. Thank you guys, Yep, thank you. I'm

Speaker 5  1:56:49
all alone. I have no beside me. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:56:57
think I can really contribute at this point.

Speaker 5  1:56:59
Well, you can contribute by going cooking yourself a steak once your grill gets there, Amazon, what in the world?

Speaker 1  1:57:08
I have no idea. I've never had that. Something just not show up like that.

Speaker 5  1:57:12
I have, it's like, it's, I think what happens is that the shipper lost it, stole it. I don't know. It's like, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:23
that's got to hurt Amazon a little bit. I mean, not much, but as items to lose, that's a little more,

Speaker 5  1:57:29
I think you would. I think we would be astounded if we knew the dollar value of some of this stuff that happens with Amazon. Oh, I'm sure, although

Speaker 1  1:57:36
if you compare it to the percentage of what actually Oh yeah, shows up then Oh, it's nothing. Who cares? But

Unknown Speaker  1:57:44
okay to confirm I am.
