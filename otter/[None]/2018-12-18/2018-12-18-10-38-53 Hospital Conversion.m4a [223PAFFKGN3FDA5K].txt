Hey there, Matthias just thought I'd share

Unknown Speaker  00:06
something interesting with you.

Unknown Speaker  00:09
I was just here at the

Unknown Speaker  00:15
cert surgeon practice or whatever, the

Speaker 1  00:17
medical practice where I got

Unknown Speaker  00:22
operated on about two weeks ago

Speaker 1  00:26
for a follow up visit for my hernia operation. I'd mentioned you before. Anyway,

Unknown Speaker  00:34
I was

Unknown Speaker  00:36
checking out and

Speaker 1  00:39
I got chatting with Secretary and mentioned her. So I work for software development company, custom software, and we're exploring the needs within

Unknown Speaker  00:55
the

Speaker 1  00:55
medical within medical practice. And she kind of lit up and she

Speaker 1  01:03
explained that their medical practice surgical practice had recently

Speaker 1  01:10
like nine years ago, had joined or became a part of a larger hospital system here in the area, because she is like, it's just so expensive to try to keep up

Unknown Speaker  01:26
competitive practice. And

Unknown Speaker  01:30
insurances are paying looking to pay last

Speaker 1  01:33
and operation or fences are so high that it's just easier to join an existing network or existing hospital system and be managed by them.

Unknown Speaker  01:50
And so I asked her,

Speaker 1  01:53
or she mentioned that they had these epic, which I I'd seen that when I was in, like, where they take down all the patients is information and such. And I asked her as like, so I'm just kind of curious

Speaker 1  02:06
what what would you say are your largest pain points

Speaker 1  02:10
and operations and she said, Well, the software isn't

Speaker 1  02:18
specific enough for our needs. It's

Unknown Speaker  02:25
it's a big

Unknown Speaker  02:29
system for the entire their entire medical

Speaker 1  02:35
medical group or whatever. And she said, it's not as specific as it could be for their specific practice

Speaker 1  02:44
and use like, but there's, there's no way they'll they'll go with a custom software, probably because everyone needs to use epic

Unknown Speaker  02:53
to sing well with our network.

Unknown Speaker  02:57
So anyway, their pain point

Unknown Speaker  03:00
it's not

Speaker 1  03:00
customized enough, which is our advantage over epic. The

Speaker 1  03:09
our challenge is that we're customized and we're not

Speaker 1  03:18
maybe I shouldn't say customize our challenges that our software

Unknown Speaker  03:25
isn't necessarily

Unknown Speaker  03:29
a good fit, probably for

Speaker 1  03:32
large medical practices. But I'm wondering after chatting with her if our target could or should be small

Unknown Speaker  03:43
practices

Unknown Speaker  03:45
that needs something customized

Speaker 1  03:46
that something like epic, or there's big names, big name software's designed for large hospitals and such,

Speaker 1  03:58
they they might not be able to, to fit the exact needs of a small medical practice that needs things customized for their specific practice,

Speaker 1  04:10
and we might be able to undercut them in price because I have a feeling epic is pretty expensive.

Speaker 1  04:18
So what am I saying here, I'm just kind of rambling with thoughts after chatting with the secretary. But I'm wondering if

Unknown Speaker  04:27
we need to

Speaker 1  04:30
not only consider sector but also consider

Speaker 1  04:34
size because that makes a huge difference. And I don't think our

Speaker 1  04:40
software is going to be able to compete with the big names

Speaker 1  04:47
when it comes to large medical chains or medical

Unknown Speaker  04:55
networks

Unknown Speaker  04:56
but we very well could compete eat

Unknown Speaker  05:01
on a smaller level or smaller scale with smaller practices,

Unknown Speaker  05:06
we might be able to help keep them afloat

Speaker 1  05:10
to protect them from having to merge with large networks

Speaker 1  05:15
where they'll be restricted on what they can do or can't cannot do and they won't be at the independence

Speaker 1  05:23
so as I'm talking I'm wondering if this is our pitch

Unknown Speaker  05:29
higher up

Unknown Speaker  05:32
know

Unknown Speaker  05:33
me start over

Speaker 1  05:37
you being impacted by the increasing

Speaker 1  05:42
costs of or the increasing operation operational costs for your medical practice?

Unknown Speaker  05:51
Are you facing

Unknown Speaker  05:54
the possibility of having to

Speaker 1  05:58
merge with a larger group practice to keep afloat and risk

Unknown Speaker  06:04
the

Unknown Speaker  06:07
risk

Unknown Speaker  06:08
independence

Speaker 1  06:10
and the vision you have for your practice? consider hiring us to create a custom software solution for you to help streamline your processes and cut your operational expenses.

Speaker 1  06:29
I don't know I'm just throwing that out as a possibility.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Be curious to hear your thoughts.

Unknown Speaker  06:36
Have a great day. Matthias
