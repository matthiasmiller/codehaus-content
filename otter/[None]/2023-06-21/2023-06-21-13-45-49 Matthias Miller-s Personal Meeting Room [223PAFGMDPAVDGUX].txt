Unknown Speaker  00:40
Well that's cool Why is my thing not working? I don't know about now talk to me and Lou Why oh why? Why aren't they workI?

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Oh about now let's try now

Matthias Miller  01:11
there we go

Unknown Speaker  01:16
nice

Unknown Speaker  01:23
cool so

Speaker 1  01:30
well how many fire trucks do we need to run to this thing? Apparently it's things be happening. So what's new?

Unknown Speaker  01:40
It's not new.

Speaker 1  01:42
What's not new? I'm gonna go into politics. I'm going to go become a politician. Getting good at it. And I think I can go for wrangling amishman to wrangling congressmen. Haha. That's funny. It was meant to be funny.

Unknown Speaker  02:14
Cool. Let's do something.

Speaker 2  02:19
Something useful or something else? Something useful. All right.

Speaker 1  02:26
Apparently, I had nothing to put to the list because I've been chasing lat buildings for the last several days and have no brain power. Okay, well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  02:37
sounds more like a leg workout than anything but

Unknown Speaker  02:42
yes, yes. Yes, indeed.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
All right. Where do we want to? This one is taking care of

Unknown Speaker  02:55
which one

Matthias Miller  02:57
sort qualified leads by qualification? No, actually, that's not taken care of.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
All right.

Matthias Miller  03:08
Let's talk about you're talking about unread marks. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
What were you wanting to see? What do you mean?

Matthias Miller  03:22
Think we talked about this? Were you on board with adding unread marks and just seeing how it works? Or do you have a problem with it?

Unknown Speaker  03:35
Okay, um,

Speaker 1  03:37
okay. It's okay. I don't have a problem with it. How? Okay, how do you how is it expected to work is just

Unknown Speaker  03:45
your Have you seen it in the wiki? Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:48
I mean, I'm familiar with with it, but okay, in the in the scope of an opportunity, what's going to dictate read or unread?

Matthias Miller  03:57
Somebody modifies the opportunity. So

Unknown Speaker  04:01
basically, first time you open it, I think. So. But

Speaker 1  04:08
if I Okay, hypothetically, if I logged in on my side, they would always show every single one is on red. For me, there's no way Yeah. So then there's no way to tell based on if the dealer has opened them up on our side.

Unknown Speaker  04:27
Yeah. Okay. All right, fine. Okay. Um,

Speaker 1  04:41
what is the sort qualified leads by qualification date?

Unknown Speaker  04:44
So,

Matthias Miller  04:47
Tim was asking after Floyd was asking.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
If you

Matthias Miller  04:53
once you qualify a lead, it moves over into the qualified section. If we could subsequently I'm filtered based on qualification date.

Speaker 1  05:05
So you just kind of put the put the qualification date in the column and you click the column. Is that what you're thinking?

Unknown Speaker  05:10
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:11
I mean, we would auto sort by that. I think the idea is, I mean, it's, it's kind of RFM applied to each stage of the process. So you always, you know, you're most recent leads, those are the ones I mean, you should look at recency of, of new leads, you should look at recency

Unknown Speaker  05:25
of qualification.

Matthias Miller  05:28
Okay. I think rationally makes sense. It just wanted to run it past your picture. Are you okay with that?

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Oh, no problem. Okay. Um,

Speaker 1  05:42
an orgy of follow ups? Or could we base it on your family, such as we did with communication?

Matthias Miller  05:49
This is your idea. I think so you're gonna have to sell me on it.

Unknown Speaker  05:52
What? It's my idea.

Unknown Speaker  05:56
You have an orgy of follow ups?

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, if you don't,

Unknown Speaker  06:03
what was my idea?

Unknown Speaker  06:08
Where else would have come from? That's a loaded question.

Matthias Miller  06:14
It's, it's a little bit of elimination. I don't think any of my guys

Speaker 1  06:21
okay. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, no, kids. Okay. Okay, I'm following now. I'm following now. I'm following now. Sorry, this was

Unknown Speaker  06:29
my idea.

Matthias Miller  06:31
Yeah, it was like a, I want you to follow it. 137 weeks out.

Speaker 1  06:35
We had talked and we had talked about doing like a default thing where it's expected to, but I would I would renege on the default thing. But basically, where you can say, follow up one follow up to, you know, follow up with these dates and times and etc?

Unknown Speaker  06:51
You don't? I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  06:57
It's gonna make your it's going to make your follow up report fairly more complicated, wouldn't it?

Matthias Miller  07:05
Well, one of the things you could do as well is

Speaker 2  07:09
have your follow up report, if you don't set a follow up report. Okay, like, you could do a Fibonacci

Matthias Miller  07:16
based on first and origination date. And so say if you have, you need to have at least one follow up by day one, two by day, day two, three, by day five. And if it's not, then it shows up in your follow up list, you should follow up

Speaker 2  07:33
with this guy. Something like that. So this

Speaker 1  07:36
was if I remember, right, this was based on what I saw some Ohio guys doing, nobody else is asking for it currently, is that right?

Unknown Speaker  07:44
Yeah, you're right. And what are the Ohio guys doing? So

Speaker 1  07:51
they have they have a whole process built around, follow up dates and times. So whenever they have a new lead, they always spin out X amount of follow ups based on their process. So I'd say let's ignore this thing for now.

Matthias Miller  08:08
It seems like it's more it's more of a more of a sales team process issue.

Speaker 1  08:15
The only answer could be is I really want to Okay, okay, can you can we put a pin in two conversations this one and

Speaker 1  08:30
I'm just gonna make myself in there. I'm gonna I'm gonna write these down because I don't feel okay. So

Matthias Miller  08:37
me mean I can also put it under the truepoint project over my and if you want me to keep track of it,

Unknown Speaker  08:43
make a note

Unknown Speaker  08:51
Well, we're going to talk about these issues. I want to talk about this right this moment. Okay, oh, one more thing. I gotta break down

Unknown Speaker  09:16
hopefully I can understand my own chicken scratch. Okay, what's next?

Unknown Speaker  09:21
Okay,

Speaker 1  09:22
get it sorted second, communication records sorted to the top of the list.

Unknown Speaker  09:30
Isn't that what it's doing now?

Speaker 2  09:36
Second communication record. Did I change that sales?

Matthias Miller  09:43
No, it's the in the CRM opportunities.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
Oh, you're saying it's sorting of opportunities.

Matthias Miller  09:53
If you have a weakness is kind of like a

Speaker 1  09:59
frog. That's good. that's going to destroy your sort by qualification date then.

Unknown Speaker  10:03
Right?

Speaker 1  10:07
This is basically both of those are basically this whole warm, hot lead conversation. Correct.

Speaker 2  10:14
Okay, here's the story. Floyd, had somebody fill up, fill out a type form.

Matthias Miller  10:20
Before he had a chance to get back to them. They feel that a second type form, he wanted it at the top of the list.

Speaker 1  10:28
Tell them it doesn't matter. He's going to transfer it over into high level anyway.

Matthias Miller  10:32
So snarky answer is why didn't you follow up with the first time?

Unknown Speaker  10:37
It's not the answers What Why didn't you

Matthias Miller  10:39
call it was the first time

Matthias Miller  10:48
me or is the Indiana sales? Well, NSCLC was a very different culture. But anyway, so no,

Speaker 1  10:52
no, it's Floyd it's not the Indiana sales team. It's Floyd Floyd, he is a needy little

Unknown Speaker  11:03
salesperson. Anyway, that's fine. I don't

Speaker 1  11:11
care if you want to whatever you want to do with that thing. You're gonna have to decide between that qualification date really?

Matthias Miller  11:21
Well, I mean, what are you going to do change the origination date? Do you want to sort by recency of I mean, you could actually change this to sort by recency of could you sort them both by recency of last communication? Pains? Two birds one stone

Unknown Speaker  11:43
communicated would be at the top.

Unknown Speaker  11:50
So you're saying, Sorry, I missed that you broke up.

Speaker 1  11:53
I said. So all pains would sort based on recency of communication. Yep. So you're most so if you communicate with that customer, and he's going to be the top Yep. Oh, man, is that there's no way let me ask you this. Is there any way we can do some of this conditionally, you could say click this button and it'll sort this way click this button will sort it that way. And you could literally like give them the options in the way they want to sort them sort by qualification dates or by last communication record sort by etc, etc. You name it.

Unknown Speaker  12:31
Well, this this feels a little bit

Speaker 1  12:34
like you're going to do it one way that somebody else is going to complain say I want it the other way and then the expert is gonna say whatever they want it this way as well. Okay. Maybe I'm maybe I'm being pessimistic.

Unknown Speaker  13:07
See

Matthias Miller  13:18
I mean, okay, so I know it's gonna have to go under this,

Unknown Speaker  13:21
be sure you do that. It's gonna have to go under here. And the main ask prompt, II

Matthias Miller  13:38
unless we have something that says, I mean, maybe we could have this report.

Unknown Speaker  13:45
Let's do that single pane we

Matthias Miller  13:49
could let you pop out this report and have it sorted differently. So have it under here. So the main report sorts by one way. And you could pop out in sort of different way

Speaker 1  14:03
sounds like it's gonna be hard for them hard to explain. Great for you and I but

Unknown Speaker  14:11
they don't new.

Speaker 1  14:14
I wish we could just put a bunch of date columns and say we'll just put the column in. It'll give you two different ways to sort it. Yeah. Like there's the last communication column. There's the last you know, there's the what's the other one that was you're asking for the qualification Date column, and it's like, click Oh, sword, sword again.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
I don't know. Like

Unknown Speaker  15:02
Okay, bottom line, at any given time, you know, let's

Matthias Miller  15:06
let's just go ad 20 Here 20% of the leads that you really should be focusing on, there's of those 20. There's another 20%, which means there's 4% of your total lead flow, that you really should be hyper focused on 20% that she should be moderately focused on the 80% You're just killing time. And or maybe you're letting them die? I don't know.

Speaker 2  15:28
So how do we move those to the very top of the list?

Matthias Miller  15:34
Like that? I mean, that's the bottom line, how do we make sure that the things they should be focused on is always at the top?

Speaker 1  15:46
Alright, so I'm pulling up. So what happens what happens in high level rest sort by date added sort by deal value, that's all they get. Filter by status open, add a filter last changed August, you can add a whole bunch of things interesting.

Matthias Miller  16:06
I think we just say, for this particular request, you and I make an executive decision that Floyd asked for this for a 1% of the time situation. And considering the source and the frequency and

Unknown Speaker  16:21
education they are for the other ones, I'm

Matthias Miller  16:24
not the qualification date for the

Speaker 1  16:27
communications record. Well, why does it matter to him? He's not using the second Oh, that's okay. Nevermind, because he, I see what you're saying. Yeah. But the second communication record is going to have different it's going to have different effects for like, great, it's for it's great for someone who, okay, you got a second communication, you want it to pop back up to the top Great.

Unknown Speaker  16:48
Yeah, but that means anybody

Speaker 1  16:48
who makes the communication then it that flows back up at the top again.

Matthias Miller  16:53
Well, I mean, you could second type form entries. Or you know, what happens when they reply? Yes. To the auto responder which side note, I found out that integration was broken recently. So those aren't coming in. But like, if the replay yesterday auto responder, should that pop up because it's a sign of life?

Unknown Speaker  17:17
You want my honest opinion? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:19
I don't have one.

Speaker 1  17:21
Okay. So I'm gonna say, whatever you want to do with this. I don't know what to tell you. Because this kind of all of all of this is, this is what happens when you build software for a bunch of people is you can't keep them all happy.

Speaker 2  17:39
No, you can't it's find the best people to keep happy and keep them happy. Indeed. Okay.

Speaker 1  17:48
Otherwise, you tend to make the you keep the noisiest people happy, which is generally not always the best option.

Matthias Miller  17:54
Well, you know, one of the things I've learned is it really does help to be noisy. So I'm doing that

Unknown Speaker  18:02
is true, it doesn't have to be noise.

Unknown Speaker  18:06
And if I figure I'm

Matthias Miller  18:09
not obnoxious enough. Anyway, I think I'm level headed enough with my requests. And I'm pretty good. I'm good with that.

Speaker 1  18:17
The auto crate contact and opportunity thing? Yes, sure. Great. Is there a new let me ask you this. Right now. I think the create contact button only shows up on the to do report. Can we make that show up also for CRM opportunities, the new contact?

Unknown Speaker  18:37
Click on to do Sorry, and to do

Speaker 1  18:42
so New Contact shows up there. But it would sure make sense to also have it show up for CRM on the CRM opportunities page.

Matthias Miller  18:51
Except this new contact needs to be this is the one we need to revamp Yes. Do you wanna do that now? Sure. So this would be actually this is going to have to be a

Unknown Speaker  19:15
we're going to start with this

Unknown Speaker  19:43
we're gonna do a

Unknown Speaker  19:52
and we're gonna head

Matthias Miller  19:59
no phone and eat Not

Speaker 2  20:00
required they can put that in themselves and so we're going to do matched records

Matthias Miller  20:08
skipped unlike match lines create false contact type equals

Unknown Speaker  20:17
customer

Unknown Speaker  21:26
should we ask her sales reps could I kind of like asking for it

Unknown Speaker  21:33
it will be auto imported right

Unknown Speaker  21:37
yeah

Unknown Speaker  21:43
thank you

Matthias Miller  21:53
let me do a Save As we straighten out your life

Unknown Speaker  22:12
Wow

Unknown Speaker  22:21
What are we doing yeah I can make a guess

Speaker 1  22:30
I have a feeling that inside Office is pushing updates to from the SKU data sheet which just become a process hog every single time they do it

Unknown Speaker  22:47
what's not shown up on here

Unknown Speaker  23:09
that would be why would I just screw up

Unknown Speaker  23:22
Yeah, I know it did

Unknown Speaker  23:34
strike this

Speaker 1  24:29
Wait a minute. So, is this logs thing? Is it on the menu somewhere?

Unknown Speaker  24:36
No. Literally all

Speaker 1  24:38
I gotta do is put punch in forward slash logs and I can go look at this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  24:43
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  24:45
I learned something new today. This is gonna be fun.

Speaker 2  24:51
Yeah, it is. Speed benchmarks. Good green. Web Services I can't mess anything

Unknown Speaker  25:05
up in here right? It's just logs

Matthias Miller  25:07
No it's just logs you can't miss anything up looking at it

Unknown Speaker  25:10
okay

Unknown Speaker  25:16
ah

Speaker 1  25:17
rebuilds the shared cache detailed email send

Unknown Speaker  25:37
welcome

Speaker 1  25:37
confused why is the last email sent January 28 2020 did nothing since then

Unknown Speaker  25:46
we stopped logging them Security security reasons?

Matthias Miller  27:50
Sorry I'm gonna go ahead and file a bug report

Unknown Speaker  28:07
no way that correct. We have an unrecoverable error. I feel like that some days I had an unrecoverable error

Speaker 2  28:18
former boss used to like telling this to go ahead Sorry, I just finished telling the story

Matthias Miller  28:23
about somebody who's very the error message that they thought should never show up. And they said that big cataclysmic error has occurred indeed and then it showed up for a client and the client absolutely freaked

Speaker 1  28:37
out do me a favor look at your notifications Bell and tell me what the system alert is

Unknown Speaker  28:49
which other system it's it's just

Matthias Miller  28:56
it happened somehow with the timing of the update that Josh rolled out.

Unknown Speaker  29:00
It's gonna go away.

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Well, it's been there for a couple of weeks now.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
And it's I guess it's nothing to worry about.

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Oh, you say couple weeks?

Unknown Speaker  29:16
Oh, yeah. At least two weeks.

Speaker 2  29:21
Like more than one update? Yes. Well

Speaker 1  29:29
wait, it might have happened since the last update which I think we're almost two weeks on an update. So

Matthias Miller  29:34
yeah, 611 10 days. So I'm gonna guess it's it's gonna go away in the next update.

Unknown Speaker  29:39
Gotcha. So nothing.

Matthias Miller  29:43
Nothing to worry about. Looks like this. This guy. Okay, so then

Matthias Miller  29:52
okay, I don't know what happened. We'll see. We'll have them chase it.

Speaker 2  30:25
All right, well, I need to switch over to my phone.

Matthias Miller  30:33
And so I think this thing can still stay on there. And maybe we can talk about visibility in the site checks or online and talk about

Speaker 2  30:44
transit for lot buildings, and things that are in the queue to be delivered. Do we need a screenshare? for that? No, I'm gonna switch over to my left. Actually going to it, I'm going to tether and just keep rolling on this

Speaker 2  31:43
There we go. Now you can hear me? Indeed, maybe, I guess. Good.

Unknown Speaker  31:55
Alright, so

Matthias Miller  31:58
visibility into site checks.

Speaker 1  32:03
If we can quantify that when we can we can give visibility to I don't know how you're gonna quantify it. Did you ever did we ever did you ever figure out whether we're doing from Marissa whether we're we're doing it on quotes or how it was? How are these things being generated?

Unknown Speaker  32:23
Well,

Matthias Miller  32:26
I'm gonna suspect she wants both ways. And I think the question was, unquote, what is the workflow for these things to

Unknown Speaker  32:33
get created?

Unknown Speaker  32:41
We have any example just.

Matthias Miller  32:45
But she texted me an example. And it was a repo. I'm like, well,

Unknown Speaker  32:49
that's not gonna work. Doing a site check on a repo. It was called a retrieval. It was a Drew's.

Speaker 1  33:02
I mean, ideally, what I need from her is an active site check, like one that you absolutely know is not built, not not delivered? Not not a whole bunch of things. And we can we can nail it down.

Unknown Speaker  33:24
Well, but can we

Matthias Miller  33:25
also reverse engineer some of that if you need to?

Unknown Speaker  33:33
Oh, let's

Speaker 1  33:34
see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see logistics transit tasks.

Matthias Miller  33:42
Derrick Lewis, which party day and it looked up, Derek. Like, all I found was in retrieval for the guy.

Speaker 1  33:51
Site check. So check. Cancel that day to day did site check site prep site check. There's only very few site checks. Currently, completion date. These are currently open. What was generally scheduled date scheduled date, okay. 629 623. Here's a couple 623 that's on a sale. That one's just a straight up on. Okay, so that one's on a sale

Speaker 1  34:29
and that one's not even get it at all. Where's this one? Let's see. This guy right here is that's that's a Roger Johnson. Nevermind. That's North Carolina, North Carolina. I've got two currently scheduled we need to see if we get a little metal that's a DMS one. Who's this one? That's a ginger one. She doesn't have any currently I don't think Ah, 629.

Matthias Miller  35:02
I mean, I think one of the answers might be a school read report for all site check types, and see if they're linked to a statin or an soI D.

Speaker 1  35:13
Oh, the other i The other thing is that we give them read only access to if we can get read only access to the transit tasks. Report, which I thought you don't hadn't, you

Matthias Miller  35:28
know, we know we said we don't want them to have everything. Yeah, but no, we get

Unknown Speaker  35:35
a report on it. I'm sure we did. It was

Matthias Miller  35:38
It doesn't include sites. I mean, it might it. I don't know that site checks it, we only did it for sales.

Unknown Speaker  35:44
Well, but I mean, that's the only time I'm seeing them.

Matthias Miller  35:48
So I mean, the answer for Marissa is we don't currently have a process to tie out pre sale site checks to a to a quote,

Unknown Speaker  35:56
well, technically, we would.

Unknown Speaker  36:00
But if she,

Matthias Miller  36:01
here's what she can do, in the case that she needs to maintain status on a site check, email, or message, your office dealer support, and get a link to the site check transit tasks, and she can check in on it manually.

Unknown Speaker  36:16
Cuz, sure.

Speaker 1  36:18
If you give them I mean, did do they? Do they have? I don't think they have access to that detail screen.

Unknown Speaker  36:24
Oh, they don't?

Speaker 1  36:28
Well, no, but I mean, if you give them access to the detail screen, what stops them from making a change to it?

Unknown Speaker  36:35
Right. Good point.

Speaker 1  36:37
Now, if we said, okay, no, no, no, no. Okay. What if we? What if we wrote a report somewhere, put it somewhere that basically says punch in your sales order, quote, or sales order? I don't, I don't currently see any site checks tied off to a quote when that's not true. Right, here's one back in March.

Matthias Miller  37:00
But these don't get tied out to quotes, then that doesn't really help.

Speaker 1  37:04
Well, they can be tied out to a quote. And if we get it,

Matthias Miller  37:08
we just told logistics they have to, can we told logistics they need to tie these things out

Unknown Speaker  37:15
to quotes?

Unknown Speaker  37:31
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  37:32
how, how edge case is this?

Matthias Miller  37:38
I would like to have something that's good that is relatively lightweight and puts the majority of the burden back on Marisa not on logistics. And so if we could do something like have a permission, is there a permission that controls who can edit transit tasks? Now, if we would add a permission for who can edit transit tasks?

Speaker 1  38:01
Well, okay, but why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we say? Why wouldn't we, if they're requesting a site check? And we tied it off to a quote number, we could give them the same exact transit test report for quotes.

Matthias Miller  38:19
Well, does logistics want to time out the quotes? Well, I mean, it's I don't see

Unknown Speaker  38:23
any reason why not.

Matthias Miller  38:25
Okay, and if she can't find it, then she calls it logistics and say, Hey, I had a site check for this. Can you tie it out to one of my quotes? So you can so I can find it?

Unknown Speaker  38:33
Yeah, why not? Well, that was easy.

Matthias Miller  38:38
So okay, so

Speaker 1  38:39
Marissa, that's tomorrow. That's not what I wanted to where am I going here? He touches a lot building sales quotes, quotes. Yeah, let's drop it in the one of the pains just like we did for sales,

Matthias Miller  38:53
sales, but then we're going to want to pass in when we do the search for it. Do we need to pass in the skin so we can search by skin or?

Speaker 1  39:01
Okay, by stinner sales? So sales order is what I would

Matthias Miller  39:04
say. So you'd have you'd have a prompt and if it matches either

Speaker 2  39:10
of those. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  39:15
So I'm here I can go a little bit overtime if you can.

Unknown Speaker  39:20
So sales

Matthias Miller  39:22
portal, Virginia, ginger, I'm going to switch to another Wi Fi give me a second

Speaker 1  39:37
Weren't you concatenating notes on this I'm pretty sure you were sittings notes, columns notes. Yes. You're concatenating notes perfect. Yeah, that's exactly what what

Unknown Speaker  39:48
Yeah. You have a little dinosaur little dinosaur.

Speaker 1  39:58
See, nevermind. Let's keep going all right ignore ignore my comments.

Matthias Miller  40:05
So then here we have this guy which is a ask prompts

Unknown Speaker  40:10
the Ask steppin.

Speaker 1  40:18
Okay, here is the dirty little secret that I'm pretty sure is going to happen. And this might, this might be why Logistics is not tying them out to quotes because the moment that thing converts to a sale, you just broke the connection between the transit test and the quote. Why? Because the, I don't think the transit Sales Order field is validated.

Unknown Speaker  40:47
And so the ID changes,

Unknown Speaker  40:49
but it's breaks it

Unknown Speaker  40:52
what part of the ID changes the q and N.

Unknown Speaker  41:01
Which is kind

Speaker 1  41:01
of ugly, because now it would still be tied to the building, which the building step number doesn't change. So maybe we only, maybe we only pass in the stin for it. But to a degree, it's going to break somewhat, which is ugly. I wish I wish that field was validated.

Unknown Speaker  41:23
Well, then we should. But then, but that happens. But that happens

Matthias Miller  41:32
after you populate the fields, you populate the field the ID changes.

Speaker 1  41:36
Because in theory, in theory, transit tasks were not to be created. They were created by automation, or, you know, when the sale happens, we never really accounted for the fact of it being pre sale, which is probably something we should have done, but it's not something we did.

Matthias Miller  41:54
Why can't we just require them to be tied to a standard reports?

Unknown Speaker  41:57
Fine.

Matthias Miller  42:02
So you cannot put a quote in there because the ID changes so we validate against.

Speaker 1  42:09
And that's fine. If we only pass in, if we only pass in a steppin based off the base off of the sales or building sales order buildings, piston or whatever, that if we pass in that if we pass into the skin, always then fine. It should work, because the building still doesn't change, even though it becomes a sale. So, okay, that being said, then what happens is you know what, you know, it would be actually genius level, do I want this or not? I was gonna say create an X 30 that creates a transit task on the stin that a deal. We want a dealer being able to create their own site check. Ooh, interesting.

Speaker 2  43:06
Maybe? Me to answer. So I'd be alright, so we're gonna do? So here's this one. I'm going to do this ID. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  43:22
you know, oh, you know, what?

Unknown Speaker  43:26
Do this, then we get that,

Speaker 1  43:31
you know, we should have done we should have tracked the sales what are known ID into the transit task rather than the sales look, or ID because then it would have been it would have validated

Unknown Speaker  43:40
that it would work, because that's constant.

Matthias Miller  43:44
And the other thing we could play around with is converting the SL ID from a code ID checking for both the scope. I mean, there's the number itself change, it's just the prefix, we could change it we put the prefix.

Speaker 1  43:57
Well, okay. Well, okay, well, we're it'll work for you, you can build reporting for it.

Unknown Speaker  44:15
Transit stents is there's a technical reason why this isn't? No, here's what we do.

Speaker 1  44:30
Here's what I'm afraid is going to happen. dealer is going to contact logistics and say, here's a quote number tie a transit test to it. That's exactly what somebody here in my office is going to do. And they'll probably forget to tie it also to a certain number, which means that as soon as that thing becomes a sale, it breaks. Now it wouldn't break from the building side. If they remember to tie in a step number instead of the just the sales order number but then the sales order might change and who this this this feels like it could it could be less than bullet proof

Speaker 2  45:04
Okay, but why couldn't we say when you type in when you type in Q two

Matthias Miller  45:10
or three we look for when tied to n and the type in one we look for one point

Unknown Speaker  45:13
Q

Speaker 1  45:18
you're staying you're saying search based on it minus prefixing

Unknown Speaker  45:28
effectively Yes

Matthias Miller  45:37
Yeah, except I don't know what I don't know maybe maybe Oh weird it's also a little weird to have an ID that

Speaker 1  45:53
well, okay. Unless Unless we said unless we always instructed dealers to ask for site checks that are not sales to be tied to the building and don't talk about the sale. I don't know. I don't know. We could

Matthias Miller  46:08
we could validate that you can tie the transit test to a quote

Unknown Speaker  46:13
and then they have to take to the stand.

Matthias Miller  46:16
We just have if you put in a quote then it says

Speaker 1  46:20
hold on a second. Go to let me try let me try this I got I have a thought put your quote give a quote there.

Unknown Speaker  46:32
Yeah, I'm

Speaker 1  46:33
curious what happens if I go to logistics transit TAS new transit test what do you got for Quote number two

Unknown Speaker  46:43
record number here

Unknown Speaker  46:48
site check queue

Speaker 2  46:55
so it populates so it's irrelevant so why don't we always search by Stan instead? No, I'm

Speaker 1  47:03
saying if if a transit task is created from a quote whether you put in the if you populate it with a quote number it's going to populate the stent anyway. So it's going to be always tied off to the stent so I would always push certain numbers in for your quote report

Unknown Speaker  47:17
right so I'm saying yeah, it's fine

Speaker 1  47:19
carry on just don't don't push a sales order number in for it only push a certain number in for it

Matthias Miller  47:28
I'm going to restart my changes because it just got crazy here.

Unknown Speaker  48:07
Building.

Unknown Speaker  48:58
And then what we do with them in the quotes

Unknown Speaker  49:17
she said ginger had one for a quote. No, it was for

Unknown Speaker  49:21
sale. There is no

Unknown Speaker  49:23
quotes okay.

Speaker 1  49:28
I mean, you could we could make one just for no it's not make one then it would show up online.

Matthias Miller  49:32
Alright, so So what I'm going to tell tell Marissa is

Speaker 2  49:40
we added a view in transit pass. You won't you don't.

Speaker 1  49:48
Can you can you take take your take your report, top right hand corner put a put a group in so it has a name.

Speaker 2  49:57
Yeah, but now that there's no records? No, I'm just saying

Speaker 1  50:06
oh, so it doesn't if there's no records it doesn't show anything. Oh, god

Unknown Speaker  50:14
yeah, let's do a preface

Unknown Speaker  50:21
data breaks between groups

Speaker 1  50:29
and that no records found kills everything is annoying as crap to me.

Unknown Speaker  50:39
Yeah.

Speaker 1  50:41
Because that's one of the things I wrote down here is that Jenny in Indiana qualified all her leads. So there was no new leads in her first pain, which means she couldn't see anything and all the pains

Unknown Speaker  50:59
do me a favor, putt, putt putt in Jenny?

Unknown Speaker  51:02
I'll show you how I solved it.

Speaker 1  51:06
Where's my Oh, man, she qualified that one too. Oh, no. Sorry. See, you're out. Yeah, always leave here. I made an always leave your lead so that she could see the rest of

Unknown Speaker  51:17
her leads?

Speaker 1  51:21
Is there is there a way? Is there a way we can make a get around that?

Speaker 2  51:29
I mean, that besides having a lead, like making going through all these reports, and making sure

Matthias Miller  51:36
that I don't know, maybe maybe this is a special magic lead that shows up for everybody.

Unknown Speaker  51:41
Is that possible? Absolutely. Which

Speaker 1  51:51
again, well, okay. Okay, where this gets a little bit finicky is the same thing with when you go into the dashboard, the opportunity dashboard. If there's no communication record, then there's no, you can't find or have a communication

Matthias Miller  52:07
record under here. And then we can always have this meaningless communication record.

Speaker 1  52:13
But the only the only issue is can you have to lock it so you can never qualify, it ends up getting qualified by so you,

Matthias Miller  52:19
you force forcibly included in the report subset, I think,

Unknown Speaker  52:24
gotcha. Can you do that?

Unknown Speaker  52:27
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  52:28
Can we add that as an agenda item for next year? Next time? Next year?

Unknown Speaker  52:37
Let's add it to agenda for next year.

Unknown Speaker  52:51
So it

Speaker 1  52:52
would it would be forced into the subset based on? Not so it would be irregardless of who it's assigned to. Yeah. That would be that would be a good thing to to have.

Matthias Miller  53:10
Put it on my list for next time. All right, so site checks we have and that would actually solve the auto create contact and opportunity instead of auto creating we would just always show that dummy communication in that

Unknown Speaker  53:26
in that report that they could find it not ideal but transit for

Speaker 1  53:34
Did you Did Oh, or do we get hung up on the creating contact and opportunity?

Matthias Miller  53:42
Oh, yeah, we got started on that and I had to drop off.

Unknown Speaker  53:47
I'm gonna drop off here soon.

Speaker 1  53:54
Well, before you drop, I have I have a strong suggestion. Josh is out of work. Can he go off and chase the the email and text message thing?

Unknown Speaker  54:10
What are you going to use for text message? I don't know. So isn't writing emails. So

Speaker 1  54:17
the the Import Export? Well, okay, we have a way that you can write an email. So it sends out. So if we could, if we it would be getting it back in again into the communication record, when the customer responds to it. So what I what I would like to do is I'd like to take like this whole, you know, that Floyd keeps crying about and about, you know, email and text message in the configurator text message is of lower priority to me than email, email as part of the configurator I'm sorry, the CRM. Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  54:57
I don't want to have you. I mean, I have no problem if you want to chat with him. about it. Like, if I'm involved, I'm gonna want more, you know me if I'm involved, and I'm gonna want more clarity about exactly what you're talking about. But yeah, I mean, the other thing too is we got the API documentation back for the RTO stuff. So

Unknown Speaker  55:15
I don't know where that's at. I know.

Speaker 1  55:22
Listen, this is what I really, really, really, really want to say, Are you committed to accounting? You are committed to 3d structure? Are you committed to marketing? Now you want to throw art to like, outside of?

Matthias Miller  55:36
Which one? Do you want to? Which one do you want to say no

Unknown Speaker  55:39
to? It's the basic question. Well, I mean,

Speaker 1  55:45
I'd say we stick to the things that we committed to and not go throw a red herring in there.

Matthias Miller  55:52
Is there anything Josh has committed for accounting work? Is there anything in accounting that he should be doing?

Speaker 1  55:57
Well, that's what that's the other question that I really, really wanted to bring up as well is like, what? What could can? Okay, real me this? Can Josh go off into the plant stuff?

Speaker 2  56:11
Yeah, maybe? I don't know if we, I mean, most of it. I mean, it's, I don't know if he wants to talk to him about it.

Speaker 1  56:20
I mean, the, I'll talk to him about that email thing. Because, okay, during the, during the last stakeholder meeting that we had, he made some comment when we when I brought up the whole email thing with sounded like he might want to eat, he kind of be interested in digging to it anyway. So if you want me to take it over to him, and send him down the road to chase it and figure out a way to make this thing really cool. If you're cool with that, I'll take it over to him.

Matthias Miller  56:46
I don't personally have a problem with it. I think the biggest question is, does it make sense to push him on put him onto accounting stuff instead?

Unknown Speaker  56:52
In light of priorities that have already been established? So if that's the

Speaker 1  56:56
if, if you want if you want to do either one, I just don't want to I don't want to sit there bored with and wondering what he's supposed to be doing.

Unknown Speaker  57:06
I mean, I can talk to him Monday. Okay. I really do have to drop Are you good with that

Speaker 1  57:17
they just renegotiated in our to deal with cricket Valley. So I'm hoping that this thing just kind of falls quiet. But I mean, at some point, you're gonna have to say you got the documentation back. And the big question is, you're gonna that's gonna end up in Josh's territory, depending on how they

Matthias Miller  57:30
want to do it anyway. It's Josh's stuff. It's not my stuff. So

Speaker 1  57:33
and, and really, somebody needs to go off and do a design on how they want the thing to work anyway. So

Matthias Miller  57:38
no, it's true. It's all that. So I guess,

Speaker 1  57:41
I guess that's what you need to push. Well leave the Josh part out when you push it back to game. But I mean, I think I think the next step is I got the API documentation. Now we need to do design on how you want this thing to work.

Unknown Speaker  57:52
Yeah. Yes, sir. Okay, I'm out.

Matthias Miller  57:58
So thanks.
