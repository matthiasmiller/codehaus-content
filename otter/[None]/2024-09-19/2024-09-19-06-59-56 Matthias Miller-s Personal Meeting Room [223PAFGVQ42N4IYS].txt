Unknown Speaker  02:07
One of my fast Hey, Seth,

Unknown Speaker  02:13
how's your life thinking?

Speaker 1  02:14
I was just wondering if they're remembering that it's a different time.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
Yeah, I don't know. Drew has the invite, I don't know. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  02:23
um, life in Kansas,

Unknown Speaker  02:27
pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
Dad's gone, so it's a little different.

Matthias Miller  02:30
He's very much. But yeah, while the cat's away, you guys doing any like, I don't know. Did you ever hear stories about, like, our go set up a canopy outside and go work outside. Days.

Unknown Speaker  02:48
No

Matthias Miller  02:50
Josh and I, particularly some of the others who join us. We go get this canopy and set up tape, set tables outside, take all our monitors and, like, have this massive setup. And then this is over in or, you know, one place I'm hearing Yeah, yeah. And then people would come hauling down the road and they see us, and then they slow way down and turn it look and then, like, try cash.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
That's hilarious. They're not used to seeing a whole text set up outside an Amish house

Speaker 2  03:22
Exactly, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  03:26
That's great. I'm

Matthias Miller  03:29
going to call drew here. Sure. Never mind. Here he comes. Okay? I

Unknown Speaker  03:52
Hey, John,

Unknown Speaker  03:56
bears on as well, cows. It's

Unknown Speaker  04:02
cows. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:06
you can't really tell from the same, whatever animals they are, that can starved half to death,

Unknown Speaker  04:14
pretty much.

Speaker 3  04:21
Well, thanks for adjusting to this or making this work. Is there on your schedule? So I'd say we just jump right in, and since we've got an hour, we'll

Unknown Speaker  04:33
try to keep moving. So

Speaker 3  04:42
let's go through the big projects, paper cut projects, then the completed projects, and then set see what email on lock and historical transactions. Um,

Speaker 1  04:57
the two big projects are done. I believe. Very okay, I'm seeing three now,

Speaker 3  05:04
correct? And, yeah, sorry. I was really, really slow. And going back to these last Sure, August numbers, completed and done. So hopefully I will be more responsive now. Sure, no

Speaker 1  05:19
problem. Um, yeah. So the Reporting link transactions that one's done coming through ability to switch from non po to PO, that one, I believe, is also done, yeah. And with this, I think, yeah, I think it's done. Um, number three, book value of assets. That one. This is also okay.

Speaker 3  05:50
This is, yeah, something new I just added this morning, then earlier this week. So let me just carry your

Unknown Speaker  06:02
screen

Matthias Miller  06:06
drew or tell me this isn't related to the owner's equity, health or distribution or for disbursement. That's affecting value.

Unknown Speaker  06:16
Okay, no, I don't think So. Something else. Um, I

Unknown Speaker  06:58
so I

Unknown Speaker  07:04
Oh, wrong one

Speaker 4  07:08
on this. It throws my sale of asset transaction into this. This cost here,

Matthias Miller  07:22
where is? Can we, can we just cut do a cut off date of on or before any transaction on or before it was put in service?

Unknown Speaker  07:37
There are a few in this. I Well,

Speaker 4  07:45
how are those dates are going to work together? Because there's a couple involved here that fall after the date of sale. So like, they continue to pay a few energy bills, or some, you know, for the next month. Um,

Speaker 4  08:03
uh, you know, so those will want to include it in that date of service. But we'd have to put the date of service after the date of sale. Then

Matthias Miller  08:14
let me and so you can't even, you can't even use the sale date. I wonder if we let's see what is this. This is a well shed time, 4.9

Speaker 3  08:31
it is but true. I'm wondering if, if Matthias might not be onto something with like when you make the sale, technically, when you sell an asset, technically, you've gotten the money for it, and any expenses incurred after that, this

Unknown Speaker  08:50
is be expensed. Well,

Unknown Speaker  08:56
I think they should, because if we're thinking about we'll have the situation

Speaker 3  09:08
continue. But like if, if we were trying to close, okay, this was back in had we been on schedule, this was in June, we would have had June financials, and then I think we should have just closed it as or that AND, OR, what do you think about that approach?

Speaker 4  09:25
Because those you're not with an asset, you're trying to, you know, disperse the value of that overly life as life is done over any more cost should just be expenses, because you don't have anything to disperse it over, anything.

Speaker 3  09:43
Yeah, I'm thinking that typically, the cost we're going to have after the sale, like, if we're still selling a piece of property like this, it's going to be some late closing costs or what have you in it, right? I don't know it? It on the one side, yeah, it should be in blue, that asset the other side, if we're going to close it at the time of sale. And

Matthias Miller  10:16
well, there's one other approach we could take, and I'm not sure we have the would be that somewhere have a field, let me pull up a simply in the Sales Transaction here. And the issue is that the sale close to a whole bunch of

Matthias Miller  10:59
I'm sorry I'm not finishing my thought. If we would have a field on the transaction that says I'm a sale of an asset transaction. So that's we have the special Transaction Types that's used for monthly, quarterly and annual closings, I don't know would be allowed to use, use it for that.

Unknown Speaker  11:33
Go ahead.

Speaker 3  11:41
So so that would you would have to define a sale as a this transaction is, is for the sale, and then the dates wouldn't be as

Matthias Miller  11:57
wouldn't be as important, okay, but in what scenario Do you want to sell an asset and incur asset value like then it's never going to get cleared out. You're going to have to do something with it all. And so you're,

Speaker 3  12:12
I see what? Yeah, if we sell them and we incur costs afterwards, then you have to basically throw them out again.

Unknown Speaker  12:20
Right? I think the

Speaker 3  12:24
first approach would be the cleanest, like when you sell an asset, make sure you have all your expenses in because anything after that, you're going to have to just post as a regular expense. I mean, okay, so this one closing was on 614, on this one. So that's the day that the sale date we used as well.

Speaker 4  12:49
That's the day we got the money says But, but it says the sale date.

Unknown Speaker  12:56
What? What date on the asset management then determines the cut out

Matthias Miller  13:03
the solar abandoned on sorry.

Unknown Speaker  13:07
I mean, that's what I would be thinking.

Speaker 3  13:08
So in this case, since we have them both dated on the same day, how would you handle that? What should we have?

Matthias Miller  13:19
What does it matter? I mean, day putting services are relevant. If you choose to only use an asset for day, that's that's your bad asset utilization problem, not an accounting problem. But

Speaker 3  13:37
how? Okay, but sale. So so you're planning to look at anything that was sold, any transactions on or after the day it was abandoned,

Unknown Speaker  14:01
like we're

Speaker 3  14:03
saying, the sold date after that, no more transactions can be you can't post any transactions for the date later than that, right, right, right. But, but how are you going to single out that that payment date on 60.

Matthias Miller  14:28
So there's two ways we could handle it. One is just, if you select an asset and your transaction date is after the sale date, create an error, like you can't have any transactions against this asset after the sale date. Or you could say that if an asset has been sold, make sure that the book value is.

Matthias Miller  15:00
The more we're talking, the more I like the idea of, let's just flag the sale transaction as a sale transaction and exclude it. And however you guys want to handle it, that's up to you. If somebody creates a something after the date, the sale date. I mean, we could. We can add separate validation if you want to where, if there is a sale transaction, I then,

Matthias Miller  15:25
then disallow creating subsequent transactions. I think this is cleanest.

Speaker 3  15:41
Okay, the payment flag and the payment makes sense. Now, what is your your validation? Where are, are you suggesting we do validation to to catch that

Matthias Miller  15:55
we don't have to have validation. I mean, if you guys are fine, just noticing when the asset values aren't zeroed out after you thought you sold it, that's fine, but we could add validation that you can't Why don't we just exclude the asset ID from the drop list and vendor invoices if it's been sold? And maybe we already do that.

Speaker 3  16:22
I think we already do after it's been put in service. So I think we're covered there. I don't think we have to do anything other than play the sale or Seth, you made several weeks ago. You made some changes to that droplet.

Speaker 1  16:38
Yeah, I think it um, turnover if we I think right now we're disallowing it if, or we're not showing it in the droplets, if it's after the solder banded date, because at that point, date put in service was required. I think that's a paper cut change to make that haven't quite gotten to yet, of making the dates put in services not required, and then we might, are we going to change the drop list to depend on that again? Well,

Speaker 3  17:06
we should, after it's been put in service. We should, we should use the date put in service to explode it from the drop list. Because,

Speaker 1  17:17
sure, I think, actually, I think what we're using, we're using the date put in service right now, but okay, just doing had initially been checking that it was empty. Now we're just checking that today is less than the day that was put in service. Go

Unknown Speaker  17:36
ahead, double check on

Unknown Speaker  17:40
that. I'm happy.

Unknown Speaker  17:48
So Seth, you're just checking the logic on, yeah, just

Unknown Speaker  17:51
double checking on that.

Speaker 3  18:04
Well, yeah, with with this, then you couldn't, you technically couldn't get any transaction,

Speaker 5  18:12
yeah, not from the vendor invoice. You could probably from a journal entry. But, yeah, yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 3  18:25
and is this? This is just visual, like, showing the the book value, cost is just a visual representation, really, right? Like it,

Speaker 4  18:36
yeah, I mean it like, if we go here to our assets. It includes it there as well, like so if we just look at the assets and what you know, what's attached to each asset, it gives you that wrong.

Speaker 3  18:49
But the sale is not pushing over into accounting.

Speaker 4  18:56
Yes, it is, or it's, but it's, it's in accounting correctly, because it's not in this account, it's in, you know, it's, it's showing up here because it's linked to this asset, not because it's in this account, like Because, actually it should say,

Unknown Speaker  19:19
it shouldn't have, well, I

Speaker 4  19:26
don't know what it should be saying there, but I would, I would be thinking it should be, it should have its value gone, because it's, it's no longer of any value to us.

Unknown Speaker  19:40
Have a depreciate.

Speaker 3  19:46
Are we? Are we going to use this for our for our tax preparer for depreciation? Then Matthias, do you know what was the intent of the. Like this manage assets, the value, like the values we're showing say on something that's depreciating already is okay, book value would be initial cost minus any depreciation, right, right. So after this change, we expect something like solar abandoned assets to stay in here, but like this one, we showed a 17 or $18,000 laws on sale of assets that it would show, show that loss. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  20:43
I just go away from this list, or it needs to be somewhere.

Matthias Miller  20:49
Yeah, I wonder if I don't know that. Okay. So in regards to taxation, I think the idea was, this is a master list, and if our tax accountant, if your tax accountant, needs to keep track of tax. Things are valued differently because of taxes for any reason, that's that's on them. We're not trying to this is we're only trying to do this from a county perspective. I think I mean, when we one thing we could do is the we could have the the, I don't know what you call these, but we could have the, well, we had the cost, we could Have the sale amount, and we could have the i What

Speaker 5  21:40
is

Matthias Miller  21:47
the value on the books? Like, if you sold, if you didn't, I don't know.

Speaker 4  21:57
Can we add a thing here, just to show like normally it would just show active assets, but then you could add, you know, to show all solar abandoned,

Matthias Miller  22:11
yeah, just include solar abandoned assets. Seems reasonable to me. The main question that I have is, how do you want to handle weird situations where an asset is sold, but trend the accounting, the net accounting impact, does not zero out, so it's still hanging out in an asset. Do you care about that?

Speaker 4  22:34
Yeah, because we're gonna have to expense it. So what's like with the with the sold or abandoned? See, it gave me a warning that my soul and abandoned transaction did not zero out accounting, which my thought was, well, it might be because of this, but I don't really have any other way of knowing, because you can't just look at at the asset account and say, well, it's at zero, because it's got all these other assets in here. So it's not going to be

Matthias Miller  23:17
there's not a linked. We can't look at the linked. Well, this isn't a good way. Okay, here's the question, do we want to spend the remaining, our remaining precious time now, or do we want to put it on the list of figure out a way to make sure that assets get zeroed out? Yeah.

Speaker 3  23:35
So, so for now, if we just flag the sale of asset, flag that sale. So the book browser, right? That's all we need for right now. Okay, and

Matthias Miller  23:47
then paper cut project for the include solar abandon. If you guys want

Speaker 3  23:57
good set that you did, you verify that we're looking at dates, perfect.

Speaker 3  24:11
Okay, good. So on the paper cut projects, number one is a new one company name and header of node holder statements. I'm sure that's easy to but on those not exactly sure what we call them. Is it note holders, the infants, or is it or we where you we calculate the the interest. What do we call them?

Matthias Miller  24:33
Interest on notes? Yeah, just pull it up and show the

Matthias Miller  24:52
so you want the company name on? Where do you want? The

Speaker 3  24:59
idea? Late company name like the top left or, yeah, up here on the report. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  25:06
So could we just do, like, affordable foreign company dash interest on and then ABC, etc, etc, yeah.

Speaker 3  25:19
That makes sense. And the note holder standpoint is we wouldn't even need to have, yeah, yeah, that's good. Well,

Matthias Miller  25:27
I mean, we could exclude the we wouldn't exclude. We could do the we could just put the accounting company name up there, affordable barn company, instead of interest on and then you just show Larry Troyer 10% and the breakdown how

Unknown Speaker  25:43
that would actually be probably better, oh, because they don't care what we call their account number.

Speaker 3  25:50
Yeah, it would probably be less confusing. Just you're saying, replace the header that's there with just the accounting company. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:02
Um, makes sense to

Speaker 1  26:04
so. But are you wanting to keep the Leroy Troyer 10% up there

Matthias Miller  26:09
or not? Yeah, just replace the title with the accounting company. Perfect. That's fast. That's fast. That was easy.

Speaker 4  26:17
The Leroy drawer is, is on down below. Yeah,

Speaker 6  26:20
I see,

Speaker 3  26:28
I think everything else and stuff we had before, you might have given us updates on these set. I'm not sure

Speaker 1  26:36
numbers the ones that are now, numbers two through four are done

Speaker 3  26:42
with. Those as well. Or is it waiting they?

Speaker 1  26:47
Those are waiting for an update, all of them. I was just trying to see if any of them are user stuff, but now all those are waiting on update. Oh.

Speaker 3  27:06
Uh. So is there anything we need to talk about on five on the remaining ones? I

Speaker 1  27:11
don't think so. It's just, I just need to get them in as I have time.

Speaker 3  27:18
Good. So if we go back to completed projects through. I'm still going through some of these behavioral stuff. So if you want to, you had an issue on duplication warnings not or flagging incorrectly. Yeah, do you want to cover this, this other project first? Um,

Unknown Speaker  27:35
go ahead. If you want to

Unknown Speaker  27:38
okay the uncategorized expense report.

Unknown Speaker  27:40
I'll

Unknown Speaker  27:42
just share my screen again,

Unknown Speaker  27:51
so

Speaker 4  27:56
it is giving us a bunch of them listed as from the accounts payable account, which is correct, but it doesn't help us in sorting out what these are. Bummer, we're so cleaned up that there's nothing here. Anyway. So it lists. It lists the payment account. They're supposed to all be listed by the payment account. But recently, and it might be just because of some change we made, it's listing. There's a few under checking, but usually the credit cards are all under Accounts Payable. It just says,

Unknown Speaker  28:45
um, well,

Matthias Miller  28:57
this is so we don't break reconciles when? But people want to know whether it's the credit card or not.

Speaker 4  29:11
Yeah, it's it's helpful if we know, like, which credit card account, you know, was this Capital One? Was this low? Was this a debit card from a checking account, you know,

Matthias Miller  29:24
Steph, do you know if this one is a, is this is a zfp specific report?

Unknown Speaker  29:31
I don't offhand, but I can look. You

Unknown Speaker  29:33
want to look, yeah,

Matthias Miller  29:37
little janky, but we could look up the linked vendor invoice. We could do, first of all, do a local macro for the accounting company to find the AP account. And if it's an AP account, good DSP one you. So if it's the AP account, then do a look up and find the vendor invoice, check account, account and pull it out of there.

Unknown Speaker  30:11
Group it by that.

Speaker 1  30:15
Does that make sense? So that being the grouping, right?

Matthias Miller  30:19
Yeah, in the grouping. Let me jot notes, fix and categorize, expand support. So this would be create local macro. Let's see, do you want to open the prompts through so I can see them. Click the title, Yeah, accounting, company field the

Matthias Miller  31:36
Okay, hopefully you can parse my wild hand wavy pseudo code. But

Speaker 2  31:44
if not, you can ping me and I can clarify. It should be clear. Good. I

Unknown Speaker  32:03
so on the

Unknown Speaker  32:05
are you done with this group? Yeah, go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  32:07
So on payroll,

Speaker 3  32:10
I send you two two pages or reports from payroll, and I think this is just something that

Unknown Speaker  32:21
we're not properly

Speaker 3  32:22
inactivating these employees. So if you look at not sure which heat I sent first, but the one has all those employees circle at the bottom that since they do not have time cards, all of those are employees that are no longer with the company, so they need to be inactivated. What? What do we need to do to make so that they don't show up here every week? And yeah,

Speaker 1  32:59
I'm looking I thought my changes would have done that,

Speaker 3  33:04
and I expect they did. And just I expect what it is, we didn't inactivate. Nobody ever want you to.

Speaker 1  33:28
I'm just looking at the code of it here, trying to see like it's possible my changes actually didn't do it for this one scenario or something, depending employee, I

Speaker 1  34:04
Okay, I found it. It's actually we thought it was just very simple. There's one or two other changes I need to make yet for some of the logic. So Matthias basically the NDX was the index was still relying completely on the stored end date, not just the so

Matthias Miller  34:31
just change the index to the final row to use the contact enacted. Yeah, I like it.

Speaker 3  34:38
Okay. What about on the other page, there's the exception there that says, kill a Allen. Do not have our specified that that was more recent. So I'm curious if maybe she would never inactivated her. I'm not. I. Right?

Speaker 1  35:05
I mean, that one looks like saying she doesn't have hours, then that probably means she has a time card for that week. No hours. Who is it? Hey, Alan.

Matthias Miller  35:21
I mean, she's an active contact. So, okay,

Unknown Speaker  35:23
so she's never been inactivated, so that's why she showed up. That's why

Speaker 3  35:37
got it. I think that covers what I had there. So that change is that just a paper cut change that is going to happen

Speaker 1  35:46
that's easy to make, Yeah, that one's easy to make, the fixing the time card, one, right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  35:56
Okay, I'd say that's probably number just put that at number two on the list, sure. So, invoice duplication warning, I think you had something there.

Speaker 4  36:12
Yeah. Instead of just sent an email to the supported insight, or inside support, or whatever it's called, I got some that there was no other invoice of that name number, so it should not flag them as as duplicates, if The if the number in invoice number doesn't match, but I also didn't find anything else you know that indicated it would be a match, either.

Speaker 3  36:50
But some what you're saying is what should happen if you have two identical, two invoices that are identical, except the invoice number is say one is the one is 1122, and the other one, because of a typo, it's entered as 1112, you're saying those should, um,

Speaker 4  37:08
should not. Those should not come in as a match. Because, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  37:18
I don't know.

Speaker 4  37:22
Like, the reason I would say that should not come in as match is because you can have two basically identical invoices, two different purchases. There's actually supposed to be two. One is the first invoice number, the other one is second, but it was two purchases of, you know, both were two gallons of paint or whatever, if we want to try to catch typos and invoice numbers. I mean, if we would do, if we would say, okay, it matches all the other criteria but the invoice number is different.

Speaker 4  38:09
You know, still look, still call it a possible duplicate. I guess we could do that. At that point, we'd be trying to catch typos more than catch duplications. Um, but

Speaker 3  38:22
am I understanding correctly that if you go to just if you don't do that, you're basically saying the only time you you flag for a duplication is if you have a matching invoice number. Or would it not

Speaker 4  38:37
well, if you have a matching invoice number or wait, they're making up invoice numbers for other stuff that doesn't have that's not actually an invoice, like credit card receipts. They just make up numbers. So

Unknown Speaker  39:01
I guess.

Speaker 4  39:04
So I guess what it should be then is if the other criteria matches, you know, date total and what else was it? Dave total and vendor, yeah, Dave total and vendor, if those match, call it a possible duplicate. If those don't match, but the vendor invoice number matches, all of that a possible duplicate as well. So

Unknown Speaker  39:43
we

Unknown Speaker  39:47
do two things.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Number one, just troubleshoot exactly what record why these are showing up as duplicates, specifically because you. I mean, we don't include the system like record number in here, and so it's not clear why it's showing up. Number two, before we make duplication logic changes, can we spell out very precisely the current logic that is being used and precisely spell out the logic that we want it to be used? So we're not I be used so we're not accidentally crossing wires. And, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:31
I think that'd be good.

Unknown Speaker  40:32
Um, do you with the with the

Speaker 4  40:40
how do I find out why it's calling it a duplicate? I mean, I went hunting, I couldn't find anything that actually duplicated. So this, I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  40:56
Are these tied to checks? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  41:00
yeah, it is,

Matthias Miller  41:01
yeah. I'm gonna guess it's something with her check logic.

Speaker 3  41:16
So your proposal would be your Seth, spell out exactly what it how the current duplication logic is working. And then, yes, then using that as as odd things like that come up. Drew just sends those to you, and then we review them, like the next meeting or whatever. Just like, Okay, why did this show up? Is,

Matthias Miller  41:49
yeah, I mean, we can, we can. Then if you look at that logic and you're like, wow, we really don't like that. Well, that's fine. I don't mind that. I don't mind making informed changes. I just know we we went through about three iterations of what we think duplicate invoice invoice detection should look like. And I think being crystal clear about the nuances of if this, then that, if not this, then that I would be far more comfortable that we'll be able to make it in a make a good decision in a single change.

Speaker 3  42:25
Yeah, it feels a lot like the logic we were trying to nail down for, like, sales, order, invoice, like we made change after changed, good. So clarity on current logic from

Unknown Speaker  42:44
Seth and Matthias, and then logging or on future

Speaker 3  42:59
like unexpected warnings but we'll review unexpected warnings, and then, based off of That, spell out what we want to change good i

Speaker 3  43:25
i appreciate you jumping in Messiah on these things where you've been through These rodeo before. So

Unknown Speaker  43:34
cut to the stations.

Speaker 3  43:42
Anything else before we look at blocking historical transactions. Said that said.

Speaker 3  43:56
So first of all set this has been, we talked about this so long ago that

Unknown Speaker  44:01
we're we're a little

Speaker 3  44:05
unclear on what we had actually discussed to talk so, so bear with us,

Unknown Speaker  44:09
sure. So

Speaker 3  44:13
everything okay you're saying. If so, what priority is it? So one of the things that right now it's it's not, it doesn't feel super urgent, just because of all the 2025 for sure, I think we should have it in place by 25 for right now we have, we're still in enough of a cleanup phase like, Oh, what about this? What about that that had, if we had this, it would probably create more, be more troubles have been helpful, but we do need it in the future, so I think we should still go through. And,

Unknown Speaker  45:05
yeah,

Speaker 3  45:07
so what if we go down to the logic? I think the first questions that we had were where you were saying, Make sure both transaction dates are after the latest date, latest of clarify what we had called an accounting close date and a transaction block date.

Speaker 1  45:34
I was not involved in these discussions, so I just copy pasted from the spec. I don't know if Matthias, well,

Speaker 3  45:48
Matthias, is it? Then I'm almost wondering if we're better off to wait to do anything with this until later in the year, just because you were correct the other day when you said, you know, waiting to develop things as close to when we actually use them seems to work best for us. I'm a little concerned that we we try to figure out what we we go through this now and then, the end of the year, we're gonna say, ah, you know, this is we want to make some changes. So unless it's unless this causes problems for you, I would say, let's just

Speaker 1  46:33
no okay. All I need to know is priority. So I'll just drop it down and let it float for a while. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  46:41
that was easy, yep, no, it was easy.

Unknown Speaker  46:47
Good. Well,

Unknown Speaker  46:48
do we have anything else? Do you have anything off? Drew

Unknown Speaker  46:50
No,

Matthias Miller  46:52
that's it. Well, I I have if you guys want to wait, like, I don't know if you guys want to, if you guys want to drop off. That's fine. I found the duplicate vendor invoice that the other one was talking about, and I'm trying to take a look at the second link that you sent. And so if you want to wait a minute, we might be able to get some clarity on what exactly is going on with the second one, and we could take a look at that. So this one would be

Speaker 1  47:37
drew I was looking at the jobs I'd written up, and from late August, I was seeing one to disable reconcile warning when changing dates, and Matthias had said it's pending confirmation from you. And I think we just lost that in the shuffle. Do you want? So what we're thinking is blanking out. When we're doing validation about a account of impact affecting reconciled transactions, we blank out the date so that if you change a date, it doesn't drop at you. So

Speaker 4  48:20
the transactions reconciled. You go in, you change the date, and it just doesn't worry about that date change at all.

Speaker 1  48:28
Yeah, and I think it would also, if that's when that also affect, like, if you change, I don't know, vendor invoice or something, a date on a reconciled transaction,

Matthias Miller  48:39
right? Because we don't, we maintain reconciliations. It might mean you might reconcile the march statements and one of the reconciled transactions jumps out to may or something, right? It'd be weird, but reconciliation wouldn't break

Speaker 4  48:54
right? Yeah, I think that's correct for what we want to do. Okay,

Speaker 1  48:57
where is this another paper cut project, or where do you want to

Unknown Speaker  49:06
so one of the

Speaker 4  49:14
I was thinking one of the paper cut projects had something to do with that?

Unknown Speaker  49:19
Oh, maybe with breaking top.

Speaker 4  49:24
Oh, sorry, no, it's already done. In the next update, the one about the non po and po breaking, yes, that one's done. That's already done. So, yeah, we'll just put it in the just put it at the, I guess the bottom of the list for

Unknown Speaker  49:39
projects. I

Matthias Miller  49:43
so I just sent an email, if you guys don't have anything on that, I just sent an email in the duplicate vendor invoices that you were talking about. I'm not sure why they're not showing up in the vendor invoice report. I. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  50:03
which we could, I guess we could find out. So there's the unprinted check one, yeah, one of these is,

Matthias Miller  50:19
let me find out why one of these? One of these things is, oh, one has a blank status. And so if you select all the items in the vendor invoice report, you don't see it. I'll bet you, if you don't select any, then you will, but I'm not sure that's great.

Unknown Speaker  50:38
Um, it, yeah.

Speaker 4  51:00
Well, as well. It's good to look at why they're coming up as Yeah.

Matthias Miller  51:08
I mean, why is status optional?

Unknown Speaker  51:12
I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  51:17
Let's do this too while we're at it, report under invoice.

Speaker 1  51:22
See how many we have this link status, yeah, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
So,

Unknown Speaker  51:41
let me share this

Unknown Speaker  51:43
just by into selecting one.

Unknown Speaker  51:49
I mean, these are all

Speaker 5  51:52
so status determines what shows up like verification. I I

Matthias Miller  52:05
mean, I don't really care about the 2023 ones. Maybe we should, hopefully, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:12
you know, whatever. It's

Speaker 3  52:15
kind of a side note, but we had a vendor credit us. 18 months later they credited us. What was it? 25,000 from way back in 23 when we didn't have as good record keeping on what we paid, not paid. So

Matthias Miller  52:36
thank goodness for honest vendors. Um,

Speaker 4  52:48
they're also the same ones that let us know quite promptly if we miss a $250 charge on a $15,000 invoice.

Matthias Miller  53:02
That's hilarious. That is hilarious. Somebody loves accuracy over there. That's great. I mean, is there a reason would Josh? I don't know if we should check with Josh. There's no vendor invoices that get auto created. Are there?

Speaker 4  53:27
Um, well, there's the Quick, quick vendor, but those automatically enter as as prepaid, unverified, so we give those in automatic status.

Unknown Speaker  53:43
Let's just do this reconcile,

Speaker 4  53:45
but, but there's also the audit, yeah, but those you put in, what do you want the status, like the

Speaker 3  53:51
utility companies or what? Yeah, because,

Unknown Speaker  53:55
because some are prepaid, some are not. I

Speaker 3  54:08
Are you suggesting Matthias that you couldn't even save a vendor invoice if you didn't have status? Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  54:18
mean, you shouldn't be entering it if you don't know if it's

Speaker 3  54:24
so what happened with like, these few that were these hanging out, like, are they? Do they have an accounting impact?

Unknown Speaker  54:34
Probably not. I don't know that it really matters. I'm just I

Matthias Miller  54:43
I don't know. Okay, so I'm gonna guess then a bit. So this one, this one's affecting raw materials as as an AP record as x is. Oh, you did okay, good for you. So let's, let's at least do this.

Matthias Miller  55:20
Let's, let's do a I mean, these last these last four in particular would be good to clean up. I mean, if you guys, I'd be a fan of making status be required, unless you guys have an objection,

Unknown Speaker  55:42
I think that would be good.

Matthias Miller  55:48
Okay, I will. I'd like to get signed off from Josh, because he's been involved with this. But,

Unknown Speaker  55:59
good,

Speaker 3  56:01
oh, next week we scheduled to talk about, I guess, sorry. Were we done with this? Or did you have did you want to look at Logic more

Matthias Miller  56:09
Well, as I was sticking my head in there, anyway,

Matthias Miller  56:20
we only match vendor invoices based on the vendor invoice ID, and then we look at and if we don't have a match, then we look at vendor invoices using standard criteria. We always look at manually created transactions and checks that aren't connected to a vendor invoice using the standard criteria, which is like the date range and, you know, plus or minus two days vendor and date and amount so

Matthias Miller  57:04
I can see if I can take a few minutes just to check it out. But I think our logic is right, is actually what you want, but I'm not

Unknown Speaker  57:12
sure, so go ahead. Mark. Oh,

Speaker 3  57:15
I was just so for next week, we've scheduled to talk about, get started with kickoff the sales tax reporting. I was wondering if we should schedule a longer meeting, or maybe do something like a 90 minute, a typical 90 minute, 930 to 11, and then the afternoon, another 60 minutes or so, if that was or, yeah,

Matthias Miller  57:46
I'd be, I'd be fine with that. So sorry, you're, you're proposing to start with 90 minutes 930 to 11, and then

Unknown Speaker  57:59
we're sorry. Can you repeat? Yeah,

Speaker 3  58:01
I would, we'd probably cover our normal stuff. First try to get through that pretty quickly. And then 930 Yeah, the remaining time, use that for design on sales tax reporting, and then you schedule another meeting to in the afternoon if we need more, which I think we probably will. I can one o'clock. Yeah, do like a wanditude, sure,

Matthias Miller  58:30
and bring Seth in on this too, right? Yeah,

Speaker 3  58:35
and we'll try to prepare for that, hopefully some work on that, some today, and try to get you our thoughts ahead of time so we can Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  58:52
sounds like Plan. Good, good. Here.

Unknown Speaker  58:58
I wasn't productive. That's right.

Speaker 2  59:02
Yeah, what's the what's the law that says that activities expand to the time allotted for anyway,

Unknown Speaker  59:10
that's what it is. Cool. Well,

Matthias Miller  59:14
happy Thursday to you guys. Yeah.
