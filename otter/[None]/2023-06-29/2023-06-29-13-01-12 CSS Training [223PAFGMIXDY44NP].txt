Unknown Speaker  00:50
Hey Ben grab water Okay

Unknown Speaker  02:15
Good afternoon

Unknown Speaker  02:31
guys how are things in less Wild West

Matthias Miller  02:37
less wild west you know cool in the morning hot in the afternoon my poor wife is at the stage of like I want to get out of the house and do stuff but I can't really plan anything like anyway in the waiting game

Unknown Speaker  03:02
so it's pretty yeah

Matthias Miller  03:10
and then wrangling client expectations which here's fun fact here's a little trivia for you guys did you know that inexperienced leaders rate their their conflict a built conflict conflict management abilities higher than experienced leaders Hmm Interesting

Unknown Speaker  03:35
that is interesting

Speaker 1  03:43
kind of uh the more you know, the more you realize you don't know. type of situation. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:48
I think so. I think so.

Unknown Speaker  03:57
Or you start out optimistic and then you get a few decades down the road and just getting disillusioned and pessimistic. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:07
exactly. Exactly. man

Speaker 1  04:28
All right. Well, I guess this is the first CSS call. Lethal first one we've all three bit on little while.

Unknown Speaker  04:44
With is going to turn on screensharing

Unknown Speaker  05:01
All right, so we're gonna start out with some simple ways

Speaker 1  05:12
to do items, so I'm tracking on 7721

Unknown Speaker  05:27
And

Unknown Speaker  05:29
just last screenshare just killed

Unknown Speaker  05:31
the screen sharing

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Wait, no,

Unknown Speaker  05:35
I I close something out here

Speaker 1  05:50
all right. So we got a few questions for you today Matthias first off on membership details

Speaker 1  06:10
All right, so on the for the expertise and background process to link contacts and user profiles. So we're we're creating a new user profile, or linking a user profile, activating user profile, all those things. There was we had this jumping around here, we had this spec down in the, in the dev specs, I wanted to confirm whether this is what you were planning on for the x 30. It's called here's quite a user profile helper report. But is this is this what you're thinking about the x 30? Like does that look like the spec for

Matthias Miller  07:02
ya? To help help a report fed into the x 30? Yeah, that's what it looks like.

Speaker 1  07:07
Okay. Okay. And then the next question here was in the automatic process and yesterday, we should be creating the temporary password and setting the Change Password next logon checkbox right that's probably the automatic process so that they don't have to go in there and do it manually.

Matthias Miller  07:37
Do we have a forgot password can we just have people do it forgot password

Unknown Speaker  07:45
Hmm, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  07:48
Um

Unknown Speaker  07:51
Where did I see that

Matthias Miller  08:01
don't have a password on all options? I think there was there was one system I was trying to get into at one point, and I couldn't remember my password for it. And I think I had to reach out that you figured out the reset. Let me take a look and see if I can find the

Unknown Speaker  08:33
clients to reset their own passwords

Matthias Miller  08:40
isn't able

Unknown Speaker  08:41
if the

Matthias Miller  08:50
here

Unknown Speaker  08:53
where's a good place to put this

Unknown Speaker  09:00
go to documentation.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
zc H wiki

Matthias Miller  09:13
where should this go? As far as the Forgot Password documentation in the wiki?

Speaker 1  09:19
There would be a here there should be one about setting up username setting up username password login or something like that.

Matthias Miller  09:33
Sure. Search for password using username password login for app hosting. Oh hey look.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
password resets.

Matthias Miller  09:57
Would you look at that

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Okay

Speaker 1  10:15
But does that work if there is no password?

Matthias Miller  10:19
No exist? I mean, we could just set it to probably if we enable quick login and then just Yeah, then they would just reset it should work I mean, if not then we set their initial password to some wild random password that nobody I mean, who cares

Unknown Speaker  10:42
what it is

Unknown Speaker  10:46
and then everybody gets it.

Matthias Miller  10:48
You just randomize your password? No, you randomize it every time.

Unknown Speaker  10:52
Okay.

Matthias Miller  10:55
But I don't think that's necessary. I think it's I mean, you don't have to have a password if you've got quick login enabled. And so I would just name a quick login which means they've got no password set which means they have to reset the password in order to get in

Speaker 1  11:12
Okay, so even even though they're not using quick login you would be enabled and then they would just reset the password Yeah. Interesting. Okay. So

Unknown Speaker  11:35
complicated

Unknown Speaker  12:40
okay

Unknown Speaker  12:46
okay well I'll make a note here

Unknown Speaker  12:55
and we'll plan to follow up from there

Speaker 1  13:04
and should we will probably maybe we should test it out to make sure that it

Unknown Speaker  13:12
that it works

Matthias Miller  13:15
I mean, it wouldn't hurt but if it doesn't hurt I mean if it doesn't mean the message was clients we rely on this and so it is a supported platform feature

Speaker 1  13:25
but as far as that it works if there's no if there's no password that exists already and password is blank. Do any of that works or

Matthias Miller  13:36
I would be shocked if it didn't but we check something here system switch us what was the switch name again?

Unknown Speaker  13:47
That open allow user password reset

Speaker 2  13:52
we go this CH systems which is password and the actual name description see include everybody let's go down to the disease

Matthias Miller  14:21
the CGA have username password login enabled

Speaker 1  14:24
ZTA Yeah, I don't

Unknown Speaker  14:27
know. Hidden nevermind let me check one other thing.

Speaker 1  14:36
I don't think any of the test systems are using username password.

Unknown Speaker  14:42
Echo is

Matthias Miller  14:45
okay. Why would we go turn the system switch see

Matthias Miller  15:05
Allow reset yes

Unknown Speaker  15:13
oh we serve SMTP

Matthias Miller  15:14
from that we have a Do we have test credentials for

Unknown Speaker  15:22
SMTP

Unknown Speaker  15:29
we have we have a link to two g mails settings

Matthias Miller  15:38
got it here to the billing Mailgun that's the SMTP Mailgun server that user name yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and encrypt it to read it and then this guy

Unknown Speaker  16:04
password okay

Matthias Miller  16:08
and then the from

Matthias Miller  16:17
step that and then we got our reset we're gonna enable that

Unknown Speaker  16:24
then we're gonna do test echo log out log back in as the online test echo in Yes Why don't we do something like now we can't

Unknown Speaker  16:57
hear I can

Matthias Miller  17:02
so I didn't test it

Unknown Speaker  17:10
this might actually work out fairly well because I actually don't remember my password

Speaker 1  17:20
Okay, here let me just make sure

Matthias Miller  17:26
you'd have to I have to write a I think I have to write it does he have quick logging enabled? No, I can enable it here there right yeah, enable it here and then I need to go delete his saved passwords if you want to test that specifically. So this is your Can I just do that here? No, because we maintain password history. Username user profile equals CCI ban. And then buttons is a modified button

Unknown Speaker  18:12
selected records user stored for user

Matthias Miller  18:25
slash login and password equals delete entire RG user hashed batch don't know if this is gonna be good or not. We're gonna give it a try. Ah, okay if you refresh this one this one Yeah. His password is blank. Okay. I didn't test the email sending for sure but it's a good word.

Unknown Speaker  19:35
Take a little bit

Unknown Speaker  19:46
isn't there a

Matthias Miller  20:04
Let's see I know God has nailed that episode in bed soon let me go into

Unknown Speaker  20:15
Mailgun and see if it said

Matthias Miller  20:25
seeing Mailgun designer that posting

Unknown Speaker  20:40
Activity

Unknown Speaker  22:05
Joel's gonna have to hunt it down if we use this SMTP

Unknown Speaker  22:21
what other Mailgun accounts do we have it's let me just

Matthias Miller  22:35
detected unusual activity let's fix the unusual activity

Unknown Speaker  23:13
ah you got it yep I took a minute yeah

Unknown Speaker  23:41
password reset was successful and I was able to log in cool

Unknown Speaker  23:47
sweet

Matthias Miller  23:52
and you can actually send them a link then to go directly to that recovery page something like

Speaker 1  24:30
so then it would be in this case we'll just do whatever suddenly yes

Matthias Miller  24:40
that could be in the welcome email and basically saying, hey, go here. Put in your password would be ideal. I should see if they actually supported this. I doubt that they did. A big one too.

Matthias Miller  25:04
Our clients ever wow this is a pretty involved change

Unknown Speaker  25:21
scared to

Speaker 2  25:37
death password reset key

Matthias Miller  25:44
no you can't default email address only be cool if you could

Unknown Speaker  25:49
default which email address Oh like on that on the login on the reset page

Unknown Speaker  25:56
yeah

Unknown Speaker  26:03
anyway that's fine add scroll Brandon's

Matthias Miller  26:07
keep going

Unknown Speaker  26:11
alright, so that cool. That's really cool. All right. So then

Speaker 1  26:30
next week there was yet a few more All right, oh, my quick entry report the knowledge tree entry. Quick entry report. We had had a column for review ID for them to select the review for the for the knowledge free entry, but donathan caught that we're not there, we're doing it the other way around, even RG on the review where we list the corresponding entries.

Unknown Speaker  27:06
So right that we would just take away this column and have a linking. Maybe have a linking just happen automatically based on the member and resource?

Speaker 1  27:25
Or should we have to show which review this because you're only gonna be having one review per member per resource. So that Linky could happen automatically, fairly easily. But it'd be nice to have, you know, once you've entered your 10 or five or 10 key points and be nice about it, go straight to your review, or go back to the review. Well,

Matthias Miller  27:53
I mean, we had said theoretically, you can have multiple reviews per book, I would prefer much prefer I think it's overkill. Sorry, one of my friends posted about the phenomenon of digital hoarding, which I think I may have brought up a time or two I don't know but

Unknown Speaker  28:10
it's a thing

Matthias Miller  28:13
do you really have to know which review that this particular insight came from if they do multiple reviews, so I would prefer if we can do it member plus resource just the fact that it's tied to this resource. I think that would be smashingly awesome.

Speaker 1  28:35
I think I think we are only doing one we are one review per three. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  28:44
So that changed

Speaker 1  28:48
okay. Yeah. It was it was your preference and then I think it was I think there was something that made it easier to do that way anyway, so yeah, we're fine with that.

Unknown Speaker  29:03
Good.

Matthias Miller  29:06
The other cool thing to do is is you can you can put in your takeaways before you create your review right so then go ahead

Speaker 1  29:20
so then once this is the review record here and the knowledge tree entries given our G here so then these would just basically just automatically show up on this RG based on member and and resource

Speaker 1  29:42
yeah yep. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Okay

Speaker 1  30:24
sounds good. And then a question on the on the new records spreadsheet what happens when they click Save? Does it clear the report have all the new saved records or to the saved items remain?

Matthias Miller  30:46
You can have well I'm gonna assume that these are this is for a specific resource do not history entries. Do these have to be tied to a resource?

Speaker 1  30:57
They don't have to be the resource yeah resource is optional

Matthias Miller  31:08
Do we wait let's say you do it for resource presumably when you go in there you might want to see all the all the takeaways all the knowledge tree entries from previous that you've had previously plus some new ones right. But what happens when you don't specify a resource and you want to input new ones do you want to see any of the old ones or do you just want to put in new ones

Speaker 1  31:35
good question. I think the plan was just to do new ones but it could be handled as the old ones

Matthias Miller  31:45
I mean we can we can put existing records in there do you have a proposal that you're proposing that works

Speaker 1  31:59
No, I was just wondering like what are what is I was just wondering what how it works oh no with these but am I hearing that it could go either way

Unknown Speaker  32:13
I don't remember how it works.

Matthias Miller  32:16
I would I would think when you save

Matthias Miller  32:31
Do we have any new record spreadsheet examples

Unknown Speaker  32:35
surely we do somewhere

Speaker 1  32:44
not that I know are you had Thank you has shown us one you might have finished one from client scope or something from industry tools

Matthias Miller  33:13
okay bottom line is

Unknown Speaker  33:14
we need

Matthias Miller  33:18
the ideal thing would be for there to be a demo report that you can play around with the new record spreadsheet

Matthias Miller  33:33
Let me see. So we have we're searching for a new record start at our 20 sore let's see see source of components standard external

Unknown Speaker  34:22
oh well

Matthias Miller  34:35
mean you could just straight up try to or we don't have a you don't have a sample sim because you haven't tested this system.

Unknown Speaker  34:41
Not yet.

Matthias Miller  34:48
Let me do

Unknown Speaker  34:51
Steve here

Matthias Miller  34:56
give you a link to pull up. You can play around with this one.

Unknown Speaker  35:00
Okay

Unknown Speaker  35:01
we print designer let's do a new new app designer here you level

Unknown Speaker  35:23
to Do section one field ID

Matthias Miller  35:46
okay pull that one up

Matthias Miller  35:56
so put in some labels somewhere

Unknown Speaker  36:08
and then save whenever you want

Unknown Speaker  36:16
finish making text or something or string or whatever doesn't matter it really doesn't matter

Matthias Miller  36:35
finish redirects well there you go the Finish button can take you back to it there's that one post save report but if it doesn't

Matthias Miller  37:06
close the record report on Save okay enter initial inventory for entering amounts okay let me try test

Matthias Miller  37:45
as there's as of a specific date

Matthias Miller  37:55
I'm gonna guess what's going to happen is that you can either redirect somewhere else which is something I didn't know you can do which is what you want to do in this case once he had finished Don't you want to go back to the review

Unknown Speaker  38:08
yeah

Matthias Miller  38:10
so let's just do that if you don't do that I'm 90% sure we're finished we'll save the records and reload the report and so then it's up to you to make sure that those

Speaker 1  38:51
we will also be accessing this from Metro main menu would we take them back to the main menu or take them to

Matthias Miller  39:18
know I mean it's always gonna we always wanted to do the same thing

Unknown Speaker  39:25
in some cases there won't be a review yet.

Speaker 1  39:47
There won't be a review at all that kind of silly required to to have a review for the watch my call it the entry

Unknown Speaker  40:02
yeah

Unknown Speaker  40:10
but we can look at that a little bit more

Matthias Miller  40:32
mean there's other ways to me just stay in the report but that doesn't seem that useful it has some kind of hairy design issues I guess one way you could do it if you really had to is kind of have like a have an ask prompt that generates a default generates a unique session ID or something and all of those entries created from that screen would all have that Id stamped on them and you would pull those into the report and keep them there but or you would just stay in the report and refresh refresh the report and you get blank entries again I don't know Anyway, I

Speaker 1  41:18
think we were going to do from the review we were going to open it in a new tab open the spreadsheet in a new tab

Matthias Miller  41:30
I think it's possible well so

Speaker 1  41:37
they're just wondering if like if we're gonna open a new tab anyway we could just have the redirect always go to the like my my entries report you see them all and then if they done it from a review they can just close out that tab and go back to their review yep

Matthias Miller  42:00
Let me try something here

Unknown Speaker  42:02
we have the this guy let's do C BB.

Unknown Speaker  42:49
Browse All standard actually we got to do the app

Unknown Speaker  43:14
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  43:19
is it something that really needs to be documented in the documentation that we can do this with the record spreadsheets I suppose say we can redirect to a

Unknown Speaker  43:32
different report or

Matthias Miller  43:40
let me test this year new database level and physic local system so I can play around with the report test

Unknown Speaker  43:57
History test designer

Unknown Speaker  44:17
general

Unknown Speaker  44:25
field

Matthias Miller  44:33
de add a new field spreadsheet tab. Alright let's see if we can modify these settings so we have the advanced

Unknown Speaker  44:52
that's a close on save. Set

Matthias Miller  45:13
unsafe No.

Matthias Miller  45:30
Save run report after say, let's take this one out

Unknown Speaker  45:49
finish I guess is string

Matthias Miller  46:00
if you don't have a report on done, it's on completion, it just says, just gives you a simple summary page it says one new record created

Matthias Miller  46:17
what else what other options do we have? So we can show message after save. Got it recorded should save digital saver. In fact, they shouldn't create records match close on Save K or illustrate this variation we do

Unknown Speaker  46:52
finish this

Matthias Miller  46:54
you can have a custom message on that subsequent screen or see what happens if you don't close on safe?

Matthias Miller  47:24
Well, goes on saved does not seem to do. Do anything? Okay, so here are the options. Number one, you know, basically it's a question, what should you do when you're done number one, you can redirect to another report. Number two, you can show the default message which is which is basically how many fields got modified. Or number three, you can have it redirect to a blank screen, or do a screen that shows some kind of dark message. Or it's Yeah. default message a number of records saved.

Matthias Miller  48:09
I think the reason being it's almost always I mean, it would be really confusing to stay in that same report. Because of the nature of how these work. You have to put special thought on how it would even work if you were to stay in the same report. Now.

Unknown Speaker  48:22
You could

Matthias Miller  48:25
you could have a redirect on save that takes it back to the same report if you wanted to.

Unknown Speaker  48:36
Oh, does it go back to blank, blank version of the report.

Matthias Miller  48:39
Either do blank version or you would I don't know. Have a hidden ask prompt bits that says only show show all knowledge three entries after this date after this activity ID and then you pass it back into the report and when you come back into the report. It can automatically include those it's janky but I mean it's janky but it's it's a little tricky but it could work.

Unknown Speaker  49:30
Okay, all right. Well, that gives us some tools in our toolbox.

Speaker 1  50:00
And then some stuff in data migration. So they would like to be able to import multiple phone numbers and multiple email addresses. So we, okay, first off for multiple from multiple addresses, you'd said they should give us a sample import file with a row for each address should match on name. And just wanted to clarify, do we need to be separate rows? Or can it be separate columns? Like, oh, wait

Matthias Miller  50:57
like that just one line one address one line to address one line, or address one city address one.

Speaker 1  51:05
Right. So do we need to do like if I have two addresses? Do I need two lines? Or can I do this is this is all address one. And then over here do address two stuff. If it was this, yeah, and multiple addresses?

Matthias Miller  51:27
Is this a custom import?

Unknown Speaker  51:30
As far as I know, I don't think we have we have a standard import.

Matthias Miller  51:37
How many addresses do we need to support

Speaker 1  51:40
there at this point, they said they said they'd be importing a company address and a home address because what they wanted to do here for their estimating 500 members at a time of data migration.

Matthias Miller  51:57
Okay, I mean I'm fine with I mean, I don't

Unknown Speaker  52:02
I don't see an issue

Matthias Miller  52:03
with that

Speaker 1  52:06
with having having columns for it rather than separate rows.

Matthias Miller  52:12
No, we just need to I mean, yeah, we can do it. I don't know if it's within scope of I don't know if this is specked out I don't know if it's within scope or not. But I mean, I don't see a substantial change but yeah,

Speaker 1  52:27
okay. I'm just seeing like for them to export it. I'm guessing out of Salesforce it would be exported as columns but I guess we could ask what that export looks like for them for them to go from columns to rows could be kind of complicated Yeah.

Speaker 1  53:09
Okay, so then for phone note from a conversation with I guess Miss maybe it was ls your LS preferred we have a column for each type and then fill with yes the applicable column and leave blank if na so is this Does this mean we would have a column for mobile yes no and then a column for mobile number and repeat that for all the phone types if we're again importing multiple phone types or phone numbers

Matthias Miller  53:51
I would do the latter I don't know why we wouldn't.

Speaker 1  53:54
Okay, so it works import that into the RG with the phone number RG from the

Matthias Miller  54:03
mean these are technical details but what I would do is I would populate the RG with that a row for each type. You put this you can put this in the dev spec and if this matters but populate the Populate the phone RG with a row for each type

Unknown Speaker  54:31
have a.

Unknown Speaker  54:46
Set

Matthias Miller  54:49
or populate populate the rows

Unknown Speaker  54:51
using repeat RG.

Matthias Miller  54:59
For each type delete will delete rows with a blank phone number and then in you know at the bottom or something similar like after all those next bullet point or something or something similar yeah sure

Unknown Speaker  55:37
okay

Unknown Speaker  55:40
and then this could also if we do it that way we could just use the main context import and and do it all in one fell swoop yeah and not have to worry about address like do that not have to worry about doing the extra important doing for addresses

Unknown Speaker  56:02
okay

Speaker 1  56:22
okay and then for email addresses, presumably we would Oh should those have a separate column for each email address or can they just be in the same cell and the comma separated?

Matthias Miller  56:37
Same cell comma separated is fine how do you determine which one's primary or do you specify a primary

Unknown Speaker  56:42
or is the first is primary

Unknown Speaker  56:44
The first is primary that's fine

Matthias Miller  56:54
think something that would be helpful here would be a training on imports and the ins and outs of imports even if you guys never ended up actually writing them just getting a training on the inner workings of finger help you guys love

Unknown Speaker  57:09
knowing what can be done and what can't be done Mm hmm

Unknown Speaker  57:18
yeah

Speaker 1  57:27
okay, well that looks like it covers all the hymns we had for you

Unknown Speaker  57:47
all right, do you guys want to keep rolling for another half hour? You're gonna take a quick break

Matthias Miller  57:57
where we at? I'm fine rolling for a half hour

Unknown Speaker  58:01
I think I'm doing okay

Unknown Speaker  58:09
sounds good. So the next is going to be at 333 and the topic of tax of Alera tax API

Unknown Speaker  58:33
we heard back from

Speaker 1  58:34
the client Matthias you can see there that all they need is the taxpayer jurisdiction

Speaker 1  58:47
so I guess just to get an initial initial GamePlan for where we'd be going with this we already have this configure sales tax rates that they're manually setting up

Unknown Speaker  59:08
they currently only have one in their life system

Speaker 1  59:16
so just yeah curious where where you think we should go with this? What questions we should ask them something something kind of new for me I think.

Matthias Miller  59:52
So on our sales tax things are they what are those called again?

Unknown Speaker  59:57
Sales tax rates.

Matthias Miller  59:59
If you pull went up this is based on state but is this is this Triple D specific

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
I'm not sure

Speaker 2  1:00:15
I guess it is it is

Matthias Miller  1:00:21
because this is going to be more specific and granular than state right or no

Unknown Speaker  1:00:28
does it still continue to be state?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:30
That's a good question that's probably one of the first questions we should ask him

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
by zip code he suggested ZIP Code zip search for ZIP Code

Speaker 2  1:01:04
actions taxable income tax rules get tax code and plant be an ID it shouldn't actually resolve address

Matthias Miller  1:01:43
tax rates by postal good ah found you

Matthias Miller  1:02:20
that's the documentation so basically what needs to happen is we need to change this record whatever record we have created I don't know if it's standard I don't know if it's custom. I can see if I can find out here but we need to change it to take to store postal code instead of a state do they want us to populate the postal codes for a given state like all zip codes in

Unknown Speaker  1:02:49
presumably

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
how often do they need to be updated?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:56
Or does it have to be real time?

Matthias Miller  1:03:15
Sales tax rate is something you need to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
triple the yes

Matthias Miller  1:03:22
Well, I mean they already said they recommend using an API connection to determine sales tax by zip code so I think that's reasonable so

Matthias Miller  1:03:50
well, let's do know it's all the states you sell to we're not doing all states and provinces I wouldn't do that because I don't see a good way to download. Wait, hang on Hey.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:40
region is the region supposed to be let's try Colorado. Download rates by zip code

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
So good state I think this is actually what we're going to do let me see doesn't all five digit

Unknown Speaker  1:05:28
daily update

Matthias Miller  1:05:32
okay so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:25
so let's do a let's do user spec

Matthias Miller  1:06:31
or a I don't know what this what exactly this requires sales tax rates which change from state to zip code

Matthias Miller  1:07:07
and then daily okay so then let me test triple the see how these are working now orders recent recent 3d Julian tag tax

Matthias Miller  1:07:34
I don't know how this is currently working

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
and then the habit daily daily we would have it would be automatically updated every morning soon after midnight sometime between midnight and opening hours with the latest tax rates

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
to update tax or to update tax rates for all postal codes in the US

Unknown Speaker  1:08:31
okay

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
dev spec is use the second API link that I sent create an X 32 update

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
the tax codes

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
use this the second one you sent here

Unknown Speaker  1:09:05
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:55
All right

Unknown Speaker  1:10:17
Okay, cool

Speaker 1  1:10:30
so it sounds like it's gonna be something somewhat simple

Matthias Miller  1:10:38
yeah now the only question I have is on

Matthias Miller  1:10:47
it let's see let's go find net where we currently use this or sales tax current rate okay fine previous

Unknown Speaker  1:11:09
Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:11:15
yeah, and then basically

Matthias Miller  1:11:16
it's a matter of currently we populate the tax rate when you enter the state but it's a matter of changing it to populate when you enter the zip

Matthias Miller  1:11:32
and then awarding when the current tax doesn't match the the entered tax doesn't match the current tax

Matthias Miller  1:11:45
I mean, that's already in place, it's just a matter of switching it over to look at those two instead of two.

Speaker 1  1:12:12
So what was that? Was there something else for the court orders? Are you saying that the authority take care of

Matthias Miller  1:12:18
it, it's implicit that it's taken care of. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:12:28
I would remove the documentation from that first segment at station link and go. Yeah, perfect. I would

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
they're not selling they're currently not selling in Canadian provinces. Are they?

Speaker 1  1:12:51
Right, I just wanted to, as far as I know, I just wanted to make sure he knew that.

Matthias Miller  1:12:59
But I mean, if you if you go into their system, and see where they have tax rates, sure. That's I think it's fair, but I think it's also fair assumption that

Speaker 1  1:13:11
they currently only have a tax rate set up for Pennsylvania. I just want to let them know ahead of time that this is not sure. Yeah. US states. And I guess these are these are mute points as well as far as how often it should be updated.

Matthias Miller  1:13:30
And one Freed's and which states I mean, unless they specifically want to exclude

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
other states

Matthias Miller  1:13:39
we can't exclude other states if they if they like it's just as easy for us to include

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
everything.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:19
Yep, good.

Matthias Miller  1:14:24
I mean, I don't think that we need to confirm there's more specificity than state either they give it to us by zip code. They're recommending that that's the only way to get accurate. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:14:48
Okay, great. And then, so, next, then would you be fine with following up with him about it?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:11
And

Unknown Speaker  1:15:14
then

Speaker 1  1:15:23
should we Mathias can we based on the zip code also populate, like automatically populate the state or isn't that now

Matthias Miller  1:15:32
if you pull that I mean if you pull it that link it doesn't it doesn't matter to me but if they want that for informational purposes you can go in there and you can look at all the columns of everything that we can't include scroll down we got up a little bit gotcha state abbreviation county name city name. state sales tax use tax county sales county use city sales to use total sales which is really what we're looking at total sales tax is all we really need to update do that is I guess another question Is there is any other shipping ever taxable

Matthias Miller  1:16:17
and desert do they have shipping and handling and are they?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
Okay

Unknown Speaker  1:16:59
so

Speaker 1  1:17:00
we do we have ZIP Code state county city

Matthias Miller  1:17:08
I don't particularly see a reason to do anything except total sales tax total sales tax and if it if it needed shipping and the shipping and handling I mean that's basically current rate

Unknown Speaker  1:17:28
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:13
Excellent

Speaker 1  1:18:19
very good. So we've got about 10 minutes left.

Speaker 1  1:18:37
Let's take a quick look at this 180 to 95.

Speaker 1  1:18:49
All right, so for thinking for their scheduled checking incidents, they are going from there wanting to change from a specific date for the check in to a week or checking in sometime in this week. And probably basing it on like looking at the Monday of that week. So we were talking with them about we're looking at options for how to calculate things. And, and what he really like is, is basically what we have here for the the schedule or for the email reminders. Yeah. Is that something that's like how easy or hard would that be to clone this into a different a different record type?

Matthias Miller  1:19:46
It's not, I mean, just a matter of cloning it there's something some logic that's shared. And we can share that and a lot of fields are expressions that need to be duplicated. Okay, so I mean, it's doable.

Speaker 1  1:20:01
Okay, but I mean, yeah, and obviously, it'd be more than just copy paste. But it's, yeah. But if you do it well, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:20:11
Is this gonna be on the incident?

Speaker 1  1:20:16
Maybe we're not sure yet, it's gonna either be on the incident or on a new custom, like region record. Because they're thinking about moving to more of a region base approach, where they, they group the clients together into a region. And then because they, they try to get to everybody in a general area in a week's time. So they're not running hither and yon for their check ins, right, efficient, so they'd be looking at, they're already trying to do that with some work around stuff. But I think as part of Phase Three, this summer, we'll be looking at out of region, record or somehow a better way to group clients by by area. And so anyway, all that to say, if we go that route, then the check in schedule will be based on the region will be derived from the region. And so everybody that's part of the central Ohio region would get would be on the same checking schedule. Right. So, either on the incident, or on the region to be determined. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:46
Okay.

Speaker 1  1:22:02
Any idea like, how much time you expect? I mean, they could basically duplicate it from what is what's existing. Is that a better? Better question for LS slumming?

Matthias Miller  1:22:20
Is it just the schedule? Or is it just a? I feel like that's a question. How's it? How's the schedule currently defined? If we're switching to regions? That's a whole other question.

Speaker 1  1:22:34
Right. Yeah. The whole the switching like the Yeah, that I that question be specifically with the scheduler feature like we're yeah, there's obviously other stuff that has to be worked out as far as how other logic works and the regions and all of that,

Matthias Miller  1:22:51
I'm gonna guess a junior developer who isn't familiar with what I've done, it's going to take him a day to

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
copy it over it. And something to note with that I'd also showed

Matthias Miller  1:23:22
the one for testing support email addresses that has pages a week and days instead of one through 31. And you said something like that would be even more simple because they'd be looking at doing week instead of every day. So could we have any of you go back to the scheduler can we dumb it down to just that well, we can if you learn all this one

Matthias Miller  1:24:18
as far as like repeat I mean if if we can. By the way, our new multi select list box could be pretty awesome for this

Unknown Speaker  1:24:43
was slim it down quite a bit

Matthias Miller  1:24:46
was slowing down quite a bit. And it might make it easier to copy paste across to multiple, multiple places.

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
But all the so the main thing that needs to be copied just FYI is any fields that we need to use like they're probably not going to need to say you know, I don't know the Tuesday before the third Wednesday or like the Friday before and so that can go they can choose which months they can choose which week and then all the logic to say give me here's today I need to know the end the next and week based on this week day, whatever like all that calculation stuff is is already is very easy to leverage. So it's

Unknown Speaker  1:26:00
Yeah

Speaker 1  1:26:05
and actually they would want yeah, okay, that sounds good. We can kind of take it from there but yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:30
Okay, cool, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:37
We'll

Unknown Speaker  1:26:40
have to work on next call

Speaker 1  1:26:51
and we can go ahead and call it a wrap for now.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:02
Okay. And

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07
on top talking next week, then. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:10
Sounds good. Thanks. Tuck them.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:14
Yep. Thank you.
