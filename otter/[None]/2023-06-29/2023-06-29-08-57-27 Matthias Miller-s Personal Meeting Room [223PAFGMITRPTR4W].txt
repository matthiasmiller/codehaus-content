Unknown Speaker  00:46
Oh, no

Speaker 1  00:51
you're saying these things go to Mike. Is this what is being sent to him?

Unknown Speaker  00:56
I mean, yeah, he's getting it somehow. What's what's the what's the first page? The first page is just his comments. I don't

Unknown Speaker  01:11
know. Are you 100% Sure it's automated to him.

Speaker 2  01:15
I don't know if it's automated or not. I thought that I mean, I thought I've gotten some of these before the sales wallboard so what I've been wondering how he's finding out about them

Unknown Speaker  01:32
I can ask you to so

Speaker 1  01:35
the only automated outbound stuff on that I know of well, if you didn't create it and don't know about it, I know that Josh doesn't know anything about it. Unless Unless Seth or or unless Nick created some that I don't know of anything that sends to him automated

Unknown Speaker  01:52
today. So are the viewers letting him know?

Unknown Speaker  01:57
I think so. I mean, hold on a second. Let me let me see what ginger says then I see.

Speaker 1  02:29
I know that in Indiana, Wayne has required his dealers to let him know when there's a sale now I do expect that if they're letting him at they're letting him know by email then. Then he can obviously go and pull people's pulling it she says no, she doesn't let him know. How does he find out? Unless he's just pulling the sales wallboard or or

Unknown Speaker  02:59
I don't honestly know. Yeah, but are you able to hear me say again? Yeah, but I don't know that I I'm almost convinced that I've seen things come through come through to watch like that he's sending out that hasn't hit the wall board I don't know. I have to go back.

Unknown Speaker  03:35
Because the wallboards instantaneous

Speaker 2  03:38
right not I guess the main thing I want to know is

Speaker 1  03:47
well if you can narrow if you can narrow timeframe and go look at transmission logs, you probably can start to figure out

Unknown Speaker  03:55
how he's pulling it

Unknown Speaker  04:14
ginger says

Speaker 1  04:14
no, it's a she doesn't know how he finds out they don't see it. They just randomly get an email saying

Unknown Speaker  04:24
you still cheat

Unknown Speaker  04:31
remind yourself Hold on a second. So now the

Speaker 3  04:39
endogenous paranoia and we need your 36 and a half Amish man named Shannon Leigh BA. Okay. We're talking about with Gabriel just a couple minutes ago regarding that property. I told you I'm speaking

Unknown Speaker  04:51
of the

Speaker 3  04:55
North Alex Jacob accent during Saulsbury
