Speaker 1  00:28
Howdy howdy, howdy. Howdy. We're gonna we're gonna make this really funny ended up put you up on the big screen nice so if you see me looking sideways it's because I'm looking at you

Unknown Speaker  00:51
know this isn't really gonna work because

Matthias Miller  00:54
you're not the only one it looks like was it me

Unknown Speaker  01:05
well played well played.

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Alright, we're gonna figure out who's whose sound we're going to use. Okay, you've

Unknown Speaker  01:12
muted Yeah. But it's not even a word.

Unknown Speaker  01:23
You're going to be right in the projector light

Unknown Speaker  01:24
because

Speaker 2  01:31
long as we can see multiple angles and Dwayne. That's just weird. Let's just Let's do Dwayne's on here. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  01:46
Cool. I don't know

Speaker 2  01:48
because because of vectors here we can put it on in a row with us video

Speaker 1  02:00
that's why I turn the camera around I'm not going to work either. I would share with you but

Speaker 3  02:10
be a little hard you don't have it figured out yet spot where you knew where you can eat without being seen. So

Matthias Miller  02:22
sorry. I missed it was it? Oh,

Speaker 3  02:25
I said you don't have it figured out as well as you do. You had a spot where you? You could where you can eat off camera.

Matthias Miller  02:36
Exactly. You think I'm just wandering around like you know who knows what I'm thinking but I'm actually serving Goodman actually no you know sometimes I am Yes. The

Unknown Speaker  02:52
you get my my email I just said

Matthias Miller  02:56
yes.

Speaker 3  02:59
You have something maybe we can start with what you have or we can start with Alberdi

Matthias Miller  03:05
I mean, I mean I've got updates

Unknown Speaker  03:08
while we wrap down to buy till news that sounds cool report that you had that

Matthias Miller  03:26
it's now under I mean, it's still there. It has a different name. Probably.

Unknown Speaker  03:34
It's your words that are

Matthias Miller  03:36
Yeah, let me share the screen due to under accounting, all of the accounting impact reports are here and said that would that would be under deposit transactions

Unknown Speaker  04:01
the transactions

Matthias Miller  04:04
Wow. I'm pointing to building and seeing deposit. Building transactions I'm so sorry. No, okay. Yeah. Which reminds me you know, have a will that one didn't wait. We didn't make it on the menu. All right.

Unknown Speaker  04:35
Yeah, that's it.

Matthias Miller  04:44
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  04:45
so could we also or should we also think Joshua, create those two reports. They talk to a lot of we should also move beliefs reports to the economy Impact Report.

Matthias Miller  05:06
Yeah, we got Pio transactions. Isn't those right? Yeah. That's Josh's vendor invoice. Oh. Okay.

Speaker 3  05:17
So if we want to dig deeper into accounting for those automatic transactions, that's where we would look for those. Yes. Good. Well, it takes care of buying so well, let's just go back to the top in group speeds to deposit module, understand you're just going to bunch or Bachelor a whole bunch of also. And that should take care of that. Do you have more?

Matthias Miller  05:57
Yeah. And I had drew, I mean, I had seen that I. That was something that I could do after the update. I was whether rightly or wrongly, I didn't know what I didn't know where I should have probably clarified where it fell in relative priority. But

Unknown Speaker  06:17
no, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  06:20
Yeah. I wish we should be able to get to get to that at some point today. Okay, depending on when we wrap up this call and depending whether we need the three o'clock will especially help with that the district should be seen change that you already asked were. That one has already been made. Should be live with this guy right here.

Speaker 2  06:53
Oh, so you're saying you made that change?

Matthias Miller  06:56
Yes. Okay. But the mass removal? I didn't. Yeah.

Speaker 2  07:04
Okay. Yeah, I mean, there's, there's whoodles there so I figured you could probably do something faster than I could go through and play. Exactly. And for number two there, did you do do you just go by the district as on deposit or did you do the disorder? Like the second option that I have their district

Matthias Miller  07:26
under deposit? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3  07:36
Are we correct in our assumption that mass removing a bank deposit or payment records would speed up?

Matthias Miller  07:48
Should Yes, and if not, we can take a look at what what else is left it's making it slow.

Speaker 3  07:55
Okay, good. So we were looking at the multi sales or payment function this morning and had a bunch of questions

Matthias Miller  08:06
so if you could just

Unknown Speaker  08:09
look for that work and

Matthias Miller  08:14
let's start with

Matthias Miller  08:20
so the idea the idea was that you would start in the receive payments screen and just be working your way through receiving payments done it until you get to one that check that's for three buildings and so you would come over and hit New multi sales order payment and you would fill in the this is paid by cheque and the total was 4878 91. And looks like we have a typo and then you would save let me see if we've got one in here we do have one in here and then once you save this bottom part here becomes visible you would hit link sales orders and it would find you

Matthias Miller  09:22
wait a minute. This is another one I just pulled up was nice guy was Ohio. Then he would just pull up and say it was for this one this one this one this one and hit save and it's going to complain that I am we have to cancel this sir

Matthias Miller  09:58
it's gonna say the total payment is for 10,000 Under the second sales orders equals 17. Five, and you can save, they'll show this if it doesn't match up, you can ignore and save, and then they would show up under the under this screen here.

Speaker 2  10:19
We didn't run into where we thought that if the payment was not received on that sales order, then they would not show up here to tie them together. Now, is that was that just a fluke or?

Matthias Miller  10:37
Which talking to receive payments? So if a payment is received, it wouldn't show up here.

Speaker 2  10:47
Like, Mark, you had a you had an item that was a Multan sale or payment? And the the actual items on that payment are not in our present list. Oh, yeah, that's

Speaker 3  11:10
I think it was because they had not been invoiced yet. It what, what determines whether well I can give you that number, you can search for cy. So it's 26422623. And it's not an N numbers, like N O H N NY just right. Okay.

Matthias Miller  11:35
Well, let's find out.

Matthias Miller  11:43
And why is it the?

Matthias Miller  12:05
New York District?

Matthias Miller  12:11
And that's one of the reasons why it's not showing up. Let's take the Yeah, no, that is why it's not showing up. So is there a macro? I wonder if there's a macro that's handles that scenario that treats New York as Ohio for the sake of some things? Is that what should happen?

Speaker 3  12:35
It should doubt him. He's consolidated those on in some areas, but not I think unfinished goods. Any Projects direct? Only, we still have to guess which we did for district and stuff. Yeah, we consolidated district x one to one. You're not, but if there's an easy way to do that, that would be are we going to mess things up? Finish? If Jeff. If it's not really we're just

Speaker 3  13:23
are we basically saying on this report that shows if if the user selects well, okay, can we select two districts when we do this? Or does it go? It doesn't?

Matthias Miller  13:39
I mean, I don't think you want to do that because you don't want people to need to remember that they have to also select New York, when they're processing things. Am I? That's

Speaker 3  13:48
correct. They should because Trump Cheney picks it on this reporter should we? I mean, we think of those two is all one district the only place where we're thinking of it as two districts is there is just drag things over as two different districts. So they have two lists of inventory. They issue separate payments for

Unknown Speaker  14:19
Billington. So we are but from our basis, it could it should always be considered a whitelisted

Matthias Miller  14:33
that's what it was. No Let me yeah, I'm not I'm not finding offhand where Josh was handling that if he's got it. Just standard way that that he was

Matthias Miller  15:00
It must have been it wasn't a finished good cemetery report, wasn't it? So this would be?

Unknown Speaker  15:11
Yeah. For me

Matthias Miller  15:18
if ghire buildings, district

Speaker 3  15:23
No. Well on the finished goods and still separating

Matthias Miller  15:32
where's the where's it combined?

Speaker 3  15:37
Party he combined as he takes us through that as a diva level?

Matthias Miller  15:46
It's fine.

Speaker 1  15:47
I think the billboard got change. But that would even though it should slip them out as

Unknown Speaker  15:56
well, we're not sure.

Matthias Miller  16:00
Let me chase it down. So New York should be treated as Ohio district for filtering slash matching in. Yeah. Counting,

Speaker 3  16:14
be sure to coordinate with God because I know that. I know that. Depending on what we change it to go great. The connection between composite assists, I think on top things are accomplished. So think of it as two separate tools.

Matthias Miller  16:36
Okay, I think what I'll try to do Yeah, I mean, I'll try to to Yeah, I will, I will localize it changes just to accounting. So oh, that's fine. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:55
I think go back to that multi sales order report. What were you raising? You had some questions, or some changes do ended? Like you thought it would? What was it that?

Unknown Speaker  17:12
I'm trying to understand where it's supposed to do?

Matthias Miller  17:17
Okay, well, so, big picture. There's two parts in the getting paid process. One is, somebody verifies that we have the cash in hand. And then part two is somebody goes and takes it to the bank. So far, so good. Yeah. Okay, so what this is strictly dealing with? Do we have the cash on hand? No, normally, yes. They're all good. Nothing for 90% of the time, when somebody hands us a check, or whatever the number is 95% of the time when they hand us a check. It's for one building, or one thing or one sales order. It's not for a whole host of things with the exception of you know, SDI and, and other types of wholesale buildings, but a lot of transactions are like that.

Speaker 3  18:14
I have an actual ACH payment from yesterday. From ships, right? For three buildings, would it be helpful to do that? Alright. So it's a New York District? If you still have that number that I gave you, that was okay, I'll give you the

Matthias Miller  18:35
let's do. Let me do first of all, we're gonna do can we use this?

Unknown Speaker  18:42
Yeah, that's just the demo.

Matthias Miller  18:46
Okay, so the date was free yesterday. 1130.

Speaker 3  18:50
And it's, it's New York District so that we can find those buildings. Ach, the payment method is ACH. And the total is 23,007 3180.

Matthias Miller  19:09
And as we're gonna see,

Unknown Speaker  19:11
here, the sales orders to look into it, you

Matthias Miller  19:15
all right. are wildly slow report.

Speaker 3  19:22
So a response to 6422623. Okay, and this one should have a payment amount of 12,008 5143 that matches it. If it wouldn't match. Can we edit the amount there?

Matthias Miller  19:39
Yeah, you could do like zero and then do a write off and explain why.

Speaker 3  19:48
But the amount, what amount is that bringing in

Matthias Miller  19:51
the balance?

Speaker 3  19:54
So if there was a previous payment, it would it would assume And then you're trying to pay off the balance. Okay, the next one is 26464023. The amount of 2430 Got it? Yeah. And then the last one who sees four? By three by?

Matthias Miller  20:34
Alright, let's find out why that one's that is that

Matthias Miller  20:42
that's a North Carolina district for some reason. Let me I'm gonna, I'm gonna copy this out. Well, actually, no, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna save the changes. And yes, it's wrong, then we're gonna go, I don't know if this is going to work. Yes, it's going to work. We're going to change this one back to the Ohio district and rerun it. And we're going to

Speaker 3  21:19
are you saying this is, but this should go? To 64264535 to three.

Matthias Miller  21:36
Someone's not showing up for some reason.

Unknown Speaker  21:39
Maybe ahead. Right. So you're not seeing that sales order at all? No,

Matthias Miller  21:45
I'm seeing it just not seeing it in here. Let me let me find out why it's not in here. I can

Speaker 1  21:54
this, my I know exactly what's happened. Now. This

Unknown Speaker  21:58
is what your people like. We were just saying yes.

Speaker 1  22:02
So that because I didn't realize that he was linking in that one from the accounting side into the receipt payments report. They're the same thing. And and no, it's it's not bringing, like if you bring in if you bring in one that has a payment, it gives you that as a negative balance. So this makes a lot more sense.

Matthias Miller  22:29
doesn't have that true. Payment field multi This is Oh, wait. This is in North Carolina district building.

Unknown Speaker  22:46
But when you have

Matthias Miller  22:49
no distressed, distressed

Speaker 1  22:53
it probably was labeled North COVID The modification history and see when it was labeled North Carolina it may have been like eons ago.

Unknown Speaker  23:01
Now this is your recently built building. The dealer,

Speaker 1  23:06
the dealer is is not correct. It's back way back when we started building dealers and we I was assigning our this is an incorrect assignment.

Matthias Miller  23:17
Language back in September of 21. We said tri state block and pool is North Carolina, but it's actually New York. Is that right? That's right. Yes. Okay. So then if we go back to why are we still here?

Speaker 1  23:31
Well, because there's historical stuff yet. I don't think that Joshua did he can wholesale convert stuff isn't just moving forward, moving forward. Okay, we're down to three, three dealers moving forward, but

Speaker 3  23:43
it's this way. It's 2645353. And then, yeah, and that's at 450 40. So does that does your mom total those up? Now, do you need to have a I see there's no place or maybe there is if the payment method is kept? You need to have a replacement for the check. Do we not?

Matthias Miller  24:21
Know we should probably have a payment ID on here?

Speaker 3  24:27
Like we do we have single payments

Matthias Miller  24:34
and single payments, we just have notes. So that's what you would that's probably what you would put in here or here you you'd have your confirmation ID

Speaker 3  24:47
is that how are you planning to do that in collections? When you record payments don't Are you gonna just put the check down on the note and that's there's no reason basically yeah

Speaker 1  25:00
I don't think so. No I mean the only the only thing I don't like about this is that normally if somebody in my office doing this they make notes on every single one of those where it came from and if you're doing this way there's no way to leave notes

Matthias Miller  25:17
Well, I mean

Unknown Speaker  25:19
that that applies to all sales order payments then

Matthias Miller  25:23
yeah, this I mean this this Yes. Okay, perfect. All right, and then I I believe there's a process to copy this across on to know the notes go here should be a link to go into the multi sales order payment from here. Let me make a note to do that. Add a link so payment RG to pull up the multi so payment and so from here they will be able to have a link here's the payment ID they can go look it up that way but that will link to pull up the payment and drop in drop in here and see the notes Yep, perfect. Perfect. For the sake of accounting though, this district needs to be Ohio right. Where are you wanting? Are you wanting to enter it as New York and we just push New York accounting into you know,

Speaker 3  26:22
it would make more sense to the other way around the way we only have three history selections here but why do we Why do we have districts here in companies other places just because we could we have to change we do but this would

Matthias Miller  26:49
actually rather have an accounting company

Speaker 2  26:54
is the New York districts billings go into the Ohio

Speaker 3  27:01
Yeah, it's the point is that me you're a you're the people that are doing this affordable Ohio they is they know what that means is at all they're used interchangeably throughout that so this is basically just want free so selections here and you like Ohio New York

Matthias Miller  27:34
okay. I mean if it's easier to

Unknown Speaker  27:42
okay

Speaker 1  27:49
I'm gonna be really picky. Can you move multi so payments under Accounts Receivable instead of FGI? Reports?

Matthias Miller  28:01
Owning accounts receivable, you

Unknown Speaker  28:04
have it over there under FTAs?

Matthias Miller  28:10
How about vendor invoices, needing payments? Maybe go ahead and do that over there to that.

Speaker 1  28:15
Somewhere else, the only the only thing I would say Matthias I wonder if the multi sales or payments can just live in the standard library, it doesn't necessarily be on the menu, because you should do all of that through receive payments.

Unknown Speaker  28:30
That's that's what caused me

Speaker 1  28:31
massive confusion this morning. So now now that we're back around full circle, I fully understand what's going

Matthias Miller  28:37
on. Good. Well, sorry for my very groggy response this morning. So I'm glad we're all

Speaker 1  28:46
here for the rather stout argument that Drew and I were having fun

Speaker 2  28:49
over it were different things.

Unknown Speaker  28:55
We were completely passing each other. And anyway, neither one of us correct.

Matthias Miller  29:05
I'm glad I'm here to straighten things out. All right, vendor invoices, the pay payment can go into payables. This whole thing. I don't want to if you guys have spare time today, I would welcome you guys taking a screenshot or something of this. And we're printing out a copy and drawing arrows and things where you want things because deposits do not go into FDA reports. Transaction verification doesn't go there.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
I mean, what Matthias

Speaker 1  29:42
the last the last time we had a lot of conversation about menu items. Somebody had drew up like a Google Doc or something and you could move stuff around and yep, you need to do again.

Matthias Miller  29:55
Ben, would you want to hunt down some of the Google doc there is an assist menu. aka spreadsheet let me actually see if I could find it for you quick and then sometime

Matthias Miller  30:16
see Dwayne's copy of? Here it is,

Speaker 1  30:21
yeah, sure, sure to drew that way he can move stuff around and it, I have a feeling it would, it would be probably pretty valuable for you to kind of organize.

Speaker 2  30:31
Because at this point, I need to tell everybody where everything is.

Speaker 1  30:37
Oh, it's in this section, go go five down to that column.

Speaker 2  30:42
I know, another another thing to move. So that happened now. But but the FTI financial allocations, there's a whole lot of items in there that should probably go into accounting companies, or

Unknown Speaker  30:58
that's a little bit of a different thing that some of the like, it's a configuration thing that somehow be detached by the dorks wordings. But I just don't want to live with it. Why? The bigger I'm learning by doing? Well,

Matthias Miller  31:20
we have the pleasure here of flying by the seat of our pants, and making all sorts of changes and additions and things. And never taking a step back and saying, Wait, did we like? I feel like we have to we've had to be pretty tactical in this. But we're not, we haven't had much time to step back and look at the big picture and say, Are all these things organized correctly? And whatever. And anyway,

Speaker 2  31:47
Ben, what's playing out at this time, there's a lot more important things to do than that. So now that you have organized,

Matthias Miller  31:57
then when when Ben's got if, if or when, but I don't, I don't know that this is super high priority, I think this can be as as you've got time, with depending on other priorities. But if you can put together that spreadsheet, with the accounting menu options, and get it over to Drew and Drew, you can think it's great. I'm happy to let you organize these things better. And I'll make some of these. I might actually been wanting to want to wait, I mean, just check in with me before you do. I might take a stab at cleaning some of this stuff up as well. My eight

Speaker 1  32:36
people are gonna hate me. But I wonder if there's stuff on the inventory tab of the accounts payables don't want to move? And the back of

Unknown Speaker  32:46
something that can be in both

Speaker 1  32:47
places? Okay, yeah, we can, we can, you can have both places. And that might be pretty valuable. But this gets this gets digested? Like having voices, then reinforces it. And in accounting is what happens is I go over there.

Matthias Miller  33:08
Okay, so just for the sake of keeping on track, improve speed through deposit module we covered? I'll work on that. Hopefully today deposit. I mean, I'm putting on my list for today. So I'm

Speaker 1  33:22
talking about speeds, is there any way to speed up some of those receive payments stuff?

Matthias Miller  33:27
Well, getting rid of all the old transactions is going to help a lot. Sure. Like you should normally have 1000s of things outstanding. I mean, if I were consulting with a company, and I knew that they had over 10,000 items and 20,000 items in AR I'd probably tell them that that's a good place to start.

Speaker 3  33:51
But so can you do the same thing here that you're doing in the deposit module? Like how are we going to get rid of all this old stuff?

Matthias Miller  34:01
Yeah, these all these will all get tied out to a single man. I think the idea was we'll backdate but what does that mean for accounting though? I guess we'll ignore the accounting impact once we change the start date.

Speaker 1  34:13
Okay. Once they get deposited, they come out of here, correct?

Matthias Miller  34:17
That's correct. So we're gonna create a massively humongous deposit. Right. So that's cause it's probably gonna be pretty slow to open. But

Unknown Speaker  34:32
yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  34:35
Filter payment types for vendors by company on contact record after contacts. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:43
if you go to the contacts and the vendor it is yeah. Now select your accounting company.

Unknown Speaker  34:53
The company is ABC. Okay, yeah, now the payment

Unknown Speaker  34:57
either ABC

Matthias Miller  35:03
Let me just note that

Matthias Miller  35:13
hey, good. Good for

Speaker 3  35:17
Drew go ahead and explain or join this was your request. I don't think

Speaker 1  35:23
I was just gonna build that myself because I don't even know what exactly what that thing to do yet.

Speaker 3  35:30
You're talking about payment age and report. Yeah. So you just got to do that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  35:35
I'm going to do that and probably finagle a number of different times until it does what we want it to do.

Unknown Speaker  35:41
And then you're going to Yeah,

Matthias Miller  35:45
I mean, yeah, it's, it's effectively once you've got the here let's go back pulling one of these I mean, it's effectively a report like this but filtered somehow with aging capabilities or something.

Speaker 1  36:04
Yeah, so basically payments that have been received but not deposited. I want to I want to time for something like I was seeing this, I'll probably hack off one of these but this is yeah.

Matthias Miller  36:17
Yeah. I mean, I would make my life easy and do it over here. But yeah, next up, I'm covered by number six. Okay, so rubber stamping is off, right? Yes. Okay. So but then we're wanting to know which ones were rubber stamped.

Speaker 3  36:45
Well, there's two pieces we want to resolve okay, we want to we need a list of all the ones that were rubber stamp that were invoice rubber stamp during that time period and you're going to go by activity then we do have specific examples of some that will rubber stamp that were invoice that disappeared from finished goods that should not be moved out to finished goods and it was it was it was ones that have no delivery date

Speaker 3  37:32
and can you add a column for the what is the description to build on your will

Unknown Speaker  37:37
building

Unknown Speaker  37:40
this ability to have that description?

Speaker 3  37:43
Because it is a lot of storage units behaving storage units Yeah.

Matthias Miller  37:54
Okay, and then we want to presumably sort of

Speaker 1  37:56
do the job Oh, those are not though you want to look nice you want to filter for building build date? Is it or building final delivery date is is isn't it?

Speaker 3  38:11
Because you record it those Aktobe Jr. I saw his report this morning. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  38:19
Okay, but this is also it has a building and the building wasn't delivered

Unknown Speaker  38:23
Correct. Take off your so

Matthias Miller  38:27
am I right that this is also it's I mean, we don't care about invoices. Sales Orders not tied to a building.

Unknown Speaker  38:34
Yes, yes, please.

Matthias Miller  38:37
Okay. Wait about that. All right, here they are.

Speaker 1  38:46
That's probably what I had last night. Yeah. So here's here's some of the unique situations we have. We have Okay, so easy way storage is a we've got a ton of storage units. They have no final delivery date, but they have an invoice date. And if you take out the invoice date that puts them on the sales orders needing invoicing because they're not a delivered by default company and they have no transit test. So a district X without a transit task automatically shows up for sales orders meeting invoice.

Matthias Miller  39:24
Okay, it's early, you're gonna have to bring it down slowly. So okay,

Unknown Speaker  39:29
so let's start with Salesforce meeting invoicing.

Unknown Speaker  39:32
Yeah, go to the I report,

Matthias Miller  39:35
I think no, I think I think I got it. Okay. So so these, okay, in real life, we're not talking accounting or anything like this. These things get built in what happens with them.

Speaker 1  39:46
Well, what they are okay, the biggest the biggest offender here is easy way storage so it's easy to talk about them but easy way storage is storage units that affordable barring company there Essentially a fixed a type of fixed asset that sits there and generates income. But we don't want to, like they're not sold, they're not like, and we don't really have we haven't had a way to move them into some kind of fixed asset account. So they've been sitting on finished goods inventory

Speaker 3  40:17
no more than into the asset management that into the asset management table at some point, but it'll probably be next month or

Speaker 1  40:35
so he says the impact on finished goods inventory, so we cleaned out the invoice date, which then puts them back on the sales orders needing invoicing because district x your code says district X buildings without a transit tasks need to be invoice.

Matthias Miller  40:49
Okay, so then what's your plan for?

Matthias Miller  41:01
Like we could say this

Speaker 1  41:08
when it comes to situations that we have like this are wholesale dealers and I think if you refined your your this upset for sales orders needing invoicing to account for wholesales buildings with no transit tasks, we'd be fine. In other words, if it's if it's not a wholesale dealer, then it doesn't have a transit task. It doesn't ever show up to the invoice

Matthias Miller  41:33
it's not a wholesale dealer. So if you don't have a transit task for retail, or for a retail dealer

Unknown Speaker  41:44
then don't show it up to the invoice

Matthias Miller  41:47
it'll just hide. Yeah. Okay, well, these are this is always fun. This thing is like a Ebrahimi. I mean, it is quite interesting. So, let's actually do this, we're going to do no sales order. This is actually let's do

Speaker 1  42:13
so what's what's the hang up to move it into a fixed asset account when you're done with them?

Unknown Speaker  42:23
Yeah, because there's a lot of stuff that so I don't have to fix assets anywhere else have to pay sales and use tax on?

Speaker 1  42:37
Even don't you get once you get depreciation value out of moving into fixed asset California?

Speaker 3  42:43
Yeah, you would, but we have a sales use tax, which we don't cancel skirt. Because, like if, if it was getting really technical, but if we take a doorknob out as raw material in the shop and use it to the shop, then we're using that so I'll use so we're not going to go back and say are these 99 doorknobs were tax exempt for this one? No, this one right here. Here's an example. On one wants you to pay sales tax at one point. So we have to pay the US tax on because they'll ask for to ask. So there's a lot of steps.

Matthias Miller  43:33
Okay, so if it's district X, and not dealer field, or and dealer field, so dealer, no. And hang on. It's easier than that. So is wholesale. This is what you're proposing

Matthias Miller  44:01
No, it's

Unknown Speaker  44:02
if you run it for Ohio, you know.

Matthias Miller  44:06
And so it's Wholesale is wholesale and isn't a war build on site if without district buildings district X build on site or wholesale buildings without transit tasks get invoiced the day after build alright.

Matthias Miller  44:38
And so proposed invoice date does not equal load so proposed invoice date

Speaker 1  44:53
what is Matthias doing? That's taking 10 minutes to run me on assist.

Matthias Miller  44:59
It's over Done. Brigid I'd say anything

Matthias Miller  45:10
so is this look right?

Speaker 3  45:16
Oh, you're What? Are you? Were looking at all those sheets. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:20
all districts are gonna have the why

Unknown Speaker  45:42
Right, correct. Great.

Matthias Miller  45:45
Okay, so invoice date through it's these guys but that's not all of them that were in the other list let's find out why.

Matthias Miller  46:08
So we want to know

Matthias Miller  46:17
see if it is wholesale. Let's do this. So is wholesale. And let's get the transit types Ah

Matthias Miller  46:38
okay, you

Speaker 1  46:39
made your work you made that macro local is that right? Hence the reason you Gotcha. So this makes sense. So this will update the cars sales or knee and voices standard.

Matthias Miller  46:52
Yeah, we need to I mean, once we get the macro right, then we can then I'll push it across. So yeah, live over the weekend. Hopefully. Do not do. Okay, so here's one that is not wholesale. This one got marked as retail. Why is this one retail?

Unknown Speaker  47:11
finska says Okay, since because, yeah,

Matthias Miller  47:13
I'm sorry, this one is you also want this only be Ohio, right?

Speaker 1  47:19
Ohio, but North Carolina does have you know, if there are going to be some like Okay, so. And then we find and then we find the outliers? Well, I know did you account for the you probably should account for deliver buildings by default as well on the dealer record.

Unknown Speaker  47:46
So let's go Statesville one.

Matthias Miller  47:52
shins to go Statesville this guy

Speaker 1  48:00
need to get up there update into everybody dividends by default. And so we're going to have some historical information because we just updated them to deliver buildings by default to get around some of these issues. So we this this means I can go and do the other thing I did inside the transit tests. Right. On the scheduling side.

Unknown Speaker  48:21
Oh, like New York doesn't know

Speaker 1  48:24
for for for North Carolina? Because, yeah. If we're updating the macro to operate correctly inside the sales or the invoicing that I'm going to do that work. I think you're I think you're accounting correctly. Matthias, there's going to be some out there's going to be some junk information in here. That's that has crossover implications.

Unknown Speaker  48:45
So like the the Ohio earth

Unknown Speaker  48:51
I think he froze or reefer.

Matthias Miller  48:59
I mean, so is this one supposed to be this one should have been wholesale?

Unknown Speaker  49:03
No, he used to be he used to be.

Matthias Miller  49:09
He's missing a transit task.

Speaker 1  49:12
So we did not have he delivers his own buildings. And so we did not have it marked to have transit tasks created. And so in this case, well, I so in this case, it's one of two ways we can go. We were planning on marking their dealer so that it does create transit tasks and then hiding them from scheduling, which falls inside of the parameters of your macro unless you want to take into account did not deliver by default. I mean, that makes your head hurt.

Matthias Miller  49:47
Yeah, this is one of those cases where once January 15 rolls around, we should prop up our feet and say, Is this really how we want to do this but until then, well, then

Speaker 1  49:59
reason this happens is we get into there's there's a number of dealers that we've gone off and made deals with on varying degrees of deliver or not deliver or training tasks and not trying to test. And now we're trying to account for all of those situations.

Speaker 3  50:15
Well, I'm wondering if you mean, do we need to wait till January 15? Could we could we spend 20 minutes now and just go through the scenarios? This is the invoicing portion is one of the most critical parts in accounting. And I'm not sure if seems to me like we're making it almost harder than it is.

Matthias Miller  50:45
I mean, we could do this not so dealer field, dealer, deliver buildings. And know if we could say we could just if they deliver buildings, by default, we could always do dealer field. So dealer, if they deliver buildings, by default, their name field, we could always invoice them day after build.

Unknown Speaker  51:31
You're saying if they do not deliver by default,

Matthias Miller  51:35
if they do not deliver by default? Well,

Speaker 1  51:37
so the only thing is, is like all of these, I don't particularly like that, because that makes the building fall on finished goods inventory. In some of these situations, they're supposed to let us know when they delivered that building. So it will generate a delivery date, which will then put it back on sales orders needing invoicing. So

Matthias Miller  51:57
what you really want is you what you what you really want is transit tasks that are managed by your logistics team, or whoever, whoever communicates with them to find out whether the building actually got picked up.

Speaker 1  52:10
Well, and that's the same conclusion that we came to is, let's just go ahead and generate transit tests for these because even though we're going to hide them from the schedule and report, they still need a transit test to mark off that it was done.

Unknown Speaker  52:24
You can't just enter the lottery date directly.

Speaker 1  52:26
You can but this this goes back to the same conversation we had yesterday with Jr is like, let's have a CES reflect reality. You

Speaker 3  52:33
need to train to test whether you've managed to whether

Speaker 1  52:37
we whether we complete them or whether whether we scheduled them or not. It's still need to transmit test, which so that we have something that we can, you

Speaker 3  52:45
aren't your people always, if the hauler doesn't mark it off the whole portal, you want your people to go into the transit casket market complete. So thinking the other way, we could make it pretty straightforward, like we could completely I think we could completely skip the whole transit cast idea for the sailors in the invoicing for this. Summer to think of this as skip all of that. And we basically say if the building is retail

Speaker 3  53:26
and if the building dump. So here's the criteria from showing up on the list. The building needs to be retail and it needs to have the liberty and that's it.

Speaker 4  53:40
Yeah, and then you have another gate. So so one is

Speaker 3  53:44
building a retail that the sales order has a building sales order is retail and has a building any delivery date and then make it appear

Unknown Speaker  53:59
by challenge on it.

Speaker 3  54:03
The sale sales order it is for a retail deal with a building and has a delivery date

Speaker 1  54:14
shown on a sales invoice. So what were the other situations like we tried to account for build on sites, there'll be a whole bunch of these other situations. All of those will eventually get delivery dates.

Speaker 3  54:27
I think that the chance right we want to move on touch. I think the bill on sites we should build another condition that exactly the same as what I said except delivery date. It should be if it has built on site and it hasn't built this damage. Then that prompts put in there to liquidate it's a cleaner process. And then the final one is if it's retail.

Speaker 1  54:55
It's just the report kirpan saying make sure has a Build date, but it doesn't make sense to in case you accidentally put a delivery date in nonagon build, which would be silly, but I guess it could happen.

Speaker 3  55:11
That they were not, then we're not tied to the default settings on whether we live or we don't. So you're

Speaker 1  55:20
saying the essentially, on a digit gets retail on retail buildings is the moment it gets a delivery date, it shows up rainbows. No, nothing else brings it on there before that. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  55:48
By the way, your retail condition is that the sales order is retail or the dealer is retail?

Unknown Speaker  55:54
Well, it's pretty much if it's district debts.

Unknown Speaker  55:58
That's fair. But then the wholesale ones. There's buildings, the wholesale ones.

Speaker 1  56:10
You want to invoice them? Before? It there's there's only one downside to this whole logic and that is that wholesale that we don't always get notified that building was picked up by like, okay, literary structures, for example, he comes and picks up his own buildings, he hands Henry a check, we will probably close out that sales order as paid. But nobody ever tells us he picked up the building.

Speaker 3  56:34
Well, okay, but for I'm starting to question that a lot. I think there's a reason we made it as complicated as we wholesale buildings with a transit task means that you're doing the whole. So those don't we say those, that sale doesn't happen until we've completed the whole. But if there is no transit task on those, then we invoice the day average building. Because we're saying we're going to look, it's on our lot, Mr. dealer can pick it up. Like that's, that's the only concrete date we had. We don't know just like you said like when they come pick it up,

Speaker 1  57:11
if you account for that as simply as wholesale only for wholesale dealers because we have retailers that that look the same way. For example, She has to go to states for they deliver their own buildings and you know, but that's a that's a commission sale. It's a retail sale, it's not a hotel. So we could leave the

Speaker 3  57:30
wholesale side as it is. Like the whole sleeve STI and wholesale entourage. Just deal with

Speaker 1  57:39
essentially of its distribution, not wholesale then. Yeah, then you wait for a delivery date.

Speaker 3  57:45
And it has to have a building. Right? Yeah, if it's if it's district X and knock also in there's about three different conditions. The first one is it has a building and it's not go alongside then you wait for delivery. The second one is it hasn't building it hasn't built on site option, then you do that's good.

Speaker 1  58:10
And then finally be able to see it or write it out. Write it out mark so we can argue over something written down because I'm getting confused in my head.

Matthias Miller  58:19
Okay, so there's there's no building invoice immediate or yet no building. So not so building stin. And we would do so creation date. Yeah, so yeah. Not if there's an A. If it's a district X build on site, then we use the built date, which means it's an invoiced.

Speaker 3  58:53
One more related in that you say if it's district x, if it's district X, and it's retail then yes.

Matthias Miller  59:03
And retail build on site like you've got wholesale build on site, we do okay. And not so is wholesale Okay, and then

Speaker 3  59:21
district X retail built on site lies in the eggs. Yes. And then the final one is district eggs retail

Unknown Speaker  59:41
relies on delivery

Matthias Miller  59:46
consultant This is and then this would be and then we would say everything else is day after build

Matthias Miller  1:00:09
something like that. Well, what did I miss that let me fix this before we almost

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
Okay, so if it's no building invoice immediately makes sense. I mean, as you default to the creation date

Speaker 3  1:00:42
what we're starting at is is that the first condition like that applies to, to share through a to wholesale the all condition

Matthias Miller  1:00:53
Well, mostly our buildings have a skin

Speaker 3  1:00:58
Yes, but we have we will have some some that have no skin so those would be like what I'm asking that in 16 years description that applies to all sales orders, irregardless of whether their wholesale retail is Vx. It should. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:19
this is this is like think of this like a funnel. And so anything that that drops out, so first, first and foremost, if it's cancelled for a quote for the building was cancelled, don't invoice it? So that's first part of the funnel anything that makes it past that if it's not tied to a sin, then invoice as a creation date. Or if not that, is it a district X retail build on site? If so, use the built date if it's not that and it's a retail then use delivery if it's a district X retail well we should probably take the bill on site out of here then it's a then it's then it uses the final delivery date. Actually we could Yeah, I don't know if this is clear. We could almost we this is the same thing.

Matthias Miller  1:02:50
Some ways this is I don't know if this is clear or not. Are district X retail buildings you use the built eight. So if it's district x in retail, you use the build date for build on site otherwise he's the delivery date.

Speaker 3  1:03:08
So that gets rid of everything from 30 to 49 and then correct and then everything at everything is a bill

Matthias Miller  1:03:21
so that would be district X wholesale and non district X SDI

Speaker 3  1:03:30
Oh, okay, this is all this this is all this is everything but SDI.

Matthias Miller  1:03:39
No, I mean this would this

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
history actually tell

Matthias Miller  1:03:44
this would cover SDI and it would cover I mean, SDI wouldn't be district x so if we want to handle this SDI we need to

Speaker 3  1:03:56
okay, that that is not okay, we had lots of air for jets right? That match what Josh is doing on we just right.

Matthias Miller  1:04:11
Okay, but when when do we use so is this a Can we just say for nondistrict x that we use the

Matthias Miller  1:04:27
we use the final delivery date

Speaker 3  1:04:37
Josh is stopping in that farm that we brigade once a week right? First Yeah, in that case we can

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
Okay, so then in this case, so no building as the buildings, this becomes unnecessary because

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
Okay, and then I mean we could say here Wholesale is everything that that's left is district tax Wholesale is the after build so then if so is

Speaker 3  1:05:32
quite correct because that's where wholesalers are where we're using we said some wholesale deals it's Dariel sometimes we we do the delivery other times they pick it up so we had set

Matthias Miller  1:05:45
for wholesale

Speaker 3  1:05:48
if it has a transit pass then use the delivery date there's no transit pass then you see after bills

Matthias Miller  1:06:01
okay great

Matthias Miller  1:06:11
so then if

Matthias Miller  1:06:23
it if no transit tasks then otherwise let's do this

Matthias Miller  1:06:45
okay, so what do they do? Okay, so no building invoicing fixes before is to be an American on a date Oh

Matthias Miller  1:07:06
wholesale everything else that's left is

Matthias Miller  1:07:18
okay, go through this again. So no building invoice immediately. Obviously we did cancellations no building invoice immediately. Or here let's do this. Let's just make it clear. Never invoice cancelled. So those are quotes were cancelled. So slash Billings. Okay, no building we invoice immediately. SDI buildings use final delivery date so if not district X on that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:50
God Okay, perfect.

Matthias Miller  1:07:54
Everything that's left is district x. So for wholesale use delivery date if it has transit tasks they have to build if not, so let's make this actually reflect

Matthias Miller  1:08:18
so if it's wholesale and we don't have transit tasks and we do build a plus one otherwise use final delivery date. That means everything that's left is district X retail for these we use the build date for build on site and the final delivery date for everything else now on the build on site Do you also want to do the day after build or you want to do the day of build

Speaker 3  1:08:41
I would do the day out because pack up their tools meaning head out when it's tough Yeah. Yeah

Matthias Miller  1:08:50
All right. What should we see what this does? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
First it doesn't matter which

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
oh, let's do this. Let's not worry about date changes. Let's only change worry about has or hasn't

Unknown Speaker  1:09:17
think my ADV kicked in

Matthias Miller  1:09:31
would you expect to see

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
that right? No, there should be some STIs up there.

Matthias Miller  1:09:42
Hang on, hang on. Hang on. Hang on, hang on. I think we actually want to do

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
Okay, so this is showing anything that was invoiced and we think shouldn't or wasn't invoiced. This one for now

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
this shows things that the only things we're showing here are ones that we have here. Let's write know,

Speaker 1  1:10:35
these, these will potentially be your leftover outliers that don't matter.

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
Let's let's open up the floodgates a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:48
So, yeah, okay, well, what do we have here? Like, why do we?

Matthias Miller  1:10:54
Okay, we are seeing what we're seeing is all Ohio sales orders that were invoiced that we think shouldn't be or were not invoiced and we think should be using the new logic. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:11:10
So the first one has not been invoiced. But we think it should have been invoiced the first.

Matthias Miller  1:11:17
That's that's probably just because it's a new invoice. Well, maybe I'm not sure.

Speaker 3  1:11:25
I think this will have building that what for the 20 by 36 I think they were building out and yesterday they had market built and a lot of details show on that

Matthias Miller  1:11:41
yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:11:43
give you an update to this.

Matthias Miller  1:11:45
I'm sure.

Matthias Miller  1:11:59
That one was just built

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
row one is a one exam. Poly ramp.

Speaker 3  1:12:13
It was so today. Well,

Speaker 1  1:12:17
you want to account first. You want to exclude sales in that building? No, Jane.

Speaker 3  1:12:23
Well, for what we're looking here, I don't know. This is okay. How did this get in the system? Like who entered

Unknown Speaker  1:12:32
the parliament? Yeah. To necessery invoice

Speaker 3  1:12:35
for our Senate to make make expensive? Yeah. Okay, perfect. Yeah, that that logic is good. To the first too good. The next one we're saying 11 Seven Bill day. Why not invoice?

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
We live in eight. It says it should have been Yeah. Somebody made a change to it recently that would make it become invoiced now

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
propose invoice date says it has a proposed invoice date. It's been on the somebody has an invoice that it's on the list. Transit. Wyatt,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
can you figure out why? Why are we doing? We're not doing nothing? Is that bill?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:37
It's currently on sales orders, meaning invoicing. Has

Matthias Miller  1:13:40
a transit task.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
to Charleston. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:13:45
it's mean it's currently on sales orders dealing invoice. I don't know why it wasn't invoiced up until now, but it's currently on here.

Matthias Miller  1:13:53
But it wasn't the transit tasks wasn't completed.

Speaker 3  1:13:57
But okay, now this would fall under the category of that. If they're wholesale, and they have a transit desk

Speaker 1  1:14:15
so this is you're waiting for a delivery date for the ship? No. Yeah. To show up that boat, right. Yeah, but

Speaker 3  1:14:21
what was the report pedals? Was it saying? No, it hadn't post invoice date of

Matthias Miller  1:14:34
okay, let's do this. Let's, let's just break it down and figure out what's going on. Okay. So if we do, we're just going to start pulling stuff out until it did. Okay, so it says it's district x. Well, it says it has no transit types. Let's see if this is true yeah there are no transit types of transits transit tasks are linked to the building Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:15:10
but click on is the sales are missing product yet sales orders sales

Matthias Miller  1:15:14
orders missing. So, what needs to happen is like

Speaker 1  1:15:17
your transit test let me see the let me see the modification history on it

Matthias Miller  1:15:24
somebody deleted the deleted it from the old sales order but not never attached it to the new one.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:35
Make sense?

Speaker 1  1:15:37
So adding the sales order ID which would fix it. So

Matthias Miller  1:15:41
this will fix it

Matthias Miller  1:15:48
which means that now suppose invoice date is blank. And if we rerun this it'll be gone from it's gone. So, so, Dwayne, that's a, your office thing of how can we? I mean, do we need to look at return? Are we sure we don't want to look at transit tasks for both the building? Yes, that's exactly

Speaker 1  1:16:19
what I was gonna say. Like, either look at it from the building side or looking at it from both sides.

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
Upside down side, left side, transit building, skin MDX. concat ID no suffix. So building skin.

Speaker 1  1:16:44
That's what I'm talking about when you get into referencing indexes and interconnections of records.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:51
That's what separates developers. That's what that's

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
what separates them from the boys.

Matthias Miller  1:16:59
That's where That's where developers get their PTSD from normalize IDs and then transit tasks from

Matthias Miller  1:17:13
Okay, so let's try that. So now actually, we're gonna go back here and we're going to delete it. A little stinker.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22
That'd be just in first.

Matthias Miller  1:17:26
Mainly make it hard to break things. Okay, so now let's try and still gone. Okay, well, that's a small driven perfect now I guess it's just Okay, nevermind that's that's fine. Okay, so then this one let me get I am losing myself. Let's Yeah, let's let's receive payments is going these guys these guys go to to ask diagnostics to keep sales where sales are okay. So actually, we don't even need this way anymore. Probably don't. Okay, so this guy new house. We said it was invoice we said shouldn't be let's see why it was invoiced.

Speaker 3  1:18:29
As is because it's New York and we we set those to the lower as

Matthias Miller  1:18:34
if all has has no transit tasks.

Speaker 1  1:18:38
Yes. Because yeah, this is one of those ones that this is this is

Speaker 3  1:18:43
what sold before who said it is does from that point for Fletcher

Speaker 1  1:18:47
we've we've just now set it up the fee start actually start receiving transit tests. So this thing doesn't have a transit test of it.

Speaker 3  1:18:59
That shouldn't that should not with our logic we said if it's retail which this one is its retail we're not looking at whether or not as a transparent retail we're just saying

Unknown Speaker  1:19:15
event spilled on site are looking for a delivery date. Yeah. And this one shouldn't have a delivery date.

Speaker 3  1:19:24
Like that, that this is exactly why we did what we did here. So that's not dependent on on transit test.

Speaker 3  1:19:40
This one is not it's not built on site, and it has the vulnerability. Right.

Matthias Miller  1:19:47
This is or is it something No, no, I mean, this is showing FTI this one. This one was invoice we're seeing it shouldn't be shouldn't have been.

Speaker 1  1:19:57
So it's working correctly because we're waiting on two Every day.

Matthias Miller  1:20:03
Same with, same with all of these, although

Unknown Speaker  1:20:06
most of them, let's go back to the bottom is the detail screen. What is the detail screen down your report? There's this guy. What does that mean? What is the answer

Matthias Miller  1:20:17
to building off? Now it's a lot building. And so we said it should be invoiced. And now we're saying no, it shouldn't because but

Speaker 1  1:20:26
it's canceled was cancelled account for canceled sales orders.

Matthias Miller  1:20:29
Right. So

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33
so we have one of the

Unknown Speaker  1:20:34
first we're not accounting for cancel sales orders in here.

Matthias Miller  1:20:38
Why did we not handle

Unknown Speaker  1:20:42
you have first

Matthias Miller  1:20:43
Oh, it got invoice before it was cancelled.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:50
Gotcha.

Matthias Miller  1:20:57
So we're not going to invoice it, I guess.

Speaker 1  1:21:02
Yeah, but as I was just saying in your diagnostic report, just account for canceled invoices. In here, let's do this

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
Yes, that makes it abundantly a bit.

Matthias Miller  1:21:41
Okay, so this one, is this the same as the one that we looked at previously?

Speaker 3  1:21:51
We don't deliver by default on the sales order. So do we.

Matthias Miller  1:21:57
I mean, this is probably 11 Seven, you changed it. Five days after? Yeah. Yeah. Same thing. Okay, here's an SDI building. We're saying she'll be Matthias

Speaker 1  1:22:13
Shouldn't we, it's on situations like that where we then voice but there shouldn't be an invoice. It shouldn't be striped that invoice date from that sales order. So it comes back up again. It's

Speaker 4  1:22:30
all out there. Okay. So you're saying here we have one that was invoice by mistake.

Speaker 3  1:22:36
And so it's going to go into an AR you're going to try and select only when you try to collect them use it? Oh, hang on.

Speaker 1  1:22:42
I mean, it's an outlier situation. So so the only thing is like, it won't ever match your logic, like your dates that you normally would stop in for an invoice date to match up with like the delivery date and so forth. They're going to be in a misalignment if we don't care we don't care if you want to have this thing go back through the cycle them on invoice

Matthias Miller  1:23:00
you you can't clear the cancellation. I mean, you can't clear the invoice date because then we're going to delete the original transaction. I mean, if you expense it out Don't you still need to you don't want to undo that accounting transaction? Or do you? You do

Speaker 3  1:23:22
I think we should leave it for now and look at it sometimes

Speaker 1  1:23:27
as well. But FYI, Matthias then you should make where so invoice eights can't be edited from an editable report either.

Matthias Miller  1:23:38
Well, we have we have things written up to lock it down that you can't edit it past a closing period which is really what we care about. But that's that's a January thing.

Speaker 3  1:23:53
I think what you're saying is on invoicing sampling is pretty major like you have a whole bunch of the whole trail of transactions that need to be

Speaker 3  1:24:09
the s guyger Once I know what those are those are just in the environment One example would be that I agree

Matthias Miller  1:24:19
let's do this we can also do in storage units are not

Speaker 1  1:24:21
coming up they're coming pose invoice date and they should not come up first and

Unknown Speaker  1:24:29
by the way, they act the old date and there's but they have

Speaker 1  1:24:32
no can be cleared out the invoice date last night, but they're they're still proposing an invoice date and they shouldn't have asked me an invoice date. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:24:41
Do we want to take a little bit more time to keep plugging through this

Unknown Speaker  1:24:47
mean book a different time to plug through this?

Matthias Miller  1:24:49
I mean, what I'm saying is Ben and I can keep going here. We just need to communicate. If we do I don't mind that I would probably that we just need to communicate if we if you guys aren't wanting to drop at the top of the hour

Speaker 1  1:25:09
in other words we're up against our 11 o'clock to do and just keep going or or except go on to something else.

Speaker 3  1:25:15
I think we're this close I think we should just keep yeah I'm

Matthias Miller  1:25:19
fine with that. This is because it's not a district X building and it has a final delivery date

Speaker 3  1:25:29
is this an STI with all the other ones that I've seen the alignment points out all right, well, I haven't both in a

Matthias Miller  1:25:42
quick thing Ben. Tim and Austin are both out you want to let her know that we're just going to cancel okay. Thanks or cancel I mean yeah, cancel the TV

Matthias Miller  1:26:01
and I'm gonna say this back let's do this too. This will make our lives easier building by all delivery day delivery date okay. So in here

Matthias Miller  1:26:23
these were Walmart delivered on the 27th which is why they have the proposed

Unknown Speaker  1:26:28
Yeah, that's for

Matthias Miller  1:26:31
now this one Hartville outdoor this looks like another one that we change the automatic

Unknown Speaker  1:26:44
no

Matthias Miller  1:26:46
is built here why did we wholesale building no trains

Matthias Miller  1:27:05
let's see what we did earlier. This canine you because it's district X. And it didn't have any transit types. That's why we

Matthias Miller  1:27:37
the building has the building has a building is a lot more

Unknown Speaker  1:27:46
should account for levels.

Matthias Miller  1:27:51
I mean, which which transit types matter?

Speaker 3  1:27:55
Well, okay, this this this should have been said. This should have been said in the end, it can be delivered to the end customer. Like in this case, it should have been delivered. It should have been in transit test should have the patient going to. If you'd have the customer location, you had

Speaker 1  1:28:18
the customer go back to the transit tasks done. Let's open that up. Oh, no, this is this is an affordable barn. Hmp, it's still it should still sit in finished goods inventory.

Speaker 3  1:28:35
All this is one of those automation buildings where they Yes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:28:40
So our logic is correct in this in this case, but

Speaker 1  1:28:45
Well, technically not because he say, how are we handling this? For Barney to pee? They shouldn't technically have a sales order attached. They should be locked limits.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:00
Let me see the sales order on it. Yeah, well, okay. Now scroll back up to the top. This is an HLP whole mean

Speaker 1  1:29:15
16 D, which is really confusing. So normally we do end up 16 D, it's just because they're doing a nhrp Pauling.

Speaker 3  1:29:26
I'm confused, but this was paid for the what's the balance on zero? So it's paid for building it? Or how do we know it was It wasn't just a regular building for hardware? How do we know that it was an eight an ADC. But what what showed you that?

Speaker 1  1:29:46
Well, the training test says it has a lot more to it. So let's go go.

Matthias Miller  1:29:54
Can I see why it's not getting invoiced? In this case? It's because it's wholesale.

Matthias Miller  1:30:05
We're using the final delivery gate. And

Speaker 1  1:30:07
it was never found delivery date, because it never generated a transit task and then never left the study delivered it. Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:18
It wasn't transit test for

Speaker 1  1:30:20
the law taking it down to when they visit when it was an ADC bill.

Speaker 3  1:30:24
Yeah, that was it. Was this bill for a customer? If it is for you know, it

Speaker 1  1:30:27
was it was it was sold by HP? Off of the labs?

Speaker 3  1:30:32
Yeah, sure. 111. Affordable, build it and deliver HP. HP said we want to put this building on our lot, and we'll pay for it. Right? Yeah. So then I think that's been to the customer? Like HLP?

Speaker 1  1:30:51
No, no, it was originally the long haul for it was one of those where ABC held the inventory for HIV. That's what the original then they sold. Because they're a wholesale dealer. It never generated transit class. Got

Speaker 3  1:31:06
it? And had it been where they are a lot going and getting PVC delivered to them, then the end does that

Speaker 1  1:31:16
it wouldn't be possible. But in this case, this is kind of unique, because how does HMP let us know that whatever, like it looks like they delivered the building or we did we did an HLP hauling separately for it.

Speaker 3  1:31:32
So two ways to screw up in. So a transit test, reading on the transit test, from the GOP lock to if we get the hall would have done to the customer would

Speaker 1  1:31:47
would generate a chance to last? Well, not necessarily because they've been doing some of that a little bit. Because he doesn't like it when they asked us to haul like, say, for example, that building when they asked us to haul it, they don't always tell us which film it is they just say we got building in 16. D, we need a hall. And we don't always we don't have a way to cross reference that against one of our buildings.

Speaker 3  1:32:11
How many? How do we know the index? So that's that? How do we know when it was delivered? That's a process issue. And ABC said, Yeah, we need to know. And it's only It's only for that small handful of buildings that we that agent that ABC sold HLP are put on there on commission

Speaker 3  1:32:42
is it worth with this self correct itself? So we get a payment for this building? Was it well, it's not well,

Speaker 1  1:32:49
it's paid this is this is the only part I don't know quite what to do with it. We have a paid for building that doesn't have a transit task and it's not been filed delivered. We automatically know it's the liver gets paid for it's like on a situation like this. It's a wholesale dealer. We've been paid for it. So 100% we know it's deliver.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:09
And it's but it's still in finished goods inventory as

Speaker 1  1:33:11
we still in finished goods inventory and it still hasn't been invoiced.

Speaker 3  1:33:17
I think this was I feel like this would self correct itself, that we probably shouldn't do any development like. So.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:24
We just it's a it's a process. But we had to figure out what would

Unknown Speaker  1:33:27
have happened. What could happen in the new system

Speaker 3  1:33:29
is Garrison's in a check for this billing. We say never invoice is never delivered. He says, Oh yeah, here's what happened. And you say, Oh, well, thank you very much next time, let us know.

Speaker 1  1:33:42
Well, that's a good point. Because if we're going to run collections that way, then I need to account for buildings that are deliberate or not. It would be it's gonna have to be like a checkoff part of the process to pay attention and stuff like that but

Unknown Speaker  1:33:54
do you feel like we need to

Speaker 1  1:33:56
I don't know that we need to development for I just don't know. It's h2o AgRP house of stars is kind of somewhat the same way where there are situations where it's hard to tell when that they don't always let us know when they picked up building. But we received payment for it.

Speaker 3  1:34:17
Well for houses Doris like if they pick up the building. We're invoicing today apples field so

Matthias Miller  1:34:26
if we're gonna take a quick break while you guys talk us through, I'll be right back.

Speaker 1  1:34:29
Not anymore that they will be a wholesale deal on that transit stops even waiting on final delivery date.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:36
That's only a read on also we're still

Speaker 1  1:34:39
they are retail, their district X building. Also start? No,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:44
they're not. They're housing starters as wholesale.

Speaker 1  1:34:46
Right. But on the wholesale side, we're still waiting on delivery date. Not know

Speaker 3  1:34:51
on the wholesale side. I believe we're seeing if there's a transit Taz, we're seeing on the whole if it's wholesale, use the The after bill unless there's a transit task attached and then use. But let's look at at it for sure. But it shouldn't be like that. So

Unknown Speaker  1:35:15
my head hurts on this. All we

Speaker 1  1:35:20
make we make too many, too many. We branch our processes too much. And then we wonder why we have to account for the

Unknown Speaker  1:35:31
downside is, you could say, well, we don't do this, we go through this because this makes a massive account. So no.

Speaker 1  1:35:43
We don't want to sell you. Yeah, well, yes and no. So I think a lot of times what happens inside of companies, their software makes them do certain things and suddenly find ways to align with the software. And here we make our software do the things that we do. Right, just the other way around.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:05
That way, I'm gonna have to record it. So

Unknown Speaker  1:36:12
we make our we make our own messes.

Speaker 3  1:36:17
But there is a lot truth to that left, as I look at the whole accounts payable process, that's a big process now it would be easy to look at it so bad. That's, that's a lot. She has to get an invoice paid? Well, it is but you know, he figured out a better way to make sure that you're seeing product that it gets, you know that it ends up in the correct place and your financial reports and all of those things. There really is a reason why every step needs to have and so definitely bring up

Speaker 1  1:36:55
your bring up your macro that that's I don't know it's the one we've been hacking away on. Market I'm disagreeing on the logic. So in regards to wholesale

Matthias Miller  1:37:17
Do you want to distinguish between the kinds of transit type that it has, for example, you might have a lot building with a lot. Well, I don't know about a wholesale but do you want to distinguish between a delivery slash like delivery transit versus just any transit task?

Speaker 1  1:37:45
Delivery is the delivery train test is the only one well delivery transit test with for customers the only one that actually will assign a delivery date or building final delivery date

Speaker 3  1:37:57
on wholesale. That is correct, though, that that follows well is it not? Like we're seeing in this district case

Speaker 3  1:38:12
if the district takes wholesale if it has more transit that they have to build if it has no transit test authorizing us delivery date. Yeah, you're right

Speaker 1  1:38:33
but we really so what you're saying with that is is we should define it has no transit tap but what type of transit test should it not have? So it doesn't have it doesn't have a delivery transit test and it should stay with the logic.

Matthias Miller  1:38:48
Yeah, I'm wondering if this is like if not in me mean this doesn't tell you whether it's a final delivery it just says whether it's do we need to distinguish between final delivery versus delivery

Speaker 3  1:39:05
distinguishes final delivery is that based on

Speaker 1  1:39:08
the building found delivery date is the well what dictates is upon delivery is the to customer checkbox on the transit test

Unknown Speaker  1:39:23
do you want a refund for the customer as well or no?

Matthias Miller  1:39:31
Yes, give me your mark. Yes. Okay. Yes is my answer no, is my answer both either. I have a lot of qualifications answering that question is that one of them?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:47
Well played

Unknown Speaker  1:39:50
quarters refining it for edge cases by

Speaker 1  1:39:54
by further fine stick with the delivery of it. We may have to refine these things more or at some point.

Matthias Miller  1:40:02
Okay, so here we go see what changes now?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:12
So what can you change?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:13
We find for a certain type of changes.

Matthias Miller  1:40:18
But I mean, these are still Wait, which one are we looking at?

Unknown Speaker  1:40:23
They would have no chance to test so we're good.

Matthias Miller  1:40:27
So these guys dropped off now, right? Yeah, those dropped off. Because we good. Okay. So so now we have SDI buildings that were delivered. And they should be invoiced? That's correct. Right. Hartville outdoor was built. It wasn't invoiced before. But we are saying it should be now, because now we're seeing the transit tasks of the building. No, it's a lot Hall. Why are we saying because it doesn't have a customer delivery date. So we're saying was it built we'll do the day after build. So which would be 415, which is when it's getting delivered?

Unknown Speaker  1:41:14
Because that's essentially is having no transit test. Because we're finding delivery Track Changes test.

Matthias Miller  1:41:22
Okay, so then we have this guy who was never built, does not have a delivery date, but was invoiced probably because he was canceled. No, he wasn't canceled. We don't know what happened.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:34
Indeed, we don't but it's fully paid for.

Matthias Miller  1:41:39
I love what's not like not that.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:45
You said the building's not built.

Matthias Miller  1:41:48
There's delivery notes in the next section.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:51
It's a dead building.

Matthias Miller  1:41:53
It's a dead building. The building does not exist. What normal somebody went and deleted a building. Or somebody had a typo. Let's see if they had a typo. Buildings. Let's see standard building stand down instead of interesting.

Matthias Miller  1:42:26
This is what it was created. Let's do this. This was created on February the second. This would be for the building. And let's look and see we've been looking buildings

Unknown Speaker  1:42:48
with pets here.

Matthias Miller  1:42:52
And let's actually see

Matthias Miller  1:43:01
let's try this tool. Actually. I think we can find the billing. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:43:12
it was an old value. There wasn't a new value

Matthias Miller  1:43:19
it was the activity history would be maybe I don't know. Let's do this now. Let me actually not convinced about the old value but modified field building

Speaker 1  1:43:35
activity. Oh, yes. So got through

Matthias Miller  1:43:38
it way back in the past. Our building was actually substantially older than sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:43:43
is blank for today. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:43:50
We're returning the future. Yeah. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:44:05
Whale here while that thing's cranking, we're also going to send

Unknown Speaker  1:44:11
through 3 million records.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:16
You can do it not leaving you.

Matthias Miller  1:44:24
Okay, well, this one has an interesting story. And then we're getting back into February. I don't think we really care that much, but maybe we do. Well,

Speaker 1  1:44:35
no, because the only thing on this is the easy way storage should not have a proposed invoice date. No,

Matthias Miller  1:44:41
it should not. They should not. Oh, well. Let's find out why they do. What's the problem buddy? Alright, so to savan bye bye. Boom. Okay, so it's a wholesale building.

Speaker 1  1:44:59
yeah and oh it has no transit task it's going to show up for delivery

Matthias Miller  1:45:09
because it's well

Matthias Miller  1:45:16
I mean is this one where it would but it has a has a customer one here too easy way storage but not a final delivery

Matthias Miller  1:45:38
So is this an old building issue or is this another oops,

Speaker 1  1:45:41
well this these easy way storage are where this whole originally this conversation started from is accounting for these guys. Because they should say all finished goods inventory and not be invoiced.

Matthias Miller  1:45:54
But is this just because Are we sure that's not just because it's marked wholesale when it shouldn't be?

Unknown Speaker  1:46:03
Why it is

Speaker 1  1:46:07
good click open up easy way storage their their contact record are they wholesale see they're not these were from a long time ago and need to be unselected as wholesale

Unknown Speaker  1:46:18
so easy way that's why only dominating we have three four well sort sort of dealers we can see how many there are

Unknown Speaker  1:46:27
and then wandering it other 83

Speaker 1  1:46:32
Yeah 83 And they probably all are marked as wholesale but the dealer is not wholesale anymore I need to fix those up go fix those.

Matthias Miller  1:46:45
Your let me I should probably drop off here I got some things to chase after I can I will email you this or message you this report Dwayne

Unknown Speaker  1:46:55
I can find you i 15 days

Matthias Miller  1:47:02
finding yourself that's the process and how about do we want to talk again at three

Unknown Speaker  1:47:17
I think we should try and wrap this up or anything

Matthias Miller  1:47:28
okay, let me All right, some of this stuff. If we're talking again at three and we're digging through this stuff, I'm gonna get through some of the deposit speedups until Monday, but happy to we'll see. I might might not happy to spend my time doing whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:55
Good. Thank you,

Matthias Miller  1:47:56
Pip. Thanks.
