Speaker 1  00:39
So before I even go why is I simply the walkthrough

Unknown Speaker  00:43
howdy howdy howdy. Hey

Unknown Speaker  00:46
I cannot hear you.

Matthias Miller  00:47
I don't know show y'all water I

Speaker 2  00:50
cannot hear you. Stop it you want to see

Unknown Speaker  01:01
can't wait to start doing that

Unknown Speaker  01:04
well just because I didn't get it off at this point and I don't have a lot

Speaker 3  01:08
I mean but I can put it off a little bit more

Speaker 4  01:18
well all my settings look right in the thigh so I'm blaming you then must be me

Unknown Speaker  01:41
ai ai says a loose connection

Unknown Speaker  01:52
going

Unknown Speaker  01:59
oh my goodness.

Matthias Miller  02:02
Try now. Hey, about that do not still no. still know nothing else in

Unknown Speaker  02:23
them check all of them house. Steve actually did a mistake.

Unknown Speaker  02:31
All right, I can hear you now.

Matthias Miller  02:32
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:33
I don't know what the deal was one of those kinds of days

Unknown Speaker  02:39
Saturday. What is this?

Matthias Miller  02:44
Well, you know, at least you didn't go screw a whole bunch of sales order records.

Unknown Speaker  02:47
What did you do?

Matthias Miller  02:50
I was trying to make Drew's changes. And somehow something went sideways and updated a whole bunch of payment amounts, sales of historical sales orders. So it was less than ideal.

Unknown Speaker  03:02
But I could write a whole paragraph of explanation on what

Speaker 4  03:08
I might do one thing here. I'm tempted to drop off Mark unicorn on this side.

Unknown Speaker  03:12
Sure. Are we going to end with that? You know?

Speaker 4  03:21
Thanks. Is it gonna fuck you by turn my video off? Because like, I looked stupid looking to the side. Or you're gonna share your screen anyway. So yeah.

Matthias Miller  03:33
All right. I don't know what we're doing this.

Unknown Speaker  03:37
Are we going to go back and clean up?

Matthias Miller  03:39
I think we should. Yeah, I think that

Unknown Speaker  03:43
that we had that. Yeah.

Speaker 1  03:47
First you change the SalesLoft shooter. You can't change

Matthias Miller  03:56
brung diagnostics online,

Unknown Speaker  03:58
then you go and

Matthias Miller  04:01
then you can go back to those diagnostic, that's no phase there.

Speaker 5  04:05
No push comes to shove and just go back and signal and be able to like, screenshots that you then you know, instead of be too easy. So you're gonna understand

Unknown Speaker  04:19
what the process is that we're doing

Speaker 6  04:21
and the chocolate Hazel and kind of get your hands together, and you see what we're right and then work through a sample.

Speaker 4  04:28
So I made a small change to what you did, I took out just Ohio and we did it by all districts in the group in my district. Because Ohio was just one offender and now we've got a whole bunch more probably.

Matthias Miller  04:41
We want to

Unknown Speaker  04:44
filter by district. All right.

Matthias Miller  04:48
We're cut off after a certain timeframe. I guess it's not that big. Nevermind. Let's go. Where do you wanna start? You just wanna start at the top. You guys are gonna hop over If we can ignore zero balance

Matthias Miller  05:10
so balance we ignore sales orders without actually no warning

Unknown Speaker  05:19
and

Matthias Miller  05:28
really ignore sales orders that don't have a balance or a subtotal that over the habit

Unknown Speaker  05:40
looks kind of silly but anyway we get rid of that top one

Matthias Miller  05:46
Alright, so

Unknown Speaker  05:47
right now like

Matthias Miller  05:49
company

Matthias Miller  05:56
no building today this miscellaneous items used to think it should be invoiced now we do

Unknown Speaker  06:07
because we're good

Matthias Miller  06:15
but why why is why is the old anyway it's good to understand why the old one didn't try to invoice it but

Speaker 4  06:20
like Do you have a post invoice date for support so you should be good right? Yeah, it was great.

Speaker 3  06:26
It was a miscellaneous order that was raining today.

Matthias Miller  06:31
See what he is but

Unknown Speaker  06:39
Oh, RJ

Matthias Miller  06:40
nevermind I'm comparing invoice sorry nevermind forget anything Yep, that's right. This one built delivered. Okay,

Speaker 3  06:50
no, those all of those jets the right ones are okay. Now are you saying the first one is was miscellaneous sales order that was just created today? Yeah. Good

Matthias Miller  07:04
shirts to go.

Speaker 4  07:08
We already looked at this one this one is that situation would what was the deal? It was speeding we will be waiting on transit delivery date for this is that right

Matthias Miller  07:28
I mean do you need me to look at so this one had no transit tasks here. No transit tasks here and the delivery date sitting unfinished.

Speaker 4  07:42
It was not marked as it was originally not set up as little by default.

Unknown Speaker  07:49
Or that default? Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 4  07:52
there we go. The Shed Haven one would be exactly the same Can you double check that shed Haven is actually marked as delivered by default now? Yeah, so that those would be the in the same population? So I guess once they show up with a delivery date then we would invoice them is that

Matthias Miller  08:17
I mean these have already been we're saying they shouldn't be Oh do we want to invoice them?

Unknown Speaker  08:34
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:34
I think so too.

Unknown Speaker  08:41
So all of those Pennsylvania

Speaker 4  08:43
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay, that next fax batch of sheds to go Statesville Yeah, let's let's have a look. Let's look at one of those I'm pretty sure Okay, so it not even think about this when I did this open one of those up. I want to see the transit test assigned on the building

Speaker 7  09:09
and he didn't sell that really

Speaker 3  09:17
so so we would need to those books. We need to argue those because they veered off if they've been right

Unknown Speaker  09:31
and not really been delivered yet.

Matthias Miller  09:36
Okay, well, let me know which ones you want to do all of these come on. Oh, come on. You're you're not you're not doing that.

Unknown Speaker  09:51
Now you know you're

Matthias Miller  10:00
Now you can do whatever you want do all of these combined states Yeah.

Speaker 4  10:08
If they don't have a delivery date and you don't have so I guess it's gonna be incumbent on me to go and figure out if these things are delivered or not

Unknown Speaker  10:39
all right, 123 man out come on you're being cantankerous Why do you not like me see so the boys

Unknown Speaker  11:04
don't like it when

Unknown Speaker  11:16
it's not at all handy to streamline

Matthias Miller  11:26
I'm so confused. Oh, there's a Oh, it's not editable in limited mode. These are completed

Speaker 4  11:37
well, okay, so if they're completed, so, okay,

Matthias Miller  11:41
here if

Unknown Speaker  11:44
they're completed does that mean funds have been received?

Unknown Speaker  11:46
Yeah. Which one is

Matthias Miller  11:51
going to make sure that's the case? Yeah. Complete complete, complete, complete complete. These are all complete.

Speaker 4  12:01
So that goes stop at a delivery date for the date that the last payment was

Unknown Speaker  12:06
or I can

Unknown Speaker  12:07
well can we just stop in invoice date?

Speaker 4  12:12
You could put as delivery date. Yeah, you could we could stop an invoice date of delivery date and

Unknown Speaker  12:18
delivery clicky clicky paste.

Unknown Speaker  12:22
Well, you can see why that is.

Matthias Miller  12:30
I love copying and pasting it's my favorite thing. This morning I was like if I could copy and paste dates from a sales order to a building I would be happy

Unknown Speaker  12:41
and I got my wish. Okay

Unknown Speaker  12:52
all right. Now let's see what it says.

Matthias Miller  12:56
Like now and that won't get cleared through Josh's nightly thingy one nightly thing that sets delivery dates since it was transit test, I guess it doesn't have to end the test so there's a

Speaker 3  13:16
test sake but do we need to do the same thing for the shed Haven and Ciesielski so if they're paid for

Unknown Speaker  13:21
I don't know if they're paid for

Unknown Speaker  13:22
let's go

Speaker 2  13:27
it's probably paid for what what is it that you clicked on before? That's a critical thing. Now

Matthias Miller  13:37
not complete this one's complete not complete not complete. Let's do a

Speaker 4  13:48
like are they paid for like is there a bureau balance?

Matthias Miller  13:54
Well I don't know Let's Do This You

Matthias Miller  14:08
only know

Unknown Speaker  14:12
now

Matthias Miller  14:15
here's one

Unknown Speaker  14:17
well that's not one of the ones we want to do.

Matthias Miller  14:22
But it's complete.

Unknown Speaker  14:24
What's the story on him?

Unknown Speaker  14:27
Okay, so let me see the belly

Matthias Miller  14:30
building rendered trains the past we have a delivery or retrieval and then another delivery

Unknown Speaker  14:43
go back to the building

Unknown Speaker  14:51
go back to the trailer task of telling them that in a team was applied in modification history, budget was

Unknown Speaker  15:02
no it's been there well why didn't it update? Well

Matthias Miller  15:14
you want me to go hunt that down? Are you setting you should go as trash?

Speaker 4  15:17
No, that's a sentence been obligated

Unknown Speaker  15:25
let me also do this guy

Speaker 7  15:36
okay, so you're looking at that one we looked at this guy. This guy got canceled

Matthias Miller  15:46
this one we're saying should be invoiced now

Matthias Miller  15:55
right

Speaker 2  16:02
it's very Yadkinville Oh Is it complete now it's not complete

Unknown Speaker  16:07
this is nice. Ah it's not that they're

Matthias Miller  16:11
also building without trying to test

Unknown Speaker  16:17
I mean, I guess this is um

Speaker 4  16:21
this is like well it's not Oh, it is sorry. Is this is a headset this is this is an SDI one. So whatever the logic should be pronounced the eyes are proposed invoice date for Yeah, so 1130 which was yesterday when that be that will be up for invoicing today right yeah,

Speaker 7  16:51
this one Yeah. Delivery data yesterday. Boom. Yeah, that's right. Well, this

Unknown Speaker  16:59
let me see the sound structures one

Unknown Speaker  17:02
Why didn't that one get invoiced?

Matthias Miller  17:09
I haven't 23 delivery day but let's see what

Matthias Miller  17:20
this one one and two that we were supposed to get invoiced? both old and new believe it should be it just hasn't yet. And I assume it's been sitting on

Unknown Speaker  17:33
somewhere for a while

Speaker 2  17:39
see if Mark was like Sam structures. Why it just wasn't released? I think it was

Speaker 3  17:49
released. Oh, it's right. For them are dissolved and I was running behind preparing for people who know. Yeah. But all of those 11.3 11 points after I'm 30 SDI numbers up ignore those are all legit just haven't been invoiced. So

Unknown Speaker  18:15
why do you have a mount of buildings? Why do we have a lot of buildings?

Unknown Speaker  18:20
No sorry for that.

Matthias Miller  18:25
Okay, 20 they didn't have any of them? I

Unknown Speaker  18:31
think so. Okay, well, hey,

Unknown Speaker  18:34
I'm not going to complain.

Matthias Miller  18:37
Have any fancy fancy sound engineering stick going? That's why it's

Unknown Speaker  18:42
okay, so.

Unknown Speaker  18:46
Oh, man.

Unknown Speaker  18:48
Okay, so that takes that taster all in North Carolina.

Unknown Speaker  18:51
But what these three These are those

Matthias Miller  18:59
building attached or something buildings

Speaker 3  19:08
once this disconnect, but this is an SDR is enough. Let's

Speaker 4  19:14
take a look at modification history how this thing came about? Who should we blame?

Unknown Speaker  19:25
Oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  19:31
great, because it was

Speaker 2  19:33
reconciled. And the idea was to get who might have been in my district tax.

Matthias Miller  19:41
Josh, when from five 621. Should we unmarked district X

Speaker 4  19:56
series back into conversions as prepped for that that goes way beyond It goes way back before we split sales orders and billing records and these things are sitting on finished goods inventory

Unknown Speaker  20:12
so this attachment is exempt or

Unknown Speaker  20:14
no

Unknown Speaker  20:18
are there you see a lot of

Speaker 4  20:20
district X they're not invoice you know the water well they are building I don't know they're like some some No Name record

Matthias Miller  20:34
I mean it's not a good big phone reconciliation send me sending that's why we don't have a whole lot of information about him

Speaker 3  20:42
well, we're gonna do an audit starting yesterday so just keep in mind that we themselves out there you will see

Speaker 4  20:52
Matthias go to go to the building record. Go to the More button I'd like to know where they came from because

Unknown Speaker  21:03
they've never been through one of my audits before.

Matthias Miller  21:08
Here's the WoW

Unknown Speaker  21:14
R s would be 609

Matthias Miller  21:20
but this is clearly not a lot built. I mean, well, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:25
Do we have a build on it?

Unknown Speaker  21:27
Is there a builder Nope.

Speaker 3  21:31
Is that Yeah, yep.

Matthias Miller  21:38
I mean, it appears to me like the right thing is to check the district X box

Unknown Speaker  21:45
but don't know what other implications are of doing that

Unknown Speaker  21:52
the object that we're talking has that word

Matthias Miller  21:58
Yeah, like if we were to do that then it looks like the seals were opening so if we do that then that so well, it's the wrong one I think what it should do is do an older you'd have to invoice it all the way back in 20 Whenever no it drops it off

Unknown Speaker  22:30
was this moved at all and so did that put it back on finishes

Matthias Miller  22:39
well I mean it always it always has been true

Speaker 3  22:45
agree just on tech history decks and we'll deal with the cleanup at some point

Speaker 7  22:56
oops this guy went ahead it so this guy comes up district x as well let's just check this out make 100% Certain but I mean, there you go. SDI building and oops Hillary I don't know what that again kind of myself of inevitability

Unknown Speaker  23:19
about Bill today it's never been

Unknown Speaker  23:23
easy we just leave him gone.

Speaker 2  23:27
I would I would be interested in checking and searching those names

Unknown Speaker  23:37
that's for you.

Matthias Miller  23:40
Do you want links to these?

Unknown Speaker  23:41
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  23:44
Oh, good. Cheese.

Unknown Speaker  23:47
Cheese, cheese.

Matthias Miller  23:52
Okay, there's that one

Unknown Speaker  23:57
there's that one in there there's that one. Okay, and then so that takes them off of these this list which gets us through Ohio

Matthias Miller  24:18
we have New York. And those look okay, that's an 1123 one of your 1123 hours good good.

Speaker 3  24:25
Those two are legit that one's legit. Know that that person new house notice we're

Matthias Miller  24:31
out. Those are rants. Yeah. That's yeah. Which they got sold yesterday they should be on your invoicing report. Yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  24:48
the way to a P we got

Matthias Miller  24:52
this was built yesterday. Built today. So I'm assuming those are good. This got canceled.

Speaker 3  24:59
Why does the second one have a delivery date? The first one now let's compare there's one integrated test and the other not that they show

Matthias Miller  25:10
release one has a

Unknown Speaker  25:14
build on site I think this one's on site

Matthias Miller  25:21
this one's the same

Unknown Speaker  25:27
But why have 138 the other

Unknown Speaker  25:32
which one doesn't the first one doesn't have a delivery date

Unknown Speaker  25:48
I don't know.

Speaker 3  25:53
I think Nate manually entered the delivery date on it and on the other is that what

Matthias Miller  26:04
I mean, he did manually intrude on the 111 22

Speaker 7  26:05
days apart.

Matthias Miller  26:13
Why would he have

Unknown Speaker  26:21
I don't know.

Speaker 3  26:23
It probably was not communicated to him yet. But the way we're handling it now. It's It's good. It makes sense.

Matthias Miller  26:35
So somebody just needs to let him know that it's been built in he just hasn't seen it yet. Yeah. Okay. Um, these guys are also pretty recent builds. They were saying they shouldn't be invoiced though

Speaker 3  26:54
because the trend the transit task is not fulfilled

Matthias Miller  27:03
there are no train to test for this

Speaker 3  27:08
was the sales are great it was it before we set those people

Matthias Miller  27:14
this is one of those yeah

Unknown Speaker  27:19
that's why can we can we set this to

Matthias Miller  27:25
shoot call so please know that

Unknown Speaker  27:27
wholesale thing is set the delivery default we are what is called

Matthias Miller  27:36
when the other one is delivered deliberately buildings by default it was these sales orders got created before before that, which is why they don't have transit tests.

Speaker 3  27:46
But because the condition that we created now, the extra rule we created, it's fine without so that's all good. Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  28:00
Okay, so, you're fine with having these be invoiced even if we think they shouldn't be invoiced.

Unknown Speaker  28:10
Now, say that again,

Matthias Miller  28:11
these are invoiced even though based on our new logic we say they are not ready

Unknown Speaker  28:24
okay

Speaker 3  28:28
sure should weigh in the details on that so this one these were created before we said that people

Unknown Speaker  28:38
built in booty one are they paid for

Unknown Speaker  28:43
no

Speaker 3  28:49
so we should technically we should add invoice those apply at transit test save

Speaker 4  29:00
but why are they paid for that was October

Unknown Speaker  29:07
in November wow

Unknown Speaker  29:12
these these

Unknown Speaker  29:13
ones from Dickinson Okay, that'll be exact but I would say that would pay for us you use that the invoice date

Unknown Speaker  29:31
but they are engrossed.

Unknown Speaker  29:34
You're saying enter delivery date, right?

Speaker 4  29:36
Yeah, enter enter the delivery date as the invoice date. But the one that's not paid for don't let's not do that.

Matthias Miller  29:45
Oh, just right. We're looking on this guy. invoice date here. Pay for boom, take them off the list, because he's good. But these guys We don't think should be

Speaker 4  30:06
input send send those to me now apply three to 10 s which means they'll show up for Jr node to figure out what's going on with them

Unknown Speaker  30:17
on invoice that

Unknown Speaker  30:20
probably should give a shot that I thought you were struggling with. Okay,

Matthias Miller  30:28
there you go. They're not complete that's why we can ah

Unknown Speaker  30:30
right right right.

Matthias Miller  30:34
Okay, well that was fun. Okay, here's a

Unknown Speaker  30:37
balance good does the next three or

Matthias Miller  30:45
zero balance isn't never never invoice we think it should be

Speaker 3  30:57
we had a cookie Lauer's that it paid for we showed it before

Unknown Speaker  31:05
pay for I mean

Matthias Miller  31:17
anyway, it's probably something related to it's a lot Hall which the old logic used to think that that would mean that we'd have to wait for transit tasks complete as I would have meant and now we're saying they are and it wasn't actually delivered. We should notice Oh, yeah, that's the that is the issue. This thing is paid for but has no delivery date.

Unknown Speaker  31:55
So you just add your delivery date same as the invoice date

Matthias Miller  32:00
you're just doing the

Speaker 7  32:03
build date. We're gonna have an invoice date. Sir.

Unknown Speaker  32:12
Okay What is this

Unknown Speaker  32:25
this one we said

Matthias Miller  32:28
is not ready to be invoiced because well the building doesn't exist. This is that one

Unknown Speaker  32:36
site prep ramps but it looks like it hasn't been paid.

Unknown Speaker  32:42
Yeah, is there a balance

Unknown Speaker  32:45
there's a there's a shed

Matthias Miller  32:48
on the sales order. Yeah, but the state isn't valid

Speaker 7  32:58
Oh, I know what it is from here hang on this is going to be great so this was from

Matthias Miller  33:05
this would have been build on sites it would have been the month of February that's why it wasn't pulling anything up I was looking at the at the wrong activity action we don't actually have

Speaker 7  33:21
let's say we find out 22122 22

Unknown Speaker  33:39
Let's do this

Matthias Miller  33:48
okay now we're gonna go

Unknown Speaker  33:51
find

Matthias Miller  33:53
all that we're gonna go fine here delete this thing

Matthias Miller  34:03
who's to blame you can run which can Hi.

Unknown Speaker  34:07
Come on.

Matthias Miller  34:10
Maybe didn't delete it.

Speaker 7  34:13
That that's been one of the much more interesting stories needed. Okay.

Matthias Miller  34:23
steppin see what's wrong with Dustin? If somebody changed the stain on this thing huh

Matthias Miller  34:38
consent is still on the sales order is supposed to be well which is the what is the rights then?

Unknown Speaker  34:47
I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  34:49
Why don't we okay.

Speaker 7  34:55
I wouldn't do is just well, let's do this. Okay, please. In zoning change.

Matthias Miller  35:02
No mean

Unknown Speaker  35:05
how long are stints usually?

Speaker 3  35:07
Well, they aggregate they start with year, year, month month and then they just aggregate from there to start with.

Matthias Miller  35:19
So is it likely then April you build 20,000 sheds? No. I don't think I think this is the only problem

Matthias Miller  35:36
and then if we do that, we actually can pull it up. And you can see here 12 By 24 story. Yeah, you can see right here, there it is. It's just fat fingering. That's all. Okay, so if we refresh then

Speaker 7  36:02
19973 run out and see.

Matthias Miller  36:09
Yeah, it's gone now. Okay, here is a Hartville. One that's paid for.

Unknown Speaker  36:18
Never invoiced

Matthias Miller  36:21
has a delivery date. It wasn't invoiced. We think it should be invoiced as of 415. Which makes sense because that's when it was delivered. Presumably there's something with transit tasks. It was a lot haul. We thought we should wait maybe we already looked at that one. But we thought it was a lot harder for you, but we're waiting for it. We're

Unknown Speaker  36:45
not even sure.

Matthias Miller  36:48
Either way. It is supposed to be invoiced as of that date.

Unknown Speaker  36:53
And it's paid for right yeah,

Speaker 7  36:55
it's zero balance well that guy just use

Unknown Speaker  36:59
the delivery date okay, why why do we have to be honest don't change the delivery

Unknown Speaker  37:09
is completed now

Unknown Speaker  37:11
it is completed we are going

Matthias Miller  37:17
to have to have a way to change invoice dates for completed buildings don't we? I mean, what we can do I guess I guess we could do this. No, we can't.

Speaker 3  37:34
Okay, can you is it in the transit pass you have to change the transit pass the application to customer instead of it

Unknown Speaker  37:47
No.

Matthias Miller  37:49
This is showing the right proposed invoice date. The issue the issue is that we don't we don't allow modifying invoice dates for completed buildings

Speaker 3  38:07
but we have we have we have had a lot of buildings that were never invoice in the past that is do we need to do anything with this

Matthias Miller  38:18
laser show up in your sales orders meeting invoicing? I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  38:25
You're saying it will okay. It will show up there.

Matthias Miller  38:28
Well I'm not sure it's my name

Unknown Speaker  38:47
that's what the seals were ready. Yeah, it will

Matthias Miller  38:59
get a whole bunch of stuff that wants to be invoiced right now. Let me make a note to allow modifying invoicing of this for at least for Karina.

Speaker 7  39:24
Lau editing invoice date and limited mode on buildings. Clean up old dogs so back to here.

Matthias Miller  39:44
So this this is on the meeting invoicing and you can deal with it there. Um

Unknown Speaker  39:53
This one

Matthias Miller  39:58
we print assumably why are we wanting to I'm losing track of this stuff it's an FDA golden when their delivery date why do we want to invoice it

Speaker 3  40:16
for Asia II because this should not be should not be invoiced right it was a horrible feeling sitting on nature a lot okay

Unknown Speaker  40:25
well let's find out why we're so gung ho about that it's not Wholesale is wholesale

Matthias Miller  40:50
it does not have a delivery task that's

Unknown Speaker  40:54
so it appears like no right.

Speaker 2  40:59
But those should the motion limit is the candidate sales are attached and they could be treated like locker rooms but

Unknown Speaker  41:11
why does it have sales of

Unknown Speaker  41:15
Amer created back a while ago

Unknown Speaker  41:19
who just disconnect the sales or

Unknown Speaker  41:27
I would have to go and look at the

Speaker 2  41:30
the OPPO barkham HIV e one tal hodler one and if they if they don't have solar don't have sales orders in that yeah, that can be easily done.

Unknown Speaker  41:42
Okay, I'm sending you both of these doing Merry Christmas

Matthias Miller  41:49
all right here is the zero balance that is showing up on your report because it was the was delivered before it was built

Speaker 4  42:07
Okay, can we see how to put this in that says hold on a sec who put it in building delivered her advice of Jimmy OKAY, let me do the modification history

Unknown Speaker  42:28
MC put it in

Unknown Speaker  42:31
so look for a building built date

Speaker 4  42:39
so it was never built while on earth

Unknown Speaker  42:46
Where's Jimmy?

Unknown Speaker  42:47
He doesn't want to build

Matthias Miller  42:50
the builder it used to plan to wait until Alison took it out

Unknown Speaker  42:57
why did he take it up?

Unknown Speaker  43:02
I know you can't answer that question. So

Speaker 1  43:06
I kind of okay to remember from this one because if they put in their request information and when they send information and asking it to be done is they're attaching to scans and things they send in

Speaker 4  43:19
Addison I doubt it whether it looks like this attachments what's the attachment

Unknown Speaker  43:24
it's what it is

Unknown Speaker  43:30
but there's no email sending out wrong give me or me

Unknown Speaker  43:39
yeah but

Unknown Speaker  43:44
no

Unknown Speaker  43:46
yeah

Speaker 4  43:49
but it was never built there was never sent that was built

Matthias Miller  43:56
I mean, I would hope that if they I'm not sure that's a good business model it's called the air shed

Matthias Miller  44:16
so that's why they blanked off the builder because they wanted to take it off the BPR

Unknown Speaker  44:24
that's exactly what happened

Speaker 4  44:28
how about this just go look with the builder was removed and put that as build date. Right put it put the builder back in

Matthias Miller  44:35
a plant to on 1210 21

Speaker 2  44:39
Is that safe Mark? Yeah, that's what I'd say. But builder back is or word plant.

Matthias Miller  44:50
All right. Well, I was one

Matthias Miller  45:00
renders outdoor structures. Okay, what this one we said we didn't use the thing that should be invoiced but now it should be

Speaker 3  45:09
no This one's good the environment this one just needs to be marked off

Matthias Miller  45:15
all right here's an SDI from 2020 didn't used to be but we think it should be because it's still unfinished goods it's built as transit tasks

Matthias Miller  45:38
we didn't think it used whatever I mean Shouldn't this have a

Unknown Speaker  45:49
wire it's the wholesale thing that's making us

Matthias Miller  45:54
because it's all sale doesn't have delivery therefore we want to invoice it which shouldn't be yes. What's this district x what is the

Matthias Miller  46:11
yeah yeah that's a good question.

Unknown Speaker  46:14
When you said

Speaker 3  46:23
affordable ended up buying back sounds

Unknown Speaker  46:40
said this to you and he'll figure it out.

Unknown Speaker  46:42
What is it

Unknown Speaker  46:42
the slings that I know

Speaker 2  46:45
about these swings that these swings are tipped around forever

Unknown Speaker  46:50
nobody ever seems to know what to do with them

Speaker 2  47:03
oh, what were them I don't know what this I don't know what the last is.

Speaker 3  47:10
So if nothing all of these remaining right

Matthias Miller  47:24
well, what's gonna happen is this thing's going to show up when I mean currently the way it's right now, it's gonna show up on your sales orders needing invoicing and saying hey, you want to

Speaker 3  47:38
Yeah. But why don't we suppose what what should we do with this old stuff like and so

Matthias Miller  47:59
I mean, either we should

Unknown Speaker  48:07
or they still exist.

Unknown Speaker  48:10
I think if you do

Matthias Miller  48:15
Yeah, I mean, this one says it says it's, we this one's weird though because MTI says it's here. It's an FTA right? The reason it's only a GI is because it's not invoice but we think it should be invoice to get off at GI

Unknown Speaker  48:29
Bill, it should not it should not come off it yet because

Unknown Speaker  48:34
it's still

Speaker 3  48:39
but what happened to it that well, I mean, it should just act like any other lot will on an STI unlock

Unknown Speaker  48:47
except it has an endless why does it?

Speaker 4  48:55
Well, this goes way back to this goes way back when to the beginning of time when when Josh split sales orders and invoices apart and it created an invoice for

Unknown Speaker  49:07
you have it all the same. All the

Speaker 3  49:09
other liabilities have failed, as well, too. There was a lot going on yesterday. It was

Speaker 2  49:18
well, but it's this notion, this district x we disregard some of that for SDI.

Unknown Speaker  49:26
But this shouldn't be this should not be distributed. Like we don't have an swingsets of this.

Speaker 2  49:34
I have gone through this inventory a couple of times, inventory audits and we have these conversations every single time. As far as I know they're still you come to they come on yours the last couple times we did stairs.

Unknown Speaker  49:53
Matthias

Speaker 7  49:56
one second to think Go Scotland upstairs all the way on the end closest to the restaurant just go all the way it's got a little window you can see all that stuff so thanks

Unknown Speaker  50:19
but more about noticing

Unknown Speaker  50:23
more

Unknown Speaker  50:27
How do you

Matthias Miller  50:33
I mean why is this one where did this oh here's the you might have been a buyback which is why

Unknown Speaker  50:39
now

Matthias Miller  50:41
something the same June the May of May of 21 Whatever

Speaker 2  50:46
that thing was this one show up on anybody's finished because it doesn't have a builder

Unknown Speaker  50:53
well let's see what was built but nobody knows

Matthias Miller  51:07
well do you haven't

Speaker 4  51:08
been having conversations about it's been floating out there and

Unknown Speaker  51:12
it's probably

Unknown Speaker  51:14
actual something or other.

Matthias Miller  51:17
We do have personal minutes do

Unknown Speaker  51:26
you only get attachments?

Matthias Miller  51:29
Here's the sales order. Attachments. No. Sales Order

Matthias Miller  51:38
you know why? Sorry, it's late. Tim tells me more of these jokes when I'm sleep deprived, which is also true. Do you know what Buddhists have smaller? email inboxes

Unknown Speaker  51:54
Oh, why? Because

Matthias Miller  51:56
they don't have attachments.

Unknown Speaker  52:00
So lame. Garone

Matthias Miller  52:10
here's the sales order

Matthias Miller  52:21
legacy sales order

Matthias Miller  52:30
I mean, wait, yeah, I don't know what I don't know what to do with it

Speaker 3  52:34
lately, but that right now? They'll

Matthias Miller  52:37
show up in your report and you can figure it out from there.

Unknown Speaker  52:43
This one

Matthias Miller  52:48
we don't we're not wanting to invoice anymore, because this one's in finished goods. This is another district X that says it's unfinished goods. We don't have a Buller diagram for

Matthias Miller  53:16
but I don't know well it'll play itself out there. But it hasn't. I mean, this one's weird because as invoice date

Unknown Speaker  53:39
why doesn't one

Matthias Miller  53:46
because district acts and doesn't have any

Unknown Speaker  53:48
transit tasks.

Matthias Miller  53:52
And we changed the rules. Do you want to do you want this on invoiced? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  54:02
Get over here

Matthias Miller  54:19
okay, well, there you have it. Yeah.

Speaker 3  54:30
That's a lot of work that we did a lot of work still remaining. So. Yeah. Good. So we're on for Monday at one.

Matthias Miller  54:42
Yeah, we just confirm everything's good for that. Yes, Monday at 1pm.

Speaker 7  54:47
