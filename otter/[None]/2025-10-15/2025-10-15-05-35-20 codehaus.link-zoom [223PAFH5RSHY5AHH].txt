Unknown Speaker  00:00
I able To do. Hey, Matt morning,

Unknown Speaker  06:17
can't hear you.

Matthias Miller  06:18
There we go. Now you can

Unknown Speaker  06:23
see. So do

Unknown Speaker  06:30
you have anything for me right away?

Matthias Miller  06:35
Yeah, probably, probably the biggest thing would be Amanda asked about this, and I hadn't sent out an email. Soon enough, I still haven't sent it out, but it out, but if you go to the item page

Matthias Miller  07:01
and just pull up, pull up an item.

Matthias Miller  07:14
So I added a type you want to pop that open. The type, the second, second from the top there the type, yeah, we've got a non material item, material only, cut list only, assembly only, and cut list and assembly.

Unknown Speaker  07:34
So non material, material only. I

Unknown Speaker  07:45
Okay, make sense? I think so. Why would it

Unknown Speaker  07:52
be cut less only

Matthias Miller  07:56
if there's ever lumber that needs to be sized, which I don't know if you guys do that.

Speaker 1  08:02
Yeah, we have we Yeah, can happen. Material only would be, anyway,

Matthias Miller  08:09
lumber. I mean, just straight up lumber,

Speaker 1  08:13
yeah, you're not gonna not being caught, yeah. And then non material,

Unknown Speaker  08:21
okay, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  08:32
40 and 48 be repaired. I mean, that's typically assembly only, so, right? I guess that was in there already. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  08:44
no, it was, it was under, it was under both. So we should, we should change it to,

Speaker 1  08:51
I mean, it's possible that we have to cut lumber for for these, but they don't come in as sage orders. This item doesn't come in as a sage order, it's a stock. I mean, so, right.

Unknown Speaker  09:04
No, barely, that's fine, I think, yeah, no, you mentioned Amanda, yeah, what? How did, what is,

Matthias Miller  09:16
how did that happen? John T was trying to, trying to get some stuff done. And I guess must have talked to her about, let me, let me actually find the email thread. I'll just forward it over. And I guess John T was talking to her about

Unknown Speaker  09:43
it. She got involved somehow. Yep, she

Matthias Miller  09:46
got involved. John has a has a knack for getting any anybody, but you involved on these types of things. I just forgot to, I should have looped you in and just didn't cross my mind.

Unknown Speaker  09:59
I. So what did,

Unknown Speaker  10:04
what did he want, or what did she want?

Matthias Miller  10:07
I sent over the email. There were a couple of items that that did not need to be part of assembly, and she was looking for the I had moved the checkbox into this drop list, yeah. And she was wondering how to, how to, how to do that,

Speaker 1  10:22
okay? I mean, she is trying to help, which is fine, um, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:34
I guess. And she

Speaker 1  10:37
tend gravitates towards any, any drama that's happening in the office, she'll gravitate towards it and get sucked in. Yep, if George is having a you know, if he's throwing a fit about something, she'll end up at his desk or,

Unknown Speaker  11:00
yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  11:06
Did, did, like,

Speaker 1  11:10
was her, are those problems solved or,

Matthias Miller  11:13
yeah, I don't think she needs anything. I mean, I think it's, I think she's good to go. But, yeah, i right.

Unknown Speaker  11:24
So then

Matthias Miller  11:32
the biggest pieces left then are daily lumber invoicing, which, if we have this type now for material only, we can easily do daily lumber invoicing.

Matthias Miller  11:55
I was part of my goal with that

Unknown Speaker  12:00
in daily invoicing or

Matthias Miller  12:07
adding it to a report, you're saying, yeah, just adding it to a report.

Speaker 1  12:11
So currently, is it? Is it currently not in the report?

Speaker 2  12:16
No, yeah, it's not in the report. No,

Unknown Speaker  12:25
yeah, okay. So you're so

Speaker 1  12:30
you're saying that we would. Can you elaborate on that? Again, we need to

Matthias Miller  12:37
make so if, yeah, we need to make sure the lumber Okay? In my mind, what's easiest and simplest is making sure that all of the lumber items are marked as material only, yeah, and then we can use that for reporting purposes, right?

Speaker 1  13:01
Which, at this point they should be. I think,

Matthias Miller  13:07
are they in there, like that?

Speaker 1  13:09
I mean, I again, I don't know for sure. I haven't put all the, I mean, you know, all the items.

Unknown Speaker  13:20
So

Speaker 1  13:25
I prop I could, I mean, I could run

Matthias Miller  13:29
well as anyone as I mean, part of it, what Amanda's going to do is clean up the list is John keeps cleaning out sales orders and make sure his thing is up to date. That stuff should get, should get cleaned up as we go,

Speaker 2  13:41
Right, exactly, okay, so, yeah, I mean, well,

Unknown Speaker  13:51
if an Order,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
if an order comes through,

Unknown Speaker  14:02
if an order comes through.

Speaker 1  14:06
Sorry, I'm being distracted by my phone. I got, I didn't come to work the last two days, and he's, technically, he's lost his job. Now he's texting me, but, oh no, I'll try to, well, he, I mean, I try to get a hold of him yesterday, but, yeah, it's a kid that we was actually Tuesday church, like Sir bible school when I drove bus years ago in there, he rode the bus. I hired him as a 23 year old. And he needs a dad, he needs mentors and help in his life, and he's got some hooks in him, and I'm trying to help him a lot already. And it's crazy, man, because

Unknown Speaker  14:57
then the the those people that are.

Speaker 1  15:01
So semi Christians, if I may say that, you know, sitting on the fringes, like John T you know, oh yeah, it's good. We're helping people, but yeah, it looks like it's always going to be a failure. You know, trying to help people. And you just so,

Unknown Speaker  15:23
um, yeah,

Speaker 1  15:30
yeah, but these, but then, but then the guy like me, they need more help than they need to be held account. He needs held accountable. But then to what extent? Oh, gosh, I think I wrestle with it every day. What extent do you go be above and beyond in a working in a in an organizational, in an organization, you know, in a business, to what extent do you above and beyond, because, because, soon you're sacrificing other obligations, other people, other commitments or whatever for that troubled person. And most people just don't. They just, I don't know, just cut it off or whatever. Just don't go there, avoid it, right?

Matthias Miller  16:24
So here's, here's the real quick, here's, here's a few questions to ask. Number one, do you need this for yourself personally? Because you like being personally involved in people's lives, and that's what gives you joy, life and fulfillment. Is this a value? Saying you want company values that that point in this direction?

Speaker 1  16:49
Um, it's not. I mean, the main, the main, my main drive, is the guy matters. I care about the guy. That's my main thing.

Matthias Miller  17:00
So here's a thought, and I don't know if it's a I don't know if it's a good thought or a bad thought, but I think, I think I've been making the shift. I've got a friend of mine who's been, who's, who's, who often encourages people to make this shift. But if you're, if you've got too much, well, I think you and I both know what happens when you've got too much, too much goodwill that gets that goes too far in business and ends up getting advanced, taken advantage of. And it's almost easier to say, Okay, I'm not going to be a jerk in the business realm, but business is also not the place where I put on my go help people hat and so, and it's more for just and so. But that means then you got to figure out a way to help the guy that doesn't like, if you can live up to the business standards, which is exactly what you're doing like, well, then there's an opportunity for him. But if not, then we got to look at, look at a way to to do that that doesn't compromise, yeah, what you're looking to build, yeah? So that's, that's, anyway, that's a, that's a long,

Unknown Speaker  18:14
that's something, yeah, there's a, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  18:19
That's, I loved it, man, I wish we could talk about that more. But

Unknown Speaker  18:23
keep moving.

Matthias Miller  18:27
Yeah, let's keep moving.

Speaker 1  18:31
No, it's It's because it's fast, it's fascinating. But I guess I'm saying is to just establish those boundaries. It's okay. It's okay. You need the business needs boundaries

Matthias Miller  18:43
well, and some of the best people, the people who are the best at helping these types of people, really, really, really, are bad at making money. And that's a little bit of the I mean, people take this the wrong way. And I've probably had a little bit of a sour taste of people just completely washing their hands of the matter. But it is also a gift. If you if you have a people helper that you can that that you can support in some kind of capacity to build up these guys, that's a you don't just bless the young guy. You bless the other person as well.

Speaker 1  19:25
You're saying the people that are good at helping others are bad at making money, like

Unknown Speaker  19:30
overall, sort of, or, I mean

Unknown Speaker  19:32
it,

Matthias Miller  19:33
it's not across the board, but it does kind of tend to go hand in

Unknown Speaker  19:39
hand, I know, like the sense, let's change that. Let's,

Unknown Speaker  19:41
let's, like, let's come up with a new, a better model, right?

Matthias Miller  19:47
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean it, but, but it comes down to, when it comes to making money, you have to, if you're going to make money, you have to operate at some level, in a healthy self interest. Yeah, and, and that doesn't mean, I mean that doesn't mean being narcissistic or self centered. It's just if you're always and it's not, it's not about leaning. I think it's in my mind, we all have a certain place that we think fairness lives. But and it's, it's been a journey for me to find where, what this actually looks like, and I don't pretend to have it downright but I think it's, it's somewhere between not making too little and not making too much. But also, if there's market opportunities that you can you can take advantage of, and you can redistribute in better ways. Well, then why not so anyway, it's a long it's a long rabbit hole, but, but I do wonder whether business style relationships, I don't believe capitalism fundamentally works very well in the I scratch your back. You scratch mine, because you end up with codependency and people taking advantage of each other and all this other stuff. Anyway. Long as long rabbit hole that we weren't so still, still weren't going to go

Unknown Speaker  21:15
down. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:19
okay, so the next pieces that I have on my plate is invoice. Is the data daily lumber, like the daily reporting and the the

Matthias Miller  21:40
invoice quantity, column.

Unknown Speaker  21:45
Invoice quantity

Matthias Miller  21:49
being able from the Assembly tracker, yeah, to base it off of what was actually invoiced,

Unknown Speaker  21:58
right? So

Speaker 1  22:05
before, well, okay, and is there any any discussion around those things, or is that matter of

Matthias Miller  22:14
just gotta get it done? Okay?

Speaker 1  22:16
I have a question for I have two questions. One is John and Tina are asking. John is seeming that seems to think he is not able to delete.

Unknown Speaker  22:33
He said, Work Orders.

Speaker 1  22:36
I think what he meant was sage orders. So in other words, if I go to 70 tracker,

Unknown Speaker  22:48
my screen sharing

Unknown Speaker  22:50
right now, if I go down here to the

Unknown Speaker  22:59
so there's 220

Speaker 1  23:01
right now there are, today is the 15th. So if I go to 14, it's like there's 82 entries, 82 sage orders that have not been resolved here. Um, these, I know there's some Armstrong ones. They said that like, here's one for 630

Unknown Speaker  23:24
might be a little close to the

Speaker 1  23:28
they're saying that one was deleted. It just needs to be

Unknown Speaker  23:33
taken out of here.

Matthias Miller  23:35
Okay, which one was that? No,

Unknown Speaker  23:38
sorry, I'm not so sure this guy,

Matthias Miller  23:42
seven, nine,

Unknown Speaker  23:47
if I how do I get to that?

Matthias Miller  23:52
Hit the little the blue thing there?

Unknown Speaker  23:57
No. This guy, 79803,

Unknown Speaker  24:01
there.

Unknown Speaker  24:04
No, no. I,

Matthias Miller  24:07
if you can, you can take the number and you can go on the menu to search for sage orders. There's, there's not a way to do it, right from here. Okay, so right here, no, if you go to all the way out to the menu, Okay,

Unknown Speaker  24:26
and oh over here,

Unknown Speaker  24:27
yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:41
I mean it just yeah, like, Okay, go down to activity history, just for fun. This morning, the oh, that's the inventory. Item update date. Anyway, it's still coming across from Sage.

Speaker 3  25:06
You're saying that number, yeah, okay. And

Speaker 1  25:16
then if you go back, so it's coming across every day. Is that what I'm for?

Matthias Miller  25:22
Yeah, I mean, it's just, these are the fields that are coming across. Are just, it's updating the quantity sold in the inventory item update date, which doesn't really mean much for the order itself. Okay, if you, if you close this tab and go back. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. Order Status, I know what it is,

Matthias Miller  25:56
because we can't tell the difference. The order was canceled, but it's been invoiced. That's why it's showing up. Hit the close out this

Speaker 1  26:06
tab. How do I Where do I do that? Top

Matthias Miller  26:09
the little X.

Speaker 2  26:13
Oh, right. Here, right. Yep, that guy. Okay, okay, if you scroll up,

Matthias Miller  26:20
order status is x, which means canceled or deleted. Scroll down. It's got an invoice date, so we can't tell the difference. They told us, well, if it's if it's canceled and an invoice date, it just means something was back ordered. And so that's why it's there.

Matthias Miller  26:49
Sorry, I'm playing slightly the victim here, but we can't tell the difference between a sales order, between this guy and a sales order that was only partially completed, and therefore back ordered.

Speaker 1  27:06
So from your understanding, this, this was invoiced, we probably got paid for this order.

Matthias Miller  27:12
Well, let's go. Let's go over to, let's look, look at my invoice. Search. Go, 79803, so go, go over to this, to the Invoices tab or menu item.

Speaker 1  27:25
Isn't there an invoice number? There's not an invoice number here,

Matthias Miller  27:29
I guess, no, but no. But we can search by we can search invoices by sales order. So go back, go out to the menu and pull up sage invoices, put it in the order number,

Matthias Miller  27:50
okay, pull this guy up. Says, We shipped 506 46 back ordered. Shipped on July 3. Oh. Well,

Unknown Speaker  28:07
yeah, so they, it was shipped.

Unknown Speaker  28:18
So,

Unknown Speaker  28:24
all right.

Matthias Miller  28:26
But if there's a, if there's a specific, I mean, if this isn't the right one, and we've got specific numbers we need to look at, I don't mind, but, I mean, but this is the thing to check.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
I Yeah, well, I think,

Unknown Speaker  28:49
in a roundabout way, I think John was

Speaker 1  28:55
they're not here today now, they're John and Tina, off today, tomorrow and Friday. I think he was trying to figure out how to

Speaker 3  29:05
delete sage orders,

Speaker 1  29:11
basically that were canceled, ones that were orders that were canceled. But I don't think we want him to be deleting, no.

Matthias Miller  29:20
I mean, he could override the order quantity to zero, if you're if he really needs to make it go away.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
But, yeah,

Speaker 1  29:30
they were trying. I asked them to clean up everything from June 24 till current and so, like, it was like, 80, whatever, 80 some left. A lot of those, I think, are their lumber items or their inventory items that they weren't able to resolve. And I'm not sure that. I don't know why they didn't get them all cleaned up. I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  29:57
Okay, um.

Speaker 1  30:02
Yeah, I guess I'm not. I'm just not sure. So seven, sage, Armstrong sage order, 79803, I mean, it's the only one that's

Matthias Miller  30:19
that's that early.

Speaker 1  30:21
Well, yeah, exactly, soon, yeah, period, I think you know Armstrong in that, in that list

Unknown Speaker  30:29
tracker, yeah, if I go,

Speaker 1  30:39
Oh, there's a, well, wait a minute. 630 okay, there's 728 there's still one hanging out there. 80070 let me see if that that 552 quantity was changed to

Unknown Speaker  31:00
50506 50506 Yeah, 506

Speaker 1  31:06
and in voice, I'm just making a note, then I come back this. Let's see what this guy is. 1013, that's this week. So 800702,

Unknown Speaker  31:23
let's just go to invoice right away.

Matthias Miller  31:37
Ship 276 276 back ordered.

Unknown Speaker  31:43
Yeah, 800-708-0070

Speaker 3  31:50
but 550, order quantity,

Unknown Speaker  31:59
let's change to 276,

Unknown Speaker  32:05
and invoice.

Speaker 1  32:21
I don't know what they're I don't know what their deal is with these other ones, Val five.

Speaker 3  32:37
I mean, ah, this dude, it was 722 for 200 and

Speaker 1  32:50
here we built 200 on 721 but they went to a different sage order number.

Unknown Speaker  32:56
What

Matthias Miller  32:59
the? Oh, it's curious. 8033, it was a later order, number

Speaker 1  33:06
79875, is what I had there.

Unknown Speaker  33:19
Why is this?

Unknown Speaker  33:31
I'm trying. What was that? Oh,

Matthias Miller  33:38
sorry, I couldn't tell you

Speaker 1  33:39
48 by 40 He treated grade

Unknown Speaker  33:44
a val five, shoot out.

Unknown Speaker  33:46
Remember what that was? All right, let me go back.

Speaker 3  33:49
Get back. I get back here. Yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  33:59
so that's a, that's

Unknown Speaker  34:01
one. It's a 48 by 40

Unknown Speaker  34:04
Grade A.

Speaker 1  34:07
They made them on the machine. They made new ones on the machine. What is this? 80033? What the

Speaker 3  34:29
79875, wow, 43, day.

Speaker 1  34:44
So instead of selling these people a Grade A, we're making them new pallets, selling them a grade A, prices. Um, so what I'm seeing here 80033, I.

Unknown Speaker  35:09
So she created a new sage order.

Unknown Speaker  35:18
When the heck she creating a new sage Orton,

Unknown Speaker  35:30
I don't know. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  35:41
at some point. Well,

Unknown Speaker  35:48
incompetence, right?

Matthias Miller  35:53
Well, I mean, it's okay. Here's a great one. This is, this is great for both conversations. This came up yesterday. How do you know whether somebody's headed in the right direction? My friend was telling me he's got a couple guys who were cleaning college and got into drugs, and the big the number one factor that you look at is, is the time between relapses, is it growing or shrinking? And he said, anybody who's, any of those guys, who's who the distance between relapses is is growing, he's got a good relationship with for any of them where the relapses are shrinking, not working. Wow. Same with a team member, if you correct them and and it goes longer until the same thing happens. Like, maybe you got to show it with this is in the context of a sales guy, and he's like, you just got to get on the sales guy. Well, if you get on him a little bit to pick up his pace and keep moving, is it longer until he relapses? And if so, you're moving him in the right direction now, might still not be an A player. It's a management headache, but it's and so that's, that's a really useful metric for you to look at as you're looking at these personnel issues,

Unknown Speaker  37:10
right? 80033,

Speaker 1  37:16
well, I and that's where it's tough, because this nobody's there's been zero accountability around this stuff, right? I mean, I mean Rick's Rick. Rick was in charge, yep, essentially, of all of this. And now I'm getting involved, and I'm asking questions and looking for clarity and cleaning up the messes. And you go to my dad and try to explain to him all the work that all the work that it takes to organize the company, and you know me, and he doesn't even, I don't even think he has any appreciation for it, because I don't think he thinks it's needed. Yeah, in his mind, he doesn't.

Unknown Speaker  38:08
He's more worried about

Speaker 1  38:11
we're getting orders. Are we getting lumber? Are we keeping a customer happy? You know, yep. Is he getting his money out of it?

Unknown Speaker  38:23
Yep, exactly, exactly,

Speaker 1  38:29
well, but, but back to Tina. I mean, she seemingly is getting better at this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  38:41
I Yes, yeah,

Matthias Miller  38:45
yeah, well, yep. Well, I mean, there wasn't a way to to you now we're dealing with tangibles, so real things and so that that'll make it easier going forward. Yeah, I yeah, um, all right, what else do you have? What you need to chase any of that, all that stuff,

Unknown Speaker  39:06
I think

Unknown Speaker  39:07
so, um, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  39:11
And this one was, so this 80033, I think that was in Louisiana, right? Let's see. I two, three,

Unknown Speaker  39:29
yeah, shipped, ordered.

Unknown Speaker  39:35
I n means it was invoiced.

Matthias Miller  39:39
It means it is an invoice, not a credit memo,

Unknown Speaker  39:45
okay, ordered, shipped, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  39:56
all right, was this? Yeah? I.

Speaker 1  40:15
I don't know why she's doing that. I think, well, I know why. I mean, I guess, I guess when you when you're not sure how a program works, you

Unknown Speaker  40:26
you take the route that you go, the direction that works, that

Unknown Speaker  40:32
just

Unknown Speaker  40:35
what do you do? Find your way through.

Matthias Miller  40:39
You do. And there's, there's two kinds of people, some some will just make a guess, anything to just to keep moving. And other people will stop and say, I gotta figure this thing out. And they're going to Google and call and email until they find it. So, yep, Alright, so

Unknown Speaker  40:58
here's a quick one. Matt in us.

Unknown Speaker  41:02
I'm gonna go items. Excuse me. Trying

Unknown Speaker  41:14
to think here.

Unknown Speaker  41:21
Oh, crackers,

Unknown Speaker  41:23
oh New Holland. Here we go. NH Eight, seven, zeros, ducks in a row. Here I

Unknown Speaker  41:46
all right, man, I'm not, I'm not

Unknown Speaker  41:53
blanking on the NH number here,

Unknown Speaker  41:56
oh, here, 87076430, is assembled as

Unknown Speaker  42:09
cut list and Assembly assembled as 70270,

Unknown Speaker  42:15
okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  42:18
my question is, do

Unknown Speaker  42:26
if,

Unknown Speaker  42:30
if, 70270 or 87076430, either one of these. Can they be assembled as themselves or as the other one.

Matthias Miller  42:46
So currently you can assemble the 76430, or the 70270 whatever these that I don't know how to say it the NH eight and the NH seven will just abbreviate you can assemble the NH eight and sell it as an NH eight. You can assemble the NH seven and sell it as an NH eight, but you can't assemble an NH eight and sell it as an NH seven. Yeah. So to do that, you have to go into NH seven and say that the NH seven can also be assembled as an NH eight, right?

Speaker 3  43:27
And would that confuse if I do mean, well, I don't,

Matthias Miller  43:33
yeah, just hit the you can, you can go straight, yeah, there you go. That works. I don't think it should.

Unknown Speaker  43:39
I that not aware

Matthias Miller  43:44
of any, anything, any reason why it should confuse anything?

Speaker 1  43:51
Yeah, it's well, then here we have this sold as,

Matthias Miller  43:57
yeah, so that that shows that there's other you know, this is what it gets sold as,

Speaker 1  44:05
right? And it could be multiples. Here, correct,

Matthias Miller  44:08
correct. There could be multiples, yep.

Unknown Speaker  44:11
So if I go back then to send me tracker, 702702,

Unknown Speaker  44:30
I know there's a bunch of clean up here yet on the way back.

Matthias Miller  44:35
Yeah, we're not expanding that report to

Speaker 1  44:38
show the No. But here we have June or August, August, August, September, September, September, all these little quantities.

Unknown Speaker  44:54
So what am I trying to say? So.

Speaker 1  45:04
He tied these like they tied these out right or wrong. They tied out everything they could here in the assembly tracker.

Unknown Speaker  45:32
Where's an order for 188, 76152, We assembled 24

Unknown Speaker  45:42
so. What's

Unknown Speaker  45:55
what?

Unknown Speaker  46:07
I thought, how did they get

Speaker 1  46:11
this year's How did he attach this year's assembly to that's the last year's work orders, right?

Unknown Speaker  46:24
So this is a, it

Matthias Miller  46:27
was a June work order. Oh, wait,

Unknown Speaker  46:36
yeah, but I'm 7977, sixes were way back in. They were last year. Yeah. Well, there it is, 76152,

Unknown Speaker  46:55
well, they,

Matthias Miller  46:56
they got some of the items out of the list

Unknown Speaker  47:00
one way or another, one way or another,

Speaker 2  47:05
Frank, what is,

Speaker 1  47:16
I guess it in a way, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. But I was telling Tina, like we whatever we have in inventory right now that's that's not been sold, should be reflected in I mean, yeah, should be left over at the end of all the current

Unknown Speaker  47:46
so right now I have,

Speaker 1  47:49
yeah, old sage orders nobody cares about. So when he was going in, he was just picking off the list, like,

Unknown Speaker  47:57
I don't even know what he was doing. I have no idea.

Matthias Miller  48:00
I'm guessing, yeah, something like that.

Speaker 2  48:05
Something looks wrong. What's that? It just looks wrong.

Unknown Speaker  48:12
Say, say it sorry. What did you say? It

Matthias Miller  48:14
just looks like they did it wrong, yeah?

Speaker 1  48:18
But I guess it does it matter? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  48:22
Well, you got to close out these guys somehow, like, why wouldn't you?

Speaker 1  48:27
Yeah, well, I'll have to go back. I'll have to, I mean, he's obviously got the latest, the latest work orders right here, 938, 13. He's got all this tied out. 625, 620, 19. Six, five. I don't know why they're only making one at a time. That's lame. I guess they needed one. They made one. I have no idea here we did seven. They did way more than seven. They had to do way these guys were working for six hours on these things. They had to do more at seven,

Unknown Speaker  49:04
850, to 430,

Unknown Speaker  49:08
59 but none completed. What is,

Matthias Miller  49:13
I don't know. Oh, there's a link to the completed work order. Go down. Completed work order. Pop over there. This really wrapped it up.

Unknown Speaker  49:25
Seven to 850,

Speaker 1  49:32
they made. So these are ones we make the runner blocks first, and then they then they finish making the so they made seven on that day. Where was I?

Matthias Miller  49:47
It popped in a new window. So close this

Unknown Speaker  49:49
tab, those tab, thanks, man.

Unknown Speaker  49:57
Back here, da. Uh,

Speaker 1  50:02
here they made one in two and a half hours. That don't make any sense.

Speaker 3  50:08
958, to 104. Completed one that just, you know,

Unknown Speaker  50:18
I'm sure they made more than one.

Unknown Speaker  50:22
Yeah, right,

Speaker 1  50:25
this is anyway, okay. So we got the I got the answer to my question. In other words, this item, if an item is assembled,

Unknown Speaker  50:40
what's that? Here's the

Matthias Miller  50:41
fun report. Look at the assembly track, the assembly analysis report for this item.

Matthias Miller  50:56
And then Yep, and then primary grouping day. Just leave it wide open.

Speaker 1  51:02
Oh, okay, take this out, dig it out,

Matthias Miller  51:06
do primary grouping by day and run that. I mean, this looks interesting. I don't know if those, those March, those 2024, March and April numbers are real, or if that's just bad quantities, but scroll down. I mean, clearly something's wildly wrong.

Unknown Speaker  51:37
You're saying, what? Where that quantity like,

Matthias Miller  51:40
yeah. I mean, yeah, it is it quantity? Is it something's going sideways? And for the June, June ones, which you can you can see it's exactly what you're saying. It's just a different way of seeing the exact same thing, same with on on May 23 that looks off like, it looks like it should be. It looks like, like and maybe it's just partially orders. It's not just order size, it's partially these small orders are killing you.

Unknown Speaker  52:12
I don't, yeah, I don't know, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, I Some,

Unknown Speaker  52:27
yeah,

Speaker 1  52:29
oh, man, that's sad. I knew I knew last year with Steven and him doing entries. I mean, I knew that. I knew he was going to make mistakes. I knew he was gonna not do stuff completely, right? Um, me, OCD, whatever I was I didn't like it makes me uncomfortable. I want things to be exact all the time,

Speaker 3  52:55
yep, um, I um, I don't know.

Speaker 1  53:05
I guess it's okay, but it makes a lot, and it makes extra work, which we, anyway, we don't have. I mean, everything's all that's been invoiced. It's been recorded,

Unknown Speaker  53:19
historical.

Speaker 1  53:20
Again, we had never mind we, yeah, we already went over this. You gave me a tool to be able to look at, how do we set what is that? Though, that's where we go into, oh, shoot, where we look at historical.

Speaker 1  53:42
There. Ever, no, I don't want the analysis I look at, I want the tracker right

Unknown Speaker  53:51
if I Look at, say,

Unknown Speaker  54:02
AR, 001,

Unknown Speaker  54:16
order 370,

Unknown Speaker  54:20
we've assembled 61,000,

Unknown Speaker  54:30
I don't make sense.

Unknown Speaker  54:34
Where do we look at this?

Matthias Miller  54:46
Okay, the other the other way to look, there's the the assembly overview by item, and maybe you have the details you need there, but it shows. We ordered 1300 and assembled. 13. We ordered 1336, and assembled. 371, where on the that over Overview report that shows everything broken down just by item.

Unknown Speaker  55:15
Oh, here, hang on a second. I do

Unknown Speaker  55:27
this, what did you say again,

Matthias Miller  55:31
that that report that we put together with, was it with Tina, the assembly overview, if you go on the menu, the assembly Overview by item, okay,

Unknown Speaker  55:45
date.

Unknown Speaker  55:52
You, yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  56:00
that's Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  56:08
390

Speaker 1  56:16
Yeah, that's not um, I mean, they're in they're simple. Were you getting the assembled number from? Matt? Is that coming from ones that

Unknown Speaker  56:27
have been tied out? Yes.

Matthias Miller  56:30
Well, hang on, let me find out,

Unknown Speaker  56:34
because if it

Unknown Speaker  56:36
that should come from the work order entries,

Matthias Miller  56:40
one of The assembled

Matthias Miller  56:48
you know that's not respecting the date of

Matthias Miller  57:03
so the only way to Really get accurate numbers on this is by simply quantities.

Matthias Miller  57:25
We actually want. Never mind. That's true. It is for the sage. It is for that order. No, it's it is based on what the assembly tracker has tied out to that sales order,

Unknown Speaker  57:40
right?

Speaker 1  57:43
But I'm saying the quantity assembled total should be the total that's been entered on work orders. Then

Matthias Miller  57:54
that's that is what it is that's

Unknown Speaker  57:59
that wouldn't hold true, though,

Speaker 3  58:03
if I go to ARS, take a look. Well, okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  58:14
yeah, historical here. I mean by this, your total hair is 345, 318, okay?

Matthias Miller  58:23
So let me try. This is ar, ar, 345, assembled. Well, because this includes, okay, the difference would be,

Matthias Miller  58:48
no, do, but don't We don't we have that many not tied out.

Speaker 1  58:57
Yes, yeah, that's, that's historically. There's a most of them are not tied out historically. I mean,

Matthias Miller  59:05
that accounts for the discrepancy, because the assembly overview by item is looking at Sage orders and saying, how much did we order and and when we tied them out, how much did we assemble?

Speaker 1  59:16
Yeah. Um, I want it. I was hoping to know, like, I just, I want to have an here's how many, a grand total of How's how many have been invoiced historically. Here's how many have been assembled historically. Are we close? If we're really close, relatively close. I'm not going to go back historical and try to correct a million John T mistakes, right? I'm asking

Unknown Speaker  59:51
you instead to

Unknown Speaker  59:55
give me that window and then i What can that? Matt, can that be tweaked on that assembly

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
or review? Yes. And so we would just Yes. It can

Speaker 1  1:00:08
four. Is there a minimum due date? The default is 25 on there. Is there a reason for that? Matt, Max is showing up as today, which is awesome. The minimum was showing up as January, 1 of this year, last year. I like to have it last year. It is

Matthias Miller  1:00:32
last year. It's one 124 to 1015 it's one 124

Speaker 4  1:00:35
to today. I know I take I just changed it.

Matthias Miller  1:00:39
Oh, you changed it. Oh, never mind. You wanted to start back. Well, why don't we just default it to blank, which is going to leave it wide open.

Speaker 1  1:00:47
Well, that's fine, but when I look, when I look at this, I'm going to want to, I'm always going to want to go back to January 1 of last year. So do we

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
sure?

Speaker 1  1:01:00
So I don't know if that's if that's easy to do. Yeah, I'm always good. That's where we started tracking everything,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
yep, in

Unknown Speaker  1:01:17
our own broken way. So which we're making sense out of these numbers we're making.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:27
It's, it's useful, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:30
So then Yeah. So then here, this will be, yeah. This is very telling

Speaker 3  1:01:41
piece, right here. So

Speaker 1  1:01:45
where I'm at is, you know, cleaning everything up from June till now, so that right now things are in order. Which John and Tina doing that work? I'm sure some of the like especially the stock items. It's a little screwed up, because whatever, we might have 100 sitting out here, and everything's been invoiced already or whatever. But anyway, I've asked them to do as much as they can. I figured I'd come in and clean up the rest myself. And then after that's done, look, I'll look at historical by going through this list right here, overview by item and just and then when there's ones that are like, I don't know if it's off by 5% I mean, what do you do? I don't know if it's not off by more than 5% just let it go.

Matthias Miller  1:02:50
Yeah, maybe something like that.

Speaker 1  1:02:52
Some of these items were mixed up with, you know, sides or runner blocks, or tops and ends and all the things, those are probably the ones are going to pop out.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
Boy, I wish I could.

Speaker 1  1:03:09
I don't personally know, if I go down through this list, there's what 1000, 1115

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
items here, there's, I don't know,

Speaker 1  1:03:20
offhand which ones are crates and which ones aren't just by the item code.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:26
So it's, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:03:30
know if it matters, but it doesn't really matter. I'll just go through here and I'll,

Speaker 1  1:03:38
I'll start at the top, and if there's a big discrepancy, we'll get into it and we'll Yeah, anyway, that's probably what

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
I'll do. Is the order quantity, which you want to use, or should we look at using the invoice quantity or the Shipped order?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:00
Say it again.

Matthias Miller  1:04:03
Should we take a look at using the ship, quantity,

Speaker 1  1:04:05
shipped, quantity, yes. And then for the quantity shipped and quantity assembled,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
what's override total?

Matthias Miller  1:04:15
That's for when, when John, John T puts in an override on the sales order quantity.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:25
All right, Daniel, one,

Matthias Miller  1:04:28
I I wonder if I don't think it really makes that much sense as a number if we're switching over to invoices, but it could be, it could be useful to see if he's

Speaker 1  1:04:40
put in any overrides, yeah, you can leave it there. That sounds good. I think I'm gonna ask for one other column, Matt, and that would just be a percentage,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
of discrepancy.

Speaker 1  1:04:58
And then if I could click. On that top of that column, and it would order them worse to

Speaker 3  1:05:06
Yep, then I would start picking away at that from that angle, right, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
Otherwise, let me check with George I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
your marriage. Hey, do you have any questions for Matthias?

Speaker 3  1:06:02
Yeah, yeah, we talked about it already. We popped over here. Okay, yeah. Um, all right, man, George

Speaker 1  1:06:25
is going to pop in here. He's his. That's what they were talking about. I knew they were talking about something because she was at his desk earlier. They're talking about the the let's see where we at here. They were talking about

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
that new

Speaker 2  1:06:46
sure question again, by the way, I'm just Just

Matthias Miller  1:06:54
a heads up. I'm going to have to drop it about 1010, minutes

Unknown Speaker  1:06:57
or so. No problem.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:58
No problem.

Speaker 1  1:07:01
So Matt, they were asking about the box, the that you added. So what were we looking at? I'll just go in an item, right? Yep, we'll do A,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:13
B, repaired. Continue

Speaker 1  1:07:20
this right here, cut list and assembly. What?

Speaker 5  1:07:25
What replaced the no assembly box that was down?

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
Well, sure that's I mean that, but that depends on why no assembly. Because there's multiple reasons for no assembly. It could be no assembly because it's great. That would be a non material item. Could be no assembly because it's just material that doesn't need to be cut, that's material only, or it could be no assembly because it's lumber that needs to be sized down, in which case it would be cut list only. So those three, we have to get more specific than just we don't need assembly. It needs to get

Speaker 1  1:07:58
so Matt for items that were well, question, does that mean all of the items need to be updated manually? So?

Matthias Miller  1:08:11
So we what we did was, if no anything that was checked, non material went to non material, anything that was checked. It was not non material, but excluded. I really, I forget the exact sorry, I don't have the exact thing, but we did map it across to the to the type based on what the check box had been.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:40
Yeah, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
They need to go in the cut. Yeah, that's a lumber stuff boards. No, they still going to stay because we put everything under material. And does it have to go

Unknown Speaker  1:08:56
to cut list? Anything?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:00
Stuff that obviously

Speaker 6  1:09:01
needs cut, yeah, I mean anything it needs. But they all

Speaker 5  1:09:06
went over when we were checking, they went to material only. And that's where the ones I just updated, I put, because we kind of worked through that and looked at other ones, and that's where they went to material only, like any lumber, like the ones that we rechecked,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21
sure is there, is there a problem with that?

Speaker 6  1:09:23
Well, material only in my my category would be like the mulch, right? That's material only, right? So we don't want

Speaker 5  1:09:32
to right, but we had decided that that's where that would go, because it wasn't going through assembly, but it technically needs to go to cut list only because we were unsure what was being used under that that wasn't going to mess things up,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
yeah, as long as they're cut less.

Speaker 5  1:09:45
But now all those that were non assembly, that the box was checked, any that we looked over went to material only, is that

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
okay? Correct? Matt, that's

Matthias Miller  1:09:55
probably true. Do you do we need to? I could switch all those over to I.

Speaker 5  1:10:00
Hang on, because I just have to get a handful this morning and put material only. So yeah, they would all get switched to list only, all the lumber. Oh, like your cut

Matthias Miller  1:10:10
here. Let's do this. We can. We can just clean it up real quick, right here. Let me. Let's do this, and let's do I should be showing item type and give you a way to search for item type, and I don't, and I'll make a list to do this. MERV, I'm going to share my screen and

Matthias Miller  1:10:36
All right, so are all of these items that should be switched to cut list only, or is there any that should not be?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
You see that yours

Speaker 1  1:10:48
here, let me here. No, here we got a burger lumber.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
Burger lumber. Here's the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
these are the ones I just did this morning.

Matthias Miller  1:10:59
These are all the material only items in the system

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
that'd be cut less, not only

Unknown Speaker  1:11:08
all of these George, whoops. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
Well, I don't think that's he must have already switched them, I don't know.

Speaker 6  1:11:24
Yeah, it's all cut lesson like, yeah, okay, four

Speaker 1  1:11:27
by 433 you cutting those four before shorts for time?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
All right? Didn't get answered. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
They're all fixed. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, you bet.

Speaker 6  1:11:45
And then just one quick question, that drop down box in the orders that you have a split box now, Matt, is that? Yeah. Can you explain that real quickly?

Matthias Miller  1:11:56
Yeah, so here's the reason why I added it the process, especially as we're introducing the new raw material handling for for when you have a splitter and stuff like that, it just makes it really complicated for me not to have more visibility into that, and so that can give you a visibility of what's going to happen on the cut list, If you want to drill down into the weeds, but if you don't, then just drag that thing down to the bottom of your screen and get out of the way and keep using it the way you always have been.

Speaker 6  1:12:30
Now, question, can you edit that? Where that bot, that box, is? You can't. You cannot edit there? No. Well, me and Merv were looking at, I don't know if it's yesterday or the day before it had the decimal point for the thickness, the width, but it didn't give you the length. Is there something missing in that box? Or it doesn't give you the length of that item,

Matthias Miller  1:12:54
the length. We don't push across the length. Once you put it in the I mean, this is technical detail, but once you push it across, it, it, it just looks up the length from from the item,

Speaker 6  1:13:05
gotcha, yeah, I probably won't even use it. But I think once I get done with all this yellow stuff, you know, man, it's sort of going to make life a lot easier. That's where I'm getting into this. That might help me with the box drop down box that you have there. But once they cast all this yellow editing and stuff like that, I think it's going to make life a lot easier.

Matthias Miller  1:13:32
Yes, hopefully, hopefully, hopefully. I can't guarantee an easy like though.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:39
Alright, man, alright, that. Bad, alright, thanks. Thanks. You guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
alright, man,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
yes, good. Think we're good.

Speaker 1  1:13:59
Alright, I'll be jumping up and down once all this catch up work is done.

Matthias Miller  1:14:03
Good, won't we all reef, alright. So then the last thing, the one more thing, for the for the prints, I need you to set up an AWS, an Amazon Cloud account for storage, for the prints,

Speaker 1  1:14:23
yeah, I'm gonna ask Amanda to help with that, but you can

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
let me see if she

Matthias Miller  1:14:32
like the she won't. She won't need it going forward, we just need to set it up for the back end. Okay, Amanda,

Speaker 1  1:14:50
so you're saying Amazon Cloud account,

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
yeah, it's called I can I can give you, I could send an email with you. Instructions for how to create the account, okay, and what or

Speaker 1  1:15:12
Yeah, is that? Is there a monthly fee for that?

Matthias Miller  1:15:16
There's no monthly fee. It's it's charges for based on the storage amount. And it's, it's really, I don't think you'll run more than five bucks a month, or five or 10 or, I don't know it's, it's dirt, dirt cheap. I don't even remember what it is. S3 storage costs. It's,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:41
you pay

Matthias Miller  1:15:44
you, you're barely going to run, I can't imagine you're even going to run a buck a month. Okay? It's like, it's like 2.3 cents per gig of data. So for a flash drive, you're paying a quarter, a month, or something, which, which is one of the reasons why we use it. It's just a, it's a, I guess, enterprise quality, low cost storage, rather than, because these PDFs are so big, we can put them in the database, but that that's going to add several I don't need. I don't even know, several 100 a month, if we put it there, just not useful. Yeah?

Speaker 1  1:16:30
Amazon Cloud, yeah. I mean, if that's a simple thing for you, send that over. You're easy enough. Yeah, go from there. So we set up that account, and then do you need access to it?

Matthias Miller  1:16:44
I will need access to it. So probably the easiest thing is, if you guys can sign up, and then I can log in, and then I'm going to want to create a separate user for myself. I just prefer, well, yeah, I would prefer that.

Matthias Miller  1:17:06
And then, but, and so we, I'll probably need your help getting in the first time, because it'll probably have a phone number verification or something. But then, then I can get a user set up that it's tied to my phone number, and we're, you know, we're good to go from there.

Speaker 1  1:17:24
Okay? So we'll sign it up and then give you access, and then that's, and that is in order for you to develop that piece. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  1:17:35
Or, yeah, I mean, it's just to give you the way to to store the prints in a cost effective way. That's That's the bottom line, and that'll let you guys and as soon as I configure that, it's not, it shouldn't take, take much at all, but you'll be able to start uploading prints, and then we can at least get the prints in the system so that we have them stored somewhere. And then once we have them stored, we can start assembling prints based off the cut list.

Speaker 3  1:18:10
Yeah, well, in between, in between.

Speaker 1  1:18:14
Well, somewhere in the process of, well, the prints are being they're working as they are. But if we cleaned up the prints, made them, made them more. How would you say similar or more template based would be, I think it would be good for future orders and even for current, honestly, for the guys out there right now, I'm not sure if it matters to them, or does or doesn't matter

Speaker 3  1:18:55
what it just it, just go ahead. You said you were saying the

Matthias Miller  1:18:59
only reason I care about that, I mean, okay, the number one reason I care about this is from a liability perspective. Let's get digital copies of your prints in a secure location, right, right? And then number two, yes. And then number two, if it seems like a very simple, easy, efficiency game to give a button that says, give me the prints for the cut list and have it, have it, put all that stuff together in a single packet that you can just print off. And then step three, in my mind, rather than try to take a huge bite off, like you can always step step three could be a process to say, let's get these prints templatized a little more. Yeah. But happy to be happy to be argued with. That's, that's my thoughts.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
Oh my gosh, I can't even I.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Can't believe we if, if we had a fire,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:06
see, that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:08
that's crazy. That's

Matthias Miller  1:20:10
it. That's, that's insanity. It's insanity. So that is, that is the number one. I mean, that's, I made a comment to Rick when I was there about losing sleep at night, about the idea of that. Yeah, anyway, pretty sure he's gotten ulcer from that. I don't know, good that. Some it might be even. I can, I can even. I don't mind hopping on a call with Amanda to get that

Speaker 4  1:20:44
set up then, well, you already sent the email, right? I said I

Matthias Miller  1:20:48
sent the email to you. I'll forward

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
it to her. We'll get it. We'll get we'll get going on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:57
Yeah, that's good. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:05
No, no, that's it, yeah, look a Miller from the other day. All that was

Unknown Speaker  1:21:17
done, done.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:22
Yeah, the multipliers that's taken care of, right?

Matthias Miller  1:21:26
I think so it would, it would. It would be good for us to or for somebody. We can't do it now, but for somebody to triple check that, probably Yeah, it would be as simple as finding one of those items in history. You know, go with George, find one of those items in history and just make sure everything looks, look at what's going to be sent over and make sure it looks right, yeah, or just keep your eye open for the next time you run one of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:55
But, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:21:57
yeah, yeah. I haven't heard anything from him so, but I can, yeah, okay,

Speaker 3  1:22:07
yeah, that's it. We're good. Okay, thanks, man, yep, you bet.

Speaker 2  1:22:13
All right, we'll talk. You got this. Have your day. You too. Man, see ya. Thanks, man, you.
