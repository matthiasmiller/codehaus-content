Matthias Miller  00:18
Hey, apologies, note. Let me. Let me switch over my Bluetooth again.

Unknown Speaker  00:37
All right,

Unknown Speaker  00:45
sorry you were saying,

Speaker 1  00:48
Oh, I started editing your document. Bottom of

Matthias Miller  00:52
the funnel, Facebook leads were the worst kind of leads.

Speaker 1  00:56
Oh, so I was basically, I'm saying they're the worst quality. And like literally everybody of all stripes agrees with this, they're the worst quality for two reasons. One, the human side, they've just had almost no contact or context before they opted in. And then two people, Facebook will auto populate their phone number and email, and it's often a junk email, and then people will often type in a junk email, and so like, literally, it's just very low intent, very cold, very trashy quality leads in general, I am not saying they don't work, and there is Things that can be done, like turning on the filters, which is the questions and filters, which is exactly what you showed me in that doc you sent me a day or two ago, and using the high intent style lead forms, it does help. And I'm certainly not saying that they're all bad. I think they can work. It's just that on the spectrum of what is available to buy with money from ads. They're always the worst. The other thing that goes along with that, then is that in my industry, the media buying industry, probably the most common problem is not running traffic. Traffic always runs like even a bad media buyer can get clicks, right? It's the client saying your clicks didn't get me leads or the leads are bad. Is the classic problem, and it's very well known that the comment the leads are bad is almost always coming from a business owner or or salesperson who really is no good at sales and just wants to take orders like, like, this is the 8020 of all the problems in the media buying industry. Your leads are bad. Well, no, my leads are not bad. You just don't have a system, a process, or any ability to follow up, or, for that matter, even answer the phone in a timely fashion. So, so that's why I have a general purpose aversion to to lead formats when we have these conversations in general. But I'm not at all saying that they don't work or can't be made to work. It's all a matter of, will enough people in their particular area actually care and give a good email and phone number and be interested, and then will they the prospect actually work those leads?

Matthias Miller  03:39
So I think on the will they work the leads. I think we can, I think we can turn up the ante and make that an expectation you are going to work the leads. I like that a lot. Yep, so I don't have a problem with that. And I think she's got this dude who loves to sell, and I'll tell him. I was like, look for you guys to call this a failure. Here's what you want to do every time a lead comes in, check a box, and you you call in twice a day, and I'll give them a manual sales sequence, and I'm like, write it down on a paper and and try to get a hold of these folks. And be aggressive. Be hungry. Be as hungry as you say you are, and then show me these, and then let's talk through what's going on. Um, yeah, so, I mean, I think that's very doable, but what I'm worried about, but

Speaker 1  04:35
quick side note that is what hardly any media buyer ever does, that there are some with gumption and energy, whatever, but most media buyers don't want to do Hey. And now bring me, you know, bring those leads back to me, and let's talk about it. That's an awesome um, point of differentiation for you

Matthias Miller  04:54
well, and I probably should be charging more. But then the goal is, let's get them up to where the. One they deserve to pay so and I really hope that's not just a bunch of missionary work, but

Speaker 1  05:10
well, by the way, this part, what you're talking about right now is, is definitely Round Table stuff. Like, take this to a round table, and if and if all else fails, if all else fails, um, we'll get in there. We'll learn. And as we move forward, we will change how we accept and onboard clients. And over time, we'll, we'll do, we'll do Perry's famous thing of fire your bottom 10% of your customers every

Matthias Miller  05:40
year, well. And I think in addition to that, it's also a look, guys, this is part of your skin in the game. You have to do that. This is part of the refund requirement or the cancelation requirement. You have to, have to have to do this. And here's a form where every single day, you're submitting your activities. And is it fun? No, but eating bologna sandwiches and ramen noodles isn't fun either. So pick your fun, because I think this whole thing can be systematized. I do, yep, okay, but so the basic thing is, here. I guess here is the, here's the, here's the, okay, we don't know anything about what CPL is going to be. We don't know we just know very, very little. We don't know what conversion rates are going to be

Speaker 1  06:37
for. I actually can't. I know enough about the industry that I can make a reasonable guess of what they should be. Um, CPL on lead format should definitely be sub $50 probably in the $20 range, if we were talking about standard portable buildings. Now, I suspect that the pole barn Mark metal pole barn market is much smaller, and it's a much higher, it's certainly, it's a much higher ticket item, right? It's got to be. So I would expect easily, double or triple that for pole barns. But I have a hard time seeing that it would be above, like, I mean, a crazy high end would be a couple 100. I think I'd be I'd be shocked if we were in pole barn ads and we had like a $500 CPL, I just don't think that's gonna

Matthias Miller  07:27
happen. That's on lead ads, but on Google ads, Google ads,

Speaker 1  07:35
I'm thinking 80 to 100 I can do some estimating all that. By the way, Google gives us enough data to at least guess at costs. So do you want me to

Unknown Speaker  07:46
do that? Maybe I'll

Unknown Speaker  07:49
take a quick stab at it later.

Matthias Miller  07:53
So where's the

Unknown Speaker  07:55
location of this particular company

Matthias Miller  08:01
she is in New I think it's New Hope Georgia or Good Hope Georgia.

Speaker 1  08:10
Good Hope Georgia. And I'll go do my own keyword research, but just tell me real quick, off the top of your head, a couple good works, pole barn,

Matthias Miller  08:21
bull barn, garage, RV shelter, car park,

Unknown Speaker  08:28
carport. Well,

Matthias Miller  08:31
carports are not really metal buildings. Those are generally lower ticket shop. Maybe, I don't know if that that's might be hard to target,

Matthias Miller  08:55
and She seems to have a fairly good size radius. I

Matthias Miller  09:04
She says, pre delivering setup to northeast Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina. Do

Matthias Miller  10:17
Sorry about that.

Speaker 1  10:21
Are you there? Yep, I'm here. Network issues. I was in the middle of asking you for a couple other keyword ideas, and we ended at carport.

Matthias Miller  10:32
So carport, I think is would be a lower end structure, not necessarily a steel structure. Shop, RV. What do you call it an RV storage or RV, whatever those things are,

Unknown Speaker  10:48
warehouse,

Matthias Miller  10:52
barn, Dominion, I

Matthias Miller  11:03
I mean, yeah, still, car ports, big car ports, typically end up being lower ticket

Speaker 1  11:15
compared to this, okay, obviously, more of The car ports, but that's, that's good, okay, okay, I'm assuming this is somebody you talked to today from the Georgia campaigns.

Unknown Speaker  11:26
Yep, that's right.

Unknown Speaker  11:28
Nice, very nice.

Unknown Speaker  11:32
Okay, I'll do a little cost estimate research on that. I

Matthias Miller  11:49
I have, okay, just FYI. I threw a bunch of stuff on the website. Basically, we did my website throughout the about page website. So

Speaker 2  12:00
So

Matthias Miller  12:03
which site code house.

Matthias Miller  12:15
Oh, Kirsten. Person has self forwarding to on my number to some random place that when I tried to call, I just got a voicemail, I probably need to get on an agency call to figure out if I can change the forwarding on that.

Unknown Speaker  12:33
I would change it right now in a second. I

Matthias Miller  12:36
mean, I don't mind changing it if I'm

Unknown Speaker  12:42
clicking Click in just a moment. What did? A okay? I

Unknown Speaker  13:07
there. I'm still here and I'm still clicking.

Speaker 1  13:18
By the way, did you happen to notice that one person who was complaining about the, why is this an 844, number? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  13:30
I told him, Hey, it's because we have a CRM and it's what came I mean, it's what we happen to use, yeah. I mean, if, if I'm good, just updating it, I don't mind just updating it. I just want to make

Speaker 1  13:47
sure before you check it. I think it's right. I'm in the screen right now. Do you want to tell me what number

Matthias Miller  13:54
you want? No, I mean, I got it pulled up right here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  13:56
yep, all right, you can add

Speaker 1  13:59
the Whisper message and all that's kind of cool, by the way. You don't have to, but, you know, you know that way, when you answer your phone, you know it says, like, CRM or something, and you know exactly where this is coming from.

Matthias Miller  14:09
Well, it passes on the passes on the 844, number, so they just have that as a contact, okay? And then it does have a call connect. Um, but if I put this in and my phone lead, phone, 844-974-2641, I think I lost some folks scanning because of

Unknown Speaker  14:34
that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  14:38
like they thought it was a scan, 844-974-2641, okay, you wouldn't want to call that number, would you? And just see if, yep, one moment you.

Unknown Speaker  15:05
1-844-974-2641,

Unknown Speaker  15:14
ready, set, I'm

Unknown Speaker  15:33
Hello, Yep, thank you.

Speaker 1  15:59
Yeah, so maybe when the call connects, take a breath or count to two before you say hello.

Matthias Miller  16:03
All right, sounds good. Um, so, all right, what else do we need to solve? Is there anything else? I mean, I still have barely followed up with leads at all, so, I mean, that's really what I should be doing now, but

Speaker 1  16:21
probably and so I only due to the cross cross wires, I guess we'll call it with Georgia. There was only about 31 fresh new leads today that fired off, but I have the feeling you still have some backlog from before, so that's probably fine. How many do you want me to run for tomorrow,

Matthias Miller  16:48
if I get through? I mean, 5200, probably. Okay.

Speaker 1  16:54
Sounds good. Of all the people we have talked to so far that seem helpful or interested. Where are they at? Are they waiting for offers? Are they waiting for a contract to sign? Waiting

Matthias Miller  17:09
for waiting for offers? I'm talking to Jeremy this afternoon. He's the guy who's got a little bit more money to spend, I think.

Unknown Speaker  17:22
And

Matthias Miller  17:26
well, I texted will will Adams. I had to go hunt down Kevin. I couldn't find any call notes for him, and which, anyway, wasn't good. Um. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:43
I

Matthias Miller  17:48
don't know lead gen. Lead Gen is totally a thing

Unknown Speaker  17:51
for these small folks, meaning

Speaker 1  17:55
that, yes, they do want lead gen. Yeah, that's good. That's actually really good news. Okay, so Well, I do have a few other things on my plate today in general, but none of them are time bound. Do you I kind of feel, I certainly do want you to keep working the leads, GHL and all that. But it would seem like we should push to really wrap up an offer and stick it in front of one of the handful of interested parties. Don't you think?

Matthias Miller  18:32
I mean, I think I have what it takes if you're happy with my doc, and then turn that into having both sign it

Speaker 1  18:39
sorry. Is that the doc from yesterday? Yeah, I'm going to my Docs right now. It's the one called dealer, online marketing, yes,

Matthias Miller  18:48
yes,

Speaker 1  18:52
I'm opening it on the screen, or you can open it, yeah, you want, you want to share your screen and, yeah, funny. While we were talking about Facebook ads earlier, I was showing

Speaker 1  19:12
samples in chanting, and I was thinking, yes, there's plenty of Facebook ads. Honeys. All right. I

Matthias Miller  19:26
guess you see, got it. Let's see I can

Unknown Speaker  19:33
turn the

Speaker 1  19:41
there. Thanks, yes, and I have already read it. I was happy with it, but let's just go through it together. If you don't mind shooting for so and so don't share. Yep, got this. Yep. I love the approach of putting. Seeing a little bit of a storyline. You know, what you've done here is you've taken a contract and you've turned it into a little bit of a sales letter. And I've seen quite a few viewers out there doing this. I think it's good. I do think it's a little bit long, not not terribly long. But I wonder, if there's any part of this, can you lose 20% of the text

Matthias Miller  20:28
of the whole text, or this text of

Speaker 1  20:30
the storyline, part of the text, like, like, like, yes, including our approach and all of it

Matthias Miller  20:37
here, numbers. Let's do this. Can you reduce the we're going to try a one because I'm having fun with it. Can you reduce? Can you shorten this by 20% while keeping the message and your tongue? I

Matthias Miller  21:08
shifting my strategy. That's funny. It comes up with wonky statuses.

Speaker 1  21:26
While it's thinking I'm going to go back to reading the original on my screen, I'm

Unknown Speaker  22:03
we make a sacrifice. Almost wonder if that is a

Unknown Speaker  22:12
well, let's is that church

Speaker 1  22:13
land jargon that does a common America that means

Matthias Miller  22:18
we sometimes pay for part of the management

Unknown Speaker  22:25
fees

Matthias Miller  22:27
up front. We sometimes I

Speaker 1  22:30
was thinking more like, it's like, take the hit, right? It's, it's, it's, absorb the pain, the loss, the

Matthias Miller  22:55
Oh, You're gracious. You're really thinking about this thing,

Unknown Speaker  22:59
trying to model and

Speaker 1  23:37
uh, network issues. Again, are you still there? Yep, um, anyway, it carried on for a long time, and I got frustrated, so on a whim, I typed into the box, wake up, and it said, Sorry, and it actually did it like somehow I broke the loop. That's funny.

Unknown Speaker  24:02
All right, here is

Matthias Miller  24:09
all right.

Unknown Speaker  24:13
You mind popping that into an alternate Google Doc or i

Unknown Speaker  24:24
Okay, so here's

Matthias Miller  24:27
this. I don't know that it's actually 20% shorter. It does this, by

Speaker 1  24:33
the way. I've tried giving it exact word counts and such, and it'll be off by a mile.

Matthias Miller  24:40
Chat. GPT seems to be doing better. I.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
Oh, be expensive. Say, uh so I was,

Matthias Miller  25:18
can you hear me right here, today, right there, yep, yes, Yep, exactly. I

Speaker 1  25:52
we think that I like it in general, one second I'm copying and pasting something here,

Unknown Speaker  26:02
what's the word count

Speaker 1  26:12
on that word count The original is 256

Matthias Miller  26:18
is 100 words off

Speaker 1  26:22
by the I couldn't really less the number, it is substantially less, yeah, okay, I like it. Are you happy with it? I It is a little choppier, you know, a little less natural. But I think it helps to shorten it.

Matthias Miller  26:37
I think it's fine. I

Unknown Speaker  27:06
Okay,

Matthias Miller  27:08
trying to do the same thing with the next

Speaker 1  27:12
one. Not yet. Let me look at something, because I think the bullet points are good. Well, fill in the gaps is really important

Matthias Miller  27:25
leads,

Speaker 1  27:27
you could combine Google and Facebook, so from Google or Facebook will help you find them profitably.

Matthias Miller  27:42
You you let me do it. They got it. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  27:55
This means that sometimes

Matthias Miller  27:57
this is a repeat. I

Speaker 1  28:07
How about sorting that down to like we'll actually invest into your business, because we view this as a partnership, okay? And then what's wrong with that is some people might misunderstand the word invest, because we're not going To give them money. Um,

Matthias Miller  28:29
we will. Actually could over

Matthias Miller  28:50
okay, that's long.

Speaker 1  28:57
Explain the pay for line as if I was a five year old.

Unknown Speaker  29:06
To me like, can you just tell me? What are you thinking there?

Matthias Miller  29:17
I mean, it's the idea of, you go to Walmart, and you say, or you go to the local toy store, you say, Can I have this toy? And you say, well, that toy is $10 Oh, and I only have eight. And the owner looks at you and slaps $2 down on the on the on the on the checkout lane, and says, Oh, that's okay. I'll pay, I'll pay for part of your toy.

Speaker 1  29:45
Very cute, but you're not planning on handing them any car in any cash or debit card, right? Because you're not going to insert your own card into their Google Ads account, right? Right? What you really mean? Mean, and I'm not referring to sales angles. I mean literally, apples to apples. What you really mean is that you have skills, assets, training, station available that is going to help their business, and you're going to give above and beyond what they're paying for in cash value in order to help them go the last mile. Is that right? Yeah, it would be kind of, I think, a better analogy speaking of last mile and logistics. You know how in the world of logistics, they use that phrase last mile to mean all the troublesome stuff that happens after the train is gone its 1000 miles and arrived at the station. It would be better. Analogy would be like and and the person on the other end, instead of making the delivery driver drive all the way there, comes, hops in the driver's seat and finishes driving the truck with the load the last mile. But they don't ever hand the trucking company money for that. They're just doing some of the work right. Sometimes we actually choose to pay for some of our own training and services. Occasionally, we'll

Matthias Miller  31:16
even invest in your growth by covering the cost of training or services ourselves. It's not covering the entire cost, because when succeed, we succeed together as two partners, but we could take that. I don't know if sometimes, sometimes we've even invest in our clients growth by covering some of the cost of training or services ourselves.

Unknown Speaker  31:50
I like that a lot better, and I think it's very clear

Matthias Miller  31:53
when you succeed, we view this as a partnership. I

Unknown Speaker  32:03
as a success oriented partnership.

Matthias Miller  32:14
What do you mean by success oriented I'm going to flip this around to

Unknown Speaker  32:19
you five year old.

Speaker 1  32:23
Well, I would assume that success in any general sense, when talking about business, is money, profit and revenue, right, growing your business. But think maybe most people don't see it that way. Is it too vague? It's not. We need a that's eighth grade material. We need a fourth grade version.

Matthias Miller  32:48
I mean, could we say

Speaker 1  32:52
for a moment you were going to write when you succeed? We succeed. Am I right about that? Something like that? Yeah, and that's more fourth grade. So maybe we should switch back to that.

Unknown Speaker  33:06
Okay? So continue. No, wait, wait, wait, as a part partnership, all right, that's fine. I messed that up. We're looking to succeed as you succeed as a partnership. I

Matthias Miller  33:25
was actually going to say we're looking to grow with you as you Grow.

Unknown Speaker  33:40
Hmm,

Unknown Speaker  33:47
what other?

Unknown Speaker  34:02
The ship when you when you win,

Matthias Miller  34:39
you got all garbly for quite a while, so I don't know what you said. Oh,

Speaker 1  34:44
I'm sorry. Um, when you win, we win, or we all win. Do you like that?

Matthias Miller  34:50
No limit. I mean, only if we grow with them. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  34:55
oh, yeah. You think somehow that departs from you?

Matthias Miller  35:00
So maybe an investor in class scope by carrying some of the cost of training and services.

Matthias Miller  35:09
Ourselves do this. We do this knowing that we'll be able to grow with you as you grow. That's really janky, but

Speaker 1  35:23
that's fine, it? It? Yeah, I like the knowing that that's good, knowing

Matthias Miller  35:29
that we only grow when you grow. What do you think? Like it? Yes,

Speaker 1  35:38
yes, yes, as long as we would invest in our clients growth by covering some of the costs. Blah, costs spot on. That's very clear of training or services ourselves, we do This knowing that we only Grow.

Matthias Miller  36:01
Yeah, yeah, okay. I

Matthias Miller  36:44
I have no idea what you're saying. You need to join me to call you No. I have no idea what you're saying. I

Unknown Speaker  37:03
instead of knowing that is it even more clear to See.

Unknown Speaker  45:09
Hey, Krista,

Matthias Miller  45:16
I am not able to hear you. I

Speaker 3  45:41
There you go. There we go. I don't know why. Every time I'm like, it just doesn't quite want to cooperate for me. But at least this time I'm like, on on time, instead of scrambling at the moment.

Matthias Miller  45:56
Yes, all right, did you want to just jump in and walk through these together. Yeah. Okay, perfect. So here Allison's initial checks went away, and the reminder and the due date for FDIC fingerprints was a week earlier, and the reminder date way earlier.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
Does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  46:35
Yeah, that does sound right

Unknown Speaker  46:41
for David,

Matthias Miller  46:43
same, same, exact, same thing, yeah. Alexis RSX Offender Registry went away. Perfect grace. New alerts for the CBI, FBI central registry board, same with Josiah.

Matthias Miller  47:12
Yes, that hang

Speaker 3  47:15
on one second here, I just want to cross reference something sure i

Speaker 3  47:26
What is Oh, CBS, okay, that's what I was not getting. Okay, yes, that is correct. Okay,

Matthias Miller  47:35
Steven and Kendra's sex offender registry, both national and Colorado, went away. Okay, yeah, Austin's sex offender registry moved from 20 December to

Unknown Speaker  47:54
March,

Speaker 3  47:59
yeah, and that yes because of their their certification date changed. I think, I think that's the reason. Let me double check that.

Matthias Miller  48:12
Think it's based on recall correctly, it's based in the last date completed it now maybe,

Speaker 3  48:20
yeah, that holds out because their certification date had been previously in December, and it changed to May, so that those dates would hold out. Those

Matthias Miller  48:29
dates would hold out. Okay, so then Kara would have the same thing, but then also has her CBI. And FBI have not been marked as for 20. 20, I guess. Oh, interesting. Let me look that up.

Unknown Speaker  48:50
Oh, no, they haven't been Huh, okay, yeah, that is correct.

Matthias Miller  48:56
All right. Good. Well, those are the changes, so I will, if you're happy with that, I will work with Leslie to get an update rolled up.

Unknown Speaker  49:06
Yeah, that works.

Matthias Miller  49:09
Sweet. That was easy.

Speaker 3  49:12
Pain free. Pain free. Yeah, okay, no, that looks good. I appreciate it. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  49:20
you're welcome. Thank you. Yeah, you bet.

Unknown Speaker  49:32
I know. I'm like, oh, here we go. I'll leave.

Matthias Miller  49:34
Okay, sounds good? You

Speaker 1  52:23
Hey, can you hear me this time? Yep, hey, we'll try this again for a while.

Unknown Speaker  52:28
All right,

Matthias Miller  52:31
this first sentence is clunky. Was

Speaker 1  52:33
that? Sorry, the person you were just trying to talk

Matthias Miller  52:38
to? It was a software client that I needed to switch some stuff away with and we had lots of time, but blacked out and only needed Five minutes. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:59
Let's YEAH.

Matthias Miller  56:04
Are you can you hear me? Yes, that you be so busy selling. Do you rather have us run your marketing? Yep, then do it yourself. However. Um,

Unknown Speaker  56:26
however, why

Speaker 1  56:30

Unknown Speaker  57:27
don't think we do.

Matthias Miller  57:32
If you're agreeable to these terms,

Speaker 2  57:39
we are. I and then

Matthias Miller  57:50
that's where, okay, I'll let you go over this.

Unknown Speaker  57:59
You're down to the price, right? I'm

Unknown Speaker  58:32
um,

Unknown Speaker  58:40
yeah, very good, yep.

Unknown Speaker  58:51
I don't think, at the moment, there is nothing in the text above that explains the standard versus starter? Is there

Speaker 1  59:07
Soft Start? Maybe we need to add a little line right here. If you're agreeable to these terms, we also following customized pricing. And then right here, explain that we want to help them with an easy start or something like that. So

Speaker 1  59:35
I'm not claiming to have the right way to say this, but basically, we need to explain the standard versus starter somehow,

Speaker 1  59:51
I kind of like the idea of calling it easy, easy start, or maybe there's a better word than easy, but like something that makes it sound like, Hey, we're. Were were taking some of the pain out, or giving you the simple version or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
I mean,

Speaker 1  1:00:19
I would almost put easy starting quotes like as if it was a registered trademark. You know what I mean? Yeah, if you think of a better word than Easy, please do tell you.

Matthias Miller  1:00:58
Can we talk about I

Speaker 2  1:01:00
yeah,

Speaker 1  1:01:07
I really liked where you're going with that was a minimal investment. Up was the minimal initial investment I

Matthias Miller  1:01:24
Yeah, that's right, but so

Speaker 1  1:01:41
without using the words low hanging fruit, I would like to inject there in the middle. So after the word initial investment, I would like to inject the concept that this gets it puts money in your pocket. Which funds you getting to the next stage the standard pricing. Yeah, there you go. Yep, you know, put puts leads and sales into your Business. Oh, that's fine. You

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
to fund the what i

Matthias Miller  1:03:16
This isn't said, right, But until you can afford the standard pricing

Speaker 1  1:03:22
that's yes, I agree. It's not said, right? That's negative. We need the positive spin version of the exact same thing. So instead of implying that they can't afford it, we want to imply that we're or adding jet fuel to their machine, or starting the engines or right like, you know, what's the positive spin on that same idea, putting money into your pocket so you can Move to the next level, a full service with standard pricing. I

Matthias Miller  1:04:07
have no idea what you said, but

Unknown Speaker  1:04:11
you got it is the audio breaking up again?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:04:17
I'm sorry for the trouble today. It's always bad. Normally, this bad. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
What about that that makes sense to you?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:57
Move you? I. The

Speaker 1  1:05:08
is get better than move putting money in your pocket,

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
search your sales, market system, putting money into your pocket to bump your business. By the way, they had this slow initial jump starts, igniting your growth engine. Putting money in your pocket as we build momentum towards standard pricing, money in your pocket to build momentum for full service at standard pricing.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
Yes, I like that. That's good.

Matthias Miller  1:05:50
I do. I

Speaker 1  1:05:52
do kind of like the word marketing, like full service. I

Matthias Miller  1:06:03
Okay, I like that to full service, not just, I don't want to just immediately go

Unknown Speaker  1:06:12
ahead. That's fine, but what

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
you were saying you didn't

Matthias Miller  1:06:29
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
Yes, I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
I'm good with that. Is there anything about that? You don't I think

Matthias Miller  1:06:51
it's fine. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
all right?

Matthias Miller  1:07:16
And then I'm guessing you want to look over the numbers.

Speaker 1  1:07:24
I am looking right now, and it's, I think it's the same as what we talked about yesterday. So it's all good yesterday.

Speaker 1  1:07:49
Okay, so, so let's do it like this. So first, are you happy with the numbers?

Matthias Miller  1:07:56
Um, I'm looking at this, and I'm really there's a little bit of a catch 22 year, because so many of these people need marketing before I can sell them any kind of high margin sales training. I got it, and I'm not sure what to do about that.

Speaker 1  1:08:21
Okay, so it's kind of like you need to say to them, Mr. Prospect, you need leads, and you need help closing the leads. It's two prongs on the same fork. We need to start with both, right or or, do you already have leads? Yes, I do. Oh, they will get your leads from and then, if you like the answer, all you need to sell them today is training in ops. Uh, like the answer? Or there's an opportunity you sell them lead gen as well.

Matthias Miller  1:09:01
I think the only the caveat, I might say, is, oh, so you can't afford the $47 a month plan. Let's enroll you in the we'll, we'll, we'll cover the 447 I guess, I don't know, and we'll roll you into the $77 month plan or something. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1  1:09:31
I like that, by the way, with with the, you know, $77 month and you have to commit to at least whatever, six months, nine months, 12 months, something right?

Speaker 1  1:09:53
I I think I've said everything that needs to be said about prime. Thing, but in probably in the mood to get started. So if we need to offer $500 a month starter pricing, fake ads and that like, does that move the needle? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
for some of these, for some of these startups, that's so for this guy, this guy, it's not a deal. But for some of my prospects, yes, that's going to be,

Speaker 1  1:10:40
if I'm a business owner, if I'm a business owner, and you're talking to me, and I look at this, I'm going to go, oh, wow, I can Google ads for a whole lot less than I can get Facebook ads.

Matthias Miller  1:10:54
No, no, I'm not going to price out anything. I'm not doing that. I'm the Easy Start. Pricing is all going to be customized. Oh, every time, yeah, pretty much. Or maybe there's a few stock ones, but

Unknown Speaker  1:11:09
like,

Matthias Miller  1:11:13
Yeah, I mean, if the fee here is 1000 the other fee is going to be

Speaker 1  1:11:17
1000 Okay, good. Well, let's, let's just keeps them at parity. And I really am looking for 1000 or 750 but if you need to, we can go all the way down to 500 it takes to make the sale. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:11:37
okay, keep in mind that I'm not.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40
I am not.

Matthias Miller  1:11:43
I would rather under promise and ever deliver and but I also,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:50
I just, I don't know,

Matthias Miller  1:11:59
here's where I feel a little bit torn, because I feel like I'm pushing you down the price, but I also feel a lot, um,

Matthias Miller  1:12:48
still, yeah, I'm sorry. Still here, still thinking

Speaker 1  1:12:55
I'm fine. There's nothing wrong. You wanted to tell me what bothers you? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:13:02
I'm going to switch to let me get out of this office. I've been in coupd too long. I'm going to switch to my zoom on my phone. Yes, you

Matthias Miller  1:13:34
all right, can you hear me? Are you able to hear me? I can still hear you. Yes, all right. So here's where I feel, a bit torn. I think, I think I have a pretty intuitive grasp that I'm not.

Matthias Miller  1:14:02
I I'm not selling $250 a month management that to somebody who can afford 1500 yep, I have a pretty good sense of the economics, and I don't know what to optimize for. So there's a whole host of things at play here. One, I may be overacting. I don't think I am, I may be overreacting that to past experiences such as two point where pigs get get fat and Hogs get slaughtered. And in retrospect, I think I put together hog deals and there were other. Shoes at play that did not that contributed to all of that. And so it's not strictly that, but I do think market pricing, just given margins and everything else. I just don't think the economics Well, I don't know long story. It's maybe a little gun shy of just coming straight out of the gate, charging exorbitant prices.

Speaker 1  1:15:30
And I am in full agreement with that, by the way, like I do still want whale clients, I still hope we're going to cross paths with somebody who can spend five, 710, 15,000 a month, and let us do all the things we wanted to do that we never got around to YouTube and everything else, right? But, but I'm assuming that that's one out of 100 so we're really talking about the 99 and for the 99 I'm in complete agreement. Like, okay, true point, we learned lessons from true point, let's not make the mistake again. I'm totally on board that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:16:10
so, so I feel like I don't know exactly how to interpret your comments. I think I don't know what to do. Besides, I Okay, it might be okay. Pragmatically, I could be getting ourselves into trouble because, you know, it's, it's going to be, we're going to be scaling up 20 clients at this price.

Speaker 1  1:16:39
And that does intimidate me, just a little, it that does intimidate me just a little, uh, not, not, not hopelessly, but that's pushing it hard on the on the workload.

Matthias Miller  1:16:52
Yep, now we can say that we only enroll one client like this every single week, and we can say the next slot for onboarding is in three weeks, especially At the 500 level. It does pace it out.

Matthias Miller  1:17:29
Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:17:33
well, I'm literally looking at my cash flow over here as well. I would like to not do any pacing at the very, very beginning, and we can add pacing in a week or two or three when, when we actually have some funds and some progress. And can give a because maybe it's two a week, right? Like we don't actually know. I can guess. I can give a good guess, but we don't have concrete bandwidth issues just yet, right? So I would rather like get the first 3456, through the door, and then in a week or two or three, we can talk about total workload versus revenue, versus what it's going to take to grow. And should we do that by changing the pricing or by putting the throttle on right, like we I think we should put that off a week or two or three,

Matthias Miller  1:18:29
yep. Alright, so here's and so I guess here's where I'm at. I get what you're saying about raising prices. I have been in such a deep rethink of value and pricing and all of that stuff like I would like, I understand There's an irreducible complexity at some level. But if I we have clients like Cody with Yoders. I think it ran better ads blind on Facebook than their agency did. So I think maybe I'm I'm asking you just a little bit to say, Jonathan, I know you like striving for excellence, and you're extremely smart here. Here's how I'll describe it, but, but drive it down to a kindergarten level like that. It's not a rocket science market. I have developed. I worked with developers I have my brother's business partner was bringing home library laundry baskets of library books from the library every week when he was about five years old.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
Wow. Uh. And

Matthias Miller  1:20:01
his dad's Japanese, his mom's very intelligent, and developers like him are wonderful for solving really difficult problems, and they're just atrocious at solving simple, not complicated problems. And I guess my so there's a few things I guess I'm trying I'm trying to communicate. Number one, I think you're really smart, you have a lot of expertise. I think there's part of you that likes solving really complicated marketing problems, and I just don't want you to burn yourself out trying to over deliver for for these startups, because I just think getting the top of the market some basic funnels, I think it's going to go a long way. And yeah, we might be mistaken, but that's what I think. The other thing too is I don't know exactly how to respond to your pricing concerns. The best thing I know to do is I just got to trust my judgment, and if I have resistant

Unknown Speaker  1:21:02
to,

Matthias Miller  1:21:05
I mean, if we start selling sticks, and we get in and, like, the economics, you're like, dude, how many buildings you sell? You sold what? All right, like, if there's any resistance asking them for more of the share, I'll go figure out where that resistance coming from and deal with it. But sorry, I should let you talk. But my point is I don't know anything to do besides just trust my gut and then learn from it and go from there. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:21:31
so I have just one point, and that's that I'm totally happy with all that I get the feeling that I've done or said something that is causing some cognitive dissonance for you, like you're you're worried that I need something else or want something else. I'm happy with all that that I say, Yes, I want more money and yes, I don't want to do 100 of these for $1 each. That can't be done. I'm totally in startup mode. I'm totally good with low prices, especially at the very beginning. And like, you better believe I trust your gut judgment on the fly and all that. So, yes, like, what? What's not the comment.

Matthias Miller  1:22:13
The comment was your in depth explanation about how 750 versus 500 and differential price increases, and I don't know all that stuff

Speaker 1  1:22:25
like, save that for next week. Alright, let's get started at $500

Matthias Miller  1:22:32
I will table it until you bring it back up. How's that?

Speaker 1  1:22:35
Yes, I love that, and I will bring it back up soon, but not this week, and probably not next week.

Matthias Miller  1:22:43
All right, all right, good, good. So I have and then setup. Setup is, you're wanting 1000

Matthias Miller  1:23:00
I'm assuming it makes some difference, okay, like this guy that I just talked to, I, I guess I do need to know bottom limits on setup. Like, I'm assuming that, if it literally is,

Matthias Miller  1:23:22
well, I don't know what I can at some point, at some point

Speaker 1  1:23:30
that up is chocolate sauce on top of the ice cream. Okay, it's really delicious. It helps way more than it looks. But it is never expected, and it is not part of the fundamental economics at this point. All right, fair enough, and it makes for a wonderful negotiation piece. We normally charge $650 for setup, but if you agree right now, I'll do it for 275 right or literally. And

Matthias Miller  1:23:57
we could bump it down the road, but I'm willing to defer that 90 days from now, when we've actually proven that this works. Sure.

Speaker 1  1:24:04
I mean, it works best. Set up fees work and help the most at the beginning, because the workload is the worst at the beginning. But again, I'm in, I'm totally in, let's get started mode. So if you're if your sales gut tells you that or your confidence level is where it's at then sure, say 90 days and at least we know something come in April, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
I, um,

Speaker 1  1:24:33
I am trying to feed the kids here at the beginning. Once we get past that, I'll relax a whole lot more. I,

Matthias Miller  1:24:39
I, yeah, I get it. I, I get it. I'm trying to think, what else the dealer, sales training, I think I got the skeleton GHL stuff figured out. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
Who

Matthias Miller  1:25:07
to take that I'm going to try to close. I'm going to try. I think my plan is I'm going to talk to Jeremy in a few minutes here. And it's basically going to be 1k Facebook ads management fee. I I'm going to say we normally charge $1,500 for setup. And I, and I guess I don't really know what to say. I We, I did. We had not established that last time we talked. I'm I'm open to waving that to you, waving that for you this time. And also you need to be part of the 21 day sales sprint, because we really do need that. And I mean that. And, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:26:04
I like it and again. Like, you know, there's no need to put yourself in a box, like, just because we sat here working over this doc, if, if you've already implied something else, or started down a certain pathway with these guys, Jeremy, Kevin, whoever, there's no reason at all to shoehorn yourself into another pathway, like, just, just run with whatever's already flowing naturally with those guys to somehow assure you that I am not into out of shape over anything at this point, like, literally, whatever it works to get the ball rolling. I'm quite happy with it. Very happy. Great, because, all right, good.

Speaker 1  1:26:51
Can I clarify one thing that does affect the sales? So referring only Facebook lead forms if at any point we try to sell that idea. Hey, you need Facebook ads. Facebook lead forms are, are you always going to require that they have a GH account to go with that?

Matthias Miller  1:27:13
I can if, if you need that,

Speaker 1  1:27:16
it's, it's really a matter of likelihood of failure from leading form ads is very, very high if they don't manage them well, and I would say, like 90% of people that automatically mean they've got to have a CRM and at least some limited initial automation. I am not trying to reprise just like the likelihood failure if we want run lead formats and they and they have, like, manually log into Facebook or check their email, it's just way too high. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
yep, I'm sure

Speaker 1  1:27:57
there's men out there who cares about quality can do on paper note, but I just don't think that's most of them.

Speaker 2  1:28:06
Yes, yeah, all right,

Matthias Miller  1:28:13
so Facebook needs CRM. Facebook needs CRM, plus basic automation. That's where setup really does help as well. Or where I see the pain of setup, you already see it, but I see the pain of setup 50 bucks

Speaker 1  1:28:36
or 100 bucks on the first try. Sorry. What's that? Set up fees for any of this. It doesn't have to be $1,000 it could be $150

Matthias Miller  1:28:47
still help, Yep, totally.

Speaker 1  1:28:51
That includes like. That includes like, for example, GHL setup maybe, maybe it needs $100 setup fee, or $78 nothing. Yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:29:04
I like it. I'm trying to think what else? And there was something else I wanted to run past you. Oh, I am. I have a very small knot in my stomach because

Matthias Miller  1:29:28
I want to sell this sales sprint. I want to do it in February. I want to get the ball rolling sooner rather than later. I have not emailed anybody about it. I don't have a sales page up for it.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:42
But

Speaker 1  1:29:46
and we did agree to bump that back to February the six. I think it was correct. That gives us, it gives us two weeks, two days.

Matthias Miller  1:29:58
Yep. Do. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:30:06
Well, I don't know what to do besides, just keep plugging away. That's the bottom line. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:30:16
I think what you're saying is you need time to focus on that.

Matthias Miller  1:30:20
I need time to focus on that. Any time to follow up with leads. I've only been doing

Speaker 1  1:30:28
I have a suggestion, probably, I'm guessing, you need to spend the rest of the day following up with leads. What if we just don't run any residents this week, so that you don't have a new influx of people that you have to talk to, or you have to

Matthias Miller  1:30:42
well or or until I or until I get caught up, and I'll ping you when I get caught up.

Speaker 1  1:30:50
That's fine. So, so literally, I'm suggesting that we ease your workload a little by not least, like tomorrow. In other words, Yep, let's do that, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:31:02
And then, alright. And then I will. I keep bumping out the wheat rich, the Amish builders. I want to talk to them, and I've got some other

Speaker 1  1:31:13
I'm sorry that got a little understand that I've

Matthias Miller  1:31:17
got, I got, I got a referral for Amish builders in Ohio that are struggling. So I could talk Pennsylvania Dutch to them, win them over real fast.

Speaker 1  1:31:33
I am terribly curious. Was that a joke, or do you literally mean you speak Pennsylvania Dutch?

Matthias Miller  1:31:38
I do. I literally do. Did you know that I grew up on mission?

Speaker 1  1:31:48
Where are you actually from? I know you live in Colorado now, but where's your family from

Matthias Miller  1:31:53
Kansas, and my mom's from Ohio, Holmes County. Okay, wow. Holmes county itself. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, so that could turn, I have no idea that's, that's very much early stage prospecting, but that's, those are the types of relationships that could be really interesting, because they're a dealer, and their dealers are in pain. They're in pain, and they might say, Hey, we're willing to pay. You know, either bought great on the on the sprint, or they pay for all the dealers. Or, who knows what can come out of that. But it's, it's more of a whale type situation. Each one would probably have their own account, because dealers run separately. But there you go.

Speaker 1  1:32:49
See, oh, that reminded me of the SDR stuff. I've been chit chatting with some of them. They're all kind of pushing on me, like, Hey, when are we going to get on a on a call? I'm thinking that what I need is clarification on, do we want them the SDR people from Upwork to focus on getting us podcast bookings. Specifically,

Matthias Miller  1:33:18
it seems like a duplication of effort with Josh, and given how responsive these people have been, maybe I've just not done cold maybe I've just never done a good offer before. Maybe I've just never done cold outreach before, but I just don't see why. Why duplicate the effort?

Speaker 1  1:33:36
Okay, it's a good answer. What on your ODBC offer. And by the way, is ODBC any different from this, or is everything we've talked about here basically ODC,

Matthias Miller  1:33:50
it's it's more advanced, so it's got to be a company that's already running some stuff and, and I don't I have not heard anybody say, oh, I need that. Most people's eyes glaze over and they're like, What? What is that? So I'm not terribly eager to promote it right now.

Speaker 1  1:34:17
Okay, how about I just literally ignore them for a few more days, and we'll circle back to this. Let's do that. Let's just put it on the ice for a minute.

Matthias Miller  1:34:28
All right. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:31
Cool. And what would you like me to do for you next?

Matthias Miller  1:34:35
I have no idea. Oh, metal structures. Give Give me. Give me what I need to have the confidence that I need to close somebody whose business has been down 64% last year to invest in marketing to Kickstarter business on the middle standard and

Speaker 1  1:34:57
that business currently. Or recently, does not run Facebook ads and does not run Google ads. Never. It never has. I mean that, that that's that, that's the confidence right there. I mean those all businesses even shed businesses who want to take an action, like a concrete action, pay for ads, and it's Google or Facebook is where they're at. And

Matthias Miller  1:35:24
so with her, specifically, what I do, I recommend Google and say there's a chance, a small chance, that we'll need to drop $1,500 on a website rebuild, I guess.

Speaker 1  1:35:42
Okay, and and more like, like, We are not asking you to decide that right now. We are asking you to be aware that we're going to start running ads, and if it doesn't go well, the first thing we're going to recommend is a better website. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:35:58
okay, fair enough. Awesome. Thanks, Jonathan,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:01
great. Thanks. Bye for now, yep, bye.
