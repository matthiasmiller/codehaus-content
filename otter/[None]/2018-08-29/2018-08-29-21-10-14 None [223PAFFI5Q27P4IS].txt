Unknown Speaker  00:00
So I

Unknown Speaker  00:00
kind of had this crazy idea of what would happen if I would actually start verbally dictating my blog post and the content for that, and kind of process through it, and then give, you know, kind of a general structure now line and some of the content material for it. I don't know if this is a good idea or not. But something I thought about

Unknown Speaker  00:18
something else that I was thinking about was about these new offer that I have, based on the mastermind call, maybe doing a $5,000 per month engagement, where it's simply I go into the business, we again, and we don't set a lot of agreements on this first experimental one, and just see kind of what happens and see how it goes and put myself into it, find out at the end of it, whether or not they actually, you know, it was something that was actually worth for that worth it for them or not.

Unknown Speaker  00:45
And one of the biggest breakthroughs with that was just not putting myself into deeper over committing to fart, just go do it, see what happens, see what comes out of it. And if they're not happy with it, we negotiate arrangement with that

Unknown Speaker  01:03
on that as well.

Unknown Speaker  01:07
Going back to the issue of the blog posts. I think one of my problems is, I don't really have any great ideas for blog posts right now.

Unknown Speaker  01:13
So one great thing I could do right now is to spend some time brainstorming ideas for blog posts. So

Unknown Speaker  01:19
why don't I actually do that?

Unknown Speaker  01:23
What are some things that I can talk about on blog posts,

Unknown Speaker  01:27
one of the things that I could talk

Unknown Speaker  01:28
about is the importance of vulnerability and sharing your story and share about how I did that today, at 1 Million Cups, one of the things that I could do is I can actually do a post about 1 Million Cups, that would be a great, fascinating story.

Unknown Speaker  01:45
One interesting thing would be on a the issue of how do you prove or disprove something. And one of the things that you can do to eliminate your natural bias is to argue and find evidence for your opposing viewpoint. And when you do that, it, it really eliminates the bias of working against the

Unknown Speaker  02:15
it really works against the bias, that you naturally have to find things and only look at things that are in support of your own viewpoint. So you have to be fairly open in order to do that. So that's another idea of a blog post,

Unknown Speaker  02:38
I just realized something else, it's actually really hard to cultivate a relationship with people until you've actually had a conversation with them, and you've gotten to know them. And

Unknown Speaker  02:52
yeah, it's just really hard to do that. So

Unknown Speaker  02:58
it's a lot big. Once

Unknown Speaker  03:01
I've

Unknown Speaker  03:03
gotten to that point

Unknown Speaker  03:06
where I am able to do that

Unknown Speaker  03:11
just have a thought about LinkedIn. I don't know if this is

Unknown Speaker  03:16
a good idea or not.

Unknown Speaker  03:19
But what if I would start sending out messages messages to some of the people who

Unknown Speaker  03:29
are on LinkedIn and start saying, basically, along the lines of, hey, Fred,

Unknown Speaker  03:35
I'm,

Unknown Speaker  03:37
this sounds

Unknown Speaker  03:37
really tacky down, I think about it. But you know, you know,

Unknown Speaker  03:43
love, I love being able to make new friends would love to be able to chat with you,

Unknown Speaker  03:47
and find out what's going on in your business or whatever,

Unknown Speaker  03:50
that doesn't seem really good. Here's another option, hey, Fred,

Unknown Speaker  03:56
I love

Unknown Speaker  03:58
it active with people who are making things happen, and getting things

Unknown Speaker  04:03
done, who are visionary, etc. And,

Unknown Speaker  04:10
you know,

Unknown Speaker  04:11
I

Unknown Speaker  04:14
no pressure, but if you're interested, I'd love to chat a little bit about what you're up to

Unknown Speaker  04:20
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  04:25
And then

Unknown Speaker  04:28
that would be another option. Another option would be saying, hey, Fred,

Unknown Speaker  04:32
just realized that

Unknown Speaker  04:35
I have not been doing

Unknown Speaker  04:37
like, didn't very well.

Unknown Speaker  04:40
And I've been taking too much of a personal approach.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
And I'm realizing that

Unknown Speaker  04:47
really what I want to do is they want to develop real relationships with people.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
And

Unknown Speaker  04:56
I would like to hear from you

Unknown Speaker  04:59
what you're working on.

Unknown Speaker  05:02
Or if there's anything of value that I can add, or maybe it's something along the lines of,

Unknown Speaker  05:22
maybe it's something along the lines of

Unknown Speaker  05:25
I love to be able to chat with you and find out what's going

Unknown Speaker  05:27
on. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  05:29
it's a fine line. So is there something that you can help with, I lost my train of thought

Unknown Speaker  05:34
actually, like the apology approach. So what we would say, hey, Fred, I just realized I've been doing LinkedIn wrong,

Unknown Speaker  05:43
and I am really looking for a few

Unknown Speaker  05:48
individuals that I can build a relationship with, or

Unknown Speaker  05:54
that I could build, I'm really looking to build long term relationships, other business owners, Colorado Springs,

Unknown Speaker  06:04
you are interested in

Unknown Speaker  06:06
building value

Unknown Speaker  06:10
things.

Unknown Speaker  06:15
Maybe it's not the case.

Unknown Speaker  06:18
I really wonder whether these kinds of people are the right people for me,

Unknown Speaker  06:27
I want Sure.

Unknown Speaker  06:29
Now here's the challenge. Is there really that busy?

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Then maybe you should be talking?

Unknown Speaker  06:40
Or maybe they won't pick up the phone and call? That's another question. I suppose.

Unknown Speaker  06:46
Try the hits.

Unknown Speaker  06:49
You know, what if we could save two hours after your day or something along those lines? Are they actually going to be busy enough to do it

Unknown Speaker  07:00
think that kind of thing. I think maybe the pitch is something along the lines of like, here's what you can do for your team for yourself, or if he needs to be so happy with it. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  07:12
I guess the question that going back to

Unknown Speaker  07:15
is whether my target market

Unknown Speaker  07:19
is actually

Unknown Speaker  07:23
it's actually kind of people who want to cultivate long term relationships. And I think the answer is yes, they do.

Unknown Speaker  07:33
Most of them are that quality of people. But it makes me wonder whether the business is actually the right thing, whether there's more like a strategic scaling aspect of it that really comes into it.
