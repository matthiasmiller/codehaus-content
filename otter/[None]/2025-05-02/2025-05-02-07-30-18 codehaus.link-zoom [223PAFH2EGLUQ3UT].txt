Unknown Speaker  04:06
yesterday

Unknown Speaker  04:09
so and then Matt was working on one

Speaker 1  04:11
more of that. There's somebody from late to month one, and they have to talk to fix him. I don't know what that means, but somebody take a message or she picked it up, Tommy, which ones? Why? Hey,

Unknown Speaker  04:25
Matt, yes, yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:28
buddy. All right, I gotta switch out my headsets, right? A little bit, right. Give me that. So,

Unknown Speaker  04:59
well again. It.

Unknown Speaker  05:03
And that's a look, I'm not sure it's a good or model. That's a lot. I

Unknown Speaker  05:32
now we got her.

Matthias Miller  05:35
You guys, hear me?

Speaker 1  05:42
Any instance? And three quarter nails. Sorry, state. Was that stuff coming later or bro, you, you know, how about all that stuff going on that same paper here? Sorry, you're not here, but

Speaker 2  05:56
I so badly want to reconvene figure our office. Oh, today we're looking I've engineers working on plans to move the road. It has a,

Speaker 3  06:11
I just want to have a profile now, but the approvals are still far from done and

Speaker 2  06:22
but I'm I'm trying to plan the the road moved, plus the future layout of this facility, and moving the road opens up full host of possibilities, which a lot of stuff takes time and oh my gosh, we don't have time. I need the office reconfigured now and then it's

Unknown Speaker  06:47
we're doing, alright, wow, right?

Speaker 2  06:50
I guess, yeah, like, we meet here in a conference room. I don't have a great page set up. I don't have privacy. Yeah, my administrative assistant is in the other office, and it's just,

Speaker 3  07:04
it's just choppy, like, not to complain, it's, but it's, it's like, if you need more, a better organization, and Just Just do it, but just doing it is just this long, drawn out process. Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  07:26
when you, when you're limited on space, there's, I mean, what? What are you going to whatever?

Speaker 2  07:36
Oh, no, like, it reminds me of your the quote that you shared, or the stat about, yeah, Microsoft

Speaker 3  07:46
came up about the screen and your productivity, like

Speaker 2  07:52
office layout, has got to be part of that conversation. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  07:57
Well, I think the the one of the questions about this is a fascinating conversation, in my mind, but one of the questions, one of the worst things about working remotely is when you're managing people, junior people don't know the questions they need to be asking and and somebody who's Senior in experience knows, oh, hey, like, you shouldn't be doing that, or There's this better way to do it. And they never and they never even thought that. They never even thought to ask and and obviously, I think, I think a good office layout is one that encourages, encourages good accidental conversations, but also creates that privacy that you need when you need it or so. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
George has been in a George has been working in our main office for

Speaker 1  08:53
what, 3030, years,

Speaker 2  08:57
and it's always been a layout with people stack fairly closely together, which is

Unknown Speaker  09:07
some way, is

Unknown Speaker  09:09
it always good that way? Yeah, not.

Speaker 1  09:13
It's got its good points and bad points. What are the what are the bad points? Is when you want to really concentrate and think on things. That's where it's it's a little rough where you have different communications going on with different like John has somebody talking to him, and Tina has some customer talking to her, and you're stacked close that you can't really they only concentrate sometimes. Could

Speaker 2  09:40
it? How could it be set up better for what you

Speaker 1  09:43
really like, a cubicle, like, maybe, like a hot I mean, you see these offices that have the cubicles that have the walls, soundproof walls and stuff that you're sort of contained. But then if you have questions about the good points is that if you have a communication with you know, maybe. Something the problem with the customer, or something like that. Everybody's like, sort of in the same area that you don't have

Speaker 2  10:06
to right? But I wonder, Oh, what did I just do?

Unknown Speaker  10:13
Still there, man, disappear. Yeah, I'm here.

Speaker 2  10:16
I just wiped our computer. Uh, we gotta get sharing started, right? Um yeah, but, um

Speaker 3  10:25
Yeah, so I'm working on it here.

Matthias Miller  10:33
So another, another simple tool is, if you get, like, this is a big tool in the software space, because some of that stuff, you gotta block out noise or you're not going to be productive. And so a lot of us had studio headphones that we that we wired up and just put on music and anytime needed to concentrate. And you know, if somebody had that look in their eyes and had their headphones on, you knew, like, leave them alone, unless you really needed something. So,

Unknown Speaker  11:06
yeah, all right, you

Matthias Miller  11:11
want to refresh this? This page here? Sure. I

Matthias Miller  11:39
All right, so these are, so the top one's got, well, the top one's kind of unnecessary.

Unknown Speaker  11:51
Good, sorry, did I stay there?

Matthias Miller  11:54
Yeah. I mean, you can stay there. That's most of what I want to look at.

Unknown Speaker  11:57
Okay? Is that That's a new Okay, so

Matthias Miller  12:02
the top one there, you're doing an odd number of, wait, why is it like that 770 that doesn't make sense. No, because it's Yeah, because you're doing seven sixteens

Unknown Speaker  12:28
here.

Matthias Miller  12:38
So you get 10 I so you get, you get 20 out of each cant. So 38 times 20 gets you 760 we eat another 10. So you know you could, you could just say 39 cuts to two by 40 but really, all you need is, is, is 38 cuts of 240, inch and one and cutting one to 40 inch to get the the yield that you need. Am I doing the math right?

Speaker 1  13:20
Yeah, we would just round it off, Matt, rather than having that half a camp. But if it takes 39 I just round it off to 40. Now, is that with that system that you have there? Is that, is that capable of going? Is ever riding to make that a 40 instead of a 39

Matthias Miller  13:42
Yeah, so What? What? What Merv and I were talking about. I don't know if this works for you. Is just in that case, if you need to overwrite it to drop it in miscellaneous prep, we're on that line just just anything that's miscellaneous prep. They know that's an override,

Speaker 1  14:09
as far as I mean jot and then what in miscellaneous prep, like

Matthias Miller  14:15
42 you know, cut cutting 40

Speaker 1  14:20
like cutting 40 cans instead of 39 right?

Matthias Miller  14:23
All right, but do you want to? But, I mean, the basic issue is, if we want to do

Matthias Miller  14:43
if that works, we can do it that way. We need to simplify it. We can always say you are only cutting. I mean, if you want to combine multiple items from different orders or different customers or anything together ever, then. You have to have some kind of way to, some kind of way to to calculate what the cuts are going to be, or some kind of way to put it in the in the in the in the group, and just let you, I mean, we can still let you just manually put in what you how you want it done, too. If that's better, yeah, it's

Speaker 1  15:26
probably going to be better if I can keep it where it is now instead of putting it, I mean, it would just be a training, training thing at first, to let them guys know in the yard to, you know, mean, you're going to have to keep an eye on this, the quantity and the size and the quantity, you know, mean, if there's anything in miscellaneous prep to you may if I'm thinking, right, but if you

Matthias Miller  15:51
want to cut 40, you could just do, what did I say? You could just, you could just change your production to produce

Matthias Miller  16:06
let's see 40. What is it? Eight, 800 something like that. And it would, it would tell you to cut, because that's what the yield would be on on 40 cans. Thinking about that, right? It's something like that. But you could just bump up, bump up your yield to get it up to that to what you want it to produce.

Speaker 1  16:32
We could actually don't in your percentage of waste too. That would change it too, right? But which would be easier and

Matthias Miller  16:41
well, just, just doing percentage

Speaker 2  16:43
of waste. Well, let's go to the well, okay, or what in the in the other window with this information? What? What is that?

Matthias Miller  16:55
Yeah, just go back. Go back a few times. There you go. There it is.

Speaker 2  17:04
You're talking about these 40s, right here. So 800 Well, if you

Matthias Miller  17:11
would take the inventory out, well, actually, nevermind, because you're still adding waste,

Speaker 2  17:18
per se. Yeah. I So, 30 cans. So

Matthias Miller  17:28
try, try something like 14%

Unknown Speaker  17:38
Oh, that's is that on the next page? It

Matthias Miller  17:41
is on on the next page because so this page isn't grouped by the guy. No, not here. You can't so do so. And this is one thing I was thinking about last night. We should probably group. You really, you really want to be able to see the same grouping and see the same calculations on the other on the other screen. You

Unknown Speaker  18:23
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:29
So here's the

Matthias Miller  18:33
Yeah. If you would change you would change that this the size of percent to 14% i and that takes it to 798 and You jump back into the schedule.

Unknown Speaker  18:56
It's gonna do. I'm

Speaker 1  19:03
I think that people, I think that were that's probably only more towards 14% 10% I usually do if it's 42

Speaker 2  19:16
but this here too, I mean, it yields three out of a Canton. Matt, no, I'm not trying to nitpick on this, but is this

Matthias Miller  19:24
20 is okay, that's a good point. Why is that?

Speaker 2  19:28
Is this, yeah, is this the function? Is this a result of the program, or is that?

Matthias Miller  19:34
No, it is a result of the program.

Unknown Speaker  19:38
Okay. What

Matthias Miller  19:39
is going on. All right, so let me pull it up on my end

Speaker 2  19:43
to go back to this page. It has it correct. Matt, like here, it says less can't here, calculating it correctly here, I.

Matthias Miller  20:02
It is alright, so let me go into this guy and

Unknown Speaker  20:08
go see where the I

Matthias Miller  20:24
So it's saying I

Speaker 1  21:06
one zinc, custom the computer that's and give me a quote on a 42 inch screen between five and six. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, they want to work with what I have now, just to see, I know what Matt was saying about when it's if we keep adding stuff to the top of the list. Thing,

Speaker 3  21:36
absolutely. So see what happens. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  21:41
if you don't need,

Speaker 2  21:48
if you don't need, one of those desktop monitors that you have, I probably would take that,

Speaker 1  22:00
because the one in the middle that I have that's into a maintenance room, because I had my own from home and then at my bed, and Michael had one of the maintenance room, and then along to the left. I'm not sure where that came from,

Unknown Speaker  22:20
but neither one has the calendar, either so

Speaker 1  22:32
or I can just use maths and just generate I'll send you an email I haven't had

Speaker 2  22:42
just properly introduced You to the area yet. Yeah, no comment. Crazy, I

Speaker 2  23:06
John, I didn't know he was off Monday. Matt let us know when he needs something there.

Matthias Miller  23:13
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 3  23:15
Um, restoring two guys Monday.

Unknown Speaker  23:20
Why does he? Why did he? Why did he say, Yeah, that's fine. I didn't know he was all

Unknown Speaker  23:29
what that happened

Speaker 2  23:32
before that happened. Not long ago,

Speaker 1  23:37
I was gonna say, I tell him. No, get him. I mean, as long as I got on my kill where you're gonna, well, yeah, but boom, I know one storm that, uh Oh Michael helping home, yeah, and then the other one by 504, hey, yeah.

Speaker 2  23:58
Training was Mickey, but he was worried about Tyler not running.

Unknown Speaker  24:05
I don't know. We got three guys on this end.

Speaker 2  24:09
Can Tyler run the other end? He should be he should run the other end. Just

Speaker 1  24:14
toss some dirt. I mean, he's still got a lesson on watch, hear what the machine is doing on your nails and stuff. Yeah, that should have been to

Speaker 1  24:37
me, I just lose some more hair follicles.

Unknown Speaker  24:47
Make sure I have a couple ways.

Unknown Speaker  25:01
My

Speaker 1  25:04
she's been getting with her siblings. Once a month. We were doing her our house. Normally we live in here's her sister, love Landis will and then her brother lives in Africa. So kind of game, game night, have supper and then play games and cards and cheer hosted tomorrow

Unknown Speaker  25:31
morning. Nice

Speaker 1  25:37
playing games, but not only not for three or four hours. I'd rather just relax. Well,

Unknown Speaker  25:47
three four hours. I mean, a good, good game.

Speaker 1  25:51
Yeah, couple, couple different ones, then

Unknown Speaker  25:54
you Gotta play a couple. I

Unknown Speaker  26:22
the pattern, general, they

Speaker 1  26:23
can get you tied away with the email and stuff. Yesterday, yeah,

Speaker 3  26:29
I was able to, I had my laptop with me, so I was able to do what needs done,

Speaker 2  26:38
and then it didn't have my email or my other it's,

Unknown Speaker  26:54
oh,

Matthias Miller  26:56
you Know, one letter makes the biggest difference. Sometimes crazy. There you go. That's it

Unknown Speaker  27:11
all right, so give me one second here. I'm

Speaker 3  27:30
I'm thinking like this. This is a good layout. Here. Do you like these numbers here?

Speaker 1  27:41
That one can punch? Function, how many like, right now I'm physically or manually typing, how many cans, right? And then the miscellaneous prep button. Well, the maximum like, put 484 in there. You put the big

Unknown Speaker  27:57
number down here, right? The 484

Speaker 1  28:02
now it starts out as a small number. You put the small and then a miscellaneous prep is where you're going for you see the 484 maximum. Well,

Speaker 2  28:09
then should we just put the 440 down here and leave the 484 overhead?

Speaker 1  28:14
Yeah, because it's gonna it's they'll be able to see the small amount like figure out, yeah.

Speaker 2  28:21
Well, just put the small amount where it's always been, if it's always here, then we put the big amount overhead and put small amount down. Instead of repeating the big amount,

Unknown Speaker  28:32
we could you just flip them conversion.

Speaker 2  28:39
You can say 484, equals 10% W,

Speaker 1  28:44
well, if we get rid of the Father half five and a half, 44 then we should not worry about it. Then it is an oral right. Put

Speaker 3  28:52
440 here, and then put the 484 up top, equals 10% W, that's only once I don't and then I

Speaker 1  29:31
Brian Diaz, he wants to, he said, What's yesterday asked me when I pass my paperwork out. So let's chance to be getting certified for especially just a matter of he said he ran it some, some, not a lot, but enough that he knows. I said, Well, when we do another course, we do another course, like, maybe, if something needs or maybe we get. And go train for Levi's offering. John's offer. Yeah,

Speaker 2  30:04
absolutely. Well, Levi, the other Dallas out there, and then Levi was on the cantech, and John sols is on the left, still was on the left, and hobby was, they're all moving, okay, I guess Dylan Harvey dude,

Speaker 1  30:21
yeah. Holly, while he's setting up for our bill, setting up the game. So he'll, well, take what cutbacks he has out, yeah, and then bring another pallet, which I like, because that way he's not starting a fresh cutback. Now, he'll go out get one, it's already consolidated, bring it in, stack on top of it, and if we're done with it, he'll take it back out or place rehearsal. So it's been working pretty well. And I finally, he finally did put Brian on the cantech out of when we tell him, Levi, I said, you want to Miller towards delegating and things like that, and get Brian's delegate on mechanical mechanics. But, and I know you can delegate all the time you want to keep busy too. I said, then you can, but at least get him trained that way. If you want to offer something like that, you know maybe he wants to learn everything. So why not?

Speaker 2  31:23
Yeah, Levi likes to, he likes to do something and hammer away, but and have the twin stacking. That's his money home. That's his he can't do. And he has to make sure everybody else is busy like he has to delegate first.

Unknown Speaker  31:39
Well, that's, that's that's where I'm at.

Unknown Speaker  31:41
It has to, right, all right. So

Matthias Miller  31:49
I got the so I'll need to push an update to get the that down to three cuts. So that's a goof on my end. So what were you guys saying about how you want to how you want to modify this? Um,

Speaker 2  32:03
I think Matt, the 700 is the number that we want. Let's put that down here in the row with the 780 or say, 788 Yep, before dimension. So 700 then the dimension, and then up top, let's do the 798, then equals then 14% W

Matthias Miller  32:34
Alright, here, let's let me. Let me take one step at a time here. Okay,

Speaker 2  32:39
so the 700 and the 798 will be swapped.

Matthias Miller  32:51
So we exclude waste down below, and then the Alright, so you would do the this. This here. Let me find this one here, so you would do the

Unknown Speaker  33:12
total pieces

Matthias Miller  33:15
ways, all right, so you want the size or the seven Okay, the 798 first. And then, how do you want it? So, 798 and then what?

Unknown Speaker  33:28
The 700

Matthias Miller  33:32
700 below, got that,

Speaker 2  33:33
and then the dimensions. And then up top, then we won't repeat the 798 so then up top, you'll say 798 equals 14% W Sure, and then that could be in parentheses, but it that would start off that would because those two numbers are important, it's important that they know the minimum. It's important that they know the waste calculated number.

Matthias Miller  34:17
Like, do you want? Which part would you want? Just here. Let me. Let me do this. Let me share my screen, and you guys can take a look, and you can jump with, if you like, where it's going.

Unknown Speaker  34:34
So

Matthias Miller  34:37
Which part do you want in parentheses this?

Speaker 2  34:41
Oh, sure. That could be in parentheses. 3520 equals 10% waste could be in 10% W or just here, what just needs to be separated from the next text, somehow like that could be in parentheses. What

Matthias Miller  35:00
if we did? I can't find this thing. Here we go. What if we did? Instead of equals, just put

Unknown Speaker  35:17
at oops, wrong one.

Matthias Miller  35:24
Something like that, 35 this is a different cut list. Okay,

Speaker 2  35:27
sure, that's fine. I like 10 W Yep, in parentheses, yep, and then the 191 can you put a dash right after the 191

Matthias Miller  35:41
Yep, dash into space. Yeah.

Speaker 2  35:45
Doesn't necessarily have to be a space, dash space, but at least a dashed in a space,

Matthias Miller  35:53
yep, something like that,

Speaker 2  35:56
yep. And then over here you could eliminate the cut 190 just put in 442, inch and one.

Unknown Speaker  36:17
Oh, okay,

Speaker 2  36:19
well, that would go away. I was there was another job, um on the brewer sizers

Unknown Speaker  36:29
on our page,

Matthias Miller  36:41
we could do it like this, if you wanted To. And let me change one more thing yet, not.

Unknown Speaker  37:04
Yeah, that's right. You always write down cut 244, and 132 right? You keep that

Matthias Miller  37:16
same. We could do something like this, 194 42 42 and one, 342 or if you want the quantities out, we can and just have the

Speaker 2  37:31
that quantity is already in 191, so you don't need to repeat it.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
It doesn't. Yeah, what's 442?

Unknown Speaker  37:41
And 342? Well,

Speaker 2  37:43
because it's not the exact number.

Matthias Miller  37:46
Now, what we could do if you want to actually let me, let me do something here. Hang on, on the patterns

Unknown Speaker  37:53
also,

Speaker 2  37:58
for the last one, yeah, it doesn't need to show that Matt like that last Yeah, it just needs to give us enough accounts. But then yeah, you have to round it up to the next full can, and

Speaker 1  38:14
we can do that with the percentage, right?

Speaker 2  38:20
Well, yeah, it's just in a perfect scenario, your yield perfect. You have an extra 42 inch that you don't need. Well, we're going to run it through, yeah,

Speaker 1  38:31
and seeing shipping stuff by trying to keep it. It's not always even there. We might have a handful of pieces, but you can't just take half the canopy and you could, I guess. But yeah,

Speaker 2  38:50
Joel could pull it off, but you don't need to put that one, because if Joel knows that you're shipping 100 and 100 good pieces, you can figure that out.

Speaker 3  39:13
So no

Unknown Speaker  39:22
no,

Matthias Miller  39:27
alright. So something like, Okay, what did I just do? Well, now it completely killed it.

Speaker 2  39:34
Well, it doesn't need to say cutting 40 twos. If it's 40 twos out of a 14, like combo cut, yeah, it doesn't need to say what the cuts are. But if, if it, if for the program, if the program's always going to tell it, then that's fine. Like out of a. Like out of a 120 we're going to cut 340s 120 is 10 foot, so we're going to cut 340 so if it says cut 340 inch, that's fine. If it's just auto generating that instruction here, this

Matthias Miller  40:15
is what. And here I'm

Unknown Speaker  40:31
that's what I meant to do. I

Speaker 3  40:57
i must walk eight miles and feel like I had three boys old, chaperone for three boys, and my daughter was in another group. She said, Dad, I wish you'd be out chaperone, but,

Speaker 2  41:15
well, I said, I said, but you can sit with me on the bus or the training, or the train again, or the boss again. Okay, yeah, it was time for food. I was like, do they do that? I said, in your shop? No, they No, no. They never. Some parents that had those their children. But anyway, then it was time for food. I need money. Well, you can come with me. No, I need to stay with my group. And then, like, we had a good time. But I was like, Alright, and then I gave her a credit card. And then, so that worked out then, but then later at the train station, before we came back, we kind of went through it again. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  42:04
I need a credit card.

Unknown Speaker  42:08
So it was fun. It was good. I hope we can do this again next year. Dan,

Speaker 1  42:20
I'll go with my grandkids with field trips. Yeah, oh, I don't know about JJ, my youngest grandson, but hopefully mom or dad can take him, not saying, if he wants to have to go, I'll go, but I'll be real when the older side got in, he might have to push me in the wheelchair, take the handicapped.

Matthias Miller  42:46
Alright, so, so now we're doing so you never do when we're doing combo cuts. We never do if it's all, if it's if it's a single length cut. We never do one cut of that length or two cuts of that length. We only do three cuts of that length. Um, so which makes it all come come out?

Unknown Speaker  43:06
Yeah, sorry. What do you mean by three? Three?

Matthias Miller  43:09
Well, I mean, if you're going to have to cut, you're never going to take a can and just cut it. So, so the way the cut logic works, you look at all the different combinations of how it can be cut based on the length you're looking to cut, yeah, well, you're never going to cut a can down to just 42 inches or one, 142, or 242, you're always going to cut it to 342, so, so change made.

Speaker 2  43:33
It depends on No. Just depends on what yield you can like out of a 14, we're going to get 440 twos,

Unknown Speaker  43:41
right, correct.

Speaker 2  43:43
If it was a seven footer, 84 inches, then we would get 240 twos. Yep,

Matthias Miller  43:52
yeah, I'm with you. Okay, so does this go ahead? What do you mean? No, no, but,

Unknown Speaker  44:02
yeah. But instead of saying 254

Unknown Speaker  44:05
340 Oh, if it's,

Matthias Miller  44:08
how do you want? How do you want combo cuts? Do you want to always want to leave just, just leave the first quantity off. Do you want to leave all quantities off and just show the different cuts? No,

Speaker 2  44:17
no. I just wanted to say, we just want to say cut. Instead of 254, dash, it just say, Cut three at 42 inch.

Matthias Miller  44:28
And then if, if there's a combo cut where you need to do,

Speaker 2  44:30
say, Cut three. Dash, 42 inch, comma, one. Dash, 44 inch,

Unknown Speaker  44:38
or an symbol, or the and symbol,

Matthias Miller  44:41
or the and right, okay, all right. But we don't need the quantity, the can't quantity on the on the specific cuts, no,

Speaker 2  44:49
no, but, but just put in there instead of the can't quantity in the dash, put in the word cut, and those words, you know, cut, in this case, it will be cut for. 42 inch.

Speaker 1  45:02
But if you, if we go to that combo like that, 67 and 52 for what was that, have a shield, yeah, then I would like to have the quantity on that second item, cuz it's going to be a combo that you're going to have to have that quantity, right? But

Speaker 2  45:19
that's he's going to do that on the other

Matthias Miller  45:24
I think, Wait, let's, let's go pull up a, let's go pull up a combo cut. So what we're going to do,

Speaker 2  45:31
does that make sense, though? Matt for with the word cut, like, do you want to do that now? Do you want to do that? Let me here.

Matthias Miller  45:38
Let me, let me find it quick. It's, it's, uh, I'm a little lost on where this stuff is. See quantity, I think, yeah, yeah, it would be right, right here.

Matthias Miller  45:57
Like that, yep, okay. But then on a combo cut, it's going to look something like, cut 342, and cut 127, making this is completely made up in into 32 like, Sure, something, something like that. But it doesn't, it doesn't tell you how many cans you need to cut by 2732 but just that, you need that combo cut.

Speaker 2  46:26
That's the pattern that we're cutting out of each 14 footer. That's all they need to know. Like the general recipe is 14 foot can't 342, inch and one for whatever you have as the you know what I mean as the recipe. So cut three. Dash, 42 inch and one. Dash, 44 inch.

Speaker 1  46:58
Now I'm gonna throw a curve ball in there. Some of the things we're not going to be say at 716 for them, first three cuts and that second cut, it's half inch. So we're going to kick that and cut it at a later date. So it's going to be cut that either to 716 if we can still run the same thickness as we're running the other three cuts, or we're going to kick it and use it later on down the road.

Speaker 2  47:26
Yeah, we talked about that a little bit yesterday, Matt, but I think we should first do finish this here text, then look at that combo cut, because that'll answer that question.

Matthias Miller  47:37
Okay, it might be worth it might be worth doing a doing a quick update and just taking a look. Or I can maybe here, let's do this. We can actually do let me do this. So let's go over here. I'm going to pull up the we're

Matthias Miller  48:14
just going to preview these changes over in the live system so that we can see what that ends up looking like, so we all know what we're looking at on the Same page. Let me I lost my zoom bar. I

Matthias Miller  48:52
so we don't have any here. If we change the have 787, to have inventory on one of them. I

Matthias Miller  49:10
All right? No, because we will,

Unknown Speaker  49:21
right?

Matthias Miller  49:26
In this case, all right. So in this case we need, if we need 67 to 52 we're still going to cut everything 5067 52 right? And we'll have a bunch of extras. But it doesn't matter, like fine.

Unknown Speaker  49:46
So, yeah, so I.

Unknown Speaker  50:03
Yeah, we need equal amounts of each we can get. We can get the 352 50 twos out of the out of the recipe. And we can also get the, did you just change that number?

Matthias Miller  50:24
I did. I was playing around with numbers. But see, that's

Unknown Speaker  50:28
what's that?

Matthias Miller  50:35
That's the issue with

Speaker 1  50:42
them. If you uh, does not make sense. 242,

Matthias Miller  50:53
right? Because, because the 60 sevens, we need fewer 60? No, that's still not right. It's not right because, and that's, and that's that is, I mean, fundamentally, that's the issue with, with not so. So we would need a different way to kick out those, those those extra boards. No, this is what it is. This is what it is,

Unknown Speaker  51:35
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  51:42
So

Unknown Speaker  51:50
you're saying because of 4310s about 152 inch, 167 and once you get to then, so

Matthias Miller  52:01
once you get the 60 sevens, then you cut the rest 250 twos,

Speaker 2  52:07
right? Except we wouldn't do that, because it would be we would be losing too much lumber, right? 16. So, so then, so then Matt, what we would do is we would generate, and

Matthias Miller  52:27
so then you would, you would, you would use, you would, oh, but then, but really, what you want to do is you want to cut this out of multiple cans. Then, in that case, you want to get 242, out of this, cut right, and so and so, really, but this is where you have to say, here's the cut and kick these. And this, this quantity should drop down to, you know, 150 or whatever, 100 under 10, right? And cut it out of a different can so that you got less waste, right? I

Speaker 2  53:12
um, so in that case, then we will be cutting. Is it simple to be able to cut the same job in two different batches, like split it into a second a second batch. Or your Do you want to design it where it can we can throw two different combinations of can't size and recipe on

Unknown Speaker  53:47
this,

Matthias Miller  53:48
what I would do is I would do an adjustment on the quantity for this one and change the can't size on the 52 and then, and then, just note on this, I mean, you already have have this here, but as long as the miscellaneous prep says you're looking for 52 inch on this, right, that's all it is. And then, and then we're going, and then this cut is going to be a simple cut. It's just going to say this, because you only have a single quantity that you're generating. You're not trying to generate odd quantities. You

Speaker 2  54:24
Yeah, so or, I think my question is, then, okay, the quant, the quantity that's needed, let's say we we need 352 of the 50 twos, and it's inventory adjusted. We need 242, to 67 that's been adjusted for inventory on the other page. So that's what we still need to complete, the job we can cut.

Matthias Miller  54:58
So you would go over here and. And so if you're wanting this, what can you length? What language you're

Unknown Speaker  55:06
on my end here, I guess, yeah,

Matthias Miller  55:08
here I can, sorry, I can do that too. What? What length would you want to cut the 60 sevens out of? Sorry, that's 50 twos out of

Speaker 2  55:22
Well, first we would cut. In other words, we would first cut 242 60 sevens and 242 the 50 twos. Right, right. We'd start with that which would come out of here, which would come out of same, same can't would get 242 of each. Now we still need 110 50 twos. Does the program care if we come up with those 110 some other fancy way? Or does the program need to know that it it was like that the quota was on the list somewhere, like the 352

Matthias Miller  56:06
I mean, it's, it is based off the quota that's on the list. So, okay, so sorry. But if you, if you go put in an imagery amount for like, 150 for example, that's too much like 125 and then you and then you cut it out of a different, can't length. So you're what, I guess my question would be, what length would you cut your 50 teams out

Speaker 2  56:33
of? Well, it'd be a combo again, because it could be like a 52 and a and a 44 out of an eight footer? Oh, god,

Matthias Miller  56:41
okay. But if it's so let's just say we're going to cut them out of an eight footer. Yeah, so if we, if we switch it over to an eight footer. Now, these things are going to

Unknown Speaker  56:54
a different window

Matthias Miller  56:58
they're supposed to. But what did I miss? Length? I changed the wrong one.

Matthias Miller  57:13
So if you do that, then, now, now the eight footer is split apart. It's still too many.

Unknown Speaker  57:26
It's more like that.

Matthias Miller  57:30
It's all an approximation, but it's now not enough. But whatever you get the idea,

Unknown Speaker  57:37
where's the

Matthias Miller  57:40
so here, and then the 50 twos would get here, cut out of eight,

Speaker 2  57:47
yeah, and that, yeah, that would change the 152 167 you

Matthias Miller  57:55
got to come up with the right number to show in here. It's not the right number, but sure.

Unknown Speaker  58:01
Well, where's the first batch that it's down here,

Matthias Miller  58:04
yeah, which you can change with sword order. So we can do like like that your 60 sevens first and your 50 twos. I

Matthias Miller  58:23
You get where I'm going, or is that too confusing?

Unknown Speaker  58:28
No, I feel like we where's that window that shows the the other 242 the 52 inch i

Matthias Miller  58:44
Well, I mean, this is, I'm playing around as if you didn't need to do all of them, but if you did, if you wanted to do it like that, we would just take we would say we've got 100 and stock with both. I

Matthias Miller  59:04
and you could show it like this, but you're going to join, you're going to generate 242 you would just George would just know that he's generating 242 of the 67 inch out of here. And so if he need needs or sorry, 242, of the 50 twos out of here as well. And so if he needs more 50 twos, he would adjust this line to be

Unknown Speaker  59:38
to be that I

Matthias Miller  59:47
now the question is, how in depth and how comprehensive do we want this to be, and how. How well do we want it to model what's actually happening like, like an ability to split a cut, you know, basically an ability to clone one. I mean, we could let you clone, basically copy one of these rows. So you could have one row keep coming out of the out of the eights, or one row coming out of the 10s. Have the other row coming out of the eights,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
sure.

Speaker 2  1:00:34
But okay, so when we cut the run these 10 footers through the 242 52 inch is not showing up in this window like it was previously, right?

Matthias Miller  1:00:48
Because we changed the can size. Okay, so the original scenario we're playing with is that,

Speaker 2  1:00:55
no, but that's the 10 footers. Okay, yeah, there it was.

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
So here the original scenario, playing around with was that we need. Can you go back? Sorry, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:01:11
well, no, back to the other. The original one was closed together,

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
sure. So if we cut them out of, out of Okay, so if, if you're, let's see maybe half by six by 10. Why are they not? Oh, different sort orders

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
like that. Yeah, right. And

Matthias Miller  1:01:40
then we had but, but the scenario we that we were, I was playing around with, is that, well, we got, we got the 50, we got a bunch of of the 60 sevens in stock already.

Speaker 2  1:01:54
Well, okay, but let's just say we don't, let's say this is what we're back to.

Matthias Miller  1:02:01
All right, nothing in stock, straight up order. There you go. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:02:05
sure, well, that's, that's easy now, because we need so the does, the does the program like it's, it's sending 352, 60 sevens somewhere. Does it? Does it care like, does it need to be cut in its own batch, or the fact that it's a it's also a yield from the batch that's cutting the 52 inch? Does the program recognize that

Matthias Miller  1:02:40
it does, right? It does recognize it. Now, if you Yeah, it does recognize that it's going from the from the same, same batch and

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:02:57
and each one will be but each one needs to be checked off separately. Say, Hey, I generated this yield. I generated this yield. Where

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
do you check that off,

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
over here, when you mark it complete. Okay, so

Speaker 2  1:03:11
here, here we have, what's that sort of, Okay, three. So here we have, we need the 320 of each and it's both being sent to the same job,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:30
to the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
same run, basically, right,

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
exactly.

Speaker 2  1:03:38
Well, that and that that works great now in in a case where you have 100 of the 60 sevens in stock, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
that's where things get a little dicey.

Speaker 2  1:03:53
Okay, so let's just say, because this could be the scenario, because, yes, it's a combo, but it's not the same job, and the numbers are different anyway. So that can happen. In that case, I think George would adjust the can't quantity of the 10 footers to get the 60 sevens and the 50 twos, right? So he'll say, Cut, whatever that quota is, cans, and it'll get to 242 of these and are probably generate 242 of the 52 inch. Now he's still short 110 52 two inch. So in miscellaneous prep, he's going to say, because to complete the job without asking the program to figure out a whole bunch of weird stuff. He's just going to say, but one. 10 divided by seven is like 1816, something like that. Um, he's going to say cut 16, three and a half by six, eight foot. 152 and 144 like he's going to write that into miscellaneous prep. Then the job will be complete,

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
sure, and they'll and so this, this is technically going to be wrong, because they're going to need to pull eight foot cancer.

Speaker 2  1:05:31
He's going to have to edit, right? This will be wrong, it? It? We could say, hey, we don't care this round. Go ahead and cut the two, the 152 and the 167 yes, we're going to have 110 extra 67 but, you know, we'll use it for something else. Or he might say, Hey, Joe, instead of cutting that 67 for the last 16, can't kick off a 68 and don't run it through as 1116, 67 so like there's, it's gonna vary with the way that he handles finishing out this job. And it doesn't have to be auto generated.

Matthias Miller  1:06:22
Um, which, which goes back to this part. And this part is going to be mostly right, but the guys still gotta check miscellaneous prep. Miscellaneous prep is the final word,

Speaker 2  1:06:38
right. Miscellaneous prep is, yeah, it can override all the other instructions to get the job done, basically, but like this here just needs to be like that. That the default method, the default recipe, yada, yada. So what you have? 594, okay. Anyway, so it's you have your quotas. Here you have your waste, your your total quota. The can't quantity mixture, poplar cut 152 inch dash, 167 inch. That's perfect. The end. Cut 250 twos part that can go away, and he'll, he'll, if there's, if there's other nuance, he'll just write that into miscellaneous prep.

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
Okay, so, but then there, there we're getting into. It's, it's an automated thing, and from soccer standpoint, to get it done, it has to cut 250 twos, even if the waste, unless we set a maximum waste factor like, not. Well, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:07:50
I don't, I don't know. No, that's not worth it. Just do your just do the make your auto generated information, like the default information, where it's fairly simple. You know, we can get a 67 and a 52 out of a 10.

Matthias Miller  1:08:13
So do you want to? I mean, do you want to do?

Matthias Miller  1:08:32
Yeah, I guess I'm not pretty sure how

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
well should we even be doing the automated thing? I don't know. Like

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
you're saying, what part

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
this part? I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:08:50
I don't know how to eliminate this without compromising logic. Where it's it needs to be included in the other in other at other times, a second cut when you've got multiple combo cuts.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:04
But that doesn't happen very often,

Matthias Miller  1:09:08
so you would be happy with, I mean, we can do we can figure out what's the what is the primary cut that you're going to use and ignore any secondary cuts that you could potentially use.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:28
Right? Is that

Matthias Miller  1:09:29
what you're saying?

Speaker 2  1:09:32
Say that again, one more time. So

Matthias Miller  1:09:35
if, if you need, like here, if you literally were only using 10 foot cans, yeah? And you wanted to get this quantity, yeah, with the fewest number of cans. Now that's not a accounting for waste, but fewest number of cans. This is how you have to do it. But if we would just say, only show the the primary cut, the cut that you're going to use, or the combo that you're going to use most frequently, only show the. I wanted to ignore everything else, right? Is that what you're Is that what you're saying? Right? Right? Okay, yes, so let me go back over here, and we're going to do this. We're

Unknown Speaker  1:10:51
All right,

Matthias Miller  1:10:53
so now, now this is just going to show perfect. I mean, I think it's fine,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:01
fair enough.

Matthias Miller  1:11:03
And that actually, that actually ends up being a better way to solve the pattern problem here, where we just do we're back to just

Matthias Miller  1:11:20
because we only show the primary one. And so if you're cutting, if you're cutting threes, we're only going to or, you know, the situation earlier getting I forget what it was 342, that of whatever out of a 12. I don't even know what a 12 person, but anyway, there you go. I like it.

Speaker 2  1:11:39
Yeah, we were cutting 42 inch out of a 14. There you go. Should yield 442, inch.

Matthias Miller  1:11:50
Okay. Are you guys happy with this?

Speaker 2  1:11:54
Uh, yeah, um Yeah, I think so. The numbers like, like, here, no, the 35 Go ahead. Sorry, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:12:07
I'm not sure the 35 isn't necessarily a completely accurate number.

Speaker 2  1:12:11
Well, the 594 isn't either, because you're getting 152 inch, the yield is seven. So 352 divided by seven is, well, the 594 is a total of these two quotas here. But that's that's where it gets funky, because the 242 is a

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
it's a result of,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:55
yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  1:12:58
this is the total. Still 352,

Speaker 2  1:13:09
like this isn't like the High Steel one, where we combine, like, right up here the 5091, nineteens, two jobs up. That's combining. I serve 2.5 high, serve seven for a total it can you combine the total of the both those jobs and that was 509,

Matthias Miller  1:13:29
here, right? But in a typical scenario, what George would do is he, he, or what he probably should do is, in the inventory, he should say that we've got 220 in inventory, because this cut here should only produce 110 because there's 140 there's 242 that are getting produced from over here.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:59
I wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:10
Yeah, I don't think that's

Unknown Speaker  1:14:14
you don't agree.

Speaker 2  1:14:16
Mean, yeah, I kind of agree, yeah, there's 242, coming out of this combo.

Matthias Miller  1:14:27
And then this one, I mean, but this is where, if this were actually what's happening, then this would get moved into, into the eight foot, and we would cut these out of eight foot, right? And I mean, it's really not a fair picture here. So then, if this really is reality, and then, and then this guy would move down to sort four. And now he would, and. George would just know that. Sorry, that's the wrong way. When George puts the cut list together that this is going to kick off. Sorry, I'm not sorry I switched the wrong one. I

Matthias Miller  1:15:33
So he puts the Cutlass together. He would know that. So this row he would put under the 10 foot, he knows it's going to produce 242 and then this line item he would cut out of an eight. Would adjust the quantity so it only produces 110 because he's already got it covered. And would have to update the miscellaneous prep to say, All right, this is we're going to cut 250 twos off of this. So

Speaker 2  1:16:07
if that's the case, if that's the case, so then the 242 is accurate. It's just not showing 242 52 inch automatically here in this window. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:16:19
I messed something up on the I'm not showing the cuts. Not

Speaker 2  1:16:25
sure what I did. But then, but then, even if it was showing it Matt that, then the total would change up top, like the total, it was adding up both totals, but it shouldn't be adding both totals. There's multiple things going on here, but okay,

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
but if, but, but you would never okay. So let's go back to how it was. You don't have inventory, no, only the same size board, right? All right. And sort order. We're not, we're not going to split them apart from sorter. So now they're combined. And you're saying, you want to, you want this to show 352,

Speaker 2  1:17:10
well, do you know what I'm saying, though, because we're, we don't, right, because 5051, can't you? Cans. Well, hold on here,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:28
that's a waste factor

Speaker 2  1:17:32
352, divided by seven is 51 cans. It does take 51 cans to get to 352,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:41
but this

Unknown Speaker  1:17:44
7040,

Matthias Miller  1:17:46
I'm sorry I missed making the change here. I made it in the wrong place. This, that's what you're looking for. No, never mind. I didn't, yeah, I didn't make the change here. So this is, this, isn't

Unknown Speaker  1:18:04
the 704 right now. Should be saying 352

Matthias Miller  1:18:11
because you don't want this to be the actual yield of each of the items. You want it to be, well,

Speaker 2  1:18:15
if it's the same size, like the two jobs up high steel, where we combine two jobs, and it combines it to one, number, 462, but here it's two different sizes, and I don't want that to add up into the well, I guess it doesn't. I guess it can, because it, yeah, okay, I guess it can so it's 640 plus 10% waste is 704, total, yeah, I guess that makes sense. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:57
But then it's not giving your minimum maximum. You got your minimum? Oh, yeah, no,

Speaker 2  1:19:03
that would be maximum. It's showing the maximum of both, which, if you divide it by two, 352 you know. So it's fine, but I I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:28
just thinking, Matt, that's been

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
the high steel one. There

Speaker 2  1:19:41
509 is can you split down again? Can you I'm gonna have

Matthias Miller  1:19:53
to drop off in about five minutes. And okay, okay, we need to quit this much time. Here.

Speaker 2  1:20:02
I mean, we could, we could go with this. I think George, I think this is like you could in miscellaneous prep. You could mean, in your whatever you could write in, in your notes, you could say 352, is 10% waste for each size, like you can make a note of that, because this is auto and it's accurate. I

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
The other option would be showing,

Matthias Miller  1:20:55
would be showing the waste adjusted factor here, in addition, like in parentheses, or I don't know, For each one separately, for each one separately,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:09
yeah,

Speaker 3  1:21:20
I yeah,

Speaker 2  1:21:27
I mean, it's, it's good. I don't know how it's gonna work in every in every scenario, but that's something might have to just try it.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:39
Try it a little bit.

Speaker 2  1:21:43
All right, so and then, if this was a situation where, where we were cutting the 320 only, can we run that scenario real quick? Matt, so

Matthias Miller  1:22:01
you're only cutting the 320 cutting the 320

Speaker 2  1:22:04
so we're only cutting the 50 twos or the 60 sevens, like

Matthias Miller  1:22:08
we could just split them apart. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:22:12
yeah, okay, so, right, okay, so now we're cutting the 67 we're cutting 167 inch, 152 inch. That's perfect. All the numbers are perfect. George could write in miscellaneous prep. Well, shoot right. There's the next job.

Speaker 2  1:22:41
So this would then give us the right information. George would change this can't quantity to zero, because we got the yield off of the 67 inch run. We don't need it on the 52 inch run so that could be done. I like that ability. And then here again, let's just say, for example, we were not running the 52 inch through at the same 11/16 by three and a half we were kicking the 52 inch. Now your your auto instructions would be, I'm assuming it will still say, Cut 167 and cut and 152, inch.

Matthias Miller  1:23:45
Let me. Let me, let me, let me update this thing over here, and

Unknown Speaker  1:23:55
let's get up here. Five minutes here, Matt

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
being

Matthias Miller  1:24:16
now I'm confused. Why are we not showing

Unknown Speaker  1:24:22
the cuts, the cuts, what did I miss?

Speaker 2  1:24:31
Well, we can, I can finish. I can finish my point on that like this was, if it was showing right, it would say cut, but it is showing here in miscellaneous prep.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:46
It is correct, and that is,

Speaker 2  1:24:53
that's that's okay as well. It can show there, but if it was auto generated, it would say it. Well, how's it go? It's, it's not auto generate. No, it won't be auto generated because we're just cutting 167 inch.

Matthias Miller  1:25:13
I know what the No, yeah, I know what.

Speaker 2  1:25:17
Like, how are you going to tell it to automatically the No, to cut a 52 inch off the back end automatically. Don't it doesn't know that automatically. So that's always going to be miscellaneous prep information, and that's okay, right? George, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:25:48
here we go. Yeah, it

Speaker 2  1:25:51
right, that's what it would be auto, I get it, and that's but it doesn't have to show that Matt like that doesn't have that cuts. 167, inch does not have to be there. I

Matthias Miller  1:26:06
mean, do you even need any auto cuts ever? What

Speaker 2  1:26:09
that auto cut data? You mean, like, no, yeah, no, I'm not sure how we got on that. That was probably something I came up with. All right. So then, right? Because Okay, so then the next, my next point was that if you get rid of the cut 167 inch miscellaneous prep saying cut 167 and 152 inch, um,

Matthias Miller  1:26:37
the reason we got on the on the cut was because of the camp quantity.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:40
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:26:50
well, I'm sorry I really do have to drop.

Speaker 2  1:26:54
Yeah, well, we have the ability to, like, if we want to kick that 152 inch instead of running it through. We can do that. But I like this. I like this. You can get rid of that. Cut 167, cut 252, eight, like that. Doesn't have to show in any of the job. We'll do that miscellaneous prep.

Matthias Miller  1:27:11
But we need a way to we need a way then to edit the camp quarantine or something, or No. Or can you? Are you? Are you happy letting the automated cut calculator calculate the number of cans that you need?

Speaker 2  1:27:25
Yes, and and do it by deduction. In other words, if I'm cutting it out 10 foot, it knows it can get 167 out of a 10, and there's seven out of a piece. And so then use that. Yep, that's fine. And then he just has to be able to edit it, edit the camp quantity and the waste factor, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:46
like before,

Matthias Miller  1:27:51
all right. Uh, sounds good,

Speaker 2  1:27:54
okay. Um, next scenario. Next? Do you want to get back to me? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:28:05
yeah, How late are you guys there today,

Speaker 2  1:28:09
you're leaving it too pause. Yesterday, we can be here as long as we're 30.

Matthias Miller  1:28:21
Do I would say 230 or three, but let me text you.

Speaker 2  1:28:28
You want to just, just to confirm how that's functioning.

Matthias Miller  1:28:34
Yeah, yes. So I feel like we're not completely done. Well, yes, I do. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
you what do, what? Sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:28:49
yeah, I do want to, I do want to confirm, because I'm not convinced we're in the same I mean, yeah, I gotta drop I got there. They're in the Thanks, Matt, Yep, thank you.

Speaker 2  1:29:00
I still, I still have the ticket, so, um, all right, and it may just, I may not be able to join this afternoon, but George can confirm,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
though, okay, yeah, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:13
All right. Thanks, everybody.
