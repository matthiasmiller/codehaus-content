So I had an epiphany from working on the HR project first of all, there are some, you know there's an 8020 to simplification, and there's an 8020 to complexity so a lot of the complexity came from tasks first of all, and as a result of that, there was also the, the onboarding and exit stuff what would have been better would have been to say, to have some kind of an event that would have, like actually putting the triggers on the contract themselves, or putting them, even somewhere else, that would have allowed you to trigger a specific task as of a certain date. Anyway, but also historical data has an exponential complexity and inter record relationships and dependencies have higher levels of complexity. So, how to eliminate complexity and life comes down to, isolating, you know you have, when there's exponential complexity when you have complexity, a times complexity B, it's exponential complexity so it's okay if it's one thing if it's isolated but then if they end up interacting with each other, that's where you really end up with the high levels of complexity and so just dealing with that and addressing that. It's a big deal.
