Unknown Speaker  00:40
Good morning. Besides,

Matthias Miller  00:57
Hey, one sec you

Matthias Miller  01:07
Hey, Drew Hey, Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  01:08
hello, morning, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  01:10
Mark, good morning. Well, we can,

Speaker 1  01:16
we can talk about snow as well. Now we got half an inch.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Yeah, we going by tonight.

Matthias Miller  01:27
Congratulations.

Speaker 1  01:32
Sometimes I'm kind of sad that I don't get the the high that I used to when I was six years So, like that was just one of the biggest events.

Speaker 2  01:45
You've become too much of a grown up. You need to go jump, jump in your snow suit, and get the toboggan out and go down the hill a couple times. And you'll find the you'll find the Wonder again.

Unknown Speaker  02:01
When does one become a grown up? Don't ask at TPT.

Matthias Miller  02:18
Well, I think the real question is, why does grown up have to be all or nothing?

Speaker 2  02:27
It feels like sometimes that we quantify grown ups as the moment in time where you kill all your childish wonder and dreams and have to act like an adult, and then, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  02:42
yeah, yeah. And

Speaker 3  02:44
practically, it's the time when our bills surpass our birthday money.

Matthias Miller  02:54
That is a good one.

Unknown Speaker  02:58
That is a that is that is quotable.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
That is very quotable.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
Don't know if you're there yet Seth or not.

Matthias Miller  03:17
Good. Well, we

Speaker 1  03:19
have a rather short agenda today. I guess there's no, no nothing bad about wrapping up early. But I guess anything, Matthias, anything before we jump in? Nope. On the handling retrievals, I don't know if Josh has reached out to you yet or not on some suggestions there. So obviously he said he wants to weigh in on this. Dwayne and I had talked, we talked with this with Josh about this on our weekly call yesterday morning, he had some ideas. He said he'd reach out to you on some thoughts or suggestions there. So I understand that's basically, that's where it sits now, and Josh, start to get with you, and then we'll and it's, it's something we want to do, but it's not super urgent. So Dwayne, anything we should add to that, or you want to add to that, or I

Speaker 2  04:23
No, I think the main concern was, can we find a more simplistic route and but no, I don't. I don't really, I don't really have anything to add to it. No, okay,

Speaker 1  04:39
good, well, and that takes us into the paper cut projects, 134, and five, everything but two had been was listed and sent out after a call last week. So why don't we? I. Seth or Matthias, why don't you just go through and let us know in it? Okay, before we go into that it, let's talk about sales tax. Is there anything we should know or anything you want to cover on sales tax reporting? Drew you said you think you understand that the updates, the glitches are either fixed or coming with the next update, which is probably this week, and then, okay, backing up once you have what you need to file you have filed for, for, yeah, yeah. October, so I'd say that's a huge milestone. Just mean, even though it didn't work, like we hope it will in the future, it's, it's, it's great,

Speaker 3  05:49
yeah, no, I think it's, I mean, it's definitely very

Unknown Speaker  05:55
powerful and useful and,

Speaker 3  05:56
I mean, I think it'll work great. Um, one tweak to it that I might ask for is where we can add a line to the transaction that's going to be created for the the sales tax payment transaction. Can we make so that can be we can add more than one line, like add two or three lines. It might be a thing that, just because of the different stuff that wasn't working, I needed to put it in this time, and never have to in the future, when it's going when it's working. But part of my problem was I had things to two different accounts that should go to two different counts. So I just did one of them and then made a separate transaction to move other things as needed, and memo linked to two together. So it's not going to be used really often. I don't think so. If it's as easy as a few clicks of a button, we might as well do the couple clicks, if not, let's not worry about it.

Matthias Miller  07:11
Even need your reaction set.

Speaker 4  07:15
I mean, it basically be just adding, well, adding more astronauts, so cluttering up the screen. But I'm trying to remember what the logic was like. I don't remember if it'll make it significantly more complicated.

Unknown Speaker  07:29
We could

Matthias Miller  07:33
set positions so that each row is in its own line, 123,

Matthias Miller  07:49
I mean, it's not, it's not, it's not. A ton of

Speaker 3  07:51
work. Well, now here's another question, if I, if we create that transaction and I go back to the transaction and then edit the transaction. Will it

Matthias Miller  08:01
stomp over that? No, they will never stomp over this one. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3  08:05
Well, then don't bother I'll just, I'll just do it that way. Then I was just, I just figured, well, it's going to reference back and get stomped over if I change it.

Matthias Miller  08:13
So no, yeah, this one doesn't okay.

Speaker 3  08:17
Well then don't worry, I'll just edit that transaction as needed. So

Speaker 1  08:21
you work great. Go create it initially, the sales tax dialog. Say that, then go back and edit it and do your thing. And,

Speaker 3  08:28
yeah, yeah. I mean it, it should be less than one out of 10 times that. I need to make an extra line anyway. So

Speaker 1  08:37
I think we're getting better at I remember in the early days, when we developed software, we we tried to accommodate for every scenario under almost any thinkable scenario. And

Unknown Speaker  08:53
it was, yeah, well,

Speaker 3  08:57
yeah, I think some of it makes you don't have to do that is have things like that, where there's flexibility to manually do a few things, if, if you need to, because if it's, if it's all tightened up to work perfectly in every situation, you know there's, there's nothing you can do when something is goes different than what you thought.

Unknown Speaker  09:17
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  09:21
So anything that you have on sales tax here? No,

Speaker 3  09:23
that's it. So thanks for your work getting those things done.

Unknown Speaker  09:29
What about you, Seth, or Matthias, anything

Speaker 4  09:35
there? I still have a few questions for I think Matthias and I have a time blocked out this afternoon to work partially on some of the validation wrapping that up. There's still times I'm wondering if we should be requiring tax rates and stuff or not, like related to quotes. I wondered. I'm wondering about switching. From an error unsafe to warning unsafe just to so we don't basically, Josh was pushing for it to be less restrictive. It'll be easier to keep things working if that's the case.

Unknown Speaker  10:16
So, so yeah, he

Speaker 1  10:18
mentioned that yesterday morning on our call and Wayne, What had he, oh, I think I we, I had asked, well, could you make so that your air, your validation, only looks at, you know, say, a certain point in the most of these, these errors that are the validation errors, are from, you know, older sales orders I believe,

Speaker 4  10:49
or are they not? They shouldn't be on older ones. It should only be ones that have been either created, invoiced or canceled since the beginning of October, and it's based on that system switch.

Unknown Speaker  11:05
Okay, well, okay, then that so it shouldn't

Speaker 4  11:07
be, it shouldn't be really old ones at all, unless, I mean, one could have been created, was created two years ago, but then invoiced in October, then it would drop.

Unknown Speaker  11:21
You're saying if they were created or invoiced after

Speaker 4  11:23
or canceled, yeah.

Speaker 1  11:31
So okay, one of the things you're you're needing is, well, I'd say we just, let's go through through your questions on on sales tax. Now I'm trying to answer those who figure out what one of them is, you need legit addresses for some of those sheds direct,

Unknown Speaker  11:52
yes,

Unknown Speaker  11:56
because

Speaker 1  11:58
when I'm wondering if, if we could, I haven't looked at them. But if, if we could change those to, like, she's direct of I n or O, H, or the correct district, I think they're,

Unknown Speaker  12:13
they're looking at, you know, like the actual name of the sheds, direct dealership like, and I'm a sheds direct New Hampshire, or sheds to go, like, What needs that to happen? Or, Yeah, how did we make so that, regardless of what sheds direct, tells us who the dealer is, that it's just saying, Well, this is shed to buy annual wage

Speaker 2  12:53
that was done. I mean, Josh had done that work a while ago. Do we have some that are, that are not currently that way? They've come through,

Speaker 1  13:02
I believe so. I think that's what the issue is with the ones that are causing trouble for for sad.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
Do we have some examples

Unknown Speaker  13:14
here? I'm saying something in the chat.

Unknown Speaker  13:17
Let me pull up the email. I can pull it up here.

Unknown Speaker  13:22
I guess I could just share my screen too.

Speaker 4  13:40
So these are the ones that are missing addresses. And so,

Matthias Miller  13:44
yeah, those

Unknown Speaker  13:48
the dealer doesn't have an address on it.

Unknown Speaker  13:54
Gotcha. So

Speaker 4  13:55
there's no address here, and there's no address here, and so we can't ping do campaign.

Speaker 2  14:03
So tell me mark what address you want to use for these dealers if you want to use the shop

Speaker 1  14:11
address for them. Well, oh, since these are all tax exempt, well, is there? So what is the right thing to do here, like we have so NC, I would use their their Granite Falls address where they're actually located.

Speaker 2  14:26
Well, I mean, does it? Does it matter, since this is all wholesale anyway, whether we use it. I mean, okay, in technicality, would wholesale, categorize on destination based on a wholesale I guess. Are we selling it to at the point of the shop? Are we selling it to their location? Oh, I mean, I would argue, I would argue the manufacturer's address would make it up,

Speaker 1  14:55
right? Yeah, that would be, you're correct. One. Well. But how does that work? Like for other wholesale accounts like say, ho P, well, I guess Ohio the dealer

Speaker 2  15:09
that. So with other wholesale accounts, we have, actually, we have the manufacturer's address on their dealership record.

Speaker 1  15:17
Okay, so here we would use affordable for Ohio, buildings, the final subs for North Carolina, and she had time for Indiana. That's what you're thinking, right? Yeah, that's right. How does that do? What's going to happen? Like we have actually most of our buildings, most of the buildings built in North Carolina are actually building Virginia, right? But the parent company is in North Carolina. Like, where have we? Okay, we've been reporting that. We've been

Speaker 3  15:55
reporting it as North Carolina, but if sale happens in Virginia. It probably should go to Virginia. I don't,

Unknown Speaker  16:06
but the parent company is still in North Carolina, right?

Speaker 3  16:11
But it's, it's, if it were a taxable situation, then it should be like it's Virginia sales. If it's happening, you know, they're picking it up. If the product is is exchanged in Virginia, that should be Virginia sales,

Speaker 1  16:26
okay, but for the sheds, right? Sales, up until now, you've been, you've been reporting them in Indiana, Ohio, and yeah and

Unknown Speaker  16:33
yeah, just so, unless you

Speaker 1  16:38
Okay, let's just go with those addresses. Just, use affordable for for

Unknown Speaker  16:43
it's all non taxable, so it doesn't matter that much.

Speaker 1  16:45
You're surprised you don't have any sheds direct if I and or of New York, but for the New York one, also use the seven. Use the address,

Speaker 2  16:55
yeah. But I think we're, I think we're stomping Ohio and all the New York stuff, aren't we?

Unknown Speaker  17:00
Yeah.

Speaker 1  17:03
Okay. So doing that would clear up all of we would take care of of these. When we ping these Correct, yeah,

Speaker 2  17:12
and Seth, I'll have, I'll have these updated here in just a minute.

Speaker 1  17:16
Sure, perfect. Seth, why? Why would we only have, maybe, you know, Dwayne, why did we only have these 20 or 30, like, there was, there should have been a lot more.

Unknown Speaker  17:27
A bunch of them had customer addresses on them.

Speaker 2  17:31
Yeah, but, oh, but, I mean, if you're if your system switching at the point of whenever, the whatever your I'm assuming the system switch would govern all the SDI stuff too on this, wouldn't it? So October date,

Unknown Speaker  17:46
yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  17:50
But Seth, what you're saying is, okay, some of these buildings are we're just building lot buildings. They have no customer address. Others have customer addresses. So those you're hanging the customer address, that's

Speaker 4  18:04
what would happen. Yeah, yeah, that, I

Speaker 2  18:07
don't know. Think that would be correct. Would it mark?

Unknown Speaker  18:12
Not quite that's not

Speaker 3  18:14
if it's not being sold to the like, if it's actually sold to shows, direct, I

Speaker 1  18:25
so what can we what could we do on those to make so that it's consistent?

Speaker 4  18:32
Ask Josh to change it. But it might, you might have to look at you're gonna have to conditionally choose what to look at right now, he's saying, use the customer the shipping address, if it's there, otherwise, use the dealer address. And that's just what he's doing.

Speaker 1  18:51
So we might have to say, if it is a ligase or sales order, always use the dealer. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  19:01
Okay. Those are all updated now, Beth, Perfect,

Unknown Speaker  19:04
thanks.

Unknown Speaker  19:07
I'm making a note for for Josh on that then.

Speaker 4  19:22
Okay, those are all pinged, and that report is clean now, okay,

Speaker 4  19:34
sales tax validation, I don't know, or the yeah, do we want to get into that? Or should Matthias and I talk about it and get to you, I don't care. I don't know what the best use of time is. Matthias. Do you have?

Matthias Miller  19:51
Oh, I don't know. I don't know, without talking about it, we can, we can talk that in circle. I mean, it's not a this is not a. It's not building burning down. No, it's not. So let's talk about it sounds good. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  20:06
those are the questions I had.

Speaker 1  20:11
Okay, that covers I was thinking there was another email you'd send to me with a list of was it only these, these

Speaker 4  20:26
ones we covered well, Drew had sent an email asking about one that didn't seem like it was paid from months ago, like six months ago. Oh, so I sent a list of ones related to that.

Speaker 1  20:41
They're like, yeah, that's the one. There were, like, 20 of them. And you said, the reason they're not, they did not show any of the historical reports and were not paid was because they did not have a that was a

Speaker 4  20:51
the final, the final delivery date, I think.

Speaker 1  20:55
And I think about half of those were 23 right, from 23 so those, we can ignore those, but

Unknown Speaker  21:03
there's six of them from 24

Unknown Speaker  21:06
Yeah, Wayne

Speaker 1  21:07
will probably was that sent to Dwayne as well. I think it'd be worth taking a quick look at. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  21:18
what am I looking at for Dwayne to weigh in on

Unknown Speaker  21:22
what am I? What am I looking for?

Unknown Speaker  21:25
Seth, can you send him that list that? Yeah,

Speaker 4  21:27
I've let me just share I forwarded the email, but let me just share my screen as well.

Speaker 4  21:41
So Drew stumbled across a sales order this guy, I think that wasn't showing up in the old sales tax report, and so I checked and it looks like it didn't show up, because it's linked to building, but the building doesn't have a final delivery date. And the report logic as we had received, we made it standard from you, I believe Dwayne, about two years ago, and it was looking at that. So there's a few of these that didn't have delivery dates. So we didn't.

Speaker 1  22:17
So Seth is to clean this up. We should put in delivery dates on these six, right and so that, and then obviously pay the tax for them. But does is it also critical that like, okay, but,

Speaker 2  22:36
but did we not handle build on site. In regards to this, that logic, I guess not.

Unknown Speaker  22:49
I don't think

Speaker 3  22:52
I'm just if they are built on so technically, they're used tax, but if we collected the sales tax on them then, then we need to just pay it in anyway. So it's kind of like we can't, we can't go backwards. So let's just keep going with these.

Speaker 4  23:11
Yeah, so this was the old subset here. I added some to filter it down because we don't want to include every single one in the last however many years that had

Speaker 1  23:26
but your criteria set moving forward is, is it only once it's been invoiced?

Speaker 4  23:35
Yes, once it's been invoiced, and it won't require, wow, wow. Require or rely on melding those two words. It won't rely on the found delivery day anymore.

Unknown Speaker  23:48
Good. Okay, so, so there's really,

Speaker 4  23:54
it's not an issue moving forward. It's just for, if you care about these few to get cleaned up.

Speaker 3  24:03
So basically, what? So if the report's not going to look at those would just as they are, would show up on the report. Now, is what you're saying

Speaker 4  24:13
after. I mean, if, yes, if a sales order like that, and it would Okay, the invoice after October would be good.

Speaker 3  24:21
So these, we should put the final delivery date in so they show up on the old one, and then we should take these numbers to our other sheet, add them into our animation sheet that we're doing, and make sure that they get paid.

Speaker 1  24:33
I think that would be the cleanest way. So Wayne, if you could add in the final delivery date on these six, I think all is good,

Speaker 2  24:43
you say, just on the highlighted ones, or all the everything in here,

Speaker 1  24:47
just the highlights, just the ones that were invoiced in 24

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Oh, gotcha, gotcha.

Speaker 1  24:56
And then yeah, once you have those updated, just you. Like Julie and I know, and then we will update our tags, sales tax sheet from there, all right,

Unknown Speaker  25:07
give me about 10 minutes. I'll have it. I'll have them updated. Good.

Unknown Speaker  25:17
I think that's all sales tax, right.

Speaker 4  25:20
So serve. Am I in? Okay,

Speaker 1  25:23
good. Well, that was helpful. Thanks again for all the work you did on that. I'm, yeah, glad that that is largely behind us, and it's one of the things that's not feels more like a I guess, paying taxes and privilege compared to like living in Haiti or somewhere you would

Speaker 2  25:49
so well before we before we leave this entire conversation mark, and it does, is Indiana not following some of The same process that we had in in Ohio for handling bill, because these are all built on sites. Are they not? Are they not following the where they they contact our office and let us know that it's that it's been we can update the record

Unknown Speaker  26:19
they're supposed to. But obviously.

Speaker 2  26:23
So, I mean it just, it may be worth saying, hey, let's, let's just have a conversation about again. Because, I mean all of this, well, I mean this, some of this is back in February, March, so I think some of that's post, some of that process. So maybe, maybe it's all good. I

Speaker 1  26:44
uh, it might be worth mentioning that the calendar I can, I'll make a note. I mean,

Speaker 2  26:49
because I have a couple here in May, which I think by that point, we were using this, the process that we'd put in place. But yeah, might be worth just mentioning. Good.

Speaker 1  27:07
So on the 1099 filing, we kind of left that somewhat open ended. So curious, if you have anything on that Seth,

Speaker 4  27:18
I don't have anything on this. I think Matthias was wanting to touch base on it on the call is that that's what I thought.

Matthias Miller  27:29
Here. Let me find this email. I

Unknown Speaker  27:49
All right, those are all updated now,

Matthias Miller  27:51
perfect. Let me just make sure the your last, your last two statements make sense to me. So,

Matthias Miller  28:07
vendor 1099, is not a checkbox. It's a

Matthias Miller  28:20
something else, isn't it? Look at this switch.

Unknown Speaker  28:29
Let me check

Unknown Speaker  28:35
so uses 1099,

Matthias Miller  28:40
I guess. I mean, so, so technically, it's not,

Matthias Miller  28:51
this is running on contacts and so, yes, but it's not checkbox, tax ID column, which is, yeah, tax ID field, yep, no, that's fine, something I can take a look at it. That's all I need.

Speaker 1  29:16
So go back to that, that field again, or that, or your defender, or the other one, where the Okay? So what you have is you, you either you select uses 1099, yes or no, and then when you select Yes, does that require you to enter?

Unknown Speaker  29:38
Does it? Do you have to have a tax ID for that. But if you say uses 1099 what? What else do we want to happen like they we need for end of year, or you need to have 1090 nines on file. If we say somebody's a 1099

Speaker 3  29:55
right? Um, Adobe nine, you need it? Well, yes. And. Know we can, with the platform that we use for 10 nine nines, we can send a 1099 with an address only without the but it's not nearly as effective. I mean, you're supposed to have a EIN or social security number. Now, you don't have to have the actual w9 you know, if you have their, if you have their number, you know, that works too, like I found one in the that it was in the system. I'll probably go to QuickBooks and get everything out of there that I can get, you know? I mean, if it drops our number of people, we have to contact from 200 to 100 it's worthwhile, you know. But the reason is, we, I mean, it would like beams. We have a lot in the system. We want to be able to say, Oh, this guy should be on the 1099 list. And so we check it, even if we don't have all the information yet. Then going forward, it would be nice if there is a new vendor that we're saying, Oh, this guy needs to be getting a 1099 that we have a system to get that w9 and that information in a, you know, efficient manner to start with.

Speaker 1  31:26
So what like? But yeah, you're saying, you're saying to clean up you have what you need.

Speaker 3  31:35
Yes, but um, what I was, what I was wanting with that check box on this list is just simply a much faster way I can pull up all vendors list and then I can say, or I can even pull up a 410, 99 list and say, no, wait, this guy is incorporated. We don't need to send him one. And I can uncheck him rather than going all the way back. So it's kind of a list cleanup, is what I'm after with that, like an editable report. Yeah, just an editable report. And then, you know, if, if we pull the list of the accounts, and there's some that are showing up as supposed to be, you know, that should be 1099 vendors, then I can check them so that they always are showing up when we select just for 1099 vendors and so on.

Unknown Speaker  32:23
So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:26
okay, confused,

Matthias Miller  32:27
why all of these are showing zeros in the side note, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:35
Well, that's not ideal. Well,

Unknown Speaker  32:42
we'll look into that

Unknown Speaker  32:45
is, um, do you have the threshold possibility

Matthias Miller  32:49
or not that we could set the threshold? Yeah?

Speaker 3  32:53
Like, if it's under $600 to not even show up on the list? Yeah? Now I don't know if we want to hard code that. I mean, that's just, you know, that's just a federal requirement thing. They might change it. So I don't know how you want

Unknown Speaker  33:15
to do that. And then I

Speaker 3  33:25
on that, what I found was it depends which report you get like, depend which has prompt if you do all. It has to do with those first comments that I made, something about blank seeming to be none instead of all, or I forget which way it was.

Speaker 3  33:55
Well, so do all vendors? Do all vendors? Like blank for the vendors, but leave the other as Yes, I think that.

Unknown Speaker  34:07
Yeah, okay, but I mean so,

Matthias Miller  34:15
so are these the only vendors that you would have paid out of these accounts? No,

Speaker 3  34:19
well, these are, this is just the rent mis C is brand, do the do the NEC? All right? Of course,

Unknown Speaker  34:29
all that just a different like NEC is a different

Speaker 3  34:31
kind of thing, so this would be the ones that are paid out of those accounts, correct? Now, if you do,

Matthias Miller  34:44
let's go see if

Unknown Speaker  34:48
it works.

Unknown Speaker  34:51
Then when you just,

Matthias Miller  34:53
Hey, okay, that makes sense. We'll chase it. Do.

Speaker 1  35:00
Now, do you already have GL accounts where you can

Speaker 3  35:05
I can select the GL account. I can say, Okay, if it's a like the subcontractor accounts I have selected as an NEC, 1099, account.

Speaker 1  35:14
So, but what does it do? So, how does that work? So

Speaker 3  35:18
it pulls all the people that we expense to that account, pulls them into this list. So then I can go into this list and I can say, okay, you know, or me hardware, okay, that that should not be because of whatever it is. So then I these are in the non 10, nine, nine. So if I go and re do the Ask prompt to show me only the 1099 vendors that are in the 1099 accounts, then I have my list of what I actually sent in nine nines to. Now the settings obviously are not selected. Some of those should be to 99 vendors, but so we have a to where we can pull everybody in the account we can look through and then select from there which one should and which ones shouldn't.

Speaker 1  36:11
But what is like? Yeah, for a new like. So we get a new vendor like, and we we enter the invoice, and we use a subcontract GL account. Are we doing anything there to prompt us? Of you know that, hey, this is a 1099, vendor. You need to get a w9 and get that information. Like, should we or, I mean, one, one, kind of, I don't know, ruthless approach or kind of would be, yeah, would be to handle, like we do the asset accounts. So if you, if you have a new vendor that goes to these subcontract accounts and you don't have you can't save it until you have a w9 on file. And basically what that would do is you'd say, no, Mr. Customer, we can't pay. We won't pay your invoice until we have the w9 on file. Is that? I mean,

Speaker 3  37:06
well, that's what, that's what we do with many of our customers. But it then relies on the person entering the bill to know what to be looking for, like, if they would know? Oh, this is something that this cost for which this customer should be receiving a 1099, and they're not already in the system. Well, then it's a new one that we need to go find, though, but I'm not sure. Maybe Matthias would have an idea. How would you make the system know? When we create a vendor and then go and create a vendor invoice and tie a certain, you know, it's, it's like two different entities, because you can't just flag. You don't want to flag the account and say every time this account is used, Hey, you can't do this because that guy doesn't have 10, nine, nine checked or unchecked or whatever.

Matthias Miller  38:03
What? Why don't you want to do every time the account is used?

Unknown Speaker  38:08
Um,

Speaker 3  38:10
I guess it's just kind of back to the validation thing like Seth was talking about, you know, where it in my mind, there's going to be too many edge case things where, well, no, we actually want this, like it keeps us from ever getting anywhere.

Speaker 4  38:30
A vendors, all the vendor won't have some things that are okay, I don't know to 99 stuff really at all, but I'm just thinking it's a drop list, right? So vendors, either the vendor can't, sometimes be 299 but others not,

Speaker 3  38:52
no, they would always be, because so they do a service for you. Then, regardless of whether they sell parts or not, you give them a 1099 for the entire whatever you have record of that they build

Speaker 4  39:07
you for. So can't we, if you link to what one of these accounts, that's a 1099 account. Can't we grump at you if the field is not set, because it's a yes, no list, it's not a check spot check box. But then if you set it to No, we'll be like, Fine, you thought this through. We're not going to grump at

Matthias Miller  39:33
you. Yeah, as long as long as the AP people are qualified to make this decision,

Speaker 3  39:41
and that's, that's kind of where I come back to, like they're going to need to know how to sort through those things. If we put some sort something in place there.

Matthias Miller  39:52
I think, I think what should happen is that this should show up when you go to pay Drew, you're

Speaker 3  39:59
the one. If it does okay, it does it. How is it? Um, I need to look at the validation. I don't think enough. I don't think they're actually quite all showing up. But often it says, I do get a I do get an error, or down there. It's just a warning that this is a 1099 account, and this person is not marked for 1099 or something like that on my check payment. You know my bills to pay page that

Speaker 1  40:36
would shift the responsibility to you, right? It's your responsibility anyway at the end of the year. And Right, right? I mean, in a perfect world if, if we make that change, it from a warning to a hard stop, like you absolutely you can't unless you just write a check outside. Then you get to the end of the year and you have 210 and 210 90 nines or 2w nines to collect and see.

Speaker 3  41:02
Part of it is we're required to send 10 nine nines, but we have no authority to collect the information that is needed to send it tonight. It's one of those beautiful things like like, so, so you can, I mean, quite legally, you can get away with not doing 10, nine nines if you can show that you have tried to acquire this information, you know. So when it really comes down technical, you're supposed to say, you know, you're supposed to check the box that we've made two attempts, or whatever like, which we don't bother with. But so the the easiest way to get the information you need from the customer or from the vendor is to do it before you pay them. You know, because then you have, well, otherwise it's like, well, it's buried in the dust somewhere, and I don't know where my paper is. And you know, if they don't feel like getting it to you, they don't,

Unknown Speaker  42:08
well, Drew, I think it's Fauci. I mean, yeah, it's what, how you want this to fund. I

Speaker 3  42:12
think we should just review that validation for that warning when I go to pay, make sure that that is pulling in the situations they're supposed to be. And there's some that I've been like, Well, no, this, you know, this doesn't get a 10, nine, nine anyway.

Unknown Speaker  42:32
Let's take a look.

Matthias Miller  42:37
Remember adding the validation

Speaker 1  42:40
but only pop up the first time you pay an invoice for that vendor.

Speaker 3  42:46
Well, no, what I can do then is I can go and like, if, if that vendor is one that should not get one, like, let's say they're incorporated. Then it doesn't matter what to do for you. You don't lose in the morning. Then I can go and say, No, this guy is not 1099, instead of just playing and then it never shows and then it never shows up

Unknown Speaker  43:06
again. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:10
And for the ones,

Matthias Miller  43:13
so we're only requiring the tax ID. That's how it's working. So if, if you have a vendor without a tax ID. Okay, if you said no in the vendor, you fill in the tax ID. Obviously, there's nothing to do otherwise, if you there's multiple ways to express this. But if, if any of this impacts a 1099, service account, then we expect a tax ID, bottom line.

Unknown Speaker  43:46
But do we

Speaker 3  43:49
okay? So if you say no, you say no, and tax ID is blank, that will kick it out of warning, right, right,

Matthias Miller  44:00
but we don't force you to actually collect. I mean, I guess this is the shortcut, wait, but this is this actually used.

Unknown Speaker  44:11
I think we down. Think it is. I

Unknown Speaker  44:25
struggling I

Matthias Miller  44:46
I'm not, I'm not seeing, I'm seeing the macro to calculate the validation. But I think we pulled the validation for some reason. So I think we're actually back to we can make this work any way you would like. How would you like it? It, what's the famous word? I think business process.

Speaker 3  45:03
I think this is, I think this is right, um,

Matthias Miller  45:08
but do you want to hold this off until you attempt to pay it?

Speaker 3  45:15
Yeah, because, I mean, I don't think we're going to get entry, to be the people trying to catch these. I don't want a block from paying actually, just a warning, just a warning down the road. You know, there might be room for that. But I think, Well, right now, there's so many in there that it would be quite impractical. It's kind of one of those things we just left it because the other fires were burning so much more brightly, right?

Matthias Miller  45:59
All right? Well, we wanting to report, oh, that's where we did it.

Matthias Miller  46:16
We added it to the vendor invoices needing payment. So it's not actually,

Matthias Miller  46:26
it's just here that it shows

Speaker 3  46:27
up. Yeah, yeah, that's where I see it, over in that

Matthias Miller  46:32
last column. And so that's good enough for you, yeah, yeah. That's fine for me. Okay, well, that's there's nothing to do is

Speaker 3  46:41
that I don't want to give entry people some warning that they're just it just increases their immuneness to warnings.

Matthias Miller  46:52
It's not inoculation.

Speaker 1  46:56
All right, yeah, so we do nothing with that. We just go, all

Matthias Miller  47:01
right,

Speaker 1  47:02
right. Payment types go ahead drew this is

Speaker 3  47:07
so in looking at our through our bad debt list, there's some stuff that is not taxable, so and so, if it's not taxable, if we do an adjustment for customer overpayment and return that money, we don't want to put the 7% tax portion back onto tax liability if it wasn't a taxable sale to start with. So I'm not sure if we're if we're handling that. I know it's handling if it was in customer deposits. You know, it goes back to customer deposits. We're taking care of that. So basically, there's a criteria on this adjustment for overpayment, that if it's not taxable, it shouldn't get split and it should just all go to bad debt.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
So do we have this? Is this underpayment? Should it be?

Speaker 3  48:07
Oh, yeah, it should say underpayment, not overpayment.

Matthias Miller  48:13
If you have an under

Speaker 3  48:18
I'm confused. So if we have a if we have a customer, what am I saying? I think, yeah, saying the customer underpayment means it's bad debt.

Matthias Miller  48:31
So, right?

Speaker 3  48:33
So we're there's money that we're not getting now, if it was taxable, if it, if it was taxable, we split it the tax portion back, right? If it was not taxable, then it needs to all go to bad debt,

Matthias Miller  48:55
right? But we don't, actually.

Speaker 3  48:57
So if, if there was an order that was not invoiced yet, and we return the money to them. We're using this adjustment for underpayment. What are we doing? No, that's customer overpayments.

Speaker 3  49:17
Okay, never mind. That handles that. So basically, it's just we need to handle taxable versus untaxable

Unknown Speaker  49:24
When there's bad debt, when we're when there's

Speaker 3  49:27
bad yeah, if we got an underpayment and we're short paid,

Matthias Miller  49:31
if you're underpaid and short, okay, but we're not actually, I think we just have one payment type, though. Why do you need to if we handle it right,

Speaker 3  49:42
we don't not handle correctly, as long as

Unknown Speaker  49:51
if it

Speaker 3  49:53
so with handling it correctly would include that if it was not taxable and it does. And get split, it then doesn't show up in our tax reporting reports.

Matthias Miller  50:08
Well, I mean, it would show up as a Well, obviously, right? No, of course it wouldn't, because it was never invoice, so there was never any original liability, right?

Speaker 3  50:18
Yeah, if it was a customer deposit situation, it was a

Matthias Miller  50:23
customer deposit situation, and if it was a non taxable but if it was a non taxable invoice, then we'd do a reversal to say that your wholesale, your non taxable sales, decreased by X amount,

Speaker 3  50:35
right, right? So it would only show up on the non taxable side of things.

Speaker 1  50:40
But what are you? Matthias is saying, I think that instead of $100 invoice, it's short page, $7 before we apply the bad debt, it would show $100 on non taxable sales, and after it would show $93

Matthias Miller  50:58
right, right? We would, we would create an adjustment of negative $7 on non taxable sales. Yeah,

Speaker 3  51:06
yeah. Well, as long as it just looks at taxable versus untaxable and splits it when necessary, that's all that we need to do.

Matthias Miller  51:15
Okay, Seth, and I will take a look at it. I really don't

Speaker 4  51:19
was just looking. I think it's working, right? I mean, if we find scenarios where it's not, then we can dig. I mean, we fast, and I can look a little more too, but I think it should be working.

Speaker 3  51:28
Okay, well, I was just going by my report of payment types, and then so they were all there. It wasn't a tax report. Everything was on that report by payment types. I think Dwayne had made it. That's just what made me aware of it, because we were just hand picking them out, the ones that apply. And so then I opened some like, well, this isn't going to apply. And I then that created the question, are we actually handling it right in the sales tax?

Matthias Miller  51:59
I mean, we so we should be we need to obviously make sure, when we handle accounting impact, that it works the same way. But that kind of goes without

Speaker 1  52:08
saying. Is it something? Where do you believe it is? It's currently working correctly? We should just do a screen share and just do mock up two POS one, I don't know. Is that worth your call if you think it's

Speaker 3  52:22
or even just find, find a, find an invoice that is tax exempt and has an adjustment for for underbankment.

Speaker 1  52:33
And this would have to be done after 10, one, like, after the system. Yeah, that would be you guys. You guys want to do that now we could take a look at it and it would, yeah, sure. And

Speaker 3  52:55
then the more we can just have it do its thing according to what the invoice is, the less selecting that anybody was to do.

Unknown Speaker  53:07
I mean, do you guys want to So,

Matthias Miller  53:14
if you want to try in a test system,

Unknown Speaker  53:18
what's the best way to do this? Sure

Speaker 4  53:19
I was gonna see if we have, oh, if we have, there you go, name the live system.

Matthias Miller  53:26
Even better. Okay, what

Unknown Speaker  53:29
was the payment method that

Speaker 3  53:36
this underpayment? Underpayment? Well, I mean, it has more than that. Yeah, right there, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  53:44
so essentially.

Speaker 4  54:02
Okay, this does not have sales tax history, because it's November. This one was invoice 1016 so it should have, why don't we have

Matthias Miller  54:20
no rates. Wait, that's no rate. Well, because it's tax exempt, so it wouldn't have rates. But why does it have sales tax as well?

Speaker 4  54:29
It should have rates it per. Does it not have sales tax history because of not having rates totally? I

Unknown Speaker  54:44
I mean, I'm okay first, let me

Speaker 4  54:57
what was your report? Me open it up. Yeah, you had sent me a report on our last call with ones that were triggering validation. Most of them are quotes. There's a handful that aren't, and I wonder if this is one of them. So once we've fixed validation, no, it's um,

Unknown Speaker  55:49
I bet it smart. Yeah, it tried to ping and failed, or was in a batch that failed. So if I would unpin, oh, I have to unpaying via import or my edit. Well, how long should I spend figuring this out now? So, oh,

Speaker 4  56:27
we should run a report and see all the sales orders that have ping checked.

Unknown Speaker  56:34
There you go.

Unknown Speaker  56:38
Good grief. I

Unknown Speaker  56:47
I don't like that.

Matthias Miller  56:56
Well, that's weird. I

Speaker 4  57:05
i This should be dug into for sure.

Speaker 4  57:22
Say that my report for now, but that needs to get figured out. That's not good

Unknown Speaker  57:28
most of those wholesale accounts. I don't know. Is that why?

Unknown Speaker  57:33
But I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  57:34
I can you go check into that? I

Unknown Speaker  57:36
don't know that I want to dig right now. Sure.

Matthias Miller  57:41
So can we just table it Seth, you want to just take a look at this sure and figure out whether we're handling payment types right, and figure out what other skeletons there are that we need to

Speaker 1  57:58
Okay, so basically on that customer under payments. You believe it's working correctly, but you'll you'll validate whether it's handling both taxable and non tax exempt correctly. Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  58:24
So accounting impact for use tax, we're

Matthias Miller  58:29
looking at that this afternoon.

Speaker 1  58:41
And then transaction Okay, four and five are both items that have been on before. Do you have any updates on that or questions for us?

Speaker 4  58:50
Let me see four is done. Five. I didn't work on a lot of my time this week was spent figuring out sales tax stuff

Speaker 1  59:04
is for viable, right? Would that be with the next update?

Unknown Speaker  59:07
No next update. Good?

Unknown Speaker  59:18
Is that likely to be this weekend?

Speaker 4  59:22
I don't know. I don't understand Josh's schedule or rhythms or lack thereof.

Matthias Miller  59:30
Three criteria, is there a compelling need? Does it work for Josh? Maybe there might go more than this. Is the platform stable enough for an update.

Speaker 1  59:42
Okay, so because we have a little bit of time, what, what does? What does that mean? The platform is stable enough for an update?

Matthias Miller  59:52
Um, well, okay, here's an example of when it's not so you see in our reports where you. Have this expression. These expressions were when you can write, and it's here in the form of coding and all this other kinds of stuff that you can do. And one of the recent projects has been go rewrite the entire the code that reads the code and runs the code. Go rewrite that entire ecosystem, which you know, you run it side by side for a while and make sure that everything works as expected. And then you flip a switch and set it say that this goes live. And then suddenly things start breaking wildly that you didn't catch before. It's weird, things like that when you're when you know, normally, in a normal environment, we've got six weeks. We try to keep the platform stable, but we do have six weeks where, you know, if you're doing changes, not everything is going to be thoroughly tested, there's going to potentially be some destabilizing changes during that time. And you know, it's just a question of, Is there work going on that is in depth involved, you know, at risk for not working, recruiting rod and have rock throughout the system. I don't know

Speaker 1  1:01:19
what's the you mentioned six weeks, like, what is the six week period?

Matthias Miller  1:01:23
So there's a six week development cycle in the platform. So you spend, so developers spend six weeks working, and then, and then there's a code freeze, and this moves over into so this is called, we call it development. So this is the sandbox. All developers are always working development, and then there's a code freeze. And everything that's in development moves over to staging, and it's there for six weeks for testing, testing, testing, and then any fixes get applied to both development and staging, for for those for jobs that are in staging. And then at the end of the six weeks, then there's like the sign off process. This is all good, everything, all changes have to be accounted for and and either have to be well, all changes made to the platform have to be accounted for as part of the QA process. And so once everything is cleared through QA, then, and at the end of six weeks, that then moves to production. And so the production environment is what banks like to run out of silver loom clients like to run out of staging. And insight likes to run out of development.

Speaker 2  1:02:35
So what you're saying is we have a higher risk tolerance than most of your clients,

Matthias Miller  1:02:42
most you have high risk tolerance in banks and most of our clients, yes, even a higher risk tolerance than I do.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
Wow, that was a you put a really positive spin on that.

Speaker 3  1:02:59
In other words, our system is generally in the unstable situation.

Matthias Miller  1:03:03
Well, I mean, it's, you know, the reason it works is Josh has a very, you know, has a finger on the pulse of exactly what's going on. So there's he doesn't get caught by surprise. And not usually. I mean, there have been a few times, but not usually. And so we'll just throw up his hands and when he knows there's something well, or sometimes too There have been cases where, I mean, it can be, it can be anything from it's Friday evening, a developer is trying to get something input before end of day, and doesn't do due diligence or just misses something. And for that reason, things start breaking. We have a bunch of overnight processes that run. So part of the QA process, I say we, but part of the QA process for the platform is, there's a battery of 1000s of tests that run every single night reports and other things like that. And if there's any change at all, it gets triggered, and it has to be rationalized and justified. And so sometimes, you know, developer does something, something makes a mistake or something, a whole bunch of those break and, you know, Josh sees that. And you know, it can be things like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
Wow, interesting.

Speaker 3  1:04:37
Um, one question that I had on the sales order, the completed check box went away a while back. Is that staying away? Or

Speaker 4  1:04:46
ask Mr. Josh, oh, made the change.

Speaker 3  1:04:50
Wayne's nodding his head. So sorry. We never, we never. Oh, so it was gone. I like, well, I guess, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:04:56
So what replaced it or replaced it is logic that's. As if the sales order is invoiced and the balance is at zero, we consider it to be read only or complete.

Speaker 3  1:05:05
Got it? Good deal. Good deal. I like it. It's caused,

Speaker 2  1:05:11
it's caused a few hiccups already. You know that whole part about living out of development, we've, we had, we had some reports that people were using to track accounts receivable, stuff that had, you know, about 29 items on it that woke up the next morning with 488 on them. So

Speaker 1  1:05:33
it's not a big deal when it's on a screen, but when it starts printing paper, it's

Speaker 2  1:05:36
yeah, it went, it went from like a page and a half to being like, 15 pages long. There was, there was some, some pandemonium that took place.

Speaker 3  1:05:48
Mostly, I didn't, I never found anything out. And I was like, Well, I guess it's fun. I

Speaker 2  1:05:53
mean, it's mostly based around the fact that back in years past, 2020, 2220 20 some, 20. Well, yeah, 2022, 2021, there was a lot of marking sales orders as complete without ever zeroing out balances. And so we went to this logic, and it's, oh, this thing's invoice, but the balance is not at zero. And so, right, yeah. We very, we very quickly went and and decided that the system switch that says when accounting started is a great opportunity to exclude a whole bunch of stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:06:31
Yeah, yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
Good. Anything else?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
Wayne, Blaine bias,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
good. I try and

Speaker 1  1:06:50
get this updated and send out today yet, I think the priorities, I mean the top priority, well, I mean payment types is basically validating two is validating that works. So and then nothing to do there. That's that is working. Three to look at that today. Four is done. So it looks like five is is kind of the or we'll be spending your time on Seth, I believe is that that, and you have some sales tax? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
no, I'll some sales tax stuff to talk about with Matthias, some

Speaker 4  1:07:33
of the validation stuff when did not tighten down, or not tighten down, loosen up, I guess, figure out what it should be. Yeah. And then we have time blocked out this afternoon to work on that and the use tax, and we also do the 1099 filing report as well any changes we need with that.

Speaker 3  1:07:55
Do you know if the 10 Nine Nine filing changes will probably be done by the next update that

Unknown Speaker  1:08:02
I could have that pretty easily. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:06
All right. Very good. Good.

Speaker 4  1:08:07
One question I like on the last list of priorities you had sent, there was a whole bunch more after number five, are those still things you want to have happen at some point?

Speaker 1  1:08:21
Oh, we do, yeah, perfect. Are you going to need more? More things between now and

Speaker 4  1:08:27
I doubt it, we have a call on Monday. I think so. No, I'm not going to need more.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:34
It was good Monday. Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:36
no, I'm fine until then.

Speaker 5  1:08:39
Okay, okay, good, okay, cool. Thanks, everyone, Yep, thanks. Bye.
