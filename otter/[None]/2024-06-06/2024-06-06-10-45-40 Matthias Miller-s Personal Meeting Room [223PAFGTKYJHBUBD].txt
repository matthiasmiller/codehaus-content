Hello, hey.

Unknown Speaker  00:54
Jim said, how you doing?

Unknown Speaker  00:56
Good? How are you

Unknown Speaker  00:58
I'm doing well,

Unknown Speaker  01:02
okay, so

Speaker 1  01:07
it's about the HubSpot. I think the dashboard which we we are trying to build, let me share my screen, right?

Unknown Speaker  01:33
Can you see my screen?

Unknown Speaker  01:35
Yes, again,

Speaker 1  01:38
so this is the data we have in here, we have Spot, okay, are

Speaker 2  01:55
these companies or contacts?

Speaker 1  02:00
It's basically, it's the first one is blank. About Us is blank, address, countries, domains, basically. And there are, I think the sikkima used in this particular connection is not up to date or not accurate, as you can see, there are, we don't have any companies in here, so there are a lot More column which are not basically have a same data, like CRM, setting, object setting. These are the objects, I think. And so we need to fix that so it give us some kind of data.

Unknown Speaker  02:59
Yeah, let me take a look at this as well,

Unknown Speaker  03:07
right here.

Unknown Speaker  03:12
I mean, this looks like

Speaker 3  03:18
take a set index schema. I'm Yeah, it's pulling

Speaker 2  03:39
it's pulling companies, which doesn't make sense at all, that's that is useless.

Speaker 1  03:47
One thing is, you can talk with the this collector data do, and they can help you in that. And second is, maybe you can just give me an overview of what kind of data you want to see. Basically what I think this string, which is most probably in here, I

Unknown Speaker  04:24
the schema is in here.

Unknown Speaker  04:31
This schema need to be updated, right?

Speaker 2  04:37
We need, we need a if you go over to the advanced settings, right there, you'll see no one over one more. Yep, you'll see the under the transfer, under the URL, you'll see that they're pulling HubSpot companies in the transformation. You can see, and we don't use. Any we use contacts and deals.

Speaker 1  05:11
I think you can set up a meeting with the data do and just tell him, tell the team that which data you want to pull from the HubSpot, and I think they can help you right away and give you a script or these URLs. Okay, sounds good. Anything on Facebook,

Speaker 2  05:37
I didn't give a close I looked over, I think overall, it looks good, pain reach conversion rate and the bottom, it would be nice to have a cost per conversion as well.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
It's cost per conversion. It's 7.88

Speaker 2  06:02
but in the on the Kim campaign, maybe it doesn't matter. On the on the campaign, the top campaigns column, it could be useful, I don't know.

Speaker 1  06:15
So, these are the conversions. These are the conversions. Never

Speaker 2  06:19
mind. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Okay, it's a little confusing, because we've got cost per click and cost per conversion, both abbreviated to CPC. So

Unknown Speaker  06:31
fair enough.

Unknown Speaker  06:37
I'm just struggling with this table because this table is not showing the right date in here. So I'm checking the option. It's not the

Speaker 1  07:01
why? It's multiple. That's where my multiple we don't need or sorry, it's Max. Should be date. I

Speaker 1  07:27
I will check it out. Maybe Google studio have a it's a free thing, so it's most of the time. Give us a hard time to chat on the things got it.

Speaker 2  07:44
It almost needs broken, broken down by campaign or something. Yeah, I will let me send it over to i How about I'll be meeting with the client on Tuesday. How about, how about I go over with the client on Tuesday and give you any feedback on Tuesday? Is that okay? Okay?

Speaker 1  08:12
One more thing, I'm not available from 11th of June to 24th of June. I need to travel somewhere, so I'm not available. So it's from next Tuesday to one week, almost on 25th I will be available. So 11 to 24 I am 12 traveling, so I don't have my laptop with me, sure? Okay. Meanwhile, I can reply to an email if when I got mail and I try to fix that, so let's see what's happening there. Meanwhile, if you have any update on HubSpot, just mail me. So when I come back, I will work on that.

Unknown Speaker  09:00
Okay, sounds good. I will do that. Appreciate it. Jamshed,

Speaker 3  09:06
thank you. Yep, you're welcome.
