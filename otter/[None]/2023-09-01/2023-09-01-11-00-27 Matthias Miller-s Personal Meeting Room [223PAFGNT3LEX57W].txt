Matthias Miller  01:06
You been my best?

Unknown Speaker  01:45
Mark got to say Hi sir some documents This looks exciting

Unknown Speaker  02:13
Hey Mark How are you pretty good

Unknown Speaker  02:22
how you doing

Speaker 1  02:27
doing well I'm fighting a bad case of allergies but otherwise pretty good how when did you get back from vistors

Unknown Speaker  02:45
we

Matthias Miller  02:48
man if I would have thought everything through I might have planned our flights differently but we left we got back before lunch we got back home around noon on Monday so we got all the kids up at 430 in the morning and when we went yeah

Unknown Speaker  03:22
was she below really ill for a long time

Matthias Miller  03:31
No, um, to get diagnosed with cancer last November and did a successful round of treatments and by the summer she was cleared and then within the last

Unknown Speaker  03:48
I'm gonna say four weeks

Matthias Miller  03:51
she started having a lot of accumulation of fluid

Unknown Speaker  03:53
and

Matthias Miller  03:57
she has always been a super optimistic and very determined person. And I think a lot of us didn't really some of my nephews I've got two nephews who have done one who's working on being a doctor some the other one who's taking a good bit of medical training I'm not quite sure where he's going with it all but who caught on the severity of it but even until the Monday even I can't even keep my even even prior to last Monday. Most of us didn't. It didn't really sink into us how serious it was. Monday afternoon I got a call from LS basically saying if we want to if we want to see her we got to we got to get the

Unknown Speaker  04:46
next flight out. So yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:51
got the water.

Speaker 1  04:53
Sure that was emotional ride for ya. Just a lot of things to, to work through.

Matthias Miller  05:04
Yeah, it. It was and it still is. Yesterday would have been her 44th birthday. So

Unknown Speaker  05:16
a bunch of the family.

Matthias Miller  05:18
And if it's I think it's well, this has been the whole story, the whole process. It's been both celebration and grief. And I don't think those are at odds, but both and have celebrated and mourn her birthday yesterday with doughnuts and just I don't know. Yeah. It's kind of crazy to have that. That, right.

Speaker 2  05:46
I don't know, right in the midst of right on the heels. But yeah, it's a journey.

Unknown Speaker  05:57
Yeah, yeah, it's I've never, ever experienced that with both family. But it is kind of by the Wednesday, my sister in law is also at the point where

Speaker 1  06:22
the law, they basically she went into, while they're doing alternative treatments in Mexico and make they were at they just

Speaker 1  06:36
you know, he was just becoming weaker and weaker. And it seemed like everything was going the wrong way. And they finally went to another clinic. And with Ben's to, he has breast cancer while she had started in her limbs, but then she or she has breast cancer, and they were going to surgery to remove that. And then after they did the scans, they said I miss him know, and to round of chemo and this day, like they're going to do six or seven, plans out to do six or seven rounds. It's kind of hear you say that your sister was there after the initial rounds, and then back that quickly.

Matthias Miller  07:38
I think I've done just a bit of research into where the state of cancer and cancer treatments are at. But early detection still is the biggest thing you can do. But I think this gets pretty philosophical pretty quick. But if you reduce biology to strictly mechanical systems, I think you miss most of what how you can and should treat cancer. And when you understand it's, it's mind boggling to me how intelligent cells are. They are basically self programming computers. And so if you don't understand that, in light of cancer, like I don't I don't think even the science community? Well, I think quite frankly, I think a lot of the science community is approaching cancer from from much the wrong direction. But if you understand that cells are intelligent, have some are intelligent, whatever that means, then it makes sense that if you wage an all out war on an intelligent thing, then it's going to adapt and retaliate.

Speaker 1  09:12
Well through you could probably I mean, you've been your mom goes through this. She has

Unknown Speaker  09:19
about a year and a half ago.

Unknown Speaker  09:22
Oh, wow. Yeah.

Speaker 3  09:27
Yeah, that was after seven years. Well, from when it first showed up, as you battle it for about a year and a half to two and it was clear. And then yeah, it showed up in the summer and it was about six months later in the winter when she passed away from a mountain and that was definitely a thing of I mean, that was that intelligent thing was she was keeping it was keeping up with anything they could throw at them.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Yeah,

Speaker 1  10:02
that's that's that philosophical. I mean, like my sister in law, she's been battling with it for years. And they're strongly inclined to do alternative type treatments like stem cell therapies and all kinds of natural things which are now I've come to conclusion that make all these until I think route we choose to treat cancer any of us would know for sure what route to go until we're like, you know, when a lot of what they say makes sense that the natural treatments, you're using your man, I think that's what stem cell therapy supposed to do is boost yourself so that they can fight off the cancer themselves. But he also got to the point where they say, well, what's the only thing that we can only option anymore? So?

Unknown Speaker  11:25
It is,

Unknown Speaker  11:28
bases. And yeah.

Matthias Miller  11:31
It is the kind of thing where everybody has an opinion until

Unknown Speaker  11:35
they're in the situation.

Speaker 3  11:40
None everybody wants to give you that. Everybody knows stories of, of this person who did natural and it didn't work that person who did conventional and it didn't work. And

Matthias Miller  12:00
I think that's probably one of the things my sister was trying to avoid. Yeah, yes.

Speaker 1  12:12
And the other thing that I mean, you're whoever, whoever's. I think this is especially true for natural or for the alternative. occasion, occasionally, they'll they'll are extremely optimistic like with, you know? If they say, well, we can't help you anymore than they did. Most of them seemingly just don't say that. As at the point that they say, we can't help you anymore, then. Obviously, they want to help people, but also tell you that and they know that by going to go somewhere else so? Well, I think

Speaker 3  13:04
the thing with that is the year can conventional medical, their lines of defense are only so long. You know, they once they run out of treatments or pharmaceuticals, you know, and if those are if those if their short list of pharmaceuticals was not working, there is nothing else they can do. You know, whereas our natural biological approach, you're taking in the complexity of everything. And so there's, there's kind of always an elements of well, we don't really know, which also does leave opportunities for you know, there's something about my work yet. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:54
It's true.

Matthias Miller  13:56
There's, there's another whole field of study that I've found fascinating. And most many people in the medical profession, from what I've observed are unaware of this. But there are clear medical, third, clear scientific studies that demonstrate the connection between physical health, physical health and trauma and your emotional and mental health. And that's just one example drew to your point that people don't, the risk of cancer from trauma is actually higher than the risk of cancer from genetics. And so you really have to take a multidisciplinary approach if you're going to if you're actually going to

Unknown Speaker  14:58
to tackle it with it. Any, any credibility?

Speaker 1  15:05
But part of the I've heard I've heard that too that like stress and eliminate stress from our lives, but lots of stress over long periods of time are you saved to cancer? Not saying that everybody that has cancer is answered because of that. But it's it's I would I would be more like, if you try to eat healthy, a healthy balanced diet of your chances of staying healthy and I think best levels healthy. And it does the same thing.

Unknown Speaker  16:05
Well,

Speaker 1  16:05
should we dive into our agenda? So Well, first of all, Matthias, do you have updates or things to cover? I know there were a few emails back and forth. Should we cover that? The improvement you made to putting your or displaying GL account? Or transactions? allocations? Should we? Well, I guess that or do you have anything we should cover? Before we look at our AR process that we do and I have started putting together

Matthias Miller  16:54
the one thing I would like to mention is that asset management is ready for testing and will Well, sorry, is will be ready for testing. At the next update, which I believe should happen this weekend. Let me ping Josh just to confirm.

Unknown Speaker  17:21
So just

Matthias Miller  17:24
so I don't know if we want to do a walkthrough or if you guys just want to dive in and take a look.

Speaker 1  17:34
Are you suggesting doing a walkthrough Wednesday, or today? We could do B have to wait till the right. We can

Matthias Miller  17:44
kick off and updating the test system

Unknown Speaker  17:46
we could show you around there.

Matthias Miller  17:49
Or let's take a look at let's walk through in the list of things to take a look at and let's see what we've got on the table and

Unknown Speaker  17:59
go from there.

Speaker 1  18:02
Well, that's that's exciting. That's I mean, yeah, Drew and I don't think Dr. Even we haven't really looked at Asset Management. I've shown you any of that. But seems like it should be pretty straightforward. But also Yeah. That's, that's good. That's the type of thing that that to happen, you can start entering data in in entering that data and testing it so good. What about the

Unknown Speaker  18:44
updates on payroll module some of those reports for salaried employees is that still

Speaker 1  18:55
that's one of the things on your list and the fires are that backing up I should so on our site we're still we've been testing has not come along as fast as we've wanted. It's fast it's like to do that we're

Unknown Speaker  19:21
right now looks like we're going to start with one company with shed time take it live.

Speaker 1  19:29
Focus on taking that live first just get one company live and using it and then do the other soon. Soon after. But what I'm saying are rendering the data every week comparing it but we're not moving it forward like what I what I mean by moving it forward and taking the time to do it is is taking the old system putting it as They had the new system and walking me through through the steps like showing them, okay, here's what you would be get, here's what you'll be getting from assist. Here's why it's different from the old system, and this is, you know what you can expect. And here's how that's just going to take some quite a bit of time. And right now, frankly, we've always had things that were seemed to be higher priority, but it still is that that's where we're at on our site. I know you were making some changes on reports for salaried employees. Do you have any updates on that?

Matthias Miller  20:44
No, I got distracted with building the building impact, the accounting impact for buildings and sales orders. Josh, I discussed and we agreed that if we are going to make these be effective as of specific dates, then we can't use deltas in the same way that we were planning to.

Speaker 2  21:11
Which means that we need to redo how some of these things work. And so I got distracted with that last Wednesday, and

Matthias Miller  21:25
did not work more on payroll module

Unknown Speaker  21:27
stuff.

Speaker 1  21:35
Well, should we should we with where you're at? Where we're at? Should we put payroll module? Table those changes for right now? Make a point of coming back to look at those, I don't know, say 18th? Or the 25th?

Speaker 1  21:58
Or the Yeah, you're you tell me why what's the LFC? Got? We've we've been there? Like if we try to do two things at the same time. Typically, we don't do any of them. Well. But you know, what sounds really reasonable to you. As far as when, when we'd be ready to? Michael, that again?

Unknown Speaker  22:29
Well, here's,

Matthias Miller  22:31
here's how I look at it. We have one week before death priorities.

Unknown Speaker  22:36
And so

Matthias Miller  22:38
this next week is about anything that we need to do to get things squared away for that.

Matthias Miller  22:52
And yes, I think moving that out, probably makes sense.

Speaker 1  23:09
Well, here's what I think would be helpful for the dev priorities meeting. I think that's a good point. Drew just bring you up to speed we have a every two months, we have what we call a development priorities meeting where Gosh, Matthias ellos, and then owners of each of the companies, he calls in the companies and Dwayne and I get on a call and we That's why our software development priorities are for the next two months. So that everyone will bite well, so that we all hear those pains. pain points are in so that we all hear the same thing and have a consensus on what we're focusing on for the day. That's what my priorities what we're referencing there.

Speaker 1  24:13
But Matthias, would it be like if it seems like what would be helpful is, if you would have a here's where we're at with accounting, asset management is ready for testing cash flow statements, whatever, all of those different and then we could add, like we could see, when does it make sense to look at payroll? Yeah, that might be kind of what you're what you're

Unknown Speaker  24:53
gotta get some of the stuff on my side. So that's gonna happen automatically if Jan occation that's for you guys. To report mapping we needed it's

Unknown Speaker  25:20
management this is

Unknown Speaker  25:31
so this one is

Speaker 2  25:45
once coded accounting settings the company I need to check in on I believe this one

Speaker 2  25:59
don't think that's anything we have to pursue. Josh had been working on ACH payments, but that's going to be deferred. Josh is working on AP integration.

Matthias Miller  26:10
Joe's working in cash flow.

Matthias Miller  26:17
Alright, so

Unknown Speaker  26:26
you guys are

Matthias Miller  26:27
testing FTA allocations? Well, if you choose to at least you could start partially testing that if you wanted to, you don't have to. And then testing accounting and the live system, you'll be testing Asset Management. Is there anything else that you guys are currently testing that we should be aware of?

Speaker 1  26:53
We're manually testing entering accounts payable. But I mean, that's not I don't. Is there anything else true that we're really were testing? The payroll module? Obviously. DREW? Isn't that involved with that?

Unknown Speaker  27:15
Um, no, I mean, we were working on those

Unknown Speaker  27:23
allocation things. But

Unknown Speaker  27:27
at this point, we're not necessarily doing anything with that.

Matthias Miller  27:32
So based on the testing that you have, when do you need something new from us to sink your teeth into?

Unknown Speaker  27:44
I'm sorry, could you say that again?

Matthias Miller  27:47
Like if we if you don't get anything new from us, like the AP, automated AP integration, the allocation stuff, etc. How long until you guys start beating down our door and asking, asking for more stuff to test?

Unknown Speaker  28:11
I'm

Unknown Speaker  28:13
probably too long normally. Sorry, what was? What was that?

Unknown Speaker  28:27
I missed that.

Unknown Speaker  28:30
I was wondering what Mark would say on that?

Speaker 1  28:35
Well, I think as far as actual testing Yeah, I would agree with to that. It feels like there's not a whole lot in test way with where we're at right now. No. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:57
So so the okay, there's some work that drew and Aaron want to do on

Speaker 1  29:05
cleaning up. Eric de la Collins, which is a thing really, Drew is going to be entering a month worth of arrays working on entering a month worth of fences using the new GL accounts and manually entering that the goal is that that'll take some time, but that's really going to counting functions.

Matthias Miller  29:41
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  29:44
I'm sorry, no, keep going. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1  29:47
Well, I don't know that. I mean, the chart I think the chart of accounts is basically set up. Like we're not at a point I don't think that we're at a point where we can start entering There's a whole host of questions that I would have like at what point do we start entering? Vendor? vendor information, bank account information, all of that. I mean, I don't think we're at that point yet where we're ready to start doing that. But are we at a point where we could start doing that?

Matthias Miller  30:24
We will need vendor information in time to test vendor invoices, I believe. Josh would have to confirm bank account information seems like well, if you don't have anything else to do, that's not wasted work, but not really necessary. I think

Matthias Miller  30:51
okay, so So I think if you guys had the way to run actually run the actually create the transactions for the buildings that would give you that would be a quick win. That would give you guys some more things to test.

Speaker 1  31:13
Now, okay, explain what what do you mean by the, for the buildings are you seeing as they're built daily, as they're built by the transactions for standard costing?

Matthias Miller  31:29
Well, so with the changes we're making, you'll be able to apply the, you'll be able to create all the historical transactions as of the appropriate date. And in including whatever's required for variances as well. So

Matthias Miller  31:59
So currently, you can see,

Unknown Speaker  32:00
here, let me

Matthias Miller  32:07
mark, you can't see this. I'm gonna pull this up for Drew. I'll

Unknown Speaker  32:11
just walk out here and just walk out here.

Matthias Miller  32:16
Maybe we'll maybe do we not have a we'd have an allocation record

Speaker 4  32:27
put an allocation record in this is in the test system?

Unknown Speaker  32:32
Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  32:35
Actually, nevermind, I took that impact report live. So you wouldn't be able to see it. So let's go to Indiana, there's a diagnostic mode that makes it a little easier to read. And so this shows you. Here, it was built on the 15th, delivered on

Unknown Speaker  33:07
the 25th.

Matthias Miller  33:09
And these would effectively be the trans transactions that would be created for for each building.

Matthias Miller  33:22
And here, you see one that has variance in it. So 306 75, you go over here.

Unknown Speaker  33:32
I say, yeah, here's the variance 306 75 for raw material.

Unknown Speaker  33:49
So

Matthias Miller  33:50
as far as I know, I didn't make any I mean, the debit and credit columns match up? I'm not aware of any it's possible that it wouldn't hurt to double check this make sure this is still working as you would expect. But to my knowledge, probably the the most challenging thing here is the account. Like here's a negative variance.

Unknown Speaker  34:20
If you don't know the account numbers, it's a little confusing what what's what we should have

Unknown Speaker  34:34
not seeing a negative variance.

Matthias Miller  34:38
So in this case, in this case, the negative variance shows up as a credit to production overhead. Which means if you drill in production overhead has a negative variance here and so it gets added as a credit instead of a debit.

Speaker 5  34:58
So what we're seeing here Is okay the date? Is that the transaction date? Yes. And then it's it's broken up or it's it's displayed, or building or first in number. Correct? Okay, so when a building is built, yeah, debit and credit or raw materials production

Unknown Speaker  35:33
so why?

Unknown Speaker  35:35
Okay, so why does this one? What is it? Like? I'm looking at one here that

Speaker 5  35:42
like when a building is built goals and then have six transactions but okay, this is to deliver so that you are you clear on on what we're seeing here? Like what we doubled to double check?

Unknown Speaker  36:01
Not really

Unknown Speaker  36:07
production.

Speaker 4  36:09
So there's that one was a trend or nine transactions is that one just has extra variances, I guess. Three raw materials at the top, whereas the next one down as two? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  36:33
These these three rows would be variances, which we're creating a separate line items rather than lumping them together we could I would be open if this would be helpful. We could add memos to each of these lines that explains you know, I don't know, like FTI source. That's helpful though.

Unknown Speaker  37:06
This is in the live system?

Unknown Speaker  37:09
Yes, this is in the live system.

Speaker 5  37:14
Okay, and there would be no variances unless we did an actual actual cost allocation. Right?

Unknown Speaker  37:25
Correct.

Speaker 4  37:29
So that would be based on that test cost allocation that we did, which means nothing.

Speaker 5  37:41
Has that cast allocation in wiped out like all of that?

Speaker 4  37:46
That's that's what I'm wondering. Does that other cleared out? So we tried to do and had all those errors? Oh.

Matthias Miller  38:03
So we would want to look at

Matthias Miller  38:12
the errors should not have impacted

Speaker 2  38:19
it. But

Speaker 4  38:25
oh, this is just the actual cost allocations not? How's the difference? They're

Matthias Miller  38:33
not how it's actually applied.

Unknown Speaker  38:37
To accounting but

Unknown Speaker  38:38
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  38:41
Preview cost adjustments. That's

Unknown Speaker  38:42
what I'm looking for.

Matthias Miller  38:47
But I mean, if this is if this is right, let's go pick a building for fun. We're just wanting

Unknown Speaker  38:53
this guy.

Matthias Miller  38:58
So here is this guy. Yeah. We said the standard cost was 4423. This is

Unknown Speaker  39:05
on which one are we on?

Matthias Miller  39:11
This is on the raw materials. We said raw materials was 4423. The actual adjusted cost was 4813.

Unknown Speaker  39:22
Which

Unknown Speaker  39:25
should be

Matthias Miller  39:35
389 26 which is the variance here, which I believe is I mean as long as your actual costs that were entered are correct. Then this report should be correct with all of its variances. I do think we

Speaker 4  39:52
well we had done before on that part of it was coming out it seemed like it was coming out right

Matthias Miller  39:59
now But the part that we need to do here is all of these guys was it just shut time that we tried to create transactions for Yeah, let's actually do

Unknown Speaker  40:18
actually do this

Unknown Speaker  40:26
while on

Unknown Speaker  40:37
Jeopardy, let's go it should be shown the same thing, okay and then we're just going to do a

Unknown Speaker  40:53
find the leading them normally you would wait them out but

Matthias Miller  41:19
okay, so then these, so that takes care of the transactions, so. So this is still the transaction that would end up being created, you're not able to actually you're gonna get an error, if you try to create them. It's just

Unknown Speaker  41:37
it's just not even gonna

Matthias Miller  41:39
try to run. So that needs to be fixed so that you can then run income statements and, and look at it from an income statement and balance sheet perspective. So it seems to me like giving you the chance to apply those changes, so that you can see the income statement and balance sheet as it relates to these buildings being built and delivered would be the next next most helpful thing for you.

Speaker 4  42:12
So yeah, in order to do that, we need to get our costs in there. Which is what we're trying to do now.

Speaker 5  42:23
forecasting, what would this is? This is the transactions that will be pushed to accounting. The part we don't have yet is it showing directly on the income statement balance sheet. But testing these, like taking a handful of these and testing, make sure that the transactions are Greg is what we should we tested?

Unknown Speaker  42:46
Current Yes.

Unknown Speaker  42:51
That makes sense. Okay, explain the deeds that like, let's just start the first one. Nine, that means that building was delivered on eight, nine, right?

Matthias Miller  43:06
That is correct. And so therefore, we will create the transaction as of that date. Now, there, there are some nuances here, which I think we said we don't want to date it prior to the last closed period date. So we're not handling that yet. There's and there's other other things we need to lock down like, you shouldn't be able to change a building built date if the building built date is within a closed period. Because it'll have an accounting impact, you shouldn't be able to modify any FTI costs if the building was built within a closed date, because that'll impact accounting, etc. But yes, the date here is the date that it was delivered.

Speaker 5  43:53
So then if we go down to the fourth building here, looks like it was built the 19th and then deliver it the 20 seat. That is correct. Now, do we have any here that like how does it look when it was a building in that locker ceiling where we did an actual cost allocation with that have a that was what 815 When did we do that allocation? Wasn't a date it as a like we have? I think we should

Unknown Speaker  44:25
it was before that? I'm not sure? Yeah, maybe it was

Matthias Miller  44:34
531

Unknown Speaker  44:38
That's, I mean, that's weird.

Unknown Speaker  44:44
That's the one we put in manually.

Speaker 5  44:46
That was the range the range of buildings from 515 to 531. But where are those variance transactions going to show up? Well

Matthias Miller  45:02
that variance shows up

Matthias Miller  45:10
in this building okay let's still dig into this building and see if we can figure it out. So for some

Unknown Speaker  45:19
reason

Speaker 5  45:22
that yeah is a team

Matthias Miller  45:27
so you would have applied let's see if we can see when you apply this I think I think this is the case where you apply the actual cost

Unknown Speaker  45:40
no

Matthias Miller  45:42
the on 815 You would have applied the actual cost and so that means that and it was it had already been delivered and So

Matthias Miller  46:06
originally, we would not have included these line items with the variance after you would apply to it we would have gone back to the 614 transaction when it was delivered. And we would have applied that as a variance and we would have adjusted the raw materials asset accounts

Matthias Miller  46:31
to account for that

Unknown Speaker  46:37
wait, no Oh, that's weird.

Matthias Miller  46:47
And we would also have gone back and modified the I mean, we didn't

Unknown Speaker  46:56
why is this one not

Matthias Miller  46:59
if the building had been built within in May, which apparently the building was built was built in May Why doesn't it have a building built event?

Unknown Speaker  47:08
What's weird

Speaker 2  47:23
that's really weird. So let's go give this a try here let's do this let's put this stent in here

Matthias Miller  47:44
reason was because we didn't this mapping was affected as of the 31st. So if you want to see

Matthias Miller  48:03
you allocated costs, we're not seeing any buildings that were built from May 1 to May 30. Because even though we allocated actual cost to them there's no financial allocation rule set up for the beginning of May for that for those 30 days in May. So if we were to change this financial allocation I don't know if you guys want to do this but if you change this to be effective on five one

Unknown Speaker  48:31
well, let me just show you what happens then

Matthias Miller  48:35
we can now map it out to the appropriate accounts and you would see here

Unknown Speaker  48:46
and

Unknown Speaker  48:48
no

Matthias Miller  48:56
this isn't right is it

Unknown Speaker  49:05
4423 to 33

Unknown Speaker  49:20
pretty confused here

Matthias Miller  49:21
let me try let me do something here

Unknown Speaker  49:28
let's go into

Unknown Speaker  49:38
Yeah. Evening There's

Unknown Speaker  50:19
gonna be better way what's to even this would help

Unknown Speaker  50:34
yeah

Unknown Speaker  50:48
okay so

Matthias Miller  50:56
So we debit FGI raw material 10 for 105 but then we credit it yeah this is wrong isn't it? Because we should credited by the original amount because it's no longer in finished goods but we should actually do an additional

Unknown Speaker  51:39
debit of the FTI source

Unknown Speaker  51:47
pay records is

Matthias Miller  51:51
the variance should actually come from the FDI source account is that right

Speaker 5  52:01
bearing and so what we're saying is we thought it was going to we thought it used $1,400 worth of materials and instead it used 1500 that variance

Speaker 5  52:22
well we would increase where it's sitting now like completed buildings are finished goods inventory and increased the amount that was used by the same amount out of raw materials right now

Unknown Speaker  52:51
So, here this would be an allocation

Unknown Speaker  53:17
variants This is a little janky but

Matthias Miller  53:31
okay then actual or standard this is still the

Unknown Speaker  53:37
instead of the actual or standard

Unknown Speaker  53:45
we just want these we just want this to be standard costs

Speaker 2  54:08
okay so then Well that really changes things.

Matthias Miller  54:15
So, from raw material we created raw materials finished goods, raw materials finished goods raw materials finished goods then on delivery

Matthias Miller  54:31
still the wrong amount

Unknown Speaker  54:35
of inventory or am I actually oh this should be I did the wrong one should be standard cost Okay.

Matthias Miller  54:49
So then, so then we still we used we always use standard cost when taking it out of the original on the date of no we can't do that the variance has to be applied at the time of build to adjust raw material in the FGI amount

Speaker 5  55:21
Okay, now the variance would need to be applied when we do the actual cost like we say we go through the month that we think this is what it's going to be we think this is what it's going to be and then we get to the end of the month like 10 days beyond the end of the month. Now we know what actual costs were and we say oh, we spent

Unknown Speaker  55:43
labor cost $5,000 More than we thought it would. How do we what do we do with that? By $1,000? And I think the I ideally that would, we would apply that variance on the last day of the period we were looking at like we looked at

Speaker 5  56:17
five so we looked at the period of 515 to 531. But it was quite some time later ideally we would apply that variance as of 531.

Matthias Miller  56:43
Even if it hasn't been expensed yet

Speaker 5  56:51
like okay, that's right. Like what if it's

Matthias Miller  56:55
if it's still in inventory as a 531 Then we should adjust the inventory item the inventory value

Unknown Speaker  57:03
Yeah, that should increase Yeah, agreed.

Unknown Speaker  57:11
Okay, so let me do this this is not quite right but it's closer to right

Unknown Speaker  57:24
let's do

Unknown Speaker  57:43
it okay so there's that

Unknown Speaker  58:31
okay

Unknown Speaker  58:35
okay

Unknown Speaker  58:55
you okay

Matthias Miller  59:11
well, that was not what I wanted to see, but it was productive

Matthias Miller  59:23
so, a building can have up to three transactions up to three transactions, one, when it's built to end the end of period variants being applied either to either to the, I mean always from the source from the raw materials, source account or and then applied to either FDI or cogs expense. And then third expense out at the final delivery.

Speaker 5  1:00:01
I think that's yeah, I think that's because I think, the end of the period of what you're looking at? Well, okay, you could I think that's the cleanest to allocate it at that point, because you're basically saying, Here's what we guess the amounts to be throughout the period. And now we're at, now we have information as of for this period. So let's just go back and fix it, fix it all up on the last day, kind of like, very similar to what we do on inventory adjustment. Our inventory counts and then adjusting it. Last day of the month, I think, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:00:51
Sounds great to me. So that's next step. For me. This is still on the question of what pieces do you need next after that? When do you guys want sales order accounting impact? Is that next for you guys? I mean, is that next after this? Well,

Speaker 5  1:01:16
sales are counting impact, which ties into the AR process that we mapped out. I think that is just because, well, some of it for your testing do, but also it'll require a fair amount of process changes

Unknown Speaker  1:01:37
in our companies, and I think, yeah, so we blocked off from one to two, I don't know how much.

Speaker 5  1:01:49
If you have more time, we could still go through that too. and I are fine to go longer. But What's your schedule like?

Matthias Miller  1:01:59
Well, I would vote for a quick five minute break. And then I can go all the way to 330. That's fine.

Speaker 5  1:02:08
I don't know that this? Sure. Let's take a quick break.

Speaker 5  1:02:18
Do you want to do five 10 or 210. Regroup again at 210. Yeah, that's that's fine. You said if you do back to back meetings, the research shows your brain harms mush. I think mine's turning to mush.

Matthias Miller  1:02:40
Let's do that. I like it. And we'll

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
We'd be endless. Well?

Speaker 5  1:11:44
Ready to look at AR processes?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
Yes. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:11:50
I'm ready for ER.

Speaker 5  1:11:53
Pretty excited about this. I think Laurie brought some clarity to some parts that are going to, from business perspective greatly help. So what we tried to put together here, is it a business process? And then it says, when I say you have a copy of that flowchart?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
Yes, I do I can. I can share this too, so that we can all see it.

Matthias Miller  1:12:27
I've also got a printed copy

Speaker 5  1:12:39
I think I need to move to Colorado to take care of my halogens male mice sister. She has since she's moved out there she her allergies are gone. Ah,

Matthias Miller  1:12:54
well, I'm pretty sure some folks would miss you out there. But I'm pretty sure we could communicate just a bit more or, or communication to be just a bit more streamlined if you did.

Speaker 5  1:13:07
My wife would move up there. I think she would, while I convinced her to move. Wow. Well, anyway. So we've got business processes, the left column assists. As I said, it says minus the accounting portion, and then the accounting transactions and then all the way to the right. And the ending financial reports where we would expect to see so handling sales orders, you'll notice that in a dashed line that that is only one thing we've we've clearly defined is we will have to have a sales order created for every thing that we expect to collect money on. Whether it's two by fours sold to a walk in customer or a window or things sold employs all of those. That's the only way we'll be able to track it, put it in its great GL account. Good do ar on it. So right now it's just sort of a it's a very open ended process. So I don't we didn't talk through any of this AR stuff with you too. I'm getting confused. I think that was blurry. Some of those different examples that we pulled out, right?

Matthias Miller  1:14:32
Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:33
think I think so.

Speaker 5  1:14:36
Okay, so. So I'm seeing if we create a handle, we can create a handwritten sales order off. We just have to get it to Brian's office and they have to recreate it in pieces for every one of those when I mean, yeah. Yeah. And once the sales order is created. Then we go all the way down to that Watch this transit task it says, Is there a transit test? If no, then it immediately goes to report a sales orders ready to invoice? And if yes, then we wait till the transit task is completed the final location meaning the delivery has been made to the final location. Now, one thing that I'm gonna talk about a little bit on that report of sales orders ready to invoice. Larry says, that needs to be a key defining point in your process. When you invoice like it's a invoice as a verb, we have been thinking more of it automatically changes to when it's delivered or whatever state then it becomes an invoice. But what he's suggesting is that we have a report that someone actually looks at and manually updates says, Yes, this is ready to invoice. This is ready to invoice This is ready to invoice which triggers a whole bunch of which is what I'm showing here. Going back to the district manager reviews mean it basically be they get a list every day of here's all the buildings that were delivered yesterday. Here's everything that USCIS thinks should be invoiced, and they go down through and say, check, mark all of the season. Yeah, so you gotta get back on Twain's office and then they're marked as invoice which changes it from a sales order to an invoice. And then we would again, he suggested on our sales order, listing and as estimated tax on the sales order until the point where we invoice then we would ping tax jargon for the excise tax. It's rare that that will change but it could change from the time if there's a tax rate from the time the customer gets a quote, or the initial sales

Unknown Speaker  1:17:21
invoice

Speaker 5  1:17:23
and then sales order now becomes an invoice. Which what I like about that defining like yes, this is ready to invoice is that determines when it becomes sales revenue, there's now there's no longer any gray areas of like, looking at your revenue for a month on the financial report. Was this you know, what's what's included? What's not? Right? They're actually looking at it and so yes, this is ready. This is really the invoice knowing that that Bucha subtotal is going to get sales revenue, which all of the debits and credits with their sales revenue, standard cogs, finished goods inventory could also be raw materials depending on what it is

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
all of those

Speaker 5  1:18:25
all of those transactions. So before we go into collecting payments, and stop there, just I'm sure you have some questions on why this is a little different. I think the biggest difference is the instead of changing those statuses automatically require a manual step to turn it into Indianized.

Matthias Miller  1:18:51
So yes, I do have a question.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:57
me see if I can look at one first

Unknown Speaker  1:19:05
so

Matthias Miller  1:19:18
who's going to help us navigate? How we assign invoice dates for historical sales orders? How does this interact with I mean, we have s the sales order creation date we have the sales order sale date. Do we still keep the sale date?

Speaker 5  1:19:52
You're saying for historical what do we use as the invoice date?

Matthias Miller  1:19:59
So already? Yes, I mix two questions. One is, what do we use as an invoice date historically? Can we just use the latest of presumably we just use the latest of the sale date or the creation date?

Speaker 5  1:20:13
No, the date we want to use the the delivery date or it's something like, final, final location when it's delivered to the final location, which is usually the delivery date. I think it's always the delivery date.

Matthias Miller  1:20:35
But then for the ones that aren't delivered,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:40
we can use

Speaker 5  1:20:42
the sales order creation date, we won't have to get started. But yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
And then the other question is, how does sale date? How does the sale date on the sales order really with this?

Speaker 5  1:21:01
The only time that comes into has any effect is if it's a if there's no transit task, which means we are not doing we are not responsible for delivery. So either it's a cash and carry item which then we would just use the sales order creation date as the invoice date. Well, we would get we would use a sales order. You're still talking about historical

Matthias Miller  1:21:34
sales orders, well, are we even talking going forward? Because

Speaker 5  1:21:51
well, so going forward, we would use or another way to say this is going forward, we would say the day that we create the sales order is the day that we believe that should be invoiced unless we're doing delivery right

Matthias Miller  1:22:20
so do you have any any context for how the sale date field gets used on a sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:22:29
mean how it's how it's currently being used?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:32
Yeah

Speaker 5  1:22:38
I mean, it's being used to track things like sales on sales report and it's that spot

Matthias Miller  1:22:50
got it so that's strictly from a that makes sense. So that's strictly from a it's basically just there for the sales sales team in the reporting Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:03
Got it. That makes sense

Speaker 4  1:23:09
so that's when the guy says he's gonna buy is what that's okay. So it's not a it's not a sale for the company to sale for the salesman

Unknown Speaker  1:23:21
more than an order yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:23:29
depending on which site that's yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35
I remember when this right he's no longer there but he got a new CFO and he was like

Speaker 5  1:23:42
this they're not It's not sales it's just orders like this is just people say they want it it's not sales until you actually know it's not more than

Matthias Miller  1:23:58
don't try to ruin a salespersons day

Unknown Speaker  1:24:04
at the end of the day sales is what drives everything

Matthias Miller  1:24:13
we could actually if we wanted to clarify it we could rename still date to order date. I don't know if that makes it too confusing elsewhere but

Speaker 5  1:24:28
no, that's that's, that's better. And that's okay.

Matthias Miller  1:24:38
Or I should be should be making better density scribbling on this paper but

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
alright, so

Matthias Miller  1:24:50
I had a s o, invoice date

Unknown Speaker  1:24:56
or historical invoices populate it to the delivery date if it has a to a shouldn't date

Matthias Miller  1:25:21
rename so

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22
sale date to so ordered date

Unknown Speaker  1:25:33
Okay, well that's

Matthias Miller  1:25:35
pretty straightforward. Keep going

Speaker 5  1:25:44
okay, oh, there's some other I don't know if now's the time to talk about so for this example I use if you want to look at invoices actually might be helpful if you just pull up this invoice and maybe just share our screen it's and 2303589

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
Send your your copy you made a bunch of notes

Unknown Speaker  1:26:34
Oh yeah, I think he did. Let me

Unknown Speaker  1:26:40
close this out so you can read it better?

Speaker 5  1:27:07
Up Okay, so can you open the actual PDF that the customer would see? Yeah.

Speaker 5  1:27:28
Yeah, so a few things like, top right, where we have invoice and two, technically, technically, we shouldn't call that sales order it we should say sales order instead of invoice until the act of Invoicing is done.

Speaker 5  1:28:12
And then another thing that we think would be helpful for us for reporting is instead of saying and while it's still a sales order, we would say as Oh, we would keep the number the same but while it's still a sales order, it would say sales order as Oh, and then the number and then when it comes an invoice it would turn into what you see now invoice and that way if you're looking across a list of say a mix list of sales orders and invoices, you could see the SL ones and the reason I would suggest doing so instead of just as is because we already have is we're using an COVID skin like our buildings in

Matthias Miller  1:28:59
so this is me being a little bit persnickety here but I generally dislike the idea of using a capital O because

Speaker 5  1:29:12
well, so what do you suggest I'm not agree that's that's a bad idea. So first when we're using as in for invoices, we didn't use it for the same reason we just use an array

Matthias Miller  1:29:33
I'm a second letter

Unknown Speaker  1:29:38
yes just use a

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
I mean we may we understand what

Unknown Speaker  1:29:47
great

Speaker 4  1:29:49
remember maybe when changed a lot but first then you know there you have more first letters to use. And then just use ask for this but

Unknown Speaker  1:29:59
wow we could you know

Speaker 4  1:30:01
how braiding the whole orchard just put an apple

Speaker 5  1:30:07
if I could I mean radical and sheet of paper I think that's what I would use S T there and then just ask yourself then we have S S is sales order enters the invoice but it'd be okay

Matthias Miller  1:30:31
well, another option would be don't know if I really liked this but it is an option. A double S proof. Okay, we use skin all over the place like the skin is actually on the inside of the actual building isn't it?

Speaker 5  1:30:50
Yeah, it is. It says s whatever. So So

Matthias Miller  1:30:57
I kinda think we're past the point of no return on that one. Yeah. So we could we could do

Speaker 5  1:31:21
kinda like the idea of a single letter just because we have asked we have and we use the dollar sign

Matthias Miller  1:31:34
I like that Why would we use the letter M? Again, this has no meaning but it precedes it comes before invoice so prior to an invoice it's an M, when it's invoiced it's an n then that becomes confusing if you're reading it off on the phone

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
Oh Good gracious that's terrible too

Unknown Speaker  1:32:00
we can use our I suppose for order but

Unknown Speaker  1:32:03
we're

Unknown Speaker  1:32:13
it's not I mean

Matthias Miller  1:32:18
I don't know I mean at the end of the day you can do what you want I just I I'm nervous about having

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
to have a letter to beginning

Unknown Speaker  1:32:34
that might be a good option actually sales order or just

Speaker 4  1:32:39
just order number so on so I don't know what logic

Speaker 5  1:32:43
can be used for quotes we also number of quotes I think we use a different number I'm pretty

Unknown Speaker  1:32:50
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:32:59
so by any ID number so Id but base

Unknown Speaker  1:33:06
so I'm pretty sure it starts with cue up

Unknown Speaker  1:33:18
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:19
yeah it's a different

Matthias Miller  1:33:31
Well, I don't think the art is a bad idea.

Speaker 5  1:33:35
No, I I'd say let's plan to use that if we figure out something else it's the next day or two that we some reason think is better than this is one of those things that what I like about processes developing themes is whatever we decide to use there's probably going to we've got to continue to use that for the rest of time pretty much

Unknown Speaker  1:34:04
why is there an art here? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:34:08
we can document it. Oh, it was confusing. So it was already used our art or

Unknown Speaker  1:34:17
third harder

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
so so other thing on the sales order specifically is the tags. The small thing that I think we should say estimated tax until until it becomes an invoice miniature to say.

Speaker 5  1:34:56
Yep, and then the price says would change so right now when we think tax jar isn't when we grade the initial break

Unknown Speaker  1:35:13
well what yeah

Speaker 5  1:35:14
when are we pinging tax jar a bond initial creation of a quote only sales order and then storing that rate for all for the well what happens if we then make a revision like we don't know we add delivery No, we don't add delivery but we change something on the building does it impact again let me ask him questions. No, really need no answers it's important thing is that we pink tax jar at the end when we go to invoice get the actual

Speaker 5  1:36:08
we don't currently do sales tax reporting tax taxed I was paying them for the rate but if we ever do I think we have a precise defining moment. When are we paying them so I think that was pretty much all on the sales order. Yeah. Right through the rest of the stuff as far as GL accounts and all that. That's yeah. So if you go back to the the diagram

Unknown Speaker  1:36:58
there's

Unknown Speaker  1:37:05
no

Unknown Speaker  1:37:08
do you have

Speaker 5  1:37:10
Okay, we'd started with asking if you have questions and I think we kind of went off on the sales order. So other questions on what we've covered so far?

Matthias Miller  1:37:27
One question is can we treat so basically as soon as you record a payment we can treat that as an undeposited fund

Speaker 4  1:37:44
as long as as long as it is invoice if it's not invoice should be going to liability so that's part of why we're creating the whole point of invoice.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:07
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:38:11
Okay, so here for example, we have 8600 going to and so it's to undeposited funds debiting any positive funds crediting customer deposits, right.

Speaker 5  1:38:28
All payments will go through undeposited funds that are they go from there is determined on the status of determining whether sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
right.

Matthias Miller  1:38:44
So all payments prior to the invoice date would go to customer deposits.

Speaker 5  1:38:53
Know that to do to define that, all payments prior that is

Matthias Miller  1:38:59
if you follow

Speaker 5  1:39:02
the metal background work, we're collecting customers down payment, let's say by a dealer. And then once the next step is fun to move to possession of an override of authorized personnel which is basically going to be someone that the parent company's affordable one companies share time or vinyl structures or Duane Dwayne's office. And then, if it's, if it's a Dwayne's office, and they're going to enter directly into the undeposited funds saying we have this in possession. It enters undeposited funds. If it's in one of the builders hands, then they'll have to communicate that information randomly and with a handwritten cash or cheque received form filled out, which then also gets deposited funds

Speaker 5  1:40:00
But the timing on that it's considered Well, if but this is a, let's say there was an example where a customer showed up ordered a building and he said, I'll give you $1,000 down payment. If for some reason that check was never passed on to was never listed on on your positive fund until after the building was delivered any invoice, then choose that wouldn't account it wouldn't treat that as a customer deposit or a down payment it would go directly be applied directly to against the balance in AR

Speaker 5  1:40:57
the customer deposit the like the and okay, it's until we have it listed in us is on undeposited funds. We basically say we think it's out there the money is out there somewhere but we don't believe it until we've actually received now we'll have to have a bunch of notes and visibility on that. For the collections people just in an update on that as

Unknown Speaker  1:41:30
we're looking to move

Speaker 5  1:41:33
the responsibility for collections to Dwayne's office entirely so in that situation they'd have to have visibility might be getting ahead of myself a little bit here but the collections people we want to be them to be working right off AR like what's still what are balances outstanding balances the oldest outstanding balances but then they might look at the first one and it says this one's 4010 days old, they look at the notes and it says costumer drop check at dealers office on so and so date and then now they're going to respect that and assume that it just hasn't made its way through the system to be positive as it's still outstanding

Unknown Speaker  1:42:37
makes things make sense so so

Unknown Speaker  1:42:56
I think we just have migraines now we have this on the payment we already have this on the

Unknown Speaker  1:43:14
Yeah, on here we have the payment type and the payment account

Speaker 5  1:43:19
we've kept it simple here on this flowchart we just talked about cash and Chase We didn't talk about credit card ACH or RTO

Unknown Speaker  1:43:29
it's sales or finance

Unknown Speaker  1:43:38
financing as

Matthias Miller  1:43:42
well financing doesn't really know because sometimes financing some of your financing options get paid directly to you some of them get paid to the customer

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
that's pretty interesting. Also the

Speaker 5  1:44:05
the rent to own will also be luxurious and I suggest we first look at just cash and cheque and then we look at those other payments

Unknown Speaker  1:44:30
now we don't have

Matthias Miller  1:44:48
a problem in the final payment

Unknown Speaker  1:44:57
Yeah, no, yes I mean, I think it makes sense

Speaker 5  1:45:13
the bottom section there, it's just really, it just follows pretty much the same thing as collecting a costume, it's down payment. One thing that's different final payment collected monthly possession then follows undeposited funds

Speaker 5  1:45:37
well, actually no that yeah, that is almost the same process, which is applies to different GL accounts. If you look between the my first set of financial reports and the second set ages, I just automatically the deposit into the bank account just happened if you'll notice the bank account mysteriously increased at 600. In that timeframe, we didn't spell out the steps but we said this, what we have here covers AR and then the rest is like reconciling with the bank and which we need to talk about but I think this is more or less a separate process.

Speaker 4  1:46:33
You have in your notes under the accounting impact there the third one was transfer from undeposited funds or accounts receivable to the destination account. They should all like whether it was a deposit before or whether went to the accounts receivable they should all go to undeposited funds.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:59
Right?

Speaker 4  1:47:01
And then yeah, because then you're you're just reconciling undeposited funds with with your deposits then for your account right.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:12
So

Unknown Speaker  1:47:23
first, right,

Speaker 4  1:47:26
then when when the building gets invoiced then any of those customer deposits get moved from the customer deposit against that that sale amount you know so it'd be you know if it's an $8,000 building and the 1000 down payment you know those $8,000 1000 would come from the customer deposits account or would go to whichever and then the remaining seven would go to AR right

Matthias Miller  1:48:16
it's these notes are kind of well no I mean

Speaker 5  1:48:45
upon invoicing another thing that you would do would be if if there is sales tax you would move that amount accrued taxes if you want to

Matthias Miller  1:49:04
think I can just say this

Speaker 5  1:49:10
so when you say it expands out sales order what what does that mean?

Matthias Miller  1:49:20
Well I'm using very loose approximate terms but for a building well, they're the building expenses are actually driven off of I'm sorry, building expenses are driven off of

Speaker 5  1:49:46
ending Are you are you talking about what's in the income statement?

Matthias Miller  1:49:51
This is all in all.

Matthias Miller  1:49:59
This is all I mean? I'm trying to I'm being intentionally vague but it's basically here

Matthias Miller  1:50:17
I'm handling accessory income account building income accounts shipping income account

Unknown Speaker  1:50:23
discounts

Speaker 5  1:50:28
yeah this is yeah this is it's pretty much the same thing you had here I believe except this has a an act that manual step of invoicing want to take your revenue you're always going to show the software before taxes right so right

Unknown Speaker  1:50:59
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:51:02
I mean subtotal plus I mean technically minus discounts but subtotal if you if you sold it for 5000 you had $500 for the discounts you would have income of 5500 and then expense or and then debit just the $500 discounts

Speaker 5  1:51:22
so yeah, on that on that sample invoice my numbers are wrong the sample invoice that I use my revenue is too low it should be I just went man it should be

Speaker 5  1:51:43
I should have been added the discounts back in war you're going to itemize each line and say is this part of the building is it not? And then discounts you want to add discounts in it you'll basically say well the stayin the base building his 5700 the overhangs total walls all of those are part of the building revenue include that and then you're going to get to things like leveling kit

Speaker 5  1:52:23
and saying well this is a are shipping you're gonna say well that goes to the shipping income leveling kit goes to the site prep revenue or whatever it's going to be and then there's those that miscellaneous those miscellaneous items that someone's going to have to itemize so yeah my my numbers are wrong but I think you're

Matthias Miller  1:53:04
yep, I think I mean I think it makes

Speaker 5  1:53:08
because the critical piece that we're not capturing right now is if if if you do it the way I did you're not exposing discounts or promos anywhere on the income statement. And you can have a month of really high sales and a bunch of discounts when you say we didn't make great or our margin suffered why and if you expose the people promos and the discounters contra revenue then you can see that the income statement

Unknown Speaker  1:53:50
speak to

Speaker 5  1:53:52
your clients track that diligently Do you have any clients that tracks that? Well

Unknown Speaker  1:53:58
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:54:01
there's some that do both ways.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:04
Maybe we're the only ones that do

Speaker 4  1:54:07
No, no, there's the religious depends how you know if they're just focused on is their cash in the account well, then they don't care whether it was you know, this kind of tender sign or not

Speaker 5  1:54:21
very good. Well, I think I've done too much in the talking here. I think if we're done with a flowchart to go ahead and explain why he what you have here what you're

Speaker 4  1:54:38
so that's basically just kind of what came to my mind as far as a functional page for for receiving payments on. So it'd be like a module or window. The top part would be populated based on what you're doing, of course, and a spot to attach document Obviously not there's a check scans or whatever it is, the next section on the search section would just give you the options of typing in there to sort your list and then the list of everything that is in well, it would just be a list of all sales orders or invoices, I did have, you know, just above in the search, add the checkbox to to show those sales orders if you want. So I think probably by default, that would be checked. You know, because you're gonna be somebody sends analyst have received payments, there's gonna be a deposit and there's gonna be deposit the customer deposits, there's gonna be payments, all kinds of things mixed together there. So I would say that should probably be checked by default. And then it would just list all of those, the first four columns there would be information that would already have based on the the invoice and then you just have to put in the check or ACH or credit card whatever it was method put in the deposit received. The payment date would default for the day of you could backdate it but you wouldn't be able to backdate it for an invoice beyond the invoice date. Because then that would you know that would that would mess up your watch account GL Account allocations it's going into and then we were thinking after I had this done we're just discussing it here today, we should probably have a remaining balance more of a forest safety net you know if it shows up you have a remaining balance of three cents or $2 or something then you might have just entered a typo or maybe they just didn't notice that the guy's check was actually $2 off or he forgot two cents or whatever. And then to write off the balance you would just be a checkbox open that little dialog for where you want that right off to go you know if you want to go anyone say well we just we're just gonna give them a discount of three cents to make up for this or or maybe it was bad debt because you know the guy has never gone to pay and then a memo field for each one so the idea was this kind of layout so that you can receive payments for multiple people all in one in one record I thought maybe there'd be faster than named open the guy's account make his pain you know, there's a lot of just opening and closing if you have that kind of force

Unknown Speaker  1:58:08
so makes sense?

Speaker 4  1:58:17
There might be programming things that need you know, more stuff that needs to be in the background.

Matthias Miller  1:58:24
Yeah, but make sense. I think I think what we'll do is we'll do a simplistic version that's pretty close to this and or yeah captures the essence of what you're after here and might not be exact but I think we can get something that's good. So then we will probably want to store the received payment reference number

Unknown Speaker  1:58:51
somewhere as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:40
We can use

Unknown Speaker  1:59:57
the

Matthias Miller  2:00:04
On the payments should we call that deposit date or should we call it

Unknown Speaker  2:00:09
received date

Speaker 4  2:00:12
that should probably be received date because depositing would happen when you move from undeposited funds to the checking account. So this would be that you received these payments now technically it's going to be the day you know when they send from the different offices send in the you know, the handwritten reports or whatever it's gonna be whatever date they put on there if it sat on their desk for two days we're not going to know the difference when it comes to entering so it'll be I guess the date of whatever report

Unknown Speaker  2:00:56
was sent down right

Matthias Miller  2:00:59
probably went to may one two slightly different workflows for receiving payments versus depositing

Unknown Speaker  2:01:10
Yeah, there will be there'll be a difference there

Matthias Miller  2:01:25
I will let me let me take a crack at it I think this is good good enough

Speaker 4  2:01:33
for for the actual depositing than to have a little bit of something different in mind where it would just list all of these payments that were received and then you just check down through this okay these are the ones being deposited

Unknown Speaker  2:01:51
right

Unknown Speaker  2:02:27
Jane Addams is an hour

Speaker 4  2:02:47
I can share my screen with you for that deposit field if you want

Unknown Speaker  2:03:00
to make sure you get Sure yeah

Unknown Speaker  2:03:10
okay

Speaker 4  2:03:13
so it's basically just the same list except probably the list of payments and then that you know the checkboxes

Speaker 4  2:03:24
this would all be pre populated of course because all this information comes from receive payments I gotta think there shouldn't be a line where you can just add in something else you know, say it's due to a bounced check or whatever some bank you know, on the bank side some of those kinds of things where it's not actually a payment from a customer and then totals at the top would just have deposit total but then would also total it out based on the payment method

Unknown Speaker  2:04:09
that's pretty much all on that

Matthias Miller  2:04:17
and presumably you want to support multiple deposits per day

Unknown Speaker  2:04:26
probably Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:52
Makes sense

Speaker 2  2:05:10
Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:05:17
Well, I guarantee you I'm gonna have

Unknown Speaker  2:05:19
some questions.

Matthias Miller  2:05:21
But this also clears up some stuff for sure.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:41
Good well

Unknown Speaker  2:05:52
I guess in light of that we will be talking

Matthias Miller  2:06:04
is there any chance we can move our call on Wednesday to 130? Eastern?

Unknown Speaker  2:06:15
Yeah. So Oh, instead of one

Unknown Speaker  2:06:18
instead of one. Yeah.

Speaker 5  2:06:22
And then you still want. We're still good for the 10 o'clock. Yep. Blockchain. Good. And then Monday, Labor Day, just drop that I'm sure. And then just play Wednesday.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:54
Good.

Speaker 5  2:06:58
Just for whatever towards God's sake, he's also going to have some new stuff for Drew to start testing. I think he's on the list of things to get started with. And then he wants to do a actually, I know Josh was looking to was well, as you might know, but he was hoping to do to do a walkthrough Wednesday with drew on where he's going with accounts payable, so you can start testing that with some of the changes, instead of doing the Delta transactions during the required changes. We thought it might be tight. I don't know. Have you talked with him about that? You know what that's

Matthias Miller  2:07:58
about the same amount of information as you do. He wasn't sure if he was going to make it in there would be able to do that.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:06
I don't have much

Matthias Miller  2:08:12
more than that.

Speaker 5  2:08:22
Let's play it by ear and see. Yeah, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of stuff ready for testing shortly. We have the accounts payable, and we have the asset management. And then we should also look at Do you know where to look for those transactions that the FDI allocation providers are showing us? Yes, I think so. Okay, I think we should also look at those.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:00
Yes, good.

Matthias Miller  2:09:01
That's gonna require some fixes for me before you

Unknown Speaker  2:09:03
can there's some significant about

Speaker 5  2:09:09
setting up vendors and bank accounts, those type of things. Is that something that you want to do a walkthrough first, and we can just figure it out on our own.

Matthias Miller  2:09:26
I think you should probably check in with Josh to find out how he was planning to do that. I don't feel like I mean, I don't really know the latest on that. Okay. Okay. Good. Hopefully there's

Unknown Speaker  2:09:42
a way that

Unknown Speaker  2:09:43
upload or

Unknown Speaker  2:09:46
especially venues, new information.

Matthias Miller  2:09:49
Well, I wonder too, if we just want to take the current vendor list and see which, I mean, if we can just push the current vendors across to I think we're just gonna push it Across the contact records.

Speaker 2  2:10:03
So we can just take the existing vendors in the database and push him push him over his contact records.

Speaker 5  2:10:11
Are we going to, for vendors be doing the same type of dance between having them in IMS and accounting for a period of time that we are with GL accounts?

Unknown Speaker  2:10:22
Yes, I think so. And there's

Matthias Miller  2:10:29
this probably bears repeating, and this probably could be worth having it be an agenda item, or Friday, is that we are building up technical debt? And yes, we know we're doing it. And no, we don't like to go back. Nobody likes to say what's new and exciting? Well, we're cleaning up all the cheats and shortcuts that we used earlier. So it's emotionally painful to do that. But that's the only way we're gonna hit. I mean, it's the option between 2024 accounting or 2025 accounting, so be prepared. I think just

Speaker 5  2:11:15
explaining that Friday would be helpful. Just I mean, give us a scope or or an idea of the scope of what I think would be

Unknown Speaker  2:11:27
good. Yeah.

Speaker 5  2:11:33
Because I could see as getting them January 1 2024, and then say, Okay, we're ready to start building a 3d Configurator or something like that. That's it counted, it's not done right. Well,

Matthias Miller  2:11:55
this is this is absolute human nature. If you want to have a product or project if you want to have a product that sells like hotcakes, and a product that people get all really excited about most times if you put 3d configured configurator side by side with accounting it's gonna be pretty clear which one wins? So except for a subset of people who who are wired to like numbers and all these things but

Unknown Speaker  2:12:26
yeah, yeah okay good good

Unknown Speaker  2:12:40
all right. Well

Unknown Speaker  2:12:43
can enjoy us get the day off on Labor Day my classroom

Matthias Miller  2:12:55
at least part of the day off it's it's I'm not quite sure if I'm taking the full day off

Unknown Speaker  2:12:58
but I

Matthias Miller  2:13:02
don't know always how to juggle what's the right juggling act? I suppose the correct answer is if you take the full day off everything everything that you everything's gonna be waiting for you when you come back. It's not going anywhere. So

Unknown Speaker  2:13:26
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:28
Really take off

Unknown Speaker  2:13:38
yeah.

Matthias Miller  2:13:41
Good. Well, a good weekend to you, you all as well.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:44
Yeah. Thanks. Bye.
