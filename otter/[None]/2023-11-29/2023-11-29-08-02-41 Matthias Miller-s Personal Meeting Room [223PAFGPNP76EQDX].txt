Unknown Speaker  01:14
Bring us

Speaker 1  01:59
This is Mark Mark with us but I just call the week let's get started Drew's working with someone at Arrow trying to get the first checks printed so that while they work on that we can possibly cover a few of the lesser items on the list here that are not don't involve

Speaker 1  02:44
I'm assuming you want to go through the through the project management checklist once Drew is on but so my thought was if you're good with that we could do we could cover 3435 and six because I don't think those updates there and then

Matthias Miller  03:13
so 338 I've done my part and that went live Yeah. Monday

Speaker 1  03:23
and what did Josh say this morning? I think he said that's also five

Speaker 1  03:40
II Okay. FTI report looking perfectly from what we can tell, making a few slight changes to the AR report. Taking that live early Friday morning. So

Speaker 1  04:08
aside from that outstanding exhaustion you needs to do an AR It will take live Friday morning, I believe that we can consider three to be done unless you know something that that we still need to do. Yeah, I'm

Unknown Speaker  04:25
not aware of anything that we need to do first No, we're done.

Speaker 1  04:30
And then five and six any updates on I know that those were quite low on the priority list. So

Matthias Miller  04:37
no updates on this still still low priority looks

Speaker 1  04:43
good so well Drew's on now so I'd say let's bang if we could do a cover.

Matthias Miller  04:53
Module is not available until 1030. So I would vote just to keep keep going with what you got here and then we can switch over. Whenever we're done with that, we can let go.

Speaker 1  05:07
So we got three, five and six, actually seven done. So we have one, two and four remaining. So go ahead and sign over here.

Speaker 2  05:18
Sorry, I got a phone call one minute before on the reconcile module, you've been working on increasing the speed on that, you know, when that's happening

Matthias Miller  05:34
it's been working it's pretty generous

Speaker 3  05:46
is the best way to do this the best way for us to get this done is with a

Unknown Speaker  05:59
model,

Unknown Speaker  06:01
a catalog save while the

Unknown Speaker  06:05
report subset in that case

Unknown Speaker  06:17
to me, the big challenge

Unknown Speaker  06:27
we're looking for

Matthias Miller  06:35
is this this is something we're wanting long term, is that right? Or is this just a

Speaker 2  06:40
no, well, we are wanting it long, I mean the thing where we compile those payments where they were, it was multiple invoices to the same vendor, those payments, right? Bringing that number together that should be something that's only for now because with the newer updates, those are now being listed together as one payment

Unknown Speaker  07:14
right so

Speaker 2  07:17
so that part of it is only a short term you know if that's our whole speed issue that maybe we didn't figure out if we're just need to go away with that and figure out some other way to do it or or just deal with it for this current reconciling and

Unknown Speaker  07:41
thank you if we would

Unknown Speaker  07:58
refund

Speaker 4  08:00
a lot of lesions because we have so many transactions you expect

Unknown Speaker  08:08
and that backlog put it out

Speaker 2  08:11
now what's making it slow is that is the task and does that ties you know like so certainly, the vendor has a whole bunch of invoices and they're all paying for one check and it's pulling all the separate invoices over and so the reconcile module system is is going back through records and tying all of those together giving us a total for all this pain

Speaker 4  08:38
of one's looking out because right we shouldn't allow that.

Matthias Miller  08:45
So so this the solution to make it fast is to temporarily store the payment ID on the transaction so that we can index off of vendor and

Matthias Miller  09:09
then payment i d think something like that. And then we'll just remove temporary field and everything that goes with it once you know next year whenever we're done with it okay, so let me let me do this is really gonna throw this under AP cash payment ID temporarily for reconcile

Speaker 5  10:22
How often would that update and like, when is going in the day paying a bunch of invoices? You know, the same thing is going to happen with that then tonight, say, Oh, I see you paid all you paid these five invoices with this chain and temporarily store that.

Unknown Speaker  10:41
Yeah, yeah, we would.

Matthias Miller  10:44
Yeah, we would do that on a nightly basis.

Speaker 5  10:46
Okay, so any changes? Well, you shouldn't have historical changes going back but if there were historical changes if she I don't know, for some reason went back and said no, no, no, I did not pay these five invoices with this check. I paid only pay fees for whatever that update would be reflected updates that she made. Makes with those. If changes are well, we will changes be made to historical data that do we even have to worry about that? Like we stopped but on one time when we see it the first time and then we forget about it? Is that Is that how you're planning to handle it?

Matthias Miller  11:34
Oh, it'd be pretty true. It's it's pretty trivial to always update it to whatever it should be. You'd update

Speaker 5  11:42
it every night. So any changes that any changes made would never be more than 24 hours

Unknown Speaker  11:51
or hours all right

Speaker 2  12:01
I mean, it's it's one of those things I can work with it but after a little while, it kind of makes me feel like I'm just wasting my time. Yeah, that's not like a doesn't doesn't work what I do is I just open a couple more windows and just never use the links and just never on that page I never go away from it. Right. But eventually I need to you know, save the changes or that kind of thing and so just it's probably several minutes waiting.

Matthias Miller  12:30
Yeah, and then being able to see what what uh what you what you did and the impact how it ties out. Right well I mean if every if you just get everything right the first time I was scrubbing right

Speaker 2  12:52
normally I go into reconcile and that's what I do I'm there until it's all reconciled then we're done but impossible do that these are messed up okay, I am still like we went over the thing of not not reconciling and how I have to save and first and then go record and reconcile and all that and it is still not going for that tsp primary account for AC I've done it where I just I hit the Save and go for lunch you know or do something and it's still there still all showing up as cleared but like to have the cleared status but they just don't they don't go away as being referenced

Matthias Miller  13:40
is that something we can see? Is it something that we could pull it right now and take a look at Yeah, go for it

Speaker 2  13:51
for smaller accounts that they have gone away I've done the reconcile and been done so I don't know timeout thing we're just simply doesn't happen fast enough and so then it just

Unknown Speaker  14:03
just works here.

Unknown Speaker  14:04
So which which account is this

Speaker 2  14:07
ABC and then primary checking downs almost

Unknown Speaker  14:20
all right. Well, first things first is going to be

Unknown Speaker  14:26
well

Unknown Speaker  14:33
well, let's actually it looks

Unknown Speaker  14:36
like it has done for you.

Matthias Miller  14:42
Is this is this what it supposed to look like?

Speaker 2  14:45
Now there's supposed to be a whole bunch of yeses in declared box.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
And it wasn't go back to May.

Speaker 2  14:54
But maybe evidently it has run at some point. I tried it several times. was the last time being on Tuesday or Wednesday, I think.

Matthias Miller  15:10
Okay, so you what was the last statement that you reconciled? statement date?

Speaker 2  15:17
On that was September 30, for 38 or 29. Maybe I forget what state it as I think may have as dated as 29.

Matthias Miller  15:27
Okay, so, okay, so it stands to reason there were about 50 transactions that didn't

Speaker 2  15:35
clear is that, yeah, there were numerous that were not cleared. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  15:42
So it does like somehow, eventually it did.

Speaker 2  15:53
I'm gonna pull it up here on my end and just see if, you know, it's kind of like I dealt with, with teaching school, students would work and work and not get anywhere. And as soon as they'd asked me to come check it out, and poof, it be all is all work. So are they taking your car to the mechanic or like anything like that? Yeah. All you gotta do is just say, hey, it's not working. And then suddenly, it does makes you look like

Speaker 2  16:26
Well, mine is currently working on loading so we can go on how the rest of the meeting and then come back. You sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  16:37
That update on one event log for reconcile.

Unknown Speaker  16:40
Yeah. How's that coming?

Matthias Miller  16:42
Plenty to Joe's out two days this week? Let me see. We're gonna guess end of next, next week is when that's going to be showing

Unknown Speaker  16:56
up. But if if we need some heroics to make it happen, we? We can? Yeah.

Speaker 2  17:09
Well, I don't know that the heroics on that are much higher priority than the heroics on the on the speed thing. I mean, it's, most of these things, are these two while and the end, the check stuff, is just anything that happens will help the whole system out. So, right. So it's not like they all need done yet every step of the way is going to be better, except for a signature. That's not super crucial.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
So Matthias,

Speaker 5  17:42
on that speed? When do you expect to have that change done?

Unknown Speaker  17:48
Well, it depends on the need to be focusing on.

Unknown Speaker  17:54
So shall we go through this list and then circle back?

Matthias Miller  17:59
Maybe when when Audra comes on? We can we can take a look at broad context of where things are at.

Matthias Miller  18:12
As far as Cheque Printing, should we, okay, so for checks, what's the appropriate thing? Should we keep the memo field, but have a separate reference field? That is, or or just not put the memo on the on the main sack, but show to the secondary? What's best?

Speaker 2  18:40
Well, so what happened is, I had a vendor that I was going to print a check for. And there were like 16 invoices or so? Well, and they were all along invoice numbers. And so it created this huge list, which then just expanded the memo field, which pushed all the stubs way down. And it would have been, I don't know if they would even all fit on the on the check part.

Unknown Speaker  19:03
Right?

Unknown Speaker  19:04
So

Speaker 2  19:08
could with a reference field for the check stub, be something that would work like instead of doing the duplication of the check, just do a reference field? It'd be nice if we could have the check. Amount, like the invoice amount associated with its reference now.

Matthias Miller  19:26
What if what if we just instead of actually replicating the check, let's just create a separate step. That's got all the information payee? payee date, amount? We don't need the amount in words. Write the memo from the check and then the reference number and then we put the account number. Well, yeah. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah,

Speaker 2  19:53
I think that would work great. It really could be the same information as on that text too. Rent page. You know, unless, unless the vendor, and then and the total amount for the check. And then below it, it lists the invoices, invoice numbers and the the amount for each. So like he really could just pull that information and that could be the tech stuff. Now if there is a memo, maybe that could go in line with the vendors name or something, I don't know, some or maybe it can just go at the bottom of the stub because we had, I think you also have currently have the memo set to be an account number with that vendor if there is one. Right. So I think if we keep that, and that's a good idea, keep that. And then that account number would then also show up in the memo on that stub if we keep that memo field on the stub yep

Unknown Speaker  21:04
I like that.

Unknown Speaker  21:06
See?

Speaker 2  21:11
The awkward for me now at some point that cleared? Yep. I just just got downloaded.

Matthias Miller  21:17
Okay, well, if if at any point, you know, screenshots blow out your phone, camera, whatever.

Speaker 2  21:24
Well, there's nothing to screenshot, there's just nothing happens. Nothing

Speaker 3  21:28
happens. Like it just doesn't really well, it

Speaker 2  21:31
gives the blank. You know, like the records that when you hit the reconcile, then it it pulls up this this window. But it's it says nothing.

Unknown Speaker  21:43
So that's obnoxious.

Speaker 2  21:47
Is there just I figure it just took so long and alone. Anyone's taken care of for

Matthias Miller  21:59
at least exactly what you said. Alright, we can do that. I like that. That'll make things easier. There's a pretty good chance that changing the signature, I'm going to need to reshuffle the layout a bit, the signature. So,

Unknown Speaker  22:23
sorry,

Matthias Miller  22:24
let me adjust some of the numbers again. Okay. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  22:33
think

Speaker 2  22:36
I don't think it was a huge issue once they started moving. So and it shouldn't really be. Yeah, I think it's work. I don't think it should be a big issue to me.

Matthias Miller  22:51
I mean, it won't be by much but I've got some I've found some mistakes and in positioning and if I'm going to change the signature of the signature works and change the layout. I think I'm gonna go ahead and it's going to be fractional inch shifts, probably but I think we might as well go, go get it. If we can get it slid a little more precise. We might as well do that. Would

Unknown Speaker  23:13
Should we keep the Malmo Brom What do you call it?

Unknown Speaker  23:21
Well, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:22
we're aligned.

Matthias Miller  23:24
I think my thought is, we have some limitations. I get to do a little bit of BNC stuff, but basically what I would do is figure out the maximum number of letters that we can show and then if it's longer than that yank off, however much you need to insert an ellipsis at the end.

Speaker 4  23:45
Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 2  23:50
we shouldn't need to I mean, normally there's there's a considerable amount of tax that can go in there and normally, it shouldn't be an issue if we're not trying to show invoice numbers there. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea

Unknown Speaker  24:11
all right. So then

Matthias Miller  24:26
the status changing on invoice from check is deleted

Speaker 2  24:36
so that here's the case that Jack that had all those invoices, and I said, Okay, that's not gonna work to print that. I deleted it. And then all those invoices still said paid and unprinted check for the ID. So I need I needed to make so that Whitney could pay Hey, those today. So I just went in and changed all that back to unpaid. Now, in normal life circumstances, if if I know that they will correct themselves tonight, then it's not a big deal, you know, next time, they'll show up again and and you know, they'll get paid. Now if they're not going to update at any point, then then I just need to know that so I can go back and change the

Unknown Speaker  25:30
current currently

Matthias Miller  25:43
currently, if you would if you would go in the in the aisle, but you don't have a way to pull those up. Now, if you would go to you go to checks to print and highlight them and remove them from there, then it would, they would mark it as not.

Speaker 2  26:07
Yeah, so. So I had another one that I did that. But that first one I had to actually say, to print this check, so that I could see what it looked like. So then I had to delete that. The second company that had a whole big long list, I just I did the pay by cheque, and then I highlighted them and said removed from cheque. And those went back to unpaid as they should be. But the one that I actually had to create the cheque as though I was ready to print it

Unknown Speaker  26:51
said it was paid.

Speaker 2  26:55
White and that one would have showed up on the checks to print. The first plus the one that I removed them from the check, there was a zero check showed up in checks to print them. Because I removed all the invoices from it still actually like there was a check there. But it said zero and there was no invoices. And all those invoices went back to unpaid status. So then I just deleted that zero check. Right?

Matthias Miller  27:24
So currently, okay. So what you would need to do, if you wanted to print it, then you would have had to delete the check number go into checks to print. Remove. Remove, remove those vendor invoices, and it would automatically do that. And then you can delete the check.

Speaker 2  27:50
We remove everything. Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  27:57
So we could

Unknown Speaker  28:03
let me let me

Speaker 3  28:05
see, I can't remember how this works for sure. Move from check.

Matthias Miller  28:30
Yeah, and I mean, the other thing that we could consider is

Matthias Miller  28:42
do we need to have something on the check so that I'm a little worried about? I don't know, Josh says it's a training issue. Probably cares less about it, I think we can just like, go do it and fix it when there's problems. I worry probably a little bit more about people changing linking and things like that, and sort of trying to make changes and not realizing the impact of it.

Speaker 2  29:11
I mean, under normal conditions, the checks should just be voided. You know, let's say there's something where you send somebody a check and it gets lost in the mail or they lose it or something and they want another payment. You have to make all those vendors invoices available pay again. Right. So, you know, you shouldn't be able to avoid it. Just void the check and then anything tied to it should go back to unpaid status. Probably a warning that you're that you're making that happen but for these purposes, you know, it's like I don't I only want that thing to exist as

Speaker 4  29:53
a boy. So right I thought I had this

Matthias Miller  30:05
I had this in my email the whole wedding process is kind of amazing it's on my radar as well I would

Matthias Miller  30:16
mean when voiding a check it would be ideal

Matthias Miller  30:25
is it okay when you want to check if the if the check amount drops to if we require you to take the vendor invoices off you'd have an activity history in the amount drops to zero

Speaker 2  30:40
so you're wanting to Oh, like if you would take those vendor invoices off and remove them from the check it would automatically go to void status like to check with before

Matthias Miller  31:00
Yeah, if it has a check number it would work

Matthias Miller  31:13
for or, or or you just don't allow avoiding it until there are no vendor invoices associated with it. And we've give you a way to

Matthias Miller  31:30
you know, basically we give you a way to if you want to go to check you we'll give you a way to pull up the

Unknown Speaker  31:48
noxious because of

Matthias Miller  31:52
well, let's figure out how we want to work and then we can go from there. For the mourning process, we could just have a void button on the check. I think ideally it would, they would mark the vendor invoices as unpaid clear out the payment ID on the vendor invoice, delete the vendor invoice rows from the check, which is going to change the check amount well and then if you do that, I'm adding a miscellaneous line items to the check as well. Do we want to go ahead and blank that out at the same time so check them out drops to zero

Speaker 2  32:33
well if you avoided it would be all or none Yeah, like so every you know whether there's miscellaneous items or whether there's invoices whatever there is, everything on it should shouldn't go back as unpaid

Unknown Speaker  32:56
like, like you

Speaker 2  33:00
somehow you should not be able to avoid on the certain invoice right

Unknown Speaker  33:07
No, that's that's fair

Matthias Miller  33:15
avoiding only makes sense if you check Well,

Speaker 2  33:23
pretty much it would just retain a record of that check number is really all you're saving by just saying here's this check number oh yeah, it got

Unknown Speaker  33:35
right here we still retain PE E and date

Unknown Speaker  33:40
yeah

Unknown Speaker  33:40
yeah

Matthias Miller  33:41
and such but yeah, okay amount basically we lose it okay. I think that's I think it's fair I think we just created a separate waiting process

Unknown Speaker  33:56
now we just ran into let me pull it up here see if I can

Unknown Speaker  34:07
under checks to friend

Unknown Speaker  34:20
Oh,

Speaker 2  34:22
so like we go to ABC checks to print. Then there is one for rollforming designer metal. Now, there is no Print link there. If you go to the View

Unknown Speaker  34:46
Yes, you're right.

Speaker 2  34:47
But there is on the object search

Unknown Speaker  35:00
The reason is that the

Matthias Miller  35:09
Okay, the reason is because of the process required to assign check numbers so,

Speaker 2  35:20
what he did and I haven't heard back is it's working is we went to the CSS checks or the guy and right above it, check search or whatever it's called. And then they're clicked on the unprinted link No, that wasn't it oh

Matthias Miller  35:52
okay, for an existing check for one that has been printed you can just hit print check on the other detail screen for underneath checks, you would have to go to checks to print and print from use the print selected checks.

Speaker 2  36:11
Yes, Brian selected checks and then it brought up that's yeah, and then it brought up this this thing that says something about the already being a record, do you want to recreate it or something? Then he went through that. I mean, it's it's saying now that it's printed and he has a check number on it.

Unknown Speaker  36:36
Of check number one.

Speaker 2  36:40
But he hasn't let me know that he's gotten it done. So he must be in the process. So then, what makes them sit there as unprinted? What did I do?

Unknown Speaker  36:55
So like them if I hit pay by cheque if I'm in the

Speaker 2  37:03
vendor invoices needing payment and I had to pay by cheque that would not create the tech that would just put them in the list right? Correct.

Matthias Miller  37:14
Well, I mean, yeah, they would it creates a check record with no check number.

Speaker 4  37:21
Okay. So then when they come into text to print

Speaker 2  37:33
or they're already acting as a creative check with an unprinted number like there's word or did I hit run selected checks maybe on this vendors me the invoice

Matthias Miller  37:53
Can you either explain or So what went sideways here?

Unknown Speaker  38:00
Just share my screen

Unknown Speaker  38:02
Yeah, maybe go for it

Speaker 2  38:12
Okay, so So here's vendors invoices needing payment and I have these because those would have been out of you know, hit the pay by cheque to create that now if I go to grant Yeah. So I have these and I should be able to just highlight this and print selected checks, right? Correct. But if I

Unknown Speaker  39:01
check search

Unknown Speaker  39:09
here are those two checks or

Unknown Speaker  39:13
so in that in that last screen,

Unknown Speaker  39:21
which I'm not sure if I wanted to do it

Unknown Speaker  39:30
if I hit this, maybe I just should

Unknown Speaker  39:38
Okay, probably

Speaker 2  39:39
mess up is or not but because I don't have the number and it has something about being created already. There being a record there already. I think it's because of these ones in this

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Next search

Unknown Speaker  40:02
sitting here with unprinted values.

Matthias Miller  40:04
Let me let me check something was that just on the on the final page?

Unknown Speaker  40:13
Yes, I think so.

Matthias Miller  40:16
So I think and I think it's very likely just a confusing message. Okay, basically the check exists we are assigning a number and it's telling you what changes it made.

Unknown Speaker  40:35
And

Matthias Miller  40:37
and yeah, it modified one existing record because we had to send a check number to it, but that's all

Unknown Speaker  40:42
right.

Speaker 2  40:46
So so if you if you made it say something like that's records modified to add this check numbers or something. Yeah, cuz it sounded like you're gonna duplicate the check.

Unknown Speaker  41:04
Yeah, I mean, ideally,

Unknown Speaker  41:09
are those warnings

Matthias Miller  41:11
until I mean, ultimately, yes. And ultimately you're telling him how to identify whether it actually is a warning or not, or whether it's just a notification let me pull it up in my test system and just see exactly what the what the message is

Unknown Speaker  41:41
to

Unknown Speaker  41:45
Tigger for a little bit here see we print these

Unknown Speaker  42:09
that's weird so why

Matthias Miller  42:25
let me try something else vendor Let me try one with multiple vendor invoices tied to it see if that makes any difference

Unknown Speaker  43:01
Hello two rows

Unknown Speaker  43:28
well

Unknown Speaker  43:36
boxes yeah

Matthias Miller  43:40
one more thing Yeah, let's do multiple pay multiple checks with each one with multiple vendor invoices and see if we can duplicate it that way.

Speaker 6  43:50
It was

Unknown Speaker  44:01
is probably

Speaker 5  44:04
the best don't change because number one it used to be here are some big dogs. These are saying out loud. Our next guest is not convenient change the number all this change

Unknown Speaker  44:27
yeah, he gets on sharpish too.

Unknown Speaker  44:34
Alright, so we're gonna do that.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
And we're gonna come here

Unknown Speaker  44:50
just

Speaker 3  45:07
Okay what happens if I go back doesn't okay what happens if I do this

Unknown Speaker  45:36
Sherwin Williams in the end

Unknown Speaker  45:53
we're going to refresh this one will refresh this one

Unknown Speaker  46:09
do print here

Unknown Speaker  46:25
we're gonna come back and we're gonna hit it again

Unknown Speaker  46:39
I

Speaker 2  46:41
oh I guess if he sees it again I'll have him just take a screenshot of it and send it over if not gonna take care of itself too

Unknown Speaker  46:52
yeah exactly

Unknown Speaker  46:57
that should be on that

Unknown Speaker  47:26
right so the invoice date let's see

Unknown Speaker  48:07
right so think

Unknown Speaker  48:12
yep see if Audrey can hop on as well?

Unknown Speaker  49:38
To see status resolution though no manual change yes

Speaker 4  49:49
you want to add or remove them from the check first to automatically change them and then delete to check or avoid getting a void option for the All

Unknown Speaker  50:07
right

Speaker 3  50:27
all right. We start by going over Mark's email and updates and.

Speaker 4  50:52
So on

Unknown Speaker  51:15
All right, so

Unknown Speaker  51:19
I'm calling from Joel

Matthias Miller  51:26
don't have an ETA. Okay. Joe was looking at balance sheet grouping was done by end of next week pending pro Regis. And then we said, we want the reconcile event log. And so I communicated that to him. I don't have an updated having any update on that. I'm assuming we are targeting ballpark the same.

Matthias Miller  52:01
And have ended next week. But and we talked through a little bit about what would be required in ways to multi multistage it. So that we could at least just get the same updates tied out.

Speaker 5  52:17
With us, why did you said just before this, that thing is done or scheduled to be done and job?

Matthias Miller  52:25
Okay, so income statement is done balance sheet groupings he was going to have done by end of next week, he's out for two years this week. But in light of the statement date, you know, wanting to prioritize them and date first. I'm, I'm assuming it's approximately the same amount of work, but I don't know for sure.

Unknown Speaker  52:45
So

Matthias Miller  52:49
I don't know, ballpark targets end of next week for the statement dates, but don't know. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  52:57
And then cash flow is still in development. Correct.

Matthias Miller  52:59
And that's I think been sitting under you might know better than I do about 80% done, I think.

Speaker 7  53:07
Yeah, that seems to be where we're at. I haven't. And that's been sitting there for a little bit at 80%.

Matthias Miller  53:14
Yeah. And that's been pushed to the backburner. So, I think you know, a lot of the a lot of the cashflow stuff is made, it's just a matter of I think a lot of the underlying pieces are, are done. It's just a matter of pulling together the report and displaying and it's my understanding.

Speaker 5  53:33
Okay, so from Joe, we have first up is the reconciliation event log, and then better groupings and balance sheet and then cash flow statement. Yes, then that, okay.

Matthias Miller  53:58
And then GL accounts and federal budget revisions just kind of been left left this hanging so I think it kind of depends. When drew lets up on finding problems

Unknown Speaker  54:16
Yeah. i

Matthias Miller  54:21
eta, I don't know. I mean, it could be it could be in the next week. Or it could be later than that. I don't know.

Speaker 4  54:35
Which ended like next week on those on the payroll module

Unknown Speaker  54:40
stuff. Oh, oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  54:55
You want to prioritize The pieces in one and two we talked about doing that after we at some point in the meeting

Matthias Miller  55:15
correct well let's let's go through these updates and then Andrea can start sharing labor intensive building adjustment. We'd have that written up

Matthias Miller  55:30
yeah so I think I think Audrey let's go through maybe let's just go through the list and see

Matthias Miller  56:00
we maybe break this down by

Speaker 7  56:04
There we go. Sorry. Yes, I think I was I think I was muted so I thought I would try something a little different this week. I just I want to make sure I got everything incoming. So I created an incoming report and then show where we've moved some 30 some things into different stages to make sure that I've captured that forward movement as well. So just quickly, I wanted to review it looks to me like the Cheque Printing task has gone back into the development stage with Matthias is that correct? Okay, the core accounting improve reconcile process I moved it into testing and gave it to mark is that where it is now?

Matthias Miller  56:49
Oh, whereas it's true. It's true there's one other reconcile so well hang on improve that I put this in to improve reconcile process

Speaker 7  57:08
I continue to have a terminology problem just I don't want to be I might be duplicating a couple things because I'm not entirely sure so part of this is clarity on that

Matthias Miller  57:21
okay, here's the problem. We need a new change request for core accounting track statements by track reconcile reconciliation by statement start by storing service knowing statement date eventually we want to store all statement information date you begins ending balance

Speaker 4  58:05
deposits withdrawals

Matthias Miller  58:13
This is saying jaw so in the reconcile let's see I think as far as the I think what I like to do

Speaker 4  58:33
is okay

Matthias Miller  58:51
yeah, there were a few things that didn't make it in here. Let me let me shoot a few things over and you can just add maybe add new tasks or let's Okay, let's let's keep the reconcile is being is basically being done or in and let's let's break out other other changes in the separate tasks so we can track those better. Okay,

Speaker 7  59:23
so we want to complete this and and break it out. Is that correct? Yeah, I think

Unknown Speaker  59:28
so. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  59:33
And then the other one

Matthias Miller  59:42
those are two that need to be added.

Unknown Speaker  59:46
Oh, what you're sending me right now. Okay, so

Speaker 3  59:49
are you ready now? Gotcha. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  59:59
Bye statement. Okay. And

Matthias Miller  1:00:10
my check printing changes, I'm just rolling into check printing

Unknown Speaker  1:00:17
or signature file.

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
signature file. Okay, no. Okay. There's there were additional changes required under check printing. So that's that's correct in development better sections on income statement that is in testing. Mark your true mark. I don't know who wants to sign off on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
Mark? That yeah, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
Okay. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
Custom warning for transactions. Oh, that one's actually still. No, he said, he said this was this one. We said it was done.

Speaker 7  1:00:53
Let me see. Joel says implemented I've reviewed asked for some cleanup changes, but it's functional functionality is ready is look, Joe's last comment. So I moved it into well, I moved it into adoption deployment, but maybe it should be in testing.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
There's any harm in

Matthias Miller  1:01:19
Drew, if you go into the chart of accounts into an account, there's a warning on manual entry field that you can input, if you want to.

Speaker 7  1:01:37
So I would just be waiting on Drew then at this point to say, Okay, this is good to go. Or should we close it out? Idle?

Speaker 2  1:01:48
This would be if you're trying to make a sub account with something in the account? No,

Matthias Miller  1:01:56
this is a great example for this would be your asset account. And you could have a warning saying you should not be automatically created, you should not be manually created well. You know, manually creating transactions for an asset account. may well I don't know what maybe that's not the right thing accounts payable. You know, please go please use the vendor invoice module to make payments don't just make them with accounts payable or I don't know Mark, maybe you've got better ideas of what you were thinking originally.

Speaker 2  1:02:32
This would be if I would just go to make a transaction and use that. Okay.

Speaker 5  1:02:42
Good, good job, add conditional warnings to various areas is what we're seeing. They're not conditional, or they're there. Okay. Like I think someone would possibly be that because the assets are going to appreciate themselves like assuming like manually entering a depreciation amount should say hey, or whatever. Okay, so we're just we're testing to see if we get that we'll get a warning and

Matthias Miller  1:03:19
yeah, testing that and getting it set up on whichever accounts you want. One

Speaker 5  1:03:22
Oh, okay. So Drew has the ability to to set up that warning on

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
Oh, it's not already going?

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
No, it's I mean you can you need to modify the account whichever account you want the morning million you have to open the account and add the warning to it but it should be working.

Speaker 2  1:03:41
Got it now I'm now I'm catching on. I thought I was waiting for a warning. Like if I do something. Where do we what are these sort of accounts

Matthias Miller  1:03:55
you're just drilling the bottom of the top section there

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
let's go to Accounts Payable account

Speaker 2  1:04:38
Oh, warning on manual entry got it. Yep. And now I can write in whenever I want.

Speaker 5  1:04:44
Yep. Those are always fun. You can make catching stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
Yeah, exactly. You can do it. No caps you can.

Speaker 2  1:04:57
Okay, yeah. And Use would show up if somebody just goes and says Create new transaction and then goes to save that is when this will pop up

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16
can we close it? Do you want to play around with it for a bit?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
I maybe should go create one and try. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:25
sounds like playing

Speaker 7  1:05:33
Okay, add a signature file that will be added to each check for printing. I had moved that into testing should it be there?

Matthias Miller  1:05:43
Let's see. Um, that is done some revisions to signature that's that'll happen under the check printing.

Speaker 7  1:05:54
Okay, so we're going to complete this all right. Okay, well let's see how useful or not useful it was to do this because I want to jump into the team here and

Unknown Speaker  1:06:07
there's more incoming ones underneath it aren't there

Speaker 7  1:06:09
Oh there are Yeah, there are more incoming ones but all these are going to show up under your respective team so we can I don't want to be doing a lot of double I really kind of wanted to make sure that I had captured the stage changes correctly this week.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:25
I think it is I think what

Unknown Speaker  1:06:31
we learned about something else or

Unknown Speaker  1:06:34
I mean I don't know do we bring it up now?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
I mean, we can do right now.

Speaker 5  1:06:40
Let's go through this list and then we can Yeah, covered at the end

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
Okay, sounds good. Well, let me jump into the team then

Unknown Speaker  1:06:57
look at the top ones for Matthias here they come on all right.

Speaker 7  1:07:08
Maybe they're coming up. What did we just do with check printing? Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
Check printing has revisions believe it to for update the due date to tomorrow? Okay. Well actually it gets pending pending priority. We got to talk about prioritization. Okay, sure.

Speaker 7  1:07:33
Yeah, right now it is we've tagged it urgent work orders owners mounts owner mountain. So no,

Matthias Miller  1:07:42
no change. I would Can we just pump out the due date to mid January and still try to get it done as soon as we can but be realistic about the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:06
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:08
Anything this

Unknown Speaker  1:08:14
yellow meeting? Good

Speaker 7  1:08:21
get on that. Okay. Conditional Formatting unpaid vacation

Matthias Miller  1:08:26
that would be the same same way

Unknown Speaker  1:08:29
mid January and try to get it done soon.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32
Don't show you that soon.

Speaker 7  1:08:42
All right, reconcile module requests this would be this email and I'm this might be a double entry somewhere now it's

Matthias Miller  1:08:54
the same as improved reconcile module. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
And that seems fair

Matthias Miller  1:09:04
testing question from Dwayne on straight transactions was answered and can be closed okay

Unknown Speaker  1:09:20
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:09:23
add default GL accounts to standard employees report

Matthias Miller  1:09:27
that's also the mid January target

Unknown Speaker  1:09:40
is

Speaker 7  1:09:43
core accounting Warren if adding child's account

Matthias Miller  1:09:48
duplicate that's an that's a that was a jaw thing. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
Okay

Speaker 7  1:09:59
should I Give it to draw. I'm missing one for Joel.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
Oh, yeah, the senator Joel.

Speaker 7  1:10:05
So let me assign it to draw and then okay. But this

Matthias Miller  1:10:09
is also assigned to well, or it's technically under adoption, and so excited to Drew or secondarily to do Drew.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
Doom through

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
an agile to my team.

Speaker 7  1:10:34
Okay. FGI better handling on labor intensive buildings.

Matthias Miller  1:10:44
I wonder if the other ones we should have actually been able to talk to you about that. And you should just put in the subwoofer team.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:52
Well, we can do that, if we want to.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
Cool. All

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
right. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:11:03
So, let's make sure we got okay, but there were two that is still waiting on you to add in. Yeah, so basically, we've got check changes, reconcile improvements.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22
I'll add those real quick so we can prioritize

Matthias Miller  1:11:24
any work that I might need to do with jewel on

Matthias Miller  1:11:34
sorry, on any work I need to do, which overstatement stuff if he needs any of my help? I mean, I think those are I think that's basically it, there

Matthias Miller  1:11:50
okay. I'm gonna make a proposal. Market Drew, I'm gonna propose that drop the checks for now. And get the reconcile speed up done. Doesn't seem like a ton of work. And I think we should be able to get that legs. If Josh is willing to do that. We get that live tonight. And then, and then focus tomorrow on some of these check changes, reference numbers, the steps, sub layout,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
etc, they were talking about.

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
And then next week, if nothing else comes up, I could knock out the payroll, payroll changes.

Speaker 7  1:12:49
Okay, mommy capture that in my note offline, because it's not creating these very quickly for me

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
working through Does that sound good to you guys?

Speaker 5  1:12:59
Yeah, yeah, it was good to be just to make sure you're going to do the push an update live tonight. Speed up the reconcile that focusing on chat and branding changes tomorrow, right? Yes. And then nothing comes up work on payroll module stuff. Next week?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
Correct. Good.

Speaker 2  1:13:21
On the tech changes on the show my screen and show what the check looks like.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:25
If you're down here,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
I can stop Sure.

Speaker 2  1:13:45
Nelson is saying that this signature might be too small. For the check the for the bank to even use it. He had said 25 to 40%. And I'm afraid we would need more like you know, make it twice as big.

Matthias Miller  1:14:02
So here's what I'm planning to do. I'm planning to revamp the layout a little bit. Currently, if you can, currently you can't see. But this is basically a table. And there's a cell for there's a row for for the address a row for the memo and signature. And instead I'm going to have a row for put those into one row. And then use paragraph indentation to left indent for the for that. And so that'll give you that'll give you that whole open space for the signature however big you want it

Speaker 2  1:14:37
and then at that point, then you would adjust the width and that would change your size of your signature.

Matthias Miller  1:14:42
Yeah, the construction of the signature right now is is the height it's a single is never line height. Okay, so that's why it's it's scaled down so skinny.

Speaker 4  1:14:53
So such so narrow. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:15:00
So that seems to be working by tomorrow evening. Or tomorrow night.

Matthias Miller  1:15:09
Josh is gonna do was playing on a Friday morning update. So yeah, that Friday morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:15
Can we hold off on that dope by the morning?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:17
Yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  1:15:19
wait,

Matthias Miller  1:15:22
if it's better for me to work on check layout stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:25
Now.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:28
I don't mind. I don't have a problem in trying to get that in for tonight.

Speaker 2  1:15:34
But I think one of the things have to go out, we can just leave them as check. Yeah, that's it there and he could just bring them on. We haven't done. You know, sending them out on Friday is fine.

Speaker 5  1:15:46
I think let's leave does that the priority is like,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:51
Okay. Sounds good. Okay.

Speaker 5  1:15:57
Good. Anything else you need from us? I don't

Speaker 7  1:16:05
do Yeah. Do you want to do any updates for your tasks this week? I'll leave that up to you. I can go back through them real quick, or if not, if you feel like you're on top of things, and I'm good. I don't

Speaker 5  1:16:18
think there's unfortunately, there's been no status changes on my project. So I don't Yeah, I think they pretty much stay fair.

Speaker 7  1:16:33
think that's fair. I don't want to waste time if there's nothing to say. So.

Speaker 5  1:16:37
Well, unfortunately, there's some some slight changes, but nothing more reporting here. So hopefully.

Speaker 5  1:16:50
And then we're on for Friday at 10. Do we have is it nine? No. 930 or 10? o'clock was

Matthias Miller  1:17:01
930 We'll doing declined. But

Speaker 5  1:17:06
he may stay. He wasn't thinking about or he's going to be Friday. So he said, Oh, I didn't need any clients. So he he will join.

Matthias Miller  1:17:16
And then how much time should I allow for the three? Three o'clock? for June? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:24
You mean Friday? Friday? Yeah. Well, I think they're gonna want to wrap up and start hitting, I would say,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
half an hour.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
Three to 330 by three. I mean, I'm questioning whether we even need it. Yeah, let's leave it there in case we need it. It's either easier to cancel it let's let's plan for three to 330 And then how much time is we allowed in the morning? 90

Matthias Miller  1:17:55
minutes is what I've got now. If you think we need more time.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
No, I think that's fine. Okay. Good

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09
plan. Good. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Thanks.
