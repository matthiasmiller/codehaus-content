Unknown Speaker  02:16
morning this is Hey, good morning. How are you doing this morning? Not too bad. How are you? Good. Got that little bit of a bug kicked? Well

Matthias Miller  02:35
70% kick. So I'm not sure what this thing is, but we're gonna keep using a little bit of caffeine and healthy doses of sleep to get this thing completely

Unknown Speaker  02:54
Nick, nice. We should probably chat

Matthias Miller  03:00
about whether you need to be on these calls consistently or whether you can

Unknown Speaker  03:05
drop off. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:08
I was because I had it a little confusing

Unknown Speaker  03:14
if it's actually beneficial. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  03:23
Is there anything specific for me to be

Unknown Speaker  03:25
on for today? Um,

Matthias Miller  03:30
Tim is probably the one to know we could pull up the

Unknown Speaker  03:34
agenda Good morning. One more.

Matthias Miller  03:46
Question for you, Tim. Before we get too deep in there, could we take Nick off the calendar invite and just invite him in on an as needed basis?

Speaker 1  03:53
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  04:01
Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  04:02
And then do we have anything we need for him from him today?

Unknown Speaker  04:21
Don't think so.

Speaker 2  04:26
Doesn't look like it. It's mainly Simba stuff and we will learn stuff.

Unknown Speaker  04:31
Good tag stuff. Then go from there. Because we have time. So perfect. I shall drop Good to see your faces. Happy coding.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
Right, I'll go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  04:57
take him off. Following

Unknown Speaker  05:17
some following

Speaker 2  05:24
and then the one for Thursday I remember I'll just let him know that one or Thursday could be good to have him on because that's when we have Austin one

Unknown Speaker  05:32
and we're planning to discuss some of the things for change requests proposals but not could have been one for those yep cool

Unknown Speaker  06:00
all right. Matthias Are you back to normal are you still waiting through

Unknown Speaker  06:09
whatever hit you every weekend

Matthias Miller  06:13
is a 60 70% back to normal and it's all been between mobile caffeine today and hopefully staying getting my sleep the rest of the week I'm hoping I'll be I'll be good

Unknown Speaker  06:31
yeah gotcha All right

Unknown Speaker  06:47
okay,

Speaker 2  06:48
I'm starting off first something's not on our list here but the topic of emailing articles to leads that that contact us asking for them

Unknown Speaker  07:04
there was a lead from Friday Friday evening

Unknown Speaker  07:11
it was asking for the streamline business article

Unknown Speaker  07:16
had we

Speaker 2  07:18
been said he didn't remember anyone talking to him about about doing that? Was is Do you remember what we talked about been doing that we talked about Miss on doing that thing we talked about

Matthias Miller  07:30
my assistant new assistant doing that whenever that person comes on board but if Ben could handle that in the interim that's going to be the

Unknown Speaker  07:38
most I think it's going to be

Matthias Miller  07:44
Hey, Mr. Jones got enough stuff to to juggle that just having her field calls and send that stuff our way I think that's

Unknown Speaker  07:54
I would prefer that Sure. So you just need to find the wiki for that then

Speaker 1  08:06
and Yeah, and if Ben can take that in the interim

Unknown Speaker  08:30
so do we need one or do we have one I'm pretty sure we do have one it would have put together

Matthias Miller  08:45
there's a lead comes in by email

Speaker 3  08:48
right but that's not anything about articles.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
I can see

Unknown Speaker  08:54
search for streamline see if there's any

Unknown Speaker  08:59
pending article beneath

Unknown Speaker  09:12
here if you give me a screenshot I'll show you.

Unknown Speaker  09:38
Turn on screen sharing. I'm sorry. Missing

Matthias Miller  09:43
bandwidth some of those absolutely there you go.

Unknown Speaker  09:46
I don't know why he would be that doesn't really make logical sense but give your parents you got easy. Exactly. I still have something to blame. Alright so this is the one I see here

Speaker 1  10:12
it says anything crafters is software code house your talent but what's the year they were asking for the green line

Matthias Miller  10:27
yeah that was we ran a streamline and the busy beaver

Unknown Speaker  10:33
okay and is this actually code house No

Matthias Miller  10:44
Don't we have not run any articles lately

Unknown Speaker  10:47
we're gonna house okay so that was the

Unknown Speaker  11:02
that'd be that's the three steps

Unknown Speaker  11:09
or was it the

Unknown Speaker  11:21
geniunely add yeah three steps okay so then

Unknown Speaker  11:41
I'll just reply with this

Speaker 1  12:09
and basically would be just replying to the email No, this wasn't by the email but sending an email to that email address there and say the article you requested and they had said something about it has some other text but anyway I can look for that later

Unknown Speaker  12:50
yeah, I can look for that later and pass it on to YouTube

Unknown Speaker  13:00
Okay sounds good

Unknown Speaker  13:14
okay good then to our next stuff in the midst here this is 7435 tracking and we had a few questions for you Matthias.

Speaker 1  13:55
I knew that I think Ben and I would have a lot of fun working out in the same office. We have a lot of fun the workload

Unknown Speaker  14:13
that's great.

Matthias Miller  14:15
Well, since I can't persuade you to move to Colorado, right. Back to Virginia, you go.

Speaker 3  14:28
We were joking about if we couldn't find office space that was big enough for both of us. One of us just needs to get a house that has an extra room that we turn into an office and then instead of you paying for office space for us, you just give us an internet stipend. Hey,

Matthias Miller  14:45
you know if there's an affordable way to get fibre to your house, all right. Should be should be able to get some pretty good internet for the equivalent of two space there's Have you seen that I don't know how many YouTubers have done this but the youtubers who like they they take a stair out of the stair step and they turn it into like a little door that you can go downstairs into this hidden room under underneath the stairs you guys find some get a house that allows for that. I mean why would you just start it up put it in a basement or something if you had that option but you kind of have this hidden cave in office hidden off as

Speaker 1  15:34
well my other idea is that we we start a co working space in the area there and have that running as a side gig and then good house just rent space from us for an office well there you go there you go. Anyway we'll cross that bridge

Matthias Miller  16:05
if you want to steal kudos branding you can call it cowork house

Unknown Speaker  16:14
as I said

Unknown Speaker  16:15
is the reason that we'll do branding

Unknown Speaker  16:20
No, actually not too bad. I mean,

Matthias Miller  16:26
I don't know how you guys feel about having somehow with the German feel it's it'd be in the Canon system of the Korean culture be kind of hard not to have you know, kegs and in such around there to fit the Germans in but yeah. Anyway

Speaker 1  16:54
Nice nice. All right, well, now the serious work the two I do and then as you put in your stuff, is that anything you want to tackle now or is that later? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  17:13
let me do this

Matthias Miller  17:19
proposal for generic alert framework. ls I was working with Ben on the symbols proposal. They had this idea for a generic alert framework that

Speaker 1  17:38
would run on activity and alert activity alert record

Matthias Miller  17:52
Oh, sidenote we're getting very close to doing email imports for assist so

Speaker 1  18:00
as far as like meaning handling inbound emails yeah nice

Unknown Speaker  18:34
cool so that you off on this one at this point. Give me one second.

Unknown Speaker  19:00
Wait,

Matthias Miller  19:01
didn't we have you scroll a little bit because we had this idea of

Speaker 1  19:11
can you scroll up a little bit more? Notification definition

Unknown Speaker  19:26
because I was suggesting

Matthias Miller  19:26
we actually just have an RG and have everything drip driven off the

Unknown Speaker  21:33
Okay, now I'm sending it

Unknown Speaker  21:42
all right

Speaker 1  21:59
Okay, next is question here on contact, or contact we found that you made this contact types inactive and that you did. I just wrote directly here to ask the question, I was thinking that we would need contact types wanted to hear your thought process

Matthias Miller  22:27
we're not using them for facilitator, remember because somebody can be a facilitator and a member. So that's actually determined based on their group membership not based on their contact record.

Unknown Speaker  22:49
Okay. Unless we

Matthias Miller  22:55
mean currently, we're storing membership on the growth ring itself. Now we could flip that around and say, well, that's actually stored on the contact record. But still, I don't see that as needing to be a Type I see that being

Speaker 1  23:16
sure, so do we know if they're going to store any other context like non member context in the database? We're like, past memory like we need some way to handle past them like this that witness

Matthias Miller  23:35
past members would be deactivated?

Unknown Speaker  23:48
Sure,

Matthias Miller  23:53
I mean the one reason I guess, did not consider this the one reason to store memberships on the contact record

Speaker 1  24:01
is that it does make it easier if we ever have

Matthias Miller  24:06
to introduce validation on contact type in the future.

Matthias Miller  24:20
The challenging part is

Unknown Speaker  24:26
well, you know, setting up

Matthias Miller  24:29
the group for the first time possibly a little cumbersome. We didn't think through how you set up the facilitator the first time

Unknown Speaker  24:39
yeah, you then need

Matthias Miller  24:40
validation when you transfer the facilitator role where I think we're going to I mean, we were going to do that through next 30 already, but

Unknown Speaker  24:53
yeah, no, I think I think story group would be better. I have a question later on about About this somehow displaying it on the contract. Yeah, this makes sense. I think my only concern? Let's see, we just are we are repeating ourselves into a corner by not allowing them to have multiple contract states.

Matthias Miller  25:21
Do we can currently support contacts having multiple types?

Speaker 1  25:26
No, I'm sorry, like, by not by not allowing in this in the database?

Matthias Miller  25:34
Would you just have a simple, simple member contacted? Me, I don't know that we would specifically

Unknown Speaker  25:39
disallow it.

Unknown Speaker  25:43
So maybe this should still be here. I just don't think it has any meaning at this point.

Speaker 1  25:58
Yeah, well, maybe maybe we'll just put an A to do. The plan asked if they wanted to store any other types of contacts database? That's the question.

Matthias Miller  26:14
Well, the question is that, do they want to sort of the question is, do they want to start near

Unknown Speaker  26:18
future? Sure. Because we're not

Matthias Miller  26:26
I don't know, we're not completely shooting ourselves in the foot by saying

Unknown Speaker  26:30
contact types are, are meaningful.

Unknown Speaker  26:44
Yeah, we need

Unknown Speaker  26:51
this is something John Allen could implement.

Speaker 1  26:54
We need record relationship validation. So here's how it works.

Matthias Miller  27:02
You have level one, record type one, level one, you got level two, and then you have a validation message?

Unknown Speaker  27:09
And

Matthias Miller  27:11
you say, from level one? Well, here's, here's another question, do you need one too many, or many to one? Or many? Too many or one to one? But from level one? How do I find all the related level twos? So from the contact record, how do I find all the related groups? And from the group? How do I find the related contacts? And I think you each of each of these is one to many. And then you have an expression that runs on excuse me, I think it just runs on an arbitrary the first one that you still have whichever one you happen to put in column

Unknown Speaker  27:58
one. And you say then

Matthias Miller  28:08
then you code a validation message. And that validation automatically gets added in both places.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
And this would be for for catching, missing missing links basically or would you just be for saying these these are related? Remember said well that's a fair question

Matthias Miller  28:42
might require a little bit more thought if you want to handle missing

Unknown Speaker  28:54
let's see the more

Matthias Miller  28:54
along the lines of if X. If you have a member, if if somebody is a member of a group than they need to be a member type if somebody's a facilitator of the group, and he'd be a facilitator type validating that when you got data duplicated between multiple records that they align or that if somebody is a member of a group, but they're also active and so you should get a warning when you try to deactivate the contact and they're a member of a group and you should get a warning when you add it to the group and you deactivate the contact and you should have some kind of master report that says hey, look validations broken on these you need to go fix them up

Unknown Speaker  29:45
yeah

Speaker 1  29:49
yeah, no, no, that I think it does sound like like the contact types, to be extra would be needed.

Unknown Speaker  30:03
Let's create more work. As long as we just keep it all, we don't lock ourselves out of having contact states

Matthias Miller  30:24
I mean, I don't think it's as much locking ourselves out is

Unknown Speaker  30:28
I don't know how painful it's going to be. But

Matthias Miller  30:35
even that's not that painful. It's added the contact type, add, manually add the Multi Record validation. And it's and

Unknown Speaker  30:42
then three go. Symbols that they don't have different levels of membership, do they? Just basically just remember, you're not at this point no.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
All right.

Speaker 1  31:08
In the growth ring meeting record, you had made a note, we wanted to give the facilitator view where you can see all the goals, meeting summary of who's completed the goals, report. So I added in here to view the growth rate and goals. Actually, this shouldn't be meaningful. So we can either do this as a link to open a report on a page or we can do it as a as a bottom report that's only visible to facilitators. For admins.

Matthias Miller  31:55
I would do it as a link. And then if we want to make it editable, we can

Unknown Speaker  32:00
make report editable. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:09
We can do more reports. All right. You have a save button.

Matthias Miller  32:16
So if you only have one row, you'd have a way to leave the row to save it.

Unknown Speaker  32:21
Gotcha. Which you

Matthias Miller  32:23
would never I guess you never would anyway.

Speaker 1  32:27
The only time you can do that, as only one member had is as well, we still create the record.

Matthias Miller  32:35
That maybe I guess maybe it doesn't need to be editable. But you'll have five or six rows six rows per member?

Speaker 1  32:41
I don't know. Yeah, no, I think a week is gonna be cheapest, it's cheaper to implement. So, yeah. So then on that report, birth ring meeting

Unknown Speaker  33:06
being sorry, this is monthly goals. I was calling these meeting goals the other day and change it during monthly goals, then on that report

Speaker 1  33:30
would we would you think that that that report would directly show all of their goals there?

Unknown Speaker  33:39
reports or would it just be a link or report up of records with open where you can open the different goals? It would be nice to see you could see other goals there which was me yeah, you becomes a repeater G on

Unknown Speaker  34:09
that they would have would that be then a separate row for each goal? Or would that be a big wide row or big tall row? No, maybe it'd be a row per what do they call it like branch Okay, so then it would be grouped by row per left branch. They grouped by member Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:01
Then how would

Unknown Speaker  35:24
then how would linking work we wouldn't be able to show some of these other things.

Unknown Speaker  35:32
Well, those aren't for all bases I guess we could do it could be a multi payment no we don't do that either Well, it depends are we Is this a year and month required

Unknown Speaker  35:57
I wouldn't necessarily make it required

Matthias Miller  36:01
it's not required then I would do a primary grouping of year and month secondary grouping by member

Unknown Speaker  36:04
and then you don't need those columns

Matthias Miller  36:11
I mean, maybe you would just repeat the member name just so it's there but

Speaker 1  36:22
the column should include the life branch the goal the penalty the Did they hit it the yes me Oh no.

Unknown Speaker  36:39
And points and the penalty owed

Speaker 1  36:55
and handled through the penalty is on a per row basis. Yep. We have total total rail

Unknown Speaker  37:14
right okay

Speaker 1  37:34
and we're not able to do linkings we're not able to turn the the group labels grouping labels into links there we go. We do

Unknown Speaker  37:48
have that capability and I forget specifically how it works

Speaker 1  37:57
browse new your new report based on contact and we're gonna group by contact name we're gonna group by contact type and then we're gonna two buttons they have a

Speaker 4  38:26
view contacts report based in contact type referencing

Unknown Speaker  38:32
to favorites copy the paths out

Unknown Speaker  38:39
equals contact type

Unknown Speaker  38:47
enable for settings

Unknown Speaker  39:20
try stripe

Unknown Speaker  39:34
let me VPN scope

Matthias Miller  39:45
it looks like we can but it has to be the same report.

Speaker 1  39:51
As sorry, Hang on. Let me see this. I'm looking for a report button. Now I'm looking for report heading

Unknown Speaker  40:29
group actions for our 20 tootle lines

Matthias Miller  40:34
fix the above documentation this document is all that's helpful

Unknown Speaker  40:43
were asked prompts in the button parameter

Unknown Speaker  40:56
there is also a

Unknown Speaker  41:36
yeah, that's,

Matthias Miller  41:37
I believe, I believe that's the answer. If it's the same if, if it's if the link is also available actually isn't terrible. I don't think I'd even suggest this. But I'm going to try it nonetheless. Make this a primary row link. And do this. We're gonna make it not visible. We're gonna show you contacts

Unknown Speaker  42:08
okay now I shouldn't suggest this.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
Yes, we should make sure actually hang

Unknown Speaker  42:19
on the button is enabled for headings

Unknown Speaker  42:28
Why is that not?

Speaker 1  42:39
Oh, good. I guess it doesn't show us anyway. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  42:44
With zeros invaders.

Unknown Speaker  42:47
Okay, bottom

Matthias Miller  42:47
line, as long as the

Unknown Speaker  42:51
you can have a default link that's also enabled

Matthias Miller  42:57
for the headings but I don't know that there's I don't I don't see any way to have a special link for the heading rows and a different one for the

Speaker 1  43:05
report rows for the data rows. So can we just have like all the rows would be linked free and the remaining rows would would open the gold record. Now we can't I

Matthias Miller  43:26
mean, no, it has to be displayed as a link or a data row for all students displayed as a heading row heading like

Speaker 1  43:33
Okay, so we could do Okay, sure.

Speaker 1  43:44
Okay, we've got the double linking going on, even though it's the same. It's the same record. Yes, I guess. Yeah. Yes, I agree. It's weird okay

Unknown Speaker  44:10
cool. questions there? Continuing on with questions here

Speaker 1  44:27
do you know if what they use to the grocery store group ID anything is just,

Matthias Miller  44:36
I mean, I don't know that it's used for more than just whatever record identification like et cetera.

Speaker 1  44:44
Okay. I'll just let that go for now. Oh, yeah. This is a question that's like that earlier. Should we on the contact record? Should we have it Beyond the display of the group or groups that the contact is a member of yes, you see, easy viewing and report report. Okay

Speaker 1  45:27
and we need to find out from Dilbert how he was handled duplicate names because they're going for 1000 1000 members a year in the Anabaptist space Lula's

Matthias Miller  45:44
how many gestalts reasons they're gonna want to join I mean, I think we should maybe just right out of the gate had the number automatically add the number ID differentiator that's a fairly generic standardized feature

Unknown Speaker  46:02
the contact record ID yeah

Unknown Speaker  46:26
yeah

Unknown Speaker  46:33
okay I

Speaker 1  46:41
was wondering why we have the wife goals record on a separate separate record, not just a custom section on the contract.

Matthias Miller  46:53
I mean, it gets updated on an annual basis but I suppose we could have

Speaker 1  47:00
an embedded r g I didn't think about that Hmm Well that's interesting. That'll make it easier than it seems Oracle

Matthias Miller  47:12
I mean, they want them to be able to update they do have annual goals on there I guess here's the reason why not the annual goals are is already an RG so

Speaker 1  47:32
this is all going to be in RG big RG on the records you got one record for remember the big RG on it that they update every year

Unknown Speaker  47:49
yeah

Speaker 1  48:14
so then this question is answered about in his vertical

Unknown Speaker  48:20
goals so you're finally moving that over that then to the contact record. Well, how are you going to do the annual goals RG?

Speaker 1  48:47
Can we do something like we basically put we have for the addresses in the contact record

Unknown Speaker  49:00
they would see it will cycle through maybe it will see the current one. And then the next year they'd have a new one. And it'll cycle through historical goals. But they have

Unknown Speaker  49:20
they have a goal per life section.

Unknown Speaker  49:34
Right? Well, you should either essentially be a column rather than a row. Oh, you're saying Oh,

Matthias Miller  49:45
I get what you're saying. Because they're not planning to

Speaker 1  49:54
I see where you're going. Well, that could work

Matthias Miller  50:00
and if we really want to references as an RG we can have a hidden RG that auto populates based on those fields as well

Speaker 1  50:21
would look like on their contact record look basically fields are like this each of those and those like branches and then they can just cycle through and have read only year off or something of validation that you can have more than one Archie for a year things like that

Speaker 1  50:53
but then some of this stuff is is duplicate information the member for doing rd the things that we know we can do away with on the contact record

Speaker 1  51:13
we can do simple we can do a little bit fancier stuff like review and have their life vision and instructions hidden behind buttons and then have a read only text of the light vision that appears on there

Unknown Speaker  51:38
and then you

Matthias Miller  51:40
okay and then the biggest thing and we need this regardless so I'm not suggesting it's anything unique here but we do need to wait and we do need to think through when it's time for review how to get them to copy their life vision into a new life vision

Unknown Speaker  52:00
true

Speaker 1  52:08
would we have to the life vision doesn't get updated so we would that wouldn't have to be part of the Archie right we have that be separate or does everything in the section has to be where their life goals we have a second section for annual goals and we have a section for like vision defined that'd be fine I think so

Unknown Speaker  53:05
so basically be like

Unknown Speaker  53:34
this will be

Unknown Speaker  53:40
core values were is that an annual thing

Unknown Speaker  53:48
okay pretty sure it is.

Speaker 1  54:39
And then basically then we would need to figure out what to do with revalued instructions you know gold instruction for those again could just be fun. Embedded memo with

Matthias Miller  54:53
instructions would just be a read only version of the memo from

Unknown Speaker  55:03
Would that be on the there would be only be like a button they would open up? That wouldn't be a whole thing on the screen. I think the whole thing on the screen. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  55:18
That's especially if you're going into edit it. Sure

Speaker 1  55:34
Okay, well, we'll plan to spec it out and how to spec and to see what?

Unknown Speaker  55:50
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  56:01
All right. And then workflows, there were rows here talking about workflow. Curious what your, what your plans are for that? Well,

Matthias Miller  56:12
this kind of goes back to some previous conversations that we've had with Austin, etc, about, well, how does the system get used?

Speaker 1  56:18
And it's kind of like, well, how do you go

Matthias Miller  56:21
out a new member? Well, you got to add the user profile, you got to have the contact record. And then you got to go in and add them to the right group.

Unknown Speaker  56:31
Excuse me. And

Matthias Miller  56:36
then is there something that needs to happen for them to populate their goals or for their you know, something that needs to happen for their goal sheet to be created for the next upcoming meeting? Or does that happen automatically?

Unknown Speaker  56:45
Got it Sure. I wasn't sure you're talking about like actual workflows

Speaker 1  57:00
sounds good. Alright, meetup members directory reports we would need to discuss on whether this is a custom report or whether it's a

Matthias Miller  57:18
pretty sure it's because custom report

Speaker 1  57:23
unless you're really going to be a standard contacts report with with members direct report like especially if they don't have non member Yeah, I wouldn't think so.

Speaker 1  57:52
So then, the question here was we'd have certain columns will be visible for all men, all users and then some some things that we just added one thing that they had had in their sigma mockups was the ability to edit a member from

Unknown Speaker  58:13
their their directory should we allow them to the admin to edit all of these things on the directory or should we send them no, this should drill into

Matthias Miller  58:30
the into the I would think this should drill into the detail screen out series and they need to edit it here

Unknown Speaker  58:47
All right, so then that

Unknown Speaker  59:06
all right, and

Unknown Speaker  59:07
then growth reading groups reports.

Unknown Speaker  59:15
On the report to show the facilitator, we just column for facilitator, we just need the lady's name TRG. I think we're playing on a members checkbox or setting a date or should we feel it separate?

Matthias Miller  59:36
I mean, I don't know that really matters. Okay. Oh, what does make sense we only ever have one facilitator. So I guess you could have it be a separate field and just validate that have that actually might make more so that actually would make more sense and require that they also be in the Members list.

Unknown Speaker  59:57
Oh Sure Here we would say just chillin here checkbox

Unknown Speaker  1:00:32
Can we just fill it from what was checked was that well I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
don't know that we need the checkbox I mean

Speaker 1  1:00:40
you're saying replace that Sure yeah there's only going to be checked for one row anyway

Speaker 1  1:01:07
all right then question on the dashboard discipline the jury's still out we had talked some about this last hour with us and Ben I didn't get to we need to add further notes was that not remembering well we can hear

Unknown Speaker  1:01:35
what did we have

Matthias Miller  1:01:45
we basically we need to take the dashboard we need to break it down and he was open to making some tweaks and changes and I forget where I had notated those

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
okay

Matthias Miller  1:01:58
I'm gonna think we can use the dashboard I find it interesting that

Unknown Speaker  1:02:03
Roy was really

Matthias Miller  1:02:05
he said really her was pushing back in the dashboard he thought it looks too complicated. Do noisy so I don't even know that they completely know what they're looking for. And somewhat but somewhere I had put together a graph or had I send that to you Ben was that just I put that in notes and I submit to you as a message that make

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
it in here sure

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
just search for grass maybe Tim Yeah yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:02:54
dashboard

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
so as you're looking at their

Matthias Miller  1:03:16
graph of the five groups line five ad

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
nope

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
find it

Speaker 1  1:03:43
not send those not finding anything. There's nothing in Dialpad or finding any emails oh that's not good.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:59
I lost those notes

Speaker 2  1:04:09
was that from the most recent call with him last year?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
okay

Speaker 1  1:04:30
information, you might actually be able to find it on CrashPlan

Unknown Speaker  1:04:49
see if I can

Speaker 1  1:05:27
restore what was the date of the last call to eight so it's live I agree

Matthias Miller  1:06:14
I'm gonna pull up the figma while I run this thing over here and I might be able to reconstruct it just by looking at that

Matthias Miller  1:06:33
okay the y axis should be points I believe we said two graphs one for month and one for year and I think we still said and then the series is me and versus the group

Speaker 1  1:06:53
so, this would be for gold status gold status

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
so, both of those would be remember it was the y axis is

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
no it would have to series as in two bars one for group

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
one for member one for group

Matthias Miller  1:07:38
the y axis is

Speaker 1  1:07:40
points and the x axis is

Matthias Miller  1:07:50
the non life branch whatever those things are life branches

Unknown Speaker  1:08:02
and then and the points of view score points right yeah

Matthias Miller  1:08:11
and then also note that we need to prorate additional points

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16
that they get from the annual life worksheet to the appropriate branch

Speaker 1  1:08:38
so, we'll be applied to the corresponding branches yeah I

Matthias Miller  1:08:45
mean they're their general points or overall points but they should be

Unknown Speaker  1:08:49
but she would you know if you got to if you got two extra points

Matthias Miller  1:08:58
you got a five and family and a one and finance thing you would get

Unknown Speaker  1:09:05
point a point

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
additional points and family and the point two additional points or whatever whatever however it comes out the maths not right but and then the year is the exact same graph it's just across a year's time

Unknown Speaker  1:09:19
instead of Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
And then we would display a life purpose statement.

Matthias Miller  1:10:17
Yeah, so that would be a really, I think that would just be a report with a life purpose statement

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
with a link to their contact record.

Matthias Miller  1:10:38
It'd be great. Sorry, while you're doing that, at the moment, client scope went down yesterday, because we were trying to import 100 records, each 150,000 times as large as what he says the average holding record and probably the average record that we have in any of our systems. And the only way to, if the client would have encountered this, the only way to fix it is to have them send us their files and manually do surgery on the files and permanently delete those records that were causing the issue. So case in point, why do we mean this is another hat tip for but if you want to talk about capacity,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22
database capacity

Matthias Miller  1:11:24
number number one, this is this is why we use our own system internally. And this is a huge reason why like this, this would have been a very expensive, very painful problem, the client would have run an investor tools guy would have run into this. Second of all, huge selling point, I think, and in my opinion, these are the types of things that nobody likes insurance. Nobody likes to pay for preventative care. It's psychologically distasteful to most people. But

Speaker 1  1:11:59
world of headaches that we solved by doing that. Yeah, was it so Why were those 100 files being imported? Was it a test to test the system to handle it or was it it was actually legitimately importing them and nobody was taking down?

Matthias Miller  1:12:21
It was a data feed nobody knew that it was going to take things down it was it was unpredicted. In the reason was we have crash reports anytime there's a crash in a client system we import that information back into client scope. And we were importing crash records

Unknown Speaker  1:12:41
and things crashed crashed and crash reports the growth ring

Matthias Miller  1:12:58
you know monthly score and annual score those can just be simple reports as well or better yet in the graphs if you go back to the wireframe

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
Can we show I think we

Matthias Miller  1:13:11
should be able to cross your fingers to in the series title show the graph total

Unknown Speaker  1:13:18
show the combined graph total

Matthias Miller  1:13:22
to show show a graph legend that has total in it

Speaker 1  1:13:47
cool then the grocery meeting that was the report of the upcoming meeting Yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:14
development resources and investment opportunities

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
are those just reports of Yeah, recently approved. on both lists

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Okay

Speaker 2  1:15:06
then these would all meet for the standard members that looks like they had other things for the Super Admin

Unknown Speaker  1:15:10
I don't maybe this is where you're putting know

Matthias Miller  1:15:23
I don't think Super Admin has any differences between

Unknown Speaker  1:15:36
warring groups Oh top five scoring groups

Speaker 3  1:15:43
and super admin dashboard. At least on the wireframe is different. Just about completely different than the members dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:53
Oh, okay. I missed the

Matthias Miller  1:15:57
I did not take a close look at that one then can we pull up the Super Admin Dashboard

Unknown Speaker  1:16:01
and nail down what we think it should be

Speaker 1  1:16:14
do we have the links to the mock up here? Remember? Alright Sam

Speaker 1  1:16:41
Hey, thanks

Unknown Speaker  1:16:50
those links get kind of buggy sometimes for some reason.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
I'll just go to the proof. Looks like the link got broken? Oh, sure enough.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:12
You go

Unknown Speaker  1:17:18
Oh.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27
This is just not scrolled. Can you scroll down a little bit? That's one word. net new at the end. This is this is the we don't need this. We can give them a graph for

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
the top five scoring groups, I'm fine with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:56
I don't really believe that we

Matthias Miller  1:17:58
need a separate

Unknown Speaker  1:18:01
dashboard for this.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:15
So we would just use the same dashboard and have some

Unknown Speaker  1:18:23
we would

Matthias Miller  1:18:24
have the same dashboard. I mean, they could see that dashboard. But then I think either. I think maybe we just have an additional

Unknown Speaker  1:18:30
graph perhaps that we would show.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:41
Have we determined how many super admins that are allowed?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:46
Because everything I've been I don't know.

Speaker 3  1:18:52
Sometimes it almost sounds like there's only one super admin and then sometimes it sounds like there's multiple

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
it's a good point. I don't Well, I don't know that they even know. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:19:06
I mean, they've talked about it. Let me here's one reason I say that is because they talked about having kind of like an admin assistant or some equivalent. That's a super admin, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Okay

Speaker 1  1:20:04
so you're not inclined to go through the add new member route we have limitations on things like that on the dashboards anyway right? Well yeah

Matthias Miller  1:20:18
I mean I might be missing something I just just see low utility

Speaker 1  1:20:22
and that's what our menus are for it's for the Super Admin I see low utility and doing that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
all right, let's hear I think that covers all of the

Speaker 1  1:21:12
Okay, I think Ben and I will go from here then in in working on we can we've got an A talk again after after a call here

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
there and my might be good to try to get something on my calendar for us to talk again for the end of the week but let's say Thursday Thursday's pretty cool for you Matthias I mean we can can we bump can we bump Austin

Matthias Miller  1:22:00
I think this is higher priority than Austin

Speaker 1  1:22:16
Yeah, yeah, we can do that. It probably would be nice to have more than an hour but as much as we can in an hour and then go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:30
We can we can maybe do an

Unknown Speaker  1:22:33
hour for you guys is noon 12 to one

Matthias Miller  1:22:41
or I can make sure my meeting with Cliff is wrapped up and I'm back at

Speaker 1  1:22:44
the office at 1130 I don't mind doing that at all either. Or, we can do after office hours from two to 330

Speaker 1  1:23:05
to hit 330 Oh, you're saying tomorrow? No, no. You're out tomorrow. So options are one hour on Thursday. An hour or two an hour and a half between them it was cliff

Matthias Miller  1:23:26
in my office hours and Friday were an hour and a half to an hour and a half after office hours on Friday

Speaker 1  1:23:37
All right, well let's let's plan on the hour on Thursday and then if you and Ben can can work on something on Wednesday or Friday

Unknown Speaker  1:23:54
I'm not I'm out Friday and when push comes to shove I can extend the time on Friday. Uh huh

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
okay so maybe we should just

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
plan that way

Unknown Speaker  1:24:32
put like an hour and a half on Friday.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
I plan to set the

Unknown Speaker  1:25:12
okay

Speaker 3  1:25:14
and as far as 330 Eastern that's still after the diocese after hours or is that two to 330 Matthias this time

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22
I was thinking

Speaker 3  1:25:30
just showing up as two to 330 on Fridays Eastern for me

Speaker 1  1:25:37
this is oh yes Eastern yeah sorry it's showing up for me too. I was setting it up on my Facebook calendar that it was showing his time but it enjoyed my time that where I put it there Matthias come Friday is that right? That works

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:26:10
I maybe just a handful of minutes late but not much but maybe just alright so you can Yep

Speaker 1  1:26:19
and then for following up and Delbert then we would do this schedule call them beginning of next week instead of the end of this week

Unknown Speaker  1:26:38
okay

Speaker 1  1:26:45
okay, and Ben I you and I can be in touch as far as scheduling more time to work on on it. You and I together on Thursday. Okay. Or tomorrow morning? Yeah, yeah, and

Speaker 3  1:27:04
I'm completely open the rest of the week as far as calls. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:10
So whatever works best for you. Okay, good. We did not get to these other items, but

Speaker 1  1:27:25
that makes sense. send some emails or I need to review them anyway so.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:40
Okay, well, I guess we will wrap up now. Three minutes. The hours of any else are out there

Speaker 1  1:28:01
that's it. Okay. Awesome. Thanks. Oh. All right. Yep.
