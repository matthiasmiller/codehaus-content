Unknown Speaker  02:37
Yo good enough me dog. Hey. I like my new office. Dude. That's an improvement. Yep, I've moved.

Speaker 1  02:57
I am I am now what used to be in our what? While Leanne and I are actually sharing an office now we're in what used to be the conference room

Unknown Speaker  03:05
so nice. Hi.

Speaker 1  03:08
We've repainted this whole thing. It was ugly brown and we repainted the whole thing and moved in. My office is now our new logistics dispatchers office. So

Speaker 2  03:18
sweet. Fun. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

Matthias Miller  03:23
So now you have conference rooms outside in the beautiful section in North Carolina sunshine.

Speaker 1  03:28
Dude, it's been like today feels like spring. It is. It is beautiful outside. Oh, I

Matthias Miller  03:37
can't see that about here. But we are looking forward to it. That's for sure.

Speaker 1  03:44
All right, let me let me send this quick email so that I don't forget, because otherwise I'm going to forget and I am about to unload on their printers with reams of paper.

Speaker 2  04:00
Talking about inflation, accounting, inflation accounting.

Speaker 1  04:06
Yeah, Gabe gave got on the board call today and said, should we consider building in to assist the ability to compensate for inflation? And I'm sitting there thinking, wouldn't we just tie something into reporting like, tied into an asset from for adjusting things for a percentage and like, this is not build something special? This is really not that hard. And so I'm like asking some questions. And now I mean, the piece that would get a little bit interesting is if they want to say take a report and you're adjusting different categories at different percentages. So I like Alright, here's a bunch of information on inflation accounting. I just did a Google I just Googled inflation accounting. Well, sure enough, there's whole articles on this stuff. So A send that off to them figure out exactly what you want. And then take it back to Matthias and say, Can we can we build this into our reporting system for Financials? I'm like, Dude, this is easy. Matthias is whipped up more complex stuff than

Unknown Speaker  05:11
this for me. My friend, my faith is high. You sell it,

Matthias Miller  05:19
you sell the good news, I steal the bad news be like, yeah, look simple. Did you think about this?

Speaker 1  05:29
But I mean, really, they're not asking to, like, they don't want to store some special number or store some special information. It's really reported. It's all it is. They want to be able to compare 2022 and 2023, adjusted for inflation and, and be able to do comparable numbers. And I'm like, Okay, well, yeah, I don't think that's rocket science. I mean, depending on how deep you want to go, it could become rocket science. But

Unknown Speaker  05:52
we'll see. Anyway, that's literally inflation.

Speaker 1  05:57
Yeah, inflation is a tricky number to nail down though. Whatever. I really don't care about inflation. So let's not get let's not get bogged down in these details. Moving right along. I'm sorry, this is like these kinds of conversations are like so and riveting. I don't know if that's even a word. But

Unknown Speaker  06:23
anyway, well,

Matthias Miller  06:24
I just had a very fun conversation this morning with my brother. And I mean, it was fun. Having a conversation with him about him having more riveting conversations on his end and me having more riveting conversations on my end. And let's just tell you, having more of the riveting conversations and less of the unremitting ones. That's that's a, that's a beautiful thing.

Speaker 1  06:48
hope that made sense. I didn't quite follow that whole thing, but it sounded good to hear it.

Unknown Speaker  06:55
Well, let's let's go answer some

Matthias Miller  06:59
brass tacks questions.

Speaker 1  07:01
Let me let me let me throw a total side note at you before we dive into. So we've already talked about this idea of the configurator as a sales tool, as part of the website, right? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2  07:19
How much work? Two to four weeks of Josh's time. You already know this? Ah, you already talked to ah, put it up on this as a debt priorities. Wayne is giddy, you're giddy? Well, they came up with a board

Speaker 1  07:34
call today. And so Wait, Calvin was giddy. So two to four weeks of dead time. And okay. How do you? Are you envisioning driving the concept from the sheds page of a shed picture driving straight to that

Unknown Speaker  07:49
configuration?

Matthias Miller  07:52
Are you asking for Software Advice? Are you asking for marketing advice?

Speaker 1  07:56
Okay, nevermind. This is irrelevant conversation, but I don't. I'm gonna back right back out of that. Forget that question. Two to four but not creating, or you did? Are we going down the rabbit hole of creating a sale or creating a quote?

Unknown Speaker  08:13
Well, first, perfect.

Matthias Miller  08:15
I'm not sure that you guys really sure you want to allow them just to create a sale Willy? No, no, no. Okay. Yeah, no, quote,

Speaker 1  08:24
I'm an I'm envisioning that if you went and you created you configured a building, and you put in your information, it gets assigned, like a lead, like any other type form lead, probably. Okay, we're on the same page. Awesome.

Matthias Miller  08:39
That's, that's part of the two to four weeks. So we got to nail that down and figure out how that works.

Speaker 1  08:43
Two to four weeks of Josh's time, let me make a note of that, because I was tasked with finding out so now I'm it's already find out.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
Two to four weeks. Josh? How much of your time tied into the website?

Unknown Speaker  09:09
I mean, if it's true point, it's just

Matthias Miller  09:10
and I'll schedule that with Mike. And it's sort of my marketing engagement with Mark sales and marketing engagement as

Unknown Speaker  09:17
well. Yeah, but how much time? Like how long do you think it's gonna take you? I mean, if we

Matthias Miller  09:26
know we're gonna go then I'm not going to be the bottleneck. I gotta have my

Unknown Speaker  09:30
stuff done before. Josh is done with his stuff. I don't understand your question.

Speaker 1  09:40
Okay, if tomorrow we had a configurator ready to put online how long is it going to take you to implement?

Matthias Miller  09:48
We're not doing it tomorrow because we have questions about how we want to do this. But

Unknown Speaker  09:52
like, get it by the end of the week. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  09:56
Okay, so week

Matthias Miller  10:01
But my point is, this really doesn't affect. Yeah, anyway. I don't think it affects the conversation.

Speaker 1  10:14
Well, it affects the conversation from a from a, like, it's, it's a question that's going to be asked of me. So I mean, I gotta be able to answer something good

Unknown Speaker  10:22
by a week. Got it. That was estimate by making up numbers. Estimates are

Matthias Miller  10:40
some better than others.

Unknown Speaker  10:42
Estimates are just really educated guesses.

Matthias Miller  10:46
Some more educated than others. Well, yeah, I'm just repeating myself. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  10:54
Let me ask a different question.

Speaker 2  10:55
If if we said, Tomorrow

Speaker 1  11:00
we are starting on the path of putting this configurator online? How much design time do you think we're going to need to rattle around on?

Unknown Speaker  11:20
Not a lot.

Matthias Miller  11:25
Okay, there's three ways you can do this one, send people straight to the visualizer to? Well, there's two ways you can do this one, send them straight to the visualizer to send through the tapeworm first

Unknown Speaker  11:40
three split test. Oh, definitely split test?

Matthias Miller  11:45
I mean, I know I'm going to do that. But yeah. I think most of the designs actually nailed down already.

Speaker 1  11:52
But okay, as far as, as far as Okay, let me let me ask the question in a slightly different way. Obviously. If Josh makes where we can put the configurator on, on a website, you're going to tie in true point, you're gonna do all the three points work if Ohio just said I want to do the same thing. It really is just URLs, right? Like, you're going to have to define the URL to wherever you want to land on the configurator. So it should it's pretty, it would be pretty straightforward at that point.

Unknown Speaker  12:27
Am I thinking right?

Matthias Miller  12:29
Yeah, I think so. I think I think we just give them the URL where to drive people to and all right,

Speaker 1  12:38
I'm done talking about that. I'm really, really hoping we go down this route.

Matthias Miller  12:45
Dude, you know how this is these guys have put a ton of money in just the sales and marketing engine but that's just a matter of time before we start seeing this stuff. Like the compound step.

Speaker 2  13:01
I know having the Rockstar closer like the gene guy would make a difference but the compound interest that we're gonna buy

Unknown Speaker  13:11
has has waned, talked about his new Nathan.

Matthias Miller  13:15
He sent me an email. He's just beyond. I don't know about the new. No, this is the new guy. The Fort Wayne guy. Yeah. He hasn't talked about him yet.

Unknown Speaker  13:25
He sent an email

Speaker 1  13:27
I've never had I've never had a salesperson show up on the first week and sell sell as much he'd sold three buildings like $30,000 in the first week. His first day on it like first week on the job. I

Unknown Speaker  13:39
well this is also the

Matthias Miller  13:41
this is also the guy who was griping on his Facebook no he shared one of our Indiana posts about finally our marketing guys are doing something

Unknown Speaker  13:50
what? Yeah, on his on his Facebook

Unknown Speaker  13:58
people like have some decorum please. Good luck, Wayne. I told ya he's gonna be a little bit of a handful but he's gonna sell

Unknown Speaker  14:06
buildings for sure. Oh, here's a handful.

Matthias Miller  14:10
Let me see if I can find him. Just because I can

Matthias Miller  14:22
I've got better things to do. Yeah, here we go. This one

Unknown Speaker  14:44
Jonathan asked

Matthias Miller  14:44
if he should comment on the post

Unknown Speaker  14:52
anyway, um, fun times. Okay. So the opportunity linking

Speaker 1  15:05
Hold on a second, I have a meme in discord for this that is

Matthias Miller  15:13
waiting. Okay, this is worth hanging in for

Unknown Speaker  15:17
it really is.

Unknown Speaker  15:23
Let me see if I can screenshot this

Speaker 1  15:30
this is exactly like this, this is this is how i i, there are a lot of times in life where I look like this

Unknown Speaker  15:47
letter is

Speaker 1  15:48
seriously. Um, okay. So back to our first question. Go ahead.

Matthias Miller  15:55
Linking opportunities, cross your fingers, I think it should auto link, but tell me if you're seeing something that doesn't. What are

Unknown Speaker  16:02
the links? What are we talking about?

Matthias Miller  16:04
Does the CRM have marketing opportunity? One if there's a sale? Here, let me tell you

Speaker 1  16:13
like, quotes, I know you think of quotes and opportunities, but what I was curious if if does the software do the same thing looking for buildings that were sold?

Unknown Speaker  16:35
Oh, goodness,

Matthias Miller  16:36
I don't know.

Speaker 1  16:39
No. Let me ask a separate question. A second question to that. If it doesn't, do we want it to? Well,

Matthias Miller  16:47
I don't think my team of Emerson Tory don't necessarily want it to because I think we might exclude it from the TT report, if they will have

Unknown Speaker  16:54
follow up tasks.

Matthias Miller  16:57
Like they do check in with the customer after it's been, you know, post sale post delivery. And so they don't want to completely closed out.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
Okay, moving

Speaker 1  17:12
on, I'm going to assume that you don't have anything running to actually link those. I

Matthias Miller  17:16
think the answer is correct. And that's fine. Because

Speaker 1  17:19
I wanted to know, just because I want to make sure I know. But we already talked about putting the configured on the website, blah, blah, blah. Let's talk about CRM metrics.

Unknown Speaker  17:31
Can we can we

Speaker 1  17:32
can we, like you. We talked we briefly talked about this about a pipeline metrics and graph like you already have a pipe like a pipeline metrics thing? Can we update that thing to be like? Or have you already updated it?

Unknown Speaker  17:50
No, I mean, I've done nothing with the graph.

Speaker 1  17:54
So right now, if you click, if you click sales pipeline, you get a left hand pane, you get a unclaimed yet not qualified, not yet qualified, you get a bunch of lead information. And then there was the graph, and then you have follow up tasks, and then you have some lead source information

Unknown Speaker  18:11
is this?

Speaker 1  18:14
Well, first question I really have is, like, if I want to if we want to start automating something out, Wayne wants some stuff to see like he wants to some kind of closed rate information. And I know you have a bunch of stuff in the management side. But what I don't know that you're taking into account and this is sort of where this conversation about a sale where the opportunities doesn't show one, like if the if the dealer, okay, back up, run backwards. What I don't think you're taking into account on your close rates is for especially for brick and mortar dealers are the people that end up walking on the lot. Now, if they walk them a lot, and they they create a contact that create opportunity, then you would be accounting for it correct?

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Right. Okay.

Speaker 1  19:03
And maybe it's really a moot point, but what do you have as far as like, what can what can I start sending in for close rates? Are you already sending him something or where are we at what what is he talked to you about?

Matthias Miller  19:16
He's not talking to me about anything we have a recurring call

Unknown Speaker  19:21
starting next week.

Matthias Miller  19:26
So no, he has not talked to me about anything.

Unknown Speaker  19:29
I mean, I have a

Matthias Miller  19:31
in depth close rate based on date of lead receipt, but I don't know that that's actually what he wants.

Unknown Speaker  19:39
This is underneath. Online Sales

Matthias Miller  19:42
Team, management pipeline metrics,

Speaker 1  19:45
pipeline metrics, pipe and pipe the impact of pipe pipe pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe and simplified are the metrics.

Speaker 2  19:52
Metrics. This is the deep dive

Unknown Speaker  20:02
By the way,

Matthias Miller  20:05
jury's still out. I don't know that we've got enough data to prove this. But I think part of our sales conversion problem is that I have a relatively strong suspicion part of our sales conversion problem was that we were feeding too many leads to Emerson Tory, and they didn't

Speaker 2  20:17
have time for follow up to your appointment. In which case, our numbers

Matthias Miller  20:23
are fine. And we just need to scale this thing. So

Speaker 1  20:26
I don't, okay, I've got this sneaking suspicion, it's too easy to get a lead right now. And we are getting a ton of people coming through like, well, and we talked about this, I started reading through some comments and stuff, it's like, people don't even get back to them sometimes, like, so are people are people going and filling out the type form thinking they're going to get some piece of information?

Matthias Miller  20:50
Yes, they are. So rather, not to bore you with all the details, but we're working on fixing it.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
So I mean, there's Yeah. Are you the source?

Speaker 1  21:04
Are you working on fixing it from the campaign side or from type form side? Which is

Matthias Miller  21:12
tweaking tweaking the tapeworm fixing the campaign a bit?

Speaker 2  21:16
Okay, so I don't know exactly what? Well, it's not the full solution. But

Matthias Miller  21:27
we could straight up ask him, Hey, do you want to continue to have this? I mean, do you want to do you want somebody to

Speaker 2  21:33
have a conversation with somebody and and let people disqualify themselves. Again, split testing,

Matthias Miller  21:41
as we go to make sure we don't shoot ourselves in the foot, but

Speaker 1  21:44
but at this at the point that they actually reached the type form they've already paid for the click anyway, right. So work. So working on refining that conversation from the campaign side would actually be more cost effective.

Matthias Miller  21:58
I mean, not necessarily, I mean, we can we can optimize for what we want to do is optimize, first of all, for qualified leads in eventually for sales. And so I mean, it's just a matter of getting that dialed in, we already have some things in place that I could work with Jonathan to start feeding custom audiences to optimize for qualified leads, but

Unknown Speaker  22:20
anyway, and that

Matthias Miller  22:23
by itself would go a long way. I mean, it's not ideal, but Google will then stop I mean, we'll gradually shift the audience towards people who we want to see instead of just to anybody who fills out their

Speaker 1  22:35
jolly type form okay, so I'm looking at your I'm looking at your metrics so leads receive that's pretty easy. Okay, what qualifies a lead what what is the what are you what leads qualified lead

Matthias Miller  22:54
this number needs to be clarified currently, it's a phone call that's recorded as a communication or are they specifically flagged the lead as having been qualified what I want to change it to is to automatically qualify based on having received an SMS message or having received a personal email from that from that lead? And that is a sign of life that qualifies them are they responsive? Yes or no? Do they have any sign of life

Speaker 1  23:23
percentage qualify paid obviously, that would be pretty pretty simple to understand that one leads quoted that's pretty simple. And I'm assuming that's just all any lead that they quote goes against the number Yeah, that percentage of well and yeah,

Matthias Miller  23:46
and this is actually based on this is based on a little bit of a confusing report in some ways, but it also makes a lot of sense it's based on when was the lead received and it traces that lead the whole way through the process

Speaker 1  24:01
this is too complex to feed to somebody like Wayne what's what are we doing in simplified let's go look at simplified

Speaker 2  24:05
I mean, the eyes are gonna glaze I agree leads receive leads one

Speaker 1  24:18
Yeah, but your two numbers your two reports on the green now maybe they do

Speaker 2  24:23
Yep. I don't know might not be I don't know they did anything with

Speaker 1  24:28
Oh, nevermind. No, no, no, I'm Ross got it. Nevermind ignore it. Ignore my comment about your they don't agree. One percentage

Unknown Speaker  24:41
let's see. Let's go look at

Unknown Speaker  24:47
I don't know which would

Unknown Speaker  24:50
have been if I'm going to send this out. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:59
Everyone He says they weren't pretty numbers. But here's the here's the MR persnickety, what do you actually want to know?

Speaker 1  25:18
Okay, at the end of the day, what a sales manager wants to know is who's performing and who's not performing? How do we measure that? Well, I mean, obviously, I'm gonna rephrase who's performing with the dollars that I'm sending that, okay, so, dealer one receives leads dealer to receive leads, dealer, three receive leads. And each one of those costs me a certain amount of money, who's performing with the money that I'm spending? What's my ROI on that number, that number and that number. And I mean, right now, that's a closing number. Now, I feel like a closing percentage is a fairly it's a fairly broad number, because you're basically looking at units one lead to one building sold, that's a one to one ratio, but it's not like you might have spent $1.25 For that lead and sold a $15,000 building. But if you spent $1.25, for that lead, or $2, and some whatever your numbers are currently at, if you spent $2 and some for that lead, and you sell a $4,000 building, those two are not the same number.

Matthias Miller  26:24
It's not I mean, are you looking for Rose? I mean, you're saying row as is what you're looking at return on adspend?

Speaker 1  26:31
Pardon of me thinks we should build some type of report that says, Okay, fine, let's use let's use a unit lead to sale fine, they'll give it we'll call that a closed percentage. But then we really should look at some type of row as I think that's a great idea, like some way to quantify this thing so that you can feed something back to a sales manager, that's that's looking at the numbers and going and maybe it's maybe a high level numbers are fine. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  26:58
I mean, I mean,

Matthias Miller  26:59
straight up, what's your benchmark? Your benchmark here is predominantly comparison, is this guy doing better than the other guy? Correct. And so as a sales manager, that's probably the thing they're most likely to care about. Now, the business owner is more likely to care about what is the overall marketing budget? And are we under under allocated percentage and the sales manager should care about that? Because that's, well, that's kind of his responsibility within the sandbox that he's gotten to play in, but I mean, we can do this very simply. As a two numbers, three core numbers. How many leads did you get this month?

Unknown Speaker  27:36
Yeah. How many did you close? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:40
What is the percentage of leads that you closed? And what is the dollar value per lead

Unknown Speaker  27:44
that you closed? average dollar value?

Matthias Miller  27:48
average dollar value? So if you got 100 leads you closed one for $10,000 then you made $1,000 per lead?

Unknown Speaker  27:57
Yeah, I think that'd be a great start. Are you breaking it? Would you break it down by the month or the week?

Unknown Speaker  28:08
I don't know what does he want? Well,

Speaker 1  28:12
this this is how much Wayne knows about what he wants? I want some kind of report to know what our close rate is well, okay, that's a you know,

Speaker 2  28:20
go ha you do both you do both months and weeks. Here do this

Unknown Speaker  28:28
so would it be two different reports

Unknown Speaker  28:30
no

Matthias Miller  28:34
are you you're sitting down your new office

Unknown Speaker  28:39
chairs loading I'm looking at

Speaker 1  28:50
Oh, and then we really should we should really try to encapsulate all dealers in well you probably want to do it by district can we do it by district? Are you gonna do it by specific dealer? We're gonna do district I think districts like we should group for dealer.

Unknown Speaker  29:06
Now I've got something better than that.

Speaker 1  29:36
Dude, I just got the first glimpse of Josh's rework of logistics. I am so freaking excited. That's good. Why we basically went exactly like the original spec on what we what we originally designed for is exactly the direction we went then.

Speaker 1  29:57
But but do having a standalone budget Six records that I can tie to a sales order or building record, turn it into a whole bunch of different types. Dude, the flexibility is endless. I am so stoked right now.

Speaker 2  30:08
Do you want to see this one month at a time? One month at a time?

Matthias Miller  30:13
Or do you want to see it through indefinite history?

Speaker 1  30:19
Oh, you're saying historical how much? How much history do you want to see?

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Yeah. Why don't we do a year so week,

Speaker 1  30:32
year to date by week. Obviously, we ask Chrome to go back like to change your year back and go look at last year's?

Unknown Speaker  31:32
Wait, what?

Speaker 1  31:36
What's your thought on on a version of this is actually on the dealer portal, they can see their own close rate.

Unknown Speaker  31:44
Yeah, it'd be good.

Speaker 1  31:46
That would be awesome. dealer can see that at any point in time, they can see exactly what their close rate is.

Speaker 2  31:53
Oh, except I can't repeat this by more than a single column. Can we make columns for each week? We don't want to do

Unknown Speaker  32:04
that. That would be obnoxious. What do you mean?

Unknown Speaker  32:09
No, we'll do this contact level report. Nevermind. Okay, nevermind. Let's do Deanna.

Unknown Speaker  32:21
What time do you have to drop today?

Unknown Speaker  32:24
Bottom of the hour? 330. Yeah,

Speaker 1  32:29
in like 15 minutes. All right. You already know the direction you want to go on this. I don't really want to talk about one of the things. So

Matthias Miller  32:37
let me let me do one other thing okay.

Unknown Speaker  33:12
Okay, go for it. All right.

Unknown Speaker  33:17
Don't Don't don't pull out your gun and shoot me too hard.

Unknown Speaker  33:21
Okay. I'll keep it gentle.

Speaker 1  33:26
What can we do about responses for

Unknown Speaker  33:31
Active Campaign? Amy replies,

Speaker 1  33:35
is obnoxious to dump all the replies to everybody and have them go searching whether it yeah, we'll fix

Matthias Miller  33:39
it within a few weeks. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  33:42
We'll do email imports. Tight into,

Matthias Miller  33:45
okay, that was easy. Here's some records. That was easy. I actually have most of it coded. But do you want to know who the bottleneck is? Okay, first of all, you know how these guys work? We have 1001 ideas. First of all, everybody has 1001 ideas of what we need to do fix right now to make our lives better. Yeah. Five of those things are actually going to significantly move the needle. If the worst thing in your day is archiving 10 emails.

Unknown Speaker  34:15
I mean, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  34:18
Anyway, I have some pretty intolerant but yeah, I'm the bottleneck here. And there's all kinds of things that I think I think this is good to do. I think it should be done.

Unknown Speaker  34:31
It's probably

Matthias Miller  34:32
near the top of the list. I don't know that it's literally the top of the list, but

Unknown Speaker  34:37
there you go. Got it.

Unknown Speaker  34:41
So fixes coming couple of weeks. Got it. Okay, so um, last thing I got 10 minutes is can we come up with a can we come up with a way

Unknown Speaker  34:59
who's gonna complain? mean?

Speaker 1  35:02
How can I stay in the loop on on what's happening? So that when brick and mortar or when salespeople are contacting me on Discord, I know what's going on? What kinds of questions? Wow, this this whole the the last one that I just feel it was this whole tons of emails coming not okay 30 some emails coming in to reply at replies from but and I'm like we have

Matthias Miller  35:29
a call every single morning for 30 minutes and I say do you have any questions? Do you know how many how many times this has come up? Oh, I know, I know. And Ginger has asked about it and I told her like we'll take care of it. Like

Unknown Speaker  35:45
I said, don't shoot me too hard.

Matthias Miller  35:46
Well, I'm not shooting you. I'm just shooting

Unknown Speaker  35:49
somewhere else. Well, but I mean,

Speaker 1  35:52
so I ended up being support on all kinds of these things. So knowing about what, I don't really want to be on your calls, either. That's no, you don't. So don't start.

Unknown Speaker  36:03
I think that.

Matthias Miller  36:06
I mean, one of the things I have to work out with Mike too, is making gave him this great idea of bringing these things together. And I know I should have asked this question earlier, but I have enough things on my mind. I don't think of everything preemptively. But we needed to figure out whose responsibility is what, what needs to be covered, what needs to be addressed, who trains who like, fill in the blank, there's no way I can I can support all these people.

Speaker 1  36:28
That's my that is entirely my point. Because I end up being the de facto of support people. And if I don't know what's coming down the pipe or what's being worked on, or what direction is going, what I'm kind of lost. So it's not a it's not a huge pain point. At this point. Just because I can fail usually be smart enough to go figure these things out pretty quickly.

Unknown Speaker  36:48
But you're welcome to ping me on some of these things.

Speaker 2  37:02
Our mantra is go fast. break fast, fix fast.

Matthias Miller  37:07
I don't like well, things are broken. We'll just let them be broken for a little while. It'll get better.

Unknown Speaker  37:13
We'll get to it. I don't know.

Speaker 1  37:17
Yeah, okay. You and I understand that we live in the software world. But when when you're a dealer sitting out there you're the sole person in the office and you're feeling frustrated

Matthias Miller  37:26
it I mean dealers are expressing frustration to you right now

Unknown Speaker  37:37
Ah

Speaker 1  37:40
well, you don't meet with Indiana deals a lot of a lot of this is we were attended to bring Indiana into a bunch of this stuff and you're not having calls with Indiana. So it's, it's it's more the the fluids in the Nathan's. And, and that kind of a thing, like trying to keep them abreast of like, what what you're covering in your calls, I'm trying to keep them up to speed with, you know, with what little I know.

Unknown Speaker  38:06
Well, so

Matthias Miller  38:11
I can't help. I don't feel like I've got good tools to help the Indiana bridge. From my perspective, there's probably been, there's probably one dealer in particular, who's going to be most vocal about these types of things in North Carolina. And so if it's affecting Calvin and Marcus, and it's creating pain for them,

Unknown Speaker  38:29
I want to know that as well.

Speaker 1  38:36
That particular dealer is also the highest selling dealer in North Carolina.

Unknown Speaker  38:40
I understand. So

Matthias Miller  38:50
again, I'm not opposed to fixing it. That's not the point. The point is, we have priorities here.

Speaker 1  38:57
No, no, no, no, no, no, you're I think you're I think your your Don't, don't go off the reservation here. Um, you already answered my question. You already said you're going for it. So. All right, well, I

Matthias Miller  39:08
have your direct answer. I think the short term is

Speaker 2  39:11
the short term, I'm gonna do nothing. I know what the real problem is. junuh No.

Matthias Miller  39:19
This is a this is a curse of the fragmentation between this districts. And if we had one sales team like then we were then we'd be bringing then we would be bringing department heads together to solve these problems. Not trying to have multiple department heads in different different districts. So it's just

Speaker 1  39:41
this is not this is not the curse of the fragmentation of districts. This is just the curse of humanity.

Unknown Speaker  39:48
Well, okay, fine.

Matthias Miller  39:51
I have also become resigned to the fact that I keener this already about myself. I like working with Have a handful of close, you know a handful of people.

Speaker 1  40:04
And then yeah, this is why I thought you're nuts on having daily calls what in the freaking world are you having? Like you're gonna drive yourself insane

Unknown Speaker  40:14
it's actually not bad.

Matthias Miller  40:18
I'm getting an assistant. Hopefully in the next few weeks, I had a argument with my recruiting company because they said we have an assistant that works for you. And I said I have one more screening I want to do and they said that's not necessary. I said, Yes, it is. I've hired people before. They said no, it's not I said yes, it is. You're gonna give me another candidate. So good to go find me another candidate. So anyway, once I have some of that stuff nailed down, we can get a supportive cadence around me that's going to make a lot of this stuff easier as well. But

Unknown Speaker  40:52
we'll see we'll see when this changes

Unknown Speaker  40:55
in your office or remote remote

Unknown Speaker  41:16
so

Speaker 1  41:17
good. Um, I feel like I should there was something else but I don't I didn't write it down. So we're gonna talk about it. Well, it's easy. That was easy transfer. Me trucks.

Matthias Miller  41:31
Sweet man. That's what I do on the weekend.

Unknown Speaker  41:34
I'm not kidding for logistics

Speaker 1  41:43
like the literally the beginning of this year, all districts are like, oh, I want to buy a truck. I don't buy a truck. Oh no, actually I want to buy today. No, no, I'm gonna buy two trucks to Indiana's adding to Ohio's adding to North Carolina's adding one that's five you want to you want to your brain want to melt

Unknown Speaker  42:12
you know what these things these stupid things cost.

Unknown Speaker  42:17
Are you guys doing?

Matthias Miller  42:20
You guys pull them with semis or other trucks?

Speaker 1  42:24
Both these are these are dodge 30 fives and 4500s. You want these silly things cost? No idea. At $2,000

Unknown Speaker  42:36

Speaker 2  42:46
No 2020 and the 2020 I paid 52,000 for it. It's been crazy. It's been absolutely crazy. Two years later to talk about it.

Speaker 1  42:58
Two years later and trucks have gone up over $30,000

Matthias Miller  43:02
That's a percentage increases. They're just pretty terrible.

Unknown Speaker  43:06
Think about that for a while.

Speaker 1  43:08
This is this is what's crazy Matthias a mid year mid to mid year last year. I bought the first truck for Indiana and I bought it off the lot already had a bit on and it wasn't a Dodge 4500 SL T It was like an upgraded model. It had an SLT package. And I spent I thought I was I thought I'd hit the wall when I spent $72,000 on it. Mm hmm. He's the rest of these that I've just buying now. They're just tradesmen package. I'm spending $82,000 is crazy. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Go buy a used truck? You wanna you want repair bills and headaches and trucks sitting on the side of the road?

Unknown Speaker  43:55
Fun? Yeah, well,

Matthias Miller  43:58
