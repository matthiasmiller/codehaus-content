Speaker 1  05:00
Yeah, Bob, Yo, man, here we go. Hey. How are we? Sir, good, right, good, awesome.

Matthias Miller  05:15
So we don't have any linking, but we are getting invoices in now. Sorry, we're not, we're not getting any here. Hang on,

Unknown Speaker  05:26
my volume was down to me, but

Matthias Miller  05:32
so we got, we're not doing any linking or calculations, but we got invoices coming In.

Unknown Speaker  05:38
Yeah, which?

Speaker 2  05:59
You said we have invoices coming in. Sorry. Let me a little more context.

Matthias Miller  06:08
We're pulling in invoice data from Sage, right?

Speaker 2  06:13
That's so hard to hear in this room. Yeah? Invoice from say, yeah. So in in are we screen sharing?

Speaker 1  06:24
Not yet. Am I not okay? Here, let me here.

Unknown Speaker  06:30
Where am I at? Shoot, sorry. Oh, no, here. I got it.

Speaker 1  06:36
I gotta do this. My bad. Okay? Share.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Oh, come on.

Unknown Speaker  06:56
I get that to go away.

Matthias Miller  06:58
Which one I seeing? It

Unknown Speaker  07:09
All right, so

Unknown Speaker  07:14
on this page, on this page,

Unknown Speaker  07:20
we're trying to

Unknown Speaker  07:25
eliminate everything that doesn't belong.

Unknown Speaker  07:30
So sorry,

Matthias Miller  07:32
yeah, what we're specifically after right now is these sales orders that they say they canceled and are showing up or like we want to, we want to find some of those and fix them all

Unknown Speaker  07:47
right, I'm a pull.

Speaker 2  07:51
I want to go to the other office with Tina. That's going to work best. Okay, yeah, give me a second, Matt. Do

Speaker 3  08:17
eight. Okay, so, just heard from Calvin. I think.

Speaker 2  08:26
No, I'm on the sorry, I'm going to make it. But no, I haven't, okay, yeah, I haven't even just call him if you if you need to.

Speaker 4  08:37
Yep, all right, no, you can just put it up. That's fine, perfect. So I was coming over.

Speaker 2  08:43
I'm sorry. No, you're fine. Well, actually, we need to say access. Well, you might want to access stage shift. So have you met Matt? Um, I think when soon, Matt, there's Tina, hey. Tina, yeah, good. So we're

Speaker 2  09:10
Well, Matt, what can you say that again? Matt, I

Matthias Miller  09:15
lost you guys. You're back. Okay?

Speaker 2  09:19
So we were trying to identify orders on this bottom section that were deleted or canceled. Correct. That is correct. So I guess we'll have to

Speaker 4  09:31
go, Okay. Well, it. Amanda was just showing me today that in the in the main screen, the home screen, there's like a new two little sage tabs, yep. And the first one was sage orders. And then when I go in there and it gives me a little button at the very bottom to click, to delete, like to show it's deleted.

Matthias Miller  09:56
That's not the I don't want you doing anything. With that at the moment. Okay, that's fine. That'll get erased. What we want to do,

Unknown Speaker  10:10
we're talking about this right here, right? Yeah, that's something

Matthias Miller  10:13
I'm using internally. Okay,

Speaker 4  10:17
okay, well, that we won't because that's what I was going to ask you. What I want to do is go away.

Matthias Miller  10:23
I mean, the first step before we do anything manually is, can we find one of these that are hanging around, that shouldn't be hanging around? And if so, you know, can we

Unknown Speaker  10:37
so we should look in these July?

Speaker 4  10:39
Well, I can. I can give you one that's more recent because we were looking at it. Yep, it would be 80582. That's the sales order number. Should I

Unknown Speaker  10:53
you want to look there, Matt, or should I

Matthias Miller  10:55
go, yeah, let me, let me take a look.

Speaker 4  10:58
And it's a it's an AR. It's Armstrong World Industries. I don't know how you see that, but it's a 0001, and it should be 805025828, sorry, 80582.

Speaker 5  11:14
Yep, it's, it's not here in this Well, wait a minute, it could be here.

Unknown Speaker  11:20
Roll up a little bit more.

Unknown Speaker  11:25
See, they're mixed. They're not in, they're

Speaker 4  11:27
by feet. And it should be actually 922, so you're not, oh,

Unknown Speaker  11:35
it's not, not here.

Speaker 4  11:42
Well, um, we'll see earlier. We did, we did the 80581, yeah, which is the one above it. And we click the Delete button and then just to see what it would do. But it stayed on the it stayed on there. So we didn't do any more with it. And we said we got to ask,

Unknown Speaker  12:00
yeah. So

Matthias Miller  12:02
I'm seeing that this thing is marked as canceled and does not have an invoice date, which means it got removed from the list, right? It was deleted, which is what we expect,

Speaker 4  12:14
right? But it's still on the list, like that. Stuff's still there. You mean, in here,

Speaker 5  12:21
I'm not seeing, I'm not, I'm not seeing it, though.

Matthias Miller  12:26
Do we have, I mean, we don't have any, we don't have any assembly here. Let's go. Let's show historical work orders. See if there's, we don't have any assembly tracker items tied to it. And I don't think, I mean, I'm, I don't think it's on the bottom. Okay, hang on.

Speaker 4  12:42
Well, there's no there's no assembly work orders because we deleted it so there's nothing's going to be hooked to it, right?

Matthias Miller  12:51
So we ran into an issue in the sage import did not run until like, 15 minutes ago. So when did you cancel this order in sage?

Speaker 4  13:00
It was before lunch. Okay, that's why, yeah, okay, so, yeah, but, but it was still on the line, like it was still, it was still down here. Yeah, was

Matthias Miller  13:12
it Yes, and the reason was that I pushed an update last night, and the the sage import temporarily quit working.

Unknown Speaker  13:23
Got it okay? So

Matthias Miller  13:24
that's working. Do we have any other ones that are in the list that were canceled

Speaker 4  13:31
so well, I mean, it, I canceled one that, but it's not for till next week. Would that show up or not because they don't need to use it yet? Doesn't have an invoice? Does it have to be something that would have like be in the past?

Matthias Miller  13:48
Yeah, I'm looking for something that's showing down in the bottom section here, as active, you know, as something that needs to be done. So I'm going to go back to

Unknown Speaker  14:01
just the open ones. So we have currently 372

Unknown Speaker  14:09
open right?

Speaker 2  14:12
This is sort of by date, if we go back to June, so like there's a couple here.

Unknown Speaker  14:17
Well, let's, let's go to that 179799,

Unknown Speaker  14:20
right? Yep, Armstrong.

Unknown Speaker  14:23
Armstrong, 79799

Unknown Speaker  14:26
July 1.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
Give me another 179. 800 now that's good. Let's go with something not Armstrong,

Speaker 2  14:36
okay, 798161, and 679817798417984579718,

Speaker 5  15:00
Eight, yeah.

Speaker 2  15:06
I mean, what? What if? Matt, well, what are some that we that we cancel sometimes? Tina like,

Speaker 4  15:13
well, that's why it's like Bosh, Armstrong times the Iron Hill. Let me do that. 7987812, Simons, because we just canceled a couple days. But that was

Unknown Speaker  15:28
seven. There's a 79915,

Unknown Speaker  15:31
Iron Hill.

Speaker 4  15:36
That particular one that's all in here. Is it? What does it say? Though it's iron poly, just seven.

Speaker 2  15:45
Yeah, yeah, seven. Well, Matthias, we there may not be any left in this list, correct?

Speaker 4  15:52
Well, that I do not know, because the ones that normally would be, would be like, Bosh,

Unknown Speaker  16:04
it

Speaker 2  16:06
would be, there's an Armstrong for July 28, 8080070, I can do all well we get through All the Armstrong ones that are in here.

Unknown Speaker  16:18
800-708-0070, Matt,

Matthias Miller  16:24
800 sorry,

Unknown Speaker  16:27
80070 Yep.

Matthias Miller  16:31
Okay, and so that one's in there. That one was canceled.

Speaker 4  16:37
It orders, that's good. Yeah, we canceled that one, or I deleted it. I do in my thing. I deleted it off because they canceled it from the company. So we deleted out of the system. So I guess that's what we were asking is, once it's deleted out of sage, can it be taken off that list? So do we have to look through but

Matthias Miller  17:01
I'm seeing it tied to an invoice. Invoice, 98784, invoiced on August 1 with 276 shipped and 276 back ordered.

Speaker 4  17:13
That's, you know what you're right? Because we only ship the partial. We only ship the partial, and then we deleted the rest. So that's not going to be a good one to look at.

Matthias Miller  17:26
Okay, so that one, in that case, what we need to do is MERV, once we make the changes to calculate the to use the ship, I guess, the ship quantity, right? Then that'll, I mean, that's what we need to do on this one.

Unknown Speaker  17:41
Yeah, shipped quantity or invoice quantity.

Matthias Miller  17:46
Sorry, wait, we don't have a order. We have the order quantity and the ship quantity, but not the invoice quantity.

Speaker 2  17:57
Well, is that? Wait, where are you getting ship quantity.

Matthias Miller  18:03
Rick is sending it over with the sage stuff,

Speaker 2  18:06
but that that should match invoice. I mean, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  18:10
just an invoice should be the same.

Unknown Speaker  18:12
Should be the same.

Matthias Miller  18:14
I mean, so can I just use, I mean, the ship quantity on this is 276 Can I

Unknown Speaker  18:19
just use that? Yep,

Speaker 2  18:23
yeah. Cuz, where would he get that? Because, off the off the ice, yeah, the only time we change it,

Unknown Speaker  18:31
well, we change

Unknown Speaker  18:32
it in here first, and then we only invoice what we ship.

Speaker 2  18:36
But, but do you change you? Do you ever go and change the just the order quantity?

Speaker 4  18:40
Tina sometimes, and I started doing that now, when we know right doesn't mess tea up now, but we didn't know that back in July, like I didn't know that.

Speaker 2  18:49
So you just started changing the actual quantity prior, otherwise, previously, the only change was it wasn't one

Speaker 4  19:01
working when it says it's 552, on the order. But I only ship 276 so then 276 they're kind of back ordered. We didn't, and that's what he's seen, yeah.

Speaker 2  19:09
We didn't change the quantity of the order. We just invoiced a different quantity,

Matthias Miller  19:14
correct, right? And back order the rest. Yep,

Speaker 4  19:18
yeah. But then it, then after that, I deleted it, but, but I mean, it's, did I need to change it first? Yeah, okay, I get that. Yep.

Speaker 2  19:28
So, so it would have seemed Matt that potentially,

Unknown Speaker  19:36
well, from now, right,

Speaker 2  19:39
no, no, right, it, but Matt, for the quantity change that versus the order. Is that doable? On your side?

Matthias Miller  19:47
Yeah, that's using the I broke it down to you how we need to do that? We don't. There's not a one to one correlation between so the very short answer. Is, yes, if you want to get into the weeds of that, you can, but short answers,

Speaker 2  20:03
no, I don't. I'm, I'm fine not getting into the weeds.

Unknown Speaker  20:09
Good, all right. Well, that'll

Speaker 2  20:15
there'll be a few more that we have to reconcile. But at this point, if I don't, if I just go by date,

Unknown Speaker  20:28
actually, what am I doing? Here

Unknown Speaker  20:35
we go. Wait, what am I doing wrong here? Man, I don't get by date. Let me go by date.

Speaker 2  20:42
Here we go. So since, anyway, since the migration, we're trying to clean up everything since migration.

Unknown Speaker  20:51
Wait, that's not great duty.

Unknown Speaker  20:57
Here we go.

Speaker 2  21:01
So up until today, there's only 100 and September, 185 there's only 185 orders that need reconciled in this

Unknown Speaker  21:16
now, once they're reconciled, will they go away from this bottom?

Unknown Speaker  21:19
Yeah. Okay, good, all right. Well,

Speaker 2  21:24
yeah, right, Matt, once they're connected, once they're connected and zeroed out, yeah, because, because I'm this is because of where you're at right now, we can see everything if we show historical and show completed,

Speaker 4  21:38
oh, and then that's what's going to be, what stated and not?

Unknown Speaker  21:42
Yep. Okay, gotcha so,

Speaker 2  21:44
well, yeah, so, yeah. So if we go historical, remind me again or US of historical work orders and sales orders, what's the difference between historical sales orders and completed? Well, no, it is different.

Matthias Miller  22:05
So historical, everything, right?

Speaker 2  22:08
If I do complete it, let's see. I've never just done that.

Unknown Speaker  22:14
Wait, yeah, there's nothing every Wait,

Unknown Speaker  22:22
some of them.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
So are those the ones we should be well,

Unknown Speaker  22:26
Matt working, how are these showing up

Unknown Speaker  22:33
as completed?

Unknown Speaker  22:37
They're tied out.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
What was what's, what's

Speaker 5  22:44
you're saying they're tied to something, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:49
okay, well,

Matthias Miller  22:51
that one's not, because that one's black, but if you go up a row or down a row, we have, I mean, we're somewhere we got something tied out to it.

Speaker 2  23:02
Yeah, even if they're not, there's somewhere it got connected, whatever linked, or something, right? Yep, which just needs so, yeah. Anyway, reality is, if we do historical and historical, then we have these 16,000 got it all the way back to January 1 last year. Got it okay, and we were trying to clean up some of that stuff, but I'm not sure

Speaker 4  23:32
Okay, so we'll just need to work on it. Well, yeah.

Speaker 2  23:35
So what we did here, like, for example, we can do, we can do ACI four, no, no. If I do that, if I do historical, say, ACI four, it'll show everything at the bottom of ACI four, everything at the top right. And then Matt put in, like, the total. That was a sim. That's not a good example. I don't know Tina May, sorry if I run through this real quick. Yeah, here's historical a, l, o2, nine. I know some of these are still hanging out there. So here's everything. This is the most recent work order entry, going backwards to last year. Got it some yellow ones in there. Matthias yellow, again, was with notes. Or those are

Matthias Miller  24:26
warnings of some kind. If you hold your mouse over the status, it should tell you

Speaker 2  24:29
this work orders for a non stock item, yep, has items that were never signed to a sales order, which in this is the same anyways. So there's all that. But then you come down here, I can look at beginning of last year, 84 ordered. Wait, that's that's completed. Here's one that's not for it was due date,

Unknown Speaker  24:52
8484 well, it needs to be helped to some

Speaker 2  24:54
Well, it might have been canceled. Well, Matthias Oracle, if that was canceled, that should. Would echo away too. Should be, do

Matthias Miller  25:05
you see anything canceled it

Unknown Speaker  25:07
Well, Mike,

Speaker 2  25:11
I we'd have to look in. Can we look up? 752, 614, 75264, I was

Unknown Speaker  25:21
gonna put that was it, yeah, except 84

Speaker 2  25:26
on what date, 314, see what? It's just not. It wasn't recorded in assembly. Oh, okay, so for whatever reason, I mean, I like, here is,

Unknown Speaker  25:41
yeah, they're all there. But these

Speaker 2  25:43
are all the work orders are connected to a sage order. But for some reason, we didn't record that one. Yeah, there's 42 there's 84 there's a, you know, this is beginning end of last year, beginning of this year, which now I can get up into this neighborhood. And these weren't, never connected. This 110 were not connected ever. Here's, there's some that weren't connected. Like, did we do 83 or was it 84 here's, you know, they just weren't connected to anything. Got it. That's the kind of but again, not sure, not sure what we're going to do. But Matt put so now we have, since the beginning of last year, historical quantity assembled 6617, nice. Since the beginning of last year, quantity ordered 6762, now that's close. Yeah, you know what I mean. So at some point we may just say numbers close enough. Let's not worry about reconciling for the back. I I'm not sure okay, because it's just become, I don't know how to make it faster. Matt, do you?

Unknown Speaker  27:01
I mean, there's, yeah, anyway, sorry, yeah, that's a big question, but

Matthias Miller  27:07
you could conceivably put together a report that shows, well, that's by item that shows the total

Speaker 2  27:26
total was more than total ordered or total sold, total ship, total invoiced.

Matthias Miller  27:35
Yeah. I mean, it's effectively total.

Unknown Speaker  27:41
Is it for Yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:46
so the order, isn't it basically just this report, sure, but with instead of the full detail, just show the item code and the quantity. Any. I mean, we'll need the other shift column, obviously, but totaling the ordered and remaining needed,

Speaker 2  28:10
yeah, which, well, maybe not even, I don't know if you can, but like, here we have four orders for the next four weeks. It would be nice if we didn't total that, we would just say total invoice versus total assembled.

Matthias Miller  28:33
What would be the what would be the order date,

Speaker 2  28:41
current date, like, if the dude, if it's due in the future, if it's due in the future, don't, don't total that. If it's history, what's the historical amount ordered or shipped, and the historical amount assembled equally?

Unknown Speaker  29:03
Old, let's do this,

Speaker 2  29:04
which currently, if we have, if we did that,

Unknown Speaker  29:10
84 times.

Unknown Speaker  29:19
84 times 4336,

Speaker 2  29:24
that is interesting. So six, well, sorry, 6762, minus 336, so that's 6426 we're saying we assembled 66 seven, yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  29:39
this many needs, yeah, that's amazing,

Speaker 2  29:43
but that's because they weren't tied out.

Unknown Speaker  29:48
Yeah, you know,

Speaker 2  29:51
so remaining needed isn't really a good it doesn't, yeah, it's an indicator of how many are not tied out. Yeah. Time. So, yeah, Matt,

Matthias Miller  30:05
hang on. I want to. I want to. I got, I got, I got a this close to a,

Speaker 2  30:11
okay, you're good. So then Tina wasn't gonna say, oh yeah. Well, then

Speaker 4  30:20
you fall on the thread, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm actually learning that's just helping T

Speaker 2  30:25
Yeah, no, yeah, I'm sure. So again, the historical stuff, it doesn't affect like Incentive Program, which is the most important thing, and that's getting accurate data for each day right now, because it can affect the pay, right? It can affect their pay, um, and the way, yeah, in a way to do the way I want to the way we want to do that is just simply by making sure everything that's assembled gets entered and that it's attached to the correct

Unknown Speaker  31:07
order.

Unknown Speaker  31:12
And so

Speaker 2  31:16
Matt, if Matt can adjust the order form, or,

Unknown Speaker  31:23
well, that's historical.

Speaker 2  31:25
Order numbers, order amounts to change. If you can change them before John assembles them. That's awesome, right? If, if it happens

Unknown Speaker  31:36
after,

Unknown Speaker  31:40
well, you could still change it.

Speaker 4  31:41
I Yeah, I know you showed me one time, but I So, Matt, can I

Speaker 2  31:45
ask you a question on the side here, say, John, say there's an order for 500 and that's the sage order. John builds 400 because after the orders placed. We find out they only want 400 so we built 400 we enter 400 we tie it to the sage order. 400 to a 500 order. If Tina would then, after the fact, go into sage and change that 500 to 400 would that reflect on this program?

Matthias Miller  32:18
Yeah, as long as, as long as he didn't manually override the quantity, okay.

Speaker 4  32:26
So if I change it in sage, any at any point, it'll change on here.

Speaker 2  32:30
So yeah. So my point would be, yeah. So then if she changed it to 400 after he entered the work order, um, it would show, like, in this one, that would show total needed. 500 total assembled, 400 remaining. 100 day later, Tina goes into sage invoices, 400 would this numbers automatically update?

Unknown Speaker  32:52
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:54
okay, that's awesome.

Unknown Speaker  32:57
So then to do before invoice

Unknown Speaker  32:59
well, because

Matthias Miller  33:00
we'll make so that even, even if you end up shipping the wrong, I mean shipping a different number, well, once we start pulling it off, off the ship quantity, even if you change it after, after the fact, it'll still go away. Yeah, well, it'll go away or show up, whatever, whichever way it goes. Okay.

Speaker 4  33:21
All right. All right, yeah, I can do that. Okay, okay, all right. Hopefully, going forward, it'll make it a little bit easier to match up, because, believe it or not, there's a lot of changes.

Speaker 1  33:35
Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, so but yeah, yeah, okay.

Speaker 4  33:41
All right, I will do my part work on my end, on it, that's great. It's great. Yep, very good.

Matthias Miller  33:48
Can you pull up the Can you pull up your zoom? Chat or not?

Unknown Speaker  33:53
Chat or like, how? Like,

Matthias Miller  33:55
yeah, the chat in zoom. Do you see it?

Unknown Speaker  33:58
Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  34:01
Should I click?

Matthias Miller  34:02
Yeah, I put a link in there, if you want to

Unknown Speaker  34:06
click it, can I there?

Unknown Speaker  34:14
We go, continue. Okay,

Matthias Miller  34:18
okay, yeah, this. And then I can add this to the menu for you guys, and then you can click in to and actually we should change that a little bit, because we're going to want to when you click into it, we want to show the historical items as well.

Speaker 4  34:40
So he was just working on what you were asking him to work on that, and he just, bam, yep, bam.

Unknown Speaker  34:48
But nice. But man, this, yeah, is this?

Matthias Miller  34:55
So refresh at once. Okay, something? Now, let's say that you want to now click on, I don't know that AR, 0001,

Speaker 1  35:07
click on that link. No, here we go. Yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  35:11
It'll throw you right in and filter down by that item to drill into the details. Yeah. Is this something that would be useful to get an overview of where things are at and drill down into where things need to be cleaned up?

Speaker 2  35:29
Yes, it is what you you're not. It's not showing the it's not showing this total assembled in the total ship, though, right? Not at this point, not at this point, not yet, okay, but yeah, absolutely. So, yeah. So then we come in here, alphabetical. We start the top. I mean, we can see, I mean, if they're within 100 or whatever, if they're close in, in the quantity, the quantity shipped, or we can call it quantity invoice. What are we going to call let's way to decide what it is. It's the same thing. It is the same thing. I mean, for this conversation, it is shipped and invoice it at least it should be that quantity, plus the quantity assembled, yeah, remaining needed, that's fine too. Yeah, it can be, it can be all that, but the quantity assembled, you're well, yeah, you're taking that from

Unknown Speaker  36:31
the work orders.

Speaker 2  36:34
But then, and then Matt, as far as again, date range is going to be history up until yesterday. Or, how do you how are you going to

Matthias Miller  36:44
set that? It's anything up until anything due today. So if you want to in the title, you could go change your date, your as of date, to, you know, end of June or something,

Unknown Speaker  37:05
and change what, what date did you call

Matthias Miller  37:08
that? Click that right there. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:12
yeah. And that'll get, I mean,

Matthias Miller  37:14
that'll clear out the recent, you know, most of the recent mess. And be That's right around the time when we switched over.

Speaker 2  37:23
What is this as of meaning from that date till now? Or is it history? History, okay? Historical. Yeah. So there you go. So if I get well, is it it's not completed right now, right? So, no, that's definitely, that's definitely helpful, that will, that will be helpful. That'd be very helpful. Actually, some of that, some of that historical stuff, is just not hardly worth, well, may not be worth. All right, trying to take the two may be very pointless now, maybe not so much last year. Well, Matt, sorry, can we do a date range? Can I do like, easy that that would that would actually help if we could just do this year,

Matthias Miller  38:18
just a minimum due date, maximum due date. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:23
Yeah, I'd be very helpful, yeah,

Speaker 2  38:27
especially if I look at in the year and have a bonus pool or something like that, and I want to look at, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  38:36
yeah, I want to make sure, yeah,

Speaker 5  38:47
this year's accurate, more So than last year. Yeah, you can refresh. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  39:02
Okay. Yep,

Matthias Miller  39:04
you can change here. It's defaulting to this year. You'll see some changing numbers. If you go up there, you can

Speaker 1  39:13
right, right. That's good. That's great. It's great.

Unknown Speaker  39:22
Yeah, very helpful. If remaining needed is zero, try

Matthias Miller  39:32
to exclude those

Unknown Speaker  39:36
not well, maybe just highlight the rows that to highlight the rows that aren't Yeah, highlight the rows that are not same reconciled.

Matthias Miller  39:56
Can do, although it's a little complicated with how they um.

Speaker 2  40:00
What is any other? Any other ideas? I mean,

Matthias Miller  40:05
actually, hang on. No, no, we can do that. Here's how we do it.

Unknown Speaker  40:11
Well,

Unknown Speaker  40:12
yes, it could. What if we

Unknown Speaker  40:15
eliminate the zeros?

Matthias Miller  40:17
Yeah, what if we blank it out? If it's zero

Unknown Speaker  40:20
not actually, yeah. Otherwise I don't

Unknown Speaker  40:29
Yeah, because then you know what

Speaker 2  40:31
right to do, right? Otherwise, it's not really important to look at it right. So I think So Matt, I think if, if there's a zero balance, yeah, that should be good

Unknown Speaker  40:44
refresh,

Speaker 2  40:48
yeah. So we have just, you know, all the ones here. Does this show the lines? Matt, no, what?

Unknown Speaker  41:01
Alternating What's that you

Matthias Miller  41:04
want? Alternating row colors?

Speaker 2  41:07
No, so well, is that easy?

Matthias Miller  41:13
It's, it's, it is easy. It's that easy.

Speaker 4  41:20
Keep it, yeah, perfect. Kind of keep track of where you're at.

Matthias Miller  41:27
Too easy for Tina,

Speaker 2  41:29
can you make it, yeah, can you make it a little darker, just a little bit darker than that?

Unknown Speaker  41:35
Yes. Oh, now the lines are bottom for

Unknown Speaker  41:42
you. 48

Unknown Speaker  41:44
still along you run at that door.

Unknown Speaker  41:52
Crazy. Some of this stuff is but

Unknown Speaker  41:59
that's like bundle box and yes, actually, the 501 A is a board

Speaker 2  42:06
that's lumber. Yep, sorry, Matt, I'm I'm jumping out. But no, let me go back. Never mind. Let me refresh this.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
Yeah, it's beautiful.

Unknown Speaker  42:18
You say 501 A is boards.

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Yeah, I can't vibrate one down for Amanda earlier too,

Speaker 2  42:27
so she's gonna that's not turned on or whatever, whatever's Yeah, okay, Matt, good deal. All

Speaker 1  42:36
right. Too many other No, I don't have any questions. It's really thank you. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  42:42
I appreciate that. Yeah, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  42:47
Matthias bugging her for now.

Unknown Speaker  42:53
What we got 213,

Unknown Speaker  42:57
so do we have other

Unknown Speaker  43:01
must say, not remember,

Speaker 2  43:08
Matthias takes care of the discussion for I'm trying to think that's all we have for now, right?

Matthias Miller  43:17
Yeah, I'm working on the attachments. I'm waiting to hear back from one of my colleagues and what that takes to set up. I will need to make sure I sent an email

Unknown Speaker  43:32
attachment, sorry, as in,

Matthias Miller  43:38
so to be able to attach the

Unknown Speaker  43:41
prints to items.

Unknown Speaker  43:44
Oh, yeah, okay, yep.

Matthias Miller  43:47
So on my list, it's that it's getting the, do you want to call it invoice, the quantity invoiced or quantity shipped in here,

Unknown Speaker  44:02
invoiced? Because that, you know, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:15
I mean, that's,

Matthias Miller  44:20
that's, that's what we got on the current stuff, as it as it's as it sits

Unknown Speaker  44:24
now, yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:28
are there other big pieces we want to keep on the radar? Like,

Speaker 2  44:37
well, here's a here's an interest. Here. I gotta show you something, which you may have. So all customers, I'm going to go 111,

Speaker 5  44:51
24, until it's just going nine.

Speaker 5  45:13
Here's an interesting report. Actually, let me actually still have that from yesterday. Let me close it out.

Speaker 6  45:22
I that

Unknown Speaker  45:39
out

Speaker 2  45:42
so Matt, if I do, then I order by this score per hour.

Unknown Speaker  45:50
Holy cow,

Matthias Miller  45:54
we need to. I should take a look at speeding this up. It might not take much to speed up, especially if you're just, oh

Unknown Speaker  46:01
well, sure, but no,

Speaker 2  46:07
yeah, well, it's not terrible. I'm not complaining. Score per hour this range is it's Wait a minute

Matthias Miller  46:18
by item,

Unknown Speaker  46:19
hang on, what did I just do here?

Matthias Miller  46:30
Grouping by

Speaker 2  46:32
item, not score, not score. I want dollars. I want dollars per hour, dollars per hour generated right on the item, revenue per hour, revenue generated per hour. This range is phenomenal, like phenomenal, as in, not phenomenal, I don't know what. It's crazy, wide range. And there's not like, I mean, we have, we're hitting every it's we're hitting every quadrant on from,

Matthias Miller  47:08
how do we sell more wavy teams?

Speaker 2  47:13
Yeah, that's, we'll just sell those. That's it. I mean, and even, like, here's wave, but there's

Unknown Speaker  47:22
definitely down to the

Unknown Speaker  47:24
bottom. Oh, I know that's what's scary. I want

Matthias Miller  47:27
to you want to go find some. Go find some with high dollar values and low dollar per hour.

Speaker 2  47:33
Well, I got it. I got one right here. I was arguing with Rick yesterday about this one. NH, these guys pushed us on price. I didn't know he lowered this one so much. It's a 48 by 40 heavy stinking duty right here. We're getting, what's the price? We're generating 92 bucks an hour. We're selling it for $35 a piece, I think. And the things worth, oh my gosh, between 50 and $80 a piece. Yeah, my guys are working too slow. Like it's, it's a combination. It's, like, it's combination. It's biohydraulic stuff. He hasn't looked at this stuff for years. He just did the top 10 customers.

Matthias Miller  48:21
This is a fast way to get cash back in the business, like some of these. If you can't negotiate the price, just say we're not.

Speaker 2  48:28
I mean, we're not doing it anymore, exactly. Plus. So we just started that conversation. This is, I mean, it's

Matthias Miller  48:40
how many? Now, I don't know the answer to this, but how many Palace shops have access to this kind of stuff?

Speaker 2  48:47
Probably, I mean, yeah, I don't none. I don't know

Matthias Miller  48:51
that's does not seem to be very, very many.

Unknown Speaker  48:57
Yeah, I don't know, but

Matthias Miller  49:00
some of the bigger ones might but that this is good stuff, man, this

Unknown Speaker  49:03
is right.

Matthias Miller  49:07
36 looks pretty interesting.

Speaker 2  49:21
Look at some of these volume amounts and anyway,

Matthias Miller  49:24
almost makes you wonder if,

Unknown Speaker  49:32
yeah, exactly

Speaker 2  49:33
this low volume stuff is, I mean, this is a great tool for business management, you know, like these two being down here, then, well, Rick's question was like, Well, what should it be? And I was like, Well, I don't know. How do we find out? How do we figure it out? We take so. What? Okay, here's what. I didn't do hand work. You know, I say assembly method, hand work, and then just do those, and then figure out the average, right?

Matthias Miller  50:10
Well, I mean, you got to figure out, I mean, but what it should be is still a basic question. It's, what's your what's appropriate overhead assigned to it, what's material cost, what's an appropriate amount of time to get it done, and what's an appropriate profit margin on top?

Unknown Speaker  50:31
Yeah, so I mean this number over here.

Unknown Speaker  50:39
How do we? Well,

Speaker 2  50:42
this, this should be connected to pricing, I mean, like

Unknown Speaker  50:49
as reflection.

Matthias Miller  50:53
Well, that's where I think I'm not able to see my full way through what all this would give us. But I think that's part of the part of penguin. That's part of the reasons why having the price calculator in the head here would be, I don't feel like I have a clear path exactly what it would unlock, but it feels to me like, right? We'd be able to marry

Speaker 2  51:19
you. We have, we have his formula, right?

Matthias Miller  51:23
I don't think we ever got his spreadsheet. We decided we don't need it, but he offered to send it over.

Unknown Speaker  51:29
I had,

Unknown Speaker  51:32
you might have sent

Matthias Miller  51:35
it MERV to me has attachment.

Unknown Speaker  51:41
He might or not,

Unknown Speaker  51:45
calculator.

Unknown Speaker  51:47
I don't know that he did.

Speaker 2  51:49
Yeah, probably not. Well, I think I have it and, oh, I do have it, and then, no, I can get it. I mean, that's no problem. Um, I actually would love to see him use this program. And I think he's, I think that's, I think that's very possible here, especially since we looked at this, like seeing these numbers, was really I, I think it was really eye opening. Me asked the right question, what? What should it be? Well, that's good. And now, like, you know the to Rick's argument on that New Holland where I told you it's, we're 35 bucks an hour. We should probably be probably 70 or more. I don't know they're at least 50. And it was like, well, they contacted us last year and said, hey, they can get these. They said these items, they gave us the volumes, all their just, um, and said the price, whatever they said. They pushed and and we gave in. Well, so do we give in because outside pressure? Somebody else can make it cheaper, so we'll make it for that number. I guess that's some of the that's been that's been reality here in the past, but nobody talked about it. So Should that be your reality? Should you say, Okay, fine. Or should you like, well, we'll give in. Or should you say, and, sorry, we can't, you know, this is our this is it. This is our number, and take it or leave it. I mean, that's what you have. I mean, I would like to think that would be the way we should go forward.

Matthias Miller  53:37
Do we have a breakdown by customer? Because if, if you have a bunch of profit items, and they say, in order for us to for you guys to have our account, you guys need to be able to produce this thing at 35 bucks an hour, well that's a different conversation than saying, I mean, I'll bet you, if you did this by customer, you got some people that you straight up could just fire and and be happy, right or or force their hand like that, might almost be an easier conversation

Speaker 2  54:07
to say, I something. Would you say though, to

Matthias Miller  54:11
work on this report by customer and look at the look at the most, look at the customers are making the least amount of money on right, instead of by academic it could be that.

Matthias Miller  54:37
And then that would also give you at least some interesting

Matthias Miller  54:47
what was that? Which one was that one on that you found?

Speaker 1  54:53
What was that question? What was the was that New Holland on the bottom end?

Speaker 2  54:58
That one item was New Holland. Yeah, wait. Why is it giving me so many Okay, never mind. So, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  55:08
Sort,

Matthias Miller  55:26
I mean that right off the bat, it's very clear. Wave and Armstrong are excellent customers for you guys, right? Remney's Pretty good, but New Holland is one of your larger lower end,

Speaker 2  55:49
yeah, and that makes total sense, because where we at New Holland burger? Way down there, boys. Now that, excuse me, New Holland is handwork. But what's the matter of Fabre? Fabre should be higher man. That is sad, right there. Holy cow, I thought our pricing was off with fabro. Well, the guys are slow too. We're not. That's a, that's an assembly thing. Their stuff is taking too long. It is it? We're being really slow. We used to do their bundle blocks twice as fast as we do now, really.

Matthias Miller  56:32
Well, okay, fix, and I don't know how much, what kind of bump does that give you?

Unknown Speaker  56:38
What's that? So

Matthias Miller  56:40
what if you, if you do bundle blocks twice as fast, what does that do to overall production speed?

Speaker 2  56:47
Well, hang on, we have four that's the board feet.

Unknown Speaker  56:50
273,000 board feet.

Unknown Speaker  56:55
Chase.

Speaker 2  56:58
If we do, that's another interesting one to look at. Is it looking at the board fee versus dollars per hour generated like federal 273,000 board feet, $217,000 generated new hall and 623, 248, generate like, Oh, someone is like, the fabric pricing does not seem to be where it should be, yeah, but look at this new haul. I mean, their stuff is, I've been saying that for years. It's so complicated per board foot, we're not generating the revenue, then up here you have, where are we at the wood? That's some that's machine, some of that's hand, 464, to 326, I'm just not seeing consistent burger sums, machines, hand, 1,000,003

Unknown Speaker  58:03
three per hour.

Speaker 2  58:06
It's just not consistent. Now here's tow pan 139,000 board feet. We're generating 394, bucks an hour. How we doing that? You know? Yeah, here's, this is off the charts, 2,000,002.6 we're only generating 430 but the other thing is this the board fee and the total dollars of revenue clean energy. We're taking 110, making 2084,

Speaker 2  58:46
71 but we're only getting 430 Armstrong, 3.5 getting four.

Matthias Miller  58:54
So what is the dollar per board foot in practical business? Impact, day to day. Impact, what is dollar per board foot

Speaker 2  59:02
right now, our cost is about 55 cents.

Unknown Speaker  59:07
Okay?

Speaker 2  59:10
Um, wave. We're generating a lot more on the board footage than anything, than almost anybody else.

Matthias Miller  59:17
So Remy, Remy, you're doing about $1 a board foot. That's your lowest one. I threw this on as a column. I should add it to the Yeah, dollar per board foot, yep, column, because Remy is like,

Unknown Speaker  59:33
way down there. Yep.

Matthias Miller  59:38
So Matt, like three over three bucks clean energies up there.

Speaker 2  59:47
So we're not, we're not even talking about dollars per hour. We're talking about dollars per board, foot, right, right. Yes, that is a really good metric. This High Steel, 748, 793, that's, that's a low Iron Hill. We're doing really good. Burger, we're doing okay. Time Matt, we're doing awesome.

Speaker 5  1:00:16
Val, can't find one where we're not doing awesome constantly,

Speaker 2  1:00:24
would, or we're doing poorly. Ames Research on great on that one, small orders. Grief is borderline New Holland. I mean, New Holland is decent, but the guys are, they're just not, you know, if you really look at it board footage, but then I know there's other factors, like, how many fasteners, if we could, if I would straighten out that score calculator. Man, this makes me geek out. Isn't it awesome? Yeah, it is. Ah, I want to figure it out, man, I want to. I want a formula for every i want a formula for all of it, yeah?

Speaker 1  1:01:16
Um, yeah, it is so trying to look it up.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
So what are some of

Speaker 2  1:01:25
the fab roll two, that's really the thing. I mean, it's not so much tem CO, we're not doing good on that.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:40
These other ones, I don't see

Speaker 2  1:01:44
premier building, 11,000 board feet, $9,300 that's sad, right there? That's sad. That needs to look that big time. You know, those are the ones like, if we could look at that number, dollar generated per board foot. Then I'd say, I would, I would ask Rick to look at those prices first, the worst one, and work backwards, or work whatever

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
start by because you could actually, and this could actually be pretty useful one too, if you would run this first by customer, then by item, start with the worst customer first,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:25
that's right,

Matthias Miller  1:02:26
and then drill down into those this and I'm sure if you go into the worst customers, worst items, you're bound to have some things that are just

Speaker 2  1:02:37
That's Right. Bonkers, that's right. So we would look at, are you? Are you able to build in up four feet?

Matthias Miller  1:02:48
Yeah, I have it. I have it running locally here. I don't have a

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
okay, but

Matthias Miller  1:02:54
like the RW, the RW, i n t e, 1020, we're doing. We're doing 300,000 board feet at 44 cents

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
per board foot.

Matthias Miller  1:03:12
That's just one example, digging into it, and you really, if you just, if you just focused on anything under,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:18
where's that

Matthias Miller  1:03:21
here. Let me, let me. I'm gonna share my screen. I'm gonna take over.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:28
I gotta see that because I thought we were doing good on that.

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
Well, you gotta what I did is I did the analysis report subgroup by item.

Speaker 2  1:03:37
Oh, yeah, that's not here. That's Remy. It's just gonna be under Remy,

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
yeah, it's just under. It's just under Remy, or yeah, just do it actually filter by do customers, Remy, put Remy the customer,

Matthias Miller  1:03:56
straight up, straight up. Remy, yep. And then do, oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
I get rid of that now,

Matthias Miller  1:04:05
sorry, check it again, and then just click on the click there. There you go. And then the primary grouping. Change it to just group it by item.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16
Okay, assembly. Group it by item.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
Yeah, that's it, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:04:25
And then look at the right. Which one did I say? Inte, 1020

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
Yeah, that guy.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:39
2000 board feet. Ouch,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
holy moly,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
that's insane.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
Yeah, that's.

Speaker 1  1:05:02
Uh, wow, yeah, yeah, let me add the column, and you can have fun with it. All. Right, jeez, Rick's,

Speaker 5  1:05:16
Rick's got work to do. He's got work to do. You got Ernest,

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
who's, who's your best negotiator?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
Uh, probably, yeah, maybe him,

Speaker 1  1:05:29
probably him, yeah, all right. Why?

Matthias Miller  1:05:34
Because, I mean, you just want somebody who's good at,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
good at playing. Yes,

Speaker 5  1:05:40
he is good at it, sweet, yeah, no, I'd say so good, yeah. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
Let's go.

Speaker 2  1:05:50
Fun times, man, all right, buddy, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna check because, well, the other one, oh man, we're gonna, I was gonna say is, um, but let's list generator. Are you still with me here?

Speaker 2  1:06:10
Darn where am I at New orders? What am I doing wrong here? What are you looking for? I don't even know. Cut list generator. I guess we need to go to cut list or something like that. Um, how do we track? How do we track what the guys are cutting every day?

Matthias Miller  1:06:37
Well, as long as Is there any way we can? I mean, if

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
is okay, this when we mark complete,

Matthias Miller  1:06:49
yeah, it'll ask you for a date. So as long as George is putting in the right date, we're good.

Speaker 2  1:06:58
But he's not gonna have accurate he'll, he'll, he'll, he's going to mark complete every order that was finished. But at the end of the day, if there's a big order that wasn't finished, they're not going to get credit for it.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15
Is that right? Right?

Speaker 2  1:07:19
Which, you know, whatever it's neither here, well,

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
well, it is kind of, I mean, how much, how great you want your track in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:30
How accurate? Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:07:36
Well, I know on the gangs all, on the sizers, we're not performing. These guys need a marker. They need some markers. They need some goals, man. So really it comes down to how many board feet, not even well, board feet isn't really fair, but if you go by feet per minute, like linear feet per minute ran through the gang. Saw which you can get that because, you know how many cans and what length. So you just say, Here's how many cans that this length was, it ran through today. So now we know how many linear feet like, that's probably the best way to track that. Um, I would still like to, I mean, we do have the board footage. I would like to track board footage on the other on the side. Well, when I say track board footage, I would like to track the board footage that was cut in a complete like that was completed. So I don't know that gets so it's so new. It's a longer conversation than we have right now.

Matthias Miller  1:08:54
I feel like we should block out. I feel like, well, I don't know. I don't know who it should be. I don't know if you and Rick need to have the conversation first, because half of this seems to me like business process.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:10
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:09:11
And then the other half is, how do we so? Question number one, what's the meaningful metric to track? Question number two is, how do we get accurate reporting based on man hours put in, if that's what it is, or is it just across the team, and how do we get them to report it back into the office? And then once we have those down, then the question is, well, how do we get it in there, and how do we report on it? But the first two are the big those. The first two, have to be solved before we get too deep into this conversation here.

Speaker 2  1:09:45
Yeah, the metrics to track, sawing, tracking. The reality is, right now I don't have to have it for incentives. So I don't have to have it. It's just more of an. Individual thing, which doesn't make a difference for the end of this year? Well, right? No, not really it. Well, man, I could. Is it meaningful? Would

Matthias Miller  1:10:12
it be meaningful to track performance on an individual basis?

Speaker 2  1:10:18
Yeah, but that's that's layered, like that's layers. The gang saw linear feet per day. That's a big one. Now I could have these guys figure that out. I mean, it ran, then it run a couple pages a day. So I could have some Amanda every day. Just tally up, Tally up, Tally up and say, here's what we're doing. The way to do it in here would be, you know, Jenner, what is the sizers? Brewer schedule. Here's Brewer schedule. So am I going to get there? Yeah, basically take this 530 Wait, what went on? 17, three and a half, 17 times, 14 feet. They finished it. Now the reality is, they might have, they might not need an extra one, so they might have cut 18. So that's not going to show up in this, currently in the program, but that would be a good metric for the gang saws. The rest of the stuff, the rest of the guys out there, not that hard to but the gang saws are the ones where we're not producing right now. And it comes down to linear feet per day or per hour. Ran through that saw linear feet per day, basically what it comes down to.

Matthias Miller  1:11:50
Could we put a column off somewhere? I don't know if we have room for it, but off to the right for linear feet on the schedule.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
Sure. Which, yeah. I mean, we could put, well,

Speaker 2  1:12:15
there's a lot, yeah. I mean, I like to eventually, I like to show, here's a linear feet for this job. And it should only take 10 minutes, you know?

Matthias Miller  1:12:29
Well, I mean, if we, and that's not hard to if you didn't come up with with a linear feet per minute, that's not hard to do,

Speaker 2  1:12:37
no, and that should be about, that should be sprayed 50 to 70.

Matthias Miller  1:12:44
So you, I mean, you could set it up as a range. So

Speaker 2  1:12:49
first we need to start tracking what we're actually doing now, right? But no, if we would, if we would print, if we would show linear feet here in this row, the row next to the cant number, the three and ample six, four, like, yeah, this white row here. Is there anything else that ends up in here, like notes or anything?

Matthias Miller  1:13:13
Let me take a look,

Speaker 2  1:13:15
because if not, That's where we need to put it. I um,

Matthias Miller  1:14:08
okay, so We have

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
waste.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:37
Can't just them.

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
I mean, there is, I don't think there's anything beyond what's there,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
yeah,

Speaker 2  1:14:50
well, if we could, like, create a little space here, off the or put it on the end, like,

Matthias Miller  1:14:59
Yeah, I can't. I can't easily put it off the end, but we could. We could leave just a, like a half inch space or something, and or inch space, and just, and then just show number of linear feet,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:11
yep,

Speaker 2  1:15:12
for that job, we'll start tracking on our on the back. We'll start tracking here. So yeah, we have to, all right, yeah, that's sawing, tracking. But the main thing, yeah, we're hitting the main things. So the other, I mean, pricing, yeah, we,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:42
we did. It, would it will keep,

Speaker 2  1:15:45
you know, again, I don't know what you're I mean, if you continue to be available, as you have been, where we can keep jumping in this thing that's that's great, I can keep piecing it together. He'll miss in and having conversations and watch people's minds shift, mindsets shift, and

Unknown Speaker  1:16:07
yep, work with me, and

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
it was cool to see Tina like

Unknown Speaker  1:16:14
he did all that while you were while we were talking.

Speaker 2  1:16:18
Yep, that got her excited. That was like, that was cool, man, that's good stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:16:25
That's good I agree. I agree, once they start realizing what all this stuff gives them, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:33
yeah, right, and Right, right. I mean, these are individuals that

Speaker 2  1:16:41
they don't really have to be motivated to, but I think they do, and they realize it like they're getting paid well and stuff like that. So just thank God everybody's not pushing back. Of course, I had a lot of push. There's been plenty of pushback already, but

Matthias Miller  1:17:04
I don't know. Well, I think, I think part of the answer to the pushback, in my opinion, we, we've gotten tons of pushback in lots of different places, and yeah, pushback changes once people start seeing everybody destroy Okay, the world is so full of sales people and visionaries that can't deliver, and the way to shut people up is to give them to execute on things that make their life better. And some of it is just kind of like change. And is this actually going to happen, or is this just big talk? I had a very interesting conversation with a guy this morning who works in the roofing industry. And his whole thing is, he says research shows that there's two factors. The two biggest factors for high performance are come down to, how do they think and how do they feel, and 99% Well, 99% of roofing companies, much less. I mean, I don't know if it's other companies are much better. Never track anything along those lines, and never do anything about that kind of stuff. And he says it's like pulling teeth to to get owners to look at this stuff. But he says when they do, like, leadership issues start clearing up, and they start hitting momentum. And people, people need to feel like they belong, and it's amazing what they'll do when they feel it, and it's amazing what they'll do when they don't

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
feel it. So, Yep, cool.

Speaker 2  1:18:40
All right, so on the sewing tracking, you said, what was the meaningful metrics to track? Also, what was your second question,

Matthias Miller  1:18:47
how are we going to get the information back from the from the team out there on what actually

Speaker 2  1:18:53
happened? Yeah, and that's, yeah, we get it back. I mean, I can answer that somewhat, but it's a, they take their paper and they write down their quantities at the and then return the paper into the day, which that's a process we've kind of been doing already. So yup. Partials, yeah, figured out,

Matthias Miller  1:19:15
yeah. Partials, like, I mean, even just a 50% we got 50% done on this day, 50% done on the next day, or something like that, that we can track, I don't know, right?

Speaker 2  1:19:24
There has to be a can't be as complicated as assembly, right? I mean, no, Holy Days,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:31
no, we don't.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:32
We don't have to be that accurate.

Matthias Miller  1:19:37
Well, and especially, yes, and even, even if you have a daily view and a weekly view, like the weekly view, like you're under for a day, if you do a partial, you'll be under for a day and over the next hopefully,

Speaker 1  1:19:49
right? So, right, yeah, yeah, it's, it's not going to be, yeah. So our.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Right. Very good man. Thank you,

Speaker 6  1:20:03
sir. Yes, you bet Thanks. We'll talk.

Speaker 2  1:20:07
We'll talk soon. Nate, and you're you're still doing, you're finishing up that assembly tracker window. Just shoot me an email or text when, when that's done, or I might dive into stuff a little bit tomorrow. I'm not sure yet.

Matthias Miller  1:20:26
I can, I can get the column added, and I can add that new report that we put together for Tina to the menu, the the ship quantity, the invoice quantities, is going to take a little bit more time. That's a more

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
complicated be right there, all

Speaker 2  1:20:43
right, yeah, well, then yeah, just, that's fine. I'm not pushing. I'm just saying, yeah, perfect, thanks, man. Yeah, you bet.
