Unknown Speaker  01:07
Ah, howdy, howdy, howdy,

Matthias Miller  01:09
howdy, howdy, howdy, howdy. Why

Unknown Speaker  01:13
can you hear me anything? Oh, because I heard my volume turned out. How about

Matthias Miller  01:19
now. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  01:23
look at you zooming me so close. That's so weird.

Unknown Speaker  01:36
What the world

Matthias Miller  01:38
just decent when you don't want to

Matthias Miller  01:48
mark What's your email,

Unknown Speaker  01:51
when What

Unknown Speaker  01:58
I feel I feel like I feel like

Speaker 1  02:03
this panic has set in, like we haven't done any development this week on only, and I'm like, I feel like we're like, completely shirking our project here.

Matthias Miller  02:17
I just because I couldn't bear not to have anything happen with it. I spent 15 minutes specking out the enough for Sean to do the mock up of the accounting impact settings.

Speaker 1  02:34
Okay, this, this video settings have got to change this, this, zooming around of the camera is weird. Where is my video settings?

Matthias Miller  02:46
Did you get new headphones? I did. I don't know if I like them or not, but it was cheaper than the other ones. They are airplane, cockpit. Is it weird?

Speaker 1  02:58
Auto framing. Turn it off. There we go. No more auto framing. Where's Mark and Company?

Matthias Miller  03:04
He just sent a the NC transition announcement. So I don't know if he's busy doing that or what he's showing up. You didn't answer my my headphone question, what now my headphone. Is it? Does it sound weird? It looks tacky, but does it sound weird? No, it doesn't sound weird. Okay, just for those moments where I can't bear standing and staying in front of my computer, I need to walk around. Yeah. Are they wireless? They are, but I want to find something less bulky. Hey guys, Seth is finishing up his breakfast at a late breakfast in Pennsylvania, apparently. So he'll be here in a minute. Couple minutes.

Speaker 2  03:58
Okay, um, well, well, then I'm going to wait. I just send out some notes, the some some changes that happened or are happening here at the NC transition announcement notes, some changes with vinyl structures.

Unknown Speaker  04:16
But I suggest we wait to cover that till Seth's here. Cool, and just jump in with

Speaker 2  04:29
projects that. Well, what do you think Matthias, we just start with projects on the list. And if it's something where we need Seth, we'll just circle back.

Matthias Miller  04:39
He's He's hopping on now so we can,

Unknown Speaker  04:52
whoa, we're hitting something.

Matthias Miller  04:59
I. Let's do all incidents, and let's do by priority, sorted by title.

Unknown Speaker  05:15
All right.

Speaker 2  05:19
Matthias, did you want to look at your your notes first on those few simple changes on prioritization? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  05:27
So my thought was, if we could, if we could add and Seth, maybe take note if we'd add an open incidents to the menu that would open, do open incidents by priority, and if we would have a way to filter assignee down to you and me, like a multi select for assignee, then we could much more easily, we could basically use that for our here. Let's do this. I Yes,

Matthias Miller  06:13
that doesn't look right, though that's not all of them. Would it be you? Mark? Would I guess it might be mark and drew as well.

Speaker 2  06:25
Uh, possibly, I know there's one on the list today, that, or Dwayne's dssigny as well.

Matthias Miller  06:33
It might be that this guy, um, Dwayne. I mean, the other option too is we have these.

Matthias Miller  06:56
We do have these type, types and tags that we could use here. Well, I think usually, usually we keep them assigned to We usually keep them assigned to us. If it's,

Speaker 2  07:21
yeah, we just like, there's one, I think that's been assigned to Dwayne now, which is the wholesale dealer one for casting. And,

Unknown Speaker  07:34
okay, well, why do we have, why do we have two wholesale dealer ones?

Matthias Miller  07:40
One is for one

Speaker 3  07:43
was specifically nine and one was the overarching job. I think, no, oh, there's something Josh wants you to review.

Unknown Speaker  07:58
Oh, this should well, you want an update on this thing? This is funny.

Speaker 1  08:09
Yesterday. Yesterday, we yanked all the restrictions, backed out again because of major problems with billing records again. So it is

Matthias Miller  08:22
read your life. Ah,

Speaker 1  08:23
kind of the imagery I got when from the last message from Josh was him yanking his hair out and throwing his hands in the air and going, this is, this is no end of trouble. So it was, it's been troublesome.

Unknown Speaker  08:43
So what does that mean for Well, we, I don't

Speaker 1  08:46
know what it means yet. I need to, I need to follow up with him and see where he wants to go from here. But it has. We had all kinds of fun duplications of Lot buildings on dealer portal, on retail dealer portal. We they were seeing both the original and the RET building

Matthias Miller  09:04
and right around the corner. It's

Speaker 1  09:06
just been the building record side, restriction side of this has been a nightmare. Everything else is pretty straightforward. The building record side is, is the nightmare?

Unknown Speaker  09:17
So Matthias, sorry, we kind of signed sidetracked. You here.

Speaker 2  09:25
Keep going with what you're you're suggesting on how we use this to prioritize.

Matthias Miller  09:30
Well, I mean, a simple thing would be if we would give a way to filter by multiple assignees, and we could just choose Dwayne Matthias Seth, when we pull up this report and

Speaker 2  09:41
well, and also, Josh already has a user report that allows that I always use. I'm not sure where it is, but it's in my

Unknown Speaker  09:51
I got it. I'll send it to you one second

Unknown Speaker  09:55
repeat to standardize such

Matthias Miller  09:59
things. You. It.

Unknown Speaker  10:02
Did you standardize? Standardized reports are so yesterday?

Matthias Miller  10:08
Why? Why? Why create order when you can create chaos? That's right, right? But this isn't, oh, yeah, it does. Okay. So it's Dwayne Seth Matthias, open priority

Unknown Speaker  10:26
for this list and just sort it by Isle or Newton.

Speaker 4  10:33
When Mark looks at the list, he says, yep, that's all of them. And the rest of us see this list with a whole bunch more stuff in it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  10:45
Why create order when you can create chaos? I like that.

Speaker 2  10:49
I had to think of Ella's story of where he used vehicles to like the bus was your off the shelf, software like a you. QuickBooks or something where it's cheap, easy, but you go wherever the bus goes. Spreadsheets, Excel is like a motorcycle or quick, fast, fun, easy to drive. You can go fast with them, but they're also dangerous, and you can't hold loads or whatever, and then the pickup truck was the custom software. So I think that, using that analogy, I think user reports are probably the motorcycle.

Matthias Miller  11:36
Usually are the motorcycle?

Speaker 1  11:38
Well, not quite, they're not quite a motorcycle. They're, they're kind of like these, these Bombardier came out with this, this particular vehicle where it's like, it's got two wheels in the front and one wheel in the back. It's, it's user reports are more like, I don't know what they call those things, but yeah, whatever they call them. Polaris came then Polaris got really smart and came out with kind of like a car version of it. So yeah, user reports are like that. They're a little bit like

Matthias Miller  12:07
this. That's what user reports are like. You might you might fall out, sometimes you might get dragged out and mugged, or you might just weed through traffic. I mean, it's all part of the adventure. Okay, so there's now a sort by title checkbox. Because, why not? Because why not? At least

Unknown Speaker  12:35
somebody, somebody's always welcome to go off and make this thing a standard.

Matthias Miller  12:38
Well, I mean, that's, that's what I was pushing for, something like, whatever we changed here. I don't know about Lowe's visible priority. I don't know. Anyway, I'm happy and Steph can I'm happy if Seth wants to complain, do we just want to work through this? Okay, how do you want to just work top to bottom out of this one?

Unknown Speaker  13:04
Yeah, I think so. So

Matthias Miller  13:09
this is in Dwayne's court. Let's, let's do this

Unknown Speaker  13:14
sort of in Dwayne's court.

Matthias Miller  13:20
Let's do that standardized user reports. Can we prioritize this one? Is it a paper cut nine or something?

Unknown Speaker  13:30
Yeah,

Speaker 4  13:32
no, I would put it lower than that. I mean, we should probably assign it to somebody else. Like, well, I guess it's the same to you.

Matthias Miller  13:44
Obviously it's the set.

Unknown Speaker  13:48
I mean, because it's going through some things,

Matthias Miller  13:51
no, or is it, it's well, I mean, I think we start with, we can all handle it on our calls. Get list of favorites from user profiles, find ones in personal folders. Review with put together lists for Drew slash mark to delete any they don't want. It's actually just this one, and

Matthias Miller  14:32
this can be so this could be delegated to nickhias.

Unknown Speaker  14:38
Add to that to your list there. Add Aaron to that list as well.

Unknown Speaker  14:55
Overcut day i.

Matthias Miller  15:09
Okay. Reporting discrepancies. This one was there an email says, go ahead.

Speaker 3  15:16
Can't we do? Can we do a catalog Rename from a user report to a standard report, so we redirect there

Matthias Miller  15:23
potentially, or should we not?

Matthias Miller  15:34
I don't know. I mean, how much work to say, sorry, these don't break, and if you want to keep using the report, here's where you find it. I mean, I think if it's on the menu, I would actually argue that it's better just to get it off the menu rather than having favorites. I'm low on compassion this morning.

Speaker 4  15:50
So does so if it's in our favorites and it's not actually report anymore, does it? Does it? Is there any notification there? Or do you just have to open it?

Matthias Miller  16:02
When you open it, it'll, it'll tell you, it can't, it doesn't exist.

Unknown Speaker  16:09
Yeah,

Speaker 2  16:10
I like that approach. Is it that that'll be the fastest way to clean things up?

Matthias Miller  16:16
Well, if you search for we'll see we will send you an email. We'll keep you in the loop. We're training you. We're training you away from conflict avoidance so basic problems head on. It's good for business. Shoot, was there an email sent about the about this? And if there was, I missed, I missed it.

Speaker 2  16:43
I don't know. I mean, a lot of these, I think a lot of these. All of us got busy since our last call and had other things going on. So I know, I don't know that there was

Matthias Miller  16:57
okay. So let me, let me start making a list of things that I need to, I need to specifically Chase,

Speaker 2  17:11
make shock to my does the comment make sense, or the Drew's note make sense? Or do we? Do we have a is there a clear resolution, how we overcome this.

Matthias Miller  17:23
Okay, so stripe payment dated. The payout is dated on the fourth so basically, the payment was recorded after the payout, right? I mean, isn't the right thing to have? I

Matthias Miller  17:45
mean, if you really want to do it right, wouldn't the right thing be to pull stripe dates in from stripe? I mean, I think the right thing is maybe just to go, go, here, hang on, we could easily, why not just write the in the discrepancy report? Couldn't we show anytime the payment is on or after the payout date?

Speaker 4  18:15
Well, that was, that was some of my question is, is the dating the reason for the issue? I mean, create the difference illogical dating. I understand that,

Matthias Miller  18:29
all right, but Well, I could look at it now, or we can look at it separately. If there's sufficient information, I can look at it later, if you want to take time on the

Speaker 1  18:38
call now, I don't mind Matthias. I'd be, I'd be interested and see if you deleted the payment and re imported if it fixed the date issue. Because Josh did on on admin importing of payments. He did he is sucking in the correct date based on the stripe transaction.

Unknown Speaker  18:55
Was this man done manually? Dwayne, if it says,

Unknown Speaker  18:59
it says link from admin page. So it's kind of odd.

Unknown Speaker  19:10
Did I change it?

Matthias Miller  19:13
Then it is here. It says 2626,

Unknown Speaker  19:17
yeah, I might have changed it,

Speaker 1  19:20
but you're saying, you're saying that the payout record is saying two, four,

Speaker 4  19:27
yeah, the payout, the payout was before the payment was received, according to the dates, which is not going to happen. But I mean, at least not any process.

Speaker 1  19:40
Matthias copy that stripe. I The payout stripe ID passed to me. I'm gonna go look it up. Yeah.

Speaker 2  19:54
But is this only happening when, when they're doing it? Mainly. Way when it's not being done through the typical stripe process.

Matthias Miller  20:09
Well, when did, when did Josh fix the date setting from the admin page linking? Was that that

Speaker 1  20:13
was a little that was a little while ago, February, ish, yeah. Probably

Matthias Miller  20:22
be. Because this is, this is the day that it was put in. It's dated for the date it was added.

Speaker 1  20:29
So this is probably pre when he fixed it. Hence, hence, the reason I said we, we should probably just go reapply the transaction and it would probably redate it.

Speaker 2  20:44
Sales Order wasn't so did they take a payment on the quote? If it happened on the fourth like the sales, the sales,

Speaker 1  20:53
hang on. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go clear this payment and re push it in. I

Speaker 4  21:04
So you're thinking that the dating situation is the reason for the problem with the report.

Matthias Miller  21:09
Yeah, I would. Well, I mean, let's do that first. Seems very plausible. And deposited payments. Okay, so this one, well, either way, we know it's wrong, so let's fix what's wrong. Then let's okay. So this on,

Speaker 1  21:35
okay, refresh your sales order. It's now coming in as two, three, but

Matthias Miller  21:42
the strike fee is too is 1020 weird, that's wrong.

Unknown Speaker  21:50
Today's date.

Speaker 1  21:52
Well, hang on, I'll just override it. How about that? Okay, refresh, okay,

Matthias Miller  21:57
somebody should tell Josh to fix that, though. I

Matthias Miller  22:04
Who's doing that mark?

Speaker 1  22:09
Can you slap it on your list of things to discuss on, uh, on a Wednesday morning?

Matthias Miller  22:17
Okay, so then that,

Unknown Speaker  22:20
um, yeah,

Speaker 4  22:24
if you, if you write a credit card line and don't add another fee line same date, it will pull the old fee rebate for the old fee of the new new one you wrote. So like, if there was a credit card line and a fee and then they refund the credit card or something, you write another credit card line. And if you don't write another fee line, it will, it will steal the fee line from the from the earlier transaction, and it will push it through as dated with the second one. So

Matthias Miller  23:04
so we're using the payout date, which technically isn't the payment date, but whatever.

Speaker 4  23:21
Well we had the issue of those two dates, and I think that's been resolved, because there's most of these discrepancies have gone away. Where it takes, okay, we got payment date and we got payout date. You know, if we're talking undeposited funds, it's coming in on one and going out on the other.

Matthias Miller  23:42
I mean, do we care about similar types of issues?

Unknown Speaker  23:47
There are more like this, yeah.

Matthias Miller  23:55
I mean, it would be a trying to think if we have, do we have A deposit payments. So payment date

Matthias Miller  24:16
here, let's do this.

Speaker 3  24:48
I'll just use this report and not the well the user aging report and not the standard one

Matthias Miller  24:58
we're trying to fix. So we. Make it standard, because,

Speaker 3  25:01
like, I just made some changes with that for wholesale dealer portal with how we're doing. That's why, that is why we don't have user reports for long times, because now we're gonna have to resolve the differences between the two and figure out if they're intentional

Speaker 2  25:17
or not. But I think the Drew is correct. Me, if I'm wrong, I think the undeposited funds report, the version you're using to do your audit, is still a user report that we're that's the one that's referenced in the incident here, that we're hoping to take live as soon as it or to standardize. I mean, are we at a point where we I guess that's what Matthias,

Speaker 4  25:38
yeah, the standard report has got issues that we've already fixed in this

Speaker 2  25:43
one thing, the standard report, if I remember correctly from this morning, does not allow you to enter a an as of D,

Speaker 4  25:49
yeah, that's one. So all you need to do Seth is just copy your changes on that one over to this one and standardize this and just five clicks,

Unknown Speaker  26:04
something like that. Yeah, I'm just trying to save you all money.

Unknown Speaker  26:13
Are you in sales?

Unknown Speaker  26:17
He is not in sales. He is the king of boring code. Self, admittedly,

Matthias Miller  26:29
wait, I got this backwards and the payout date. Wait, payment date, I'm so confused if the payout date is greater than the payment date, but the payment dates, 10, five,

Unknown Speaker  26:50
no less than is what you want,

Matthias Miller  26:55
right? The payout date, wow.

Unknown Speaker  27:00
I mean for the problem ones. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  27:02
it's for the problem ones. Just

Matthias Miller  27:10
think of it like an alligator. The alligator wants to eat the bigger one. Okay? And probably only for Julie. Care about 2025 right? Is

Speaker 2  27:36
that? How you remember the greater and less than is an alligator or

Speaker 4  27:39
what, yeah, or a bird or whatever. It's a mouse that wants to eat the bigger one.

Matthias Miller  27:43
That's what I was taught in school. I mean, here's, here's the ones to clean up. And I think it's,

Speaker 4  27:59
it sure didn't seem like there were that many discrepancies, though.

Matthias Miller  28:04
Well, if they're all within the same month or then you're probably not going to find it.

Speaker 4  28:13
Oh, okay, no, it's unless I pull a date, do a comparison on a date in between the

Unknown Speaker  28:21
payout,

Speaker 4  28:22
yeah, yeah. So if I were to split all 200 days or whatever, then I would have found them.

Matthias Miller  28:33
Okay, well, there's, there's that. One's also, it's a little here. Let's Change this as well, because

Matthias Miller  29:01
there we go. All right, good. And if

Unknown Speaker  29:13
so, you just gonna so

Unknown Speaker  29:17
we're just ready to try it out again, I guess.

Matthias Miller  29:20
I mean, I think so. I mean, the we think, the the

Matthias Miller  29:27
aging report, we didn't, for sure, confirm with 100% accuracy, all we said was, all I said was, we know it's wrong. So why wouldn't we just fix it? But we would expect, oh,

Speaker 4  29:50
so the report's not calculating for those. We're needing those to be fixed, and then we just block people from being able. To do such a thing.

Matthias Miller  30:02
Well, I mean, it should just happen automatically, like we should never strike payment should be recorded automatically on the proper date.

Unknown Speaker  30:10
Operative word being should,

Speaker 4  30:14
yeah, nothing is automatic. When it comes from the seat, it's

Speaker 3  30:18
like we should have the proper permissions and smaller user folders.

Matthias Miller  30:24
I mean, yeah, basically, we're checking to see if the payout was before the as of date. So yes, there is reason why this didn't work. We're looking at the payout date on whether it should be the payment is undeposited, and if you paid it out prior to the payment date,

Speaker 2  30:45
then So, so what do we like? Does this require some manual cleanup from drew on these drew or Dwayne on these that are where the dates are switched are wrong, and then it more long term fix from Josh on on this,

Matthias Miller  31:04
I would, that's what I would say.

Speaker 2  31:07
So does, but does can drew see these on the report. Now, the ones what that are wrong.

Matthias Miller  31:13
I gave him a report where you can see him okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:16
and you're clear on what?

Speaker 4  31:18
Yeah, except if this is something that Dwayne can just say, Okay, on these items, we need to re import the proper

Speaker 1  31:30
Wow, no can. Or is that actually, actually, can we just, does it tell us the proper date that it's supposed to be? Can you report payout date? Just use the payout date and we just stomp the payout date in on the on the rows, okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:46
then you have that other column editable

Matthias Miller  31:49
here. Let's, let's see this. All right, fine. How easy do

Speaker 1  31:57
you want your life? I wanted to. I wanted a link action that just copies it over. I know,

Matthias Miller  32:01
but then you have to find the right RG row to do it. And I'm lazy, and Mark claims he's got stuff he wants to get to in this call. I don't know what he's talking about. I mean, if you wouldn't, anyway, there you go. That's if you can't find somebody in your office to copy paste things across and hit the save button, I will. I've got people in mind that can do it for you,

Unknown Speaker  32:30
virtual people or real people.

Matthias Miller  32:33
Yeah, I might turn my AI assistant loose on it. Honestly, I might screw it up.

Speaker 2  32:39
But is that who's taking care of this Drew, are you or is it Dwayne? I don't care. Just drew

Unknown Speaker  32:48
somehow. I think it's gonna get delegated

Unknown Speaker  32:50
to me. Fine.

Unknown Speaker  32:52
I don't I don't care. I don't care. Either way.

Unknown Speaker  32:55
You know what you need to do. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:58
okay, just stomping the right date. And

Unknown Speaker  33:00
then I've got a note to bring this up to Josh. So good.

Unknown Speaker  33:04
Yep, okay, save

Unknown Speaker  33:10
customer deposits from work. Let

Matthias Miller  33:15
me make sure you guys can actually read this.

Unknown Speaker  33:21
I think we were close to being done on this.

Matthias Miller  33:26
Yeah, these are a bunch of things to chase. And I would Oh, again, we could look into it on the call. In the interest of time. It seems like there's enough information that we could chase it offline and get back to you.

Speaker 2  33:38
But okay, let's look at it real quick, though, especially the quote there, so

Matthias Miller  33:46
creates a difference.

Unknown Speaker  33:48
So, okay, first question, why? Why can you even

Matthias Miller  33:53
right? I

Speaker 2  33:54
think we should, okay, we've sinned to correct as we've invoiced it, and it's all good. But Dwayne, I'm curious what your thoughts are on. How do we block this from happening in the future? It seems to me like you should, shouldn't even be allowed to make a payment on a quote, or turn a sales order back into a quote if it has a payment, apply it to it.

Speaker 1  34:17
Well, your latter suggestion would would restrict us heavily from being able to edit buildings post actual order. So let's not do that.

Unknown Speaker  34:29
What do you mean? I'm just saying if you have a quote, so no if you have a sales order.

Speaker 1  34:36
With changing a sales order back into a quote is the way that you actually go and edit a building post, post, it actually being so you can, you can, if you put it back in quote mode, you can, you can push it back into the configurator, make changes the building and re update everything. Oh, okay, so here's I want to go about that. But I mean, there might be other ways that we can force you to resolve a quote a building with. They with with money on it.

Matthias Miller  35:02
From an accounting perspective, there's no problem. We just, we just said, We don't want quotes to affect accounting. We could let quotes affect accounting, and then if you get money, your balance is still zero, like you shouldn't. It's probably a bad idea.

Speaker 2  35:17
But, well, what would it do to AR? Like, it would, would that make AR go negative? I mean, which, if you

Matthias Miller  35:27
actually got a payment on a quote, then that's real. I mean, well,

Unknown Speaker  35:29
well, it is. I'm wondering

Speaker 2  35:32
if that might be the Do you see a problem with that truth?

Speaker 4  35:35
Well, I mean, my first thought was the payment. RG, really should, like, that's real accounting data, that that should be hitting accounting if we want to allow it on a quote that you know, that's a different discussion. But from the accounting side of the work, if we just let the RG, the payment RG, hit accounting,

Unknown Speaker  35:56
that the payment side is the only thing that would would affect accounting, right?

Speaker 4  36:04
I mean, it's not invoice. So we don't have, we don't have income, we don't have cost of goods, okay, which is same as sales

Speaker 2  36:13
order, exactly, same in sales order, right? Right? Exactly. Let's do that. I think that's yeah,

Speaker 1  36:19
Matthias, can you either send me the URL to this sales order or tell me what, what? Whatchamacallit you're in, which, which bowling.

Speaker 2  36:26
It's the one that was, was infamous for not being able to be retrieved because of jailing fans and pit bulls and, wow,

Speaker 1  36:44
but what's Well, I want to go. I want to figure out the story on why it's hanging out with dollar values on it. Who? Who done it?

Speaker 2  36:53
It's the link down here. 2502714, I

Unknown Speaker  37:04
it's not a quote anymore.

Unknown Speaker  37:07
We've since invoiced it, which is Drew. Do you have something to add to these other two?

Speaker 4  37:17
Um, so the other two items that I have there, I the accounting transactions look like they match what the payment RGS say. So I don't know why they're not showing the same thing

Speaker 1  37:33
before we before we leave this sales. Or I do have, I think there is worthy of a conversation on this, because it looks like the dealer took a payment on a quote directly from directly from the if you go up to next row up, that's where the payment transaction took place. And it's same timeframe as Kelly white in putting the so I think one of the ways that we could limit this in some way, is that you cannot take a payment on a quote.

Matthias Miller  38:07
That's what Mark was saying earlier. That's a Josh that's a Josh conversation. Yeah, I'll add it to the list for

Unknown Speaker  38:15
but if, if I don't want to

Speaker 1  38:18
restrict a sales order from being turned back into a quote that has money on it, that has other implications, but like, if it's a quote, the the all the URLs down at the bottom to disappear, you shouldn't be able to add money to it.

Speaker 2  38:35
Okay, so Matthias fixed would take care of the situation. Were somebody to turn a sales order back into a quote with a payment. But in your suggestion on blocking a payment on a quote initially would should limit it to almost nothing.

Speaker 1  38:53
Okay, so if it's if it's a quote, it really should like adding our G rows should disappear. All the all the payment links at the bottom, if it's in quote, Those should all just disappear. So you cannot do it from a quote. It's not going to limit everything in this regard, because if you have money left on a sales order, you can turn it back into a quote. You still have the same issue. But at least we could limit it from somebody taking money on a quote,

Speaker 4  39:19
but with Matthias fix of pushing quotes to accounting. Would fix that if somebody turns it back and quote and lets it

Speaker 1  39:26
sit there, understood, yeah, yep,

Unknown Speaker  39:29
got it. Sounds good. Trudy,

Unknown Speaker  39:32
you have something on these other two Well,

Speaker 4  39:35
I mean, we could just look at it. I don't know if you'd have a way of looking at them saying, Why is the report? What's the report saying with these items, and why?

Matthias Miller  39:46
Because it's a difference. What's the date? Is the big thing I'm missing. What's the date of the balance sheet that you're looking at?

Speaker 4  39:53
Um, so I don't know that I nailed down. That exactly like, I just pull them by chunks, so like, say, the end of the month. And then, if it's different, how much ever much has changed? The two changed till the next month.

Matthias Miller  40:12
So you look for deltas between, like, would this be between beginning and end of April or end of March, end of April,

Speaker 4  40:22
right? So, yeah, my end of April came up with that being the difference. And if I can find a transaction with that amount, then I go for it. If not, I keep whittling it down so I can find, you know, per day, where's the transaction that's making causing this. I um, so there's, there's three charges and two returns.

Speaker 2  40:48
We're only getting four here, so these are just searing each other out here.

Matthias Miller  40:52
On here, let's, let's start by right. So we would expect to see another chart, two charges on here, right?

Unknown Speaker  41:04
No, there's one more charge

Matthias Miller  41:07
for total of three refunds and two chart. I'm sorry there's one more charge, right? Well, let's, let's figure out which one's not showing up. Then we have, we have of the sorry invoice payment, we have 789, and 11, 789789,

Matthias Miller  41:40
there's two on seven. Second one on seven isn't one of them on seventh is not showing up.

Matthias Miller  41:58
Sales Order payment rows, rows for sales order.

Matthias Miller  42:07
I mean, I still don't think, I don't think It's so if we

Matthias Miller  42:35
okay, we'll chase it. Customer deposits. We were, um, discrepancies for FGI.

Speaker 2  42:50
I think this is done. There's all the way at the bottom. There's, well,

Matthias Miller  42:54
did you, did you see this about the $0 transactions?

Unknown Speaker  43:02
Uh, no. So that okay, I need to do that. Were

Unknown Speaker  43:12
you making these notes true? That's me.

Speaker 2  43:20
Bold type your name and date. So Matthias, no, I did not see that with some line items, blank values.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
Hey,

Matthias Miller  43:39
if I So, here is the wow. This one's not. We took these changes live.

Matthias Miller  43:57
So basically here on the building built, removing it from FGI to finished goods, and it nets zero, but that's necessary to move it. But I'm not sure if that's what you were referring to in your comment.

Unknown Speaker  44:19
No, I think what I was referring to is we had some, we had some that had

Speaker 2  44:30
the variance was zero, and we were referencing more lines, I Think, on all of that. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  44:40
this is we're, I think we're good.

Unknown Speaker  44:47
There was, oh yeah, down at the very bottom, I think those notes.

Matthias Miller  44:56
So we had added a setting to be able to exclude. Buildings from accounting impact. I think I don't know if it was pull barns or I don't know what the idea was way back. We're not using it. Can we just any objection to just removing

Speaker 2  45:07
that? Well, how do we okay, we still have some. It wasn't for cricket Valley owned buildings coming back into inventory, coming back and dealer selling them. That was what it was for, like, setting like, how do you exclude those buildings? Was it based on the builder or just on a we're

Matthias Miller  45:35
not or, I don't know how we are

Speaker 3  45:37
used it, it's on the accounting company subset, you can specify what's

Matthias Miller  45:43
an example of one of those buildings, or how would I find one?

Speaker 2  45:46
If you search for builder, picket, ballet, rent a shed.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
Okay?

Speaker 2  46:07
But, I mean, I think it could have the the only reason i i think it could have some value trying to think, how are we keeping those out of when do you know, how are we? We're just showing them so ideal to complete them, to sell them, and run them through the sales.

Speaker 1  46:26
Yeah, we swap out the builder, which I think it has no, it has no correlating company in in in accounting,

Speaker 2  46:33
and we also, I think we put in a an FDI value of zero,

Matthias Miller  46:40
right? But these are all

Unknown Speaker  46:45
okay, but that that one,

Matthias Miller  46:48
and then we cancel the

Unknown Speaker  46:58
so do we show in

Matthias Miller  47:07
Bob built. The most recent one is in 2023

Speaker 1  47:15
No, I wouldn't look at the built. I would. I would look at the sales, order sale, if you want to look at one that's actually sold back out again, you would, you would want to look for the so order date being in this side of this year, which you'd have To, you'd have to write some additional subset for you.

Matthias Miller  47:43
Yeah, right, but

Speaker 2  47:46
Okay, so like that one, there's no finished goods caused on that one, I think. Is that how we're made? Yeah, because it's it did not. Basically we're just giving permission to cricket valley to put their building on our lot to to sell it. Right? We're buying it.

Matthias Miller  48:06
So, I mean, you could, going forward, treat it as a non manufactured building, if you wanted

Unknown Speaker  48:14
to, but that would want to link it to in invoice when you

Matthias Miller  48:18
just do a zero, that's true. You could. I don't know the best way to do it, but

Speaker 2  48:24
I guess back to your question or your comment on that's not wouldn't fit the bill for what we're like, we had a saying exclusive bill from the county impact. I don't know why we mean, I'm puzzled as to what we intended to do with that unless it was no those also have a

Matthias Miller  48:52
let's, we haven't used it in two years.

Speaker 2  48:55
Okay, then I'm sure you can take it up or remove it. So what else are you you have everything you need on this then to complete this. Or Is there questions you have for me?

Matthias Miller  49:10
I mean, as long as I mean, I responded to anything. I don't think there's anything you know Drew if you want to explain yourself here, but I think we're good.

Unknown Speaker  49:19
So, yeah, that was pretty poor. I'm not even sure

Speaker 2  49:22
what it means. Seth comment down towards the bottom where it says, Do we need any of the cogs columns anymore?

Matthias Miller  49:28
I think Seth and I will take a look. I don't think we do. We had this fancy logic for how variances get calculated. I don't think we need it anymore. But Seth and I will take a look,

Speaker 2  49:39
and we'll get back to you. Nothing's getting nothing's changing. Then on how we calculate, like raw materials, or how we calculate cause actual cost being applied and stuff, then that the intent is that there wouldn't.

Matthias Miller  49:55
The intent was that we would that we would review there's a slight change. Change in logic, but very, very few changes in actual like, I think, as I recall, we looked at all the changes and then and said, we're happy with, we're happy with what happened. Good.

Speaker 2  50:16
It just it made me nervous if we change that, all that fancy work that happens when you say $500,000 worth of materials for this month. But, yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  50:27
No, that logic is all the same. The only thing that is affected is how it shows up in accounting.

Unknown Speaker  50:33
Got it good.

Matthias Miller  50:35
I am confused, though, why this isn't do we? Do we take these changes live Seth, we did, didn't we?

Speaker 3  50:46
I think so. Okay, good. What? What was the incident?

Matthias Miller  50:53
727, yeah, 727, right? Yes, 727,

Matthias Miller  51:07
wholesale dealer, Portal, Dwayne.

Speaker 2  51:12
Is this something we should look at? Well, okay, this has to do with being able to apply payments. I think,

Unknown Speaker  51:19
I think a little bit of an update from Seth, would

Speaker 3  51:23
be good. The Is this the wholesale reporter? Yep, yeah, I think I have it pretty much ready now. I was cranking away at it this week, so we'll need an update. But I have a standard, some changes to the deposit record and the reports, and then an X 30 list to create payments.

Speaker 2  51:49
I thought there was a note for me that. Oh, question for Joe, can we have default cash bank? Is that? Do you still have questions on that? Or is that the result?

Matthias Miller  52:01
Yeah, our plan is to there's a bunch of places where we use primary checking. We set primary checking like Stripe payout account, etc. But currently you can't, it's so it's a long story, but we're going to let you select Primary checking is a default cash bank account, which is going to

Speaker 2  52:25
help life. And the only Okay, where do we? Do we on the wholesale dealer portal. Do we allow them to select, well, they would need to select how they're paying. I mean, everybody's paying with either ACH or a paper check. What have we ever talk,

Speaker 2  52:47
the bigger ones are always paid by ACH. And is that what you build it for? I mean, if so, well, I guess what would be the there really wouldn't be any difference with

Matthias Miller  52:57
Well, the difference is, Do you are you waiting for an ACH or for a check. I mean, that's the difference,

Speaker 2  53:02
but, but how are you going to allow them to select What's your when they go to apply payments? Was your? Thought they would just

Matthias Miller  53:14
apply the good

Speaker 3  53:17
another checkbox to the payment method? No.

Matthias Miller  53:21
What I would do is Seth, mute you. I'm gonna mute you as host. I would say, let's just add a drop list to say, Do you want to ask them for the check number? They wouldn't. They might not know at that point yet.

Speaker 2  53:42
Wouldn't it, I guess you don't know what the check number you're paying, right, right?

Unknown Speaker  53:50
But when it but

Speaker 4  53:51
in their books? Well, they're not actually like paying in this thing, are they? They're just saying, here's the payment we're sending you. Yeah, so then they shouldn't, well, I don't know, it depends how their system is, you know,

Speaker 2  54:09
I'd be okay starting out just, they just say, whether it's check or ACH, we, we can put the check number in when we deposit that.

Matthias Miller  54:21
Oh, just add an Ask prompt and put it for check versus ACH and put it in the memo. Okay, but

Unknown Speaker  54:30
it won't be required to do well.

Matthias Miller  54:34
I mean, they'll need to tell us how we're paying. I mean, I suppose we could give them another option. I don't know which Miller is.

Speaker 2  54:39
I'm saying the payment method is required, but we're not requiring a check number for them to

Matthias Miller  54:45
right, okay, I don't think we need to ask them for it.

Speaker 4  54:52
So if the method is a check, there's not going to be a deposit created. Is there? Yeah. How's that going to work? Because if Jr receives their check and Joe Smith's check and puts them in the bank at the same time, then the deposit's not going to match.

Matthias Miller  55:15
Well, how do you do it now?

Speaker 4  55:20
Well, I mean, it would be, basically, there'd be a payment created, and then whatever payments go together, is what hits the is the deposit.

Matthias Miller  55:30
Oh, so you would merge Joe and what's his name's into one deposit record. Yeah.

Speaker 4  55:37
I mean, because you can just add the like, they all get reported as separate payments, and then whatever payments got deposited at the same time get selected at that sales order payments list.

Matthias Miller  55:50
We can give you an option to merge deposits.

Unknown Speaker  55:56
Yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  55:57
it's hard for the dealer,

Unknown Speaker  56:04
because they won't know what the other others are.

Speaker 2  56:07
But Matthias, you're explain again, your thought on creating like a It's not not a complete deposit, but them applying payment, they're creating 80 deposits. Like, where does that deposit? Say non deposited? An approval process. On our side, it

Speaker 3  56:30
goes into the standard undeposited, undeposited payments, aging report with a nice grouping and everything.

Matthias Miller  56:38
Really, it doesn't, it doesn't hit accounting. It

Speaker 3  56:40
will. It won't hit a county until the date is filled in. We don't set the date on these guys, and there's a dealer, a new dealer field that gets set.

Speaker 2  56:51
Okay, so they'll show up in undeposited, the standard under standard undeposited

Speaker 3  56:57
for now. I mean, we can update the user report or make take the user report standard.

Speaker 2  57:03
Then all that needs to happen is, when we receive verification of that payment is to go there, complete it. You just open the deposit, enter the date and the

Speaker 4  57:14
so they'll basically be deposits with no date. If you would look in the deposit like go to the report of deposits when you see it,

Speaker 3  57:24
not by if you run it with the default ask props, no,

Unknown Speaker  57:29
okay, because that would be correct. I mean, that's okay.

Speaker 3  57:33
I think, I don't think I asked anyone about this, but I added astrops that we could show them if we wanted to. Yeah, have an optional dealer and then a checkbox to include pending dealer deposits.

Speaker 2  57:49
Good, you've, you're steps ahead of us on thinking this through. So, good.

Matthias Miller  57:53
So I, I mean, can we? I think the the alternative is just obviously, well, so we can't merge deposits. I think the alternative is, well, you can literally just fill out a second deposit slip for these things and have them hit the bank account. Or you can have create a headache for Drew. Or we can have this, this back corner only been used once in an entire lifetime, multi so payments that have been wanting to kill off, and we can say, well, we can't kill that off. Actually,

Speaker 2  58:28
I think this situation is going to happen infrequently enough that if it does happen, the option is you, either you open one, you can, you can copy all the information off of the deposit record that the dealer, wholesale dealer, created, and put it onto your include it with the other the new deposit record you're you're creating for, like your all of your other checks you have. Or you can, you could add your other checks to the dealer's deposit. You can do this, well miscellaneous. Or you could, like, if this were a dealer, one, put it

Unknown Speaker  59:14
in there.

Matthias Miller  59:16
Well, your other deposit is going to be on the same date for the same amount, so it'll just, well, I don't know wherever you want to put it. Find some place, but, but

Speaker 2  59:25
you just put it, you just add additional sales order payments. Wouldn't you? Like? What would you No,

Matthias Miller  59:29
because you can't do that because, because the dealers can see this,

Unknown Speaker  59:33
doesn't see what their deposit,

Matthias Miller  59:37
or can dealers see their deposits? If they're not pending? Do?

Speaker 3  59:44
As it right now they can't, but we could make so they can't, but then it's confusing, because then they should, I mean, I think they should, should be able to

Speaker 1  59:51
hold on a second dealers don't currently have visibility to deposit records, which brings up a whole nother conversation about restriction stuff that Josh has been working. On and how to handle that, this deposit thing, so that you can't go spinning through deposits.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
So you can't what?

Speaker 1  1:00:06
So you can't we're gonna have to figure out how to restrict the deposit record as well, so that you can't use the the the address bar in order to find other deposit records.

Speaker 3  1:00:16
It they can only, they can't edit interactively. They can create one with the import process, which sets the dealer, and then they can only view new records or ones have the link dealer.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:27
So you're saying they won't be able to see this record.

Speaker 3  1:00:34
No, they could see the record, but it's linked to the dealer, so only if they have that dealer, yeah, that,

Speaker 1  1:00:47
I think so until, until I until we test and make sure that, yeah, I don't, not that I'm doubting. You. Seth, I have been around this, this restriction thing, has been a nightmare and a headache.

Speaker 3  1:01:00
So, oh, I know that's why it's taken me over a literal day of work.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
Gotcha okay.

Speaker 4  1:01:07
So why do we have them? I mean, I'm I'm behind. Why do we have them seeing or creating deposits instead of payments?

Matthias Miller  1:01:20
Because when it comes to grouping these, because we said most of them, when we had this discussion originally, we said most of them are going to be paid by Ach, and that's currently the process that we're using, and it's very simple to just create basically a pending, unconfirmed deposit, versus having a yet another record, which is a multi sales order payment record that then that thing has to get linked to deposits. So you have to trace all the way from deposit to the multi sales order payment back to the to the payment record. And I wanted to avoid the complexity of the multi sales order payments,

Speaker 4  1:02:01
right? I mean because, I mean on the ACH payment method, yes, because, if they're pushing an ACH, essentially, they're, they are doing the depositing. But as a vendor, I mean, as us being as a customer, whether we deposit it or what we do with the money, is they don't care. They just want to know if they paid us. So that's why I'm thinking, if we were creating payment records, we wouldn't have to worry about whether the deposit that we create when they send a check actually matches whatever they did if we added more stuff in or didn't. So I'm just thinking if the if they select that they're paying by check, it would create the multi sales order payment, which would put one payment in our payment list. Or when somebody that receives a check says, oh, let's deposit this thing goes in, oh, yeah, here's this payment. And they just make a deposit like normal, but then you're kind of requiring to do two things, create a deposit when they select Pay By ACH and create multi sales order payment when they select pay by check. But so since that's kind of what the reality of what actually happens that you know, it might be worth trying to model that, but maybe it's too much work

Matthias Miller  1:03:34
for that. If we're worried about reflecting reality, let's not give them the ability to see any deposits. Let's just report on sales order payments for their dealership that share the share the same deposit ID, and group them together and show that to them. And you could do whatever the you jolly well please with the deposit record, as long as all their payments are together in the same same deposit record. It just works. So if you were later. So if you were

Speaker 3  1:04:06
going to say something, idea of needing to create multi so payments and deposits and report off of both of them,

Matthias Miller  1:04:13
like how often, how many dealers pay by check and by and how often

Unknown Speaker  1:04:19
that yeah,

Speaker 4  1:04:22
that I don't know. I mean, there's, there's some that always do, I think, and some that never do. It's most.

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
So how do we handle it right now?

Speaker 4  1:04:36
Marks out a little bit if the there anything like from a multi sales order record saying this one was an ACH, so therefore, just go ahead and automatically push the deposit. Create the deposit.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 4  1:04:56
Where you'd be creating multi sales order records for all of. Them, the ones that are selecting Ach, you just automatically recreate the deposit and the others you wouldn't.

Matthias Miller  1:05:07
Could we? Yes, I'm making, I'm very making a very determined argument that it's undue complexity. And I, I am being very stubborn here. And AM, and maybe you just need to hit me on a on a different day. I'm, I'm concerned about the level of complexity that that introduces. Yeah, I just from looking at, okay, first of all, let's start with the layers of complexity. What is the most complex part of accounting impact? Number one is sales orders. Sales Orders are already night marryingly complicated when it comes to accounting impact, we've tried to simplify it. We try to we still need to document. It probably won't happen because we're moving on to other things. That's my cynical Thursday morning thing, but, but the reality is that if I were to go on a long vacation, then Seth would, I mean, he would definitely figure it out. I have no doubt that he would. He would just have a nightmare of a time figuring out and wrapping his head around everything. And it would be a very, very painful experience. So I'm trying to manage that complexity and adding multi so payments increases that complexity, unless we can come up with a different way to do multi so payments that whereby we can simplify it. So that's the second most complex piece, is buildings, FGI related stuff, all the other stuff in the system, vendor invoices, all the other stuff. Pos, get a little complicated vendors and vendor invoices and POS get a little bit complicated, but it's way more manageable deposits, brain dead simple, so go ahead.

Speaker 2  1:06:52
Well, I was thinking, why do we even show okay, we still let them create the deposit, but as long as our wholesale dealers can see the total of what they're paying on that day, and we just not show them the deposit at all. And then we just leave all these deposits editable. In the case where we want to merge, like they pay by check, and we want to add things instead of whoever's creating deposit record, instead of starting from with a brand new deposit. They just open this one and say, Oh, this one's being here's one that started already for the $70,000 check. And we just add our things to it and keep going like, is it, am I missing something? Or could it be that simple?

Matthias Miller  1:07:32
We just, yeah, where it's not that simple is, if you've got two dealers, I'm assuming these dealers don't actually have that many. I mean, if you're paying by check, they're probably not buying, you know, 30 buildings, but maybe I'm wrong, or you pick the bigger one of the two, it might mean that if, if you're depositing two, then you have to go undo the one deposit and move them over to the other deposit. If we change our reporting in the on the on the dealer portal to report on sales or repayments, doesn't matter, like they're only going to see their own their own stuff.

Speaker 2  1:08:03
Doesn't matter. That would be a great I think that would be quite beautiful.

Speaker 4  1:08:09
And we're just showing them. Hey, you made a payment on this building, this building, this building, this building,

Matthias Miller  1:08:15
and so on. We're going to say you paid for this lump of buildings together, basically. And here's the total,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28
that's what they're going to be concerned about anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:08:30
right? Exactly. And

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38
did they ever pay twice in the same day like to pay for a few in the morning and a few in the afternoon.

Speaker 2  1:08:48
We wasted no no, it? It? Maybe it has happened once or twice where somebody gave us two checks. But I mean, there you do the same thing. You just you're thinking from applying the payments, how that would look for a

Speaker 3  1:09:11
now I'm trying to figure out how we'd make that work. Do you just plop it all on do you just create a deposit for the day for the dealer? Well, I guess not for the day. We don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
I think it's well,

Speaker 4  1:09:39
you don't have an entry record or something that's happening when they when they do it?

Speaker 3  1:09:46
Well, I was using the deposit when they could, and when they could actually see deposits. That made a lot of sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:55
Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:00
Okay, well, I'll make a concession potentially. So that's holding holding his breath. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
what if we would eliminate the multi so record, but basically flag payments, sales, order payments as always going with each other.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:43
It sounded like some sort of dating game.

Matthias Miller  1:10:46
It's a very polygamous dating game. The way some of these buildings go,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
payments are going steady,

Matthias Miller  1:10:55
going steady.

Speaker 4  1:11:00
In other words, if you select one to deposit it you they all will go along. Or how's that?

Matthias Miller  1:11:11
I guess, so it gets a little, gets a little daisy to enforce. On our end,

Speaker 2  1:11:17
I would be comfortable just taking the route of saying we don't expect more than one payment.

Speaker 2  1:11:30
Well, as soon as we do that, we'll get ourselves into trouble. I think it's gonna say I'm I would be comfortable with saying we don't expect them, expect anybody, to issue more than one payment. Per day.

Matthias Miller  1:11:45
I have an idea. I kind of hate it, but I kind of love it. We are going to have our multi so payments is going to be a new order with the total of the multi so payment. And we're going to have a process by which we create reversals payments on all of those that zero out and and like it's, it's just going to be a, I don't know what the payment type is for all of these guys. We are going to add a line here that says, with the amount, the balance amount, and the payment method is going to be, I don't know what, and it's going to say paid in, and it's going to have the the so Id of wherever it was paid. And then we're going to create a sales order for the grand total of all the payments.

Matthias Miller  1:12:50
And what's going to have. It's going to have a negative line item for each of the and then a final payment with the total payment that's due by whatever method it gets paid. So

Unknown Speaker  1:13:25
I know that sounds complex to me. I was

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
going to ask for it in English.

Speaker 4  1:13:31
I the sales order for this big fat payment. The whole thing is just going to zero, like, it's going to be a zero sales order because, because all the negatives of the little payments

Matthias Miller  1:13:42
that go out, I'm sorry that's not true. It won't be negative. You can't do negative payments. You have to have, I don't know what it ends up being. Does it go on miscellaneous items?

Speaker 4  1:14:07
Well, those, the accounting is not going to work for putting it there.

Matthias Miller  1:14:12
Yeah, well, it'll be the same account that that the negative payment is coming from on i

Matthias Miller  1:14:23
on the original sales order. This account has to match the this account has to match the same account that gets used on the for the payment for the multi sales order, payment method on the on the individual sales order.

Speaker 4  1:14:41
So the pay, the fancy payment method to use is going to hit an income account, theoretically, and then the big fat, non existent building, you know, the combination. So you. Post to that same income account,

Matthias Miller  1:15:06
something like that. I don't care what account it is

Speaker 4  1:15:08
you're basically saying, Don't count all these other things as income. Count this one as income

Matthias Miller  1:15:14
and or as sales, well, or, okay, here's the plain English version, customer comes in and says, I have a big fat stack of sales orders I want to pay for. Oh, okay, let me go ahead and just give you one, like one simple sales order to pay for. Okay, great. So then it's basically a and then we have a process by which to do that, through payments, through payments.

Speaker 2  1:15:47
Well, okay, maybe this isn't I'm concerned that we're making it more complex than what we actually needed. Could we do the could we say if, if you, if a dealer pays by Ach, then we do the deposits thing. If they don't, if they pay by check, all we do is we just apply the payments and when that check comes in, we'll have a method of communication, and we'll just say, Hey, if you get this $80,000 check, go look, we could figure that out on the stuff. We can just rate it. I mean, can we do that?

Matthias Miller  1:16:22
Yep, so Seth, basically you wouldn't create a deposit record, except for Ach,

Speaker 4  1:16:33
Don you still have that issue of where do you pull the record from to show them what payments

Matthias Miller  1:16:40
you would group by payment date and payment method. Why

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
are you making a distinction on ACH?

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
Because we already know what. We already know the money's coming in. I suppose you could leave that be a manual. Let that be a manual process. Okay?

Speaker 2  1:16:56
We could start out with with all of this being manual. I guess that just, just have them apply the payments. We create the positive record. We just start with that. I mean, if you get a check, or if you get an ACH for 80,000 we people will happily link up the correct sales orders and, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:17:19
Well, there's no at the point of them entering these payments. There's no distinction whether it's ACH or check or cash or or credit well, not credit card, but any one of those, it's like they're basically saying we are putting a payment on this that we say that we're doing until we there's money in the bank account. It's no difference whether it's ACH or anything else.

Speaker 4  1:17:42
Yeah, the only difference is, if you're actually having a deposit created from that, and if you're not doing that, then we just need to know there's payment, or they're saying they're a bit

Matthias Miller  1:17:54
All right, so we get next deposit record. Everybody's

Unknown Speaker  1:17:58
happy, except for Seth, who did all the work already?

Speaker 2  1:18:01
Well, I wouldn't throw it away. I think step two, we could possibly get to that or start using that. But I think step one we should just do the payments.

Matthias Miller  1:18:11
And there's literally, if you like, the workflow, it's literally coded. We could do this just for ACH and only for ACH and and you could have the automation right away if you wanted to, and if you don't, we don't need to.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
Well, why not? Why don't we? Why not? You see any problems with that?

Speaker 4  1:18:42
I would say for the ACH, yeah, do it. I mean, if it's there, if it's there in coded, do it. I just thought that that Seth was having some issues being able to produce a report, but you're saying you can just take that payment report by, you know the payments they say they're they're making, and the date and say these were together. Is that how you're coming up with their report of what payments they've made for them?

Speaker 3  1:19:14
You're saying only report on payment sales are payment rows, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:18
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

Speaker 1  1:19:22
Maybe I'm missing something. I still don't understand why we're making a distinction on ACH. The only

Matthias Miller  1:19:27
distinction for ACH is we already did the work. It's super easy. The dealer's already saying who, what they're paying for.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
How's that so check,

Matthias Miller  1:19:37
because it's coming in as a single bank transaction, and it's the bank is going to show that, whereas a check, we're going to deposit with a bunch of other stuff and and we went, we want the deposit record to match, actually, what shows up in the bank.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
Yes, amen,

Speaker 1  1:19:53
pardon my being slow. I'm tracking now. It's all good.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
Your note here, let's not. A deposit regular for Ach, is that your

Matthias Miller  1:20:02
Wow, I'm half my brains half off, and I turned the wrong half off.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
This could basically be turned live with Josh. Next update,

Matthias Miller  1:20:27
you're muted. I need to do

Speaker 3  1:20:29
a little bit of work now that we changed it. But yeah, I think so

Speaker 2  1:20:33
okay, because one of our wholesale dealers is new wholesale dealer, Amish district is hounding us for when he can get into this. I don't

Speaker 3  1:20:44
Dwayne maybe had some concerns on restricted data yet. Is that

Speaker 1  1:20:48
right? It's, it sounded like you had resolved those.

Speaker 3  1:20:54
I mean, I was what were, what was not working for you all,

Speaker 1  1:20:58
or you're talking about the record restrictions for, like, buildings and sales. Yeah, I need to fight that with Josh. It's the record restrictions is overriding. Funny, that a restrictions overriding something else inside of for lot buildings and some of it's some of it's, yeah, and it's building records have been problematic because you you both need to be able to write to them, see inventory from them, write other stuff to them, and yet, you know, a lot, building has no distinction about who it's actually assigned to, so it's hard to determine, you know, There's, yes, there's, there's a sales orders are easy. Transit tasks are easy. Electronic RTO contract records are easy. Building records are problematic and sense at some point I have this, had this feeling that Josh may throw up his hands and say, We're just not going to restrict them. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:22:08
so Matthias, I think the income statement, there's nothing. I think we've got that no one we need the next one, same way, the improved Seth and I looked at that, nothing to do there, that one needs work from my side, so I that's where that one's still if we jump down to the sales or the I don't think it's worth looking at 17 and 18 there. But yeah, sales tax, yeah, reporting issue, I think that's what do you believe that's done?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
I think it's been resolved. But yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
can we close it?

Speaker 2  1:22:41
Well, the, I mean, are those the nightly X 30 in the schedule? That's all done?

Speaker 3  1:22:46
Yeah, I think those are all running. Okay, I should

Speaker 4  1:22:50
double check, but pretty sure there's a, there's a new report, something about missed items or something on the menu, and every company, everything that I've looked for, it's always showing zero, so I'm just or that there's no items. So is this as of this current period or something? Well, maybe it's now that we're in a new month.

Speaker 3  1:23:13
So this would be if you go to File sales tax, yeah. And because we run the report nightly now, so it would be if you probably won't need it, but if no, okay, what would happen is, if you're going to file sale facts and you notice that, like a I don't know, a jurisdiction is wrong, you go update that, then you'd have to run this to

Speaker 4  1:23:48
so it would be, it should be stuff that would need to be posted to a period that's stated in some prior period, like, like the one for 225, there, West Virginia, makes sense.

Speaker 3  1:24:05
This will by default. This is showing all of them. There's an Ask prompt. You can set the max date that you want to show you say you're filing for September. You could put 930 well, okay, there. Okay. So if you're filing for September, then you'd want to say you were filing for September, I can't words, September today, then you'd want to resolve that top one there.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:33
But this will automatically,

Speaker 3  1:24:35
will automatically run that tonight. It's just that if there'd be a change the day that you're doing sales tax, and you know that you want to update, then you need to go there. Got it,

Matthias Miller  1:24:45
got it right? Because Vanessa updated, I mean, she hit the ping thing. So it's not up to date, even though it's,

Speaker 4  1:24:56
yeah, so it's basically just changes from today. It is what it's showing essentially, yeah, because yesterday's changes would have updated last night. Yeah, great, okay. Makes sense. Makes sense.

Speaker 2  1:25:15
Cross linking. I think there's a lot of back and forth on that Seth, you have everything you we need on that, right? Or other further questions.

Speaker 3  1:25:30
Um, you were emailing Dwayne and I about and I think you all are just, instead of the links Nick added, you're just wanting a report for all of them in the tree.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:42
Yeah, okay, I just need a lot of comment there.

Speaker 2  1:25:52
So yeah, that one, oh, there's a note here. We wanted to wait till retrievals were done. This retrievals have now been done. So I think we should be good to go to complete this.

Matthias Miller  1:26:11
Unedible, interactively, sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
So is, is that pretty straightforward? Seth, or you have,

Speaker 3  1:26:23
yeah, I mean, that's one I can probably give to Sean or nick

Speaker 2  1:26:28
the next, I don't think the others are worth covering. I mean, those are all some that we've had looked at before. So good if time allows. I'd still like to look at two things next week or the next meeting, and then also just the NC transition notes, if, unless somebody has other

Unknown Speaker  1:26:58
development items to look at. I It's fine, good. So the

Speaker 2  1:27:07
16th, we've already confirmed, okay, the 16th, I believe we've already confirmed the 30th. Just wanted to see if that works for everyone.

Matthias Miller  1:27:16
It's up in the air. Dwayne. Dwayne's the one. Dwayne's the one flying in the air, keeping dates in the air. We can if, as long as you're comfortable, I don't mind putting it in tentatively. I'd like to avoid firmly, 100% firmly committing to it.

Speaker 2  1:27:42
I would, what about the 24th or the 23rd I'd rather just, if that works for everyone, just lock that date in.

Matthias Miller  1:27:58
Again, I

Matthias Miller  1:28:05
uh, I know either the 23rd or 30th is going to work. I don't know which one I'm happy to black out both of them and then we cancel the one that we don't need. It. Just coordination.

Speaker 1  1:28:19
I'm causing Matthias misery right now.

Speaker 2  1:28:24
And why don't we plan for the 23rd then if that doesn't work, we'll try for the perfect

Matthias Miller  1:28:29
but I like it.

Speaker 1  1:28:33
We We have a fairly large client on the only side that potentially we're going to fly to Colorado and give them a very in depth tour, and they're being slow at responding on time frames. Oh, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:47
well, I'll try to get back to you on when we

Matthias Miller  1:28:49
which game when you're going to show up exactly, all right, 23rd is good, if not three, it's perfect, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:00
So you're going to take him out to the mountains and and are you going to get to go as well?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:07
Seth, I'm not that special.

Speaker 2  1:29:15
You won't have your team of 10 developers there. Then a while. Then, right?

Speaker 1  1:29:22
My team of 10 developers, yeah, that's right, right? When we start the project of taking over the world,

Matthias Miller  1:29:30
it'll be me and my nine alter egos.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:38
I think you all know what the where the 10 developers joke comes from.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:43
Did you tell the story to Drew?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:46
No, I didn't

Speaker 1  1:29:48
Seth, doesn't know this this story either. So let's finish up here before we start storytelling. All right,

Speaker 2  1:29:54
so the other thing is just the NC transition announcement knows you. I basically, well, I don't know that there's you've seen this as well, right? But not well. I don't want the final copy, but I guess I'm not going to read through. Just go through it and let me know if, if there's any questions or any it's this, especially the bottom part the sales and operations is more internally than but, yeah, this

Speaker 2  1:30:34
is so what does that mean for you on the development side, I would, I mean, probably the biggest thing I would see is we have more, like two clients instead of three, now that we're trying to build solve before, so slightly more streamlined, but I don't see, okay, this does

Unknown Speaker  1:31:02
one of the things that will make this transition a lot easier is both

Speaker 2  1:31:10
companies are already using the exact same software, and we're already doing accounting and purchasing the same people are already doing accounting and purchasing, so it's not that that will rateless employee. It's not like doing some other

Unknown Speaker  1:31:38
software yesterday, soon. Good. Any questions?

Matthias Miller  1:31:44
Yes,

Speaker 2  1:31:48
that's good. So Dwayne, let's Yeah, tell them your story about the 10 developers.

Speaker 1  1:31:55
So the other fairly modern software platform in the RTO space that we're going to be, we're, we will be a direct competitor with I attend one of their demos at the that the shed week, and in in that, in that demo, as they were taking questions from the the audience, they they made The comment that they have a total of 15 staff to support the software, 10 of which are developers, full time developers on the platform. And my it was all I could do to have my mouth not fall open, because I talked to Matthias afterward, I said, with 10 full time developers, I think we probably would take over the world. It looks like, No, I think my exact words, it look it makes what we did in two and a half months look like a small miracle.

Speaker 3  1:32:49
The reason behind that is that we have, like, how many years of 50 plus developers working on the core platform exactly that we can go specialize on something like this with a few developers in ways that very few companies can possibly do

Speaker 1  1:33:05
well, and it allows us to come to market with really something that is way beyond the scope of what other companies are going to be able to do at a speed that they that we can do that they can't because of that, because because of The core platform, because of the of all the modularity that already exists. We can rejigger componentry, put it all together in the way that we wanted to, and make it look really, really awesome, and work really, really awesome, and and do fun things like integrated accounting and and you know that nobody else in the in the market currently has, and it was, it was a lot of fun to watch some key individuals that, you know, I specifically wanted to have conversation with, that are that are kind of the accounting gurus in the in the RTO space, almost like if you could almost See their brains glitching on the inside to think that you can actually, actually do something like this. And so Philip Rudolph, which is my my wife's uncle, actually ended up having a longer conversation with Matthias on the floor of the of the shed Expo, based out of conversation that I had with him the day before. And because, you know, in in, in his world right now, everything happens on the management side over in RTO Pro and all everything over in the accounting side happens over in Peachtree. And there's always a, you know, in his words, a a firewall between the two. And you know, as data happens in one side, you manually take it out the word, you go around the wall and you go in the other side. And so if something is wrong over there, you have to do it, fix it on both sides. And I'm just like, No, you just fix it on one side now.

Matthias Miller  1:34:50
And then, my favorite question, how do you keep the people on the rental side from screwing up your books? Well, if it's a closed period, we have an answer for that. Mm. So yes, fun times. I love talking to CFOs, and they're accounting people and wowing them, right?

Speaker 2  1:35:13
Yeah, so what is, what is your take on the show was, was this your first show you've ever been to Matthias?

Matthias Miller  1:35:19
Yeah, it was. I decided to go all in on it. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:23
Were you completely underwhelmed with the size of it or?

Matthias Miller  1:35:26
Well, the only, my only regret is I wish I would have gotten in for a talk on the first day and so the second day. So, I mean, I didn't know what to expect. I knew it wasn't huge. I knew I knew about, I mean, I had asked Marty for numbers of of attendees, so the first day was pretty slow.

Speaker 1  1:35:47
And, yeah, actually, the first day was not pretty slow from a from an attendance standpoint, supposedly it was the biggest, it was the biggest attendance to date. It just didn't feel that way, because they, I think they were 50% larger size this year than any other year. And so the aisles were bigger. Everything was just kind of more spread out. And so normally, what you've never experienced Matthias is like, you, you get, you're literally, are kind of like shouldering through people the entire time as you go through the show, because there's just everybody's kind of jammed in there. This is the first year where it's like you could walk freely up and down the aisles.

Matthias Miller  1:36:28
Well, and I was, I'm the unknown, I'm the unknown identity in the back I was the unknown identity in the back corner across from J mag, who's stealing the show with their little space travel lift thing that they were doing.

Speaker 1  1:36:42
So you just be, just think, thank yourself that you weren't across from their booth last year.

Matthias Miller  1:36:47
Yeah. What? One of them even made a comment. I didn't think it was them either. Yeah. Anyway, about about not being so loud this year and stuff like that. But anyway, fun times

Speaker 1  1:36:58
last year that they were there was people literally jammed in the walkways and like overflowing into other vendors booths, paying zero attention to that vendor, while staring at the JMAG booth, there was some livid vendors last year. I mean, you know, the funny side of this is JMAG folks are like, I'm sorry, we put people in your booth. I mean, it's kind of your job now to interact with them. Like, you know, go be sales people. Whoops,

Speaker 2  1:37:32
What? What? What are they trying to what's their mission? Just be standing out. Or, what with, with, like, what are they trying to do with their, I don't know, their their booths and their setup and all the crazy stuff they do.

Speaker 1  1:37:50
I mean, a lot of it, a lot of it is, I mean, being probably the, I would guess they're somewhere the second or third largest RTO company in the industry. They, you know, they're not actively trying to onboard new people. So they kind of view it as this thing to kind of have fun and meet people and network and and talk about legacy and and, you know, and they treat it much more as it's kind of a time to really just kind of have fun with the industry, rather than they don't really set their booth up as trying to attract new clients. Because, I mean, in discussion with one, one of them that I'm really, really close friends with, he's like, we can't even take on new clients right now. We're, we're in a funding issue with because of, of, well, they, they're the ones that converted over to NetSuite, and they have just had a giant, giant issues with NetSuite, and the transition has just been really, really rocky. And so it's, it's a giant mess. And so they can't even take on new clients right now, so they just come have fun,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:58
and they're

Unknown Speaker  1:39:00
so they're, they're software, somewhat of a bottleneck for them.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:04
That a bottleneck would, would, would, it's more like a Hoover Dam.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:11
Well, you have solutions for them. So

Speaker 1  1:39:13
well they are. They are the large client we're trying to get to go to Colorado and sit down. Because what Matthias and I have proposed to them, is that we'll go right now, even though the software is not finished, we'll go and hook up to the NetSuite API's and suck all their data out, rejigger it into our system, and give them the reporting that they actually want, the that what I'm aiming for right now in I think it would be, they would be very, very funny, if we can get them to agree is that we would, we would be hooking up to NetSuite so they can have accurate accounting,

Speaker 1  1:39:55
which, I mean, you know, I will move, I'll move. I, you know, I'll move, you know, heaven and earth to make this happen, because it's a huge win for us and and if it happens, Seth, you might be, you might be on a plane to or in a car to Colorado, to to because what I'd like to do is, I was fairly audacious. I know we can accomplish this, because it's, it's well within the scope of the work, but I told them, Look, a week to a week and a half, we'll we'll hook up the API's will suck the data out and rejigger it. We'll read, write the reports that you want. In a week and a half later, you can have exactly what you need to go sit down with your banks and actually get, you know, future, future approval for funding, because that's kind of that. That's the hang up right now, they cannot get the reporting that they want out of NetSuite in order to go sit down with the banks in order to do further funding. It's a huge hurdle. Yeah, and I jokingly, Jim Coleman walked by my booth and just was kind of showing real, real quick. And I've overheard some of the conversation, or I've overheard some of the through the grapevine on some of the things that they're actually stuck on trying to getting, on getting and a lot of it comes down to its its current customer data regarding their EPOS and contract balances and so on and so on and so forth. And it's, it's reports that we write in minutes, literally minutes. And I said to I said to Jim, I said, wasn't this? Wasn't this the report you need for the bank? And he just shakes his head, because, yep, that's the one I've been trying to get my hands on for a long time. I was like, I have a solution for you. Wow.

Matthias Miller  1:41:46
Very, good, good.

Speaker 1  1:41:50
So I'm making Matthias life a little bit miserable because I'm trying to lock out dates in the latter half of October, and I'm not, I'm not getting the answers yet on time frames of which dates are going to work for them. So But if, if it if, if we get it to actually happen, we're going to spend about two or three days in Colorado, and we'll work for one day, and we'll play for a day, and and it'll be fun, hopefully, hopefully convince them to be one of the original clients that would be, that'd be a lot of fun. It would make my marketing fairly easy. Yeah?

Speaker 2  1:42:28
It almost be like a builder saying, Yeah, I built Trump's house. Yeah, not quiet, but

Unknown Speaker  1:42:36
good. Well,
