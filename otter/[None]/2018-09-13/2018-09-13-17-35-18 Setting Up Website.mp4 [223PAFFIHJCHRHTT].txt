Unknown Speaker  00:03
Alright, so I'm going to record this. And I'm going to share my screen

Unknown Speaker  00:07
because I do this so often and

Unknown Speaker  00:13
see. And actually, I guess it could record. Now video doesn't matter, I do this so often setting up these sites that I thought would be easier to

Unknown Speaker  00:23
do that report. Let me see if I can actually see myself here.

Unknown Speaker  00:29
It shows me It's talking. Okay, so the first thing that I need to do is

Unknown Speaker  00:36
use the pageant key use pageant to add the key and then get on the VPN. That's really all the details you specifically need

Unknown Speaker  00:46
to get started.

Unknown Speaker  00:48
And then the next step is

Unknown Speaker  00:53
working on to

Unknown Speaker  00:57
first of all, looking at mean cheap

Unknown Speaker  01:04
login again,

Unknown Speaker  01:09
and it will

Unknown Speaker  01:12
be a confirmation code

Unknown Speaker  01:15
so I can wait a second for the code

Unknown Speaker  01:23
and that gives me in there

Unknown Speaker  01:34
Okay, and then go to the domain

Unknown Speaker  01:39
and hit manage

Unknown Speaker  01:41
and then so this is where we're managing the domain so that's will get back to that next one is going over to route 53 though on Amazon

Unknown Speaker  01:53
and we're going to comes up

Unknown Speaker  02:04
Oh, we shouldn't login with route but

Unknown Speaker  02:07
but anyway

Unknown Speaker  02:09
and I will use my phone once again this is using the off the app

Unknown Speaker  02:17
instead of a text message this will use my phone to generate a

Unknown Speaker  02:24
code two factor authentication care to login login here with a route 53

Unknown Speaker  02:33
and we'll create a new hosted zone

Unknown Speaker  02:36
or winning together books calm

Unknown Speaker  02:41
there's that

Unknown Speaker  02:44
and then just okay so that's that part now what I will do is I will pick these name servers to over into into the name server settings in the cheap and I will copy them over one by one not copy the period

Unknown Speaker  03:02
and

Unknown Speaker  03:07
and usually I put the.co.uk at the bottom just because

Unknown Speaker  03:14
the Euro UK we're targeting the UK

Unknown Speaker  03:21
now we got the name server setup. So that should be all I need from named chief mangy from the domain register. All right, then the other thing I do which I have instructions I don't need to but let's say we go to risk free delegation because it's simple want to copy from will take the ad record set foot in whoops

Unknown Speaker  03:44
leave that blank put in this value create

Unknown Speaker  03:49
ad records that will be www dot

Unknown Speaker  03:53
also to that IP address but do that for that six six or seven

Unknown Speaker  04:00
the end

Unknown Speaker  04:03
on this one it's actually literally that simple.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
Now sometimes will want to add this as a domain and actually well we go ahead and just do this with it

Unknown Speaker  04:20
so that we know that we've got it working at this domain to Google

Unknown Speaker  04:25
so

Unknown Speaker  04:32
go into admin at Google. com

Unknown Speaker  04:39
and

Unknown Speaker  04:44
good more controls domains add remove domains

Unknown Speaker  04:50
alias and another domain

Unknown Speaker  04:54
and this is going to be winning together calm and what this will let us do it will let us so that email addresses so we go to

Unknown Speaker  05:06
say we don't know who the books separating click will we'll pick one because Amazon isn't on here

Unknown Speaker  05:17
we'll pick named chief even though we're actually not using that but

Unknown Speaker  05:20
okay so here's the text record we go back over here we create record set create a TXT record

Unknown Speaker  05:27
and we paste in the value that we had over there it create and I don't know if

Unknown Speaker  05:35
we'll be able to access to be with the name cheap changes though

Unknown Speaker  05:41
Let me see we're gonna have to

Unknown Speaker  05:43
wait a little bit

Unknown Speaker  05:46
but let's go see

Unknown Speaker  05:51
it IP config flush DNS and then you're paying playing putting together a book that calm and it's so

Unknown Speaker  06:02
alright let's try again

Unknown Speaker  06:05
that ok so now it's actually verified with Google good to go all right and actually if I go to winning together book calm

Unknown Speaker  06:13
I get this page which means it's not set up so now

Unknown Speaker  06:18
I'm going to walk into the server

Unknown Speaker  06:24
and

Unknown Speaker  06:33
I'm

Unknown Speaker  06:37
okay so we do see these are the WW WordPress the open up sites that Jason and not to worry about that part then you'll see here I have actually already added these this entry which again is relatively self excellent I mean it's self explanatory to me but we had to entry for the book first of all for for this and

Unknown Speaker  07:02
we're going to do Let's Encrypt true

Unknown Speaker  07:07
which will turn on SSL and then we'll run GMP WordPress

Unknown Speaker  07:12
flush

Unknown Speaker  07:14
admins

Unknown Speaker  07:17
actually sorry, she

Unknown Speaker  07:30
will do

Unknown Speaker  07:33
it will install it

Unknown Speaker  07:36
register the domain

Unknown Speaker  07:40
security

Unknown Speaker  07:54
don't restart and then when we refresh we get the WordPress setup page the restart the setup

Unknown Speaker  08:06
and I always just use

Unknown Speaker  08:13
that for that's how I do my

Unknown Speaker  08:20
the word

Unknown Speaker  08:23
I'm sorry, this is

Unknown Speaker  08:25
a book

Unknown Speaker  08:29
I'm actually going to

Unknown Speaker  08:34
so I'll have to record it really

Unknown Speaker  08:36
record it

Unknown Speaker  08:38
and get my email

Unknown Speaker  08:43
and install. Alright, so now it's installed I will walk in,

Unknown Speaker  08:49
there's something else that I forgot to do here.

Unknown Speaker  08:56
What is it so

Unknown Speaker  09:00
or the pseudo ch own ASR ww

Unknown Speaker  09:03
the data

Unknown Speaker  09:06
actually I don't think I have to do this anyone

Unknown Speaker  09:09
seeing a fix it Let's try it

Unknown Speaker  09:17
again.

Unknown Speaker  09:19
And

Unknown Speaker  09:24
all right actually there's one thing that I need to do

Unknown Speaker  09:29
one of the things I need to think about is

Unknown Speaker  09:34
ok you can pause this part from the instructions but for the Thrive Themes see what kind of licensing stuff

Unknown Speaker  10:04
my accountant license

Unknown Speaker  10:14
so if thrive architect at five licenses which is an upgrade

Unknown Speaker  10:24
life and teach

Unknown Speaker  10:32
me what I need to do

Unknown Speaker  10:36
the upgrade this

Unknown Speaker  10:39
oh go ahead and upgrade

Unknown Speaker  11:18
redirect back

Unknown Speaker  11:23
when we come back to

Unknown Speaker  11:28
here

Unknown Speaker  11:35
get my products so if I go to my license keys

Unknown Speaker  11:44
and now I actually have another one was 15

Unknown Speaker  11:48
or that's the invoice

Unknown Speaker  11:51
you'll see here that

Unknown Speaker  11:53
there's information okay so normally I won't have to upgrade but I didn't have to upgrading this upgrading the situation So the one thing I do want to do is

Unknown Speaker  12:05
the easiest way to do it usually

Unknown Speaker  12:11
the content

Unknown Speaker  12:15
well again we'll do that through

Unknown Speaker  12:37
and I just managed to trigger fraud

Unknown Speaker  12:40
check on my account

Unknown Speaker  12:43
that's all good

Unknown Speaker  12:45
so

Unknown Speaker  12:55
I don't have it installed on their food multiplies software

Unknown Speaker  13:02
be content

Unknown Speaker  13:04
again

Unknown Speaker  13:14
to give you plenty

Unknown Speaker  13:20
like and

Unknown Speaker  13:23
install the plugin plugin

Unknown Speaker  13:27
that's I think that's all I need on that one at this point actually we should copy the theme over as well

Unknown Speaker  13:33
we'll do this

Unknown Speaker  13:36
means rise to

Unknown Speaker  13:39
need to get a book to

Unknown Speaker  13:48
copy the rights being over as well that's if we go back into here and that's something I need to do when I set up when I go into here now when I go to plug in

Unknown Speaker  13:58
we've got thrive architect which can activate

Unknown Speaker  14:03
your to thrive dashboard license manager and this is something that you can do

Unknown Speaker  14:12
but I put my license key and activate it works

Unknown Speaker  14:16
directly

Unknown Speaker  14:20
so good so section 13 to go to

Unknown Speaker  14:29
something else we need to do it all new installs This is something actually let me go ahead and do this this is also something else that I would have to do

Unknown Speaker  14:45
and I'll make you an admin

Unknown Speaker  14:50
and I'm actually going to start an email

Unknown Speaker  14:54
to instructions to finish setting it up

Unknown Speaker  15:05
finished setting up

Unknown Speaker  15:07
so

Unknown Speaker  15:09
please

Unknown Speaker  15:11
come give Heidi access to it up Heidi do regular updates you see

Unknown Speaker  15:22
or email her

Unknown Speaker  15:26
and

Unknown Speaker  15:30
actually wait right now

Unknown Speaker  15:34
I think you can set up the account which will have to add the last best and actually I think yeah and I think you should have an email so you should add it to

Unknown Speaker  15:54
your password to last question ok so now now you have access to it and so this rest of the stuff like it's like some of these plugins

Unknown Speaker  16:03
within WordPress you should be able to do so

Unknown Speaker  16:08
one of the important things is doing work fence

Unknown Speaker  16:12
sorry and new plugin we do word fence

Unknown Speaker  16:21
security now where we activate that

Unknown Speaker  16:25
in the best way to actually do this is go to

Unknown Speaker  16:30
the multiplayer strengths that come

Unknown Speaker  16:35
up

Unknown Speaker  16:40
work since all the integration work that you're gonna have to bear with me

Unknown Speaker  16:48
in the tools import export options you go to export

Unknown Speaker  16:54
copy the token were to word fans tools

Unknown Speaker  17:12
get alerts

Unknown Speaker  17:15
on mailing list

Unknown Speaker  17:19
you know what premium increase it at some point anyway you go to tool so it's still set up tools import and export

Unknown Speaker  17:28
and enable auto update that okay and import work then you paste in the code from the other page important defense options

Unknown Speaker  17:37
and that gets you the security that I'm trying to think if there's other

Unknown Speaker  17:46
plugins that we should have I don't think that there are but

Unknown Speaker  17:53
to delete this plugin you don't have to do that but me to

Unknown Speaker  17:58
discuss image optimizer small snippet

Unknown Speaker  18:04
please write in Clark anymore thank goodness

Unknown Speaker  18:13
sponsored PayPal layout

Unknown Speaker  18:16
CSS and see it plans

Unknown Speaker  18:22
think on

Unknown Speaker  18:26
think it's worth adding that to me he

Unknown Speaker  18:32
advanced gives you a better

Unknown Speaker  18:36
visual editor so you have to install and activate

Unknown Speaker  18:41
w three total cash probably wouldn't hurt

Unknown Speaker  18:54
so you can see always

Unknown Speaker  19:03
alright let's see if we can settings we need to do that

Unknown Speaker  19:10
okay um

Unknown Speaker  19:44
and that changed I don't know what I really don't know if there's anything that see

Unknown Speaker  19:54
like i will i mean here's

Unknown Speaker  19:58
here's an obvious thing really actually

Unknown Speaker  20:03
enable it

Unknown Speaker  20:46
you're watching right now

Unknown Speaker  20:59
patriots I don't know if I want that or not but

Unknown Speaker  21:04
yes I do save all settings so those are all the ones that we need to

Unknown Speaker  21:08
change oh

Unknown Speaker  21:11
actually right here

Unknown Speaker  21:20
palantir not just did you probably want to empty that you change the settings

Unknown Speaker  21:27
so now we go to read together book calm

Unknown Speaker  21:31
looks like that one of the things we're going to want to do is and the themes

Unknown Speaker  21:36
appearance beans

Unknown Speaker  21:39
I don't know for sure but I'm guessing what the right thing so there's that then also under Settings there's a couple things to change

Unknown Speaker  21:52
tag ladies you fixed

Unknown Speaker  21:58
certain should be

Unknown Speaker  22:02
ever

Unknown Speaker  22:06
do that

Unknown Speaker  22:09
reading

Unknown Speaker  22:12
the homepage and of course you might change that how you see fit we are back to here

Unknown Speaker  22:24
There it is. There's the basic thing I'm some other things that will need to change

Unknown Speaker  22:35
the footer

Unknown Speaker  22:43
and really something else ready to do is it's pixel tracking and stuff like that on here

Unknown Speaker  22:51
which I should just walk you through because I need to do that a lot.

Unknown Speaker  22:57
I'm actually going to let you do

Unknown Speaker  23:02
on risk free delegation.

Unknown Speaker  23:13
We see this one here.

Unknown Speaker  23:29
Alright, plugins

Unknown Speaker  23:33
will tag manager

Unknown Speaker  23:45
well Google would have had their own

Unknown Speaker  24:01
wait to see this

Unknown Speaker  24:06
video

Unknown Speaker  24:31
i'm not quite sure exactly.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  24:38
Okay. Here's the other thing we need

Unknown Speaker  24:40
need this plugin right here. So we go over to risk free delegation and new plug in

Unknown Speaker  24:48
that will test them this one

Unknown Speaker  24:51
so the first step com

Unknown Speaker  24:54
we stole it we activate it

Unknown Speaker  25:01
and then we go to custom custom HTML so this is where we're going to come back to but first that we're going to call this Google Tag Manager

Unknown Speaker  25:09
then we'll go to

Unknown Speaker  25:13
I don't remember what your domain is

Unknown Speaker  25:18
better

Unknown Speaker  25:20
site in a manager

Unknown Speaker  25:44
alright so we're going to create

Unknown Speaker  25:47
an account

Unknown Speaker  25:51
now let's do this under multiply

Unknown Speaker  25:57
don't have anything in doubles player strikes so I'll just do this in multiple software I think that's fine create a container under multiply software it will be risk free the delegation that

Unknown Speaker  26:09
we're going to use it on the web

Unknown Speaker  26:14
okay and here's the code that we install that we copy this code

Unknown Speaker  26:20
this needs to be in the head portion

Unknown Speaker  26:22
so we're going to call this Google Tag Manager head up right in here

Unknown Speaker  26:37
No I don't like this quite sure where the

Unknown Speaker  26:47
What did we do from sorry I might be as instructions rather than run let's practice

Unknown Speaker  27:00
actually did use a plug in here

Unknown Speaker  27:27
tracking

Unknown Speaker  27:29
oh that's something else we need to get that

Unknown Speaker  27:54
here we go this is what we're looking for.

Unknown Speaker  28:00
So jumping back Give me the

Unknown Speaker  28:05
next one this one so I didn't save it here we go into the

Unknown Speaker  28:13
dashboard general settings

Unknown Speaker  28:16
know

Unknown Speaker  28:19
dashboard

Unknown Speaker  28:31
right oh I didn't activate my feeling that's the problem

Unknown Speaker  28:36
license manager and

Unknown Speaker  28:40
the other thing you have to do you have to go into try things and you have to go to dashboard

Unknown Speaker  28:54
my accounts in life isn't keys

Unknown Speaker  28:58
go down to the rise

Unknown Speaker  29:01
and input that license so this is going to be

Unknown Speaker  29:05
valuable player strengths fixed in the

Unknown Speaker  29:09
ski I don't know if the spaces matter built out for you so that gives us access to that

Unknown Speaker  29:15
because of the dashboard

Unknown Speaker  29:20
so

Unknown Speaker  29:24
I think I can do this without see if I can

Unknown Speaker  29:34
say

Unknown Speaker  29:38
three delegation

Unknown Speaker  29:44
looks like it so So then once we activate that theme we come down here we even have Theme Options and that's where we can do

Unknown Speaker  29:56
and analytics and scripts you'll see the header script will do that body tag by

Unknown Speaker  30:03
script

Unknown Speaker  30:07
will save those changes

Unknown Speaker  30:14
and it's going to ask you

Unknown Speaker  30:17
if you actually want to do that because they're putting in code

Unknown Speaker  30:21
and

Unknown Speaker  30:25
yes you do want to do this so you'll see this is no answers here. Okay so that gets gets that part of it set up now you need new tags so we're going to

Unknown Speaker  30:39
just going to copy from

Unknown Speaker  30:42
from here go subtext.

Unknown Speaker  30:47
Alright so the first one we're going to add

Unknown Speaker  30:50
custom HTML

Unknown Speaker  30:53
and you're going to call it

Unknown Speaker  30:57
Facebook

Unknown Speaker  31:00
and we are going to

Unknown Speaker  31:03
simply copy

Unknown Speaker  31:06
this code into here and we're going to save that

Unknown Speaker  31:11
Oh yeah, we need to trigger all pages

Unknown Speaker  31:19
new tag for

Unknown Speaker  31:23
Google Analytics

Unknown Speaker  31:26
to that LinkedIn

Unknown Speaker  31:40
now

Unknown Speaker  31:41
save that whoops forgot to have a trigger again I'll pay to save that and the other thing we need is actually a good

Unknown Speaker  32:31
we had one for drip This is important because this is what allows drip tracking to actually work

Unknown Speaker  32:39
trigger

Unknown Speaker  32:42
so and the other thing to know about trip let's see if this is actually right i think

Unknown Speaker  32:46
i think we need to go into drip

Unknown Speaker  32:53
I can never remember where this stuff is located.

Unknown Speaker  33:25
Oh boy, you don't have to do anything

Unknown Speaker  33:34
fancy that

Unknown Speaker  33:37
gets recognized that all

Unknown Speaker  33:40
right so then that gets that and what was the other thing we're gonna Oh yeah, we're gonna shut up the analytics now we're gonna go to analytics

Unknown Speaker  34:01
I think I can ensure these assets with you it's Google assets so that you can get access to them

Unknown Speaker  34:08
so we go to be

Unknown Speaker  34:14
the player strengths

Unknown Speaker  34:24
admin we want to be under multiplayer strengths for creating new property called

Unknown Speaker  34:33
discrete allocation that we do that HTTPS

Unknown Speaker  34:40
risk free delegation. com

Unknown Speaker  34:44
it's going to be

Unknown Speaker  34:49
markets

Unknown Speaker  34:51
and longtime please

Unknown Speaker  35:00
tracking ID

Unknown Speaker  35:06
copy this over here actually

Unknown Speaker  35:16
okay so we actually had a new tag it's gonna be a

Unknown Speaker  35:22
little right there for my eyes

Unknown Speaker  35:33
wait

Unknown Speaker  35:42
yeah you do new variable in the put in the tracking ID

Unknown Speaker  35:49
save that

Unknown Speaker  35:54
little tracking ID settings hit Save

Unknown Speaker  36:02
right now all that should be good to go

Unknown Speaker  36:06
now we have the Google

Unknown Speaker  36:09
tag

Unknown Speaker  36:12
so there's that everything we do in here

Unknown Speaker  36:18
so data data retention right here and we're going to

Unknown Speaker  36:22
not expire any data

Unknown Speaker  36:26
there's that

Unknown Speaker  36:28
and then we're going to and then here's the cool thing to come back to risk free delegation now that we've done all that you don't have a cash if you had a cash you need to clear the cache going to go to risk we delegation that calm

Unknown Speaker  36:42
and see if

Unknown Speaker  36:46
those found

Unknown Speaker  37:27
technology install ok so the cool thing is

Unknown Speaker  37:32
guru tech manager

Unknown Speaker  37:34
Oh I know what I did forget something

Unknown Speaker  37:38
something you got to do

Unknown Speaker  37:42
in here in verse three delegation

Unknown Speaker  37:46
Once you've added all these things you actually submit and publish your changes to publish it continue

Unknown Speaker  38:00
and you'll see now that I found the facebook pixel we are page will see that actually tried to page two

Unknown Speaker  38:11
little concerning

Unknown Speaker  38:52
alright so you would have to copy and paste it into these two items here she's been on my next during the next happens to be great

Unknown Speaker  39:06
then you can get the

Unknown Speaker  39:12
the

Unknown Speaker  39:27
and then

Unknown Speaker  39:50
that's basically what's required to actually do this I will go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  39:58
