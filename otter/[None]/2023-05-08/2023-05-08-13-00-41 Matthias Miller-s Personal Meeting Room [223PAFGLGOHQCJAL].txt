Unknown Speaker  00:40
Howdy Sir Hey Sir

Matthias Miller  00:46
as I shut my mouth school food

Speaker 1  00:48
I have I have no video so don't don't look for my pretty face well

Unknown Speaker  01:09
what is it about Mondays

Speaker 1  01:14
maybe it's just maybe it's just that you know it's like the first couple hours of work but like the first couple of minutes were workout United said like you just feel like you can barely get going and it just comes at you so fast it's on Mondays are

Unknown Speaker  01:29
that's probably about right

Speaker 1  01:34
today has been a doozy since like buying trucks scheduling to get those trucks to their respective locations.

Unknown Speaker  01:45
Training Sales Law salesman opening up new sales lots. Why don't we just do that all today?

Unknown Speaker  01:55
Seems pretty. Seems about right. Just about right.

Speaker 1  02:04
All of that to get to about two o'clock and realize Oh, Addison is not here. You can't pick up Alexis.

Unknown Speaker  02:09
It's

Matthias Miller  02:14
better to think of it then you get a call being like, Hey, you gotta pick your daughter up from school today.

Unknown Speaker  02:24
That'd be terrible. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  02:33
All right, let's dive in. And let's, let's

Unknown Speaker  02:36
let's knock something out today.

Unknown Speaker  02:39
Okay, so I'm going to assume you don't have a ridiculously huge screen

Unknown Speaker  02:54
a 2027 or something like that. Not it's not super small, but it's not my big screen.

Unknown Speaker  03:03
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  03:07
let me ask you, let me ask you a question before. Okay. The logic that I sent you earlier. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  03:22
Where is this?

Unknown Speaker  03:23
Where is this? Come on, signal open up.

Matthias Miller  03:32
Okay, I didn't, didn't notice you had unnecessary parentheses, but I didn't know that was related to what you were not understanding.

Speaker 1  03:38
Okay. So the unnecessary parentheses I'm assuming you're saying is around the transit scheduled date and the transit confirmed? Is that right? Yes. Right. So if I want those two to work as as one component in other words, both of those have to be true in order for it to not be excluded.

Unknown Speaker  04:06
Okay. So okay,

Speaker 1  04:10
here's what actually GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO BACK TO to the user folders go to

Unknown Speaker  04:20
go to logistics.

Speaker 1  04:27
The very top folder district manager logistics schedules, unscheduled and go to the subset

Speaker 1  04:42
This is what actually works and but to me, it seems like an inordinate incorrect amount of knots. Oh,

Matthias Miller  04:52
yeah, it would be. I think what you want

Speaker 1  05:11
Okay, that also worked. But now explain to me and I'm sorry, because I'm you know, I didn't grew up with logic explained to me that the the, the functions of ands or an ORS

Unknown Speaker  05:29
Okay, and means

Speaker 2  05:36
who on the Zoom call is wearing a blue shirt and

Matthias Miller  05:43
has an air pot in his ear blue shirt true air pot in his ear. Now if you put that in parentheses and put a knot around

Unknown Speaker  05:53
it, then

Matthias Miller  05:58
you say that's true, but flip it for me, which would be false. And I'm assuming you're not, I don't can't see you, you're not wearing a blue shirt and or you're not wearing an air pod in your ear, therefore, it would be false for you that not flips it and so you would get included.

Unknown Speaker  06:14
Okay, let's see, let's

Speaker 1  06:17
let's, let me ask it this. Okay. So the issue I was running into is the dispatcher had erroneously checked there was nobody assigned to it there was no scheduled date assigned to it. But he had mistakenly selected confirmed which excluded it from the schedule now you're saying if I would have been using it or well if I was if I did have an order in there but like so you're saying if this is true or that is true, then bring it into like

Matthias Miller  07:07
these two are the same thing. So if you have to have both blue shirt and air pods to not have that is well, if I don't have a blue shirt, then obviously that's I don't meet that condition or about to have air pods that meet that condition.

Speaker 1  07:22
So what I what I wrote is essentially the same thing as using the or statements is that right? Yeah All right, well that replace my logic and and put it in there and save it

Matthias Miller  07:37
let me just sanity

Unknown Speaker  07:40
check because I'm paranoid just made sure I wrote it right

Unknown Speaker  07:49
transit

Unknown Speaker  08:02
she'd get nothing here we

Unknown Speaker  08:16
go so then if this one could be here we're also going to test this one when we rewrite it for kicks and giggles.

Unknown Speaker  08:47
And

Matthias Miller  09:00
Alright, so matches a subset and you either have a transit type, or you have a transit stin.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
And it's not canceled, and it's not completed and

Matthias Miller  09:14
you have a blank scheduled date a blank assignee, or it's not been confirmed.

Unknown Speaker  09:19
And the district matches boom. Good.

Speaker 1  09:29
I'm trying this. I kid you not learning logics. I feel a little bit like grammar. I mean, some of it is just grammar. It's like, you can say the same thing. And you'll communicate the same thought but it's still incorrect. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:47
I think it's basically or another way to say it is there's simple and complicated ways of saying that. I mean, one of the things I see sometimes with developers is not Something like that. And it's like, well, you know, there's another way to say this it's a lot simpler which is today does not equal.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
So it's not yeah yeah, I have

Speaker 1  10:18
I still remember standing in your, in your office there and Seth just cocking his head looking at my code and going that makes my head hurt

Speaker 1  10:33
but it worked and, but it was still like so does Okay, when we talk about code from a computer standpoint is it is roundabout way like reaching around your back to scratch your elbow. Is there any speed changes that like when you say something simple or simplistic?

Speaker 2  10:55
Not not for that type of stuff.

Unknown Speaker  10:59
You just look less educated when you write silly stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  11:02
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  11:06
Cost of evaluation evaluating those types of expressions

Unknown Speaker  11:09
is it's

Matthias Miller  11:14
those who can even detect it reasonably well.

Unknown Speaker  11:21
Okay, so key first thing

Unknown Speaker  11:26
is maybe

Speaker 1  11:28
in order to quickly more quickly align ourselves and the layout of what I'm doing versus what you're doing. You're doing a little bit more simple or one one report per menu item and I'm oftentimes doing two reports per menu item is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  11:48
Quite possibly

Unknown Speaker  11:56
like the follow up in the

Matthias Miller  11:59
to opportunities quote so

Speaker 1  12:01
what is your okay so your homepage is to do right

Unknown Speaker  12:06
yes

Unknown Speaker  12:10
pretty sure come on you know you want to so pains to yes it is it is to do

Speaker 1  12:28
and it's a single it's a single two there's not that there's no other pain to it now. You should go you should import your your answers into your into your pains.

Unknown Speaker  12:40
I should

Speaker 1  12:48
once I once I figured out how to do that one. Using using my using my pages became a little bit easier for anybody who's doing it on the admin sides.

Unknown Speaker  12:59
Yeah. Agreed. So then here sub panes what does it be? Should be asked sales rep equals okay, let's give this a shot before we save.

Speaker 1  13:22
You gotta you gotta put some parentheses around it or not parentheses.

Unknown Speaker  13:28
Much McCall. It's

Unknown Speaker  13:37
a young day is more every day this makes me dizzy.

Unknown Speaker  13:48
Who you got to Victoria? Because if you're on Marissa, aren't you? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:57
Hey, sidenote, without getting distracted, I took your 6%. And I went to back to Mike and I said, if we restrict our dealers back to 35 mile radius, and we increase and we spend another three grand a month on Facebook, your folks will actually be able to hit their hit their sales goals.

Speaker 1  14:18
Yeah, because here's here's the thing. I'm if you go back and actually look at some of the close rates for brick and mortar dealers, when you went back out to 50% Suddenly they're like the amount of leads that they're they're not they're not handling them. No, there's many I have a what

Matthias Miller  14:39
I'll call this. Mark has said to himself in the call this morning, he said he said please don't give me anything outside my 50 mile

Speaker 1  14:49
Yeah, but here's here's the interesting thing. If you look when I had that on my opportunities thing, that little checkbox I had that actually highlights all the lead It's in your territory versus what's outside of your territory to put they're still predominantly getting what's in their territory. Well, at least okay, I was I didn't look at Calvin. I'm pretty sure Marcus actually is. But ginger is predominantly we're all inside of our territory. So I do think restricting back to say either Well, I would I would vote for compact to 40 and see what that does.

Unknown Speaker  15:23
And we increase we increase lead flow. If I can get her

Matthias Miller  15:29
to spend more on Facebook, then 35 is the new 50 which means maybe it's back down to 30 Ginger for some reason her local geography is just a killer place to be in.

Speaker 1  15:40
Yes, because if you remember from the heat maps, Winston Salem, Statesville, Lexington and Mocksville that triangle is like sheds direct, just pounded that triangle

Unknown Speaker  16:01
Okay, now we're getting off in the weeds.

Unknown Speaker  16:03
Okay. Well, so

Matthias Miller  16:13
I think the main thing we need to build

Unknown Speaker  16:13
is what is the

Matthias Miller  16:18
doodoo slash hot lead view? Do we just want to add a separate

Unknown Speaker  16:24
dude? I like that to do and hotly.

Unknown Speaker  16:29
How would you characterize a hot lead? They have to

Matthias Miller  16:35
think they have to characterize I mean keep it updated but I don't know.

Speaker 1  16:38
But are they going to have mental disconnect if if your hot leads end up on the front page and then you have to go chasing your other ones on another page?

Unknown Speaker  16:48
No, it's all one homepage okay. Like somewhere there's a view that says

Matthias Miller  16:56
here are all your hot leads needing follow up here's your all your Uncategorized leads or your cold leads they come in as cold or something I don't know. And then here are your hot leads needing follow up

Unknown Speaker  17:13
for your I mean okay well let's go

Matthias Miller  17:19
this is okay first of all, let's let's go talk about

Unknown Speaker  17:26
here's what I need to do.

Matthias Miller  17:27
I should just have a conversation with Marissa and say, hey Marissa, this is

Speaker 2  17:32
possible like whether you need to clean it up or like no make them clean it up

Unknown Speaker  17:44
if you go write software to do it they'll never clean it up

Unknown Speaker  17:56
probably shouldn't send this to an all caps clean up your today's

Speaker 1  18:31
you should you should go put in a a row level expression that says if it's Marissa and it's overdue turn it like background bright red

Matthias Miller  18:45
well you could also do it if it's more than a week overdue Yeah,

Speaker 1  18:52
well then again if reg tech doesn't get to do it I'm not sure what we'll wait Is there a way Is there a way how about making this thing a editable report and you can you can kill it from right from the row

Unknown Speaker  19:11
cool like what?

Speaker 1  19:13
Like you can you can you can whatever. Go into that go into the opportunity

Unknown Speaker  19:26
follow up task.

Speaker 1  19:27
Mark follow up completed. Can that be a

Unknown Speaker  19:31
button? Yeah, can you can literally

Speaker 1  19:38
like you can like you got all the information here called your customer and you said Oh, mark this as complete. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:45
I mean, and you should really create another one. You should create a communication record. Really?

Unknown Speaker  19:51
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:24
See me there are actually 268

Speaker 2  20:44
Okay really handy. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  20:53
that was a management issue Okay so the question is

Unknown Speaker  20:57
how I think you want

Matthias Miller  21:04
could we have a four pane report two rows you've got

Unknown Speaker  21:08
each category

Matthias Miller  21:14
okay Marissa was really wanting longer term leads like I don't know somebody is actually looking to buy land and but they're very seriously I mean they're serious prospects but they're you would just have it be a hot lead with a distant follow up date

Unknown Speaker  21:43
sure so I think

Matthias Miller  21:47
you can just do a cold can we just do a cold warm hot and you would show and then each you would filter by category and you would have the top I wish I would have added that field last week

Unknown Speaker  22:10
we will just do a temperature field. Warm cold hot lead temp.

Speaker 1  22:19
Now that temporary temperature lead temperature cold warm hot. Yeah, but if it's a cold well, okay, now the common is called the Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  22:31
what is cold?

Unknown Speaker  22:32
I mean

Unknown Speaker  22:44
do you leave it as blank? folks coming in? On categorize.

Unknown Speaker  22:57
Now you've got that you got four panes?

Speaker 1  23:04
Now, I kind of do like, well, but if it's okay, what are you supposed to do with cold leads, then?

Speaker 2  23:11
Well, do you even need cold? We need. I mean, it's basically

Matthias Miller  23:17
I think of the three stages as I need to try to get a hold of them. I made contact, but they're just be bopping around. And I've got a really serious buyer here.

Unknown Speaker  23:34
Okay, actually

Speaker 1  23:36
think of it. We're not actually talking about software, we're actually talking about process now. So what has been what has what has been taught to them as far as a sales process? Like? Has Mike and Ronaldo done any kind of training on how to close this stuff? Have you?

Matthias Miller  24:02
Um, as far as the process in the sales conversation,

Speaker 1  24:05
yeah, well, okay, so well do we have a step by step process. So from the time that lead hits the, your, your screen, to the time that you close it out by either winning it or abandoning it?

Matthias Miller  24:20
I don't think it's very, very clearly defined. I think it'd be a great exercise for the sales team to work together to nail this down. I really, really love Marcus's philosophy, which is, I call him like, I'm like, I'm a debt collector. And he's like, if they filled out the form, they want information, so I'm going to try to hunt him down and give it to him. And so he'll call it three times a day and or three times the first day or whatever, to try to get a hold of them. Here's another side note at the moment. Do you think if we gave Tori and Marissa physical have cell phones with actual cell phone numbers with 18 T or Verizon or wherever, whatever they use wherever they're at. If and we would not give them a VoIP number would that bypass some of the spam filtering that tends to show up for white numbers? And

Unknown Speaker  25:17
like, does does apple

Matthias Miller  25:21
so that's so far out of the loop? Do Apple and Android do any kind of like, Hey, this is a potential spam Call Alerts.

Unknown Speaker  25:29
Well, my my phone does all the time.

Matthias Miller  25:34
But we will give them a physical cell phone

Speaker 1  25:39
well, you want to know the truth of the matter. Every single one of the highest online guys has a cell phones. A company Oh, funds. That's how they're texting. That's how they're communicating with their customers.

Unknown Speaker  25:54
I think it's worth I wonder if that wouldn't help.

Speaker 1  25:58
Oh, Lord have mercy. I'm not to go by to mark. Well, I already have how many of these on an account might as well add some more?

Matthias Miller  26:06
Do you agree or disagree? No, I

Unknown Speaker  26:08
agree. I mean, okay, so here's the here's the only Stickler portion.

Unknown Speaker  26:15
So,

Unknown Speaker  26:20
to me, okay, this is just me. But if I

Speaker 2  26:23
was if I was, if I was a salesperson

Speaker 1  26:27
sitting there Well, I mean, I do this all the time, I just go and link my cell phone to my, my browser. And throughout the day, I rarely ever text message using my phone, I just pop it open and text right up with a keyboard, Apple or what? No one wants Android. I mean, both platforms have this.

Matthias Miller  26:57
Okay, the only question remains if we want to push stuff into the CRM.

Unknown Speaker  27:02
Do you have any idea where that takes?

Speaker 1  27:06
Me but this is what this is where I feel like this is where I feel like that is so low value. Like okay, great. It shows up there automatically shows up there. But how much value is that to

Unknown Speaker  27:23
actually? I mean, yes,

Speaker 1  27:27
I don't know. Listen, I just come from the RTO days where there was no such thing as integration. Like when you got on the phone, you open the customers account and you start typing

Unknown Speaker  27:38
that's how I'm just that's how I'm used to. Hi, this is

Speaker 1  27:43
Dwayne from from shed rentals. What is your account number? Oh, your account number whatever. Okay, I see here and then you open up the comments you start typing like that's just how it always

Unknown Speaker  27:52
was. Well, if we really need something

Matthias Miller  27:56
we can add SMS integration which basically says Text me the phone number we can text them a telephone link they can click and dial

Speaker 2  28:04
like I know it's a little janky but I kind of feel like

Matthias Miller  28:10
actually makes enough of a difference on deliverability

Unknown Speaker  28:14
percent should do it

Matthias Miller  28:17
or not deliverability but contact ability

Speaker 1  28:22
now email in and out I would I am a fan of but the texting in and out I don't know just doesn't I don't know it just doesn't bite for me maybe I'm just old school that whatever I think that's too far off in the weeds at the moment do I do I think that cell phone is a great idea. Yes every other single dealer every every brick and mortar dealers sitting there on their their phones texting out to customers

Unknown Speaker  28:50
so are you chasing that? am I choosing that well if you get approved for it

Speaker 1  28:57
I'll just go order order them and put on the same account that we've currently been using already had like four or five of these things already posted I forgot as opposed to get another one

Unknown Speaker  29:14
Would you shut up

Unknown Speaker  29:20
I didn't do it. No you didn't.

Unknown Speaker  29:30
Tory and

Unknown Speaker  29:45
plus, here's the thing. For most of

Speaker 1  29:50
these guys, the amount of data they actually use on these cell phones is next to nothing. And if you're doing a predominant like if you do a six gigabytes of data or less. I mean cellphone plans at that level are pretty cheap

Unknown Speaker  30:15
but I, I will

Speaker 1  30:16
say this, I think if if we can nail down the process whereby from the time the lead hits, to the time that you close it out what's expected of you every step of that way how many phone calls are expected? What's the communication type supposed to be, you'd lay it out in a strict plan and recipe and then we build software to match it. Or I think that will help inform your warm cold hot conversation and then we add the status as accordingly and build pains to actually function the way that we're we're building the process to work

Unknown Speaker  30:54
so

Matthias Miller  30:57
well, I have a new idea. I don't know if I like this or not, but

Speaker 2  31:01
that's a shot. What if we would say

Matthias Miller  31:08
Merson Tori you guys are switching over to the CRM here what's missing because they're going to be the easiest to work with

Speaker 1  31:24
and I really want to do I really want to do a way to for this one on the right hand this this building one because now I'm using this information in two different places it's almost identical information because the sales in quotes now does the exact same thing

Unknown Speaker  31:45
like it shows that same information

Speaker 1  31:47
well yeah because I went and embodied pretty much the exact same information because what was happening is not the quotes the sales what was happening is we were getting buildings updated on their builder notes to close to the

Unknown Speaker  32:03
to the watch McCollough delivery

Speaker 1  32:08
well too close to the build date Floyd when updated boy went and updated builder notes like a day like the same day they were building the building

Unknown Speaker  32:19
that's gonna be a problem. Yeah, so

Speaker 1  32:21
I mean, the whole thing starts turning colors as as you get go put in ginger I think she's got some that are or

Unknown Speaker  32:28
that are unbuilt yet

Unknown Speaker  32:31
for Kelvin Yeah, there you go. So Luis Cressman is creaseman is actually being built today

Matthias Miller  32:49
I mean, I kind of like this

Unknown Speaker  32:52
as a path forward

Unknown Speaker  33:01
what what's not to like?

Speaker 1  33:03
Do me a favor GO GO filter quotes top right put in put in I don't care put somebody in there. Oh, you know what? I really want to go and add in a really want to go and add a date timeframe to that we don't get these things so so long all this old quotes

Unknown Speaker  33:30
what if what if we now which by just hide them what's reasonable 90 days

Unknown Speaker  33:46
delivered more than

Speaker 1  33:50
No. So So create creation date? Like go put a put a date field in there that says like 90 days and that's it start excluding quotes based on anything older than 90 days. Okay, but

Matthias Miller  34:07
on which one Exactly? Because you've got

Speaker 1  34:10
the quote the quote one the put in Yeah, there you go. Okay, pick somebody that wants

Unknown Speaker  34:16
the far right listen. Yeah. Why don't we got an Ask prompt? Well, yeah, but you

Unknown Speaker  34:24
got to do it on that report, don't you?

Matthias Miller  34:31
By the way, did you do you replicate the menu for each of these?

Speaker 2  34:35
Yeah. Sir, an easier way to do that. That's painful. Well,

Unknown Speaker  34:44
how else do you keep it over there?

Unknown Speaker  34:58
Are you not replicating the menu You

Unknown Speaker  35:01
know every time

Unknown Speaker  35:03
you're just going in and coming back

Speaker 2  35:06
something else I was thinking about let me check something here on

Unknown Speaker  35:33
there's something called the Detail Report menu I had a start recently I wondered if we could use this

Unknown Speaker  35:53
see

Unknown Speaker  36:07
Come on buddy

Unknown Speaker  36:29
that's what it Is

Unknown Speaker  37:17
this would be a

Unknown Speaker  37:36
then we'd have to have we'd have opportunities quotes

Matthias Miller  38:03
I think basically what what we could have is a way to have a menu on top

Speaker 2  38:08
of these reports that would show up on most of the reports

Unknown Speaker  38:41
just like the idea of needing to clone the menu for every single one

Unknown Speaker  38:54
now we couldn't have the.

Unknown Speaker  39:38
Good we

Unknown Speaker  39:44
that sounds interesting,

Unknown Speaker  39:45
do tell.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Instead of clicking links, you would select a row and it changes visibility in the sub pane.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
So

Unknown Speaker  40:10
okay what

Matthias Miller  40:11
is this new thing that we're doing that brick and mortar teams we got online sales team if we create a new hub what are we going to call it

Unknown Speaker  40:28
CRM portal

Unknown Speaker  40:34
yeah but it's not just CRM

Unknown Speaker  40:40
sales portal

Unknown Speaker  40:42
sales portal Tao you're cooking

Unknown Speaker  40:46
yeah it's empty no it is okay

Unknown Speaker  40:55
okay yes I know repeat list item yes I know things start yelling at you exactly let's actually go here you

Speaker 1  41:15
never actually you'd actually never go anywhere you're just proposing changing what's in the sub pain

Unknown Speaker  41:21
yeah I'm here let's do this this is easy

Unknown Speaker  41:41
let's make our lives even easier where we replace every

Unknown Speaker  41:57
okay and we do with a

Unknown Speaker  42:16
and a comma

Unknown Speaker  42:41
well that was done

Unknown Speaker  42:59
didn't know when you have a true developer when he is so lazy he'll spend twice as long twice as long doing it the automated way when it's doing me my what Okay, so then we've got these maybe

Unknown Speaker  43:27
we should use a list because if we hadn't list then it would be okay let's do this

Speaker 1  43:33
do me a favor change that change that stupid and let it that was supposed to be 1.1 but it doesn't work changes to 01 Same as the first one

Unknown Speaker  43:42
looks stupid there we go it bothered me

Speaker 1  43:49
every time I open that list and look at it and yet it never went and did anything about it

Unknown Speaker  43:55
this is the

Speaker 2  44:21

Speaker 2  52:55
opportunities contact report opportunities new weeds is an editable report all possible must match these attributes well

Unknown Speaker  53:21
you have a qualifying column

Speaker 1  53:31
Yeah. Somebody asked for a way to qualify that thing without having to go into it just clicking

Unknown Speaker  53:41
that checkbox it is here we give them a qualified button of course

Unknown Speaker  54:00
I never thought about doing them that way

Unknown Speaker  54:24
because she's gone

Unknown Speaker  54:31
Can you make it can you make it can you put it in the row?

Unknown Speaker  54:34
Can you make it a row action? Your return?

Unknown Speaker  54:57
Okay, and then How do I do a

Unknown Speaker  55:07
there's a separate suppress

Unknown Speaker  55:24
to blank to suppress okay never mind Hey Scott T let's qualify you boom bring back okay

Unknown Speaker  55:44
all right how you

Speaker 1  55:45
doing? So but can you put it in like like in a column like

Unknown Speaker  55:53
oh qualify

Speaker 1  55:55
yeah probably they could just just just add it just leave it leave it

Unknown Speaker  56:06
no I don't think I can

Unknown Speaker  56:16
as a button

Speaker 1  56:21
Oh remove your remove your remove your your your your contents

Unknown Speaker  56:30
just do a parenthesis parenthesis whatever it

Unknown Speaker  56:35
is keep calling in parenthesis

Matthias Miller  56:39
yeah but you can't run this type of action from here

Unknown Speaker  56:48
thank you

Unknown Speaker  56:55
you have so I mean I'm gonna guess you're gonna want it

Unknown Speaker  57:03
up here

Unknown Speaker  57:06
so you can't do like my new communication button

Matthias Miller  57:10
well not unless you want to open up a new opportunity detail screen with check where they can hit save and do it that way

Unknown Speaker  57:24
well

Speaker 1  57:25
okay, so if you went back to where you hit it on the thing on the left hand side with the plus button you probably I'll just put some kind of header some preface documentation says to qualify yourself otherwise it looks like it disappeared

Unknown Speaker  57:59
that's Genki

Unknown Speaker  58:13
you can't name

Unknown Speaker  58:14
that that plus column can you nope

Speaker 1  58:27
oh what is Wait a minute just put in put in what have you put a small column right beside the plus and then call it that call it qualified and I don't know put an arrow to the to the point England

Unknown Speaker  58:50
that's that's hideous as it was this is kind of funny though. Call it qualify

Unknown Speaker  59:14
make it I don't

Unknown Speaker  59:15
know that looks that looks hilarious

Unknown Speaker  59:25
Oh man. I say do this.

Speaker 1  59:30
Take it take take out that that column. The only person that that asked for the field qualify it from here was ginger and I'll just tell her where it is.

Unknown Speaker  59:40
Okay, brilliant. This one is like this again. Alright, let's try

Speaker 1  59:47
what happened to my what happened to my new communication column.

Unknown Speaker  59:52
Did you want it? I think I just put just

Unknown Speaker  59:55
put in the just put in a

Unknown Speaker  59:57
whoops. Hey, Is

Matthias Miller  1:00:02
No wonder I got messed up somewhere else

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
and just shrink it down and wrap it

Speaker 2  1:00:09
wrap it around a year ago okay going back here charities and opportunities qualified opportunities is inevitable report brick and mortar opportunities brick and mortar opportunities as proms openings opportunities ginger come on ginger opportunity so we get to qualify again closer

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
there's a way to that too.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
How about how about you just

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
remove it okay I'm happy

Unknown Speaker  1:01:17
three levels of water paints are supported well

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
opportunity's new leads okay hang on I am getting so wildly confused here

Unknown Speaker  1:01:53
he's qualified quoted

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
yeah hold on a second new leads

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
let's go through the contact report

Unknown Speaker  1:02:12
brick mortar yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
what was the hang up

Unknown Speaker  1:02:31
because too many of those

Unknown Speaker  1:02:34
yeah nested too deep

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41
so do this

Speaker 1  1:02:42
to go put the Go put while no you're you're going are you going all right hands on this

Unknown Speaker  1:02:50
we're gonna say you can put

Speaker 1  1:02:51
the type for the there's no reason for that one to be three that that really should be a stack right in the middle

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
so the the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
the communication itself should be read or need the opportunity

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
but that was that would screw up your concept

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
maybe fine just try this

Speaker 1  1:03:29
wait did you did you Oh no no no we were going to remember we were going to do this to you we're gonna do this to wait we had talked about doing this to like when you click opportunities it takes you to a report of both detail screen and the communication when you when you launch

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
Okay, let's try this so we're gonna go

Speaker 1  1:03:59
and then and then we were going to kill the contacts and opportunities the CRM opportunities just gonna become the new screen

Unknown Speaker  1:04:09
as promotes you to beta way from beta okay, so now promoted you to alpha. Alpha you are alpha. You got to you've got

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
to what are those things called the stupid little quotations?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
Great quote.

Speaker 1  1:04:30
I think you have a quote thing go back to where you were wherever you were. I don't know where you were.

Speaker 2  1:04:35
Okay, well we need to do first we need to ask prompt NO those the list is fine. It was just when it was the confirmation was weird.

Speaker 1  1:04:51
Oh, do you mean Oh, you'll be able to have one ask prompt to rule them all.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Now you're cooking with some gas

Matthias Miller  1:05:05
well there's a rule of three but the time you built it three times you know what you want so should be about right opportunities new leads, Insight opportunities,

Speaker 2  1:05:15
new leads asked prompts ask a salesperson

Matthias Miller  1:05:22
Okay, let's be consistent we don't know whether this drives me crazy too. Is it a salesperson? Is it a sales rep?

Speaker 1  1:05:29
We call them sales reps don't we? Yeah, go fix them all for sales reps because that's what we call them on the menu.

Matthias Miller  1:05:36
I don't want to fix them all because we're going to

Unknown Speaker  1:05:39
whatever be consistent with it then

Unknown Speaker  1:05:43
I'm going to do sales rep going

Matthias Miller  1:05:44
forward but until we I don't know there's reports that link to it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
and I don't know let's do this where there should be sales rep versus salesperson Okay, so now ginger we're gonna pick on you again bye boom pains

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
to 110 Well that's

Speaker 1  1:06:31
it big bucks for a little tiny device. Oh no, it's not a tiny device

Unknown Speaker  1:06:34
the basketball that'd be five

Matthias Miller  1:06:39
is not right. Pixels

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
I'm so confused why that's good that's nowhere near to your pixels anyway. Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
Let's do 100 pixels

Unknown Speaker  1:06:57
default pain sizes you have got to be kidding me

Matthias Miller  1:07:15
on Main on winter recess Oh come

Unknown Speaker  1:07:17
on. Really me

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32
250 Wait, why don't you

Speaker 1  1:07:36
you know what if you can't you wrap the first the first pain and and so that notion are actually can we make can we make it to where it's only the width of figs and lat buildings? And the notion can just like wrap FC

Unknown Speaker  1:07:53
Yes, Mark that thing in

Unknown Speaker  1:08:03
I like now I like it

Matthias Miller  1:08:06
and then here what we can do is

Unknown Speaker  1:08:24
we don't Tinker

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
oh you Okay, well, we lost the logo. I can't thumbnail it well maybe we could add a row for it. Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
wait, the thumbnail things might work in the preface.

Speaker 2  1:08:56
Now it just says picture tornado it's just happened oops that's me. I'm screwing stuff up.

Matthias Miller  1:09:09
This thing is I would love to turn that thing off completely it pops up

Unknown Speaker  1:09:13
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
okay, now why are you not gonna be something just screwed up

Unknown Speaker  1:09:29
Oh, you have to have the heading. Well, thank you to select a row

Matthias Miller  1:09:38
Well, that's kind of stupid. Okay. So now let's do

Speaker 2  1:09:44
insight can be copy I need like a

Speaker 2  1:10:02
brick and mortar teams copy contact

Speaker 1  1:10:16
oh goodness chemical chemical fix the BBS salesperson because that's ridiculous

Matthias Miller  1:10:23
Well, what we should do is make copies of each of these in our new cockpit.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:28
Agreed. Agreed agreed agreed agreed. So maybe we

Matthias Miller  1:10:31
should go do that now.

Speaker 1  1:10:33
Let's just keep that don't don't don't get off in the squirrel and

Unknown Speaker  1:10:38
recent sales I'm gonna guess that he's the same way hey

Unknown Speaker  1:10:48
yeah cuz some of this stuff comes from when Josh built some of these

Unknown Speaker  1:10:54
that one configs a lot buildings sales and quotes not sure why those aren't where are these not showing up in question oh because these ones don't have some pains okay shipping calculator brick home page

Speaker 1  1:11:13
and you can't you can't hide a sub pain if it's not something in it

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
I guess it's gonna be

Matthias Miller  1:11:21
it's gonna it's gonna be there for everybody

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
all right, let me get to figure out we got to figure out the

Unknown Speaker  1:11:27
that one

Unknown Speaker  1:11:34
we can't get

Speaker 1  1:11:37
in the middle of can the middle have a side by side and then go side by side now?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
No like we can't

Speaker 1  1:11:44
make the you can't go for what can we wait it's column plus pains isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
configurator configurator is going to be

Matthias Miller  1:12:12
that one's gonna be a tricky one.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
So is the dealer Resource Center

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
Well, dealer Resource Center we should shove into the wiki

Unknown Speaker  1:12:23
migrate all that stuff across Yeah, but that's big project. don't disagree

Matthias Miller  1:12:35
Yeah, that's also project I can say.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
Hey, Roderick, can I take your time for the next few weeks

Speaker 1  1:12:51
Wait Wait Good good. Okay, go back to sales and quotes

Speaker 1  1:12:59
okay, we still have a quotes page is not responding

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
Yeah, but this doesn't have something

Unknown Speaker  1:13:09
Yeah, so you got to put the quotes into this one

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
Yeah, so we want to do this it was in there wasn't it

Unknown Speaker  1:13:30
oh the problem was with this one because we have no because here

Unknown Speaker  1:13:59
Why are you not

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
I'm confused

Unknown Speaker  1:14:09
by the other ones confused to me too.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:12
Why is I mean it should show up something.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:36
Well, I'm kind of scared of screwing up the

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
well, I don't really want to see this

Unknown Speaker  1:14:46
cop. Make a copy of the copy.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
Okay, so this one

Speaker 2  1:15:00
The Sales portal

Speaker 1  1:15:14
Wait Can we can we win I know okay the main Never mind never mind doing this so completely different

Unknown Speaker  1:15:50
to recent sales now this would be

Speaker 2  1:16:09
recent sales okay now we got recent sales and then we need but still not

Unknown Speaker  1:16:17
showing up open quotes copy

Matthias Miller  1:16:20
well I haven't added the subject in yet

Unknown Speaker  1:16:25
so what do you want us to say open quotes

Speaker 1  1:16:28
yeah but you can copy over you should copy it over and reappropriated like you were like you copy the watch McCall it over

Speaker 2  1:16:45
yep you should update the app prompts to do

Unknown Speaker  1:17:06
and change out the list name to be the correct one

Unknown Speaker  1:17:11
yep yep spaces are not allowed

Unknown Speaker  1:17:26
a

Unknown Speaker  1:17:35
pain that's a pain

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
it does not like you Why would it not show a pain

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
that is completely beyond me

Speaker 2  1:18:01
Is there a way to suppress sub paint in a way maybe this does not make sense

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
now let's do this why would that make any difference

Unknown Speaker  1:18:44
sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:18:59
like

Unknown Speaker  1:19:10
What is your deal? Does it have

Speaker 1  1:19:14
doesn't have any to do with the updates I wouldn't have anything to do with the update builder notes X 30 things now that wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  1:19:23
I can't imagine

Unknown Speaker  1:19:30
let's try this

Unknown Speaker  1:19:40
like literally it's not showing it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02
I am beyond confused

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
you're sure hate me if I don't fill it in right malady that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:32
causes an animal report

Unknown Speaker  1:20:47
that work was it editable reporting

Unknown Speaker  1:21:00
okay but then this guy well I think it was let's go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  1:21:03
get go don't back out remove your your

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
Why won't it still show in there

Unknown Speaker  1:21:14
like as a standalone report why

Unknown Speaker  1:21:15
wouldn't show I have no idea

Unknown Speaker  1:21:20
that is the weirdest

Matthias Miller  1:21:25
I don't get paid enough to figure that out

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
I really want to fix this double thing on the side thing I don't know what what can we do I know what it's the CRM opportunities one but

Unknown Speaker  1:21:39
CRM opportunities okay so here

Speaker 1  1:21:42
Can we go can open up the open up the middle one there and let's see if we can stack them three wide

Unknown Speaker  1:21:48
now oh

Speaker 2  1:22:06
no no we can we don't want that but no

Speaker 1  1:22:20
All right I'm wondering if we just go to two paints and we just group the qualifies included

Unknown Speaker  1:22:39
is kind of a slick little

Unknown Speaker  1:23:03
I'm sorry I'm getting distracted

Matthias Miller  1:23:07
I mean if you don't have a lot in the qualified section yeah but you also don't I mean this makes sure that the top in each section

Unknown Speaker  1:23:15
is at the top

Speaker 1  1:23:16
alright change to I don't know change to anybody who you on right now ginger change to

Unknown Speaker  1:23:24
I don't know America's Victoria

Unknown Speaker  1:23:31
yeah see that's where she's got a bunch of

Unknown Speaker  1:23:33
qualified

Matthias Miller  1:23:36
you but what's the harm with having it like that?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:39
Oh, it just looks janky I can create a big smiley face that we can put in here

Speaker 1  1:23:53
if the report is that they just put it put the logo over there

Matthias Miller  1:24:01
I mean not really worth the work but we could

Unknown Speaker  1:24:07
Okay, is it okay on these if we just have a

Matthias Miller  1:24:13
blank basically a blank report that open says you know open

Unknown Speaker  1:24:18
what have you put those across the top as buttons across the top? Can you do buttons across the top that drive you up to URLs?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:28
Sure, Bob. Buttons. can figure eater web URL we used to have this joke about Amish guy who makes website addresses. Makes Weber so he's the Earl Weaver. lame. Lame. Okay, dealer or whereas

Unknown Speaker  1:25:07
yours you just call this notion

Unknown Speaker  1:25:11
called dealer Resource Center just leave the notion off

Unknown Speaker  1:25:18
or come back and just call it Resource Center be fair and about the dealer and notions

Speaker 2  1:25:31
over here sales or sales no portal menu wait happened sales did I do that is a good question what

Unknown Speaker  1:25:55
did you do

Speaker 2  1:25:58
know had this sales cockpit menu I don't know what just happened it was on an old list or something I don't know okay so we don't need the configurator we don't need you

Speaker 1  1:26:17
alright then we're missing we're missing that well then then to do should be number one

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
well I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:26:36
what is the SP non breaking space what does that mean?

Matthias Miller  1:26:44
It means it basically it looks like a space but it's not technically a space so it doesn't get trimmed away

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59
nice big silly person

Unknown Speaker  1:27:06
bigger Well fine. I mean this is the know should be the notion guy should be the configurator guy okay configurator Resource Center so module look at at

Speaker 1  1:27:37
Gerson quotes does that when you go to Sales and quotes I guess yeah, that button shows up then they update the runners Yeah, okay. Yep, yep, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
But then we also need the morrow today you can well yeah, you need that too

Unknown Speaker  1:28:05
I do have a couple minutes

Unknown Speaker  1:28:10
does it have to go buy a new truck whenever Addison rolls in here then we're going to go to Winston and buy two more trucks

Speaker 2  1:28:33

Unknown Speaker  1:30:13
it up we're gonna do this

Unknown Speaker  1:30:22
I wonder if I have to go in

Speaker 2  1:30:42
it's a reasonable place to have it we

Unknown Speaker  1:30:52
shouldn't took

Unknown Speaker  1:30:53
credit for it then I can smile

Speaker 2  1:30:59
record sound message Minister see it's backwards being

Unknown Speaker  1:31:11
you

Unknown Speaker  1:31:21
okay so this one was portal recent sales

Unknown Speaker  1:31:36
CDB affordable bind

Speaker 2  1:31:45
no you can't see what I'm doing user scared brick and mortar sales copy records sold recently we go to the sales portal sales portal homepage see if that did it

Unknown Speaker  1:32:31
so what did you do? file server so it's it's not something I have access to. Nook

Matthias Miller  1:32:47

Unknown Speaker  1:32:55
how can you edit that without actually doing an update?

Speaker 2  1:32:59
What's the user it's a user logged into our server

Matthias Miller  1:33:04
it's a user report. So I entered it on disk on the server.

Speaker 1  1:33:09
And this is where I begin to wonder what other magic is over there on that disk. It's kind of like my it's kind of like my wife whenever whenever you know she needs to move some finances around and she's like, Oh, I just need to move some finances and I just look at it and go ooh from those offshore accounts that you have What Else is in This offshore

Speaker 2  1:33:27

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11
anywhere else where

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11
it's in their recent sales and does the exact same thing

Unknown Speaker  1:46:15
I'd say we get rid of that pain and every year to dues

Unknown Speaker  1:46:35
This is what happens when children don't follow directions they did not say leave by 430

Unknown Speaker  1:46:41
and being here by 430 Oh well that means we just get more time to get more of this done

Unknown Speaker  1:51:30

Matthias Miller  1:51:42
We're gonna have to make sure they've got permission to access all of this stuff and

Speaker 2  1:51:45
Right, right, right, right, right

Matthias Miller  1:51:53
Okay, so we now have your brick and mortars covered right

Unknown Speaker  1:51:56

Matthias Miller  1:52:01
So the only thing that's left now is the

Speaker 1  1:52:05
white ones there a platform limitation of only three Why

Unknown Speaker  1:52:12
can't you go edit the server somewhere?

Matthias Miller  1:52:16
The server I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:18
Why is there a platform limitation of three wide I can't be the only one who wanted to go forward. I have no yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:52:29
That's question for Josh and his next call with you.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:33
Why is there a platform limitation for three wide besides just edit the server and make it four wide

Matthias Miller  1:52:46
careful wiki is there reason nobody else has access to the wiki? I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:54
I just never did it because I never went spend enough time to go look at it

Speaker 1  1:53:06
how do you how do you how do you know what they have access and what they don't have access to? I guess it's a matter of what you put in there. Is that it? Does the whole the whole menu show up for them?

Unknown Speaker  1:53:18
No, we should limit this.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:21
Alright, I gotta drop.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:23
