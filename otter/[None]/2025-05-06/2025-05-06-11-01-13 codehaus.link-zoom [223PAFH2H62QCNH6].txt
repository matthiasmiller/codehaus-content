Matthias Miller  00:33
Hello, hello. All right, well, on the, I mean, this is like just jumping deep end, I guess, but on the verification we're going to need domain access, which is one of the reasons why we're doing this. Fair

Speaker 1  00:55
enough, let's see. Well, I'm feeling a little lightheaded, which is what I was afraid would happen, but I think I'm sure mostly it's okay. I'm just kind of trying to hang on through this meeting. So what, what can I do to I mean, you want to just kind of run it, and you can just kind of assign me things as we go along. I think so

Matthias Miller  01:18
were you, did you get the error when you were trying to log

Speaker 1  01:21
okay. So I went, I was trying to log into Gmail, just to kind of see I haven't tried to log into the calendar. Let me see.com Okay, so if I log into Gmail or calendar, it redirects me to to this screen, which is the Admin Console, and it wants me to do that so I can't do anything until we overcome that barrier. All right. I

Unknown Speaker  02:03
Okay, let's see.

Matthias Miller  02:25
Let me see if I can log into Wix with this thing, as it is. Okay, good. So Wix would be under the same if we can, then let me start with some copy or something. Okay, sure. Sure it just does.

Matthias Miller  03:01
No, it does not. Everything goes over to the head man, which means we need the verification. So we're using Gmail to mean host.

Speaker 1  03:15
What do you usually use for AI logo design? Is that something I can

Matthias Miller  03:20
I was using chat GPT, and I had some here. Let me, let me, actually, was recently saying, I said I fed it the original logo, okay, and then, and then told it to add a lean to, and the lean to like the front profile isn't quite right. Let me see we can find this link to here's the problem with being prolific with chat, GPT is hard to find your chat. No, that is. And on top of that, playing around with other logos and requests like, okay, copy image here. Let's do this. I'm gonna do we have a mic, a folder

Speaker 1  04:09
in G Drive. Yeah, we should hold on.

Matthias Miller  04:17
I have one view the here. To stick to the link I'll drop.

Speaker 1  04:27
Okay. I mean, I have one that's mostly my is that the client folder that you have? It's my client folder that makes sense. I've got one that's sort of my working documents, which I should maybe put stuff in. Okay, okay.

Matthias Miller  04:45
So the biggest, the biggest thing, okay, so there's, there's the choice buildings. Now the colors, we're not going to use blue on it. I forget what, what exactly we need to use. Oh, I see the PMT, okay. Okay. So this is. I should probably rename this, but these are just chat GPT exports. Okay? And then he was actually pretty happy with us.

Unknown Speaker  05:08
This one right here. Well, this is, that's his existing

Matthias Miller  05:11
one that he uses inspiration. Okay, here, let me do the alright. So let me

Speaker 1  05:19
Rocky Mountain structures. Okay, there's another one coming. Gonna rename these.

Matthias Miller  05:24
There you go. Come on, aren't you uploading?

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Okay, Rocky Mountain structures. Rename.

Matthias Miller  05:43
Then this one's the one with the lean to so the profile is right. But if we would just fix the profile and then fix the colors, like, that's pretty close to what we need.

Unknown Speaker  05:56
What do you mean the Profile we're like, I mean

Matthias Miller  06:00
the proportions of the lean to aren't

Unknown Speaker  06:03
aren't correct,

Matthias Miller  06:07
right? And Do you happen to have any engineering documents or any like, it'd be great if there'd be, like, a front engineering view or something that would show us we could say, no, go, use these dimensions instead. Or this kind of, Oh, okay. Do you happen to have anything like that or not, really?

Speaker 1  06:26
Maybe I'm thinking, Okay, let me see. Let me see what I can find.

Unknown Speaker  06:37
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:38
let me see if I can work on this, and then

Matthias Miller  06:42
I'll let you go. Well,

Unknown Speaker  06:55
yeah, should I ping him?

Matthias Miller  06:58
Mica comment, we are ready to get started, and we are needing access to your domain registrar to keep moving forward.

Matthias Miller  07:11
Wow, you really did not Oh, I'm bound to

Matthias Miller  07:19
Micah, we are getting started, and we are needing access to your domain registrar to move forward.

Speaker 1  07:31
How about I just use the 3d builder to to do something, and then, Yeah, sure,

Matthias Miller  07:37
yes. Okay.

Speaker 1  08:01
You only want one lean to or you want them both, I assume, right? I

Matthias Miller  08:06
don't know what's most popular. I mean, if both is most popular, then why not?

Speaker 1  08:19
Well, it makes it more symmetrical for design purposes, for a logo, I guess I don't know what that does, what the other what The end goal would be, Besides that, but

Unknown Speaker  08:27
sure, I

Matthias Miller  09:15
uh, Significant.

Unknown Speaker  09:21
Did you ever find your chat?

Matthias Miller  09:22
Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  09:28
Okay, yep, found it.

Matthias Miller  09:34
Assuming. Okay, so he says he uses wick stack, so he didn't switch over the Wix, but he's on the Do we have a Gmail login for him,

Unknown Speaker  09:52
like his current one, you mean, or

Matthias Miller  09:58
whatever, anything besides the sales at.

Speaker 1  10:01
I have, well, he's got a, yeah, he's got an email address, but I don't know how to log into it, so no, I would say no, he's got that, like Mike's biz at Gmail. That's the only other email address I have for him.

Matthias Miller  10:12
We are needing domain registration for your new domain, so we are not able to get into Wix. I

Matthias Miller  10:25
Are we in the wrong meeting? He's in a Oh, is he

Speaker 1  10:27
in a different meeting? I don't know. I clicked what was in the invite that I sent him. Let me double check he's in a room. He's not.

Matthias Miller  10:38
Oh, there he is. There he is. Okay.

Speaker 2  10:52
Hey, Micah, hey, hey, there second I forgot to connect my headset to this. Okay. Griff, you

Speaker 2  11:48
can you hear me? Yes, we hear you. Okay, the other stat is better for blocking out the kids and stuff, but this will work. Okay,

Matthias Miller  12:00
all right, so first thing we need is Rocky Mountain metal needs to be needs domain verification with with your domain registrar. So options are either, if I know where your domains registered, I that username and password, Squarespace, okay, and

Unknown Speaker  12:22
I and

Matthias Miller  12:24
then, do you want to add the information or join? Join me to have your Squarespace login? I

Unknown Speaker  12:51
thank you.

Unknown Speaker  13:34
How are you feeling about a logo that looks like that? I

Speaker 2  13:44
I like it. Um, since choice buildings USA is kind of the same thing. Do we want to go with the same colors and everything? Or should we do something a little different? Or what do

Speaker 1  13:53
you Yeah, did we want to change the colors on this? I think Matthias had said that, but I wasn't sure what the colors were going

Matthias Miller  13:59
to be. Yeah, we can pull them off the wicks website, once we get in, I would think, okay,

Unknown Speaker  14:02
but the logo itself is looking pretty good.

Matthias Miller  14:09
Do the do the lead two seem to be proportionally narrower? Or is that the right proportion?

Speaker 1  14:17
It's a similar proportion to what I fed into. Yeah. What do you think? Micah,

Speaker 2  14:24
yeah, I'm trying to think. The other thing is, like, since we go, since we're going with Rocky Mountain metal for the website, do we want to go Rocky Mountain metal buildings or something like that, or instead of Rocky Mountain structures, okay,

Unknown Speaker  14:45
yep,

Matthias Miller  14:47
yep. Okay, so under this point, it's probably easier to take this out and put it into Canva. That's what

Speaker 1  14:56
I was about to do. I mean, as long as we're good with this lean to proportion. In the building structure, I can take it and put it in Canvas. Okay,

Speaker 2  15:03
could we do a little more with the mountains, like, make the mountain more prominent, like the way it looks there. It's almost just like a weird lightning bolt or something.

Speaker 1  15:14
Yeah, let me see if I can find a better mountain. I might be able to get that done better in Canva too, but I'll work on it. Okay, all right, thanks.

Unknown Speaker  15:22
Are you okay? If I share here, go for it.

Speaker 2  15:34
So here are and I can give you access to this if you need it, but

Matthias Miller  15:40
I don't know that. I do. We just need to get this in there.

Unknown Speaker  15:46
Here's a rocky mountain metal, yep,

Matthias Miller  15:48
if you hop into there and then manage domain, yep. Then DNS the left, under further left, so there's the further left, there's the dashboard of domains, but under the Domains list, there's overview, and then there's DNS here, like to the left, a little further, and up a little bit, down a little bit. Oh, that guy, yep. And then add record. And then hosting lead blank. Type would be txt. Type, yep, priority doesn't matter. TTL, I would probably shorten up a little bit 30 minutes or an hour or 30 minutes is fine, and then, and then, copy and paste. There's a value that I put in the chat. Just copy and paste that whole thing, Google Site verification. I

Unknown Speaker  17:27
I'm not seeing your chat

Matthias Miller  17:31
in a text message. I could send it over by text too, if you like,

Speaker 2  17:38
the chat should be I'm under team chat, but nothing. It shows there's nothing there.

Matthias Miller  17:54
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  17:55
Okay, either way,

Matthias Miller  18:00
if you got your, if you got messages on your on there, you can, oh,

Unknown Speaker  18:17
meeting, chats.

Matthias Miller  18:23
Might be, might be a chat. Not quite sure where it would be.

Unknown Speaker  18:29
See every time I It says I need to add a i

Matthias Miller  18:44
I wonder if there's A way

Matthias Miller  18:52
clipboard, sharing, access, sorry, can you do? I i

Matthias Miller  19:18
got it all right, sweet, so drop that

Unknown Speaker  19:22
verification. Do I click on that or copy and page you

Matthias Miller  19:25
want to copy and paste that and then put it in that text column or that text box in the right yep, and I hit save,

Unknown Speaker  19:37
but host at

Matthias Miller  19:41
like the simple, yep, save.

Matthias Miller  19:56
All right, I'm.

Matthias Miller  20:04
Activate Gmail sheet with activation All right, so then we need hit another Add Record,

Matthias Miller  20:20
and then the host would be add again, the type would be MX,

Unknown Speaker  20:30
and M, around,

Matthias Miller  20:32
M, MX, yep. And then priorities, one,

Matthias Miller  20:45
time to just be a one one, however it takes it. I

Matthias Miller  21:04
Yep. And then the smtp@google.com that I sent over

Unknown Speaker  21:11
the chat, same just paste the same thing.

Matthias Miller  21:14
No, it's a new it's SMTP, okay, dot.google.com,

Unknown Speaker  21:22
then need to.at the end? It doesn't matter.

Matthias Miller  21:24
I don't know. I would put it in because it's in there, but I don't know if it matters.

Speaker 2  21:32
Save it, yep, enter valid mails. Okay, take the dot

Matthias Miller  21:36
off. Fair. It shows it on mine, and I have no idea why, like, it's in the box, but

Speaker 2  21:42
Okay, someone double spaced at the end.

Matthias Miller  21:47
So All right, so now let's try logging into Wix with the

Matthias Miller  22:00
Yeah. Okay. Now, are you able in your Wix account? Are you able to switch it over to the sales email address? I

Matthias Miller  22:23
it probably be the top right if you hit the Yeah or settings, there you go, or under your account.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
So so invite, what was the locker? Mount Miller, right,

Matthias Miller  23:00
yep, that's right.

Matthias Miller  23:16
Do you want to? Do you need the other person who's on the account? No, so just sit back and kick them off.

Matthias Miller  23:36
There you go. There you go. Okay, I

Matthias Miller  24:10
website manager should be all that's needed. I

Matthias Miller  24:34
All right, so let me see if I

Matthias Miller  24:57
Okay, why would you collab? Rate except the invite.

Matthias Miller  25:11
See

Unknown Speaker  25:14
you find my water thing is probably in my bedroom. I

Matthias Miller  25:24
All right, the other thing that we could, that you could work on too, is if you go under Setup, connecting the domain, that's the other thing that would need to be done in Squarespace,

Matthias Miller  25:41
like if you go, sorry, if you go to Wix, go to Wix and hit the set of tab, and there's a connected domain, custom domain, and that's the process you'll need to work through. Where would that be? See all the way at the top setup, right there, and then, yep,

Unknown Speaker  26:10
right in here. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  26:11
put it in there, and then hit, let's go. I

Unknown Speaker  26:28
like that.

Matthias Miller  26:30
Yep, and then should give you breathing. I

Matthias Miller  26:43
Oh, here's wanting you to upgrade to premium in order to connect the custom domain. I'm

Matthias Miller  27:06
now what it needs, it's, it's wanting you to upgrade to a premium account in order to get the get connected to a custom domain. I choose the premium that's right for you.

Speaker 2  27:36
Advanced marketing suite is that anything we want, like in the $80 one

Matthias Miller  27:45
i don't know i i right off the top of my head, I'd say probably the answer is, No, we don't need it. I don't even know what all it involves.

Unknown Speaker  27:59
You think the business would be good 18.

Matthias Miller  28:04
Let's see collaborator site analytics. Like honestly, we don't need payments or anything. I'm going to guess. I would expect the core of the lights going to be just fine for what we need, because we're going to be using other things, high level for lead forms and stuff. So,

Matthias Miller  28:34
okay,

Speaker 2  28:39
is there any reason why we would want to take the website off of Wix at some point in the next couple years, or is just being on Wix? Is that going to be fine?

Matthias Miller  28:51
Um, I don't know the answer to that. I mean, yeah, it is possible. I mean, it would typically evolve. I mean, it will involve a website rebuild. Biggest thing would be the biggest drivers. Probably, probably biggest drivers is if there ends up being some kind of load speed issue or or if you get to the point where you want to really do a major rebrand,

Speaker 2  29:19
okay, I had built a website that's been six, eight years ago, using GoDaddy. And it was easy and simple, and I was happy with it. But when I had a guy do a while, he's supposed to do website for me, he's screwed. He was pretty short, but he made fun of GoDaddy, and Bill wanted me to we have to do something else, and I don't want to buy two years or whatever here, if it's something

Matthias Miller  29:48
that, yeah, I think a year to times better. They want to lock you in on savings. And I just, I don't know, all right. I. Color website. So dry message, you the background color that we're using, but I'm guessing we could just do a transparent pink, or that's the that is the off white that we're using, that you could use for the logo foreground. Let me just. Let me just.

Matthias Miller  30:32
Just be two x3

Speaker 1  30:42
I so wait the off white that we're using, you want to use that for the background? Actually, hang on.

Matthias Miller  30:49
That's not quite the right one. Well, this is, that's the color of the text on the website, and it's on a dark green background. So I would think that we could use that as the main logo color itself, and leave the like the what's currently white, what's currently white on blue, we could change to that color on a transparent background,

Unknown Speaker  31:21
the color of the text.

Matthias Miller  31:23
Change the color of the text to what I just pulled that up. So hold on. Okay.

Matthias Miller  31:37
The second color, I think, is actually,

Speaker 1  31:41
oh, that lighter blue is okay, the light I'm going to share this with you. This might be wrong because I'm confused. Oh, I can't screen share. The lighter one is the text, the darker one is the background.

Matthias Miller  31:57
No, the first one is, I think the wrong color, Oh, okay. The second one, I think is a more accurate color, Okay, gotcha. But the here I can send you the just so you can see, inspect this. Let me see if I can get

Speaker 1  32:27
you the what logo size? I mean, is it going to be a 500 by 500 square logo, or do you need a website banner logo? Well,

Matthias Miller  32:37
currently, the way it's set up right now is it has a 200 by 200 SVG. Okay, so everything just, I mean, I think, really, all we actually need is the symbol for this website design. Okay,

Speaker 1  32:53
well, I have some different mountain options. I've got a white logo on black right now that I'm working on, and then we could figure out, do you need the logo itself to be this blue color, or is that what we're looking at? I need to get that that is

Matthias Miller  33:11
what we're looking at. But we can also just try white, and it might be that, okay, White looks just fine, too. All

Speaker 1  33:18
right. Well, let me know when you have some time to screen share, and we can decide here on this logo, sure.

Matthias Miller  33:25
Okay, all right, so Michael, let me know if you need help with the connection you're in too. I

Matthias Miller  33:53
All right, well, let's go

Matthias Miller  34:03
go back into Wix

Matthias Miller  34:10
and

Matthias Miller  34:18
All right, so I'm gonna, I'm to, we're going to try multiple we're going to turn on multiple editors or multiple shares and see how this works. So this one here, this is the guy that we really need to I'm

Matthias Miller  34:47
need to replace the.

Matthias Miller  35:17
You see that? Audra,

Unknown Speaker  35:19
sorry, what am I looking at here?

Unknown Speaker  35:24
Connect to a domain.

Matthias Miller  35:26
This guy right here? Well, here I've got multiple shares turned on. So okay, make sure you get the right

Speaker 1  35:31
one. Connect to a domain. Yeah. So what are we looking at here?

Matthias Miller  35:36
Are you able to be able to see my share or not.

Speaker 1  35:40
Oh, Matthias Miller, quality builds, okay, I see it now. I think this is the website itself, yeah, okay. Oh, you just need that little that's it.

Matthias Miller  35:50
Like, I mean, that's it, okay.

Unknown Speaker  35:55
Is that the only place this logo is going to get used?

Matthias Miller  36:01
Well, presumably we're going to use a logo elsewhere, business cards and other types of things.

Speaker 1  36:05
No, that's fair, just checking, but I think this is what we need for the website. I think you probably want pure white, especially if it's going to be that size. Okay, which I can do, or which I have. Should I go ahead and share this with you guys too? Then,

Speaker 1  36:28
okay, so, okay, let me scroll up for a second. I've got, this is the original one, and then I've got a couple different types of mountains that we could maybe use. And then do we want it to be rocky mountain metal instead of Rocky Mountain structures?

Matthias Miller  36:50
Rocky Mountain metal buildings, okay,

Speaker 1  36:57
but we probably don't want that for the logo on top of the website, right? We probably just want

Matthias Miller  37:02
the image. We just want the image, right? Okay,

Speaker 1  37:05
Rocky Mountain, metal buildings. I can do that. Micah, do you have any sense of whether or not you like any of these mountain tops better than the original one? Sorry, they're a little small. I

Matthias Miller  37:20
some reason

Unknown Speaker  37:23
I'm not seeing what you're hearing.

Matthias Miller  37:25
Let's do it once, one share at a time.

Unknown Speaker  37:31
Yeah, click over.

Matthias Miller  37:32
Turn off your Oh, it's up at the top. Oh,

Speaker 1  37:40
there it is. Up at the top. There's a toggle view. I found it finally. It was kind of weird, but it worked. Yep, all right. Are you seeing it now? Gotcha. So this was the or this was the original.

Speaker 2  37:52
I like the one that's, yeah, I do like that a lot better you like and I actually like the black too. Yeah, I do. Okay, so number that one or the one, the five or seven, would be my pick. Five or seven? Yeah, 5172,

Unknown Speaker  38:09
okay, what do you think Matthias, I like five.

Matthias Miller  38:14
I think either one. I don't have a strong Okay, reference

Speaker 2  38:18
well and refine it. The one question I would have is, is there a way to make sure that in the building itself, the door is not like as prominent without doing a lot of work? Possibly,

Speaker 1  38:31
yeah, I might. I could figure that out. What do you mean? Just sort of have it lighter colored so it isn't well, just when I look

Speaker 2  38:42
at it, the building is all door. Like, there's a lot of white on there. It's very and it's the whole front wall is like, door,

Unknown Speaker  38:49
okay, smaller door.

Speaker 2  38:52
The what I would love to, not sure how To what I can do. I can text it. I

Speaker 1  39:31
pardon me, like this one, are you sending me a text? Text Message? Okay, new

Unknown Speaker  39:56
well, they just take forever to come through. I.

Matthias Miller  40:09
Let me do

Speaker 1  40:39
I Oh, I heard it. Let's see, maybe, maybe not. Okay. I don't have a text yet, but I could try to make it shows a scent on my end, but okay. I could try to make the door smaller. I can try to make it lighter. I mean, let

Matthias Miller  41:00
me just copy this over to chanty and well,

Matthias Miller  41:13
or,

Speaker 1  41:16
I mean, does it work if it's just lighter, that's that's a Quick thing that I could fix up better. But about

Speaker 2  41:24
something like that, let me just show you what I would it's like the main building that we use with, and I'm doing it on the 3d builder. I can send a screenshot over here, very sure.

Speaker 1  41:32
Yeah, that's what I did, actually. Was to give it a 3d builder screenshot and but I could probably ask it to make the door smaller, which is what I think we're going for here, huh?

Matthias Miller  41:47
Well, the this one here has has two two door, two garage doors.

Speaker 1  41:51
Oh, okay. Do you want two garage doors here? Let me turn this off, I'm sure. Well, for such a small logo, for design principles, you want to keep it as simple as possible. So are we talking about adding two doors? Or what are we talking about here? If

Matthias Miller  42:13
you add two doors, you don't want the lines filling it in that was so

Speaker 1  42:20
many No, maybe it's the lines that are causing the problem, but without the lines, it just looks like

Speaker 2  42:26
nothing, exactly. Is there a way to do more of a traditional barn door, like with x bracing or something like that? I mean, it is a logo. It's not our actual building.

Unknown Speaker  42:39
Yeah, might be able to just do that in Canva,

Unknown Speaker  42:50
let me see.

Speaker 1  42:54
Okay, well, this is silly, but I'm going to do something. I still don't have a text come through, what you're talking about. Oh,

Speaker 2  43:03
I send it on, you know what? I didn't send it you directly. I sent it to our group. Oh, is

Speaker 1  43:07
that the for some reason, my notifications on that are goofy. So maybe that's the problem.

Matthias Miller  43:15
Also dropped in chanty, if you want, if that helps? Sure, yeah, if

Unknown Speaker  43:19
you got it and I don't that might help.

Speaker 2  43:29
So I have a screenshot here. How would I share that with you on here, maybe under chat,

Matthias Miller  43:36
yeah, or if you just want to actually inbox, yeah. You could, you can, you can send files in chat

Speaker 1  43:44
that, oh, yeah, you did send this to me. So what are you looking for? Micah, you want the two doors, or now you want the you

Speaker 2  43:50
see how the in proportion? I don't know. That's just by far our most popular style, okay, and it is a little wider. The center part a little wider in comparison to the Lean twos.

Speaker 1  44:09
Okay, I don't am I sharing anything sure about? I mean, you want something like that is sort of a barn door type situation.

Speaker 2  44:17
I can't share this because it's restricted by the admin, okay,

Matthias Miller  44:25
they turn on all kinds of security controls that post tools.

Speaker 1  44:36
Well, this logo is going to be so small on the website that nobody is really going to be able to tell that detail now, when it comes to, like, business cards and stuff like, what are we, what are we trying to narrow in on here, in terms of

Speaker 2  44:48
actually here? I mean, I want to need it for everything going forward, right?

Speaker 1  44:52
So do you hate this barn door idea? Should we Nix that? I'd have to fix it actually. Bit, but I wasn't watching this. So okay, do you see do you see that now? Yeah, is that a little better or a little worse? To your mind? I

Unknown Speaker  45:13
think it's better. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  45:14
so we're

Speaker 2  45:15
on there doesn't look as busy. I'm not sure what that box is along the top on that door, but, well,

Speaker 1  45:20
it's just because I haven't fixed, I haven't fixed this. Oh god, you got it yet, right? I just kind of, I'm just kind of doing a quick

Unknown Speaker  45:27
and still attached to it. But yeah,

Speaker 1  45:31
yeah. So see what happens if we make it a little better. Still have to fix it, but that's a little better, yeah, how about that?

Speaker 2  45:46
I prefer that. Do you okay? I'm still not the box on top. I'm not sure what,

Speaker 1  45:54
what? Well, here just, let's just oops. I stole it from someone else's. I can get that off. I think I have to mess with it. But if you like that, let me work on it. Okay, and I'll do I'll do something better, and I'll let you guys get back to,

Unknown Speaker  46:14
back to work. Okay,

Speaker 2  46:20
so on here on my side, Matthias, it says that to get back here,

Speaker 2  46:34
time until domain is fully connected is up to 48 hours. You want me to go ahead and do it and just put all that over, connect metal to,

Matthias Miller  46:45
yeah, and it should take 48 hours, but I would go ahead and get that done just so that it's, it's squared away. I mean, with the Google stuff That's, it was Practically instant. So I

Speaker 2  50:19
I've got this done. What you need it? What do you need from me next?

Matthias Miller  50:26
The next thing would be, what information do you want in the quote, request,

Speaker 2  50:33
form, location, size, how soon they want it, okay, and maybe how they found out about me, yep, and then obviously, whatever contact info you think is good, I would think phone number, email,

Matthias Miller  50:55
yeah, I would agree. All right, let me go get that thrown together. Take a look at that. Do you

Matthias Miller  51:09
want anything as far as an about page, like a picture of you? Any bio, any about the company, anything like that.

Unknown Speaker  51:20
What do you think?

Matthias Miller  51:23
I mean to me, it's a good chance to talk about, hey, we're locally. We're located in Penrose. We're Colorado. Company, been here for, you know? Well, I mean, I don't know, maybe, maybe it's, you know, have that many years, but you know, any kind of, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:46
yeah, I think something like that is good.

Speaker 2  51:53
How important do you think it is for my picture? And it's like, I mean, I think having My experience on there might Be good.

Matthias Miller  52:06
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:38
Sad and

Unknown Speaker  52:49
I See

Matthias Miller  55:26
Would be fine just asking as a for a zip code as a location thing. Pardon is ZIP Code good enough just for location? Or do you want? Do you just want a free form text where they could fill in what?

Speaker 2  55:47
Oh, that way I got you Gotcha? Okay? All right, tell me a second, um, zip codes, fine. Okay. Is there a way on our end to where it automatically tells us where that's at.

Matthias Miller  56:05
There might be but I'm Not Sure I

Matthias Miller  58:32
So I

Matthias Miller  59:51
come on, you.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:07
You want to see the logo one more time. Sure. How's that looking for you?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
But good, okay,

Speaker 1  1:00:20
can I call that final and do variations of it?

Speaker 2  1:00:33
Yeah, I think so. Okay, sounds good. What do you guys think about it?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:37
I like it. I think it's pretty clean looking. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:00:44
the font on the Rocky Mountain metal buildings, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:48
we can change that up.

Speaker 2  1:00:52
Are they both the same? Is it just the size difference, or what the one looks bold? The top look bold. The

Speaker 1  1:00:57
top is bold. The bottom is not, and it's a little smaller, okay, but it is the same font. Would you like something different?

Speaker 2  1:01:08
Well, it messes with my eyes that there's different, so I think I don't think I want them bold, okay?

Speaker 2  1:01:22
Or both bold maybe. I'm not sure what font option do we have,

Speaker 1  1:01:28
infinite, almost, so it's a little hard. I could pull up. I could give you a couple maybe, to look at, and then, and then we could figure out. Boy, I'm not entirely sure what kind of fonts you like for this type of thing, something corporate.

Speaker 1  1:01:56
Let me give you like three options, and then We could pick some. I'll come back.

Matthias Miller  1:02:05
Okay, Start.

Matthias Miller  1:03:42
All right, well, let's at least this is not the it's not embedded into the website, but we can at least get a visual on the form. First Name, required, last name, optional phone, required phone, phone, email and zip. Why? Most of the rest, required phone, email, zip, how soon are you looking to buy and what Bill excited you're looking are you looking at? And then any additional information? Then we might change this, but have one or two consent to text, which are required for compliance purposes

Speaker 2  1:04:28
marketing and promotional messages. Is that something that they have to click to get the requested quote?

Matthias Miller  1:04:37
Yeah, typically what we've done here, let me see. It's actually go. Let me go. Jot this down, because I think there is a, I think there's language we can use that's we could have a single box. And

Speaker 2  1:04:57
I was just going to say, like for me, if I'm if. I just have one message. A lot of times I'll click it, but if I see that one that's specifically for marketing and stuff, if I'm comparing different companies, there are times I will not put it in, just because I don't want to get their stuff right. I don't know if it'd be a way to, you know, they don't have to click that box, but they can still request a quote. I feel like 95% of the people would click both of them without really looking at them anyhow. But let

Matthias Miller  1:05:29
me check something here. I think there's another client we can rip this off of.

Matthias Miller  1:05:40
They're not compliant. Did they take it back off?

Matthias Miller  1:05:50
Are you talking to me? No, well, yeah, no, I know there's language here. Let me go find where is this that's not The one I wanted. We'll get There. See sites, forms,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
Hey, Annie I

Matthias Miller  1:07:28
did we drop it down? I don't know that this is perfect, the perfectly final wording. I'll I'll hunt it down, but it's something like, you know, consent to receive text messages related to my quote questions, account orders or services I requested, mainly pricing appointment reminders or confirmation. Confirmations, account notifications.

Speaker 2  1:07:46
So, so when I was doing the Facebook ads with with a form, yeah, how soon are you looking to buy? I would have like, three or four different boxes they could check without, you know, ASAP. Or is that an option that we can do instead of, like, give someone an option instead of,

Matthias Miller  1:08:13
you know, oops,

Speaker 2  1:08:16
like, as soon as possible, within three months, within a year, or whatever, just kind of an idea,

Matthias Miller  1:08:23
yes, we can. I'm Going to go.

Matthias Miller  1:08:56
Go ahead and do

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
drop down,

Matthias Miller  1:09:12
so ASAP, within three months, I

Speaker 2  1:09:24
I'm assuming everyone knows what ASAP means, but maybe we should do as soon as possible

Matthias Miller  1:09:29
for sure, something like that. Sure, yeah, do you add anything longer than that after

Speaker 2  1:09:42
I'm not going to know. I'm not going I mean, if someone's farther out than a year, then it they're just, I have no clue what, where the building market is, and all that stuff that you know more than a year out. So at that point I. Yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:10:05
all right, so now see me looking.

Matthias Miller  1:10:19
There we go. I

Matthias Miller  1:10:26
something like that.

Matthias Miller  1:10:36
Yep, all right, all right, so I'm having a little trouble Ty tying this into the website. I don't know that we need to tie up time now. We should probably work on another really useful thing to have you here for. Would be drafting the about page.

Speaker 1  1:10:56
Is there any of the other copywriting stuff you'd like me to start working on? Matthias,

Matthias Miller  1:10:59
I think the big thing. Micah, how much do you care about the this one right here on the building types page. Do you do you care at all about these descriptions? I questions.

Speaker 2  1:11:27
I feel like, I think I talked to Audra about it yesterday. I feel like a lot of this stuff is just rewarding, the same thing with everything. And I don't like that. I would rather have it more specific somehow. I'm not sure how I want information there without a lot of excess. And I feel like right now it's very wordy without saying anything, and I hate that.

Matthias Miller  1:11:56
Let me try something.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
And maybe we don't need that, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:12:04
I think it's there for SEO, but I don't know if that's really Audrey. I

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
wonder if you could, I mean, some of this, I wonder if you could throw it to claw and have it basically be like, just tell it basically exactly what Micah said. Like, this seems really wordy and repetitive. Can you make this actually be useful for somebody who doesn't know anything? Just get a message asking if you have a website. Yeah, working on that,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:42
like Mayor,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:47
okay, let me take a look at that. I just realized I have a problem. Maybe

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
fix it. Let me go. I

Speaker 1  1:12:58
sent you a text. Micah, with different fonts.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
They all look the same to me.

Speaker 1  1:13:05
Something that looks Yeah, they're not radically different. Do you want something that looks what I want to say swirlier?

Speaker 2  1:13:16
Well, I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure, like everything is all tied together, like the logo is very blocky and everything. But do we want the letters to do that, or sometimes to do something different with letters? Helps it. It kind of needs to flow. I know that, right?

Speaker 1  1:13:32
So let me look at some rounded letters. And also

Speaker 2  1:13:36
wasn't sure, do we want all caps, or do we want that's

Speaker 1  1:13:40
entirely, I mean, yeah, that's entirely up to you, I think, and readability too, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:13:52
So let's try. There's something I did think about, because the building itself is very blocky. The mountains are a little less. So,

Speaker 1  1:14:01
yeah, so let me try some rounded letters. I like that suggestion,

Speaker 1  1:14:10
so I'll get you another set logo. Design always takes way more time than you think it's going to do.

Matthias Miller  1:14:47
Okay, what are some of the talking points that you want for the the about page. Micah, i.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
I don't know. I think it's, I

Matthias Miller  1:15:13
think locally owned and operated based in Penns, Colorado. Here it says backed by 20 years of expertise in construction. I Are there any warranties or guarantees or other types of talking points?

Speaker 2  1:15:35
So I mean, we do have warranties and guarantees for this company right now, but do we want it under the about structure? Because what if we would start working with a different company that has a little bit different or, you know, we start adding red iron, or we start adding something like that to where the warranties and stuff might be a little different. So I don't know if you want that in there. Sure,

Matthias Miller  1:15:59
there's not that much to say, really?

Speaker 2  1:16:01
No, there's not. I think the big thing is that we are here locally, the experience, and somehow I want to convey the message that they don't have to under like I'm here to help them and allow my experience to help them get their building. Basically, I've been recently, I've had a lot of people, oh, sorry, I'm such a pain and stuff like that. And they actually weren't. They're very nice people. They just feel like they don't know anything and but that's why I'm here, right? You know, if they didn't, if they knew what they were doing, or if they understood buildings, I wouldn't have a job

Matthias Miller  1:16:50
exactly like it. All right? Get a pretty strong draft here. I'm going to applause.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:23
Where's Blake? Where's Blake?

Speaker 1  1:17:35
I just sent you enchanting Matthias, something that looks blank, but it's a white, transparent PNG for the website, if it works for you, then good. If not, let me know.

Matthias Miller  1:17:44
Gotta love those. Okay, let me grab this about page out.

Matthias Miller  1:18:00
I'll be right back.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16
What happened out here?

Speaker 2  1:18:22
I I need to get through please, okay.

Speaker 2  1:18:58
Could I step away for a Few minutes? Matthias, yeah, yep, no problem.

Speaker 1  1:19:41
All right, I'm back. Do I need to log in to something to grab that text, or I haven't started so

Matthias Miller  1:19:50
we can get you the URL. Okay, perfect. This right here. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:20:03
How are we doing on time to to work? Do you think?

Matthias Miller  1:20:06
Yeah, like, I don't know. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:20:16
we're getting i

Matthias Miller  1:20:41
This is insane. It's getting a really good

Matthias Miller  1:20:50
there's some really good talking points in here. And I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
what are you working on?

Matthias Miller  1:20:58
Throwing together the about page. Oh, great. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:21:02
let's see. I need to make a new chat and Claude. Let's see. All Right, I'm working on it.

Matthias Miller  1:22:00
All right, let me know what you think of this about rock mountain. I don't know this is a little I don't know that it's nestled at the face of the Rockies. That just comes off a little bit weird. Let me, let me. Let me see if I can just take this paragraph here and let's just move this guy down into here. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:23:02
all right, Colorado, tough buildings as Colorado locals who understand the specific demands of building in our state, meeting snow load requirements is any structures that can handle under those unexpected spring storms. Starting from scratch, no problem. Many of our best customers started with just a rough idea. I need something to store my equipment, or I want to workshop, but I'm not sure how big. That's all we need to get started. We'll walk you through every decision, explain your options in plain English, and help you figure out exactly what will work for your property and budget. You don't need to be an expert. That's our job, local service that stays with you when you call us. You talk to real people who live and work right here in Colorado. We're your neighbors, not some distant corporate office. We'll meet you on your property, understand your land and help design something that makes sense for your specific situation. Our commitment. We believe in building relationships as strong as our structures, that first conversation and final walk through, we're focused on creating something that you'll be proud

Speaker 2  1:23:52
of for decades to come. I like it. I think it's good, sweet. I found

Matthias Miller  1:23:58
it interesting. I love that line relationships as strong as our structures. It's not me, but I like it. I mean, I didn't come up with it, but all right, I

Speaker 1  1:24:39
all right, I think Claude did a better job rewriting the combo structures description. Do you want me to run that by you guys for some kind of approval? Or what are we doing on this?

Matthias Miller  1:24:55
Yeah, let me get this topic squared away. Okay, perfect. It share your screen, or ever you want to do it, just let me know. How about something like that? The logo

Speaker 2  1:25:12
on, obviously, it depends what I'm looking on, but right now it looks really small.

Matthias Miller  1:25:21
Yeah, so we can, we definitely got room to, I think we do.

Matthias Miller  1:25:40
Whoo. Oh, it did not I

Matthias Miller  1:26:07
there. It is,

Matthias Miller  1:26:16
just these, just a touch more space in there. I

Matthias Miller  1:26:29
something like

Speaker 2  1:26:36
that. Should we have that banner bigger or not? I I don't know, go to the home page. Can you go to the home page? Let's see what that looks like. It kind of, instead of the logo being there, that this is who we are, it's kind of hidden away, kind of, I don't know, from for me, obviously, the quality build is kind of dominating that page right now. And I don't know if we could just get rid of that.

Matthias Miller  1:27:14
Yeah, it really does not. I

Matthias Miller  1:27:23
does not help all that much.

Matthias Miller  1:27:39
Let's Oh, there we go, something like that.

Speaker 2  1:28:02
That logo up there. What would happen if we make it like 50% Bigger? Just curious, what it would look like. Sure, I

Matthias Miller  1:28:40
I'm not quite sure what this is going to mess up here, but oops. Now keep in mind your your screens, like, substantially bigger. Like most, most folks are probably going to be pulling it up on something that's more like this.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:15
Do we have a mobile preview?

Speaker 2  1:29:16
I like I like that a lot better.

Matthias Miller  1:29:21
So here's the mobile which we need to. Just need to adapt that a little bit.

Speaker 1  1:29:37
I just wouldn't want to get your your navigation lost in the middle of all that, which on the mobile you've got that drop down, but on the you

Matthias Miller  1:29:51
don't, but Right? That's where we're wondering if on the.

Matthias Miller  1:30:09
I can't size it down.

Speaker 1  1:30:16
Does that disappear after you scroll anyway, a little bit it looks like it does first. Should theoretically, yeah, okay, alright,

Matthias Miller  1:30:26
so that's what mobile looks like. The other thing we could do on desktop as well is put the logo, put this in the middle, and put the the main, the menu right underneath it. I think

Speaker 1  1:30:37
that would help you not lose the menu I was planning to

Speaker 2  1:30:43
replace that picture too. Okay. Could be the same. I like the same building, but, oh, let me See

Matthias Miller  1:30:56
here I lost my menu.

Matthias Miller  1:31:20
We're not. We don't need to add to the car here, anywhere.

Matthias Miller  1:31:33
Yeah, just so we could take something like, like here, let's just a little bit more white space underneath it. But I I

Matthias Miller  1:31:46
could do something like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:53
ham and cheese. I

Matthias Miller  1:32:02
go through that I

Matthias Miller  1:32:20
my breath so

Unknown Speaker  1:32:59
you know what The font is that you're using for the

Matthias Miller  1:33:02
Oh, I get it, yeah, it's a

Speaker 1  1:33:08
this guy, yeah, I should know it. It looks very familiar. But, or for the Rocky Mountain metal buildings, which I think is a different

Unknown Speaker  1:33:19
one, like, oh, man, I bet I could figure it out. Futura,

Speaker 1  1:33:26
okay, light, yeah, I don't know that's still pretty Angular, but it's a lot lighter of a font. I don't know

Matthias Miller  1:33:39
this one here is

Unknown Speaker  1:33:42
we're bringing Garamond. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:34:02
I Okay, all right, oh, and The about pages come back on

Matthias Miller  1:35:04
We should put, there's the one thing we should do. We should put the phone number on the request to quote page.

Matthias Miller  1:35:18
I i think i

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
Oh, all right. Here, Audrey, you can walk us through so the copy that you've got over there, and we can see what that looks like. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:47
okay, so the combo metal building, okay, so this is what it came up with, just to

Speaker 1  1:36:57
to replace it. I think that flows a lot better. And it showed you, show you the original if you want it, but you see that well enough to read it.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:08
Yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:18
Your thoughts.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:26
Yeah, I think it's good, okay?

Speaker 1  1:37:28
And I went ahead and did the rest of them in that same style, so they look pretty innocuous to me, but it's going to be that same style. It's not nearly as repetitive. Do you want to read through all of them?

Speaker 2  1:37:46
So we have a metal storage? Do we have a garage, detached garage? We've

Speaker 1  1:37:52
got the com metal, the combo metal, the metal storage, agricultural metal storage, the residential metal building and the commercial, industrial metal building. That's what was on the website. I believe

Speaker 2  1:38:09
I feel like the storage, I don't know. I mean, there is something I want to talk to Matthias about at some point, different type of thing is getting more into shed competition, but that's a discussion for a different day. That I think the shed, storage shed might be nice, but I feel like we should have something about detached garage or something like that, and that might be covered under residential, but if it's under residential, we shouldn't need the storage sheds like we shouldn't need two different things covering the same category. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:47
Um, yeah, where's the

Speaker 2  1:38:49
or maybe, maybe it's not. Maybe it isn't really. It's just, yeah. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:38:53
so this is what. These are the images, I guess. Let me go back to their website. So commercial, industrial, residential, looks like this that you put up with it, agricultural looks like that. Storage sheds just look like I was,

Speaker 2  1:39:06
I was going and I could do this later too. I was going to totally replace the picture that they put, that she put on that like I was not happy with a lot of that stuff, but I couldn't get it finished. So finally, I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:16
just took it over. Okay, fair enough.

Speaker 2  1:39:20
So I was going to replace a lot of the pictures to match different things and replace some of that as well. I almost feel like, I mean, the storage shed is going to come under the residential so either we replace one of them with detached garages, or we just do it one category.

Matthias Miller  1:39:42
Well, people don't think. People don't show up thinking residential. They think detached garage or barndo or something like that, right? And so I, I would, I would say detach, you know,

Speaker 2  1:39:55
I would replace the residential structures with detached garage or something. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I would be in favor of that

Unknown Speaker  1:40:01
change the name of it, basically,

Matthias Miller  1:40:05
yes, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:40:13
let's see. Just again, I'll be right back in front of my computer.

Speaker 1  1:40:21
Okay, wait now I didn't write that down residential. I'm changing to detached garage.

Matthias Miller  1:40:26
Yes, okay.

Speaker 1  1:40:33
Is the description basically going to be the same? Instead of residential, it'll be detached garages provide homeowners with flexible space solutions, etc.

Speaker 2  1:40:46
I mean, obviously it's something more for the store vehicles, or, you know, man cave, that kind of thing. I

Speaker 1  1:41:04
uh so right now it says functionally functioning equally well as spacious garages, dedicated workshops, climate controlled home offices or comfortable guest accommodation.

Speaker 2  1:41:15
Would that be the last part the client the the guest accommodations definitely needs to come off, because that can come across as we're doing a dwelling, and that's not something that we can do in most areas right now. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:37
climate controlled offices, or

Speaker 2  1:41:40
I think I would remove that more like the basic garages, dedicated workshops, climate

Unknown Speaker  1:41:46
controlled, offices,

Speaker 2  1:41:51
climate controlled, or just Something about man caves or something like that. Okay, okay.

Speaker 1  1:42:05
Okay, all right, so detached garage. Do I need to send these to you? Matthias, then? Or can I, can I update these? I guess you're you can

Matthias Miller  1:42:16
log in with the sales at okay, saying see if I can figure that out. Then, okay, trying to think what else is. Should do a quick walk through, maybe, and just see where we're at on our contact form. Okay, no. The next thing I really need to do is through a bunch of Request a Quote I'll talk about, you know, Mike, with all due respect, you kind of wonder how much this lady actually went through the website before she actually

Speaker 2  1:42:53
I was very frustrated, trust me, I was, Yeah, no, you i Yeah, just wasting our time to go through it, but I was very frustrated when I actually got looking at it, and it is what it is. I just I've had very bad experiences. I had troyers out of Holmes county do one, and he screwed me over pretty bad on stuff, and it just been one thing after another.

Matthias Miller  1:43:19
What happened with that?

Speaker 2  1:43:21
He promised me the world as far as the custom website through, like, during the beginning of COVID, and I wanted to get ahead of the game with nationwide, and I wanted to make some people who go on the website and pick, like, some of our base basic packages. And I gave him a whole list of stuff. And he said, Yes, we can do this and this and do everything and all that stuff. And then once he had my money, he turned it over to someone that apparently this was one of the first websites he's ever done. He used the colors I specifically said I didn't want. Did not use the color that I said I wanted. He had so many typos on the page, I had to go through and point them out to him. And it was just one thing, and I was getting and then got Jonas on it. He didn't want to take any responsibility. And finally I said, we just, we just parted ways. And, yeah, yeah, interesting. I think it was a lot just, you know, I think Jonas is a good guy, but I think he's, he sees the big picture, yeah, and he was very stressed at the time. You know, it could very possibly be that now, or even six months later, he would have handled things differently.

Matthias Miller  1:44:29
Well, it's, it's kind of the I would be stressed by somebody building websites with that level of attention to detail, yeah, I mean, but

Speaker 2  1:44:38
it would have been one thing if he would have told me that I found that out through someone else that had worked with him, got it, and then I also found out that he largely uses just basic templates and does at that point anyhow, and he did a lot of like dog pages and stuff like that, where all they did is use a different template and put in the different context. Info and different minor details, and that's what they specialize in, right? And that they don't do as well with full custom. What I was looking for,

Matthias Miller  1:45:10
yeah, that makes sense. And that's, that's a lot of what I would have.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:13
I just wish I would have known that ahead of time, you know,

Matthias Miller  1:45:15
right? Yeah, for sure. For sure.

Speaker 1  1:45:22
Oh, okay, just FYI. I'm in here editing now,

Matthias Miller  1:45:27
yeah, and I accidentally hit your page. I'm trying to get back out. Okay, I apologize.

Speaker 1  1:45:31
I wasn't sure what I was going to be doing. So good. So okay,

Matthias Miller  1:45:36
I'll find my way back in.

Speaker 2  1:45:39
Okay, so I would like to make so for right now, at least makes a choice building USA. Also go to this and add the Choice Building GSA website, like the right side of the banner or something. Is that something we can do

Matthias Miller  1:45:53
to make it? Do you have a choice buildings website at all at this point,

Speaker 2  1:45:59
I own choice building usa.com. Okay, but after troyers, I I let it expire one time, and lost the website. And so I own that I would have to see what, where it's under. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:46:17
let me check something here. Square Space.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:25
It's not under Squarespace, I don't think so. WordPress, flu host.

Matthias Miller  1:46:38
So basically, what you need to do is you need to add that domain to Wix. I think the easiest way add that domain to Wix, make sure rocky metal, Mount metal.com is your primary but then you go through the Wix connect domain process with Bluehost to get them connected. That makes any sense. I

Matthias Miller  1:47:12
page,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:18
Rocky Mountain metal.com is not connected.

Matthias Miller  1:47:24
Say it's not it is now, or it is now. Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome. Yep, there we go. Sweet. I

Matthias Miller  1:47:45
have a here we Go. What We Need. I

Speaker 1  1:49:20
i Tell me changes were made. Another browser. I need to refresh page. So, oh, not to, I know. I try not to do anything. Are you saved with whatever you're doing?

Matthias Miller  1:49:30
I'm on a different page, so I think I should be fine. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:49:34
double check it. Well, it hit me back to the home page, and it wants me to refresh that, but I'm not going

Matthias Miller  1:49:41
to. That's terrible. Maybe we should be at the same time. Maybe,

Speaker 1  1:49:46
well, I'm not going to hit any more buttons until you're done doing and you save. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:49:55
here, let me it's really quick. Blank on here, and then page

Matthias Miller  1:50:09
all right, I'm out. I could get out of editing. So the main thing I'm seeing on my end is there's a bunch of miscellaneous contact weird contact forms are scattered throughout. I want to add some request to quote buttons and clean that up, but I

Speaker 1  1:50:43
Okay, nothing I did saved. So sorry. Oh, that's okay. Did you get your stuff saved?

Matthias Miller  1:50:49
I mean, my one little button, which is much less working your stuff, so it was

Speaker 1  1:50:54
just copy and paste. So I'm gonna wait until you're done. Maybe wait until after this call.

Matthias Miller  1:50:59
Okay, well, let me then, let me then do a quick rip through the website, clean up just a handful of these things, and I think, I think then we can do a little walk through and, okay, see what it looks like.

Speaker 1  1:51:13
Did you like any more of those more rounded spots? I know they still look pretty similar. I'm not going in crazy. Mike, I like number six. It was more rounded. Which one is number six? I sent you a text. There's a there are red numbers in the

Speaker 2  1:51:31
I know, but you cut off some numbers. Oh, okay.

Speaker 1  1:51:36
Oh, if you open it up, you can't see the red numbers in the corner. No. Oh, that's weird. Oh, yes, if I zoom in, I can, okay, no, I'm sure it's very small. Yeah, I can try to find a better way to do this. I could send you an email with bigger versions, if you'd like.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:59
I do think the rounded lettering looks better.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:06
What if trying to think I

Speaker 1  1:52:42
I don't know, actually, like four or two that might the most readable. One might be the number four.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:50
I think number four is better.

Speaker 1  1:52:52
Yeah, actually, also it

Speaker 2  1:52:55
looked, I was trying to figure out, Is it because of the size to the font on on six seems smaller. The

Speaker 1  1:53:02
size of the font is the same across all of them. It's just,

Speaker 2  1:53:05
I know, but different fonts sometimes they don't translate the same. Well,

Speaker 1  1:53:09
yeah, different fonts have different sizes. I mean, so that that font is smaller, but the size is technically what

Speaker 2  1:53:17
about, what about the font that Matthias used on the banner there? You know, what that is, is that one of these?

Speaker 1  1:53:23
Uh, it's not one of those. We did look it up. I don't have access to that one for one, but it's more of a straight one, again, just kind of a thin which I could look at. I think I prefer these. I prefer the four. You know, I do too. Actually, you want a big version of that so you can get a good look at it.

Speaker 2  1:53:49
Should we make the writing more prominent? Sure? Right now, the logo kind of dominates everything, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's almost I'm trying to think I No,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:03
I can do that.

Speaker 2  1:54:08
I also like, I'm not sure. I don't know if I can. We can incorporate it to this is I like when the first letter can be dominant of each word, but here we have 2m so I don't know that I want to do rm and then B, right?

Speaker 1  1:54:35
Well, and I mean, we're limited a little bit by vertical space, because I can only make the letter so large without their long, making it smaller. Yeah, so Rocky Mountain, metal buildings to get that on two lines, we can only make it so big,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:50
yeah.

Speaker 1  1:54:56
I could maybe see about okay, let me. See, okay, kind of like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:18
That one see if I can do

Speaker 2  1:55:24
I like the Rocky Mountain metal.com domain, but when I look at this and I think about Rocky Mountain structures, it feels like that would fit the logo and stuff. Feel like I'm just complicating things here. I don't know what

Speaker 1  1:55:49
do you mean, like, branding wise, you like? So when I look

Speaker 2  1:55:52
at that, when I look at that logo, and if you replace metal building with structures, I feel like it would fit perfectly.

Speaker 1  1:56:02
Oh. Rocky Mountain structures instead of Yeah, is that going to confuse your branding? I guess was my question. Is that a branding problem? Or is it not because I don't know what you're going for right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:17
Matthias, you're the expert on that. What do you think

Matthias Miller  1:56:19
I would keep trying to keep the name somewhere similar, Rocky Mountain.

Speaker 1  1:56:27
No, I would too, generally speaking, from a branding perspective, you don't want people to get confused.

Matthias Miller  1:56:31
I mean, you could also call it Rocky Mountain metal structures. But then I mean that makes it at least conversationally, makes it a little more, a little easier to say, recommends.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:46
That doesn't help our logo issue.

Matthias Miller  1:56:48
You guys are trying to get the logo, the the words balance of the logo,

Speaker 2  1:56:52
yeah, yeah. I it's just it's too texty or something. I don't know what, how to explain it. Yeah, this is, that's, that's better. I like, I like that better

Speaker 1  1:57:04
this, but okay, this was, yeah, because there's about a as big as I can make the words,

Matthias Miller  1:57:09
have you tried doing anything where the metal structures, like they're the metal structures is bigger, so that the words come out to the same width?

Speaker 1  1:57:16
What do you mean? Just like, make like. So the

Matthias Miller  1:57:21
M is is aligned with the Yeah, or is that too? What do you think

Matthias Miller  1:57:37
the caps too is almost

Speaker 1  1:57:40
Yeah? Yeah, they don't have to be caps. I don't know the alignment

Unknown Speaker  1:57:45
looks without caps. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:52
let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:58:01
that. Okay.

Speaker 2  1:58:09
I prefer that for sure, without the caps, yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:19
we can make it bigger that way,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:27
if you were to want,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:33
I don't know, I almost feel like there's a proportion problem, but I'm not sure what

Matthias Miller  1:58:39
it is, proportional You should be, logically, should be bigger than

Speaker 2  1:58:43
your buildings. Yeah, bring here, but bring but bring the can you bring the mountain down to where they kind of look like they go behind the building instead of sitting on top.

Speaker 2  1:59:01
Yeah? That's too much, though, because in the same color of the building, that's, I don't know if that's gonna work. It

Speaker 1  1:59:06
doesn't. It won't provide any Yeah, yeah. I mean,

Speaker 2  1:59:10
what if you take the mountains? What if you make the mountains quite a bit bigger?

Unknown Speaker  1:59:15
Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:59:19
your building gets lost when I do that, I feel

Speaker 2  1:59:24
it's because there's three tiers, and you're centering the peak like you're you have too much in the center, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:59:33
see if, if you killed the mountains straight up, just killed it, and you just made the Building be big enough to, like, make it the same width as everything else. And now, if you look at this, and then you think about, well, what kind of subtle Rocky Mountain background could you put on there?

Speaker 1  1:59:57
Well, it's not me. Well, I mean, we can. I redesign it if you want, but then I'll give you a new logo for the website if we do a total redesign here,

Matthias Miller  2:00:04
right? So, I mean, does, but, but this, that's this actually has some coherence to it, like there's a box down at the bottom. It unifies it all together. The problem with the the balance that we had been using is it like it, it's like it breaks it up, like it keeps creates a whole other section.

Speaker 1  2:00:27
It does, I don't know, I kind of, I feel like the mountains are too big

Unknown Speaker  2:00:31
or too

Speaker 1  2:00:36
well, so everything is too centered, from a design element,

Speaker 2  2:00:40
top left, no, no. On the left side, on the mountain, top left, yes,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:51
oops. Did it? Throw it in there and throw it

Matthias Miller  2:00:53
up there. It's black.

Speaker 1  2:00:56
It is okay. That's going to be really hard for a logo. It's got way too much fine detail. Okay,

Speaker 2  2:01:04
yeah, sure. I was just thinking it's busier, but it's more subtle,

Speaker 1  2:01:08
yeah, so okay, if we look at it from just design perspective, like, how important is the structure versus how important is the Rocky Mountain portion? And I think up until now, I've been trying to keep that relatively the similar, which is kind of why it's wound up looking like this rocky mountain metal buildings like it really kind of from a right. I mean, it's the same size, it's the same basic structure. It kind of has a cohesive Rocky Mountain metal buildings structure to it. So if you want to change that up a little bit, we definitely can. But I'm wondering, yeah, like, you're right. Like, what would be subtle? There's a nice when

Speaker 2  2:01:52
you look at that, yes, what? When you look at that up there, it doesn't tie together. It's like the building and the mountains look like two different things, like it's not tied together

Speaker 1  2:02:08
that, yeah, that's fair. But what do you want in a logo line drawing? Because it also has to be, well, from my side of the air to the eye,

Speaker 2  2:02:18
I would want something that it looks like the mountains go behind the building, or it's kind of hard to do it in this situation, but a different color or something that sets it apart and doesn't look like two pictures stacked on top of each other,

Matthias Miller  2:02:38
and thinner lines could be, would definitely be one way to do it.

Speaker 1  2:02:46
That's true. I logo design is difficult, because I agree with you that would be, it would be esthetically more pleasing, but it's actually more difficult for the eye to read on business cards and on websites, which is what the logo is about. So

Matthias Miller  2:02:59
okay, here's a wild idea. Let's see if I can,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:08
and you replace the roof with that.

Speaker 1  2:03:11
I know that's part of the problem is the roof design is mountainous, and so you can't really necessarily create enough. You'd almost want a dome structure to, you know, have the mountains behind look different. That's part of the design problem we're having here, too, I think, because it's just going to sort of blend into the fact of the roof is peaked.

Matthias Miller  2:03:32
Do you can you see this thing here? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:40
What do you think? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:03:42
where'd you get that chat? GBT, can you add some subtle mountains to the back? Subtle

Speaker 1  2:03:47
mountains to the back? Yeah. I mean, so it's basically that only slightly different snow caps. I like it.

Speaker 2  2:03:58
I mean, I think what gets me. I think what gets me is the mountains are the same color and approximately the same thickness as the Alpine.

Matthias Miller  2:04:11
Okay, let me see, see about this. Um, okay, can you adjust the mountains to use a lighter thickness? Okay, now let's see if it can come up with something here. Let me just share this. Wow, you can watch the whole thing tirelessly. Labor.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:33
Come to here without changing. Stop

Unknown Speaker  2:04:35
Sharing mine.

Matthias Miller  2:04:39
Audra, do you remember where we didn't we have a template for privacy policy somewhere that we sent

Unknown Speaker  2:04:47
to Jason, maybe, let me see if it comes

Unknown Speaker  2:04:49
to like right here.

Speaker 2  2:04:59
Yeah. We've been trying a lot of stuff that we keep coming back to,

Matthias Miller  2:05:13
oops, that's not right here. I'm going

Speaker 2  2:05:19
to try this. So if you would change the mountain colors to like a gray, right? How would that work? Like, to where it's there, but it's more subtle. Let's try this.

Matthias Miller  2:05:36
I know this is not the most sophisticated color tool, but boy, is it familiar?

Speaker 2  2:05:41
Hey, this is, yeah, this is what I used to do. I don't

Matthias Miller  2:05:45
even know, oh, it's not gonna Oh, man,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:49
with redesign, actually,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:51
though,

Matthias Miller  2:05:53
little texture. I

Unknown Speaker  2:05:55
don't know how good it is for a logo, but I like that.

Speaker 1  2:05:59
Yeah, it could cause some logo problems, I think, for graphics, like printing, but

Matthias Miller  2:06:08
no, be aggressive and make it be 20 to five to 50% is it's and then let's also try this here.

Speaker 2  2:06:29
So I think one thing that's messing with me. So have you ever heard the in photography, there is a thirds. I forget exactly what they call it, but it's about the thirds right now we have, there is, we have the peak of the mountains and the peak of the building. They are both in the center, which is something you don't do, right in photography, you want to do thirds. So like, obviously the building kind of needs to be in the center. We wouldn't have to, but we'd have to do something different. But the mountains, if the mountains wouldn't peak in the center, that's what I keep coming back to. Is too much the same, same angles, everything

Speaker 1  2:07:19
I did experiment with that off center a little bit in Canva. I don't know if I showed you any of them, or if I kept them it, it, it doesn't work very well for a logo, because there's no sense of depth there, and so it just winds up looking wonky and off center to my eye at least, yeah, no matter what we do, it just looks like we didn't center it correctly. It looks like a mistake.

Matthias Miller  2:07:49
So this gives us this, this, we'd have to combine the two, but this would give us a,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:56
let me see

Matthias Miller  2:07:58
thicker versus thin. It just it thin down, everything It did, yeah, now you could potentially hear, we should. We could actually just try this, because this is worth trying as well. It would also be interesting. I'll get back to that rule of thirds, because I think that's interesting to pursue. Please make this be or Please reduce the thickness substantially,

Matthias Miller  2:08:39
and then I and that's a little that's the gray. It literally say gray and silver. Looks a little, little weird. We could also, then, let's try this. All right, where's my where's my original photo that I was using isn't

Matthias Miller  2:09:14
available on site. Well, thank you. Okay, let's just try copying I

Matthias Miller  2:10:08
Yeah, I mean, anyway, so just back doing everything so we could potentially combine those two if we wanted to, wanted to. This does spark some interesting things like this isn't right, but it seems possible that

Speaker 2  2:10:24
it's still, I think the angles are just gonna keep messing with me. Honestly, sure, yep, the center peak, the center peak with the roof line.

Matthias Miller  2:10:41
So if we had, what if we know you're you're not, you're not listening to me at all. Are you me? No, like all. Right here, let's try one of the things yet here,

Speaker 1  2:11:18
here, let's see. Can I bear again? Yes, about something like that, I just grabbed a template, and it's a little goofy, and I didn't redo the fonts, but you're looking at something that looks more professional. You want something that looks like that,

Matthias Miller  2:11:44
but Could you, could you move the building even further to the right?

Speaker 1  2:11:50
Yeah, but the further to the right we get it, the like here is about where I'd put it, or we want to center the building. Maybe, let's see, and just sort of UN center the which that doesn't look so bad to me, that looks like it could be an artistic choice, yeah. And if I mean, I can move this down even a little bit, and then kind of UN and I even kind of messed with maybe doubling that. I just need to take out that those and so it doesn't overlap the building.

Matthias Miller  2:12:29
But I was wondering, could you have it slightly offset to the right and just have a single peak off to the left in the background?

Unknown Speaker  2:12:34
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:12:37
as another option, like I

Unknown Speaker  2:12:45
let's see that's not a single peak, I guess. Don't like that one. Don't like that one mountain peak. I

Unknown Speaker  2:13:09
there's that I kind of like that That's simple. I

Unknown Speaker  2:14:19
Okay, how about either of these variations. You seeing that top, and then this one,

Speaker 2  2:14:34
I feel like the first one there. If someone doesn't really know what they're looking at, they don't really know what that they could not really know what that is, or it wouldn't really register, right? Let me look at that one a little more. I.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:01
Whoops, do you have one below that or not? No,

Speaker 1  2:15:03
just these two. I just kind of simplified them so. And I agree this one's very modern ish, and I kind of like it, but I agree people might not necessarily immediately make and I

Speaker 2  2:15:14
kind of like the font like, I kind of like the two different fonts aside and stuff like that. I like that a lot, right?

Speaker 1  2:15:23
This one, I like this one. It just changes the proportion a lot. It changes the composition a lot. And I like it.

Speaker 1  2:15:42
I and these are basically the fonts on your website. Okay, looking at them, so that works.

Matthias Miller  2:15:58
What are your thoughts? Micah,

Speaker 2  2:16:00
we make my wife is looking at it. What if, like, I like the mountains, for obvious reasons, but what about like? Would like evergreens, pine trees, that kind of thing, kind of give do the same thing, but give us more flexibility.

Matthias Miller  2:16:27
That's a great idea. I like that.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:31
Are you working on the GPT version of that? No, I

Matthias Miller  2:16:34
was just wondering if there are other

Speaker 1  2:16:39
I mean, I would we look at foreground, then to the building? Maybe, let's see again. Okay, so we're not going to print this on business cards or anything, or are we? I

Unknown Speaker  2:16:55
don't know, okay,

Speaker 1  2:16:56
because anything like this would be horrible to use if we're putting it on a business card. And I'm not sure that I would even do that on the website exactly, because it's you want to mostly stick with line structures for these types of things. However, just to

Speaker 2  2:17:10
the left of where you're at, go down, down there, here, oh, okay, a bunch of trees right above that. Okay, this one, yeah, what happens if you put that? But then,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:33
let's see. Okay, where did we put it? Like up there with instead of the

Speaker 2  2:17:41
mountain, maybe down a little bit, but, yeah, instead of the mountains, I don't know, it would kind of have to be, it has a straight line on the left, so it kind of has to be to the edge of the

Speaker 1  2:17:53
logo. Yeah, that wouldn't be a but maybe I could find something similar to that

Speaker 2  2:17:59
also, or maybe mountains, like where your mouse is on there, or it's just something I don't know. It's kind of a

Speaker 1  2:18:07
well, we could literally spend days on logo design, and I've done it with people before, too, where it just never feels quite right. So I get that,

Speaker 2  2:18:19
and I have already spent a lot of time on it before and right.

Matthias Miller  2:18:25
So here's one other kind of wild topic. Micah, you, you, I think you enjoy hunting as well. Is there a I mean, you could also consider some form of wildlife on it as well that native to the Rockies, that

Unknown Speaker  2:18:43
would be the obvious choice.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:51
But

Speaker 1  2:19:02
not quite. Sure where to put that or what to do with it, but I kind of like it.

Matthias Miller  2:19:09
I like the subtlety of it, like it's, it's, it's not as, I don't know. It's not as over the top. Oh, hey, we're Rockies like everybody else is.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:19
Yeah, I don't know. I kind of like it right there, for some reason. But what do you think? Well, what is necessary for this project? Maybe we should narrow it down. Have we got what we need for the website right now? Or do we need to change the website or the logo that's on the website?

Unknown Speaker  2:19:46
Are you talking to me, or Matthias? Um,

Speaker 1  2:19:47
both of you, I suppose. Are you happy with what are Micah, are you happy with what's on the website right now? Because this technically is on the website,

Speaker 2  2:19:56
okay? And the thing is, we can also change that logo a little bit. Yeah, yeah, I can play with it. Yeah, do some stuff if there's a way for you to share that with me,

Speaker 1  2:20:06
yeah, yeah. No, I could share this with you. Play with

Speaker 2  2:20:11
it a little bit. But yeah, as far as the website part of it, the logo that Matthias had shown was good. Was good. Okay, I would like to do is, I would like to put Choice Building USA at the top, like either beside that logo, or all the way on the right, so that people asking for my website, I can send them to that and not a lot of confusion on

Speaker 1  2:20:32
the website itself. On the website itself. Okay, so why don't we stop with the logo for now, we can come back. We can come back to the logo. Does that sound okay? Offline at some other point, and let's just finish up the website stuff. Yep, I agree. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:20:48
All right, so if we're Oops, there's the wrong page. All right, so let's do a little walk through of the

Matthias Miller  2:21:01
All right. So not you, but you are as far as the, as far as the as far as the choice buildings. You say, do you just want that as a

Speaker 2  2:21:18
so on my you go to facebook.com/choice, buildings, USA, my profile picture has been my logo, and if we Could just somehow put that on the top right, or,

Matthias Miller  2:21:44
as I said,

Speaker 2  2:21:45
somehow incorporated so that, yeah, I

Matthias Miller  2:21:54
don't know If I need credit for This or not, but I

Matthias Miller  2:22:20
I don't know where it went. There it is. You're

Matthias Miller  2:22:39
thinking something like that.

Speaker 2  2:22:46
Yeah, maybe make that choice building USA just a little bit bigger.

Matthias Miller  2:22:57
I need a way to crop this guy sure do that. No, I don't want to do that. Profit extent. I

Matthias Miller  2:23:20
So, all right, you

Matthias Miller  2:23:40
or something like that.

Speaker 2  2:23:48
Yeah, I think that's good. One thing I thought about like we were talking about doing Rocky Mountain metals, like, I forget what the term is, but under Choice Building, GSA or whatever trade name, yeah. But one thing I thought about too is we could do like on the Facebook page or whatever, you know, Rocky Mountain, metal buildings, a choice building, USA company, or something like that. I feel like I don't need to cover today.

Matthias Miller  2:24:22
That's, I mean, I think it's fine. I think it's a little bit beyond the scope of I think the goal for today is just getting the website knocked out. So basically, we've got, most of this is the same. There's requested quote page throughout. We got building types. Audit is going to finish updating the descriptions on these. There's quote buttons throughout here. There's the about page that you put in with some of those talking points request the quote button there portfolio, I think there might have been. There's an issue on the portfolio that I'm not sure exactly. What is portfolio. These are a picture of all your like your photo.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:59
Gallery? Yes, we

Matthias Miller  2:25:02
should just rename that to photos that would make more sense to people. And I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  2:25:16
we're just doing a website to use people up here.

Matthias Miller  2:25:22
Kind of cover. Let's do the cover as

Speaker 1  2:25:28
Do you guys need me anymore for this meeting? I don't think so. I think we're good. When you're done updating at some point this afternoon, I'll update the descriptions on that website. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Sounds good. All right, I'm gonna leave, thanks guys. All right, bye.

Matthias Miller  2:25:46
We're gonna make this guy the cover here.

Matthias Miller  2:25:56
That guy becomes a cover. Now, There we go. So

Matthias Miller  2:26:11
here I'm

Matthias Miller  2:26:33
all right, so then we Got, come on. I

Matthias Miller  2:26:47
That's the wrong one.

Matthias Miller  2:27:02
I right, so then we got photos, which is just all this stuff, and then the request to quote form, which is just the form, like we talked about. We'll be putting a privacy policy link at the bottom of the page using kind of a stock privacy policy that we use for compliance with advertising and texting. But

Speaker 2  2:27:31
as far as doing the choice buildings USA to go to this page, is that fairly straightforward?

Matthias Miller  2:27:38
Yeah, basically what you need to do here,

Matthias Miller  2:27:53
basically you go into, actually, what I don't have permission to do it, but you add, you connect, you, you in Wix, you connect your domain, your secondary domain, and then once it's connected, you can or as part of the connection process, you can tell it to redirect to the main site.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:22
Hey, That

Matthias Miller  2:28:24
makes sense. I

Matthias Miller  2:30:48
Is it? Are you waiting on me again? Me for anything?

Unknown Speaker  2:30:52
I'm just, do you need anything from me? Or, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:30:54
no, I don't think so. I mean, I think Yeah. I think I think, like I said, I think it should be pretty straightforward. I think is it? Yeah? Let me

Matthias Miller  2:31:13
see, yeah. The latest changes are all up. There's a few. So Audra is going to, going to correct the wording on the building types,

Matthias Miller  2:31:36
and I'm adding the privacy policy. I think that's that's basically What we've got left I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:32:16
or Double A, it looks like double A.

Matthias Miller  2:32:32
I mean, if there's, yeah, I guess, where do you want to go from here? I think I've got what I need if you're happy with with it, or if you want to take another look at it before we drop. I guess. Let me know what you've what you need.

Speaker 2  2:32:46
I can't do much because you're logged in. Oh, okay, here I'm not but what I can do, I mean, from everything you show me, I think I'm good with it. It's one of those things that, like the pictures, or some things that I may go in and kind of do myself. But, you know, I think from my, from what I can tell, it's ready to be published, and then I feel like a website is never

Matthias Miller  2:33:12
100% complete. It never is. It's It's so done, but not complete, yep, right,

Unknown Speaker  2:33:19
so I think I'm good with everything.

Matthias Miller  2:33:22
Okay, sounds good. Well, Audra will have Audra put in the rest of the stuff, and

Speaker 2  2:33:29
cool. Sounds good. And I am about to send over your question for the Bill Wood sweet, just cleared this morning.

Speaker 2  2:33:52
I'm not sure I need to look up the exact number it's going to be in that $2,500 range. Do Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:34:18
Sounds good. Yeah, I'm still here. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  2:34:22
let's go and everything checked out. So there we go.

Matthias Miller  2:34:26
All right, well, I will keep my open for that. Appreciate it. And I think this opens the door then for for Google ads, right?

Speaker 2  2:34:38
And I'm going to trying to think how I need to do, I guess under choice buildings, GSA, you guys can access that. But I could also act, I could, and would actually prefer to add your personal pages as admins to my business. Page for one thing. Every time someone comments, we can tell who did and so we can tell who to contact and what's going on. So I'm gonna try to do that stuff today. I I don't know I was planning to go to Pueblo building apartment this afternoon, but I may make some calls and try to put that off until the that off till tomorrow morning. It's just a great day to stay inside by the fire.

Matthias Miller  2:35:25
Yeah, I'm gonna head out and find a little coffee shop where I can watch the rain from I don't have a window in here, so, yeah, I'm with you.

Speaker 2  2:35:34
Yeah, yeah, we have a pellet stone here, so like on the other side of the computer here, there's the living room, yeah, and there's a picture window going out like we can on a clear day, you can see the wet mountains and stuff, but, and then we also have a telescope at the corner here, and it just kind of a nice day to stay inside, right? Yeah, I like it. Okay. Thanks so much. Matthias, I appreciate you. Thanks for everything you've done for me here. So yeah, you're welcome. Go to let's make it work. Get some stuff done.

Matthias Miller  2:36:09
Thanks, Michael, thank

Unknown Speaker  2:36:10
you. Bye.
