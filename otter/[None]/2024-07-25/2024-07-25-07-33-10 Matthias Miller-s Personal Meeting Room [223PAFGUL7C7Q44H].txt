Matthias Miller  00:15
Good morning. Hey, good morning. Sorry, I got I got stuck in a, not a hallway conversation when it's along Main Street. But I'm running a few minutes late, so I'm on my phone right now. I'll be in my office in a minute or two.

Speaker 1  00:34
Okay, what did you say? You said it's not a holy conversation if it's a long Main Street or what kind of conversation?

Matthias Miller  00:41
Sorry, I said hallway for water cooler.

Matthias Miller  00:53
No, I think you can have holy conversations.

Speaker 1  00:59
I was talking about it makes you think of the other day the the term sacred cows, like everyone has a sacred cow. I think that's what you call it, like a pet project or something where you just kind of yours and you don't and I was talking to talking to Jane Robert about that, and I couldn't think of of the term, and I said, like, what do you call it? A holy holy cow? And laugh and laugh like, no, it's a sacred cow.

Matthias Miller  01:37
That's funny. Yes,

Matthias Miller  01:52
is drew in the office this morning.

Unknown Speaker  01:59
I thought he's on.

Unknown Speaker  02:00
Drew, are you on?

Unknown Speaker  02:00
I thought I heard him.

Matthias Miller  02:08
Okay, sounds good. So if it wasn't sure,

Unknown Speaker  02:13
or were you asking if he's in the inside Office?

Matthias Miller  02:18
Well, I was mostly wondering, yeah, wondering if he's on the call. So yes, oh, sure, that's all I really

Speaker 1  02:24
he's about halfway exactly between me and you Missouri. So

Matthias Miller  02:33
that's right, I forgot about that. Yes, yes, yes.

Unknown Speaker  02:39
Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  02:48
Sir, all right, well, I'm not sure, Mark, could you send over an agenda for what you I picked a little bit earlier, but

Speaker 1  03:00
no not, I had not sent an agenda. There's two things that I sure that I have actually three, but my suggestion would be, I guess I could put that together. I think drew you have more things to cover with Matthias on some of the what was it? Sales tax and write outs, possibly there might have been other things. I would suggest that drew you cover what you have first and then you mind after that? Is that good with you?

Unknown Speaker  03:50
That's fine, yeah.

Speaker 2  03:55
Matthias, did you get you got the email just yesterday? I with that recording difference on AR on an invoice,

Matthias Miller  04:13
I saw the email this morning, out all day yesterday, I get

Unknown Speaker  04:29
yesterday, 1130 spell, accounts receivable, minor issue.

Unknown Speaker  04:38
All right, let me uh

Matthias Miller  04:47
I go take a look.

Matthias Miller  04:55
So we know payment date is in AR even the payment has not been received. Received. So basically,

Matthias Miller  05:12
this is the accounts receivable report should be including

Speaker 2  05:21
so in my email, there's the darker line with the 22 209,

Speaker 2  05:33
so it's on the AR report, but if you open up that Sales Order, it shows zero there.

Matthias Miller  05:49
The balance,

Matthias Miller  05:56
right?

Matthias Miller  06:02
So? When we calculate the balance, we should always be including a balance that has a blank payment date. It would be applied in Infinity past. It would be applied as of the invoicing date. It would never be applied. Well, how do we want to handle it?

Speaker 2  06:26
My, my, like, how can they put it? How can they put a payment amount in without a payment date? Because, like, that doesn't exist. That's

Matthias Miller  06:40
fair. Let's go take a look and see how many sales orders we have with orders we have with a blank payment date

Speaker 1  06:47
Drew. Are you talking about that? $22,000 one we looked at the other day.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  06:53
Well, while we're another

Speaker 1  06:55
thing we want to do on that then is I talked I was working with Leanne this morning on cleaning up AR, and she said they are unable to edit that payment RG and add a payment date to it, to it. So I said, Well, we'll take care of it on the call today with Matthias then. So

Matthias Miller  07:18
let's try this. I We were

Speaker 1  07:23
planning to just enter a payment date of, think it modification history showed that information being entered 1130, 23 and just entered as of then. And then you would have to do journal entries to resolve that, unless you tell me differently. Drew that, that we should use another date. But the bottom line was, Leanne,

Matthias Miller  07:55
is there any reason we allow payments with blank

Unknown Speaker  08:02
i Wait a minute,

Matthias Miller  08:05
somebody did something to it. No, they didn't. Why is this one? Not because it's a so was this payment received? When was this payment received?

Speaker 1  08:17
Well, we're saying November 30 of last year based on when it that's when modification history shows the payment being recorded, right? So we were just going to

Matthias Miller  08:30
use something here, random ID. Let's see if we could.

Speaker 3  08:41
Um, how would we do this? We've got

Matthias Miller  08:50
so, let's do so creation date.

Matthias Miller  08:58
We, I mean, we've got a we, only care about ones that have a date and an amount, not is NA so payment, I'm just trying to figure out how many more of these you've got lurking in the system somewhere that,

Speaker 2  09:17
well, we had a whole bunch that did not have a payment method, and those those affected accounting, but they did not affect the AR report. So we went through and put in a or a we had AP put in payment methods, in a whole bunch that right, or is that backwards? Mark,

Matthias Miller  09:43
all right, let me when we share this with you. The

Unknown Speaker  09:49
payment method.

Unknown Speaker  09:54
Are you asking if what? What are you asking about? That

Speaker 2  09:56
was it? Did it show up on. The AR report, but not in accounting, or was it the other way around? If it was missing,

Speaker 1  10:06
I know. I think it was showing up on the AI report, but not in not in accounting. I think the bottom line is okay. The most important thing is that the exact same criteria used on the accounts receivable report as we're using an accounting because we're like, up until now, we haven't but, but we have, like, banks wanting that. We have banks wanting a balance sheet and an accounts receivable report, because they look at accounts receivable at sometimes as collateral. So if the balance sheet says 400,000 then or in AR, then the accounts receivable report also needs to show 400,000 so we've been doing a bunch of cleanup to get those two to sync. But like the payment method was that that was one instance where, yeah, I think you're correct to it. It still showed on the accounts receivable report, but did not show an accounting,

Matthias Miller  11:21
yeah, so I guess what I'm after, though it's what's the correct what's the correct approach? It seems, if you have an amount, then you should also be required to specify a date and a payment method.

Unknown Speaker  11:33
That's what I would say. Yeah.

Speaker 1  11:38
So can you how far back you want to I would, I mean, because we're doing cleanup anyway, and that will take care of itself, I would propose we just do from this day forward, or from whenever you set it up, moving forward, unless there's a reason to go back in history to do that.

Matthias Miller  12:03
Well, I mean, it will get old stuff like this is, this is a 2023 here would be a simple way to do it. This is a 2023 invoice that's still showing up on there because, for whatever reason. And I think if we would, and if we would specify the date it would all be taken care of. So my proposal is, I've got about 43 different sales orders that have this issue. My proposal would be, we set the payment date to the invoice date and and if the method is blank, just set it to other and these will all go away. So

Speaker 1  12:43
Oh, you're saying almost 43 they already have a payment, like, if you were to look at the sales or they have a payment, but they're missing either the payment date or the payment method, or maybe both. But by by adding those default like payment to other or the payment date, you're just matching the invoice date, that would clean those up, right? The only thing I would okay and the other option is to go in and do it manually on those 43

Matthias Miller  13:28
correct that would be the other option I

Speaker 1  13:30
would I would almost rather just you create that list and send it to me, and then I'll just work with with Leanne to have that entered manually, just that way were we have the correct payment method entered then, and we don't just have a generic other and they can do a little bit of digging and say, See approximately when this was, I mean, probably the day they recorded the payment is what We use for the payment date. But since they're not more than that, that would be, I think that would be the cleanest way to do it, but

Unknown Speaker  14:14
also help them

Speaker 2  14:16
get the idea that they need to have all these in there, rather than just suddenly they're being, being a block that keeps them from doing something they used to always do.

Speaker 1  14:28
Yeah, that and then, but, but then, moving forward, it would be a requisite that, I mean, you can't, you can't record a payment unless you have their those details entered. Sure. Or is there a reason those required fields? Well, no, that the date must. I mean, we don't want counting unless you do. True the date and the payment method you have to have that to do. Well, yeah, I like Dwayne. Dwayne works. Oh, he says accounting makes everyone behave, and I agree with him more and more.

Matthias Miller  15:25
That's funny. He's asking some time if that's why he doesn't want to get get involved in accounting.

Speaker 1  15:32
Well, he he actually has gotten involved quite a bit in the last few days. He was busy, busily fixing what he calls unmarried purchase orders, which are basically purchase orders that are hanging out that have no or most of them were purchase orders. And we had, we were not able to link vendor invoices. We couldn't find matching vendor invoices, so some of them got entered double anyway, that's a whole other story. But he so he was, was getting involved, quite a bit

Matthias Miller  16:14
interesting. So the the only caveat to this is that

Unknown Speaker  16:21
you will

Matthias Miller  16:24
probably the easiest way to put this information back in is if I send you an Excel spreadsheet and they fill it out with here, let's do well. They could actually do this. They just fill in the payment method and payment date columns on that spreadsheet, and then we'll have to just run a one off import to get it stomped in, because I don't think we can. I mean, yeah, most of these are locked down. I believe you're probably going to have to mark it not complete and go make change and market complete, unless it's something that you want them to do.

Speaker 1  17:10
I mean, this is, sounds like what you're doing. The import is, is 30 minutes of work or whatever on your site, once they filled that information in? Is that correct? Like, it's pretty straightforward.

Matthias Miller  17:26
Yeah, potentially, but I guess is there anything that keeps me from marking this unchecking complete and trying to fill in the tape? That's

Speaker 2  17:39
what I've been doing, and it's worked fine, but I don't know is, why does it say I'm editing that page? Because I'm not in edit mode.

Speaker 1  17:48
Well, okay, that one specifically, Leanne said the same thing. She said, I can't, I can't edit it because it says Drew's editing it. So she said, it might mean, oh, that's the only window open

Matthias Miller  18:02
the that's, that's a, that is a warning. It's a hey, if you go ahead and save this thing, Drew won't be able to save his changes. Well, Drew doesn't care. So, I mean, if, if, if you can, if you can, have them, just jump in and uncheck the complete box and make it right and jump back out. I don't know. I kind of think that's a little obnoxious, but it might be, well, maybe about the same as trying to shuffle spreadsheet through.

Speaker 1  18:42
I like that approach. I mean, they have, they have a lot of or they have capacity to do a lot of data entrants, what the and it also helps train them moving forward. What? Yeah. I mean, if, if you could send that list, I can just have them do that,

Matthias Miller  19:06
just on completely and on the emails, sure,

Speaker 1  19:16
then I'll just connect with her on what needs done. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:26
Payment date, payment method, or both, Ruby and I'll let you coordinate with Mark on what needs to be done. So

Unknown Speaker  19:50
so maybe I got access? They don't.

Matthias Miller  19:55
No, I don't think so. I don't know. We'll grab. Said bridge when we get there, if we don't think it should be an issue. All right, so I'm going to actually reply to this email so that others are not and we've got some i

Matthias Miller  20:29
All right, so that takes care of that one, sales tax that one's resolved.

Unknown Speaker  20:41
Did that make sense?

Matthias Miller  20:48
The which one,

Unknown Speaker  20:53
what's still needed

Unknown Speaker  20:59
on the sales tax? Right? I think my understanding

Matthias Miller  21:13
is, what's left is you need to work with

Unknown Speaker  21:17
third, second, one down there. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:19
what I understand this one right. Seth said that there was one in the live system that met this condition, but he handled it so, oh,

Unknown Speaker  21:33
okay, okay,

Speaker 2  21:38
which is probably something that's not even supposed to be marked that way. But anyway,

Speaker 2  21:50
then, did you are we able to get the breakdown for local taxes from tax jar?

Matthias Miller  22:02
That's a texture will will provide it, but I don't think we're storing it. So that's a Josh question on storing it so that we can get access to it. That's all his world,

Speaker 2  22:14
okay, and but that's the only way that we could have that we can have those numbers broken down,

Unknown Speaker  22:23
right?

Matthias Miller  22:25
Yes, correct, unless, I don't know, unless you want to, I don't think you want to do this, but I mean, if you want to manually put in what state rates are everywhere, I guess we could calculate the state rate and round and subtract that from the total tax charged and assume that the balance is whatever it is, but that doesn't, that doesn't give you county versus city if there's county versus City rates, yeah,

Speaker 2  23:00
and there is okay. I mean, it's very rare, but, but that does happen.

Matthias Miller  23:16
Yeah, sorry,

Unknown Speaker  23:18
yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  23:39
Well, I think we just pursue that with Josh. Then, yep, if, if he brings that in, that information in, then what we just add lines, add columns to the report. That'd be how that would work.

Matthias Miller  23:58
Yeah, we, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:01
and I would,

Matthias Miller  24:03
I think Seth, by this point, has already taken this, they made this a standard report. So I think it's just a matter of, I mean, I don't know, Josh, you probably might be could. Could be just as easy for Josh to add those columns In. I

Matthias Miller  24:40
wait a minute. Maybe he hasn't yet.

Unknown Speaker  24:45
No, maybe not

Matthias Miller  24:55
taxable. Maybe waiting for me to take a look at it. I. Well, let's take a look at at this though to make sure. So if it, if it's exempt, the sales orders exempt. We It's always, it's never taxable at all, ever. Otherwise, we take the subtotal plus shipping, and if shipping is taxable, then we include it, else we don't, and then the non taxable is simply if it's exempt. Let me go take a look at how this thing ran

Speaker 1  25:42
back down. Exact opposite. No, no, sorry, go ahead. I've got Never mind, keep going.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
So then if

Matthias Miller  25:57
I mean, couldn't we just do I gross sales minus taxable Sales,

Unknown Speaker  26:12
and then

Matthias Miller  26:17
calculate non taxable Sales,

Speaker 3  26:18
yeah, yeah. I Yeah, so

Matthias Miller  26:44
it shouldn't be. It's just it has no functional change in how He's put the report together. It's just

Unknown Speaker  26:55
to be,

Speaker 3  27:22
I'm all right, good.

Matthias Miller  27:32
So I mean this, this report is showing the actually, let me make this clear. I

Matthias Miller  27:50
so I think this report, the this report here, is still usable. We'll take it standard. Whenever Josh, I ran against Dwayne. Dwayne's happy with it, and whenever he is, yeah, and then Seth can take it live, and it'll be replaced the current sales tax on other menu, and Josh can update that one Sure.

Unknown Speaker  28:26
Good.

Matthias Miller  28:29
And then you also wanted to talk about write offs.

Unknown Speaker  28:37
I did. I mean, I did

Matthias Miller  28:41
or No, yeah, that

Speaker 2  28:50
would have been a while back. Um, so we've been doing those emails about how they how the accounts work.

Speaker 2  29:08
I mean, I guess it will work to just follow the logic to do it backwards when assigning the other accounts right, like some of them didn't give an option, like it had to be the debit had to be accounts receivable, like, I don't know if that's some stuff you have set in the back or

Matthias Miller  29:27
yes, because let's go find it configured payment methods, if it applies to the so balance that it has to affect accounts receivable. If it allows deposit, it has to affect undeposited funds on the other side, I.

Speaker 2  30:03
So a customer overpayment. Okay, so the way this is set up is that you would enter the whole payment, like they send a check for $5,000 and they were only supposed to pay 4500 so you would enter the check $5,000 deposit it, whatever, make the payment. Oh, it's an overpayment of 500 bucks. Then you write another line for $500 overpayment, right?

Matthias Miller  30:42
And with the negative 500 to make the balance. I mean, it'd be negative to take the balance. No, it would be, yeah, it'd be a negative payment, like a refund, quote, quote, take the balance back up from negative 500 to 500

Unknown Speaker  30:58
Yeah, yeah. Okay,

Speaker 2  31:02
all right. That makes Yeah. That makes sense. Because I keep looking at this and I think, well, customer overpayments that can be deposited, but it's not deposited because, because they're supposed to write the whole payment in the first line that was actually made, not just the 4500 and then say, Oh, and there's $500 of overpayment.

Matthias Miller  31:25
If you wanted to, this would be better named as an adjustment for, you know, kind of overpayment, or something like that. That

Unknown Speaker  31:35
would, that would make more,

Unknown Speaker  31:39
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  31:41
Do you do you want that change? I mean, I can let you make it. I can make that change. You

Speaker 2  31:46
got it right there. Just go ahead and change it. I'll change the others then, and then I'll do the same. Okay.

Matthias Miller  31:54
So, yeah, yeah, exactly. And then, I mean,

Speaker 3  31:58
it is a bit of a but the good news

Matthias Miller  32:03
financing fee,

Unknown Speaker  32:06
yeah,

Matthias Miller  32:09
it's, it's. The bad news is, it's a real mind vendor to get it set up. The good news is, because we require positive and negative amounts, nobody has to think about it up, so I don't know,

Speaker 2  32:28
yeah, okay, because I think that was part of what was throwing me off, as I was thinking about how to set these up, was, Well, if this is the paid portion,

Unknown Speaker  32:41
so, yeah, right. Okay,

Speaker 2  32:45
I think it'll Yeah, I think it'll work. I'll double check some to make sure that they're applying all correctly. So,

Unknown Speaker  32:59
okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  33:05
What else? Anything

Unknown Speaker  33:08
else? I think that was it for me.

Speaker 1  33:15
Okay, I've got a few things. I'll just send out an email. I don't have everything here yet, but the first thing Matthias was the sorting on that AR report, which I sent to you yesterday. Don't know if you I'm sure that's an easy change, but

Matthias Miller  33:37
what's the priority? My constant question was, the priority on it?

Speaker 1  33:48
I get it, yeah. I mean, it's a pretty straightforward update, right?

Matthias Miller  34:00
Yeah, let me. Let me forward this to,

Speaker 1  34:14
what about does? What about changing? Or are you? Are you changing okay with requiring payment date and method on the sales on on the payments RG, that forces accounting and AR to be accounting and the accounts receivable report to be same, right? Or backing up. So, okay, what, what we're, what we're working on right now is, so we have banks, one obviously, one go to the line of credit, Bill, one financial statement, so one balance. Sheet. And then they also, at least the one bank is asking for an Accounts an AR Aging report, which we were just going this is what we were going to use, the accounts receivable report. And so that's why we need the sorting fakes. But then we also need to make sure that if the balance sheet says we have 250,000 in AR, then these reports need to total up to that as well. So we're working to get that those to sync, but and they should with these ones. We're done with these manual updates, and we make those fields a required field on the payments. RG, right. Or is there something else that we should be Yeah, well,

Matthias Miller  35:52
I mean, it depends how. Depends what kind of is this a all hands on deck. We have to, have to have to have numbers on Monday, or else things go up in flames. Or is they, is there a Hey? Well, let's fix the known issues, and then let's go reevaluate and figure out what else is, what else is wrong, and go from there,

Unknown Speaker  36:16
the latter.

Matthias Miller  36:20
So then, no, I mean, if it is the latter, then what I would do is, is, I would let's go make this change. It seems very likely to me this is going to clean up. I mean, this is going to clean up known discrepancies. And and based, based on that, will will reevaluate any fixes.

Speaker 1  36:58
Well, what was it will reevaluate then you're saying later,

Matthias Miller  37:05
yeah, I mean, we'll, we'll make these changes this week. Have Josh an update on over the weekend. Take a look Monday, look for discrepancies, and then figure out why those things are different.

Unknown Speaker  37:16
I think that's great. Thoughts on that drew

Unknown Speaker  37:19
I you?

Speaker 1  37:27
Okay, good. I was just looking at number two. DREW You. I was just looking at this has updated. Come off of the accounts receivable report that other one that you were looking at was there? Did you just back out of that and wanted Berman to update that?

Speaker 2  37:45
Right, right? I figured it's on the list, so let's let them do it.

Speaker 1  37:50
Sure. Now I did see I wasn't trying to be really picky, that you dated it for 1130 24 and I said, Well, we probably should also, or is there a reason we should allot Is there a reason not to prevent anyone from entering a payment date in the future? Like it seems logically wrong for anyone to be able to enter a payment date in the future, which would be like you're entering a payment you shouldn't say customer promised the check tomorrow, so I'm going to put it in as of tomorrow, because you never should put in a payment date unless the payment has happened. Or are there situations where we should, where that would get us in trouble if we prevent that?

Speaker 2  38:38
I don't, I don't think so. I mean, when it comes to paying vendors, you know, then we ought to give at least 30 days. But as far as receiving payments, I don't, I don't think so. But yeah, that's another reason why I backed it out. I was like, Well, I gotta change that. So I'll just let them change the whole thing because it's on their list. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  39:10
So Matthias, if you make so you want to

Matthias Miller  39:17
Josh's famous time travel is not allowed.

Speaker 1  39:22
Yeah. Yeah. Dwayne brings that up from time to time that you can Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:31
Sounds good with this. The

Speaker 1  39:33
other so good the next one managing refund on I just threw this in here because Leah and I were looking at this this morning. So I know we haven't made we haven't tackled refunds yet from software functionality, but so I totally Anne while I want to talk with you drew on how to handle this refund. So if we take a look at that, I. Yeah, that invoice. What's the best way to handle that in the here and now, with what we have the customer? So the customer got his money back, and I think it's noted on the sales order, but it's not taking the balance to zero, and therefore it's still showing up on the on accounts receivable. I

Unknown Speaker  40:57
So

Matthias Miller  41:00
Drew, you looking that up, was that question for Drew?

Speaker 1  41:06
Yeah, it was a question for for Drew, but I thought you might have some value to add Matthias.

Unknown Speaker  41:25
So why is this not affecting?

Speaker 2  41:41
Okay, so they're both, they're both written on there,

Speaker 2  41:51
if, if we just cancel it, does that change anything? Because I believe these two, this positive and negative will function correctly, as far as AR goes,

Matthias Miller  42:20
I would agree,

Speaker 2  42:23
yeah, if they're in their undeposited funds and AR, they get back to round. So therefore, if we just mark it canceled, then that will take care of the sales. That will reverse the sales and AR, then at that point,

Speaker 1  42:42
I Oh, so this is a situation where the entire sales order got canceled.

Speaker 2  42:50
Well, the entire thing was refunded, yeah, which I'm assuming canceled, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:02
So is this something that so?

Speaker 2  43:04
But if it were only $50 were refunded, that wouldn't work. AR would be correct. Well, no, what would the balance be? Then?

Unknown Speaker  43:29
Would it for the $50 or do? But then you'd have to adjust the invoice and say, why? Like you gave them a $50 discount. That's why you gave them the money back.

Speaker 1  43:51
And then if that would, if that were to happen, say, two months later, then it would just change the invoice amount. It would lower the sales amount on the income statement by $50 back on the day that it originally was the in, right,

Matthias Miller  44:08
right, which is,

Speaker 1  44:11
is, is okay. I mean, rather than it hitting returns and allowances two months later, when we actually would do that allowance, I would say that that's fine for right now. It's not the ideal long term once we build out refund functionality. But

Unknown Speaker  44:31
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  44:32
I don't, I don't know. I feel like the the refund thing is something we want to do at some point, but I feel less strongly about the urgency of it than I did. Would you do you feel like that's something that, even if we would wait till the end of this year or first of next year to do that, that that will create big issues? DREW?

Unknown Speaker  44:57
No, I don't think so. I. Mean,

Speaker 2  45:02
so I am saving the reports that I file sales tax on, you know, so therefore, if there's ever, but you know, why did you pay this much? Well, it's, it's on that report. Something may have changed since, you know, but as the time of I didn't, we didn't know about it. So,

Speaker 1  45:29
so if we follow this logic, you would have paid, I don't know the probably like this would have been a February or March, not sure what the invoice date is.

Unknown Speaker  45:40
Yeah, we paid $33.08 of tax on this that we never received,

Unknown Speaker  45:48
but now by canceling it. Well, right now, we're not catching that, but

Speaker 2  45:58
yeah, we could go back and file an amendment and say, oh, actually it was this much less. Whereas, if we could do the refunds the way we are hoping, we could say, this month, we refunded X dollars, and therefore we have to pay this much less tax this month if we cancel this. Well, no, since we're canceling this whole one, that that cancelation goes on this month, although I still don't think, excuse me, we're still not picking that up. Because what I noticed, well, this goes back to the sales tax report. Um, if I push the well, maybe you need to verify this. But what I was seeing is if I push the button select the checkbox for to include canceled orders. That means, include the sale as a sale, not include whatever was canceled this month and subtract it so

Speaker 1  47:03
I think what we'd said was, was that sales tax functionality, if we have that done by, I think we've looked at some time in like September, so have this done before the end of the year, then it would correctly show that then, you know, it would. It would historically catch all of these cancelations and, yeah, we would just pay that much less in October. Yeah, right. Okay, good. Um,

Unknown Speaker  47:40
so I thought I had

Speaker 2  47:42
another being this one here. I mean, shall I just do it? I'll just cancel it.

Speaker 1  47:47
Yeah, yeah. I do, yeah, just go ahead and cancel it.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
Good. So the only other thing I think I had massage is something on, let me just send it to you here, some questions on payroll module update. Let me know when you get that and

Speaker 2  48:35
while you're waiting there. Matthias, did you get my warning? There was another thing that I found that I don't think I've sent Over reconcile warning or warning I get while reconciling,

Unknown Speaker  48:54
but

Matthias Miller  49:02
Wait, what am I looking for? Drew

Speaker 2  49:05
as in to warn email with a warning that I got while I was reconciling last week.

Matthias Miller  49:16
Just now you send it,

Unknown Speaker  49:17
yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  49:22
Okay. Still hasn't come over

Unknown Speaker  49:26
yet. It was 1008, well, no, it was 15 minutes ago. I

Unknown Speaker  49:44
see,

Unknown Speaker  49:47
what am I missing? I.

Unknown Speaker  50:02
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  50:18
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  50:21
any of you tried Andrew, or what happened, Mark? I got your email.

Speaker 1  50:27
Okay. So, just trying to figure out. So I think what happened? So the first two sheets, number one, they okay. I think it was they changed employee settings, but it did not update the payments, the pay stub information, or any of this settings here. So then the last two pages of email to they updated the rate on the time cart, which then updated everything correctly. I think they wanted to update the pool bonus percentage. Now it's all fine, then we don't have to do anything with that. Was that, because this they were like they thought they should be able to go to the the employee Settings Update whatever they want to add of an effective date, and it should all work from that effective date forward. You know why? Why they had to make the update on the time card in order to update it correct? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  51:35
because, if somebody gets the brainy idea to go back and change change an effective date as of February 1, and you already paid the guy. You really don't want it to go update. I don't know. You already paid him at the old rate. This is sorry, and they were too late in the game. We had already created the time cards and frozen their compensation. So the lesson is, basically, I forget exactly what the what the schedule is. I could probably find it out now, it's something like every let's see time cards

Unknown Speaker  52:11
Monday.

Matthias Miller  52:15
I mean, it looks like every Monday morning we are creating time cards. Yeah, time crisp entered every Monday. We ought to create them as close to that date as possible, so the compensation values are right on the time card. So, I mean, the real thing we do is, if you're planning to change somebody's compensation, let them know before the Monday. Okay, before Monday, or just fixing both places.

Speaker 1  52:43
You have to change it before Monday. Is it before you enter, enter hours into the time card? Or is it you always have to change it before Monday,

Matthias Miller  52:53
even if you have literally before Monday.

Speaker 1  52:56
Okay, any changes made after Monday for that week you have to do directly on the time card

Matthias Miller  53:06
as as well. Yes, you still want to do it in both places.

Speaker 1  53:15
Oh, yeah, yeah, if you don't do it in both places, then it would only be effective for that week, right? Yep,

Matthias Miller  53:22
only effective for that week or and then you don't do it in both places. Somebody's gonna ask a question of, hey, wouldn't we change the rate and well, we changed another time card, but the other one says we, you know, I don't know what, just okay. Lesson is,

Unknown Speaker  53:42
yeah, got it,

Speaker 2  53:46
yeah, going back and changing compensation is much stickier than than just saying, Oh, by the way, ask me if you want to pay them this much.

Unknown Speaker  54:01
Yeah.

Speaker 2  54:04
Especially once you have, like you said, you know the taxes all figured, yeah, yeah, that's no go, making

Matthias Miller  54:13
people behave.

Unknown Speaker  54:20
All right, well,

Matthias Miller  54:21
I might, we've got Joel and Audra joining a few minutes. I might drop off for a quick break, if that's good, and we'll take a look at the projects. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  54:37
sounds good. All right,

Matthias Miller  54:39
okay, see you guys in a few.

Unknown Speaker  57:29
Hey, Joel,

Unknown Speaker  57:31
yeah, hey, Audra,

Unknown Speaker  57:32
good to see you.

Unknown Speaker  57:33
You too.

Unknown Speaker  57:42
Drew

Unknown Speaker  57:44
Hey, Drew,

Unknown Speaker  57:56
great to see you.

Unknown Speaker  58:05
All right, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  58:07
Good morning. You.

Unknown Speaker  58:26
How's it going so far? This morning,

Matthias Miller  58:31
good got a whole bunch of problems, knocked out.

Speaker 3  58:33
Great. Wow. Rock on exactly the way to start the day. It's fun.

Matthias Miller  58:42
Drew is Mark willing to

Unknown Speaker  58:45
Yeah, I think so

Matthias Miller  58:46
hop back on. Okay, we might give him, give him a few minutes to circle back around. Okay?

Speaker 4  58:57
I saw a couple new change requests this morning. I think I captured one, all of them that I saw, at least, so

Unknown Speaker  59:03
that's good, cool,

Unknown Speaker  59:07
I guess. Joel, do you have? Oh, go ahead.

Speaker 5  59:10
Oh, sorry. I was just going to say, if nothing else, this is a I was using the few minutes prior to this call to work on a spec to have someone else code some of the loose ends of The Cash Flow job. So nice I get the having a call on the schedule is just a wonderful focus

Unknown Speaker  59:50
mechanism.

Matthias Miller  59:53
Do you is cash flows? Though? The main thing on your list, is there anything else? Okay, I don't. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
Know of anything else Drew?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
No, I think that's actually

Speaker 3  1:00:05
my mind anyway. Oh, wait, well, I've got this. Yeah, I've got, oh, that's

Speaker 4  1:00:11
payables funded warning, I think is the only thing that I have for you. Joel, but okay, um, anything else

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
Okay, let me just check. I think I fixed that a while ago.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
I but

Speaker 5  1:00:47
Let me confirm it's not just sitting on my computer somewhere.

Speaker 5  1:01:01
Okay, I think that should be resolved. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:01:06
there might actually be one other thing, Joel, let me see if Drew, sent something over this morning, and okay,

Speaker 5  1:01:14
oh, okay, I guess I did say you did send it. Okay, cool,

Speaker 4  1:01:18
haven't updated it. Drew. Do you need to look at this again, or can we close it?

Speaker 2  1:01:25
No. I mean, I don't know what they do. They don't stop me from doing what I need to do. So they went away. If they didn't, if they show up again, I'll just resend it again. Brilliant,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:37
brilliant.

Matthias Miller  1:01:42
Drew, got an error during reconciliation that account, translating reconcile statement, end date entry is not editable.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:50
That's not good.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:56
I don't know of anything. It

Speaker 5  1:02:00
actually echoes something some of our accounting people on code crackers have seen,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
we need to get that done.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
Do you know what it is?

Speaker 5  1:02:18
Not offhand? I mean, it's, it has to do with the mechanism we're we're using to set, to do the reconcile report and to tie it to a specific statement. But I don't know what is. What is actually triggering the

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
the error got

Speaker 2  1:02:41
it? Does it actually keep it from reconciling, or marking the items as reconciled? I mean, all the reporting that I've seen, it looks like it actually is still working. Okay,

Speaker 5  1:02:54
I think you can. I think if it looks like it's working, it is working. But

Speaker 2  1:03:05
because, like, if I reconcile one period and I get that warning and I go to the following period of the same account, it it has adjusted the balance of reconcile items, good,

Matthias Miller  1:03:17
yeah, let's pull over these records so this the date range you were doing, was the April, month of April.

Speaker 2  1:03:35
I mean, the I was working on some a I think

Matthias Miller  1:03:43
so let me, let's just do this, and I'm going to take over your screen here. Here is the warning, 892838928, and let me also pull up, 38932, 38932932,

Matthias Miller  1:04:07
and Then 401-224-0122

Matthias Miller  1:04:15
and then 401-274-0127 Okay, so this one shows it was reconciled in April. This one April, this one April, this one April. So, but if you were trying to reconcile in April, reconcile May.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
We've got a problem.

Speaker 2  1:04:48
When did that morning? When was that event?

Matthias Miller  1:04:54
Wait, but you changed it to this is in the. Last this one was sorry. What was that? It was the May 25 reconcile when you were doing it.

Speaker 2  1:05:07
Okay, so that probably would have been an April reconcile. Then in that good it's, I've been getting the warning for a little while. So

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
1824 but why would you I'm confused, though, because you got this error. This shows 718, 24

Speaker 5  1:05:31
statement in date entry. That isn't that the vestigial field, or something very close, or macro. Rather,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:47
let's go take a look. It's

Speaker 5  1:05:59
incredible that it's taken me this long to pick up on that, but

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
Joe, you might have to I've Got out of date executables

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:22
I let's see.

Speaker 5  1:06:29
Oops, okay, I can't override your share, but, Oh, here,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
let's

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
let's see. I guess I'll

Unknown Speaker  1:07:06
a visible not,

Speaker 5  1:07:09
okay, so it's somewhere in here, but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:16
Well, if it's, it can never be set.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
If it's not in detail screen or

Unknown Speaker  1:07:30
yeah, oh, right, but

Matthias Miller  1:07:34
the not in detail screen should always

Speaker 5  1:07:38
allow it. Oh, true. Okay. Do you know what the history is of that transaction? Well, of that field, actually? Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:08:04
wait, that's not a, that's not a that's a generic. Is that a generic field?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:10
Oh, oh yes, it Wait, it is. But why? I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:31
Okay, sorry,

Speaker 5  1:08:40
huh. I can't actually even see a way to share my Full screen right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
Fascinating, anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
So, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21
oh,

Speaker 5  1:09:24
well, okay. Question, should we be doing this online now or

Matthias Miller  1:09:31
not? I think the biggest question is, I mean, we don't need to. I don't know that there's much most of us can contribute. I think Sure. The question ultimately is, whose court should it be in to troubleshoot? Is this? It's core accounting, I believe so. I think it falls

Speaker 5  1:09:56
over here, over there, yeah, yeah. I think that's. Right? I can, I can drive forward with it, although I will lightly get other people to do the actual work. But

Speaker 4  1:10:14
we have this on the radar already. Or do I need to create a task for it? And what should I call it?

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
I am creating an incident. It's a warning when reconciling and then Joel, I will shoot you an email with or Joel and Audrey, should you both an email with the link to the incident? Excellent.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
Thank you. Good,

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
cool. All right. Well, I think so, Mark, you're you're on now bottom line, Joel's working to delegate loosens on cash flows. Drew ran into an issue when reconciling that Joel's gonna chase or have somebody on his team Chase. And we think that's all we need from Joel,

Speaker 5  1:11:02
yeah, and actually, I do have one follow up question, since my thing, just my search here, just actually came back with something. So this was added initially as sort of a stopgap prior to to associate transactions with specific statements, prior to getting our full reconciliation structure in place. Is this still a useful field for you

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
drew? Are you happy with how transactions are showing up linked to the right statements. Is there any any that jumped around that are not where you want it to be?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
You're muted. I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
sorry,

Speaker 2  1:12:05
are you saying if I want like they're going to be locked into the period that they're in, or are you wondering if I'm happy with how it shows up in reporting and that kind of thing?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:22
Which period they're locked into

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
like

Speaker 2  1:12:34
so it's not at all uncommon for me to reconcile a period and then somebody finally gets a receipt entered, or gets a receipt handed into the office. And then AP does not realize that it's ready in the system, because I entered it to reconcile. And so they go create another one with all the documentation and everything. So then, if there's several of those in one statement, it's kind of simple and cleanest for me to just go back to that, reconcile, delete the ones that I created and pull in the ones that they created since, rather than try to transfer all that data over to mine that I already have reconciled. So if it messes with the functionality to be able to, you know, to do some of that, I'd be a little hesitant. But

Matthias Miller  1:13:34
no, it's only i It's only old information. There's a period of time and we were trying to save, I don't know, probably back in 23 sometime trying to save, remember which things get tied up to which? I don't know. I think the bottom line is, Joel, it's old, yeah. Need to keep it remove. And if we'll have the field and we will have the values and activity history, if, if, for some reason we need to, it's obnoxious to pull it out, but we we could pull out the old accounting end dates, if we need their statement, end dates, if we really needed to.

Speaker 5  1:14:12
Okay, so, so your inclination would be, preserve the field. Zap the macro. Zap the entry. Macro.

Matthias Miller  1:14:20
Do you need to preserve the field? My inclination is nuke the field in the macro. And if you ever need to get the data, it's go search activity history.

Speaker 5  1:14:31
If we zap the field, does that get preserved? Oh, wait, does it? Um, no, there's a very good chance it does, because it's, I would guess it does, actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
I would think it should, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:50
yeah, yeah, because we are independent, yeah. Okay, cool, that, ah. A very simple solution to problems is to destroy the thing that has a problem.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
Exactly, okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:12
I think I've got my path forward.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
Cool. Thank you. Thanks, Joel. Have a great one. Good bye. Goodbye. All

Matthias Miller  1:15:26
right. Otto, back to you again. And this is just a note I've got. I can go a few minutes past 11 Eastern, but I'm gonna have to

Unknown Speaker  1:15:39
drop okay. Well, is there

Speaker 4  1:15:40
anything we need to prioritize? Then get through all of yours.

Matthias Miller  1:15:46
I think what I would like to do, let's go through, yeah, let's, let's go through

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
mine

Speaker 4  1:15:58
so you have credit to sales or a payment, not

Matthias Miller  1:16:02
posting is there? What's the comment?

Speaker 4  1:16:06
It's not linked to. Stin doesn't have a dealer. Set the dealer to get the payment, slash deposit, then set the invoicing date.

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
I think this, this is eons ago, but truly, I think, I think, I think we can mark it resolved. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
How about duplication warning criteria.

Matthias Miller  1:16:29
I know I had started taking a look at that, and then I don't remember how I got let me take a

Unknown Speaker  1:16:34
look. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
uh, that should be live already. So Drew, I don't know if you want to try it out.

Speaker 4  1:17:01
Okay, fees slash premiums versus write offs.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:12
I think

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
we go into that. I

Matthias Miller  1:17:30
I think everything but the refunds, let's, let's do, let me know we're going to write up a separate change request for refunds, because we want to handle that separately and we can prioritize that some sort of grants and refunds per

Matthias Miller  1:18:05
so are you aware of Drew? Did you take a look at how those are getting pushed across to accounting, whether you're happy with it or

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14
the credits like,

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
yeah, financing fees, financing payments, customer overpayments, underpayments, etc.

Speaker 2  1:18:28
But I want to look at that some more. Okay, it's, I think it's all right. On your end, it's more a matter of if I have it set up correctly or not.

Matthias Miller  1:18:40
Okay, Audrey, let's assign this to Drew for implementation and make sure that he's happy with with it. The one thing I didn't do mark we had talked about migrating a bunch of the write off stuff, and I think we should. I would actually here, let's do this. I want to create two other incidents, and I think we want to discuss priority. I think we need to,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:14
need to figure out.

Matthias Miller  1:19:19
I think I'm likely looking to scale back. Well, I mean, I'm already scaling back my involvement in accounting, and I think we need to be pretty intentional with a scaled back budget on what we actually prioritize to make sure that the really critical pieces get done by the end of the year. And so I would propose that the migrating write offs and migrating stripe things would be a separate let me write it up separately and take a look at that on a case by case basis. So.

Matthias Miller  1:20:03
Does that make sense to you?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:04
Mark,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:07
it does, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:20:13
So I'm writing one up. Migrate, historical stripe. Payments a stripe these two separate payments, all right, so that then, yep, that takes care of that part, handling historically reconciled transactions and the shifting reconcile numbers. I'm delegating that to Seth, but I have almost zero availability this week, and so rather than we have in the live system, we're gonna He's gonna take a look at it early next week so that I can review it by the end of the week, before we completely throw the live system sideways,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:00
we need to change the due date or just update that. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  1:21:06
think I mean, we do need to change the due date to, I would change it to end of next end of next week. Maybe.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:18
Okay about sales tax report.

Matthias Miller  1:21:22
I think we're done. There's a little bit of Seth needs to take it standard. Josh needs to make some changes, but that's in Josh's that's for Drew to manage with Josh not we don't have to handle that here.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:37
So

Matthias Miller  1:21:40
for phase one, at least this is done. And this is 10186, okay, we

Unknown Speaker  1:21:49
take a look at but we should do a no, this is all here. Okay, nope, I think so. I think

Unknown Speaker  1:21:59
leave it open, but give it to Seth, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:09
great process for moving payments from one so to another. We

Matthias Miller  1:22:15
were going to wait to until we have the refunds discussion, and we haven't had the refunds discussion. So that's going to be, or we, I guess we had the refunds discussion of how we kind of sort of thought we wanted to work. But that's not,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42
uh, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:48
do we Okay? Well, let's,

Matthias Miller  1:22:51
let's go through the list. Here's kind of in the interest of cutting to the chase, some of the things that we have on the list is refund checks, which affects the process for moving payments, asset management, handling asset assets on vendor invoices, beating up Gln Transaction Report,

Matthias Miller  1:23:18
standardizing a whole all the random reports we created. The sorting is underway, is delegated. Can you scroll down a little

Matthias Miller  1:23:35
bit? So I guess, what, from your guy, what, from your perspective, we've got locking down transactions, but what from you guys are, is a burning need that we need to, need to address.

Speaker 1  1:23:54
Can you run through the list again? Sorry, I should have made notes, but I didn't. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:23:58
I think the big ones that we had for end of July are refunds, handling assets on vendor invoices and speeding up the GL and transaction report. What about the

Speaker 1  1:24:13
payroll change thing you were going to map that out?

Matthias Miller  1:24:16
Oh, that's right, yes, payrolls in the list to map out we had, we had it on our list, to take all the random, miscellaneous reports that I made for you guys and make them standard.

Speaker 1  1:24:35
And what, okay, what are those like? The those are all tied to accounting. Yes, right? Like, is it the built buildings report and the FDI by sales order report, or are some of those standard already

Unknown Speaker  1:24:55
stuff that I have? I.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:01
What was that drew?

Speaker 2  1:25:03
It's a bunch of stuff that I have. I need to go through and figure out which ones we want to save as standard reports.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:14
Yeah, which I have not

Unknown Speaker  1:25:15
yet done. I

Speaker 1  1:25:24
them. Well, the ones that I need standard, that I want standard, I'm asking Josh to add those two. Obviously they need to be standard, so Josh can put them on the SKU data sheet, like I'm sure the balance sheet and the income statement are, but the transactions, the other three that

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
are, I guess,

Speaker 1  1:25:45
important to me right now, are the transactions by contact the built buildings report and sales orders by FGI.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:00
Are any of those? Which of those are standard

Unknown Speaker  1:26:08
contact? The only one that I would say is,

Speaker 1  1:26:16
okay, well, then it sounds like that. We need to, maybe you and I should collaborate on, on, on, we need to have a list before performance can do that. So just Okay, off top of my head, I would say, what's important for

Unknown Speaker  1:26:35
refunds we talked about that could be pushed out, is the assets thing, because hopefully here in August, we can start creating new assets in the asset management table. And my understanding is that with what we have currently we we cannot do that. Well, is that correct?

Matthias Miller  1:27:09
They don't currently link to vendor invoices.

Speaker 1  1:27:12
Okay? So we couldn't get because we have a whole bunch of vendor invoices, just push to that or tag to that BL account. But drew if you say that speeding up GL accounts and transaction accounts is more important or something else than I would say we do that before.

Speaker 2  1:27:33
No Do Do your thing first.

Matthias Miller  1:27:37
So handle assets and then lockdown reconciles,

Matthias Miller  1:27:47
and that's going to take us until next meeting. Anyway,

Speaker 2  1:27:53
this lockdown reconciles is that not allowing them to change a trend like a vendor invoice payment, if it has been reconciled,

Matthias Miller  1:28:05
yes, correct, and then giving you a warning in that case,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:10
yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  1:28:17
So Matthias timeframe on that asset management thing is that that that won't be live or that won't be done by next week, though, will it?

Matthias Miller  1:28:28
I mean, it get done next week. It won't be live by this weekend, but I would think it could get done by next weekend.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:36
Okay, so live by August 2 or so,

Matthias Miller  1:28:44
well, August, 5.

Speaker 1  1:28:47
I mean, our fifth Sure, yeah, right, good, yeah, perfect. We won't get to it before then, anyway. But, yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:00
sounds good. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:04
anything else,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11

Unknown Speaker  1:29:14
