Matthias Miller  00:09
Not that we ever use it like in my business partnership with my brother, I did feel like there was a bit of I don't he didn't want me to feel second rate, and he tried to find ways not to make me and cater to me, but he didn't really know how

Unknown Speaker  00:29
give me a second.

Unknown Speaker  00:29
Yep, you

Unknown Speaker  00:49
all right, thanks, yeah, you know, by the way,

Unknown Speaker  00:55
yeah, just,

Unknown Speaker  00:56
you just gave, gave, uh,

Unknown Speaker  01:05
I like second rate.

Unknown Speaker  01:12
Yes, my 10. I

Unknown Speaker  01:25
hoping second can not be second rate, not take second place sounds nicer,

Matthias Miller  01:37
sounds nicer, and it's got more emotional.

Unknown Speaker  01:40
Okay,

Speaker 1  01:44
I mean, maybe that's a lead in is, hey, you're not, you're not second rate.

Matthias Miller  01:51
I mean, I think it's one of those phrases that potentially has some really good legs, yeah, but not the Yeah. Maybe not the hook. I don't know that's my inclination, but

Speaker 1  02:09
I did. I did the LinkedIn banner. I don't know if you can see it on the business side, by

Matthias Miller  02:18
the way, I don't think the 100 proof is public, so that's one of the that's why I can't select it as a role. Gotcha.

Speaker 1  02:32
Do you need to? I think, do you need to register a business first? And then I

Unknown Speaker  02:48
I'm not sure. Hey,

Matthias Miller  02:53
no, it's there.

Unknown Speaker  02:55
Second in command is available. Well, to buy

Matthias Miller  03:08
with, with spelled out

Unknown Speaker  03:12
second in command, yeah, but it's, it's 30/702

Unknown Speaker  03:20
in command.

Matthias Miller  03:23
Why does Cameron Harold not have it?

Matthias Miller  03:36
He calls it the CEO. He calls himself the CEO whisperer,

Unknown Speaker  03:39
which doesn't feel as good.

Matthias Miller  03:46
That is, Why does nobody have that? That's

Speaker 1  03:50
a premium domain. I don't want to. I don't know if that's a distraction from 100 proof, but I think it's more aligned. It's like,

Matthias Miller  04:14
is it dumb to buy it on a payment plan?

Unknown Speaker  04:19
I don't think, I don't think you need to buy it. Now, that's a isn't that really tempting? Though it's

Matthias Miller  04:27
extremely tempting. It wouldn't be that there are other people in that space using that terminology. I wouldn't care

Unknown Speaker  04:37
my fact that. Why is that like? Who in that space is that

Matthias Miller  04:43
camera? Harold has a book called that the second in command.

Unknown Speaker  04:50
The second in command, unleash the power of your CEO. Co. And is he? He's a pretty important guy. I mean, I don't know that sheets. He's

Matthias Miller  05:11
that former that's not, that's something completely different, that's never gonna He's a pretty prophetic guy.

Speaker 1  05:17
I know I, I don't. I don't. Who cares? Like, usually a term, like, if you put strategy or something, you'll be competing with 1000s of other authors. There's only two authors,

Unknown Speaker  05:39
and one of them is business like, I think the world is big enough for two, second in command people should be

Speaker 1  05:55
and he gave you, he gave you thumbs up. He's he, he's already positioned in right, like, right, what's his website?

Matthias Miller  06:07
Cameron harrell.com Oh, yeah. And then coo alliance.com

Speaker 1  06:16
I, I think Matthias Miller is sufficient to start like buying a domain doesn't Solve, doesn't like, doesn't really solve anything but positioning wise, if you're going after corporate, okay,

Matthias Miller  06:54
what are You trying to solve for with a CEO? What

Unknown Speaker  07:02
was that?

Matthias Miller  07:04
What are you trying to solve for with the CEO?

Speaker 1  07:16
Like, why? Why was I having issues over the wording, the messaging

Matthias Miller  07:21
and like the offer, the offer page that you had up. What was the problem?

Speaker 1  07:28
Well, it's it's being targeted at the second in command. It's not being targeted the

Matthias Miller  07:36
why is that a problem?

Speaker 1  07:39
I don't see it as much of a problem now, because the book of this guy says, unleash the power of your CEO. So now I'm like, maybe, maybe that's actually, ultimately you're serving your the second in command. But maybe that's actually a great way of positioning it for the owner, right? Or CEO, which is, I get I helped you, I can help you get more out of your CEO, right? So I'm, I'm, I feel better about it now.

Matthias Miller  08:25
Does that mean go

Unknown Speaker  08:28
ahead? No, I want you to.

Matthias Miller  08:32
Does that mean you're happy and you found resolution, you ready to move on? Or does that mean I

Speaker 1  08:37
feel, I feel like, I feel like a little bomb went off inside my head. And I'm not sure if 100 proof you is something like we're attached to. And second in command is actually, on its own, a value communicator to to like, what, what I appreciate about, hands off CEO is in the name is like, it's, it's the names the ideal client and names the benefit, right? That's what, that's the kind of feel I get from second in command.

Speaker 1  09:39
And maybe, maybe Matthias Miller keeps under preview, under Matthias Miller, well, like you could still have your sanctuary under either, but, but, uh. Uh, and maybe 100 proof you is a is like IP under second in command, but maybe not the the like, the driver thing, because originally, when I met you 100 proof you felt like, Oh, this is a great tribal thing, right? I'm not sure if going after corporate, if they're as interested in a tribal thing, right? Like small business owners, you know, individuals like planet airy like, they can get into a tribal thing, but like, second in commands are very they don't have time to just, I don't know, I just don't I imagine they're the most time stressed people in the organization.

Speaker 1  11:17
Oh, nice, nice shoes. Did we ever tie shoes? I do lens, they're zero drop, but, yeah, you got the full toe splay?

Unknown Speaker  11:35
Yep. I

Speaker 1  11:43
I'm getting a pair of I think, I think the domain

Speaker 1  11:53
can really hold off until you get some second and command buyer. I here, like, if you can prove, if you can prove this, this thing, then you can align, you can tighten the focus, right?

Matthias Miller  12:15
What? What level of a buyer do I need? Well,

Unknown Speaker  12:22
what? Whichever second in command,

Matthias Miller  12:26
like that's beyond an individual but within a company context,

Unknown Speaker  12:33
right? I'm just saying the corporate focus.

Matthias Miller  12:40
Okay, well, are you so it sounds to me like

Matthias Miller  12:56
we are at round two of let's go reinvent ourselves again,

Speaker 1  13:05
right? That's, that's what was kind of exciting and maybe a little scary. But Round Two was, I feel like pivot to corporate. So in some sense, I think this is just like a refinement of of that.

Matthias Miller  13:33
But it's only a slight tweet.

Unknown Speaker  13:35
It's not, it's not a big shift. So what

Matthias Miller  13:40
pragmatically do you see changing? I'm trying to wrap my head around what you're

Unknown Speaker  13:48
saying. You're the advisor to second in commands like that's

Matthias Miller  14:07
which feels extremely congruent, right? Plus, I have all kinds of taps really deeply into my natural my natural ability in business. I

Matthias Miller  14:31
and it's, I have a client where he's called me his sales wizard for the first year. But we're talking about, he's looking to bring his wife into the business. We're talking about, changing the agreement his direct competitor got referred in by a sales guy friend of mine. Wants my help, and the second in command needs help. He needs mentorship. He needs leadership. He needs support. And I think. Uh, I've shied away from the shed industry, which is where I've got all kinds of background, but I've got another guy in the shed industry. Which industry? Shed, storage, shed, garden shed, yeah, um, who's looking to do a tactical triangle takeover? I actually talked to Mark Ingles about doing one, and it just timing didn't feel right, but I've got this other guy who's interested in doing it, so we're having a conversation in about a month about it. But I could call up any number of shed companies right now if I wanted to fill a caseload and say, Look, I have all this industry experience. Let me venture your second in command and let me get this thing running like a well oiled machine.

Unknown Speaker  15:47
I gotta, I Gotta get Something yep, yep.

Speaker 1  16:55
Okay, the the if I could express what I've arrived at, 100 per few feels very tribal. Second in command feels very individual, focused,

Unknown Speaker  17:13
right

Speaker 1  17:15
and like, because I had a vision of, like, 100 per view, like you have 100 members, something like that, second in command is, like you have, you have like 20 members,

Matthias Miller  17:36
right? Or two groups of 15, or something, or it's,

Speaker 1  17:39
it's very it's much more. It's not as much of like a rah, rah, you know, it's, it's, it's like,

Speaker 1  17:58
it's moving a little bit more out of the life coach and more into the a little bit more of the business side,

Matthias Miller  18:06
yeah, but, but then, so that's, it's

Speaker 1  18:10
up to you, and how, how you bring

Matthias Miller  18:15
those two pieces together?

Speaker 1  18:17
And so here's, here's the thought, um, uh, like, I don't maybe this isn't the right way of saying it, but the the Holy Spirit could be like the second in command. I don't know if he's like third in command, but, but like, but like, hey, my father is going to send you the spirit, right? Yeah. Like, hey, I'm sending, I'm giving you the spirit, right? It's like, you have a comforter, you have an advisor. Like, I, that's where I'm like, Oh, actually, this is kind of cool. There's, there is a second in command, like a heavenly thing.

Unknown Speaker  19:16
I mean, that's, isn't that cool? That's

Matthias Miller  19:17
really only do it is really cool. Never thought of that. Only do what I see My Father doing,

Speaker 1  19:30
you know what? I just felt like I hit my life's mission this morning. Okay, I was listening to Dallas, and he was talking about Paul's so maybe it's Paul's life mission, but Paul's vision was to be a servant to all, yeah, and like, appropriating the life of Christ so that he could do that. And like, I'm like, Oh, man. It's like, way bigger than what I'm doing. I'm like, stuck up on on myself. And so anyways, I I like the second in command. It's like, yeah, it's you're serving, but you have authority, right? You're interesting. You're a friend at the table, right? You know the father's plans. You're not a but you're like,

Matthias Miller  20:32
we're talk talking the concept of union in in a sense where it's not dictatorial or competitive, but it's co building, the vision of what the company should be collaborating. Yeah, co creation and collaboration. So that's all second

Unknown Speaker  20:54
in command language. Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  21:03
All right, well, my natural impatience is going to kick in all over again. And natural reaction is, if we have to reinvent ourselves one more time, I'm going to cry.

Unknown Speaker  21:19
I um,

Matthias Miller  21:23
like, what? Practically

Speaker 1  21:32
honestly. This is practically honestly. I think it feels so much easier to communicate because 100 proof is a little bit ethereal, and that's kind of what I like about it. But maybe that's not the right lead in if you're going to corporate, I'm not, I don't know. Maybe, um,

Unknown Speaker  22:03
uh, like, it kind of feels all

Speaker 1  22:16
like I totally think of 100 proof as, hey, you're a second in command. There's, there's like, value to your role. Um, you're not second place. So don't, like discount, don't compete, don't whatever, whatever it is, like, the 40% proof like, I think the 100% proof messaging fits in. That can fit, can fit in that context? Yep, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't say it's like, you're, you're cutting it out. It's just, what are you choosing to lead with in the the messaging of second in command? Like it's kind of interesting on your LinkedIn, we have second in command as your pitch, yeah, and there's 100 proof visuals, but you kind of see that it's already taken over, like, second and community has, it kind of has already taken over. And there's, there's visual and, like, there's, there's call outs to 100 proof. But I uh, it feels, it almost feels like a support element

Matthias Miller  23:48
to Yes, it does, because it is,

Matthias Miller  24:01
is this just a matter of repositioning it in their heads.

Speaker 1  24:04
This is, I think it's totally us, because one is, sorry, you bought the 100, but you did buy 100 proof website, but, but like, it's, you know, it's, it's just, I it's not even, it's kind of funny, even even your main page go to your website, right? A letter to the second in command. Yes, exactly

Matthias Miller  24:34
the Okay, so my story has it. Coaching is the biggest one, where we talk about past clients, include and we include second opinions.

Matthias Miller  24:59
And. I mean, we could tweak the packages a bit, sure,

Speaker 1  25:03
and we were going to do that anyways, because you're going after corporate, what's on here is actually 1.0 with, with, for Perry's group,

Matthias Miller  25:14
right? Okay, so, all right,

Unknown Speaker  25:19
let me summarize this. This is like massive

Matthias Miller  25:23
Marcos had this brain explosion and said, I thought we were creating 100 proof movement, and we're not. We're creating, like, second in command is the nucleus and the and the 100 proof is supporting stuff, and we are driving forward with second in command. And 100 proof is just here to help lighten the load in whatever way it can. And pragmatically, it's already,

Speaker 1  25:59
it's still the secret sauce, yes,

Matthias Miller  26:06
but it's the methodology now, not the brand I'm

Unknown Speaker  26:13
this makes total sense

Matthias Miller  26:16
there, and there is so ridiculously much alignment. I,

Speaker 1  26:23
I, I, I was very much married to 100 proof you. And I felt, I felt kind of sad when you said you wanted to go for corporate. And I'm like, well, but what does that mean with Perry's group? Because we had, we had cast a lot of vision around that.

Unknown Speaker  26:46
But if you're gonna go corporate, like, I can't think of better positioning than having it in the name.

Matthias Miller  27:02
So speaking of being married to the idea, I have a book title, drum roll.

Unknown Speaker  27:16
You just bought that

Matthias Miller  27:19
back in July.

Unknown Speaker  27:20
Okay, okay.

Matthias Miller  27:21
I was like, that's too good. I don't know why that's a book. That's a book. What, what mistress are you hanging around? Mistress marketing, whatever. There's different angles. How many people get anyway? That's hilarious. Maybe it's, it's probably one of those things I'm just blowing money on. But anyway, I still think you make great book title. Um, okay, good, yeah. And now we've come full circle, and we have room in Perry's work like this fits in, okay. But here's the other thing I want to show you something else. I don't know how many of these people I know I'm really aligned with, but check this out on my walk. The other I don't know if it was last night or when it was we have who works with second in commands, Francis, Richard Shaw, I don't know if that's spelled right. I don't think it is. I don't know these folks real well, but connected with some of Facebook. Brook elder, Jana Lee, Megan, Alexis, plus Karen height has is the second in command with JC, with with high agency and high digital and all their stuff. And they are launching a second in command cohorts for them. And, you know, chatted with her time or two. I'm at least on the fringes of her network. And like, there's all of these places where we could go, and, and, and somebody like Mandy. I

Unknown Speaker  29:10
was thinking of Mandy

Matthias Miller  29:15
is like, hey, like, let me like perfect partnership opportunity. I mean, you could, you could put, I don't know that he's a

Matthias Miller  29:32
I mean, all of a sudden, it's like there's all these pockets of people that are adjacent and very easily do introductions,

Speaker 1  29:41
and it still can work with the CEO also. So all the people who target CEOs, yes, meet someone who like that's it's perfectly. It's unbelievable. Judy

Matthias Miller  29:55
schran is another one that I've just held off in connecting with Alex McCarthy. Did an intro, and I just, it wasn't the time, wasn't right, but she does a ton of work with SAS CEOs. And is SaaS the industry I'm gonna get into? I don't know. But hey, Judy, let's, let's do, let's do kickback like, let's, you know, let's make something happen here? So ripe for just

Speaker 1  30:25
I 100 so 100 proof. You like people. I think people would look at it and be like, this, feels this. Feels like life. Motivational, like, if like, like, it's stuff, it's good stuff, but it's, it's not as as there's so many concepts you could attach to 100 review, second in command, like, just the messaging second, number two or Time command, has, like, those are power words. Like, I think, yeah, it's, it gives you a lot to play with. Like, hey, second in command, it's, it's your time. Yeah, it's your time to not, to not be taking second place. But like, I don't know, there's a lot you could, you could run with disagree.

Matthias Miller  31:40
So how do we compress this down? This feels

Speaker 1  31:43
this okay. I think the national thing, domain, DBA, website,

Matthias Miller  31:56
are we sure that there's no trademark on it?

Speaker 1  32:01
Why would there be a trademark? I don't know. A domain can't be trademarked, no, I

Matthias Miller  32:07
mean, like as a DBA or something that would,

Speaker 1  32:15
oh, the the you're saying the DBA, gotcha not the domain second.

Matthias Miller  32:21
And okay, here, let's do,

Unknown Speaker  32:23
can you share your screen?

Unknown Speaker  32:28
Sorry, wrong way.

Speaker 1  32:37
Well, maybe you, maybe you apply for a DBA, first

Matthias Miller  32:47
work information wings.

Unknown Speaker  32:53
But what's what is it on what industry,

Matthias Miller  33:00
advertising and marketing services provided by means so it's marketing entertainment that's not writing podcasts in the field of business.

Matthias Miller  33:15
Oh, that's something different,

Unknown Speaker  33:18
like Commando. I

Unknown Speaker  33:26
Oh, my goodness,

Unknown Speaker  33:30
that's the offer go going commando,

Matthias Miller  33:34
exactly.

Speaker 1  33:38
But I don't I think you maybe, maybe you need to meet with someone who, oh, that's Cameron Harold. It's pending. It's in

Matthias Miller  33:49
Canada.

Unknown Speaker  33:50
Is that him? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  33:52
that's him. That's his podcast. He has a trademark on the podcast.

Unknown Speaker  34:00
Oh, so you'd have to come up with a different podcast Name.

Unknown Speaker  34:22
I i don't know i

Speaker 1  34:45
Uh, that's fine. That's just a podcast. You just, you just have to figure out this is you. You almost need to leap meet with a a patent market. A trademark attorney, that's that's what I would do.

Speaker 1  35:18
But it's not his business name. Do you see right? What's his business name?

Speaker 1  35:36
What does that mean? I have No idea what that means. I

Matthias Miller  36:00
I got it. There's something that popped out. They couldn't

Unknown Speaker  36:19
they needed more information or some I mean, that's kind of me, yeah.

Speaker 1  36:33
I think maybe before you buy anything, you meet with a trademark attorney. Trademark attorney.

Matthias Miller  36:50
There's other risks too, which

Unknown Speaker  36:58
getting on his bad side,

Matthias Miller  37:01
getting his bad side, he cites a policy and just part of money.

Matthias Miller  37:11
So that would be worst case scenario.

Speaker 1  37:22
Is there, is there any context where you could be an advisor inside his network,

Matthias Miller  37:32
potentially, like,

Speaker 1  37:33
if, if, like, what, if you, I? I became a like. He messaged you right? Yeah, he gave you the thumbs up and like that. He liked the tagline, right?

Matthias Miller  37:56
No, there's, there's another guy.

Unknown Speaker  38:00
So what did He message you on

Matthias Miller  38:03
where I'm at? What about to what are my goals for this year? Typical sales prospecting stuff. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  38:11
he, he initiated

Matthias Miller  38:16
the I, yeah, I sent a connection request, and then he said, glad to know you're loading my content. Oh, Okay,

Speaker 1  38:21
gotcha. Well, I wonder, I wonder if there's a context where you could be, I'm not saying you need to be certified by him or something, but like, imagine, like, imagine Perry had a Perry Marshall Academy certification. You did that, and now you went out and became, you became 8020 advisor. It's like, well, it's not exactly competing with Perry.

Matthias Miller  38:57
Yeah, right, but I imagine

Unknown Speaker  39:00
he's I

Speaker 1  39:27
here's here's, honestly, it feels like

Speaker 1  39:37
there's any number of variations of the same podcast name, right?

Matthias Miller  39:44
Not worried about just, I mean, I'm worried about, you know, podcasts, but,

Speaker 1  39:48
but I'm saying, like, that's, that's what he's filing under, right? You're, you're in a different you're in a different area. So. So meet, meet with, meet with trademark attorney. Ask, maybe ask inside of planetary Hey, does someone

Matthias Miller  40:10
there's a lady here that's been recommended? What? There's a lady in there that's been recommended. Okay, how

Unknown Speaker  40:19
much do you think they charge,

Matthias Miller  40:22
I have no idea.

Speaker 1  40:25
I can also see, like, I would be surprised if, if she answered it for 250 bucks, like,

Unknown Speaker  40:34
just right? I

Unknown Speaker  40:59
By the way, I

Speaker 2  41:00
yeah,

Speaker 1  41:06
I thought second in command was more targeted for the second in commands, looking at the book,

Matthias Miller  41:16
the people who are very important, CEO

Unknown Speaker  41:19
RCS, just is good.

Speaker 1  41:30
Which means they're looking for in some other advisor to, like, translate,

Matthias Miller  41:40
that's where the COO Alliance comes in. Okay, that's on the COO side.

Unknown Speaker  41:46
Gotcha so.

Unknown Speaker  42:18
Moving 60 times we agree.

Speaker 1  42:33
So the the monthly payment plan,

Unknown Speaker  42:40
plus

Unknown Speaker  42:46
comes out to 4100 versus 3700

Speaker 1  42:58
for the second in command. I so it's like, in two years of two years, pay $400 more for for the Rare, for

Matthias Miller  43:11
two years. It's not bad. It's inflationary. I

Speaker 1  43:54
I bet it's all in how you position the service like because you could have the same name

Speaker 1  44:10
in a different industry, but you're but, but He's doing it, and with he's doing it on podcasts, so

Matthias Miller  44:28
I would suspect Yes.

Matthias Miller  44:38
All right, well, I shot an email to this, this gal, and also the message, Stephanie just got a trademark and was working on a trademark in her stuff, see how she did it.

Speaker 1  44:50
Is there is there some hesitation? If so one is, if he sues you, i. Another thing is,

Unknown Speaker  45:08
if people think, Oh, well, he's the second in command guy. So, so, but I don't, but personally, like, does that does that affect? Does that affect SEO? Does that affect some other things, right?

Speaker 1  45:38
So I I mean, but hey, you could, you could buy, you could pay for AdWords, like, like, I don't, you know, and like you're, I think if you say you're the advisor to the second in command, that itself is good positioning, right? Like, I think that's great. Like, so I wouldn't worry too much. I think, I think there's a big enough world for two, two, second in command people. I mean,

Speaker 1  46:34
yeah, because I'm sure many people have never heard of him.

Matthias Miller  46:38
Oh, yeah, I know many people haven't.

Unknown Speaker  46:41
So

Speaker 1  46:46
and and by the way, you could benefit like Tim Francis gets people who ask him, oh, think that he's Tim Ferriss. Okay, so, so you there could be a, you know, there could be people looking for him, but that land on your website.

Matthias Miller  47:14
It's very true. The only issue with buying good domain is defaulting on however much money you put into it. I mean, I'm sure you can cancel, or I would expect, or you can't. Maybe not. I

Unknown Speaker  47:29
bet, I bet you cancel and they just keep it so whatever, whatever you put in I

Matthias Miller  47:44
Right? Yeah, I would think so.

Unknown Speaker  47:49
Honestly, I

Speaker 1  47:56
Is there any reason why you couldn't lease it and start building everything out on second and command, because the trademarking stuff like that could take,

Matthias Miller  48:10
that could take a while. No, there's no reason why. Let's just go do it. You

Unknown Speaker  48:16
don't want to have a conversation first. I

Speaker 2  48:19
don't know, do I just like,

Speaker 1  48:35
it would be patience so it'd be like, a week. Here's, here's Okay, here's the thing. There are things that we could work on now that could fill your time until you leave, right? Well, in

Matthias Miller  48:50
To be frank, if we're not working on this stuff, I can also be doing consulting stuff. Oh yeah, to fill in some time I am still,

Speaker 1  49:03
I know you want to launch, huh? I know you want to launch.

Matthias Miller  49:09
Yeah, exactly,

Speaker 1  49:11
but I think I feel this is going to be like 10 times easier than 100 proof positioning. It just feels it feels you don't have, there's no educate. You don't have to do the education bit

Unknown Speaker  49:34
right behind it.

Matthias Miller  49:39
Well, yeah, anybody who's familiar with the name of has already been educated. They just need to understand how different from him, and even if they don't really understand it, or even if

Speaker 1  49:53
I didn't know his work, and I got it immediately, it was like, right? I.

Speaker 1  50:09
So, so, okay, here's a thought. Well, this is a different direction, but is the messaging going to be for it opens it up. I think this now opens it up. Do you want to be targeting CEOs first?

Speaker 1  50:35
Because what you have on the website is, you know, to the second in command, but man, now maybe it's primarily, is the doorway and the CEO. Ultimately they're, maybe they're the, maybe it's the CEO, because they have the purse strings, right, versus the The the

Unknown Speaker  51:10
COO would be their own paid money. I

Matthias Miller  51:28
operations is the second most difficult person to reach.

Unknown Speaker  51:34
They share your strength, but

Matthias Miller  51:45
so finance is by far, I'm sorry, sales is by far the easiest. You want to talk 8020 here, marketing and executive you

Unknown Speaker  51:55
have a background in marketing. I

Matthias Miller  52:08
but just I mean, looking at this, executives are 60% more likely

Unknown Speaker  52:18
to reply. I

Matthias Miller  52:30
cold emails. Well,

Unknown Speaker  52:31
I think, I think executives Okay.

Speaker 1  52:41
Would an executive think of themselves as second in command? Yeah, they're on the leadership.

Matthias Miller  52:49
I mean, CEO, not as likely. Obviously, they report to the board if there's, you know, if they're not the

Unknown Speaker  52:59
owner and founder.

Unknown Speaker  53:02
But, but I'm just curious, like Cameron targets the CEOs

Matthias Miller  53:11
to Yes, to get the CEO to help the COO right,

Speaker 1  53:22
like if the company is paying, my main thing is, who has a bigger purse string, an individual or company? Like, if the company's paying, it'd probably be the CEO's decision, right? And

Matthias Miller  53:36
if he's pre sold on it, which is how the decision is going to be made. It's him deciding to spend on the COO, right?

Speaker 1  53:57
Honestly, this opens it up more than just corporate, because now it's, it could be, you could hone in on corporate, but it's now, it Could be any, any CEO

Unknown Speaker  54:09
In their second right, I

Speaker 1  54:49
can you? Can you copy this post or do something and put it in the shared.

Unknown Speaker  55:18
Thank you. Applause.

Unknown Speaker  55:23
Uh, oh, maybe that's the easiest thing.

Unknown Speaker  55:28
Yeah, that's okay.

Unknown Speaker  55:33
LinkedIn is weird about that's this stuff I

Matthias Miller  55:42
can do this, and then I can go grab the link, maybe,

Speaker 1  55:56
Oh, grab the top link. Yeah, there we go. I

Unknown Speaker  56:07
All right,

Unknown Speaker  56:11
I, part of me, it's like,

Speaker 1  56:19
I don't I don't think it would hurt to talk to your trademark or the trademark attorney just to clear up the internal speed bumps. Okay,

Matthias Miller  56:35
let's say we ditch, we bypass marketing, and we said, I'm going to go have conversations with people I know, like and trust, and I want to advise. I want to advise your second in command. I want to grow their help, grow their leadership, and grow them as a leader

Speaker 1  56:55
and like you're not. You don't put a price to it until you know what the engagement is, yeah,

Speaker 1  57:11
and you, you have, You have this, you still have sanctuary offerings.

Speaker 2  57:19
But, um, it's

Matthias Miller  57:40
either that or only doing the sanctuary for CEOs in which there's this. I

Unknown Speaker  57:55
don't know if this pulls you too much into the business. I

Speaker 1  58:02
is that I don't know if there's a hesitation of like, well, I don't, I don't want to be, I don't know what you imagine that role to be.

Speaker 1  58:15
But hey, if like, it might replace your current consulting with like, just better clients.

Matthias Miller  58:25
Well, if I could, if I could do my clients, okay, because let me, I'm going to switch. If you're okay with this, I'm going to switch to my phone so that I can go on a walk and we can talk and think and whatever, then just

Speaker 1  58:42
call me. Okay, I'll call you all right, you.
