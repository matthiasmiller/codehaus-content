So one of the things that's really interesting to take a look at is this whole thing of context switching. ie, what happens when you are able to when you don't need a context switch and you're able to actually stay in one place, there's an efficiency gain. So how many different contexts is somebody required to operate it? How many different types of roles are they required? What how many different modalities are they required? If you can reduce those modalities down to the ones in which they're most efficient And certainly if you can eliminate the context switching. You you'll have an immediate gain now. You don't want to reduce context switches into over into a less efficient or less ideal scenario. This is another systems training.
