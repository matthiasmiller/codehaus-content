Unknown Speaker  00:07
Check, check, check, check, check, check,

Unknown Speaker  04:10
hey, can you hear me? Yeah, hey, buddy,

Matthias Miller  04:13
I can hear you. All right.

Speaker 1  04:15
We're looking at something here with the CANS right now,

Speaker 2  04:21
I should see your chance to be out there, raw material, info, sawing, yeah, well, or scroll out a little bit further. Or is it? Would it be under miscellaneous prep,

Speaker 1  04:34
no cans, would be the raw material is what we're proposing. Is a drop down, right? Can you hear us? Matt, yep, I can hear you. Um, if we add the species, all the different species, to all the different sizes, that's going to be quite a drop down. Matt, that's what we're hesitating.

Matthias Miller  04:56
I mean, why wouldn't you have two drop down, just for species in a drop down?

Unknown Speaker  05:00
For raw material? Would you say?

Matthias Miller  05:03
Why wouldn't you have a drop down just for species, one drop down for species and one drop down for raw material?

Speaker 1  05:09
I don't think we would. We're, I'm just, we're just saying that if we do a drop down for species and each different size, it'd be pretty long list. I don't know if that matters. Do you see the list I have there?

Matthias Miller  05:27
You're not sharing your screen. Sorry. I emailed. I emailed. I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Let me share a screen here. I'll do that next. Let's go do

Speaker 1  05:50
it, yeah, I sent an Email there with

Speaker 3  05:59
Yep. The

Matthias Miller  06:07
can't PDF, yep, we

Speaker 2  06:23
so if you make a separate box for species and a separate box for for the lumber mat, would that, would that tie it all together? When you click on both, like you both drop boxes, would that tie both of them together?

Matthias Miller  06:41
Yeah, I would, I would expect we'd set up a way to assign on the to tie out the species, To tie them together, like taking a step back. I

Speaker 2  07:09
Yeah, did you have clean poplar in there too under or you didn't have species in there?

Speaker 1  07:14
Did it? I didn't ask, I didn't add species. I just did, I just did everything that fits into those five categories. Yep, if we, if we did species,

Unknown Speaker  07:37
we'd have,

Speaker 1  07:41
we'd have two by four, SPF, we'd have two by four. Yellow Pine, we'd have two by six. SPF, two by six. We'd have number twos, number threes. It'd be a lot of different lot of different categories, a lot of different categories.

Speaker 2  07:58
Now, lumber season seems to be mixed poplar oak, and then clean poplar for like, running back and things like that. They should have a category that could be anything. I guess we don't have anything there. It can be anything, if you don't specify.

Matthias Miller  08:15
So, so is this? I think there's the way I would draw the line at some level is what is necessary for pricing and what's necessary for the cut list.

Unknown Speaker  08:33
We're using that guy over there, yeah, we.

Speaker 2  08:35
Are you asking me? Are you asking Merv? Yes, my I mean, however you're praying your pricing is you'll meet each can do the way you want. But as far as my capabilities of doing what I've been doing, you know me, it just gives me a variety of things to type in there, if I can. I mean, if I have to add all that extra information in there, if you get one,

Matthias Miller  09:04
yeah, I mean, I can still give you a way to add extra information in if we need that on the I guess that's what I where. What I'm after here is, I don't mind giving you the capability to type that stuff in there, but if, if it affects pricing, then we need, we need a way to be a little bit more defined than that,

Speaker 1  09:28
that well, this is where do we want to go. Then, if it's any of these dimensions, it's can't pricing. If it includes this language, it's cutbacks pricing. If it's RW or random, it's random pricing. And any of these two by four all the way down the pine. If George types that into the box, it's SPF pricing. You. Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  10:05
I mean, we can, we can have, okay, I've got a question for you on the on the SPF pricing, what, how does, if you scroll down. Well, these, these are just different keywords, like, I mean, obviously your, your, your two by four, two by six are going to be priced. No, they're all priced the same per linear foot. Is that? Is that right or different?

Unknown Speaker  10:28
Well, except the Yeah, but the great,

Unknown Speaker  10:33
yeah, right, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:35
right grades. What's going to determine that? Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  10:43
Yeah, that's right, Matt,

Matthias Miller  10:45
I mean, if, if,

Speaker 1  10:52
well, the length, they for linear foot, yes, but the length, we have to use those increments, you know, whatever that right, yep, by the chart that rounded up to the next whatever we can use.

Matthias Miller  11:08
Yeah, understood.

Speaker 1  11:10
So, Matt, if, what if? What if you left miscellaneous prep completely alone and added a drop, added a drop down with these categories and forced us to always an item data, to always choose,

Matthias Miller  11:32
like, well, can't that's, that's the plan. Can't cut backs random, right? Well, you have to So the options are here. Let me pull this up,

Speaker 2  11:46
but you already have your can options in your in your system, yeah, so most popular

Unknown Speaker  11:57
you mean as the price, or how do you mean George?

Unknown Speaker  12:02
Well, no, I'm not,

Speaker 1  12:04
I'm not where you're the one you're saying as most popular. How do you mean like, like

Speaker 2  12:09
your cancer, or your cancer always established in your in your silver limb system, as far as cut less, but as far as

Speaker 1  12:19
pricing, in other words, all the items, all the lumber that comes on an order it, it gets it, the system is generating the right can't size to get that. In other words, it's,

Matthias Miller  12:34
yeah, we know, well, there's a few that that come out of cans that don't have a cant size specified. And so we might need to take a look at that and see how that's being handled. If that, if any of the item data needs to be cleaned up for that. But you're right, if you have a can't, I mean, obviously, if you it's coming up the sizer, and you specify can't size then, well, if it comes up a sizer, you know, it's, it's using, we know exactly what to do.

Speaker 1  13:05
Well. So Matt, can we? Can we, like, leave this? This is a requirement. Like, in other words, as long as this is typed into the miscellaneous prep, we know the pricing, but if not, if, if none of these categories are entered into miscellaneous prep, then there's a thing saying, hey, what's you know, what speed, what material are we using here? In other words, we're trying to specify the material one way or the other, it'd be easier to

Unknown Speaker  13:51
let sleeping with dogs lie, so to speak,

Speaker 2  13:55
but, but you'd be doing double duty, because now you have it in your in your in your size or cut list, and then you're going to braid it out in your miscellaneous prep so you actually write it twice Correct.

Speaker 1  14:13
Well, that's what we talked about too, because in the the ones where it's

Unknown Speaker  14:19
what's going on here.

Speaker 1  14:24
You want? I'm in the wrong here. Roman, zero classification, this one right here? Yeah, I know what you're saying. George. Like, look here, all these items that have the cant size in them already. Like, there's a bunch.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
Mm, so far there were, I thought there was more.

Speaker 1  14:50
Well, that stuff's coming out of cutbacks, that's why, yeah, there's a lot of size. Or can size already there. I. Exactly like all of the I mean, there's 30 678 items here, but a lot of them have the size or can size,

Speaker 2  15:08
but you're saying that size or can size, but you're saying, put it you want to write that pricing and miscellaneous prep, not necessarily.

Speaker 1  15:16
We're trying to ask Matt to make this simple as possible.

Matthias Miller  15:21
Well, the simplest possible thing, okay, there's there's the easy way and the hard way, there's easy way now, and the hard way down the road, the hard way now, and the easy way down the road, the the easy way now is, oh yeah, just put everything in raw material info and go figure out what it is. And, and then at some point we're going to run into issues, and we're gonna have to clean it up and but

Speaker 1  15:42
that's just for but if it's incisors already, man, like this size or can size, isn't that doesn't that,

Matthias Miller  15:51
that that covers it. Where i This doesn't have to be now. But in an ideal world, we would, we would have the place where you could put in this the we would generate the raw material info, sawing, based off of the, based off of the the lumber specification and and species notes. But I don't know that we can, well, we don't actually have quite enough to do that. Do we?

Speaker 1  16:26
You would generate the raw material info for sawing

Unknown Speaker  16:31
based on

Matthias Miller  16:36
we basically give you all the fields you need to put in the I uh, like, we'd have to add another length field on the raw material for non can't

Speaker 3  16:53
raw material. I don't understand that. Do you Okay?

Matthias Miller  16:58
Like, okay, imagine, let's see. Imagine, if we went ahead and put in maybe species doesn't matter on this one, typically, what we do on something like this is in the raw material info for stalling, we put in three and a half by eight by, you know, whatever of I guess, by can't length. And so we could automatically generate the raw material info sawing, for can't for cutbacks. We do, you know, dimensions, times, cutbacks. And we could generate that, that raw material Info automatically for that on a two by six we do well, we've got a few different ways to do it, but etc,

Speaker 1  17:52
you're saying based on

Unknown Speaker  17:56
what let's like.

Matthias Miller  17:59
My point is that we should be able to automatically generate raw material infos, the raw material info based off of the settings that you put in there, right here, and not have to enter it twice, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:19
Well, here we're saying raw materials.

Unknown Speaker  18:26
Did you did you make this list? Man, I did.

Speaker 1  18:30
Why can't I scroll there? Is that everything

Matthias Miller  18:33
that is everything? Okay? I did. Put in the two by 10 that you send over. Is there anything else that's missing?

Unknown Speaker  18:45
Well, the yellow pine,

Unknown Speaker  18:48
okay, and then number twos.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Well, then if, if we do it, that's why I sorry,

Matthias Miller  19:04
is the yellow pine a variant of we have to talk to the tech guy here and explain it. The yellow pine is a variant. Each of the sizes is available in yellow pine, yeah, yes. And is there a grade associated with it, or is it just two by four?

Speaker 2  19:21
You right now we're using one, two and three, four mixed. So there's two different categories.

Speaker 3  19:30
What's one two? What are we using that for? That's actually the two. What's the price on that?

Speaker 2  19:35
That's the one that we're setting on right now here, 685, I think, oh, that's yellow pine. And then the three four mixed is the 385 I thought we're

Unknown Speaker  19:45
sitting on. SPF,

Unknown Speaker  19:50
that's yellow upon.

Unknown Speaker  19:54
I think that is first, yeah, that's first.

Speaker 3  19:56
That's SPF, yeah. But 334, Are. So that's, well, the pine is three, four,

Speaker 1  20:04
the yellow pine. So it's, it's s y p, Matt, S Y, p2, by four, number three, two by six, number three and two by eight. Number three, same as you have, but it's SYP, SYP.

Matthias Miller  20:20
And those are only and then we need number twos for SPF as well. Is that

Speaker 1  20:24
right? But the thing is, you don't, it doesn't,

Matthias Miller  20:29
or we're pricing it as number we'll go ahead.

Speaker 1  20:31
Two By Four. You don't have, if we're going to keep it simple, like if we're just adding the different price points in this drop down, then two by four, two by six and two by eight can go away. You can just say SPF number three, SPF number two, SYP number three and SYP number two. You could do it that way,

Matthias Miller  20:53
and it's the same price. Everybody's still pricing by linear foot. Are you doing?

Speaker 1  20:58
But yeah, but each of these are different price points then.

Matthias Miller  21:02
So then you need different items to tie out different price points. What am I missing?

Speaker 1  21:13
Yeah, well, sorry, different items.

Matthias Miller  21:17
You either need to price it based off of board feet, or you need different list items, two by four, two by six, two by eight. So you can price it by by linear feet, yeah.

Speaker 1  21:29
I mean, we can we price it by board fee,

Unknown Speaker  21:33
the SPF stuff? No,

Matthias Miller  21:39
I'm, I'm, I'm fine with that. If you want to do that, it means you're it means that all the dimensions have to be cleaned up for all your two buys.

Speaker 1  21:52
You're saying we can't use the inch and a half, but three and a half, no.

Matthias Miller  21:56
Well, you need to make sure that you're always using the real we're going to need the real dimensions anyway, and you'll need to make sure that your pricing is based off of that. But yes, we're using, we're using two by four dimensions, sometimes in the inch and a half, three and a half sometimes. And we just got to get get that all cleaned up before our pricing is going to

Unknown Speaker  22:20
be right. But, yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:23
that's I don't, I'm, I'm fine. I

Speaker 1  22:25
mean, yeah, well, thing is, I mean, if you say, price it by linear feet, and it's, that's why you have to have two by four, two by six, two by eight. I get it right. Yeah, so that okay, that's fine. Let's keep it there then. But you're, you're going linear feet that way. We don't have to clean up all the inch and a half, but three and a half and the two by four. Is that why you're doing that? So Right?

Matthias Miller  22:57
I don't care which way we go. That's no we need to, not necessarily. I'm not advocating for that. We're going to want to clean up those two by four dimensions anyway, for this, for sawing yield, presumably, maybe not. Maybe we don't need to.

Speaker 1  23:19
Well, the pricing is based on two by four, two by six, two by eight, or two by 10. That's what we pay for. And then also the raw material is called a two by four, two. But you know what I mean, it's that's what it's called, and that's what it's priced as. So we should have that as the raw material. But when it comes to the actual dimensions, I'm not sure I know, in the past, everything else, all of our other items, we need actual dimensions there. This is a nuance that

Unknown Speaker  23:55
I don't know. What's the best way?

Matthias Miller  24:00
Well, you're not the percentage good.

Speaker 2  24:05
We already went into the system and changed to the inch and a half, three and a half dollar on it.

Matthias Miller  24:10
Well, no, I think it's better to keep it real dimensions, and that's your percentage. Your percentage variance by board feet is not the same, based on a two by four and two by six and two by two by eight. And so my argument would be for accurate pricing. The most internally consistent thing, like for everything to be on the same page, would be to have the lumber be the internal the actual lumber dimensions. And to do have these broken out like this, as as linear feet so that you can,

Speaker 1  24:43
yeah, that's good. So then you'd have to do a again. SPF, same thing, but number two, and then S y p, number two, and S Y P number three. So. Okay, if you buy fours, you price it threes, three, four, next, three. Well,

Speaker 2  25:15
that's what we were talking that's where we remember. We were saying, remember, we were back, what three four months ago was when we were doing two by four method. It was 555 remember, you were saying this phenomenal number is 555,000 that that's for two by four, where, if you do the 225 225,000 that was when we were doing inch and a half, well, we changed to inch and a half by three and a half. Used it, but we're paying for a two by four, not an inch and a half by three and a half.

Unknown Speaker  25:48
It reduced it by 33% right?

Speaker 2  25:53
But that's where, yeah, it gets a little. That's the 555,000 was the concrete. Number, not inch and a half three and a half, because you're paying for a half inch, half inch. That sold

Unknown Speaker  26:08
us that. Yeah, that report.

Unknown Speaker  26:14
That's another layer of nuance that

Speaker 1  26:19
we don't have to walk through that right now. It gave us, it gave us the information we need to know. We take it with a grain of salt. Hey, it's pine it's SPF. It's priced at two by four, so it's anyway,

Unknown Speaker  26:34
worth a look at that

Unknown Speaker  26:38
again when we get back around.

Unknown Speaker  26:42
So, Matt Dewey,

Speaker 1  26:47
did you just create this raw material category? Yeah, okay, so are you okay with? Are you okay with calling it these things based on either raw material info or size or cant size, if at all possible,

Matthias Miller  27:15
as a as a one time thing or long term,

Speaker 1  27:22
um? Man, you got tough question there, buddy, sorry. Well, in other words, rather than us going through each item and telling it, what the what the wrong, what the back here, tell you what the raw material is. You'll, you'll, you'll call it the raw material based on, like the list that I gave you there.

Matthias Miller  27:54
Yeah, if we can, okay, so Well, let's go. Let's go here. Let's see what's missing from this list. Yet, tune it like let's go. Do you want to go back to the report that we have this? Or the the report I sent you? Yeah, the report I sent you,

Matthias Miller  28:17
right here. So what is the good go up to the top. Yep, what's, what's this actually refresh, because I got

Speaker 1  28:31
rid of a few things. Some of these things need. I mean, we would, we could go through this and clean it up. I mean, for sure, okay.

Matthias Miller  28:39
I mean, that's basically what So basically, what it was planning to do was to have a,

Matthias Miller  28:50
oh, I guess here's my proposal. Let's do a one time conversion. And then, yeah, if we think, if we think raw material is one thing and you mark it as something else. We can warn you and say, Look, ah, you like, yeah, you shouldn't

Speaker 1  29:07
clean up. I like that. And then whatever's left over is questionable. George and I come through, and

Matthias Miller  29:16
I've done the one time cleanup based on everything we talked about. Okay, and if you, if you, if any of these are can't, and you create cans and put in the can't dimensions like that automatically will take, will get taken care of.

Speaker 1  29:35
So this plywood needs named whatever it is, right? OSB, BC or CDX, this needs all these things need clarification. Is that right? That is correct. That's is that? And then the no raw material needs clarification. But this has raw material, is all of that? Okay?

Matthias Miller  29:59
Do. Yeah. I mean, if you scroll right, it should, you should see it's getting here.

Speaker 1  30:05
Here's a one by Poplar. Matt, one by six and one by eight. I'm proposing they go into the random category for pricing. Would you say? George, so one by six and one by eight, let's or one by four. Could we could do one by four, one by four, one by six or one by eight, should also fit in the random category

Matthias Miller  30:32
six, one by six, one by four and one by eight. Yup.

Matthias Miller  30:44
One by six, we're actually going to run into another one by six, one sorry, one by four, one by six, one by eight. There we go. Okay, so that gets rid of a if you refresh that gets rid of a bunch. The other issue, though, that I did not think about so

Matthias Miller  31:12
let me go ahead and create those the Yellow Pine variants

Unknown Speaker  31:21
for these doors, we have to specify the plywood.

Speaker 3  31:25
Instead of calling with the same what it what plywood did it, if it's makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  31:34
So we're going to change plywood to CDX,

Unknown Speaker  31:38
either CDX or OSP Miller.

Speaker 2  31:41
They're all, they're all CDX, these

Speaker 3  31:45
guys, yeah, I have to go in the item.

Matthias Miller  31:50
No, you can edit it, right? Raw materials, I think it's editable right there. Okay, you

Unknown Speaker  32:01
okay with that? George,

Speaker 3  32:13
that suit. Yeah, that suits you. What I

Unknown Speaker  32:32
here, what's that? Three quarter by

Speaker 2  32:34
three we're taking out. Well, I mean, we're taking an inch and a half, three and a half, and just ripping, ripping strips.

Speaker 1  32:42
So, two by four. SPF, yeah, is that? What the raw material?

Matthias Miller  32:46
Yeah, okay, so. SPF, how do we distinguish the the two by four species? What? Yp, SYP and pine? Does it

Speaker 1  33:01
um, do we need pine George, or can we say it's either SPF or yellow pine? Because pine fits in the SPF category, it's either SPF or yp, Mac. Let's do that, SPF or YP. The reason that SYP means Southern Yellow Pine, which we can get yellow pine from Canada, right? George, so let's just say SPF, which is Spruce Pine or fir, which is like a huge category of material in the worldwide building industry. SPF, most airing pressure Tree to kill them, drive SPF, except for there's yellow pine, which is, yeah, SPF or YP. That's what we're gonna say.

Matthias Miller  33:51
Okay, sorry, SP SPF or pine or yp is you

Speaker 1  33:58
don't have to do pine. Pine fits in the SPF category, okay,

Matthias Miller  34:09
but SPF and Yp, let's

Unknown Speaker  34:15
see yp or SPF would be the two,

Matthias Miller  34:17
yep, and then SYP is the but

Speaker 1  34:22
I'd say eliminate that s, so it's not as close to the same text. Little easier to see the difference. What's this? HF, George, three, eight, why?

Unknown Speaker  34:35
P is that? What kind of CDX? It's 383, CDX. Do you know what this is? Random? That'd be a random

Speaker 1  34:59
ranpa, eight. Oak said three and a half by eight. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:08
one by six. What? Wait, that's random.

Speaker 1  35:17
I guess I don't have to do capital or but it that's random, yep,

Unknown Speaker  35:26
that's cut backs

Unknown Speaker  35:34
into five, three and a half.

Unknown Speaker  35:36
That's cut back. Should

Speaker 1  35:38
I just put your take? You're cutting the inch of five, three and a half on the saw right, no, or should I just say,

Speaker 2  35:45
see the spec we cut an inch of five, and then we send it through the splitter.

Speaker 1  35:50
Shall I leave this on here? Then just say, into five, 325, cutbacks. Should I do it that way? Just for more clarity, we just have to add That cutbacks to the text

Unknown Speaker  36:05
that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  36:11
Says, bye.

Speaker 2  36:27
Let's go to come out of the camp that's going to come out of a three and a half 816, foot camp. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  36:45
We're now by 816, yeah, 16 foot pot.

Matthias Miller  36:52
Okay, so we do have raw material that is, that is calling it straight up Pine. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  37:05
If it's under, yeah, what are we?

Speaker 1  37:15
So with that, it see? Well, it could be either or we just started using yellow pine more. So George, is it possible some of those, what would it change over to yellow pine?

Unknown Speaker  37:37
Or should we like? I

Speaker 2  37:46
you have to go on and change it and loose those would be International Paper.

Speaker 1  37:52
So that's a tough one, Matt, because, like we talked about this over yesterday. We like most customers are maybe even all like. They don't necessarily care if we use yellow pine or SPF or either one, but they just, I mean, obviously I need the product to do what it needs to do. For us. We're looking at a bunch of different price points, whether it be SPF, whether it be yellow pine, you know, makes a difference where it comes from. Your Canada,

Unknown Speaker  38:41
US, man,

Speaker 1  38:52
so we don't, I mean, do we? Do we? Do we make it the same price point for everything, for pricing sake, and then we save where we can on our end. Or do we? Do we create different prices based on the raw material that We're using?

Unknown Speaker  39:15
Follow that George,

Unknown Speaker  39:21
there's so many variables.

Speaker 1  39:42
Woodson, it? What's the number three, SPF price right now? Do you know what that 385 SPF and yellow? 385, what about SPF? Number two, 685,

Unknown Speaker  39:58
what I have on here in. Huh,

Unknown Speaker  40:02
let me go

Speaker 2  40:03
three fours. What I have in Pine. You get that number two is what I have in spruce. You

Speaker 3  40:36
Hey, Matthew, can you hear me? Yep, here's our pal profile. I don't know if I can Oh, here we go. Shoot.

Matthias Miller  40:52
It's not focusing Matt to back it up just to hear got it? Sort of there it is. Sort of There we go, close enough. Can you read it? Yeah, not quite well.

Speaker 1  41:10
Dog on it, two by four. Two By Four. Southern Yellow Pine is number three. Is 365, two by six. Southern Yellow Pine, number three is 302 by four. SPF is 430 that's also number three. So SPF number three is 430 yellow pine, number three is 365, so 365, or 430 number two, number three, I'm sorry, yellow pine versus SPF. And two by six is for whatever reason or even cheaper I don't understand. Then there's number four prices, which is cheaper still, and these guys aren't even pricing number twos in here, so most of the palette world is not using number two at all.

Speaker 1  42:18
So the two price points that we have to go with or that's it. It's number three. You know, that's really what it comes down number three, SPF or number three, yellow pine. Those are the price points that we want to use for pricing. You and then, if we use a number four, it's going to be cheaper, but we're going to have to work harder on the backside, because there's more junk in there, but to sort it and all that, it's more time consuming.

Speaker 3  43:00
Then number two, we can sell that stuff to shed companies. George, you know that we need to. You might worry about that

Speaker 1  43:12
the number two stuff is kind of like out the window for us, unless we want to use it on crates.

Speaker 2  43:27
We're using some on the stringers, because that number three, four is like this,

Speaker 3  43:33
four stringers, four for the 20s, ouch.

Speaker 2  43:40
Other two unless they can get the height you don't need. Not get messing around with the height. That's where it gets a little screwy. Then you can't get your pallet jack in there.

Unknown Speaker  43:55
So we're using it for all the stringers,

Speaker 2  44:01
just the 20, just the 20s. 20 inch string, you know, the ones we're using, all the number threes. Then the crates were using the number two.

Unknown Speaker  44:10
I thought, Oh, we are.

Unknown Speaker  44:13
Yeah. I

Speaker 1  44:24
we get a number two yellow pine for crates, or

Unknown Speaker  44:29
rather not do that. What's his

Matthias Miller  44:41
name? Hey, do you guys have the three and a half by eight? I.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
What's that?

Unknown Speaker  45:37
About What did you say about three and a half by

Matthias Miller  45:41
eight are this coming out of cancer? Something else

Unknown Speaker  45:45
for that. Host, trans dash two,

Matthias Miller  45:50
like there's a opportunity nine. Wolf, Mike two, no one, brats, one, OD two. Super home two. Sense League Two.

Unknown Speaker  45:58
Or is it on this list? It is now. Shall refresh it?

Matthias Miller  46:06
Yep, if you refresh it, scroll down to the bottom of the top section. Down little bit. Down, down, down down past all the pines, right there.

Unknown Speaker  46:25
Yeah, they're all coming out of three and a half by so we need all them sixteens are.

Matthias Miller  46:34
So we need, can't sizes set up for three and a half by eights.

Unknown Speaker  46:46
That so

Matthias Miller  46:55
we have let's see what maybe, unless I'm missing something, maybe I'm screwing something up here, pinch we're missing some of the multipliers. That's, that's the that's the main thing.

Unknown Speaker  47:10
Where do I look for that? In that

Matthias Miller  47:13
go, in the can't sizes thing, configure, yeah, configure. Can't sizes. Yep. And then go down to the three and a half by eight. And so we're missing, we're just missing the multipliers for the

Matthias Miller  47:37
one by one by 13, one by one or one by 13/16,

Speaker 1  47:41
101, how do I add that new cancel, yep, click,

Matthias Miller  47:45
click in there. No, just click into that. Click into the other one.

Unknown Speaker  47:53
Right here. Yep,

Matthias Miller  47:56
hit plus, yeah, we need one for a one in 1316, to eight by eight.

Matthias Miller  48:12
113 right here, that's three and a half by eight. We need one but we have that one. We need one in 13, sixteenths by eight.

Speaker 1  48:27
Oh, over here. You mean not at the three, yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:35
we don't we sorry, we're not that. That good yet. 1.8125 Yep.

Unknown Speaker  48:44
Oh, sorry.

Unknown Speaker  48:50
And is that one? George,

Matthias Miller  48:53
you want to decimal point in there? Did I do?

Unknown Speaker  48:59
What a guy? There you go.

Unknown Speaker  49:06
One. You getting one out of a three, three or two?

Speaker 2  49:19
Yeah, two, two or not, we just get one. So you need a four by eight if you're gonna get two right,

Matthias Miller  49:28
okay, and then we need a inch and 1/8 by eight. Okay. Do

Unknown Speaker  49:45
inch. That's what. Three you get to three,

Matthias Miller  49:49
yep, and then I need a one by eight.

Matthias Miller  50:00
All right, I think that should, if you hit save, I can double check here that should take care of it. Yep.

Speaker 1  50:14
Well, George so and what do you think we should do then, with this for pricing? Number three, SPF, number three, yellow pine, number two SPF, if we're going to use it on number three, number two pine and number two pine, which we have never eat. We don't have any right now, we don't know what that price would be. I don't I, yeah, we should probably price based on the number. So I think we should, well, I don't know what that is, So Matt, B again, it said number number two, SPF, number three, SPF, number three. SP What did I say? Yeah, number two, number three. Yellow Pine, so it's four categories. Yp, so number two, yp, number three. Yp, I like to reverse it in, in the drop down, but it's fun. Number two. SPF, number three. SPF,

Matthias Miller  51:51
to have it, we could do that so all your number twos would then be together. Number two. SPF, yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  52:08
Wait, what do you say about all your number twos?

Matthias Miller  52:11
So then, then you'd have, like, your number two SPFs would all be together, but you have number two. SPF, number two. Yp, yeah, number three. SPF, yeah, we can do that. But if,

Unknown Speaker  52:28
man, it's tough. Did you you're

Speaker 1  52:36
gonna have to look that item by item. George, right. I mean, we're gonna, don't you know what I'm just saying the all the pine ones for us to get a good look at pricing where it's at right now. Do we want to base it on number two price, number three. Price.

Matthias Miller  53:13
Is there a rule of thumb, if we would, sorry, you're asking George good,

Speaker 2  53:17
and you put that where on like if you do that 20 about 48 Romy International Paper, yeah,

Speaker 3  53:29
so what? How do you what's your code? Your home page, like items? Your Home Page? I

Unknown Speaker  53:44
Good items. I forget what the 20 Remy International,

Unknown Speaker  53:53
R, W, I t1, 020,

Unknown Speaker  53:56
or something like that, 1020, I think

Unknown Speaker  54:00
20 by 48 Yeah.

Speaker 2  54:03
Now you said about pricing. Where would you put SYP or SPF for your pricing information? In that drop down box? Where's that box?

Matthias Miller  54:17
Matthias, if you, if you go down on a per lumber basis, so right there?

Speaker 2  54:25
Yeah, so that has to be number three SYP, but that's where you're going to change it for your pricing thing is what you're saying, right?

Speaker 1  54:40
Well, yes, like, there's two things happening. The first thing is, Matt's trying to take the data that we already have and just read off of that and call it that, like, if, if we're saying we're using yellow pond, and Matt's going to try to. In the raw material based on the data, he's going to say, Oh, we're using yellow pine. That's the one thing we have to accomplish is get tolerating what what we're using. The second thing we have to accomplish is deciding what should it be. Because this is that's a whole different problem of you know, where we're using number two SPF at 685, if we can, we have to use number three yellow pine, because it's a way better price, and that's how we're going to be profitable. So there's two different things going on here at the same same time.

Speaker 2  55:48
But if we're using number three SYP for that, this one we're using, that's gotta be changed, number three SYP, and then it's done. And then the stranger is another story. I mean, you don't mean if I can hold that three and a half inch tolerance, yeah, it's nice to use the number three, yeah, at 385, but if it's not, it's,

Speaker 1  56:12
well, I thought those guys were sorting out the odd ones and then just using those for

Speaker 2  56:18
that's what we're trying to do. Depending on what you mean, how the bundles are. I mean, how the bundles are running

Unknown Speaker  56:28
reserves. So then is there, if we

Speaker 2  56:30
get behind in production, the only that's the thing. I mean, we gotta get it done too. We got three weeks to do an order for next. I mean, we got one for Monday yet, but that's what we run into. So sorting and messing and doing all that. But yeah, we, I mean, if they run three and a half, we can do us number three SYP for for the 20 inch till this just a 48

Speaker 1  57:01
oh, that's, I mean, but that's the that's going to be that's kind of the cost of making money or not, is dealing with the variation that number three brings with it, right? That's, yeah, but it takes a lot of time to do that too well. Then a lot of times you don't have, from a management standpoint, do we, do we want to just let the guys use number two and then eat, eat the cost? I'm not saying that. Well, I know, but I'm saying, how do we approach it from a management standpoint, do we want to, I mean, do make other adjustments and try to stick with the number three yellow pine. You know, mean, like, I know there's a I know there's a cost to it. It costs you more time. It's more management, or whatever. It's all this,

Speaker 2  58:01
we can. We'll just say, let me just do number three, live with it and try and get through with it.

Matthias Miller  58:08
Well, we could we, is there a way we can quantify, like, could we run the numbers? How much additional labor is it, if it's a capacity issue, do we need to scale up, or do you need to get I mean, okay, I'm again, I'm sticking my nose maybe where it doesn't belong. But, like, how much time does it add? What's the comparison of the time that it actually adds in terms of of labor to versus material cost?

Speaker 2  58:35
Yeah, it ain't always the same, because some loads might be different than others. That's where it gets a little you know, I mean, some loads are better than others.

Matthias Miller  58:46
Can we get a worst case scenario and a best case scenario? And in use

Speaker 2  58:52
that, we get all our information in from our right, our selling audit, or whatever. That's where that information going to come.

Speaker 1  59:04
Can we look at some? Do we have enough of that, George, that we can possibly look at what? What's in there,

Unknown Speaker  59:13
the audits in there, but some of the, some of the time sheets not in there yet?

Speaker 2  59:24
Get all the audit and done getting caught up with the timesheets.

Speaker 1  59:39
So is George. Would you say it's, it's just time is the biggest difference time in the Saw Shop, that's the only thing the price is, I mean all that

Speaker 2  59:57
and making sure the strainers. I mean three and a half. These guys. I mean, I can see a negative eye three and a quarter inch strainer. It goes for 48 but some of these guys can't come in. They're not going to see it well.

Speaker 1  1:00:11
Is that? Do we have guys that can see it? Or is that a training thing or firing, unless

Speaker 2  1:00:19
you want to pay attention to it. I mean, you should be able to see a three and a quarter inch, two or four compared to a three and a half picks out like a sore thumb. But then it's like something's three and a quarter. Something three and three eighths. I'm three and 7/16 try and go with three and three eighths or higher. Still, can get away with it.

Speaker 1  1:00:42
How many? How many runners it take to do

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
an order of this.

Speaker 2  1:00:49
We have them over now, I don't know what's on that production sheet, 1020, or 1024

Speaker 1  1:00:55
or something, 1000, 20,020, I think 10 times three. So 3060 you get seven out of a 12 footer. Is that right? Divided by seven? Because 437 12 footers in there four feet. So 437 times two times four, that's the

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
board feet right, 3496 times 6534 96 times, 68 five. So that's 2395

Speaker 1  1:01:42
and if we go 3496 times 385, it's 1346, so that's it's like 1000 $1,050 cheaper to make it out of the number threes. And if you talk about labor in a soil shop, you know what? I mean? It's 1050 to try. I don't know, 20 our cost. I mean, you could afford 37 hours before you eat up the difference. I mean, some of that is the some of that margin is hopefully some profit and an allowance to cover costs for office and overhead and forklifts and all that.

Speaker 1  1:02:50
I guess what we're talking I mean, Where's, where's the point where it's too much labor. Understand if you're if you're up against and you know, guys are probably they get frustrated or whatever about it, I don't know. I'm not sure what that.

Speaker 2  1:03:11
Let's do with this number three SYP. Just work through it.

Speaker 1  1:03:20
I mean, the story. If we but if we go with number two, we know we're losing money on the job because they're 760 lumber and the 844 is the pallet price. We haven't worked on that side. That's another that's another battle that needs to be thought at some point here.

Speaker 2  1:03:46
But um, so anything with pond, I gotta go in and change that little material well, because right now, do you have everything under number three? SPF, Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:04:05
I had and then I threw it back because, well, that's not what it is or,

Matthias Miller  1:04:19
I mean, it's not specified well, but we could, I mean, we could throw it in there and go back. I mean, the other thing too is, if there's a rule of thumb, that's right, 80% of the time, Blake crates use number two, and pallets use number three. We could use something like that. Or we can go through and clean it up and

Speaker 1  1:04:46
well, so George, we've, we've never used, have we ever used yellow pond for crates? So then, can we do that like Matt? I guess I'm saying. And crates to a number two. Allow number two for crates. Price crates accordingly, number two is way nicer to work with. Well, I say number two SPF is much nicer to work with than yellow pine, because crates your, I mean, you got corners and flush and all the things you're trying to nail together, you're, you know, you don't want it to yellow pine split. So I hate to see a crate that's all nails are splitting the corner posts and the this and that it just sloppy. I think we could, don't you think we can afford George, use number two SPF for crates. It helps the guys on assembly and pallets stay with the pricing. The pricing is minimal because we're not doing mass we're not mass producing crates with two by fours. What's the biggest orders we do of crates with two of fours?

Speaker 2  1:06:02
Biggest one right now is wave that wave 80 inch crate,

Speaker 1  1:06:06
which is, we don't do what? How many of those do we know?

Speaker 2  1:06:09
For a while we were doing it twice a week. I mean, there a big quantity. There's either 12 or 24 it's not like, it's yeah, it's not like it that's

Speaker 1  1:06:21
so there. So to that point, if the price so crates will then sub Matt, does that jive with what you said?

Matthias Miller  1:06:32
Or Okay, so let's let me here. Let me get I didn't put the number two SPS in here yet. Rates will be numbered, okay, crates would be if it's a crate, and hang on, okay, then any, even if it's marked as pine, we'll still pick it up for crates. We'll just treat it as number two. SPF, I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21
was waiting to see what he did.

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
I mean is that? Is that what you guys

Unknown Speaker  1:07:36
are thinking,

Matthias Miller  1:07:38
basically, if, if, okay for crates. I mean, can we just ignore the SPF yellow pine? I don't know if we have any, but just ignore the SPF yellow pine designation. And also, if it has the word pine in it, then we, then we would treat it as

Speaker 2  1:08:01
you're saying same as I just do the grade, either so two or a three is that what you're thinking? I guess

Matthias Miller  1:08:10
that's what I'm trying to figure out.

Speaker 2  1:08:14
The only problem with that is spruce is more tend to be more expensive than the yellow pine. That's where it might cause a little bit of a spruce is always more expensive than the pine.

Matthias Miller  1:08:33
So would you want to do it as number two?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:37
Yeah. Sorry, do what is number two? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:08:40
okay, for crates? Yes,

Speaker 1  1:08:43
that could be, that could be a number two SPF. We could use number three SPF as well, but number two and then we have a bunch of it here. If we can price our crates accordingly, then we're pretty good shape. And,

Matthias Miller  1:09:12
okay, so crate should always be using, should be priced with number two,

Speaker 1  1:09:16
number two. SPF, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
Here. Let's go. Do we

Speaker 1  1:09:24
have crate as an indicator on Item data? Yep. Okay, perfect.

Matthias Miller  1:09:32
So then here number 2s, P, F, all right. So crates, we double check this pine or if it's specifically SPF or yp here, if it's SPF, everything else would go into number three, SPF or yellow pine SPF, if we can tell the difference.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:51
All right. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:09:57
that could that took care of a good. Number.

Speaker 1  1:10:00
Where's that wave crate? Jordan, what size is that one you're talking about?

Speaker 2  1:10:04
It's real. I say it's an 80 inch crate, but it's, it's like a 78 by

Unknown Speaker  1:10:15
new Mozambique create, not in the item which there?

Speaker 2  1:10:23
7620, there you go. That one. Yeah, that's the inside dimensions. The 80 inches, the outside dimension. So here,

Speaker 1  1:10:32
where are we calling it? A crate mat, in here, up there. Category, yes. Thank you. All right, hey, we did some work in the past,

Matthias Miller  1:10:42
work in the past. We're okay. So that takes that, takes your your pine list down like crazy, like we're down to 133 I know that that's a lot, but

Speaker 1  1:10:54
no, but that's fine. That helps a bunch. Do we see that on this list?

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
Or if you refresh, see what we got,

Speaker 1  1:11:05
I go to the top, unmapped, so these guys. So now we need to specify.

Matthias Miller  1:11:16
I mean, are you always sorry, Matt? Go ahead, for Remy. Can we? Are you always using the same thing?

Speaker 1  1:11:25
Wish, good. Yeah, we should use number three, yellow pine for all those Remy stuff, if it's

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
I mean, these are all flagged as

Unknown Speaker  1:11:45
just fine George

Unknown Speaker  1:11:50
swine Hill, they think they did that one time.

Speaker 1  1:11:55
Wait shipping part that's not even a pallet, is it? Yeah, it's just a pump for wood Miller together. Yeah, that can be yellow pine. So everything on, I mean, George, tell me if, if I'm wrong here. But what about this. Remy, all these are International Paper.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:24
Remy, Penn Stamos, that shouldn't be. That's the ones where we went back to the

Speaker 1  1:12:35
we went away from that. Oh yeah, that should be number three, for sure.

Speaker 2  1:12:39
Oh no. We don't even do that. We went back to Poplar. That ain't even in there anymore

Unknown Speaker  1:12:45
on the sixteens,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:47
sixteens and the twelves. Oh, see the twelves on there depends stainless so you use

Speaker 1  1:12:56
an inch and seven. Yeah, it's Poplar. What would you rather use there? Would you rather use inch and seven or, like, use it for, like, number three cutbacks?

Speaker 2  1:13:06
Well, see, I don't know. I get one to three or, I don't know if you can get number 316 footers. I gotta find that out.

Speaker 1  1:13:14
Wait, oh, these are 16 foot. I thought they're 16 inch. I'm 16 foot. Well, some of that's Mark 144, that's not that looks like inches.

Matthias Miller  1:13:28
It is. It's put in as inches.

Speaker 2  1:13:31
Can we change that? Right? That is now, that is the top, that is the top of the power that is inch. That is inches. Right? 60 an inch. And what are you talking about? 190 twos and a 70 twos. What we want? That used to be pine, and we went back to Poplar

Unknown Speaker  1:13:49
on that. Did you put this in your number three? SPF,

Matthias Miller  1:13:52
no, that's that was. It was miscategorized early this morning. I mean, it's not updated. I guess I could update them, but

Speaker 1  1:14:00
those are six teams. Then Jordan, what do you do you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:14:03
use there? We can use a number three, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:14:08
okay, cutbacks and that will that'll use them up. And then so all this other stuff might be somewhere. And so then we have this, NH,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:32
you were buying inch and a half by eight popper for that, weren't you?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:37
That's, yeah, that's inch and a half by eight, by

Speaker 1  1:14:40
eight that can't or is that a special price? That's a

Speaker 2  1:14:44
special one of Ken always got inch and a half by eight foot pop, and then we cut them down to 32 and 12.

Speaker 1  1:14:51
So that's a separate that's a different price point, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57
Yeah, it should be. I. Do we do a lot of that,

Speaker 2  1:15:02
or just the IDMs for me? Oh, and I think I got four or five next week, but it's hit and miss here and there. It's not like it's every week

Unknown Speaker  1:15:12
that's for IDMs, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:15:16
Platform, you nail a 3012 inch on the end of the 32 that's like a platform. They both go together.

Speaker 1  1:15:32
Can you use a two by four? I mean a two by eight

Unknown Speaker  1:15:35
instead of

Unknown Speaker  1:15:38
or what do you that's going to be more expensive? Use a two eight.

Speaker 1  1:15:43
Okay, then poplar, yeah, put the inch bites to special order.

Speaker 2  1:15:48
Yeah, we get done from ashes or white oak or a bundle eight foot or less.

Speaker 1  1:15:55
Oh, okay, okay, so we keep some in stock. Oh, so that's it, but it's a more expensive than a regular can.

Speaker 2  1:16:05
I don't know what they're paying for. I don't know what triple and some A while back, we actually stripped them because it went dead in the water for a while. So we stripped them to get air through them. So they were sitting there starting to turn you

Speaker 1  1:16:23
chip you copy, hey, Murph, Hey, good morning, sir. Hey. What's the price when you buy the inch and a half by eight poplar from LIKE ASHES or somebody, are you paying more than normal camp price for those? As far as I know. Thank you, sir. So that's another can't category.

Matthias Miller  1:16:54
So can I go ahead and put all the remys under number three yellow pines? That would you said?

Speaker 1  1:17:01
Can we can't we George is Remy pen and the internationals and the have and the Thor

Speaker 2  1:17:12
is that, oh yes, that I just gotta make sure I can get sixteens and 10s and stuff from in the SYP, because right now I'm either getting like 10s from paneling sales, because I don't use that many 10s two before 10s And sixteens and fourteens I was getting at

Speaker 2  1:17:41
moments I elements. Got a bundle of sixteens and a bundle of fourteens, and that lasts me forever.

Speaker 3  1:17:49
I don't know that often in that in yellow, in what that's in SPF. In SPF, you mean for pen

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
or I'm sorry if I'm no

Speaker 2  1:18:03
anything that I can't get out of the two before 12, number three, that's anything I have a number three right now is two before 12. So I'm saying, if we change all these to, yeah, the Penn stainless and the International Paper to know, all the number threes, but some of the sizes you gotta use fourteens or, you know me, because you got a lot of weights out of the back. And if you some stuff, you use 16 some stuff, you use fourteens, like 50 sixes, stuff like that. And then the 10s is mostly for your 40s, because you want to cut 40s out of 12 Foot. Yeah. I just gotta see if I can get number 334, mix and sixteens and fourteens, 10s. If we're going to change it to that,

Speaker 1  1:18:48
well, we, as far as lumber quality and all that, we should, it's the same. I mean, yeah, we're gonna, gonna be a lot, I mean, hopefully make us more profitable, or whatever. Yeah, two before 992

Speaker 2  1:19:11
in the 70 twos, the 190 twos, all that's popular now that ain't that shouldn't even be in there from 990-211-7992 1179, 1179 them set two sets of 70 twos and two sets of 190 twos. Shouldn't even be in there. That should be inch and seven. So that's this guy right here. I don't know why it's showing up that. Oh, that's a 24 inch. We haven't did that for a long time. Okay, sixteens and the twelves are the most popular. So it's probably why that didn't change. But I gotta change that back to inch and seven, okay? 24 stay that way, but 190 twos and the 70 twos gotta be changed back to Where's. Or, you mean in this one, yeah, the 992 both them. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:08
what these are inch and seven.

Speaker 2  1:20:13
Now it's the 190 twos. I mean a two or 424, stay the way they are. But the 190 twos that category two, inch and seven.

Speaker 3  1:20:22
Where's my size, thickness? How do you do inch and seven here? Yeah, one point the 43753752,

Speaker 3  1:20:43
that's raw material. Bring it up by eight. Is that right? Yeah?

Speaker 3  1:20:59
Popper, yes. I wait, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:13
then 70 twos, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:40
it did I miss. Want this guy here at 1170, same thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:00
Yeah, all I'm communicating back to inches seven

Speaker 1  1:22:05
is that working the inch is seven like or do, what did you rather use? Because the, well, no, wait a minute, the pine price is about the same, isn't it? It is because you got two times four times 72 divided by 44 four board feet,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
Six, five.

Speaker 1  1:22:35
It's four board feet as a as number. Four feet, so two by fours, 2.8 board feet, chance 2.8 times. What's our camp price right now? 5050, yeah, what were repricing at 50,000 $50

Speaker 3  1:23:10
to be $2 well, it's more than that, but that's 145,

Speaker 1  1:23:19
four times. Splits are twice home, 351, yellow pine, so we all find still more expensive.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:34
So that poplar is better. That's crazy. Mm,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:43
the air small we made inch and a half. Oh, yeah, you did, which is, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:24:05
Um, see now, go click on that 192, again, up top.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:09
Okay, can I finish this one proof?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:18
Inch, and it's 1.4375 point, 4375,

Speaker 3  1:24:26
now, what's that? George, no, go out. Scroll out further on the No. 92 Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:24:34
So you gotta have to put your brewer, see, you gotta get rid of all that other stuff, yeah, put your own material in and sizer and

Unknown Speaker  1:24:52
I pick, to pick cancer. Matt.

Matthias Miller  1:25:00
With, yeah, I mean, you can. You don't need to. I'll go back and clean it up once we're

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
through, eliminate not to get notched.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:16
Now you got a bubble.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:18
Oh, that's why it's one notcher to get bubbles. So is that right?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:30
Why is that on? Can tech? Because you're

Speaker 2  1:25:35
cutting two by fours. Yeah, we're cutting two before so you get rid of that. I

Unknown Speaker  1:25:49
you get beveled too.

Speaker 2  1:25:53
Yeah, one end, but I gotta struggle in there and clean it up, because you're gonna have split that up because you're only bevel and two out of the four. So you got a two, two, you gotta do two at bevel and two, yeah, not bevel. Same way with 190 twos. You do two gets bevel, one end and two that don't so you gotta, you have four line items there. Instead of two, they won't show up?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:26
What are you saying about four line items on here?

Speaker 2  1:26:31
Yeah, bubble one end so, but you have four there, but you got two of them doing two of them don't. So you got to make a line item. You have to do the 192 twice. You gotta do the 72 twice, and then paying that to two, right, right, two and two, gotcha, and then do another two.

Speaker 4  1:26:54
What did you want? Yesterday? He didn't, you told me, but you didn't come back. He just called again. He said he'll be in two hours. Put up the van boxes.

Speaker 2  1:27:01
They're still down there. That's why that's going to ask. And I don't think you heard me yesterday, he's going to be down here Christmas Day, and we had them sitting there since the 24th Okay, evening before we left, okay, at three o'clock, and he was going to come Christmas Day and pick them. Why Christmas Day? I don't know, but I think they're still down there. Well, that's fine, as long as they're ready. I just want to make sure, my reader, can you call Levi and just tell him to make sure there's a bandsaw blades are still down there, because Chris didn't pick him up yet, okay, but I seen him yesterday when I was helping chip flip lumber away. So I think you're still there. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:49
That should be done, right? 2222,

Speaker 2  1:27:53
now is it when you scroll out there to miscellaneous, there's nothing out there as far as that one and all that crap,

Speaker 1  1:28:05
now you're good raw material. Info is sewing. Does that need to be there?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:16
Not in sawing?

Matthias Miller  1:28:18
What's that? Matt? No, not from my standpoint, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:22
So I'll do the right. Can go away now.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:36
All right. Well, I don't know if I that was just the one, George,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
Matt, I don't want to waste your time.

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
Um, well, I mean So if, I mean if the rest of the of the remys are, I mean if the remms that are there now, I mean that should have cleared those out of that list. And if the rest are good, I can, at least for the one time thing go flag all the remms as the whatever I said.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
That's why. P number three, George, what's this?

Speaker 1  1:29:15
This Remy Thor, two by four by four.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:20
Who's that guy backwards? Yeah, four inch,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:32
yeah. What? Inch and a half?

Speaker 2  1:29:40
That's a screwy, annoying thing. Tiny, little block. Yeah, it sets underneath. It sits underneath the two by six. I think there's a two eight or two by six that it sets on its legs for that the one edge sets back on a sump the platform, and then it comes out. And there's two little blocks of just supports for not

Speaker 1  1:30:03
so the actual dimension is inch and a half.

Speaker 2  1:30:06
But inch and three quarter, you have to start out with a two by four, four, and then rip that in half on

Speaker 1  1:30:15
Yeah, but wouldn't that be the raw material, like the actual dimensions is inch and a half by inch and three. If you

Speaker 2  1:30:26
do that, then it's going to shut off. Feel me, it's an inch and a half an inch and a half four. And we don't have feel mean. We don't have inch and a half, inch and a half four. You gotta start out with your two Buffalo and endure,

Speaker 1  1:30:40
yeah, but that's what you want to make the product, right inch and a half, inch and a half, or into three quarter, a four, yeah. Isn't that what we want as these dimensions right here? I mean, typically we put in the

Speaker 3  1:31:02
this, the actual size for here. And then, unless I'm thinking, you're all on this one,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:14
oh, you put inch and a half inch and a half four there. Try it once you

Unknown Speaker  1:31:25
Can I do one and three quarter? Is it?

Speaker 2  1:31:28
I gotta do one inch and a half inch? It's inch and a half inch and a half in it?

Speaker 1  1:31:32
Well, if you're ripping it in half, it's gonna leave inch and 13/16 or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:41
Can makes, make sense curve would be an 81254,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:01
raw material is

Unknown Speaker  1:32:09
this a crate or a pal? This is a crate.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:14
Well, that's a palette

Speaker 1  1:32:16
to use SPF for this. For this particular one, because it's softer.

Matthias Miller  1:32:25
Do you want to? It'd be better at this point, until we get everything switched over. Be easier for me if you don't fill in raw material and just put SPF or yp into the raw material. Otherwise I'm gonna, I'm not gonna be able to keep track of what's okay. It's been manually done and what's not fine, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:51
raw materials two before.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:04
And tech to rip you

Speaker 1  1:33:28
shot all the remmys. What did you say about all the remmys? Matt, you're gonna take all the Remy and do make them number three.

Matthias Miller  1:33:42
Number three. Yp, is

Unknown Speaker  1:33:45
yp, sorry, is that? Google? What's that? Okay, number three, yellow pine.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:53
And then there'll be a few left.

Matthias Miller  1:33:57
Yeah, give me a minute, and then you can see exactly which one they're going to be Number

Matthias Miller  1:34:06
three, let's see.

Matthias Miller  1:34:21
All right, if you reach fresh, then that takes it. That just takes it anyway. I think this is, this is close enough that, I mean, for all these, all these that you have at the top, if you just want to put in, unless you know right off the bat whether you want with what you want them as it's

Matthias Miller  1:34:46
you can just put in, put the indicator,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:51
yeah, all in two days are going to be a number two. You.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:02
Ah, all these guys. So number two, SPF, two by eight.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:09
All the two by eights.

Speaker 1  1:35:18
That number we call it number two, SPF, or SPF, number Two, number two, SPF.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:38
Little Sam,

Speaker 3  1:35:59
about that fab roll did

Speaker 2  1:36:04
that for a long time. Miller, I think I was one power that Rick come back as a print we haven't did it since.

Speaker 3  1:36:12
We just got two way. SPF, yeah, you get rid of pound on sales. So I'm gonna leave it on there reference. It's not covered. Should I get rid of it? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:36:30
Two way, 12. Fa, so, SPF, I will

Unknown Speaker  1:36:40
not put that in there, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:46
You want number two on that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:50
yeah, we're gonna do it again, maybe.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:57
Right? Yeah. ATI, engine seven top,

Speaker 2  1:37:15
just seven inches. HT, it's ht, so we use seven inch.

Speaker 1  1:37:27
Is it inch and seven by three and a half by seven inch out of two before

Speaker 2  1:37:32
that could be a number three? Yp, I

Speaker 2  1:37:50
river lumber right there. We're going into a 16, 348, now, so I don't know why that's even in there. That could probably be deleted. Well, I don't remember. Don't have

Speaker 1  1:38:03
any inch and a half, three and a half, 48 pine, we're doing

Unknown Speaker  1:38:06
inch and a 16th, three and a half, 48 I haven't did that for a long time

Unknown Speaker  1:38:14
to get rid of this.

Speaker 2  1:38:20
Well, we have it in a 16th in there, slum, something. I want to say it's one eight bird long. It's already in there. But this one here, this one can go away,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:34
delete the item, or what can

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
you want to you're saying it's in as a Can we go back here?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:55
Oh, it's in there twice.

Speaker 2  1:38:59
One's an inch and a 16, 348, that's a tool I use. Berg Lum, 1.3 and Berg lum seven. I don't do that pine anymore.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:10
The eights going, is that right? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:39:20
the inch and a half, the inch and seven, three and a half, 48 I leave that one there, that one, yeah, leave out on there.

Speaker 1  1:39:27
And that needs to be inch and seven, poplar, or what

Unknown Speaker  1:39:31
I think it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:35
It's not even, Oh, what did I do here?

Matthias Miller  1:39:46
So we've never gotten an order for the one with the dash eight in it, in the system, but we have never got an

Unknown Speaker  1:39:54
order we can get rid of that one.

Matthias Miller  1:39:57
Okay, what I would. Do George, instead of full on deleting it, click the one. Okay. Which one do you want to keep the inch and seven that one?

Speaker 2  1:40:13
Well, if we never did anything with with the dash, I would say, get rid of that one and maybe keep the pine

Unknown Speaker  1:40:19
one for now. Yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:40:21
all right, so I would, I guess we should, yeah, you should be fine to delete now, but go up to advanced and the little icon on the top right, that's right, no, stay there. Go back, yeah, go top right that little advanced menu, delete this item, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:40:58
go back. Or, yeah, spec a little more, whatever.

Speaker 3  1:41:02
Back to the items. Where were we? Oh, this was items here. Okay, so here, Berg, Long Bay. That's what should that be. Number three, nope. 12 Foot.

Matthias Miller  1:41:22
Can I, George, can I, MERV, can I leave you guys to it? I think you guys have what you need. And I'll come back and take a look at what you've done. Yeah, on top here, and the rest of the raw material stuff.

Speaker 2  1:41:34
Yeah, so when we save this now, Matt, that ones that we just did there, they'll go away. Yeah, all right.

Speaker 1  1:41:44
So, Matt, so the no raw material items, we need something, correct? Am I right?

Matthias Miller  1:41:54
We need a yeah, all of those needs, something, these needs

Unknown Speaker  1:41:58
specified. So there's a

Unknown Speaker  1:42:04
there's 13.

Matthias Miller  1:42:09
I mean, some of them, I mean, yeah, I don't know what to say, besides just one by one going through here

Unknown Speaker  1:42:19
nine, so that was like 46 there.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:23
Then he specified, okay, all right.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:35
Followed three are all random,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:39
yep, yep, yep. To go into

Matthias Miller  1:42:45
the put in, just put in random into the raw material there, and that's all you need to do

Unknown Speaker  1:42:50
over here. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:06
and get that one. George, anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:43:08
that last one says plywood. Is it still random?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:12
Three quarter by 51, by 40?

Speaker 2  1:43:16
Oh, maybe not. So it is probably CDX.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:19
Three quarter. CDX. Do you put inch down every time? Or just

Speaker 1  1:43:31
All right, okay. Matt, so what should finish? We'll finish these that helps you correct, yep. What about the bottom then are we? Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
I don't know if we want to any way to double check that we're automatically assigning things right. It's not guaranteed that it's 100% accurate, because we are kind of trying to guess from guess intelligently based on what's in there. So do you need something to help you review that or not?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:06
Well, the only thing

Unknown Speaker  1:44:13
I mean, if it doesn't specify the things that we

Unknown Speaker  1:44:18
talked about,

Speaker 2  1:44:20
let me kind of jump in, like all those ARSP match sometimes, sometimes you only want one, and then sometimes they'll throw 50 or 60 at me, so which means I gotta go in and change it to keep like, if it's one, I'm just going to do it at eight and five, three and a half cutbacks, if it's 60 or 50, I gotta transfer that to the Keystone, because that's where the four way notcher is for bigger quantities. So now, if we put what am I trying to say? I. So I got two different variables there. If it's a big quantity, I gotta switch it to Keystone. And if it's just a small quantity, I keep it as cutbacks and go to the single head notcher. Is that going to mess it up if we do give it like a category by keeping an inch of five, three and a half cutbacks, or do I gotta physically go in and change it to Keystone and get rid of that inch of five, three and a half cutbacks? That's what I've been doing.

Matthias Miller  1:45:32
Well, it's, it doesn't matter. I mean, the the main reason, the biggest reason that, as it stands now for this, is to sorry, is is for pricing. But if you're commonly switching between variations, then it's possible that we should start considering, like, if you're frequently jumping back and forth and saying, I mean, we should, we should maybe consider either separate item codes or having some accounting, accounting for variations in some capacity, just so you're not if it makes a big difference to you, switching Back and forth.

Speaker 2  1:46:21
That's what's happening right now with scalpy Hollow. They told me they were going to be shut down for like, four weeks, starting the end of last week in November, and they're still shut down. So anything that's in the category of scout the hollow, I'm switching and flipping that to either the Keystone or the brewer, and then I gotta come up with a configuration of, you'll mean the cans. I gotta start fresh with that, because it doesn't transfer cans to scalpy. But if I go to brewer in Keystone, then I have to fill all that in. So that's what's that's why I was asking. But here is the ARSP is, like I said, if it's a bigger quantity, I'm going to throw it to the Keystone and notch them in line, rather than cutting them out of cutbacks, and then throw them to the single head notcher.

Matthias Miller  1:47:13
So what I would, I mean, the probably the best solution for that is we should let you, maybe we should start letting you specify can't can'ts for scalpy, so that you've got the information and then just not put it on the cut list. When we generate the cut list for scalpy, not print it out, right? I would expect it'd be useful for us for other reasons as well, if we did that. All right, what do you what do you think of that?

Speaker 2  1:47:54
So I if I change it to like, if I change a or SP to Keystone, you're saying, What do I have to do then?

Matthias Miller  1:48:02
Well, we you'd set up the item data, even if it's if it's even if the item data is set up for scalpy, we'd still put in the canned information. And just when we go to print for scalpy, we wouldn't, I'd have to get my head back in the game a little bit about what the differences specifically are and the generated cut list, but, but, sorry, let me take it from the top on the item data. You would set up all the canned information, whether it's for scalp you or Keystone or Brewer, doesn't matter, you'd set up the canned information. And then the only different, and we push that all the way across, the only difference is when it actually goes to generating the cut list for scalpy. We'd the printouts a little different, because we don't need all that information for them, but that would then let you in the cut list. You could easily move it from scalpy to Keystone or other way or any direction, and it it should just work,

Speaker 2  1:48:58
and all that information will be in there, then, is what you're saying? Yeah, let's, I would say that's, I'm fine right now with it. I would Okay, let's not change it. All right. That's not right. And that way, it's just variables. You can see it still in pricing. It'll still be there because it'll be Keystone and Brewer instead of scalpy Hollow. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:49:33
okay. I mean, MERV, I'm happy to hang around. But I think a lot of this stuff seems to me like you've got a fairly good handle on what needs to happen.

Speaker 1  1:49:41
Yeah, I think there's two things, though. Here I okay this one here, Wolf, Mike, one, we're saying it's one by six. I was throwing these RWs, and I don't even need to. You're, you're doing one by six at random price. You. So if I take that out, but one by six is saying it's random. Cutbacks is saying it's can't, right? So what do you how

Matthias Miller  1:50:12
we are specifying cutbacks separately, but we're taking random, looking at random first. So if you, if you scroll to the right just a little bit, you can see what I'm I'm calling it random because it's one by six.

Speaker 1  1:50:25
You're calling it random first, and that's fine. So whatever falls first and

Matthias Miller  1:50:31
well, it's no it's based on, I see if there, if it's one, if it's one by six, yeah, here, this should be this isn't quite right.

Matthias Miller  1:50:52
This is more right.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:03
Let me fix this a little bit.

Matthias Miller  1:51:10
One by six. That's not. Why is that? Not picking that up?

Matthias Miller  1:51:39
Okay, so, first, first checking for, first checking for, I mean, if the lumber itself is random, or if the or if there's random with RW or random in there, or if it starts with one by four, one by six or one by eight, then we assume it's random, okay?

Speaker 1  1:52:02
And after that, go ahead, yep. No, no. Go ahead, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:52:06
After that, check for plywoods, and then two buys, most of the two buys, then check for cutbacks, then check for cans, okay, and then I put Remy Well, actually, this remys can go up at the go up with the two buys, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:27
okay, gotcha, that's your sorting.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:31
The one other question then, do

Unknown Speaker  1:52:43
you got your year?

Matthias Miller  1:52:44
Yep, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:52:46
So we were talking about George and I were talking about this earlier in the Kent category. Where's it at that? I I'm not there anymore. Um, there's five and a half by sixes. There's five and a half by sixes in here, right there. So then we have, we have cans that we're getting in that are random width. Can't, instead of five and a half by six, they're five and a half by random width. RW, rights,

Speaker 1  1:53:36
I just want us to I want you to be aware of that. I don't. I think we can avoid it by well, how you doing it? George, like in the raw material, you're going to say calls for five and a half by six,

Speaker 2  1:53:55
but seeing a layer, we're figuring out how much board footage is in a layer, and how much board footage there is in a five and a half a six to tell me how many you know, man, it's still five and a half by six, yeah, but it's random width. But we're really figuring out is board footage in a five and a half a six, to tell me how many layers we're taking layers off of that bundle instead of but the layers consist of board footage of a five and a half by six. If you follow what I'm saying,

Speaker 1  1:54:26
but you're but George is it. Is it okay to leave it, to continue to call the raw material five and a half by six, and then you adjust it when you're cutting it, see

Speaker 2  1:54:40
the only thing is it's going to, I have to wait that out and put it after eight, five and a half random within there, because we don't have a category in right? That's the only difference in that. And that's what I was saying with sometimes I only have say I have three different sizes of cans, three and a half by eight and a half, eight. Three and a half by eight and a half, eight and a half 12. And I'm going to use three and a half by eight and a half 16. Say, I have four pieces, eight and a half, 810, piece, eight and a half, 12 and 68, and a half by 16. But there's only one or one item that I can put in there. Yeah. So if I do that, then I have to write in 10, eight and a half by 812, eight and a half of 12, and then the sixteens in my popular size.

Speaker 1  1:55:30
So I don't have that variable either. Yeah, so you don't have the ability to do multiple right, multiple different lengths for the same inventory, right?

Speaker 2  1:55:42
Old inventory, or something that chip wants me to use in the yard,

Speaker 1  1:55:46
which is the same somewhat scenario, yeah, because so you have five, nine by sixes, but you're going to use, oh, he's finding that by random you got to write in the layers.

Speaker 3  1:55:58
Is it? Well, mm, so

Matthias Miller  1:56:11
effectively, for all all calculations, we could treat it by five and a half by six. But as far as grouping and printouts and all this stuff like that. You want to present it in layers and present it in five and a bite as five and a half by random.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:30
That'd be a nice

Unknown Speaker  1:56:34
is it? Yeah, let's wait out.

Matthias Miller  1:56:39
They've saved the white out, white out trees.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:43
That's where the Penn State game.

Matthias Miller  1:56:55
Let me, let me, let me. Back burner, some spare brain. Brain cycles on that.

Speaker 1  1:57:05
Yeah, George, is it? So you're, you're, you're pushing the order across, printing it off, and then I do, then you're editing the paper itself with the pen. Then when, how's Tina?

Speaker 2  1:57:21
How's okay? See, she still has. She's her, yeah, she doesn't have.

Speaker 1  1:57:28
You're making sure you get the yield that you need. You're getting the yield at the end of the job. You're submitting that this is the yield. But then it's saying what you need this many five and a half by sixes, and you're changing it to random on the with white out. Same thing with your with your cancer. You're saying, hey, we need three and a half by eight sixteens, but you're printing it off. You're waiting it out and saying, only this many sixteens, this may 12, this many eights is what we're actually going to use at the end of the day. You're getting the yield, but you're just waiting it out to use a couple different lengths instead of what the thing generates anyway. Sorry, man, I just want, I didn't mean to do. I wasn't trying to run your brain on that. Is it? How important is it, George, to correct that at this time

Speaker 2  1:58:22
mine, you don't have to correct it right now. I mean, I let him spin his wheels and, you know me and come up, but, but

Speaker 1  1:58:29
because the pricing, this pricing project, could go weeks yet, I don't know how long, and it's

Unknown Speaker  1:58:37
something that we it's

Unknown Speaker  1:58:40
pretty Pat. Throw another curve ball at you before you go.

Matthias Miller  1:58:46
Yeah, I love curve balls. It's my it's what I eat for breakfast.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:49
Go back to home. Short bat,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:55
breakfast, the champions, Matt. Go to

Unknown Speaker  1:58:59
the go to the satellite

Unknown Speaker  1:59:01
where, what I deduct,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:08
enter time sheets.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:11
Matt, yeah, so,

Speaker 2  1:59:16
so what's happening on the time sheets? I had a guy that's been I took numerous days off. He leave it say he left at 810, to 905, and then he came back, started again. But the thing is, at the end time, won't stay there like he's like, he started at seven o'clock, and he left at 810 so I changed the end of the day to 810 but then when he comes back, and I type in the next say, comes back at 10 o'clock, it'll change that. So I need some type of clarification that i. I can get that time off, like at 905 that it'll stay there and then when he comes back at 10 o'clock. But now I don't know what to make it like. How these guys going to know between like 905 to 10 o'clock that he was completely missing? Like, put a category in of he on a vacation or doctor's appointment or because you're going to need to know, okay, what was he doing between 905 and 10 o'clock?

Matthias Miller  2:00:35
Well, what if we gave you a type for unpaid time off or or or, yeah. I mean, I guess that's what it would

Unknown Speaker  2:00:47
be. There you go, there you go.

Speaker 1  2:00:49
That'll take care of that problem, right? Then you then you don't have any more gaps. It's the gap that's the

Matthias Miller  2:00:56
I mean, the thing you could do now, if you wanted to, is you could extend the break, and we would treat it as non production, but we don't. We don't know the difference between are, are any of your breaks? I don't know if this matters. Are any of your breaks compensated? Are they on or off the clock?

Speaker 1  2:01:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah. First, the first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes is compensated. The half hour lunch is not compensated.

Matthias Miller  2:01:25
So we're not really tracking compensated versus non compensated breaks. So the other thing you could do is, I don't know, put it as you know, buildings, grounds, maintenance, and add a break over that time. But unpaid time off is easy enough to add, and it would take care that works. Okay, okay,

Speaker 1  2:01:50
so Matt, you want to just play it by ear?

Matthias Miller  2:01:56
Yeah, I'll be I gotta make a few phone calls and stuff, but I can be generally available if you want to just ping me and

Speaker 1  2:02:03
if there's things, okay, well, thanks, thanks a lot.

Matthias Miller  2:02:06
Do you want it? Do you want any time on the calendar tomorrow?

Unknown Speaker  2:02:13
Not sure. Um, I don't. I don't know. I'm sorry. I just,

Matthias Miller  2:02:20
I don't. That's fine, no worries.

Speaker 1  2:02:23
Probably should. We probably should actually just not between 12 and two.

Matthias Miller  2:02:33
Okay, I could, I could do, I could do

Matthias Miller  2:02:41
1045, to 12, or I could do anytime after

Unknown Speaker  2:02:45
that's fine. That's probably, that's

Speaker 1  2:02:50
Yeah, that's probably a good time. Okay, yep, I think so. Thank you all right. Thank you sir, Yep, see

Matthias Miller  2:02:56
ya. Yep.
