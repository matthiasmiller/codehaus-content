Speaker 1  00:00
The plan for here is simply to just ask ask you a bunch of a bunch of questions and let you talk and maybe ask more questions. And then we'll we'll take it and put something together. Just to give you kind of an overview of what we're thinking about is kind of what was your situation before? What what what what do you do? What was your situation before? What were things that you looked at? Or tried? And maybe briefly on what, what the process was like working with us from your experience? And then also, how are things? How are things different for for you now?

Unknown Speaker  00:51
Okay.

Speaker 1  00:56
So maybe Yeah, let's just maybe start with kind of just talk a little bit about what what your businesses and in which you are.

Unknown Speaker  01:06
So

Speaker 2  01:08
while this software was built for was mostly around deer season, which is a seasonal part of our main business, most of what we do is beef and pork processing, well, then the three months out of the year, October, November, December, when we're doing medicine, it's over, well over 2000 orders in three months period time. And that was a lot of a lot of paperwork to stay on top of and

Unknown Speaker  01:34
time,

Speaker 2  01:36
those, there is a way bigger chance of orders either getting lost or

Unknown Speaker  01:45
order changes put in to be

Unknown Speaker  01:48
implemented all the way through.

Speaker 2  01:52
And now with the software, we can change orders

Unknown Speaker  01:58
at any given time before the order is complete.

Unknown Speaker  02:03
And I guess the biggest

Speaker 2  02:07
The biggest advantage to this software is workforce, we were able to cut our office staff back by a good 50%.

Unknown Speaker  02:16
To where

Unknown Speaker  02:18
where everything was on paper before.

Speaker 2  02:22
Now as far as the invoicing goes, one person can do the work of two.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
And it's something that I can do at home evenings,

Speaker 2  02:32
without having to be in the office to do all that. So I can do pretty much wherever I want.

Unknown Speaker  02:44
So

Speaker 1  02:45
how like how often during the busy season before did you spend? Like how many evenings in that

Speaker 2  02:52
three month period? Would you have spent working at the office? Or did you just go in earlier? What did you do? Um, see, I never really did much of the invoicing myself before I always had sure other people delegate that do that during the work day. But now I can do it on the side whenever I want to. I don't have to take any papers with me. I can just do it on the computer wherever. Yeah, well, I was more mobile. I don't have I mean, there's still some papers, I have the tags that go with the order that come back into the office. But there's still got to be some paperwork, but not nearly to the extent of what we had. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  03:33
Do you have any stories of

Speaker 1  03:37
other I don't want to paint you in a bad light, but just an example of something that went sideways because a quarter change was missed given examples story like that from before.

Speaker 2  03:50
Um, nothing really comes to mind. But the only the biggest thing about order changes was we always told people you know, we'll try to change the order of being that was his change, since they put it in like a day later, I can guarantee that we can do the chart, the order change, but this way, we can guarantee it more. So even if this order did come through as initially ordered. Customer did have the warning that no, it might not be able to change it depending on where in the process it was. Obviously, even now, it's a process to support that process. We can't change the order. But at any time up until his process, we can change it which was tough to do before because you have to track that order down manually.

Speaker 1  04:41
How's that? How have customers responded to that change? Have they noticed that at all or do you see any difference?

Speaker 2  04:53
Not so much on their end, the biggest sevenish that the customer see is actually the office Automated notification put the texting thing that we, that we set up, which is, I don't know if you guys have done that before or not, but it's definitely worked out well an hour. And once we got all the kinks out of those. So that's one thing that the customers really like was to get a ping on their phone and like, oh, we're gonna go get our stuff now. And they it's been very effective on that end, but first order change. I don't think it changed much as far as on the customers. And there's more for our convenience.

Speaker 1  05:36
Has it shortened the time that your packaged goods set?

Unknown Speaker  05:41
Should at your freezers?

Speaker 2  05:48
I think so, yes. Because we were able to keep the oldest orders at highest priority, because we were able to see quicker which ones were the oldest?

Unknown Speaker  05:59
The oldest order so yeah, I would say it helped with

Speaker 2  06:06
how to word it. Yeah, when it came to the shelf life, but as far as more no sale orders, were able to get those order order orders completed first, rather than the one got pushed, like on the bottom of the shelf in the back. And then again, seen for a while later. I mean, we can see everything on the computer now. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:33
Tim, you're asking?

Unknown Speaker  06:39
Um, I

Unknown Speaker  06:43
don't remember what that was. Um,

Unknown Speaker  06:48
let's see.

Speaker 3  06:52
See, explain some of your, your situation before the and some of the things that you were wanting to change, you mentioned the paperwork, and the time invested chances of things getting lost, nothing going to follow through not being able to guarantee or changes. So would you say those are your main pain points, things that you were, you were looking to change?

Speaker 2  07:19
Right. So before when we lost an actual piece of paper, that paper order,

Unknown Speaker  07:25
we have nothing to go back on.

Speaker 2  07:28
Short of calling the customer. So now if we lose a paper it's really not lost. Because it's all just like going back and just print another one.

Speaker 1  07:40
Yeah, yep. And before you wouldn't even necessarily, if you lost the paper, there's a chance you didn't even know for sure who the customer was, is that. Right? Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker 1  07:58
And then you say you reduce the office staffed by 50%? What was the like, How many? How many people did you have working on that before? How many? How many hours? Was that seasonal? Or? Or? I mean, did you have that? It was seasonal. I don't know barnacle? Put an our finger on it. Because it was

Speaker 2  08:21
I used to just pull people from the processing floor to help with paperwork in the office to do the manual handwriting and the invoices and stuff. And now an eight hour work of invoicing I can do in like an hour's time. If I had time after dinner or something like that. Yeah. And on top of that, the biggest thing was the the biggest time saver, I guess besides even just reading the invoices by hand was calling every every single last order, calling them and notifying them that the order is ready. It's amazing how much time you can spend just on one single phone call. Mm hmm.

Speaker 1  09:03
So do you have here any kind of numbers on how much time that saved you just in calling people?

Unknown Speaker  09:11
Oh boy.

Unknown Speaker  09:17
Not really.

Speaker 2  09:21
I don't I mean, my wife sometimes would go into separate offices on two separate phone lines and just call for like a couple hours versus something I could do in five minutes now. I don't know I haven't really thought about how much time we're spending our phone calls and a lot of hours. We could run out at work. It's it's not that was every day it was just whenever we had a big bulk of orders coming through all at once. Like this time of the year though, we're there's so little that as an orders coming through and you can probably see right now. I don't Got 13 orders? Right now? I'm just manually calling everybody on these orders this time of the year, but

Unknown Speaker  10:11
yeah, come deer season? I don't know.

Speaker 2  10:15
She probably saved. Let me see that seasons only about three months long. So 588 hours a week at least,

Unknown Speaker  10:28
that we're saving. So that's

Speaker 2  10:32
another day, at least eight hours, which I can do now in five minutes. Not even now. Yeah.

Speaker 1  10:46
And then you said you move staff basically, instead of pulling staff off production. To help with invoicing, they're able to stay in production. Does that mean what are what are impacts on? I mean, are you able to scale up production because of that? or cut back over time? Or what's what is it? What impact does it have on the business and on the employees?

Speaker 2  11:17
Less just less disruption on the processing flow. So now instead of pulling somebody off, and then the rest of them try to pick up the slack? That's less interruptions. Plus, we did put in more time saving equipment this year to them. So it's going to be I'll be able to move people into more of the labor intensive parts. Not really that we're laying off people or anything, you just don't have to

Unknown Speaker  11:48
hire extra help, I guess. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  11:53
Yeah, make sense?

Speaker 1  11:57
And I mean, and by extension of this, it probably it probably makes a I mean, it's stressful as I'm kind of assuming. So tell me if this assumption is right. But these are the most stressful three months of the year. And anything you can do for your employees to minimize disruption and help them just get in the flow and stay in the flow, it's going to be it's going to reduce their kind of their stress through that through that busy season.

Unknown Speaker  12:23
Right. That and the overhead in general?

Unknown Speaker  12:28
Or in general?

Unknown Speaker  12:40
I'd be interested to hear

Unknown Speaker  12:43
what was a system tracking?

Unknown Speaker  12:48
You have

Unknown Speaker  12:50
printed off

Unknown Speaker  12:52
these spreadsheets. What was what was your system

Unknown Speaker  12:55
before?

Speaker 2  12:57
You're breaking up there, Tim? I can't make out. I don't know it's magic near you.

Unknown Speaker  13:03
I can't tell you.

Unknown Speaker  13:06
Okay, Is this better?

Unknown Speaker  13:08
Yep, a little bit better.

Speaker 3  13:11
Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, I was wondering what your system was that you use before you mentioned paperwork, and having paper trail. What the system was to you before, to manage all that.

Speaker 2  13:28
Before we just use the 16 square pieces of wax paper, they're pretty nicely there, Patty paper all used to lay in between the patty. So it was a symbol, wax paper that we can write magic marker on, and it could get wet and wouldn't disintegrate. It's basically, I don't know, then those, those are the tickets that I was talking about that we could lose. Sometimes not always, sometimes gonna get lost. And it's kind of hard to track it down. If it went in the trash, there's no tracking down. But so that's all we had was those little squares of paper. And then those came back into the office. And then we were attached in ways to that. So now instead of those papers, being I guess what I'm talking about paperwork, and so keeping track of those, that was our system, we've had nothing like on the computer now you can tell exactly who is the oldest without having to go through that whole stack of emulators or papers.

Speaker 1  14:37
And did you have any kind of I know, one of the things we looked at was, I mean, one of the things that we you talked about earlier was this knowing what to process when but did you have any kind of Excel spreadsheets that you'd set up before? Was it still just me it was just those asleep?

Speaker 2  14:53
Yeah, we had nothing on computer nothing on Excel or nothing? Yes, okay.

Unknown Speaker  15:01
Um,

Unknown Speaker  15:02
what were you?

Speaker 1  15:08
What prompted your decision? or What were you thinking when I don't even know which ad that you would have seen that you'd have responded to? But you're definitely open to something before before reaching out to us. But what was kind of your thought? Are you thinking, I guess leading up to reaching out to us?

Speaker 2  15:32
I knew when back in my mind that we're going to have to have somewhat of a software and somewhat some sort of computer based software to keep track of invoices number one. And I had looked a little bit into QuickBooks, but I, I was not comfortable with that. Because way too, as much baggage on it. bunch of stuff that we don't need it. I just didn't see that working. I actually saw your ad in the PCB, about building software specifically.

Unknown Speaker  16:04
For the customer, not it's not generic software.

Speaker 2  16:10
And so that's why it gave me a call and that just went from there.

Unknown Speaker  16:15
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  16:20
So besides looking at me QuickBooks was then really the the other thing that you were looking at the point

Speaker 2  16:29
I hadn't really looked into different anything else other than just something that came to mind first, like QuickBooks with demand, and that didn't really fit the bill.

Unknown Speaker  16:37
Yeah.

Speaker 2  16:40
That was kind of looking for somebody to build something specifically for us. I knew there was probably no software out there, because I've never heard of any other butchers talking about any software for order tracking. So I was kind of I kind of knew that there was nothing out there already, for specifically this type of business. And actually, since we've implemented this, I was talking with some other butchers about what we designed. And they're really interested in using it as well. The only drawback they have is they're not allowed to have internet. And

Speaker 1  17:20
this is a little bit of a side note, but we've been looking at putting together business terminals, which I don't know, I don't know what's allowed for them or what's not, but it's basically a very locked down. Kind of mini computer. that right? Yeah. Kind of like kind of like, I think,

Speaker 2  17:46
good. We had that in one of your ads. Right. I think I saw that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  17:54
So we're there's a lot of details to work out with that as far as what types of communities it works for. But so So you knew you I mean, you you've never come across anything like that you hadn't hadn't talked to anybody else who had that? What, how would you describe your experience of working with this was? We see everything from our end? But what was your What was it like from your your angle?

Speaker 2  18:26
Right. In the beginning, there was a learning curve, of course, which I knew there was going to be but as far as working with you guys was a pleasure. And I know there's a kind of a a waiting period to get upgrades done. Well, that's understandable.

Unknown Speaker  18:43
It takes us time to process something. So.

Speaker 2  18:49
Yeah, I mean, I've been very happy with working with you guys. It was just symbols, even signatures. They've had a question that's either email Tim or whoever, and quite quickly got back to us on any questions we had. And we're very happy.

Speaker 1  19:05
Yep. And then to somebody who hasn't been through kind of the, all of those phone calls. How would you How would you describe what those phone calls are like or? Yeah.

Speaker 2  19:23
My experience the phone calls were a communication skills builder.

Unknown Speaker  19:28
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  19:33
talk a little more about that.

Speaker 2  19:39
timely, I mean, lengthy phone calls, but I was impressed by how detailed your questions were coming from your end to try to understand our business.

Unknown Speaker  19:52
But I could tell that

Unknown Speaker  19:55
you're trying to get a sense of how we operate. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:09
And

Speaker 1  20:13
this is not even really related to the case study. But one of the things that you mentioned

Unknown Speaker  20:22
that

Speaker 1  20:25
is a potential opportunity for growth for us is if if we would have capacity for faster turnaround on projects, but are there other things from your experience that other ways that we could have made the process better that that you thought about?

Unknown Speaker  20:44
I don't know, I haven't really been thinking about that.

Speaker 2  20:48
anything good takes times I was, I wasn't really worried about the turnaround time on changes. It just brought to it just made me think more ahead of time, when I knew there was time to do updates, or whatever it is, make sure that you know of any changes that need to be done, so that they can be all done at once.

Unknown Speaker  21:09
Yeah. Tim, what other What other questions?

Unknown Speaker  21:17
Have you been thinking about?

Unknown Speaker  21:24
All right, um, I guess

Speaker 3  21:25
one says, taking us back to the beginning and the question about what you do. I'm thinking about the case study. Could be interesting to hear a little bit more about

Unknown Speaker  21:36
yourself.

Speaker 3  21:38
Maybe the background of the business. Is this something you started up? Is it

Unknown Speaker  21:43
been a

Unknown Speaker  21:45
family business for a while?

Speaker 2  21:50
So my brother started it, and all six, and quickly grew tired of it. So in Oh, nine, I took it over. And that was in 2009. So it's been 11 years now. And we've grown How can you see?

Unknown Speaker  22:13
500% since then,

Unknown Speaker  22:23
I got my percentages, right? Yeah, he's really

Speaker 3  22:30
talking. Employees revenue.

Unknown Speaker  22:35
Revenue base percentage wise. Yeah.

Speaker 2  22:40
So from 10,000 709 How's that?

Unknown Speaker  22:46
Go ahead.

Speaker 2  22:48
From 200,000 to a million now as well. 500%. Right. Yeah, I got that. Right. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  22:54
Yep. Yeah, and my

Speaker 3  23:00
other question was, how many employees do you have?

Speaker 2  23:06
Average 12 across the whole year? Uh, huh.

Unknown Speaker  23:15
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:20
All right. And you said that you

Unknown Speaker  23:23
season you

Speaker 3  23:25
usually have over 2000 orders that you process.

Unknown Speaker  23:29
Yeah, that's right around 2000 to 2200.

Unknown Speaker  23:33
Uh huh. Okay. And

Speaker 3  23:36
what are the what are the things you are not all of them what kind of overview of things you offer for processing here. They bring in, they bring in the weird they bring it in, already quartered

Speaker 2  23:50
skin well about half about half of the orders are holed there with a skin on so we do right over 1000 or just over 1000 the last couple years. A whole deer and the remainder of the orders make up of boneless venison that comes in we have a big half of our customers keep on their own and then either freeze it or then bringing it fresh I didn't wait until after the bulk of the season is passed then bring it in but most times during the season is comes in fresh ready. Just Just cut off the bone. Ah and our big our biggest item is hot dogs we did over last year. You can probably look it up on the software but fits well with 40,000 pounds hot dogs.

Unknown Speaker  24:43
This is last year. Yes. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  24:45
Just in that three month period.

Unknown Speaker  24:50
Wow, that's crazy.

Speaker 2  24:56
So when an average hotdog order is 25 pounds,

Unknown Speaker  25:01
That's a lot of people to

Speaker 2  25:04
keep track of. And that's only one item of approximately eight categories of products that we make. And each category can have four different variations as far as different cheese added and different mixing stuff.

Unknown Speaker  25:23
Ah,

Unknown Speaker  25:26
see?

Unknown Speaker  25:32
Let's see.

Speaker 1  25:36
Do you know the total number of like categories and variations?

Unknown Speaker  25:45
Just think about that one a minute.

Speaker 2  25:54
Right around 18 to 20 different that is at least 20 different items that we process.

Unknown Speaker  26:11
All right.

Speaker 3  26:16
Okay, that's interesting. Um, nice. Yeah. These questions, you thought of what we were talking there.

Speaker 1  26:25
I thought it could be interesting to you say 2000. Dear, but what's what would be the

Unknown Speaker  26:31
the total?

Speaker 1  26:33
Or maybe we should run this report the total amount of meat?

Unknown Speaker  26:37
pounds?

Speaker 2  26:41
Yeah, if you put in from October 1 until December 31, just that three month period, you can go by the total damage on your report. That would be your and then just divide that by 2000. Or you can also see how many customer orders total that work as well. Yeah. Yeah. Because but the reason I say December 31, because first of January, we started processing beef and pork again. So those totals will be on the system. Man. That's a lot of weight. So in order to get venison, you can do just October 1 through December 31. Good.

Speaker 3  27:22
Good. I was gonna say so the venison is enough that you actually shut down the other the other parts of the business of beef and pork?

Unknown Speaker  27:33
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  27:35
Wow.

Speaker 2  27:52
I was waiting for a nice day to get an arrow photo, the whole the

Unknown Speaker  27:57
whole plant here. So party.

Speaker 2  28:00
We have a mold yard here in the last month and a half. And now all of a sudden, everything's nice and green again. So I need to mow the yard and trim everything up and get a nice picture for you.

Speaker 1  28:10
Cool. Sounds good. Hey, if you? I don't know this is this is something else that popped in my head. But doing a if you haven't drone, I don't know if you could do this. I don't know what size it is or how this How well does it work? But doing a video walkthrough of your operation to even just? Yeah, we couldn't find it. That was my phone.

Unknown Speaker  28:38
Yes, yes, that would work.

Speaker 1  28:42
And we might just kind of speed it up. I'm just gonna give a brief.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
Even if it's without any kind of explanation, it's kind of like,

Unknown Speaker  28:50
a chance to visualize it.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
If you ever do, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:57
See,

Speaker 1  28:59
I don't have any symptoms. I'm kind of going going through some notes here.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
So just to clarify.

Speaker 1  29:14
Maybe when people can then we talked about those barcodes? I mean, we've talked about the labels. I mean, are we aware of those labels you print? You typically have two people up front taking taking orders during the busy season?

Speaker 2  29:30
Or Yeah, so we have I got two laptops out front by the sales counter. There's another two back in the office. But there's Yeah, the two out in the front.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
There the

Speaker 2  29:42
even with two people taking orders, there's Yeah, two lines of people waiting to check in their product. Yeah. So we're only using the white label the the Green Label Printer we're having problems with so I just listed everything on the white label. It's easy to see on there. And was born in or not? Yeah, I know, actually, we have set up for different colors, but it's easier just to stay on one color. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:11
Okay. Make sense? Good to know.

Speaker 1  30:15
And then the I forget how we how we had that. So I mean, there's there's that that label goes in the in the cavity and then are you printing a second label for the, for the customer then?

Speaker 2  30:28
I guess so it automatically prints off to one for the customer copy one for our copy, and then I just give the one copy to the customer read something that they really appreciate. They can bring it back with them. And that's something that we ran into before was a customer accounts back in and they forget what they ordered. It seems that way. And then they're kind of disappointed in what to get because they forgotten that they ordered the way they did not. Yeah, that happened maybe once or twice. This way they get their ticket and they know what they got. They know where they got coming. And then they can instead of calling back and verify stuff they can see right on their slip. And then they can change it if they need to.

Speaker 1  31:12
It would seem to that knowing that your

Unknown Speaker  31:16
that your deer has a has a number to it.

Speaker 1  31:21
Yeah, I don't know if anybody said anything to it. Like it feels more like okay, this is safe, I can trust it. It's going to

Unknown Speaker  31:29
now go

Unknown Speaker  31:31
somewhere as

Speaker 1  31:33
more reliable or certain or like or like I actually can't more tangible even almost.

Unknown Speaker  31:41
Right. Like that might be the right word.

Unknown Speaker  31:46
Has anybody said anything about it? Or have you see and have are?

Speaker 2  31:55
Not really they're so used to getting a ticket now that they they wait until I give them one before they turn around and leave? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  32:16
And then the pickup process work. So we talked a little bit about how this changes how how gets processed and packaged, that when people come to pick, pick these up? Has this made any changes in how you can kind of how streamlined that is how that works? Or is that pretty similar?

Speaker 2  32:38
That car stayed pretty similar so that our copy of the ticket to the customer gets a copy right? When they drop it off, we get a copy we keep the copy in that order that becomes our packing slip to then go in the freezer and pick that order.

Unknown Speaker  32:54
So everything's on there

Unknown Speaker  32:58
that process didn't really change any.

Unknown Speaker  33:03
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  33:13
So what were

Unknown Speaker  33:16
would you have had any

Unknown Speaker  33:19
be the word

Speaker 3  33:22
any of these or any concerns about switching to a system like this?

Unknown Speaker  33:30
Before

Speaker 3  33:31
before jumping into it, obviously you knew something had to change and you're willing to dive in but did you have any reservations or concerns

Unknown Speaker  33:40
going into it?

Speaker 2  33:44
Not really. I was kind of computer savvy to begin with so I was ready to embrace that move I didn't realize how much course I had the water from it guys guy that was I kind of knew him personally from growing up here. So I didn't I wasn't really aware that he was into the into that kind of work until I asked him they Hey, who can I find around here to do some ID work for me he goes How much does it pay

Unknown Speaker  34:12
so that was

Speaker 2  34:15
that made everything way easier for us was having our IT guy somebody that I personally knew from growing up that that's what he did all work at his job. So he just did this on the side and was able to take off of his job whenever really he made his own hours

Unknown Speaker  34:31
and just swing over to help us and

Speaker 2  34:35
and we set up the TeamViewer software on our computers and he can come in and fix problems if there is any. So as far as adding the the computer hardware stuff. Yeah, he spent a lot of time here but it's there was one aspect that I hadn't considered how much time we can get into the hardware itself, but it's having him on board made it a whole lot uneasier

Speaker 1  35:02
and then has as most of its health bit I mean his he's been primarily focused on kind of the hardware side with the it would be the the labels the some of the wireless and just getting the laptop set up is that did he help at all with any

Unknown Speaker  35:22
other things in the software side

Unknown Speaker  35:26
not really no he never really

Unknown Speaker  35:29
did anything with the software

Speaker 2  35:32
was all just sort of the hardware side that he did all the wireless stuff and all the network give that up

Speaker 2  35:44
and actually just this summer they brought fiber optic right past our place so hopefully we can get that set up for like in the next month. That'd be perfect. Nice that would be perfect. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  36:05
Good

Unknown Speaker  36:08
to have what else you do

Speaker 3  36:14
let's see so we're looking specifically before during and after we're doing and since I guess one other thing this would be maybe helpful for other people looking at getting into a project like this Do you have any any input on like things that would be helpful for someone to know as you know in getting into a project like this What would you tell somebody who who's considering a project like this

Speaker 2  36:50
probably the biggest thing is make sure you allow enough time for from

Unknown Speaker  36:55
from the drawing board to the finished product to

Speaker 2  37:00
to not I guess not expect something to be done overnight. It's it is a drawn out process it takes time to develop something like this and

Unknown Speaker  37:11
of course I don't know if you want to

Unknown Speaker  37:15
I don't know how to word it

Unknown Speaker  37:29
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  37:34
sure.

Unknown Speaker  37:39
I don't have any of I have any advice for

Speaker 2  37:44
any future customers but it's our process and worth every penny Yep.

Speaker 1  37:57
And I guess one of the questions with that is if you're saying that you feel very comfortable with the return you got on your investment as far as your business is concerned

Speaker 2  38:15
yes because it's it's gonna pay for itself is a jet and already just from the time that it saves it does something off to the side we had problems with course this is not nothing to do with the software but we had Well yeah, I guess it is you're able to look up orders from prior times we had to replace a product because of a

Unknown Speaker  38:44
bad cheese that we had mixed in

Speaker 2  38:48
after the fact we found out that it was bad because it was ruining the finished product and we had to go back and replace some people's orders and we had one instance where the customer said you got X amount of poundage which was way more than what the computer show what he got so that right there saved us a little bit of money before I had to go buy the customers why because suddenly start looking for a piece of paper that's in effect of 2000

Unknown Speaker  39:18
oh my goodness

Unknown Speaker  39:21
Wow.

Unknown Speaker  39:26
That's a great example.

Speaker 1  39:44
Well, I'm I'm running I'm running out of questions. Tim what we will have to keep going till till 330 if if we don't have anything else but Tim if you do or or even Glad if you've got other things you can think of it'd be helpful to add.

Speaker 2  40:07
I did have one question that has nothing to do with the case study, get template, as good

Unknown Speaker  40:17
as it might be,

Speaker 2  40:20
might not be in time to do with the update. But when I invoice an order, it automatically inverts the whole stack of line items, is that something you can change to where it stays in the order that the items get put in? Initially?

Unknown Speaker  40:42
I would, I would think so.

Speaker 1  40:46
Yes. And I don't know where we're at. We'll just have to see once.

Unknown Speaker  40:55
You have a better sense where we're at on that on that.

Speaker 1  40:59
process. But I figured it should be good.

Speaker 3  41:04
Pretty sure that job is ready for me to test I should be testing next week. And then we'll be rolling it out. Maybe next week.

Unknown Speaker  41:14
Okay, but I

Unknown Speaker  41:15
could pass this along to developers and

Unknown Speaker  41:18
see if it's something that they could fast track, get it caught.

Speaker 1  41:23
We have a couple of projects mix. This is full disclosure. I'm like the guy who likes to jump on things and say anything is possible, just because I don't know why. God gives some people like that it's either a blessing or a curse.

Unknown Speaker  41:43
But But it seems to me a simple fix

Speaker 1  41:47
to do that. So I think I think the right thing to do is Yeah, Tim, if you if you want to check in with, with Alex, or maybe the development team, and maybe the development team and see if

Unknown Speaker  41:58
if it'd be possible to do that.

Unknown Speaker  42:01
Seems like, it does seem like a relatively simple

Speaker 3  42:07
say, when you when you invoice an order, then it inverts the list of items on that order.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
Right?

Speaker 2  42:21
So I try to put my stuff in in order of I don't know, depending on if you look at the ticket it's more what I'm doing some invoicing on the side that that is not really an order. Like if I do some beef and pork processing invoicing on the software, I try to do put them kind of in an order. And then as soon as I go to invoice and then the first item is waiting the bottom and it's it's backwards, so it would just be easier if everything would stay in the order that it gets input.

Unknown Speaker  42:55
Mm

Unknown Speaker  42:57
hmm.

Unknown Speaker  42:59
Yeah.

Speaker 3  43:00
And is that is it only on the invoice that it that it flips it around? Or does it in the order detail itself? The clips

Unknown Speaker  43:06
around to know it's only on the invoicing

Unknown Speaker  43:10
invoice. Yeah.

Speaker 2  43:10
Okay. So what I started to do if I want it to look perfect for a certain customer might is put in backwards then it came out right?

Unknown Speaker  43:23
works, but it's not the way it's first.

Unknown Speaker  43:30
More than one way to skin a cat.

Speaker 1  43:33
There's an Indian proverb that I love that says there's two ways to touch your nose. You need attention on the back of your head.

Unknown Speaker  43:43
Being

Unknown Speaker  43:50
good, Tim, when that

Unknown Speaker  43:54
going

Speaker 2  43:55
bad. But I do take that aerial photo, where do you want to send it to them? Or I guess either one of you doesn't really matter.

Speaker 1  44:02
Yeah, send it send it to send it to either one of us or send it to both.

Unknown Speaker  44:09
Yeah, sounds good.

Speaker 3  44:15
Yeah, and I think if we have any other follow up questions as we're putting this together, we can

Unknown Speaker  44:20
send you an email.

Speaker 2  44:22
Yeah, sure. If you need to clarify anything, just go ahead. Send me an email and whatever. I'll try to get back to you.

Speaker 1  44:35
Sounds good. Well, I appreciate I appreciate you taking the time when and no problem. Yeah, it's been a fun it was a fun project. I still have a lot of fond memories of of that just because of the results we were able to, to get for you. But did you have any software similar to mine before this or was a lot everybody's different? There is. So we've we've seen a big trend kind of around order management, you were the first person to do text messaging. But we're actually have a client looking at text messaging they have, they have a delivery route. And but one of the things, and this this could affect you will be in, we can be in touch with you, as this develops. And one of the things we're looking at is putting a text messaging interface in the software. So that if there's a text that, that that's not recognized by the automation, that you can manually respond to it, or manually send messages to it. So it wouldn't be quite as still not as streamlined as just pulling out your phone and sending text messages that way. But it gives you hopefully, still a fairly streamlined way of messaging back and forth with people. Right.

Speaker 2  45:54
I noticed on Twilio, I have to sign in every time I do a batch of texting, I find it on Twilio account, just to see how many error codes we get. Like sometimes if I try to text a landline, it will let me know. And I go back and I write down the the order numbers, I can go back and manually call those people in. And just from going through Twilio website, there's a lot that can be done through text messaging, and automated testing and automated messaging and all that it's this is only the tip of the iceberg, what we've been doing with it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:31
that's true.

Unknown Speaker  46:35
Obviously, have I haven't pulled up the website, they're looking at

Speaker 1  46:39
marketing operations, I'd actually be a good thing to kind of read through because I'm sure that would give us ideas of ways to potentially engage with engage with clients today might be a good fit for them.

Speaker 2  46:56
Eventually, what will be really handy was would be to, if a customer would ask how much is my bill, that it would automatically tell them the total for that specific order number? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  47:10
But I doubt

Unknown Speaker  47:13
Yeah, we won't be getting into that this year.

Unknown Speaker  47:19
The challenge is that

Unknown Speaker  47:24
you kind of want some kind of,

Speaker 1  47:29
I don't know, ability to process questions and guess kind of guess what people meant based on the words that they use.

Unknown Speaker  47:40
And

Speaker 1  47:43
yeah, with with messenger bots, like in Facebook, I don't know if you've seen any of those, or if you're on Facebook, but they have something similar, but then they give you buttons that you can click with all the pods that are recognized. And it sends a message with that with those words.

Unknown Speaker  48:02
But you don't really have that in the same way.

Speaker 1  48:06
The other thing we could look at how many of your, I guess if they have a phone, they they Ave them have smartphones, and how many of them are standard flip phones or something like that?

Speaker 2  48:19
Pretty much in today's day and age, I see very little flip phones anymore.

Speaker 1  48:24
So if we, if we have an interface, they can log in online, so they put in their phone number. And they put in their order number that we could show them the order the order details there.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
That is the possibility. Yeah.

Speaker 1  48:38
And maybe even show them you know what stage it is in the process. Right.

Unknown Speaker  48:48
Yeah, interesting. Cool.

Speaker 2  48:53
There's a lot that can be done and was just a little thing that fits in the pocket.

Unknown Speaker  48:58
Yep. Yep. Very true.

Unknown Speaker  49:03
Very true. Yeah. Good.

Speaker 1  49:13
All right. Well, well. Yeah. Thanks again for your time, I think I think that covers what we need on our end. And, Tim, you'll check in on the on the line items. And once we have a draft, we will send it over to you just so you can look over it. We want you to be comfortable with what's going out and

Speaker 2  49:36
in touch. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yep, for sure. Thanks. Yeah, you bet.

Unknown Speaker  49:44
Yeah, thanks.
