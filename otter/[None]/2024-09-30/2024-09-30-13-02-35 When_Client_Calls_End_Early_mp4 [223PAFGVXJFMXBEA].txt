I think one of the best, one of the best ways for client calls to end is when we just get through everything, and it's we're done early, and there's really nothing to talk about, and client is there, and it's like, I've gotten I've gotten everything I went. We went past the bonus time. I got more than what I came for, and we still have time left over. So one of the fun experiences was with this, my client was, was a was a consultant, and he flipped the script, and it was said, Okay, we got this extra time. How about you? And I talk about you, I was like, Sure. So it's one of the things I love about clients. I'm obviously here to make sure that people get their money's worth and times worth. But we had a great time.
