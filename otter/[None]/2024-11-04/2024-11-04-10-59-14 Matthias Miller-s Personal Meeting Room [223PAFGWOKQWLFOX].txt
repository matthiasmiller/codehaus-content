Speaker 1  02:43
Hey, Matthias, how is the fine state of Colorado and its illustrious occupants doing?

Matthias Miller  02:56
Big question. Well, I discovered that we're about to get a surge of

Unknown Speaker  03:02
of occupants, really, within the week.

Unknown Speaker  03:05
Oh yes,

Matthias Miller  03:07
correct. Benita was like, Do you remember? Do you remember Ken Rochelle, oldest daughter's name? And then she's like, she's getting married to my there too. It's her brother in law's cousin. Oh, okay, hilarious. There you go. So she was together with her sisters this past weekend, right? Yeah, they were catching up. So anyway,

Unknown Speaker  03:34
nice,

Unknown Speaker  03:35
nice. That's

Unknown Speaker  03:38
an interesting connection.

Unknown Speaker  03:39
It is.

Matthias Miller  03:42
So I had is me and kiddos for like, three, three days. So how did that go? Very, pretty much, we covered the whole gamut.

Unknown Speaker  03:57
Oh, I am sure

Matthias Miller  04:00
it was good. I think by like yesterday, we kind of got in the groove and, like, found a little bit of a rhythm, sure, yeah.

Speaker 1  04:08
Well, let's see, there's, is it Six?

Matthias Miller  04:11
Six? Yeah. Oh, my word. The year old, a little

Speaker 1  04:15
over a year with a max of 910, Max, okay. Oh, he is growing up.

Matthias Miller  04:25
Yeah, he is.

Matthias Miller  04:34
And now it's cold and wet majority and it's,

Unknown Speaker  04:38
it's wonderful. It really is,

Speaker 1  04:41
yeah, Kansas got like two inches of rain on Saturday, I think, and they're doing more today. Oh, wow. And they had point four inches earlier that, like four tenths of four tenths earlier in the week, and there's more later this week. So it's like finally getting rain. I.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
A high time.

Unknown Speaker  05:05
That's awesome, badly, high time.

Speaker 2  05:09
Well, this is kind of unusual. We're not usually. We'll give them a few minutes. I

Speaker 1  05:13
mean, I'm often this late, but they aren't. It's bad. I just it's somehow, like, I know it's coming up, and then suddenly, boom, I'm like, three minutes late.

Unknown Speaker  05:25
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:26
when you're used to I find, like, I think one of the hardest things in life is playing the dance between deep work and meetings. It's like you can either do one really well or do the other really well, but jumping back and forth, I don't know, no,

Speaker 1  05:47
yeah, I basically just try to avoid meetings, if possible. Actually, I don't really, I don't think I do much to avoid them. I just don't, just really don't have very many.

Unknown Speaker  06:03
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:06
I'm pretty happy to keep it that way for now. Dad is very squarely on the other side of things.

Matthias Miller  06:13
He's like everything to somebody else whenever possible.

Unknown Speaker  06:16
Oh, very much. So actually, COVID view Seth, do you want to come hang out and watch?

Matthias Miller  06:22
I mean, you know, I don't know, not really.

Unknown Speaker  06:29
He does that more if Nick's around,

Unknown Speaker  06:34
but Nick's not around,

Matthias Miller  06:36
this is some writing CCI series on software disasters.

Speaker 1  06:41
Oh, I heard it's how the last one ended. It was something like he had this brilliant idea to call his nephew or something. Yes,

Speaker 3  06:50
this is gonna guess how this is gonna go.

Speaker 1  06:56
It was making my fingernails grow into my hands or something.

Unknown Speaker  07:05
It's funny.

Matthias Miller  07:07
Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, this is probably, I don't know. Sometimes I wonder if I should be doing more of it. I know I know everything so deeply well that I can,

Unknown Speaker  07:20
yeah. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  07:23
do more. I know what's going on. People spoke like writing more stories like this for each other and stuff like that. And it's like, I mean, nobody markets like this. They should, but they don't. Nobody else, nobody else, nobody else. Well, not sorry, most, let's, let's be more accurate, most of the world doesn't market like, yeah, yeah. And I think it's a really powerful way of marketing, given the moment you've got somebody who's been through any part of this experience or like, Oh, I feel seen and heard. All right, make sure there's no emails And I'm going to call Mark. I'm

Speaker 2  08:44
let's do this. Drew Mark was Twain gonna come today. Drew Mark Twain so we still on for one. Me team today. All right, somebody will get back to us.

Unknown Speaker  09:06
Yes, it's just very unusual.

Matthias Miller  09:11
It is quite unusual unless the internet went down.

Unknown Speaker  09:15
But Dwayne should know, yeah, you

Unknown Speaker  09:17
think

Speaker 2  09:18
we could ping him? Dwayne, do I have a thread for the Yes, probably do you?

Speaker 1  09:39
Maybe we got an email from Mark earlier in the day. Yeah, we did, but I haven't seen I chased that a little bit, not very much. I didn't find anything. Okay,

Matthias Miller  09:50
I wonder. Well, I

Speaker 1  09:52
saw what he's saying is true that the macro like evaluate, it shows something different on the detail screen, but I evaluated them. Macro we use to in the report, and it evaluates the same as the one on the detail screen right now to

Matthias Miller  10:07
so one of the things that we've done, I mean, we we take what we paid to date and divide it out. So if there's a rounding discrepancy, I mean, I'm going to guess that somewhere there's a I don't understand why it'd be 666, 25 versus 6627 but if I have any, if you

Unknown Speaker  10:32
Hola, what was it?

Unknown Speaker  10:37
I have an excuse for being late.

Matthias Miller  10:41
But I'm just wondering about Mark. Like, I mean, I can call drew on his cell, see what, see what he's up to. Mark's never this this late,

Speaker 4  10:50
which is bad, because I only have to 130 that I can be here. Oh,

Matthias Miller  10:54
we tried calling

Unknown Speaker  10:57
Mark already, and he wasn't responding. Oh, it'll

Unknown Speaker  11:00
just go. It'll go straight to voicemail.

Matthias Miller  11:03
Okay. Oh, there we go. Hey, he's right here. He is right here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  11:14
gonna grab some water. Try

Unknown Speaker  11:16
Ogi, Dogi, I'm

Speaker 5  11:28
Hey, Drew Hey, hello, sorry we had 130 in our heads. Oh,

Matthias Miller  11:34
okay, fair enough. So Duane ran off to get some water, but he has to drop off at the bottom of the hour, so at 130

Speaker 1  11:44
I think he said 130 Yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:47
so which is the anyway, is that? Which is the bottom of the the hour?

Unknown Speaker  11:58
Okay, the bottom of the clock, bottom of

Unknown Speaker  12:00
the quads fair. Yeah, you're

Unknown Speaker  12:04
right. The hour would be 159

Unknown Speaker  12:07
that's what I was thinking.

Matthias Miller  12:09
Okay, have I been using this term wrong all this time? But trying to say is

Unknown Speaker  12:15
using it correctly? It's just incorrect. What

Matthias Miller  12:20
I'm trying to say is that Dwayne needs to leave soon, so we should just jump straight in Pete first into anything that he needs to be around for.

Unknown Speaker  12:31
Okay, well, I agree.

Speaker 6  12:35
We were just talking about you, and I were just looking at, well, I think Dwayne. I think what would be most helpful if you just explain the FGI. You want to talk about the FGI, actual cost thing, right? Sorry, what did you want to talk about? Dwayne?

Speaker 6  13:01
Okay, sorry. Matthias, I wasn't really listening. Why did you? Why did you said, I

Speaker 4  13:07
have I have it. I crossed booked with the sales l 10 meeting at 130 that's why up to 130 so if, if there's something specific I need to be here for, I do have some questions about some sales tax stuff. But other than that, I don't, I don't have anything specific.

Speaker 6  13:26
Okay, we had, we had talked about plan to talk about FDI actual cost today, and how it relates to repo buildings, bringing it back into finished goods, inventory and stuff. But it, I suggest we wait for that until next week. 15 minutes won't do justice to that anyway. And I'd say go ahead with your questions that you have.

Speaker 4  13:55
So the questions I had there was wait, Josh had sent out an email about some overly restrictive messaging around sales tax fields. Seth, you were going to make some changes. Were those made, and we just didn't get an update this weekend, right? So what is supposed to happen going forward

Unknown Speaker  14:17
as far as

Unknown Speaker  14:20
around sales tax validation on the sales order.

Speaker 1  14:27
I mean, you should be able to, we shouldn't be grumpy at you as quickly as we were, but we're still, basically, if you check the ping check box, then it will, it's not going to grump at you that the rate is out of like the jurisdiction rates are out of sync with the total rate. That was one of the problems, I think. But

Speaker 4  14:55
so the last time, okay, thank you. The last time we talked. Had we Matthias? We had talked about doing some sort of fixing of old data with the sales tax percentages. Had we talked about that?

Unknown Speaker  15:15
Or October? I think,

Speaker 4  15:19
not beyond October. Oh, not beyond October. Well, just for the month of October, or like, up to October, month of okay, all right. Well, we'll continue. Just put up with this, this whenever, whenever Josh pushed in those Well, you know, you know the issue we have. We have empty sales tax fields. So anytime we try to open up one of these sales orders to make some sort of a change adjustment, then we get this beautiful red flag error that says this doesn't match with that. And then people get, give me these blank looks and start sending me discord messages.

Matthias Miller  15:58
Well, so, I mean, we, if we need to do wait, those warnings shouldn't be showing up prior to October 1, for any I don't

Speaker 4  16:07
know what the sale I don't know what the date range of the sales orders that that were that I was dealing with. So

Speaker 1  16:12
gonna be sales orders that are created after october 1, or invoice after, or canceled after potentially.

Matthias Miller  16:21
Okay, so simple proposal Seth, could you clear out the system switch, the effective date system switch, and basically turn off the new sales tax, which is going to turn off the warning until we actually have a chance to do the update and loosen the validation? And it's not,

Speaker 4  16:36
it's not the end of the world, because literally, what I have people doing is you put some random numbers in the fields and then hit the ping button and save the sales order. It just re provisions it. If

Unknown Speaker  16:48
you hit the ping, it shouldn't.

Speaker 1  16:52
You shouldn't have to even put numbers in if you hit ping, I don't think, unless it says maybe it says it required,

Speaker 4  16:57
well, it's still, it's it still says it's required. Because I don't think, I don't think we was there an update done with the changes you made.

Speaker 1  17:06
Oh, right, that was part of this stuff I was bringing. Yeah, no, because the last time was update was the, I think, Tuesday, almost a week ago.

Speaker 4  17:16
So you're saying, once we have an update, if you hit the ping button, it doesn't care what's in your Yeah, you

Unknown Speaker  17:23
should be good to go. Got it? Okay, Josh,

Speaker 6  17:26
he's planning to do an update tomorrow night. Is his goal. So,

Speaker 4  17:33
yeah, tell him that's a terrible night to do an update. Don't do it on election night. That's just, I mean, the whole internet might crash tomorrow night for all weekend.

Speaker 6  17:44
Well, Josh usually is not too involved in politics, so he may not realize that

Matthias Miller  17:52
that's a fair point.

Speaker 5  17:57
No everybody will be off having their parties anyway or getting drunk. So

Speaker 4  18:03
if you listen to either party, fire and brimstone is going to rain down tomorrow night. What? Either way it goes. So

Matthias Miller  18:13
you have your bunker built.

Unknown Speaker  18:17
I'll just go into base tomorrow. We'll have to see if that works or not,

Unknown Speaker  18:28
that's all I had

Speaker 6  18:31
so well. So I finally asked Josh these questions I had not on the email I send out. So we this question on pinging tax star as of today, or if it's and he said that's the only He can only ping as of today. He can't ping a historical date. He's not even sure that he could do that. And then he's also going to see what tax jar can give back if an address is knowledge, and then look at, you know, expressing it with any sense you're you had Wayne, you had brought up that if the if there's an address that's not legit, you just get some obscure error message. And so he's going to look at that, making that more useful, making with more

Unknown Speaker  19:21
descriptive or whatever, so

Unknown Speaker  19:22
we know what it's

Unknown Speaker  19:28
all right, let me hit

Speaker 4  19:33
the button, let me hit my microphone, and I'll start talking. Currently, the way it stands is, if you and the configurator, yeah, you get some interesting messaging right now, if you do it on the Sales Order Details screen, you get no messaging. If something's not

Speaker 7  19:49
right, you.

Speaker 4  20:00
Although I did get a strange message on what I did today where I didn't have a state in I didn't have any, I didn't have any, any state or zip coded, and it said a state is required. I would assume, if you're going to do sales, if you're going to validate for at least validate for city

Unknown Speaker  20:23
code in order to push some kind of well, in order for tax charter to have effective information.

Speaker 6  20:32
So you're saying you did get an error message like that where it said you need to have state or did

Unknown Speaker  20:37
he have people say it okay? Yeah, I

Speaker 4  20:40
didn't have anything in the in the addressing. I just done a because I was, I was trying to quick capture a sales order, and it required me to put a state in. But if we're like I said, if we're going to do that, we might as well do the city and state, and that way tax jar has enough information to capture sales tax.

Matthias Miller  20:57
So Seth, when ping is true, require address the address, at least address, one city, state, zip, right.

Speaker 2  21:13
Seems reasonable, but is,

Unknown Speaker  21:33
well, that answers all my sales tax questions mark, so

Speaker 6  21:36
yeah, good and Drew, you're basically waiting for the update and then good.

Unknown Speaker  21:48
So

Speaker 6  21:55
I'd send out, so if we go down to the paper cut projects, number one linking payment transactions to an asset. You want to look at that next? Yeah, so we're moving a lot of buildings from finished goods to an asset. And to do this, we're creating a sales order the building, invoicing it. We then pay for the building with a payment type retain his asset, which moves it out of AR and into the correct asset account. So all of this seems to be working well. Well, go ahead, just read through the notes. I mean, I want to hear your thoughts on how best to handle this. One

Matthias Miller  22:42
of my immediate questions is, is this a one time thing or this is a we're going to keep doing this on an ongoing basis, ongoing

Speaker 6  22:50
it we're doing catch up now, but we're, I mean, it's something we plan to continue at least in two of our counties, ongoing. So what?

Speaker 6  23:20
Helpful Matthias to look at where the on the sales order, where we attempted to do this, and it stomped over the

Matthias Miller  23:28
I mean, it's clear to me what you're trying to do. I'm just trying to think through, Oh, that's easy. Seth, we already have an asset ID for accounting impact.

Unknown Speaker  23:44
So

Unknown Speaker  23:47
I think

Matthias Miller  23:50
here, let me I'm going to going to share my screen and just mock up what I think needs to happen. And we can argue about it,

Unknown Speaker  24:08
so

Unknown Speaker  24:16
that's pretty

Speaker 8  24:20
is, so, here's, here's,

Matthias Miller  24:27
so this is payment method.

Speaker 9  24:36
We were my neighborhood was destroyed, but it wasn't, you know, there were trees all over the things that

Matthias Miller  24:43
need to be clarified, but editable and required if payment method links to asset accounting impact pass in asset ID Station.

Unknown Speaker  25:06
Um, the sky.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
I think you

Matthias Miller  25:19
need to make sure that debit in the we would pass in the asset ID for the now this is so confusing. The credit account is the actual credit account just listed as a so this would be in the debit the debit side of the transaction would be tied to the asset Correct. The debit side of the payment that's

Speaker 6  26:00
correct, the debit side of the payment would be tied would be tied to the asset, yeah,

Matthias Miller  26:09
and this is the the true debit, not the Field debit, anyway, whatever, which will get fixed soon. And then make sure the let's actually, we could actually just check this sales order accounting impact, and let's see if this handles asset ID appropriately, which it does. So that really should be all that's required for accounting impact. So then the question is, on linked assets,

Matthias Miller  26:59
do we want to have any validation about if you link it to an asset, it must apply to the sales order balance. Or do we even care? I'm not even sure if we do. Well,

Speaker 5  27:15
yeah. I mean, I have one that's called Regina. Is asset, and it's, it's, basically, it's, it's creating a payment. And so, you know, we're applying to sales order balance, just like we would a payment, but we're not paying for it with cash. We're just moving it to set account. So I think, I

Matthias Miller  27:39
think we'll let you configure the payment method however you want. I however you want. You can see yourself in the foot by saying it adjusts sales tax liability for bad debt or allows deposit. That's your it's up to you if you want to do

Speaker 5  27:53
that. What I'm wondering is, should there be something that requires a an asset link, like, where you can't your method without the link. I

Unknown Speaker  28:03
mean,

Matthias Miller  28:04
I think just calling it require linked asset or something, yeah, okay. I mean, or just links to asset. For what did I have earlier linked to asset? I think it's just linked to asset. You can only edit it if you have that payment method. You can only assign an asset if it has that, yeah, and it's required, if it does,

Speaker 6  28:29
um, you're saying we would, the payment method would be retain as asset. And then if that's checked, then you have the option to, then you, you so, so you go to pay for this building, you select payment type, retain as asset, and then you you click the check box, link to asset, and

Speaker 5  28:49
you're good to go. No link to asset is on. Is a setting for the retainers asset payment type that's here. Oh, so when they pick retain his asset, it pops up and allows them to edit that asset field can

Speaker 6  29:03
already be you. Just all you have to do is select your asset, right? Oh, good, James,

Unknown Speaker  29:09
asset, and then you pick your

Matthias Miller  29:13
and then we would use the same helper list as vendor invoices, right? Yes. And then accounting impact is just drop dead simple. I mean, sanity check we, I mean, we should probably, I don't know. I mean, you could do, ideally, do a sanity check to make sure it gets pushed all the way to the transaction, but it should, that should be all you need to do.

Matthias Miller  29:57
Okay? I mean, I think it's a simple. Was that?

Unknown Speaker  30:03
No, it makes sense.

Speaker 6  30:16
Alright, man, I think this is, this is probably the top priority here. I mean, it's not urgent. Well, no, it'd be nice to have. I mean, I don't know if it is simple enough that if we could have it by Josh, next update Tuesday night.

Speaker 6  30:38
We're right now. We're we're doing about we're just starting to move to invoice these assets, and then it'd be nice to be able to link them right away. But if, I mean, if it, if we need more time, that's okay.

Speaker 1  30:52
Normally it would be fine. We are right around cut over, which is a busy time for us, just when code moves from development to staging. I don't know how much you know about that, but on the other because you all run out of development, but most systems don't. So we're at a time where the whole code base shifts. It happens like every six weeks. I'm and then I'm traveling tomorrow, so just because of my schedule, I'm not I'll I can try to get it done, but I'm not sure. Okay,

Speaker 6  31:26
if not, then would you be like, What a week or so after that, just or the next I mean,

Speaker 1  31:32
I could the next update. I could easily have it done this week sometime. I just don't know if I can have it done by tomorrow night, sure.

Speaker 5  31:39
I mean, if we can update by middle of next week, we'd still get it on this financials really, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:47
yeah, we like it good,

Matthias Miller  31:56
the discrepancy and depreciation expense. So I thought the easiest way might be to explain how it works, and then if that explains why it's doing what it's doing, then that might be enough. But if not, we can dig in closer. First of all, which is this for shed time,

Speaker 6  32:18
I know now about an hour, but we abandoned that asset so that it should have gotten until after this. But the expense on that is depreciation. Expense, obviously went to zero now.

Matthias Miller  32:39
So the way we work is, I guess, what is the monthly so let's do this. Let me show this.

Speaker 2  32:52
So, purchase, cost,

Speaker 6  32:58
yeah, prior to the abandoning it like an hour ago. It was the depreciation expense was showing 6625 but the transactions were 6667

Matthias Miller  33:11
Okay, let's do this. So we have a $12,000

Unknown Speaker  33:18
purchase cost,

Matthias Miller  33:21
and we have a 15 year we have a 0% salvage value within your useful life. Equals, this equals, oops. Why can I not tie? Why is it not letting me this divided by that's the cost per year, per year, and then this is the divided by 12 support cost per month. So what happens is that let me, let me, let me. Okay, so the first month, it's going to be 66 here. Let me do this equals 12 times 15. This is 180 months. Insert one row above. Okay, so equals so the first, first year, it's first month, it's going to be 6667 and then now the value is this minus this? And now, okay, let's do the this is the

Unknown Speaker  34:28
hang on

Unknown Speaker  34:36
ones so this is then this minus one.

Matthias Miller  34:42
Um, this is the value, rounded depreciation, unrounded depreciation. So this is this divided by oops, equals this divided by one. 180 and this is round this to two decimals, all right, so now, oops,

Matthias Miller  35:17
let's try this. Let's see if we can actually get this out to a point where see if my theory holds up. My theory is that at some point we hit a weird rounding thing. But no, this isn't actually holding up. Yeah, it's gonna get there.

Speaker 1  35:32
But they weren't at that point yet with they weren't even very strong, because it it shifted by 42 cents, which is, which is an awful lot. It wasn't one or two cents.

Unknown Speaker  35:43
1466, 74,

Unknown Speaker  35:58
okay, fair, I

Speaker 6  36:10
I didn't even avoid any if we had the same thing on. I just saw this one. And then, though I might be worth it, let's,

Matthias Miller  36:19
let's go see if,

Speaker 6  36:22
if it makes it easy, we can delete the transaction. I mean, delete that transaction that we did. I wish I wouldn't have done we wouldn't have.

Matthias Miller  36:34
Well, let me see we get the macro to calculate without, without that and, um, okay, so the

Matthias Miller  36:52
so useful months is 159 book value. I'm

Unknown Speaker  37:02
going to guess the book value is all

Matthias Miller  37:08
right, let's just do that. So it says that yesterday's book value,

Unknown Speaker  37:19
1466, 7410, I 10, 533, 26

Unknown Speaker  37:27
Okay.

Matthias Miller  37:32
Asset salvage value should be zero

Speaker 2  37:40
remaining useful months here. Let's do this again. 6625, remaining useful months here. I'm

Matthias Miller  38:15
all right, so book value? It says book value is 10, 105, 3326, which is right? It says the remaining useful months is 159 so that's the basic issue. It's divided by dividing by 159 instead of 158

Matthias Miller  38:40
isn't the fundamental issue here.

Matthias Miller  38:49
I'll bet you, if you wait until December 1, it'll jump back up to 6667 and fix itself.

Speaker 6  39:01
Oh, so if you, if you divide the 10th the book value by whatever remaining month plus 159 there it is, 6625 okay, so what it's doing is in the in the after. So the transaction posts the first, the transactions are correct. But then it goes until the following month, the first. And then it says, it knocks all one month. It says, Now I only have 158 month device.

Matthias Miller  39:37
Well, do you want? Do you want the I the depreciation expense to calculate based on. So one thing that we could do is show next depreciation and then have the date of the first of the next month, so December one and the next depreciate the. Uh or depreciation, next depreciation date, next depreciation amount. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  40:08
It makes sense. I'm just not. Is it worth now that we know how it's doing?

Speaker 5  40:16
Basically it just hangs on to the month, count until the next month rolls around,

Matthias Miller  40:22
right, which is admittedly wrong and confusing.

Speaker 6  40:29
It hangs on to that, but it lowers even though the book it uses the lower book value, I mean it, if it's it's probably something we should put on our paper cut list to fix.

Speaker 2  40:40
Uh, so

Unknown Speaker  40:46
if

Speaker 6  40:48
your proposal of saying next depreciation expense, I like that, because that would say, Okay, let's say the scenario was where we depreciate it this month, and then, or we post the transaction and then say, oh, you know what we and we've done an impairment on this. Or we've short for whatever reason. We've shortened up the the end of life by two years. And then it would, it would calculate what that lesser amount is going to or that greater amount is going to be, or whatever. Yep, and then,

Matthias Miller  41:30
if you pull it up on the first I mean, it would always be the next month, it would assume that

Speaker 6  41:41
most of the time exactly to your to the transact, the depreciation, the previous transactions. But if you make a change to the to the asset, then it would would be different. Would be, this is what's going to be next. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  41:58
yep, and it'll be wrong for four hours between midnight and 4am

Unknown Speaker  42:03
better tighten that up. You know,

Speaker 6  42:07
I had to think of you when, when you're talking about time change, like we were telling our mom that I was telling my mom that we we told her that we changed the clocks already, like in the afternoon and Saturday afternoon. And she said, Well, it doesn't happen until two in the two in the morning. And then we said, well, we're not going to get up change those. Like it is, it is a real thing, depending on what you're calculating and solve for like, like, you basically lose an hour somewhere, or you you gain an

Matthias Miller  42:46
Well, can you imagine being a detective and needing to chase down a crime that happened at 1:30am Sunday morning? Like, which 130 was it? Yeah, and how do you establish the timeline?

Unknown Speaker  43:02
It was the old 131

Matthias Miller  43:05
30. I mean, anyway, okay, so I'm going to pull this out because this was your oops. I didn't want to add to my G drive, but it did. Anyway, okay, so I'm going to hear so. Recap of our findings. We are calculating depreciation as of today's date, even if the current month, if depreciation was recorded for the current month

Unknown Speaker  43:49
proposal or I

Unknown Speaker  44:03
this would be effectively replacing,

Unknown Speaker  44:15
okay, good, good.

Unknown Speaker  44:21
All right, well,

Speaker 6  44:23
we've got, we're halfway through a lot of time, but is there? Do we have anything else that's worth when the switch debits credits, that's going to be live with this next update? Right? Numbers, I

Speaker 1  44:36
haven't worked on that yet. I've been Okay, pretty swamped. Sure.

Speaker 5  44:44
Is that the thing about the dating on the sales invoices, where the payment comes out of customer deposits or AR, like we had these payments. That were after the cancelation date, and then it was just totally skipping those. Is that count? Was that done? Was that coming up on the next thing as well?

Unknown Speaker  45:14
Can't remember what that was.

Speaker 5  45:20
AR issues with solar sales orders number five, is that what it was? And I thought,

Unknown Speaker  45:31
I thought I would have sent an email with what?

Matthias Miller  45:38
Maybe, maybe I replied to that thread. I mean, if it's number five, then I would be surprised if we did,

Unknown Speaker  45:46
right? It's probably not done if that's where,

Speaker 6  45:48
but I expected out last time, right? I mean, yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:53
but not seeing where I sent it,

Unknown Speaker  45:57
well, I think you might have sent it.

Matthias Miller  46:00
They send it to you maybe, yeah, handling payments after cancelation. I see it. Yeah, no, I don't

Unknown Speaker  46:11
think I've done that. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  46:15
yeah, I do have it. I just didn't add it to this. So got it.

Unknown Speaker  46:23
So where we this? Well, COVID. Next

Speaker 6  46:28
time we this was what we were looking at, two, three is what want to cover the Dwayne's on anyone cover that next we? I'd say, Yeah, we could do that next week. So

Speaker 5  46:42
then if we could insert that up here after the depreciation expense. So probably great that way, because we kind of need that there's going to be a bunch of AR stuff hanging on that before that can really be cleaned up, right?

Speaker 6  47:00
Oh, to give me as we get to end of year to get our Er,

Unknown Speaker  47:04
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  47:18
yeah, I don't, I don't have anything else. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  47:23
priorities are linking payment transactions to an asset and then the AR issues?

Unknown Speaker  47:29
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5  47:32
Well, no patient expense thing. Well, in between there or not,

Speaker 6  47:39
I would say that's that should probably go down to the bottom list. I mean, it's just, it's doing all the right things. It's just, if you look at it a little confusing, or that would be my vote, maybe, yeah, I'll just go back to the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  47:53
I would agree.

Speaker 5  47:58
Yeah, yeah. In sales tax. We're just waiting on an update,

Speaker 1  48:02
right, and waiting on Josh to fix pinging stuff. It's not working quite right

Unknown Speaker  48:10
or not consistent. Go ahead. I

Speaker 1  48:16
think that's probably what one of the things he's trying to fix before the next update. I assume he said that's his priority over the next day or two. So

Matthias Miller  48:27
Seth, I would have if, if you have leave five minutes blocked out. Ish, we could see about doing a little bit of the pair programming Blitz, and see if we can get one or both of these knocked out. If you're open to

Unknown Speaker  48:40
that. Yeah, sure, yeah, that would work.

Unknown Speaker  48:44
Okay, good,

Unknown Speaker  48:46
right, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  48:47
Good sign that our meetings are becoming shorter.

Matthias Miller  48:52
It is, yeah, I agree.

Unknown Speaker  48:56
Okay, thanks.
