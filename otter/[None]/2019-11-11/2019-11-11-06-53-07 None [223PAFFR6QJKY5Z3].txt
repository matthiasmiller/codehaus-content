So one of the questions surrounding this whole thing of strength and what types of people do you attract?

Matthias Miller  00:24
That's a really interesting question because it feels like probably one of the best things would be to evaluate the people on my mailing list. And what are these types of people? There's Jason Evie who's or Eb views really taken an interest in starting his own business. There is what else? You know Craig has definitely been in there. Chris Cohen to a degree, Brad Roland To a degree

Unknown Speaker  01:02
these guys don't really know that part of me

Unknown Speaker  01:14
and

Unknown Speaker  01:17
I think what else

Unknown Speaker  01:26
so Ricky's another one,

Unknown Speaker  01:28
recent one.

Unknown Speaker  01:34
There's Who else is there?

Speaker 1  01:48
thinking what else feels to me like the numbers really small. That's the crazy thing. Melvin Melvin is an interesting one

Unknown Speaker  01:59
dude from Ohio

Unknown Speaker  02:10
Bruce, although I think that's more the inverse direction,

Unknown Speaker  02:15
Reggie, that I really wish I understood that

Speaker 1  02:21
doesn't feel like people actually coming to me asking my advice, which is really interesting. Why is that?

Unknown Speaker  02:28
That would be really interesting to know.

Unknown Speaker  02:36
People don't you be having answers?

Unknown Speaker  02:43
Was that true or false?

Unknown Speaker  02:50
Let's frame it differently. People are too busy to ask.

Speaker 1  03:51
So maybe part of it is there's this expectation that people should come to me for advice and those are the people that I should be serving. That may not actually be true

Unknown Speaker  04:00
Aaron Reek sector.

Speaker 1  04:04
I guess one of the questions is is this more telling about them or is it more telling you about me? Aaron stole swoose that we got a lot of positive feedback from the newsletter, getting green room with the newsletter.

Speaker 1  05:24
Another question might be if I just intimidate people because I keep a lot of my thoughts to myself. I mean, I probably share them
