Unknown Speaker  05:39
Bienvenidos

Speaker 1  05:40
don't talk to me about running ragged. I've been running ragged for weeks.

Unknown Speaker  05:49
My wife this morning pulled out her planner

Matthias Miller  05:56
Hello, my face and said you didn't schedule anything for today, did you? I was like, What did I forget? And she's like, you told me you were taking a mental health day. And I'm gonna hold you accountable and you're gonna tell me what you did.

Unknown Speaker  06:10
I'm like, Okay,

Matthias Miller  06:12
I eat, you

Unknown Speaker  06:14
will be each other's therapist, and we'll call that a mental health day.

Matthias Miller  06:18
Although you said that,

Unknown Speaker  06:21
to which to which she will probably roll her eyes.

Unknown Speaker  06:26
She will still be like, That doesn't count. Man.

Speaker 1  06:33
I want to know, I want to know why it is that over the wintertime.

Speaker 2  06:41
Like the stress level comes down to manageable, right? And then as soon as we get into, you know, selling buildings and springtime, like, everything goes on steroids. And it's like, well, like, just because you guys are building buildings like mad and hauling buildings like that doesn't mean everything else has to be on mad. But like everything else is everything becomes like at a frenetic face at pace, and

Matthias Miller  07:10
Wayne cracks me up the most. Because when you hear something from him, you think it should have deployed. I just had this idea I told you about it. Why did this happen yesterday?

Unknown Speaker  07:24
What? What?

Matthias Miller  07:27
Wait, Wayne cracks me up. I'm learning more and more like how he operates and how to work with him. But he comes up with this latest latest said, first of all, why are we Why do we have all these shiny objects? And he shows up with the meeting was like, alright, we need to put these these three things in the landing page. And, and it's always like, it's always like, Oh, this will be a simple thing. And why wasn't it done yesterday? Almost. We're just fine.

Unknown Speaker  07:54
Welcome to my life.

Speaker 2  07:58
As someone as someone wants very, very succinctly put from their side, what you can just push a few buttons

Unknown Speaker  08:05
and

Unknown Speaker  08:08
make it happen, right?

Matthias Miller  08:11
Yeah. Well, you know, one of the things I've tried to do is set expectations about what goes gets done when. And one of the things I actually should schedule for next week is a day off.

Unknown Speaker  08:23
Or I am disconnected from the office. Or you can just

Speaker 2  08:26
do what I do at Leanne, and I do and that has been run. We run like crazy. And then one day Hey, by the way, we're going to be in Europe for two weeks. You're good luck. Bye. Good luck.

Matthias Miller  08:38
Hey, can you call Dwayne and see about this? No, I can't.

Speaker 2  08:42
Alright, I did I tell you about last year when we were in Italy for Addison's. For his senior trip, I'm in I forget what little town along the chin Cutera five lands along the coast of Italy. And my phone rings my three CX rings. And it was Wayne. And I'm like, for the for the kicks of it. I'm gonna answer this. Like, it's like eight o'clock at night. You know, I'm walking down the street hunting for a restaurant to go eat some pasta. And I'm like,

Speaker 3  09:12
hello. It was funny. He's like, Ah, I was just gonna leave a message and as I well, I am you know

Matthias Miller  09:26
I'm gonna take this chance to rub in what I'm doing and you're not know

Speaker 2  09:30
and that's when that's when my I have Marvel a bit. Like we use technology every single day. But the fact that I can be halfway around the world and my three CX rings on my cell phone.

Matthias Miller  09:42
It's crazy. It's crazy.

Speaker 2  09:49
Okay, gi stuff or not FGI stuff. Or what are we talking about?

Matthias Miller  09:54
Accessories, accessories, I have the answer to your accessory problems. Okay, it's your accessory problems.

Speaker 1  10:00
Huh, I said as Jasmine, I like it. Oh, love it. Okay.

Matthias Miller  10:06
So, however, they want to categorize their

Unknown Speaker  10:12
accessories. I don't know how

Matthias Miller  10:15
whatever marks categorization is, we add a when you add an accessory, you have to pick from a list of which category this falls into. And you have freeform text for the rest of it. Okay, let's see. I

Speaker 2  10:26
don't understand why. Okay. Okay, first question, whose idea? Was it to go completely rigid with all listed accounts are listed items? Was that yours? Or Josh's?

Matthias Miller  10:37
Not so we had talked about it, have you not? Huh?

Unknown Speaker  10:43
Okay, so I don't know.

Matthias Miller  10:44
It might have been mine. But I thought we you and I had talked about this

Unknown Speaker  10:46
maybe we didn't, what don't you like about it?

Speaker 2  10:54
I'm afraid we're going to end up with a list that's a mile long, because there's always going to be something.

Unknown Speaker  11:02
And so

Speaker 2  11:06
granted, I mean, I went look through your through the list of of accessory items across the gears, and it's like, but it's like this, this is what I'm afraid of, hey, dealer support says, Hey, dealer, or dealer says, Hey, dealer support. I want to sell some chickens. Okay, we'll put chickens in. I want to sell, you know, a gravel plastic grid base. Okay, so we put that our Oh, so Grabow metal grid, basically what that is, it's like, eventually the list is going to be a mile long and it's just going to be obnoxious.

Unknown Speaker  11:35
So

Unknown Speaker  11:43
do you know

Matthias Miller  11:44
how how Mark is planning to categorize accessories?

Unknown Speaker  11:52
No.

Matthias Miller  11:53
Do you I haven't jumped on the call. So you can tell us

Unknown Speaker  11:55
or no? Well,

Unknown Speaker  12:01
not necessarily. It'll, it'll make it twice as long.

Unknown Speaker  12:06
Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  12:08
I mean, but the bottom line is, if you don't specifically tell people how to categorize it, then somebody on the back end is, oh, chickens. Ha, where's your chickens go on the profit and loss statement. or somebody's gonna have to review these things, or something.

Unknown Speaker  12:25
Like you can't just

Matthias Miller  12:30
and then if we don't know where they're categorized, I guess there's a catch all account that we think it's there and then we'll fix it the profit loss if it's when we get those changes, which is fine. If we will know from him what the categories of how he he's planning to categorize and break apart the accessories it would

Speaker 2  12:49
let me ask you a question. If you go into QuickBooks or Eagle business, whatever and you create an invoice they you don't ever specify necessarily what GL account then like where that stuff's going to specify

Unknown Speaker  13:05
sales I would have specifies that

Unknown Speaker  13:09
because you create a sales item

Matthias Miller  13:17
which means we're back to creating your accessory tags for them to choose from. So hey, we need to code for live animals

Speaker 4  13:25
well, can you kill the chickens first column decor?

Speaker 1  13:29
Do you have a way do you have a way to

Speaker 2  13:37
write an expression that looks at assessories and says these guys are of 85% match and see how many categories What

Unknown Speaker  13:55
are you ready to see some magic are like welcome do the magic show. We are going to have a magic show

Unknown Speaker  14:05
okay oreilles new

Speaker 2  14:11
sales orders important I'm really curious like if we were to get really I don't

Unknown Speaker  14:18
know least

Speaker 4  14:29
Oh exists sorry. On Z says already exists. Sorry. Really horrible accent

Unknown Speaker  14:38
it's a really bad Italian accent

Unknown Speaker  14:45
repeat list item.

Matthias Miller  14:50
Boy, boy.

Speaker 3  14:52
Now we've known you know Jr. Jeff Dunn Dunham is I don't so he's is he's this ventriloquist on. I don't know. But anyway, I watched a bunch of his, but you sound a little bit like his one character called Jose jalapeno on a stick.

Matthias Miller  15:14
That's awesome. That reminds me

Unknown Speaker  15:17
of Oh, who is this guy?

Matthias Miller  15:21
The app that was epic guy, his his Hispanic persona. He's got one where he writes love from the hood love, love poems to rent for random state strangers reads about random strangers strangers.

Speaker 4  15:38
Anyway, absolute insanity. Okay. So fun stuff, model group. Subsidy expression as a person, well just

Matthias Miller  15:49
look like it's my fault. Why do you not validate models? Before I get out of there? Like, would you please just validate it here? It would be really awesome. I should probably write that up. But okay, so what we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  16:03
many, how many of the Okay,

Matthias Miller  16:06
we have 1141. That's it. I mean, it's not that

Unknown Speaker  16:10
bad. It's just as a one. Okay.

Matthias Miller  16:13
So then we're going to do,

Speaker 2  16:15
can we can we pare it down? Can we pare it down to 10. If we can pare it down to Okay, I'd say 15. If we can get it down to 15 categories. I can go for I can go for this idea.

Speaker 4  16:29
Okay, so let's do list filter. This guy. Strike and strike.

Unknown Speaker  16:40
Strike a match. What is the

Speaker 4  16:44
strike? Macro? Sorry, it's an old one. Okay, we have a proc string match

Speaker 4  16:58
current item, P list item.

Matthias Miller  17:03
And then we're going to try the demo on limits Levenstein because I think it's better and I can't remember.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
I can't remember the factors if it's one or 100. So Bill Bob That's 25 Bill billing 75 Okay, it's 100

Matthias Miller  17:31
So you said less than or greater than or equal to 80?

Unknown Speaker  17:38
Sure. Okay, so let's do this

Unknown Speaker  18:00
and then let's do let's do grouping by

Unknown Speaker  18:24
it's gonna be slower for

Unknown Speaker  18:27
okay, we only have to answer this question a few times. Exactly.

Matthias Miller  18:43
The problem is which one of these do you choose

Unknown Speaker  18:58
so let's do let's not let's just take this out. No. Let's just go look at this thing. Okay, so we've got single double door magnets how would you do this?

Unknown Speaker  19:30
Well, we can do this

Matthias Miller  19:57
these are the ones with the most common

Speaker 2  20:02
yeah it's like ramps site preps block packages or leveling

Unknown Speaker  20:09
kits windows but why would

Unknown Speaker  20:13
why would you put windows in accessory I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  20:20
Extra anchors

Speaker 2  20:36
This is what scares me to death. Okay, the moment you say let's Let's hypothetically say extra

Unknown Speaker  20:44
anchors how many if there's no way to define

Speaker 2  20:48
that what the driver sees that and says oh, they want extra anchors he goes out there with a whole box will extra anchors do we charge enough like without without being okay so site prep okay what if we want an extra site prep for another building they're buying or it's the moment you define this stuff it gets so sticky

Unknown Speaker  21:22
yeah and then there's

Matthias Miller  21:23
just random stuff chicken door ceiling like custom bar

Speaker 4  21:29
custom flipped door edge gold whatever that is don't know free solar light heads gold is blowing two gallons two gallons well somebody's getting high sorry, Wednesday snark. OSB permit fees price match

Matthias Miller  22:00
I mean but but how how like

Matthias Miller  22:08
we we

Unknown Speaker  22:09
try to find all ramps

Matthias Miller  22:12
and all site prep and all leveling kits and all blocks

Speaker 2  22:15
Okay, so the dealer says let's just say we had an item called poly ramps how many

Unknown Speaker  22:25
well do we need to have a size a number? Do accessories need a quantity now? Well,

Speaker 2  22:36
I mean, if you want it to be if you want it to be real precise, well then then then we really should do an item and it should be and it should be it should now now that now the accessory record needs a price and a unit of measure and and and now we're just like we're we're going to end up

Unknown Speaker  22:57
good. You have a category

Matthias Miller  23:01
and then you just have a label that says please include size and quantity and any additional

Speaker 4  23:06
details and they have to put something in there for all of these so for example let's do this. If yes is let's do list filter concat we're gonna do site prep let's do this

Unknown Speaker  23:35
site prep ramps

Unknown Speaker  23:43
Windows Door Window Door yep

Unknown Speaker  23:47
magnets

Unknown Speaker  24:08
Yeah, let's kill this sword. We

Matthias Miller  24:09
don't need the sword anymore and that's gonna make it fast. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  24:11
so your doors magnets leveling kit, lacking add love package

Unknown Speaker  24:51
leveling

Speaker 2  24:51
loving peer kit, leveling peer kit

Matthias Miller  24:58
leveling You're a kid with an H add remove and also March 20

Speaker 2  25:04
Tie Downs Oh go back and add go back and add anchors man this is like

Unknown Speaker  25:18
there's just a whole

Unknown Speaker  25:18
bunch of stuff in there that never needed to be in there

Unknown Speaker  25:20
and build on site sure edge anchor

Unknown Speaker  25:28
yeah let's at anchor

Speaker 4  25:41
shed removal or blink

Unknown Speaker  26:00
wash removal

Matthias Miller  26:01
when kit can't spell white building yeah and then this stuff is all the

Unknown Speaker  26:11
really weird nobody knows what they are.

Unknown Speaker  26:58
Porch

Speaker 2  27:00
Okay, actually, let's do this exclude go back and exclude anything with it. Are we on this? What level are we on? What level were you on? A building exclude any sales orders created before? before January 1 2022.

Unknown Speaker  27:22
Wow digs down 112

Unknown Speaker  27:29
Okay, what's all what is there? Wow, what the world?

Unknown Speaker  27:34
Your kid put a building into the assessories

Unknown Speaker  27:41
to frame it,

Speaker 2  27:42
or eight by sevens? Eight by sevens what to frame I guess it was openings for eight by seven garage door

Speaker 1  27:50
I don't know. closure strips credit.

Unknown Speaker  27:57
Just to match Calvin's repair. I love that one. We just had to fix them up.

Speaker 2  28:02
Yep. Custom vinyl siding. Why would we charge for custom vinyl siding?

Matthias Miller  28:08
Who knows? Delivery that one could be

Speaker 2  28:12
that one's really should never be there that's alright let's try let's try again go exclude before July 2020 To

Unknown Speaker  28:30
wait a minute to get more

Unknown Speaker  28:38
did it backwards? Really did it backwards. We got a lot of

Matthias Miller  28:45
stuff coming in after January 1 2022 And not a lot before let me guess sometime we opened it up in the lab for free form or something?

Speaker 2  28:53
I don't know. All right, well go back and do it just this year let's do January 1 2325.

Unknown Speaker  29:15
Shed removal

Matthias Miller  29:18
joists so prep. Why building something about

Unknown Speaker  29:23
why is Yeah 16 wide?

Speaker 2  29:27
Yeah, they've been they've been Ohio has been doing all kinds of to story and all kinds of stuff and that's where it's gonna get real sticky.

Matthias Miller  29:41
Well, I mean, I have no problem just leaving it freeform. If somebody wants to feel these.

Speaker 2  29:45
Oh goodness, you mean like evaluate every single sales order and find a GM just define a GL account.

Speaker 4  29:52
Yeah, somebody can manually do it can be their job. What's your purpose?

Speaker 2  29:56
Essentially you would add every accessory line item has GL account and you just go along and go every every sales order that comes in today. A sign this this and this and this and this

Unknown Speaker  30:07
yep whoo

Speaker 2  30:09
whoo All right now is the time. Now is the time to get marked on.

Matthias Miller  30:18
SG I like this one sgbs VSDB yeah that's cool had one of those

Unknown Speaker  30:29
does he have your code house?

Unknown Speaker  30:31
Phone number?

Matthias Miller  30:32
Yeah, it's the same number from earlier today yeah

Speaker 2  30:50
mr. Can you you want to call into the code house? Sure. Zoom. Phone number thing. We're we're way down the rabbit hole. I need your help.

Unknown Speaker  31:04
I usually make it worse. But I'll try.

Unknown Speaker  31:06
Alright, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  31:11
That was funny. That was funny.

Speaker 3  31:18
You have to get you have to give one thing he is self aware.

Unknown Speaker  31:24
Yeah, he's aware.

Unknown Speaker  31:46
Welcome to the rabbit hole mark.

Unknown Speaker  31:51
Sounds interesting.

Speaker 2  31:53
We started, we started modeling and categorizing and trying to gain some quantification of a sales order assessories only if you categorize sales order assessories from the beginning of the year, there's 471. And then, you know, how many how many lists? Are you able to tell me Matthias how many list groups we have?

Matthias Miller  32:19
We've we've come up with 23456789 groups right now

Speaker 2  32:26
nine groups and how many are current? How many? How many are currently in the well do that do this add a one and then summit so we can see per per?

Unknown Speaker  32:37
Sure. Total at the top? What's our na

Matthias Miller  32:48
three 316 that just kind of don't fall in any bucket that we've come up with yet.

Speaker 2  32:56
And here's here's the little pain point mark is with the advent of 16 wide buildings and two storey buildings so much stuff is being dumped into assessories because we don't have building items for it or we haven't figured out a way to do it well yet. And so my head just wants to upload

Speaker 2  33:22
so here's here's an idea that Matthias had and this is this kind of goes harkens to an idea that you had earlier today is that rather than trying to make records out of these things, we add a GL account our G line to the sales order and it's just somebody's job every day to go and categorize accessory items on every single sales order

Unknown Speaker  33:46
there there's a

Speaker 5  33:50
time to do that isn't prohibitive I mean if if we have tons and tons of sales we're happy to do that and I anytime you talk with something with Larry about anything like this, he says well I like sales That's what gets me paid but don't use salespeople for something like this because they're not typically not

Unknown Speaker  34:27
I think that's a good idea.

Speaker 2  34:29
So are Messiah so it let's just hypothetically say you added an RG and we

Unknown Speaker  34:37
we would

Speaker 2  34:39
build a report that exposes accessory items and we just this thing goes out every single day to someone say an insights office they send it all back with update these to this and you just make it an A A editable screen report. You just go down through and click click click click click

Matthias Miller  35:06
and the list of GL accounts is linked to

Unknown Speaker  35:12
the

Matthias Miller  35:14
district of the dealer right

Speaker 2  35:21
think about that so you would do it but you probably have to do it by district and it'd be linked to GL accounts with the with the it'd be income accounts

Matthias Miller  35:31
it can be whatever I don't

Speaker 2  35:34
know but it would there be a way through the GL account list down to like you're not scrolling through a you know whole chart of accounts to find the ones you want

Matthias Miller  35:43
we can have a short list on the financial allocation of these are the these are the GL accounts that should be available for accessories and just filter it down by that

Speaker 2  35:58
Messiah is take this report and filter by district X yet so that that you're not you're not you're bringing in SDI stuff

Matthias Miller  36:13
well except it's it's really this because you want sales orders for that's pretty technical, but you want sales orders or building moves as well. Again to categorize those

Unknown Speaker  36:30
sales orders for what type of type of buildings

Matthias Miller  36:34
we want sales orders that are not tied to a building so here it should be not so quote and not so canceled or is cancelled and it's not a nondistrict X building which is really which is either non well let's just do this is in a building Stan so building Stan or

Unknown Speaker  37:03
it's a district X

Matthias Miller  37:09
district X building district X buildings won't hit sorry, strike buildings won't hit accounting

Unknown Speaker  37:19
Yeah, they will.

Matthias Miller  37:22
On the on the sales order as well.

Unknown Speaker  37:24
We're not populating so much of this stuff.

Speaker 5  37:28
No, and I think for them we'll just we'll just be one lump sum like it's just a building sale maybe that and discounts but that's about the extent of Well, we do have build on sites for them

Unknown Speaker  37:56
how would you do that you'd have to have some type of mapping

Matthias Miller  38:03
Yeah, I was not planning to treat district x sorry

Unknown Speaker  38:07
sheds direct separately

Speaker 5  38:12
Well, I have to wait we from an accounting perspective we want to treat them same

Speaker 5  38:32
so what are you going to show on this report, I think it would be helpful it could be helpful to show something similar to the the accounts payable verification report where there we show every invoice and then show it broken down buy for every

Unknown Speaker  39:01
you hear it thinking

Speaker 2  39:03
I was in I was envisioning it would only be sales orders with accessory items. Although so Matthias is with Josh absolutely hate us if we did if we did have like, we went ahead and quantified let's say 10 or 15 categories of items that are that are showing up over and over again. We have an other category that creates a note section that you can say what it is you fill in the dollar value and then we build a report that goes out to insight that says here's all sales orders that have an accessory item of other please tell me what GL account to assign to it.

Matthias Miller  39:43
Okay, do do the categories have have dimensions and prices and quantities? No.

Speaker 2  39:50
Like a block, a block leveling package, fine. It's three set whatever it is like or gravel grid base or you know, or I guess that would fall under site prep or

Speaker 5  40:07
from that perspective, Dwayne, I mean, I liked that, that thought that idea. I'm just how do you? How do you, we're relying on salespeople to consistently select the right thing, then? Well, yeah, to simplify it, so that we can so that that can be done consistently.

Speaker 2  40:32
I mean, part of me saying says, Leave it freeform report of sales orders goes out every single day. And it has, you know, a column to write in the GL account, you send it back to somebody here in my office, you know, just updates all those GL accounts. And it's like, it's completely manual, and it's probably cumbersome, but at least at least we can get it I guess, right?

Speaker 5  41:04
Well, I would be tempted to get okay, we're already doing accounts payable, we're going through the pain seek a very manual process, there was a lot of work tying all that together, we have a lot more. Quantity wise, we have a lot more Invoices to Pay, then we have sales orders coming in, I would be my preference would be starting out, we don't we just show every single day we show whoever's doing the classifications gets a list of all sales orders from the previous day. listing out all at least starting out, we get a list of all sales orders from the previous day. What their default classifications are, like, say a building with a an accessory item, it says something like building and standard options. Whatever that call GL account is that we set up based on rules, then we'll have accessory items and others won't. And we'll just that way starting out, we'll be reviewing all of all of them. And then I would expect at some point we can. Okay, now let's exclude from this report. Let's only show the ones that have s ri items or miscellaneous accessory items.

Speaker 5  42:45
Part of it would just be terrifying and working out the books as we start with this. What What are your thoughts on that? Just just basically listing everything

Speaker 2  43:01
because what if what if, instead of of making instead of making records, we say I don't know. Maybe it's a field of expressions where you say if it's site prep, and always like if the words is found of site prep, then always assign this GL defaulted to this GL account if it's this default to this. And then, you know, basically you have a list of rules that that come in. And if they use certain words, we defaulted to certain things. It goes out and insight says yep, yep, yep, yep, no changes to this and that, like, we can start defaulting a bunch of this stuff halfway correctly.

Matthias Miller  43:43
Yeah, we actually could.

Unknown Speaker  43:49
I kinda like it.

Speaker 2  43:53
Like, if you mentioned the word anchors, if you mentioned, you know, site prep or shed removal or etcetera, etcetera, like, we could, like, if you give if you give me access to some of this, like literally start just including words on some of the default eight defaulting stuff. And it's like, eventually we'll have a defaulting list of words that's going to start getting I would think somewhere in the 50% accuracy to 60% accuracy rate, you know, rating, give or take.

Matthias Miller  44:26
So, we're seeing here

Unknown Speaker  44:29
we're getting about

Matthias Miller  44:33
a third of them with us playing around a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
But other stuff like well, building moves,

Matthias Miller  44:47
redelivery removal That's seems to be your here's what I wanted to do. Yeah, let me let me check. I want to add one more thing to this report, which is Um

Matthias Miller  45:19
if we would do model group value this

Unknown Speaker  45:22
of

Matthias Miller  45:40
we reverse sorted by that promotion. That's an obvious one. Promotion gets you?

Unknown Speaker  46:01
As many as one.

Matthias Miller  46:08
Why was that then? Why? No, because that's not No, no, it's not one, Dwayne it's if you want to take a look at number of usages motion is 156 sales instances

Unknown Speaker  46:24
that it finds the word counterfeit six times? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
I'm curious how many, like, how many sales do we show for year?

Unknown Speaker  46:42
Never mind if you don't have it in front of you.

Speaker 2  46:44
We're currently counting accessory items, not sales orders.

Matthias Miller  46:49
Right? It's 3030 100 accessory items.

Unknown Speaker  46:53
And that's just what's in the beginning of the year, right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:04
Doing another way we could do this is lit. This would really be a good, okay, set up shipping. I mean, there's, there's a bunch here at the top of the list that would get another see these are us 100, under 60. If we took another 160 of these, that we could default, then that would take us down to 306 minus 160 out of 472. I think reasonably we could get 60 to 70% of them defaulted reasonably well.

Unknown Speaker  47:56
So we could

Speaker 2  47:59
and you're saying we write rules based on work common words that are being used and default them to to the correct GL accounts. And then we just push that thing out. And someone inside Office can say yep, we agree with that or no change it to this and it just comes back and you update the ones they say

Unknown Speaker  48:21
yeah

Speaker 5  48:30
I like it. I think that's a reasonable path forward. Now. Did it make sense? What? Why I guess it I think it would be quite helpful to include show everything on that report. Including like the building itself and accessory below because I'm concerned if you're only looking at the accessory and you don't see what building it's for, you won't be able to see is it connected to a building? Is it is it a standalone build order four by fours or whatever it is. That would be helpful information to know when you're going through that list.

Matthias Miller  49:20
Duane is that just the building code description?

Speaker 2  49:25
Sorry, I was texting something to Leanne sorry, said again.

Matthias Miller  49:31
Yeah, this sort of showing them

Unknown Speaker  49:33
yeah

Unknown Speaker  49:43
well, that I mean,

Speaker 2  49:48
I kind of like approaching it from that manner because we leave it freeform yet we have automation that's defining a lot of this and at some point, we should be able to get fair really accurate? I mean, at some point? Well, okay, then then it begs the question like, Should we just go off and make those categories into? I don't know, I like this idea. Once Once we've used it for a year, then we'll say, All right, now we know how we actually want to go do this. Yeah.

Speaker 5  50:25
And it gives us what what we typically ask for lots of flexibility, unlimited flexibility with infinite details.

Unknown Speaker  50:39
My

Matthias Miller  50:41
mid year Christmas gift to you.

Matthias Miller  50:48
So thinking, if I can just break this down tactically a little bit how this works? Okay, what can we have a default GL account that things go into until the accessories are categorized? Well, it would just go into the building income account? And so it's

Speaker 2  51:03
yeah, why wouldn't? That's what I was gonna say whatever the sales order is defaulted to

Matthias Miller  51:08
that fine with you, Mark?

Speaker 5  51:13
Not sure. Okay. The one part of me says, Well, yeah, most of the time, that's what it what it's going to be. The other part of me says, are those that we don't have, you know, that don't match your keywords or that don't match our criteria that we're writing for? Are those situations that just leave them blank? Otherwise, we'll be too apt to just whoever's doing that, that just missed. missed them. So.

Unknown Speaker  51:52
But what,

Speaker 2  51:54
what what happens to the, what happens from a trance transactional status if it's blank?

Speaker 5  52:02
Well, okay, that's a good question. When? When, okay, so break it down to timing? When are we defining this? And when do we need it in accounting? My thoughts go like this, that you don't need to know about accounting until the sale happens or the shed, taking the when the shed is delivered, because that's when it will first hit a revenue account. But when you have

Speaker 2  52:43
and that, that'll give us anywhere from a couple days to two weeks.

Speaker 5  52:51
So yeah, so when are we going to push that this report out? Will it be when the sale happens when we write up the order, because there's if we do it? Let's take this scenario, customer comes customer orders as yet today, the sales order submitted, and it shows up the next morning. And then we do our classifications, then it two weeks later, it's delivered. And we've got plenty of time. That's all works. Well. The downside to doing it that early is what if they change something on their order between then and when the shed is delivered? Man, it's already been through this process. I haven't. I think you've thought about this more than I have Messiah's as far as timing. So what are your thoughts?

Matthias Miller  53:54
Well, my instinct in that case is we already locked buildings or lock things down three days isn't it something like three days before build?

Unknown Speaker  54:10
Up don't know, is that where

Speaker 2  54:10
what we're doing now? Yeah, but you have you have yet to find you. You have yet. You have yet to have a trigger that actually has my people locked down at some way.

Matthias Miller  54:23
Well, here's what we can do. We have a Needs Review checkbox on the accessory. And anytime you modify the accessory description, then it's going to trigger a Needs Review. Simple and if somebody modifies it, it'll just throw it back and show back up on the review report. Hidden well read only except for picks up by the accounting team.

Speaker 2  54:49
Well, okay, but no, but I'm saying okay, so how if the accessory RG is edited, and it automatically triggers a Needs Review checkbox How does it get taken off? When you update the RG? Like for the first time, like what takes it off?

Matthias Miller  55:05
Setting up? A either clicking what I'm envisioning. Okay, let me break this down. On the accessory. RG, we have accessory name, accessory price and accessory notes. And then we have a new column GL account. And I'm actually going to flip this around and GL Account approved as a checkbox. And so when it gets created will default the account but it's not approved. And if you change the description, we'll we'll update the GL account to the default account and uncheck it approved. And then through the approval process you go through. And if if the moment you check approved, then GL account is required. And you just go through and if it's the default, you click approved, approved, approved, approved, and then if you need to switch it out, you switch it to something else. And I think at that point, when you select something else, I don't really feel strongly, but when you select something else, we would automatically flag it as approved at that point

Unknown Speaker  56:20
do you think

Unknown Speaker  56:28
you're asking me or Dwayne?

Matthias Miller  56:31
Neither one of you, Dwayne, I think but

Unknown Speaker  56:44
yeah, I mean

Speaker 2  57:07
I mean, at some point, we're just going to have to probably be okay with that we're not going to get 100% every, like, every it's not going to be that there's going to be some stuff that gets get miscategorized it's going to happen. But, I mean, what's our acceptance rate? 95% I mean, there's a 5% chance or 5% of times that something's gonna go squirrely in this process, but I guess if you get 95% right, then that's a whole lot better than 40

Unknown Speaker  57:37
But where

Matthias Miller  57:39
where's the room to for it to go squirrely?

Unknown Speaker  57:49
I'm gonna I'm gonna read

Speaker 2  57:50
what you're writing and then maybe, maybe it said I conceptualized it funky in my head

Speaker 2  58:16
so I could I could get into this, I could, I could, I could get on board with this. If the checkbox for approved is actually hidden, it only exposes through the review report. So you can't actually like mess it up if you're if if you if you go and add an accessory item to a sales order from the admin side. Automatically the checkbox is like you can't update it from there it has to be updated from

Unknown Speaker  58:44
the review report.

Matthias Miller  58:48
Done Request granted

Speaker 2  58:54
and then that way it goes out and has to come back before you can actually update that thing

Matthias Miller  59:06
and the GL account would also be showing the GL account also read only in the detail screen now.

Unknown Speaker  59:12
Now the GL Account find that although

Matthias Miller  59:15
okay, but if you set the GL account do you want them to manually check the approved checkbox when they're putting this stuff in?

Unknown Speaker  59:26
I mean, how else would you do it?

Matthias Miller  59:29
I mean you can if they select the GL account you can autumn auto market as approved. It's just a question Do you want the extra step I'm fine with the extra step.

Matthias Miller  59:49
It's fine and an extra step. It's probably better. I mean, it's probably

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
Yeah, let's leave, let's leave

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
it as the extra step.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
A little on them.

Matthias Miller  1:00:18
Okay, so if you change it in the detail screen, should it clear the approved checkbox? Yeah, of course, it did go out again, yes?

Matthias Miller  1:00:38
Well, you can always clear the approved checkbox. And so but people would would update the account first and then Mark approved.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
Got it? I like it.

Speaker 5  1:00:57
So does this mean that that sales transactions, these transactions cannot hit in that impact accounting, then until the GL account has been approved?

Matthias Miller  1:01:14
Well, that's up to you, I kind of hesitate to exclude them, I would rather have a I would rather have a someplace that we can put on approved GL items rather than completely keeping them out of accounting. So

Speaker 2  1:01:36
part of me wants to say, Okay, if if I was to wave the magic wand on this, whoever is whoever is Mark's assistant in accounting, like, whoever updates GL accounts and approves them should not be in the same seat as saying doing dealer support and actually making changes to sales orders. So in other words, whoever's marks assistant for doing all this stuff inside of assist, that should be the person who approves and updates GL accounts, it should not be done inside of my office. So and then what part of me wants to suggest then that GL accounts and the Approval button is read only from the detail screen always, like it always has to be done through that report? And maybe it's like it, maybe it's over on accounting land, like so that we can actually exclude my people from ever seeing it?

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
Well, it's, yeah, we can do that. Let's just hide it in the visa detail screen. And it's completely completely out and then make it accessible in the report I'm fine with. I mean, we can do whatever.

Speaker 2  1:02:48
Because here's, here's what I'm a little bit that worries me a little bit,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
is,

Speaker 2  1:02:53
here's what I'm the scenario a little bit concerned about. So this shows up now on sales order assessories. And you got people in my office, they go add new accessory item. And it's like, well, what do I set the GL account to? And so that's the part where I'm talking about things going squirrely, if like, if they don't know, there's GL accounts tied to this RG, and it's done by someone that's not in dealer support, like is dedicated for that, that way out of the hands of people that, you know, I want them making changes, but I don't want them necessarily approving GL accounts. Does that make sense?

Matthias Miller  1:03:28
Yes, I will have it we use we have these can view FTI and, and can edit FGI? Why don't we just use those permissions to control it, visibility and editability. But then then marks assistant can go in into the detail screen if they if they need to, unless

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
I'm fine with that.

Speaker 5  1:03:55
Messiah Matthias Your thought is, well, as far as impacting accounting. Your thought was, they will impact accounting. Whenever you know, the event happens that I think you're the plan is to update accounting entries every day. So the end of every day it would update all these transactions regardless of whether the GL account had been approved or not. And what could happen is if we get to the end of the month, if we do that is we will look at our financials and demand and we're a day behind on the approval process. Then we go through and move those some of them move from one GL account to the other. And things report from one day to the next would shift just slightly I mean we probably what would happen is income would move from from One minute would move from one revenue account to the other. Yeah, probably minor but I mean I think that's that's reasonable in the right approach because the alternative to blocking them to keeping them out excluding them from financials until they're approved is much worse I think because potentially you have $80,000 worth that have not been approved then numbers will look funky by by going the first route including them all be there they just might not be the exact spots just yet

Matthias Miller  1:05:51
right well then it's only sorry we're only in those very rare situations where somebody changes it right before either right before on or or soon after delivery. And so the scenario of it happening is actually really narrow

Speaker 5  1:06:19
that's probably a bad idea part of me thinks we should almost wait to wait to do the approval process until the sale actually happens. And then we won't have potential for all these revisions to go through because we're they're all going to have yellow count might not be exactly right. It seems to me like it could be we could potentially save ourselves a lot of work if we like we would only verify or approve a day what was sales that occurred yesterday the deliveries that were done yesterday? Because if they'd been done yesterday then we know for sure for sure that nothing is going to change on that sales order. If we do it two weeks, three weeks four weeks ahead. You have customers making multiple changes part of me thinks that not enough gain by doing it early and we should just wait until after it's been delivered or the sale has occurred. What What are your thoughts there is from workflow Well, I guess from a software perspective, what are your thoughts there on designing

Matthias Miller  1:07:57
software it does it does not matter it just means that there'll be this shift as things move into you know your those accounts will be a day a day or two behind

Speaker 5  1:08:13
but But wouldn't it make it a lot easier where you wouldn't have this this whole process where if somebody changes in accessory or whatever it needs to show back out on the report wouldn't when you eliminate the need for all of that

Matthias Miller  1:08:28
you would but I don't see that approval processes being I mean I kind of think with defaulting the GL account we probably actually want something like that anyway to know I guess we wouldn't have to we could we could show the defaulted account and then have them actually selected defaulted account again. But I don't Well, then. I don't personally see there's a huge, huge complexity it's up to you.

Speaker 5  1:08:54
Do you have thoughts on one versus the other doing it when we write up the order of when sale is actually sale happens

Unknown Speaker  1:09:11
really

Unknown Speaker  1:09:14
I don't think I don't think I do.

Speaker 5  1:09:18
Why don't we plan to start with with doing it early when the order is created. And he was like we could always move it but that trigger point to when to the delivery happens if that feels like it would be the right thing to do. After you know after we've we've used this for a while.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:45
Sure. Okay. I'm good with that.

Matthias Miller  1:10:00
All right well I think that gives me what I need

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11
my end

Unknown Speaker  1:10:24
Okay, so there's

Speaker 5  1:10:27
so what's going to happen next is this Are we already in development phase with this? Or is this will there be a design and approval on this

Matthias Miller  1:10:40
horse if you're comfortable with this with what we've covered we can take it and run with it and have it done by the time you're back if you would like to have this fleshed out a little bit more

Unknown Speaker  1:10:52
and see that first we can also hold off I don't

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
if you're comfortable with it, I would prefer to keep it moving just to avoid fragmenting next time more but I don't know that it's really the end of the world either to push it off yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:13
let's let's push forward with it

Unknown Speaker  1:11:21
good

Matthias Miller  1:11:27
and I will also be Josh let me know hold off and his changes. Good. Yeah, thanks Mark. Have a best enjoyable time away from FTI and all kinds of stuff like that.

Speaker 5  1:11:41
Well, I'll try we're gonna make a bit of vacation and home improvement project so I'll I'll try to disconnect and

Unknown Speaker  1:11:53
where are you going? Where are you going on vacation?

Speaker 5  1:11:57
It's not we're Monday we're going up to Crane Creek for the warmer migration and then maybe the following Monday we're trying to look at doing a day of fishing at a lake near in our area, but not sure yet. Actually, I should I should know Seth if he ever made it to Crane Creek or not, but he was that was one of the places he wanted to go when he's now that he's in the United States into that into birding quite a bit but so that's kind of the plans.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:38
Well have fun.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:40
Okay. Thank you

Matthias Miller  1:12:45
Thank you. Okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:51
I gotta run to the bathroom me too

Unknown Speaker  1:13:23
seems to happen

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
Yeah. Like Chris and I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
are the same size leads to establish

Unknown Speaker  1:13:42
their own routes it's good that getting set up so we can like our

Speaker 6  1:13:51
boss at the time he is in Austin to schedule that she's not busy. She moved out. The rest was always a speed leak. So it's a different request. They're not very

Unknown Speaker  1:14:03
often Yeah. But

Speaker 6  1:14:13
it doesn't have to multiple departments is also the point how often somebody or somebody else has

Unknown Speaker  1:14:21
no

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
idea all right, yeah. Listen, we'll

Speaker 6  1:14:37
all be back on the same team. And we'll be like, hey, look, we already have this meeting. Last year. The new boss I don't know. Boss, same as the old boss.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Jim

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
Oh man, where's the bathroom? I got rid of water I need water yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:57
We need this we need to solve smaller problems

Unknown Speaker  1:16:59
sometimes I wish I would have had

Matthias Miller  1:17:13
sometimes I wish I would have do a better job of tracking all these types of conversations and things that we've had going to be intriguing to say, back on July 19 2022. We have this we tackle this really hairy problem. And here's what the problem was and here's how we fix it. It just be kind of fun to have a wall of like a war. I don't know what the like a trophy wall

Unknown Speaker  1:17:42
unfortunately, if you're gonna make a trophy ball and we need a failure, well

Matthias Miller  1:17:50
remember that time when we

Speaker 3  1:17:52
we gotta, you gotta walk over there and go. All right, which one's bigger? Man? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:18:05
no, no, no. Okay, to your point. Actually, it's not a trophy wall it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14
without tying up

Speaker 2  1:18:18
key decision makers as part of these in the process, without tying them up. I want them to know about this. In other words, I don't want them there for it. I don't want like, but like, it feels like. So many times, it's like, they say, Oh, we want to do something. And so then we go off and we rang when we rang when we were able to come back. Here's what we're doing. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:46
And it's like, there's no connection.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:49
Right? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:18:53
I hate to break it to you. There's a word for that. What's that?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
It's called leverage. It's what they're using.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:05
What do you mean,

Matthias Miller  1:19:06
and we are the lever. I have an idea. Lift, lift, lift, lift, lift, lift, lift.

Speaker 4  1:19:14
Oh, the boulder moves. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:19
So before, anyway?

Speaker 2  1:19:22
Yeah, it's kind of like this. If you if you if you go over to a big boulder with a two by four and a couple blocks of wood and you grunt and you groan and you stress and you just work up a sweat. And then the other guy just walks up with a hydraulic lift and just goes boop,

Speaker 3  1:19:38
because I was easy. And you're like, you have no idea how hard I worked on that.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:47
Yeah. Hey, well

Matthias Miller  1:19:55
that was the end of the CRM discussion.

Matthias Miller  1:20:02
I say unless

Unknown Speaker  1:20:04
you are dying to work on this stuff

Matthias Miller  1:20:08
I say we call it a wrap for a week.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:11
So we did our share

Speaker 2  1:20:14
we've done this way too many times we're just procrastinating

Unknown Speaker  1:20:18
no this time we're not I'm telling you this time we're not

Matthias Miller  1:20:26
Do you have time Wednesday morning as well if we book a second section like sometimes from 11 to two to work on CRM

Speaker 2  1:20:41
Wednesday morning as in a week from today

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:20:47
yes

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
I have the morning open until noon

Unknown Speaker  1:20:53
the well I can move this

Matthias Miller  1:20:59
and we could do I could do 1030 to 12 that were

Speaker 2  1:21:11
really mean well 590 minutes works the best anyway now if we go over 90 minutes we just start the law of diminishing returns kicks in and and Gabe I don't know what I'm going to do there's no way to separate Indiana and

Matthias Miller  1:21:28
understand what he's after somebody needs to get with him and understand why

Speaker 2  1:21:31
he wants to be able to see how many leads per oh, wait a minute, we can actually wait a second. He wants sorry, there's just

Unknown Speaker  1:21:40
prorate the CPC report

Matthias Miller  1:21:47
I don't think completion rates going to be dramatically different between the two maybe I'm wrong

Unknown Speaker  1:21:54
the number of form fills

Matthias Miller  1:22:00
in the Indiana we had

Speaker 4  1:22:06
250 form fills in April and in

Matthias Miller  1:22:13
North Carolina we had 204 and

Speaker 4  1:22:19
wait that's not to afford 250 and 374

Speaker 1  1:22:25
so this this spreadsheet of information is this I'm assuming this is from Robert is this Ohio What is this say Hi

Matthias Miller  1:22:38
So April had when I sent him this from me to gave

Unknown Speaker  1:22:45
I sent him type form leads

Matthias Miller  1:22:48
he said 434 submissions which is way more submissions and one of actually seeing we didn't switch the switch the lead forms

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
that type format

Speaker 4  1:23:06
beggars let's go for the semi pistol grip for shed let's try this one as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:13
Ah yay so it's January February three marketing budget

Speaker 4  1:23:22
initial 121 for 34 plus 21 minus 374 minus 250 There's about 70 leads missing

Matthias Miller  1:23:52
this is an easy 252 50 divided by two thirds this plus i think i think it's it's the easy way is to say Indiana got approximately 40% of leads

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
he's actually

Speaker 2  1:24:18
I don't quite understand what if those are Roberts numbers something doesn't look right.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
See I thought he had more than that for the month of April

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37
Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
last pass for 18388

Unknown Speaker  1:24:59
Well

Speaker 1  1:25:01
Let's see here. New House leaves new house. Come on, come on, come on, come on new house responses in the month of filter by timeframe last month.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:14
Apply

Speaker 1  1:25:18
330 Okay, nevermind. All right. Somebody had 338 339 I don't know what Okay, so I'll go okay. Okay, fine. That's that is right

Speaker 2  1:25:39
this one be terrible. But I mean, the leads wise, would you not be like, you should be able to? Did you pull that

Matthias Miller  1:25:47
you can filter results? No, but we're gonna have zip code until the end. So

Unknown Speaker  1:25:52
zip code into the end of what

Unknown Speaker  1:25:55
we've formed him, like, how would we know what's coming from where? Whether it's Indiana or

Unknown Speaker  1:26:04
you can't answer the completion rate per district, but you can answer everything else.

Matthias Miller  1:26:10
I just reply and say that the approximately 40% of total leads in April that are 40% of total leads in April were for Indiana and 60%.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
Were for North Carolina, based on the ad reports

Speaker 2  1:26:28
28 points on completion. So the only number from that spreadsheet that that he has that Robert built there, the only thing that you can't answer per district is Completion. Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39
You can answer everything else. Yeah.
