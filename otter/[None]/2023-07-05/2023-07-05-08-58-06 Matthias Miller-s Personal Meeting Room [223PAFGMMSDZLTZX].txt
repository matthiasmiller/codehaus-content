Unknown Speaker  03:03
Hey there, Matthias.

Matthias Miller  03:07
Hey Ben, how are you this morning?

Unknown Speaker  03:11
Not too bad. Are you

Matthias Miller  03:15
doing good

Matthias Miller  05:02
I guess you let them know about the 11 o'clock

Unknown Speaker  05:12
here in a second see whether the problem

Matthias Miller  06:16
I'm gonna go over

Unknown Speaker  06:18
give them a call real quick and see.

Speaker 1  08:03
Yeah, I just tried calling them and they went to voicemail some yet thing that they've got something else going real quick, but I left them a message. And we'll see where it goes from there.

Matthias Miller  08:21
All right, well on the road now I don't have much else to do until then. So his, as I recall, his question was how to do the financial, how to assign the accounting accounting.

Speaker 1  08:41
The accounting class, yeah, there's some stuff about like financial allocations. And then mark it also called me, I don't know, nine or 930 this morning just to confirm that we're planning on doing the call. And he also mentioned something about figuring out the accounts payable stuff where to take care of that documentation. But, yeah, he was envisioning kind of talking about the financial allocations and Deputy with the other item kind of hearing those items as well.

Matthias Miller  09:27
You want to just for your own info full of the financial allocation record in

Unknown Speaker  09:34
Ah yeah, so that would be FGI financial allocations, correct.

Matthias Miller  09:43
Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.

Speaker 1  09:45
Okay. That would have here

Matthias Miller  09:55
probably need to create a new one. I don't think we've got anything created there yet.

Unknown Speaker  09:59
There's Two ears one for North Carolina. And one bro Hi. Oh.

Matthias Miller  10:09
Okay, jump into one of those. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  10:15
just went ahead and jumped into the North Carolina here. All right.

Matthias Miller  10:28
I don't know how much there is to we have documentation on what most of this stuff is in mean, think probably based on this question, this is where everything's at

Matthias Miller  10:53
that's a matter of if it's not clear explaining what each of these settings are, and planning out what it should be tied out to, but

Matthias Miller  11:08
it could be helpful for reference having the client proposal, the I heard proposal, pulling up the section on the FTA allocation record.

Unknown Speaker  11:18
Yeah, just some of it to

Matthias Miller  11:25
that as well as the building and accounting impact of the sales order accounting impact, like your fingers. But everything should be included in those three sections that are that would be relevant to configuration.

Speaker 1  11:47
Okay. I did just discover that I don't have permission to configure FTI costs and

Matthias Miller  12:03
I'm gonna have to give you a difference

Speaker 1  12:06
permission type. Like I can view it, but I can edit it

Unknown Speaker  12:18
right.

Matthias Miller  13:02
And then the AP documentation. There is a change well.

Matthias Miller  13:20
Know the API documentation, there's two sections in the client proposal for that. One is on I think reminders or something like that. And then the other one is a shorter form. And then the other one is limited. second of the two items is like a multi paragraph

Matthias Miller  13:56
but he was gonna get Yeah. So I don't know if he if he was looking for documentation, that would be the thing that I believe he would be looking at.

Speaker 1  14:05
Okay, yes, you're in the proposal on seeing three different sections in phase one B, that have accounts payable, and then one more in phase three

Speaker 1  14:30
versus the one that won't be county impact and schedule a and one that has Josh in parentheses?

Matthias Miller  14:51
I think it would be the accounting fees or there's one accounting impact when scheduling one with Josh.

Unknown Speaker  14:57
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:59
It would be the account On impact one does that one have that's like a multi paragraph

Speaker 1  15:05
yeah it's got a decent amount of stuff on it number of paragraphs

Matthias Miller  15:16
I believe

Matthias Miller  15:24
90% sure that's the one thing YEAH.

Matthias Miller  18:44
Well I'm wondering if at this point we should just wait until we hear back from them

Unknown Speaker  18:54
yeah

Speaker 1  19:01
yeah, I tried calling drew because Mark had told me this morning to reach out to Drew when we were ready. I could also try giving mark with him all if you want or we can just wait that could work

Matthias Miller  19:21
we give mark a call quick and just see. Okay, are you good? No, hang around here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:30
I'll call you right back

Speaker 1  20:36
Yeah, Mark didn't answer either. So I have a message for him too.

Matthias Miller  20:46
All right. Well, I'm gonna assume during the meeting, I'll keep rolling and feel free to holler once you back from them and go from there.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
Okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  21:01
Awesome. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  21:03
