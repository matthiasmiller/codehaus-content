Speaker 1  01:49
A nice coffee shop. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:56
there's some sweet places right here. So I met with these bssn grads that I was telling you about yesterday. That's just now for lunch. Oh, okay, cool. She does the very similar type of thing, her own spin on it, with their investment clients and you they during covid, they were working in the same farming, people like Pastor, and you ever heard her talking about whale farming? And he's like, why are you talking about whale farming? He looks over her shoulder, and the client was just weeping, like in complete tears. And so I asked him. I was like, so how do you describe what she does? And he was like, Well, I relate it back to what people know. And I say, well, she's, she's a light, she's, she's like a life and business coach. And then he had this phrase. He said, business is a lot about doing tasks, and this gives people room to think about what they're doing. And another phrase that he did was, she creates space for people to grow. Yeah, I was, like, very interesting to hear somebody who's naturally. He's very naturally, very he's the he's the numbers and analytics detail. To hear his description. I was like, Man, that's cool to hear.

Unknown Speaker  03:41
Yeah.

Speaker 1  03:46
I have wording you might be able to use.

Unknown Speaker  03:55
Let's see I

Speaker 1  04:12
this is what I did for one client. It's, we were. The offer was, hey, you're, you're enjoying a deep, insightful conversation that leads to breakthroughs and clarity.

Speaker 1  04:35
And then the offer was 90 days of insight, but it's, it's, it's, it's conversational based, it's, this is the space

Unknown Speaker  04:48
for insight,

Speaker 1  04:51
and that leads to breakthroughs, that leads to clarity, breakthrough and results. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 1  05:06
yeah. And you know what? Space? That's actually a good selling point, because they have no space, right? They're always task focused, yeah, right. Remember the, if you're cluttered mind thing, yeah? Or the Richard Kosh thing you can't. Action drives out that. Action drives out that. Like, that's actually, that's actually a good framing. Is, uh,

Unknown Speaker  05:47
you can't be task managed like you can't be met like it's not it's not what that shouldn't drive the train. I

Matthias Miller  06:04
Are you? Oh, sorry, Facebook Post this morning.

Matthias Miller  06:16
Is it still time freedom? If your second in command pays for it with their health and well being,

Speaker 1  06:25
I like it. But what I don't understand is, it's still time freedom.

Matthias Miller  06:31
I was okay. The context is, I've been doing posts about time freedom. So here,

Unknown Speaker  06:39
let me just share my screen. You don't have time freedom.

Matthias Miller  06:41
We're not talking we're talking to you. This is, this is to the owners. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  06:46
I see. I thought it was the second

Matthias Miller  06:50
time for someone who loves, loves, how they're spending their time. We talked about time freedom. Why are we talking about time prisoners?

Unknown Speaker  06:59
You know, if you're a second

Matthias Miller  07:04
in command patient with your health and well being? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:11
you know, I have a very similar

Unknown Speaker  07:15
approach,

Speaker 1  07:17
except I don't. I haven't, I don't share, I don't share it with anyone. I just post from time to time.

Unknown Speaker  07:29
Let me share my screen. Okay, so,

Speaker 1  07:36
yeah, this is I mean I like. So I have my phrases kind of like you, but I add visuals. So yeah, a friend introduced himself as a high functioning alcoholic. But I just, and I've said society,

Unknown Speaker  07:59
yeah, that's

Speaker 1  08:00
just another term for being high, strong and high stressed, right? But I do, I do the black and white,

Unknown Speaker  08:16
right?

Unknown Speaker  08:22
I like, I like the black and white.

Unknown Speaker  08:29
Let's see, anyways, they could get lost in this. Okay, that's awesome. I

Speaker 1  08:44
Yes, I have, okay, so I had, I have the design, you know, you know this for

Speaker 2  08:57
me share my screen, I guess I

Speaker 1  09:03
Yes, you've already seen it for the cover, but I don't think I can put it on the cover of page yet. Anyways, that well, it's not tailored. The document isn't tailored to second in commands. So, right,

Unknown Speaker  09:23
to me, that's more of like, maybe you hide, maybe, yes, my story, maybe you keep this here. Maybe you could keep this here, but you have a second one that's just corporate,

Speaker 1  09:48
I'm not sure, and you send them that link, so they'd probably be like, Oh, I already have the link. Maybe I don't need I don't know. I. There's two audiences now, so,

Matthias Miller  10:05
okay, well, the story went into the trash. I'm not sure how I'm getting it back out.

Unknown Speaker  10:09
What went into the trash?

Unknown Speaker  10:12
The 100 per story. Google back. So it's out now. I don't know why I got there.

Unknown Speaker  10:26
Where this one,

Matthias Miller  10:31
if it's the final one, yeah, that one had just just, just now, been in the trash. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  10:40
good catch.

Unknown Speaker  10:50
What

Unknown Speaker  10:55
just happened.

Speaker 1  10:59
Now this, this is normal. Oh, you're on the same document, yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:03
and the 100 review is in the trash, the planetary version and a bunch of the friends is too,

Unknown Speaker  11:12
right? Can you share your screen?

Unknown Speaker  11:18
So I did. I threw um,

Speaker 1  11:33
so this one too. Oh, I've never even seen the friend review. I just created

Speaker 3  11:40
a copy. But how did it get in the this is really baffling. I mean, that's a little disturbing.

Unknown Speaker  11:54
Yeah, I've never seen that. I mean,

Matthias Miller  11:57
I just created a copy so that they could, so my friends could put comments on it and they wouldn't see planetaries. They had edit access, commenting access,

Unknown Speaker  12:06
okay, so they can't throw it in the trash. I

Speaker 1  12:20
I, personally, I like the three bullets to me that was, like, very clear.

Matthias Miller  12:36
I think she already said, I don't know if I'm your person,

Speaker 1  12:41
yeah? Oh, I threw, I threw that in the trash because, because, well, that makes sense. When I transferred it, the White didn't come through. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
Okay, so, what are you suggesting, suggesting for corporate?

Speaker 1  13:00
Well, I just don't know if this is aimed at second home commands. The cover Right,

Unknown Speaker  13:08
right. So

Speaker 1  13:12
there's two elements, adding adding questions that are tailored to second commands. Um, um,

Speaker 1  13:25
it's just, it's just might be, maybe you don't, maybe it's over tailoring it. If you're still, if you're going to do 100 proof, you to CEOs, 100 proof leaders, underproof team. So

Matthias Miller  13:45
just being incredibly candid, yeah, it is really difficult for me to go back through and edit something, I mean, without you and I sitting down, okay, okay.

Speaker 1  14:01
Well, make, let's make, at least make a copy, and then put corporate. Yeah, second in command,

Matthias Miller  14:18
yeah, okay. I'm getting my call now, so, all right, see ya,

Unknown Speaker  14:30
yep, I can hear you.
