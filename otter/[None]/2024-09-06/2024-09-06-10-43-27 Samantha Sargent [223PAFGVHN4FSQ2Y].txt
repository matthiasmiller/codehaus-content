Hey, thanks. Yeah, it's been a great adventure. And yes, I'm definitely doing awesome. Hope you're doing awesome too. And I do still do my events. That's actually what's feeding my self defense school, is I still do event consulting and event coordination. I have a Halloween event, I have an Easter event. I have another event in April, and then I'm hired for a couple of little ones here and there. So I'll send you my website so you can see what's on there right now. And then I would love to chat with her. And then if you guys are like, Okay, we need more consulting, then I'll chat with you about what that looks like, and what projects you have going on and whatnot. So yeah, good to hear from you.
