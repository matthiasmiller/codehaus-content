Unknown Speaker  01:32
Well, hey, hey,

Speaker 1  01:33
um, I. Well, hey, hey, can you hear me. Yes. Again, don't feel obligated you suggested there because I don't. use your video or whatever. Let's just knock this out. So I basically just quickly accepted everything you. there, because I don't have anything better to say about it, and it looked good to me. What's weird is I got that one. I must be nuts, but I thought I got that 1.2 million from something you had in one of these, yeah, Docs, you did. So we, we used it to, it's right there. I use this system. But we, he wasn't a client, okay, so now I'm, I'm not here to twist your ethical arm. But if you have a, I mean, how do I say this? Like Jeremy, could look at our Facebook ads, walk out the door and tell another shed dealer I know exactly what makes you get leads for $10 a lead, right? And he wouldn't be lying. Does that make sense. So you might not have been the one to do X, but if you know x, if x is part of your strategy, if x is good stuff, and you're going to use it, and you know that x got y results. Um, it doesn't say he was our client. It says that one dealer does that bother you? Is that pushing the boundaries for you or something? Well, I mean, there's another part where you explicitly did go on the client which is wrong, where don't think so, or was it inferred? Who we helped? Yeah, you removed it, but it was in The v4 section. I, oh, yeah, okay, I How do you feel about this? Right the way it is, right now, let me share a quick story. One dealer did this. You didn't say you did it for him. Didn't say it was a client, just one dealer did this. That's the power of having the right system. I mean, like that. That's true. That would be like me preaching to somebody about 8020 I didn't write the 8020 book, but I've read about it, seen it, and believe it. Does that make sense? Yeah, this, what's that? Yeah, I don't know I feel about it, but, Got a different story to use instead. I

Speaker 1  05:26
I think about Gabe for a minute. Is there anything like this that Gabe did XYZ because you said so, or whether or not you said so, I don't care. And you know, got to seven figures.

Matthias Miller  05:54
Remember where we did our game math?

Unknown Speaker  05:57
There used to be a sheet I

Speaker 1  06:20
I'm not sure that the sheet was ever shared with me. I know I saw it on your screen once, but I don't think I had it had to do with Sales. It was a sales report of some kind. I

Speaker 1  07:53
Is it this? I'm about to send you a link in chatty, possibly to this, trying to what am I looking at?

Speaker 1  08:12
No, it was similar to this, but it wasn't exactly this,

Speaker 1  08:21
although maybe this will jog your memory, attribute, attributable, revenue was 933k on this particular sheet. That was just part of A year, I guess I

Matthias Miller  09:35
right? I

Unknown Speaker  13:32
I'm still looking for Data.

Speaker 2  13:32
so 20. Still looking for data.

Matthias Miller  13:32
October. No, March. Still looking for data. It. Still looking for data. Yeah, so 20. 2021. 2021 It. So we started in screen and we started in October, no March. Hold it. And I have a really hard time believing that these numbers are really this low.

Speaker 1  15:16
I whatever I'm looking at here, I don't think is the grand total at all. It's something we worked up someday. I mean, it was the year its last edit was made in mid summer of 2023 I don't think that was like the last day we worked for them,

Matthias Miller  15:36
because here it's showing something like but maybe it is true, showing something like little over 1,000,020 21 around four and a half million in 2022.

Unknown Speaker  15:58
6.8 in 2023

Matthias Miller  16:06
and then 13 and 2024

Speaker 1  16:13
that was after us, right? That was after us. Wow. How'd they get from six to 13?

Matthias Miller  16:20
They hired a top match sales manager

Speaker 1  16:23
after stalling on you to for all that time when you tried to get them to change their sales staff.

Unknown Speaker  16:31
For real, yep.

Speaker 1  16:35
I mean, again, if we're talking about telling stories, which, just to be clear, I do not have an ax to grind. I'm just trying to tell a story in that Facebook ad to like spark interest saying that. And I don't care if it was a former client, you could be telling a story about Elon Musk and it would still be true if the facts are true. Does that? Does that make sense? I'm not sure I'm saying that, right, but like apples to apples. To apples, if, if, in you know, if getting the right kind of sales manager or sales process or anything is the trick, and you know, you're going to help people do that, you can say, like, you know, this one company, and like, I don't care if we say that we worked with them or not, but you know, they they got the right person, whatever it is, the right system, the right person, the right mindset, and went from 6 million to 13 million. You're not saying that you personally got them from 6 million to 13 million, but you are saying, I have seen what it takes to go from 6 million to 13 million, right? And they're gonna be like, What? What was it tell me which is, which is all we want out of this ad in the first place. I

Speaker 1  18:05
you know, one, one shed company implemented, uh, you know, or executed, a strategic sales team decision, whatever. I'm totally flubbing the words there, right? And it took and in 2024 it took them from 6 million to an astonishing 13 million, right? Is this as a replacement for this?

Matthias Miller  18:31
Yeah, I mean,

Speaker 1  18:36
installed our shed Titan super strategy system and,

Matthias Miller  18:50
yeah, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  18:52
I get the rationale and the defense for it. It's just, I don't know,

Speaker 1  19:02
you sound like me, you can't undercut yourself. I my half of my problem is I always want everything I do to yield absolutely astonishing results, and I get so bent out of shape when it's like 2x ROI, and then I have other people tell me, like, Man Alive, get a grip and be happy about it, right? Feeling the same with you right now, like, you know, you know what to do to get somebody from 6 million to 13 million, and you don't want to talk about it or something,

Matthias Miller  19:31
well, but, I mean, but it wasn't me. I mean, that's the thing. It's, it's implying that it's me and it wasn't. But

Speaker 1  19:39
you know what was done, right? And it's literally the same kind of thing that you're going to have the people who work with you. Do say again,

Matthias Miller  19:51
maybe, I don't know. I mean, I haven't given much thought to replicating this strategy elsewhere.

Speaker 1  19:56
Okay, well, what can we say here? That's like, it's. Story about something that, something good that happened, that you somehow instigated or caused.

Matthias Miller  20:14
And you don't want to talk about cutting $45,000 worth of marketing

Speaker 1  20:20
waste. I don't mind it. I just don't think cutting waste is going to appeal to your common shed dealer, which is who these ads are going to as much as growth? Do you? Most of them are probably not even spending multi K on marketing, and so they can't even relate to that real well, right? I'm pretty sure that what's going to wet these guys whistles is like more revenue.

Speaker 1  20:56
I mean, I guess you could, you could flip that on its head and say, added 42 grand to a shed company's bottom line without really specifying in what fashion you did. So turns out it was by saving, right, not growth, but,

Matthias Miller  21:21
um, I mean, you could say that in less than two days of working with me once, when you know, in less than two days of working with with me, one company put $45,000 I mean, it's technically every year, but

Speaker 1  21:47
no but that same said, If you talked about it over two days, and they did it, and it worked, and the results was saving $42,000 in it two days,

Matthias Miller  21:58
but $45,000 directly into The owner's pocket.

Unknown Speaker  22:22
You can see my screen or, or the dock, at least something,

Unknown Speaker  22:26
yeah, let me pull up the dock.

Speaker 1  22:32
Let's say, let's say, just, in just two days, working with me, one in, uh, was it an independent shed dealer? I'm gonna it was manufacturer, one shade company, I'm not sure the value of the work. What's, what's the best thing To say right here? I

Speaker 1  23:33
uh, that this is an ad in that context list. At the moment we need to say something about them. And

Matthias Miller  24:00
I wonder if there's any way to make this almost like a footnote,

Unknown Speaker  24:11
to make it what like a footnote? Yes. I mean, it's kind of the hook. It's got to be at the opening,

Matthias Miller  24:26
like I did all this stuff. Oh, and by the way, we put $45,000 directly into the orange pocket. I

Unknown Speaker  26:29
Much better. Yep, I

Speaker 1  26:29
Anything that's fine. I. Much better. Yep. The part of the reason for my hesitation is because people know each other. If there's. if there's anything that's bordering on false claims. It's not going to serve as well at all. I so I'm not sure what you want on the hybrid booking funnel. One I if there's one place we can just do without it, that's it. Let's just get that out of here. Problem solve on that. Is there anything else in here that you don't like or isn't accurate? Um, the fills your calendar. Where is that? Click My name, click my photo up top. Not working for me. Oh, Dragon. Do just pipeline, yeah, or we can say something entirely different, if you know like this. I don't even know if that's appealing enough. Is that appealing to your average? The people we were going after? Building selling that fills your pipeline with qualified prospects and boosts revenue while you focus on building and showing selling sheds. Um, more. I'm sorry that that booked appointment, booked calls business, came in for as a chat Japanese GBT artifact, and it escaped my attention entirely. More leads, hi, let me just see if the word booked or support calendar in here. Else that one's fine, that one's fine is booked in here, anywhere else that one's fine.

Unknown Speaker  31:01
Man? Meant

Speaker 1  31:08
that actually might be true. Can you do the same to me? Can you click on my name and get to a spot on the page? Yep, see where the word appointment is used here. Yeah. Do do do people sometimes make appointments to, like, come to the lot and walk around the lot with you.

Matthias Miller  31:33
They do, but Well, I mean potentially, but

Unknown Speaker  31:37
better, better way to say this

Unknown Speaker  31:41
reads and

Unknown Speaker  31:52
reads in quotes.

Speaker 1  31:54
There you go. I like that. And then that still plays on quite well, the constant Chase, the follow ups and the missed opportunities, right? Like, that's all a good okay? And then I think that's the last of the artifacts around bookings and things.

Matthias Miller  32:16
I think I'm happy with that. Okay,

Speaker 1  32:18
anything else in here that bothers you? Yes? Uh, one last question. So the to me, the Hey Gen videos are just a little bit slow and sleepy, but I couldn't find a spec, a setting to make you talk faster. Is there a way to do that on on the fly?

Matthias Miller  32:37
Yeah, these are about the settings that I use.

Unknown Speaker  32:41
Show me.

Matthias Miller  32:46
I add style exaggeration and speed to 1.1 where

Speaker 1  32:50
is that? So like I'm down in a folder. I click Create Video, Avatar, video landscape into

Speaker 2  32:57
the script. Script, okay, dip the three dots.

Speaker 1  33:05
I don't have three dots. Where am I looking? Let me just show screen again.

Speaker 2  33:20
Add script three dots there. Got it that style, exaggeration, speed.

Matthias Miller  33:33
And by the way, when you generate it, you can generate with the higher FPS if you want to.

Unknown Speaker  33:38
And what do you recommend?

Matthias Miller  33:41
So I've been doing like 65

Speaker 2  33:44
ish percent, something like that, speed, 1.1

Speaker 1  33:53
Okay, okay, very helpful. That alone was probably worth the time here because it was a little sleepy, the output, uh, stability, then that's all the same. 7575 66 1.1 Okay, okay, awesome. Um, good. That it. I'll just regenerate all these and get this stuff up and running. I may not get it all up tonight, but I'll try.

Matthias Miller  34:28
Okay, all right, sounds good. Appreciate it.
