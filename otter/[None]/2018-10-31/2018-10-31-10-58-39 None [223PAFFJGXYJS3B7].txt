So here's a bit of a crazy idea. The idea is something along the lines of this, what if I would write a sales letter? And instead of writing it for myself, which seems really selfish, what if I would separate myself out and you know, there's this little guy inside of me who's

Unknown Speaker  00:19
a little insecure, a little afraid to ask for what he needs and what if I go into the space where I am the third party I am the mediator I am the helper and I write a sales letter to these nonprofit owners and write it on behalf of my little insecure self not as not out of a sense of neediness but just as a way of like, literally helping myself helping helping the person inside of me

Unknown Speaker  00:50
that's so it's been so scared about, I don't know, all this stuff, all this resistance and stuff,

Unknown Speaker  00:59
whatever we do that what if I go into that position? And you know, I think that many times it's hard for me to really recognize

Unknown Speaker  01:11
the times that I'm not loving myself well enough. I put myself into this frame of mind I'm able to actually see how I've not been loving myself well and allow love to touch that untouchable part of me.
