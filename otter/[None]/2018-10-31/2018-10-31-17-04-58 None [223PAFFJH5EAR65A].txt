Unknown Speaker  00:00
Alright, so here's an interesting problem. And this is one of the things that I'm trying to work through right. Now one

Unknown Speaker  00:04
of the questions is how do you create scoreboards for non scoreboard types of stuff? So for example on and for a bookkeeper, what is the scoreboard for a bookkeeper? Is it is an accuracy? And I think it could be that is it,

Unknown Speaker  00:24
you know, is the turnaround time? It could be that

Unknown Speaker  00:30
there's a you know, that's really it's a really challenging problem. I feel like there should be a scoreboard like there's something naturally that went you

Unknown Speaker  00:41
let's see, what is it? What is it?

Unknown Speaker  00:46
Well, I guess, I guess here's, here's the way you approach it. One of the questions is, what's the outcome that you're after? So one of the outcomes that you're after with that is clear, articulate accounting, a

Unknown Speaker  00:57
clear reporting. So that's the outcome. Now, the question is, what kind of metrics Do you need to have in place that measure the work the inputs that a

Unknown Speaker  01:11
bookkeeper excuse me, when a bookkeeper puts into that

Unknown Speaker  01:15
to measure

Unknown Speaker  01:18
he

Unknown Speaker  01:20
All right, well, let's, let's take a look at some possible things that you could measure good measure number of entries,

Unknown Speaker  01:25
you can measure time

Unknown Speaker  01:27
he measured dollar amounts,

Unknown Speaker  01:30
you could measure,

Unknown Speaker  01:33
okay, you do some relative stuff. So you can do time per entry, which encourages speed,

Unknown Speaker  01:40
you could

Unknown Speaker  01:42
do something along lines of accuracy in time.

Unknown Speaker  01:46
So accuracy by minute, it's kind of an interesting one,

Unknown Speaker  01:51
you could do time span. So how long between you know, what's what's how close between from where we are up to the minute to, you know, what the books say,

Unknown Speaker  02:11
you could now here's an interesting one,

Unknown Speaker  02:15
you could have a metric that's centered around automation.

Unknown Speaker  02:20
So

Unknown Speaker  02:24
kind of the idea of,

Unknown Speaker  02:27
Okay, now I'm going completely off in left field and some crazy

Unknown Speaker  02:31
ideas. But

Unknown Speaker  02:33
one of the things he could do is have the how many transactions, what percentage of transactions Can

Unknown Speaker  02:41
you automatically categorize?

Unknown Speaker  02:45
And so certainly, there's some things that will always be difficult to categorize. So, for example, Amazon, you can buy all kinds of stuff on the episode

Unknown Speaker  02:51
excuse me,

Unknown Speaker  02:54
did you go into a

Unknown Speaker  02:55
lot of different categories, but there's some categories that, you know, it's always going to be one thing or the other. And

Unknown Speaker  03:01
so given a bank statement been given statements, can you set of rules that

Unknown Speaker  03:08
allow you to effectively categorize these transactions, so

Unknown Speaker  03:14
then you kind of have a testing framework, so it's kind of like an AI style thing for

Unknown Speaker  03:21
for categorization.

Unknown Speaker  03:25
But does that help with the outcome, it gives called better up to the minute information, which means that you can automatically terminate when, when information comes in. You don't have to wait for things to get entered.

Unknown Speaker  03:35
So that's a positive,

Unknown Speaker  03:38
but I think I'm looking at this completely wrong. So I think I'm looking at the bookkeeper role is strictly a, a, an entry role.

Unknown Speaker  03:46
Now, what happens if you turn this into more of a

Unknown Speaker  03:51
CFO style role?

Unknown Speaker  03:54
Where,

Unknown Speaker  03:58
let's see, that doesn't seem like it's completely their responsibility. But I'm thinking like, okay, there's,

Unknown Speaker  04:03
there's, you know, cash, how much cash, you've got the bank,

Unknown Speaker  04:08
how long? How long do you have to live with your burn rate?

Unknown Speaker  04:15
profitability?

Unknown Speaker  04:25
Seems kind of challenging, I don't understand. I'm quite sure what did where to go with all of that.

Unknown Speaker  04:30
I'm not sure where to go with all of that.

Unknown Speaker  04:33
It's a really challenging problem.

Unknown Speaker  04:36
That'd be an interesting question to send to the 40 x guys.

Unknown Speaker  04:42
I wonder if there be any way of getting an answer

Unknown Speaker  04:47
really interesting.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
Now, here's another question. What happens to a bookkeeper

Unknown Speaker  04:58
when they have extra time?

Unknown Speaker  05:03
I think in reality,

Unknown Speaker  05:06
it is a metric of accuracy by time

Unknown Speaker  05:16
and in reality, it comes down to

Unknown Speaker  05:21
what is the

Unknown Speaker  05:26
how many mistakes on a monthly reconciliation,

Unknown Speaker  05:37
but then what's the appropriate ratio?

Unknown Speaker  05:40
Where's the trade off?

Unknown Speaker  05:42
That's the question

Unknown Speaker  05:48
like what what's the ratio of

Unknown Speaker  05:57
there's a somewhat there's got to be a better approach. This

Unknown Speaker  06:02
was

Unknown Speaker  06:05
what is the scorecard for a bookkeeper

Unknown Speaker  06:10
admin assistant?

Unknown Speaker  06:14
The scorecard for an admin assistant is how many hours Can she saved of my time?

Unknown Speaker  06:22
That

Unknown Speaker  06:26
is intriguing. I like that a lot.

Unknown Speaker  06:33
Okay, now that's different and assistant is different from a let's say a higher bookkeeping, bookkeeping firm.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
I still think the basic thing is accuracy per dollar,

Unknown Speaker  06:46
if it's strictly clerical. Now, if it goes into if it goes beyond that, so how much today allows to help with budgeting so there could be

Unknown Speaker  06:59
happily what are the things that bookkeepers can put in place to avoid budget overruns, and then you know, how many budget of rents are there? How many at fault budget over runs?

Unknown Speaker  07:09
can we avoid budget overruns completely

Unknown Speaker  07:19
here's a good one.

Unknown Speaker  07:22
something along the lines

Unknown Speaker  07:26
always have X amount of cash at any given time, which means no surprise purchases over X amount,

Unknown Speaker  07:39
or no surprise liabilities

Unknown Speaker  07:41
above X amount.

Unknown Speaker  07:44
That actually is a really interesting

Unknown Speaker  07:49
idea. I kind of like that.

Unknown Speaker  07:53
So in other words,

Unknown Speaker  07:54
the bookkeepers job

Unknown Speaker  07:57
is to make the business as boring as possible. And obviously, you cannot blame them for any kinds of surprises after fault. So in other words, if they say, look, two months, or now we've got a we've got a

Unknown Speaker  08:13
x thousand dollar bill, who's that's going to be come do that's not their fault. If the revenue isn't it,

Unknown Speaker  08:21
it's their fault to make sure that that the owner is aware and knows what's going on. And so

Unknown Speaker  08:26
obviously, you have to make the metric in such a way that it's only the responsibility. So that's really interesting. I love those two metrics. So that's, that's it for an admin assistant slash bookkeeper.
