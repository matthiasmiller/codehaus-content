It's like a really interesting story about employee engagement. And

Unknown Speaker  00:05
it was it just kind of struck a chord with me mostly because of my 40 x exposure.

Unknown Speaker  00:12
But basically short story is that there were a bunch of bad motivated and there was an unmotivated team and the team we've decided to implement some incentives

Unknown Speaker  00:23
around work performance. And here's the thing that I found curious that I think that the actual act of implementing the metrics and the measurement and the scorecard is more significant than the actual prizes that you offer in fact I think the prizes can actually end up in many times demoralizing the the outcome because you're you're working to to earn

Unknown Speaker  00:48
instead of working for the sheer pleasure of the game. There's something that happens with a any kind of sport whence once you actually start playing the game with the scoreboard and it's visible. So that's that's one of it. That's part of it. But

Unknown Speaker  01:03
yeah, anyway, that was really curious to me. I wonder, too, if there's something to do with employee engagement that we needed to implement.

Unknown Speaker  01:11
So there you go.
