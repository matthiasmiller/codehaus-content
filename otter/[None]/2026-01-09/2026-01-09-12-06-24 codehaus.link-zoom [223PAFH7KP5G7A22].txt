Unknown Speaker  00:06
Yes,

Speaker 1  00:58
all right. Matt, ready, yep, try it again. All right, awesome. All right. So go ahead, bud. We were talking about print here.

Unknown Speaker  01:08
Thank George, you're good.

Matthias Miller  01:11
Now I'm a little confused here. Let me, let me see if I can get this. Oh, that's why here this guy,

Unknown Speaker  01:21
what's the line? It was fine. There we go. We're still looking

Matthias Miller  01:32
that's fine. Share my screen. Okay, so here's, here's the list of them, yeah, so I think basically, so here's, like, some of these are, you know, literally the can't size some of them here, we're obviously doing something with them. They map out to a can't, but there's no, they're not going through any sizer to get there.

Speaker 1  02:06
But buddy, I had to do something here. I was done on my site. What were you saying again? Their map?

Matthias Miller  02:13
There's some of these where I forget what the exact conditions are. I have to go look it up. I can find that in a minute. So you said, if, if the size,

Matthias Miller  02:30
hey, if, if this is, are you there

Unknown Speaker  02:41
at last, you hear I can't hear you. I don't know if you can hear me. How about now? Now?

Matthias Miller  02:52
Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay, so if, if the raw material has a can't size in it, and the can't size has a lumber, dimension of the lumber, then we classify it as a can't, but we have these where it's not going through a sizer.

Unknown Speaker  03:11
Shoot, Matt, how about now?

Matthias Miller  03:14
Yeah, can you hear me? How about now? Now.

Unknown Speaker  03:20
Hello. Hello, Hi,

Unknown Speaker  03:52
then your network panel. You

Unknown Speaker  04:04
it. Can you hear me now, now, now it's on, okay, well, I'm

Matthias Miller  04:18
going to try taking off my video. You can turn off your video too. That might help. Or I can turn off your video for you, I think. Let's see if that helps the internet connection.

Speaker 1  04:33
There you go. Hold on. Try this again.

Unknown Speaker  04:37
Okay, how about now? I

Unknown Speaker  05:36
Are you there? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:39
okay, can you, okay, the video,

Matthias Miller  05:45
you can, I mean, we can try it. It can save bandwidth.

Unknown Speaker  05:48
If you it's talking, host has disabled itself.

Matthias Miller  05:51
I turned it off to save bandwidth. But if you can, oh, sure, look, if we're having internet trouble, yeah, that's fine. Okay, so if, if the if the raw material info, has a can't size in it, and the can't has a matching lumber dimensions, we say it's, it's a, it's coming out of a can't, but it's not going through the sizer to get there. Like there's nothing on here that says it's coming.

Speaker 1  06:24
Keep blue. We keep losing you. I don't know what's going on here.

Matthias Miller  06:28
Can you put me on speaker? Can you put me on speaker on the office phone?

Speaker 2  06:33
Yeah, yep. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:08
Now? How about now?

Unknown Speaker  07:28
Can't size in it, and as the key of

Unknown Speaker  07:48
again, that CLE, 50159, yeah, okay, so let, we're gonna look at that real.

Unknown Speaker  08:08
There is an internet issue going on here. I can't get

Unknown Speaker  08:25
it's only in you're saying it's only in

Unknown Speaker  08:29
missile a it's a

Speaker 3  08:45
does this one? Is this one supposed to go synthesizer? Does that make sense? Is that a 33

Unknown Speaker  08:53
here it is. Yeah,

Speaker 2  09:11
answer, right? Maybe don't really the Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  09:31
One might be in the wrong. 150159,

Unknown Speaker  09:37
we're looking at that. Yep, you're on it. 33 30 threes.

Unknown Speaker  09:46
It does keep on.

Speaker 4  09:50
See it's we're taking 14 foot counts on the L and M, cutting them to 33 and then we're taking them to the triple head bandsaw, three. And splitting them 916, but I still need that camp for the L M's purpose

Speaker 1  10:11
is it, did you ever run it on a gangs, on a size or manual? George, once in a while.

Speaker 4  10:17
So once in a while, I will you run it if what the capacity is, how many, what the quantity is. I might run on the gang, but I just got to go into the items and change it so it shows up on the cut list for a sizer and not the well saw line. No. I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  10:48
would be nice. What's that product?

Matthias Miller  10:54
Radiation free to manufacture in different ways? Yeah, really,

Speaker 4  10:59
no with what I sent you last night of that email, Matt, I actually did it wrong. I should have went in the Items page, and that's what I'm working on now, but I had two hours worth of forklift certification. But I'm going in and clicking on each item on the page you sent me through the email, and I'm going in and changing sizes and putting the camp size and all that. So it's going to give me, I mean, I'll need a little bit of time to finish that off. I just did something. I did it on the page you sent me, rather than going into the item specific item page and doing it. I mean,

Matthias Miller  11:40
that's the thing, probably see Ida. I mean, type of Ida.

Speaker 4  11:46
Let's see it's showing in sewing prep, and it should be solid, it should be showing in sizer prep.

Matthias Miller  11:52
Well, I can add advisor prep column here

Speaker 4  11:58
in the page you sent me, that page that you sent me in the email, yeah, yeah, and that's what I told MERV yesterday. Rather than jumping back and forth, I said the ones that are already established have that you can highlight and open that box up, but the ones I gotta add to you mean that box not there. I

Unknown Speaker  12:26
copy. Matt, okay, make

Matthias Miller  12:35
sure. Don't know what your internet's like when you see it, just what you think of that.

Unknown Speaker  12:39
We'll look at it. Well, I'll try to get there. Are you?

Unknown Speaker  12:45
He's on that page? Should

Speaker 1  12:46
I go to that page and refresh it? Matt, here it. Yeah. Here we go. Sizer missile, wait, right here. Wait, that's new home. What did you add?

Unknown Speaker  13:00
Matt, Oh, this one right here, yeah,

Speaker 1  13:08
here you go. Does that solve Yep, sure,

Speaker 4  13:13
yeah, yeah. I just gotta get down through the ones I didn't do last night that I did last or yesterday afternoon, and then just, you don't mean put them in there.

Speaker 1  13:22
Matt, sorry if you had a response. I didn't mean to cut you off. So So Matt, on the on these pages, I feel like I think I understand when I come on a page like this, and if I want to shrink a column, I can always go shrink the column for that session, but then it'll always go back to the original size. Is that right there?

Matthias Miller  13:51
Hard way to make sense. Make that configurable, that way.

Speaker 1  14:00
Um, I don't know, George, do you ever, do you ever want to shrink the columns?

Unknown Speaker  14:05
Well, I spread them out. I don't shrink them,

Speaker 1  14:08
really, yeah, yeah. But, like, if I'm working here, there's too

Speaker 4  14:11
much information in the size or prep, or sawing prep, I have to, you know, man, I gotta type some more stuff in, or see what it says, because it don't, you can't say yeah, I understand, but I don't know. I never, I don't think I've ever shrank yet. I always expanded.

Speaker 1  14:28
Well, like, some of it's just like, size or yeah, anyway, sometimes, but no, man, I'm fine with it the way it is. I just want to confirm, and I ain't George is too Yeah, we're good.

Matthias Miller  14:42
All right. There's something that gets used a lot, that a lot of different people and and some people want to see something and all that stuff. The platform does have tools that each person set up their own views so they can, they can put stuff around. They can show and hide stuff and all that. But that that needs to be set up for each Okay. Individual report,

Unknown Speaker  15:00
yeah, no, seems good,

Speaker 2  15:05
but it Yeah, sounds good.

Speaker 1  15:08
Alright, okay, yeah, that's I'm good. I'm good for now George is working on but yeah, you need anything else from us right now, other than keep Sure. I'm sorry. George does have a question or two.

Speaker 4  15:26
Alright, Matt, I put an RW West 1291 it's a new print that I just put in today, brand new. And when I went down to the sizers, it gave me the drop down box to put what type of fastener in, but it will not. There's no box opening up for how many fasteners it's getting in the price of the fastener, right? But there's no boss. I don't know what happened since last time the

Matthias Miller  15:58
changes because of breaking.

Unknown Speaker  16:11
Let me just give me one minute off.

Speaker 2  16:36
At the item RW West, 1291,

Unknown Speaker  16:52
all right,

Speaker 4  16:56
and then just the second item I had just it's a more of a finger typing situation when I'm into the when I'm putting all the numbers and I can't I say it's the audit, but it's not The audit.

Unknown Speaker  17:19
The Yep. Give me one sec. Matt, cut list yield.

Speaker 4  17:27
When I'm doing that and I'm doing the gang saws, I put the total total amount of quantity, or total quantity of cans tab, and then put the quantity of yield in. Then when I hit tab again, it goes to the right hand column for the quantity. And then I then I hit Shift Tab to go back to put the quantity cancel in. Is there any way that you can do quantity tab yield and then hit Tab or enter. When I hit enter it, it does something goofy. It doesn't get it like right down to the next quantity of cans. If you follow me. Now, if I can't keep hitting Tab, it'll go out. Then I gotta shift, shift tab back three times to get back to the quantity again, it just seems like it's going backwards. I got to do backwards when I go to the next cell. Yeah, you do. Or is that the way? Is that the way I have to do it?

Unknown Speaker  18:42
Right? Now,

Speaker 4  18:45
and I'm fine with it. I'm getting I'm getting pretty good at it right now. But I was thinking of feeling, yeah, and

Matthias Miller  18:54
I don't know what to tell you, I wish I had a better I was like, down, down, down. Shift path, down, down down, shift that down, down, down, down, shift that right.

Speaker 4  19:13
Other than that, I think that's that's it for Now,

Speaker 2  19:20
yep, yep, yep, yeah. Arrow down, not arrow down.

Speaker 4  19:55
Any anything else, yeah, not that I know, I think I said. For me. Thanks again, Matt,

Speaker 1  20:05
Hey, Matt, good stuff. I'm good till Monday, as far as I know. Yep, I'll try

Matthias Miller  20:11
to get the rest of what I need, especially on the overhead, other things like that.

Speaker 1  20:16
Yeah, overhead on my side. Matt, again with like, do you? Do you? Would you advise me, I still didn't have a real reckon, I had one sit down. Would you advise me to dig around that sort of the overhead parameters at this point? Or do are you, or should we get to the sort of where we have everything else kind of flowing, and then I'm not sure

Matthias Miller  20:45
it doesn't make any difference to me, we can. I don't mind throwing just thinking up over that. Don't be throwing it in and pretending it's right knowing it's wrong.

Speaker 1  20:52
Yeah. So if that's a feasible way to continue, if that's a practical way to continue, then I'm probably not going to dig around at this point further. Yeah, at some point I want to. I mean, that's up. Yeah, that's another subject, right?

Unknown Speaker  21:10
So, yeah, yep. Okay,

Speaker 1  21:14
awesome. Thank you, man. Hey, again, again. I hope. When does your mill show up out there? What time of day

Matthias Miller  21:23
today, and it wasn't there today. I won't double that for next week.

Speaker 1  21:31
I'll double back with Rick, and I'll try to get a real confirmation on the most likely post date and see what I can find out. All right, thank you. You bet See ya.
