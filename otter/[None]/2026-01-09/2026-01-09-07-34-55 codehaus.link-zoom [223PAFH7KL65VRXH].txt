Unknown Speaker  03:42
Howdy. Howdy. I time for, boom, flip, at

Matthias Miller  03:49
least I put it up this time, hey, hey, this is, this is ran random, not fully random. But I just want to say I love working with you, and I hope the experience has been mutually beneficial. Well. Thank you. I was thinking yesterday about about the clients I have experienced, the I don't know, who just have been the best to work with, and I made the list. You made the list. Man. Oh, thank you. Maybe prompted by some clients who've been creating a little bit of shenanigans recently. So maybe that's impacted my thoughtfulness around this matter.

Speaker 1  04:36
But who's who's creating some shenanigans? Well, our friends over, over there in Ohio,

Matthias Miller  04:43
no, okay, Nope, don't ask, because you're getting here full and it's probably not okay, really helpful.

Speaker 1  04:53
All right, you know what? I've talked about this enough. Changing subject. I've talked about this enough. I'm going to if. If you can, if you can, just keep this

Matthias Miller  05:03
to me, I'll like 1055, 1055, okay, so, dude, look at this. Look at this. Man. Cus DEP, 93 700 Should we send it. So

Speaker 1  05:27
is there? Is there, is there? Is there money remaining in this like or is it says security deposit balances is zero. So this would have been paid off already.

Matthias Miller  05:35
These are creating the contracts. We haven't put any payments. I'm planning to create them with zero value.

Speaker 1  05:39
And then so you're going to, you're going to generate the money into it based on payment history. Then, yeah, oh, dude, I like the way you think. Send it.

Matthias Miller  05:49
Send it, all right. Import buddy. Hold on a second.

Speaker 1  05:52
Yeah. Would it be valuable to go back and establish zero terms for

Matthias Miller  06:01
that's an option. We could try Zero. What's gonna let's see what terms. Let's see what happens.

Speaker 1  06:07
It looks weird to say to see there's 36, more months left. But then again, what if? What can you derive from the contract that you're generating? These four that they went alongside to see what

Matthias Miller  06:19
we don't contract. We might have to figure that out later. It's too confusing right now, like it could be for multiple contracts. I don't it's just, I don't know,

Speaker 1  06:28
yeah, it just looks to see 36 months remaining.

Matthias Miller  06:33
Hey, it lets us do zero. No. Okay, hang on. Asset ID is required. I told you not to require that city.

Matthias Miller  06:49
Oh, boy. Oh, hang on, this thing's not getting set. That's why.

Speaker 1  06:56
Because, I mean, I could very quickly go through and add terms to the rent to own companies for a zero term.

Matthias Miller  07:03
Okay, now taxes, we don't have a tax exempt setting,

Matthias Miller  07:13
so maybe what all we really need then, though, for tax exempt is just a effective tax exempt checkbox that hides everything down. No, you still need to know where to file it, though, yeah.

Speaker 1  07:30
So you would fill in your states, county and city, and you could just put us a rate in of zero. Can we do a rate of zero?

Matthias Miller  07:36
Yeah, we could do a rate of zero. Okay. So, oh, this just makes me happy. So you can get a zero term. Let's go. Does the account have a tax zone, or does the tax expression? RP, source data, we look at the tax zone to silver LOD to tax soon. That's that sort of stated history tax rate. Well, let's go see if we have it. Let's actually go to this guy. Let's just try this state so that doesn't have a state I'm

Matthias Miller  08:26
tax this doesn't have a tax zone on it. We could wait. It's never posting revenue, though. Should never have tax liability. I should message Seth, well, actually, that doesn't matter. I mean, he's handling that. Let's go to the cockpit. The only thing I would know is try to find one off of the customer and see if we can. I love how this just goes through random column.

Matthias Miller  09:14
Okay, I

Matthias Miller  09:25
What if we just put the word exempt in there, in where the state, okay, oh, or deposit, or just cussed debt, because it's not, it's not taxable. You don't have to file anything that's right. Oh, but state is a that we could do the contract state for the state that would make sense, and then we could do.

Matthias Miller  10:06
And then this would be 00, tax city rate. So Tennessee, zero customer deposit zero. Customer deposit zero. Other, Na, okay, how are you like now?

Matthias Miller  10:41
Mean, likes that one likes that one

Matthias Miller  10:54
send it. Oh, these guys. Where are people who don't have well, I'm going to assume, I

Matthias Miller  11:07
don't know for sure. I'm going to assume I think, I think when you drop off, I should take a look and see, see what it takes to get the nightly imports running and see if that's why these names are missing. No, we didn't think that was the issue, though,

Speaker 1  11:22
maybe we should find out. Are we certain we have a customer to tie it to? Pretty certain.

Matthias Miller  11:35
Count, 44834,

Matthias Miller  11:43
i Jessica Lewis,

Matthias Miller  11:50
okay, let's do this.

Matthias Miller  12:00
Understand this. Why do we have two imports for customers?

Unknown Speaker  12:10
I think he was only adding it's,

Matthias Miller  12:12
I think, oh, only importing the previous account number, right?

Speaker 1  12:16
I mean, that should be part of the original customer import. But long term.

Matthias Miller  12:25
Okay, well, let's go see if we can find this. Do you see Jessica? I

Matthias Miller  12:43
She's, I mean, she wants to be here. Oh, unrecognized, no. Alt name. We're not handling the alt name. She should be in here.

Unknown Speaker  13:01
What's the customer's name?

Matthias Miller  13:04
Jessica Lewis, new record. It's actually, she actually exists.

Unknown Speaker  13:11
So why is it not tying out?

Matthias Miller  13:16
Okay, let's go find Jessica Lewis. Jessica, Jessica, a Jessica. Jessica,

Unknown Speaker  13:33
yeah, she exists.

Matthias Miller  13:38
Contact. RP, source, customer, d4, 43, oh, we set the silver loom ID to the wrong thing on the import.

Matthias Miller  13:57
This imports wrong. No, it's not

Matthias Miller  14:08
I'm smoking. Look at customer, 4483, please.

Speaker 1  14:16
4483, we're looking it up in only or in RTO pro RTO pro

Matthias Miller  14:25
cricket valley. It looks like if that helps,

Speaker 1  14:27
doesn't really matter. I'm going to ask you that Id one more time in here, in a second. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Okay, no, we don't want that escape.

Matthias Miller  15:02
Escape Jane Shane, DOE, okay, which makes me wonder if he's a fictitious Okay.

Unknown Speaker  15:17
Also the account number 4483, no record for this account number.

Matthias Miller  15:25
It's a deleted guy. Okay, give me the name, Shane doe, DOE, DOE doe, comma. Shane, no spaces.

Speaker 1  15:42
So why? Why have these deleted? Why does he still exist in the database?

Matthias Miller  15:51
Well, I mean, he had, we have money for him,

Speaker 1  15:56
so he went in and out. So in other words, they put money in and they took it back out.

Matthias Miller  16:02
Let's go find our there

Speaker 1  16:20
has to be some sort of indication on the on the record that says he was, like, we should ignore him. I mean, 500 out, yeah. So it's we that we can straight up ignore that.

Matthias Miller  16:35
Okay, you don't care if we have payment history for deleted accounts.

Speaker 1  16:38
Well, we have payment history, but it's it's essentially a zeroed out account, and it's deleted out of RTO pro database. So by all intents and purposes, we thought he'd no longer exist. But do we have any indication on on the source data from him that would give us an indication that he was deleted. In other words, can we? Can we, if we find more of these, can we refine it to well?

Matthias Miller  17:06
I mean, we could, if we can ignore any history, any rows for for customers that don't exist.

Speaker 1  17:12
Well, as long as we're 100% certain that we don't have an import flaw, that we're missing a customer inside of only Well, I mean, so let's, let's just, can we do a quick evaluate? Is there, is there more of these? Oh, yeah, there is.

Matthias Miller  17:33
I got lots where they can come from. This

Matthias Miller  17:41
is just on the customer deposits. No, this is actually the entire, ooh.

Speaker 1  17:46
So anything. So all of that from that on, point on,

Matthias Miller  17:50
yeah, but they might be different. Andre Kirkman account, 4013

Unknown Speaker  17:59
4013 let's go see 4013 he exists.

Matthias Miller  18:07
Oh, he exists. 4013 Okay, okay, let's go find well, maybe, but, but this one, maybe, maybe it is just a delay since we update. Imported. Is it a recent contract? No, no.

Unknown Speaker  18:25
His is that this is from 2023

Speaker 1  18:34
well, okay, he would be, he would be, he was closed in 23 he would be outside of your need for creation

Matthias Miller  18:46
Transaction Date. Let's see. Look at Transaction Date for Andre. We have a transaction for him on the 2024, 11

Unknown Speaker  18:54
history lesson. So what is the

Matthias Miller  18:56
January 11? We have a We paid him, yeah, yeah, yeah, the rest of his security deposit.

Speaker 1  19:01
Yeah, that's when he was closed down. I'm sorry. I mistake I told you. I mistakenly told you the incorrect thing. Okay, so double negative. Does that make it a positive ever mistakenly told you the wrong thing? Does that make I told you the right thing?

Matthias Miller  19:17
Don't make me think. Don't make So

Unknown Speaker  19:23
okay, so give me, give me.

Matthias Miller  19:24
Andre Kirkman, okay, it's just an he doesn't have a valid email, and so we failed because his valid email wasn't valid. So what? What do we want to do with invalid emails? We can screen for them and put them somewhere else, like in the notes, just invalid email colon.

Speaker 1  19:53
So why didn't that fail on on the contact creation

Matthias Miller  19:58
it did. That's why it does. Make Oh,

Speaker 1  20:01
got you, yeah, if you don't have a valid email, then stuff it in. If you get it, if you get a flag, are you saying, if we get a flag on invalid email, we can just stuff it in the notes and disregard it. Yeah, yeah. Let's do that. Feeding group.

Matthias Miller  20:34
Here, skip if it's not valid email, and then

Matthias Miller  20:52
okay, how do you like me now? How do you like me now, contact notes is not editable, so we have to put it somewhere else. Where do you want? Where do you want it? Let's go into summary,

Unknown Speaker  21:10
a summary, summary. We're

Matthias Miller  21:11
not using it for anything else right now.

Unknown Speaker  21:15
Can we can we tag it with a invalid quotation marks in there, just like that.

Matthias Miller  21:23
That's like this, yes, yes, yes, yes, indeed. The other option would be to see if we could put it in the this.

Speaker 1  21:33
Can you do it in the in the email notes? Yeah, I was wondering that without actually adding an email,

Matthias Miller  21:43
Ooh, let's do that. Let's do that. I like it. I like it a lot.

Matthias Miller  21:57
Sorry if it's anything we want to skip. And then I come on. I want to type. Man, let me type.

Speaker 1  22:11
I have a, I have a, I have a platform suggestion, yes, you should be able to type in the little window and have have it search the like, what, exactly what you're doing here in the larger window without hitting the FX button. It should work both ways. You could expand it and type in it will, it will search for the what you're looking for. But you should also be able to do that in the little window out like without popping into the larger section as well. That would be cool. Do you know how many times I go, I go edit something in a column, and I was like, I just want to, Oh, I gotta pop it open so I can find what I'm looking for.

Matthias Miller  22:48
That would be cool. Yeah. I don't know how you make the screen space work, but I appreciate the idea

Speaker 1  22:53
you understand. You don't understand what I'm saying, right? Yeah, yeah. Like, right about in your manual change expression, right? Now, if you could just type in there and it would actually would

Matthias Miller  23:03
actually, it would do the right, because that one is bigger, that one is big enough. I was thinking single line stuff, right? Yeah, I agree, yeah,

Speaker 1  23:10
just stuff him in, yeah. I like that. I like that a lot. I like a lot.

Matthias Miller  23:16
Okay, so this guy are, we are for sure, setting we're not setting the original con the should we be setting the contact, the original account number here?

Unknown Speaker  23:35
This is, this is the original

Matthias Miller  23:37
it's, oh, it is, it is setting the original thing here. Never mind. Why?

Speaker 1  23:40
Why did he create? I don't remember why we created a secondary one.

Matthias Miller  23:45
Let's go find out Dwayne and Nick. Do you remember why you created a second x 34, previous account number? Okay, tell me I'm not on a one of my client VPNs messes with with signal,

Matthias Miller  24:15
put space in there, see if it runs now.

Matthias Miller  24:25
Here we go. Okay, all right. Well, I vote to send it that probably took care of a bunch of and now

Matthias Miller  24:40
that's going to take forever to run.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
No this thing, that's right, it takes unbelievable amount of time to run

Matthias Miller  24:52
well, but that doesn't keep us from running this other guy. It just, it's just going to blow up on these blanks. So.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
So we'll just have to come back and rerun it once the other one's done.

Matthias Miller  25:03
Yeah, but we need a way to determine whether something's legitimately deleted true. So what we should do, though, is and is an A and RP source data, custom R, RP, source cusp and the X fine field, source data, deposit customers by account and store.

Matthias Miller  25:50
So the only exclude payment rows for accounts that were deleted in our PO

Matthias Miller  26:22
note. To do not check contacts, since it could be missing there be because because of import errors or because of mismatched logic.

Matthias Miller  26:46
Bullet Proof. Don't you know your bullet proof?

Matthias Miller  26:59
Okay, there's still some here, but that'll get fixed. Let's go. We're gonna, let's bring this system to its knees. If we can,

Matthias Miller  27:17
it's bringing to its knees. Well, actually, let's, let's spot check a few of these. I know we did. We already did. We feel good about it. Run, send out, oh, you're cooking now. I love it, man. I'm happy with this approach. I hope you like it.

Unknown Speaker  27:41
Making, making contracts for

Matthias Miller  27:45
Non non, yeah, these boats

Speaker 1  27:47
with, with zero terms, then we're going to write, we're going to write the ins and outs of it for payment history. I like

Matthias Miller  27:52
it just maps across and so payments just work. Asset ideas are required. Field, no, it's not, you stinker. I'll show you what's required.

Unknown Speaker  28:05
So how do you get around? How do you get around it being required?

Matthias Miller  28:09
We don't require if it's if, RP, source, history, set, Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. I'll show you. Oh, sure, yeah, alright, send it. Send that thing. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Okay, so there's that, that one's running.

Unknown Speaker  28:31
That's what Trump said when he saw the drug boats. Send it

Matthias Miller  28:37
15% Oh, good gracious. It is definitely something with the RG, we could probably substantially simplify the RG.

Speaker 1  28:48
What which RG is that? Are we talking about? It's probably,

Matthias Miller  28:53
it's probably phone. Well, yeah, it might be email to phone and email, yeah, I I don't know. It just depends how much speed matters on this thing.

Speaker 1  29:09
Well, in the future, okay, once initial where it's going to get, where it's going to be painful is, I guess, well, initial imports are going to be what's what's going to get grumpy about it. But I mean, ideally, when we, when we onboard a client, we're just going to be like, Okay, we're going to hook this up, we're going to we're going to push,

Matthias Miller  29:32
Oh snap, I did not think about that. We need to. How do we want to do this? We want to filter by,

Matthias Miller  29:52
okay, it's the I'm.

Matthias Miller  30:00
Macro we went this is the look his subset.

Matthias Miller  30:16
Only look at rows that have a deposit and CRA, but no contract, okay? And then we're also going to do a model where we do RP source data history. We're going to do a min on our key source data, history, hokey. So this is ARP, low ARP source data, hist, MIN HO key, by account model you want to use the low kiss subset, and we want to group by hist, Minho key. We want to group by history account, which is a number, so we need to make a string. And then here and that guy, that guy and model group value, this string, this equals the hokey.

Matthias Miller  31:53
Okie dokie, he didn't laugh. My humor is failing. Okay, oh, you froze. Did I freeze? Did you freeze? No, no, you're just rest, thinking, resting, relaxing.

Speaker 1  32:12
I was I was the I had mental disengagement. That's all good.

Matthias Miller  32:21
Liminal processing is what they call it liminal, liminal, l, I m, I n, l or something. I don't know. There's got to be some kind of smart, smart sounding term for Okay, 51 I would expect that here. Oh, that's more than what I would expect. 25 start date. Okay, we do have some other issues. State is missing in some cases, and start date is missing in one case. So let's go to start date this guy. No, we're looking for a start date that is missing. We have everything but, well, that's That's understandable. We're missing the primary customer. Wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  33:28
Oh yeah, that's that guy is missing

Matthias Miller  33:31
because he literally is missing because he literally Why is he still in this

Matthias Miller  33:41
shouldn't this payment be excluded? Oh, I did customer deposit. Wow, sure, we have a customer deposit by him. Cust. Cust, count, index, find f customers by account, but this should be by account and store right

Matthias Miller  34:21
for four, we should always double check store, yeah, we should double check store, huh?

Matthias Miller  35:00
Will double check store as well. Okay, so then repeat source data. This would be the customer store. Okay, customers and now you are false, awesome. Okay, that's that state I'm going to guess is actually contract state. Let's find out who's not getting the state.

Matthias Miller  35:37
Thanks. Just hoping you would do if California, okay, now it's, now it's a match. Maybe he moved, hold on, hold on,

Unknown Speaker  35:59
what? What is that? Let me give me a 7100

Matthias Miller  36:04
what is it? 7100

Speaker 1  36:08
Oh, His address is California. His building location is Illinois. That might be valuable information to store somewhere. But

Unknown Speaker  36:28
since RTO pro doesn't give you a secondary address field,

Matthias Miller  36:37
okay, why is this not sending? I

Matthias Miller  36:50
record. It's not updated. This is weird.

Matthias Miller  36:59
Here. Let's do this. Is

Matthias Miller  37:07
very perplexity there, okay, well, fine, okay, okay, primary customer, we have 37 because there's one down below this. One has 37 37 is there a sorting issue with this? Not really. It's just weird sorting on the errors, okay, and this then should be, make sure we're saying 36 so who's the who's Number 37

Matthias Miller  37:49
state, one of

Matthias Miller  38:01
the What am I smoking?

Matthias Miller  38:10
We have

Matthias Miller  38:16
855, plus, 1470, plus. That's a thing of beauty.

Speaker 1  38:19
A thing of beauty a thing of beauty. When you look at the contracts and you can see the customer depth, 93692, a thing of beauty.

Matthias Miller  38:30
Customers by RP, stores by RP table. Sid, rental company by central server. That's fine. Event, source, RP, RP, silver lining.

Matthias Miller  38:52
Okay, all right, so now this is what we were really after now for the for the fun stuff. Oh, my cow. Rec, no rec, no type in key.

Matthias Miller  39:14
Rec, no rec, no hokey, hokey here, let's do

Matthias Miller  39:29
rec, no central servers by store by contract, accountant, store, account, dealer tables by ID looks fine. Hokey, event ID, okie setting, name, contract,

Matthias Miller  39:52
rec, no rec, no rec, no okie dokie.

Matthias Miller  40:06
Okay, so as I was saying before I so rudely interrupted myself, payments, contracts,

Matthias Miller  40:23
we should then be able,

Matthias Miller  40:35
From the primary contract, contract import, to say not is in a RP, source data, contracts, contract ID. No, that's not contracts. We were no, there's something else. What am I missing? I

Matthias Miller  41:20
do you remember what sent us down this customer deposit spiral?

Speaker 1  41:40
Because of trying to define the ins and outs of very complicated accounts,

Matthias Miller  42:00
Are you regretting this? No, I'm not regretting. I'm just trying to find my place, like we were just importing contracts, right? Yeah, trying to figure out this. But we were, we were trying to figure out,

Speaker 1  42:10
because of the movement of money in and out of of a bunch of things, it's, it made a whole lot of sense. Let's, let's pipe all the money into a contract, then we'll move it from, we'll use that to pay out into the other contracts.

Matthias Miller  42:23
So we do need one other filter here, which is basically the This guy.

Matthias Miller  42:59
This guy, we also need to, and I'm

Matthias Miller  43:07
assuming we need to avoid contracts for accounts that were deleted in RTO pro,

Unknown Speaker  43:13
you have avoid, sorry, say it again

Matthias Miller  43:17
if I assume that we might have contracts that live in the system, that don't

Speaker 1  43:22
that were also deleted as well. Yeah, um, the potential exists if we have deleted contact records, it would not surprise me if you have deleted contracts,

Matthias Miller  43:36
just thinking more contracts with deleted customers. But, oh,

Unknown Speaker  43:43
potential exists.

Matthias Miller  43:44
Let's go find it. Let's go see what this shows then, yep, we do double check any of these does.

Speaker 1  43:56
What's this does? Does? Do show up in here, dough doesn't Okay, so give me, give me something to look at.

Matthias Miller  44:04
Catherine Richardson, account number 3973

Speaker 1  44:11
3973 exists as a customer.

Matthias Miller  44:18
Oh, these are ones that what that's fine. Do you have a company? Wait a minute.

Speaker 1  44:28
3973, yeah, 3973, exists. It was paid out early. Yeah, 397, account.

Matthias Miller  44:40
Do count, is she under overhalt? Yes, is her customer and her contract under overhalt? Yes, B, 973, okay, let's go to the.

Matthias Miller  45:25
Stove

Unknown Speaker  45:32
customers,

Matthias Miller  45:54
you, lady,

Matthias Miller  46:02
still, store, store to

Matthias Miller  46:12
count, but this the contracts For store five, and she's for store two.

Speaker 1  46:20
Oh, really. Well, she was obviously entered in the wrong company, then apparently deleted because she also should have a customer record for

Matthias Miller  46:33
store five, and what's her customer number in store five? I know what it is, okay. Tell me what it is. Give me a minute. Let

Unknown Speaker  46:57
me prove it okay. What is it

Matthias Miller  47:03
we're deduplicating. We're only importing by account. So I

Matthias Miller  47:30
Okay, that's it.

Matthias Miller  47:42
So going to do this, and then we're going to fix, going to fix the missing customers.

Matthias Miller  47:58
All right, send it.

Matthias Miller  48:07
Actually, let's go to

Matthias Miller  48:15
shared primary. Do you know how treacherous this? I mean, this is just, I'm sorry data like this is just a Flog.

Speaker 1  48:35
But I don't correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think anybody else can actually do this besides you? Well, I thought, I thought we, well, we got some of it done, Nick, but it's like, no,

Matthias Miller  48:49
you're, I mean, there's, we're at the point of, like, there's a high degree of complexity, and I don't even understand what I'm tapping into. But there already is a contract. I

Matthias Miller  49:14
i love this though, because it is, it is surfacing some issues in our on our end, I um, why is it not? Nah, you've been confused. I just haven't any anything, the clue stuff,

Matthias Miller  49:50
that how you like me? Now I don't know. How are we going to get rid of those old.

Speaker 1  50:00
Contracts, yes. I was like, okay, confused. You said he's been confused. And I was like, ah, nine. Ain't the right word even hoodly.

Matthias Miller  50:10
Hoodley, which literally means, like, messy, like, yeah, disorganized. Wow, that's, that's a room. That's a word my, my mom would have used for my bedroom, not my brain, but

Speaker 1  50:24
they list five different adjectives for confused A, E R R, or just a R R, Ethan R, Ethan R or Ethan where or war

Matthias Miller  50:39
would be good or verwort vert, that's the German

Speaker 1  50:49
bedroff Ich bin Bedros.

Matthias Miller  50:53
That sounds like you're trying to

Unknown Speaker  50:56
but hoodly. Hoodling was one I knew for certain.

Matthias Miller  51:01
I love that one, I guess, I guess you would use for hooded,

Unknown Speaker  51:07
oh yeah, for hooded would be, yeah, he's been for

Matthias Miller  51:11
hooded, that's more like, that's more like, that's not just confused, trying to understand. That's more like, oh, I don't know

Speaker 1  51:23
their huddle well, did you I think it's actually,

Matthias Miller  51:31
yeah, Dutchess, but yeah, bare hooded or something?

Speaker 1  51:36
Yeah, it depends on, depends on your region, or photo, but

Matthias Miller  51:43
that has it.

Speaker 1  51:45
Have you used the PA Dutch dictionary? Yeah, there's a, there's a website called pa Dutch dictionary. And every once in a while, I just, I just, it gets, I get, I get, I go over there and I just go around for a bit and see what I can find.

Matthias Miller  52:06
Okay, I have a proposal that we delete all contracts not tied to your awesome rental company, okay? And then and re import, okay? Because it's not it didn't. We didn't. We didn't set the linking field.

Unknown Speaker  52:23
Well, do best net for huddled now.

Unknown Speaker  52:32
Do best net for huddle right now.

Matthias Miller  52:38
Okay, brother, company does not equal Dwayne's awesome one. Okay, I just kind of want to make sure we got that squared away. I would prefer not deleting your contracts. I guess we could always restore from backup, but that would

Matthias Miller  53:00
be a pain. I now it's

Matthias Miller  53:09
going to create new records everywhere.

Matthias Miller  53:20
Oh, and I lost my customer deposits. That's easy to bring back.

Speaker 1  53:50
What he has a spell checker for Pennsylvania Dutch that you can download and import into paper office.

Matthias Miller  53:57
Okay, did you know side note? Do you want to know who wrote the spell checker for the Pennsylvania Dutch Bible? Who you're looking at him.

Speaker 1  54:08
You wrote the spell checker for the Pennsylvania Dutch Bible? I did.

Matthias Miller  54:13
I worked with the what Hank, Hank and Ruth Hershberger. This is back in the early 2000s probably.

Speaker 1  54:26
So who was, who was, who was compiling the act, the correct spellings

Matthias Miller  54:31
they were, they had their dictionary list,

Speaker 1  54:35
and how in the world, like for somewhat of a colloquial language, how in the world did they actually come up with actual spellings of this?

Matthias Miller  54:43
I mean, this is, this is all Wickliffe does. That's what they specialize in, yeah. How do you take a spoken language and make it a written one? Okay, yeah. Did you know that the Bible app has, has a has a Pennsylvania Dutch Audio Bible on some of their books? No, are you here? Let me, yeah. Let me. Me see if I can pull it up for you Bible version, either you version one, yeah, you version has Bibles in Pennsylvania, Dutch, English versions. You get Peter that so

Unknown Speaker  55:28
how do you find it?

Matthias Miller  55:30
Other languages? You go to the Bible, my versions, more versions, and then you can just, actually just search Pennsylvania Dutch.

Unknown Speaker  55:42
No, kidding, Pennsylvania Dutch. I should

Matthias Miller  55:49
make Dante wants to learn Pennsylvania Dutch. I should make him read along with the Bible, listening to audio and like the Gospels, that could actually kind of work that's funny. Oh, we have errors, not surprisingly,

Matthias Miller  56:20
made a clean up or, well, we're not going to be able to what was this one? I don't know what this one was. We're not going to be able to do much until the did the

Unknown Speaker  56:38
customer thing gets done running. Oh,

Matthias Miller  56:41
and we can't cancel it because,

Unknown Speaker  56:46
well, I mean, at a time anyway, so

Matthias Miller  56:49
Okay, well, I feel really good. I feel like we're actually, it's, I'm still a little nervous about little edge cases here and there, but we're getting pretty close to being able to start importing payment rows. Yeah.

Speaker 1  57:00
Do we have, we have Monday, right? Is it Monday? We do have, we do have Monday? Yeah, so, all right, well, Monday, then, all right,

Matthias Miller  57:18
this will be sweet. This will be fun.

Speaker 1  57:21
It's exciting, man. I mean, we're, I feel like we inch closer and closer. Yeah, it's, thankfully, this is not throwaway work. That's the, that's the exciting part.

Matthias Miller  57:32
Yeah, the ability to to, I mean, this is exactly what, what's his name from the other RTO company was talking to me on, you know? Oh, this

Unknown Speaker  57:41
is, this is, this is what Ryan gray wanted you to come do.

Matthias Miller  57:44
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, he didn't know I could do it. I didn't open my mouth. I was like, I'm not, I'm not breathing a word of this. But this is exactly what you wanted me to come do for him.

Speaker 1  57:55
So how are, how are they? How are they doing it? I mean, obviously, are they just all manual?

Matthias Miller  58:00
I don't know. It must be, I don't know. Dump it in Excel. I have no clue how they're doing it. I don't have a clue. Or maybe they have scripts. I don't know. Oh, man, I just can't imagine. I can't imagine. I mean, there's a lot of things I can't imagine. I can't imagine trying to go straight from RTO Pro. I just can't imagine not having the middle layer. I just can't there's so much stuff I can't imagine anyway. Well, you don't have to, yeah, I could only imagine

Speaker 1  58:38
the question. The question is going to be the moment we start. Well, I know there's already individuals that want to come back, want to come from RTO smart, and so figuring out how to most of those are going to be end up being smaller, and we're probably going to just end up, like, dump, dump some of your stuff into CSV files, and we'll just sort it out from there and push them in in those kinds of imports. All right, um, Monday, then have a have a good weekend and talk

Matthias Miller  59:10
to you Monday. All right, awesome. Have a good weekend. All right, yep, bye.
