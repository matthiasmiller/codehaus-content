Matthias Miller  00:41
This is Mark. Hey Mark Smith ice. But how

Unknown Speaker  00:51
are things going to get back into the groove? Is it kind of seems like a normal again or like the new normal or with family and everything or?

Matthias Miller  01:11
Oh, it's pretty close, I think if if anything

Unknown Speaker  01:24
Oh, well,

Matthias Miller  01:27
I don't know this is I'm definitely pulling the the Napoleon rule at this point, which is I still have a bunch of emails back in my inbox. And I'll probably get to them at some point. And if nobody else is if nobody's screaming, there's a good chance that a good portion of them have resolved themselves. So appropriate philosophy or serious what's going on right now?

Speaker 1  01:58
Yeah. What is the Napoleon rule?

Matthias Miller  02:04
It comes from, I mean, I don't know that it's an official rule. But story tells it that back when Napoleon was conquering, and he'd get a message about something being wrong back home, he would wait a month to respond. And if it was still an issue, then he would address it. And if not

Speaker 1  02:26
worry, I've, I've I've had stacks. I'm notorious for creating stacks of work that you know, someday, and I need this and I need this. And then several months ago, I put a box underneath my desk. Coffin box, I think there's different terms. And I said, Okay, anything that is cluttering up my desk that anything, but here's the place to put that stuff that I just can't get myself to throw away, but I am not getting to it. And I have not one's going back into that box yet. So obviously wasn't too important.

Matthias Miller  03:12
I love it. I've got a friend of mine who years ago ran an ad in I believe, was the New York Times classified ad and something like, you know, tired of clutter called Barbara you know, high 51234 and started an organizing business. And she frequently talks about the cost of clutter, says clutter is always expensive. And yeah, there's a lot of things that are easy to hang on to because we think someday might sort of in priorities shift and change and it's just

Unknown Speaker  03:50
not necessary anymore.

Speaker 1  03:53
Yeah, there was a Leonard meter he's passed on now but he was an AF an advisor for AF one seminar I heard him talking about clutter like he goes to help these clients sometimes that have these massive stacks of paperwork and ethics are buried underneath and he likes the day when for whatever reason that that's that comes crashing down or somebody bumps into it, that all falls down and then if he didn't say much more than that, but just I think there's an opportunity to rest important

Matthias Miller  04:37
Yeah. Well,

Speaker 1  04:41
you tell me where you want to start, I send you kind of a jumble of stuff. I send you some of the stuff you'd seen. I think you've seen pretty much everything other than the two flowcharts that I gave to Josh yesterday just to kind of show him where how my brain is thinking on some of these processes and then Elsa sent you the?

Unknown Speaker  05:02
I think it did. I sent you an agenda later. And I know you also went through, and you went through and reprioritized or read or updated a bunch of

Speaker 1  05:24
things on the design proposal yesterday, so leave it in your car, whatever you think is best. Or

Unknown Speaker  05:35
All right, let's start with priorities I think.

Unknown Speaker  05:54
So

Matthias Miller  06:07
do the copy the design proposal with dates and assignees. Ben, can you export that as a Word document, send it to files in suit?

Speaker 1  06:22
Probably do this in your sleep by now, Ben, I've been asking for numerous times, and probably will continue to and even more often, that's all right. If you

Matthias Miller  06:39
wanted to start automation speaking, we, we could set up automation to email it to you at you know, certain points during the week. Always get a refresher.

Speaker 1  06:52
I mean, we, we we do that with a number of other a handful of other reports that from assist for sending Excel files.

Speaker 1  07:10
I mean, if you know how much work it is to do, I don't I probably say if so let's plan to plan to send it

Speaker 1  07:23
in Thursday morning or twice a week. Long as I know what the schedule is, then. I guess we could keep it simple and just do it every morning. At what time does the other stuff sent 430? I think like 430. And then I'll just hit the file. And if days I need an updated copy or one and I'll get a copy of it another day. So I'll just start

Matthias Miller  07:52
that fair? Yes, that's pretty easy to do. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:59
So

Matthias Miller  08:03
testing accounting in the live system. I don't see a problem with scheduled weekly updates at this point is Jeff Josh is fine with that. I can't think of any reason not to do it in the live system at this point. It's pretty localized. I think one of the big concerns had had been with multiple companies. And then there were some issues and we were doing a lot of development in the core accounting system. That's not happening anymore. i

Matthias Miller  08:42
No, I have a problem with that. I think

Unknown Speaker  08:46
I kind of feel like

Matthias Miller  08:48
this is one of the things where it's probably just as expedient to go ahead and do it and figure out then what problems we run into and fix the problems when you run into them. It is trying to figure out what to do in the first place.

Speaker 1  09:03
Yeah. I mean, when we talked about it and Josh's nurse familiar with what we're doing is is you are but the the only thing that I could think that it would impact would be this point would be finished goods inventory. values. And as we speak, we're still just at the end of every month pulling those out doing our own calculations in spreadsheets, which is need to do it's not the long term. Plan of course not but that's the only area that I can think of that it would make it better don't know where you was it on the call or dash afterwards. I think you had discussed like how are we going to clean up old data so that we don't have things carrying over into line 24. Like, obviously, whatever we, if we put some, but test data, say on the balance sheet for 23, it'll Of course, it'll carry over into 24. Same as what you will figure way out in that out as the need arises, or as we get to that point.

Matthias Miller  10:33
There's, yeah, there's one of two options. One is, we can start a new company. So put everything under a, I don't know something like a ABC 23 company, or affordable barn, and then switch over to a new company, once we get there and deactivate the old accounting company, and adjust all the settings that point went there

Unknown Speaker  11:01
or

Matthias Miller  11:07
and, and at that point, you can even leave my gut reaction is well, or we can clean up old transactions and create deltas for 2023 to make sure that it all balances out correctly. Okay, I don't really have a preference.

Unknown Speaker  11:31
Good.

Speaker 1  11:33
Might just the other thing that Josh pointed out is that, you know, we call it testing, but there's also a ton of setup that's going to need to happen from Drew's side. Get ready for this. So like, you know, setting up vendors setting up the chart of accounts, seeing all of that stuff up in the live system. So my preference, knowing that I think I would guess we just plan to set it up correctly from the get go. And then as we get to the end of the year, we'll figure out what we need to do to make sure that we're everything's clean to start 24.

Matthias Miller  12:12
That seems pretty reasonable. One of the nice advantages of this, then is that if at any point during the week, if you want to test the peripheral payroll verification tweak or something like that, we can copy the live system to test we don't have to do fancy exports and imports. And you can test the live system with the new changes and that would be

Unknown Speaker  12:33
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:37
How's that for sales pitch?

Speaker 1  12:41
Well, that answers because that was the one downside that I mentioned to Josh like, if there if if we need to make tweaks then we aren't able to do it as rapidly as we are when we're test environment we'll have to wait to an update which I think that's part of the reason why he's Why saying let's have a scheduled weekly update. But yeah, we hadn't thought about that. Or at least we didn't hadn't discussed that. So that would you're saying copying the live so it would go something like this we run into a snake and who are Ben's Oh, I know how to fix that I'll make a change the test system and then copy live system over into the test system. And yes, there's a Yeah, that does exactly what I want and then that update gets scheduled for or that change gets scheduled for next update to the live system and everything's good yeah. Yeah, I like it. Good.

Matthias Miller  13:55
And we've got some other outs there's some hot fixes we can do but

Unknown Speaker  13:58
yeah, I think it's good

Matthias Miller  14:03
true testing and implementing accounting module two days per week if we

Unknown Speaker  14:10
are

Unknown Speaker  14:19
so

Matthias Miller  14:19
I would be available for a 10 to 1030 check in and a naked actually do the check in

Unknown Speaker  14:37
at the same times

Unknown Speaker  14:40
on Fridays

Matthias Miller  14:42
on Fridays as well. So what you're thinking that we had those check ins and well

Speaker 1  14:48
that's good to know. I have not talked to drew it about that. I know that Fridays is usually he kind of leaves Friday opened up for things he doesn't get done. first four days. So knowing that, it could, I was thinking just a half day Friday, so probably just one. One of them either the 10, either the 1030, or the three. You have another day that I think if you have another day, that's let's, if you're good with that, let's plan for. As he gets back, I'll ask him about Friday. And then if that doesn't work, then we'll go from there.

Matthias Miller  15:34
Yeah, well, let me know my schedule is pretty flexible. Would you be open to moving our Monday call to whatever day he's working? Or would you want to be keep that available for or do you want to stay available to help him with stuff that he runs into?

Unknown Speaker  15:59
Okay, you're saying dropping the Monday call. And just

Matthias Miller  16:03
know, let's say that he, let's say that he works on on Friday, since I'm already in payroll in payroll accounting mode on Friday, moving our Monday call this Friday, as well.

Speaker 1  16:16
And then doing Wednesday, Friday? No, I that that would work. And you want to do is like one to

Matthias Miller  16:28
probably earlier that. Well, I'll have to take a little bit of a look, I probably want to do it earlier in the day if I could. If possible, I think let's do this. I mean, I currently have a reasonable flexibility. I have some one off days where I'm out or have things blocked out here and there but I've got reasonable flexibility in my regular schedule. And so why don't you check with him? See if he wants to do that. See when it would be what a good time for you and then circle back and and then we can coordinate the rest of the schedule from there. Does that sound good?

Unknown Speaker  17:04
It does Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  17:09
All right. So things that we have this gets us down

Unknown Speaker  17:17
into

Matthias Miller  17:21
let me pull up the project

Unknown Speaker  17:25
you and

Matthias Miller  17:29
let's start with this priority on the chart of account questions. Is that a must have by September 30 Or is that a nice to have by September 30

Unknown Speaker  17:41
for these changes

Speaker 1  17:45
it's a must have well I say that without knowing the implications and what we're dealing with this has been a thank you Andrew maybe have worked on this a little bit I'm just wanted to get it on your radar and I think I know much know what he's running into so yeah

Matthias Miller  18:09
I'm gonna put your question in here first of all and then let's take a look at this

Matthias Miller  18:28
revenue

Unknown Speaker  18:30
income

Speaker 2  18:46
Okay. All right. So we'll get to that.

Matthias Miller  18:53
So here is seems to me like

Matthias Miller  19:06
we should perhaps consider having a separate call that's devoted strictly to project management and where things are at and what needs to be done kind of a project management update. And

Matthias Miller  19:24
seems to me like probably the biggest question I have, apart from some of the design questions in this particular question is where we're at on

Unknown Speaker  19:34
on

Matthias Miller  19:36
finishing off FTA allocation and Testing, testing that in the test system are now in the live system testing FTA allocation and a sync to accounting. Ben, do you have any update on where that is?

Unknown Speaker  19:50
No,

Speaker 3  19:55
not yet. I should check in with the

Unknown Speaker  20:02
With CPI

Speaker 3  20:03
and find out from them kind of what they're looking at.

Unknown Speaker  20:11
And then there was

Speaker 3  20:14
one other thing that you had that Holly you and I had had Matthias there was a plan to Nick. I just realized that the other day as far as I know, that hasn't gotten there either. So I think we're still waiting on developers for important fixes at this point.

Matthias Miller  20:32
Let's take a look. Oh, that was on the contacts issue.

Unknown Speaker  20:37
That was

Speaker 3  20:39
the just I can I can find it the FGI issue will go on to you and I had the

Unknown Speaker  20:46
call about

Speaker 3  20:50
ontact issue was the one that Joel had taken a look at Yeah, accounting reconciliation giving errors because it was trying to import the header for the

Unknown Speaker  21:04
report it was throwing everything off

Speaker 3  21:12
but there's no update on that one in the incident

Unknown Speaker  21:20
let's see if

Matthias Miller  21:25
let's go over those things at the bottom of the hour. I probably should check in with you really early this morning on that. I guess if we didn't had a stand up call we'd have caught that so let's let's take a look at that once we get off on this call and see if we can make any headway.

Unknown Speaker  21:41
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  21:47
then Alright, let me take a closer look at your questions on the chart of accounts then mark

Speaker 1  22:09
think from what you had said the biggest thing was of subtypes of subtypes or types I don't the income statement you only have income and expenses. Biggest one was the cost of goods sold can this be added as a subtype? Sure.

Speaker 1  22:41
Or I guess I should I should a little differently. That income statement example. We took our chart of accounts that we build out and put together but it basically put it dumped it in a spreadsheet to just at all will this work for a Are we missing anything if we had an income statement that looked like this that had these breakdowns and then I highlighted in yellow what that who that was couldn't do like either didn't know how to or the system

Unknown Speaker  23:26
should do this

Unknown Speaker  23:42
I'm going to go ahead and

Matthias Miller  23:47
share my screen at least for Ben so you can see what's going on

Unknown Speaker  23:59
just straight up copy this over

Unknown Speaker  24:10
I think it would be more helpful if I sent you

Unknown Speaker  24:21
out of account file where we actually

Matthias Miller  24:32
I'm going to say at the bottom it should say oops that should say net revenue is that right

Unknown Speaker  24:42
net so looking at my example

Unknown Speaker  24:45
net sales Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  24:49
Yeah. net net revenue or total revenue. I don't know is that okay? What? Let me know I should have sent you something else, let me I'm gonna send you something, another file that I think.

Speaker 1  25:54
30 seconds is good for exercise. So we have the little raspberry pi that Josh set up, we moved it out of my office to a more central location. Now, when I send a file, I have to get up and walk about 40 feet. So it's great. Okay, let me know when you get that and then we can I think

Unknown Speaker  26:21
the last go

Speaker 1  26:36
I have I know I have some hidden columns. Well, so what I want to start with is in column C now.

Speaker 1  26:53
So those are our call types. I'm not sure what your what you're calling it. But I think of the entire chart of accounts basically as a filing structure. And on the in column C, we have the five master holders of the five big categories that always have in in accounting that assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses. I think those as far as I know, those we match or that those are not. That's exactly what we want. That's exactly what any module has, correct? That's right. Yeah, I think where are we then if we move to the next to column II, the subtypes? We have you have a predefined list of subtypes for each type, correct?

Unknown Speaker  27:58
That is correct.

Speaker 1  28:02
And I, I can't remember. I think at one point we said, we asked the question, Can Can we add or edit any of those tonight? The answer is yes. But if that Okay, so that's where I'm going with I think starting any current assets, fixed assets, those are all good their current liabilities long term liabilities, equity revenue. I'm going to I'm going to stop there and if too many questions at one time, first question, can those subtypes be edited? And I guess to what the name change or the Add subtype?

Matthias Miller  28:55
Um, the half hearted answer is or the nuanced answer is it depends. Some of these types do have special meaning in the system like accounts receivable, etc. So if there's a rename where it's named wrong, then that's probably something we want to take a look at and see and look about making kind of a standardized change. Now, if there's simply, oh, this is a missing type, we would like to have this type added. Well, that's a you have the you're able to add additional subtypes there.

Speaker 1  29:34
Well, let's let's just go through and are we going trying to go too deep like I would, what I'm suggesting is we just go through the subtypes. And review each one you tell me which we can or cannot add and then if there's one that we can, then let's talk about what about solutions? Or are we going trying to go too deep on this call to to look at these individually

Unknown Speaker  30:08
well I think

Matthias Miller  30:16
give me one second I'm going to I'm going to take a look at these and see none Okay, the most of these are new, the one that isn't is we say non operating expenses. And you say non operational expense.

Speaker 1  30:40
That's fine. Okay. So what do you have is really okay

Matthias Miller  30:47
so I think the real question mean and you can add all of those subtypes to the chart of account but really what you're asking for is can we add the subtypes? And can we have them show up on the income statement? Can the income statement also group by subtypes? Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Or no Yeah, so

Speaker 1  31:09
that is is correct so what what we're looking for in the income statement is so you have your your income or your revenue at the top and then your expenses broken down by cost of goods sold, sales expenses, marketing, fences, administrative expenses next to our little edge case, the Self Storage just acts around that. So the reason we're asking for that is fairly affordable barn company does has a project of developing the long term goal is figure out how to develop to buy a piece of land excavated and prep it and then put a bunch of storage units on there and turn around sell it to investor develop an investor that wants to companies that buy these self storage rental units where this is different obviously as it has individual units instead of a typical brick and mortar of where you have built the whole thing and then you fill it out here you have a 75 or 100 me basically modified storage units and so the that's the the long term plan because it there's potential there and we believe that if there is potential there it would be a good alternative source of demand for our product, especially in the offseason and things like this you could work in around lower times when when sales are during seasons when sales are lower the short term so that's the long term plan in that situation it accounting perspective. A lot of details but you'd basically be selling a bunch of buildings to a wholesale plant and it would all just you know, revenue cogs it all just worked fine. The reason we're in the short term, we have two locations that we're we are the landlord we're renting it out we're collecting the fees were so and we don't want those that income and expense water up to occur got our typical revenue and yeah, just because it's not our primary business model, and it would so we wanted to group these down here so that it's in a sense almost farms its own little any income statement. So did that play into why are the why and what we're trying to achieve here

Speaker 1  34:52
this was after we explained it to Larry Troyer, he said Well, hi, I would suggest you handle it, which is what we're So that's that's why we got to this because you're muted sorry

Matthias Miller  35:14
It seems to me I think it makes sense without going deep into you know this versus classes I don't know that we need to

Unknown Speaker  35:28
it seems to me like

Matthias Miller  35:32
ultimately what you need to do is

Matthias Miller  35:44
can we do something like all of our predefined

Unknown Speaker  35:53
subtypes

Matthias Miller  35:56
are in whatever order we deem best and if there's anything like I mean some of these are extremely reasonable reasonable and should even be here like current assets like why is that when not in there? I have no idea current versus long term liabilities I have no idea why not

Matthias Miller  36:16
but then for your own custom one so basically in the income statement, I don't know if this would the income statement we would show we would group by subtype perhaps always group by subtype I'm not sure where we would make a switch. I think it's a question for Joel as far as in Ellis's as accounting system owners and then on your custom subtypes, you could specify what order you want them to show up with the section. So you would have a I would think well and then you need to hang on let me check one other thing yet. So this one says okay so and then you would have to split out like so. Okay. That you

Speaker 1  37:10
if you're switching or going back and forth between the two there are I know there are some differences from what I sent you the file I sent you last and the human example Sure. We added on the go ahead the biggest thing that we added on the income statement examples are the like the totals at the bottom like the totals and the say the gross profit gross profit the total non operational or the total expenses operational expenses operating expenses or whatever that like those totals and then Net Profit and Loss down at the bottom so

Matthias Miller  38:08
how

Unknown Speaker  38:13
Yeah, not sure how that or that set like where do we that just baked into the accounting system like the gross profit number does that need to be that on the subtype well that on the subtype but But where's that are the biggest differences we're not showing that on the chart of accounts we didn't

Speaker 1  38:46
making this really confusing the last file I sent to you we did not list those totals and gross profits net profits just because are on your chart of accounts, but they're not worth anything to them.

Unknown Speaker  39:10
So

Matthias Miller  39:14
income statement would have revenue cost of goods and then gross profit after cost of goods then you'd have operational expenses

Matthias Miller  39:28
and operational income

Unknown Speaker  39:29
Okay, well, that's

Matthias Miller  39:36
I think I think the biggest thing here we simply we simply need to clarify what it is that we actually need one are looking for.

Unknown Speaker  39:45
Okay, so um,

Unknown Speaker  40:00
I think we should go ahead

Matthias Miller  40:11
and standardize some of these subtypes assets slash current assets absolutely we should be assets slash fixed assets should be liabilities slash current liabilities

Unknown Speaker  40:24
should be slash long term liabilities should be equity

Unknown Speaker  40:48
now when you get to on the one we have income and then revenue I think the

Speaker 1  41:05
probably just personal preference but I would prefer to see revenue or something like that all the way through just because but it can be a little confusing if you have income and then down at the bottom you have like you call it income which means all your money coming in and then at the bottom you call it net income like some bottom line is called net income so, I think it is a personal person I think just using revenue it's the money coming in it then you don't have that income and revenue also sounds just a little bit more sophisticated or professional maybe so that's probably why but

Unknown Speaker  42:10
I'm curious

Unknown Speaker  42:20
and then some people

Matthias Miller  42:25
so revenue I don't know that may make sense. So income is income is basically means net and revenue is the gross receipts essentially are like gross sales top line

Unknown Speaker  42:44
yeah

Unknown Speaker  43:15
Hey

Matthias Miller  43:40
then I would say that things like sales expense marketing expense, administrative expense, self storage etc non operational we need to also

Unknown Speaker  44:15
the income statement the following structure so you would have revenue, total revenue

Unknown Speaker  44:35
you would have cost of goods sold

Unknown Speaker  44:48
and you'd have operational expenses.

Speaker 2  44:57
Types Gmail accounts

Matthias Miller  45:05
so the operational expenses are.

Matthias Miller  45:21
Okay, so gross profit is revenue minus cogs, right?

Unknown Speaker  45:28
Correct. Yeah. Which is? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:34
And operational income is revenue minus cogs minus operational expense says.

Speaker 1  45:43
Yeah. Or, yeah, it's the same thing as gross profit minus operational expenses.

Matthias Miller  45:50
Right. Well, that was. That's fair. That's fair way to say it.

Unknown Speaker  45:53
Thank you.

Speaker 1  45:56
Well, no, I wasn't trying to. I thought I understood what you were saying. And I, I thought I'll, I'll say it this way to make sure that we're thinking the same thing. So obviously, we are

Matthias Miller  46:09
better so reasonable expenses and then net profit slash loss k and then I'm just gonna say for an example see,

Unknown Speaker  46:29
and then we're gonna do

Speaker 2  46:45
we had let's see where this is. I lost myself.

Unknown Speaker  47:00
So then here

Speaker 2  47:07
there was another expense thing. I thought I was looking at expenses. Now that's it.

Unknown Speaker  47:27
And then, do you care

Matthias Miller  47:32
when you add custom ones, like sales, marketing, administrative, self storage, etc? I'm gonna guess you do want control of how that sorts, right.

Speaker 1  47:46
I mean, where are they fall on in the expenses? Like whether self storage is above or below? Administrative expenses?

Matthias Miller  47:56
Right, or I guess you could handle that with account numbers, couldn't you? Well,

Speaker 1  48:03
that was my question was going to be my question. I mean, if we can, and that's, that's all good. And well, yeah.

Matthias Miller  48:15
That seems pretty. Good. I like your answer. That gives you control over that. Now.

Speaker 1  48:31
I'm not sure which which report you're looking at. I'm kind of going flipping around here. But I'm going back to seeing that. Like, do we know what we truly want? If the but yeah, the answer is really close. And the closest would be the income statement example that I sent to you. Is an on that one. We did we did. Okay, we did go ahead and number. Put a number to each number, the types the subtypes, the parent accounts and all this other accounts, and then borrowed it based on those numbers like like a multi column sword where you start on the left assets, the current assets, and that's what the way we numbered them. That's that's what we're seeing on the income statement. Sample. If indeed that numbering controls the sorting throughout all all of the even even in the subtypes.

Matthias Miller  49:54
Well, the subtypes we don't really assign numbers currently the subtypes

Unknown Speaker  49:59
Oh, Um So typically

Matthias Miller  50:08
we typically leading digit determines the asset, liability equity revenue expense

Unknown Speaker  50:20
and then

Matthias Miller  50:35
I wonder if what we don't want to do is just let you specify

Matthias Miller  50:50
the code on that subtype

Speaker 1  50:55
like a number code? Yeah. Well, okay, here's, that would be I mean, that's kind of where we're going with this whole GL Account thing is the, what we're buying a follow. Larry's advice is our we have numbers on our although we're not showing the main places here but we we have a set of numbers for assets are always five maybe or I think it's a two digit number can and then liabilities is 20 and equity income, or whatever the standard is, and then have numbers for current assets, a set of two digit numbers. And then when we get to parent accounts, we have three to everything from parent account on bank has always has a three digit number. And then what we The other thing we did is, so we have others, there are certain GL accounts like utilities. Data is something that we have listed in a number of different places. You have it in part of finished goods inventory as part of the production overhead, we have it as a sales expense as a ministry expense.

Unknown Speaker  52:24
And so we're using the same digit account type for everywhere for utilities. I'm just going to make up numbers. So let's assume utilities is always 260. And data is always behind it so that

Speaker 1  52:53
let's say sales is is 75. That's an expense which is. Having Do you have you have an account number something like 70 dot 75.2 60.3 100. And then if you have utilities data for administrative then the only thing that changes is your first set of numbers, or your second set of numbers instead of 75. For sales, it's 85 for administrative and then 85 to 60. That the 100

Speaker 1  53:37
is how we're hoping to use account numbers now. First question, rambling make sense. Second question is then is that how does that fit with? Like how USCIS thinks about the accounting module?

Matthias Miller  54:10
I fully got everything I think. Let me take a shot at answering your question see if it answers it may account account numbers. We do not currently try to assign any meaning to account numbers. And don't use it for anything besides sorting. Well basically besides sorting, so anything you do with account numbers is strictly for your internal accounting purposes and any kind of patterns with parent child account numbers etc. While this might not be quite right, we might have some validation as far as parent child account numbers, but I believe it to be pretty minimal.

Speaker 1  55:03
well that if okay so if it if that governs the sorting and also

Unknown Speaker  55:14
then then good there as far as only value that assists is to the account numbers is that determines how they're ordered.

Speaker 1  55:30
They can also be the people doing data entry can also enter could also enter

Speaker 1  55:42
like accounts using numbers instead of like the whole long string of of names right? Yeah. Is it not? Okay, that was the other benefit that we're hoping to be from this

Unknown Speaker  56:21
do you see?

Speaker 1  56:22
Do you see anything that far as the numbers go that we should dig deeper or?

Matthias Miller  56:34
I don't think

Matthias Miller  56:41
I think this is good enough to send a Joel he's probably gonna have some questions or concerns or input

Matthias Miller  56:51
one way to handle this

Unknown Speaker  56:53
is to group

Matthias Miller  57:02
that's quite right either.

Matthias Miller  57:13
I think this is good enough that we could put this into Joel squirt for feedback.

Unknown Speaker  57:22
And

Unknown Speaker  57:31
I'm going to

Unknown Speaker  57:40
sure LS.

Matthias Miller  57:44
And I'm also going to send you a copy of what I just wrote.

Matthias Miller  57:53
This is not in the proposal for the Senate change request.

Unknown Speaker  57:58
Or been

Matthias Miller  58:01
what you're getting copy of that as well. And then the change requests, I just added a link to this.

Unknown Speaker  58:11
And it's going to

Matthias Miller  58:16
be energy i. Elections. Okay. I think we're good on that.

Unknown Speaker  58:29
Now.

Matthias Miller  58:33
So that takes care of the agenda that you sent over.

Unknown Speaker  58:38
So we have

Matthias Miller  58:41
two options on where we go for the rest of our time. received eight versus going over the AP, AP stuff, or doing a deep dive into Joe's feedback on the cash flow statement.

Unknown Speaker  59:06
Thoughts on what we should, which should be first,

Matthias Miller  59:10
I cross your fingers. I think I have more energy in my head for cash flow statement than I do diving into the AP stuff, but

Matthias Miller  59:24
and we do have a deadline, getting that to him by I guess getting it wrapped up by the end of next week. So

Unknown Speaker  59:38
do you have any input?

Speaker 1  59:40
So no, that's fine. I was going to suggest we do the the accounts payable, but that they just because I think Josh is Well, for two reasons. One, I wanted to get your feedback on my kind of what I'm trying to do on the flowcharts and then Who is sounds like this is one of the first things that Josh is going to do which is but I don't have a strong opinion I agree it'll take a lot more probably take a lot more mental energy than

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
cash flow statements

Matthias Miller  1:00:30
well I feel like I don't mind digging into AP I do feel like I need a bit of a break if we do that if we can even take 15 minutes now take a 15 minute break and come back in 15 minutes and I can we have the assist the finance checking call blacked out and so I don't mind going for a little while then

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
what do we have blocked out for? Is that three to 330

Matthias Miller  1:01:17
yeah three to 330

Speaker 1  1:01:24
it could we Yeah, that's fine here could we could we do three to 330 I have something I need to get send out before three here and that would allow me time to do that. Yeah some other stuff if then I will back on this call at three

Matthias Miller  1:01:50
Okay, sounds good and appreciate it and Ben we can actually hang on here and let's knock a few these other things out as well and talk to you soon Yep, thanks Mark

Unknown Speaker  1:02:04
All right, so let's do this quick

Unknown Speaker  1:02:21
proposal

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
so we're gonna do a new tab template email template

Unknown Speaker  1:03:10
this would be this let's then

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
the Ask prompt name vs. Client proposal

Speaker 2  1:04:02
he usually likes them to be open text documents or whatever so that he can edit them I thought Yeah. RTF would be like

Matthias Miller  1:04:17
a word is like a Word document right

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
what I want

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42
hey

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
let's try

Unknown Speaker  1:05:02
Sure this is the right type the right

Matthias Miller  1:05:06
I'm always paranoid

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16
and maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37
she would have done

Matthias Miller  1:06:05
or where I can see

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
oops I can see these emails email send

Speaker 2  1:07:18
find this thing to share well it's pulling it up so not sure why I can't anyway let's not go into status stop trying to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
Nelson's server status

Speaker 2  1:08:08
I don't remember where these are there's a new way to view struggle emails but anyway let's see here came through yet still not

Speaker 2  1:08:40
operations services systems operations precedes

Unknown Speaker  1:08:56
I am so confused

Unknown Speaker  1:09:04
let's at least do this

Unknown Speaker  1:09:31
command explore an email and to shared

Speaker 2  1:09:43
should never have more than one but we'll do that anyway

Unknown Speaker  1:09:52
and we'll see what happens I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:10:05
Ah did decide to work with you that yes. Okay, good. Now the import problem

Unknown Speaker  1:10:30
I think once once we get

Speaker 3  1:10:31
those subtypes that'll take care of the items that I had exported before copying the live system over.

Matthias Miller  1:10:45
So we need to add the do we need to add subtypes back in? Is that the basic issue?

Speaker 3  1:10:50
Well, Joel's email said I ported it to you last week. Account subtypes need to be explicitly imported rather than implicitly added through the accounts import they also need the tenant indicator I'm not sure what's its Type Indicator

Unknown Speaker  1:11:10
and then

Speaker 3  1:11:11
the accounts import was trying to import using multiple processes in parallel unfortunately, that meant it tried to import child accounts the poor parents accounts were there and then it was complaining about being a parent account that lived through an implicit revenue so and he sent that to PCI Naki and said that they would

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
take care of those he Okay, let's do this. So this would

Matthias Miller  1:11:41
be from actually I don't know if this stuff exists anymore but we'll give it a shot

Unknown Speaker  1:11:51
nope

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
okay so

Unknown Speaker  1:12:26
I mean it I mean

Matthias Miller  1:12:27
it basically is just that Do you have a list of

Unknown Speaker  1:12:30
subtypes not

Speaker 3  1:12:38
just subtypes I still have the direct

Unknown Speaker  1:12:41
exports

Matthias Miller  1:12:50
could you throw that on Google Drive and we could

Unknown Speaker  1:12:54
grab just the subtypes

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
oh yeah

Speaker 3  1:13:14
just create a new folder and throw them all in there or is there were I should we

Matthias Miller  1:13:24
I guess we do typically have

Unknown Speaker  1:13:28
a place for

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
I document an applicant shared probably Yeah, just create an assist engineer let's throw it in there

Matthias Miller  1:13:55
that's fine as long as there's not any this is just test data right? Or I mean it doesn't have any

Unknown Speaker  1:13:59
Yeah, this is from the pet system. Okay. As far as I know, I don't know exactly

Unknown Speaker  1:14:05
what yeah, how it correlates with stuff in the life

Speaker 2  1:14:18
I'm going to go ahead and just throw all of my exports over there. Well yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
So we have

Speaker 2  1:14:58
let's just do the oh, we Do have a count taken subtype me try this file download Excel and inside browse new apps we're going to do an import and we're going up to the financial account subtype and we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  1:15:48
match records

Matthias Miller  1:15:49
we're going to skip on Match line we're going to create a new record

Unknown Speaker  1:15:54
to do ports without amplifier okay so then we're going to have a

Speaker 2  1:16:03
G, F and G so f and g this is called type subtype in

Unknown Speaker  1:16:39
I'm surely somewhere here we can count

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
you

Unknown Speaker  1:17:14
fine give me the new engine yep

Unknown Speaker  1:17:26
fan account type

Unknown Speaker  1:17:44
standing line no records

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
asset and bank accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09
I said to create a new record

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
oh this is system defined Okay, nevermind. So match records will skip it's so weird error message but it's true. I mean kinda true. A current asset

Unknown Speaker  1:18:29
All right. So let's run this thing and see if it works

Unknown Speaker  1:18:42
famous was last worst okay so Technium cannot be

Matthias Miller  1:18:54
empty well I don't know Well, that's fine. We didn't want empty in the first place. Okay, so

Speaker 2  1:18:59
I think we got them added let's go to

Matthias Miller  1:19:04
the subtypes and let's just make sure that none of them are supposed to be temporary I'd be surprised that they are but

Unknown Speaker  1:19:15
we don't even have an I think that's a new report.

Speaker 2  1:19:32
Report editable I forget how No,

Matthias Miller  1:19:36
equity is the only ones that allow probably equity only it's the only one that allows

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
temporary accounts. Maybe so. Yeah. Okay, so then.

Matthias Miller  1:19:52
So there's that one now. And now we have now we should also be able to

Speaker 2  1:20:01
Well, hang on. Do we know which company this stuff is actually supposed to be under? I'm not entirely sure.

Speaker 3  1:20:17
There are these companies, but I don't. And they do have one main

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
like, but yeah, I

Speaker 3  1:20:24
don't know for sure. Drew I've been I talked to Drew I think it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:29
was last Friday

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
because there was that one

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
that Joel had mentioned that

Speaker 2  1:20:43
the account was for

Speaker 3  1:20:49
FDI as its company and its parent account has tests listed as IT company somehow. And so I emailed drew about that one to see what it is but to be, he said that the companies were correct for the accounts.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07
And that

Speaker 3  1:21:12
he took a look at the chart of accounts for FTI company and most of them are missing, including the utilities account, but it's not a big deal on their end, they just use that company to set up some tests that they are not done with so it's fine. We don't need to go back and fix the chart currently working toward getting a real Chart of Accounts ready for the FP FP tax shed time companies so we can run real numbers

Speaker 2  1:21:33
through that one. So do we need good so it kind of seeming like

Speaker 3  1:21:41
maybe after all, not all the information needed in them anymore?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:50
I'm not entirely sure what were you gonna say? Um,

Matthias Miller  1:21:55
I mean, that sounds actually kind of right. Maybe we should ask Mark when it comes back on or maybe it's just a question for Drew once it gets back in

Unknown Speaker  1:22:16
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:22:18
He also said that commonly utilities would be an expense account and not an asset account they hadn't entered the expense account because they weren't using it

Unknown Speaker  1:22:30
so

Speaker 3  1:22:32
at least that one discrepancy seems like it was the result of they're throwing data in test not necessarily trying to get accurate

Speaker 2  1:22:40
yeah information but at least opened our eyes to the sub text issue I wonder what happens

Matthias Miller  1:22:57
if you sort sheet by Column

Unknown Speaker  1:23:01
A to Z

Matthias Miller  1:23:16
this is a little bit more sensible Alright, part of the issue actually is I think

Unknown Speaker  1:23:27
this

Unknown Speaker  1:23:34
actually stay there

Unknown Speaker  1:23:43
oops

Unknown Speaker  1:24:09
Right, yeah, let's do this to changes to screen report. That's pretty good. All right. Bye.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:44
Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  1:24:45
I mean, I think bottom line is we've done what we need to do,

Speaker 2  1:24:49
right? I think so. Okay. Sounds good. Awesome. Cool good and then yeah there's still that our was that context that we were talking about yeah

Speaker 3  1:25:11
reconciliation with accounting FTI reconciled accounting that was been

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
assigned to Nick. She will link or something car up thank you. I had written it while back

Unknown Speaker  1:25:39
what was the issue

Unknown Speaker  1:25:45
you should not try to import building

Unknown Speaker  1:25:57
all right.

Matthias Miller  1:25:59
Let me fix this. Take a quick break and I'll fix this and we're doing an update tonight.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05
We'll take care of it. Cool. Cool. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  1:26:11
Then proceeded back on and about half an hour. So

Speaker 2  1:26:15
yeah, that's right. Sounds good. Thank you. Thanks. You bet. Bye
