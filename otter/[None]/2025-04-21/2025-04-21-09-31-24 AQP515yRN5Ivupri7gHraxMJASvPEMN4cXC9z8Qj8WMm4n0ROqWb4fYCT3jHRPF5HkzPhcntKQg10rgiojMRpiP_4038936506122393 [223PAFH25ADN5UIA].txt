Hey guys, I am. Wanted to give you a sneak peek of what's going on over here. So I'm about to duck into here, into the tie dye sheep productions studio. And as a shout out, I thought I would give you guys a little bit of a tour of what it looks like. It's under construction. There's a lot of stuff going on, but check this out. How's this for super awesome over here, we've got a podcast studio, so if you want to look like see what it's like under the fine lights of the podcast studio right here. And that's not where I'm going to be recording, by the way, but check out this awesome space over here. There's a bunch of stuff going to be having a couple of sets that are going to be here, and where I'm going to be specifically is right over, right over there, from the awesome background. There's awesome lights, big light from over there, and more stuff underway. But one of the one of the one of the many amazing things that are happening at emerging campus. I got my office space downstairs, and wanted to give a shout out to Sage and for letting me use this space. And I'm getting ready to to get to it and record some awesome videos here. So take care, guys. Want to give you a sneak peek. You.
