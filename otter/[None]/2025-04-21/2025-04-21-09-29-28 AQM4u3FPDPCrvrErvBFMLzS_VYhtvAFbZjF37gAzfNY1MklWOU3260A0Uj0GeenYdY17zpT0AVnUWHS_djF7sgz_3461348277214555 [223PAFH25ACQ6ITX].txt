Hey guys, I had to get on super excited, and still need to go through the two through the homework, I'll be honest, but made a phone call earlier today, and or actually just got off a phone call, literally, like a minute ago, for an event we were looking to promote. The individual was was offering some incredibly helpful feedback and information on it. But then also looks like this, this individual may be very interested in opening up some doors for us with and doing kind of a regional, multi state kind of conference or or training. And so just wanted to share that testimony of you know, Pedro was talking this morning about sometimes your field of favor as a person. And very much, it's very much an example of that where talking to somebody can open up the right doors and super excited for for what's going on, and can't wait for, can't wait, can't wait to watch this develop. Do.
