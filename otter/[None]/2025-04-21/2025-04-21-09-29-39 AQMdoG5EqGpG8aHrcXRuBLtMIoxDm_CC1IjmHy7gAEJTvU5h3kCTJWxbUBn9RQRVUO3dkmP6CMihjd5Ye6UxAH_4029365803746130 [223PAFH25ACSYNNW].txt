Hey guys, wanted to say hi and check in say hello. One of the things that I here's a little story for you guys. But I was working on a project in my office and hitting a wall on it, just wasn't making progress on it in the way that I hoped to. And decided to step out and go for a little stroll and clear my head. And in doing that, actually got an idea to to knock out something that I've been probably struggling with for at least 30 minutes, maybe even longer, and kind of trigger this thought that busy is the enemy of productive thing. Many times, if you don't, if you're not intentional about getting the rest that you need, creating the downtime, creating the the Creating the right rhythms in in your life, you'll end up pushing harder than than you could, and getting lower level results than you actually, actually want. I think one of the battles that, or victories that I'm looking to to win, not just for myself, but for the people around me, is one against the tyranny of busyness. Busyness really is, I believe, an enemy. It's an enemy of creativity. It's an enemy of productivity. And saw that, saw that happening today. So I'm going back to my office now, working on another fun project that I actually can't wait to get to with a clear head and a lot more energy and super excited. So I want to challenge you to go ahead and find rest, take rest, create a rhythm in your day that allows you to to recharge, mentally, physically, whatever way that you need get recharged so that you can be the most productive. It's not always about pushing, pushing harder. It is, it is about creating the rhythms in your life that help you get the most done. So that's it. Wanted to encourage you in that and shout out to all you guys watching. Drop a comment below, let me know if you're watching the replay, and we'll catch you later.
