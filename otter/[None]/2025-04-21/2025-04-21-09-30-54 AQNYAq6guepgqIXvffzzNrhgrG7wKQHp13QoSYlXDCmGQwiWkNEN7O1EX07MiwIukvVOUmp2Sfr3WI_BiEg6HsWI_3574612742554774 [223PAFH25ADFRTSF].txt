Hey guys, so got a question for you tech people in here. I keep thinking about, I keep wishing for software like this, and I was wondering if any of you know of a service that exists. I come across a lot of different videos and sometimes even audio that I want to queue up and come back to later. And it would be super awesome to have a way to to to basically have an app where you can queue these up, kind of like pockets. So basically what pocket does is it allows you to save blog posts and other things like that and come back to them later and revisit them. It'd be awesome to have something similar for audio or video, where you can, you can quote pocket your audio or video and add it to a playlist, and it remembers your position, where you were at in the playlist, and allows you, then to archive those, those after you've, you've actually, you know, watched the videos. You could actually, technically, you could have a way to kind of create a private podcast, if you if you really wanted a simple, simple approach to make this work from a technological standpoint. But anyway, I was curious if anybody's actually done anything like this, or if any of you guys are aware of anything that exists like this.
