Alright, so I'm up here working through my homework and catching up, which is what we were encouraged to do this morning, and I wanted to do. So my goals for these next 30 days. There's two, two types of goals. I've got internal goals and external goals. Some of the internal goals are, you know, the reason I joined this and I actually went ahead and joined the 100 acceleration was I wanted to get close to the fire. I just, I've seen so much the importance of getting around people who are like minded and who are hitting the same place. And I really saw that. I needed that. And so that's, that's one of the major goals. And there's also another major goal, and that's just getting around somebody else who can see what I don't see and help me understand blind spots. You don't you don't know what you what you don't know. If you know that, you don't know it, you can go find the answer. But if you don't know that, you don't know it, then, then you don't even really know what to start looking for. So those are the two internal goals that I've got. The external goals is we're actually actively launching a virtual event, and and, and making some headway with that, and wanting to really generate, start generating revenue in my field of favor, and, and, you know, area of influence, so, so that's, that's the external goal. And then which of the stakes, if I had to say anything, probably the marketing and acceleration is one of the one of the stakes I need the most help with. But I think the other thing too, that I've probably struggled with a bit is is just tying all the pieces together and and kind of building, building cohesion between all of them. So yeah, that's it. Homework. Homework complete, and for that piece and really excited to be here and for what's coming this coming week, I.
