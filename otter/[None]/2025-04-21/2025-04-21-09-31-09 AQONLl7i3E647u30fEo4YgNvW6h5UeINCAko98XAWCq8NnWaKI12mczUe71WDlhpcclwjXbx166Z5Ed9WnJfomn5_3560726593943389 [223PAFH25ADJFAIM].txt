Hey guys, so it's been a long time since I've done a live in here and catching up, and wanted to touch base about some things, couple of things, I have my funnel running, and I'm getting what I think are really, you know, pretty good clicks, pretty good traffic on the LinkedIn side, through LinkedIn messaging ads, but I'm not getting nearly enough opt ins, not what I would expect. I'm not quite sure what to fix. And so one idea I did have was to do a giveaway funnel as a way to get market feedback and maybe offer to give away some kind of big prize, like a, I don't know, like an iPad Air or, like, I don't know what something like that in exchange for answering like, 10 questions on, kind of, what are they struggling with? What do they what do they want to see? And like, like, kind of, all those types of things, and just in terms of getting market feedback, because, like, clearly something is broken, and I'm really not sure where to, where to even start in troubleshooting it. So I thought there was something else I wanted to say here. With this, my mind's absolutely blanking. So there's my absolute blank mind in the middle of my life. Those are my questions. I guess, is there something on the funnel I should be fixing? Does the survey? Does the survey funnel? Like, is that a good idea? Like, is that something I should be pursuing anyway? If you guys have thoughts or insight, I would absolutely appreciate it do.
