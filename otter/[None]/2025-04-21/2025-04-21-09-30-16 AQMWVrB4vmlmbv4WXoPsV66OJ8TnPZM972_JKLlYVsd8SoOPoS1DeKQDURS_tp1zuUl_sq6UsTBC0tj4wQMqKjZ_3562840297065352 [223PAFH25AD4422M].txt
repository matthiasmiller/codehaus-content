Matthias Miller  00:00
Hey, good morning. Good morning. 100x super excited to be here, and finally, getting around to doing my intro video. So hi, I'm Matthias Miller, and I jumped into the six by six thing that Pedro offered as part of the part of the bonus. And so having a lot of fun in that group and looking forward to getting to know more of you. So I'm from Colorado. I live in Canyon City about probably about 20 minutes from the Royal Gorge, which is one of the favorite hangout spots when I need to clear my head. And it's a good reminder in places like that, that God, God is bigger than we are. And so fantastic. Well, and I got a view out my office of mountains. So hey, Isaac, yo, yo. Good to see you. I've got a question for you guys, especially for those who are who've been in the group for a while. I would love to hear you guys' feedback on how to make the most of 100x obviously, there's the trainings, and, you know, there's trying to, trying to spend time in the group here and getting to know more of you guys. But would love to hear your advice on how to make make the most of it, so drop it in the comments and looking forward to spending the next year with you guys. Take care. Bye.
