Matthias Miller  00:00
Alright, guys, I am a newbie here, so here's my intro video. My name is Matthias Miller, and I'm from Colorado, just about 20 minutes away from the Royal Gorge, which is where I love to spend some of my extra time. We run a software business, doing a custom business management software for small and medium sized businesses. And I'm really here because we have hit a major bottleneck on fulfillment, and we gotta get this straightened out ASAP. And actually didn't realize how bad this problem was until I was got started talking to Cory, and even even since that been thinking more about this and so super excited to be here. The other thing we're hoping to get is is getting some clarity on the sales process and how to get some more of that that stuff dialed in. So that's me super excited to be here, super excited to connect with all of you guys and have an awesome Tuesday. You.
