All right, so just got off of live webinar call with in in my Facebook group with nonprofits who are, who are working on, going virtual during this time. And here's one of the things I decided to do this week is we're going to start doing some live hot seats for nonprofits who are, who are wanting to work through practical issues. And we've got our first one scheduled for tomorrow, and more details are about to show up in the group. But if you are, if you're running a nonprofit, or you know somebody who who's running a nonprofit, and they need support in this area, this is an absolutely fantastic way to avail yourself to some help. We're going to get, get people some answers and get them moving forward. So tag them in the in the comments, if you're one of them, join the group. Hop in and let's we're here to support people this week. So let's do it. Sure.
