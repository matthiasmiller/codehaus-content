Hey guys, I just had to share this. So I was going through my contacts list, and going down through I was like, throughout the people who who saw my funnel, saw the order form, but didn't buy and so I what it did was just called it the first person and asked to talk to to the person by by name, and just using kind of all that stuff to to get, get past the gate keeper, get to the person, and started this conversation and and then just asked her. I was like, why didn't you I saw that you saw the order form that you didn't buy, why didn't you buy? And I just wanted to get your feedback. And she was like, Oh, I was, um, I was on Facebook and just going through stuff, just scrolling. And I'm not on Facebook much, but I saw your ad. And I was like, that looks really interesting, and I've got time to kill, and and everything like, and she starts naming different things, like, like, your internet, like, we're having trouble with our international team, and because I saw that, and like, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, you were talking about that, and, like, all this stuff you were talking about. This is me and and, and I, and I didn't sign up because I left my credit card in the car, and I just forgot about it. So I just a simple thing like this is as easy as I know this is just getting people into into a challenge, but, but to get traction on this, just something as easy as picking up the phone and calling them and finding out why they didn't buy it can be as simple as just having left their credit card in the car. And so I'm going to I can drop her an email with a with the link to sign up again, and she can go, she can go straight back and sign up again. So anyway, again, more validation for the offer, and looking forward to continue to hone this. You.
