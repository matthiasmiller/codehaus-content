Hey guys, just wanted to check in a little bit, about to head out for a little bit, and haven't had a chance to catch up on everybody's videos, but was looking forward to doing that later this evening. I wanted to get some feedback and working on mapping out my challenge. Tentative name is the Dream Team Challenge, and I've got three taglines, and I can't remember all of them, but, but would love to have your feedback on that, and I might spend some more time, like kind of working through what that should be or could be, and want to keep refining kind of the problems that I think I'm solving, and absolutely love the the challenges course, and getting a lot of clarity with that. And so if you guys have any kind of input, I would welcome that. And I am looking forward, once again, looking forward to responding to to more of more of you guys's videos and catching a little bit. Have a great evening. Bye.
