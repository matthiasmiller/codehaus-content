Alicia, I saw your video about the pivot and what you guys are wanting to, you know, thinking about doing, one of the things that I thought about when you were doing that is that one of the things Pedro's talked about, and he talked about the training on the training again today, about how people want to avoid pain more than embracing pleasure. And I think this is any Annie mentioned how entrepreneurs are wild, wired differently, and are more pleasure driven than than most people. But you could do a challenge around, I mean, because you focus more on man kind of management and protecting, you could do a challenge centered around how to kind of protect your finances. So how do you, and maybe, if we're like more middle to upper class income earners, where it's not necessarily people who are as entrepreneurial, but how to manage and steward their their finances, to protect it, and the which is kind of what they want, and maybe have kind of a course or something around going more in depth in management of that. But then part of what they need is one of these major, I mean, one of the most expensive things, and one of the, one of the one of the most expensive things that you can do in terms of your your personal net worth, and all of that is going through a divorce. And so part of the part of the prevent, prevention of that and protecting your financial assets is, is you know, kind of the practical tools of building out, you know, building out a healthy, strong relationship, and making sure that you guys, you know, that the couple stays on the same page, and all of that stuff. So anyway, that was kind of an idea that popped in my head. So, Blessings to you guys as you kind of work to figure this thing out. I.
