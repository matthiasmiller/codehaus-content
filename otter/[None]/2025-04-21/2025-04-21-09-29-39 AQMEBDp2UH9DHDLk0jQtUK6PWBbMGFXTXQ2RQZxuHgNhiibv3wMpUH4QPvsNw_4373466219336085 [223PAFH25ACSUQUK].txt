Hey guys, good evening to you guys. Happy Thursday. So I've got a question for you. I just got off a call with somebody that I was talking with earlier this afternoon, and kind of pushed me towards doing this live video. So got a got a question. Need some help. Give me some insight. Give me some feedback. I've collaborated with a billionaire to help businesses beat their competition, and basically just wondering if I should share this with people. So if you guys are hopping on, let me know. Drop some comments. Let me know you're here. And this is, if you guys saw my post recently about getting off of the hamster wheel. Think this is one of there, there many keys you need to know the right key, but this is one of the keys of getting off the hamster wheel is when you can find a way to definitively beat your competition. Competition, intense competition, can be fun and exhilarating, but it can also put you into this race to the bottom, and the one of the keys to building sustainable, healthy growth in your business is finding a way to to not just, not just edge forward past your competition, but find a way to definitively separate yourself from them. And so we've, we've collaborated together to to create a tool, and not only to, well, I'll just leave it at that. So if you're interested, if you think I should share, drop a comment, or maybe I should just keep it to myself and experience the benefits of it myself. Don't know. Let me know. Have a good evening.
