All right, hey, so here's my response to Alex's challenge, letting you guys know who I am and why I'm here. So I am. My background is in software, and did not realize I was an EPT until about three years ago, and stumbled along trying to find my way and on this path of entrepreneurship, and just last month, actually launched a new venture, doing podcast editing and figuring out a whole bunch of stuff with with marketing that and getting that off the ground. And so the reason that I'm here is because I think more than anybody else, Alex is definitely helped me understand who I am and but I think, I think the real reason that I'm here is because I, I feel like I've struggled more than most, implementing these things and making them a regular part of my life. And this kind of stuff is extremely difficult for me, and I'm, I'm extremely add and and have a difficult time focusing. And I'm in this group because I was actually in the beta group, but I'm in the in this group now because I wanted the ongoing support, and I wanted to be surround myself with people who are aware, who are present, who don't just focus on working insane hours, but but focus on creating momentum. And you know, there's, there's just no, there's nothing, nothing like putting yourself around people like that to give you a boost of momentum. So thanks Alex for for putting together the momentum master class and looking forward to continuing to integrate this stuff in my life. I.
