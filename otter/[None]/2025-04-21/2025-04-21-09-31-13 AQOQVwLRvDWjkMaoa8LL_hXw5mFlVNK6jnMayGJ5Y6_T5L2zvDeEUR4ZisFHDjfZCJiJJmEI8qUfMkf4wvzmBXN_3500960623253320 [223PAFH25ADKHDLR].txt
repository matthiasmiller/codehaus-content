Hey, good day for 14 friends, friends and family. So what are you doing to get more seed in the ground? Well, here's what I'm doing, the training last night, the Q and A last night was absolutely what I needed to continue helping me move forward. So what I'm doing is next week, I'm launching a a master class, and this is kind of an early launch of this, and I'm planning to niche down, but so that I can keep moving forward and don't have to work on on mastering ads. Right now I'm doing this to people who are in my network. And it's the the training is on supercharge, on on supercharging your team and, and this is anyway, $47.05 day masterclass in depth, planning to add some bonuses in as we go, and planning to develop the content as we go. So I am actively working on on keeping it as absolutely simple as possible. I wrote copy for it yesterday, through the to the copywriting challenge, but also just planning to reach out and invite people that I think would be a good fit, and see how many people I can get on and it it's a great way to start extracting all of the all of the stuff that I've got within and putting it together in a format that can help other people. And this is my way of getting seed in the ground. What's yours? You.
