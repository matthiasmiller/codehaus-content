Hey guys, so quick thing email is the bane of my existence. I am not wired for that, that kind of that's not how my brain functions, not how I work and all this stuff, and it's always been frustrating for me. So for the last few years, I have been working hard to tame the inbox and all kinds of craziness to get myself out of there, and we've gotten some really amazing success with this. So here's what I'm thinking. I'm floating the idea out there no promises yet, but curious, for those leaders that I'm friends with or who see this video, how many of you would be interested in a three day training where I take you deep into into email annihilation. That's the name of the course that that I'm that, that I'm looking at potentially building, and all the other things that I do to take control of my inbox and keep it from ruling me, and making sure that I rule over it, anything from kind of high level, kind of the high level perspective, but then also some really tactical pieces, as far as you know, how to manage that, or anything like that. So if that is something of interest to you, it would be kind of a early release, kind, of course, you know, kind of, kind of like a beta release or something that you get to be a part of. But if that's something that interests you, then drop a comment and and let me know, and I will be working with my team and seeing what we can put together on that. So let me know in the comments. You.
