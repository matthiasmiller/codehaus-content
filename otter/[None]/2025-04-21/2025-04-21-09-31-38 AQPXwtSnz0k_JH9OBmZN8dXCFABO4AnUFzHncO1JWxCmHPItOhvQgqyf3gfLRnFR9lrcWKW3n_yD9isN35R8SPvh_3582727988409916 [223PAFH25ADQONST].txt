Hey, Rick. So good morning. I just had this brainstorm. You talk, keep talking about your miles with miles. I had to think about your idea that you had about the daily meditation app or something. And so this is, like, one of those things, of like, I just got to throw this out there. And I'm not, like, expecting you to do anything with it, unless you want to, of course. But wouldn't it be cool to have a miles with Miles, like a 30 day miles with Miles challenge. And so you kind of get the the the effect of walking a mile every single day, and and then you also, you can also maybe curate content from from miles. And you can maybe even partner with with Monroe global, or whatever their whatever their organization name is, and maybe get an affiliate on some miles, mile, some miles teachings or trainings or something like that. You could have a and I'm sure there'd be some kind of way that you could integrate some of your own like voice, voice stuff, as as part of this. Anyway, it was just kind of this brainstorm. It's got a really catchy name, and I've actually been doing some variation of miles with Miles myself and and I find that super helpful. And it could be, it would be a lot of fun to be able to do it as a group and share kind of insights and takeaways as part of that. So anyway, just wanted to share that idea. We can I.
