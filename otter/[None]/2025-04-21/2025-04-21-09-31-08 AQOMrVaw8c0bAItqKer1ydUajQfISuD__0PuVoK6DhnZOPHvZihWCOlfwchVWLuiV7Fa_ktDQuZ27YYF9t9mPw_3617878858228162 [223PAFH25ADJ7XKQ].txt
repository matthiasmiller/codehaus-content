Matthias Miller  00:00
Hey guys, so I've been wanting to catch it with homework, and haven't done it. And I suppose this, the session today, was just kind of the incentive to get rolling. So my introduction, Matthias Miller, I'm here from coming to you here from Colorado, and I work with child service nonprofits. And just recently, got done doing my own challenge on drink, how to build dream teams, and also doing some training, kind of in parallel with this challenge about helping, helping nonprofits kind of implement some of these same strategies into their organization. So definitely here to learn, definitely here to to kind of, kind of maximize all of that, and kind of make, I don't know, just continue, continue gleaning. Have been privileged to be hanging out with Pedro and one of one of his coaching programs, and some of his one of his coaches. So that's me. That's that's who I am. That's what's up. Looking forward to, yeah, looking forward to what's coming the rest of the week. You.
