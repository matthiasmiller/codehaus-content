Matthias Miller  00:00
Hey guys, wanted to quickly introduce myself, Matthias Miller, from Colorado and super, been super excited and to be in this group and been consuming a lot of information. But wanted to give a shout out to Pete Vargas and Pedro Adeo and their and their team, and Jen Olson as well for the huge boost through the love serve, grow, challenge and through the KBB Fast Start bonuses that they offered, getting into this, I am actually right now putting together a virtual event for next Friday and and I have not gone through all the content, to be honest, but I've been using a lot of that stuff from, from those, from that group, from or from, from both of those, both of those bonuses and putting together this thing and getting a tremendous amount of momentum. So big shout out to you. Also, big takeaway from this, it's been listening to the the Tony Robbins mindset training has been absolutely transformational for me. I did not realize that I had that much, that much of of a mindset barrier, and it's been absolutely fantastic to break through that, and I'm approaching this event with much higher confidence because of that and because of the support that I got getting into this group. So want to encourage all of you guys, keep keep pushing, keep moving. We're in a time of incredible opportunity right now and and what an amazing opportunity in time to be serving serving people who desperately need what we have to to offer them. So that's me. Wanted to say hi, and that's it. You.
