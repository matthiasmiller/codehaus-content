Hey guys, just a quick update. And kind of feel bad because I haven't been as present in this group as before. But anyway, like this is life. Life is getting crazy. Life is good. Life is wild. I just got done doing a training for the kind of as a bonus for people who signed up for the for the movement maker challenge. That I realized as I was going through this training up, I put together a homework, kind of a homework sheet with some of these things. One of the two things that I went deeper into, one of them was kind of what I talked about earlier, about the whole thing for or against, and kind of developing a manifesto, or developing, kind of your why. The other thing that really stood out to me was that all movements have language around it and that, I mean, I mean, if you look at 100 acts, we got language like field of favor, who is your who even the term challenge, is a bit of a lingo that is is within that. So every, every movement has the language, and that's part of, part of the unifying factor of a movement. So anyway, it was kind of insightful for me. It kind of helped me that, Hey, Pedro, just talking about how, how language unifies, unifies movements, and it's and talking about different language that we have in 100 acts like fill the favor and even different things like that. So I'm actually including this as a bonus worksheet for people who, Inc, who kind of did the training, who signed up under me in the nonprofit space. So wanted to share that kind of as a thought for you guys, something to think about as you, as you think about your about your movement and and all that anyway. Looking forward to the rest of week. Thanks, guys. Oh, sweet. That's awesome. Cool. Looking forward to that sounds good. Thanks, Pedro, you.
