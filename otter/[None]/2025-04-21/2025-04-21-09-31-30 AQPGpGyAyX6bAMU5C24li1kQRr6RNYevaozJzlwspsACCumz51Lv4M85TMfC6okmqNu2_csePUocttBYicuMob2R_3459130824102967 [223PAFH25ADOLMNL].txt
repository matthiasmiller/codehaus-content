All right, so I'm doing my part to social to social distance. So if you look down there, there's the rest of the world. Here I am. I'm trying to, you know, do my part. But I would start this afternoon going through a drive through and working, you know, talking to somebody who's on the front lines, dealing with a lot of the public on an ongoing basis. Here's a very practical reason to stay, to not buy into fear, and to stay strong in hope during this time. Because when you do that, if you can stay in hope, even amidst, amidst everything that's going on, and you can stay out of fear, it allows you to actually have compassion on the people who are on the front lines. Hoping is one of the greatest viruses that we could spend during this time. And it was just fun being able to have an interaction with with somebody at a drive through, being able to spread the hope that I have inside of me with them in just a simple, practical way. And and I don't know, this message just keeps burning on my heart. Don't buy into fear. Live with hope. I understand these are really challenging situations, and there's a lot of people on the on the front lines who are putting their themselves, really in harm's way to to to help. But I think one of the best things that we can do to help them is not given into fear. Stay grounded in hope. Share that hope with them and share that love. And it's probably, honestly, one of the most compassionate things that we can do for them. So there you go. That's it. Happy Sunday evening, you guys. You.
