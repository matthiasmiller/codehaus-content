Alright. Well, good evening, everybody. So, so here's here's the deal, here's the deal. I might be ticking some people off right now, and hopefully it's worth it. So I was challenged by somebody recently to step up the game, provide more value to more people, change more people's lives. And so here's what I'm doing. I'm doing an event on a training on Wednesday and Friday at 1pm Mountain, 2pm Central, 3pm Eastern, on unlocking your superpower. And it's from the last number of years, actually, here. Here's the fun thing. This is kind of the crazy thing. So I'm planning to share a story on on this, on this training that I have never shared publicly before, and I don't know you're absolutely going to be there, because it is a, it is a Absolutely. It's a crazy story, but it shows the power of of understanding what you were created for, and and understanding your purpose and your destiny. So what you were born for? We were born for something. So what? What is it? You can spend your life bumping around trying to find it, or you can find somebody who's spent enough of their life bumping around trying to find it and have them help you find it. So if you want, if you want this, making it available for super cheap. So if you want to drop a link in the comments, I'll get you the details, and I will see you Wednesday. If you can't make it at that time, I'll get your recording as well. So drop in the comments, and we'll see how many people never actually told you why people might be ticked off. So there's this challenge. The deadline is tonight, so I have been inviting people into this thing tonight, and I can tell who's awake and who's not. So if you've been lurking in the shadows wondering if you know anybody knows that you're wide awake, here I am. I know. So every day I.
