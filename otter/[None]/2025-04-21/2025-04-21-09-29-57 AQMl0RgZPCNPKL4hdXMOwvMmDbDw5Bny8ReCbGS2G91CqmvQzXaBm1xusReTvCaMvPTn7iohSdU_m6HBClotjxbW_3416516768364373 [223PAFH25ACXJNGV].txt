I just got off a call with a an Ask Me Anything call regarding some nonprofits that are looking to take their events virtual and able to answer a bunch of questions, but here is one that I wanted to get some support from the community on here, are there any good tools for running a virtual Summit? I suspect there's some people in this group who have done virtual summits and have some experience with them. So if any resources that you've got in terms of, of, especially around the technology side, I know we, you know, one of, one of the things that you can't, that I know we can do, is maybe do some pre recorded videos and, you know, schedule emails and different things like that. But using, using, I believe it's OBS Studio to you know, live stream multiple videos and live stream all at one time, that could be an option as well. I also know that's a bit of a tech undertaking for a lot of these people. So if you have any any kind of resources to share, I'd appreciate it.
