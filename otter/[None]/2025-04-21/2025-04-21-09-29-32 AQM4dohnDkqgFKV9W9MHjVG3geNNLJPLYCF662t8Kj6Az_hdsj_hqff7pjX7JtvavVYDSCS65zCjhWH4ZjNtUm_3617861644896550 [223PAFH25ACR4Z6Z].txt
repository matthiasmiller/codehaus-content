All right, movement movement makers. Super awesome training today, and just wanted to hop in and do my homework real quick. I haven't done the homework for the other days, which is to my discredit, but I'll get to that. Am I willing to make the commitment to be a movement maker? Absolutely yes. There's a lot of things that Pedro was talking about in the training today that I have been really focused on kind of building into my life over the last, you know, over the last number of years, especially taking taking it deeper. But one of the things that really stood out to me well, and I feel like there's a lot of those things about surrounding myself with with mentors, learning from mentors, being humble and teachable. I feel like, like those are places where I've, I've been winning. I do think one of the one of the places I continue needing to grow is becoming more problem aware and just i and even maybe also knowing how to be kind of congruent with myself and show up as me and exaggerate the differences. And I'm not sure how to sort all these pieces together, because in a lot of ways, I am an innovator. I kind of have this, these add tendencies, and all of these things. And so, you know, how does, how does all that stuff fit together? Hey, Deanna, how does all this stuff kind of fit together, and in terms of being problem aware and serving, serving my who, and all of those types of things, so not sure exactly how to, how to, how to bring those pieces together. But that's, that's where I'm at. And for sure, I'm all in and on being a movement maker. I.
