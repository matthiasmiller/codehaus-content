Hey guys, sorry, got really weird lighting in here, but super excited. Just got I was going back into my Click Funnels and LinkedIn and then Facebook and all that stuff, trying to sort through more of the opt in kinds of stuff. And discovered, when I pull up my stats, discovered that I made my first sale, and the very first, first new bot also got the upsell. So the upsell was the the challenge a price. Price at $7 and the upsell was at $44 so got my first sale of $51 which is one major step in proving the offer. So just wanted to throw that out there and invite you guys to celebrate with me, and also just share the encouragement for those of you guys who are plugging along for the first first sale, this has been a very, very good lesson in trusting the process. I am naturally an incredibly impatient person, and yeah, anyway, so just wanted to share that and encourage the rest of you guys and yeah, excited. Have a great night. Bye.
