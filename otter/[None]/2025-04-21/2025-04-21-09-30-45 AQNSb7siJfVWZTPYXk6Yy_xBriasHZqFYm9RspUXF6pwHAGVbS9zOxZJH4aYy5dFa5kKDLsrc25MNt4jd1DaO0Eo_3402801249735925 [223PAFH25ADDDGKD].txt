All right, so I wanted to share some stories about this afternoon I've been reaching out to people, and had to think of what Dean Graziosi said in one of the trainings about marketing is repelling the wrong people and attracting the right people. So one of the people I reached out to is like somebody I would have considered like a warm, I guess a warm lead warm contact, and talking to him and, like, talking talk to him on the phone, but his, you know, you can tell, his eyes glazed over, and he completely didn't understand, like he didn't get he just didn't get it, like it just didn't get it. And I'll be honest, like, here's, here's some mindset stuff for me to work on, but that was really hard for me to kind of deal with, so I took a break, worked on some other stuff, and came back and came back, and then just got off a call with another individual and just started sharing about what we're looking to do. And like all ears, like, keep us posted. I'm fascinated by it. I want to we're on a on a conference call with board members and the executive director this this weekend, like this, this totally sounds good. Let's be in touch. And and I can tell from the conversation that this is absolutely somebody who would do well working with me and very much the right type of client. And I feel like I'm learning a lot of mindset stuff with this whole thing. And so here's the thing, I think, I think we get to support each other. I'm sure, there's, I'm sure, I'm sure I'm not the only one who kind of takes nose hard. And I think I gotta give myself permission to grow, and you gotta give yourself permission to grow. So if you're, if you're getting those, I'm cheering for you. And if, if you're getting yeses, I'm cheering for you as well. So take care. Bye.
