So it would be awesome if I could somehow say that there's just a single fear that got uncovered by watching the TED Talk. But I think, think one of the major ones is that at that my mistakes, that me making a mistake, will derail the entire process, and it will sideline the success a fairly another significant fear is that's tied to that. I think because of that, it's often difficult for me to take feedback from from people, and I don't always know whether that feedback is because will it actually help the program succeed, or is this something that's kind of coercing me into a space where I won't provide the value that I that I want to, because I'm trying to, basically just trying to become all things to all people with that too. There is, there is definitely a fear of of, you know, what if? What if I launch this? What if it fails? What if? What if? What if I don't get any sign ups, or don't get enough signups. So that's, that's another kind of, another major kind of, another major fear. I think there was one other one that I wanted to share with all of that, and it's completely slipping my mind. But yeah, I think, I think at at the root this fear that that if I just, if I make a mistake, that that it's going to throw the whole thing side, because there's one other major one, and that is just that I'm not going to be able to figure this out, that I won't get the clarity that I need around the problem that I solve, that that That's, that's another fairly, fairly major one. So, great exercise, and it's really been kind of, it's really forced me to kind of rip my heart open and look inside and look at what's going to keep me from doing that. So, good exercise. You.
