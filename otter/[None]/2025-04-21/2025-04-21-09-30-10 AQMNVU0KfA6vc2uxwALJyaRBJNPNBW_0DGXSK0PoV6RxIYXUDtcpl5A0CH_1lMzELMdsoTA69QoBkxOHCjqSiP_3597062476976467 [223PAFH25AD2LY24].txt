Speaker 1  00:00
Hey guys, so checking in with you all, and I am wondering what in the world I have gotten myself into. And anyway, maybe you guys can speak into this a little bit. So signed up as an affiliate, affiliate for the challenge, the challenge. Challenge the movement maker challenge, and got a non profit movement maker com domain and posted one of the nonprofit Facebook groups that I'm part of. I was like, Hey, anybody interested in a free training on a Facebook strategy that is Facebook fundraiser? No, I'm sorry, on a fundraising strategy that's crushing it right now, and leave a comment in the last five minutes or so, comments have been trickling in. Got about 12 people interested right now, and more coming. And so I guess here's where I'm kind of freaking out already. I'm like, Okay, so I've definitely done my own challenge for for the Dream Team Challenge, small challenge. But you know, definitely getting high levels of engagement from from the people who are in the challenge for the most part. But I don't have any great examples of people who've actually done this in the nonprofit sector. So I guess maybe the maybe the answer to my own question is posting in 100x and looking for people who'd be willing to be case studies for this. But anyway, just wanted to throw that out there. I'm probably, I can probably pull together some stuff just on movements in general, and even some stuff on challenges, and use that as a as a setup in the free training to push people over into the into the movement maker challenge. So anyway, not sure what I've gotten myself into, but there's definitely a lot of a lot of responses and a lot of interest in this. So I'll be excited to see kind of where this goes. Anyway. Take care guys. I.
