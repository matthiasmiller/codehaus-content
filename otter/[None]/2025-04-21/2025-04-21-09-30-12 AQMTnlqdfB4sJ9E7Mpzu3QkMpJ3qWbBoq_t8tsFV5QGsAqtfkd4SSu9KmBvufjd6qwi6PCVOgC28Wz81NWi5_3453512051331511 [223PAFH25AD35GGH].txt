So great, great, great call today, or great video, video today. And so here's the homework assignment that I'm doing. Oh, the one thing I've been holding on to has been, there was some stuff, I mean, Pedro. Pedro was talking earlier today about value versus price, and how some of those things get mixed up and and there was a situation where I invested a lot of money into a coaching program, and it went sideways, and I've, I, I've done a lot of hard work around it, and one of the things I've been challenged recently is just to just a reminder of Jesus command to bless our enemies. And so I thought this would be a good, time to do that. And I just bless them in Jesus name. I bless them with with life and with love and with the presence of of Christ being made known, known to them and being made manifest to them. I guess one of the things that I'm letting go of too, is just the way that I have not saying that, that they're going to have authority to speak into my life at all, but, but, but just allowing God to open up my heart and to to pour love into my heart for them, even despite everything that's that's happened. And so that's my homework assignment. And yeah, bless you guys. You.
