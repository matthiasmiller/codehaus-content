Hey, good morning. 414, family. So here's my homework for yesterday. Great assignment. And one of the things that I was processing through that is that I felt like God. God was saying that he wants to take away the sting of disappointment. And one of the things that happens in the orphan mindset is that opportunities are once a lifetime, and when loss cannot be recovered, and I know that there are opportunities that you can never get back, but that doesn't mean that there aren't more opportunities down the road. And I've, I've seen just a series of things where God's unraveling this, and he's like, like, yeah, that was a disappointment, but, but that wasn't the end of the story, but that wasn't the end of the story, but that wasn't the end of the end of the story. So there's, there's part one. And I felt like what God wants to be for me in this season is he wants to carry me, and that, that in this season he's carrying me and and my business and my assignment is really quite simple, to allow him to carry me. And, you know, I'm working on things that I that I really feel will deeply impact people's lives. But even with that, I don't feel like my assignment is actually that I feel like, feel like there's going to be that, and that there's people who are going to be deeply touched, but that my assignment is simply to allow him to carry me and and allow him to carry my business. Yes, absolutely. That's it's my job description. Man, I do that because I get my toe step done. So this is God working, working in my heart. So that's my assignment. And just Wow, just wow. So grateful for the chance to to to take in all of all of Graham's wisdom and insight in Revelation yesterday. So what is your assignment? What's your promise? Do?
