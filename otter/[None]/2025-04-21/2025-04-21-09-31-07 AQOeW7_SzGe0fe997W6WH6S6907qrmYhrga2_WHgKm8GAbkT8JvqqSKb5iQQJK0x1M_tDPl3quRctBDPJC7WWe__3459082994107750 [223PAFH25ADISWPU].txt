All right. Day three, homework, catching up once again, and here we are, live third time in a row. So, so couple of things, one of the places to repent, one of the things I realized is that I recently, I recently wrote a sales letter. One of the things that I mentioned actually referenced somebody else's claim to be an internationally recognized coach, or something like that. And I realized that, even though in some ways it's not really on me, how they claim, how they position themselves, I'm not sure if that label is actually accurate or or or relevant. I think it was. It may have been something that was kind of pulled out of seemed like something that was kind of pulled out of the blue. So, so one of the things I'm deciding to do is just to pull that and find a different way to recognize, recognize them in a way that's honest. So that was, that was definitely good. It's, it was and it's it was really good to be challenged. One of the things about truth telling, you know, what are the places for the people that I serve? I continue seeing a lot of kind of manipulation and and I don't even know, some sometimes not standing behind results, going into kind of, especially in an advisory role, or a kind of a, a, yeah, especially in an advisory role, not not having a deep commitment to outcomes and results. And there can be a lot of kind of hand wavy stuff that that kind of kind of goes on with that, and that's one of the places where I want to bring Kingdom alignment. So, good challenge, good questions. Hope you guys are doing doing well in this Sunday evening.
