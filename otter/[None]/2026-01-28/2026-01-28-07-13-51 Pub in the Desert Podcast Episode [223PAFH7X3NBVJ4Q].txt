Unknown Speaker  00:02
Welcome to pub in the desert, where we bring you honest, curious conversations about faith and the human experience. I'm Matthias Miller here with my co host, Kevin David kritner. Every time we started these episodes, we recap our three guiding principles, and here they are, first, you don't need to be fixed. You need to be known. And we believe that love is knowing and being known. Second, we approach difficult topics with genuine curiosity. We aren't here to win arguments. We're here to understand and third, we don't come with preset agendas. We let conversations unfold naturally and we follow where authenticity leads us. So pull up a chair, grab a drink, and let's explore what union looks like with God, with others and with ourselves. So

Unknown Speaker  00:40
Kevin, you and I have been having conversations offline around

Unknown Speaker  00:45
Saul and Jonathan and some of these figures in the Old Testament. And I'm going to start out with something I've been thinking about over the last 24 hours,

Unknown Speaker  00:57
and we'll see if it ties in or how,

Unknown Speaker  01:02
but there's this observation that responsibility, okay, so if you think about responsibility,

Unknown Speaker  01:10
there's some people who take a higher level responsibility than other people. And as a child, you're expected that your capacity, that your needs, outpace your capacity, like I need help getting dressed, getting getting food. I need a roof over my head, all of these things, right? And obviously, not every human shares the same path of development, but broadly speaking, across the spectrum, most most humans will develop.

Unknown Speaker  01:41
You know, their capacity expands so that they can take care of themselves, start taking care of other people, and it goes on from

Unknown Speaker  01:52
there. The challenge is that when you are a person who has other people relying on you in some capacity, and you don't step up, or there's any part of your life where you're not taking responsibility for that, and you don't have somebody in your corner to help cover for you, the people in your sphere of influence take the hit. So, right, what? What do I mean? And I've been thinking a lot about the ripple effect of irresponsibility.

Unknown Speaker  02:24
So here's what it looks like for me.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
You have a you

Unknown Speaker  02:29
have a business owner

Unknown Speaker  02:31
who is a largely absentee business owner that this is, and then they have and so they create a culture of delegation by abdication, just kind of like, Oh, you just go figure it out. And then they have a second in command of some kind who shares the same traits, and then team members within that who share the same traits, or, or maybe, and then that individual in there,

Unknown Speaker  03:01
like

Unknown Speaker  03:04
ends up carrying, taking that there's somebody in there at the bottom of the organization, typically, typically, it's an industry who takes the brunt of it. It's the conscientious bookkeeper, it's the it's somebody in there who's super conscientious, who wants to make this work? And they take the brand so they're already hyper responsible, they end up taking more responsible than necessary. What happens when that person's capacity exceeds can't handle it? Yeah. Well, now

Unknown Speaker  03:35
it can affect marriages. It can affect relationships, personal coping mechanisms, health health breakdowns. There's one business leader who actually said, like the COO is, like, as an entrepreneur, you should never have a heart attack. That's the Coos job,

Unknown Speaker  03:51
right?

Unknown Speaker  03:53
And they do that very well, but, but that's blonde

Unknown Speaker  03:59
Well, I mean, but they see the problems and they take responsibility to fix them and turn them around.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
But if you have somebody at that level, then this individuals, whoever's at the bottom of the food chain, because, let's be honest, it's kind of what it turns into,

Unknown Speaker  04:20
ends up like their families end up being affected. Their kids end up like the people in their environment end up being affected. And it's very easy to say, all right, but look at the money you made. Look at look at all this stuff, like it's and I've also,

Unknown Speaker  04:34
I've also observed it that with leaders who are, there's, there's some leaders who,

Unknown Speaker  04:40
as a leader, it's very difficult if you are

Unknown Speaker  04:46
less self aware of your own stressors than the people around you, and when you I mean, it's true of anybody, but when, when our when the stress of our lives.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
Just reaches a certain threshold. It's kind of like everything leaks out on everybody else. And sometimes toxic environments aren't created intentionally. It's because, I mean, probably most times not, but, but, but. It's because there's an overflow of stress and strain for an unidentified reason, and then everybody else ends up taking the brunt of it, and it

Unknown Speaker  05:25
just becomes painful. The more

Unknown Speaker  05:28
it's always painful, but the bigger the sphere of influence,

Unknown Speaker  05:33
and whether that's social media, whether that's the bigger the size of the church, the bigger the business, the bigger then the more people end up getting affected, and the more difficult the consequences. But it can also be a lonely place, then in that place where, if you are that leader, to sort things out. So that's

Unknown Speaker  05:54
it was just very curious to watch the ripple effect of and never really observed that in this way, way before. But when I don't take responsibility, that is mine to carry. When I don't, then there is a ripple effect. Somebody has to carry it. It doesn't just disappear, right,

Unknown Speaker  06:09
right? The bill will come too

Unknown Speaker  06:14
well said at some point, and somebody's gonna have to pay it,

Unknown Speaker  06:22
and it just seems like a very, very human problem.

Unknown Speaker  06:28
We'd like to look at and say, No, it's just church, no, it's just business, no, it's just whatever our context tells us. It just is,

Unknown Speaker  06:38
but it seems to be, across the board, just human endeavor,

Unknown Speaker  06:47
and we don't.

Unknown Speaker  06:48
Here's the issue for me, like we've talked about this, we've been looking at,

Unknown Speaker  06:54
you know, just profiles of people in the Old Testament.

Unknown Speaker  06:58
And what really, really bothered me was a lot of times these people get flattened into two dimensional images,

Unknown Speaker  07:06
and so you're just up top looking at this board, seeing this two dimensional image run around the board. It

Unknown Speaker  07:13
just doesn't seem fair, right, or healthy. I gotta sneeze.

Unknown Speaker  07:19
Excuse me. Thank you,

Unknown Speaker  07:22
sorry for the break.

Unknown Speaker  07:27
And what really fascinated me was, what if we dove in and actually looked at the facets of these people, whether it's Samson or it's Ruth or it's Esther or it's Saul or it's Jonathan or it's any of these people. What if we refuse to create this two dimensional image of them

Unknown Speaker  07:48
and instead understood what was going on 3d

Unknown Speaker  07:54
that's what I hear when I hear you talking, is like, this is like, you could flatten this into a 2d issue,

Unknown Speaker  08:03
responsibility and lack thereof, right? Or we could see the 3d version of what actually is going on,

Unknown Speaker  08:13
which takes time and pain to do it. It

Unknown Speaker  08:19
takes putting my preconceived notions on the shelf

Unknown Speaker  08:24
and go, what's actually here?

Unknown Speaker  08:28
What do I see? What do I hear? What do I think? What do I feel like? Allow a human being to be a human being

Unknown Speaker  08:42
as we have,

Unknown Speaker  08:44
I guess,

Unknown Speaker  08:46
a tangential line from what you were saying is

Unknown Speaker  08:51
we have this culture within The Western world

Unknown Speaker  08:57
of a victim culture,

Unknown Speaker  09:00
which encourages no one to take responsibility, but to look to give blame somewhere else.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
And that's I think that's easy for us to see, or at least for me to see. I don't know, maybe others see it too. I But what about those ones who are not

Unknown Speaker  09:28
who are who are taking responsibility, who are not victims, do not see themselves as victims. Now this is not to say that they haven't been victimized. Me, you anybody out there, it's not to say they haven't been victimized, but they refuse to stay in that place where they're defined as victim.

Unknown Speaker  09:49
What happens to people like that in a culture of shifting blame and victim ideology? I.

Unknown Speaker  10:11
Functionally, repeatedly, what I see,

Unknown Speaker  10:20
it

Unknown Speaker  10:21
depends, on the prevailing culture. And if the prevailing culture is driven by someone who buys into the victim mindset, then those people become or from someone who tolerates

Unknown Speaker  10:40
the victim way of thinking,

Unknown Speaker  10:46
those people end up

Unknown Speaker  10:48
taking the blame, taking things being, being assigned responsibility,

Unknown Speaker  10:54
and ultimately are put in a difficult position of, do I want things to go well, or Do I want to stick to what I was, what I'm here to do, right?

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Right?

Unknown Speaker  11:10
That person becomes the bearer of many burdens,

Unknown Speaker  11:16
right? So

Unknown Speaker  11:20
what do you do with that?

Unknown Speaker  11:24
Okay, so surely in your lifetime, you've had people who've come to you who've

Unknown Speaker  11:31
not been able to carry their own weight.

Unknown Speaker  11:34
Yeah, how do you personally how have you personally

Unknown Speaker  11:41
managed? Or have you? Have you, for Susan's, become the bearer of burdens. How do you How have you avoided becoming that where you shouldn't? How do you know where you should be or not?

Unknown Speaker  11:55
Wow, yes, been on both sides, the bearer of burdens, and then asking people to bear my burdens both sides,

Unknown Speaker  12:07
and probably extreme, I haven't say extreme, but probably profound dysfunction on both sides,

Unknown Speaker  12:17
my personal

Unknown Speaker  12:20
methodology or

Unknown Speaker  12:24
personality ego structure was, I can be the burden bearer. I will carry it,

Unknown Speaker  12:33
and I would carry it and carry it and carry it until, because I believe I had to, it gave me value. It gave me worth.

Unknown Speaker  12:45
I would carry it until I would break down,

Unknown Speaker  12:50
physically, sometimes

Unknown Speaker  12:54
spiritually, emotionally, psychologically

Unknown Speaker  13:00
and

Unknown Speaker  13:02
over the years, I've seen that pattern be developed,

Unknown Speaker  13:09
the bearer of the burdens, and I could always paint it as altruistic

Unknown Speaker  13:17
as I'm doing this, because this is what I'm called to Do, or this is what I'm meant to do, or that, and whether I was or whether I was, and that's up to God.

Unknown Speaker  13:28
But that's one thing I learned as I dove into the Saul story, is that

Unknown Speaker  13:36
calling is for formation.

Unknown Speaker  13:41
God calls us into something, to form us. He it's not that we're formed and he calls us. He calls us to form us.

Unknown Speaker  13:50
Yeah, and as I look back over my life to answer your question more clearly, what I've seen is him call me

Unknown Speaker  13:57
to do the work that I've done, and me making tragic, horrific mistakes in the midst of that, and him shaping me through it.

Unknown Speaker  14:10
And I think it's, I think there's something powerful there too, based on how you respond to it.

Unknown Speaker  14:17
Because I think you have the David model of how you respond to that formation and calling. And I think you have the Saul model,

Unknown Speaker  14:25
and not to make them 2d characters by any stretch of the imagination, but what you see with Saul very often, is in his formation. When the moment of formation comes,

Unknown Speaker  14:40
he makes mistake, he makes poor choice, whatever. He always runs and hides, emotionally, spiritually, physically, sometimes the very beginning of the story, he's hiding in the baggage,

Unknown Speaker  14:53
right? And that's a big moment,

Unknown Speaker  14:56
like, let's not, let's not compress it into.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
You know, pixelated, you know, one dimensional thing like this is the man who's going to be the first king of this godly nation, and he's chosen by this prophet, and he's supposed to lead this nation. And man that's a heavy burden to carry,

Unknown Speaker  15:22
well, and on top of that, it's for some really bizarre motives.

Unknown Speaker  15:28
But of the people like it's in some essence, they're asking for him to play God for them, right? And maybe beyond essence, I mean, it's interesting to frame this in our context. Imagine the founding fathers. And everybody's like, George Washington, let's go. And he's like, has anybody seen George lately?

Unknown Speaker  15:52
He's in the carriage, in the stage coach out back, because underneath all the pile of, you know, yeah, everything like,

Unknown Speaker  16:02
imagine, in our day and age, what the press would look like for this, you know, oh man, if this were different country, you know, the,

Unknown Speaker  16:12
you know, insert name of country,

Unknown Speaker  16:15
appoints cowardly leader,

Unknown Speaker  16:18
invites plunder from other nations, like, right,

Unknown Speaker  16:22
couldn't, couldn't be found for the inauguration. Exactly, couldn't be found for the inauguration. He was on the subway somewhere, exactly,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
hiding with the homeless. I don't know. Um, like, I

Unknown Speaker  16:43
I think touch a little, go ahead, yeah, just an incredible, I mean, to not flatten Saul into this character like it is an incredible burden that is being put before him,

Unknown Speaker  16:57
and before you start casting stones at him. How would you respond

Unknown Speaker  17:06
when I we see that Saul's Achilles heel is urgent, urgency, the pressure, the furnace like that's that's what got him in trouble, and that urgency, that drive to take immediate action. But in that story where, where he's waiting for Samuel to come make, make the sacrifice. You have to understand that you've got 10s of 1000s of people up the hill, and he's down in the valley with hundreds and the time by some measurement. And I don't know, I'm not a scholar here, it's up for debate exactly where he was at on the precise timeline, but regardless, that urgency got to him, so there was the pressure of formation. And so I think

Unknown Speaker  17:55
there's one thing that I wanted to highlight in this concept of calling being formation,

Unknown Speaker  18:02
which showed up in a conversation this past Sunday, talking about Ephesians, 210,

Unknown Speaker  18:09
it talks about that we are His workmanship. God's workmanship created in Christ. Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. Yeah. And in our Western culture, English language, we don't differentiate between singular versus plural,

Unknown Speaker  18:28
but this is a plural. We it's and I think it's important to note that by very definition in nature, calling is a

Unknown Speaker  18:40
is a communal and triunal

Unknown Speaker  18:44
experience. It's us as the people of God, as the body of Christ, being formed into His image, in relationship with him, right? And it's not individualized,

Unknown Speaker  18:59
right, right?

Unknown Speaker  19:02
Yeah, and then you contrast that with the person of David,

Unknown Speaker  19:07
and consistently over David's life, when the catastrophe happens, when the poor choice happens, when the the

Unknown Speaker  19:20
false perception of reality happens. Like you see Him, seek presence.

Unknown Speaker  19:29
Not run away and hide, but seek presence.

Unknown Speaker  19:36
And I think that those I think it's really fascinating. I think to a certain degree,

Unknown Speaker  19:42
David became a mirror for Saul.

Unknown Speaker  19:49
And when,

Unknown Speaker  19:51
when that thing in front of you, whether it's a person or it's a situation or it's an idea, becomes a mirror for you.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
If you don't like what you see, you only have one option.

Unknown Speaker  20:06
You got to break the mirror. Well,

Unknown Speaker  20:11
technically, give two you could change,

Unknown Speaker  20:14
right, right. Yeah, exactly, yeah. You could go, oh, wow, yeah, oh, wow. This is what I'm seeing,

Unknown Speaker  20:23
and these things need to change,

Unknown Speaker  20:28
and God brings people alongside us, in the midst of those seeing in the mirror moments that give us a opportunity to grow and change.

Unknown Speaker  20:38
Or I could break the mirror, or I could pin David to a wall with a sphere,

Unknown Speaker  20:44
right?

Unknown Speaker  20:46
Those are our options.

Unknown Speaker  20:53
I think it's very intriguing David's response, because the psalms are kind of his, I don't

Unknown Speaker  21:04
know. It's almost like his blueprint, or his framework, or his

Unknown Speaker  21:09
container for engaging with God in the in, in the fire of life, right, right?

Unknown Speaker  21:19
It's this working out like it's this space where he's working out what's in his head, what he's what's in his soul, in his body, what he's feeling. Like you read those psalms, and they are so raw,

Unknown Speaker  21:33
so raw.

Unknown Speaker  21:35
And like, to your point, it seems to be this container where he can put this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  21:45
We you know, because where else is it gonna go?

Unknown Speaker  21:51
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:58
So then there's also the question of, what's David's experience like as the mirror,

Unknown Speaker  22:04
you're right?

Unknown Speaker  22:09
And I think, I mean, this is where the whole Listen, just follow God and do the right thing, and your life will be blessed. Thing really breaks down. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  22:19
blessed, or you could have the king try to kill you. I mean, right?

Unknown Speaker  22:24
Think about that point you just made.

Unknown Speaker  22:28
He was anointed. He was blessed. He's going to be the next king. He's been told this when he was a teenager, by by all accounts.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Now, imagine

Unknown Speaker  22:45
being put in that position where you know that you're the next king, and the old king's still alive,

Unknown Speaker  22:53
and we gotta keep it, keep it on the down low, you know, we can't, we can't be talking about it. So you're carrying this burden of this is where I'm supposed to be.

Unknown Speaker  23:06
Oh, I mean, the head of a nation, like, life's going to be beautiful. It's wonderful. You got the palaces, you've got war, you've got you've got all these idyllic things.

Unknown Speaker  23:19
And then look at David's life.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
It doesn't seem like blessing to blessing. It

Unknown Speaker  23:32
doesn't seem possible to for a human to go through that kind of suffering,

Unknown Speaker  23:37
that kind of I mean, he

Unknown Speaker  23:41
David's hiding was,

Unknown Speaker  23:46
there's a big sense in which Saul was hiding from God and trying to be visible to the people. And there's some sense in which David was hiding from the people and being visible to God,

Unknown Speaker  23:58
right?

Unknown Speaker  23:59
And it seems like

Unknown Speaker  24:03
it's hard to fathom.

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Okay, first of all, I mean, bearing in mind that the combat,

Unknown Speaker  24:13
this is some interesting little side note that came up in the in as as I was digging into some of this is the concept of combat trauma. I mean, this is not air warfare,

Unknown Speaker  24:26
no.

Unknown Speaker  24:28
And that's

Unknown Speaker  24:31
that does a number on you and, and that would, that would do a number on you so, and it's like,

Unknown Speaker  24:41
it's hard to fathom what David would have ended up as had he not had some kind of outlet for

Unknown Speaker  24:50
these kinds of things. And it's very curious. How did, how did David settle upon, why did David turn his heart towards God? Why was that? How did that become? What.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
What happened in him,

Unknown Speaker  25:03
what was his experience? What was his decision, or his decisions that led him to let God be his refuge in these types of situations? Well, there's a there's a theme here, right,

Unknown Speaker  25:16
like you have David as the shepherd,

Unknown Speaker  25:21
which means a lot of time out in the wild alone, and

Unknown Speaker  25:28
there's a lot of formation that happens there.

Unknown Speaker  25:33
It's almost like like he's drawn out into the desert where God can speak tenderly to him, to echo Hosea two,

Unknown Speaker  25:42
and you've got the same thing with Moses. He flees Egypt, and then he's a shepherd out in the desert for what appears to be about four decades,

Unknown Speaker  25:53
that God drawing him out into the desert where he can speak tenderly to Him. Abraham, leave your father's house, come out into the desert where I can shape you and form you. Jesus, after His baptism, come out into the desert where I can shape you and form you. John the Baptist, come out into the desert

Unknown Speaker  26:15
where I can shape you and form you. And then they have this sense of personhood

Unknown Speaker  26:21
that comes from that

Unknown Speaker  26:24
where you can stand in front of the most powerful man in the world, and both Abraham and Moses's experience, stand in front of Pharaoh and say, No, not going to happen.

Unknown Speaker  26:37
Or Abraham, you can argue with God,

Unknown Speaker  26:41
or, you know, all of these, these situations.

Unknown Speaker  26:47
Or David, you can, you can dance in your loincloth in front of the population of Israel. You know, like you, you have this sense of personhood. You know who you are. And I wonder if that response is directly attributable to that time in the desert,

Unknown Speaker  27:08
that time we as human beings seem to avoid like the plague.

Unknown Speaker  27:14
Okay, so. But not every individual's desert ends as well, because we have individuals who

Unknown Speaker  27:24
who've spent time in some form of desert, who've ended up having bizarre revelations and starting false religions and doing very weird

Unknown Speaker  27:36
i don't Know what, just doing things like that, right, right? So

Unknown Speaker  27:45
what's the delineating factor, then? Because it seems to me like the desert is the kind of thing that I think it's an inevitable choice. You have to, you have to choose. But it's not inevitable what choice you will make, and it's, it seems to me like,

Unknown Speaker  28:07
what, what is the delineation?

Unknown Speaker  28:10
All right, well, maybe there's a direction here, a hint here in the story of Saul.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
So he has very successful campaigns early on in his his you call it kingship, kingness,

Unknown Speaker  28:29
his position,

Unknown Speaker  28:31
and there's this moment where he, he conquers this group, and he's supposed to

Unknown Speaker  28:37
execute the king God had given an order, Amalek, I think his name is, and

Unknown Speaker  28:43
he refuses to do it.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
And that's the point where Samuel comes in and say, says, God has removed you from the throne.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
And Saul's response in that moment is utterly fascinating. He doesn't repent. He doesn't say, Oh, I messed up. I didn't follow. He doesn't acknowledge this. He says,

Unknown Speaker  29:06
Stand with me before the elders of Israel

Unknown Speaker  29:11
justify me before the people

Unknown Speaker  29:17
and initially, Samuel refused. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:21
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:22
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:24
And that's when everything starts to go downhill. But Saul's orientation at that point was to others. I need you to to tell me who I am.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
Maybe it's maybe that desert season a fundamental part of it is orientation.

Unknown Speaker  29:48
If you're if the only thing you want in that desert season is to return to the city, you're

Unknown Speaker  29:56
not going to learn lessons that you need to right?

Unknown Speaker  30:01
Yeah, if in that desert season you are asking the question, you're wrestling with God, why did this happen? How did this happen? What's going you all the the wrestling that happens internally in us as human beings, then there's a shaping and a forming that's going to happen,

Unknown Speaker  30:21
because God's going to answer that. You're going to be in conversation with him. So maybe it's a fundamental matter of orientation on one side out of well, and Saul's a great example, right? His desire to be liked and to be known and to be respected leads him to

Unknown Speaker  30:41
Endor at the end of the story,

Unknown Speaker  30:44
where he's consulting a medium to get into contact with Samuel So Samuel can make him feel better about the situation he's In.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
I would take the desert experience one step further that

Unknown Speaker  31:06
maybe the wrestling happens for a season, but there's some point in the desert experience where there's a surrender that says I'm going to be at home in this experience

Unknown Speaker  31:18
as long as necessary, and I have, and that's very different from, I can't articulate it, but it's different than just, you know, roll over and die kind of thing. It's not You're not being a victim to that, but you're finding a sense of dependence on God

Unknown Speaker  31:36
in the middle of the hardship and finding your home in him, ultimately,

Unknown Speaker  31:42
and

Unknown Speaker  31:44
and with many of these people, you, I don't know if it's all of them,

Unknown Speaker  31:51
but many of these people, you see a reluctance to leave the desert,

Unknown Speaker  31:55
right? Maybe that's the switch that gets flipped somewhere along the way you've been out here, and there's a longing to be back in comfort and safety. We all have it.

Unknown Speaker  32:07
And at some point it becomes really, really clear. And the switch that gets flipped, at least for me, how it got flipped was, I'm in this situation, it is so completely, utterly painful. I can't do anything about it. I've tried everything I know how to do. I have reached the end of myself,

Unknown Speaker  32:30
and I just lay it all down.

Unknown Speaker  32:35
And it's not like there's some moment where it's okay, you know, I lay it all down. It's the consistent acknowledgement that I cannot do this.

Unknown Speaker  32:47
All my plans have brought me here,

Unknown Speaker  32:51
all my efforts, all my my strategies, all my negotiations, everything has brought me here until I get to the place where I go, what is it all?

Unknown Speaker  33:04
Is it all worth? What does it all cost me?

Unknown Speaker  33:07
What is all of this brought me,

Unknown Speaker  33:13
and I think that's this, the moment this switch gets flipped.

Unknown Speaker  33:19
The fascinating thing to me is

Unknown Speaker  33:23
some people never switch, flip that switch,

Unknown Speaker  33:29
no matter how painful it gets, no matter how deep into whatever circumstances you're in you get,

Unknown Speaker  33:40
it never gets

Unknown Speaker  33:45
when that switch gets flipped,

Unknown Speaker  33:50
like there's sort

Unknown Speaker  33:53
of got, like three thoughts Johnson for their attention.

Unknown Speaker  33:57
There's this sense of living outside. There's this, there's this there's this sense in which

Unknown Speaker  34:05
you can never understand a system living inside of it.

Unknown Speaker  34:09
And and I think that the desert ultimately, is a removal from from a human system in which there are certain prices that are worth paying to gain certain types of things and certain activities and certain sacrifices that are normalized.

Unknown Speaker  34:22
And I think stepping outside of that, into the desert is a is an intentional act of disconnecting from that system. And if it's, it's it's reflective of the idea of, what does it profit someone to gain the whole world and to lose their soul? And a lot of sense the desert is the let's step out of the game, the whole world game, game, yeah, system. And when you do that, suddenly you recognize the poverty of spirit that you've been living with. And you thought that God was present with you in the middle of that, and he was but when you.

Unknown Speaker  35:00
Step outside of that you make room for a deeper place of abiding, of presence, of belonging, of all of those things that

Unknown Speaker  35:11
you didn't know were occupied by these other things, but he did, all right. And so that invitation to, and maybe it's, it's,

Unknown Speaker  35:22
you know, practically, I mean, it's kind of like the age old saying of like, you know, you can, you know, you tell a kid sit up, and they're standing up. On the inside, it's like, you can go in the desert, but you're still in that, in that place, in your heart, right? There's that surrender of the heart to say, No, I will let go of those things so that

Unknown Speaker  35:42
I can have what,

Unknown Speaker  35:44
what?

Unknown Speaker  35:46
Yeah, there's this.

Unknown Speaker  35:52
Heard this a long time ago. I think it was Paul Young who said this. I was watching a video of him giving his testimony before Church, the guy who wrote the shack,

Unknown Speaker  36:03
and he was saying that he made this statement. He was talking about his life, and you know, he had in this affair, in the moment where his wife came or gave him a call and said, I need to talk to you. And they sat down. She said, I know.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
And just the fallout from that close to suicide afterwards, you know, just all sorts of very human experiences. And he made this statement. He said, God's I've come to see that God's wrath is his love

Unknown Speaker  36:39
standing in the presence of pure truth, when you you have a diluted form of truth within you,

Unknown Speaker  36:49
you can't, not but be

Unknown Speaker  36:54
destroyed. And

Unknown Speaker  36:56
maybe that's what Jesus is talking about, you know, unless the seed falls to the ground and dies. It can't sprout and grow. You know, a lot of this imagery that we talk about, but maybe part of that that Saul, like David, like experience Moses Abraham out in the desert, is coming to experience God's love in such a way that it feels like wrath. It feels like death, the

Unknown Speaker  37:25
purification that the sifting that happens.

Unknown Speaker  37:32
There's a force of impact that when you mention wrath like there's this felt sense of impact.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
But what you're suggesting is in the in the human wrath that we experience. It's one person's ego, one person's will against another, the overpowering of will. And what you're describing is it's the, I mean, it really is the it's the running full sprint and chanting to yourself, the wall isn't there. The wall isn't there. The wall isn't there, right? I guess the

Unknown Speaker  38:03
wall is there. The wall might be there.

Unknown Speaker  38:07
I had this conversation recently where

Unknown Speaker  38:12
this lady was talking about how she rage cleans sometimes to deal with her

Unknown Speaker  38:22
nervous system just being so dysregulated. And she started to describe this, and she had this time where she started cleaning, but it wasn't rage.

Unknown Speaker  38:31
And I suggested maybe it's wrath cleaning, and

Unknown Speaker  38:35
maybe that's a healthy thing.

Unknown Speaker  38:38
The Rage is destructive. There's something that's being destroyed within that because it's fear based, it's fear driven,

Unknown Speaker  38:47
but if it's wrath, it's love driven,

Unknown Speaker  38:51
and there's something that's getting worked out inside me

Unknown Speaker  38:54
as I do this,

Unknown Speaker  38:57
and maybe that's the difference between another difference within the desert is rage versus wrath. Am I submitting to

Unknown Speaker  39:06
the excoriating experience of God's love in that place, or am I just experiencing this as rage as destruction?

Unknown Speaker  39:21
Do you have these people? And I'm sure you've probably read about them or seen videos or whatever, where they've been through the fire multiple times,

Unknown Speaker  39:33
and they're on the other side of it, and they look back and they go,

Unknown Speaker  39:38
I can see now how beautiful that was, how much I needed it, how much I learned in that season who I've become as a person because of it.

Unknown Speaker  39:53
How do you do that, other than understanding the all consuming things?

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Fire that love is,

Unknown Speaker  40:03
and being able to look back and see the beauty that came from the ashes, we like to sing about it in church, beauty from the ashes and but you don't know unless you've been through that the price you pay, or beauty coming from ashes.

Unknown Speaker  40:22
We you don't know the price, but you also don't know the value, and

Unknown Speaker  40:27
as well,

Unknown Speaker  40:31
one of the things I've personally wrestled with is that in my

Unknown Speaker  40:37
I don't know, I would say my life has been actually quite relatively free from suffering, but in my own journeys through difficulty, and I've seen what going into the desert can bring

Unknown Speaker  40:52
it, this

Unknown Speaker  40:56
is Maybe way too honest, but

Unknown Speaker  41:01
when other people start to describe their entrance into the desert, there's this excitement in my inside of me,

Unknown Speaker  41:08
yeah, because

Unknown Speaker  41:11
from their perspective, which feels very wrong, in an attempt to be sensitive to what they're experiencing, that's the part that feels so wrong, but the other part is the knowing of the beauty of what emerges and my favorite people in the world. I'm sure, if you would, if I would, some of them, I should just sit down and ask, because I know beyond a shadow of a doubt if I were to sit down with some of my favorite people in the world and ask them, tell me what your desert was, where was the pressure? Where was the fire? What? What shaped you into who you are today? I I'm confident that they have a story in which they were brought to the

Unknown Speaker  41:50
they were taken out into the desert, and he was the only one who could sustain them, right, right?

Unknown Speaker  41:58
I was sitting with a friend of mine recently, and

Unknown Speaker  42:02
in the midst of a pretty dark time for me,

Unknown Speaker  42:07
and he was just listening and asking questions and just just being what he could for me at the point. And he looked at me a certain point he goes,

Unknown Speaker  42:20
I'm kind of jelly, jealous of you, envious,

Unknown Speaker  42:25
and in the midst of it, I'm like, why?

Unknown Speaker  42:29
Oh, all right. And he goes, because I haven't been through this season,

Unknown Speaker  42:38
and I know that I need to, and at some point God's going to bring it about.

Unknown Speaker  42:44
And I looked at him, and I go, I don't want this for you.

Unknown Speaker  42:48
I don't want this for you.

Unknown Speaker  42:50
And he goes, he said something along the lines of, like, watch what you say,

Unknown Speaker  42:57
because you could be standing in front of what God is trying to do, keeping me from this season.

Unknown Speaker  43:04
It's like, oh man,

Unknown Speaker  43:10
I know what this feels like. I know what this because I'm in the midst of it,

Unknown Speaker  43:15
in the midst of it, of His wrath,

Unknown Speaker  43:19
in the midst of it. And

Unknown Speaker  43:21
I don't want, I don't I don't want my best friend to experience that much less my worst enemy.

Unknown Speaker  43:31
And yet I know that, I know that, I know from my experiences that it is the best thing that can happen.

Unknown Speaker  43:48
But that wrath,

Unknown Speaker  43:55
there will come a point, and I suspect

Unknown Speaker  43:59
David

Unknown Speaker  44:00
Peter Paul Abraham, Moses, all these people,

Unknown Speaker  44:07
I suspect that they

Unknown Speaker  44:11
are grateful For the wrath,

Unknown Speaker  44:17
for the love that exposed them to.

Unknown Speaker  44:23
And I'm talking in a very I'm talking about God's love that exposed them.

Unknown Speaker  44:31
He uses, I believe, situations, people, circumstances in our lives for that to happen. And

Unknown Speaker  44:40
I'm not talking about the individuals that are part of that playing out.

Unknown Speaker  44:46
I'm talking about the process of wrath purifying us.

Unknown Speaker  44:57
There's something here Matthias, like we.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Talk about trauma, combat, PTSD and that kind of thing. And it is a very real thing, but I think there's something modern in that look back onto that what

Unknown Speaker  45:12
we would probably consider more violent time. The way war was handled was face to face, hand to hand, shield walls, you know, all that kind of stuff.

Unknown Speaker  45:24
But there's something that is formed in a person in that type of battle

Unknown Speaker  45:30
that creates a strength,

Unknown Speaker  45:33
if you allow it to.

Unknown Speaker  45:37
And maybe that's part of what we're missing

Unknown Speaker  45:42
as men in this culture

Unknown Speaker  45:46
and maybe maybe metaphorical, maybe real world

Unknown Speaker  45:51
in our internet culture, where you can sit behind a keyboard and you can attack somebody, you can send an email, or you can do a social media post and never have to come face to face with that person.

Unknown Speaker  46:06
I think, I think if we had to,

Unknown Speaker  46:09
I mean, I think it's very clear, if you're looking at the world, that the weapons, the weapons of our warfare today are psychological, yes, hence the surge of interest in things centered around psychology, how what is the shield that I need to pick up? What is the sword that I need to carry? How do I use this for good and not for evil? How do I protect the people who need protection? And

Unknown Speaker  46:36
even even from a leadership standpoint, it's, it's the shift has been so profound over the last

Unknown Speaker  46:44
2020, years that many

Unknown Speaker  46:49
there's a generational shift in terms of leadership. For for people who are

Unknown Speaker  46:57
older generations in leadership are needing to adapt, to understand the world, the psychological warfare that the younger generations are experiencing in some capacity. I mean, the back ended comments on fake on social media is a perfect example of that.

Unknown Speaker  47:17
I'm very curious. From your perspective, there's there's two potentially related questions. But you talked about the formation of the person, the the I don't know how you exactly described it, but the idea was that in the desert, there's a sense of wholeness, of coherence as a person that emerges.

Unknown Speaker  47:36
And I would love to hear more of your explain, explanation of what that actually is. In addition to that, the question of, in in the what do you see?

Unknown Speaker  47:48
What is the formation that you that you see emerging from the type of hand to hand combat, more violent type of warfare that would have been historically prevalent,

Unknown Speaker  48:02
I would say, primarily. And this is a big picture, conceptual look, 10,000 foot down look is, is

Unknown Speaker  48:12
that, that what happens is, you cannot run away from your fear. You're in the midst of it. It is right in front of you in a very real, physical way.

Unknown Speaker  48:25
And so confronting the fear, which I would say is the issue that all of us deal with, is fear in one form or another.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
And I think that that's the enemy's primary tactic, is to get us to be afraid. Because when we're afraid, we're controllable.

Unknown Speaker  48:44
And I think in these these very real senses, this is a object lesson, and what it looks like to confront your fear. What does it look like to have somebody in front of me that has a sword and has armor and I know wants to kill me? I

Unknown Speaker  49:04
me, that's a fear. That's a fear, yeah, and you've got somebody like David, who, as a shepherd, is out in the fields and has to protect his flock.

Unknown Speaker  49:16
He knows that there is going to be some sort of beast that is going to attack his flock, and he has to protect his flock,

Unknown Speaker  49:25
and so he has to come face to face with fear like that in a very early age.

Unknown Speaker  49:38
I was sitting with with with this couple over the weekend, and the the husband was talking about, you know, work experiences, and some person that he was involved in a in a ministry with, and he really didn't like him. And within the context of the team building exercise, they had to do this exercise where they stood across from each other and.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
Looked into each other's eyes and said no words,

Unknown Speaker  50:04
and he's like my thought was, I hate this guy. How am I going to stand eye to eye with him?

Unknown Speaker  50:14
And I asked him, What was behind the hate.

Unknown Speaker  50:18
He sat there for a few minutes, and he said, to be really honest, I was afraid. I was afraid of him,

Unknown Speaker  50:27
and then I had to face that fear by standing across from him and looking into his eyes without words or an extended period of time, maybe a minute, two minutes, whatever, whatever the case was,

Unknown Speaker  50:40
he had to face his fear.

Unknown Speaker  50:45
And I think that that is what is missing in our world

Unknown Speaker  50:54
when my students come into and out of my class.

Unknown Speaker  50:59
The first day, I set this rule when you come into the class,

Unknown Speaker  51:05
we look each other in the eye, and we say, Good morning or good afternoon, whatever that whatever the the time of day is.

Unknown Speaker  51:14
And I want them to get used to eye contact,

Unknown Speaker  51:19
because it humanizes both of us. I'm not just this authority within a room and you're not just this kid who's sitting there

Unknown Speaker  51:29
like it humanizes us.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
And for all the great things about what the internet can do and what I online platforms can do and all that kind of stuff, what's missing is the eye to eye contact,

Unknown Speaker  51:45
and I think that that is something that has to happen in our world for us to mature,

Unknown Speaker  51:56
which, as I say. Now you probably know this from all of your research and attachment theory. My understanding is that

Unknown Speaker  52:02
that eye contact is one of the primary ways that humans synchronize emotions Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  52:09
There's a there's a book called Iron John, written by a guy named Robert Bly, and he's

Unknown Speaker  52:15
talking about the formation of a man.

Unknown Speaker  52:18
And to to your point, what we've been talking about, as far as you know, combat, trauma, all that kind of stuff. He says that historically, over time, we've gone from face to face encounters, at least in the warrior sphere, we've gone from warrior which is an essential part of development of any person,

Unknown Speaker  52:39
and we distanced it

Unknown Speaker  52:44
where it was face to face, then it's a slingshot, then it's an arrow, then it's a rifle, then it's a missile, and it extends outwards.

Unknown Speaker  52:55
And so what's lost is that warrior identity that comes up so you become a soldier, yes, but a soldier is not a warrior

Unknown Speaker  53:07
in the classical sense of it.

Unknown Speaker  53:11
So this is really fascinating, because we Okay, jump back to the stories of the situations I described earlier. At the beginning, there's a very real sense in which,

Unknown Speaker  53:23
imagine this, we're on a battlefield, the equivalent, if you could make this tangible, the equivalent is you have the king, and then you have the general, and then you have the foot soldiers, and the king in general are hiding in the back, and be like, foot soldiers go like, you take the hit, like, and When you frame in that perspective, it's like, wow, that's kind of twisted. The other thing that's fascinating

Unknown Speaker  53:48
in there's, I was watching an interview this past week between Alex or mosey and Tony Robbins. And Tony Robbins was talking about so Alex or mosey is known for just a sheer amount of discipline. Just show up, do the work. Lives, eat, sleeps, work like he just gets stuff done, gets a massive amount of stuff done, and he's, he's, that's how he's built, built his businesses and

Unknown Speaker  54:14
and he was talking with with they were having a conversation around purpose and joy and some of these types of things, Tony Robbins shared that the experience for himself, where he cares about hunger, because that's that was what he experienced as a as a child, right? There were key moments. And so for a while, he was writing checks like, let's solve the hunger. One of the things that he mentioned that made the big shift from this, just for this actually to have meaning, was to put on a hat, put on a t shirt and go, go serve the food with the people needing it, and eye to eye, face to face, face to face, because it humanizes it. It.

Unknown Speaker  55:00
It puts it into the context of reality, and it brings meaning and purpose to it. And

Unknown Speaker  55:08
I do think this is not the expert here in borrowing and other people's opinions that make sense to me, but I do think that the increasing push towards towards

Unknown Speaker  55:21
technology and digital, the digital world. And the shift that AI is bringing about

Unknown Speaker  55:27
is is also bringing a rebound towards face to face and eye to eye. And

Unknown Speaker  55:33
we saw covid do that in an extent where people realize just how valuable that actually is. And

Unknown Speaker  55:40
you almost have to taste the extreme to say, Well, no, the extreme really isn't that good, like,

Unknown Speaker  55:46
all right?

Unknown Speaker  55:48
Well, there's something about union there, right?

Unknown Speaker  55:52
And talking about with attachment theory, eye to eye is one way to, you know, sink emotions integrate, right?

Unknown Speaker  56:00
Well, there's also in union, there is the face to face, but in that face to face, you have the option to seek to dominate in the face to face, or to seek union in face to face. And what is war, but that face to face seeking dominance, right? You have something I want, or you've done something I didn't like, and so we're going to go face to face. But

Unknown Speaker  56:29
it can also be a it can also be a revolt against domination. So I have something you want, and you're coming to take what's not yours, don't you dare Exactly. And to me, in that sense, there's a there's a the Catholic theology around just war.

Unknown Speaker  56:47
And in that sense, if somebody is invading you, then by all means, you have to stand up. You have to fight for that. Or if somebody is being abused or neglected, or whatever the case may be, you have to face to face with that person who is doing the abusing or neglecting, and you have to get it to stop. There's that process that that the face to face that has to happen, and that's the formation of a person.

Unknown Speaker  57:18
Aside from that, there is no formation.

Unknown Speaker  57:25
This is,

Unknown Speaker  57:28
I have to flash back to the book Kingdom ethics. I don't even remember who wrote it,

Unknown Speaker  57:34
and it's been probably 20 years since I read it, but he was talking about the just war, the idea of just war. And his comment was that just war is always good in theory, it just breaks down in practice, because we all have distorted motives when it comes to war

Unknown Speaker  57:51
and and so but, but that's a very also peeling apart the layers of

Unknown Speaker  58:00
peeling apart the layers of responsibility,

Unknown Speaker  58:04
one of the one of the challenges I have with missional nonprofits as an example. And this is, there's a lot of good that they do, but sometimes their mission can be so driven based on donor metrics that of the people who

Unknown Speaker  58:23
the organization doesn't actually end up carrying the weight of the mission. Yeah. So, so as an example,

Unknown Speaker  58:31
in the case of what I'm most familiar with is, is foster and adoptive parenting in various capacities. It looks incredibly amazing to say, look, we've placed this many kids into this many homes. Like, look at these. These are amazing numbers. And the question is, what happens on the the back? What happens after that? What's, what's the rest of the story? How does that play out?

Unknown Speaker  59:00
Because you can't take a child who, I mean, the amount of disruption to a child generally is, well, it's proportional to the amount of disruptive experiences. So if it's if it's low disruption over long, long period of time, that's going to be less severe than a long disruption over a long period, a big disruption over a long period of time, if but and having a child placed at at in infancy also generally decreases the amount of time of disruption, generally lessens the long term effect, even though

Unknown Speaker  59:43
there's a lot of things that happen in utero that do affect a child subconsciously throughout that period, and plus, just anyway, there's a lot of stuff we don't have to get into that the question, the question becomes,

Unknown Speaker  59:57
if our goal is adoption.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:02
And then let's just post the numbers. But if our goal is healthy, integrated adults, who, who can, who who develop, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
actually, maybe it's not, not even that.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
If, if our goal is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
individuals who can find places of belonging and places of being knowing and being known, then we have to stop looking at

Unknown Speaker  1:00:30
this as a metric to achieve, as the adoption as a metric to achieve, but also look at we have to understand

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
that these are situations of need that place

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
a greater than average burden,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
by no fault of anybody besides I mean, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:55
it's a long, complicated

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
story. It's it's often series upon series of people, of stories, of people who've not been known, who've experienced pain and loss, and have been in situations where they that were unmanageable for them and it perpetuated them. And so somebody is stepping in, in some capacity to make this, to help carry things forward. It's always complicated.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:31
Part of the battle picture is not just of defending

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
the person who's being abused. It's of locking your shield with the person next to you who's doing that

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
right.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:49
And this is not just, does not just apply to to this is just one small arena or one small window of places in the world. This can apply to

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01
people who are doing what they can to give women safe safe places to live, to get out of trafficking. It's it's dealing with victims of of abuse, and

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
in all the forms and flavors of that. It's the people dealing with the very practical issue of people losing homes? People need to put food on the table because of adverse situations, and it's very it's incredibly easy and sometimes a difficult

Unknown Speaker  1:02:33
path to navigate to know

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
exactly how much can I carry myself, how much can I lock my my shield with the next person?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
But fundamentally, there has to be a wrestling with that, and there has to be an understanding that we're in this together in some capacity, right? Well, isn't that a profound you asked about the the development of a person through war, you know, kind of thing. Isn't that a primary lesson that is learned in that shield wall, because every person in that shield wall knows you create a gap. That's the end. We're all dead,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:11
right? We have to lock shields together. We have to do it together. You want to go off and run in front and fight the battle? Yeah? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:22
feel free. But you're putting everybody here at risk of death for you making that decision, for your ego to make that decision,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:34
you learn that lesson. Really, really well. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:39
it's burned into you. That's the furnace right there.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:44
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:51
And there's some lessons as human beings that we

Unknown Speaker  1:03:55
will not, cannot, however you want to phrase it, we can't learn other than in battle, whether it's emotional, it's spiritual, it's physical, whatever It is,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:06
those lessons can only be learned in battle.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
In times of peace,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
the the

Unknown Speaker  1:04:34
soldiers are recruited voluntarily by their involition.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:40
And in times of unrest,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
they're recruited by need because the situation demands it.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
And we've had many conversations along these lines throughout the podcast, but it's.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Still there's this returning back to

Unknown Speaker  1:05:03
one of the big enemies is ease and peace and safety,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
and they find it.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:15
I don't know how to

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
communicate this perfectly and accurately. It's we should welcome peace. We should be grateful for peace. We should pray for peace. There's also an honest recognition that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
most of the world has not been peaceful.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:34
And so there's this. There's a sense in which, why are we surprised when there is unrest in the world when lives are threatened, when when leaders do things that they shouldn't do, when you have lawbreakers in positions of power? And

Unknown Speaker  1:05:55
yes, it's disappointing.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:59
If you look in the context of history, it's also

Unknown Speaker  1:06:04
incredibly normal,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
right? Tragically So, but incredibly normal. Yeah, it's not, it's not. It's not a statement to say. It's okay. No, not a statement. It's it's all of these things,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20
and maybe, if anything, it's a statement to say that

Unknown Speaker  1:06:27
there have been many people before us who've walked through

Unknown Speaker  1:06:33
that situations like that, or more difficult things, and the same God who is present for them is the same God who who promises to be present for us as well,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
anything. I think we also see that theme emerging in in these stories, in the Old Testament, there's very real difference between there was a recognition that,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:59
first of all, there was a recognition that not all battles were meant to be fought.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:04
Some were man's battles and some were God's battles. And then there was also recognition. We see this in the story of of Jonathan, when Jonathan

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
broke into the the Philistines and and like there's this chaos, and Saul goes rushing in, and they're all just killing each other

Unknown Speaker  1:07:23
like the Philistines are, and, and,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
and there's the silly vow and all this foolish vowel and all this stuff that that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:33
there's this continual recognition throughout there that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:37
first, the first, the people say, look, Jonathan, won the war. And we mean to say that God won the war, and Jonathan was, in effect, the willing participant. But there's a recognition that,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:51
that there is, I think one of the lessons of it as well, is that there is a greater there's a greater cause. There's a greater good God. This is we can choose to align with,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:03
with God or not, and and we are in his hands, and we trust that the victory is his and not ours,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
but we don't take credit for it. I think, I think perhaps

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
that's another useful lesson from

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
as we look at that.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32
There's a sense, like, as you're talking this phrase you know kind of came to mind, like there's a sense, if in your life, you have never found yourself in a position that

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
you didn't want to be? You wish you could be out of but there is no way out of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
You truly have never entered the desert.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:56
And I'm not talking about it was uncomfortable for you.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:00
I'm talking about. Your skin is crawling. You wish the floor would open up and you could fall through, like be away from this situation. And you're like a like Jesus in the garden. You're You're like a caged animal,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
and you're sweating blood.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:19
And in that moment that that switch flipping moment where you're honest enough to say, God, if you can take this away, please do.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:29
But at the end of the day, I want what you want.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:34
If you haven't had a moment like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
then you haven't been through the desert, you I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:45
and my heart breaks for you, like

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
when the bills are stacking up and you have no way to pay.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
Them

Unknown Speaker  1:10:01
when the child is in the hospital with cancer and there's nothing you can do. What

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
do you

Unknown Speaker  1:10:20
do? You do in that moment?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
Do you pray? What that prayer Do you have that conversation with God? God? If you can take this away, if you can make it different,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
please do.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
But at the end of the day, I don't see everything. I don't know everything. What you want is more important. So I'm going to go through whatever it is that is in front of me. If

Unknown Speaker  1:10:47
you hadn't had that moment,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:51
don't pretend you have some sort of maturity or some sort of standing.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:01
It's limited,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:04
because you can stand back and you can judge and you can project all you want onto people, but until you've been in that position, and you know what it feels like,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
You got nothing to say.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:22
You there's nothing for you to say.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:26
But the danger is we, as human beings, pretend like we do have something to say,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:34
and we don't.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
We. We have a compulsion to fill the silence.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:45
I have a compulsion to fill the silence. Let's be honest. Yeah, me too,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:51
especially when it's uncomfortable.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
And that's the formation of a person, right? Going back to Saul, and what we were talking about, like, that's the that's the formation of person.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
At any moment, Saul could have been like,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:18
Man, I really screwed that up. There's something for me to learn here.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:26
But there's this continual pattern of externalizing comfort or soothing, whether it's via Samuel or it's via David, or it's via mediums, or it's whatever the case may be, there's this externalizing of soothing

Unknown Speaker  1:12:47
so on a very fundamental sense, I started talking about responsibility,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53
That's where the rubber meets the road.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:02
Well, I found that I don't know what your experience has been. I found that the bigger experience of helplessness

Unknown Speaker  1:13:11
have helped me to surrender to the helplessness in smaller situations. Yeah, and when you're in a situation that's so dramatically outside of your control, it

Unknown Speaker  1:13:24
does give you opportunity to see things from a different perspective, and then

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
it opens up the door for God to start working with you in smaller, less dramatic ways, Where

Unknown Speaker  1:13:40
I don't have a good example, but I just

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
situations that are uncomfortable, where, in the past, you would have managed your way out of,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
yeah, and you throw up your hands and surrender in some part to say, I don't have to manage. I won't. I will. I choose not to manage my way out of and allow this to form what needs to be formed in me,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
right? And that's that's not irresponsibility,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:17
man. I mean, it can be misconstrued as irresponsibility.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:22
Um, easily,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
easily miscons

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
what one of my friends, I think this is one of my friends, recently observed he's like, Yeah, you seem to be a lot more comfortable just telling people now and letting them deal with the fallout of that and

Unknown Speaker  1:14:42
and I was like, Well, let's take that as a compliment. And I think there's this, there's there's also this recognition of our own humanity. I only have so many people I can realistically help. I do have people who are depending on me to show up emotionally.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Physically and in spiritually, in all the ways,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:05
and,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
and,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:11
and maybe this, maybe this is more of an issue of being unwilling to really help people who don't take responsibility for them, for themselves,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
who would have capacity? Should they choose to

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
that was more like a random thought,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
well, there's, there's something that strikes me in the midst of that, like on the other side, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:41
until I sit down. And I think this is very Matthew 18, focus until I sit down, look you in the eye,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:48
ask you questions. Have a conversation with you. I have no right to judge whether you're being responsible or you're blame shifting, or I have no right whatsoever,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:01
because I have no context for that. The only context I have is my perception and the emotions attached to it, right? I can't do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
And so we sit down, we have this conversation,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
and we listen to each other, okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:21
And then maybe there's still some things to iron out.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:25
So we bring two or three others in and say, Hey, can you give us some perspective here?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:32
And we all sit down, and we all look eye to eye, and we all ask questions. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:39
then there's still some things that need to be ironed out.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
So we bring it to the these elders, these these people who have lived a long time and gained this wisdom. And we go, Hey, what do you see here?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
There's no confrontation here. There's just knowing and being known.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:01
So until I have done that,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:04
I have zero right to judge whether you're taking responsibility or not, zero, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:14
We don't want to do that as human beings. We

Unknown Speaker  1:17:23
anytime I get an email from a parent or, you know, that kind of thing, my first thing is, hey, let's sit down face to face and talk.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:32
Let's see what's here.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
Look me in the eye. I'll look you in the eye. Let's have a conversation. Let's ask the questions that need to be asked.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
If we need to acknowledge fault, we'll acknowledge fault,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:49
and then we'll move forward. That's the way we're designed, but everything in our culture seems to be separating us from face to face conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:01
If I can send a text message, or I can send an email or I can do a social media post or

Unknown Speaker  1:18:08
whatever the case may be.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
And our urgency, our efficiency, our desire to get things handled like that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:19
is killing us.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
This is where I hate my analytical part of me. So

Unknown Speaker  1:18:37
which proposing? Buckle up.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40
What you're proposing sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
It doesn't work

Unknown Speaker  1:18:47
if honesty can't exist in the conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:52
And the refusal, the outright

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
refusal to be honest, is is easier to deal with

Unknown Speaker  1:19:03
than the

Unknown Speaker  1:19:06
pretense of honesty.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:10
If I I agree with you 100%

Unknown Speaker  1:19:14
and I think it's, it's a two person equation there, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:18
If I'm sitting down with you, and I suspect that you haven't been honest with me, it is incumbent on me to create an environment where you can be honest,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:32
right? If I'm truly interested in you as a person, if I just want to be right, then, no, it's not incumbent on me to create that environment.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
But if I truly am called to walk in the path that Jesus has laid out before us, it is incumbent on me to create an environment where you can be honest, not a gotcha moment, not a.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Logical fallacy that I can catch you in none of that.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:04
I give you the opportunity, the space to be honest with me.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:11
Okay, now if you, if you aren't able to do that, at the end of that conversation, I'm going to ask you, have you been completely honest with me and

Unknown Speaker  1:20:25
you say, yes. I say, Well, we've got nowhere to go then,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:31
because it gave you every opportunity.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:35
And I'm, I'm, this is me, but I would probably say multiple conversations, I'm not

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
just going to walk away and walk away and go. Thias is just lying to me. I'm done.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:48
It's multiple conversations, and if at the end of that, we still can't get to the truth,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:57
then where do we go?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:00
That's Saul hiding in the baggage. Can't find you.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:08
but it is incumbent on

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
us to create spaces where each other have the the space to share what they honestly think and feel.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:24
So, What? What? What are the traits? What is that mean? This is probably a whole other episode, so forgive me for asking this right at the end. But

Unknown Speaker  1:21:36
how,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:39
how do you create? How do you do how do you do that? How do you create that space? What must be present, what I'm going to do in that space, and this is just my personal opinion. Is, hey, I love you. I care about you. I want to know where you're coming from.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:56
I'm here not to catch you in anything. I'm here to know you,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:02
and in knowing you, I'm committing to walking through whatever comes out with you.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:10
This is an attempt at Union.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:14
This is an attempt at Friendship,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:18
to use the old Christian term at fellowship.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23
That's what my goal is. That's my mindset.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27
I'm here asking to be your friend, to know you not so I can punish you or not. So I can, you know, excommunicate you, but so I can walk through whatever comes with you? I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:09
She's a direct assault

Unknown Speaker  1:23:12
on

Unknown Speaker  1:23:14
achievement, urgency, accomplishment, yes, and it's impossible to have

Unknown Speaker  1:23:28
those two things can't coexist, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:34
and I would approach it that way, because I have had experiences on both side of that conversation

Unknown Speaker  1:23:44
where tragic, horrific mistakes have been made, and the healing thing for me was somebody sitting there saying that to me and then walking it out. And then I have had situations where I was on the other side where tragic mistakes had been made. Horrific mistakes have been made. David esque mistakes had been made.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:06
And see a person open up and allow another and to walk through them, it's the only thing that will bring about healing in us as human beings,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:19
is a safe space to be able to process what just happened.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:30
And there's no glossing over the details. There's no like putting it upside Now, this isn't that big of a deal. No, you have to be honest in that space and go, Yeah, this is this is this is horrific, this is bad,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:47
this is painful, this is all these things, and there's no judgment. It's acknowledging the truth of the circumstances, and we're

Unknown Speaker  1:24:55
going to walk through it together.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
The tragedy comes when.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
Mean to me, at least when one or the other refuses to do that. And then there's all sorts of identity that happens, there's all sort of shame that happens. There's all sorts of

Unknown Speaker  1:25:12
soul death that happens in that space. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:42
think I well, I suggest we just quick wrap this up, so we'll have to deal with the uncomfortable silence and the uncomfortable

Unknown Speaker  1:25:50
implications of what you're saying, the lingering

Unknown Speaker  1:25:54
Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:02
Yeah, I think that's fair.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:08
I mean, there's so much,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:10
there's so much.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:13
Can you imagine what would have changed

Unknown Speaker  1:26:16
in Saul Jonathan David's life,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
had they been able to legitimately do that? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:27
Sam put Samuel in the mix.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:29
Yeah, to

Unknown Speaker  1:26:31
have that kind of conversation, it's very intriguing question,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:37
right

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39
for next time

Unknown Speaker  1:26:42
i All right, wonderful. Always a pleasure

Unknown Speaker  1:26:48
all of you guys listening.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:51
Thanks for Thanks for your participation. And love to hear from you guys and Kevin, it's I appreciate the time together and looking forward to next time you as well, me too, until next time.
