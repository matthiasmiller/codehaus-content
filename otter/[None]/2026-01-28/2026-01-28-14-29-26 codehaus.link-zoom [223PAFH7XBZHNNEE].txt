Matthias Miller  00:14
Hey, isn't this going to be an issue for reporting liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  00:21
Yeah, that was my thought,

Speaker 1  00:30
yeah, don't we need them? I mean, can you file taxes if you don't know

Matthias Miller  00:40
the other rates, I'm going to assume not but, I mean, but even even to calculate the rate, you're going to have to know whether it's inside or outside of city limits, as an example, you can't just like somebody has to look it up somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  00:55
I mean, that's what I thought. I think I just tell Dwayne he's wrong. I

Unknown Speaker  01:18
mean, I hope he is, because I'm tired of reworking things,

Matthias Miller  01:22
oh, yeah, I mean,

Speaker 1  01:25
and it's something that we're not gonna like. It just be a temporary patch, even if, if it was even reasonable to do that April, yeah, it'd be undoing the work we've done. Dwayne we need to,

Matthias Miller  01:48
I mean, I suppose. I mean, everybody, are we going to be recording a first month's rent or something? Sorry, what? The only reason we don't need it is if the only payment we're getting is for a security deposit?

Speaker 1  02:02
Security deposit for rent, which they will they don't do zero down.

Matthias Miller  02:11
I don't know quicker Valley might, but I'm not sure I

Unknown Speaker  02:28
up front, If you

Matthias Miller  02:34
disagree, let's chat about the next three months. I think we have to do that.

Unknown Speaker  02:45
Okay, sounds good. Okay, well, that makes me happier.

Matthias Miller  02:51
Tax exempt.

Unknown Speaker  02:56
That's good. Is that just a setting on the whole, the whole

Speaker 1  03:05
contract, I think so. How does it? Why is an RTO contract tax exempt? If the church does RTO,

Matthias Miller  03:17
I don't know. I mean, fill in the blank.

Speaker 1  03:22
So and what happens if you switch to tax exempt after two months?

Speaker 1  03:34
Do we clear everything? We clear your tax fields. We clear everything in the clear all tax details and invoice and itemization our G's, and then you have payments that are too much.

Matthias Miller  03:56
I think, I mean, if you don't have proof of tax exemption, we're required to charge tax. My instinct, I don't know I'm not doing, but my instinct from accounting side is, sorry guys, you should go file with the state and get your refund from the state and include all your proof, because we filed it because we didn't know. We can't just take your word for it. So is that wrong, or at least for historical invoices?

Speaker 1  04:29
So then you're saying, you're saying, we don't touch historical invoices if they change to tax exempt, yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:39
or at least not paid or not future, but I don't know which one for sure.

Unknown Speaker  04:47
I mean that also sort of sounds like a question to Yeah, that we need to bring Dwayne in on.

Matthias Miller  04:52
Can you put something in the proposal to with the to do to discuss, yeah, tax exempt changes and for. Now, for now, I would just keep it simple and just don't incur it going forward, and we'll handle changes.

Speaker 1  05:14
Where do you want the comment? Do you care? Should be in the Colorado section, somewhere else, a new section. Under project management, under

Matthias Miller  05:24
Project Management Plan, yeah, changing tax exempt status, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  05:49
I Good, yep, okay, so for now, add a field for tax exempt, and it'll just affect anything going forward.

Matthias Miller  06:00
Yes, and my instinct is that anything copy from the contract definition, as far as taxability of fees, etc, would persist, sure. And just when we itemize it, we would sure

Speaker 1  06:11
that makes sense. Yeah, okay, and you would clear the jurisdiction and rates. No, we need still jurisdiction and race to know where

Unknown Speaker  06:22
to file, right? Okay, so it's just handling it.

Matthias Miller  06:27
Then in the itemization, the tax amount basically ends up, well, it's everything goes to non taxable stuff.

Speaker 1  06:36
Well, it's just, yeah, you just, well, it's just that, going forward, you don't check the taxable checkbox in the itemization. Row, right? Oh, easy. Okay, I like it. Okay. Okay, perfect. Awesome. Thanks.
