You can't fix the car. while it's running

Speaker 1  00:04
earlier, we took a look at the importance of being proactive and being willing to speak and and setting your own agenda instead of letting other people set your agenda for you.

Speaker 1  00:17
This is important for more than just getting important things done. This is important to make sure that the right things are are getting done as a leader,

Unknown Speaker  00:28
whether you're a

Unknown Speaker  00:32
an investor, a CEO,

Unknown Speaker  00:35
a manager,

Unknown Speaker  00:38
or a department,

Speaker 1  00:41
head or department, I guess. So

Speaker 1  00:51
you will only be able to improve incrementally while you're engaged in the actual work that you're doing. If you want to provide exponential improvement. If you want to apply exponential improvement to the things that you're doing, you must take time to step away from the operations

Unknown Speaker  01:10
and be able to look at at what you're doing

Unknown Speaker  01:13
from the big picture

Unknown Speaker  01:17
how you do this,

Unknown Speaker  01:19
the best way

Unknown Speaker  01:21
is to set aside and extend a big block of time

Unknown Speaker  01:25
and you might choose to

Speaker 1  01:30
let's back that up. How do you do this? First of all, the most important thing is that you set aside a block of time that you're unavailable for for interruptions allow yourself time that is focused exclusively on high level strategic questions, number to prepare yourself with some high level strategic questions to answer

Speaker 1  01:53
what are the things that are going well? What are the things that are going wrong? If you want it to dramatically improve the profitability of your business? What would have to change? If you wanted to dramatically improve the quality of your employees? What would have to change? What are what are trends in the market that that are going to impact your

Speaker 1  02:16
business negatively, what are opportunities in the market that are being unexploited at the moment

Speaker 1  02:27
and then number three, allow yourself time to think about and process these questions. Sometimes it's helpful to actively disengage

Speaker 1  02:37
for me, I find that some of my best thinking comes on a mountain bike

Unknown Speaker  02:44
on some local

Unknown Speaker  02:49
mountain trails

Speaker 1  02:53
when my mind is actively engaged in in something else that I intentionally allow myself to daydream

Unknown Speaker  03:00
and then disengage from needing to find the perfect answer.

Speaker 1  03:03
I find that my subconscious works for me and I often I often discover new ideas and creative solutions to the problems that I'm facing.

Speaker 1  03:14
Everything within your schedule is fighting against you to do this.

Speaker 1  03:20
The world is created to keep you know, I mean, don't say that

Speaker 1  03:31
the world around you will drive you to be average.

Speaker 1  03:36
But if you want different outcomes, you must intentionally choose to

Unknown Speaker  03:46
break from the status quo.

Unknown Speaker  03:49
Be proactive,

Unknown Speaker  03:53
make change

Unknown Speaker  03:56
lead intentionally and let's win.
