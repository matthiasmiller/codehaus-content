Unknown Speaker  00:17
Mr. Ben Ellis

Unknown Speaker  00:20
yeah pretty well how are things they're

Speaker 1  00:24
pretty good here as well yeah good let me change my time here

Unknown Speaker  00:36
just a second it was

Unknown Speaker  00:53
excellent

Unknown Speaker  01:01
right well just if you've got questions

Unknown Speaker  01:17
okay, sorry, just a second here

Unknown Speaker  01:20
all right?

Unknown Speaker  02:52
Okay, I'm back. Well,

Unknown Speaker  02:56
where do you want to go?

Speaker 2  03:00
All right, so we got a list of items here. pretty healthy list. We get all the way through it or not. But we start at the top and work our way down through I think. So first looking at I think we have questions for you here in cinders.

Speaker 2  03:29
First off, as far as the we talked about redirecting from a button on their website, is that something that we would want to offer here for phase one? Because that's basically that's them making something a change on their redirect their website?

Speaker 3  03:51
Yeah, I think they could say that they can link to the solution from their website. I mean, that that should work. So, yeah. But I mean, it is it's essentially just having their web developer point to point to our URL, we can and we can also quite possibly. We can work with them then for deployment so that it the URL in the title bar doesn't look like it's app posting. It'll look, it'll it'll be something like, you know, app.ap dot, sim, biz.com or whatever. We could work with them on those details during deployment that that's pretty simple server configuration on their side.

Unknown Speaker  04:55
All right. Sounds good

Speaker 3  05:03
I mean from a proposal standpoint I think all I would say is that we will that we will help configure or we will work with their web developer to try to tile or we or we can work with their with their web developer to to

Speaker 1  05:23
to try to add a log to add a login link to their website

Unknown Speaker  05:50
good

Speaker 2  05:55
day and Okay this has already been discussed

Speaker 3  06:04
oh god scroll up to the just scroll up to the pricing here

Unknown Speaker  06:13
okay

Unknown Speaker  06:15
did you put that in here or we're

Speaker 3  06:18
done no, I'm looking at this user pricing right here. Gotcha. So so this should actually probably go into the addendum shouldn't debt

Unknown Speaker  06:29
yes it should

Unknown Speaker  06:47
I think what we will do is I let me think this through if we

Speaker 3  07:06
can Why don't you change that comp standard monthly cost? And then and then and then the standard pricing is as follows and then so at the top there potential standard price every as long as as follows

Unknown Speaker  07:36
and okay

Speaker 3  07:47
as a sim is partner code crafters is offering a 50% discount or is offering a 50% discount on per on the per user on this on the per Sander per user fees or fees prices what sounds nice rates rates like that. So and why don't you actually say as a simple as marketing partner and there because I want them to keep remembering that the reason we're doing this so we can market to your people. All right. Good.

Unknown Speaker  08:45
Okay Okay.

Speaker 2  08:50
Sounds good. And then all of this I think is well, I'll just bump this down

Unknown Speaker  09:09
on pricing too.

Speaker 3  09:14
I mean, so so as far as trial Well, first of all, we've just hit it out of the park so far on price. I mean, design is our biggest, almost our biggest ticket item so far. So yeah, and I think a bunch of well two things, this is the more tangible or solutions or I think the easier it is to design and we also spend a lot of time trying to work out simple designs. So the let me think so. So as far as, okay and my pricing you So I had talked about I had talked what price range had I put in there for mobile support for full mobile support?

Unknown Speaker  10:14
IE, here, I'm just gonna copy this in

Unknown Speaker  10:30
okay.

Speaker 3  10:33
And why don't we go ahead just put this up with the pricing option for the most part. Well, the top section should go up in the pricing into the instead of in the in this section up in the additional or Yeah, well, I'm wondering about that at least. It doesn't, it doesn't matter that much.

Unknown Speaker  10:55
Yeah, we'll end up moving it up there.

Unknown Speaker  10:58
Just a second that might be Walmart here, okay.

Unknown Speaker  11:35
Okay

Unknown Speaker  11:45
so we're so we are

Unknown Speaker  11:53
Yeah.

Speaker 2  11:59
Our memo isn't wide enough here? Sure.

Speaker 3  12:16
So then the user section should change that two gig storage stuff is the same testing system will be included will do $100. Base and maintenance

Unknown Speaker  12:34
would be?

Speaker 3  12:36
Let me see here. I think I'd like to charge a bit more for me. So we've seen We've been saying 10 to 15%, right. 45,000 times point one, five.

Speaker 1  12:58
So divided by 12.

Speaker 3  13:04
So I think we should for maintenance, we should charge where we usually list that but 550 either, it should be 550 a month, or 5500. A year?

Unknown Speaker  13:24
So

Speaker 2  13:25
let's see. Subscription maintenance and support. Yeah, you say how much 550 a month?

Unknown Speaker  13:34
Yeah, 550 a month.

Speaker 3  13:37
For or once you do 525, those 25 bucks won't hurt us. And it sounds like less, or 50 to 50 a year. And that's on both columns. If they ever asked about that, then point out that that this is that this is essentially a 40% discount on the mate on the ongoing maintenance as well. Because we because it's based on this original system price, which is discounted. So

Unknown Speaker  14:12
Right.

Speaker 3  14:16
And I don't know. I kind of wonder if I don't know for sure how to do the user thing it should we just is it just the simp I wonder if we should just I wonder if on every single line that down there, we actually just divide it by two and just show the reduced user rates

Speaker 3  14:49
sorry, has it don't paste nicely into tables. So So what if you would do is scroll down to where you were, and you can maybe finish this out. later but scroll down to like user six to 15 And what if in parentheses

Unknown Speaker  15:09
where would you put it?

Speaker 3  15:11
What if you put it on the description so we change this to be 755 to 50 so then description

Unknown Speaker  15:20
yeah et cetera

Speaker 3  15:26
and then you're going to need to add one more for I forget at what point we scroll up to the top we said 26 to 500 is $5. And then and so then you'd add one more row there which is dollar 25

Unknown Speaker  15:55
Okay

Unknown Speaker  16:02
now

Speaker 3  16:09
is there okay I'm just this is more business question Is there ever

Speaker 3  16:36
we just have to be really clear that if they would ever want to cancel our marketing partnership, I'll I'll add a condition to that you know, because their monthly their user rates would go up their maintenance support would go up etc if they'd ever one of the most likely kind of thing would be three other software companies join and raise a stink that we get we get to do all the marketing and they don't have any

Unknown Speaker  17:13
so right

Unknown Speaker  17:21
I'll just put a note here and you can

Unknown Speaker  17:24
Yeah, sure. Yep. But in as you bike Okay, and

Unknown Speaker  17:37
the base subscription you said is gonna be 100

Unknown Speaker  17:39
yeah

Speaker 3  17:50
I'm excited if we ended up with this, I mean that this would be one of our largest systems out there. So

Unknown Speaker  18:03
okay, okay, I'm going to actually move this

Unknown Speaker  18:11
and just put it on there

Unknown Speaker  18:24
Okay, well that

Unknown Speaker  18:32
here I will

Unknown Speaker  18:40
up there now

Speaker 2  18:44
can we make this child screen wider now that we see that our? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:53
Yeah, just write it up. So. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:02
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:10
Great. And then I'll plan to just put in here for the bad.

Speaker 3  19:18
So I think what you would say is a well, you can list the two options. You could, I mean, I'm pretty nervous about the partial Well, I mean, I would just love to have them go for the full. If the, there is a third option, I mean, kind of a third option, it would probably well, it would be

Speaker 3  19:53
it's some form of integration, you know, kind of partial integration.

Unknown Speaker  20:07
So why don't you just do a to do em? And I'll add some wording here?

Unknown Speaker  20:27
All right. Sounds good. So are you are you about ready to send this thing off? We have.

Speaker 2  20:39
We have some items, different things to finish cleaning up. And I saw there was another question or few from from Jonathan. We're aiming to do it this week here.

Speaker 3  20:56
Well, I mean, here's what I'm wondering if they would go with time and materials approach. I mean, how important are the details that you're wanting to clean out? How important are those for for to assemble themselves? Or is it more just on our side?

Unknown Speaker  21:12
Sure.

Speaker 3  21:16
Because I would love to get this thing sent off. Yeah. Yeah. So So for example, questions about how groups are created. They won't care about that.

Unknown Speaker  21:28
Yeah. Probably most of it's not super important. I mean, again, if Yeah. Yeah, it's just tidying up a bunch of different things.

Speaker 2  21:53
So you may also want to, do you want to go ahead and send numbers over to them before we send them? The the full proposal and the mockups, would you still want to wait?

Speaker 3  22:07
Ah, you could do that. I mean, if we would, or I could do that, maybe what do you think if I would send numbers? Oh, I mean, who would exist do I send it to Dilbert and then copy and you and Matthias and, and then and say that we'll be you know, we'll be sending the full proposal with mockups later this week with here's a you know, here's here's what we're looking at right now and be glad to discuss it with him.

Speaker 2  22:39
I think I think they'd like that he was wanting hate email. It wasn't been on Thursday or Friday asking about price.

Speaker 3  22:47
Okay, so let me just make a note of see if I've got that here my to do list

Unknown Speaker  23:04
I've got that here. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
Okay

Unknown Speaker  23:17
sounds like a plan and yeah, we'll try to get that wrapped up

Speaker 2  23:31
Okay, switching gears. This was why was this one on? Oh, this is Ben's question. On this gold rule lumber question. The client had asked about it. So just wanted to follow up on that

Unknown Speaker  23:58
what would this look like as far as as far as the design and

Unknown Speaker  24:06
well, first of all it this is

Speaker 3  24:15
we need to either get Jen Allen or John or sorry, Janelle And Josh or Matthias to kind of sign the dotted line that they're going to build out this awful framework. And it will be awful it will be poke your eyes out awful. I think you sent me an email about this. The I need to Okay. Okay, so let me just use

Speaker 2  24:49
this something. Is it awful enough that we really don't want to pursue

Speaker 3  24:54
it? Well, it depends if either Matthias or Josh signed it up. added line or get John Allen to sign the dotted line I'm not that scared of it and then we just need to come up with estimates and and warn them how bad it is and things like that so

Unknown Speaker  25:19
okay and I'll copy in a copy and solutions I guess so Allen golden rule actually let me do it this way

Speaker 3  25:39
I'll just reply to this include Josh and Josh and Matthias Are either of you at the place are you're willing to commit to building out a word processor framework

Unknown Speaker  26:15
okay

Speaker 3  26:21
so and then let me just say, Ben you can reply to Alan that we are looking at

Speaker 1  26:33
timeline and resource options and we'll be in touch soon okay yeah okay. So see I don't Well

Speaker 3  26:57
I really don't think Matthias has any capacity to build this out

Unknown Speaker  27:17
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  27:18
so I take

Unknown Speaker  27:30
we'll see we'll see where it goes.

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Okay

Unknown Speaker  27:36
good all right then

Speaker 2  27:56
next one here is this one that came up from the faith builders piece about preventing emails from being sent to the real contacts is there anything that we should include at this point? No

Speaker 3  28:17
no there's no simple answers just yeah and it's yeah, there's no simple answers I'll probably work out design with Matthias at some point but it

Unknown Speaker  28:36
yeah

Unknown Speaker  28:47
anything additional that you'd want to document here before this is fine. Hopefully not dropped off the face of the earth but

Speaker 3  28:55
I mean, it gets if you want to you can assign sign me as an assignee and set a due date of say two months from now or something Sure.

Unknown Speaker  29:17
Yep,

Unknown Speaker  29:19
that was catastrophic, but let's try it.

Speaker 2  29:26
That's drafted you talking about the date? The new days.

Unknown Speaker  29:32
Okay, what's next?

Speaker 2  29:35
Next is this one the email. Let's see here. This was talking about clean up for this. And let's see if

Speaker 3  29:59
so You were saying that they are manually editing rows. I mean, I just think that's, I don't understand. I have not researched what they're doing. But that just feels like a recipe for disaster. Because is that does a maybe it's fine. We certainly should document what they're supposed to do.

Unknown Speaker  30:39
I was thinking about this whole,

Speaker 4  30:42
just the entirety of all the issues that they've had over the last month and a half, and some of them yet are due to the permissions and whatnot uploaded. But none of these are very much either errors. Yeah. And so I was wondering what it would look like to write out workflows, like we aren't. Well, like, this is what has to happen. And you guys can't. Okay, if you do it differently than that things

Speaker 3  31:13
can cause other problems. Yeah. I mean, I think that's reasonable. But my assumption is always that users are stupid. I mean, and that's, you know, I don't, that's only tongue in cheek, but especially when you get 40, distracted, you know, farmers or builders, whatever these people are, who I mean, it's one thing to have a faithfulness user who's in and out of the system, you know, three hours a day, 200 days a year, it's something else to have a farmer who logs in on, on weekends, occasionally, when he has to, and is busy and just, you know, doesn't understand the system. So it's very different use cases. So, so I'm thinking we should say that, that? Well, and I haven't thought it through deeply, but it's something like, agents are cannot edit. Okay, and one step back, I have no problem saying administrators can do whatever they want to do, because it feels to me like the three or four administrators are pretty careful or careful compared to the 30 agents. But I would have no problem. So I think what we could say is that you can't actually they cannot edit the invoice itself, what they have to do is edit the underlying fees, and then regenerate the that on the invoice itself, we could have a button that's called regenerate invoice. And I'm not sure if we're, the other thing that you do is, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:01
And I'd have to see, I'd have to look more at the workflow. But that's the kind of thing I'm getting at that.

Speaker 1  33:11
I wonder if, if we shouldn't be, you know,

Speaker 3  33:18
basically making it harder for them to make mistakes. Now, there's still so many places they can make mistakes and, and I think at the points where it's clear to them all we messed up, then then that's fine. But but so for example, if they edit the invoice now, then are they supposed to do the same edit on the fees? Can they delete a row? The fees? If they haven't deleted? Can? Are they allowed to delete a row from the fees? If if it's already been invoiced? So, so But basically, in some ways, I think this is kind of where you're going back is to say, let's start documenting, you know, what you're supposed to do in various situations, but then I guess the thing I'm adding to it is, but let's also think through what validation and features and stuff we can editability conditions and stuff we can use to keep them from doing wrong things. To try to get that one can't be deleted, it's paid already. What if it's a draft invoice Do you have any idea

Unknown Speaker  34:44
Those are both pay

Speaker 3  34:51
so now RIF invoice Okay, now go back to the invoice. Try to kick

Speaker 2  34:59
Oh, Can we get this invoice? We can't get

Speaker 3  35:03
to it can't edit it now, okay, what you can do is you can cancel the now if your staff can not.

Unknown Speaker  35:11
Nope. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  35:14
So then if it's canceled canceled What do you suppose I bet an admin has to? Today?

Unknown Speaker  35:26
I am, I am an admin. Oh,

Speaker 3  35:30
oh, that's awful. I guess it's awful. Okay, so we do need to think through what the workflow is. So today, the workflow really is, okay, we've done the fees, that it will not change anything beyond that. So at the point where it's invoice, okay, well, I guess what we're saying is at the point where it's invoiced, now, you could delete the trade deleting the invoice instead of just cancel him

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Okay,

Speaker 3  36:05
there we go. So you can delete the invoice and then you could fix your stuff and reiterates. So that would be step one, although I think I'd rather have a way to say if it's in draft mode, but Well, if it's in draft mode, or canceled mode, or, or somehow, you know, it would basically clear out the invoice and then you could get it your because the downside of canceling it isn't then you have an invoice invoice 1571 has just deleting it, it's just going to have a system you don't I mean, without looking at activity history, you have no idea where it went. Somebody tried to pay that invoice now we're really lost.

Unknown Speaker  36:54
So

Speaker 3  36:57
so Another idea would be to say, you know, once an invoice is switched to canceled, then then it's canceling an invoice is the same as deleting it i That would be a pretty clean approach.

Unknown Speaker  37:15
And

Speaker 3  37:20
so so that would be one option. Another option is to say that, that we you move it to draft mode, but that and then once it's in draft mode, you can I don't know, though, I think to I really want the thing to be wiped and all the line items be wiped out before you can edit anything here. So I think it's switched to Kent, when you switch an invoice to cancel, do we still keep the line items there do line items disappear?

Speaker 2  37:53
On the invoice. Yeah, they stay on the invoice. Okay.

Speaker 3  37:57
So we might want to say that you have to switch to cancel and then for their in their system, we would actually were canceled invoices we would actually delete all line items or something or, or you'd have a button that would kick it back into draft mode and wiping out everything and then you could then you would rerun it and fill it back in again on that same invoice number so it's essentially a recreated well I think it'd be a two step process one is one would we somehow need to get rid of the old invoice let them fix other things and then and then recreate the invoice whether it's with the same or different number that's the short answer. So the answer today is that today you cannot edit once it's invoice you cannot edit the fee unless unless you delete the invoice and but you can do manual editing fees. Now once you do manual editing and maybe maybe that's fine we just I'm just not confident in well well that's not really the problems that we're seeing here is it

Unknown Speaker  39:14
yeah so.

Unknown Speaker  39:38
If

Speaker 2  39:45
I guess at its core, the problem is that agents are deleting fees from invoices without without actually deleting the fee from the system.

Speaker 3  39:55
Okay, so you can so is this is our checks more aren't enough that if you delete the row from the invoice then it kills the kills the linking on the fees thing

Unknown Speaker  40:16
So replace

Unknown Speaker  40:17
that where we would

Speaker 3  40:19
be invoice the thing like you just did and then check to see if you delete a fee does that does invoice link disappear for that row if you delete an invoice line items

Unknown Speaker  40:32
so this one here let's see what's going to be this is the hidden 50 case and try this one that's 200 million so change it to draft. Delete that. Save it over here to the vehicle.

Speaker 3  41:11
Yeah, okay. Okay, so we are truly matching it up. Now what if you take another one and change the amount? What do we do then? Change the amount for one that's linked, so So take one of these one ad or that one short, change them out to 54 or whatever, however you want to change it, I don't care. Sure.

Speaker 3  41:47
So, okay, so we're not trying to match up the, the, we're not trying to match up the amounts. Which So, but if they do delete rows off the Yeah, if they do delete or delete, okay, so so there's the problem, we allow them to delete rows. And which isn't really the right thing to do. I mean, you want to delete it in from two places. Now one way to do that, is if we would actually we could do this with an X 30 that would delete it from both places at once. So if you would somehow on this if the end you can only do that the invoice is in draft mode, but it would if you don't so I think what I'm proposing is I think I'm proposing you should never edit the invoice

Speaker 3  42:59
well, we should probably just have a We should probably have a phone discussion with him. The you really need a way to keep these two in lockstep is what you want to do. So they're editing one without editing the other. And we don't let you edit the fees RG so they're editing it on the invoice that's not right, either. Because after you after they hit it on the hit delete on the invoice, or if they change the amount, well if they change the amount that you just become out of sync, which I'm not sure if that actually hurts but it's it's surprising

Speaker 2  43:36
for financial reporting, that would be a little bit right. problematic.

Unknown Speaker  43:41
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  43:45
One thing I want to see though is whether the see an agent cannot cannot delete those rows from the fee rows.

Unknown Speaker  44:02
I see here

Unknown Speaker  44:06
screen sharing

Unknown Speaker  44:08
can an agent edit the invoice or not?

Speaker 2  44:12
Yeah, so that's that's part of the whole problem is so this is logged in with a test standard user and I can't I can't edit anything on the fees and credits. But if I invoice

Speaker 2  44:39
I took a little while. Oh, because I'm a standard user. You got the Yeah, inefficiencies there. I guess, switches the one that just

Unknown Speaker  45:02
Why did it not?

Speaker 3  45:05
There's a 711 in which there Yeah, for 1000.

Speaker 2  45:10
Interesting, it's still got this 5 million or whatever it is. But the fact that it's 5 million means that there was some shenanigans going on in the testing. So like he was testing some quirky stuff. So that okay,

Speaker 3  45:25
if you make it back to back to draft, okay, yeah, you can edit, you can delete it. So I'm wondering if we should consider saying agents are not allowed to edit invoices? Well aren't allowed to add edit amounts. And I'm not sure about moving status back to draft but

Speaker 3  45:56
or, anyway, basically, we need to work through the workflow for edits is the long and short of it.

Unknown Speaker  46:08
Right.

Speaker 2  46:11
So let's go back to my other sharing here.

Unknown Speaker  46:20
So then just for

Unknown Speaker  46:23
notes at this point.

Speaker 3  46:47
So here's specifically what incorrect fees and credits or invoice

Unknown Speaker  46:52
but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:53
because that's our main concern, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  47:01
That's what

Speaker 2  47:04
that's what happened here. And that's what kind of the start was, but not is not necessarily. Again, it goes back to user errors error where it's probable that some of those items that were deleted from invoices shouldn't have been deleted. So that takes us back to that. Yeah. Yeah. No, if we tell agents, if we prohibit agents from editing, the invoices like yeah, like teasing credits,

Speaker 3  47:36
yeah. So I also think we validate that they can't move, change invoices back to draft mode, or, well, they shouldn't be allowed to delete invoices and probably not go to draft mode.

Unknown Speaker  47:49
And

Speaker 3  47:50
we may need to have a way for them to recreate an invoice. And that that requires some thought.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
Well, but see if they can. Go ahead.

Speaker 2  48:06
Yeah, if they can't edit the numbers, then there's no point in them recruiting invoice.

Speaker 3  48:11
Right. So they cannot edit the fees and credits in any way? RG? I don't think so. Okay, well, fine. That makes us so yeah, don't think they should take a draft vote. I don't think they should be able to edit the invoice in any way. And then then it's up to admins. Now, we might want to think through how admins are supposed to do it to which but that's a much easier issue than agents. Now they do they do will need to be able to change status from invoice to paid.

Unknown Speaker  48:43
I've got processes for that. But yeah,

Speaker 4  48:48
that happens with the Yeah, that's right. The preparer fees in the

Unknown Speaker  48:55
deposit report

Speaker 3  48:58
although see even arguably we could even say they should not be allowed to edit it accepted in imports because that report works in imports. So because if they would go in and manually Mark get paid and they wouldn't have entered the deposit information correctly

Speaker 3  49:23
although Yeah, I think that might right because they have Well, I suppose we'd have to see are there ways for them to edit to remove a payment or something? I think anyway, will require some thought but

Unknown Speaker  49:45
good, well, I think we're getting somewhere with this.

Speaker 2  49:49
All right. And then we also maybe would want to consider what what he said here about Yeah, having an initial process to catch all of those? Sure. Sure.

Speaker 3  50:13
Yeah. I mean, I like the idea of invoicing. I mean, doing a cleanup process of some kind a week ahead of time, or to being one or two weeks ahead of time. That sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  50:23
So,

Speaker 2  50:26
yeah. Okay. Well, then we will plan to follow up on this. It's not a big issue right now. I'll reset the due date here, and we'll plan to follow up on it. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  50:46
Okay, can I take a one minute break and be back?

Speaker 2  50:49
Sure. Well, we only would have if, actually, I have another call coming up here at at the top of the hour. So maybe we should just wrap up rather than diving into into something else.

Speaker 3  51:03
Let me give you a quick summary on the slow invoices. Okay, we were looking at it, we're the solution, we thought was going to be the right one looks like it might be more complex than we thought. So we're going to do a different optimization. That simple. And we're going to double this. We think it's going to make it about three times faster. And then I'm told I'm going to talk to Janelle about C++ changes that will make it much faster yet. So the functionality would stay much like it always has, but we'd be doing it using technology. So just giving you an FYI, that hopefully will be several times faster this week. And by tomorrow, we should be able to prove that one way or another. So okay. Okay, cool. So I created a part three, three B child job or three a or some three, eight. I think I called it so good, so we can tackle Z TK another time. And and I guess you can reach out if you today's Tuesday, you could reach out if you want to talk later in the day. And I might jump into the semblance job and see if I can clean up that the prep my to do's with pricing and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  52:26
Okay, thank you. Sounds good. Yeah, thank you.
