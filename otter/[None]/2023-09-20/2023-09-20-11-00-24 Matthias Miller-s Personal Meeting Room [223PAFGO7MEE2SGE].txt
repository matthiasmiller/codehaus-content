Speaker 1  00:37
Good been in with us I just saw your message there about ZTE K are you meaning like an estimate for phase four or for the phase that we have started already for Phase Three

Matthias Miller  00:53
Have we started development on Phase Three

Speaker 1  00:56
no not that I know we did phase three a gotten stuff that they want sooner rather than later that might be getting close to being an Ellis this court if not get exactly where that is. But then phase the rest of phase three is oh yeah phase three A is ready for review and writing looks like we sent that out or 10 sent that out two weeks ago the rest of day three we're still working with the client doing designing

Unknown Speaker  01:39
we are getting kind of close to the close

Matthias Miller  01:43
we've got design recovery to Lupin so gotcha but that's my main reason for asking Okay good enough

Unknown Speaker  01:54
I'm going to bring drew on

Unknown Speaker  02:36
hello again

Matthias Miller  03:13
Okay well we're which you guys you guys want to pick up where we left off on

Unknown Speaker  03:26
bills or corrections or

Matthias Miller  03:29
did you send over an updated when updated

Matthias Miller  03:44
right let me let me grab this and put up

Unknown Speaker  03:59
okay so

Unknown Speaker  04:29
so I mean we started

Speaker 2  04:31
Go ahead, Greg. Oh, just one is basically you're gonna send me an Excel file with those details. I'll let you know what I find. You have any idea on my time on that report? Will it be today or

Matthias Miller  04:51
you should be able to do that today. Okay,

Speaker 2  04:53
and then just my note in italics. The bottom guys will have this live with next update transaction be the default last that is that correct? What, what we're saying?

Matthias Miller  05:06
Yes, I just got done making the change in my hands. That'll go live. So you're correct.

Unknown Speaker  05:11
All right. Well, that's good. That was really quick.

Speaker 2  05:18
So the MTI our tuition My apologies, I did not ask for anything to be on the call but I think to be which we want to talk about more today at one, I think that would be helpful going to be a part of

Unknown Speaker  05:32
Yep. So I think let's skip over that. Three

Speaker 2  05:42
that really wouldn't have needed to be listed there for one thing that we're wanting to add to that sales orders meeting Invoicing is a sales order subtotal column basically pre tax or less tags

Matthias Miller  06:00
is that the same as I mean, that is just the that's pre tax pre delivery right?

Speaker 2  06:09
No, it would be the entire total less tags

Unknown Speaker  06:14
I got it

Unknown Speaker  06:21
all right. Let me so this is

Matthias Miller  06:51
all right, it's do you have any distinction between a terminology difference you use to determine the subtotal

Unknown Speaker  07:03
between those

Matthias Miller  07:06
like the drink and the subtotals that we've got

Speaker 2  07:11
I do not know if you have to get in

Matthias Miller  07:23
to

Unknown Speaker  07:25
your head hang on let me

Matthias Miller  07:28
make sure I've actually pulled the sales order just to make sure I'm grabbing the right thing here

Unknown Speaker  07:36
shipping subtotal shipping tax okay

Unknown Speaker  07:46
here.

Unknown Speaker  08:21
Once I'm done with that.

Unknown Speaker  08:41
Alright, let's do that.

Matthias Miller  08:44
I'll just clarify in the in the column heading that way. At least want to draw attention to the fact that it's not the same.

Speaker 2  08:55
Well, I would, we talked about leaving both columns, like Pete said, if somebody's going to be but let's leave both columns for now there's a good chance that we might take one away but

Unknown Speaker  09:11
so hero module I think if we want to cover

Unknown Speaker  09:27
well

Speaker 2  09:32
could you ping Dwayne and just see if he's going to if he would have any time available? I asked him when we talk but if he would have any time available in the next. If so then we could solve or to be

Unknown Speaker  10:17
So we should

Speaker 2  10:19
just go ahead with payroll module and if Dwayne comes on we can

Unknown Speaker  10:30
whichever

Unknown Speaker  10:53
so on the payroll module

Unknown Speaker  11:08
28

Unknown Speaker  11:19
share price and over

Unknown Speaker  11:26
on one side

Speaker 3  11:50
yeah yeah basically

Matthias Miller  12:02
Ruby

Matthias Miller  12:11
take a look at the spreadsheet with the PTO rate

Unknown Speaker  12:22
and yeah audio

Unknown Speaker  12:40
recorder

Unknown Speaker  12:56
we

Matthias Miller  12:58
okay well on the paid time off right I see what doing saying it's a matter of me chasing down how these get created and how that gets assigned

Speaker 2  13:10
Okay, so you're gonna chase that be as the bonus description appearing on the employee verification report. So for testing brain says they can enter obviously the mouse type the description the amount is the only thing that appears in the employee verification report. What would it take to make that to make the type the description at least the description appear

Speaker 3  13:37
yeah yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:44
Hey, do you want to handle it if they got multiple bonuses

Speaker 2  13:53
so is the amount is just aggregated and it's just showing the total amount of bonuses I would say can we just in my terms, concatenate whatever the bonuses are like there's two bonuses one performance bonus two bonus and just I don't know if you'd like a pipe, the pipe character or something in between? Or some kind of Yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:22
commas or semicolons or something and just put all the put all the descriptions together but not tied up to specific amounts.

Unknown Speaker  14:30
Yeah. Now

Speaker 2  14:34
I guess this would be good if Dwayne are on but what are the types that we have? What are the options that we have? This came up because I hadn't realized but if you I'm sure you know it's true. If you call something a bonus, it's the tax rate is is different than if you call it a I don't know like a transport bonus or depending on what it is. It's

Unknown Speaker  15:01
anticipated bonus or

Unknown Speaker  15:04
what I mean from a from a?

Speaker 4  15:13
Well, I'm not sure on tax Exactly. Work. But there's a difference between an anticipated bonus and unanticipated bonus. Like workman's comp most some states you have to include them all, but a lot of states, anticipated bonuses would be included in regular workman's comp, whereas unanticipated, you wouldn't have to think time work. He's gone.

Speaker 2  15:40
So the withholdings are different depending on what it is, right? I mean, can you just want some brief?

Unknown Speaker  15:46
Yeah,

Speaker 2  15:46
like, what are the different? When you do payroll, what are the different types? Obviously, regular pay, but then beyond that, what are the different

Unknown Speaker  15:56
categories that you deal with? Or that you're used to?

Unknown Speaker  16:04
Don't know?

Speaker 4  16:07
I mean, you can call them whatever you want different. Different companies will call them different things.

Speaker 2  16:12
But from the state or the federal perspective,

Speaker 4  16:16
yeah, that I'm not exactly sure.

Unknown Speaker  16:21
I usually don't set it up.

Speaker 4  16:24
But I think the difference is just whether it's symptoms. Pretty much those two anticipated would be like something that happens regularly. Or if it's, if there's any sort of arrangement that the person can figure out a way to get that bonus. You know, like it's based on piecework or it's, you know, company with dispersing money, and, you know, profit sharing or something like that. unanticipated is just, hey, we woke up today and says, Give me money bonus. So, general, anticipated bonuses would be included the same as just regular wages, as far as tax investment charges. So it's my understanding,

Speaker 2  17:14
the majority of hours would be anticipated bonuses, where there's some type of pre arrangement where probably, you know, meet this goal, you get this bonus, or you do this much production or whatever. But the unanticipated would be things like Christmas bonus. Right, like more, there's no, yeah, there's not arrangement.

Speaker 4  17:32
It's not based on some sort of arrangements or, and, and different states have different requirements for what is what's considered anticipated and what's not. You know, there's probably some states like California that would say about your anticipated Christmas bonus. Yeah, and then others, you know, all bonuses are different. So you'd have to find out by state really what what differences but, um,

Speaker 2  18:09
so for tight, I mean, could we, I see the types if you have their okay, like the commission would be an anticipated bonus. We know that if you sell X amount, you're right. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:19
Now.

Speaker 4  18:23
I don't know that you want to have it? I mean, how are we using bonuses here, just like everything besides normal hours? Or? Or what does discretionary bonus? mean?

Matthias Miller  18:35
Let me see what all we include in the verification report.

Speaker 2  18:39
I think it's basically a catch all for anything. And that's kind of a we know

Unknown Speaker  18:48
that the intention is for us to

Unknown Speaker  18:52
call it a bonus.

Speaker 5  18:55
And then the fall into like a bonus when it's actually really an anticipated bonus.

Unknown Speaker  19:13
I think there's two things we're trying to figure out. One is, is the Okay, the GL account, like what GL account it eventually posts to has no, I mean, it'll just be same as the

Speaker 2  19:31
as the as the salary or the the hourly wage. The other thing we're so but the thing that we're trying to figure out is how to call this so that the withholdings are right. When you go to when you take this so do you have the correct information to take it into a payroll software?

Unknown Speaker  19:53
Right.

Speaker 4  19:58
I mean, if you keep I would keep them separate from commission. I would keep commission as its own thing. And then have

Unknown Speaker  20:12
have just

Unknown Speaker  20:14
anticipated bonus as a as another

Unknown Speaker  20:19
type, I would guess. What's district transit?

Matthias Miller  20:24
Yeah. What about transport?

Speaker 2  20:27
That is for some of the employees, some of the transportation over there transportation. I think it's maybe entered as a next negative amount.

Unknown Speaker  20:40
Oh, you're providing transportation and taking it out?

Speaker 2  20:43
I think that's what's happening? Well, it almost seems to me like the first, we first need to look at all the different bonuses we have and determine how we want to handle those and then get back to Matthias on what we want with this. And then he's laying that, it seems to me that we should end up with a simple, easy to use list, like whoever's doing payroll, so they can quickly see is this commission is is. And that's probably what we should show on the employees payroll stub as well. I think rather than comment, like, freeform comments is going to vary from time to time. And I think just unless you have something to advertise, I'd say, we need to do homework on our site, and then get back to exactly what we want. Is that, is that fair?

Unknown Speaker  21:36
Yeah. I think so i

Matthias Miller  21:38
If, if you think you want these line items included line by line in the, you know, something along these lines where it shows coming Commission and the amount as an individual line? I don't, that is something that we could take a look at. Doing regardless, and that wouldn't really affect.

Speaker 2  22:06
Okay, I think that would be I mean, if that's easy enough to do, I think we should just plan to do that. It would keep it cleaner. If we have because we're going to have Yeah, then it would be broken out separately. Well, and with what you're saying to the potential exists for somebody to have an anticipated and an unanticipated knowns,

Unknown Speaker  22:31
engineer, and so

Speaker 4  22:35
on, you're gonna want to Yeah, in separate lines, just for going across payroll?

Speaker 2  22:41
Yeah. So, yeah, I would say if we could, I don't see why we wouldn't plan to add these now, what do we add?

Speaker 2  23:04
If we're looking at changing that, we should, instead of seeing bonus for everything, because that kind of gives the wrong impression. Pending what it is, we should get rid of the word bonus on the employee verification report, and instead, just list whatever type we select, if it's commission, it says commission and $1 amount if it's transport, well, and we'll just have to name the types, we'll name the type so that they are we want to appear for the employee as well. But then it seems like we may need as we may need. Another field that where we, we have a list of we have a table of here all the bonus types. And then the next column on that table is whether it's an anticipated or an unanticipated bonus, which then is reflected on on the accountants payroll report. So there, I don't think there's nothing keeping us from building out that that part isn't

Matthias Miller  24:12
okay. No, and I think I would idealize if you know, for each of these types commission is always anticipated we might have we will have then a discretionary bonus which would be always be an unanticipated and we just come up with types that are always what I would idealize come up with types that are always one way or the other, anticipated or not anticipated. And then these would become not discretionary bonuses, but payroll adjustments perhaps.

Speaker 4  24:46
That's, yeah, that's what a lot of your payroll would use would be like adjustments to payroll or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  24:59
I mean, And

Speaker 4  25:02
are your payroll items are just like basically that one up above there is hourly? Like, so if somebody has a salary, where's that show up?

Speaker 2  25:16
Although those are some of the changes that Matthias is planning to make, but okay, it's showing up. It's currently, well, here, here's an example, if you look at flight model, it's just showing, then that, but the virus has it on his list to change that. So it's conditional life. It's so that it

Matthias Miller  25:39
like for Floyd, as far as on here, we simply wouldn't have any hours anytime recorded, but the timecard is flagged as a salaried employee. And then competence compensation is pulled, we can get the compensation discussion, you guys any question about that? Yeah, we just compensation information.

Speaker 4  26:03
Okay. Because, like commission would normally just be a payroll item, that would not be I mean, even bonuses will not necessarily be adjustments adjustments would be something like, if you if you did a, an advance payment, you know, gave somebody a draw on his check. And then and then you're repaying that advance payment, or like that, that transport thing would be an adjustment, that kind of stuff. So So

Matthias Miller  26:35
basically, it's whether you're adjusting the gross or the net to mean, is it? Right? Right, that would be

Speaker 4  26:42
be considered adjustments. But I mean, you could probably call that adjustments, well. Just other items.

Matthias Miller  26:57
So you would have one for additional payroll items.

Unknown Speaker  27:02
And because for differences.

Speaker 4  27:07
Like if you did a draw, that needs to come off of your net Check, after like, like physical investment of a draw comes off your net Check after the taxes are figured, whereas this goes on before the taxes, you know, I don't know, like that transport probably should technically be taken off after the taxes are paid or taken out of the nap. I mean, depends. I suppose it's been you could probably make arrangements. However, it would obviously be nice for the, for the people if, if you take it took it out of the gross check, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Speaker 2  27:47
I mean, that's what's being done right now. Yeah, and taken out of the road. Well, is that another one of those things that we need to do some homework on and like you have people in your company that could probably

Unknown Speaker  28:07
Yeah.

Speaker 4  28:11
Some of that. I don't know if some of that would almost be easier to just set up in the payroll side of things. Because you're gonna have to set up all those employees in the payroll side, and you can set up automatic deductions and additions and all kinds of stuff like that. And so if every check, gets 50 bucks taken out for transport, you can just put that in and we just thought that was take that out. Then it would come back into this system on the on the wages side of things, but I don't know, it's not a thing.

Speaker 2  28:54
It's not consistent. I don't think that we have any adjustments that are consistent week to week like they're always inputting that information. The company that does this, you know, if they're working three days a week or four days a week, and then that that amount varies so well,

Matthias Miller  29:14
if we don't feed it in right away, we're gonna have trouble with pushing it actually actually pushing it across to accounting then and knowing where to where to put it. We reconcile that gross versus net. We're,

Speaker 4  29:27
we're moving this to payroll software just threw down download right and then and then uploading it in. Yeah. Yeah. So that process is going to require us shifting numbers in the right places so that it works for the upload. So in a way, if we have two different things grouped together here that should be separated out We might have to, like, we're gonna have him in the same field here. And then as we make reports to download, move them to appropriate places there could be something like that, too.

Unknown Speaker  30:19
We'll do we need net adjustments. Like drawers?

Speaker 2  30:27
Well, we don't do any. I mean, we haven't done an we don't do any drawers like advance pays. The only thing we have is the that transport bonus thing, which is that long term, I want to make sure that that's what she had, that we're handling that correctly. You're saying that you're not sure on that drew how that technically shouldn't be handled to the state of Indiana? Or is there

Speaker 4  30:57
I should ask Nelson who probably know. Like anything, we have guys that will. You know, maybe the maybe one of the employees use the truck for a while, and it's 25 bucks today. And then they just take you out of the pack. And that would always be in that.

Unknown Speaker  31:21
Which is a net adjustment to the net amount.

Unknown Speaker  31:25
After taxes are out, here's what's weird.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
But like this is

Unknown Speaker  31:44
I mean, if you're,

Speaker 4  31:47
if it's part of the pay agreement, then it probably could go before the net. And if it was just something of, hey, you wrote in our van, we're in charge 25 bucks, then it should be after the net. So I'm guessing it has much to do with what's your arrangement with these employees as it does as it does anything else? Well,

Speaker 2  32:16
it seems like making adjustments to the net, that's going to be quite involved, like what if we just what if we make sure that we have what we need short term, at least from now to the end of the year? Because once we tie into? Well, at some point, we're going to tie GL accounts to this to each employee as well. And then have a way to hopefully download and export that to their payroll software and then suddenly at bringing it back in, like you detailed. I don't know are we with us? Is that on your radar for this year or not? And the I think at that point, you could look at this adjustments to net

Matthias Miller  33:07
is it on my radar? I can't remember exactly when we put it I know it's I think it is I'm pretty sure it's on my radar for this year. As of now

Speaker 4  33:20
Yeah, I would say put all the things in that discretionary bonuses section we would call it adjustments or whatever when you call it

Matthias Miller  33:28
we can call it payroll items and additional payroll items

Speaker 4  33:35
you know it gives us a place to put the information we can use it and then if we need to adjust from there

Speaker 2  33:48
so what we're doing is we're changing just to clarify discretionary bonus field to payroll adjustments and then we're going to have type and a table of type and the related anticipated or unanticipated problems right those are and then you're going to display

Speaker 5  34:16
the types on the employers verification department Correct.

Unknown Speaker  34:24
Not all states are repaying people

Speaker 5  34:28
in Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia

Unknown Speaker  34:44
to see

Unknown Speaker  34:47
if their summer

Unknown Speaker  34:52
Yeah, so Messiah you have what you need from us.

Unknown Speaker  34:57
Yeah, when? One little note

Matthias Miller  35:00
drew it sounds like you had a preference for payroll items over payroll adjustments or do you not care

Speaker 4  35:08
Alright, I think it would probably be more correct since bonuses and commissions and all that would be in here I would I would kind of say items is probably better but it's just a quibble over term

Speaker 2  35:23
let's use your I mean you're the payroll experts expert

Matthias Miller  35:34
yep that gives me what I need on on that front then okay

Unknown Speaker  35:48
good

Speaker 2  35:50
yeah finalized payroll basically what happens when we finalize payroll like what all is frozen and this would probably be best if maybe we can talk about it or it may be just as good to put a document together explain that and send it send it out. So we can reference

Matthias Miller  36:15
yeah the basic story is that

Matthias Miller  36:24
is that finalize the only thing finalize really does is freeze

Unknown Speaker  36:36
see

Matthias Miller  36:47
this is on the go into company and accounting companies builders always confuses me because under the hood builders are still called companies but

Unknown Speaker  37:09
the Navy

Unknown Speaker  37:32
whether

Matthias Miller  37:33
rightly or wrongly ideally or not I think with great power comes great responsibility with absolute power corrupts absolute responsibility the compensation on an on an employee is intended to be intended to be driven off of an effective date and if you want to change it then you should add a It's not save this but add a new column with a new effective date and fill it in as of that effective date so you should never be going back into time and modifying somebody's compensation

Unknown Speaker  38:21
yeah if you perform poorly you know

Matthias Miller  38:32
and I think let me let me just double check okay, but then let's since we can let's go ahead and dig into

Unknown Speaker  38:45
please production out

Matthias Miller  38:48
now there is more

Unknown Speaker  38:51
it will freeze

Unknown Speaker  39:02
so then we have here

Matthias Miller  39:06
on the company

Unknown Speaker  39:11
we've got

Matthias Miller  39:16
it's not actually all but Well, actually it might be all because at that point we

Unknown Speaker  39:28
company and surgery pending. Yes.

Matthias Miller  39:34
It's non pending. And then we also the other thing we do

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Yeah, since

Speaker 2  40:03
this production tool mark alternative and payouts is none pending mark the payroll is being verified okay what does explain Mark opening payout as non pending?

Matthias Miller  40:18
We have okay so we have the automatic 299 payout

Unknown Speaker  40:23
feature and I don't know

Unknown Speaker  40:25
we're not using so maybe it's it well go ahead and give us the brief version of it though.

Matthias Miller  40:33
I think I think we let you modify it as long as it's pending and then when you mark it not pending we lock it down so you can go changing it again

Unknown Speaker  40:43
which would mean you couldn't change the total that you were going to pay the 10 or nine person

Unknown Speaker  40:52
right or wrong okay

Speaker 2  41:01
the third point marked the payroll as being verified

Unknown Speaker  41:07
what does that do

Unknown Speaker  41:09
yeah

Matthias Miller  41:14
I think it might lock some additional fields

Speaker 2  41:18
because we tested I know Duane tested making some changes

Matthias Miller  41:29
see what what all that controls

Unknown Speaker  41:42
also

Unknown Speaker  42:06
wow

Unknown Speaker  42:21
good

Unknown Speaker  42:28
well

Matthias Miller  42:39
it's strictly informational at this point I'm not sure if that's by design but

Unknown Speaker  42:50
yeah,

Matthias Miller  42:52
I would have thought that we would somewhere

Unknown Speaker  42:56
walk down

Matthias Miller  43:00
timecards are something

Speaker 2  43:04
you're seeing we're not locking down any of that currently

Matthias Miller  43:10
does not appear to me like we are

Matthias Miller  43:17
let me see if there's any other lock downs on time cards

Unknown Speaker  43:35
so what does it take to lock that? I mean

Matthias Miller  43:48
Well, what else should it be? It should be locking down control that

Matthias Miller  44:00
the main thing would just be locking down time cards, right?

Speaker 2  44:03
Yeah. You're saying fingers anybody that has access to the rates should get I mean, what that responsibility you should know enough not to modify. Well, yeah, that would get tricky to try and lock that down. I would think time cards as when you say time cards that's what you do bonus amounts and like just on a timecard what fields would you Oh, lock down the whole thing. Okay, everything on that the bonus amounts the the hours the hourly rate. But yeah, that would be perfect. Good. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  44:50
So it'd be easy enough. Okay. Can do.

Unknown Speaker  44:54
Production tone, right. Did that already.

Matthias Miller  44:59
Does right that would that would be here. And if somebody goes changing that for a historical pay period, that's once again.

Unknown Speaker  45:09
That's why you have to

Matthias Miller  45:14
Sweeney licensed by again?

Speaker 2  45:19
Well, here locally your mount? Oh, that's why at the flea market, there's a lot of people selling guns I don't think that's

Unknown Speaker  45:30
well that's not the norm. I don't think

Matthias Miller  45:43
that's in this report. All right, I am going to let me let me reorient some of these pages. So make it a lot easier to read. Me

Speaker 2  45:58
Dwayne just suggested on the blog. Yeah, you can take a look at my sheet. Today, I think it's the next, the next one. This is he's against it, we move what the account uses to its own set or whatever, so that nursing payroll can come in here. And maybe that's it gets speaking through if you want something else. It's I mean.

Speaker 4  46:27
I don't know. I mean, so far for me, and the way it's working is not to use a bunch of put over the favorites. kind of forget where it was. But yeah, that might be

Unknown Speaker  46:45
ideal.

Speaker 4  46:46
I mean, there is no payroll like, yeah, there's the second, the payroll tab.

Unknown Speaker  47:00
I mean, that's fine. I will refuse that.

Speaker 4  47:04
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, there might come up, as you know, maybe there's a few more items that can go in a separate section, as well.

Unknown Speaker  47:13
Oh, it is? Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

Speaker 4  47:21
makes much difference for me. That was when you move that to the Accounting tab rather than the payroll tab. Well, Dwayne

Speaker 2  47:28
suggestion was, let's no just move make a separate header like, Oh, calm or whatever? Yeah. Well, if Do we just leave it there?

Matthias Miller  47:47
Is Dwayne gonna be overseeing anybody?

Unknown Speaker  47:51
What was that?

Matthias Miller  47:53
I said he's doing it'd be responsible for providing support or overseeing somebody who's running payroll?

Speaker 2  47:58
No, wow. Okay, support in his office for entering timecards just making sure they're correct. But as far as getting it paid, No, he won't be. I'd say why don't we just leave it here for now? And we can always move later. And then I think so I included a copy of the report that we're sending, but I don't think we're like, am I correct? Matthias, once we've done our homework, you can mock up. You can put together a report pretty quickly once once we know exactly. I'm sure this isn't right. Now that we've had this, you know, bonuses, the anticipated bonuses and all that. I think what we should do is drill we should work together and figure out

Speaker 5  48:42
what works best for the payroll software, we're going to be going to

Speaker 4  48:47
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I think. I think we're gonna have to figure out what fields do we need for that, and then work backwards. From there.

Speaker 2  48:57
Because I think Matthias has, I know there's lots and lots of fields on this payroll module. So

Unknown Speaker  49:06
good. So we have some homework there.

Speaker 2  49:13
And so five B and five d we have to do there Yeah, yeah. B. Besides, you have everything you need D is on hold or you can't do anything until we have information there. And then you're basically going to create a report where you can go in and just get the information he needs. To get a soft download that are exported to his records. How are you handling? I don't know is it worth talking about that but how are you handling we have different I pay periods weekly, I think we have weekly, bi weekly and monthly. How are you planning to handle that? With us? And are you? Are you anticipating a report that we set the the frequency of the pay period? On the company record? And then okay, we're backing up. We're verifying timecards on a weekly basis. Yeah. But for a company that's paid bi weekly, are you anticipating that it would just compile or aggregate in there? In the accountants report it?

Matthias Miller  50:54
Is let's see how we do this. Because we this this thing, I'm sure handles it.

Unknown Speaker  51:02
Or have you built out what has been built out so far?

Matthias Miller  51:06
So my understand, so here's any well, do we have any companies in the system that are multi week?

Matthias Miller  51:19
Well, actually, yeah, we might. Let's do let me just run back a few. It would be?

Unknown Speaker  51:27
Well, let's see the last

Matthias Miller  51:30
would September to be the end of the monthly? Or is that it'd be the week before that? It looks like it's this this one?

Unknown Speaker  51:45
There you have a floor? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  51:47
So you put in your run the payments due based on the pay period end date, which would defaults to the Saturday, Saturday before today? Last Saturday. And then if it's the end of you know, in this case, it was the end of a four week or have a monthly pay period this month had for weeks. And and so therefore, these would be these are included in the payment do report.

Speaker 2  52:16
And they would they would they not be included? If, say we were looking at? You know, looking at this for in three weeks.

Matthias Miller  52:26
Yeah, like if we would go back to 826.

Matthias Miller  52:34
Vinyl structures, watch me eat my words, but vinyl structures is going to be absent.

Unknown Speaker  52:45
Good. That's great.

Speaker 2  52:48
So then, you know how we break. It's basically the report is how do we break those numbers down? Right? Right. Right.

Speaker 4  52:56
So every week it's only only those that have payroll, the process will show up? That's great.

Unknown Speaker  53:01
Correct? Good well

Speaker 2  53:10
that leaves us with to the general date Dwayne responded all or not.

Matthias Miller  53:15
He's been completely silent. So he saw a message they didn't respond

Unknown Speaker  53:28
well,

Speaker 2  53:28
so Dwayne is I sent this morning I sent him five examples of actual handwritten sales orders for him to enter Josh took that portion live so that we can start doing this

Speaker 2  53:50
I don't know I think to be might be better. We should plan a time when when Dwayne is on and after he's done these tests.

Unknown Speaker  53:58
Sales Orders,

Speaker 2  54:00
I think we would be would be a better use of our time than trying to go through them now. I mean, there's nothing there. Is this holding up portions of development if we don't?

Matthias Miller  54:20
No, it means it makes it a little harder to wrap up.

Matthias Miller  54:37
I have a simple solution. I don't know if you guys like it. But a simple solution is having an advanced view that shows what the accounting impact is of the invoice as it stands. And then just let people enter debits and credits to fix it up to get to where you want to be. And we can even then show the net of what is the net accounting impact But when it's all said and done, and we just, we either do that or we just straight up say, Forget everything that I said about what happened on the invoice date, I'm gonna go manually change the impact to accounting and you can do whatever you jolly well please

Unknown Speaker  55:33
so it would only

Matthias Miller  55:35
basically you could override revenue and expenses. Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 2  55:40
Yeah, the okay the issue, the unknown on these are the income account and the discount account, right?

Unknown Speaker  55:58
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  56:02
But are these is the whole thing? Well, don't you have separate shipping or delivery? Or is that a single?

Speaker 2  56:10
No, we have those separate times as well.

Speaker 2  56:20
Well, here's, okay, maybe this is too simplistic. But to get started, could we say, could we say if there is no skin or no building included, then leave the shipping account blank. Leave the default income account blank and leave the discount account blank which will

Unknown Speaker  56:44
force

Speaker 2  56:47
Dwayne's office to select a default income account and a discount account if it applies any shipping income account if it applies. And then we just have to figure out how we communicate that information

Unknown Speaker  57:05
to people entering these?

Unknown Speaker  57:19
Yes, as long as we I'm

Matthias Miller  57:24
pretty happy with that as long as?

Matthias Miller  57:46
Yeah, as long as it covers enough scenarios, and you don't have situations where you're putting three things in the same sales order. Three different types of things.

Unknown Speaker  57:57
Oh, what's the

Matthias Miller  58:03
I would almost lean towards having a way to create an accounting. Here's another way we could do this. Let you create a direct, we'd have a we'd have a special type of accounting transaction that would link to the sales order. And we would basically have a way to say

Unknown Speaker  58:25
I don't

Matthias Miller  58:28
I want to manually specify how this impacts accounting. I basically don't want this thing to impact accounting. I'll go take care of it myself. And I'll go create the transaction that that's dangerous. I don't know. Let's let's You're right. I'm looking for little shortcuts. And I don't think there is I think the shortcut is good. Let's go find out what we actually need. What we need to adapt and how much customizing we need and how you're going to communicate that back. And once we've got that then I think it's going to be pretty simple what we need to do pretty good.

Speaker 2  59:07
I'd say tomorrow Wow. Got it because I think the people doing the the entry here are going to be data entry people and not necessarily accountants. So I want to make sure that it works them so. Okay, so we've got homework on that as well. And we'll get back to you. I haven't say Okay, so we've cancelled Friday. Well, I think we left Friday open for Oh, hey. Through an advisor if needed. I'm going to be all but then I'd say to be we should have something by our Monday. Monday collarbones.

Matthias Miller  59:56
Okay. Sounds good. Then I'm Gonna be heads down on a county tomorrow running running with my arms outstretched to beat the September 30 do whatever I can number 30 and try to kneel down as much as I'm going to be focused first and foremost and payroll module and get as much of those changes wrapped up and then anything beyond that I'm going to be working on all the Yeah, all the remaining stuff so I think we're going to start seeing a one update I didn't give you a well I think I think we should fairly quickly start seeing some of these things wind down for the for the end of the month, and we can start taking a look at stuff that needs to happen to the end of the year but better sections on income statement, we don't have development capacity to hit by the end of the month we're gonna bump this out to the end of the year I think it's just the reporting piece. I don't see it as yes it's kind of a nuisance but I don't see that as as an issue, this is these these three are technical debt and then we can start taking a look at Canadian requirements we went to sales tax processes, payroll and withholding tax

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
which we touched on

Unknown Speaker  1:01:16
good there is

Speaker 4  1:01:17
another nuisance when it comes to the reports it wants to default the date for the report to something in like 2034 So every single time you pull an income statement you have to reset the date so some blooper Is there something to it yeah in theory and use the words but last week or so quit were important

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
a range fiscal year calculate start date

Matthias Miller  1:02:05
Oh gracious year to date

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
and date

Matthias Miller  1:02:12
it's gonna see what the end date is trying to be

Unknown Speaker  1:02:17
calculate and date

Unknown Speaker  1:02:22
start of

Matthias Miller  1:02:30
let me as a default ask me let me let me see if I got isolated here. Okay. I will Oh you've got an accounting transaction out in the future

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
so that's why

Matthias Miller  1:03:04
see if see what it is. No, it's not filtering out by date and system it is not filtering out by company. What company is it under?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:23
This one

Matthias Miller  1:03:29
we have a vendor invoice for 2030 for

Unknown Speaker  1:03:34
the reporting.

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
That's like hey there there are different lines of business to get into.

Matthias Miller  1:03:50
I'm gonna guess that was supposed to be 2023 just guessing. Should I be what's the best way to specify to clean it up to change it should not be Dwayne's office,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:10
rather send it to Dwayne and have him Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16
That's one of my cats

Unknown Speaker  1:04:22
at the embassy and yeah.

Speaker 2  1:04:30
That's one thing just I don't know, is it worthwhile? I think it's worth mentioning. Josh mentioned this morning that he would have he wasn't asking for work, but he said he, like if there's, I forget what it was something that he would have, you know, may have some capacity if you need something from him or if there's anything man so screen I think it was on the sales order sales order sales orders ready for invoicing I sent I sent that list to him and you yesterday and I mistakenly thought that he was creating that report. And I think that's when he mentioned is that if you need some help there he could possibly. Alright. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:05:27
Is that going to be going out by? I mean does that need a special does that need to be set up as a transmission to go up by fax?

Speaker 2  1:05:38
Yeah just like the same as what the vendor, the accounts payable verification report is being sent out.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
So over the

Speaker 2  1:05:51
top, those are sent out as to the assist users. However their sent method is used as a scheduled task. They're sent every Monday morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:05
Believe

Matthias Miller  1:06:07
daily, daily, daily weekly payouts. There's timecard logistics update. The IQ BI reports and production reports pricing double check. Okay, I think I think that's probably set up as a trance mission. Yeah. I mean, that would be ideal for him to set that up. I haven't worked with transmissions before, once we, once you're happy with it. And Dwayne's office is on board. I'm going to assume that Dwayne is not going to be eager to implement any new processes before. end of next week.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:48
Yeah. Good. Well,

Speaker 2  1:06:52
this is yeah, a lot of good stuff happening. So thanks for is I would suggest three o'clock call we just play by ear. I mean, unless something crops up, I don't know that we're gonna have any thing we're talking about.

Matthias Miller  1:07:08
Okay, sounds good. You want to just ping me, uh, yesterday, a few minutes before? Well, or I can hop on and see either way.

Speaker 2  1:07:18
Oh, 245. I'll let you know your name. Okay. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
Should I just email you or something or?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
Yeah, that's fine. Okay.

Speaker 4  1:07:33
There might I might be able to go over some of this payroll stuff, a little bit more than certain out to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
as far as what that upload would need to be in all that.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:49
Sounds good.
