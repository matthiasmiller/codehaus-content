Speaker 1  00:49
Hey, good morning. How's it going? Good? Whoa, You've piqued my curiosity again with those wall panels behind you. Those are those that Miles structures is important. Are they?

Unknown Speaker  01:10
There? What do you say? You know,

Unknown Speaker  01:19
there shouldn't be?

Speaker 2  01:21
Well, here's, here's your next gig to negotiate. But go get in touch with Starbucks corporate, and see if you can't get him to did to get some of that panels installed.

Speaker 1  01:41
You mean try. We try to negotiate them to buy them from us or what?

Speaker 2  01:46
Yeah. I mean, surely there's some kind of pitch to be made to us, like your designer metal or something? You know, I don't know. Like the designer metal, which is what Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, wouldn't it be really cool? Yeah.

Speaker 1  02:17
Well, did you get my agenda? I put some of the things together that we want to cover. But go ahead with, you want to go ahead with what you have. That's fine.

Speaker 2  02:27
Yeah, I think the main thing is giving you guys a bit of an update. The sales order accounting impact shouldn't be working. With the exception of the raw material cost. I will not push that live. But there's nobody using it right now. And with the exception of deposits and Stripe payouts is 30 working on that and discovered that we have payouts that aren't tied to any sales order? And I have no idea what's going on there. But that's going to be a little tricky to reconcile with accounting, if you're not consistently getting getting tied out to the sales orders. Do you know offhand, Mark? Are there any stripe transactions that are being run outside of the site of the dealer portal? Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:29
any stripe? I think finally and may have run a few of these occasionally. But that would only be for you know when we have I don't know how we're wanting to page. With those are the only ones. I don't know, man. I think that's the I think those are pretty rare. We could answer that.

Speaker 2  04:07
Okay, so it sounds like it shouldn't be happening. Figure out why. Asset Management, I believe should be yeah, there's one really weird edge case that needs to be chased down but it doesn't affect you guys. And that's your coordinate again. I am planning to focus on payroll module tomorrow probably. And yeah, else by way of updates. Yeah. Yeah, that'll be anything else.

Speaker 1  04:53
So on the sales order counting impact when you reference raw materials you're referencing is it all raw materials on buildings are only raw materials on that field we add it for miscellaneous items where you can input a manual the sailor consumes $5,000 worth of raw materials

Speaker 2  05:18
that's from the customer side the the rest of the raw materials is actually handled on the building off of the buildings

Unknown Speaker  05:28
yeah

Speaker 1  05:35
and then hero module you're playing to work on that tomorrow. I sent you and Ben a few different things on that there's one other thing that I think it might be worth covering that in our one o'clock call the day you're still planning to do the one to 30.

Speaker 1  06:15
Our payroll module we are tentatively hoping or tentatively planning to go live with that meeting, start to use that or shed time. Can October 2, and then final structures hopefully soon thereafter, they those are the two most basic ones and then the other four were waiting on some of the payroll module updates where we tried to do that so that's yeah, just an update on our site. Okay.

Speaker 2  06:56
Good. Jumping in you'll get with Dwayne on that specific report that you were wanting is that right? Or did you want me to

Speaker 1  07:11
Well, I asked Wayne for and he said he can't remember he was wondering if that was possibly put together. So

Unknown Speaker  07:22
I guess

Speaker 1  07:23
disregard my note on the on the report that was I sent Wayne's half an hour ago and he said I can't I don't know where it is

Unknown Speaker  07:33
I would expect our calculations magic but I just want to yeah

Speaker 1  07:40
yeah. We have other than doing that we really have no way we can't look at one building and say yeah, that looks about right

Speaker 1  08:01
you are Dwayne would have sent me this report for an earlier time period for well okay the time period is I think you just send every the time period is not that critical I can just pick out the ones that were built in that timeframe

Unknown Speaker  08:19
open ads on great let me just

Unknown Speaker  08:45
Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  08:53
love seeing yours

Unknown Speaker  09:25
to know what's on sale

Speaker 2  09:37
more on the sole employee one rushing

Unknown Speaker  09:49
Oh, hi. I'm overheated. Do you want this A

Speaker 2  10:11
Do you want this as a Excel file or as a PDF,

Speaker 1  10:15
an Excel file and just send it to the files, Raspberry Pi's?

Unknown Speaker  10:24
Last night we will

Unknown Speaker  10:42
no, this is not that this isn't how to break down

Unknown Speaker  10:53
ideas yet? Well, let me I'm gonna have to I don't see any point in taking our time now with this, let me make a list of things that I need to chase should be

Unknown Speaker  11:22
a tick box

Speaker 1  11:28
Yeah, all of the columns that are listed there. And you're going to create that as we're probably going to do around this just to make sure that it's all working correctly. So but once you have it set up first time, then good. Just yeah, let me know. Well, obviously, once you send it, let me know, and then I'll drop it into my template, see what I come up with. And then I'll let you know, results of what we find. So here's what I think the biggest. Okay, first of all, those transactions that help or reports that you created are extremely helpful and very helpful. The only thing that we're finding is the various transactions are not posting to the last day allocating to but instead posting to the day that the allocations made. So is that a process issue that we're doing something wrong? Or is it a software? setup? So Drew did?

Speaker 1  12:45
Like, it's pretty obvious if you're looking at the health care reform, what's happening, we were the financial reports month, a month and scratching our head, but then when we looked at the individual building transactions, then we can see

Unknown Speaker  13:04
what's happening. Thinking

Speaker 3  13:13
it's going by the date that I applied the the allocation,

Speaker 2  13:18
did we just change the actual cost date in the on the building record to be? actual cost period ending?

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Yeah, that's what I was thinking it was.

Unknown Speaker  13:36
Okay. Yeah, I can do that. Okay, so I will.

Speaker 3  13:42
Because, you know, like I applied the changes are applied the costs on September 14, for July. And I also applied for I made a separate cost set for May and June, for a period there and buy those on the 14th of September, and it just it both groups all up to 14 to September. So like the first one should be applied at the end of June, and the second group should be applied at the end of July.

Speaker 1  14:14
But I think what we, what we said was, let's have the default be the last day of the period, but have the option to change it because there could be situations where you have a huge variance and you're going to oh, I don't know, I think we would want the option to potentially. Well, you could go later than the end date, but you, you, you couldn't go earlier, could you? Well, okay, how much does how much complexity does that add? Because you say it adds a lot of complexity. I would I think we would we need to ask ourselves the question does it really need to be optional other than doing it the last day that period I mean can you think of any? Well I guess first question Does that add a lot of complexity to make so that that date can be changed

Unknown Speaker  15:18
let me take a word we're

Unknown Speaker  15:54
wait so we are as

Speaker 1  16:00
we had talked about changing it to do that

Unknown Speaker  16:04
but how recently did you apply these changes

Speaker 1  16:09
914 which we were expecting those we were expecting that change then because we thought it had been updated so, did we do something it's been a little bit let me see well

Unknown Speaker  16:37
be

Unknown Speaker  16:39
more than

Unknown Speaker  16:57
was

Unknown Speaker  17:05
a you know options that you are aware of to enter

Speaker 3  17:08
No Yeah, I didn't have any I didn't have any entry date like in the date that I entered for the appliance that's

Speaker 1  17:17
because we we talked about this earlier and thought that we that change has been made or that's what we were expecting and needed the allegation

Unknown Speaker  17:27
Yeah, no there's no Oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:36
Let me see.

Speaker 3  17:40
Like there's just not any no place to put it Yeah. And I probably shouldn't have to manage this in mind

Speaker 2  17:51
if you give me a second sheet where that was your nine six yeah

Unknown Speaker  18:21
here's your user folder so there's that

Unknown Speaker  18:24
916 with a

Unknown Speaker  18:28
14 914

Unknown Speaker  18:32
that I can never find anything against

Unknown Speaker  18:44
Yeah, you would have had that change

Speaker 2  18:51
we go see studios will be screening once it loads yes it is

Unknown Speaker  19:09
yeah, I think it's just how it groups

Unknown Speaker  19:15
yes

Unknown Speaker  19:21
is it slow like only work on it?

Unknown Speaker  19:28
I mean, depending what you're doing,

Unknown Speaker  19:29
I mean, this is huge, huge, huge report.

Unknown Speaker  19:52
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  20:10
This is just the regular sales order. They're

Unknown Speaker  20:13
easier for me because it's ranked and they're coming over

Unknown Speaker  20:19
the wrong reasons to do some

Speaker 1  20:20
things differently. Be curious if you go to one a different one

Speaker 1  20:31
It starts in and not ends here. Oh, ah, those are

Unknown Speaker  20:38
the ones that

Unknown Speaker  20:45
be

Unknown Speaker  20:55
means be loyal to the way I would expect.

Speaker 2  21:26
Date. Yeah, okay, the nerves looks like it wouldn't be it's flying. It's the grind to play as it was

Unknown Speaker  21:53
That's great. It's pulling it out of liabilities correctly.

Speaker 3  21:59
Putting that into revenue upon invoicing you

Speaker 2  22:13
drew, you would have gone through this preview cost adjustments link.

Speaker 3  22:26
Yes, yeah. And then hit the Apply Changes.

Unknown Speaker  22:35
Any problem if I really run it?

Speaker 2  22:43
Over right now oh, you know what, I know what it is. I know what it is.

Speaker 2  22:57
That's it. Okay. I will I will catch. That's all I can say. Let me make a note. And I can I can push that live. And you guys, if you guys want to keep testing that today.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
Push it live went like today?

Unknown Speaker  23:26
I said, Yeah, that would be helpful for you guys. Well,

Speaker 1  23:29
I don't know that. I mean, the only everything else? The calculations and everything else should work just same instead of posting it on the 14th and posting it on July 31. Right. Correct. Or whatever. And so how did you set it up to will it? Okay, back to the question of is it editable? Can you edit? What date you posted? Or is it

Unknown Speaker  24:03
you're supposed to be able to? You will be able to

Speaker 1  24:07
in theory, okay, is it defaulting to the last day of the period? Yeah. Okay. So by default, it'll default to the last day of the period. But then if you say, I want to make this month look really good, because so as long as tied to this month, I'll push it to the next month or whatever. That's a silly example. But you could move it to the next month or the first one.

Unknown Speaker  24:32
Like an example of a perfect

Unknown Speaker  24:34
you know, Mark likes to do here.

Speaker 1  24:38
Well, it, I see that it could have the potential to really wow, not really good. So that would go live with the next update that Josh takes. He was mentioning something to Dwayne about. What did he say? He said is going to be a little hairy or something like that there's a lot of a massive update. So and Dwayne is groaning a little bit because he's going to be prepping for his talk at the Shed show and then be at the tshechu and next week's

Unknown Speaker  25:17
billboard Very good.

Speaker 1  25:22
Okay, so we got four minutes. I think, Dwayne, we have a meeting scheduled with Dwayne live and 30 to test an ACH transaction but I know it sounds like he was running a little tight on time. So let's let's keep going until he won't be on this.

Unknown Speaker  25:40
Google me we could find out when he comes in.

Speaker 1  25:42
Let's do that and keep going. So the next thing was the FBI allocation the accessories search term and the discount account for what do you think

Unknown Speaker  26:07
yeah

Unknown Speaker  26:13
I think the big issue here is

Speaker 2  26:21
if you've got multiple payout accounts, and I'm not having multiple discount accounts and I'm not sure how to how to how are you going to indicate which which discount line item goes with which

Unknown Speaker  26:36
well so okay,

Unknown Speaker  26:40
if you look at if you look at

Speaker 1  26:44
the one that I marked up where I have at the bottom, right, buildings, building materials, deliveries and site work, those are those are the four the only four revenue accounts that we have.

Speaker 1  27:15
So, okay, that I guess the first, the first question I have is default, the default income account, we're just I think we're okay to just set that to buildings because that's what 90% of them are going to be and then the others are going to go through Dwayne's most likely to go through drains off anyway.

Speaker 2  27:37
And so can we just leave it as buildings as the default and or? Or do you want a separate income account? If it's not a building?

Speaker 1  27:51
Well, that's how we have it set up we have three or four income accounts we have buildings, building materials, deliveries inside or so deliveries you're already taking care of what that shipping income account. Alright, I think we're okay starting out at least to just leave buildings as the the default and doing the same thing on the discounts are colleges using the building's what you have selected here

Speaker 2  28:29
but then we're going to need a way to override that on a one off basis.

Speaker 1  28:35
Yeah. And how most of these that are different from this would be those manually created sales orders that we send to Dwayne's office and then they so.

Speaker 1  29:05
One is, is the communication and the information flow, but then what we need to what you're thinking about is from the software perspective,

Unknown Speaker  29:16
yeah, I don't think it reflected in accounting.

Speaker 2  29:30
Well, I think that's a bigger discussion. And what we should do on a on a checking call, I think that's something that we should discuss. One you do.

Unknown Speaker  29:49
See, same with the accessory search term,

Speaker 2  29:53
the accessory search term. What's that was that was triggered by a question I had was that

Speaker 1  30:03
no, we had the question as well. I told through I think what that is is the search term is we enter the commonly used descriptions like build on site and then the account tied to it. And you'd poke and be looked at a little bit weren't sure how to use that so I guess if that's something that you could show us in a minute or two I think it could make sense

Speaker 3  30:29
pretty much as we just enter things they may type in

Speaker 2  30:35
the name of the date and in fact there's a report that'll help us that will help you

Unknown Speaker  30:46
find it

Unknown Speaker  30:53
this will

Speaker 2  31:07
here's a list of the common discounts and the frequency of use across a timeframe I think it's I don't think it's all time but

Unknown Speaker  31:34
let's let's do

Speaker 2  31:45
I guess we'd want to and so is quote they don't really have to

Unknown Speaker  31:59
don't have to worry about canceled either

Unknown Speaker  32:13
this is everything in the last year it was not a quote and not not canceled

Speaker 1  32:23
you but you would take these like the ones that you deem are important enough. frequent enough and enter those and then the related revenue account that you want to use. Yep. Does that make sense? Are you Yeah, the revenue revenue accounts show up there.

Unknown Speaker  32:51
Yeah, yeah. Good.

Speaker 1  32:57
Well, I should we have Dwayne hasn't showed up yet so we have time to continue to do but if if not we can pick up Yeah, so three was accounting company settings. So we covered payment type account ACH source account just Josh this morning I believe we understand these parts when we asked him about that those four accounting settings

Unknown Speaker  33:31
yeah

Speaker 2  33:35
so we just lost more money me see

Unknown Speaker  33:42
hold on a little bit

Unknown Speaker  33:48
what should we do

Unknown Speaker  34:00
we

Unknown Speaker  34:10
we can't get this up to one right

Unknown Speaker  34:21
okay

Unknown Speaker  34:43
yeah, we were we were just moving on

Unknown Speaker  34:51
Okay, well, just

Speaker 1  34:55
if you don't mind doing that might, we're actually worse You're covering a few things that would be helpful, I think for you to be on. If you have a little bit of time, we will, we could cover let's just try that there. We will keep going.

Unknown Speaker  35:51
That's good to hear me.

Unknown Speaker  35:53
Yep, I can hear you.

Speaker 3  35:55
Okay. All right, we are. So engrained jumped on the other one. And that covers off from you. So we're back. He's jumping in here now. You

Unknown Speaker  36:14
Howdy, howdy.

Unknown Speaker  36:17
So, all right. Do you want to keep rolling here? You want to?

Speaker 1  36:23
Yeah, Dwayne Blaine has until 12. So we're gonna keep going here. I think there's value in him being along for three and four as well. So let's cover that then.

Speaker 2  36:35
So three is a I don't think it affects you much. But it might default cash and bank account you probably just want to set to whatever your primary checking is called account for register probably the same way. AP account I don't think is going to affect anything in your system because you're not using the core AP system. You're using a customized AP system, the liability suspense account. I don't know. And we'll sit down so we'll chase down more documentation

Speaker 1  37:11
okay, because we covered parts of this this morning with Have you seen the what is what is the accounting report the Josh bill because

Speaker 1  37:27
is it the PIO accounting event debugging report or Josh has a report that or he's obviously

Unknown Speaker  37:44
yeah

Unknown Speaker  37:54
this is what it is or not but probably something like this.

Speaker 1  37:59
It basically shows was in more of Yeah, it's that's but I think in a diagnostic mode so.

Unknown Speaker  38:14
Yeah, sure.

Speaker 1  38:15
Is there anything that we like he obviously just I think he just picked which accounts to use there will that like setting these accounts? Accounting settings here will that

Speaker 2  38:36
where he shouldn't be using didn't really look into what he did, but he shouldn't be using things off the FTI allocation as far as

Unknown Speaker  38:48
yeah

Speaker 2  38:59
as far as where those come from, so that's I mean, this, this other setting really doesn't have any meaning to you.

Speaker 1  39:07
Right now, which, which of these settings do we need to set hard? Or do we not need to set any of them?

Unknown Speaker  39:14
It probably would be helpful to set the one and four and maybe three if I can figure out what it is.

Speaker 1  39:22
Okay, and these are these standard these settings. Default settings are part of your standard accounting. Is that where they're coming from? That is correct. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  39:56
No column for

Speaker 2  40:06
invoicing the invoicing column will be subtotal column will then

Speaker 2  40:29
I'll make that change that shows up in the next update. And then that takes us to

Unknown Speaker  40:39
think that takes us to four

Speaker 2  40:42
Yeah. All right. So let's look into some of these beer

Unknown Speaker  41:00
Yeah, they're the

Speaker 2  41:25
Rio 71962 I'm not seeing the silver.

Unknown Speaker  41:30
Okay, that's the sorry.

Unknown Speaker  41:32
System. Yeah. Sir, this is the sales order

Speaker 2  41:51
I had an invoice on Monday. Is that not correct? Basically what I went went through and I historically assigned invoice dates were all the things in the past this one was delivered on Monday. And because of that, it didn't show up on the board.

Speaker 1  42:16
Okay, so you're saying head So when would it have showed up? Had we sent this process been live would have showed up Monday?

Unknown Speaker  42:28
Tuesday morning, actually.

Speaker 1  42:30
Because I have I have both Monday and Tuesday included here now is that that pulpit? No. Or is that that Paul Phillips?

Unknown Speaker  42:40
Jennifer

Speaker 2  42:47
The reason is that Monday when I set this up, I'm gonna assume, of course, particularly.

Unknown Speaker  43:01
Now, no, I was saying this up Tuesday morning. And I sent a

Speaker 1  43:12
the Tuesday report came at around noon. So I don't know was that is that a factor? Because it was? Yeah. Today's report came first thing this morning. So

Speaker 2  43:23
I would I would take the Tuesday report a little bit with a grain of salt. Because perfect.

Speaker 1  43:29
So if we look at the Wednesday report, everything looks match exactly what happened. Okay, for Indiana, so then the next one, North Carolina we can we can consider that one. Also just look at that one with a grain of salt. And if you're saying it's not worth, it seems like it's not working.

Speaker 2  43:57
Well. Let's take a look the retail price updated at 823. one kilowatt. Yeah, I mean, I guess one of the questions is what do you do with these $0 invoices?

Speaker 1  44:13
Giveaway buildings. No. I mean that. That is a question. Like we show that I think we had looked at even at modification history and seeing that the retail price was updated on a 23

Speaker 1  44:33
Is it worth like, why did that not? Why did that price not come through?

Speaker 2  44:41
We'll see 264581234 to MRV 23 So I can see sales order. So what does that invoice date It's always had a zero price on it on this one. So how are legacy sales orders supposed to be handled?

Speaker 1  45:12
They're supposed to be communicated Dwayne's office and then they manually update it. So it looks like this one was never communicated, and obviously never updated flitter B.

Speaker 2  45:23
So we should, we should we should wait to invoice $0 invoices until they have an amount. I mean, there's no reason to invoice $0 invoice? Or is it wait to invoice a legacy sales order until I

Unknown Speaker  45:44
get a call on my MRP

Unknown Speaker  45:46
there's no point in wasting a $0 invoice. That's the bottom line.

Speaker 4  45:50
Just to clarify legacy invoices or anything to do with NC, o h, i n, those all get classified as legacy invoices because of the prefixing. So ongoing anything that's that's not anything that's still historical sheds direct stuff will come in as legacy sales orders. The legacy Sales Order button was originally created so that we can actually do IDs that are not that are not inside of our original naming convention or our current naming convention.

Speaker 2  46:22
So that has really nothing to do with what's going on here. All right. Well, I mean, in this case, I think what you want to say is I don't want to invoice the $0 invoice I want it to hang around until like invoices, but do you do you just say that it's not an invoice is never ready to invoice until it's a non zero balance?

Speaker 1  46:45
No, I think it should show up here which should prompt us to figure out why is it showing $0

Speaker 2  46:55
So do you want them? Do you want them grouped differently somehow or just leave them as is?

Speaker 1  47:03
I would say leave leave as is. Dwayne are the Leggett are we only using legacy sales orders? Or are we only doing that for sheds? Direct goings

Speaker 4  47:16
Correct? Well, okay, yes. 99.999% of the time it says direct there have been times in the past where they were used for something else but that is the predominant use case

Unknown Speaker  47:32
okay

Speaker 1  47:40
so on those buildings, I don't think it's like I'm

Speaker 1  47:51
now let's keep going. There's, we can talk about that more one. Okay, I don't know is there

Speaker 2  48:02
so 90 teams still falls within the window of time that wouldn't show up. If it doesn't have a delivery date, then it wouldn't show up on this report needing to be invoiced.

Speaker 1  48:14
Yeah. This was just biller saying hey, we did learn I know we delivered this one yesterday but event logs we don't have there was no delivery date entered yet so that

Speaker 4  48:27
is that Justin number not not a sales thing

Speaker 2  48:35
Yeah, so I mean, that basically means office has to manually go in and say hey, that was

Unknown Speaker  48:39
that is that's a lot building

Speaker 2  48:42
it's a lot building. Oh, so there is no sales order for it.

Speaker 1  48:47
Okay, that was a mistake on our site. So yeah, that and the other two the other two were we're seeing fall within golf so the NC one for this morning. Looks good.

Unknown Speaker  49:18
Back here, let's go look at this one. Let me they this one was also delivered on the 18th.

Speaker 2  49:33
Okay, good hay. Both of these were delivered on the 18th.

Speaker 1  49:39
So the last one for Ohio. Just a few interesting note. If you the Dryden Baptist Church in the Augustine, whatever. Those have a delivery date of the 15th that didn't show up until today. And you can tell me why this is so bad? For some. My understanding is that New York the hauler in New York does not have access to the hauler portal so it's just manual communication and then keep tells your office gape told your office yesterday that these have been delivered on the 15th and then you manually updated them which is why this information is all correct. It's just why it's

Unknown Speaker  50:26
showing. Correct.

Speaker 1  50:30
So Matthias if we go through here and no select like, Okay, I see you have a proposed invoice date but if we select Yes, yes, yes, send Dwayne's off as they update? What date will that by default use the date that we Dwayne's office updates? Okay. Yeah. Perfect,

Speaker 2  50:51
right. No, I mean, by default, we will use the proposed invoice date. So it was delivered on the 15th. So invoice as of the 15th because it's when it is delivered. And if you want to overwrite it, Dwayne's office will have an option to say no, no, like, let's actually, it should actually be on the 19th. And then they can go in and say, Oh, that was on the 18th.

Speaker 1  51:08
Okay. So one other thing that we had

Speaker 4  51:14
Oh, hold on Mark, backup. I was half listening. Recent say that one more time, Matthias.

Unknown Speaker  51:21
So you will go here, let's just do this

Unknown Speaker  51:26
09 to zero

Speaker 2  51:28
if you go to Sales Orders needing invoicing. So let's go to hold there's not gonna be anything in here because he's delivered. He's delivered a building today so far. There we go. You will, you will check off I mean, obviously, in this case, this is the only thing you want to invoice because the other need need information filled in. So your Invoice Selected orders and it will assign an invoice native 920. Now, if they say no, no, that needs to be invoiced as of the 18th. Then you'll go in, you'll hit Apply, and you overwrite invoice date and hit the stop in the 18 because the invoice date.

Speaker 4  52:04
Okay, understood all that. Here's one question. I do have. How, okay, let's hypothetically say transit tax was marked off for 915. Sales Order was enforced for same date? Five days later? No, no, no, no, no, that that was the wrong dates. We change the transit, the transit transit date, date, is there an expectation that we're going to be changing invoice date at that point? And how do we do it?

Unknown Speaker  52:37
Is there an expectation?

Speaker 1  52:44
Haven't thought about that? I mean, so the situation would be if you say, maybe a big job, you invoice it last day of the month, and then you come back later and say no, that actually should be on the following month or whatever.

Speaker 4  52:56
Well, it's more like there is enough manual entry. Well, all of Ohio's this manual entry currently from on a post dated situation. So first thing is the potential exists and I don't know I don't know if you're accounting for this or not, but that we get we may be updating 10 days, 510 days after the actual or a number of days after the actual transit took place and backdating that information. And I'm assuming you're going to handle that in some fashion. Secondary thing is clerical error whenever there's somebody just putting a you know a date in that is manually being stumped in the potential exists for clerical error. So how do we handle situations where it may be somebody may go back and change that or do we didn't care? Well,

Speaker 1  53:55
I think sooner or later we're going to run into a situation where we want to have be able to do that which

Unknown Speaker  54:06
we can give you a warning if you change me nevermind

Speaker 4  54:13
all I'm trying to make sure that there is enough flux that happens on the operational side of some of this stuff that I'm a little bit nervous that we're going to end ourselves up in a situation where there's a bunch of pain happening and I just want to make sure if we can think about some of that on the front end that we account for it

Speaker 4  54:37
I would really love it if this was one of those accounting operations that made logistics go behave better but you know.

Speaker 2  54:54
Oh, I have completely lost track of time. I need to just I've got to 10 o'clock today actually did get the road for

Unknown Speaker  55:06
yeah

Unknown Speaker  55:07
we can cover that one

Unknown Speaker  55:09
Okay sounds good

Unknown Speaker  55:12
thanks thanks
