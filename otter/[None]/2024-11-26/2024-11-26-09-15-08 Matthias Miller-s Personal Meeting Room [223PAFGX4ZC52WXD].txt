Unknown Speaker  13:47
Okay, can you hear me?

Matthias Miller  13:48
I can hear you. Good morning. Can you hear me? Hi? I can hear here. Yes, I can hear you. I know why. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  14:13
Okay, can you hear me now?

Matthias Miller  14:14
Yeah, I can hear you.

Speaker 1  14:17
Sorry. I am not sure I was having whole issues with Zoom. And it was, I don't even know if I have a Zoom account. It's most times either go through teams or Google me. And I was like, I'm sure I have a zoom anyway. Sorry, I, for some reason, found 930 anyway, it's a whole thing.

Matthias Miller  14:36
We're getting there. Yes, all right. Well, you want to dive in, just kind of let me know what you're looking looking for, yeah, so

Speaker 1  14:52
I think it's pretty straightforward. With our audit, we were told that for kids. That are in the household. So young adults that are in the household that are turning 18, we need to have background checks done prior to their 14 days prior to their 18th birthday. Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but this is state regs, you know? So, so in light of that, like typically, we usually need, I would say anywhere from six to 12. No, 12 weeks might be a bit much. Six to eight weeks for some of our background checks to get results back. And so for a kid, a teenager in the home turning 18. We would like, if we are alerts could show three months prior to their 18th birthday that we need, like background check alerts, which would include sex offender, State and National Sex Offender, the CBI, FBI and bi not exactly sure how we have it in. Is it biu, or is it trails, because biu

Unknown Speaker  16:15
words here, put you off to the sides

Matthias Miller  16:31
there's a central registry report is that,

Speaker 1  16:33
that's it, right there the central I knew we didn't call it trails, but I can remember what it was called. It's,

Matthias Miller  16:38
do you do? Good? Oh, if

Speaker 1  16:40
it's used so many different terms and different platforms And so,

Matthias Miller  16:48
do fingerprints need to be yes?

Unknown Speaker  16:53
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  17:01
We Okay,

Speaker 1  17:12
yeah, so it would be the fingerprint central registry, which would and then the FBI, CBI all, all the alerts that typically come up for background checks, just trying to figure out somebody who we have one that is coming up here shortly.

Matthias Miller  17:35
A lot of stuff to chase down.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
It is, it is, I,

Speaker 1  18:03
all right, so how I'm just so with what is the difference between, like the fingerprint submission date and then the FBI check date, like, what's the difference? Like, the FBI check date and the CBI check date like, what's the difference with that

Matthias Miller  18:30
the fingerprints we don't do be currently don't do before their 18th birthday. Okay, so the target date and that's only we don't. We don't do fingerprints for non caregiver occupants.

Speaker 1  18:54
I think, no, I think no, we do for anybody that's 18 or older that's in the household. We would do. We

Matthias Miller  19:01
would do, right. No, you're right, yeah, sorry, I'm misreading it, yes, but it's only for 18 and over. Correct, correct, so, but you would still want these showing up on the same schedule.

Unknown Speaker  19:16
I'm not sure I know what you mean by that. Sorry.

Matthias Miller  19:19
I mean, well, let me, let me first go back to the these other ones and see how these other ones work. So the central registry, then

Matthias Miller  19:38
everything. So currently, the way it's set up is, it's, it's, it's set up so that you do it immediately on the 18th birthday, right,

Unknown Speaker  19:45
right, okay,

Matthias Miller  19:49
I mean, I think, why did we do I.

Matthias Miller  20:07
Yeah, okay, I'll need to take a look at why we do fingerprints the way that we do it seems like fingerprints should just match. I shouldn't fingerprints just match everything else?

Unknown Speaker  20:27
I'm not sure when you when you say everything else, like,

Matthias Miller  20:30
like the, I mean, the central registry for CBI. I mean, obviously we're tracking fingerprints separately, but the fingerprinting schedule should be, we shouldn't it should. It should basically function the same as

Speaker 1  20:54
it should function the same as like the central registry so and so. Fingerprinting generates our FBI and our CBI checks. I mean, that's how it works at this point. So and it's and then it needs to be done every five years. So fingerprinting and the central registry needs to be done every five years. Sex Offender, the sex offender ones need to be done annually. So it wouldn't be on the same schedule as like the sex offender ones.

Matthias Miller  21:32
There are times I wish it'd be a way to simplify how some of these scheduling stuff works,

Unknown Speaker  21:39
and there might be

Matthias Miller  21:46
okay. So I

Matthias Miller  22:20
all right. So bottom line is, for all of these, the due dates should be 14 days prior to the 18th birthday, and they should show up three months prior to get started. Yes,

Speaker 1  22:32
that was, that's that is accurate. Okay.

Matthias Miller  22:39
All right, sounds good. I mean, I don't know what other questions ask me. I mean, I think it's that simple. Yeah.

Speaker 1  22:46
I mean, that's like, that's the baseline. That's what we're working with. So, yeah, as far as if you can figure out ways to simplify it, like, yeah, let me know. But that's what we're working with, Okay,

Matthias Miller  22:57
sounds good. Do you? You don't, do you care at all about timeline?

Speaker 1  23:05
No, not necessarily. You know, preferably, probably three months or so would be nice, but there's nothing really. I mean, obviously we're gonna, like, we're gonna be keeping closer tabs on it on our end, because we were audited for this year. So yeah, but yeah, we'll just keep closer tabs onto it so it's all up and rolling. But no, there's not really any specific timeline needed.

Matthias Miller  23:35
All right, I'm gonna just giving you a ballpark, and I think it's probably gonna end up being somewhere from it's not more than 500 and it's probably closer to two to two to 300 but

Speaker 2  23:45
okay, okay, that works. Okay, that works. All right, sounds good. All right, so it's

Unknown Speaker  23:50
already took me long, so long to get here

Matthias Miller  23:55
today.

Speaker 1  23:58
So true. All right, thanks. Matthias, Thanks, Kristen. All right, we'll see ya, yep. All right.
