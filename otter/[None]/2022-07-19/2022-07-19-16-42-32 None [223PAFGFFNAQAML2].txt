So this is an observation about how people get stuck into certain avenues or markets. And they miss the opportunity that's in front. I think one of the things that insight has taught me is that is just how quickly these things can change. And what happens when you have a hyper responsive market. And like there's just there's so many things that you get from this type of experience, and working in this type of experience that is really hard. To articulate, quantify. You can have somebody warn you about all of these types of things that can go sideways. But unless you actually I don't know sometimes quite frankly, what you need is to see these things up close and in front of you to really understand them. You know, you know, in retrospect, what are some of the lessons the lesson was, I should have learned the full scaling potential of insight and actually actually how far they wanted to scale and what targets and they never gave us any targets.

And so now they're putting the brakes on because of that, and we got to help them get the brakes off.

The next question is you know, what's, what are the other realizations? I mean, I think I think that you know, looking at the production bottleneck as the as the barrier to where we want to go, I think this is a really helpful grid and lens to look at the thing I keep keep looking at is like there's this low friction. Where's the absolute lowest possible How do you eliminate friction from almost every part of the process and and then as a result of that, you so then what happens if you end up in a 99? One market? And how do you defend How do you build a moat for a frictionless 99 one market? Think that's perhaps the other question. Yeah, anyway,

Unknown Speaker  02:27
All right
