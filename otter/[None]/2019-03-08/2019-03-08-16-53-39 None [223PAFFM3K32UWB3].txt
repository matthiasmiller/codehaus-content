Speaker 1  00:01
So anytime that we looked at anything besides God for what the things that God provides, we are entering into a curse because God Himself is the good God.

Speaker 1  00:15
And so we get to choose whether we plug into a blessing or a curse

Speaker 1  00:20
religiosity is demonic. Because it fills roles of God that were intended to be filled by him. But aren't

Speaker 1  00:32
when we when the presence of the Holy Spirit is absent,

Speaker 1  00:39
and his working is suppressed and ignored. And his voice is silence

Unknown Speaker  00:50
is always replaced with a false god,

Unknown Speaker  00:55
that false god will have the appearance

Unknown Speaker  01:00
of righteousness without the power

Speaker 1  01:05
and the power that it does have will be a power that is detrimental and destructive and dark

Unknown Speaker  01:26
question then becomes

Unknown Speaker  01:29
what how we replace the Holy Spirit with

Speaker 1  01:34
we replaced them with a set of doctrinal statements that once again have the appearance of righteousness

Speaker 1  01:43
better, but our void is power there Firstly, sexual demonic

Speaker 1  01:52
doctrines apart from from a connection with price

Unknown Speaker  01:57
will always Distort and will always bring death

Unknown Speaker  02:05
when we rely

Unknown Speaker  02:05
on doctors to bring us the security that

Unknown Speaker  02:08
we're supposed to find Jesus Christ,

Unknown Speaker  02:12
or when we use doctrines

Unknown Speaker  02:16
and religious structures

Speaker 1  02:19
to bring us comfort that should only come from Jesus Christ, when we use that to bring us guidance as to only sell for Jesus Christ.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
And we are already deceived, and we are already deceived, we are already deceived,

Unknown Speaker  02:30
we are putting ourselves under a curse, we are putting ourselves under a curse, we are putting ourselves under a curse.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
The only structures

Speaker 1  02:37
that are allowed to exist in our lives are the structures that are put

Unknown Speaker  02:40
in place

Unknown Speaker  02:42
by the Holy Spirit.

Unknown Speaker  02:44
And those structures must only

Speaker 1  02:47
as long as they are in alignment with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit moves when the Holy Spirit moves,

Speaker 1  02:52
and he changes the structures, the holy spirit moves, and he changes the structures we bring a curse upon ourselves. When we stay with the old structures, we bring a curse upon ourselves. When we stay with the old structures, we bring a curse upon ourselves. When we stay with the old structures. If we want to walk in the blessing

Unknown Speaker  03:00
of God, we have to walk if we want to walk in the blessing of God, we have to walk if we want to walk in the blessing of God, we have to walk

Speaker 1  03:05
we have to know when to stop and when to go. We have to know when to stop and when to go. We have to know when to stop and when to go.

Speaker 1  03:10
This is why Jesus talked about you cannot put

Speaker 1  03:16
new wine into old wine skins, because the old wine skins will not be able to bear it.

Unknown Speaker  03:25
You must put new wine into new wine skins,

Speaker 1  03:29
so that the structure can adapt and be

Unknown Speaker  03:32
pliable to the working of the Holy Spirit

Speaker 1  03:37
is the work and function of the Holy Spirit to convict

Speaker 1  03:42
and if we rely on any other tool such as same the opinion of man

Unknown Speaker  03:50
our own self expectation,

Unknown Speaker  03:54
Leslie self discipline,

Unknown Speaker  03:58
we will put ourselves under a curse, we will put ourselves under a curse, we will put ourselves under a curse.

Unknown Speaker  04:03
If we

Unknown Speaker  04:08
try to protect ourselves

Unknown Speaker  04:11
with any tool

Unknown Speaker  04:12
apart from the protection of God

Unknown Speaker  04:15
that we will put ourselves under a curse.

Unknown Speaker  04:20
we attempt to

Speaker 1  04:20
derive any authority other than the authority that has been granted to us

Unknown Speaker  04:26
by God.

Unknown Speaker  04:28
We will not only bring ourselves under a curse,

Unknown Speaker  04:33
but

Speaker 1  04:33
we will put those under us under that same curse.

Speaker 1  04:41
Once again, there is no hope, apart from the hope of Jesus Christ, because Jesus Christ is the only ones who will be found faithful. We put our faith in anything apart from Jesus Christ,

Speaker 1  05:00
the fruit is hopelessness.

Speaker 1  05:06
God has given us the fivefold ministry because this is his order.

Unknown Speaker  05:14
When we choose not to partner with his order.

Unknown Speaker  05:18
We bring a curse on ourselves

Unknown Speaker  05:23
because we

Speaker 1  05:23
are disconnecting ourselves from the structure and function

Unknown Speaker  05:30
of God's authority.

Speaker 1  05:37
It is important to note that the fivefold guests are Christ. Yes, gift to man.

Speaker 1  05:45
It is something that he has given. Therefore, it is His provision,

Unknown Speaker  05:51
what do we choose to neglect. His provision

Speaker 1  05:56
may choose to disregard the faithfulness of Christ through His provision, provision,

Unknown Speaker  06:03
and we find ourselves empty

Speaker 1  06:08
and unfulfilled, underdeveloped and underutilized.

Unknown Speaker  06:13
We find the body malnourished

Unknown Speaker  06:17
because the

Speaker 1  06:17
body has not accepted and use the provision of Jesus Christ for its growth and its

Unknown Speaker  06:25
edification.
