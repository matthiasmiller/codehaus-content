Speaker 1  00:01
This was also the lesson of Isaac and Israel with Abraham. The lesson was that

Unknown Speaker  00:07
God

Speaker 1  00:08
was to be the provider through this promise and God God told him how this is going to happen. But But Abraham to get into his own hands to become his own provider to fulfill the promise of his own accord, and he stepped out of faith.

Speaker 1  00:27
And rather than receiving the blessing and the promise of God, he received the wages for his work. And the same principle continues today. This is why you should have no other gods.

Speaker 1  00:42
If you have other gods, you will end up creating a religion,

Unknown Speaker  00:47
you end up creating a religion

Unknown Speaker  00:49
that

Speaker 1  00:51
the younger generation is disillusioned with, and you end up cutting off the next generation from faith in Jesus Christ.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
The only

Speaker 1  00:59
way to pass on faith in Jesus Christ to the next generation is to get them connected to a God

Speaker 1  01:08
who is real to the real God who is faithful and true, where they can see an experience through space, the faithfulness

Unknown Speaker  01:19
of God,

Unknown Speaker  01:23
this is what it means to be relevant.

Unknown Speaker  01:31
If you substitute

Unknown Speaker  01:35
the presence of God with an experience

Speaker 1  01:39
with merely an experience apart from God.

Unknown Speaker  01:45
The experience

Speaker 1  01:48
will lack the transformation power that you need to live a godly life.

Speaker 1  01:55
But when you encounter the person of God and you experience the presence of God, it leaves a mark

Speaker 1  02:03
because why God is faithful.
