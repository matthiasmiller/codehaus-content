Okay, so in answering your question about what is allowed with accountants, financial advisors, insurance agents, etc. I don't think there's any reason that they can't like refer a consultant more so those cautionary flags would go up if if, like when I was a financial rep, if I was then referring someone to a CPA or an attorney, then you might slap some things on there as far as like you do some of your own research and stuff like or like, you know, I don't have a legal background or whatever, but you could talk to so usually we'd give them like two or three different names, and then usually three recommendations, and then let them kind of sift it out versus being like, oh, you should definitely just talk to Bob and only to Bob, because then there can be a little bit of liability that would get thrown back at you. That way, were a consultant. I don't see that being an issue.
