So we used the names to feed list to help the brain instead of like rocking it in, like, in the nightclub with like three. Instead, I would come out of those with like 10, or more sometimes referrals. And so I became known as like the queen of doing this within our state. Anyway, so And that, by the way is a big predictor of success to like how well are you able to prospect and get referred and to places. So thankfully for what you're doing, you don't need as many prospects and like you don't have to use a list. That's just an easy tool. So trust your gut, whether you should do that or not. Or you might just go in with a list for you to look up and not put in front of them. And so like, you know, these are some of the companies that I'm looking to get in front of like, who do you know, that works at XYZ company? I think that would actually work really well for you.
