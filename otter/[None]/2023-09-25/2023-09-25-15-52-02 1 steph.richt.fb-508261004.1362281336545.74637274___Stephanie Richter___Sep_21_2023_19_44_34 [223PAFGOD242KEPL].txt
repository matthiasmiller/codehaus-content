Okay, so yeah, so just listen to those timestamps. And I would agree the better one is at the 922 mark, because that elevates you to the status of still being in that leadership role, and then speaking into the head coach's ear, whereas like when he was talking about different players on the team that makes you sound like an employee, which is not worth going for. So I do like that second one better than 922 Mark, for that reason. And like he said, you would need to briefly explain and draw it back. Because for instance, I don't follow basketball. The only time I really watched basketball was when my brother played in high school. That was I don't watch basketball. And there might be others as well. In corporate roles, who aren't necessarily into sports, some people will be some people won't. It'll be a Mac. So yeah, I do think if you're going to use that, to be clear, and articulating, what does that mean? Even like hearing like third or fourth assistant, and like, that sounds kind of down the line, like not so important. But once you understand the role that they actually play, you realize how critical it is. So just being really clear, to outline that for them and fill in the blanks for the brain to be fully tracking and get the value that you're bringing
