Matthias Miller  02:20
Good afternoon mark. How you doing?

Speaker 1  02:30
I feel like I'm getting my head above water. Just a little bit. Dripping a little bit. Yeah. How about you?

Matthias Miller  02:40
What? What nostril out?

Unknown Speaker  02:46
Yeah, at least that much.

Matthias Miller  02:52
Yeah, well, I kind of feel like I'm maybe on the other side of that just a little bit ahead too two to two, six weeks sprint. So yeah, I'll be getting my head above water, but it's actually slowing down instead of speeding up. So you were good. You are

Speaker 1  03:19
reasonably is it something? You said? You're training a peer group sometime here? Is that started already?

Matthias Miller  03:27
Yeah, actually actually joined, actually joined in December. But then we had a meeting beginning of May.

Speaker 1  03:39
Yeah. Is that other other people in the same field you are in or just the business owners or what?

Matthias Miller  03:50
No, it's different people from different different fields and sectors which there's another guy who, who had a background in software and actually a background in similar financial, similar financial software as if that would have been the past. That there's a variety of I mean, there's a there's a cabinet. There's a high end cabinet maker, there's folks who get one, one guy, one guy has a guarantees, guarantees that parents will be able to get their kids into the college of in their first or second choice college. And he's been doing it for 15 years and he's never he's never not been able to do it. Wow.

Speaker 1  04:55
What do you find most helpful about a peer group like that?

Matthias Miller  05:00
It's there's two things. One is the act of intentionally disconnecting from your day to day by itself lends insight. And there's prep forums and things like that, that we submit beforehand and, and just thinking things through, where am I at what's going on? What needs to be fixed? What do I need to do? That process is helpful. And then

Unknown Speaker  05:30
it's the,

Matthias Miller  05:32
it's the friendships that you get out of that the relationships the folks who can. Like sometimes just knowing you get, you got folks in your corner. And then it's also just the diverse experiences you've got. From the air there, it's maybe eight to 10 Different people with vastly different experiences, but all they're all sharp people just coming at life and coming with different experiences and being able to sometimes when you're noodling on something you just you keep drilling down on one specific path and having having folks to kind of jolt you out of that just a little bit and start looking at looking at it other ways

Unknown Speaker  06:26
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  06:28
I've never I've never been a part of a peer group Jay here is of a local group here and yeah, I know that he finds it

Unknown Speaker  06:39
quite helpful. I think they're all our business owners and I think different industries but all dealing with similar challenges and just

Speaker 1  07:02
to own my own business but I get the white lonely like business owners like making a lot of money they've got it made their own balls. And I think it's also a lonely there's like it could be kind of a lonely area like responsible for pottery spot responsibility that goes with it was to make sure that you're supporting a lot of different learning a lot of families and having having a group of people or you can talk about challenges and inclusion

Unknown Speaker  07:53
seems like one of the good things out of some peer groups Yeah.

Matthias Miller  08:03
Yeah, I would, I would agree somebody somebody once said you can't you can't go to a church potluck and start complaining about your $100,000 tax bill that doesn't work very well.

Unknown Speaker  08:21
Yeah, I should find that that quote that there's a local company that really I think he put it out as respectable local business and he just had a bunch of different different things that he said one thing he said if you go to family reunions and you

Speaker 1  08:49
don't talk you know you don't talk a whole lot and you're stuck up and if you if you start talking about your business and you're needed those understands things like that

Speaker 1  09:08
I got that's not why we set up this call, but it was interesting. So where I sent you a little list of you tell me where you want to start and also how much time do we have? Do do you have the full 90 minutes Are you do we need to

Matthias Miller  09:32
gap I've got the full 90 minutes I'm actually just a little bit late coming into the office here and so might fill the air just a little bit more with what I've got on my list or what I thought we could do one of the one of the things I was supposed to get this every well let me start with a little bit of an update. One of the things that I'm working on now is And one of the reasons for my question the other day about project management is getting, getting better project management systems in place. And one of the things I'm having Audra work on right now is, is centralizing a lot of this work that needs to be done. Yeah, just making so I have a master list at least of what needs to be done as far as IFRS is concerned, and then also, if there's things that I feel like I need to be following up on to make sure it happens, that we've, we've got that and she can also be able to start helping to follow up on some of these things and keep those keep those things moving. And so they'll take a little bit to get some of this stuff transferred, transferred in and nailed down and all of that but I'm hoping that'll help streamline at least my end of the process and hopefully I'll be dropping fewer things along the way

Unknown Speaker  11:15
I did

Matthias Miller  11:18
I did get over that depreciation schedule thing and I think it's got some gaps in it some things that we probably should Joe and I might need to dig into a bit and flush that out. And the other thing I thought we could do during this time as well

Unknown Speaker  11:42
is go through the

Matthias Miller  11:48
go through the the project overview and kind of look at things that we should be picking up

Unknown Speaker  11:55
moving forward

Matthias Miller  12:01
and I'll be your list in about two minutes here

Unknown Speaker  12:13
I think that's about what what I had on my list as well as far as the cover so the on your project management that you said what do you say her name was Audrey

Matthias Miller  12:37
Audra AUD Ra.

Speaker 1  12:41
Audra. Okay. It's no that's somebody else that's sending the eight year invoices, right.

Matthias Miller  12:48
That's the amber who's sending the invoices.

Speaker 1  12:51
Okay, okay. But is this a new a new assistant or Secretary that you've hired?

Speaker 2  12:58
Yes, it is. Yeah. As of now it's been it's been

Matthias Miller  13:06
Yeah, a number of weeks

Speaker 1  13:13
do all of the people all of your code house people are all of them remote or some of them like like Ben is or some of them in Colorado

Matthias Miller  13:29
they're Amber is actually as local as they get. So she's downstairs in the same building. And Audrey is actually based in in Colorado and actually shares the same last name 00 relation or connection, but she's in Northeastern. It just just so happened. She's in northeastern Colorado.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
Okay, so yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:02
I've I've kept thinking boy, it would be it'd be nice sometimes to have built up an office full of people. And maybe it'll still happen some time but every time ago looking for people I want to work with they don't end up living around me. So I don't know what it says about my living choices. Yeah,

Speaker 1  14:23
what What took you to Colorado in the first place? You liked the area?

Matthias Miller  14:29
What took me in the first place was New Horizons.

Unknown Speaker  14:33
That was the

Speaker 1  14:36
Yeah, that was the first thing that the New Horizons

Unknown Speaker  14:41
what's the

Matthias Miller  14:43
it's prison prison miss? Yeah, prison ministry plus foster care for a while plus foster care, originally for probably best known for foster care of incarcerated for incarcerated moms terminated incarcerated moms. And then especially in the last what it hasn't been four years, maybe five years. The like prison ministry side has really opened up and they've been they've actually and then when COVID hit, they moved from from prison into the jails and so they've had a lot of opportunity in the

Unknown Speaker  15:21
in the county jails as well. Okay,

Speaker 1  15:27
so you were you're involved with that and then decided to make Colorado your home

Matthias Miller  15:35
yeah, I met Bonita out here. And we both we both preferred Colorado over where we came from. And so it was kind of a no brainer for us to

Unknown Speaker  15:48
settle down and hang out here yeah well,

Speaker 1  15:57
I've been out west once and I I can imagine if Yeah, there's there's I can imagine I can understand why people like it out there but a different temperature than in the east.

Matthias Miller  16:14
Yeah. Very much 300 days of sunshine a year they say and normally that does bad things for for the grass and the greenery but we just got got through with about two weeks of rain which is often on which is pretty unusual for us. So we're enjoying a green Colorado which at least in this part, so it's pretty it's pretty amazing.

Speaker 1  16:38
Yeah. Did you ever thought of base and saw the guy I work with it at right he's in Denver while somewhere he went on? He currently is on a three day three day two night whitewater rafting while they're rafting for three days and camping for two nights on class five rapids on the Colorado River if not found it pretty pretty crazy that they've had extra the rivers extra high right now because of all the snow snow melt and he said they might might have to change the route I guess class five rapids wouldn't be safe in the first place but it's something that's a little safer

Unknown Speaker  17:33
it's interesting if

Matthias Miller  17:39
hats off I'm not a big water guy to start with so you're sticking yourself voluntarily sticking yourself into that kind of kind of thing just doesn't really sound that fun to me but hats off to the adventure lovers enjoy it

Speaker 1  17:54
yeah he said it was on it's something on his blog that list and wanted to try it

Unknown Speaker  18:01
yeah

Speaker 1  18:03
it sounds like it could be pretty dangerous that they have three three rafts and then a kayak or and they're doing that on a kayak is absolutely nuts

Matthias Miller  18:21
there's the Arkansas goes right through town here and there's a lot of rafters it hasn't rafting season hasn't quite started but a bunch of rafters going through there so if you if you got a little bit of a sinister bent to you interesting pastime is is just standing on the bridge and seeing how well people fare going through some

Unknown Speaker  18:40
of those spots

Speaker 1  18:47
a little bit like going to the rodeo and watching the bull riders maybe

Matthias Miller  18:54
well if you if you do don't come to Canyon City for it we had one successful ride I believe the last time the rodeo was in town which is about on par for the course so anyway

Matthias Miller  19:10
All right. Well jumping into

Unknown Speaker  19:19
let's see. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:22
jumping in to FTI stuff.

Unknown Speaker  19:29
The Alright, so this is

Speaker 1  19:43
if I think it might be helpful if you would send me the most recent copy of the Dyna develop development proposal and probably have it but I have the most recent

Speaker 1  20:07
And if you don't mind also sent me the if you don't mind sent me the actual PDF to the mark dot t and then also sent the PDF as a file well PDF and Word document or whatever document whatever form to the files that inside automation than a Word document I have I'll be able to our process search scroll and print out portions of in whatever absolutely

Matthias Miller  20:43
okay both of those

Speaker 2  20:44
are coming to you in the next 30 seconds or so. Okay

Matthias Miller  20:50
so while we're doing that

Unknown Speaker  20:52
we're going to

Unknown Speaker  21:09
we

Matthias Miller  21:33
okay so big pieces are gonna make a few notes while you're while it's coming coming your way include FTI numbers in

Speaker 2  21:46
finished goods inventory that's one

Unknown Speaker  22:23
do we have

Unknown Speaker  22:34
we actually see what else

Unknown Speaker  22:48
cash word

Unknown Speaker  23:01
appreciation skin schedule

Unknown Speaker  23:21
that's the this is the other major piece

Speaker 2  23:30
this would be to design AR slash AP impact maybe that will actually happen here

Matthias Miller  24:11
so there's a few loose ends

Matthias Miller  24:19
on the SGIP so I'm talking to Nick later later today. There's things like actually you know, digging these numbers thinking these numbers live, shifting these moving these numbers to from the district rec level

Unknown Speaker  24:39
to the company level. See if I can find that one to labor intensive moving labor intensive buildings

Unknown Speaker  25:17
That one we need to.

Matthias Miller  25:45
I don't think there's much more on. Yeah, I think that's down to a few kind of loose ends, will will change those labor intensive buildings to be built are specific. And then we will. And then Dwayne can update those numbers. And once we're happy with the numbers, we can start plugging them into the we can make the coding change to plug that into the inventory value on the building record. Your head, we said we could actually do that now rather than later. Sooner rather than later because you manually Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  26:25
Let me make a note. Taka. Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  26:42
A, make a note to do that this afternoon.

Matthias Miller  26:47
All right. Do you have anything else from the FDA side that

Unknown Speaker  26:49
that you think we should be? Taking a look at?

Speaker 1  26:59
I have here, I have it in front of me here. I like to just go through it real quick. And so you're you're moving labor intensive? Building rules from company from company to builder? That's right. That that was what we discussed with Dwayne on our last call. When Dwayne was in the office here to make so that okay, then it then it would they appear in the same table then as the the other like the default percentages?

Matthias Miller  27:42
Yes, correct. And then that lets us change the the FDI rules. I mean, it started the labor intensive rules on a day to day basis. So as of July 1, we're gonna start using these new FDI rules, etc.

Speaker 1  27:58
Okay, and we will be but that will all be written into the, into the rules themselves, right?

Matthias Miller  28:08
No, the, there will be a date. There'll be an effective date. That's not written into well, there'll be in the same table that we have the percentages, we'll put in the rules. And we'll pick whichever, whichever set of rules based on based on the build date.

Speaker 1  28:34
Okay, so we could have so so let's, let's say we have a builder that will recalculate 10%. That's the default setting. And then June 1, we want to start being a labor intensive calculation. And so we say, we have we have the space to enter June 1 As of the, like, the effective as of date. And we want to pay 12% on let's say any any building with vinyl siding, rather than 10%. So how will we How will we will the rules say 2% More than default rate or will it say for Senator, how are you going to handle that? I know we talked several different ways and

Unknown Speaker  29:41
I don't remember the rules or how I was. Sure.

Matthias Miller  29:46
The rules are going to basically be the it's basically going to be like an Excel formula. So Dwayne can write them either way. Basically, it would be Yeah, you know, for that row, it's what's the expression? Or what's the formula to calculate the labor intensive amount. And so if he wants to, he can write it, just say, we, it's 10 plus. And then if it's a vinyl siding building, then your additional 2%. Else, zero not to add anything else. Or he could write it such that if it's a vinyl, siding, it's 12. Else 10. And it's just up to him how he wants to write that formula.

Speaker 1  30:39
Okay, and we're not needing to write the date in there, because the date will be like a in a separate cell, basically, it says, like this, before we get to June first that will doesn't even apply.

Speaker 2  30:55
Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 1  31:01
but but we won't have gone to have it set up to where we have one cell for the effective date and other cell for the rule or the condition that basically says if it meets this criteria, then use

Unknown Speaker  31:15
manage in this cell basically have three, three cells for a labor intensive rule, you'd have the effective date, the rule itself,

Speaker 1  31:33
is the criteria, like, if building cladding equals vinyl than doing if not, whatever, then we'll write the amount right directly into the whether we do you know, 10% plus 2%, or 12%, or whatever, we'll write that directly into

Unknown Speaker  31:58
the formula.

Unknown Speaker  32:04
Or into the rule, expression, I should say,

Matthias Miller  32:07
now that you're talking about it more thoroughly, the 10% is going to be included in the column for pay for production labor. And so what would make the most sense would be to calculate the right the labor intensive as an additional percentage on top of that?

Speaker 1  32:30
How would you so in some cases, you might have two different conditions, you might have one building or you want to say, if it's this building then have three different so you had your default building? So and then you have one building that if it meets, if it's vinyl siding, then at 2%? And if it's metal siding, the net 5% Would that be that need to be different rules sets of rules, then we would probably do to either

Matthias Miller  33:09
the way that simplest to do it is to have that as a simple, simple formula. So there's something that I think Excel

Unknown Speaker  33:19
I'm not sure if Libre Office has this. There's a

Matthias Miller  33:25
there's an ifs function, if but it's plural, where it takes condition when you use it.

Matthias Miller  33:38
That'd be a natural leader.

Speaker 1  33:40
It goes to the first condition that if condition one isn't true, then it moves to condition two and condition three, all the way until it finds the first condition that's true. Correct.

Unknown Speaker  33:59
Got it. So that in that part has not been built yet?

Matthias Miller  34:09
Well, I mean, Blaine, that's what Dwayne Dwayne is going to configure them in the live system based on whatever numbers you sent him in he'll he'll put all those rules in there for you guys however, however you want

Speaker 1  34:22
and I don't think we'll get around to doing it but if we were to test it on the fishing system, we could test this on the company record but it would not have the it wouldn't have a place for an effective date it that.

Matthias Miller  34:40
No, you could test it if you were to test it, we have a system wide setting. And so you could say if builder equals this and builder condition, then use this labor intensive amount

Unknown Speaker  34:57
as a

Matthias Miller  34:59
company is a system wide setting but we don't have anything right now for that on the company level

Unknown Speaker  35:08
but the system system wide would would that have an effective date?

Matthias Miller  35:16
No right now you would have to do okay if it's this builder and it's in this date range

Speaker 1  35:24
that would once you with the change you're making then you can do an effective date correct

Speaker 1  35:42
so I'd like to just go through the proposal quickly

Speaker 1  35:54
refresher almost. So five finished goods inventory processes permissions cost categories nothing has changed that's

Unknown Speaker  36:10
thanks point two points actual cause.

Speaker 1  36:43
To wrap my head around the 3.5 point 2.3 FTI X actual cause the actual cost is basically the actual costs it's talking about there is is basically a number derived an actual cost derived from the accounting system that is plugged in as a way to

Unknown Speaker  37:17
or true up

Speaker 1  37:22
that right or am I am I missed a go oh yeah great cause percentage automatic This is the cause to do that that's

Speaker 1  37:44
okay, so what what you're required what needs to manually be entered is the period start date the end date and the cost and then the other two numbers are automatic domain if extra number for that period and then obviously the percentage correct financial allocations

Speaker 1  38:43
so in in three five to four FDI financial allocations there we're talking about is that on the accounting side now

Matthias Miller  39:05
it's the bridge between

Unknown Speaker  39:09
the bridge between both both sides but yes, it's the accounting tightened

Speaker 1  39:22
and is this is this basically where if you do the one above 2.3 then this is where you would go to get you know once everything is assessed accounting This is where you would get your information like your your cost number.

Unknown Speaker  39:44
This is where actual

Unknown Speaker  39:45
cost

Matthias Miller  39:48
this is what determines where this could require this give us some more context. The financial allocations is what determines which accounts what money you get split

Unknown Speaker  40:00
into which accounts

Unknown Speaker  40:09
what money gets

Matthias Miller  40:12
so maybe I'm looking at the wrong thing but so for example, the the FDI account section, you've got the cost category, which is the three categories. So let's say production labor, your source account would be your production labor

Matthias Miller  40:33
liability account or something like that. Your destination would be your production labor FGI asset account, your cogs expense account would be your cost of goods production labor, and your variance would be your cost of goods production labor variance account. GL account,

Speaker 1  40:57
okay, it is these four are we have to define which general ledger accounts where it needs to go to which general ledger accounts it needs to look at to get the information.

Matthias Miller  41:13
Yeah, that's correct. And would that lets us that way, we're not we're not hard coding those accounts

Unknown Speaker  41:20
into the ftdi module.

Unknown Speaker  41:29
FTA cost

Unknown Speaker  41:30
category

Speaker 1  41:35
Okay, yeah, there Yeah. Like you said we'd have to pick one of the three and then FDI source account required list have you lost me a little bit on the FTA source account where you said a liability

Speaker 1  41:55
that I think okay, this is where where you're getting your information whatever account you're

Unknown Speaker  42:07
the accounting system wherever you're posting you're doing payroll or if we're doing whichever for the costing let's let's assume we're doing option labor, this is where you would post your payroll

Unknown Speaker  42:32
Yes,

Speaker 1  42:33
in the accounting system, and then the destination account is where

Unknown Speaker  42:43
we're where it's going within FTI and then the cogs expense account that's where it's going when the buildings is sold then right. Once it shows up on the back on the income statement, okay.

Speaker 1  43:32
Like my, my head is counting things right now. I can't quite wrap my head around it. But I think once we start testing and using it, then so let's Yeah, let's keep going, man, it's basically the bridge between the two. The bridge between FDI and accounting.

Unknown Speaker  43:58
Yeah, yep. That's right.

Speaker 1  44:03
So when we Okay. When we're required to list general ledger accounts? If so, once once those are once we nail down Chart of Accounts, we've entered that information here changing those just on the flies will create havoc in a lot of places, but obviously here right I mean, if we, if if we have general ledger kind of production payroll, and then later we say, You know what they should be production payroll, tier one and production payroll, tier two for

Unknown Speaker  44:40
queries, then that would mean we would have to remember to update it here as well.

Matthias Miller  44:48
Yes, and you probably want to use an effective date. No, start that allocation as of a new effective date so that you don't have a I mean, you If you want to reallocate Well, you have to think through the implications if you if you want to change that reallocation, and most likely you're gonna want a new effective date. And do it as of probably the, the earliest that you want to do it is as of the beginning of the current month, and then you could, you could have a and then it would automatically create a GL entry that would reassign buildings within that month to the proper GL accounts. But most likely, you wouldn't want to you'd have to have a new set of allocations once you when you change it, you probably don't want to go all the way back to the beginning of the year you're gonna have a massive GL entry shifting all kinds of accounts around in the middle of the year

Speaker 1  45:49
so moving on to three point Yeah, that helped. I feel like my mind is so full of accounting things right now that 3.53 Cause.

Speaker 1  47:06
In this 33531 is talking about break down on a on an individual building

Unknown Speaker  47:24
Yes.

Matthias Miller  47:27
Okay. It's the full the full details everything you should ever possibly need to know. Hopefully.

Unknown Speaker  47:34
Yeah, credit card fees. Is that what Wayne was showing me on the stripe work that Josh had probably done on is that the work that he has done to bring that information Medicare fees and Silver's at a fee,

Unknown Speaker  47:57
or to have it but this is also a

Matthias Miller  48:08
we need to add I'm making a note to myself, we need to add integration of stripe payouts into the accounting system.

Speaker 1  48:16
But this okay, what in 3.2? On sales orders add a fee column to the payments? That's not on the customer facing side the credit card fee? Is it that's showing?

Matthias Miller  48:32
Yeah, on the sales order. We have a payments RG that shows a list of all the payments. And so for credit card payments, there's an additional column that has a fee column filled in that's the the dollars and cents of the of that fee. But it's only internal it's only used for accounting impact.

Speaker 1  48:51
And where's that amount? Like if there's a car payment for $1,000 and say the fee is $3? Where's that $3 coming from the information for that? Is that coming from stripe or does that need to be manually entered?

Unknown Speaker  49:06
Stripe?

Speaker 1  49:09
Okay, so it is it is calculating whatever stripe is it's getting that information from so if they if their rates changed, then it'll be reflected here. Yes. And that is that part. That part is done is working?

Unknown Speaker  49:32
No. Yes.

Matthias Miller  49:36
Pretty sure. 90 95%

Unknown Speaker  49:39
competency, yes.

Speaker 1  49:41
When Dwayne was here he was showing me a little bit some of the stripe information. And was that something that Josh would have done?

Unknown Speaker  49:54
Yes, that is something Josh would have implemented.

Matthias Miller  49:59
Now there's There's a separate issue around payouts which is

Unknown Speaker  50:03
something slightly different but

Speaker 1  50:11
but this is on the individual building the payout or the payment history breaking that down into what the cost okay perfect accounting transactions so good

Speaker 1  50:38
okay I know we've all if I remember correctly 533 accounting transaction can link to a stint or a sales order so at any point anywhere in the accounting system

Speaker 1  50:57
transaction is linked to a standard or a sales order right so that if we see a deposit of $1,000 We can click on that or follow that link and see what sales order it was for that what we're

Unknown Speaker  51:20
Yep, that's right.

Unknown Speaker  51:22
Okay good looking

Unknown Speaker  51:29
as a date the sales or payments are sheet

Unknown Speaker  51:54
what's an S O ID

Unknown Speaker  51:59
that's the same as

Matthias Miller  52:01
sales order ID it's an internal identity

Speaker 1  52:14
what is the to do Mark revisit this with Dwayne Is that something that still needs to be done?

Unknown Speaker  52:38
Somebody did not leave enough of a trailer here. Um

Unknown Speaker  52:52
counts payable

Matthias Miller  53:01
did we ever spell out how the deposit process works? I think what we said let me see where I think we ended up with

Unknown Speaker  53:22
the

Matthias Miller  53:27
the idea was we would that people that whoever's in accounting would enter a deposit with whatever and with a when they entered the deposit, they would they would put in the skin or the sales order ID that it was for. And we would recognize that and stamp it in as the deposit date is that your recollection?

Speaker 1  54:03
And the deposit date would be transfer would be so the deposit date would be information coming to the person in accounting from

Unknown Speaker  54:17
the district telling them here's what we're going to deposit today. Like if if portable has said that they're going to deposit model they would however, they convey that information to accounting that

Speaker 1  54:44
needs to be a system on what what deposit date, how that's communicated to basically the people in in handling the checks and making the deposit need to have a way to tell accounting when they expect Put this cheque in the bank but

Matthias Miller  55:06
in which buildings and

Speaker 1  55:07
I wonder if yeah my to do here is that nail down that process like there has to be a system there on how you know is it a whole bunch of details are we tracking it on a per diem basis which we're yeah on a person and how's the information being communicated

Unknown Speaker  55:34
right well I think you

Matthias Miller  55:39
have to stick my nose where it shouldn't be I think you need it on a person or you don't know who to collect from

Speaker 1  55:46
Oh yeah, absolutely. Good

Matthias Miller  55:53
so I think next steps on this one is if you can nail down that process let's make sure that you guys are on board with that process before

Unknown Speaker  55:57
we make any coding changes around

Matthias Miller  56:02
or are you comfortable that well no, I think that's the right way unless you unless you disagree some reason

Speaker 1  56:11
no, I would agree 100% Good deserty silver okay. Well that brings up another point that means that in order to do this right any anything that

Unknown Speaker  56:31
basically

Speaker 1  56:32
any money that a company collects we need to be able to tie that to a sales order and where it stands right now we can create sales orders for Windows a neighbor from a neighbor stops and wants to buy two windows we can create a sales order for two windows right that functionality is in place or does their needs in

Unknown Speaker  57:06
no Stan

Matthias Miller  57:08
no step needed

Speaker 1  57:09
with that simply be like start with a sales order instead of using a skin we just have an accessory item present or whatever whatever the item is.

Matthias Miller  57:21
Yeah, but I also think Josh made some changes recently on a sales orders that allows you to sell from inventory. Trying to remember details in that a where he was going to

Speaker 1  57:39
vendor on vendor invoices where we can we can create an internal like an assist vendor invoice without an attached purchase order. Is it something you also do something on the sales order?

Matthias Miller  58:01
Automatically Mr. misremembering we do have a raw material cost of the added

Unknown Speaker  58:07
but I might be

Speaker 1  58:10
remember, yeah, the raw material cost is just a manually input a number that I think if I remember correctly, if somebody if we sell a load of a whole truckload of lumber to someone well, it's not as if we sell some wooden doors to someone so that we can just internally calculate what are the material costs that in there so that it takes that out of inventory, right? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  58:39
well yes, through accounting inventory not through I'm not not out of the IMS Yeah

Speaker 1  58:52
Well, I think yeah, that makes sense as far as nailed down this process what we need to do good so accessory sales order accessories will include RG will include two additional fields countless accounts for the way the company visible that's just permissions right the visible and editable

Speaker 1  59:22
in by 543, Word says and then approved checkboxes sales only accessories will include two

Speaker 1  59:39
okay, and the account Okay, that's where we were talking about the account we can write some rules. But

Speaker 1  59:54
now this is this is sale Yeah, accessories. Those are determinate we can't predefined accounts for all of these so we'll just have a manual process and with time build automation to

Speaker 1  1:00:14
build rules automate hopefully 80% of like the build on sites and the more common ones to wear those have the correct account

Matthias Miller  1:00:29
wrecked but will still require approval

Unknown Speaker  1:00:34
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
sales orders for raw materials add a custom field to sales orders

Speaker 1  1:01:08
I that should just work Yeah, good point where you said it doesn't tie into the IMS but it only on the accounting side then when you go to counter physical inventory then it should be it should have applied over there it's really no different than our standard costing where we think we'll use.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Last lost them

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
I'm going to break for a quick minute voice going off. We'll be right back.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:29
really did lose yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:05:39
okay he's doing that we're just gonna go through and

Speaker 2  1:05:57
it's required because we're only doing cruel budget reports by class this is actually deferred let's do a 25 Well actually we should.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:50
If he sent an Email

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11
Well work

Speaker 1  1:10:17
sorry about that I'm not sure what happened but on one link on my site so we were at 4.5 on the very last note there at the bottom I was just asking that where it says default that can't just be a macro that takes the first matching text and that's those that's talking about the rules that we'll write to hopefully catch most of those

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
no right. Okay. Oops

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49
sales order

Unknown Speaker  1:10:56
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
it for accessory accounts correct speed up actual building costing talked about that

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
nothing has changed in that area

Unknown Speaker  1:11:23
thinks

Speaker 1  1:11:25
back to 3554 Well right above that you have a note five one thing to work with think on this that that's nothing that if any discussion right

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
should be manual count impact count

Matthias Miller  1:11:55
I think this is yes but this is waiting on

Speaker 2  1:11:59
Dwayne slash mark word deposit process okay

Unknown Speaker  1:12:16
billing accounting reconciliation

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
manual processes

Speaker 1  1:12:47
what is the 3563 inventory finished goods inventory and raw materials inventory will be entered manually just like it is currently. That's looking at

Speaker 2  1:13:01
entered manually into IMS.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:13
No

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
raw materials

Matthias Miller  1:13:30
I think that should only say raw materials inventory will be entered manually into IMS just like it is currently and I don't think FTBS gi PC has any meaning whatsoever. I think that's what I was intending to communicate. But it's been a minute since I wrote that

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
manual payroll

Unknown Speaker  1:14:01
PATIENT

Speaker 1  1:14:07
Okay, and on 53357 migration, we kind of changed. I kind of changed my thought on how I would do that too. If because of the additional functionality that do in assist where you have effective dates that think we'll end up just going back to probably the first of the year and just once we're comfortable that FDI is is working the way we want it to work with rules and these actual costs and all those things are working then I think providing it To list of our table for Dwayne to say, here's what it was for January, February, March for each builder, each district and use that rather than stamping in our values coming out of our spreadsheet. Okay, I think that's all just just fine, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:23
I think so

Speaker 1  1:15:34
does that change anything on your Android is I mean, we basically, we basically be excluding migration piece of it, because we already have all the buildings tallied in, in assists. When we did this, I hadn't realized that we can go back in time and say, as of this date, I want the material percentage to be this and the billary to be paid is. But now that we have that, I don't think there's, I'll be able to get it more accurate this way, then stamping in my numbers. But of course, have to go back all the way to make sure I get to the very oldest buildings, but do you see a problem with that? With doing it like that?

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
I don't see any problem. I mean, the

Matthias Miller  1:16:35
the only thing we're changing, though, would be okay, so we would be calculating those values, and then the building inventory amount. And we're just changing how the F the finished goods cost auto calculates. If you don't have a stomped in value, is that right? Yes. And just be 100% 100% clear at the new default is going to be just the sum of those three category costs. Yeah. And it would be the is it the it would be the accounting basis which means the FTA if we don't freeze those numbers that the FGI cost could shift if we if this building stays in inventory past the end of the period

Unknown Speaker  1:17:47
is it

Matthias Miller  1:17:49
or is it actual cost if we have it or is it

Speaker 1  1:18:03
from a yield perspective what but it should be as they should be anything built prior to January 1. Three should be the actual cost anything beyond that should be the standard cost because we won't be able to pull this off but my goal is my hope is that we can go back and recreate running transactions to the first of the year and once we have that at that point I'm hopeful that we can then financial since we use but we can change the standard costing to an actual cause all only four buildings spilled here first 23 and later and I guess if we

Speaker 2  1:19:13
let me see historical production report

Unknown Speaker  1:19:29
type Okay, so see

Unknown Speaker  1:19:41
and

Matthias Miller  1:19:45
I'm just taking a look at the records in the system now to see if

Unknown Speaker  1:19:49
there's

Matthias Miller  1:19:51
any ish you we currently have.

Speaker 2  1:19:58
Let's see Let's do and building built date is less than 123.

Matthias Miller  1:20:12
We currently have 550 550 buildings that do not have a frozen

Unknown Speaker  1:20:30
inventory value.

Matthias Miller  1:20:33
Is there any reason why not to?

Matthias Miller  1:20:41
For starters, anything from anything before January 1, is there any reason not to not to just straight up freeze those values?

Speaker 1  1:20:53
Well, the values you're seeing there are incorrect. Because we at the end of last year, we said, Well, how do we value our finished goods inventory? We came up with percentages to use. And we said, well just treat all buildings in inventory. Same. And we did use different percentages than what

Unknown Speaker  1:21:17
but is has currently? If we freeze those, then I mean, we could we could also maybe it would be easier to just migrate our data for all those old buildings and just then freeze them.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:37
Well,

Matthias Miller  1:21:40
I guess my main concern is

Matthias Miller  1:21:48
we're not going to have rules going all the way back to 2019, for example, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:59
So

Matthias Miller  1:22:01
what's what were you thinking? I don't know what we've got actually inventory mean, some of these are canceled, so they probably don't matter. Although, I guess here's, let me frame the problem just a little bit. So on the billing record, we let you stomp in inventory value override. But if you don't have it, then we look up the materials and labor portion of the districts and companies now. Does that if there is no stomped value, are you okay? If historical buildings shift in value? Well, actually, it's not even that. Are you? Okay, if historical buildings do not have any finished goods inventory value?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
If we're unable to calculate that.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:50
Now, it would still calculate Oh,

Speaker 1  1:22:54
well, here's from a, so they have whatever we show on our balance sheet for finished goods inventory. Last year, this year, we'll have to show our of last year we'll have to make sure that it matches that value. So the more I think about it, I think the best as far would be migrate that data, whatever. Migrate finishes, inventory values, that we calculated 1231 22. And then use the new functionality. One 123.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:56
Right,

Matthias Miller  1:23:57
so okay, but here's what we could do. We have a materials value we're calculating right now. And we have a labor. So could we could we, for anything that's auto calculated. Can we just start those numbers in? As the standard cost, add $0 and overhead and use those as the new FDI? Numbers?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:35
You're saying anything built prior to 23?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:38
Yes. Anything built prior to 23?

Speaker 1  1:24:41
No, because the amounts won't. Because it's in our amounts won't won't match to what we use for calculating on our balance sheet. And we have I have those files here that we could we could migrate and there's probably there. Is there anything that's keeping us from Doing that migration with naked doing that migration. Thanks. Like, soon

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
I don't think there's anything keeping us from doing that.

Speaker 1  1:25:14
Okay, so if we do the migration, do we need to do anything to should we do anything to freeze those numbers? Or does that automatically freeze those values doing stomping those in?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:27
Well

Matthias Miller  1:25:31
what will happen is that well, we got you know, we got this is getting super tactical, so forgive me but let's say we import the FDI numbers for all historical buildings. And if we do that, then the if we do that and nothing else, and the finished goods cost is going to stay the same until our next update and then it's going to reflect those new numbers if we want to we could at the same time that we import these FDI numbers we could take the total of that and freeze it as the stored inventory value which would freeze them freeze the that total indefinitely

Speaker 1  1:26:29
All right, thank you lost me there. This was all all 20 buildings built prior to 23 Right

Matthias Miller  1:26:41
so currently, if a building

Speaker 1  1:26:43
actually were essentially what we're wanting to do is is to freeze those numbers indefinitely because we're not we don't have don't have a way of of these those numbers. It's our best estimate on what finished goods inventory value is on those historical buildings. And we have no way of going back into an actual data into accounting records and determining whether it should be more or less so we effectively want to freeze those okay

Matthias Miller  1:27:23
that would be my

Unknown Speaker  1:27:26
proposal or any way to 23

Speaker 1  1:27:33
when we do that migration does dump those numbers in will never do in financial reconciliation that goes back beyond first year anyway when we have well it's so I guess that there never will be a reason to change those numbers but by by migrating it say we made a mistake and we did we said well let's let's also include the last quarter of 22 to do this allocation but it shift those those stumped in numbers increase all of them by 10% or lower than by 10% the actual costs

Unknown Speaker  1:28:26
that we were no because we would

Matthias Miller  1:28:32
need to think through the details but 90 I'm pretty sure that meat well no bottom line is no we allocate actual costs based on a on a specific date range period and we would we wouldn't have anything going going back historically past the beginning of the year. Okay, so my

Unknown Speaker  1:29:00
go ahead Sorry, guys.

Speaker 1  1:29:02
I was just making a note here and saying just kind of talking to myself migrate values for all

Unknown Speaker  1:29:09
buildings

Unknown Speaker  1:29:16
pre 2030.

Matthias Miller  1:29:21
Now this does raise another pretty interesting question in my mind, which is what happens from what happens if you why happens if the stumped in what happens to accounting if the stumped in value? Nothing happens to accounting. If the stumped in value on a building record is different than the FGI breakdown. The FTA breakdown is what's going to show up in accounting. But your finished goods inventory reports might show you a different value.

Speaker 1  1:30:04
Okay, so how could the FBI break down? It? What are the two records that could potentially be different? The FBI break down and the building record?

Matthias Miller  1:30:16
Well, the building record on the building record, currently, we have one override for the finished goods inventory

Unknown Speaker  1:30:25
for the inventory value.

Matthias Miller  1:30:30
So do we need to

Unknown Speaker  1:30:40
we need to keep that

Matthias Miller  1:30:42
unless we can literally change all historical values from all historical buildings, from one inventory value to three, then we need to keep that grand total override around?

Speaker 1  1:31:02
Well, the plan is, when I do the migration, I will provide three values for every building be 23,

Matthias Miller  1:31:14
including ones that have been

Unknown Speaker  1:31:17
sold, not not active inventory.

Speaker 1  1:31:22
ones that have been sold, like in 23, built prior to 23. But But sold in 23, then.

Matthias Miller  1:31:32
Okay, but for once had been sold prior to 23. We're going to need to keep those sets for some buildings, we, for some historical buildings, we have a single frozen inventory value. And we need to keep that value around so that I guess maybe I should ask that do you care? If we lose FDI values for historical? For for buildings that were sold prior to 23?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:07
Would they have no value at all? Or would they?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:16
I would think we would want to keep that that single inventory total for that one building. And then treated same as sum total of the three that were migrating the different values that we're going to be migrating.

Matthias Miller  1:32:39
And so we should just show a warning if you've got an FTDI breakdown and an override, and they don't match.

Speaker 1  1:33:00
Why Why would I'm trying to think why would we have? What would be a case where we would have both?

Matthias Miller  1:33:09
We shouldn't we just need to make sure from a development standpoint

Unknown Speaker  1:33:13
that we did a clean?

Speaker 1  1:33:20
Okay. Could we if that happens, like you said flag it and just do a list of those if if we do have those?

Matthias Miller  1:33:33
Oh, wait, sorry, this is so ridiculously simple. It's not funny. If we have we just changed the priority. So currently, if you have an override that wins else we auto calculate. And instead the logic should be go calculate, go calculate FTI numbers off of the off of the FDI breakdown. And then if there's nothing in the FDI breakdown, go pull it out of the override.

Speaker 1  1:34:08
And the override is what we have currently. Are we do any migration? That's the single value we have in there as of today?

Unknown Speaker  1:34:16
Yes, okay. Yeah. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:20
Good. That makes sense. Well, I think we're pretty much through the FTI portion here. Leaving Good. Well, this has been very helpful, but what's yours? Get? I know we're 30. Now what's your schedule look like for some of these other things? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:34:51
I am I'm planning to work with Nick here this afternoon on knocking out some FTI stuff. And he and I've had some trouble connecting, I'd like to, I'd like to push that forward. So I think I mean, at this point I wonder if we could just shoot for the 31st and pick this up again and dig into phase one, B, phase two and three and, and just work our way through that.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:33
Okay, the acid asset management, is that something that you helpful for you to have before then? Should I just can we can we wait for that till the 31st as well? Yeah, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:35:48
fine. fine with that? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:52
yeah, I don't. Yep. Yeah. That's good.

Speaker 1  1:35:57
Good. Well, we'll plan on that, and pick back up the 31st. And I do, I did put a note here, number seven that I think is worth mentioning is, it's been on the call or not. Yeah. I've been a month, just want to give you a heads up to see. Now, this is kind of short notice if this works for you, but testing using accounting. So our plan is to start this Wednesday, May the 24th. Society to work with Ben on initial training for this? And I don't know how much, if anything, we'll probably Yeah, we'll do some of it the 24th. But So Drew Yoder, an employee of Arrow services will be the one doing accounting plans offered him or out of the inside Office every Wednesday. So just like, you know, we don't have with with knowledge of limitations that we have, here, based on how the owners wish to have that, and how that you know, what makes sense for them. We don't have obviously don't have this on our in our offices, but it's possible to have someone like studio to Guy local guy come in. And he's going to be doing work working out of here. The plan is a day per week, starting out, you know, the main reason for having him here so that human aid can communicate, I can see what he's working on, see what he's doing it the processes in the system working correctly, so that he can then work on outside of that. Wednesdays, he's probably going to be rich, and he's he'll be doing accounting, working out of his home as well, for us between those times. I mean, but that's kind of the the thought there but initially just be a lot of testing. And

Unknown Speaker  1:38:25
so

Speaker 1  1:38:27
if a long winded how does that how does that look for you? As far as availability, I imagine there's going to be all kinds of questions he's used to working with. The only thing he's really familiar with is QuickBooks. But from an accounting perspective, I would say he has a good grasp of of what accounting needs to work. Yeah, how does this look? How does your schedule look for maybe walk him through some of the basics, answer some questions and

Speaker 3  1:39:11
yeah. My schedule Wednesdays are usually fairly open. Yeah, typically these Yeah, I I FR car calls are pretty much the main thing that on my schedule for Wednesdays anyway. So yeah, even like the 24th year The only thing I have scheduled is in a call from nine to 10. Eastern. So, yeah, whether we start with just this coming Wednesday, and then kind of as needed throughout or whether we want to schedule something every Wednesday. Yeah, I'm really fine with with whatever works best on yours. And yeah, well Wednesdays are very open for me

Unknown Speaker  1:40:03
pretty much all the time. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:05
Well, let's plan to let's plan for the 24th at one o'clock and then see how that goes. And then kind of plan from there? Sure.

Speaker 1  1:40:20
Now, do you have access to you have access to the live? Well, I guess question for you, Matthias, should should he start? But it'd be best for us to start into in the test system before we start doing things in in life system

Matthias Miller  1:40:41
probably be my

Unknown Speaker  1:40:43
preference. Because? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:40:56
well, I guess it depends on which what you guys are wanting to do.

Speaker 1  1:41:00
So the first thing that they just want to see how the accounting system works. Get a feel for it, see if you have an understanding of where it is, as far as development, like I said, their QuickBooks is the only thing he's ever done any work in, and they're just, they're a little nervous working with the new accounting system. And they're just the first thing is just, you know, how the debits and credits work? How does you know? How do you do? normal run of the mill stuff in the accounting? So if the test system has all the same features, and everything that live system, Dustin, I don't? We should start there.

Matthias Miller  1:41:53
Yeah, I think I would vote for that. And Ben can update to the latest. I'm not sure exactly what version it is. But you guys can get actually get newer features and what is in live as well, if you went to the bin can update to the latest latest version before the end.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:16
Make sure it's caught up. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:25
Well,

Speaker 1  1:42:26
I'm not quite sure. I'm trying to figure out Matthias, what's your advice on? If we start with a test system? It probably still be good if Dwayne were involved on that as well? Or do you think better off to just initially just do Ben and Andrew on the basics on the accounting system? I'm happy to have Dwayne, if it's helpful, if not, I don't want to waste his time.

Matthias Miller  1:42:59
I kind of feel like that's a call he's gonna have to make. I feel like you know, I could go either way, on one hand, he might give some useful perspective. And on the other hand, I mean, if it's, I think if the value is the, you know, maybe have some useful perspective, that could be helpful, then it might be good to have him on. But if it's for training him and getting him on board, there's probably not that much that he wouldn't be able to figure out on his own as well, just off to the actual, so maybe more call for him than for me, I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:39
don't really have a good sense.

Speaker 1  1:43:44
And then so as far as getting it set up in the test system, is that permissions and all that bad? Is that something that could if I if I provide you with his email address, could you get him set up? For Wednesday, I guess tomorrow or Wednesday for noon, send him the details, login and all that whatever he needs to get into the test system.

Speaker 2  1:44:12
Alright, thanks guys could check and see

Speaker 3  1:44:17
Yes, I can add users. So yeah, if you would get me Yeah, his email address.

Speaker 2  1:44:26
I could, I could get him into the test system.

Speaker 1  1:44:32
And then once we go into the live system, then obviously we involve to give him permissions to to get in there. Good, I'll send you that I'll send you his email address. copy him as well. And then I'll get with ya. I'll I'll check with Dwayne if he wants to be on the call Wednesday. And I think he's the plan is he's going to be around till probably 334 o'clock but I Don't expect us to be usually going through that maybe just a little now and then I imagine maybe an hour, hour and a half initial and then available for some questions on and off throughout the afternoon. And then we'll just see how that goes and go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:24
Yeah, sounds good. Good.

Speaker 1  1:45:29
Well, good, excited for that. Anything to unify us or been? Right, before we wrap this up?

Matthias Miller  1:45:42
I don't think I've got anything on this. I'm I'm excited to Well, I'm excited about two things. One, wrapping your head around these loose ends and getting a clearer project plan together for the remainder of the part and excited about you being able to to get more hands on with the system as well.
