Speaker 1  22:43
Hey, here hear me. I can hear you,

Unknown Speaker  22:54
right.

Unknown Speaker  23:00
Let me sorry.

Unknown Speaker  23:07
What's that? Sorry?

Matthias Miller  23:11
All right, let me

Speaker 2  23:17
good. Let me, let me not. I'll get out of that once. I don't know what this is about,

Unknown Speaker  23:24
all right, so cameras used

Unknown Speaker  23:27
by other apps.

Matthias Miller  23:31
I'm seeing you, but I don't know

Unknown Speaker  23:35
somewhere happened here?

Unknown Speaker  23:52
Still there. Yep, I'm still here. I think I'm good. Okay, my audio is not, uh, Bluetooth audio is not working, but I'm not. I don't know. Might not it was correct, but I hopefully will have enough up able to understand each other for sure.

Matthias Miller  24:26
Sorry, I can I can hear you, fine. Can you hear me?

Unknown Speaker  24:29
Yeah, sorry, um, yeah, so,

Matthias Miller  24:41
so my thought was maybe we should go through this thing here and see first, first, go through some of these numbers for these connected items. And. Make sure that, like the iron shock 192,

Matthias Miller  25:13
and make sure that we believe in all these numbers. So this one, I think I actually went eight, five. Okay, so there's a couple things or one thing I changed. I added a show work order detail to the analysis report. So

Speaker 2  25:35
I am catching up, actually here on a stitch of, yeah, sorry. Little homework on my side. I'm not much here. Okay, you did see 815 today. Hold, my goodness, my mom's 76 this week. Oh, wow. How's your parents good? Or you had no you had a funeral?

Matthias Miller  26:02
Yeah, my dad passed away in March, and my mom had a knee replacement, and she's getting ready to hop on a plane next month and fly to fly to Ohio. So, alright, she's, she's definitely, yeah, she's definitely not sitting around man, which is good.

Speaker 2  26:24
Well, yeah, it's just you never know what's going to be neat, what they're going to need as they age, and all that you know just don't know. So I know, oh, I hope my parents are able to go strong for at least a few more years, until my three to five year projects done here. Don't tell me, but don't tell me why I said that.

Matthias Miller  26:51
We'll keep it right here,

Speaker 2  26:53
man, bro, hey, we're getting there. That was good today. I was,

Matthias Miller  26:57
I feel, I feel really good.

Speaker 2  26:59
Shoot, we had it just, it just turned out to be a good dialog for him and I prior to in our meeting with you. So actually probably allows, like a four, I think we were together for almost two hours before we talked to you. So Wow. And it was just good. Good. Nothing else was interrupting. You know, he's and I said to him, like, you're gonna have to, I said, we're gonna get it, like, we're gonna get this stuff because we're working through it. And then, anyway, then he said, and I said, you're gonna have to, like, do, like, perfect entries too. He's like, Yeah, I know. He's like, I might. He said, I can't do that. He's like, I make mistakes. And I'm like, Yeah, you can. I'm like, you can, you know, you whatever. It was, just good back and forth. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:55
I don't know how you read it. He, he felt a lot more bought in today than he ever has been.

Speaker 2  28:01
Yeah, yeah, I feel like, yeah, yep, and burgundy and go,

Matthias Miller  28:10
let's go, if that's what it takes. Touchdown. That's hilarious. That is hilarious.

Unknown Speaker  28:22
I By the way, I'm sorry, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  28:25
Also an update. I'm pretty close to getting these heat treated items done too. I cross your fingers. I don't know. I have some other projects I should be chasing as soon as we're done here, but should be have have those working early next week.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
Sorry, what remind, give me a little more context, so I forget putting

Matthias Miller  28:45
putting wave 20 and wave 20 HD on the same order, yeah.

Speaker 2  28:52
But what if, sure that's fine, right? But if you right, but, but if, like today, okay, like today. When we did, we did those the two items, it was the eight and the six. It was the exact same item ID, but it was two different orders. When we did that entry, it was that one we looked at, actually, it's, is it the one you're you have open there. That's it. We have no, there was one, the one, oh, wait, it might be. Was this 14? The one you have open, how many

Matthias Miller  29:28
this one was? This is, this is 30.

Speaker 2  29:32
Was the one from fire? There was one prior to this at the same item, um,

Matthias Miller  29:44
this, these guys,

Speaker 2  29:45
yeah, the 14, so that's where there was an order of six, if you go to his entry window, where, where he entered the data for the for the 14? Yep, you know. We'll see it there. Um, yeah, see what I mean. So get so can it do that with heat treat and non heat treat?

Matthias Miller  30:09
Yeah, we'll start showing the heat treat, non heat treat in this list. What I'm saying,

Speaker 2  30:12
like, it'll, it'll assign eight to the one and six to the other. Yes. Okay, got it. But that's just already what you were doing that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:23
okay, pretty, pretty close. I mean, we're, it's pretty close to working, but not quite, yeah, yeah, all right, so if we just do, I'm going to dial. I just want to do the eight. I just want to do this iron, chalk, one, just so we got something simple. So assembly hours, so when you, when you click on the analysis report, I have a show work order detail so that you can, if you, if you wonder why something's going the way it is, you can drill in and get some more insight.

Unknown Speaker  30:58
Yeah, okay, so, so

Speaker 2  31:00
show, can you show me that again? That? Sorry, I didn't. I missed the Yeah, where's it at? Okay, show, work order, detail.

Matthias Miller  31:06
So if you don't show it, it'll just show the total rows, alright, if you do show it, it'll show all of the information that goes into that. So, yeah, here we have,

Speaker 2  31:19
but it doesn't show the guy, the name of the individual, right?

Matthias Miller  31:23
No, we could add the name if you want.

Unknown Speaker  31:27
I mean,

Matthias Miller  31:31
what are your thoughts? It doesn't matter. Whatever is helpful to you.

Speaker 2  31:39
I think a name, probably name is better. I mean, I need a name on there, yep. So

Matthias Miller  31:50
let's do and let's only show this if we're showing let's also move the date over. Date will show up when you're showing detail, we'll show the name

Unknown Speaker  32:05
here. Let's do

Matthias Miller  32:10
All right, so then all right. So we have so now we see here, we take the total time, 150 511. 55 we take the setup time, we take the downtime out, and that gives us point eight, three for this day. And then here there's a there's a break time, there's some setup time. And this is 1.58 for a total hours of 4.83 for this job. Okay, we had on the total board feet we took 30 times. Let's just double check this on the item. Board feet of the item is 31 times 30 is about 900 rounding differences. That's, I mean, it's 31.4 times 30,

Unknown Speaker  33:11
which is

Matthias Miller  33:15
takes us to nine, 942, ish rounding difference, quantity of 30, this many hand fasteners, this many parts on the score column. I had a question on this isn't the score? Is the score, the item score times the quantity?

Matthias Miller  33:43
If, if one pallet is a score of 10, and you do 20 pallets, should that be a score of 200 Yeah. Okay. So then here's the down here we can see the score. The item score is 13.54 the total score is 406, 30, which is what we see here, and then the contribution percentage here. Here, let's move the contribution percentage as well. Let's move that over.

Speaker 2  34:15
Can you also move the move the quantity ahead of the of the board. Fee, yeah, actually, Iron Hill, we don't have an item. We don't have an ID in there. Do we like? Where am I seeing? The item itself isn't,

Matthias Miller  34:40
oh, we aren't showing the item. We should show the item employee. We can show it right?

Speaker 2  34:47
I date, date, then item, then quantity, or date, quantity, item, date.

Matthias Miller  35:00
What about Okay? Let's do this contribution percentage does not make sense in the summary report, because there's other ways to grab that

Speaker 2  35:14
date, okay, or date, then item, then quantity one or the other, date,

Matthias Miller  35:18
item, quantity and then employee and out.

Unknown Speaker  35:28
And then, what So, employee, date,

Matthias Miller  35:33
item, quantity, hours, contribution, percentage, yeah, okay, so then let's save this. Let's run it all right. So then when we all right. So the total score, so the contribution percentage, let me double check my math, but it should be point eight, three divided by 4.83

Unknown Speaker  35:58
that's not a contribution percentage isn't coming out like I would expect.

Speaker 2  36:07
Sure about that? No, yeah,

Matthias Miller  36:11
we're using I was going to ask about this. Are we using total time, or we're using assembly time for contribution? Should be using assembly time? Shouldn't we? I

Speaker 2  36:20
Right? Not total, right? Um, man like, um, the setup time. The setup time should be in there. I'm

Matthias Miller  36:42
so you want set up time but not breaks.

Speaker 2  36:45
Set up time but not breaks, and not downtime. SO, SO to SO what we're saying? What? Okay, so then, no, that's okay. Sorry, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  36:59
Total time. This is time minus breaks, minus setup minus downtime. That's what the assembly time. That is the assembly time. Okay, assembly time does include, no, no, that's not what you want. Minus breaks, minus downtime, but you want set up time included.

Speaker 2  37:22
Hey, Matt, once Absolutely. Um, so there's a he had a water running around under the road, and there's something across that first little meadow. It's in the big meadow next to shed. There's a bowl there. There should be water there. That's it. And said, check it later. But anyway, I should check again, but I need to. That's what he was okay, so that that worked for. That's what he was thinking, Yeah, can I can we flush that a little bit you're thinking, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  38:10
Up there was a tub down there was a nice tub down there, but the ball, there's a green one, yeah, I just I knew your side, man, and bring the phone and to find out that, as I talked to them, like, yeah, figure it out. Is it drained now or draining? Hopefully, yeah, fish jumping. Yeah. I did alright. Otherwise, otherwise, things are, yeah, okay, but good, same, right? And raise surgery to this. I'm not sure what my schedule will be, but okay. But hey, this is good. Yeah, good. Process, progress, Matt, sorry with you, but

Speaker 1  39:02
no worries. Yep, okay, so we need

Matthias Miller  39:15
so then this one Is

Unknown Speaker  39:20
recorder assembly times.

Matthias Miller  39:37
It would almost be easier, okay?

Unknown Speaker  39:44
Yeah, we're gonna need to do this. Gina,

Speaker 2  39:57
oh, in my heart, nested. To take some home or whatever. Yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll get that. Yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  40:09
Okay, so let me, let me, okay. We're gonna have to change some of these calculations, because some of these calculations just are straight up wrong. So the assembly

Unknown Speaker  40:20
time

Matthias Miller  40:22
is the time spent working minus downtime, so it includes assembly time, right?

Unknown Speaker  40:37
Yes,

Speaker 2  40:39
and time spent working plus setup time, because setup time is part of the process, part of the cost, and right or wrong. At this point, I'm viewing downtime and break time as company time. I don't know if that's not it's not entirely the right way to do that, because we have an hour break, half hour lunch time is off the clock. The other 215 minute breaks are on the clock. I do you have any thoughts about that? I

Matthias Miller  41:25
well, I mean, either way, they're not working during that time, whether they're paid or not, I would view break time as overhead, right? Non direct labor, whatever you call it. So it's not, I mean, it seems, seems same to me. Total time, all work orders. Okay, total,

Matthias Miller  41:55
okay, so then contribution, we have assembly time, okay, work order, total time, I'll work total

Speaker 1  42:05
total time. So this should be assembly time or total assembly time,

Matthias Miller  42:17
and then we have work order.

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Okay,

Matthias Miller  42:27
and then total time for All work orders.

Unknown Speaker  42:38
We have a

Unknown Speaker  43:02
say Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:38
the i at the item we Got, the

Speaker 1  43:58
quantity. We got the one. Yeah, so.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
There's assembly time hours,

Unknown Speaker  46:38
As the assembly Time is,

Unknown Speaker  46:50
I'm all right, let's See we got it now. I'm

Unknown Speaker  48:03
okay, so we have

Unknown Speaker  48:03
bro, applause. Okay, so we have contribution percentage is completely messed up. Okay, so we have 1.28 assembly hours. So we have about 5.8 Assembly hours, contribution percentage you I'll Be right back. Alright, Hey, Bonnie, you all right,

Matthias Miller  52:11
yep, all right. So here's what we got. We got so assembly time now. So assembly time now changed as we discussed, fixed, I fixed the contribution percentages, so now they had some downtime on this one. This one, they didn't have any downtime, so it's just the total time. And so here, if we take 1.08 divided by 5.83 we get 18.5

Unknown Speaker  52:42
Yeah. Five 7%

Matthias Miller  52:46
board feed adds up all these total scores. Add up score per hour is going to be the same because, well, it's distributed across. It's a single job, so going to be the same score is times quantity. So theoretically, we got reporting, that's right. And then if you want to, we can, I mean, now we can start playing around then. So if you had a When was your last pay period?

Speaker 2  53:26
Um, it was this ended, ended on Thursday. Ended on Thursday.

Matthias Miller  53:30
So it'd be

Unknown Speaker  53:33
the first through the 14th.

Unknown Speaker  53:38
First now, um, first to 13

Matthias Miller  53:43
ended on Thursday was the new day, so it'd be the 31st to the 13th.

Unknown Speaker  53:47
31st to 13th. That's right.

Matthias Miller  53:51
So we're gonna group. It's grouped by, yeah, yeah, yep, some like, something like this, yep. Hang on. We got, I gotta let me make a few changes here. These should not be showing up.

Unknown Speaker  54:08
This guy, this guy, this guy,

Matthias Miller  54:12
and contribution percentage,

Unknown Speaker  54:16
I don't know. We'll I'm

Unknown Speaker  54:24
I just mix that, okay, so, and let's make this get wider.

Matthias Miller  54:33
All right? So,

Matthias Miller  54:43
I mean, I have no idea, do these numbers look

Speaker 2  54:49
so? Okay, looking here score per hour. My the scoring system is, i.

Matthias Miller  55:00
We gotta take, Sorry, gotta take a look at that. Can we start by looking at the assembly hours? Is that about the right number of hours for assembly hours for pay period?

Speaker 2  55:14
So, yeah, yeah. I mean, because we're taking out breaks, without breaks, it's eight and a half hours without setup times. Gosh, what? It set up?

Matthias Miller  55:29
No, this includes setup times.

Speaker 2  55:31
Oh, yeah, sorry. So it's breaks and downtime.

Matthias Miller  55:35
It's an average of 45 hours across 19 employees.

Speaker 2  55:41
Well, it's eight point without breaks. It's 8.5 times 10, um, 85 and then it's eight. So it's 85 per employee minus downtime. I'm seeing like and look, these guys aren't here. Every seems a little bit low. But here's the thing I'm at, everything's probably not entered for the I don't know. I don't know if everything,

Matthias Miller  56:08
oh, well, some of the errors could be like, if somewhere linked, right? Yeah, maybe it's not showing

Speaker 2  56:15
number. There was, what, 75 so you mean, he's close. He works every day. His partner's Osmond, 71 I like how you, you stack this by hours. I kind of like that.

Matthias Miller  56:30
You can, you can sort that. I mean, that's a good, pretty good. Here's, here's a really, I mean, if you could sit down with Rick and look at percentage of time spent in in assembly. Yeah, you could find the guys who are, I mean, it probably depends on their responsibilities. If they've got other responsibilities if they've got other responsibilities or stuff. But it'd be interesting to know what percentage the assembly time hours is, what percentage of their total clocked in hours? That would be an interesting question, total payroll hours, right?

Speaker 2  57:19
Yeah, for sure, absolutely, um, it just shows Yeah. It shows them being well, or or Matt, like, yeah, that that, but also like downtime, with the like, their total downtime.

Matthias Miller  57:42
And we could, yeah, we could put in, we could put in a total down to a downtime column.

Speaker 2  57:50
Yeah, I think we probably should. And then if we see a trend there,

Matthias Miller  57:57
that's that is interesting. It's all about breadcrumbs. Man,

Speaker 2  58:03
this is where we so. Just okay, I'm thinking about, thinking about,

Unknown Speaker  58:22
Yep, yeah, you're

Matthias Miller  58:23
good. The downtime should be times.

Matthias Miller  58:33
Well, sure it's man hours. Just keep that in mind.

Unknown Speaker  58:53
All right, good one. Oh, call.

Matthias Miller  59:04
So here we're showing 11 hours of downtime. Guys, most affected.

Unknown Speaker  59:21
So

Speaker 2  59:24
yeah, well, the name on top of the list, that's not a surprise. Oh, he can only, um, that's not a surprise. Ah, wow. So, Matt, the score, yeah, the score thing is, it's, it needs, it needs some serious help, um, but looking at, I just looking at this here, like, um, well, so, so here's, here's what's. Uh, kind of a big relief, but it's, it's not, it's not like, it's not the end, end of the process, but like, we only need to, we, we need the total actually, what we need is we need to now see the total value in dollars of the sage, like the same. That's the only thing that I really need. How many dollars did the guy? So I need that also. So we need this, like, yeah, comes to like that, that window where you show their contribution in, so the percentage of the quantity that's allotted, plus the value of that to each guy, and then the total for all the guys that's is really what I'm going to go by.

Matthias Miller  1:01:17
Okay, so for that value, this is getting very persnickety and in the weeds, and so I apologize in advance. But for the for the value, can we just go on the sage order or the item and pull the latest price from Sage? Reason being, when you group heat treated items together, or do you do you want to use the value from the from the sales order, like when you group heat treated and non heat treated together? Which way do you want to do it?

Speaker 2  1:01:54
So I'm not so yes, but like, the heat treated item is priced a little higher, right, right. Um, are you would it catch? But, like, Would I catch it when it's heat treated? Will it catch that value when it's not heated treated and catch the other value?

Matthias Miller  1:02:15
Yeah, we could grab. We would grab. Here's, yeah, here's what we would do is very simple. So we have the quantity, now we have the work okay, work order, Sage order, num, ID, ID, num.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:32
Sage wrote.

Matthias Miller  1:02:34
So we on the then we work order, Sage order, quantity, assembled, times. Sage order by,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:46
yes, the latest, the latest price in sage.

Matthias Miller  1:02:49
Well, we can, we can literally pull it off the sales order, and then if there is no sales order, we'll grab it off the latest, we'll grab the latest price to get the closest value.

Speaker 2  1:02:58
Yep, I think that. I think that, um, that latest, well, maybe we just talked about it. We're not using the price anywhere, per se. Oh, let's just talk. But Stephen had it in anyway. It came on a report. And the reason we wanted on that report was for this rate. Was this reason right here? Yeah, I think, yeah, that's what it was. It was all intended for this purpose.

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
Yeah, we're showing it on here, off the latest, uh, let's see item price. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:03:37
it's, I mean, it's being pulled on that crystal, or one of the crystal, or, I don't know, the last thing that Rick did, I don't even know. I know he did a Crystal report for the Excel program. What he What did? How would you describe what he did for this?

Matthias Miller  1:03:53
I mean, it's a SQL, SQL export, really. But

Speaker 2  1:03:58
equal export, yeah. So the other wasn't for some of course, the SQL export

Matthias Miller  1:04:02
something like that. Okay, all right, so we have the quantity assembled times the the order price. If it's tied to an order else, we just look up the latest item price that we got. So theoretically, then, oh, times the contribution factor. All right, so then this is the dollar amount, and then we should sum that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:32
total type sum,

Matthias Miller  1:04:35
and then that should be two decimals with a comma and write a line. Thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
Why hang on two decimals. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:04:55
does that? Yeah, so then we could also do $1 Per hour,

Speaker 2  1:05:02
yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so not, yeah. So this, well, this is about, this is a, this is a side, a little bit off the side, but, um, we, we added the dollar amount. That's right, that's right, that's right. We're using it in the score calculator window in order to help dial in the scoring formula.

Matthias Miller  1:05:35
We have the cost of fasters. Well, I think we need to. I mean, the scoring formula is just completely bunk right now. I think,

Speaker 2  1:05:43
yeah, there's some probably, yeah, it needs help. Yeah, it needs help. But we can look at we need to look at it. But I guess I'm saying, do we need because somewhere it needs to be next to the score. In other words, the score and the dollar value should be, you know, fairly close.

Matthias Miller  1:06:08
Sure. All right, let me, let me, uh,

Speaker 2  1:06:14
gosh, we're gonna, we're gonna solve everything if we're not careful here.

Matthias Miller  1:06:18
I mean, that's the goal. That's the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
goal. If we solve everything, oh, it can always Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:06:29
look at let's see if this looks right. So there should also be two decimals with commas.

Speaker 1  1:06:35
Why did you mix my decimals and commas and right aligned? I All right.

Matthias Miller  1:06:49
Does this look like the right? I mean, are we ballparking the right?

Speaker 2  1:06:54
Okay, yeah. So, no, so here, so, like, I guess, yeah. So, well, if you want to, no, I'm just thinking like they almost, you almost thought to show the guy's name again here to the right of this, of by the score, like, in other words, show it on both ends, maybe, or every other name is a different color.

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
Just, let's do every other name is a different color. Let's, I'm

Speaker 2  1:07:25
and then, and then, and then, show the name, if it's simple enough, show the name in the next column to the right, again, show the name again

Matthias Miller  1:07:34
at the very end. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
actually, let's just do this. We could do this

Unknown Speaker  1:07:51
right there. Okay, why are you not?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01
I'll be right back. Yep, correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:53
I should be there. I.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
I don't know. I'm having a little trouble with the employee thing. There's got to be a better way to do this.

Speaker 2  1:10:15
Okay, so, dude, yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to,

Matthias Miller  1:10:19
well, there's probably a simpler way to do it and and, okay, we can solve it later.

Speaker 2  1:10:24
So the question, yeah, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:10:29
Well, so, I mean, it seems to me like this is an, I mean, so theoretically, there are people, there are other reasons why things might be more expensive. But here's interesting.

Speaker 2  1:10:43
This is with dollars per hour. That's real like, that's real hard, fast dollars. What it Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:11:03
yeah, this one's not the total in the dollars per hour is not quite right. This should be calm.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
Wait is that

Speaker 1  1:11:31
total should be divided by the assembly out it's still not looking right.

Matthias Miller  1:11:43
390 Yeah, maybe yeah, it is. That's right. Now, okay, now that's right. Well, let me, let me just, I just want to worker dollars divided by the assembly time. So here we have four, three. I mean, this is almost unnecessary, but 914, divided by 63.75, comes out to 688, and then here we have total of 341, divided by 873, 390, yeah, I think that's, I think that's

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
right. So quantity.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:32
So the guys at the top are the machine operators. Um, they're producing more dollar value, which is but that doesn't mean they're producing more profit, right? But there is the top three guys are on the one machine, the next three guys are on the other machine. It's

Speaker 2  1:13:16
just interesting. There's still some like, common like, like, if they all work together, why is one guy lower? You know what I mean. So it's like Barry and Mickey worked more than Alejandro. So that means when somebody took alejandro's place, they were probably more productive because they got the same they got the same dollars per hour when they were all three working together. But somehow, when they weren't working with Alejandro, they got more dollars per hour.

Matthias Miller  1:13:52
Because, well, right, if we want, if we want to, you can break this down by team and then by employee.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04
Right, right?

Matthias Miller  1:14:06
And so you said, Alejandro. Well, these are sorted by name. This might not be the easiest way to find. Well, let's do then, team match. Who's the who's one of the steady guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
Steve real

Matthias Miller  1:14:29
and he would work with, or who's who would have been one of the guys working with Alejandro,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
Mickey Mickey.

Matthias Miller  1:14:38
So we, if we look for any, anything Mickey was doing. So here is the Alejandro ones.

Speaker 2  1:14:48
Yeah, 559 jeez, one hour 128 then they had Lee. By Mickey Barry. They crushed it for 2020, hours. They crushed it. That was their best output. Yeah, it makes sense. And then, yep, that's how it works. That's interesting. So if we go back back to that page with everybody, just the name right there. So if I go down to go down to Osmond is the first guy in hand, and him and Austin are a team. They did really good. Brian Thompson has no business being in that picture, but that fab. Wow, that's crazy. But then I got their hand Osmond and Austin, they're by far the best hand producers, Stephen Julio Yani and Simon, Benjamin Hira Ola cow, that's, that is, that is, man.

Matthias Miller  1:16:12
I mean, if you just compare, there's a 2x difference between Osmond and Austin and Benjamin.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19
Benjamin, Benjamin and Jairo are partners,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:23
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:29
wow,

Matthias Miller  1:16:32
and we're How confident are you? This is just playing for snickety devil's advocate. How confident are you that Benjamin and Jairo aren't just working on really badly priced product.

Speaker 2  1:16:49
I'm not, because I haven't personally dissected all that. Yeah, and when I did dissect, um, I found, like, we've made some pretty serious, significant adjustments. Yeah, to the point, you know, wow, ouch, ouch. So that's where this down down. Now we go back to scoring or cost calculator. See that cost calculator was a a true effort, an effort to show the true 100% here's our cost right, cost per item. That was the that was the goal with that, and the way that, I mean, we had to, we had to do time entries.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
Mm,

Speaker 2  1:18:06
well, I'm not gonna go. Okay, here's the thing, Matt, we're not gonna go, oh man, sorry. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta something here. Hang on. Hang on. A

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
second, yep, yep, yep, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:23
can you see me? Yeah, you can see me. I can see you.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:46
Who? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:51
that was your answer.

Matthias Miller  1:18:52
No. I mean, I don't know. Wait, that middle letter is that, am I reading it right? Who? Who's in you might have to who's in that seat.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
Ah, okay, the answer is no,

Matthias Miller  1:19:27
yeah, build a plan, but, but that requires a further conversation sometime when I mean beyond the scope of I don't know what

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
do you know?

Matthias Miller  1:19:49
How few companies actually get access to this kind of I mean, am I wrong? How few access companies get access to this level of data? Do.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Uh, probably right.

Matthias Miller  1:20:04
I don't think it's a lot, but maybe I'm wrong,

Speaker 2  1:20:10
but this is it. I mean, here we go. So I'm gonna hang on, give me I'm writing something.

Matthias Miller  1:20:14
All right, yeah, I got time. Um, we take your time.

Speaker 2  1:20:52
I mean, if we solve the cost, if we thank you for your health, solve our cost per item, right? Per item? I mean, then I have a price, then I'm then I have pricing,

Matthias Miller  1:21:12
yes, so, and that's very simple, it's, what is the, what's the material cost?

Speaker 2  1:21:18
I know, I just didn't feel like opening going that so, so right now I need,

Matthias Miller  1:21:27
that means we actually do need the cost calculator. Don't, don't

Speaker 2  1:21:30
we, yeah, for sure, to finish that process. And we have, and, like, I want to, like, before December, you know, I mean, so, like, I'm not going to capture, but at Christmas time, I can at least look back and I can reward those gentlemen who have gone above and beyond, which we've done the last two years, but we've not done it with hard fast data this year, hard fast data.

Matthias Miller  1:22:00
So that just makes me happy, right there. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:07
so,

Speaker 2  1:22:34
oh, man, I don't want to say what I'm thinking right now, but forgive me. Man, back. On. I should get out of this. We, we are, yeah, when you see we're assigning dollars like, Okay, we know the price of an item. We know how many are produced every day, and we're still cleaning up the the tracker stuff, because entries weren't some stuff that he's cleaning up. 504 a top dollar contribution, 504, B second. So the A's per those guys are getting more, more value out of their time than those guys are. Yeah and handler, Osmond and Austin are ahead of everybody, way ahead of the pack. Tyrone Benjamin are halfway, Half. Half? Are they? Bomb, iron Benjamin, yeah, that

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45
would surprise me

Speaker 2  1:23:49
just watching like, I mean the pricing one, like New Holland, monsters and things like that, versus, like, fabric collars, ironhill chop tall. We're not like, do you feel like the is the I mean, you're watching the pricing we're using. You're using the same formulas for, yes, everything, right? Yes. So just because they're doing collars and they're doing monsters, they should be able to produce more, yeah, and make the same produce the same value. So we just keep dissecting. I'm I'm really excited right now about what you're seeing. I'm, I temper my enthusiasm, except every once in a while, yeah, you know, because it's not done yet. Oh, I know it's a long road hidden in the road. Absolutely, we're just gonna Alright, yeah, I should be. If not, I'm. Pop. It's right back there. Where's that? Yup, actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:04
I'm slow fan. Okay, stupid, you go ahead. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:25:09
thanks. Oh, Matt, yeah, there. Sorry, yeah. Rick was just wondering if I want to hand out the paychecks, he's going to do it. Um, right, yeah, no, we're this is great, man. I'm serious, this is awesome. What's your time look like?

Matthias Miller  1:25:28
I mean, I got I got a I got time.

Speaker 2  1:25:35
So we're sorry. Where were we? So now one other

Matthias Miller  1:25:39
question on this analysis. Sorry, we're getting persnickety. Wouldn't it be good to know, well, without knowing more of your labor calculations, I mean, if, if you have, you don't have widely variable material costs relative to labor cost to you?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:04
Nope, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:26:11
By the way, I got heat treated items working while you were talking to finish up, that's beautiful. Look at this.

Speaker 2  1:26:18
Yeah, boom, boom, let's freaking go.

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
So you'll have to once, once the update is live, go in on the like the wave 20, yeah, and set the heat treated item to wave 20 ht, and then when you pull up the wave 20 ht, it'll show the short link back.

Speaker 2  1:26:36
It's under the same sales order number, right? So it's still spread out the contribution. Yes, is that? Is that console? Sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:26:49
Currently, when you run the reports, it'll if we really want to break down heat treated versus non heat treated, we're going to have to do a per item contribution, which is going to get a little bit tricky. Currently, if you mix and match them, in some ways it would be easiest. I don't know if you want to do this. In some ways it'd be easiest is anytime you do an HT

Unknown Speaker  1:27:20
report.

Matthias Miller  1:27:23
Or that we on the tracker, you put the, I don't even know, on the analysis. It gets a little tricky right now, the analysis is just running based off of what, what is on the work order, or what the what the main item is on the work order. So if you, if you put in Wave 20, all of, all of these will get, Oh, that's right, I needed to fix it. It is not done. Okay. Anyway, I don't want to go down that rat hole. Let's, let's, let's figure that out. Unless you've got, I guess, what do you want to get done? Done today yet? Let's ask back so

Speaker 2  1:28:12
I know I have to shift gears and take care of a couple other things. So let's hop off of here. Um, sorry, I'm I'm blanking on the next I know I want to go. I know we need it. We need to cost calculator to work. But, but, and that's okay. Okay, let me quick overview. So right now, here's where we're at with in house so we have accurate data once John's stuff is cleaned up, dollars assembled or produced? Well, the production is a process that starts installing, and we're not able to capture real time with that, but we know real time of items that get completed each day and the value of those, so we have the value of production completed each day or each pay period, and that's what we need to run a company wide incentive program. Yep, it's not perfect, but that's the start. It's a great real time starter. That's That's what I need right now in order to and I need that report to somehow share it with Rick. He mirrors it with payroll, and he runs, and he runs a our original, our first incentive program post 21st Century. Alright. Right? And then after that, it's going back to, it's going back to, thank you sir, it's going back to the cost calculation. Well, the scoring window was an boy, see, score was really kind of a man. It's kind of a quick, kind of a shortcut at the value of something where the cost cap, if we figure out all our costs, that's better than a score, right? He

Matthias Miller  1:30:56
Well, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:00
well, I mean, if

Matthias Miller  1:31:01
you, if you reverse engineer, if you can reverse engineer, approximately what your anticipated labor cost is, then that is the baseline, that is some form of a baseline for how you want the guys to perform. Or is that now what you're,

Speaker 2  1:31:21
sorry, I'm not sure. I think we're gonna have to revisit this conversation, right?

Matthias Miller  1:31:32
Yeah, let's, I mean, I feel like, let's get the, let me get the let me get the heat treated stuff wrapped up today. Yeah, whenever you got some, I really feel like we're in a good, good the big things that are left the Excel spreadsheet to get all the back stuff done, John T getting all his stuff cleaned up. Yeah and, yeah, and at some point, and I don't know if it's just too much headspace. If we have headspace for it, why not? We could talk about, dive into, what do we actually, literally need for the for the cost calculator, for any for, for the cost calculator, if we want that, or if we need that, for the incentive, or what do we need for the incentive program, scoring, do away with scoring and kind of diving, diving into that. Yeah, I also thought about it, if you have manpower, could you not have is is it too premature to have somebody in your office start scanning in prints, just so that we get PDFs

Unknown Speaker  1:32:35
somewhere? Probably not.

Matthias Miller  1:32:41
I mean, just, just being able to get those scanned in, first, foremost, above everything else, get that scanned in and, yeah, have duplicates, yeah. I mean, that'd be good, but that, but then we could, we could then it might not take that much then to start getting George to start linking up. I forget how your prints, but we could probably set something in motion to get George to start linking up prints with the item codes and and once that's done, yeah, anyway, maybe I'm jumping too good, too fast.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:29
No, no,

Matthias Miller  1:33:32
yeah, but, but the scanning doesn't require anything from I mean, that's something that somebody could just start doing.

Speaker 2  1:33:38
Right, right, right, right, alright. No, it's great man. Great, great progress. Great, great direction, great goals ahead of us yet. Clean up the Excel entries. I'm going to have to talk to you more about that. I do. I feel like I need to hop out here. Guys are walking out. I kind of like to see guys absolutely. I really appreciate it. And then let's if you have some, like, a couple hour window sometime next week, the fire, you know, thrown out there. And what is that fair?

Matthias Miller  1:34:15
Text me. So Tuesday is pretty open, if that's if you have any

Unknown Speaker  1:34:19
openings. Um, not so good Tuesday. Yeah, Tuesday's not good, does

Matthias Miller  1:34:30
it? Does it matter which Friday is? Is Friday too far off?

Speaker 2  1:34:39
No, no, Friday am is good,

Matthias Miller  1:34:44
okay? 11 to 11 to one. I have a one o'clock. That's the delete one o'clock. Let's do a I could. No, I can. I can re I can do it 10 to 12 Eastern.

Speaker 2  1:34:59
I. Should be good, okay, yeah, I like it awesome. Thanks.

Matthias Miller  1:35:05
Have a good weekend. All right, same way, you bet. Thanks.
