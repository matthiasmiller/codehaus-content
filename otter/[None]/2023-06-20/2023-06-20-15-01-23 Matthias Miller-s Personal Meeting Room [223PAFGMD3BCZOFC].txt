Unknown Speaker  00:32
Hello, hello

Unknown Speaker  00:40
that's a good one for you.

Matthias Miller  00:43
It's the end of a tiring day, but

Unknown Speaker  00:45
that's pretty good. Yep. Yep. How about yourself?

Unknown Speaker  00:53
I have a cold don't feel good and would like to crawl under a rock.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
Alright, well, let's keep it short and sweet and to the point. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  01:10
To point I think the big thing we have on the list is

Unknown Speaker  01:14
sounds like you're underway with a dose.

Matthias Miller  01:18
I had Audra reach out to Alex to more proactively scheduled a call with him to get the conversion tracking up.

Unknown Speaker  01:28
And

Matthias Miller  01:29
some time we want to do our analysis, profitability profitability analysis, but if you're under the weather and proposing that we don't do that now.

Speaker 1  01:39
Let's Okay, well, thanks for that because I forgot so that was related to my request that we've figured out the clients big picture for them V for the client figures out the big picture, right. So we're talking about That's right. And we should and I might that's a very worthwhile endeavor, so don't completely discard that just yet. Maybe we should anyway. What else is on the list though?

Unknown Speaker  02:04
Let me know is no pull this huge optimization training

Matthias Miller  02:24
Oh, I mean, then we have a laundry list. implication of been more suggestion that buyers have higher net worth and sophistication than we think we're speaking to. We are not doing monthly promo premium emails anymore. It fell off the radar. I don't know if it's good or bad,

Unknown Speaker  02:43
but we're not.

Speaker 1  02:49
Can you say that again? Somehow, in my mind scared from talking to Ben Morris. And we aren't doing promo emails thought what was in the middle?

Matthias Miller  02:56
You said? Do you want me to pursue finding a copywriter to do the monthly email promos? And I said I'm not doing this.

Unknown Speaker  03:01
We're not doing redo list. Okay. I'm gonna let's see.

Matthias Miller  03:10
Custom Audiences that gets you what you need. Hot jar call rail. I think Alex doesn't actually wouldn't call real I think he wants access to actual sales call recordings.

Speaker 1  03:24
My question was, may I grant Alex direct access to call rail so that he can listen to call recordings and transcripts? It was just a permission saying like, are you okay with that?

Unknown Speaker  03:35
Good. Or is that all right. Oh, I'm just gonna say yes. Oh, you got Yes. Okay, great. Even better good

Unknown Speaker  04:08
well, there's even something else here

Unknown Speaker  04:18
all right. Yeah. Now,

Unknown Speaker  04:19
I don't see your prefer now.

Matthias Miller  04:20
Oh, just uh, you may want to consider inlining CSS and JavaScript into the static pages of the website for speed

Unknown Speaker  04:27
purposes.

Speaker 1  04:30
Yeah, I've seen all that's going to come out in the wash as we optimize the page, right? Because there's never you know, no such thing as too good. And yet if we hit the score we're looking for then whatever it takes to achieve that is what happened and probably all we need.

Unknown Speaker  04:55
So good.

Unknown Speaker  05:28
So let me go back to spend some time on the

Speaker 1  05:38
on the brought profitability business profitability thing

Unknown Speaker  05:42
yeah

Speaker 1  05:43
yeah let's do and give me one second I'm trying to take notes sorry just a moment here

Unknown Speaker  06:24
more seconds

Unknown Speaker  06:50
okay I'm

Unknown Speaker  07:03
gonna scope it out or where do we

Unknown Speaker  07:06
start? Yeah how much detail

Matthias Miller  07:08
do we want do you want to break this down by district or just across both districts

Speaker 1  07:17
I was certainly looking at the big picture but we probably better know the answer per district unfortunately

Speaker 2  07:26
so let's do as shared here I can share this as well so you can see share

Unknown Speaker  07:41
get I'm gonna guess we want something by

Unknown Speaker  08:00
we have

Speaker 2  08:12
three or five this is Facebook

Unknown Speaker  08:27
got to be a better

Unknown Speaker  08:42
it is okay then we have

Unknown Speaker  08:56
voice is just going to close in voices easiest way

Matthias Miller  09:17
Google

Speaker 2  09:18
substitute 56 which affected their splitting management

Unknown Speaker  09:36
let's do this

Unknown Speaker  10:34
hey check out my sales report

Unknown Speaker  11:07
got a better

Unknown Speaker  11:15
should I do marketing

Unknown Speaker  12:01
I'm on mute

Unknown Speaker  12:02
until you need me just so you don't have to listen to me sniffle no worries

Unknown Speaker  12:11
this report that I put together

Unknown Speaker  13:15
well we might have to do this

Unknown Speaker  13:27
use the hard way

Unknown Speaker  13:58
pretty good by district

Speaker 2  14:12
three it's just gonna take me a little bit of manual work to get these numbers but I can get them

Unknown Speaker  16:34
I wonder though I think your attribution might have been broken referring to what maybe

Unknown Speaker  16:56
maybe this isn't including

Matthias Miller  16:56
all of the actual sales that were

Unknown Speaker  16:58
coming from there

Speaker 2  17:11
we do a sales curve and North Carolina for mine wanna sales curve I went on noxious well we have an actual sales curve so tuner 42k Now so

Matthias Miller  17:38
this doesn't include this only includes about

Unknown Speaker  17:41
a half of the actual sales

Speaker 1  17:48
because of like a sales cycle problem like enough time is now gone by

Unknown Speaker  17:52
no

Matthias Miller  17:53
because of

Unknown Speaker  17:56
our our attribution system was broken these are

Matthias Miller  18:03
only these are the only sales that we can tie back to an FB clip or G clip FB clip

Unknown Speaker  18:09
but if we what we can do is

Unknown Speaker  18:38
I mean if we

Matthias Miller  18:39
want to go across the entire district this is not not

Speaker 2  18:41
necessarily attributable sales you know at that point we're not doing terrible although all of

Matthias Miller  18:57
this is including brick and mortar locations, so let's just kill that let's not confuse anymore but we can do here in North Carolina. We can get better numbers. Oh this is also not

Unknown Speaker  19:13
Oh Now this is a little low

Matthias Miller  20:24
because we did start feeding the leads out to okay there's two ways to calculate this

Unknown Speaker  20:32
now let's just say we do

Matthias Miller  20:40
let's say that we do sales across the entire district then things look a little different

Unknown Speaker  20:48
so Indiana

Matthias Miller  20:52
and Indiana is paying them off commission so I have no idea which

Unknown Speaker  21:01
they're 17% but that doesn't include that does not include their sales commission.

Matthias Miller  21:09
If we go here and we say across all of North Carolina

Unknown Speaker  21:15
up there retail actually let me do this see if this is actually

Speaker 2  21:33
do you want other forces in Indiana?

Matthias Miller  22:07
This point, then that's looking a lot better. Not when you consider the performance of the team

Unknown Speaker  22:18
by itself.

Unknown Speaker  22:25
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  22:28
You don't have formulas? Yeah, mostly,

Matthias Miller  22:31
I mean, you can tweak these somewhere the other but go ahead.

Speaker 1  22:35
Walk me through this. Please. Like just just assume that I'm an idiot and don't know anything.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
All right. This is

Matthias Miller  22:46
Indiana, Indiana spending on Facebook. Got it. This is what Indiana is spending on Google. Got it. This is what they're paying in management for their sales and marketing. Got it? This is how much sales they made across all locations independent of where the lead came in. That means

Speaker 1  23:03
revenue. Total Revenue. That's the word sales occasionally means department. Could you stick the word rev up there next to sales, sales revenue or gross or anything? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  23:15
Great. Yeah. Thanks. So what they've spent versus their total revenue year to date is 18%. Got it.

Matthias Miller  23:32
But those are not necessarily attributable sales.

Speaker 2  23:36
As in we don't know.

Matthias Miller  23:43
Like, we don't know exactly. There's a lot of people who come in and say, Oh, we saw the sign and we drove by and we stopped in that's included in that number.

Unknown Speaker  23:54
So this number might be overinflated.

Unknown Speaker  23:59
Yeah, the the attributable revenue we this is like your let's do this.

Speaker 1  24:08
You want to break it out. One is attributable and one is everything or something like that. Yep.

Matthias Miller  25:46
don't really have any any way to illustrate anything other than that but I'm gonna guess this is actually closer to 300k minimum

Speaker 2  26:01
that's my best estimation and then we said there was Carolina actual revenues more like

Matthias Miller  26:25
so in the grand scheme of things and you're the company

Unknown Speaker  26:29
Yeah, they're able to cash flow

Matthias Miller  26:31
if you said you're not getting any brick and mortar leads, any walk ons, anything like that it's not sustainable by any stretch of

Speaker 2  26:38
the imagination it's not even ballpark

Speaker 1  26:41
close. Okay, can you title the percent column for me

Unknown Speaker  26:56
and what that means is that this it's oh man How do you say this in English that the costs unknown cost is X percent of revenue is what that really means right

Unknown Speaker  27:18
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:19
except keep in mind that this is excluding

Unknown Speaker  27:25
I'm gonna make up

Unknown Speaker  28:15
and, like

Matthias Miller  28:16
here's where it drives me crazy, because do you see this right here? At approval?

Unknown Speaker  28:21
Yes. What in particular?

Speaker 2  28:24
This number right here? Yes. Do you know what happened? No

Unknown Speaker  28:41
good salesperson happened.

Unknown Speaker  28:44
Yep. All right, typo happened.

Matthias Miller  28:46
No.

Unknown Speaker  28:48
This week right here

Matthias Miller  28:51
one of the guys came in said you're lazy you're sitting on your butt.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
Go sell she went out and sold. Ginger I

Speaker 1  29:00
seem to recognize her name. Isn't she one of the ones that you previously said was already good or better? Yeah, she's

Matthias Miller  29:07
I mean she's she's in one of the best locations and I don't know how much is location how much is salesmanship but

Unknown Speaker  29:13
he's one of the top performing ones. And so

Speaker 1  29:17
even so that's interesting to me like she's already one of the better ones and when someone told her get moving she did even better still correct. Yeah. That's very interesting. Is she the only one that actually listened and did something and got results?

Matthias Miller  29:34
Yeah, I mean, your let me show you this. This might be interesting. I mean, I know the the North Carolina guys. Okay, first of all, there's a different philosophy in North Carolina versus Indiana. So let's just look at at sales numbers.

Speaker 2  29:52
She is the only one who's above goal at this point. Marcus is number For two then there's

Matthias Miller  30:02
Kelvin and the new online folks we hired are

Unknown Speaker  30:05
like trailing one more than the other.

Speaker 1  30:15
Wow, online is not doing good, is it? Yeah, that lack of training and experience are disadvantaged due to not sitting there in the right environment. What what are some causes that

Matthias Miller  30:28
we haven't completely, I don't know that I've fully wrap my head around what it is. I mean, we've consistently seen when somebody walks in the building, and they see the quality of the building,

Speaker 2  30:39
they get sold on it. And we have not translated that into communicating that online.

Speaker 1  30:46
It's possible that that might be a real world phenomenon that can't be overcome or would require something really ingenious to parallel it in the virtual online world.

Unknown Speaker  30:57
Yeah, I mean, you know

Speaker 1  31:02
I'm a musician and the last few times I bought an instrument is because I was in Guitar Center had my actual hands on one thought, Man, this thing sounds good, which Okay, sound you know, fine. But there's just something about being there holding in your hand, seeing it smelling it, whatever can't be beat. I say can't be beat but you know, virtual tours. You know, during the pandemic, a lot of real estate agents went to like, instead of bringing the buyer to the house, the agent went alone to the house turned on their FaceTime camera and started walking through the house in real time, still having the same conversation but showing the house on their phone camera while they talked maybe something like that has to happen with the online folks. It would be a different experience to just go into the Home Depot website

Speaker 2  32:06
it's possible they're all remote at this point. So

Speaker 1  32:14
it would be interesting to do a test where like one of the online one of the in office on the ground people played the role of online sales and did something like what I just said which would prove that we would need a hybrid right like online sales can happen but they have to happen with somebody speaking from the dealer

Unknown Speaker  32:36
lot and not in an office that make sense at all Yeah, Herein lies the problem

Unknown Speaker  32:53
I think well I think.

Matthias Miller  33:23
Yeah, that's about the only difference we can tell between what we're doing in Ohio is being physically in the office and whether it's sales manager whether it's sales training, whether it's

Unknown Speaker  33:33
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  33:41
okay okay,

Speaker 1  33:45
can we go back to the

Unknown Speaker  33:49
seat so

Speaker 1  33:54
a couple things here one we are representing maize costs but not maize revenue. Why is that oh since that's going to change the numbers for the better I think

Matthias Miller  34:08
for the attributable revenue

Unknown Speaker  34:12
but I think if I was running this right

Unknown Speaker  34:30
see, so this would be five one.

Unknown Speaker  34:54
Okay, forgive me

Speaker 2  35:09
There's no way that that's the knee oh yeah it is. Well that's looking a little better

Unknown Speaker  35:19
Why did you change the nofollow that

Unknown Speaker  35:21
just sorry let me the they went from 100% to 50%

Speaker 2  35:39
That's my point somebody started closing on some of these leads let's see who it was Trey in Floyd Jenny is not closing come on Jenny get yourself in gear

Matthias Miller  36:02
is Jenny on the ground or remote she she's on the ground but she was out for baby might be rebuilding her pipeline but she should be in the swing of things.

Unknown Speaker  36:14
So I mean, overall we saw this is a

Matthias Miller  36:20
march let me just make sure these March numbers are actually right. But that's it's possible also that that some of the early numbers are exaggerated worse than they

Unknown Speaker  36:29
actually are.

Unknown Speaker  36:37
And there's not

Matthias Miller  36:38
a lot of standards of accountability somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  36:41
Here's the big gap. Somebody needs to start holding some feet to the fire and saying

Matthias Miller  36:49
hey, allow me to rant for a moment. Yeah, please do

Unknown Speaker  36:53
um No not you for Calvin no sales portal Calvin

Unknown Speaker  37:21
this guy's not doing anything with his online leads

Speaker 1  37:25
doing anything means it's not producing sales or he's not even trying

Matthias Miller  37:31
he's quoting about the right number.

Unknown Speaker  37:36
So it's not closing them they need help

Speaker 1  37:39
they need to be fired. Like he's wasting leads if he's a if how I say this. If it is him and his doings

Unknown Speaker  37:52
he's wasting leads

Matthias Miller  37:56
I don't feel like I can say definitively like okay, Ginger. Ginger is lives in a hotspot. Like she gets more leads than anybody else here. Let's do this rapid diagnostics.

Unknown Speaker  38:07
Ginger gets let's do

Matthias Miller  38:13
this on enough timeline, but she just by her own doing gets twice as many leads as the other physical locations.

Speaker 2  38:21
Okay, like just because it's a hotspot. It's a good location. Okay.

Matthias Miller  38:29
But she also seems to have a higher I don't know if it's that. But when she puts her mind to it, she's way better. Marcus is also pretty good salesperson. Kelvin. I just, frankly don't know. But I mean, I think we can see enough from here that we know that. Well, I think Kelvins advantage over Merson Tory or that he's got a physical location I don't think he's better at salesmanship. I don't think he's a better salesperson than they are but I could be wrong

Unknown Speaker  39:07
sorry Give

Speaker 1  39:07
me one second I've got somebody ringing my bell repeatedly and I need to tell them to hush

Speaker 1  39:20
Do Not Disturb on is d me anyway. sure what that's about

Unknown Speaker  39:29
and back I think

Speaker 1  39:35
okay, so. Okay. Well, we're, we're almost talking about multiple problems at once. I think Can we go back to the sheet for a minutes? confidence that this sheet is accurate is what very high moderate.

Unknown Speaker  39:57
What part of the part of the sheet? Oh, I

Speaker 1  39:59
don't know. II probably won't. So now we have complete figures, I hope. And then also you said, attributable versus non attributable? I'm not sure I followed all that. Not sure why the numbers are exactly the same.

Matthias Miller  40:10
We're guessing I don't have a better guess for, you know, in.

Speaker 1  40:16
So it's attributed me attributable means that somewhere in the CRM, it was absolutely matched to a GCL ID or an FBS ID. And there's other sales coming in that we believe the online ads could be affecting, but we have no direct correlation to prove that an online ad brought the sale. Is that correct?

Matthias Miller  40:38
Well, I mean, we know that in North Carolina, we know that if, for any of the online sales people, if they close the sale, it was an online sale. Correct. But then there's also other sales that are not online. Now, I guess we could get if there are other sales that were not online, those would also be included. So I'm kind of making up numbers. And I think this number is actually maybe a bit low, but this is that becomes a this line in particular becomes a very made up

Unknown Speaker  41:08
kind of a very made up number. Well,

Speaker 1  41:11
okay, can we do some extraction, like take the total, like, in order to make it somewhat realistic, whatever realistic means? Can we take the real sales number and subtract the online attributable sales and then just have the remainder be right there in

Unknown Speaker  41:26
row 16.

Unknown Speaker  41:29
Just so that we at least know it's founded in reality

Unknown Speaker  41:40
take the attributable

Matthias Miller  41:45
find the attributable non Online team sales.

Unknown Speaker  41:47
So what you're saying

Speaker 1  41:49
oh, all I'm really saying is I want the number to be factual grounded in something pick a something and I was suggesting that if all else fails, we take the total and subtract the online sales from it or whatever the best number is, in other words, not guessing but actually pulling the number from somewhere

Unknown Speaker  42:20
well.

Unknown Speaker  43:52
There's your fractional number.

Speaker 1  43:54
That's funny, and he just pulled that from the CRM report over there.

Matthias Miller  43:58
Yeah, so it's it's the attributable it's, it's the known online sales team plus the attributable sales from non Online team.

Unknown Speaker  44:08
Plus, they're combined now. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:16
I mean, it's still probably short, but it's factual.

Unknown Speaker  44:22
Okay, um,

Speaker 1  44:26
line 15 Is something of its own does line 16 include line 15. Again, plus some other stuff or is it completely separate? It is.

Matthias Miller  44:39
This is hardcore, attributable based only on tracking This Is Hardcore attributable based on well, this person is a member of this team. We know because they sold it. That that's where

Unknown Speaker  44:50
it falls.

Speaker 1  44:52
Okay, so this is not. This is not one plus one equals two. This is one plus two and don't try to equal three. Okay. Fine. Got it? And then what is 17? You know, yeah, thank you. I was gonna say just call call line 16. attributable and XYZ so that we know it's basic conservative old smart attributed wants panting not sure I would recognize that at a month, but it's nice for now. That's just me. Don't worry about that. And grand total grand total. Now, what's the real difference between 17 and 16? There is some big difference, I can see that revenue across all

Unknown Speaker  45:38
locations. So I am lost.

Speaker 1  45:50
And these, that makes really good sense. I like that. And in 17 becomes.

Unknown Speaker  46:04
Physical Oh, dealer lot. Okay. I got it. I got it. Oh,

Speaker 1  46:15
and the reason we're interested in line 16 is because there is a presumption that anything that went to the Online Sales Team somehow came from the ads, even if we cannot match up the cltd. Exactly. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  46:28
Nobody walked into their office and said, Hey, I would like to buy a shirt.

Speaker 1  46:31
Oh, and I would agree with a very high degree of confidence that if it came to the online sales team, and it didn't have a CLI D attached, that was just because the CLI D got stripped. And it almost certainly came through the ads anyway. I mean, I guess we might have like a little bit of organic going on, or referrals or a friend email on the link to a friend. But generally speaking, if it came through the online lead system, it's mostly driven by PPC. Yeah. Okay. All right. Very happy with that. And so 16 is the number you and I are probably the most interested in. Okay, and then line 17, we are assuming, and I would believe this will be true. We are assuming that online activity is creates a rising tide floats all boats, it gets more people familiar with the company. And so even if even if the final sale is word of mouth or something, it was at some point along the way facilitated by ads going online, we just could in no way prove that there is one way to prove that. And that is to completely shut all ads off for a year which we don't want to do. Yeah, or the minimum a month, right? Because like there's always a slow back down effect. But you'd probably have to turn it off for like a year to have a really good. Here's the funny thing we could do this if you want to do a friend of mine, David Klein, he's Justin Brooks mentor, basically does what he called a seesaw effect where he will wildly swing the bat is not turn the ads off. But he will wildly swing the budget up and down to like $10,000 up $20,000 down so that we can actually see if online clicks and sales and leads and whatever then start see sawing along with the massive budget changes, but it has to be pretty much scary dramatic to take, you know, a noticeable effect. Yeah. Because the problem with the secondary stuff, meaning, you know, primary is I saw the ad I clicked I became a lead and I bought like 11111 all very front end. Everything else I saw your ad. But I clicked Oh, I'm sorry. I saw that and I clicked but I came back to it a week later meaning back to the website. Well that's when you start losing click IDs and it's hard to track but what's even worse is I saw the ad I never clicked in the first place but later on I remembered the brand name and it came to your website or I told my friend about it right because that's real it happens but you can never track that stuff doesn't like

Matthias Miller  48:58
or I saw your ad I may or may not have clicked I saw three ads I didn't click I was driving past your lot on Saturday and so you guys had the grill out and we're smoking things yes and decided to stop because I remembered you guys

Speaker 1  49:13
exactly Okay, so we have we have standard business case reason to believe that we have influence online 17 But we could never directly claim it without killing all ads to prove the point. Right. Okay, thank you very much for this Can I Can you share this with me please? This sheet got it as

Unknown Speaker  49:32
I want to keep an eyeball on it from

Matthias Miller  49:36
I think the big thing is like

Matthias Miller  49:44
I don't know what at this point. I don't know what to tweak.

Speaker 2  49:47
Like getting hardcore on. I mean, I don't know that these

Matthias Miller  49:57
I think selling online is different than selling in person. I don't think that It think ginger can sell online I think Mark is maybe can I'm not convinced that Kelvin salesmanship is good enough that he could sell somebody straight off the phone unless they were had already made up their mind

Unknown Speaker  50:12
to buy and nothing would stop him

Unknown Speaker  50:16
an order taker then not a salesperson

Unknown Speaker  50:19
well no I'm afraid we've got

Matthias Miller  50:22
I would like to fire one of these and say we don't care if we're paying 10% Commission we are I mean at this point even I mean goodness at this point we'd save money putting them on commission

Unknown Speaker  50:44
substantially if

Matthias Miller  50:45
I did my numbers right or my numbers right

Unknown Speaker  50:49
so many times wait whoa wait wait we wait oh yeah no

Unknown Speaker  51:13
no mean no I did my numbers right are you thinking for a second

Matthias Miller  51:22
just I got my numbers wildly wrong but

Speaker 2  51:31
let me mean we are way way way way over paying our salespeople let's say even here if we say it's six times

Matthias Miller  51:55
so if we say I don't know exactly where those numbers are at but six times

Unknown Speaker  52:00
five or it's five times 6000 6000.

Unknown Speaker  52:36
But about 12345 Maybe not four well let's do this

Unknown Speaker  52:56
cincher Kelvin Marcus RIS Victoria we're just going to make up a

Unknown Speaker  53:57
I can tell you right where the problem is

Unknown Speaker  54:10
we got the bottom

Matthias Miller  54:10
80% dragging these guys down and I don't know that these are the exact salaries and I'm sure ginger is making I would expect in ginger markets are making more I hope they are

Matthias Miller  54:33
but we also don't know if we'd fire Marissa and Tory and we got

Unknown Speaker  54:37
a real salesperson in place with the opportunity be good enough for them to hang around

Unknown Speaker  54:48
because there's some something fundamentally

Matthias Miller  54:49
broken the model.

Speaker 1  54:50
Oh yeah, I think I see you're saying like you get a better salesperson but you're not able to make it worth their while because they would be better selling for somebody else.

Unknown Speaker  54:59
Because it's not like pay

Matthias Miller  55:00
for them and possibly the model if the model itself is broken and you bring somebody else in the model itself is broken he bringing then bringing in you know to borrow the Brian Steven term being bringing in cream for dinner or whatever but to bring in a closer than doesn't really fix anything

Unknown Speaker  55:17
I

Speaker 1  55:20
hear you do me a favor in the main section of there could you please add probably on the left well let me explain that the column G and in the s&m Can you add one column to the left and make it marketing only not sales

Unknown Speaker  55:44
yeah thank you

Unknown Speaker  55:56
same first same for NC

Speaker 1  56:21
got this isn't completely right you got lnM reverse compared to D and

Unknown Speaker  56:28
D I think

Unknown Speaker  56:38
yeah, but this is also?

Unknown Speaker  58:35
isn't exactly right though this is

Unknown Speaker  58:45
more like the app

Unknown Speaker  58:57
which mean you're looking for just reviewing again.

Speaker 1  59:04
Google management and sales. Oh, basically, that's me, you and them. Okay. That's attributable. Yep. And percent of marketing only and percent of all of us together. Yeah. And so

Unknown Speaker  59:22
I am

Speaker 1  59:24
astonished and horrified. Do I understand correctly that if I look at, for example, H nine.

Speaker 2  59:36
We cost them

Speaker 1  59:40
like by the time they pay for ads paid for you paid for me, but not even looking at sales. We cost them twice as much money as we made them in January. Like literally we are a 50% in the negative liability in January.

Unknown Speaker  59:56
So what that means, like towards the

Matthias Miller  59:59
end Twice revenue

Speaker 1  1:00:01
to well, to put it in black and white, they made 100 bucks that month and we cost $207 1000s Probably, but you know,

Matthias Miller  1:00:09
you know, the problem with me is I'm gonna say it's close, but not quite.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:17
Keeping in mind that these guys only closed 30k You know, I mean what is that 24? Eight

Matthias Miller  1:00:37
you know, it comes down to this attribution issue because they actually made 2800. And so, you know, the, the marketing cost? I mean, here for they this they spent $8 or whatever, what is this? $24

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
and made 20? What was it? 28? Almost 29

Speaker 1  1:01:06
Is that percentage based off column 15 or off row 15 or 16 1502? We base it off of 16? Because we're pretty sure that that's the real world.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
How, how,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:24
what do you mean when you say how?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
That's 15. Again

Unknown Speaker  1:01:47
we can prorate it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
we only

Matthias Miller  1:02:00
we only have a row 16 for North Carolina. So.

Speaker 1  1:02:07
Okay, I'm objecting to the fact it's not really an objection. But hear me out for a second, we have two sets of figures we're dealing with, we have if somebody held a gun to my head,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
I can only reference click IDs.

Speaker 1  1:02:25
According to the philosophy in row 15. However, we have strong reason to believe that the real revenue we brought is represented by row 16. And so I would like to see those percentage columns, talking to me, based on what we believe comfortably believed to be reasonable. You know what revenue we brought the client because it's kind of paint a better picture than 50% in the hole

Unknown Speaker  1:02:51
in the red.

Speaker 1  1:02:57
I'm willing to have somebody have a cow on me and say you can only prove these clicked IDs? And I would say yes, but you need to be aware of the click IDs gets stripped out. Like there's 100 reasons why we might have a sale, real sale without a click ID but but then that means that most of our conversations should be based around the you know, click IDs and online sales team.

Matthias Miller  1:03:19
If we prorate it, which isn't accurate. I mean, it's not accurate. It's accurate overall, but not on a month to month basis.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
You know, there you go.

Speaker 1  1:03:28
I don't understand that at all what we're talking about with prorating. Okay, well.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:36
I took the attribution.

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
I basically what I'm saying is I don't feel like going back for each specific month and saying for this specific month. We attributed this much this much of that was the sales team. But the actual sales team number was this other number. And instead of what I'm saying is grand total get 171 It should have been 299. So go adjust each of the monthly amounts. That all adds up to 299.

Speaker 1  1:03:56
Oh, I'm good with that. I will. I'm not sure what prorated means. I personally would call it estimated but whatever. That's fine. Great if it makes sense to you all good. Okay, so then now, percent of marketing revenue column R is now based off of column Q. Can you do the same for North Carolina? Please?

Matthias Miller  1:04:15
This is North Carolina. All right. I don't want to have any kind of I don't have any kind of trick that lets

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
me do that in Indiana. They do not have exclusively online salespeople.

Speaker 1  1:04:25
Oh bummer. So we're stuck. Okay. That's crash and burn. Okay, well January, February, March, what happened in March everything was so bad.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42
Just didn't sell any.

Speaker 1  1:04:43
Nobody sold anything in March the lead flow and costs were the same but nobody sold that so sales problem not a marketing problem.

Matthias Miller  1:04:52
Here Here is here's one of the things that we got window of maybe around March or so, but one of the competitors overbuilt inventory in

Speaker 2  1:05:04
2008. Well, last year, like majorly overbuilt inventory.

Matthias Miller  1:05:13
And they started flooding the market with and they started fire sales. And yeah, probably basically losing money on the buildings just to generate cash. I don't know, for sure, but probably.

Speaker 2  1:05:28
So we did take a beating for that. Understood. I don't know that that's the only reason. But then this is also where

Matthias Miller  1:05:40
one of our top salespeople got lazy, nobody got on her. She turns around, clears out her pipeline, makes 90 95k In two weeks, and then, you know, has to rebuild her pipeline the following two weeks, which is that that's what's going on here. And then kind of hits a bit of a semi average stride here.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:58
I love the semi average stride. That's great.

Matthias Miller  1:06:01
I mean, note too, that Tori has just been cranking it out. I mean, it's not she's not posting strong numbers. It's not like but

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
she's closing every week.

Speaker 1  1:06:11
Everybody is now though is that because everybody finally got in gear when the boss said something or something like that starting in week 20.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20
I don't know where it's a market shift.

Matthias Miller  1:06:23
I find it hard to believe that all of a sudden everybody got their head heads in gear. I mean, we did start doing some goal setting probably not enough reviews around it. I probably should get more aggressive around saying okay, did you get it you said you would Why didn't you and I don't necessarily feel like this may just be doubt insecurity as a former salesperson everybody's you know, Kelvin for example, yesterday it was rainy. He had no walk ons. What we should have is a sales manager that says okay, well what did you do? Did you call up all the leads in your pipeline? Did you follow up with them? Have you closed out other leads? Have you like have you been engaging with your Facebook marketplace? Things have you like what have you done? Because it sounds like once again, order take your nut closer.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:09
Be a rainmaker. But where are these

Speaker 1  1:07:12
folks paid? This is the model where y'all are paying them flat rate and they don't get any bonus in any commission at all.

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
There's a built in annual bonus but annual

Speaker 1  1:07:22
annual to intangible for a real human in my opinion. If my paycheck, I'm speaking like as if I was a salesperson. If I could do something today that was going to change my paycheck this weekend. You bet I would. If I could do something today that would change my paycheck this month. I probably would. It would depend on how loud some other thing is screaming in the back of my head because a month is a little far away. A quarter. Barely a year from now. I can't do anything today that would motivate me yet not anything but you know what I'm trying to say like it's just way too far away. Bonuses should be distributed. I hope you don't mind me sound like a brat here for a minute. But I feel really strongly about this. If you want a bonus to influence a person's behavior. The Pavlov's dog feedback loop time has to be short. Yep, I would do they get paid once a month twice a month every week what what is webstores month I wouldn't really just do it immediately like what what is the business use case for delaying that? I think you're actually losing money if you do an annual commission. What you've really done is you simply dished out a little extra money to somebody who was going to work extra hard all year long anyway so you're actually wasting commission money because it's not it's not actually changing the person's behavior

Speaker 1  1:08:56
I feel really strongly about that by the way obviously there's nothing I can do about it it's up to you but I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
very very strongly about it.

Speaker 1  1:09:06
Ginger should like she should already have had a nice steak dinner thanks to her bonus for the fact that she actually listened to her boss and change behavior here five weeks ago

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
she didn't she didn't she she did get some she didn't get a nice steak dinner out of that.

Speaker 1  1:09:19
Okay, how does that jive with what you just said about annual

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
Well, let me rephrase that

Matthias Miller  1:09:29
there's a there's an annual budget set aside for bonuses there have been some periods where he basically said hey, look, we're gonna double down here's a bonus like go on it make happen but it's not like a weekly Hey, every time you hit this number, you get your you get this much of a bonus.

Speaker 1  1:09:49
Okay, there's an annual budget, but they're not paid annually, which kind of undercuts everything I carried on there about 90 seconds ago. Okay, well, what's

Matthias Miller  1:09:57
it much because you're not paid that consistently Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
there you go. I'm on the strong opinion.

Matthias Miller  1:10:02
I know, I understand. Like,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:07
I'm not trying to call the

Matthias Miller  1:10:09
roll. So back to this place. Where? Where? Do we actually know that this sort of people are motivated in that same way? I don't know. Maybe they are. Maybe they're not? Do we? There's also some questions about whether I should be the guy leading the sales team, but we are where

Unknown Speaker  1:10:30
we are. Yeah. And

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
like it or not, I'm not really proud of it. But I'm kind of disincentivized to change it. But that also means we need to fix the problem. Yeah, I'm also not convinced that we can. Yeah, if I had, if I could do what I wanted to, I still think the right thing to do is fire some of the bottom bottom folks and get an actual salesperson in place who is actually really good at what they do.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
And go have themselves

Unknown Speaker  1:11:00
who has the authority to fire somebody

Speaker 2  1:11:04
gave the game probably.

Speaker 1  1:11:09
Can you anecdotally safe the game? Hey, I was looking at some numbers from the sales team. And, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:16
gingers making Forex,

Speaker 1  1:11:19
whatever, what the bottom two, you know, in other words, just make the light comment, like two. Two of the team is doing twice what the worst ones are doing. And one of them's doing over four times what the worst two are doing. Why don't we get rid of at least one of the bottom one because it appears they're costing you money instead of making you money, like just save the salary. And then just see what he says.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:43
Because don't

Speaker 1  1:11:48
forget these two folks here, Marissa and Victoria are making you and me look bad on the math on the spreadsheet.

Speaker 2  1:11:58
So it it does have an impact on you and me

Speaker 1  1:12:10
is that like you don't want to open that can of worms or it's gonna cause a different secondary effect problem or?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:33
I think the argument basically is, Hey, look.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:42
My strategies for keeping my hands on that.

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
We thought we could do complete offline sales.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
Seems to be that's a critical factor.

Matthias Miller  1:12:54
Let's go find another hotspot like gingers, and let's also find a really good salesperson.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00
And let's let them have at it. I like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
I don't know all the ramifications, but I like it in general.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
Can we go back to the sheet for a bit? Yep. So an Indiana that's terrible.

Speaker 1  1:13:37
And what changed in Indiana suddenly closed 63 grand in May. Because we didn't change their lead flow that much. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:13:50
they had two salespeople. Jenny came back from maternity leave. The person who was filling in for her was

Speaker 2  1:13:56
barely an order taker. And they open up a new lot with another guy who's I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:14:08
He's like an energizer bunny. So

Speaker 1  1:14:11
that's great. That's hilarious. Okay, good. Let's see if that continues in June, huh? Yep. Just scary. I'm thinking just just, if you can take a step back with me for a second and I know I'm a weirdo. It's fine. You're welcome to laugh at me or whatever. But I look at this, like, I'm a media buyer. I like this client. I don't want to lose them. I'm afraid someday some guy named Gabe, who has the authority to fire all of us or any of us is going to look at something that's sounds or looks like H nine. And he's gonna say this is terrible. Y'all are costing me money. Now the truth of the matter is, if the difference between age nine and age 13 Is the salespeople then it's not really my fault. But I could get fired for H nine Anyway, are you following me on that, and so overly simplistic

Speaker 2  1:15:07
viewpoint, but it worries me. Now there is good news in this. Which is Do note that apart from March being completely off the charts, we

Matthias Miller  1:15:26
have a steady downward trend, which is actually consistent with what we've seen. There's no trend Okay, Kelvin, there's no trend but

Unknown Speaker  1:15:35
take a look at let's just do by quarter.

Speaker 1  1:15:43
And I'm sorry, I lost the grip on what thing we're talking about salesperson performance. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:15:51
Marissa q4, last year. 111 point 8%. I know that's not a lot, but 2.2% 2.6% of all leads she

Unknown Speaker  1:16:01
she got. And so

Speaker 1  1:16:03
this means she's simply getting better at closing from year to year, or from quarter to quarter. Yes, correct. Okay. Has that been true into last year as well?

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
Well, I mean, she just she started q3 last year. So there's not really anything meaningful there. Tori has been slower start 1.4 1.7 2.4. But if you look at her on a monthly basis that are don't know exactly what actually asked her a little bit what happened, but

Speaker 2  1:16:34
I don't know if she's had some strong weeks. Maybe this isn't it? Strong months. But June, May in June, they were pretty similar. Marisa performed her in April. Toria showing

Matthias Miller  1:17:00
some these are attributable leads. So maybe there's some discrepancy here?

Speaker 2  1:17:05
Not sure. She did not have.

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
I don't know I hate these numbers. Because it's so hard to get them nailed down. Exactly. Right. But anyway. Anyway, bottom line, there still does seem to be improvement month over month on this. And so the thing that's not clear. Is it's possible that yes, it is a new

Unknown Speaker  1:17:30
model. But

Matthias Miller  1:17:34
we've got the right people in place who are going to figure out this model. And they're going to get us

Unknown Speaker  1:17:39
down to where we need to be.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
Okay, or is

Matthias Miller  1:17:47
this strictly seasonality that's increasing revenue,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
and making the numbers look better? Which

Speaker 1  1:17:59
could absolutely be and it would be scary, because it would mean we have a small, nice peak, maybe summer season, or we don't know what ends it maybe back to school is that we have no idea. Maybe vacation in August is that we don't know. And that means that maybe they only make money, three months out of the year, which is probably not going to work. I'm not predicting that. I'm hoping that's not true. But

Speaker 2  1:18:25
well, I mean, it is already true.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
It's true. We just don't know, the parameters, I think is what I'm saying.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
No, I mean, like,

Matthias Miller  1:18:37
this is the sales distribution, the anticipated sales distribution across the years. So

Unknown Speaker  1:18:43
you know, up until

Speaker 1  1:18:46
now, it actually runs right on down into November. That's surprising. That's good news. So we're

Matthias Miller  1:18:52
on week 25. So we're here in the sales cycle.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:59
And so, you know, we should have another, I mean, we should have

Matthias Miller  1:19:05
only a third of the way through the strongest part of the selling

Unknown Speaker  1:19:08
year, I think.

Matthias Miller  1:19:12
Another way to say it is average goal is we're only a third of the way through the selling year. And we're halfway through the calendar year. So yes, these numbers should go down because of seasonality because we are going into the strongest parts of the year

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
where the selling selling season

Matthias Miller  1:19:35
extends through most of the rest of the years. In other words, it

Speaker 1  1:19:39
is this sheet, the sort of thing that you could teach your VA Audra or anybody to update because I would like to see this data keep coming in from month to month. I just don't want to waste your time. I think it's worth doing every month or so though. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:20:06
this is the most

Matthias Miller  1:20:07
disparate, here's the most obnoxious part like

Speaker 1  1:20:09
alright, so later on you can teach them how to run those figures correctly instead of the prorated estimate

Unknown Speaker  1:20:20
I know you don't want to do it now but like somebody else could run another screen. Yeah. So I'm like

Unknown Speaker  1:20:31
okay, well does that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
this is also

Matthias Miller  1:20:38
complex enough that just shooting an email over and saying hey, we updated this, I don't think is enough. I think this has to be something that gets in our on a call agenda for us to talk about and look at

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
and dig into. Totally.

Speaker 1  1:20:53
Alright, by the way, can you actually share with the Share button the sheet to my address because I don't have

Speaker 2  1:20:59
permissions yet. So info to remarketing that's weird. Okay, no problem. Okay. Now that let's do that

Speaker 1  1:21:31
okay. mending

Unknown Speaker  1:21:36
the sheath

Speaker 1  1:21:47
picked up kind of a new customer, they keep giving me ad accounts, I'm only getting paid $800 a month per account, and they are slowly degenerating into bothering me multiple times a day what to do with them. Yeah. I really want the money and they like they're actually texting me and emailing me many times a day. I can't take it

Unknown Speaker  1:22:14
all?

Matthias Miller  1:22:15
Yeah, not a call, but a submission form for the requests and promise to get back to them on a weekly basis and offer one escalation call a week, or exclude text

Speaker 1  1:22:26
a week. That might be good. Yeah. I'm very non confrontational. And I hate to say things where I'm drawing the line, give them the opportunity to say forget it, but it's probably what we have to do.

Speaker 2  1:22:41
To Client Success person who's good at

Matthias Miller  1:22:45
setting boundaries and making people feel good about it.

Speaker 1  1:22:47
I sure do want to get one I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:53
Okay, um,

Speaker 1  1:22:58
thanks for all that now. Can you bring the sheet back on the screen? So that was sort of part one of the conversations extremely useful info. What started this conversation in my mind

Unknown Speaker  1:23:15
was

Speaker 1  1:23:18
we were having a discussion about the fact that I know I'm gonna misquote this, but if you can remember the general discussion

Unknown Speaker  1:23:27
the truepoint company

Speaker 1  1:23:30
gets leads from us so they can show us shed retail, they also sell off their own lot. And they also build sort of wholesale white label whatever the right word is for somebody else. Who is making a profit off of them. Remember this conversation? And I do not remember the wording but something was said that made me realize that it was possible that they are making even selling wholesale that the company is making more money building and delivering the wholesale sheds than building and delivering what I'm going to call the retail sheds because it could be possible because the entire operation of sales and marketing might be costing so much per shed that it consumes negates the extra profit margin from the retail sale. Did anything I just said makes sense at all.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:32
Other words,

Speaker 1  1:24:34
okay, so I'm gonna I'm gonna play what if, let's pretend there's one shed and it retails for 2000s and wholesales for 1000. Okay. And so you'd like to say, well, we wish that someday we could kick the wholesale buyer to the curb and just do everything retail because we have another $1,000 per shed much more profit margin. But if somebody ran numbers, and discovered that actually The total sales and marketing costs per retail shed was so high that it was eating more than that $1,000 additional net profit, then literally, literally, it is more profitable for two point as a company to build and sell to the wholesale folks than to do anything retail or anything online, however you want to call it. There's my scenario makes sense? Yes, but it has a major problem. Okay, that makes me happy holding in place.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:29
So let me see if I can find the right translation.

Speaker 2  1:25:39
Jonathan knew you could make more money. If you insisted that people only text you once a week. And you were only

Matthias Miller  1:25:53
going to spend 30 minutes answering your questions each week.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:58
Oh, wait,

Speaker 1  1:25:59
I think I think he already told me this last time we talked about it right.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:03
So

Matthias Miller  1:26:04
but why don't you do that? Well, two reasons a, you need the money. Be Your nonconfrontational, which is exactly the issue that we have here. What is the problem with being a wholesaler? Well, these guys have very mercenary interests.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:26
And in sounds to me, like,

Matthias Miller  1:26:33
bordering on toxic in terms of like the the third party, maybe bordering on just using straight up intimidation to keep them in their place. And yanking these guys chain? And yes, they could make more money from a strictly per building basis, but not at the bottom falls out. They're not. And there's no control over the business.

Speaker 1  1:27:04
Okay, yes, you did tell me this before. Okay. So I like that it helps whatever the right way is to say this, that's a good thing. And yet, if we said, there's multiple factors going on here on why they would or would not continue to wholesale, some of them are intangible, their personal, their philosophical, their opportunity, that's great. But there is also this one called financial. And I don't ever want anybody, not even a third party outside consultant or a competing agency to walk in here and say, ha, look at that game. Every time you fill a retail order from the online system, you're losing money compared to your wholesale, I want that conversation to not be possible, because I want that map to never happen. And and basically, I'm still looking for the math, the real world math, not my hypothetical math. So to sum all that up, how can we get numbers? To find out if we are costing them more with online sales leads and sales than that additional net profit margin from

Unknown Speaker  1:28:12
retail?

Speaker 1  1:28:20
I want somebody to tell me Nope, they're still making an extra $100 than they would have if they'd done the same one wholesale or $500 or $10,000, or whatever it is.

Matthias Miller  1:28:30
Which document or sorry, which number? Probably mostly.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:37
Probably 16.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
I feel like 16 is the real world number by the way.

Matthias Miller  1:28:44
So I know I think 40% is still high but I think if we get it down to 30%

Speaker 2  1:28:49
We're actually I wouldn't be surprised. They say matching but I don't really fully buy into the idea that

Matthias Miller  1:29:07
their competitor

Unknown Speaker  1:29:07
is actually giving them is

Matthias Miller  1:29:12
paying them 85% of retail price for their buildings landed

Speaker 1  1:29:19
I think I see what your point but it actually at the end of the day if we're talking about being counting for two points. Doesn't matter how much the competitor is selling the same building for that matter. Some it's true point is selling the same building for retail. Well, sure,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:35
but bear

Unknown Speaker  1:29:41
and I'm only talking about being counting and running figures.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:43
So I mean, also

Matthias Miller  1:29:49
bear in mind that they've been playing around with 10% off discounts to

Speaker 2  1:29:54
to close sales as well which it's not rip the band aid off of that thing, but Okay, there's lots of layers to this I was thinking somewhere in my notes

Speaker 2  1:30:33
they used to say 10%. For selling 10% for hauling, and 5% for administrative work I think the number is 15%.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:06
are good number

Speaker 1  1:31:11
Wait, can I just say that back to you, we need to arrive at a state in which total sales and marketing? Is 15% of revenue brought in or lower? Did I get that? Right? That is correct. And we're way off from that right? Or have I misunderstood something?

Matthias Miller  1:31:27
No, we are we are. I mean, and also keep in mind, like you're freaking out. But also keep in mind that I know that Gabe went into this knowing that this is an experiment and it's is going to take time to get it dialed in. Like we're not going to hit the ground running. I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:46
wish we would have but mean everybody would have would have believed that to be awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:31:55
So we're, we're 3x or less

Unknown Speaker  1:31:58
currently. No, we're not. I mean, for me, we're we're 3x or less. We're substantially better than we've been previously.

Matthias Miller  1:32:14
Doesn't doesn't mean that the year to date numbers are all day, or like the year to date numbers are terrible, especially given what happened in March.

Speaker 1  1:32:30
Just for a moment, because I'm ADHD, what is the reason that for Indiana, there's no difference between we have the CLI IDs and we don't have the CLI IDs?

Matthias Miller  1:32:40
Because there is no way to determine.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:44
I mean, if we can't I don't know maybe

Matthias Miller  1:32:48
there's ways are you gonna rewrite the whole report and get you better numbers, but that's not happening right now.

Speaker 1  1:32:53
So what I mean, that's the bottom line, I just realized something. So you look at it as online sales team, which is in fact what these numbers are. And I was looking at it as making a sale of somebody that came through the website, even if they didn't have a seal ID so on correct

Matthias Miller  1:33:12
and if I could if I would rewrite the report we had

Speaker 1  1:33:15
that online lead rather than online sales team like I realized there's no people but I think we're getting sales through the site to the form that somehow lost their Cid

Matthias Miller  1:33:32
forewarning I basically maxed out my my tolerance for where we're at right now.

Speaker 2  1:33:37
We're gonna have to let this sit and come back to it.

Speaker 1  1:33:40
I am perfectly happy with that. And thank you for doing this much. No need to drag you through the mud. That was never the point. None of this was about you. By the way. This is just like literally you got to imagining somebody entry point company running their own similar figure someday and going whoa, wait a minute. Every time they sell a shed, for me, they're costing me more than they're making or whatever, you know, wherever that conversation would go.

Matthias Miller  1:34:12
Yeah, I mean, there's two sides to this. Number one. I'm a fan of being I'm a fan of good stewardship. I'm not a fan of becoming reactionary to

Unknown Speaker  1:34:30
imagine nightmare future events. And somewhere there's,

Matthias Miller  1:34:33
there's a distinction between the two. So there you go.

Speaker 1  1:34:38
Yeah. Oh, and you're not wrong at all, but I'm thinking of it as mathematical risk mitigation, if possible. may not be possible. Okay. You want to hear what I'm up to just for the fun of it. Are you to test for that? Give me

Speaker 2  1:34:59
I'm me but it's actually Can I take a break and give you a call in just

Speaker 1  1:35:10
a few minutes that's fine perfectly fine Can I hang up the Zoom yep

Unknown Speaker  1:35:13
all right sounds good thanks thanks bye
