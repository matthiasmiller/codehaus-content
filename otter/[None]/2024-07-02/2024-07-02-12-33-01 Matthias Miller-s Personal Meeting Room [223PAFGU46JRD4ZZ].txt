Unknown Speaker  00:26
Hey, there. So hello, this is Mark.

Unknown Speaker  00:37
So how's How's vacation going? I'm back.

Unknown Speaker  00:42
I'm done. I'm back in the land. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  00:45
you're done. Okay,

Speaker 1  00:47
we got we got low humidity and and you're able to breathe outside. So

Speaker 2  00:55
Well, you had bad timing coming to the east, I think, because if you were here, at least in Ohio today, it would, you would, it's 70, probably mid upper 70s, and humidities lessened and, and, plus, everything's nice and green, which I don't know. I hear in Colorado, you have to irrigate in order to have it be green. But

Matthias Miller  01:26
everything was wonderfully green. That is, that is correct. But we had, like, we had about 100 degrees the first, first day we came in plus high humidity. So we're not made for that.

Speaker 2  01:38
There was, there was one of those warm days. I know there was one wedding where, if they wanted to, they had the wedding in a tent, or at least, well, Part The reception was in a tent with, like a clear tent. I don't know did typically they're quiet, like a white canvas, and you get some shade, but this was a clear tent, and it almost had, like a greenhouse effect. And it was so warm that, like the the butter and the dishes just melded, and the cheese on the salad, like the grated cheese on the salad, melded. You know, before they served and it was, is, it was a memorable event.

Speaker 1  02:29
It's hilarious. Wow, wow, yes,

Speaker 2  02:38
what? What did you just kick back and relax, or did you do some specific things like you planned for?

Matthias Miller  02:52
Yeah, we did. We did. We had a couple days of just relaxing, but when went down to the beach one day, about an hour away, spent most of the day at a, at a at a pool, so we got a bunch of water and went golfing with my with my in laws.

Unknown Speaker  03:15
And

Matthias Miller  03:18
yeah, we had to get out and about and do and do things.

Unknown Speaker  03:24
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  03:30
Good. Well, I I'm still eyeballing taking a week off some sometime this summer. It was going to be May or June, and then now I'm looking at last week in July, and not sure that's going to work. So not sure.

Matthias Miller  03:53
Well, sometimes there's the I don't know this is appropriate, but sometimes there's the gonna be out. I hope everybody survives. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  04:18
Well, do we want to jump into our list, or what's what's the plan, alright, alright, I guess mark, you can't see this, so I will, if you need me to go into detail and some I'm sure, let me know about that. And then I have a whole bunch of emails I captured down at the bottom. So if there was email correspondence on any of these things that I missed linking, feel free to let me know. But we had the reconcile. Export takes too many pages. Drew was looking at that. Did you get chance to do that?

Speaker 4  04:51
Yeah, it's it's vastly improved. Instead of 80, we're down to about 25

Unknown Speaker  04:58
but I. I don't know, Mark, how often are you going to want to print this thing? Is it worth going further on?

Speaker 2  05:11
Well, I don't think it is, at least not now. I mean, we haven't, yeah, we haven't needed it so far yet. I mean, it's basically what an archive of what you've reconciled, right,

Unknown Speaker  05:24
right?

Speaker 2  05:28
I would, I would say, We're that's good, you know, if, if we like what? What are the use cases when we would use it

Unknown Speaker  05:37
well, like

Speaker 4  05:40
that. I'm not exactly sure I would use it in, you know, if I need to go back and straighten something out, like say, Okay, this account had been reconciled, and now it's not if there's something that I can't figure out just based on what's going on currently. So it's not like something you use a lot about me, I'd say it's fine, because, like, probably 90% of the use that we'll have for it will all be in digital format. Any

Unknown Speaker  06:21
Sure, yeah,

Speaker 4  06:22
you know me figuring out what went sideways with an account.

Unknown Speaker  06:26
So, okay, so can I done? Yep, great,

Speaker 3  06:36
cool, okay, Matthias interest calculator for notes.

Matthias Miller  06:41
We took that live. It should be standard now I can check for sure where it is

Unknown Speaker  06:50
and see

Matthias Miller  06:52
accounting, accounting tools interest on mix, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:55
okay. I uh, interest

Speaker 3  07:03
on notes, not that you need to capture that, I guess, um, Drew. Do you need to review that? Or can we, uh, check mark,

Unknown Speaker  07:09
yeah, we're done. Cool.

Speaker 3  07:14
All right, oh, I had an email removing former employees from payroll. We talked about that.

Matthias Miller  07:32
Yeah, Mark, can't remember where we left that. Mark, were we going to go ahead and do that? And have Seth, do that. Is that priority enough? Or was it a we can manage until we can Yeah, we can manage for debt.

Speaker 2  07:50
You had it on your upcoming priorities list that we created. I think our last meeting you or you get created, you said late July, spec out payroll for bet for for Seth, so I think that was going to be and we can live with it until then. So unless you remember something differently, I would say what I understand. It's in your court with an eta of late July to have that have a spake on that, and then we take a look at it. Is that sounds right?

Matthias Miller  08:32
Yes, that does bring about. I should have been referencing the email, yep.

Speaker 3  08:36
Okay, good. Put that out July 25 or so, good, okay, sounds good. Let's see tool to update standard costs. Has it gone live?

Unknown Speaker  08:51
Yeah, it should be live, okay.

Unknown Speaker  08:55
Is it done or does it need review?

Matthias Miller  08:58
I would expect we should review, should at least try to use it

Unknown Speaker  09:02
okay.

Speaker 3  09:06
Do we want to keep it as a due date of the 27th of June, or do we want to move it out a little

Unknown Speaker  09:16
bit? Do we have a chance to go over how to use it today? Yeah, we can do that,

Speaker 3  09:23
okay, but on the agenda for today, okay, down the line, asset management changes for vendor, vendor invoices.

Speaker 2  09:37
Matthias, I see that's also late July. On that, that list that you had created that,

Speaker 3  09:52
okay, let me kick that one to July 25 as well. About the fee. Pre or fees and premiums versus write offs.

Matthias Miller  10:04
That's early July. Set it for, I don't know, maybe Monday. Okay,

Speaker 3  10:13
great process for moving payments from one so to another. We're getting out until late July. Right now,

Matthias Miller  10:23
I think we can just see that there. We're going to wait and see, okay, what? What happens with write offs or the other opinions?

Speaker 3  10:33
Alright, so for late July, then we still have handling, historically reconciled transactions.

Matthias Miller  10:40
We had that one also. It's early July, maybe end of next week.

Unknown Speaker  10:46
Okay, beat up general ledger and transaction report. Um,

Unknown Speaker  10:54
late July.

Unknown Speaker  10:56
Okay, 25th still work.

Unknown Speaker  10:59
Sure. Okay,

Speaker 3  11:03
let's see Mark, I still had the income statement for the pole barn rev and cogs as july 25 is that still right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:15
it is okay.

Speaker 3  11:18
For Matthias, we had duplication warning criteria.

Matthias Miller  11:24
I think that's actually tomorrow, maybe

Unknown Speaker  11:32
okay

Speaker 3  11:35
about let's see vendor transaction reports I had for Drew. Let's see sending the links to everything you wanted to keep. And then you could make a standard report, or Matthias could make a standard report, I believe, is the action item on that. Did that get done? Is that still pending for late July?

Unknown Speaker  11:58
Yeah, put it on my July. Okay, are we on the 25th we're

Speaker 3  12:03
on the 25th still perfect. Okay, so now we're getting into August, late August. You guys want to go through the rest of this list, or you want to look at the new emails coming in,

Matthias Miller  12:18
I would say new stuff. Okay,

Speaker 3  12:19
let's jump forward, but here, okay, some of these are instant, some of them are emails. So we had slow entering transactions. Incident, did you wind up actually getting it done? Matthias,

Matthias Miller  12:35
yeah, I did. It was getting in the way of the products and refund stuff I was working

Speaker 3  12:41
on. Okay, no, that makes sense, so I was gonna market closed, if that's the way it needs to be, fix vendor, invoice, account discrepancies.

Matthias Miller  12:58
That's, what's, what's number 10148,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
I wonder if I think so.

Speaker 3  13:21
Okay, it's done. It's done. Okay, great. I think

Matthias Miller  13:25
it went I think it went live already.

Speaker 3  13:30
Okay, makes sense. Didn't see it notes, but yeah, fair enough consider only sending new accounting impact errors. 101,

Unknown Speaker  13:41
this requires conversation, I don't know. Put

Speaker 3  13:53
it on the agenda, yeah, okay, the sales tax report. I uh, 18.

Speaker 3  14:10
July 18. Okay, okay, we've got emails you had sent me this upcoming priorities list, which I think is what this is, what Mark's been referencing. Um, you'd said, let's chat about how to integrate this into clickup. Do you still want to chat about how to integrate this into clickup? Probably

Unknown Speaker  14:41
the only thing would be to make sure that

Unknown Speaker  14:42
the only thing missing, which one,

Unknown Speaker  14:49
the end number? Well, okay, the last number, the last one, I think, yeah, just make seconds in.

Matthias Miller  15:01
Yeah, end of September, and I will.

Unknown Speaker  15:10
So wait. I'm sorry. Okay,

Matthias Miller  15:15
on this last one, the very last item, I'm going to write up an incident, okay, and you can then just add it in,

Speaker 3  15:34
which is not the same thing as the sales tax report incident that you created, the 10186,

Matthias Miller  15:40
no, that's the, that's the short term like, okay, the band aid on it, and this is the, so you can close up, close out the upcoming priorities. Okay,

Speaker 3  15:53
sounds good. Yeah, well, do that, that'll be fine. Updates going live. Was there anything that we needed to actually discuss on this is my just been an FYI.

Unknown Speaker  16:14
I think it's just an FYI. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:17
Response on credit memo functionality this, I believe, was a good long email from Drew, and I wondered if it had anything to do, first and foremost, with the vendor credit memos. I was trying to figure out where it might go, or is this a new issue that we're talking about here? It's

Matthias Miller  16:37
a follow up to that. And I think I addressed everything. Okay, I think everything in there is addressed either in the email back in their court or in an incident. Okay,

Speaker 3  16:48
I think so. We had marked vendor credit memos as a not to do so I I wasn't sure whether or not I should append it to that or not. I should I just mark this one closed.

Matthias Miller  17:02
Um, credit memos are done, or mostly done. I think there's some missing pieces.

Speaker 3  17:11
Do we want to mark it? To do is it still actually being worked on? I

Speaker 3  17:23
I guess we had said it was a Josh item, therefore we've marked it not to do it looks like is what

Matthias Miller  17:27
happened? Oh, if it's Josh's stuff, then, I mean, either way, that's

Unknown Speaker  17:33
it's fine. Well, let

Speaker 3  17:35
me go ahead and close this one then, and we won't worry about, I guess, if it's Josh's we won't worry about tracking it too much. Um, cash flows. Let me see, I need to pull up an email here. I was trying to figure out if this was related to the Cash Flow Statement item we also already have open.

Unknown Speaker  17:58
Yes, it is okay.

Speaker 3  18:02
So add cash flow statement, 9824 Yep, okay. And is this in still in process? Then, okay, awesome, editable report, work, fix. Boy, that's a nice, fun one to say. Wasn't prepared. How about this one?

Matthias Miller  18:28
It's it's not due, it's pending. It'll be fixed to the next update. Okay, no,

Speaker 2  18:33
is Matthias? Is that something that came from, from Dwayne it

Unknown Speaker  18:42
came from Drew, from truth.

Speaker 2  18:46
Oh, okay. Well, okay, Dwayne mentioned the same thing today and said it's asked me to put it on Josh list in the morning. He said it's Dwayne called it editable report weirdness, and he said it's like when he goes to edit a I forget what it was sometimes, depending on what he does when he wants to sort a column or do something, it'll like, copy and paste another column and it wasn't working correctly. So if, if this is the same issue, then I'll just tell Dwayne tomorrow morning that that you're fixing it. I mean, is that, does it sound like the same issue?

Matthias Miller  19:27
Yes, it does. It's it was a fluke, timing issue. One of the developers, again, it's one of the one of the go fast and break things. But one of the developers introduced the bug, and we did an update. And then soon thereafter, you fixed it. We just haven't gotten the fix yet. So

Speaker 2  19:51
okay, I will Okay, got it. I'll note that so we don't have two people chasing it. Do.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
You. Okay,

Speaker 3  20:03
all right. The next one was the current asset, invest, payable, funded. Warning. This was a her Joel is something he introduced with the cash flows changes. He said a fix is coming soon. Do we need to actually do anything with this?

Matthias Miller  20:18
Not unless we want to follow up on it, make sure he gets it taken care of. Care of.

Unknown Speaker  20:23
Is it a Joel? Can I it is a Joel

Unknown Speaker  20:26
item? Okay, yes, go ahead and do that too. I'll

Unknown Speaker  20:29
put it in progress and give it to him. Um, should we follow up on it? Should I give it a date?

Matthias Miller  20:35
Yeah, next, next Thursday. Okay, perfect.

Speaker 3  20:40
Thank you. And then we have last one, credit, sales, order, payment, not posting.

Matthias Miller  20:46
Is that on the Well, either way, it's in my email, I need to figure out what's going on. So you get, you get assigned it to me to chase it down and make it, make it due today. And then we can, if there's a fix, we can figure out what, when that happened. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  21:04
sounds good.

Speaker 3  21:12
Okay, that's it. Is there anything else you guys want to go

Unknown Speaker  21:19
through? I don't anything that you guys?

Unknown Speaker  21:22
No, I think that's for me.

Speaker 3  21:24
Okay, great. I'll get this updated and send out new lists and have a great meeting. Thank you. Appreciate it. All right, talk to you later. Bye, thank you.

Speaker 5  21:39
All right. You just want

Matthias Miller  21:45
to go down through the through the agenda was there.

Unknown Speaker  21:54
Yeah, that,

Speaker 2  21:55
yeah, that's fine here. I do want to touch two things, Justin, you're at numbers then, and taking a quick look at those canceled buildings. But we can do that last didn't shouldn't take very long.

Unknown Speaker  22:20
Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  22:32
nothing remains to be done. Verify the system deposits. Verify I really spin the cystic county

Matthias Miller  22:52
manually into actual costs, increase FDI and Okay, so I will update the stin. I will push that stint into accounting, and then drew will go make sure the numbers line up. My reading that right?

Unknown Speaker  23:17
That is correct. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  23:21
I think I'm clear on that.

Speaker 2  23:25
Drew, can you think of anything else needs done on this?

Speaker 4  23:31
I didn't read very carefully. Now, is this a lot to do with the lock star changes, or is it was is,

Speaker 2  23:46
I can I didn't quite understand what you said you're sounds like you're the bottom of a barrel.

Speaker 4  23:53
Well, I was back out of nowhere. So that's about the same. There's a is all I have to do with the lockguard switch. Or is there something else

Speaker 2  24:14
I think you said, is this all that remains to be done for that? That those invoices we mistakenly had invoiced in 23 is that your question? You're asking if this is all that remains to be done on vinyl structures to close your end 23

Speaker 4  24:39
Yes, is it all related to that? All this that you have here? Oh,

Speaker 2  24:46
it okay, one and two are one and two. I think, I think one and two are all taken care of, because so one and two are related to that, and I the reason I believe they're all taken care. Thereof is because the if we just look at one and two, the drop in net income is 203,000 and when I looked at your balance sheets that you sent, because we still had kept those as retained earnings, your balance sheet, you sent for April and or March and April, the accounts didn't balance, and it said ones off by I think it was the exact amount that this changes, 203,000 whatever that amount. So I think with what I think one and two are just basically verify three is kind of an well, it seemed like the easiest thing to do, and we just threw that in there. The only reason we're doing three is a few weeks ago they said, Oh, we have this building that we built back in 23 as a prototype. We want to we never, we now realized it was never entered in assists. How can we what's the best way to enter these in this into assist, so we don't mess up all of our numbers. And it seemed easier to enter it back and because we hadn't finalized 23 yet, to enter it then, rather than trying to push it in, 24 into a period where you would have so, so three is unrelated, okay, but yeah, that was kind of a long winded answer. But does that, did that answer your question, or do you, do you see anything, any other issues that you expect?

Speaker 4  26:43
No, that's fine. So, so this building in 23 like it's just sitting and finished goods. Then as we come across the year,

Unknown Speaker  26:58
yes, yeah,

Speaker 4  26:59
okay, okay, and then the finished goods inventory number is what we should be getting once it isn't done, yeah,

Speaker 2  27:12
once correct, and Whitney already reflects that she just made these updates earlier today, we were getting quite a bit of pressure from bank to have, which, understandably, to have 23 numbers here, middle of following year. So

Speaker 2  27:40
also send you, I, I think I send you the balance sheet from Whitney for year end 23 with these updates.

Unknown Speaker  27:53
Was that on the original email?

Speaker 2  27:57
Yeah, yeah, it was, or I think it was. So if you could, well, I guess once these updates are made, obviously, you send me a new balance sheet. You said balance sheets as well. So yeah, make sure that all those numbers match. But yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  28:17
So while, while you guys were bringing that out, I did my part some periods in your court. Wow,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
good. So

Speaker 2  28:33
Matthias two, I think it'd be worth looking at why this was kind of unusual. Oh, we were going through finished goods inventory by sales orders report, and discovered that these, however many 12 buildings were, well, okay, it looks like the system canceled them. Yeah, the system canceled all of these on 524, and 7:15am, and you were on vacation and we weren't. Dwayne looked at and said, well, let's just try and go and uncancel them and and see if it stakes. You know, that whole and it so we looked at him again today, at least four of them, and they still joke correctly, as UN but curious if you could see what happened, or if there's something, was it a fluke, or is This something that we should be concerned about preventing?

Unknown Speaker  29:41
7:15am, at 7:15am

Matthias Miller  29:48
let's go find out I was on 524, 715, I'm not sure that was me scary. I can't I can never remember this is doing time conversion. So 735,

Unknown Speaker  30:14
remember what time

Matthias Miller  30:17
we got? Time showing up in Eastern Time, in Mountain Time. And I can sometimes lose track

Unknown Speaker  30:23
of, okay, so

Speaker 2  30:28
is there? What is UTC? I saw, Oh, it was when the Eclipse was going through. I saw, there was like local time, and then there was also a time that said UTC. I think I know is that, like a universal does it stand for Universal Time? Or what is that?

Matthias Miller  30:49
Yeah, I think that's what it stands Universal Time is what it stands for, and it means it's basically all time zones are measured as offsets, like minus 600 or minus 06. 100 plus, oh, 500 in terms of relative to that. So Bangladesh should be, I don't know what exactly it is. So it is something like plus plus six plus six hours, and cancels minus minus six, or something like that, and depends on on daylight savings and all that time. But you can see it's always, it's always a zero times like there's no engine, yeah, or that's the basis.

Matthias Miller  31:47
Time Zones are horribly obnoxious things to work with, because there's actually times that dates and times that do not actually exist in time. Because when you in the in the spring, when you go from 1am to 2am there is no 1:30am exist. So what do you do when somebody puts in 1:30am at that time? What time do they mean?

Unknown Speaker  32:16
Never thought about that time to sleep.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  32:22
Exactly

Matthias Miller  32:26
524, so trying to go back, it might be That's too old. Let's see what transmissions do. Transmissions, transmissions have? Can modify the database, right? Or no?

Unknown Speaker  32:55
I don't know.

Matthias Miller  33:01
Not seeing anything there well, and it transaction.

Speaker 2  33:08
So these, these buildings, the story on these buildings was that these 12, specifically, were 12 out of 30 that were sold at at a local auction that we had. And then we actually, I think Matthias, you might have gone in and edited these, these, uh, Dwayne edited these invoice I think you did invoice dates, and you said, well, all 30 of these were sold at, sold on 420 and we, we entered that, I forget, maybe doing it the, okay, that's, that's all, I mean, that's, In reality, what happened. But we also because we sell them with delivery. So we say, on 420 they were actually sold to the auction company, and then they cut a check for the whole for all 30 of them, and send us some money. But we sold them with miles, or 30 miles of delivery included. So some of them we need to keep them around, we can have transit tasks for delivering them, which is kind of backwards from all the other logic that we build in its where we say transit task once, once, if you have a transit task and it's been delivered to the end customer, then you think it should be invoice. I don't know. Did that play in this or not, but it's kind of unusual that out of 30, only 12 of them at this issue.

Unknown Speaker  34:59
I. Um, let me see if there's

Matthias Miller  35:04
so I set the invoice date after it was canceled.

Unknown Speaker  35:09
Um, oh yeah. I see

Matthias Miller  35:19
so i Oh, and we've got, we've got an issue with our let me voracious let me send an email to myself. They made some changes to the activity history report, and it's not showing things correctly. It's missing from it's missing some line items. It's not showing that I modified it on that I set the set the date on 530 so let me grab this before

Unknown Speaker  35:47
so I can At least get a report in.

Matthias Miller  35:58
All right, so we cancelation date 17. So let's do this. The other place that I could easily look is it scheduled tasks.

Matthias Miller  36:20
There is a sales order aging that shouldn't be anything.

Unknown Speaker  36:32
That's an email report.

Matthias Miller  36:41
Let me see if our guys own backup, they could still have

Unknown Speaker  36:55
the I

Unknown Speaker  37:09
one other thing i

Matthias Miller  37:45
i see what other processes are, setting the cancelation date.

Matthias Miller  37:54
We don't have a refund. The refund tool doesn't set cancelation date, that's it.

Unknown Speaker  38:14
No but there's no associated refund.

Matthias Miller  38:21
Okay? The big file audit can can cancel it. Big file audit and BP are saying that's good. Let's go take a look. Big file audit. This is the update sales orders and the DPR sync, update any mail sources, update sales orders, 05, slash, 24

Speaker 2  38:51
now the big file audit function that should be should have been disabled or inactivated by Josh quite a few months ago already, or that wouldn't, shouldn't be impacting it. So if that's so it might have been running then we

Matthias Miller  39:16
520 Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right. We just hit it around. It's way back in what 23 that we actually used it,

Unknown Speaker  39:24
I think. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  39:26
yeah, we turn it off in October. Okay, so the BPR sink is the most likely one.

Matthias Miller  39:41
But I'm having these. We don't keep our log files around forever, so I would actually have to go pull an old backup. Let's see what we'd have.

Speaker 2  39:57
I'd say that's that's fine to just. I don't know that. If we see it happen again, you can look at it, but it seems edge case enough that, well, we'll hope it won't happen again and move on. Or I'm fine with that.

Matthias Miller  40:17
Yeah, okay. I mean, if you're fine with that, that's fine, it seems, I mean, the one process I could see is the BPR sync, but you know better than I do, how or why that might have happened.

Speaker 2  40:30
Good. Let's consider it done and something that won't happen again. Credit,

Matthias Miller  40:41
member functionality, let me just

Speaker 2  40:46
Oh, three and four. We've already covered basically, so yeah, or have covered our own on the agenda for for this call. So that's yeah, that's all I had there. Um,

Matthias Miller  40:57
okay, so only sending new the two issues to add was only sending new accounting impact errors. Do we? Do we have accounting impact errors that we do not want to clean up?

Unknown Speaker  41:12
No, we want them all cleaned up. It's just, it's not, it's a little bit dominated,

Speaker 4  41:21
not too much, but I've been trying to do other things, and I just haven't, haven't gotten done yet. And so, you know, we keep getting inbox filled in with the stuff.

Matthias Miller  41:32
Well, it's what if, what if we do this? What if, let's see, send email to three what if we change it to from daily to weekly,

Unknown Speaker  41:44
that would be great. Yeah, on

Unknown Speaker  41:47
do you care which day of week?

Speaker 4  41:50
Um, no, doesn't matter. Probably not the beginning of the week, because I'll tend to brush past at the beginning of the weeks. I got more other things to do. So, Wednesday, Thursday, something like that. Well, actually, yeah, Wednesday, Thursday, we

Matthias Miller  42:18
give some time. Even the other weekend I wrapped up, um, wrapped up. Let's do that. And if it's still annoying or, I mean, once that's done, can you decide whether that's often enough once, once it's cleaned up, we can switch it back to daily.

Speaker 4  42:32
Is is it just if there's something on that report it was sending out, it doesn't go by whether there's new hits or not. Okay. I was thinking it went by, you know, every day if there's something new, it says. So I thought, when I, if I, if nothing new happens, you know, come but

Unknown Speaker  42:58
just doing weekly should be just fine. I think, okay, there's nothing really that that, like the bills will still be there to pay and all that, because that's not in the accounting side. So I think the weekly will be just we'll be fine

Matthias Miller  43:19
if you if you reconcile before in that time frame between the weeks, there's possible, possibility that you'll miss some stuff, but that's, you know, from my standpoint, that's the biggest thing.

Unknown Speaker  43:37
Yeah, well,

Speaker 4  43:40
for the next while we're we're not reconciling right up close anyway, so it wouldn't have chance to show off on a couple weeks and be fixed before we get reconciled.

Matthias Miller  43:53
Good. All right, so then walking you through the cross thing and

Matthias Miller  44:06
you go into, sorry, no, it's actually you go into the builder record, and you

Unknown Speaker  44:15
go in here,

Matthias Miller  44:18
update standard cost. You do this, and it will ask you to save if you need to. When you choose the category, you choose the date, and then you hit, run update standard cost, and it will go, Apply. Apply these standard percentages, right? And the only dates you can choose are ones that don't have actual costs applied to them. So raw materials, it looks like you've already gotten cost applied since the April 1. First. So seven, one, I'm not going to keep this, but actually save an example. If I put this in there, it would, if you click run, it say, hey, you need to save it first before you run. And then you could apply a July 1 forward, because we don't have any anything, any actual costs in July,

Speaker 4  45:38
we would know what they are yet.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
Yeah, fair.

Unknown Speaker  45:52
Why is this one not now? I'm confused. Why is that not showing up? So

Matthias Miller  46:03
uh 16, my update didn't complete. Okay, that's why.

Unknown Speaker  46:14
So this would be done on each and every builder.

Matthias Miller  46:20
Yeah, it would go back. So yeah, for every builder where you need to update the rate, and then it goes out find some buildings for that builder built on or after that date, and assigns a new standard cost,

Unknown Speaker  46:32
which could

Matthias Miller  46:40
potentially update very instance actions, if it's being delivered i

Unknown Speaker  47:06
Yeah, that seems like it makes sense.

Speaker 4  47:09
Now this update like, if a building has been chosen, as you know, freeze standard costs or something like that, will it just override and freeze the new standard cost, or will it stick with the old one?

Matthias Miller  47:30
Um, it does not update the freeze, but it will update the standard cost.

Unknown Speaker  47:56
So what would happen with

Matthias Miller  48:03
should it, I guess it would make sense for it to update the phrase

Speaker 4  48:11
so they would they would not stay frozen to standard costs. They would stay

Matthias Miller  48:20
frozen the standard well, they would stay frozen just the standard cost, but they would stay frozen to the new standard cost.

Unknown Speaker  48:31
Well, Mark, is that correct? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  48:40
or what's the theory behind freezing to standard costs.

Speaker 2  48:49
Okay, can you, can one of you just, I don't know, break it down to one building and explain what this process will do. I mean, I had thought it's working like we I likely intended, or the the manual update that you had done, but I thought did what we intended it to do. But can you just walk me through, looking at one building, a real life scenario,

Matthias Miller  49:19
ABC, one builds a building, and the inventory percentage is seven. We said, no, no, no, no, no, that's not right. As of June 1, inventory percentage should be 7.2 and we run this and it says the building should be seven, seven point the standard cost is 7.2 it's all fine and good. Now the situation is you have a different building from honey bill, and you say their labor and their labor was 16.5 inflation's cost of labor is going up disproportionately. High and their production labor is now 17% so you put in a new row saying, as of June 1, production labor is 17% you see, you say, go update and updates, and everything is fine, no problem. Now you the place where you have a problem is pennyville. Says, no, no, no, no, no, we don't want a frozen labor. We want we're Yeah, we want to switch anytime a builder, you have a building, and the builder switches to or switches away from freezing, freezing labor is actual cost, and when that happens, the buildings during that time period will not update To reflect the frozen, unfrozen nature of that

Speaker 2  51:01
so if we, okay, if, if a builder would make that change, which is, is rare, I ideally we would make that change The very same day in assist, like, make that,

Speaker 5  51:21
um, yeah,

Matthias Miller  51:26
or you would even look ahead and say, Okay, starting, starting August 1 we're going to start freezing labor is at some cost.

Speaker 2  51:35
I mean, the the only places where we freeze labor is, okay, really the only, the only cost were freezing as actual, is when a building is built, is, or it should be, is production labor on buildings that are built at a sub shop where they're paid a percentage off of price of the manufacture, price of the building, which means that, ahead of time, we already know what we want to pay that guy, and the times where it switches from like it's very rare that it would switch from that to being paid like payroll. So I if I'm understanding that correctly, then, then, no, that's, that's a, it's a non issue. I mean, if that were to happen, then you'd still report. You'd still allocate all your costs somewhere. When you out allocate actual costs, you just might have some buildings too cheap and others too expensive. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  53:00
I think we exclude frozen.

Speaker 2  53:07
Yeah, we do. We see we exclude frozen when we apply actual cause.

Matthias Miller  53:13
So you're, if you have any non frozen buildings, they would shift and real, realistically, if we have this issue, then we can go, I mean, yeah, it's again, a little obnoxious, but we can go back and manually clean up those buildings. And, I mean, Dwayne could probably even write report that says, I want to see all honeybuild buildings built in this timeframe that have labor frozen or not frozen and

Unknown Speaker  53:43
and

Unknown Speaker  53:47
then we can either

Unknown Speaker  53:49
write a little bit of a, you know,

Matthias Miller  53:53
you could do a little import that modifies it, or you could, maybe there's few enough that somebody in this office can Just go through and switch them all over? I mean, there's ways out of this, as long as you're aware and you're okay with the implications.

Speaker 2  54:11
Yeah, I'm good here. I think I'm understanding

Matthias Miller  54:22
next. Okay, so that's all that I have on my on my list,

Speaker 2  54:39
all I have as well. So we're no meeting the fourth, obviously, and then we're back normal schedule, the 11, and then off the 18th, back to 25th what I've got listed? I.

Matthias Miller  55:01
And I am going to for the next number of months. I'm not sure exactly how, how long I'm going to need to block out one to 2pm eastern on Thursdays, and we haven't really been using that time anyway, but we have kept open time slots on the calendar. I guess one of the questions would be, how are you guys? Do you want me to keep an open time slot for continued conversation in the afternoon? Can we move it from maybe, maybe 215 to 330 Eastern or,

Speaker 2  55:52
okay, what do we true? We haven't been using it a whole lot, and I don't know. I'm almost tempted to say we could drop it. But what do you think Drew?

Matthias Miller  56:13
Yeah, and then also drop the three apart. I'll keep the three apart.

Speaker 2  56:22
Oh, I thought that okay, what were we talking about? Dropping? Sorry, I was so,

Matthias Miller  56:27
so we, I just had, I don't think we haven't used it in a while, but we had, like a 130 to 130 to three blocked out is kind of an optional time if you need, if we need more time. And we also had an additional three to 330 as kind of a second check in. But things have slowed down enough,

Speaker 2  56:52
I think so I would be comfortable saying the 1030 to 12 on Thursday is, is sufficient and Oh, hang

Unknown Speaker  57:03
on, let me throw another wrench in the gears

Unknown Speaker  57:09
we have.

Matthias Miller  57:13
I don't know, maybe we need to change this. One of our kids has, our son has steep school from I need to leave the office around no later than 1115, probably a little bit before that, which really doesn't give us sufficient time. I don't know what to say.

Unknown Speaker  57:48
Would it? Well,

Speaker 2  57:51
Thursdays are pretty open for me. I could start earlier, or I could do afternoon. I think the 90 minute time frame is, is about right. We could if we plot in 90 minutes somewhere, but

Matthias Miller  58:07
if we would do well for you, if we stay on track like today, we got through the we got through the project updates in 30 minutes. Audra doesn't usually start until 1030 Eastern we could do, I would mind doing like a 930 to 930 to 1030 on any design stuff, and then come back from 1030 to a little past 11 for project management updates.

Unknown Speaker  58:47
That works for me. What about you? Drew,

Unknown Speaker  58:52
yeah, last,

Speaker 5  58:59
okay, yeah. Um, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  59:03
think that should work for me.

Unknown Speaker  59:07
So you want, when you want to start that, start that the 11?

Unknown Speaker  59:12
Yes,

Speaker 2  59:15
okay, so we would start at nine. It'd be 930 to 11, 5011, and what, what is our end time? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  59:26
okay, so we'd start at

Unknown Speaker  59:28
so we would start

Matthias Miller  59:31
just us. Would be 930 to 1030 and then my, I would say, let's try to do project updates from 1030 to 11, and I might have a little bit of margin to go. That gives me a little bit of margin to go a few minutes over. But the plan would be,

Unknown Speaker  59:52
yeah, but then I need to

Matthias Miller  59:57
either wrap up by phone or. Or something like that, if you, if you go too far over, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
that sounds good here, all

Speaker 1  1:00:11
right, and then the three part Thursday, and we'll drop,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:19
yeah, good. Sam. Sounds good. Appreciate

Speaker 4  1:00:27
it. Okay. You had one of the emails you sent me on the sales tax report. We discussed this priority tomorrow was that just a matter of getting on schedule the right place,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
yeah, which we did argument 18,

Speaker 4  1:00:46
okay. And then there was a question

Unknown Speaker  1:00:54
in,

Speaker 4  1:00:58
oh, they're credits, um, credit memo thing. Yeah, basically, I didn't know, notice or know what little triangle meant. You know, there was one assigned to it.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20
I think that would work.

Speaker 4  1:01:23
But just for ease of use, I think a little more something about the memo if it's assigned would be, would be nice, but I don't know how easy that is to do. You know, like credit memo id number or credit amount, especially for the pain side of things, like if we receive the credit on that particular one, it's not that's really not that important. It's not quite as important for visibility as this thing was paid by a random

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
so it could be,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
so we could do something like, let me see if I could just use screenshot and,

Speaker 1  1:02:35
you know, there's a web browser version of Microsoft Paint. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:46
Is it worth using

Matthias Miller  1:02:49
if you if you don't mind if you like paint, it is alright. So it'd be something like, one idea would be something like, I yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:03:16
like show the dollar amount with the credit memo id and one more, if you know, if there's, if there are more than x number of credit memos,

Speaker 4  1:03:31
would this be for which side line ago was used for payment? I

Matthias Miller  1:03:38
mean, we could do it on both sides. We could just drop the ACH payment down

Unknown Speaker  1:03:43
and yeah, that would work.

Speaker 4  1:03:49
Or just say, except received on that one and applied on the other one, or something like that. I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:11
I did not want to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:21
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:04:24
wouldn't you want to see all of them? Do you want to see the total credit memos or just the first one?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
No, I would say all. I mean, that's possible.

Matthias Miller  1:04:34
Could we do something like this, from if it's one, or if it's i

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
Okay, yeah, now we were, we had

Matthias Miller  1:04:48
So Mark, you can't see this, but on the on the vendor invoice show received dollar amount from and if it's a single credit memo id, we would show that credit memo id. Or if it's multiple, then we would, then we would just show from so applied, we just so applied external amount from two credit memos or four credit memos, or however many it came from.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
That's that's

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
pretty reasonable and straightforward, yeah, I guess we could actually, we could actually drop it down underneath here. We would have to rearrange as much.

Matthias Miller  1:05:41
Might be, it might be just as,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
maybe just as clear. Well, yeah, I

Speaker 4  1:05:50
mean, it makes sense to me to have the ACH Payment button down beside the ACH point key there, whatever you call that number, but that doesn't matter.

Speaker 1  1:06:03
Okay, that's right, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:06:08
alright, well, thank you. I think that's pretty much the only thing that was in this that still leads or that didn't have

Speaker 5  1:06:16
a closure to it. That's right. That's okay. All right, sounds good, Yep, thanks. Bye.
