Matthias Miller  00:28
Morning. Good morning

Unknown Speaker  00:38
the

Unknown Speaker  00:58
DREW

Matthias Miller  01:18
All right. So I am working from home this morning we've got sickness, it's making its rounds. And so I think we should be good to go for go for a while here, but might end up needing to drop off at some point. So I had to play it by ear Andre I don't know. Yeah, I guess. I think first thing is just jumping into the project updates

Speaker 1  01:59
bottom as per usual, let's just dive in. So Matthias the first one for you is marks fancy reports Reconciliation Report.

Matthias Miller  02:10
You remind me what, what is left on this? Yeah,

Speaker 1  02:12
let me see. Let's see. Two preference changes. The first one was a prompt button to hide all transaction groupings. And then drew, you're going to try a workaround on that one. Right.

Unknown Speaker  02:28
Yeah, I think we're going to scratch that. Okay.

Speaker 1  02:31
And then a save button for saving edits to the item on the right screen I think is pending.

Matthias Miller  02:37
That's correct. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:40
still pending.

Unknown Speaker  02:41
still pending. Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 1  02:45
Mark documenting the procedure for closing books for 2023.

Unknown Speaker  02:52
No change there

Speaker 1  02:57
Matthias create Uncategorized expense report for general ledger. I

Matthias Miller  03:02
added the line item notes. So I think that's back in true squirt.

Unknown Speaker  03:06
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  03:18
Okay

Speaker 1  03:21
Matthias investigate or create a process for moving payments from one sales order to another. Nothing.

Matthias Miller  03:27
Nothing further on that I was going to talk to Dwayne this morning and I had to cancel that.

Speaker 1  03:35
He still Matthias vendor invoice worn on missing information or add a warning icon. This meant on this as well. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:44
mostly done. But there's some things I need to nail down with Dwayne as far as Pio process

Unknown Speaker  03:50
to see that comments. Again.

Matthias Miller  03:52
Okay. I wasn't able to meet with him this morning. That's fair.

Speaker 1  03:58
All right. Mark, push payroll transactions into assist accounting.

Unknown Speaker  04:06
That's still no change on that

Speaker 1  04:09
change on that. Okay. Let's see, Joel, you just sent in an update on the reconciliation event log, which I can read. Or you can tell us that's up to you.

Speaker 2  04:24
I mean, basically, what's on your screen there. So I have been communicating with the folks who are implementing this in Bangladesh. They're making progress and say they're hoping to get it done. Tomorrow, which is actually our tonight, but there's a chance of bleeding after Monday. So but it sounds like you're optimistic about getting it done. At least by Monday.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Okay

Speaker 1  05:04
drew the Ohio in New York Gristick district deal slash sales order search that review being reviewed still

Unknown Speaker  05:12
yeah no change there.

Speaker 1  05:14
All right. How about the handle payments for multiple Essos?

Unknown Speaker  05:25
Yeah no change on that one either. Okay. I think

Speaker 3  05:36
I think that one there was something to get I think that one's done rarely it had Vyas do any input on that is that one the one we discussed

Matthias Miller  05:48
the discounted payment amount no handle payments for multiple make sure that all multivessel payments yeah I think you were going to make sure that that actually that we were actually enforcing that the multiple so payments following each other

Unknown Speaker  06:04
Oh got it. Yeah, okay yeah no change

Unknown Speaker  06:09
okay

Speaker 1  06:13
all right, the vendor invoice record discount and payment amount fields for Drew um

Matthias Miller  06:30
I believe this is isn't as much change to correctly apply the payment amount when creating checks and other playing for the payments

Unknown Speaker  06:46
we talked to Josh about this this morning and he was going to look into into it but I'm trying to remember if this I mean if this is just saying

Speaker 4  07:06
was this not worth the amount of pay at the bottom of the vendors invoice was not reflecting correctly? Like the

Speaker 3  07:19
I yeah, I think this is talking about not subtracting that discount amount from the total which is correct. I mean, that's it that's what this is talking about. And this has been done and taken care of.

Speaker 1  07:36
Okay. I do have a couple things. I remember I saw an email this week but I wasn't sure what they were related to. So that might be one of them. We'll probably get to those on the incoming just FYI Okay, Messias automatically recurring invoices.

Matthias Miller  07:57
I believe this is

Unknown Speaker  08:09
last email I had

Matthias Miller  08:14
we let's see. Yeah, this is this is back in juice court to make sure the status is getting copied across correctly.

Speaker 3  08:20
Okay. I have some set up. They just need to run so that I can watch them so far so good on this one. Okay.

Speaker 1  08:45
Okay, Drew we have the updated income statement level one show repeating lines. Just making sure this was I believe.

Unknown Speaker  08:59
Only look at that. All right.

Speaker 1  09:02
Enhanced income statement and general ledger. Also for Drew

Unknown Speaker  09:11
would be in the same ballpark. Okay,

Speaker 1  09:13
and then the POS slash bi prompt for amount let's see we were waiting. Oh, that's done. Is that done? Okay.

Matthias Miller  09:24
Yep, that's all good. Okay.

Speaker 1  09:28
We have the updated income statement, the account names wrapping and PDF issue. Also for drew

Speaker 3  09:39
that would be with that same income statement check.

Speaker 1  09:44
Okay, so no change. No change. Okay, good. Okay, for Matthias we make the standard accounting enter transactions available for you to play around with.

Matthias Miller  09:55
That's like, some curious chord to play around with it. It's under accounting accounting tools. Quick transaction entry.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Oh, yeah, I'm ready to use it. It's all good. Oh,

Matthias Miller  10:10
even better?

Unknown Speaker  10:13
Well, two updates for the price of one.

Speaker 3  10:18
Um, maybe I should look at it. There was something

Unknown Speaker  10:38
you want me to leave it open for you?

Speaker 3  10:43
Know, go ahead and close it. Okay. Yeah, go ahead and close it. I think it's all good. There was something that I what I recall was something crossed my mind. And I said, No, that's a bad idea. And right now sounds

Speaker 1  11:02
Mathias, we had sent details to Drew regarding bank to sheets set up,

Matthias Miller  11:08
which is done, but this shouldn't either. I think this should evolve into another task for Drew to see if confirmed that bank to sheets can integrate with everything that we need to integrate with.

Unknown Speaker  11:19
Okay. So we want to create a new one.

Matthias Miller  11:26
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  11:32
Can bank to sheets integrates?

Matthias Miller  11:34
Is that smaller banks? Yeah. Yep.

Speaker 1  11:43
Make sure this is getting where it needs to be. All right.

Speaker 3  11:48
All right. We're waiting to hear from Dwayne on trying to set that thing up. So,

Unknown Speaker  11:53
okay. Sounds good. Let's see you block out time for the Go Live plan.

Matthias Miller  12:07
I'm not sure what all this involves, I did my major rework of accounting impact. And there are a few errors that have been showing up last few nights that haven't had a chance to take a look at. But I have not heard lots of terrorizing screams about things aren't working. The so I think, the beasts, I think we're at the point where we can adjust accounting impact and move it forward to January 1, and effectively freeze historical accounting impact. And the accounting impacts things are now on the on the accounting record.

Matthias Miller  12:50
So I think this is in you guys. I mean, I'm not even sure what what else is required at this point, I guess, but I think it's in your court.

Speaker 3  13:05
So to test that, we would move the accounting impact to January 1, and create a vendor invoice for 23 and try to push it through and what would happen? What should happen?

Matthias Miller  13:27
Nothing. I mean, there's the use of it. Good.

Speaker 3  13:31
Should we get a warning at the time of four?

Matthias Miller  13:40
Well, it depends. Depends on what you want. I guess it's a little complicated because thing, vendor invoices are pretty simple. But things like sales orders have half a dozen different dates that are different events. So we could say that. Yeah, I'm not sure how, how to handle this. Ultimately, you'll catch in reconciliation. But another example would be you had a vendor invoice in 23. They got pushed across to accounting, you move the accounting, the accounting impact effective date to January 1, then you change your invoice date from 23 to 24. The transaction is going to stay stuck in 23. And it's not going to update because you already have that because it's already had its accounting impact event.

Matthias Miller  14:42
Yeah, maybe maybe this thing becomes a do we want to talk through and think through all of the edge cases and scenarios about what might be affected in practice or or do we just want to wait until reconciling cleanup stuff when it happens?

Speaker 3  15:06
Well, I mean, we need to get the reconciles, done before we do it anyway. So it's not like it has to happen now, but probably wouldn't be good to think about some of those edge cases.

Speaker 3  15:26
And what we want to do about them, before we just go and move it. Like, what I'm what I'm would be concerned about would be people just making entries thinking it's getting applied back to 23, or wherever they want it to. And then it actually not happening and never realizing

Matthias Miller  15:48
it. Right.

Speaker 3  15:52
And then reconcile being a big, a big thing of straightening out of mass something, well,

Matthias Miller  16:00
we could put each of these records, we can fairly easily add a warning that says, we look at accounting impact, if there's any of the accounting impact that is historical, say that was part of the then we need to come up with terminology for how we want to communicate that to the person who's entering information so that it makes sense to them, and they know what to do.

Speaker 3  16:24
Yeah, that was that was just kind of a catch all basket.

Matthias Miller  16:29
Yeah, another option would be to give you a report of it's going to be a little bit of a slow report, but we can do it a report of all records that were modified within a specific timeframe that had historical accounting impact over time. And then you can review them and review the changes. It's the show,

Speaker 3  16:54
yeah. Might might be good to have. I would say wait to do that until we actually think about what's gonna happen with like, what should be happening with these things.

Matthias Miller  17:11
Okay, when do you want to have this conversation?

Unknown Speaker  17:19
Next week, right.

Speaker 4  17:23
I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. Thursday, so we're moving to Thursday next week? Yeah, next Thursday.

Unknown Speaker  17:37
Awesome. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Um, is missing new check button.

Matthias Miller  17:51
Yes, working. Okay. But I'm also making some changes, but I'm sure somebody will complain if it doesn't work after, after the next update.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
So are we calling this in review or closed?

Matthias Miller  18:09
Through I guess it's up to you. Historically, we were saving the district on the check. And I think it makes more sense to stick stay the accounting company on the check in for the district from the accounting company. And I think it might be some actually put it in progress, because I think so the IRS that I have are related to this. The nightly reconcile errors. Okay.

Speaker 3  18:37
I think I'd sent you an email about it was receiving on creating checks, just regular checks, where it said something about an error about the district not being created. So I was probably yes, it is.

Unknown Speaker  18:51
So it's not done. Yep. Okay, sounds good. Allow a patching statements to reconciles.

Matthias Miller  19:01
That's bundled out to mid February because we don't even have the first round of reconciles, done.

Speaker 1  19:10
All right. vendor invoices do not match accounting.

Matthias Miller  19:14
That's still no change. Okay,

Speaker 1  19:18
sounds good. That brings us to February. Let me scroll down and see what we added this week. Okay, so we had a new ad budget columns to income statements. Joel Tim added this and he said he got an email from you. So I wasn't sure if this was actually a separate task, but it has a separate incident now. So is this related to something that's currently happening? Yes,

Speaker 2  19:44
that is something that Mark Andrew had raised. Okay. Last week.

Unknown Speaker  19:52
All right. Do we have a gold date for this?

Speaker 2  19:55
We had said mid February right.

Speaker 1  20:01
Okay. Sounds good. Okay, so I think you might have just mentioned this drew in the checks to print page, the company prompt seems to not be filtering. Is this related to the task already in progress? Should I merge it? Or is the second?

Speaker 3  20:26
I think that's taken care of that. That makes sense with us.

Matthias Miller  20:30
It should be. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:32
Yeah. I think it's done.

Unknown Speaker  20:34
I think it's done. Okay. Great.

Speaker 1  20:44
Okay, so this is capturing a lot of email activity this week. So it says last time, I tried to enter a different contact for a different line item into a transaction, it wouldn't let me Could we have that functionality? This was the email

Speaker 3  20:56
that Gary have. Is it okay. Yep. Is that something new Matthias, that functionality? Or was it was not doing something right the first time?

Matthias Miller  21:09
I don't know. Maybe it was a solar flare. That was

Speaker 1  21:18
all right. So there's a long one on the budget item? Would it work to put a budget amount on a parent account was the issue. I believe you're discussing this with Joel right, Matthias, is this in progress?

Speaker 2  21:31
So 10 minutes before the call, I sent the response. Okay, so.

Speaker 2  21:44
Well, I guess, in progress, there is a question about how to how to deal with the child accounts. But that's probably not for this portion of the Golden slip right.

Matthias Miller  22:04
Now, let's, let's maybe, let's get to the project updates. And then let's maybe circle back through design discussions that we need to have with sure stuff.

Speaker 1  22:12
Would this be a January issue? Or what are we looking at for priority?

Unknown Speaker  22:21
The budget report out sorry, go ahead, please.

Speaker 4  22:24
Well, I have the same deadline as the other the mid February. Okay. I think, yeah, it was good.

Speaker 1  22:39
Budgeting are actually balance sheet accounts and not income statement, we would need a report pull for many selected accounts for the time period, rather than an income statement. Is this a pending issue? needs to be talked about?

Matthias Miller  22:55
Yeah, it's discussed. All right.

Speaker 1  22:57
Is this a January issue? Or do we have a timeframe?

Unknown Speaker  23:02
Also be mid mid February

Speaker 1  23:11
let's see we've got Bank Ledger reports. Came through an email. See, it's this one? Is this something that already exists?

Matthias Miller  23:27
That I think

Unknown Speaker  23:29
I think that's a I suggest we remove it here until we figure out

Speaker 4  23:38
for sure. One's internal and then bring it back up. If need be. Okay, so yeah, I was. Okay.

Matthias Miller  23:48
Did you guys get my email with a few random ideas about how we could potentially address this?

Unknown Speaker  23:55
Um, I don't recall.

Matthias Miller  23:57
I think it started drafting it and maybe never sent it off

Speaker 1  24:07
okay, well, I will take it out of our out of our report here. The 1099 summary report is an incoming incidents. Is there anything I need to update here? When you take a look at it.

Matthias Miller  24:27
We had a their emails associated with this.

Speaker 1  24:29
I think I pulled it right from here.

Matthias Miller  24:33
Target February to fill in. Okay, Henry. I would like it. I would like my target to be before the 15th so that it's on my radar before then. All right. We've got some time for revisions like the second user first. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  24:53
Sounds good. Okay, I thought these were probably things we might need. To merge, there was drew you were reviewing this Uncategorized and Canada Uncategorized expenses issue. I assumed this was one that's already on our radar, but I didn't recognize the terminology. So what is this one actually?

Unknown Speaker  25:20
Looks like this one.

Speaker 3  25:22
Yeah, yeah, that's the same one as before, and I just had pulled it up and it's all done.

Unknown Speaker  25:29
Okay. What was it called though? Um, do you remember?

Speaker 3  25:38
has categorized expense? Last name is?

Matthias Miller  25:41
Yeah, that would be the search term to use.

Speaker 1  25:46
Is it for the general ledger? Yeah. Okay. And then probably similar with this one, just terminology, issue, vendor invoices, make sure the check amount was other payment method amounts are correct. Is this related to the check issue? Or?

Unknown Speaker  26:15
Which one?

Unknown Speaker  26:18
Yeah, that is. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  26:26
I knew that task was something was very short term. It was something about discounting NBI amount or something like that. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  26:37
This one, that one? Yeah. Okay, perfect. Thanks.

Speaker 3  26:41
These were already in there. So, oh, that one finished as well. Okay.

Speaker 1  26:46
Yeah, when I merge it in, it'll, it'll disappear. So I will make sure that gets finished. I think that's it. This is a new one we just added. And I think that should be all for me.

Matthias Miller  27:01
Okay, so the two items for us to discuss with Joel is the budget on parent accounts in the budget and the budget for balance sheet. Accounts are for acid assets and liabilities. Okay. Good. Is that

Unknown Speaker  27:20
these two? Yes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  27:30
And then I guess

Matthias Miller  27:37
I have not caught I mean, I feel like I'm a little bit behind on some of my email correspondence, but I will catch up on that sometime today if I can. Good. Okay, should it? Well, is

Speaker 1  27:53
there anything else you need for me? Are we are we doing these two items withdrawal? Or what was the intention there? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:58
I think you can drop off and we'll decide what needs to be done. Perfect. I mean, it's just a design discussion. I don't think hang around for that.

Speaker 1  28:06
Great. All right. Well, have a wonderful meeting. I will talk to you guys later. Thanks. Bye.

Speaker 2  28:16
All right. So on this on the budget, item, even mention the value of budgeting on parent accounts versus trying to drill on to each child account and, you know, figure out how much is meals and entertainment, how much is is this and that? And I definitely see the value.

Matthias Miller  28:44
So

Speaker 2  28:48
I think one of the biggest questions is How do you want to deal with child accounts in that case? Should we try to enforce that? No child account has a budget entered if a parent account does Are we okay with saying if travel expenses has a budget of 1000 child account has a budget of 250? I mean, sorry? No. Travel Expenses has a budget of 1000. You spend 250, and meals and expenses. Do you want to see if you run a budget report and and show meals and expenses. Do you want to show a blank? Do you want to show a 250 over run on that?

Speaker 4  29:44
Well, I think as basic so starting out, we're going to use it yeah, pretty basic, like this, the selecting the main accounts for budgeting, at least for the first year. So I feel like We, this is something we'll want to look at later. But for right now, I feel like we probably shouldn't put any energy into this right now just plan that it's just a one to one like this, we enter the values of the budget for child accounts. And we just, we don't even further pursued is to do parent accounts at this point, would you mean Oh,

Speaker 3  30:27
yeah, with that. So if if a number would be entered for a parent account? Would that not be dangerous, say, don't allow anything in the in the trial accounts then? Or? Like, would that be similar? If we just go ahead, if we say, we want this match in this account, it will just ignore anything in any child accounts below? That there's a different

Speaker 2  31:06
there's the question. Okay, so, so right now with no changes, I believe what you could do, if, if you're absolutely, I only care about the parent account, you could say, Okay. Well, my total budget for travel expenses, I want to be 1000. I'm going to search right now, you can't enter that on travel expenses, you could enter 1000 on travel expenses, meals and entertainment. And if you run a report at the parent level, and where you're showing travel expenses, but not meals and entertainment, we can show you Okay, your but your total budget for travel expenses, which is actually your total budget for the child account sub travel expenses, is 1000. You spent this much under that. Now, if you actually spent $300 on travel expenses, lodging, then if you run that report on the child accounts, they're going to show, okay, you spent nothing, nothing out of $1,000 in meals and entertainment, you spent 300 out of zero in lodging. But if you care only about the parent, you can work around it right now.

Speaker 3  32:48
So yeah, so for right now, you couldn't even enter for a parent account, you just have to put the full amount on the child.

Speaker 2  32:57
Right. Right. So it's relatively easy to I think, I have not dived into the code. But I think it's relatively easy to, to change it. So you can enter in an album a parent account. But then the question is, do we then prohibit any entries on child accounts? I think that's the simplest approach. Although we have to figure out do we deal with when you're reporting on child accounts, are those overruns? Or are they just blank? If you if you have $1,000 on travel expenses, and if you enter $500 on travel expenses, meals and entertainment, but you leave lodging and transportation blank. Now, if we say we want to allow that, then the complexity increases. Because how do you deal with that allocation?

Speaker 4  34:07
I think I think we should start this year with exactly what we have. And then think about I think if we move to anything beyond that, it should be if you enter what you just described the simpler version where you have to monitor the child account or on a parent account that that you no longer can enter on the child accounts underneath that. Sure. Yeah, I think that's the going beyond that what will introduce complexity that probably be unhelpful so be Yeah, it's it let's let's leave what we have right now it will probably, you know, as we use it, we'll probably, if we want to change it up towards the end of the year, and then I See is going on.

Speaker 2  35:02
Okay, so to be clear right now you're saying you'll enter $1,000 on travel expenses, meals and entertainment, but you'll be reporting on travel expenses, and the budget total expenses under that.

Unknown Speaker  35:24
Yeah, that's probably how it worked most times,

Speaker 4  35:26
we yeah, we would enter on the expenses would be recorded on the exact same account as he were the budget numbers or anything. Like if we,

Speaker 2  35:39
when we, okay, okay. Okay. So I think I misunderstood or made better inferences. So basically your your budget amounts, you may actually split up the travel expenses, budgets across the three sub sub accounts as, as you described earlier. And just recognize that well, it may slip and slide between among those three child accounts, but travel expenses overall is still going to be okay.

Speaker 4  36:16
Yeah, and the reason we asked the question was like, Well, you know, what could be done? Yeah, yeah, completely.

Speaker 2  36:25
Okay. So, oh, good.

Speaker 3  36:28
So if those are broken out to those three trial accounts, if you report on just the parent level, will then add those three together as Yes. Some budget for that. Parent? Yes. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 4  36:44
So, maybe function same as the income statement and balance sheet like Adam, it would roll them all together. Okay. Got it. Okay.

Matthias Miller  36:56
Do you have a date when you want to circle back to this? Or do you just want to bring it back?

Speaker 4  37:03
It might be wise to just schedule them, you know, circle back to this. End of q3. end of September. Okay.

Matthias Miller  37:18
Sounds good. All

Unknown Speaker  37:19
right. So you have

Matthias Miller  37:21
to make sure that you call make sure that gets updated. All right, then. The other issue just for context. So when a building is to manage to handle production labor as an example, and inventory, we have a a, actually, Martin probably explain it better. But we use asset accounts for labor that go into buildings in progress, and then push that across. And so technically, it's money being spent. But it's in an asset account, right?

Speaker 2  38:06
It's not it's spent, but it's not expensed. It's, it goes into the asset from which it will be expensed as it as it's finally sold. And

Speaker 4  38:19
add to that the one of the biggest areas where we want to use this is for capital expense, like how much are we going to spend on capital expenses on equipment or whatever? Those are, obviously, assets as well. So sure, like, so that's why the question, you know, do we have, is there just a budget, a report that looks at budget,

Unknown Speaker  38:41
versus

Speaker 4  38:44
costs incurred? So far, are like going to be? So obviously, the budget you want? column? And then the other column would simply be looking at what were the expenses for this account so far this year? Or if you so if you took capital expenses, let's say we, we say we're going to spend 50,000 a month on capital purchases per month. So you get to you're looking at it budget report, year to date and say first quarter 50,000. That'd be the budget was saying we plan to spend 150,000 over these three months. And then we'd want the second column to reflect the actual expenses to that account. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 2  39:50
Okay, so I have several questions coming to mind. And so one is mechanical. And when you're dealing with an expense account, you know, the natural flow of things is pretty obvious. You've got I mean, you expect money to be flowing out. And you budget according to the expected outflows. In these we're talking inventory accounts, right, essentially

Speaker 3  40:38
going to be like property, plant and equipment as well.

Unknown Speaker  40:46
Wait, you were

Speaker 3  40:57
and then somehow we have to figure out for the given time period, what are our what are our debits to this account?

Speaker 2  41:10
I mean, that's not hard to do. If if we can strictly say, Hey, we're looking at at the debits I can't say with certainty that I mean, without thinking through that, that will give you the information you're wanting. So are so I guess that is the other the other question that was coming to mind. And that is just what I, you know, analytically or for management. What is the the goal of these budgets? I mean, of budgeting to these accounts? So you're talking? I'm hearing? Well, okay, my initial thought was, you're talking about

Speaker 2  42:17
allocation of fixed costs, attributed to goods produced into inventory. But so there

Speaker 2  42:39
I mean, it will be a very direct function of production quantity. But then for PP and E. Are you basically saying

Speaker 2  43:00
you're budgeting your capital investment? Does that? Or

Unknown Speaker  43:06
I would say, yeah, that's,

Speaker 4  43:07
I mean, that's one area. Like, we, when we talked about this last week, we were looking at it compared to what happened on the income statement, which. But then we realized that the income statement, you know, wouldn't show us the capital expenses, or it wouldn't show us the, like, the material purchases or the labor that we're posting to assets until the building sells to asset accounts. So yeah, what the intent is to, you know, say how much can we set the budget? How much? You know, are we expect them to spend on trailers on property, plant and equipment throughout the year? And then set those amounts and then have a way to measure? You know, where are we against that? So we get to September, and someone says, We need a new forklift. And we have data that we can say well, we're we're already 50,000 over our budget for capital expenses are well yeah, we're under under

Unknown Speaker  44:27
severe you're talking more of a cache a cache issue really correct.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Yeah, yeah, it is for that.

Unknown Speaker  44:42
Um

Speaker 2  44:49
Okay, I think I'm starting to get close to this on the on the inventory side for buildings.

Unknown Speaker  45:06
You're concerned they're cash as well. Because we're actually if we're matching then it would actually seem appropriate to

Speaker 2  45:33
to deal with the accrual basis expenses, which would yet when you sell, but so I guess I guess there again, is the question. What, what sort of decisions are you hoping to inform? With, with budgeting against? Expenses going into inventory?

Unknown Speaker  46:04
There will be the cash side cash spent?

Speaker 4  46:09
Yeah, I mean, so starting out, it's going to be pretty basic, it's going to be, yeah, there's that like, cash, looking at property, plant and equipment. And then also on the SS, just like on the income statement, expenses that hit that directly, like sales expenses, how much are we going to going to allocate to, say, opening? How much can how much are we going to allocate for the sales manager to spend on deals or training or, or opening new lots or things that those would be items that we're going to say that, you know, will allocate 250,000 to opening new sales lots. And then that's what the sales manager has to work with. So that we can do a comparison on what we budgeted versus actual. Oh, then, I mean, that's, that's the first phase I could see as you know, beyond this year, then moving to doing it for, you know, close all of the accounts, including, like the cost of goods and the revenues, you know, it would allow us to model out budget numbers for basically all categories. And say, you know, if, if this happens, you know, here's what our bottom line is going to be. Here's where we know if this happens. Like we budgeted we expect to end the year at you know, this bottom line number here's how we're going to get there is that's state or phase two, I would say but yeah.

Speaker 2  48:26
So the easy quick and I'm not sure right answer is I don't think it would be hard to enter to a have the ability to to enter budgets on I guess basically asset accounts and be report on debit flows on debits total debits for those accounts over a period against those budget numbers.

Speaker 2  49:18
My My concern is being ambushed by a transactions that well, basically that would would turn the total debits for those accounts into something that we aren't actually expecting. And I mean, that's not comparable to budget numbers. But I mean, you're you're more familiar with your numbers than I am. And your accounting entries is that a concern we can dismiss or

Speaker 4  50:06
so we wouldn't have. Okay, I think what we're basically asking for is for assets, we want to track all debits, which would be all expenses hitting asset accounts. For expenses section, we will be looking at all debits to expense as well. For the revenue section in the income statement, we would want to track all credits, to revenue and like those three, I think those are really the only three that at least, you know, for this year that we're wanting to look at budgeting. So we would say budget numbers for some of the asset accounts like the the main asset accounts, like PPE, property, plant equipment, and suddenly so and then on the revenue, we'd like to set, you know, expected revenue numbers. And on the expenses, just some of the primary expenses, like sales it out? Sure. And I think what you're asking is, so any issue that seems straightforward, just like look at all debits on assets, and expenses, and all credits on revenue, but are there other things that that our system will do automatically, that will give us that will? I'm thinking on the expensive side, I think that's going to be pretty straightforward as far as debits to the expense, I can't think of a lot of automatic things that would happen in that section. At the revenue section, I could, you know, I could see system automatic recurring transactions, because we entered something wrong some words that you know, you've sold 20 buildings, but we actually didn't and it Excuse me? I don't know what what's your thought to on? Are we are we?

Speaker 3  52:07
I think those are because in reconciling our statements, because then, hey, we didn't actually sell these, there's no.

Speaker 4  52:18
Well, I think you're the one thing

Speaker 3  52:21
that I thought of is that would affect the asset accounts would be what if we sell, like going to example. He says, what we sold the forklift, you know, does that those 15,000 For that forklift? Does that give us the space? To now purchase the new one? Like, do we need to include credits to probably plant equipment? That we can say, Okay, this was sold. You know, and it's like, credits that got turned back into cash. For the inventory ones, I don't think that's what you want him to do. On on

Speaker 4  53:09
the the assets like the forklift example, I don't think we would want to do that when we said good numbers. I think we just want to say, here's what we're playing the money, we're playing the layout for new equipment, then if that would happen, then we have two choices one, either just know that that's what happened or go in and change the button. Now, so.

Speaker 2  53:40
Okay, so So I think that's one one question answered. So, so you're talking strict one sided debits? On these accounts, you aren't talking that debits to the account, but but just double up the debit side of all transactions? And if there are credits we ignore? Yes.

Speaker 4  54:19
Yeah. I mean, we're going to use it in such basic fashion. The first year that I Yeah, I'd say we try it and, you know, we'll soon see if it's

Speaker 2  54:34
sure. And okay, so, so that's for the assets. Wait, is that for all assets?

Speaker 4  54:46
Well, the the inventory, like the inventory, raw materials, the materials we're purchasing is an asset. It's the way we're treating it. And that could get really complicated because because When we do our month in inventory account, there's we say, Oh, the accounting system says we have 500,000. But we actually counted 600,000. So what happened said 600,000 increase like that, or the 100,000 increase? So that would be I think that would be a debit to the inventory, and would create conflicting information, because then you would say, I don't see us budgeting for that right now. And even if we do, as long as we have a ledger report that we can say, these budget numbers are, like, we're showing, why are we showing? We bought so much that we have a ledger account that we can go and say, these are all purchases, but these you know, this was an inventory adjustment. So I don't know is that

Unknown Speaker  56:10
mean, one thing we could do is maybe this would be maybe we should identify the account? Or at least a sampling of the accounts. We're hoping to budget? Well, sure. For each one of those,

Speaker 4  56:30
like PPE or raw materials inventory and say, here's what happened on the general ledger, there's, you know, there's all these automatic debits, there's no way we're going to do what we thought we could or we're going to say, well, this, this should be pretty straightforward. I don't know, would that be a good approach or not?

Unknown Speaker  56:56
I think it'd be I think it'd be good if you can take a look and say,

Speaker 2  57:04
Yeah, see, especially. You know, are we happy with dealing with strictly one sided debits? Are we happy with

Unknown Speaker  57:17
net debits? Is there is there another lens we should be looking at this through?

Unknown Speaker  57:35
Because it sounds like a lot is I mean, well, the intent is especially on PP and E, you know, it's you want to to plan your cash outflow for investments and in these areas

Unknown Speaker  58:03
for

Unknown Speaker  58:10
well, okay, and so now in inventory.

Unknown Speaker  58:19
Um,

Speaker 2  58:23
isn't the core thing that you're trying to control simply? Inventory size, because you're, you've, you've already made the cash decisions for your capital assets. I mean, those are, those are spend any allocations maybe going into inventory, but but your cash impact is going to be you know, labor materials.

Speaker 2  59:06
Okay, but no, you're okay, here's where I should back off and let you analysis,

Speaker 3  59:16
it would be like, we would not be budgeting finished goods inventory, other than, like, the labor that goes into it. And then it would be raw materials inventory. So we're not, we're not budgeting the raw materials that go into finished goods, because, like you said, that's already. There's no cash transaction even happening there. It will be the payments going into those paychecks to make it happen. The raw materials being purchased. Those would be the items that I would think

Matthias Miller  59:53
would be budgeted. Sure, sure. Yeah.

Speaker 3  59:56
You know, so not all inventory is even gone. be budgeted, because some of it doesn't fit.

Speaker 2  1:00:05
Sure. Well, so I think maybe generally rather than my sitting outside and trying to guess, then I think what you proposed is this good. Look at all the different categories of accounts that

Unknown Speaker  1:00:26
you think you may want to budget. Figure out are we talking one sided debits, net debits, something else? That's important. And then then we can talk more intelligently about what we actually know about what what will be helpful for you.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
Then on that end,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
nice, I think yeah.

Speaker 2  1:01:18
Oh, actually, maybe I should ask Wonderful question on the expenses. Is it pretty? So there? Are you thinking net expenses, or one sided? Or sorry, net debits or one sided?

Speaker 4  1:01:41
On the expenses, you would? What is the term mean? You would you would look at those, I think you would look at expense the same as you look at expenses on the income statement like this the sum total of your debits and credits, because you're sure, because you the only credits you would have to an expense account would be like, refunds, or? Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:02:09
Because those Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Excellent. And that, I think that's how it's running. But given the conversation I wanted to make sure.

Speaker 4  1:02:19
Yeah, this gets more complicated than I thought, because, like on inventory, you, you basically on inventory, you want it. And we're treating it as an asset you expect to, if you look at net there, we basically are going to end the year with the same level of inventory, you start at the you, like you might start the year with $2 million worth of inventory by $10 million worth throughout the year, but still Lanthier at 2 million. So if you Yeah, if you use the net there, then budgeting gonna look really good. You budget 10 million for materials and be spent. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:02:57
I mean, one thing that came to mind, and I'm not sure if it serves your needs, but you know, is simply monitoring inventory level. If cash is, is the main thing you're looking at then I mean, as you said, you're turning through. So inventory level is going to be the the use or source of cash.

Speaker 4  1:03:33
But I'm wondering now, we did some unusual things for it for tracking inventory like which you normally don't do on the balance sheet where we have where we have a section of basically expense accounts. So you start zero those out at the end of every year and then to break room supplies. So in production overhead, you might have 10 different accounts, break room supplies, you start that with zero throughout the year as you buy coffee, you add that to the break room supplies and that increases all throughout the year. But then we have a contra account that every time a building is built, it takes out standard costing or a portion of

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
it we'll have to look at some general ledger breakdowns the different ones who are wanting to see and then yeah, I think then we can make more informed decisions. Sure, sure. Well,

Speaker 2  1:04:43
definitely the fact that he tells. So cool, well embed there again, we're talking on the on the balance sheet side it sounds like so how So, our story on expense budgeting expense account budgeting is still simple well and on and on revenue budgeting now debits for expenses net credits for revenue via zoom and and got that that story simple so we can go with that and and wait for input on from you on on balance sheets

Speaker 4  1:05:36
so are you seeing that the showing the budget numbers on the income statement? Nothing changes there you can stay the course as far as development there

Unknown Speaker  1:05:45
yes I believe so.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:47
Perfect. Good

Speaker 3  1:05:54
good few items from the title

Unknown Speaker  1:05:58
I think we

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
do. Do we have it's before we wrap it up? Do we have a timeline for the or is this this is predominantly going to be entry in recording. Is there a timeline for these budget changes being live?

Speaker 2  1:06:18
We were talking about in mid February I believe. Got it. Awesome. Good. Okay, well, thank you much and I guess I'll draw

Matthias Miller  1:06:31
awesome thanks Joe.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:33
Good talking with you get

Unknown Speaker  1:06:43
the email from last week there was the

Speaker 3  1:06:53
what do you call it? Oh this No. Oh, the conditional notes. Yeah, I'm getting to it. Yes, the conditional notes on those recurring invoices. So the idea was they're like if the note says this is March rent how are we going to then April say this is April's rent now the reason I'm even concerned about it is because the date of the invoice for the February for the for paying rent for February, that invoice will be dated January. So there's always this which month is this for? That people aren't keeping it straight? So it's nice to be able to say hey, this is for the February rent

Matthias Miller  1:07:56
and and then the clarify on the vendor invoice this would be going into the going into the notes or is it going is there somewhere else where this would go?

Speaker 3  1:08:07
Alright. It was I think it was just in the notes. I mean, that's what I was putting out maybe there's a better field or that

Matthias Miller  1:08:19
that is necessarily so one thing that we could do is ya know x 120 we could allow you to specify an expression that

Matthias Miller  1:08:37
I guess what would you rather references things off the vendor invoice and populates the notes off of that so you just look at the vendor invoice date that's probably actually the row or just notes that reference the is there anything else that you'd want to reference in your in your notes besides the date of the invoice probably not.

Speaker 3  1:09:12
I haven't come upon anything that I want and I mean and this thing of being able to name which month something is for is the only thing I can think of that we would need this conditional upon for this

Speaker 3  1:09:38
but that's that those will be driven by week so on so either way the date should tell us there.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:44
Oh, yeah, that was the one book that Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:55
That's the only case that I can think of. Is

Speaker 4  1:09:57
there you could put clarify rather than just issuing payment every Friday, like on this Friday, and then having the question which we will look for, you can say in the notes, guaranteed payment for we have

Unknown Speaker  1:10:17
invoice date.

Speaker 4  1:10:21
Say the invoice date is going to be the way you've set it up the invoice date is going to like,

Speaker 3  1:10:27
for that guaranteed payment. Yes, it's, it's an automatic transaction happening from the bank. So so I just said that for the day of the payment going out. So it shouldn't be just like a paycheck, you know? Oh, it's this paycheck for the state. So obviously the payment is for before

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
that for the week before. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:51
So and I think there's, I mean, there's two ways we can do this, when we give you the ability to put in an expression and you can do anything you want to with the as of date to put in your, your customized notes. That's option one. Option two is just notes that explain how it works. So this invoice is is a rent payment for the month following the invoice date. And it's not automatic. It's just an explanation it gets copied onto there. I don't really have anything that's kind of a little better.

Speaker 4  1:11:36
There Yes. With the expressions, it seems like there could be it's there's more things that could go sideways, probably with the expression. I don't know. Yeah, I kind of just, it's a little neater, more self explanatory and all that. But the other one does the same thing without a lot of frills.

Speaker 3  1:12:05
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that simpler is an expression that just, I mean, use a description or whatever that just says, Here's how to figure out which month this is. And probably the better.

Speaker 4  1:12:25
Anyway, but I think that seems like that would be a little more trouble for you.

Speaker 3  1:12:30
is, if this isn't a notes on the invoice, is it going to be on the check stub? Or where we're seeing this invoice isn't the aggregate extent anywhere? What I'm what I'm concerned about is whatever hits the check stub.

Speaker 4  1:12:48
That's a good point. Because on the landlord's side, we want there to be no,

Speaker 3  1:12:55
right, that's what I want them to know. And if, if this little expression hits that description hits the check stub, but the well, the check date should still be before the month

Speaker 4  1:13:12
what you really want is on the check stub the memo to say December rent.

Speaker 3  1:13:18
Yeah, that's what I want. Well, I mean, or it could say rent payment for month following date of Jack, you could say something like that as long as we're actually issuing the checks

Matthias Miller  1:13:37
at the end of the month Yeah. Otherwise they come back to you. So why did you pay March but not February I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:13:48
on demand how many

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
how many of these types of things do you have? Where this nice to be able to check?

Speaker 3  1:13:58
Um, I don't know. How many of you think it was actually on the check before? I mean, we really don't know if this is even been on the check. I have no idea and he has

Unknown Speaker  1:14:10
some of them are ACH payments. So yeah,

Speaker 3  1:14:12
there's there's probably a dozen or so of these checks that go out monthly. Like it's more than what I want to remember to go change memos.

Matthias Miller  1:14:28
Well, I so here is here's how I would approach it in that case is that you have a if you can figure out we have this

Unknown Speaker  1:14:56
new address.

Matthias Miller  1:15:04
Because memo is really unique.

Speaker 3  1:15:09
Um, there would not have to be in the memo. On the check stub, we are referencing the invoice number and the amount of that invoice so we can load from the invoice or something from the invoice in the line there on the stuff is that

Matthias Miller  1:15:32
could we could we have the vendor invoice? ID, the automatically generated vendor invoice Id be include

Matthias Miller  1:15:50
here we specify the written there

Speaker 3  1:15:56
like the invoice number would would say that this is maybe where I ran. Yeah. Even if it's generate, even if the data was genuine.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:09
Yeah, maybe

Matthias Miller  1:16:15
let me check something here? Or do you remember offhand how these get these get generated? Why am I not seeing any?

Speaker 3  1:16:28
Ah, no, I was again through and deleted because they were duplications. And

Matthias Miller  1:16:35
that's why they

Speaker 3  1:16:39
I think they just say, auto generated or something like that in turn about so long, it doesn't fit in most of the boxes.

Matthias Miller  1:16:52
Let's do Okay, so here's what we could do. We could give you an expression that allows you to specify the vendor invoice ID. And here, let me let me let me let me get even get more specific than what the I was used to.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
Displaying as the first three digits of the month, and the hour 21, the UN, whatever. And then you could

Matthias Miller  1:17:34
that is, that is the other thing we could do, we could have a few built in formats. So vendor invoice and just have a drop list of options that might actually be better. So it might be let me I'm still trying to find one thing here. We said that

Speaker 4  1:17:55
this would make it a lot easier rather than trying to meet so that these checks and all these texts, or the notes on the memo field, they would it would keep doing what it's doing or it shows the invoice on the back.

Matthias Miller  1:18:09
Like I mean, one option would be just to make this a drop list and your options would be something like

Matthias Miller  1:18:28
I don't even I wish I could remember today's date. Ie 2024 Dash, one dash 24 And I don't know how you want to do this or maybe it's like

Matthias Miller  1:18:47
yeah, following month. I invoice 20 2402 And then we come up with whatever kind of standard standard invoice autogenerated invoice and use that you would want to use. And then and then there's not really much chance of anybody messing it up. Right, right.

Speaker 3  1:19:17
I think that would work. If you do today's day, following month, and current month

Matthias Miller  1:19:29
and current month. Yeah, I

Speaker 3  1:19:32
think that would work. And then I would do like but put the the abbreviation of the month like FVb for February in there. Like that. Like that. Yeah, I think that work, and even the today's date, I would just drop the 20th beginning

Matthias Miller  1:20:03
Do you want the 20? At the beginning of these?

Speaker 3  1:20:06
Um, yeah, because it's not a date, per se. So we don't want him to think it's February 24. Right. I think that would work. Do we want something that tells us that this is auto generated? Like, a suffix of ag or something? I don't know? Or is, is that format used anywhere else?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
I mean, there's what we have there. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:20:43
I mean, a payment, or commissions, AP uses the person's initials and the date, I think, I think we're okay with this. I think this will be distinct from what he uses for that.

Speaker 4  1:21:05
Now, we're going to use this, we have to add something else, or we're going to have duplicates, duplicate invoice numbers for like, we have 1.14 That would be the same for all. While landmarks would be paying.

Matthias Miller  1:21:25
Could we put a well, we could put the vendor invoice definition number of beginning so four dash

Matthias Miller  1:21:44
something like that.

Speaker 4  1:21:48
Where is the Forge is something that drew sets when he creates a recurring invoice. It

Matthias Miller  1:21:52
would it's automatically assigned to the system

Speaker 4  1:21:57
that the vendor number that Josh uses 20 like that. But that's tracked on the context.

Matthias Miller  1:22:05
Why wasn't thinking even the vendor? We couldn't make it be the vendor number if you prefer, I was thinking the actual each individual recurring vendor invoice has an ID. Oh, perfect. So if you have six for the same vendor, then you'd have six different IDs that would get prefixed?

Speaker 4  1:22:20
Yeah, now this is much so these would never be duplicated. One more of the five. What? Yeah, this? Yeah. I think this would be on that word.

Matthias Miller  1:22:33
Okay. Do you want hyphens in between the words readability or just leave it as is?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42
I would think as it is right there.

Matthias Miller  1:22:46
Sorry, which, just like that? Um

Unknown Speaker  1:22:56
Oh, yeah. Yeah, leave it like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:01
We would not have the IMB that right. Just have?

Speaker 3  1:23:03
Sure. Is remote off? And

Matthias Miller  1:23:09
should we had this first part to a certain number of digits? Or just let it?

Speaker 4  1:23:21
Maybe, yeah, my tear before? Because Are we ever going to go more than 99?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:28
Not in a day. I mean,

Speaker 4  1:23:34
these are going to be set on each recurring vendor invoice. Right. Now

Matthias Miller  1:23:39
these will be no, I'm sorry, this is your let me let me share my screen and explain a little bit what I'm talking about. Not up to you.

Speaker 3  1:23:50
But this was you're saying we only take the last two digits have that number. Like, right,

Matthias Miller  1:23:56
so if it would be well, we would always be the full ID. So anytime we create one for 3045 Clemens LLC, the ID would be 15. And then it happens on the first of the month when it's rent. So it'd be current probably current month in this case, I don't know how it is. Right. So it'd be one five dash 2024

Unknown Speaker  1:24:20
ft B.

Matthias Miller  1:24:23
And everything every vendor invoice. Based on this recurring expense would have a one to five prefix mini Lin or min menlyn, on the other hand would be would have a 01 prefix. So every single requirement or invoice be 01 Dash, whatever the date is. So that way you would know.

Speaker 3  1:24:51
Right? Yeah, that would probably require three because who knows what'll happen? Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
And And I mean, the nice thing about that is then if you look at a vendor based on a vendors invoice, you know that 004 is all the rent payments and 000 17 is? I don't know, whatever it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
Yeah, sounds good to me.

Matthias Miller  1:25:18
I think it's pretty elegant. Okay.

Speaker 3  1:25:32
That was the only thing remaining on that. Yeah. Did you get the case of the missing checks?

Matthias Miller  1:25:45
Yeah, I did I have not had a chance to take a look. Oh, it changed. Oh, that's not good. Wednesday, last Wednesday. What was it doing last? Account transaction reference. So we change the transaction reference. But the well, I guess here's the question, do you would you like me to I can dig into it on the call here. Or I can just, I believe I should be able to dig into that sometime today and get back to you. Is that good? Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:26:33
that's fine. I'm on it. I don't want them all recreated. Because then I run into an issue. So what I'm doing now if they when they, when they tell me what happened to the chair to the duplicate check that got sent out. Anyway, then I go just go back and change the check number to the one that they're actually using?

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
Are you changing it on the transaction or on the on the check record? On the check record? Because in this case, what happened is, see this is 24499. So transactions

Speaker 4  1:27:15
are keeping the old. The renewal taking others,

Speaker 3  1:27:19
see if I, if they say okay, we're shredding the second check. Well, if I go in and void that check, then my Bills Unpaid. Because my first one never happened, according to the books, so what I do is I go in, I just change the number of the second check on the check, change it to the to the number of the first check, which essentially gets rid of that second check. Right? And all was good, as long as it doesn't, you know, do some sort of automatic feeding off to new information somewhere that throws is weird. Oh, thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:28:12
Number one, get the mod history on one six is because you change the check number on this on the check last Wednesday from 10017 to 10049. And then that got pushed across to counting.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:34
Okay, well check another one. Well, how you gonna do that? I guess go check search and look up one of those checks in there.

Matthias Miller  1:28:50
Let's number 50 of them show my screen. I'm not completely extra sure if I fully understand. I certainly mean Sure. wrap my head around this situation. So.

Speaker 3  1:29:04
So these are the check numbers. They're the nine through 31 are the ones that we have no record of. Okay, I went to the bank, all of those names I got from the picture on the bank. And then on the next row of numbers to the left is what I believe. I mean, sorry, to the right. Like number 4041. That's what I believe the cheque number to actually be. The next column to the right. There is what assist says the check number is I think we somehow got one number off that very first line whereas check number 33 their very first row that's from the in between week check number 40 or 39 whatever it is For three ad off to the right there is the duplicate of check number nine and check number 33 was just printed in between those two for some other invoice it has nothing to do with this it's just the next check that went to that vendor.

Matthias Miller  1:30:15
Got it. So this is the actual cheque number

Speaker 3  1:30:19
yes that's what I believe to be no they didn't have the bank so I can't tell for sure.

Speaker 4  1:30:24
But you did get information from a few vendors that yeah, that was

Speaker 3  1:30:29
yeah, there's some that was the case the alphabet Learning Center those two checks are 57 and the next one is 58 Yeah, there so that's what which 57 no longer exists because I switched it

Unknown Speaker  1:30:58
those What if you searched the first number

Matthias Miller  1:31:03
like Oh got it 2626 Yeah 27 Seven

Unknown Speaker  1:31:12
I'm on my missing

Matthias Miller  1:31:18
have a these are for which company? This is let's start by that Okay, so we're missing the prefix 100100227 and two six and so two seven is the total is Yeah, total 4051 for the total should members should actually be 58 which are saying

Speaker 3  1:32:02
they got they received check number 58 actually check number 27 got Jason away. So I they said they shred a check number 58. So I turned it back into 50 to 27. If you looked at the modification history that should show that got it. But typically what was three weeks ago what took place to this thing? Here I'm just trying to figure out if if there's something here that shows

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
I mean, it was printed and assigned this number 100 to seven on

Speaker 3  1:32:43
the fourth on the fourth well, then what's the last week modification the 17th 17th

Matthias Miller  1:32:53
was changed to 59

Unknown Speaker  1:33:01
Why was it changed to 59? What would have changed it to 59

Matthias Miller  1:33:10
There have been tweaks to a reprinting

Speaker 3  1:33:15
potentially what I'm trying to figure out is did we do something weird and just simply reprinted a bunch of checks for some reason I guess that would have

Matthias Miller  1:33:30
no let's find out so 11 117 1122 117

Matthias Miller  1:33:44
You guys make a lot of changes in a day

Matthias Miller  1:33:53
171 1616 117 At 1122 117 1111 2122 updating records

Matthias Miller  1:34:19
well that's real helpful

Matthias Miller  1:34:30
is obviously what I mean what did it

Unknown Speaker  1:34:33
is it the CES is not one of those system ones. Building record I haven't

Matthias Miller  1:34:42
I still visualize your checkout. So Tori was finalizing a sale or something. Oh

Speaker 3  1:34:55
so it appear like we accidentally selected check and three print deeds and then the starting number was wrong. So here's our new starting number and we essentially just change our check no

Matthias Miller  1:35:13
Well, I mean yes assuming that there's that something that's

Matthias Miller  1:35:25
check system IDs and unless there's something substitute check IDs count check number starting system check system

Unknown Speaker  1:35:45
checks

Matthias Miller  1:35:52
well understand is

Matthias Miller  1:36:04
values

Matthias Miller  1:36:13
but it would have had to have appeared in the checks to print I don't think there is any other way for you to

Speaker 3  1:36:24
the only way to man that'd be the only way to mass do it. I mean, you could go to the individual CHECK IN YOU CAN rebrand I think,

Matthias Miller  1:36:33
but it doesn't take 16 seconds to reprint a single check. Right? Right. It was it was clearly some kind of mass action somewhere. Now it's possible but these weren't even close enough for the same time that you would have had two tabs open or something like this not even that's a week it's it's multiple weeks apart. So that didn't happen.

Speaker 3  1:36:56
Like it appears what was my gut feeling from the beginning? Oh, I mean, once I've figured anything out was that somehow these showed up again, like week or two later they showed well actually at least over a week because the second week went just fine. And those are still there. Then when we go to print out the second week following the the original we have all these new checks to print and so we print them like somehow between one week after the original checks and two weeks after the original checks they show up in checks to print again

Matthias Miller  1:37:47
Do you have memory of him showing up in checks to print

Speaker 3  1:37:54
well so the only thing that I remember here is I told them out of the office that shutdown jacks are ready to go and I think this is this this would be the culprit week boom shutdown Jackson ready to go and later in the day well it was even the next day that I said hey there's there's some new there's there's still more checks to print or you guys want to get to them or something that we want to question was but but if they did, what I thought they were going to do is that they were going to print out the checks. And then later when I was expecting the checks to all be gone there was like 10 of them sitting there now it's not near this many it was only like nine or 10 So I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not I personally do not recall having this whole list like my this seems familiar. This seems familiar, you know 20 That seems familiar.

Matthias Miller  1:39:07
Is this print check will not reassign a number

Unknown Speaker  1:39:13
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:39:18
don't don't standard this is just straight up running the check. Template Yeah, this one does not assign a check number this is this is strictly just give me the check. And we see here that there were 23 checks that you that you printed quote, quote air quotes over that time. So one of the questions would be

Matthias Miller  1:39:55
so this was a these were shed time. Really? So what would have been the commonality of what have been the commonality of these

Matthias Miller  1:40:22
I mean, I think that's something that I probably have to dig in and and see if there's anything obvious but it's really weird to me that it makes no sense to go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:34
It's it's every single check from the fourth

Matthias Miller  1:40:40
every single check from the force

Unknown Speaker  1:40:44
look at activity history on the board.

Speaker 3  1:40:47
Yeah, like, like all of those checks were, were dated for the fourth originally. And they they kept the date of the fourth when they were reprinted.

Matthias Miller  1:40:59
Okay. Well, that's helpful

Matthias Miller  1:41:18
but they had a number that is the weird thing. Now. Are you sure that no, that number was there for three weeks? I am utterly confused. Okay. Well, this is helpful. Let me let me at least make a note and capture some screenshots and see if there's any kind of

Matthias Miller  1:41:57
any kind of yeah, see if we can figure out where it was with what was going on.

Speaker 4  1:42:14
Oh, three? Well, yeah. See what we'll see if you if you figure it out. More, right.

Matthias Miller  1:42:29
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I just simply don't have any kind of baffled to be honest. It would be literally everything. That'd be one thing. It's weird. It's only the ones in the fourth

Matthias Miller  1:42:56
No, but these are all the ship time when so it was matching by. Okay, well,

Speaker 3  1:43:03
yeah, nothing like that happened on the other two companies that I'm aware of, like, all the check numbers are present in sequentially and all on the other two companies, so.

Matthias Miller  1:43:17
Okay, well, let's see what I can find. Hopefully doesn't happen again. Good. Cool. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. Yep. You're welcome. Oh, um, do you guys need to still need to talk? Either one or three.

Speaker 4  1:43:39
Well, if we just do three, yeah, I'd say let's do three and regroup on. On this. You are. Yeah, we have any super rare.

Matthias Miller  1:43:50
Okay. Yeah. Sounds a plan. We'll talk then. Thank you. You bet. Thanks.
