Matthias Miller  00:29
Good morning. Hey, good morning. How are you guys doing

Unknown Speaker  00:31
good,

Matthias Miller  00:36
good, good. How about you I'm doing good.

Speaker 1  00:39
Yep. Are you enjoying this 90 degree weather with all the humidity?

Matthias Miller  00:47
Try more like, you know, 70 degree mornings with no humidity, and I sat outside for breakfast with a few of my friends. Mountains in the background. Just tell me when to stop.

Unknown Speaker  01:07
I think we may have to do some, we had, may have to do some face to face meetings,

Matthias Miller  01:13
yeah, well, I don't, I won't charge you extra for those and,

Speaker 1  01:21
well, I just realized that that Google Docs you sent over. I was going to pull it out and refresh my memory. Here it goes, to my Gmail account instead of my fnk accounts. I requested access on my F and K account. Let me take a look. But no, your

Unknown Speaker  01:44
your Google account will default to your

Speaker 1  01:47
Gino. Why I do need to, I do need to request it that way, don't I? Yeah, I'm going to, I think I request you

Unknown Speaker  01:56
set

Unknown Speaker  01:57
up your this.

Speaker 2  02:01
Okay, I got in that time. Yeah, I shared it with you. Okay, yep,

Matthias Miller  02:08
all right, so let me go ahead and where I wanted to go. I wanted to walk through some of these screenshots and just use them as basically a did we catch everything?

Unknown Speaker  02:29
So let me go pull

Unknown Speaker  02:40
up here.

Matthias Miller  03:01
So we're going to start with,

Unknown Speaker  03:11
start with employee.

Matthias Miller  03:17
I have to, I

Unknown Speaker  03:22
have to do this.

Matthias Miller  03:26
All right, so we had employee number. Is that the employee code?

Speaker 1  03:36
Now say that again? Employee code, oh, yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:41
first name, middle name, last name. And then we have the Okay, so that one's not

Unknown Speaker  03:51
and this is e3 60. Screenshot.

Matthias Miller  03:53
That is e3 60.

Unknown Speaker  03:56
Yeah, yep.

Speaker 1  04:02
And obviously we don't use near all the available options there,

Matthias Miller  04:09
all right, so I mean, all I had noted for this was name, employee number for linking and termination date is that, is there anything on the screen that we're missing,

Unknown Speaker  04:24
the paid classes on there,

Speaker 1  04:27
which from the shop would just be a standard paid class, right? Do you even use that one? Bruce, oh,

Unknown Speaker  04:42
we got that.

Unknown Speaker  04:46
Not sure what that correlates to.

Speaker 1  04:50
I'm not sure it correlates to anything on your end. Alright, possibility the pay class may be of some use,

Unknown Speaker  04:56
but Well, what about if they're the types i. The time

Speaker 1  05:03
that Well, again, there's possibility that might be of some use, but I don't think it actually goes anywhere.

Speaker 1  05:15
And I guess, yeah, Matt can't see it, but I was pointing to the types up there where it says mechanic, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:23
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  05:30
and the pay class down just a little Yep, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  05:37
But we don't use them. Need to Right? Right?

Speaker 1  05:40
Well, that would be an assumption that I think is correct. Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  05:51
all right, so there's that one, and then the

Unknown Speaker  05:56
custom one,

Matthias Miller  05:58
sure that one I

Matthias Miller  06:05
there's really nothing. I mean, there's nothing on this one. So that takes us through. See, let's go to heavy job. Employee that's i

Matthias Miller  06:32
i sink down just a bit so you can potentially read it.

Speaker 1  06:36
Know what that screenshot to read only? There's a lot more on

Speaker 3  06:40
that from i I want to look at Bruce's. His isn't read only, and there's not a lot. Okay, okay, so, yeah. So, yeah, there's the code,

Speaker 1  06:51
there's the name, the pay class we do use in here,

Speaker 2  06:58
and the phone number, that'd be about all we do. The payroll clip code

Unknown Speaker  07:05
and the Floyd code should be the same,

Matthias Miller  07:15
okay,

Speaker 3  07:17
but the name is not first last, like e3 60 is, but it's just

Speaker 1  07:23
worse. And there, there are some that are kind of screwed up or on here, aren't there? Like, the payroll code may be different than

Unknown Speaker  07:30
the actual thinking. When we change the numbering.

Unknown Speaker  07:37
In order to find that out, we'd have to look at,

Unknown Speaker  07:41
look at look at mine or yours, right?

Speaker 1  07:45
Some of us, old dudes, we may have a payroll code that's different than our employee code.

Matthias Miller  07:51
Okay? And does Foundation have a place to put in the payroll code?

Speaker 4  07:57
I'm thinking it might be. Where is going to be, John,

Unknown Speaker  08:01
just say,

Unknown Speaker  08:03
I'm thinking it might be the payroll code that that foundation is importing.

Speaker 2  08:15
Yeah, oh, it's nothing. It's hard to find. When you're

Unknown Speaker  08:21
plugging in, it

Unknown Speaker  08:24
won't let you pop it up,

Unknown Speaker  08:27
so it gives me that

Speaker 5  08:28
error and then,

Unknown Speaker  08:38
so this is,

Speaker 2  08:42
that's the right in the center of that. Set

Unknown Speaker  08:47
up employees think

Unknown Speaker  08:57
there's a little bit of a musty smell up here. Set up go down to employee library.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
That's a whole different

Unknown Speaker  09:14
so, yes, payroll code has to coordinate.

Unknown Speaker  09:21
Where were we last week? Whenever

Speaker 3  09:27
we we were in, we ran to seven upon verses. That looks a thing. That's just, you got that there's another minute you

Unknown Speaker  09:35
gotta get to, yeah, we've got 1-234-567-8910, 11, 1213, 1415,

Speaker 1  09:44
1617, 18. We've got about 18 people that the payroll code is different than their employee code.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
So when the exports you have a job, it's actually pulling in that payroll code. Now. On,

Speaker 2  10:03
and I don't think we can change that. Can we? I don't think so,

Speaker 3  10:06
yeah, so that means you've got to, you've got to pull in the payroll code as well as the the employee code. Sure.

Matthias Miller  10:16
Okay, I

Matthias Miller  10:24
the classification is just the pay class. Is that right? Correct?

Speaker 1  10:31
Typically, the only time that we use that pay classes is on prevailing wage projects. I mean, let me reappraise that we use it all the time, but it's just a generic all the time, until we go to a prevailing wage project, and then we have to start using labor operator, truck driver, mobilization,

Unknown Speaker  10:55
all kinds of good stuff like that.

Matthias Miller  10:58
Sure. Um,

Unknown Speaker  11:03
did you ever feed that thing?

Unknown Speaker  11:06
It's 11 o'clock.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
I didn't

Speaker 2  11:13
dance that Bruce's stomach sitting over here growling like he's starving to death. I

Matthias Miller  11:23
Hey, it's past 11 on Friday. So you guys, never mind. You guys are

Unknown Speaker  11:29
central rooster.

Speaker 3  11:31
It's 11 o'clock. Yeah, we're barely

Speaker 1  11:35
Eastern. We can, we can about see central time from here.

Matthias Miller  11:42
I Alright.

Unknown Speaker  11:47
So there. So

Matthias Miller  11:49
that's the so on the employee screenshots we got.

Unknown Speaker  11:56
What's that document? If he wants? We don't. What

Matthias Miller  12:04
I want to go this guy foundation screenshots. That's what it was after. Yeah, I grabbed that.

Speaker 3  12:12
Yeah, sorry, that should have been just a little bit more organized, but, uh, I pretty much threw together and sent her out Fair enough.

Matthias Miller  12:22
All right, so foundation, then we got,

Matthias Miller  12:32
let's see the employee number here. Is that the employee drop list? Or is there a different place for that?

Unknown Speaker  12:43
Yes, yes, what? That's a drop

Speaker 3  12:48
down? Well, is that name or code or it's

Speaker 4  12:51
employee number? I was, yeah, looking at my different things, but I

Matthias Miller  13:03
for assessment.

Speaker 3  13:10
So that's down the

Matthias Miller  13:22
like the mechanic list in the 360 is there a place on here that that comes from?

Unknown Speaker  13:33
There's a second,

Unknown Speaker  13:38
second i

Unknown Speaker  13:56
Does that even get asked?

Unknown Speaker  13:57
I don't think it does from me, 360 but Bruce is trying to confirm that,

Matthias Miller  14:07
all right. And then, while he does that, is there a place where the pay class comes from on here?

Unknown Speaker  14:18
Think it's that trade, but he's looking at it

Unknown Speaker  14:25
as far as the lake Jim, well,

Unknown Speaker  14:32
and you use

Speaker 4  14:33
trade, so, yeah, that would be the trade the lake Gen.

Unknown Speaker  14:37
Yeah, Lake Gen is a trade.

Speaker 3  14:41
So operator would be a trade, yeah, that's where that goes. Okay,

Matthias Miller  14:50
so the trade maps,

Unknown Speaker  14:53
you said trade maps to pay, class, correct? Yes. Okay, um.

Matthias Miller  15:00
All right, then the payroll code come from.

Speaker 1  15:20
Payroll code that that's the employee, drop down, correct.

Matthias Miller  15:27
Do you store it in foundation? If it's different, the

Speaker 4  15:37
payroll code is what gets input or exported from heavy dog. That's the That's what has to correlate with that employee number, right? There is this payroll field, not

Speaker 2  15:51
painful. And anybody that's been hired in the last

Unknown Speaker  15:57
Yeah, they're the same, except for

Speaker 1  16:01
anybody's been tired in about the last 10 years, they're they're the same. So basically that they were different.

Matthias Miller  16:09
So basically what we'll assume is that, I mean, it's something like when we set up a new employee, when foundation pushes a new employee to heavy job, it would assign the payroll code, but it never updates the payroll codes that you can have. Like, if the employee already exists, you never update the payroll code. You only set it for new employees, right, correct.

Speaker 4  16:37
Yeah, that employee number and foundation is the Primary Key and cannot change ever. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  16:59
I saying

Speaker 1  17:03
I've got that Google doc open on my iPad, and I look down and my iPads move, and I'm like, what's going on? Oh, yeah, I guess it's live.

Matthias Miller  17:16
Yes. Okay, so the trade goes pay class. The Is it the primary phone or cell phone or cell phone that goes across?

Unknown Speaker  17:25
The cell phone? Wouldn't it build a foundation?

Speaker 1  17:32
I would say, Well, what we're looking at is, what do we want to go across? And currently, are we foundation? Bruce is not even using, well, there's not currently, but there's going to be,

Speaker 4  17:50
well, it seems like, like for hrhq, it was cellphone. This

Speaker 1  17:55
cellphone is what we would normally use in the in the email. Both of those could go across and directly connect a heavy job.

Speaker 3  18:06
Well, there's no spot to put in an email. There was

Unknown Speaker  18:13
go to might be under Custom, customized, Oh, do you have some custom Yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:22
add a custom field for email,

Speaker 2  18:25
yeah? Well, it, it has it in there. You just have to select it. Custom set, yeah,

Speaker 3  18:30
there's, there's custom settings that I did turn on to that screenshot. So that custom field, or that custom page, will have a it'd be similar to the e3 61

Speaker 2  18:47
I thought sure there was a line for an email. I'm not seeing one either. E3 60 that there would be. I think so. But yeah, how's it on an email? And do additional

Unknown Speaker  19:06
first form of library, really, single try, single

Unknown Speaker  19:13
entry. That's the page that I am

Unknown Speaker  19:16
screenshot.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
I don't know, not seeing it in heavy job.

Speaker 1  19:29
I guess I would assume that we would try and send it somewhere. But really, we've got it here. I don't know. We have to send it anywhere.

Matthias Miller  19:41
Seems like there's, I don't know how much value there is, the day workflow. It seems like there is a possibility of adding custom fields there. So you you would have a place to send it across, but if you're not going to use it, then, well, by all

Unknown Speaker  19:52
means, it's not, yeah,

Speaker 3  19:57
making sure we're sending them until we would. It

Speaker 2  20:05
depends on whether it's a $5 answer or a 500 or 5000

Unknown Speaker  20:10
just spent $5 in that time. Yeah.

Speaker 1  20:18
Right now, yes, we do have them in there. And so Bruce doesn't have them. Well, if we're getting them anywhere, we need them in here in foundation. And if we want them, they need to be able to export. So we may as well make them export. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  20:36
yeah, I don't think it's, I mean, it's, it's, it's definitely a marginal thing. It's I'm sure the custom fields are handled somehow differently, but that all depends on the specifics of how this stuff gets pushed in there, which we don't know yet, and hoping we can find out today, but or find out some of that today. But

Unknown Speaker  20:55
select one. Just select an employee, a fairly new employee. I

Unknown Speaker  21:06
get your fingers right.

Speaker 2  21:13
I'm just looking at what all is in there, his address, his cell phone number, his email address, all that kind of stuff. Okay, now the defaults down here are not required, right? But that that would actually come from HR HQ, nowadays, correct? I mean, basically all this should come in from HR HQ, yes.

Speaker 3  21:35
So that's nothing that we're going to have to deal with here, right?

Unknown Speaker  21:45
Yeah, does,

Speaker 3  21:46
if you change something, does it change in HR HQ, or do you know you

Speaker 4  21:52
have to go to HR HQ and synchronize

Speaker 1  21:56
it, as far as sake than a automatic change? The theory is some of them or export, yeah, some of them push. Some of them do it automatically. Some of them you have to request it. But

Speaker 3  22:14
in theory, it shouldn't have to do anything different. If you're wanting foundation to be primary input, and it's coming from somewhere else,

Speaker 1  22:21
you're well, HR HQ is foundation. It's just

Unknown Speaker  22:27
make sure that that's what you were

Unknown Speaker  22:28
right.

Speaker 1  22:33
I want foundation to be the primary repository of information, and I don't want to have to enter it four different times at four different places. So if it's getting entered at HR HQ, as long as it gets in here, I don't care, but,

Speaker 3  22:52
well, there's an import export. You might have to pull that straight from HR HQ instead of this, right, which that's the case, and we need to get screenshots of that.

Speaker 1  23:04
I don't think we do. I think we can go right here and be fine. Makes one way or another. Bruce, you're going to get it in here. It has to get in here whether you enter with your finger or whether you pull it in from HR, HQ, it has to get into this screen. So,

Unknown Speaker  23:25
yeah, we're good.

Matthias Miller  23:31
We will need, we will need screenshots for the daily wage, the earning codes, the hours work, all that stuff, both from heavy job foundation, but I vote to go straight into equipment, stuff,

Unknown Speaker  23:57
grab those. Hey, wage,

Unknown Speaker  24:02
drop down menus. I believe

Speaker 1  24:04
you're gonna send what you just said when we're all done. Right?

Speaker 2  24:10
Yeah, okay, so

Matthias Miller  24:28
All right, so we got here,

Matthias Miller  24:35
sorry. All right, so this is a 62 60. So we had talked about bake, let's, let's put this in a

Matthias Miller  24:55
they separate out bed and cereal.

Unknown Speaker  24:59
Um. Here?

Speaker 1  25:06
Well, I'm not sure what the difference between the VIN number and the serial

Matthias Miller  25:09
number is. I'm gonna guess that Vin has validation, has been validation, and serial number is just free form. That's my guess, but I could be mistaken.

Speaker 1  25:21
Well, I I'm not sure we kind of use it interchangeably,

Speaker 3  25:25
zippers, zipper, trailers, that kind of stuff, because any rude going vehicle has to have a bend, like a trailer has to have a bin, but the zipper wouldn't have a zipper has a serial number,

Speaker 1  25:39
gotcha, that's what Matt's saying. It it has to have validation.

Speaker 3  25:45
It has to be it, well, I'm not sure if it does or not. It might, might say that, okay, yeah, your lock 17 digits or whatever it is. But it also might

Speaker 1  25:59
be free form. The I'm just thinking on the spreadsheets that I'm looking at, I think some of it's called one thing, some of it's another. So I've got to figure that out. But

Matthias Miller  26:15
take a look at foundation and how they do it. Okay, so the

Speaker 6  26:21
I engine

Matthias Miller  26:25
information. That's everything we talked about on that one depreciation.

Speaker 1  26:30
We don't use that in here. That was an experiment, right there. Yep.

Matthias Miller  26:37
Do we have the purchase, date, amount and location and the sale date, amount in here.

Unknown Speaker  26:48
Go back to the first screenshot.

Speaker 1  26:55
I someplace. It is and it's might be

Speaker 3  27:01
under that's in that go back, go back to that one you just had the

Unknown Speaker  27:06
depreciation.

Speaker 3  27:11
That's all. That's that tab. If you see the below the picture, those gray bars. So you just click through your tabs there. So that's in that same the general would have just been the first screen. So

Unknown Speaker  27:34
History tab,

Speaker 2  27:37
any other see, I have custom fields, and

Matthias Miller  27:42
then we're jumping over to heavy job. I mean, it might be on one of the other tabs too, but

Speaker 1  27:49
I don't have it. The depreciation tab has it on there. They don't, yeah, so the purchase value, purchase, purchase date,

Matthias Miller  28:02
um, eight depreciation tab says purchase the

Speaker 1  28:06
resale value would be salvage value. And I think the the years there, that's back to depreciation, which we currently don't use, not saying that we're not going to but currently we don't.

Matthias Miller  28:30
Depreciation tab E, salvage value,

Unknown Speaker  28:34
purchase value. And

Matthias Miller  28:39
when you said purchase location. Did you mean the purchased from over here?

Unknown Speaker  28:43
Yes, purchased from,

Matthias Miller  28:50
okay. And then on the do you record the sale event on

Speaker 1  28:57
foundation, foundation, and then in here, I don't think there's a, there's a,

Unknown Speaker  29:05
go back to the general, the General tab,

Speaker 1  29:09
there's a, there's an option in here to basically say that it's

Unknown Speaker  29:16
what Word do I want archived?

Speaker 1  29:21
Yeah, you can archive a a piece of equipment. Oh, it's status up there, the status someplace over on the right, the blue

Matthias Miller  29:29
there we go. Talk about,

Speaker 2  29:32
yeah, okay, I don't know that it necessarily let you change the status and date what the status was. But

Speaker 3  29:43
no, it just, it gives you that's basically like an archive, yeah, yep,

Matthias Miller  29:50
all right, and then we had a category that came across as a group, or something like that. Do we have that? Tight, is that what you mean? Um,

Unknown Speaker  30:02
type, yep, right there.

Speaker 1  30:08
Yeah, they call it group and heavy job, and foundation calls it

Unknown Speaker  30:14
primary category and secondary. Foundation's

Speaker 1  30:16
got primary category and secondary category options. Mm,

Unknown Speaker  30:27
this.

Matthias Miller  30:33
Okay, so then we got okay. So that's that takes us through e3, 60 on that one, we do have the foundation code as a custom field.

Speaker 3  30:50
Should be the same as the st, 319, all right,

Speaker 1  30:55
yes, yes, the equipment ID, the asset number,

Unknown Speaker  31:02
another one, though, but,

Speaker 3  31:04
well, that one's new enough that, if it got put in wrong, then

Unknown Speaker  31:08
on the new ones, but the old

Speaker 1  31:09
stuff that is there. Can you give an example one that's got two different codes? Bruce the 200 the 80. Is that?

Speaker 3  31:17
Why that? It's pulling the foundation Code field for the specific instances, yes,

Speaker 1  31:27
gotcha. So I don't know caught all that, but there are some old pieces of equipment that the equipment ID and the accounting code are different.

Unknown Speaker  31:38
Foundation code, the foundation code, whatever

Speaker 1  31:43
and so most of them, I won't say most of them, but in the last 10 years, at least,

Unknown Speaker  31:52
it has been the same i

Speaker 1  32:04
So in reality, if we're pushing it from foundation to e3, 60, the foundation equipment number is going to get pushed out to the equipment ID. No, no, that's not right,

Speaker 3  32:18
the foundation, okay, we'll go to equipment ID on. No,

Speaker 2  32:25
we got to the same place backwards. No, that's not right.

Speaker 1  32:31
So, so the accounting code out of foundation is what that we have to push over to the found it.

Unknown Speaker  32:44
Pull up the 200

Speaker 4  32:57
Okay, we're gonna do that. Yeah, we're gonna do that again.

Speaker 2  33:04
Some reason it doesn't like that. Here, does it? It doesn't There we go. And so it's Adx, 200 CLC. Now where's the

Speaker 4  33:17
that equipment ID I do not have in foundation. Gotcha, that's why we had to, because this is another one that I cannot change that primary

Speaker 1  33:30
key. It cannot change, as in, if we change it, we have to put it in as a new

Speaker 3  33:36
machine, right? And then you lose all your

Speaker 2  33:40
then you've got a mess. I mean, unless pick your mess, right? Okay, so what we're just seeing here, Matt is

Speaker 1  33:52
the equipment number in foundation goes to e3, 60 as the foundation code.

Matthias Miller  34:03
Okay, so we actually need to map goes to except foundation. I mean, it starts from foundation, so it's the other way foundation goes to foundation code.

Speaker 2  34:21
Now those are exactly what he said. If you go to the first screen, pop that open. I want to there's something down there. Next one, right there, so that the accounting code.

Speaker 1  34:40
The accounting code is what comes from foundation.

Matthias Miller  34:45
So that's an application code.

Speaker 1  34:47
That's the foundation code, the asset or the equipment ID is what we use across the rest of the company, and it's all the same. Yeah, except for the ones that aren't

Matthias Miller  35:04
so realistically. Then this gets linked by the linked by here. Let's do this. We have the accounting code to foundation code, just a custom field, and then, and so, when linking match, attempt to match first by accounting code slash foundation code, if there are no matches, match secondarily by as by asset ID. What do we call it here?

Unknown Speaker  35:50
Equipment ID, equipment ID,

Matthias Miller  35:55
I guess that's just straight across this equipment ID. I

Matthias Miller  36:06
and then just say, note foundation code may vary from,

Unknown Speaker  36:17
okay, I'm

Matthias Miller  36:24
uh, wait, did I get these? I got these wrong.

Speaker 1  36:32
My my understanding of it is the accounting code is the connection between e3, 60 and foundation that can the accounting code connects the equipment ID to the found the foundation equipment number. And if you have it all set up correctly, and you set it all up the same time, you don't need the accounting code. You just go straight to the ID, but that's basically their their option to connect the dots.

Matthias Miller  37:11
Okay, the let me make sure I got, I got this straight in Foundation. The accounting code is the the foundation ID.

Unknown Speaker  37:25
Foundation calls it equipment number,

Matthias Miller  37:35
um, foundation, yeah, okay, sorry, I got this completely wrong, man, that's enough to make your head spin on a Friday morning. The So, okay, the foundation equipment accounting code maps to the equipment number, yeah, and then the foundation equipment ID maps to the foundation code. Just custom field,

Speaker 1  38:04
the e3 60 equipment ID maps to the accounting code, e3 60 accounting code. The e3 60 accounting code maps to the foundation equipment number.

Unknown Speaker  38:20
Okay, so that to draw that on the wall.

Matthias Miller  38:29
Okay, so really, we want this swap, because we're talking right now. We're talking,

Speaker 1  38:35
I'll say, in reverse, foundation equipment number maps to the e3 60 accounting code, which maps to the e3 60 equipment ID.

Speaker 2  38:50
But the equipment ID and accounting code are not necessarily the same thing, yeah, but okay,

Matthias Miller  38:56
but then, then the the foundation accounting code. No, we don't have a foundation accounting code. It's just this,

Speaker 3  39:09
correct it? No, the foundation account code is down there, that one you've got circled

Speaker 1  39:15
that that's 360 accounting code, which goes to foundation equipment number. Yeah, right. So that's the core. That's the if that accounting code is blank, then it will pull from the equipment ID. Am I saying that correctly? That's right.

Unknown Speaker  39:37
So, so the the

Speaker 1  39:40
import, export, it looks, it looks at the accounting code and says that there's nothing there. Then it just goes to the equipment ID and uses that to map to the equipment number, right?

Matthias Miller  39:56
So how does fill me in? Now, how foundation code? Fits into the equation.

Unknown Speaker  40:04
Which equation?

Matthias Miller  40:06
Just, I don't know, like this thing, just, what is this? Does it

Unknown Speaker  40:10
matter? Was

Speaker 1  40:14
so what? What foundation code is? Let me let me, let me back up and say that's back to that accounting code, that that's the foundation code.

Unknown Speaker  40:30
There's nothing,

Matthias Miller  40:33
well, so that should be the same foundation code should be the same as accounting code.

Unknown Speaker  40:38
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  40:41
Okay,

Speaker 1  40:43
and I without opening up, and I'm not sure whether I can open it up here.

Unknown Speaker  40:48
Maybe Bruce, can you open up e3, 60,

Speaker 2  40:59
login under B, What was that? That's SD, 319, Chad, you, yeah, 6807,

Unknown Speaker  41:27
okay. St, 319,

Unknown Speaker  41:35
enter,

Unknown Speaker  41:40
okay, we're on the slow side. Yeah. Okay. Now, which screen was that that showed the

Unknown Speaker  41:52
foundation code, custom fields.

Unknown Speaker  41:54
Okay, go to Custom Fields and then click on foundation code.

Unknown Speaker  42:01
There's nothing in there. 200

Speaker 2  42:07
Okay, so then 200 Z up there

Speaker 2  42:18
and go to the Okay, so the field value now go to general, scroll down. I don't know. That's an interesting question. You know what

Unknown Speaker  42:37
that looks like? A cost code. Founder, foundation,

Speaker 1  42:45
the foundation code and the the accounting code are not the same, so I don't know why it that's question that we need to chase down.

Unknown Speaker  42:59
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:01
I think that's cost code.

Unknown Speaker  43:03
It does look like a cost code, but I don't know why it would be a cost

Speaker 4  43:06
code. Well, it brings Cost Codes over. We don't really care, because we we track my equipment or not job.

Unknown Speaker  43:20
And is that a well, the newer ones obviously don't have that.

Speaker 4  43:39
That's what we do all of our reporting, not the cost code.

Speaker 1  43:48
I think I can fairly confidently say the accounting codes what we need to be concerned with. Yeah, okay, all right,

Speaker 3  44:01
but if he exports from foundation, it's going to go there and not to the equipment ID. We've

Unknown Speaker  44:09
got to figure that part of it out,

Unknown Speaker  44:11
unless,

Speaker 1  44:15
if we export from foundation, it needs to go to the accounting code for sure

Unknown Speaker  44:22
new equipment can get both

Speaker 1  44:24
right. New equipment only needs to go to the equipment ID, and we just skip the accounting code Correct. Open up in 360 and go to

Unknown Speaker  44:35
do it one way.

Speaker 3  44:37
Gonna say you've got the whole time. Otherwise you're going to make it old hair out you

Unknown Speaker  44:45
don't have any hair.

Matthias Miller  44:46
There's nothing that ship sailed.

Unknown Speaker  44:52
Yeah, so, so go to a newer piece. Go to

Unknown Speaker  44:59
Beth. Pretty new.

Speaker 2  45:01
Well, I'm looking at it on the st 319 st, 319 fine. Okay, so they're the same. So it's using this it, yeah, it's still a different field. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:21
we might have figured out,

Unknown Speaker  45:25
I don't know either,

Speaker 1  45:29
if it's different than the asset number, then how do we

Speaker 3  45:34
well, do we have to, I mean, are we just trying to get new stuff set up? Well, are we trying to say old stuff, because if we're just getting new stuff set up, it doesn't matter about the 200 it's working how it is. So just figure out how it needs to happen.

Speaker 1  45:50
I don't know the answer to that because, like, right now, I'm working on three spreadsheets, trying to pull it all together from 1947 or whatever, and I'm just realizing that I was going for the asset number as the common denominator, and that's fine, until the ones that don't that have a different number.

Speaker 1  46:20
And so my thought was that we would, we would get that correct, and then we would get it imported, exported, everything, so it's all up to date where it's supposed to be,

Speaker 3  46:31
well, you can't, you can't put new equipment and 360 I mean, you can't put the same equipment in new

Speaker 1  46:41
my thought was, once we get that all fixed, we would import it in into Foundation, and then do the export routine from foundation to everything else. So you're going to overwrite. I don't think

Unknown Speaker  46:57
you can do that, but yeah,

Speaker 1  47:01
hey, e3 60 and heavy job. Yes, we can. I talked to them. It's just a matter of, it's an you work with them, you tell them what column goes where, and, yeah, you can import it, and it'll write and do all its thing. Okay, but that's a real problem right there with that equipment ID and accounting code.

Matthias Miller  47:26
Okay, what's, what's the issue with? Can you, I didn't follow all of that. Can you break down what the issue is with

Speaker 1  47:34
the so the issue is on our older equipment. We were using a different standard for our equipment number when we added e3, 60, or maybe sometime after we had switched to a new standard. And so the accounting code is what correlates back to the accounting software. So basically, what e3 60 does, it allows you to have two different codes for the same piece of equipment, and if, if it's different, they correlate based on the accounting code, not on the equipment ID. So we have a piece of equipment, I'll use that 200 Bruce's number for the 200 is AEX, 200 CLC, 200 CLC, the number that the whole rest of the company uses is ex to two.

Speaker 3  48:45
So the equipment ID number on that is that eight number, and the accounting code would be

Speaker 1  48:51
the ex two backwards. Yeah, you said it right, except back well, accounting code on here, on e3, 60, the accounting code would be the ex a, 200 C, Oh, yeah. The equipment ID would be ex two,

Matthias Miller  49:08
yep. Well, I mean, so I think, I think this gets down a little bit the technical details of how the sync works. If, if we're literally doing a flat file export and import, then we need to have figured out a way, somewhere in foundation to store the the e3, 60 code, yeah, so that we can link out the records properly, if not, if we have some kind of script or something sitting in the middle, well, It's just a semantic detail to on how you, how you, how you match up which which equipment

Unknown Speaker  49:49
ties to which equipment.

Speaker 1  49:51
In theory, we can do a custom field and foundation, and that custom field could be our equipment. ID, right, asset, number, whatever, and it would always be the same, except for the ones that are different that would need some follow up and thinking about,

Matthias Miller  50:18
I think, I think, I think if you were, if you were to put, I mean that to me, seems pretty straightforward, and you could then push. So basically, what you would do is you would push the custom field in front for the 360 sorry, equipment, equipment ID, the export, the export would then map like this, you would have foundation well Like foundation field custom, foundation field e3, 60 equipment ID mapping to a 360 equipment ID, and then foundation equipment number mapping to a 360 accounting code. And you would just plan to have maybe, maybe start setting both fields in both places. Foundation would be the the source of truth, and it would map. And then, if you want to, I mean, you could theoretically change linking. It'd be a terrible thing to do, but by changing the custom field and foundation and having it shout to a different

Unknown Speaker  51:42
place So,

Speaker 1  51:45
and that that same issue is going to be an issue with heavy job also exact same reason, exact same setup where the employee could no for The for the equipment ID,

Matthias Miller  51:58
right,

Speaker 1  52:01
right. We use the user defined field and then key then,

Unknown Speaker  52:06
yeah, essentially bypass this equipment

Unknown Speaker  52:09
number Yeah, okay, but

Matthias Miller  52:11
e3 60 and heavy job will share the same IDs. Okay, so, I mean, it's the same problem just in a new place. It's not like we're version number three, right? Well, but my hair. Thanks you.

Matthias Miller  52:33
Okay, so then here, let's jump over into foundation screenshots, because I think that'd be let's see. We don't have, don't have foundation equipment. Screenshots.

Unknown Speaker  52:51
Sure have

Speaker 3  52:55
say it was a different word file. Let me just I thought it

Matthias Miller  52:59
software. I got jobs, and I've got employees. Was there? Did I miss a file?

Unknown Speaker  53:06
Oops. Might have sent the wrong file.

Unknown Speaker  53:08
I bet I did new equipment. I bet I did jobs.

Matthias Miller  53:13
Okay, well, we'll get through what we got here. Okay, so then heavy job. Heavy job is alright. So we got a

Matthias Miller  53:30
we got the code.

Unknown Speaker  53:33
Got this over here.

Speaker 2  53:39
Description, no go cancel that. Go to setup and equipment library, and then I think there's an account. Go to the single entry. Is there an accounting code someplace in there? No. There's an old code there changes to the 200 Can I just type that in there? I think so.

Unknown Speaker  54:12
Try Adx, no, x2,

Speaker 1  54:22
I too. Okay, wow, so So, yeah, looking at heavy job, they the the accounting code is called alt code. Yeah, there's the alt code up there. I

Unknown Speaker  54:45
so for

Unknown Speaker  54:49
and so foundation is looking for the alt code.

Speaker 1  54:52
Yeah, foundation is looking for the alt code. Well, that's what correlates,

Matthias Miller  54:59
right? That's insane. Of the right code. So heavy foundation slash, heavy job linking works the same way as foundation slash e3, 60,

Unknown Speaker  55:19
except it lives

Unknown Speaker  55:22
in 360 talks to

Speaker 2  55:25
heavy job, not, right? I mean, not really. They're, they're separate databases. They, they don't have a combined database and,

Unknown Speaker  55:39
well, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  55:42
they do on my end.

Matthias Miller  55:49
So they're, they're using, they're using the same back okay, but presumably they're using the same back end database with different sets of tables or something. So they don't, they're not, they're not using

Unknown Speaker  55:58
the same database. It,

Unknown Speaker  56:00
it's not the same there.

Speaker 1  56:04
They communicate, but it's via telephone instead of living in the same room. So they're virtual friends instead of face to face friends. They're your pigeons. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I think it's it's worse than that, but yes, they're set up to communicate, but it's essentially it may as well be two, two different products. They just happen to be from the same company,

Matthias Miller  56:36
understand if it helps you any there are companies I was talking to software vendor recently. This is rabbit trail. We'll get back on topic in a minute. They outsourced one of their features to another team and inside the same product, they basically had that issue. And and everything looks pretty on the surface, but under the hood, talk about a nightmare. Yeah. Alright, so the description, where does the description come from?

Speaker 1  57:15
That's That's an interesting question, because I'm not sure the description is going to come from foundation, but that may involve changing the descriptions in heavy job and e3 60. So the that's, that's one that I just kind of recognized in the last couple days, and went, Oh, great. I thought if I got one column done, the other one take care of itself. And I don't think that's a true statement. Sorry. Well, there's only about 1200 lines to go through, so once I get to the point I've got a correlation, then I'll probably be saying, Can you help me get this? An easy way to fix this?

Matthias Miller  58:05
Sure, totally. I mean, if insomnia is happens to be an issue for you, is my help. The serial number here, do we? Do we grab Vin? If Vin is present.

Speaker 1  58:21
Else we don't use it at all in here. I know it's again, if it works fine, but it's not that we ever use the equipment, paid class. We don't use the note, the group we do use, and then the rent status active or Reddit would use,

Speaker 3  58:45
and then how, what are you doing as far as base rate DNA,

Speaker 1  58:52
the base rate is correlates To foundations.

Speaker 2  58:59
Can we pull up foundation here for nowhere.

Speaker 1  59:06
Yeah, the base rate should correlate to the Job Costing rates hourly in Foundation,

Speaker 3  59:16
which we didn't send in that screenshot, so it's kind of sorry about that, yeah.

Matthias Miller  59:27
So we don't need purchase or sale information, not in heavy job. And then the tmn regular rate comes from

Speaker 1  59:36
regular rate, I believe, is going to come from the standard billing rate

Unknown Speaker  59:42
in Foundation, in foundation,

Matthias Miller  59:45
and then there's no cost rate here. Well, that would be the costing that. That would be the base rate that we talked

Speaker 1  59:51
about. The base rate equals hourly job costing rates, yep, unless you. Daily rate. Let's just go with that. I just thought of another issue on that. But, yeah, Foundation offers the options for hourly, daily, weekly, monthly idle time and downtime rates. We don't use all those but heavy job only offers hourly options, and so we have some stuff in there that it like an attachment. We put a daily rate in for it, and it's marked as daily rate. You just, if you use it, you mark it one. Well, in theory, we can do the same thing by marking it for eight and using it as an hourly rate. But then everybody's used to if they use it two hours, they put two hours down on it. So right, there's a comprehension issue on all four corners.

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
Is Is there a, I mean, is there an option of using, well, I mean, we're talking behavior change, so there's no good course, really. I mean, we could, we could flag, if there would be a way in foundation to say we want to push daily rate across, not hourly. That would be an option, potentially.

Speaker 1  1:01:30
Well, the other thing I'm just looking at is that second and third rate that we do not use, in theory, we could possibly use second rate can, could be the daily rate. It's going to be an anomaly. And then we would have to figure out, does it even matter in in there? It doesn't. Yeah, it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
does. It does matter. Uh, uh,

Speaker 1  1:02:03
my, I don't know we're gonna, I'm glad to do some thinking, figuring, okay, and probably what we really need to do is just in heavy job, we just need to forget the daily rate stuff. And if it we need to have a list. This is a daily rate, or this is daily so if you use an attachment, you put down eight. We do it in hours. You put eight hours on it instead of instead of one for all day. Pickup would be eight. An attachment would be, I don't know, put a question mark next to daily rates.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Yep, oops.

Matthias Miller  1:02:53
Okay, sure, trade changes. Yeah, that's this is all. We actually had a note from here, just not with a one of my clients, we started using to do think. And he says he looks at those two things and just gives it a felt sense of weariness anytime he sees them.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:25
But what's it called?

Matthias Miller  1:03:26
We have, we just put down a little flag to do thank when there's something that he needs to think about. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:03:36
I thought you're talking some sort of a software.

Matthias Miller  1:03:39
Oh, no, yeah. I Yeah, all right, so then that's equipment. That's what we have on on the equipment side. And then let's go into we do have foundation job stuff. Let's go ahead and pull that up

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57
and

Unknown Speaker  1:04:00
and that we don't have any heavy job set up for that on that

Speaker 1  1:04:07
end of it going from foundation to heavy job, yeah, because that's coming from heavy bid to heavy job and Heavy bid to foundation.

Speaker 3  1:04:19
So this doesn't need to. I mean, yes, it needs to, but it we can't correlate heavy bid. We can't have this push to heavy bit,

Speaker 1  1:04:31
right? Heavy bid needs push to Foundation, yes and yeah, the job.

Matthias Miller  1:04:40
Okay, can we let's see well,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
so

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
we have Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:04:54
so, well, we can't do anything with this anyway. Well, I guess we could. Theoretically. I. What stuff needs to come back from heavy job into foundation.

Speaker 1  1:05:08
As far as the screen we're looking at right now, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:13
it'll match by okay

Speaker 2  1:05:16
contract that's going to come from heavy bid.

Speaker 3  1:05:21
Oh, yeah. Well, he's, he's thinking something else. Remember what we talked about last time, about heavy bid, heavy job. How you we take it from heavy bid to heavy job, and then that comes into foundation.

Speaker 1  1:05:36
But it does it. It goes heavy bid to heavy job and heavy bid to foundation. It doesn't go heavy bid to heavy job and then foundation. Yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  1:05:47
right. We had talked about doing heavy bid to heavy job to foundation, so that there's a sequential flow. But we can, well, I guess if, but if you want bids to come into foundation before they're accepted, I don't know the full, I forget the full details of that, then we would need to do heavy bit heavy job and heavy bid to foundation.

Speaker 4  1:06:10
No, it currently goes heavy bid to heavy job, heavy job to foundation. Okay, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
what I thought. But okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
I I stand corrected. Do you hear the correction?

Matthias Miller  1:06:26
Yeah, I think so. So So then, and I guess the question then is, does heavy job? Do we want to when it when a job gets created in a heavy job, do we want to automatically create it in foundation? Yes, okay, so then job, I'm assuming job number needs to get set, and that's the linking field, yeah, description, yep, customer,

Speaker 1  1:06:52
customer, we use on a sporadic basis, but that's something that it needs to come in, Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:59
Yeah, but it's not all going to be heavy.

Speaker 2  1:07:04
We currently, you're entering that by hand, right? Yeah. I mean, it should come from heavy bid.

Speaker 3  1:07:14
Well, we might be able to pull from pre con, but

Speaker 1  1:07:19
heavy, bid gives us the option. So really, in reality, heavy bid needs to be set up. Project manager is something we don't use. Yeah, we do. I take it back, but that's something that probably you're going to be entering instead of heavy bid entering.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:39
Yeah, well, that's probably right, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
Division,

Matthias Miller  1:07:45
yeah. So that doesn't sink, it's manually set. Is that what you're

Speaker 1  1:07:48
saying, correct? Okay, uh, geographical area we don't use. That's

Speaker 4  1:07:54
where it doesn't make whether it's contracted. Tnn, that's where we designate whether it's contract or TNM, because there is no other place.

Speaker 1  1:08:05
Oh, gotcha. Well, I take that back geographical area we use, but we're using it as a user defined field that has nothing to do with geographical area. We're designating it contract or TNM in the geographical area. Why in the world? We do that?

Speaker 4  1:08:27
Because there's nowhere to designate whether it's, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:08:31
that's, that's what happens when you don't get custom fields. You gotta put it somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
We're in 2025 not 2011 Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:08:41
So the geographical area, is that something that needs exported, or is that just the something that you take care of, entering that's

Unknown Speaker  1:08:54
going forward, which I guess the question is, what should it

Speaker 1  1:08:59
be? I say you need to enter because we're using custom field on this end. On the other end, there is a geographical area in heavy bid

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09
that I acknowledge the same, yeah, it

Matthias Miller  1:09:12
doesn't matter if it's not the same, if, if heavy bid or heavy job has,

Speaker 3  1:09:17
well, we don't do T and M heavy bid DNA stuff never hits the heavy bed, so that's gonna have to be first input.

Speaker 1  1:09:33
This. This is like picking up a rock and you realize there's five more rocks under it, with five more rocks under each one of those rocks, and

Matthias Miller  1:09:41
then when you pick up the last one, you see all kinds of little crawly things scurrying around. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:09:48
Project class, that is something that.

Matthias Miller  1:09:52
So you could side note, if we wanted to, we could, we could auto set geographic, we could auto set contract. For jobs that we create it again if we want to. I'm not saying that we need to, but,

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
or do you want to just set manually? Either way is fine. Don't care.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:18
You're talking auto set which one

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
geographical area, auto said geographical area to contract, or whatever you call it, whatever the value is for anything coming from,

Speaker 1  1:10:30
I would leave that one blank. Let's skip that one. And that's pretty easy for Bruce to you have to do it sooner or later, so it drives the web schedule, yeah, and then the project class, currently we're, you're using it,

Speaker 4  1:10:51
right? Yes, agricultural, commercial, industrial, public works, residential,

Speaker 1  1:10:54
and I would like to see that get pushed over from heavy bid account, from having been a spreadsheet that we have

Speaker 2  1:11:03
is that, because we don't use it in heavy bid, okay, so,

Matthias Miller  1:11:07
but you could add a custom field in heavy bid if you wanted to. Again, I'm not saying you should, but I'm saying you could.

Speaker 1  1:11:17
I would have to dig into that a little bit to find out. Maybe,

Speaker 1  1:11:33
where that cut back, we need to look at what our options are in heavy bid, what the options are in heavy job, as

Speaker 3  1:11:40
far as custom stuff, we could do all of this through pre con, because pre con is all user defined fields that we can link to, heavy job and heavy bed at the same time, We might be able to do something with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
That's a totally separate software?

Speaker 3  1:12:04
Well, it's not software that's cloud based. We might have to look at that one, but we might be able to do everything because we can put as many custom fields as we want in pre con and name them whatever, and then you could correlate them however you want.

Speaker 1  1:12:27
But how do you how? How does the information get into

Speaker 3  1:12:31
pre con? It's, it stinks from heavy bid or heavy job, right? But we have to manually enter but we're manually entering it right now anyway,

Speaker 1  1:12:41
so, so what I'm saying is we need to look at heavy bid and see what the standard out of the box options are. And there's a lot of that we don't use just because sometimes we're lazy. But there's, there's options in there that I think. There's options for geographical area, there's options for estimator,

Speaker 3  1:13:02
estimator dates, we put all that stuff in most of the time.

Speaker 1  1:13:10
We need a little follow up on that. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
Anything else, Project classes, where we're at.

Matthias Miller  1:13:26
Contract, retainage, any of this stuff,

Speaker 1  1:13:30
we definitely need that. We need the original estimated cost. We need the retainage percentage

Speaker 3  1:13:40
and original estimate, which one of those would come out of heavy bid, both of them, what's different

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
contractors, revenue estimate, cost and cost.

Speaker 3  1:13:56
And then retainage is something that somebody puts in later.

Speaker 1  1:14:01
Well, that should come across from heavy bid.

Speaker 3  1:14:05
We can't put retainage in short of a holding account, which we never

Speaker 1  1:14:10
do before. It's retainage is a percentage, not a dollars.

Speaker 3  1:14:14
Well, yeah, even if there's a 5% we never know that until we get the job

Speaker 2  1:14:22
we do whoever's bidding. It should know what the retainage is. Well, I'm not saying that they don't go looking for it, but they should know that, so that that can come from heavy bid, pretty easy, through heavy job, I assume. And some of this, I'm not I'm not convinced that some of this will come through heavy job,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
the Payroll Tax Group, what is that

Speaker 4  1:14:56
it's always set to? Uh, Indiana, no local. Some states have a local tax. So the Payroll Tax Group for us is a non issue. So that's a

Unknown Speaker  1:15:12
constant.

Speaker 1  1:15:14
The job status, if it comes in, it's always an active job. And if that changes, it would change in foundation, or would it change in heavy job?

Speaker 3  1:15:26
Thinking foundation? Does Jeff change that and push to you? Or is that neither one?

Speaker 4  1:15:31
I manually change it in

Speaker 1  1:15:35
foundation. So can we push job status back up to heavy job? You push it down

Matthias Miller  1:15:46
so you want job sets, when you deactivate, when you change the job status in foundation, it pushes back into the heavy job. Yeah, yeah. As long, as long as the real complexity starts showing up if you, if you want to get fancy about being able to change it in either place, but as long as there's clear boundaries about what goes in which direction

Speaker 1  1:16:09
I want, I want to get fancy and whatever you change it neither place does it the other place. But again, how much is that a $5 problem

Matthias Miller  1:16:21
or a $50,000 problem? I mean, that's a double or triple the complexity of the project. Yeah, likely the, I mean, yeah, it's, it's triple the complexity. And here's why. First of all, now you need to to, you need to, you need to automatically resolve which one was was most recently modified so you know who wins. And then if there's a collision, you need to go ask a person and the sinking stops. So you need a way for people to manually resolve collisions when they both change. Yep, I

Speaker 1  1:17:04
currently, Jeff changes it when it gets a certain point. You change it when it gets certain point. Neither one of you communicate between each other, saying, right, so it needs to go from foundation and if it's if it's a completed job, what needs to send it up the foundation or to have a job?

Matthias Miller  1:17:27
Well, the other way we can effectively do it, there's there is another way to do it, as long as you can also say that if it's completed in either side, it completes it in the other so you can never,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:38
well, if you don't want that,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
go ahead. Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:17:44
well, I mean, yeah, the downside is, and if that happens by accident, then you gotta, you gotta reopen it in both places. That does resolve the collision issue, though.

Speaker 1  1:17:53
I like what you just said. If either side of it says, hey, it's, it's, it's completed, or whatever, then it's done.

Speaker 3  1:18:04
But like virtue that we held, they held retaining John for a year and a half, right? Jeff doesn't want to look at something for a year and a half for no reason,

Speaker 4  1:18:13
right? And I don't want to close in that exactly

Speaker 1  1:18:17
where we say that you want to, you want to change it on your end when you want to, and you want Jeff to change it on his end when he wants to and not try and sync it. Because we really don't care. You don't care whether it's shown as an open job on that end or not, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
That would kind of be my take. Our rule

Speaker 1  1:18:37
of thumb is, if we haven't, if we haven't had any time on it for three months. We mark it as either complete or inactive and heavy job,

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
sure. Well, I mean, you could also have a, I mean, this is getting fancy now, but you could, you could automate that. There's no time track to have a process that goes goes through all active jobs that don't have anything traction last three months and close them out.

Speaker 1  1:19:11
Let's save your new car for later.

Matthias Miller  1:19:15
Let's just try to put wheels on the job status. So job this Job says, Get Set doesn't get doesn't sink beyond that.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:31
Cost basis. I don't have a clue either. We'll see options, units and lump sum

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44
cost status, I'm going to say doesn't need to sink.

Speaker 2  1:19:52
And what's the certified payroll would that that doesn't need to sink, does it?

Speaker 4  1:19:58
I don't know that that would. I mean prevailing wage jobs,

Speaker 1  1:20:02
but that's not something that everything send or so is job type under certified payroll?

Speaker 4  1:20:10
No. Job type is always budget, okay? If you don't have a budget, you can't put cost codes in,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:19
right? So that's,

Speaker 1  1:20:22
if it comes over, it's automatically going to be budget, right, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33
the tax exempt should come from heavy bid, right? What about an exemption certificate that doesn't necessarily come

Speaker 4  1:20:46
from everything? No, well, I mean, no, I wouldn't think so.

Speaker 2  1:20:50
Okay, there's no spot. What about tax authority? Do we use that at all if it's

Speaker 4  1:21:05
if it's tax exempt, then that gets changed to no tax if it's not tax exempt, then that needs filled in with Indiana sales tax.

Speaker 1  1:21:18
Gotcha. So that seems like, if it comes over from heavy bid shows as tax exempt, then you can do you can change those to the way you want them.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:35
Yeah, okay,

Speaker 1  1:21:38
verify po sub distribution versus job budget. I don't know what that is, but no idea. No idea. I obviously don't use it.

Matthias Miller  1:21:45
One question I have on customers. Fun thing we're going to have to talk about how to map customers between systems. It's never as easy as it looks on the surface. Is there? Is there a, first of all, is there a customer ID that maps between your systems? That would be the perfect

Speaker 4  1:22:11
world. Well, in foundation, there's a customer. Well, okay, obviously

Unknown Speaker  1:22:15
we have a name.

Speaker 1  1:22:19
We as in heavy bid you're asking, is there a customer ID that goes across all systems, across all the company?

Matthias Miller  1:22:31
Yes, and I'm assuming that. I mean, how do you handle it when two John Smiths both decide to have you work for that you know do work for them. And what happens when John smith@gmail.com has, what if he has a personal project and he's got a business project, you got the same email like so what's How do you know?

Speaker 1  1:22:55
Yeah, job of numbers is what we go by more than anything else. If we're talking across company. Now, if we look for just a client list, then Bruce would be the one with the client list in foundation,

Matthias Miller  1:23:18
Bruce in your customer setup like, I mean, does this function similar to QuickBooks, where you've got a name, contact info, you know, other types of related information, or is this just literally a drop list of names of customers?

Speaker 4  1:23:35
Yeah, it has the customer number, which would be the the key, and then a sort name, which I'm not real sure what the sort name accomplishes, but a name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, so and

Unknown Speaker  1:23:53
so forth. And the customer number is not a number is it

Unknown Speaker  1:23:58
is not. So could, but there again, can't change, right, right?

Speaker 1  1:24:09
Yeah, Brinkman construction, the customer numbers, Brinkman

Unknown Speaker  1:24:15
and those do have to be unique.

Matthias Miller  1:24:19
But does this get mapped. I mean, is there any Okay, so then on the heavy bid and heavy job side, do you enter, do you have the ability to enter all that customer information where you have an actual customer record, or is it just a customer name

Unknown Speaker  1:24:32
that you put in there? Freak on. We can which you can set it up in heavy bid, but it does not work good at all.

Speaker 1  1:24:46
So heavy job is just look heavy job has the option for a job number it open up. Heavy job was good job. Set up. Better not go so set up. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:03
job information, are you a touch screen?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:06
I must be touchscreen.

Speaker 2  1:25:13
You must be so I'll set up values, cost, types, loss factors, cost, good structure out of there, miscellaneous. Okay, there's

Speaker 4  1:25:34
the address, but that's, is that the job address? Well, let's see anything to do with Miller.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:45
There's the accounting information,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:51
black and long overview,

Speaker 2  1:25:58
job review preferences. I don't think that's anything to do with it.

Speaker 1  1:26:04
I'm not seeing anything in heavy job that allows for a customer

Speaker 2  1:26:09
close, that allows for a customer specific name.

Matthias Miller  1:26:15
I kind of wonder if Bruce wins the award of selecting the customer and then putting all of that information, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:24
seems like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:31
I don't see anything, okay.

Speaker 3  1:26:37
How much does it complicated if you pull certain sections from certain places and certain things from other places,

Matthias Miller  1:26:46
so long as you can, as long as you can key things off. You know, it's not trying to give you too accurate of an answer. It generally not that much, but it does depend a little bit if most of the stuff, I would be a little surprised if we can do all everything that we want to do, just with flat file exports. So if you're doing that with flat file exports, it could potentially get tricky, but even that, I don't know. It's not terrible.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:23
The pre con, it draws data from heavy bid, heavy

Speaker 3  1:27:29
job, and, well, heavy bid, some from heavy job, once it's an actual job, and then user input. So

Speaker 1  1:27:41
Preca, it might be worth you giving him a tour of precon, just showing him what it is. And that may be a like say it's already correlating a lot of the stuff behind the scenes. There's some that maybe we can rethink exactly where the information comes from.

Speaker 3  1:28:01
Because if Yeah, okay, you pull the job number and description and some stuff from heavy job, but then customer, yeah, we could put that in precon. We've got a list that's two miles long. Yeah, that's in there. The original contract amount is in, but that could come through heavy job easily. There's, there's a lot of stuff that, yeah, you could fight yourself trying to get it, or you could pick it somewhere else, and that might be easier. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:28:34
Does precon let you, does it automatically pull from heavy bit, heavy job? Could we? Could we use them good?

Speaker 3  1:28:43
You can force it to but I'm not sure how that works, being cloud based and not not sitting on our server.

Matthias Miller  1:28:54
I just wonder if we could make that be the can that be the Traffic Director to push data in and out.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:29:04
you might have, there's all kinds of questions. You might have latency issues. I don't know, who knows

Speaker 3  1:29:11
well, and it only updates every 24 hours, or something like that. But I think they're speeding it up, or they're trying to to once an hour or whatever, but you you could at least look at it and see what you think. I guess sure

Matthias Miller  1:29:31
think it's worth. It's worth keeping it on the radar. Well, how are you guys doing? That's 90 minutes.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:42
Bruce's stomach is about to eat a hole in his backbone.

Speaker 1  1:29:50
It's up to you. I mean, we're good for another half hour if you want to, and if you're wanting to get going, I'm have no problem heading down some place, some. What else?

Matthias Miller  1:30:01
All right, let's, let's do, I got another I got another half an hour. Let's see if we can. Let's see if we can push through. Wow, I don't know. Let me take, let's take a, let's take a giant step back. So Foundation was where we got the most resistance with integration, right? Yeah, remember, right, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:30:39
I think, Well, really, there's nothing much more to do. Hang on and the API that you showed was that you sent chat was, where was that one trying

Unknown Speaker  1:31:01
to remember

Speaker 1  1:31:04
basically what it what it feels, wire, oh yeah, field, wire, oh yes. And that's, that's something different. Yeah, I don't know if we've hardly even touched on that, but

Speaker 3  1:31:20
let's get the some stuff done before we try and complicate and stuff.

Speaker 1  1:31:25
I tend to agree with that. That was, I just stumbled across that information yesterday, and I'm like, Hmm, that might come in handy. Why don't we put that on the on the wish list instead of the need list? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:40
okay, well,

Matthias Miller  1:31:42
let's, let's keep pushing through foundation. If you guys are game, it's a little bit of a marathon. But if you guys are game, let's push through as much of the foundation screenshots as we can, and then, and then grab, we'll grab the rest of the screenshots next time, so we can fill in the missing pieces, which should give us, theoretically, cross your fingers, at least, a very good blueprint of not how the information moves back and forth, not tactically, how, but what information needs to go, where. And I think that'll be, I mean, it's, it should be a, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:32:26
real quick here. This is what I was thinking about. And I haven't followed up on this, but HCSS has something called D is okay, and their description of D is, is. D is will allow you to eliminate double entry by bringing your setups from foundation to heavy job. It keeps your employee list and equipment list in sync. It keeps your budgets in sync, and brings over any new cost codes, such as change order orders. This is all done behind the scenes, multiple times per day. They also have the true up. These are, and to get true up, you have to have D is, but you can have bis without true up. And we had looked into this earlier and said, Yeah, well, that's great, but it's expensive, and it's only HCSS products we want to go bigger. That's where you come in. As I read through that, I'm like, is d is something that would be helpful for what we're doing right now? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:33:40
I think basically d is is going to do.

Speaker 1  1:33:56
I I'll send you this screenshot of what, what they're telling me, and just, it's just information, if it, if it looks interesting, we can dig into that part of it.

Matthias Miller  1:34:13
I think, I mean, you, you could. So here's my take on it, as long as we do the mapping, if you wanted to do this, you could, you could take this as a, as a, some kind of RFP to them and say, Does this does? Does the is support like, here's, here's, here's what we want to do, and here's how we wanted to work, and what does it take for to support it? And I'm going to guess that with some of the code mapping they're going to look at it, and I don't know exactly what they're going to say,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:48
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:53
Okay, yeah. Side trip. You got it now,

Matthias Miller  1:34:57
sweet. I. All right, so anything on

Unknown Speaker  1:35:17
the ARH store, material, Bill,

Speaker 6  1:35:20
I this

Speaker 1  1:35:24
all looks like stuff that the job number, new job number would come from heavy bid.

Matthias Miller  1:35:35
Is this the same job number that's

Unknown Speaker  1:35:36
on? Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:35:38
you're saying it should be the same job number, right? That job, no, that's customer.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:45
So should be like, bring it's got a different

Speaker 1  1:35:47
gotcha. Gotcha, yeah, customer information for jobs, so that would be their job number, not ours, right? We, we basically don't use this screen, right? We use that

Speaker 4  1:36:00
the address fills in from the customer. But, yeah, I don't really do much on that screen, okay, t and m, t and M, I even do less,

Matthias Miller  1:36:16
alright, well, less than nothing's not a lot the I payroll and

Unknown Speaker  1:36:24
payroll, same thing

Unknown Speaker  1:36:28
doesn't come from anywhere. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:36:32
what that is essentially, I'm going to jump forward to the budgets tab.

Matthias Miller  1:36:41
Okay, let's go to the budgets. There we go. All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:49
and that all should come from heavy bid.

Speaker 4  1:36:52
Currently, that all comes from heavy job. I

Speaker 2  1:36:55
import it from right? Heavy job, which starts in heavy bid, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:37:00
but all that is a very easy direct, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:37:09
so you have each, each row has a it's got A cost class, a cost class. It's got a i a a unit amount.

Speaker 3  1:37:24
Go ahead, it's an estimated cost, and then the amount of units for that. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:37:34
and are you guys using uoms Here? Using what units of measure here. I don't

Speaker 3  1:37:44
think it's like equipment's always going to be hours printed. Equipment's always hours.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:51
I'm not sure any

Unknown Speaker  1:37:52
materials is just

Unknown Speaker  1:37:55
yeah, it's just dollars that's coming over, isn't it

Speaker 3  1:37:58
pretty much, yeah. Well, labor is ours. Equipment is ours.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:03
Pull one up and see if you can prove it, Bruce,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:06
because that's just a spreadsheet that you give me.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:14
I mean, yeah, I don't have,

Speaker 1  1:38:18
well, these are just estimate dollars. They're not ours. This is just budget. This is just dollars. So I don't know why the units would be any Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:38:32
or why we'd even use the units portion of it, but where's that Excel spreadsheet come from? Because that looks first that what Excel search? The one you get for,

Speaker 3  1:38:50
I get from you for the cost for a job,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:55
that's a custom query. Gotcha,

Speaker 3  1:38:59
is that for Premier, pulling

Speaker 4  1:39:02
from the the database is directly, not from, I mean, from. It's using the Microsoft query to query the foundation databases.

Speaker 2  1:39:13
Okay, so this is coming over as a cost code and the cost code description, and then this is the budget for that cost code, right? Okay, the bid amount would be just for the cost code, well,

Speaker 1  1:39:29
because you don't even use it in here, have anything in there, the bid about, I think, would be, would come over as, what's the total, and that's that's cost, or that's cost, that's not revenue, but there should always be a quantity and a unit of measure, yes, and it might be a lump sum, but, you know, might be one quantity of a lump sum. Um, or it might be 100 of

Speaker 3  1:40:03
hours. Well, millennial, foot square foot square yards, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:40:10
And currently we, we basically don't use this section in foundation, right, right? Whether we start using it or not, it's, it is pretty easy to correlate to having been heavy job.

Speaker 3  1:40:27
That is something that would be nice to have, very nice.

Matthias Miller  1:40:34
So I'm going to guess that unit of measure sinking. I mean, typically, I'm not really sure how this is set up, but typically unit of units of measure will have also have multipliers for translation between different units, so and depending on the cost cost code, but, But you're so, let's do this. I mean, I think, I think the we

Matthias Miller  1:41:10
have here cost code, I think we should also, do you guys? Do you guys want to go down the path of units of measure, syncing those across,

Speaker 3  1:41:20
it should be a pretty much direct each lump sum, lineal

Speaker 2  1:41:30
foot, square yard, gallons, linear feet, pounds, lump sum, month, percent square feet, square yards, and ton, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:41:43
It, it's a short list that is correlated on both ends.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:52
Okay,

Speaker 1  1:41:54
whether it's necessary or not, I'm I'm not sure whether we use it. We currently don't use it, whether we go down the road and we start using it in here, that's a different story.

Matthias Miller  1:42:16
How much of this stuff, like for things like cost, codes and units of measure. Can we Is that something that changes rarely enough that you can just make sure both systems are set up the same way. Or do you need syncing for the actual which costs

Unknown Speaker  1:42:38
units of measure should always, I

Speaker 1  1:42:39
think that would just, you know, this is set up. Now, I think it's just matter of making sure both systems are set up the same way. What about cost codes? Cost Codes same. It comes from heavy job. Whatever the cost code is, you bring a new a new job in, and the cost codes are all included with it. It's not like Bruce comes in here and changes this That's right,

Speaker 4  1:43:05
other than mid job when a change order cost code is added to heavy job, which in we have to come in here and add it a cost code in foundation.

Speaker 1  1:43:17
But if we get this sink, so, if we get the sink set up, it should take care of that problem.

Matthias Miller  1:43:24
But you're not likely to add a new cost class. Number nine is or wherever we're at, number 12 is now,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:31
and if that's always the same, right?

Matthias Miller  1:43:35
So that's, that's, that's the part that I'm after. If units of measure are added, they need to you. If units of measure are added.

Matthias Miller  1:43:57
So this one, let's do this. This needs to be clarified up here. Your budget actually heavy bid to heavy job. Here. Let's break this down, like this,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:14
heavy,

Matthias Miller  1:44:17
heavy bid to heavy job so that we have the manual, export, import routine.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:27
Let's see codes. This

Unknown Speaker  1:44:31
is currently

Speaker 6  1:44:38
and then here we have the Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:44:49
so let's just clean up these cost codes down here. I'm.

Matthias Miller  1:45:01
All right, so that that's budgets. I mean, that's obviously we gotta figure out where, how, how heavy job or I need. I need to see how heavy job thinks about it. But pretty straightforward, anything else on this one, I Yeah, job comments, or any of these other tabs, I guess. Can we just burst any

Speaker 4  1:45:30
of these? The Union tab only if it's a prevailing wage job,

Speaker 3  1:45:41
and what were you getting that read? Or is that coming from this one? I'm sorry. Are you getting Davis Bacon reads input on yourself? Or is that? Yeah, so that's not something that needs to come over.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:58
I

Unknown Speaker  1:46:02
I wouldn't think so,

Speaker 4  1:46:09
any of the others. And then the UDF tab, I

Speaker 4  1:46:23
and that's just essentially breaking the job up by what's that in dot pre call that we have to do every year? Yeah, they want to know what percentage of our work is those categories,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:43
and that needs to come from every bit. Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:46:52
Well, right now I

Speaker 2  1:46:53
said that's just input. I I don't think we

Unknown Speaker  1:47:00
Well currently we don't, but,

Speaker 3  1:47:02
well, can we even categorize that?

Speaker 2  1:47:06
Is this the 3514 27 1301, one. Where'd that come from? It's just,

Speaker 4  1:47:14
um, your dad does some of them, and the ones he doesn't know, he sends up to Nathan and so then

Speaker 1  1:47:21
you freehand each one of them, right? Okay, that that needs to come from, from Nathan, but are those percentages? Yeah, that's, does that equal it

Unknown Speaker  1:47:35
does Okay?

Speaker 3  1:47:40
And is that just off the tote dollar amount, off that end all pre call, or what?

Speaker 1  1:47:47
That's a question that Nathan I need to look at and figure out whether we can set up heavy bid to push this information out automatically, like based on the cost

Speaker 3  1:47:56
code. Well, we might go do that out of the pre count was the other one, because we have the cost code separated. I think we could figure it

Unknown Speaker  1:48:09
out in theory. If the cost codes are

Unknown Speaker  1:48:13
are consistent,

Speaker 1  1:48:16
then we could, we could assign them all that stuff right there, and it would come in automatically, instead of us have the but

Speaker 3  1:48:25
that has to be per year, right? Yeah, so that's going to have a variable date attached to it, and then X amount of cost codes during that time on active jobs

Speaker 2  1:48:39
it screenshot that send it to, well, everybody here and and send it. Nathan nine,

Matthias Miller  1:48:51
so this, this is, this is the guy who knows nothing about this. So take, take this for what it's worth. But it sounds to me like this. It could almost be better done pulling some kind of custom report out of either foundation or heavy job, yeah, just, just dump it in Excel sheet and and run the numbers,

Speaker 1  1:49:14
yes, and essentially what it is in dot, our pre call For indot, they ask us to specify what percentage of our work is light grading, what percentage is sanitary, less than 12 foot so on so forth. And we have to give them that report each year. That's all this. That's all this is.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:36
This is just for that job, though,

Speaker 1  1:49:38
right? And so each job, we need to break it up by those items, and that is an estimating function to figure out. So I don't think this is a sync problem. I think this is a report problem. I.

Speaker 3  1:50:03
I guess, if this is per per job,

Speaker 1  1:50:09
and we're under, Are we under UDF right here? Yeah, okay, and so you set that up specifically to okay, I would agree with that. I think there's better places that we can get the information, but we do need to figure it out. All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:31
so email this directly. Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  1:50:56
in theory? Well, it doesn't have to be done right now. I

Unknown Speaker  1:51:06
Bruce. Is that still you, or is that

Unknown Speaker  1:51:08
bad? That's Bruce.

Speaker 3  1:51:12
Bruce is getting kind of hungry. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:51:19
I think we can, I think we can wrap. So let's, let's make, make

Matthias Miller  1:51:30
a, let's make some next steps. We need screenshots from

Unknown Speaker  1:51:37
all right,

Matthias Miller  1:51:39
trade to hang on.

Matthias Miller  1:51:51
I lost my folder list. All right, so we need

Matthias Miller  1:52:01
Foundation. We got most of this stuff. We didn't do anything with control board, which that's not a complicated system. We just got to know what we can do or not do

Matthias Miller  1:52:17
have. Let's see what

Matthias Miller  1:52:25
the hours read screenshots of hours worked

Matthias Miller  1:52:37
in both directions. I

Matthias Miller  1:52:44
We Need Foundation equipment.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:52
Screenshots

Matthias Miller  1:52:54
here. Let's do this. Screenshots, hours worked in the

Speaker 6  1:53:00
how

Matthias Miller  1:53:16
was that one? Because we got all of those. This one heavy, let's see we need. I

Matthias Miller  1:53:34
don't know if we need both of these, but we need these jobs. And then, if we need anything related to change orders,

Matthias Miller  1:53:56
I I'm not sure exactly how this works, but

Matthias Miller  1:54:20
and then it's also, it's all the See, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:54:40
I want to make sure the tbds in here are clear of what needs to be done. Time Off, tracking needs to be addressed. That's left over from last time. What is the foundation? Code d3, 60. Think through how to handle daily. Rates, project, class, how do we want to potentially handle that? UDF, the reporting, then the on the on the change orders we may need to talk through, be ready to talk through different types of change orders and how they need to flow. And so I think, I think another sprint would get us like like we did today, would get as awfully close to being able to put something together, to go to foundation and HCSS and say this is what we're looking to do. What API or what other access can we have to do this? Mm,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:05
so that's you

Matthias Miller  1:56:06
guys see anything I'm missing?

Speaker 1  1:56:12
Sure it'll come up. But it seems to me like we've made a good stab at it.

Matthias Miller  1:56:16
Yeah. Well, we keep we keep turning chaos and uncertainty into into some level of clarity here. So,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:25
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:56:29
no, I would say everything he said, will rather get that. Let's see if we can dig through it, any of it our own, get some of it straightened out, and set another meeting for follow up. And

Matthias Miller  1:56:44
how much time do you want between now next time?

Unknown Speaker  1:56:48
I really don't care.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:54
Week, week and a half, whatever

Speaker 2  1:56:56
I would say, not next week, the week after

Unknown Speaker  1:57:03
so sometime the week of the 18th.

Matthias Miller  1:57:06
So we can, either I can either have Audra coordinated, or we, or we could do same time in a couple of weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:14
Two weeks I'll be gone.

Speaker 1  1:57:17
Sounds like, sounds like, maybe, are you leaving on Thursday or Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday? What time

Unknown Speaker  1:57:24
i i can't remember.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:27
It'll say Tuesday or

Unknown Speaker  1:57:28
Audrey. Can Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:57:31
coordinate that then. And I won't. I won't. If I do too much, I screw everything up. So, good. Sounds good?

Speaker 1  1:57:42
Okay, yeah, thank you. Appreciate it. I think we're making progress. I agree.

Matthias Miller  1:57:47
Glad to help and talk to you guys in a bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:50
Okay, thank you. Have a good day.

Matthias Miller  1:57:53
Thanks. You too. Eat some lunch. Bruce, you.
