Unknown Speaker  00:48
Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  00:49
Good morning. Seth,

Unknown Speaker  00:53
how's Colorado?

Speaker 1  00:57
We are enjoying a change of seeing the seasons. Yes, for sure.

Matthias Miller  01:03
Last night, I went home a little early yesterday afternoon, and it would get outside. It's

Unknown Speaker  01:09
like, nice, upper 60s or whatever. It's just like,

Unknown Speaker  01:13
yeah, yeah, for sure.

Matthias Miller  01:15
Give me free.

Speaker 2  01:18
Oh, it will shortly. Just give it two months a month,

Matthias Miller  01:23
the other freaks, can we just Gotcha? How's life in Kansas?

Speaker 2  01:28
Oh, pretty good. It's hectic enough, but it's good staying busy between work and I don't know what all life just fills up, but I've been in Kansas for over a month now. Haven't visited Michelle, so, oh boy, gonna be another like, almost three weeks. So that's long enough.

Matthias Miller  01:52
That is long enough.

Unknown Speaker  02:01
Welcome peoples,

Unknown Speaker  02:04
Good Morning bells,

Matthias Miller  02:05
good morning, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  02:21
Okay, try this again. Now

Speaker 2  02:22
you can hear me. We can hear yes sir,

Speaker 3  02:25
all right. It helps to set the have the settings correct.

Speaker 4  02:30
Now we can see two starring office, or your second story office.

Unknown Speaker  02:36
Oh, for Pete's sake,

Speaker 2  02:37
my second story office, I

Speaker 3  02:45
it, listen, I've got a top floor office with a view.

Matthias Miller  02:50
That's, it's like the Salisbury penthouse suite, kind of,

Unknown Speaker  02:55
yeah, right into a tree.

Unknown Speaker  02:57
Right into a tree. Nice.

Matthias Miller  03:02
Next. Time, I've got a friend who has office space at the bank building, which is one of the tallest office spaces, which is, like, all of maybe five stories or something I don't know. So next time, when I call, I'm gonna have to, you know, boost my ego a little bit, maybe just see if I can hop in there to take my call to feel better about myself.

Speaker 2  03:26
That just made me realize we have a top floor office. So yes, you do, yep.

Unknown Speaker  03:38
Well, that puts you and I honestly Yeah.

Matthias Miller  03:45
Well, I have, I have, well, okay, this is gonna say, I feel like I'm beneath you guys, but I'm at 5000 feet elevation. Maybe she.

Speaker 4  04:03
Uh, well, should we obviously Dwayne and beyond called the which I think is good to be, so he's up to speed on what's happening in the accounting side of things, so that when people come to him with questions, he's up to speed on that. So

Speaker 3  04:33
yeah, I feel like I've been, I've been asked numerous times lately about stuff, and I'm like, I have to go ask. So maybe I should maybe I should know.

Unknown Speaker  04:48
So

Speaker 4  04:51
my thought was, well, we'll cover a few things, three projects highlighted in yellow that said that. Think those had been you plan to wrap those up last and then the three projects highlighted in blue, these are paper cut projects that we would like to see if we could fit those in alongside those times, and then see if there's anything on sales tax we just look at but sure did that? How did that sound advice? Do you have something else we could be looking at as well, or okay? And then again, our meeting schedule. We're meeting again on Monday and then again Thursday, so, and then, yeah, we should be back on a normal schedule. I guess we should look at or the 31st of the normal Thursday schedule work for then i Um,

Unknown Speaker  06:03
let me check something. I

Speaker 1  06:30
um, my wife is leaving town that weekend, and she's flying on two different airlines. I don't remember

Speaker 1  06:49
what she's leaving with rather, yeah, here June 21 is when I bought two degree fault. Now it's the wrong one, all right.

Unknown Speaker  07:22
Give me one second. I can find it. Augustine three is when I got the tickets.

Unknown Speaker  07:36
I well, I don't know. I

Matthias Miller  08:00
I'm gonna have to get back to you on that. Okay, that's

Unknown Speaker  08:10
fine. So then let's jump into the three projects said that we're working on any

Speaker 2  08:19
Yeah, the two paper cuts are both should both be. I think those should both be through already. The asset stuff was Joel had limited availability last week, and I was needing to review stuff with him to just get his input on it. It is 95% done. There's a little bit of cleanup. He's out at a conference for the next few days, but then I'll wrap that up with him Friday. So I started on sales tax a bit yesterday and today, just starting to work on Fielding and stuff. But

Speaker 4  08:55
would it make jumping down to number three on the regardless? Would it make sense to do that with the at the other asset? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  09:05
that'd be easy enough to do.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
I mean, if it's, you know,

Unknown Speaker  09:14
that's should be very fast.

Speaker 4  09:17
Okay, so you're thinking that could be done with the other asset stuff, and then go live over, yeah,

Speaker 2  09:23
okay, what was the, what was our design we just wanted to make. So if does it need to be required, if it's sold or abandoned, but not other than that, like at some point you need, you think, if you're saying it's abandoned, well, it should have been in service at some point, probably or not.

Speaker 4  09:47
Yeah, and then, as it required, it would also have, I mean, it's also required in order, yeah, to start to appreciate, like, yes.

Speaker 5  10:01
It be the signal to start depreciating and stop adding expenses to it. But at any point is it necessarily required,

Speaker 4  10:10
not really. I mean, I think so. The thought would be that, say, today, you put an asset in service as of today, and I think it starts depreciating November 1, like the first following on,

Speaker 2  10:26
yeah, okay, so then we should say, if there No it won't. Basically, I'm going to make sure if we have it set, we don't clear it and cause weird stuff to happen, like if we've set it and there were, we now have depreciation transactions. We shouldn't be we shouldn't clear the in service date.

Speaker 5  10:50
Does that sound right? Would not clear it just, just don't require it when setting up new homes. Sure, and we can. There's only a handful that would we'll just go clear those manually.

Speaker 4  11:04
Okay, okay, you're saying once, yeah, what, what you did is just you moved out the date and put in service to end of the year like 1231

Speaker 2  11:15
Okay, okay, I think I know what to do. It'll take a little bit, but not much okay,

Unknown Speaker  11:25
and then four and five,

Speaker 4  11:32
I think core would well The ability to add memo link the accounting transactions to we

Speaker 5  11:43
have memo links in invoices and a number of things. Okay, can't do it, you know, if there's, if it's only a like for transactions that don't connect back to a vendor, something like that, I have no way to so I need a memo link there. Yeah, for me, I don't need it would be nice.

Speaker 2  12:02
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking where that is. It shouldn't that also shouldn't, shouldn't be too much to do.

Speaker 5  12:16
At the top of the vendor invoices, there's that little number in brackets on what you call it for using for memo links make that appear on the transactions, so that we can take those over to vendor invoices or wherever, to that transaction as well. Both ways.

Speaker 2  12:36
I'll have to look into that. I'm looking at the settings here. I'm not quite sure. Matthias, do you know offhand why it's not working for transactions? I don't

Matthias Miller  12:48
know that we've ever set it up. The main thing you would need to do is coordinate

Speaker 1  12:55
with Ellis and or Joel on what prefixes we want to use for transactions. Um, it's, it's just never been.

Matthias Miller  13:09
The issue is we want a like the equivalent of a PC ID or incident ID, yeah,

Speaker 2  13:14
yeah, right, yeah. But I thought we're maybe wanting to put, be able to put the vendor invoice number in at a transaction memo. Is that works,

Matthias Miller  13:24
but we want to be able to do the opposite. We want to be able to paste a transaction ID into a vendor invoice, right? Gotcha

Speaker 2  13:34
both ways, because the vendor invoice to transaction should work. I think,

Matthias Miller  13:43
yeah, no. Vendor invoice to change. Like,

Speaker 2  13:46
if you put a vendor invoice ID in a transaction memo, it should work to open it Correct, correct. But the other way that isn't set up at this point. We don't have any way to reference transactions that way, but I can set it up. I just need to know. Just, yeah, I'll check. Okay, I know what's happening going forward. Okay.

Speaker 4  14:06
Were you aware that you do that on transactions? Or should we just walk through that and make sure that?

Speaker 5  14:12
I mean, I may, because it's usually

Unknown Speaker  14:17
that way, or something you're going to want, is it not when you create a transaction? Um,

Speaker 5  14:24
it's both ways, because sometimes, like, if there's a journal entry, so if there was a, if there was a vendor invoice or a sales order that required, like, where I run into a lot is sales orders that require some sort of goofy payment, like the guy took, you know, we traded stuff, like, there's some things like that. Well, then the only thing to do is through the journal entry. And so I'd like to be able to connect that journal entry back to that thing.

Speaker 2  14:57
So do you I mean, looking at it, looking. The code, it looks like we should be able to, do you have a VI prefix and then the ID, it should link like, if you're in a transaction memo, you have that ID in there, it should link across. Are you wanting to be able to click on a are you wanting to from a vendor invoice or any other record be able to go to a transaction

Unknown Speaker  15:24
Correct. Okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  15:28
good, I'll get that set up.

Unknown Speaker  15:38
Good, there you want to that should be fine, and then require status and vendor invoice. This is something that we

Speaker 4  15:46
talked about before we ran into this. I forget what issues exactly to cause. Were we? I

Speaker 5  15:56
think it was just a duplication situation. We might have paid something I didn't need paid, or something like that out of it, but that's what it was.

Speaker 2  16:09
Okay. Yeah, we are we still waiting on confirmation from Josh on that? Or can I just go ahead and make it required?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Oh, that's what we were,

Unknown Speaker  16:24
I don't know if we asked him or not i i was

Unknown Speaker  16:28
thinking we had sent him an email, but maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  16:35
Okay, well, I'd say, let's go ahead it just

Speaker 2  16:38
yeah, we sent him an email. Matthias sent an email on the 19th of September

Unknown Speaker  16:44
and he he never

Unknown Speaker  16:45
replied.

Unknown Speaker  16:55
So can we just go check with him?

Unknown Speaker  16:59
Yeah, should I reach out to him? Or do you guys want to reach out?

Speaker 2  17:02
Then I I mean, I'm happy not to, but

Matthias Miller  17:10
it seems like it seems like a great thing to add on your college into the have his full undivided attention and get an answer.

Speaker 4  17:22
Oh, I don't know, is it, is it worth spending any time going over the rest of the paper? Cut projects, dude six and

Speaker 4  17:37
reprioritize the others. But if we're not going to do any work on them before Monday. So anyway, then I think it's,

Speaker 2  17:45
yeah, I won't, I won't get to any of those, sure, any of the additional ones,

Speaker 5  17:49
um, one that was on here that I think was supposed to be done, and go through an update the quick vendor invoice entry page. Yes, we had some issues there. Yeah, um, was that all through the update? What I'm what I'm still seeing is I get some that go through and they they create with one. I can show you one here. I

Speaker 2  18:25
I'm checking when the system are you seeing? My changes weren't aren't through yet, because Josh updated on Thursday and I made my changes on Friday. Got

Unknown Speaker  18:38
it okay. So

Speaker 2  18:40
be working then, I think last week, well, it was supposed, I mean, I coded it on Friday, so I expected there to be an update on Friday evening or Saturday, and that didn't happen. Yeah, I still don't quite understand the schedule for when it gets updated. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  18:57
Okay, then don't worry about it. We'll watch for it to go away later

Matthias Miller  19:05
that the schedule is a combination between, Oh, we lost them. It's a combination between combination between when we ask for it, when Josh feels like it, and when the dev code base is in an acceptable form to do an update, fair enough. So, yeah, if we, I guess we should probably, if there are things that we specifically want to go live, we do need to communicate it to Josh. I don't mind being the person to communicate that to him. I usually have a fairly good year from him on that. So yeah,

Speaker 2  19:51
I would be pretty happy if it doesn't go live quite yet with asset stuff that's 95% done. But. Which it would probably be fine. There's just a few calculations that I want to go over with Joel before.

Unknown Speaker  20:06
It's rare, but Joel will be

Matthias Miller  20:13
back in before the weekend.

Speaker 2  20:15
No, he will be on Friday. There should be another weird in inner like, middle of the week one, but those are not worried about it.

Unknown Speaker  20:23
Joel, yeah, cool,

Speaker 4  20:28
good. So I think that covers that anything we should look anything on sales tax that we still have it on our list to create an import on cell, storage, sale, dollars, payments, deposits, uh, which

Unknown Speaker  20:46
we don't have yet. Um, assuming that's not something that you need at I

Unknown Speaker  20:52
don't need it yet. So,

Speaker 4  20:58
um, I guess the other question, while this is that I listed there. Should we look at importing all sales tax payments in 2024, of these payments, to correctly show this history. What's your thought on that drew like the wanting to put all sales in the same

Speaker 4  21:20
basically, have all of our sales tax within us. Is so so far this year, you would go to the Self Storage software, get that sales report and the sales tax report payoff

Speaker 5  21:37
bit. Well, either way we're going to have to do we're going to have to figure out what it is because we're recording all the money that shows up in the bank as sales, some of it is worse accrued sales tax liability. So so somewhere or another, we're going to have to cut that piece out so it could be done by just a sales upload, if we get that together of all 2024 or figuring out what it is and just do a journal truth.

Speaker 4  22:09
So what if we figure out how to do an upload like moving forward, we can do a monthly update, update, but then we go back and we say, okay, let's do for everything year to date, 2024 and before we run that out load, we delete all the like, do we have an easy way to identify those payments? Like on the bank they're they're identified

Unknown Speaker  22:32
in everything in that account.

Speaker 4  22:35
Oh, they're all put in the same account. So we could go delete all of those imports. They're

Speaker 5  22:40
all just transactions, but not sales orders, at least. So that would affect

Unknown Speaker  22:47
that idea. I mean, I don't know that is that

Unknown Speaker  22:58
good.

Unknown Speaker  23:00
So anything on sales tax reporting?

Speaker 2  23:04
I'm just getting started. I've put probably two hours in it at this point for me, so I don't really have questions yet. I'm not far enough in to be falling in the weeds yet.

Speaker 4  23:18
So is there anything Dwayne I don't know if you look through the the the design on it, or any any questions that we should cover that you have on that.

Speaker 3  23:34
No, although you piqued my interest a little bit on this whole what we paid in 2024 because I'm, I'm curious how you're going to reconcile some of that beings that, I mean, if sales orders canceled out of that and we paid sales tax, how are we going to reconcile some of that?

Speaker 4  23:55
Okay, I was talking specifically about the sales storage income. Oh,

Speaker 3  24:00
gotcha, gotcha, disregard then, okay, no, I haven't, I haven't read this deeply enough to have any questions yet.

Unknown Speaker  24:11
Okay, well, then I think that's yeah, that's all we have. End of Oh, 25 minute call more often. Dwayne

Unknown Speaker  24:26
glad to help and I didn't do anything

Unknown Speaker  24:30
without it. We just need more meetings before we get to anything

Unknown Speaker  24:38
good. Well, yeah, I'd say, well, somebody has it, yeah, if there's nothing else, and we'll get back to work.

Speaker 2  24:47
Yeah, sounds good. I'm guessing I'm gonna go, I mean, you had said that if sales tax end up taking enough time, it's fine, if we spend more time on it, rather than like I've normally been doing 40 hours a month. I. Through you all, I'm, I will likely be going if we try to get sales tax done this month, I'm guessing I'll go over that, because I'm already with fixing up assets and stuff. I'm already, I've used up about half my month's worth already. So

Unknown Speaker  25:16
okay, that's fine. I'd say, yeah.

Speaker 1  25:21
So if I've also got some time, I can throw at it too. If you want to do any peer programming, that would be helpful, sure. And

Speaker 2  25:27
at this point, I'm still just getting the fielding and stuff in, so I don't need it yet, but I'm guessing I will, as might well at some point. So sure, sounds

Unknown Speaker  25:41
good. Thanks guys,

Matthias Miller  25:43
awesome. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  25:45
Thank you. Bye.
