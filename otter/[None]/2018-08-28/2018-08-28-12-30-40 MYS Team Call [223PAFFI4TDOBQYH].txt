Unknown Speaker  00:30
Hey, hey, would you mind making a note to turn off the auto recording on these? Sure. And then go into zoom and delete all the old ones for these. Sure it takes up takes up space. It's not really I don't, I don't think it's necessary.

Unknown Speaker  00:47
Okay. Yeah, I'll do that.

Unknown Speaker  00:52
Let me go for hours

Unknown Speaker  01:01
joining us today. Yeah, you wanna check?

Unknown Speaker  01:05
Sure. slackers,

Unknown Speaker  02:40
so

Unknown Speaker  02:47
you've got the wrong waterfall, laying

Unknown Speaker  02:53
that out

Unknown Speaker  02:57
waterfall.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
He's the one there was, was old.

Unknown Speaker  03:05
So

Unknown Speaker  03:07
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  03:12
sorry. Sorry, my notepad.

Unknown Speaker  03:21
Alright, so we want to help visionary entrepreneurs who want to scale their seven figure company help them by creating software solutions will allow them to offload the responsibility while providing accountability and training and offer insight into their business also provide consulting around setting up systems in their business, the change you want to make is having them start relying on software and systems to do the heavy lifting in their business so that people can do their best work, we will know we are successful when we have 100 businesses in our platform.

Unknown Speaker  03:52
So there's that

Unknown Speaker  03:55
and

Unknown Speaker  04:22
the other one was

Unknown Speaker  04:29
alright, and then

Unknown Speaker  04:32
let's go over the

Unknown Speaker  04:38
this one should also include the

Unknown Speaker  04:44
let's go over the metrics

Unknown Speaker  04:49
here. I can just pull that up.

Unknown Speaker  04:58
Alright, so

Unknown Speaker  05:03
I did not update the BB ones

Unknown Speaker  05:06
we've been planning those are still

Unknown Speaker  05:11
I'm pretty sure those are both five and five.

Unknown Speaker  05:16
And I need to figure out a way to make sure that happens on the weekends for myself

Unknown Speaker  05:27
did hit the 27 the or the I had

Unknown Speaker  05:33
targeted 26 last week hit 27, secretly hoping for 31, but I'll still call it a win

Unknown Speaker  05:44
got a new lead for a software project. It's not a great lead or it's not a it's not immediately but it's definitely somebody we're staying in touch on.

Unknown Speaker  05:53
Just for fun. It is a I did not know this was a thing it was an it's an indoor x throwing x in knife throwing like a I don't want to call it kind of like a shooting gallery. Except you throw axes and knives. And they they accomplished competition. So

Unknown Speaker  06:15
I'm not much into throwing sharp objects. I mean, it wasn't before that didn't think it was before that. But it sounds so much fun to try that we had to find a friend of mine and go through some sharp objects.

Unknown Speaker  06:30
So there's that I'm LinkedIn connections were good 12 weeks out. And I actually bumped it back a week because because FB won't be wrapped up until hopefully the end of this week.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Short term liability.

Unknown Speaker  07:01
Yeah. And then weekly meeting is just added. And that's just accountability for these meetings as well.

Unknown Speaker  07:09
And I think

Unknown Speaker  07:12
I don't know that there's much interesting on that,

Unknown Speaker  07:15
you know, since I'll send you an email. The other thing we need to track is I want to start tracking the number of people to get in front of and so I did two presentations last week. And I have I'll be speaking at 1 Million Cups in Colorado Springs tomorrow. And that's going to be probably about 50 people. And not sure maybe even more.

Unknown Speaker  07:38
So our goal was to 50. So we actually have a really good shot at hitting them. If we can keep finding things like like this. Wow.

Unknown Speaker  07:50
And one of the guys from FEC can do to the guys from FTC can hook me up with the local Lions Club in rotary.

Unknown Speaker  07:59
So that'll be

Unknown Speaker  08:01
more so those are definite wins.

Unknown Speaker  08:08
No, it's a good thing. We do these things because this morning I woke up I'm like, there's absolutely nothing happening. Like what are we actually

Unknown Speaker  08:16
doing and getting done

Unknown Speaker  08:20
so

Unknown Speaker  08:23
more wins

Unknown Speaker  08:25
and helps us

Unknown Speaker  08:30
Yeah, it really does.

Unknown Speaker  08:33
Oh, other good news is one of the leads that was kind of stalled out on this, this is the early childhood development

Unknown Speaker  08:41
didn't have much budget, but they have

Unknown Speaker  08:45
they they have a bleeding neck right now. And so

Unknown Speaker  08:50
their their tone has changed dramatically within the last week. And so I'm meeting with them today which is fantastic.

Unknown Speaker  09:00
You don't have a budget What's that mean? Um, well,

Unknown Speaker  09:08
I think it means they'll make one they have they have some money to pay me the short term they get they get more I mean their budget opens up next month or Yeah, September October

Unknown Speaker  09:21
and I think they're that the point they're starting to feel the pain I mean I've basically told him as much and they're starting to feel the pain

Unknown Speaker  09:32
and

Unknown Speaker  09:35
I think they're much more ready to say hey will beg borrow and steal from other parts of the budget to do what we need to so still still not sure how it will end up it might not be so it probably won't be probably won't have a high profit margin on the project but it's still I think it's a very interesting project to to add to her to her sweet and as long as it it I mean obviously we're not

Unknown Speaker  09:59
we're not done

Unknown Speaker  10:02
plenty good to still make money on it but

Unknown Speaker  10:06
yeah it's intriguing

Unknown Speaker  10:12
then the other thing is

Unknown Speaker  10:15
so going over my wins from last week

Unknown Speaker  10:19
let's see

Unknown Speaker  10:21
let me actually let's see trying to think if there's more about this and what I

Unknown Speaker  10:29
mean yeah got the got the

Unknown Speaker  10:34
the two presentations and actually got the recording

Unknown Speaker  10:44
let's see

Unknown Speaker  10:46
got the Friday presentation recorded so that will give us a video that will be able to use elsewhere

Unknown Speaker  10:55
did presentation on Wednesday faith brothers is is moving ahead with testing

Unknown Speaker  11:01
and let's get the script to the presentation that at 1 Million Cups this week

Unknown Speaker  11:11
so those are my wins my commitments for this week

Unknown Speaker  11:16
Oh another major win is

Unknown Speaker  11:20
your actually this is

Unknown Speaker  11:29
setting up a weekly kind of a planning ceremony with in

Unknown Speaker  11:35
and this will be using this to go over the incidence of the hopefully the waterfall incidents the in the pipeline and making sure that this is provided accountability for sales follow up etc

Unknown Speaker  11:52
and then hopefully we'll get to the point where we're far enough ahead on that game that will have some time to set aside i'd with

Unknown Speaker  12:02
doing more work on what we're going to do for lead generation etc. So that was also a major win

Unknown Speaker  12:12
so for this week I've got

Unknown Speaker  12:15
four leads that I will be following up with we're doing though that 1 Million Cups presentation tomorrow

Unknown Speaker  12:24
I will be I have a friend of mine who invited me to a

Unknown Speaker  12:28
basically it's a it's a group of

Unknown Speaker  12:34
Christian business leaders in Colorado Springs who get in these are these are leaders of

Unknown Speaker  12:42
large ministries that are based in Colorado Springs

Unknown Speaker  12:49
and I'm trying to remember some of the names and I don't believe

Unknown Speaker  12:56
what's Chuck Coulson's minutes whatever his mission he's called one of the name

Unknown Speaker  13:04
managers or directors from from there's part of the group and I don't know so so the basic thing he says is it's not this isn't a it's not a networking group so it's a way to build relationships but out of those relationships is business business forms between friends so let's see if I can make that make it for that about once a month so

Unknown Speaker  13:28
that's tomorrow and then also going for 26 billable hours this week which is going to be a stretch but we're gonna see we can do it

Unknown Speaker  13:41
also and this is kind of just an update on our

Unknown Speaker  13:50
the first piece is last week we had we got the adoption date set for Emily which is little girl we have in our home right now so that'll be in December so that's exciting

Unknown Speaker  14:05
the other major thing is we've been

Unknown Speaker  14:09
we've been working we spent about the past year we've been in contact with an agency in Florida regarding Dante

Unknown Speaker  14:17
Dante his sister who's placed there and we just got word last week that we've been selected as the adoptive family and they're saying would you guys please come down to get to meet her and so we are

Unknown Speaker  14:33
and the answer is of course

Unknown Speaker  14:36
so at this point it looks like I should actually adjust this I've got it on my calendar but will be gone from

Unknown Speaker  14:47
sep tember fifth so it's next Wednesday through that following Monday will be in Florida and so this basically

Unknown Speaker  15:00
maybe it's it slows down a whole bunch of stuff that that we've got going on next anything anything yeah basically won't get much of anything done next week from for myself

Unknown Speaker  15:15
but I'll still I I'll still be in the office on Tuesday I'll be able to make these meetings the next two weeks so we're good

Unknown Speaker  15:27
and I think that's what I've got

Unknown Speaker  15:43
my commitment

Unknown Speaker  15:48
is

Unknown Speaker  15:53
software testing

Unknown Speaker  15:59
the street corners

Unknown Speaker  16:04
and then finished up Bartlett testing

Unknown Speaker  16:11
Dialpad a bit yesterday then

Unknown Speaker  16:17
on the back projects

Unknown Speaker  16:21
and then you just little projects are back here like

Unknown Speaker  16:27
risk free delegation

Unknown Speaker  16:31
fall off as well as

Unknown Speaker  16:37
their Savior following up with them started working on

Unknown Speaker  16:44
following up by a procedure for following up with leads and sneaking

Unknown Speaker  16:52
great structure for falling

Unknown Speaker  17:00
quite a bit last week especially Friday and no

Unknown Speaker  17:07
longer term goals and commitments

Unknown Speaker  17:16
that sums up

Unknown Speaker  17:19
week this week

Unknown Speaker  17:22
working on again the backburner project to finish up reading Cedric or calling leads

Unknown Speaker  17:34
and setting up dial pad all the

Unknown Speaker  17:38
final steps back for it. And

Unknown Speaker  17:45
if you're wondering maybe without legends, it's it's a phone system

Unknown Speaker  17:51
player strings and the crafters

Unknown Speaker  17:55
so

Unknown Speaker  17:58
in profits calls.

Unknown Speaker  18:03
And that's that's all.

Unknown Speaker  18:12
So have you. Have you initiated the port yet?

Unknown Speaker  18:15
Yes, I did. Do

Unknown Speaker  18:17
they have a live date for it?

Unknown Speaker  18:21
I I set a date for

Unknown Speaker  18:28
I think a week from Yes, your day. But I need to see it before

Unknown Speaker  18:37
email. And it looks like something may fail. I'm not really surprised

Unknown Speaker  18:50
that I need an update on that ticket. So I need to go in. And

Unknown Speaker  18:54
it is

Unknown Speaker  18:57
not. It's not surprising. It's not surprising. That kind of annoying. He had

Unknown Speaker  19:04
basically no documentation whatsoever out they had plenty of work in but nothing I'm

Unknown Speaker  19:17
not surprised.

Unknown Speaker  19:20
Yeah, I've never had a port that went completely seamlessly or even went on the first try. So

Unknown Speaker  19:26
but I didn't know if they had a if seven days was kind of there.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
If there was a if they kind of had a

Unknown Speaker  19:34
expected timeframe or or

Unknown Speaker  19:36
what it was that was that was the earliest possible Okay, so left off. I looked on the calendar and that was the first non non grayed out day by selected that day. And it said that they'll let me know wants that's just that it's not guaranteed until work. It's Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:56
cool. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  20:03
And then Heidi, I don't know how you want to. If this if you're moving more out of the maintenance mode. If you still want to do wins and commitments.

Unknown Speaker  20:14
I'm more than open to

Unknown Speaker  20:20
what kind of what works best for you with? Yeah, what you've got going.

Unknown Speaker  20:28
I mean, like last week, I did just basically the maintenance stuff. Um, this week, you said, um, you don't need to go ahead and research some more places for you to speak with us. Is that right? That's correct. But you said just now that, um, what was it the Lions Club? Kiwanis, you have leads for those in Canyon city?

Unknown Speaker  20:47
It's Lions Club and rubbery city. And I will

Unknown Speaker  20:55
I mean, you could probably actually research those to find out the schedule. Okay. I'm, I'm less worried about the

Unknown Speaker  21:04
interrupting my I mean, as long as I have nothing else schedule over that time. Clearly. I don't want to be out of town on that day. I'm less worried about scheduling those in then the Colorado Springs events.

Unknown Speaker  21:18
Okay. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  21:25
alright. So yeah, I'll look into score this week and see if I can get you some possibilities. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:33
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  21:35
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  21:39
Awesome. Um, let me pull up my list again. I'm

Unknown Speaker  21:47
good. Anything else that

Unknown Speaker  21:51
either of you

Unknown Speaker  21:54
need from me this this week?

Unknown Speaker  22:02
I am sort of writing out like my backburner

Unknown Speaker  22:07
project.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
You don't have to come up with stuff. But there are things

Unknown Speaker  22:30
yeah, I sent you an email about the

Unknown Speaker  22:36
Why don't we, um, it you're welcome to stay off, you're welcome to drop off.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Well,

Unknown Speaker  22:47
you could start pursuing hosting leads and start having conversations with them. I don't know that that's,

Unknown Speaker  22:55
that does. That's it's it's not going to be able to, you're not going to be able to fill your days with with that. Because especially with the scheduling,

Unknown Speaker  23:05
I still wish that

Unknown Speaker  23:10
I still wish that I had a better sense of

Unknown Speaker  23:16
a better sense of direction for the

Unknown Speaker  23:23
what we should do with like the LinkedIn leads, or how to

Unknown Speaker  23:28
what to do in regards to the

Unknown Speaker  23:34
risk free risk free delegation booklet. How to get that out.

Unknown Speaker  23:44
So there's a Let me see if I can find it.

Unknown Speaker  23:52
This isn't exactly

Unknown Speaker  24:06
there's a I mean, we could we could

Unknown Speaker  24:11
see, let me see if I can find it.

Unknown Speaker  24:28
The dojo that's what it is.

Unknown Speaker  24:36
See if you can find the video that goes with it.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
Alright, I'll just tell it and upload it back in Slack

Unknown Speaker  25:05
channel

Unknown Speaker  25:08
just a second.

Unknown Speaker  25:17
So send you a video, this kind of is him going through this kind of concept. I don't know that we have to have something exactly like this. But I guess one of the questions is, actually, this is exactly what we should do. You should be doing this. Thanks, Matthias. That's a great idea.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
We have here a whole list of things that

Unknown Speaker  26:00
how many do we have? I don't even know how many. We have a whole bunch of different emails that we've already published. Already done. We could repurpose them into LinkedIn,

Unknown Speaker  26:10
LinkedIn posts,

Unknown Speaker  26:14
the some of these,

Unknown Speaker  26:22
some of these,

Unknown Speaker  26:27
like, this one's a question mark, maybe you could, you could grab some of these. But I probably want to look over them before they before you do this one, possibly, but want to look over them before I do. I'm not I'm not even sure if I'm sold on that. The other places you could pull content out of would be

Unknown Speaker  26:48
out of here.

Unknown Speaker  26:54
If you're wanting to

Unknown Speaker  27:00
what else do we have

Unknown Speaker  27:02
if you wanted to, if you wanted you enjoyed writing

Unknown Speaker  27:13
somewhere here we have.

Unknown Speaker  27:23
We've got like boo Koos of content ideas,

Unknown Speaker  27:38
all so all these ideas and you're sharing our

Unknown Speaker  27:44
Well, that's kind of what I'm thinking. I mean, even thinking LinkedIn should be our focus.

Unknown Speaker  27:50
I think that's kind of what makes the most sense,

Unknown Speaker  27:53
given where we're at. I'm not completely posted to Facebook. But I guess my thing is, let's master LinkedIn before we spread ourselves crazy thin,

Unknown Speaker  28:04
I think somewhere in the Google Drive. And I would just let you find it. There should be a content ideas folder,

Unknown Speaker  28:15
or I Yeah, there is. I don't know if I can.

Unknown Speaker  28:20
I think it's this one, actually.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
Yeah, here it is. I mean, I have got more I think I do. I don't know, if I do for sure. I think I've got more ideas. And I could you could shake a stick at. So any of these things that you want to reach develop more fully, we could do that

Unknown Speaker  28:40
a great model, I think would be say, like, let's say we do one video a week. So let's say we have, you know, video day, we have a full day we have a you know, client story day, or Yeah, I don't know what I don't know what that should look like, I'm kind of relying on you for ideas. And I would love to have things that you could more easily provide that I can,

Unknown Speaker  29:01
but I'm fine, like doing a video a week. And then you can you can take the content from the video and use that as the foundation for an article that you write.

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Or maybe we take one of the existing articles and you're just like, Well, go doing go do a video based off of this.

Unknown Speaker  29:31
And I think

Unknown Speaker  29:35
is that enough to get you started on it? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:37
I think so.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
So would it be worth

Unknown Speaker  29:43
my time to just sit down and accomplish

Unknown Speaker  29:50
so work on putting together a linked in publishing schedule for the next three months

Unknown Speaker  29:56
and

Unknown Speaker  29:57
sort of playing in their articles, we're working on ensuring that content content is great.

Unknown Speaker  30:08
Yeah, something something like that, then I think I think the grid that I showed you could be really, really useful framework for,

Unknown Speaker  30:17
for making sure that all that stuff is

Unknown Speaker  30:21
it's good to go. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:23
yeah. So the grid hockey video is going to help me

Unknown Speaker  30:28
understand better, right, that's right. I'll have some some more ideas about how to how to use that.

Unknown Speaker  30:34
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  30:36
well, I'll watch the video grid. Look at all these Dr. Documents and folders.

Unknown Speaker  30:45
I'm often

Unknown Speaker  30:47
schedule and work on content

Unknown Speaker  30:52
questions.

Unknown Speaker  30:55
Sounds good. Um, something that something that I just recently saw. Maybe you know about this. But MailChimp is running a postcards beta,

Unknown Speaker  31:07
and is where you can create mass art like mailing postcards, and they will mail it for you print it and mail it for you. And everything for I don't know, I think was like eating like 75 cents or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  31:24
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:25
so I was just I just thinking about the idea of what if we would,

Unknown Speaker  31:32
I don't know what's your newsletter mailing list looks like would send out like, if we read through that. Maybe get rid of any more you don't want on there anymore. And then send out postcards teach anything. Hey, we have a book that we'd love to send your way if you'd be interested. If so, we send us an email back and we'll mail you or send us a text at or email send us yeah and then then we're

Unknown Speaker  32:06
connecting with people on your mailing list that are your most avid followers. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:12
I actually got a drop off recall. I'm I'm in favor of that, I think put together a a proposal I'm I'm

Unknown Speaker  32:22
I mean, we may actually be able to send it out not through mail. chimp it through, like our existing print

Unknown Speaker  32:29
company.

Unknown Speaker  32:31
We're comfortable, comfortable price. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  32:36
but very, very open to that.

Unknown Speaker  32:37
Okay, sounds good. I'll send an email your way we'll look for that as well. Okay. Sounds good. Good talking to you.

Unknown Speaker  32:45
Likewise. Thanks again.
