Unknown Speaker  00:00
And no you do not have an agenda form that you

Unknown Speaker  00:05
didn't ask you that

Unknown Speaker  00:08
all right what's going on? Alright so

Unknown Speaker  00:13
this is just a brief precursor was listening to a podcast this morning talking about resistance as a good reminder that when you're doing anything that matters you'll face resistance and when you face resistance it's probably a good sign that you're moving in the right direction you're doing something meaningful so that was definitely Tommy for me this morning

Unknown Speaker  00:33
I've been at sea so so I did the first the event though it was looking to do and Lincoln

Unknown Speaker  00:43
learned a lot but it was a no show

Unknown Speaker  00:48
so I actually call it off the day before is kicking back down

Unknown Speaker  00:53
the

Unknown Speaker  00:56
was and then have since then gotten so started

Unknown Speaker  01:02
getting more speaking events I have always been at 1 Million Cups tomorrow in Colorado Springs is probably about 50 people there

Unknown Speaker  01:10
it to local events past week one was a short five minute presentation the other was a like 20 the 20 to 30 minute training presentation

Unknown Speaker  01:21
has some fantastic you're a that one a movie turning into a video

Unknown Speaker  01:28
and have been

Unknown Speaker  01:34
Yeah, that's kind of that's kind of been the wins

Unknown Speaker  01:38
I still feel like

Unknown Speaker  01:43
Well, I know

Unknown Speaker  01:45
that oh, let's see

Unknown Speaker  01:48
what's worse. The biggest the biggest bottleneck right now I think one of them is continuing to schedule speaking engagements

Unknown Speaker  02:00
meetup groups I have I have my assistant helping try find those and

Unknown Speaker  02:06
hoping to set those up as well. I think part of that is

Unknown Speaker  02:12
not sure I'm open to input here. I think part of my problem is I want to see it move more quickly. But then it is that

Unknown Speaker  02:23
some of that you just

Unknown Speaker  02:28
have to be content kind of trusting the process that we're going to that we're gonna get there.

Unknown Speaker  02:37
So that's kind of focus number one. The other focus

Unknown Speaker  02:41
is

Unknown Speaker  02:46
I've got another team member who's going to be reaching out to some other context that we have,

Unknown Speaker  02:55
and having conversations with them, finding out that this networking with them, and finding out with doing and see if there's any of those that

Unknown Speaker  03:04
she should be putting in touch with me

Unknown Speaker  03:09
also have just got off the phone with that same team member to put together a more consistent plan for posting content to LinkedIn.

Unknown Speaker  03:21
And we've got this whole backlog of emails and such that we've written in the past

Unknown Speaker  03:29
that that he can leverage for that.

Unknown Speaker  03:33
So are you using, like, are using Leonard and you're sending out emails through LinkedIn, or what what a man i'm just i'm assuming you are going in and, you know, ask me for connections, can you give me an idea of what you're doing,

Unknown Speaker  03:50
or you just put this on and give me an idea, but this point have just been, you know, making connections, and we share the best move forward. I'm not a huge fan of direct mailing LinkedIn,

Unknown Speaker  04:06
of scraping LinkedIn emails, because that ends up affecting their ability and

Unknown Speaker  04:16
gain for the sandbox.

Unknown Speaker  04:20
So my plan is, first of all, to what will what what plan First of all, is to post content and to engage with individuals there that way, what I would like to do is to find a way to engage meaningfully through LinkedIn messages.

Unknown Speaker  04:43
And I mean, there's there's two fundamentally different approaches to LinkedIn. The first is kind of the

Unknown Speaker  04:56
does the approach you turn in September's game, you try to get as many connections, you try to escape their emails, you blast emails to that we try to

Unknown Speaker  05:05
just based off of that, you get a couple responses.

Unknown Speaker  05:10
And the other approach is really approaching it from the standpoint of relationships and finding, finding, well, just developing and cultivating relationships, relationships with this real people. And

Unknown Speaker  05:25
that's the

Unknown Speaker  05:29
that's definitely the the first and more comfortable with but I'm kind of hitting a

Unknown Speaker  05:35
kind of stalling out on tactically, what's the best way to do that. And is that something that I should do? Is this something that I hand off to it?

Unknown Speaker  05:50
So are you looking at using

Unknown Speaker  05:53
like an ad Sales Navigator or Leonard or something to find your target and then doing Yeah, emails through LinkedIn, not emails, but messages currently engine that's just Yeah, that's right. And already have Sales Navigator and already have quite a few process. I mean, quite a quite a few people that are somewhere in the ballpark of being, you know,

Unknown Speaker  06:16
of potentially being candidates,

Unknown Speaker  06:21
but I've just kind of hit this mental block of, Okay, now, I have this connection. What's, what's the non obtrusive or the the semi doesn't start with, you know,

Unknown Speaker  06:34
I felt awesome ideas I had one was one was saying, you know, hey, john, I, I keep my eyes, I try to keep my eye open for articles that are interesting to my LinkedIn connections,

Unknown Speaker  06:47
curious if there's, you know, if

Unknown Speaker  06:51
I come across good stuff in terms of that, and, you know, listening to potential topics, if, if there's any of this stuff that she is there anything specifically you find helpful or something like that, there's that option. Another option is saying, you know, hey, look,

Unknown Speaker  07:06
I'm looking to get to know other

Unknown Speaker  07:11
business owners, entrepreneurs in the area, and would love to take a few minutes to here

Unknown Speaker  07:19
just to connect with you and find out more about what you're doing. And

Unknown Speaker  07:25
I don't know, whatever that is,

Unknown Speaker  07:28
teams like getting a call, the first message to get on the call is a bit of a big a big ask. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:38
so I'm not completely comfortable with that.

Unknown Speaker  07:41
So my recommendation would be

Unknown Speaker  07:46
to email people with with whatever is the top of your funnel, good content that might be like you, you get to know what your target market

Unknown Speaker  07:57
is interested in.

Unknown Speaker  08:00
So my folks, because I'm

Unknown Speaker  08:04
actually working with the kind of my approach is, you know,

Unknown Speaker  08:08
send them some good content

Unknown Speaker  08:12
post.

Unknown Speaker  08:13
And then a series of email have nailed through, I don't know what you call it messages, LinkedIn messages, I guess I'll call them

Unknown Speaker  08:24
leading to a phone ask, but only after I've given my five emails of five messages worth of good content.

Unknown Speaker  08:36
Now, you talk about a webinar

Unknown Speaker  08:40
on I'm toying with that idea to maybe a call to a webinar as opposed to a phone conversation.

Unknown Speaker  08:49
Sure you try it. I mean, we're all just trying to works because what works for you may not work for me, and vice versa.

Unknown Speaker  08:57
Yeah, I actually did record my people education, is it on Friday, I did record so

Unknown Speaker  09:03
I wasn't sure exactly how it might fit into the funnel. But it's at least an option that, you know, I don't have to use I think it's, it's 20 to 30 minutes. So it's Yes, hopefully,

Unknown Speaker  09:15
yeah, hopefully, an option at least start

Unknown Speaker  09:18
so

Unknown Speaker  09:20
to find find four or five articles that kind of along those along those lines,

Unknown Speaker  09:30
and

Unknown Speaker  09:34
that they would find valuable or helpful.

Unknown Speaker  09:48
And then the ideal is affected track opens on those.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
And

Unknown Speaker  09:56
for those who will be using as your CRM,

Unknown Speaker  10:00
I'm using a drip as my CRM.

Unknown Speaker  10:05
So does that allow you to see what open rates and things like that?

Unknown Speaker  10:10
Yes, it is.

Unknown Speaker  10:14
And I'm kind of, well,

Unknown Speaker  10:17
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:22
the the hesitation is, is still remains around scraping LinkedIn emails, and putting them into a email list. I you know what,

Unknown Speaker  10:33
I I scraped mine I have like 7000 and I said, I just I can't I got to personally have not been able to bring myself to do it, you know,

Unknown Speaker  10:47
and I created a whole separate account in a different because I primarily use MailChimp until I wasn't going to mess that up. So I got there's another one, but I just I it Everyone is telling me that that's not the most effective way to

Unknown Speaker  11:10
lose your connection. So I haven't done it. I just keep thinking about it. But I haven't done it. And I think they're using something like Leonard or something I'm getting her can send out email messages in LinkedIn is a much

Unknown Speaker  11:29
better a better way. Yeah, yeah, I think it was actually

Unknown Speaker  11:35
kind of before whether I want to take the time to do this, I think is actually somewhat trivial. I mean, given my background to put together a

Unknown Speaker  11:44
kind of a link tracker that that allows me to generate these links and, and send them out to people and then find out when they opened up

Unknown Speaker  11:52
that and I guess what I really like about that is that, you know, some people aren't on LinkedIn for probably me. So some people literally don't log in once a month. And

Unknown Speaker  12:06
that way, if they

Unknown Speaker  12:08
if they don't log in for a month, they won't log into having like, getting class it was five different messages all at the same time,

Unknown Speaker  12:15
right.

Unknown Speaker  12:18
So I do my program it so that if you only send them the next message, once they open the person honor that one previous one.

Unknown Speaker  12:28
Yeah, basically, basically be able to generate personalized links to be able to see, you know, when once those links are open, so you can see open it on open length, and

Unknown Speaker  12:38
there wouldn't be automatic, but it would be it would be good enough that that my system could

Unknown Speaker  12:44
take it and run with it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  12:49
and that'll that'll pull out the hyper responsive ones. And if those are targeted to what I really like is that if those are targeted towards topics that they would find helpful or interesting, then it's going to

Unknown Speaker  13:04
they're going to sell select. So it's a way of disqualifying people as well. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:15
Good.

Unknown Speaker  13:18
So how big is your list outside of LinkedIn?

Unknown Speaker  13:24
So it's less than 100? I think we're, even

Unknown Speaker  13:32
though it's part of what you want to do via LinkedIn is get people to

Unknown Speaker  13:39
opt in or is or using other social media for that.

Unknown Speaker  13:49
Yeah, I just want to lift I guess

Unknown Speaker  13:53
I'm great question.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
I think

Unknown Speaker  14:00
mean. Yes, that should be the goal. And I wonder if I can like this article's our

Unknown Speaker  14:09
blog post or something like that, and having an opt in, you know, at the bottom

Unknown Speaker  14:16
to allow them to opt in for more of these.

Unknown Speaker  14:23
Or if you do that on the content that you publish on LinkedIn. I'm not quite sure that's another kind of barrier bottleneck that I feel like I'm kind of wrestling with right now.

Unknown Speaker  14:35
Yeah, well, so what are your other than articles you have? Like, what's your free, irresistible offer? Or whether I have a couple of them with what what do you kind of using tonight, oh, I'm good. I'm using a booklet

Unknown Speaker  14:52
the risk free delegation booklet. And what I've been doing at this point is what I've been wanting to do is actually offer it in print form, so that we mail them a copy. I don't know if that's too big of a barrier to entry for them.

Unknown Speaker  15:06
But the

Unknown Speaker  15:08
I think, I mean, I think it's, it's worth the investment and my end because of the, the increased likelihood that they'll actually sit down and read it,

Unknown Speaker  15:17
now

Unknown Speaker  15:36
you're listening to such a key component.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
And then ultimately, that's kind of what we're all trying to get, or at least I'm trying to get from my LinkedIn connection is getting them, you know, opting into my couple of free and

Unknown Speaker  15:52
then now they're on my list that I can really email us.

Unknown Speaker  16:00
So I would add that you kind of you're mixing what am I trying to accomplish?

Unknown Speaker  16:07
But I think I mean, I think it's good though, that this is I mean, you know,

Unknown Speaker  16:14
one of the challenges in putting together a marketing plan as you kind of have your your short wins and your long wins and you need a blend of both

Unknown Speaker  16:26
and getting them on my list is definitely a long when kind of thing

Unknown Speaker  16:39
does it have to be

Unknown Speaker  16:42
long

Unknown Speaker  16:45
maybe not

Unknown Speaker  16:48
maybe not

Unknown Speaker  16:50
just something to think about

Unknown Speaker  16:55
so what do you think of this idea so I different domain risk free delegation that calm What do you think of the idea of on that on that page, having basically three different buttons. One is get a print, copy free, you know, get, you know, of course, headline, and all that kind of stuff,

Unknown Speaker  17:11
download a copy behind a, an opt in, and then

Unknown Speaker  17:17
watch the or get the video also behind an opt in and

Unknown Speaker  17:26
just letting people choose the mode and then just including that link in the content, you know,

Unknown Speaker  17:32
posting quotes regarding risk free delegation and writing content towards that kind of thing

Unknown Speaker  17:41
to direct people to the website is that

Unknown Speaker  17:45
that's a great idea.

Unknown Speaker  17:47
Okay. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
All right. So the contents got to be what's in Why do they care? Why do I need restraint, negation? Bye, why do I need this booklet? What am I going to learn

Unknown Speaker  17:59
but also now

Unknown Speaker  18:03
something that they can get in to an often

Unknown Speaker  18:08
kind of dissect them in it. That's it That's it does is it doesn't have to be a long when it could be a short one.

Unknown Speaker  18:17
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:21
it's true

Unknown Speaker  18:25
ability to really build your list and really, you know, people are going to open the email that they get more readily and they're going to open the LinkedIn message that they get

Unknown Speaker  18:40
sure

Unknown Speaker  18:42
so getting them to the point where they're actually opting in they said hey I'm interested in what you've got

Unknown Speaker  18:49
that much closer to phone conversation as I'm hiring you

Unknown Speaker  18:54
and kind of a goal is to get them to there that's fine

Unknown Speaker  19:02
yeah

Unknown Speaker  19:04
oh look you're having some ideas here I'd like

Unknown Speaker  19:23
okay so if I sit all the way back and say

Unknown Speaker  19:27
it's trying to trend it realized this in a way that I can get it straight in my head so the the end goal is

Unknown Speaker  19:38
maybe the easier to say what's what's the whole picture apart from what we what we put together first what's the big picture of what we want

Unknown Speaker  19:47
and clearly the end goal is then them off to and and getting our emails and some of that we can start by having

Unknown Speaker  19:56
an autoresponder sequence on the other side of you know five you know five emails or so that gets dropped out over the next you know however long

Unknown Speaker  20:11
and then and the means to that looking backwards and there's through kind of the three different options that they have for getting this guide the way that we get people to that guide is through LinkedIn conscience that

Unknown Speaker  20:28
through quotes etc that reference you know first few delegation that calm and at least do that through

Unknown Speaker  20:37
video videos through

Unknown Speaker  20:41
through articles and then and that's how we use the public content and on the direct that with the message LinkedIn messaging that can happen through the

Unknown Speaker  20:54
series of articles or or videos that are targeted towards topics interests

Unknown Speaker  21:02
and each one can have a little bored with a button that basically says hate to learn more about this kind of thing go to you can get a copy for free guy that risk free delegation calm

Unknown Speaker  21:14
and

Unknown Speaker  21:19
then and then eventually what we really need is we need the ability to really want to build out continues nurturing that email list and whatever system in place that we need to keep sending these these folks emails and an ongoing basis

Unknown Speaker  21:45
about right

Unknown Speaker  22:02
are you still there?
