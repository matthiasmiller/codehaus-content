Hey what's up Matthias let me just share my screen and we'll walk through the

Unknown Speaker  00:50
sounds good you you're screaming okay so

Unknown Speaker  01:09
we'd like to take

Unknown Speaker  01:17
list

Speaker 1  01:25
I don't know where I should start Should I start with lists or

Speaker 2  01:30
wherever we were creating a segment I think

Speaker 1  01:35
Okay then I'll go to a new I believe it's an advanced search have to toggle back

Speaker 2  01:52
this is difficulty is there a way to go back to an existing segment is there a way to further

Speaker 1  02:04
narrow down like to try that I don't know how to reclaim the segment that's been saved

Unknown Speaker  02:21
and see if I can find it

Speaker 1  02:44
there's a section out here called list exclusions that I cannot view but it might be in that

Speaker 2  02:50
under context years list if you go to truepoint NC welcome in little arrow on the right we can go into this segments for that

Unknown Speaker  03:18
we are here

Speaker 2  03:30
so you might just have to create a new one. And you don't want to modify you don't want to modify the main one you want to

Speaker 1  03:43
model this one and create another Okay, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
Yes

Speaker 1  03:57
correct because we wouldn't wait salesperson is not blank. We would just want to specify the salesperson

Speaker 2  04:02
is Marisa Where is Victoria?

Speaker 1  04:07
Right. Okay, yes, take a screenshot. So okay. So if that is the case, I think I know how to proceed. I just give one round of a shot here. Sure.

Speaker 1  05:15
that's why it's goofy so these were

Speaker 2  05:21
number 16 You actually want to date subscribe dishonor after and then we're just using the first names for the salesperson name this is a opportunity Stein's does not wind does not last cool. So we saved this I think I had just

Unknown Speaker  06:24
it showed up down here and I'm flattened

Unknown Speaker  06:27
search first and then save maybe yeah

Speaker 1  06:32
