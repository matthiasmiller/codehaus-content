Unknown Speaker  00:02
I got your text, and

Speaker 1  00:04
I'm actually on the road. So I thought I better do this. So I don't crash your, you know, do something illegal, but I'm

Speaker 1  00:12
sorry. Just a ton of thoughts going through my mind with what you're saying first thought was,

Speaker 1  00:18
wouldn't it be interesting to have a foundation and add a Baptist worker foundation where businesses could contribute? And you know,

Speaker 1  00:27
we already have a list of, you know, how many, how many nonprofits here where you

Speaker 1  00:31
could help compensate people? And actually, let me back up a little bit. My first question is, why is it hard to get workers and I suspect one of the challenges is that there's different people

Speaker 1  00:41
at different phases of life who are qualified. But these sort of things I've heard

Speaker 1  00:46
finances could definitely be an issue. Another issue could just be it's hard to transition out or just because of family. And that's probably

Unknown Speaker  00:56
one of the hardest

Speaker 1  00:56
things to actually work around is, you know, in terms of family commitments, and those those kinds of things are transitioning out of businesses but or work or whatever the situation is,

Unknown Speaker  01:09
but what if you had a foundation

Speaker 1  01:11
that would that would help people come alongside and allow people to to go into your service at these different nonprofits while removing a lot of the burden from the nonprofit's that was idea number one that idea number two is, well, what if

Speaker 1  01:26
we enhance it a bit, and you create a centralized database where you attract workers

Speaker 1  01:32
and, you know, you can keep personnel issues on file you got understand their, their strengths and gifting and those kinds of things. So that was that was number two. And number three was, well, what if you had

Unknown Speaker  01:45
a actually one more thing on that

Unknown Speaker  01:47
side,

Speaker 1  01:49
what if you had a if the salvation with basically allow you

Speaker 1  01:53
to have career volunteers, if you want to call them that were was a work in a nonprofit and develop skills

Speaker 1  02:01
and then transfer those skills to another nonprofit and are able to do that supported by the foundation. And so with the foundation would actually end up doing is because it's providing this kind of support, you would

Unknown Speaker  02:12
create career, you know, nonprofit individuals, which

Unknown Speaker  02:15
can be good or bad. But the

Unknown Speaker  02:17
upside

Speaker 1  02:18
is that you can have a shared knowledge base that transfers within these different organizations. So you could have people who are moving from

Speaker 1  02:26
one organization, they take their skill sets with them. And

Unknown Speaker  02:31
instead of it's another organization by five next

Unknown Speaker  02:33
after that was, well, what if we had

Speaker 1  02:36
a recruitment management organization for volunteers. And so think of it as

Speaker 1  02:43
a basically an employee staffing company,

Speaker 1  02:46
except this a volunteer staffing company, and possibly, so it could be funded one of two ways, one

Speaker 1  02:53
by one, by a foundation and, or from the nonprofit themselves, where you develop a

Speaker 1  03:01
think, for example, in Colorado Springs, where you have a

Speaker 1  03:08
you have you dealt with a pool of all volunteers

Speaker 1  03:11
and you and then you

Unknown Speaker  03:17
determine

Speaker 1  03:19
strengths assessment assessments, you do personality profiles, Colby profiles, those kinds of things. And then you plug them into causes that they care about, and what's the best fit for them based on their background, their skill set, and all these kinds of things. And you charge

Unknown Speaker  03:31
a certain amount of

Unknown Speaker  03:34
certain kind of admin fee that goes to the staffing organization

Unknown Speaker  03:37
to

Unknown Speaker  03:38
to manage these things. And

Speaker 1  03:42
it was possible that you could have private, you know, individuals who are willing to

Speaker 1  03:46
pay that fee of being involved in these kinds of organization, it was a couple of things.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
First of all, it takes the HR expertise

Speaker 1  03:53
out of the nonprofit sector into this entities that can get really transparent

Unknown Speaker  03:59
insight

Speaker 1  04:01
that's, that's, that's the number one thing number two is

Speaker 1  04:04
that it actually increases as a creates a

Unknown Speaker  04:08
network effect where this organization

Speaker 1  04:11
becomes embedded into all these other organizations. And,

Speaker 1  04:17
and with it comes in increased knowledge, it becomes reduced overhead, it's, it becomes a much more effective way of managing these people.

Speaker 1  04:28
And what else is with this,

Speaker 1  04:33
the other thing that lets you do is it allows nonprofits, so so let's say you have a

Unknown Speaker  04:38
high level marketer

Speaker 1  04:41
who's really skilled, but it allows nonprofits, to essentially

Speaker 1  04:44
by timeshares, where you have one overseeing organization and you can schedule

Speaker 1  04:50
these individuals a one day a week with the different nonprofits where they can you know split their time across multiple nonprofits and and you basically create a freelance economy among the nonprofit's with this with this flexible work schedule.

Speaker 1  05:09
So that's, that's the idea that's like the latest iteration of the idea that I'm kicking around.

Speaker 1  05:16
It seems like it could be tremendously powerful, so not sure where to go with that but just wanted to at least put this in an otter and then we can chat some time.
