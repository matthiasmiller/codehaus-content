Unknown Speaker  00:25
Still are here for

Unknown Speaker  01:53
Hello,

Unknown Speaker  01:55
good.

Unknown Speaker  01:57
Are you at home? Or where are you? I'm in wendell's office today.

Unknown Speaker  02:02
Oh, Wendell. Wendell net golden rule. Wendell and Michelle, nice, yeah, okay, I don't think I really know them, but golden rule makes a bit of connection.

Unknown Speaker  02:16
Yep, I'm contemplating getting, okay, getting moving my office over here in a different room, but he's got an extra office, and I'm like,

Unknown Speaker  02:24
I could save nice, several $100 a month and be around somebody I know, yeah, yeah, exactly. That'd be nice. It would be anyway, um, what do you think about prorating? Is that reasonable or is that crazy? I

Unknown Speaker  02:38
think it's perfectly saying. I don't care I was, I wasn't sure whether we should prorate or just say it's the last part. So I could also see someone saying that. But pro rating seems, I think, is probably more saying, and it's easy enough to do. Yeah, I think it's the most defensible. It's honestly probably easier to do anyway, sure you just do, what percent of my total payment? Well, what percent of my subtotal?

Unknown Speaker  03:04
You get your rent subtotal, right? One rent is always going to be base is by switching to an EPO item type, rent is always split,

Unknown Speaker  03:16
like, like,

Unknown Speaker  03:18
but anyway, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:20
yeah. I mean, I think it's that's super

Unknown Speaker  03:23
saiyan,

Unknown Speaker  03:25
so that's easy enough. Did you the CFP question? Do you know how whiskey attachment URL works?

Unknown Speaker  03:36
Green? I mean, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:39
my concern is that we changed. I don't know if we're breaking things or not. Basically,

Unknown Speaker  03:47
what was it in? It was

Unknown Speaker  03:51
Nick's job. Actually,

Unknown Speaker  03:59
it's probably Mike to do

Unknown Speaker  04:03
now it was in deposits.

Unknown Speaker  04:08
Renaming deposits, I think

Unknown Speaker  04:14
it was one of the deposit whiskey things

Unknown Speaker  04:19
that I was afraid we're going to break.

Unknown Speaker  04:27
Well, I guess I should just look here, deposit, add,

Unknown Speaker  04:35
delete,

Unknown Speaker  04:37
we go.

Unknown Speaker  04:39
So this, here, this part

Unknown Speaker  04:42
changed accounting deposit instead of assist deposit.

Unknown Speaker  04:46
And I don't know how this URL works.

Unknown Speaker  04:51
Is it actually using level, or is it as just a string that we expect to stay the same? I.

Unknown Speaker  05:06
It's an actual level, I think I'm pretty sure,

Unknown Speaker  05:09
and I think

Unknown Speaker  05:12
so then changing it to

Unknown Speaker  05:16
accounting deposit is right,

Unknown Speaker  05:20
or what the storage

Unknown Speaker  05:23
here, let me check something

Unknown Speaker  05:26
inside my theory, then, is that we should use validated listing on the I

Unknown Speaker  05:33
would suspect your theory. But

Unknown Speaker  05:37
let's go into here.

Unknown Speaker  05:42
That.

Unknown Speaker  05:47
Wow,

Unknown Speaker  05:50
problem, name for URL.

Unknown Speaker  05:56
Hang on. I

Unknown Speaker  06:02
here's the past.

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Shove it into the past.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
I genuinely have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  06:41
So we have a shot at breaking it either way.

Unknown Speaker  06:49
Attachment

Unknown Speaker  06:52
level for info,

Unknown Speaker  06:56
browse all standard

Unknown Speaker  06:59
service.

Unknown Speaker  07:04
Yes, that's

Unknown Speaker  07:16
true. Accounting deposit ID,

Unknown Speaker  07:38
You have a

Unknown Speaker  08:29
see which To

Unknown Speaker  09:20
thanks very much. I'll go ahead to.

Unknown Speaker  10:12
I'm going to work on a macro while you

Unknown Speaker  10:15
choose this. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:17
the Midas will be productive.

Unknown Speaker  10:55
Rule,

Unknown Speaker  11:01
okay, the bottom line is that.

Unknown Speaker  11:16
Bottom line is that there is no x 30 that modifies this therefore he's using update records, therefore it has, has to be a valid, validated list string, okay,

Unknown Speaker  11:29
of database level. So what Nick is? Nick's switching. It was good. We should probably add validated listing, but, yes, but we should use validate listing in.

Unknown Speaker  11:39
I mean, I don't care what Josh does with his levels, but I would for with ours. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:46
it would be in the it's anything that calls the the

Unknown Speaker  11:51
URL function of these three,

Unknown Speaker  11:54
yes, and also in, also an attachment info, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:13
Way,

Unknown Speaker  12:16
oh, we don't even do it here.

Unknown Speaker  12:18
Gracious,

Unknown Speaker  12:21
yeah, would at least do it there,

Unknown Speaker  12:26
yep, okay, well, I will

Unknown Speaker  12:32
add my note.

Unknown Speaker  12:38
The above macros are same. Are fine. We should start using validated

Unknown Speaker  12:58
parameters.

Unknown Speaker  13:02
Sign

Unknown Speaker  13:05
sign parameters,

Unknown Speaker  13:11
okay,

Unknown Speaker  13:12
assign parameters

Unknown Speaker  13:16
where levels are passed

Unknown Speaker  13:20
and

Unknown Speaker  13:52
Perfect,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
good. I

Unknown Speaker  13:57
just wanted to make sure we didn't double, we didn't break attachments again, right? Okay, there

Unknown Speaker  14:05
was that one and then no accounting. I'm trying to figure out what that should look like,

Unknown Speaker  14:14
right?

Unknown Speaker  14:17
So, I think, I think, I think we need bills. I don't think there's a way to

Unknown Speaker  14:22
bills. Bill. Bill seems completely sane. What breaks if we remove checks, is it just refunds?

Unknown Speaker  14:31
Yeah, it's saying whether my refund is done or whether my Well, it's gonna say whether my bill is paid, but we have manual payments for that. I up,

Unknown Speaker  14:45
I mean, and

Unknown Speaker  14:49
it just makes them so much simpler, because otherwise, like, they are really checks are really built to have accounting because, like, there's financial accounts throughout, and we're linked to accounting company.
