Unknown Speaker  00:09
Okay, sounds good. Yep, you

Unknown Speaker  00:25
There we go. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  00:30
Alrighty, I can't hear you, Matt.

Matthias Miller  00:37
It's you. It's working.

Speaker 1  00:41
Hang on here. Let me do this. Try that, that.

Unknown Speaker  00:44
How's that? Hang

Matthias Miller  00:45
on, Matt, here we go. Keep trying.

Unknown Speaker  00:49
I have plugged in the wrong Ford, thank you. Okay,

Matthias Miller  00:52
yeah, you bet for sure. All right, I have one. I think so we, we, I should have sent an email, but I didn't. We pushed an update last night.

Speaker 1  01:05
Well, I knew you are, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  01:10
And so bunch more. There should be a bunch more item clean up for George and so I was hoping that this morning I would have time to sit down and go through where we're at, the pricing module, but on the pricing, like the pricing report, I'm not much further. I did not have a chance to do that, because there's just a whole host of, like, a lot of the stuff from this past week has been around, clarifications around how pricing actually works, some some changes to what we or Yeah, clarifications around, around the specifics of that. And so if you are there's, there's one issue that I want to take a look at in with the sawing, tracking,

Matthias Miller  02:08
but, but, and so we can take a look at that. I don't, I feel like, I feel like I don't feel like there's a lot I feel like we're fairly clear on on from what I what I can tell. We're fairly clear on how pricing should happen, but I'd be a lot more comfortable if I have a chance to walk, personally, walk through the pricing report and make sure that we're handling pricing correctly on on each of the item types, all of that stuff, make sure we've got warnings. Double check that we've got warnings for everything. Anytime pricing information is missing. And and at that point, it's, it's, we could start taking a look at at pricing individual items, but there's also going to be a lot for George to do to just clean up item data to get to where we need

Speaker 1  02:59
to be. So you said, you said the clarification work this week. Are you talking about clarify, like system design clarification, or are you talking about just curious?

Matthias Miller  03:18
So I mean, part of it was, part of it was, was splitting out dimensional lumber kerf from can't curve, so we have different pricing percentages for that. Part of it was the changes that we talked about for plywood pricing so that we can do each, you know, per item, pricing on raw materials, on the the random, the random we had talked about in various forms, I think It wasn't that I keep, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 1  04:02
But no, that's here. Let me. Let me get to the, sorry, where's the oh, here I'm gonna go. I know what I want to do,

Unknown Speaker  04:14
refresh this guy on your plywood.

Speaker 1  04:18
Matt, I don't remember. We said that a detail that I don't remember. We did say that we're going to take look at each item and assess, make a judgment on how many pieces of plywood were going into that item. And then did we say one or two decimal points.

Matthias Miller  04:41
Do you remember that I was thinking we said two? Did we fine?

Speaker 1  04:47
And that's fine. So then I could say, well, I could say a quarter piece or a three quarter piece or whatever. Yeah, that's good. Now, did you put that in? Do I need to find the plywood that'll to show that window?

Matthias Miller  05:00
Or Well, first I would have made this change, but I wasn't sure how pricing set up. First, we need to change plywood to be each price by individual quantity, instead of by linear feet. Okay. And then we and then we need to find a plywood job to take a look at that.

Speaker 1  05:18
Should I find the job right now? Yeah, yeah. What this list even is, but all this is the cleanup list. All those ATTs was our in house, our guy in hell, Allen here, going through adding dimensions, not finding prints. It was a Yeah, I think we're, think we're getting through that. I think hopefully him and Tina are on the same page with our print system, the ones that have been sorted and the ones that anyways, keeping the ones in the main drawer that we still, that we've done the last couple years, and everything else goes into the drawer. But that's why that ATT showed up there. Matt, um, I have to go to,

Unknown Speaker  06:08
what's this here?

Unknown Speaker  06:11
Well, I'm gonna screw this items. I'll go to wave 18. I'm

Speaker 2  06:29
so if I click on, well, where were

Speaker 1  06:36
we, what are your What are your questions on the plywood pricing,

Matthias Miller  06:40
let me, let me see if I can take the

Speaker 1  06:49
I guess, like when you if a plot, if an item, if a line item is plywood, should it show up down here in The line item data? Or should the plywood thing be the above the item window, like somewhere there with the wing and the base dimensions and all that, I guess.

Matthias Miller  07:18
I would prefer to, I mean, I don't care whether they're moved up there. I would prefer to keep them with the fasteners, because it's Oh, okay, so it's all raw material in some fashion. One question, all of the plywood is four by eight sheets. Is that right? Yes.

Speaker 1  07:34
Okay. And so you're saying you would let the plywood show up in raw materials, and down here is where we would, we would,

Matthias Miller  07:43
yeah, let me, give me, give me one second, and I'll show you. Let me configure these, and then you can see that makes sense. Let me, and I'll show you. Okay. Now try hitting the hit the Save button. Okay. Now it says,

Unknown Speaker  08:03
well, we should have

Matthias Miller  08:08
language showing up on this. This is, let me see, yes, let me check something. Why is that not? I

Matthias Miller  08:24
this is the wavy chain.

Matthias Miller  08:36
Oh, maybe it's not. No. No,

Matthias Miller  08:54
no, this shows in the Okay, let me

Matthias Miller  09:01
check one more thing.

Matthias Miller  09:10
Okay, this only shows up in the cleanup report, but basically what you need to do is you need to so cancel out of this. Just go down to raw materials and add the 716, os OSB.

Unknown Speaker  09:30
Add it here. Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  09:42
Should I hang on? It's not,

Unknown Speaker  09:48
ah, a burger, okay, well,

Matthias Miller  09:54
make that Monday.

Speaker 1  09:55
Okay, so I would, I would choose that, and then.

Matthias Miller  10:00
Here, and then you would enter in how many sheets,

Speaker 1  10:07
yeah, let's go x on that, yes. Okay, so yeah, then right here at the entered amount,

Unknown Speaker  10:15
yeah, 412

Speaker 1  10:18
hand nails on this thing. I yeah, I guess a big crate. Okay, that seems crazy. 211 staple, yeah. Okay, so then I went there. So, yeah, choose the raw material type and enter them out here. So, so raw material category will include plywood, but I'm assuming no other lumber,

Matthias Miller  10:43
no other lumber just play with,

Speaker 1  10:45
yep, gotcha. So then I want to, I'm going to say, Yeah, whatever point, one point whatever, or whatever I want to put in there. That makes, that makes the most sense. I mean, less than 10% for sure, include plywood here, maybe, maybe even more, like five, I'm not sure. So it's, yeah, 100 that's a good way for us to do it. Once you have that, we'll be ready to I'll probably throw Alan at that one.

Matthias Miller  11:17
Yeah, that's, yep. Sounds good

Speaker 1  11:22
on the random, you mentioned random, Matt and you were mentioned, you mentioned about, well, I'm curious what you were, uh, can you read? You said the can't, okay, versus you said something about can't curve, and then you mentioned the raw material, or the raw material size. Isn't that what I heard you say,

Matthias Miller  11:52
yeah, go into Configure. Okay, configure. Can't sizes. Mm.

Matthias Miller  12:11
Yeah, and go into one of these. Pick one. So we've got, we've got, we now have the pricing, the curve percentages for pricing, which is not pulling into the pricing module yet.

Speaker 1  12:27
But sorry, you, I'm you are gone. Sorry, I didn't with your words. What do you

Matthias Miller  12:33
Okay, so on a two and a half by two and a half yield, it can come out of a I mean, this only has can't. This only comes out of cans, but you have a section for rough cut lumber and a section for dimensional lumber and and you have different pricing curves, percentages for pricing cans versus the two bites.

Speaker 1  12:55
Okay, in dimensional lumber, you're thinking about two by fours.

Matthias Miller  13:01
I am thinking about two by fours. Okay?

Speaker 1  13:06
And so the the things like the different sizes that we talked about are going to be, you're going to be segregated by

Unknown Speaker  13:20
these two categories, yes,

Unknown Speaker  13:23
plus the raw material category, all right? I think everything's clear there is that, right? You're clear

Matthias Miller  13:32
with I mean, yeah, I'm clear with that.

Speaker 1  13:35
If, if I do need to throw something at you here that came up, well, what are you doing with the special sizes? Because we what I wrote down special order lumber, what it what if I can't remember what devil

Matthias Miller  13:54
we need to Well, there's two ways we could do this. What would be most logical to me is that you create a raw material for each type of special order lumber, and then you just, you just set it up to be priced per piece, and then we treat it like plywood. Well, I guess, no, it depends. You can price it however

Speaker 1  14:32
you want to use the same decimal point system for price. Basically we, decide the core. We decide how much of that raw material goes into this item. We enter it as one lump sum, and then, right, that's it.

Matthias Miller  14:51
Yeah, per Yeah, per piece pricing. If we do it like plywood, probably would be the would probably be the simplest one. But we. It also,

Speaker 1  15:04
well, how does, where does that leave? The random? Though? Matt, does that. How, how are you categorizing the random? Though? Because that's random, or no, what did we say?

Matthias Miller  15:15
We're random. Thickness is rounded up to the nearest half, or is rounded up to half inch, one inch, and it's priced without curve.

Unknown Speaker  15:23
So we're pricing it with with cans, aren't we?

Unknown Speaker  15:29
Well, it's, I'm sorry, we're no, we're just can't.

Speaker 1  15:35
But the same for board foot lumber prices can't. Is that right? Is that what we left there?

Matthias Miller  15:43
You can, if it's cut out of random, you can control the random pricing. It's probably, probably is set up that way. But you can, it doesn't have to match cans.

Speaker 1  15:53
Oh, it doesn't have to, okay, because, yeah, you have, okay. So I can, I can. So anything that's random is going to be a different Yeah. So then my question would be, is it also an option to create another rough cut lumber category and let the calculations run the same as as can't, or random or same as can't. Yeah, okay, because, because the four by six I wasn't aware are actually higher priced than three and a half by six. So that's true. So and then if I throw that into a special order lumber category, it's little. I mean, I feel like we use more volume than what I want to throw in that special order lumber category, you know, right? And it kind of it. We handle it like the other cants. We cut boards and runners out of it, and it's just a different price point. And so

Matthias Miller  17:07
it should, it should be just, I mean, it's just like canter cutback, right? And then if you want to, you can add a keyword to make sure that it ties out to the raw material, like it. Just put in four by six as a keyword. If you want to.

Speaker 1  17:23
And when you say keyword, and that what George needed to fill in, like, what was that?

Matthias Miller  17:30
Yeah, make sure that the it makes sure that the raw material info matches the raw material selection. Like, can't cut back. SPF, yp,

Speaker 1  17:39
can't size like there that can't size window.

Matthias Miller  17:43
No, this is so that when he enters it, like, let's say he has something that, if he has SPF in the raw material info that he hand enters, then he has to select an SPF to buy.

Speaker 1  18:00
If he has, sorry, I'm let me, let me catch up. If he has SPF in the in the raw material, say, can you say it again?

Matthias Miller  18:09
Well, in this drop list, well, making sure that the raw material drop list matches what he hand types in for raw material, basically. So if he puts, puts in an SPF, then making sure that if he selects SPF in the drop list, then he also has to put SPF into the raw material. And if he puts SPF into the raw material, he also has to select SPF from the drop list.

Speaker 1  18:35
Where's the drop list? I'm I'm looking at this guy right there. Yep. Where's the when you say the raw

Matthias Miller  18:44
that's called go right, go right, go right. Yeah, we have, we have two raw materials, raw material input for sawing,

Speaker 1  18:53
so it has to show up here. Yeah, really, for prey, because what he was doing, man, we were going no,

Matthias Miller  19:04
okay, for pricing, we pull it off the other place. But you had asked me to make sure that if he selects SPF, that he puts SPF into that text box. Okay, that's at least what I understood you to ask.

Speaker 1  19:20
Well, no, but we were going by. We weren't trying to, well, I don't think we were trying to fill in every raw material info box, but we were trying to go through and fill in the cant size where George was. Let me, let me see if I can ask him. Hey, George, you copy

Unknown Speaker  19:58
Radio.

Unknown Speaker  20:06
A man.

Unknown Speaker  20:13
You know the radio. Matt, just nuts. Hey, you still there? My radio's not letting me talk.

Speaker 1  20:35
I'm having issues with my radio. Sorry, I'm Can you stop by the conference room soon, Matt and I have a question.

Unknown Speaker  20:59
He heard me or not. I think so.

Matthias Miller  21:02
Okay, so if, if you're cutting something out of two bytes, you don't really care what's in this, in the sawing info for the guys in the cut list, you just send it out.

Speaker 1  21:11
Um, let me wrap my head around that, Matt.

Unknown Speaker  21:22
Um, sorry, I'm not. You said, If we

Matthias Miller  21:29
you've got an item that uses two buys, yep, and you send it out on the cut list for the first sawing, yup. Do you care whether it says anything about SPF for the cut list?

Speaker 1  21:39
Well, I guess, does the raw material window show up at all? It does, I guess that doesn't know.

Matthias Miller  21:48
So we had talked about, yeah, we talked about making that automatic, where we could automatically generate that info for the cut list from raw material and everything else.

Speaker 1  21:56
But was that you me? Was that our discussion? Yeah, okay, um, and so you're getting verification of the raw material in the raw material drop down, but how's, why does it need confirmation in the other category, in the raw material info category.

Matthias Miller  22:23
Do you care if they get a cut list, if the if it's made out of two buys? Do you care where the guys see that on the cut list or not? Yeah.

Speaker 1  22:33
I mean, they have to know what. They have to know what their material is that they're going to cut Yes.

Matthias Miller  22:40
Okay, so the short answer is that it's easier to make sure that George puts it in that box for the cut list than it is to figure out everything that's needed to make sure that we can automatically come up with Yeah, I think it's basically, let's bite, let's not bite off more than what we can chew. We can clean up. We could clean up what goes on the cut list, but very likely,

Speaker 1  23:15
well, does the can't description go in the cut list for

Matthias Miller  23:22
is it? It does for the sizers,

Unknown Speaker  23:25
for the sizers, but not for the

Unknown Speaker  23:28
sign, right? Okay,

Speaker 1  23:32
yeah, I really want to have George to talk through that.

Matthias Miller  23:40
I think the right thing to do, if you want to go down this route is make a report of all the raw material info that we have filled in and see how closely we can replicate it based on information that we have, and then start cleaning up the information so that we can automatically generate it. But

Speaker 1  24:04
you're saying, create another list of everything, of all the items?

Matthias Miller  24:10
Yeah, we want to. I mean, I think, I think you're going to want to a screen where you can, I don't know, here's, here's the very short bottom line, we can certainly clean up raw material. We can certainly automatically come up with that for the cut list. It's good cleanup. It doesn't get us closer to pricing, which is our current number one big priority. I um, we just need to. We're just need to get in the weeds of what it takes to make, when you say,

Speaker 1  24:47
clean up raw material. What? Sorry, are you talking about this raw material? Drop down.

Matthias Miller  24:53
I mean, if we go down the route of automatically coming up with whatever needs to go in the cut. List for sawing instead of George putting it in by hand. We can do that. But my instinct and suspicion is that that sounds really simple on the surface, but it's not going to be perfectly, yeah, not as simple as it appears. And we can do that, but it's going to take somebody's going to need to go through and make sure that everything that we're coming up with automatically, that we handle all the scenarios, basically,

Speaker 1  25:29
is there a lot of them that don't have that are missing the raw material info for so long? In other words, do you know how many are missing

Unknown Speaker  25:40
that? I can find out. Okay,

Speaker 1  25:43
is that one there is definitely coming off a size or initially, then it goes out to the site the West sharp that one we were just looking at. What list Am I on here? I'm on.

Matthias Miller  25:55
There's, there's, well, okay, but how do I know? I guess if it has a saw,

Speaker 2  26:09
behind that red cane there, up against Whoa, where do you want to disappear, to come back? And he's other end, somewhere. All right, we have 174

Matthias Miller  26:40
outside, we have 174 items where there's a saw specified but no sawing. Info,

Unknown Speaker  26:52
what's an example?

Matthias Miller  26:57
Do you care what some of the waves, wave, 100 100 1011021031070

Speaker 1  27:10
there you are. Did you hear me? My radio wouldn't let me talk. It's it just goes bare bear, burp. And then I have to wait, burp. And then finally, then you couldn't hear me. Oh, George for talking about this raw material

Unknown Speaker  27:31
windows that

Unknown Speaker  27:38
that's in the cleanup.

Speaker 1  27:40
Well, I'm not sure if it is,

Speaker 3  27:43
you know, I'm working on ARSP right now about four the way through it the other day, and then had to put it on the back burner.

Unknown Speaker  27:51
102, Matt, yeah, sure.

Matthias Miller  28:00
So if you go down to the third line here, 45 right there, that doesn't look right, fourth, maybe it's a fourth line, fourth line

Unknown Speaker  28:15
that's can't.

Unknown Speaker  28:18
That should be sizer,

Unknown Speaker  28:22
right? That? No, that's not

Unknown Speaker  28:26
it. See all this

Unknown Speaker  28:33
number saying about wave 102, raw material and is

Unknown Speaker  28:47
The What am I missing? It's got a

Matthias Miller  28:58
hang on. This is on the 102 is on the bridge with being

Matthias Miller  29:18
no it is, it is the, it is the third line you're putting on the bridge with bandsaw. Bring it through the Bridgewood bandsaw. But we're not there's no raw material in the sawing. Info,

Speaker 3  29:40
I went wrong, right behind, to the left, right there. No, that's where the where he's talking about, would you put Well, what is it that.

Speaker 1  30:00
Yes, I guess what Matt's saying is like, for example, these get cut on the sizer, on the brewer, right in some 13, five and a half 40 fives

Speaker 1  30:19
size or miscellaneous prep, shouldn't this cut 340 fives and stuff be over in a sizer window?

Speaker 3  30:26
Yeah, once it over there. Let me put that stuff over there.

Speaker 4  30:32
I don't know. I mean, we had her one time we had raw material was supposed to be incisor.

Unknown Speaker  30:44
So I moved all that, No man, over to sizer. So it was like reversed, but that's cut 345, that should be incisor in the semi hpro That

Speaker 1  30:57
was, that was entered in the sizer. Can you open that?

Speaker 3  31:01
Can you what else is behind her? Onto this line right here, what's behind her?

Unknown Speaker  31:12
Double one edge.

Speaker 3  31:16
So above a one edge will be, what is it? What's the size of it? Inch and 13 five and a half. So that should be in your saw raw material, and then the 340 fives and the other one should be in your size or prep.

Speaker 1  31:37
Yeah, the raw material here would Matt, would be the yield from the sizer. Because it's going from the sizer, it's getting cut to a certain size in the raw material, the yield is then the raw material for sowing. I don't know how we're not sure.

Matthias Miller  31:54
So then we'd have to start, I mean, we basically, probably just have to start specifying the size or yield. Would we or is that inferred? Can we reverse? Well, I don't know if it's not a sawing Can we look at the sawing multiplier and work backwards? Is that? Is that the yield, size or yield,

Matthias Miller  32:18
not necessarily. I

Unknown Speaker  32:32
Yeah, you lost me, Matt, I didn't.

Speaker 1  32:37
Well, how did, sorry, how did this miscellaneous prep go down in the sawing mat? It because it would have been on a size or miscellaneous prep originally.

Matthias Miller  32:47
Um, let me take a look sure how

Unknown Speaker  32:50
it ended up in that line.

Matthias Miller  32:53
I think it's probably because the Excel file. Well, there's a lot of this stuff that's in weird places because of the Excel file, it doesn't mean that this one is, let's go take a look. So we look down in activity

Unknown Speaker  33:08
history, the two. Let's see the sizer. I

Matthias Miller  33:25
prep, because originally we just had one miscellaneous prep, which is where this one came in as. And then we said, we need two miscellaneous preps. But what do we do with with miscellaneous prep? And then we said, well, most of the miscellaneous prep is probably for I think this is what we did. I think we said most of the miscellaneous prep is probably for sawing. So let's kick it over to sawing. And we never came back. And I mean, George is probably fixing as he came through, but I don't know that we ever spent time cleaning this up.

Speaker 4  34:06
And there's quite a few, because I've been that's been non stop with the four way notching on the Keystone. I've been having a lot of those that are, you know, mean, they're completely gone. And I constantly put, I mean, I'm constantly putting them in for the throw a red flag up to me, because they it seemed like they were there, but then they weren't there. So I don't know what, but I always double check to make sure that what I'm doing on the Keystone, and if it is four way notch that I know by heart, if it is, I always throw out to the right. And if it's not there, then I put, I type it in there first, and then I go into items list, and, you know, me correct it in there. That way it's good to go for the next time

Speaker 1  34:55
it it, I guess it seemed like some stuff moved so. Since we had it in silver loom, some of the stuff

Matthias Miller  35:04
correct, I think I laid out. I mean, I can go triple check, but I think, I mean here, let's go. Let's go find out this. I mean this, yeah, we moved a bunch of stuff from the back in August.

Matthias Miller  35:37
Let me go take a look at something,

Speaker 3  35:40
maneuver vehicles around. But we have a life group. Was supposed to be tomorrow night. Now they moved it up to 130 so I'm trying to get I gotta take my son off.

Speaker 1  35:56
I'm trying to drive Matt. This was, Are you saying? This was originally in miscellaneous trap, but we separated it. But when, if they get, if it got moved like at and it starts on a size or, I don't know, I don't know what? Yeah, I I heard what you said. I don't know. I don't know what. I don't remember that commerce. I don't remember what we well, slushed on it.

Speaker 4  36:28
Well, this stuff pick up on that clean up sheet.

Matthias Miller  36:31
Matt, well, if I mean, I can, okay, here's a little side note before we get too far down the road. We on August 26 we moved a whole lot of things from the sizer miscellaneous prep over to thawing miscellaneous prep, I think, because I'd have to go back to check our actual conversations on that day, but that's that this was at the time that we were splitting it apart into two miscellaneous preps. We can. I can certainly add it to the cleanup ship cleanup sheet, if we like, obviously you shouldn't have, well, you should have raw material. Info, sawing, if you have a saw, is that correct, right? And do you want size or miscellaneous prep? Are there more cases where you want size or miscellaneous prep?

Speaker 4  37:30
Yeah, probably because, I mean, at first, if there's different characteristics to that, I mean, once it's done, if it's just the sizer and it's once and done, we're good. But if there's like, a special like, we have to cut angles. We got to cut diagonals. We got a bevel. Like, here, this one is exactly that's where I need to tell it. Because when a forklift operator picks it up off of that, that machine, that sizer, then he's rather than just taking it from, you know, mean, point A to point B, or if it goes into specialty in the sewing category, then it's got to go to another certain area. And that's what which is so I try and put that on the sizer to put bevel, or that way he knows that it goes to another area before it's done.

Matthias Miller  38:23
Done. What were the what would be the words that would flag that?

Speaker 4  38:32
Well, I would say on there to bevel cut or to slot. Some get slotted. What else is there? Some get Yeah, some get slotted. Like, I cut a long length piece of inch and a 16, five and a half, and then we have taken to the west shop to cut eighteens out of it. So it'll say in size or miscellaneous prep. You don't mean, hey, it's got cut long length, but we have to take it and cut 18 inches, 18 inch boards. So that's what would be sprayed on that bundle. Just identify what's, what's going to happen with it after, if there's any type of specialty involved in it,

Matthias Miller  39:15
would not change be included in that.

Speaker 4  39:17
Yeah, notching. That's for the Keystone. That's definitely, that's definitely on the Keystone with the size of miscellaneous prep. And then we all like, if I do like a couple different songing scenarios, rather than just cutting 340s or 348 248, if I gotta cut 340 fours and then kick 33 out of the backside. That's incisor miscellaneous prep too.

Matthias Miller  39:45
So should, can we put kick on the on the list? If, if to flag as well, or no kick? Do? I'm looking for what's what? How do I like? Are there words in miscellaneous prep that we can pick out that say, Hey, this needs to be included in size or miscellaneous prep?

Speaker 4  40:14
Well, I think, I mean, my vote would be, I mean, I'd rather fix it as we go. I mean, I'm not sure how many we're looking at. I say, man,

Speaker 1  40:25
if there's, if there's no, if it's going to a size or and there's no size or miscellaneous flag, it right? And then if it's going to a saw, sure there's no sawing, miscellaneous prep flag it

Matthias Miller  40:49
and also flag, if it's going to saw with no raw material info.

Speaker 1  40:58
Right, right. The the raw material info. I know we talked a while back about, if it goes from a sizer to a saw, the sizer creates the new the raw material size that goes to the saw. I don't know if that's is that working? Oh, like the sizer should be the raw material for the salt.

Unknown Speaker  41:36
Does that? Does that make sense? Matt,

Matthias Miller  41:41
okay, so let me, let me, let me

Unknown Speaker  41:44
say this song. Well,

Speaker 1  41:49
when you you have a job, you need inch and 16, three and a 46 inch runners. That's your size that you're getting off of the size. Or your raw material for the sizer is the three and a half by eight and a half, 12 Foot cans. Your yield is inch and a 16, three and a half, 46 then it then the saw is the notcher, right? If you

Speaker 3  42:18
don't single head, you are but if you're doing the size or incisor miscellaneous, but, and that's now if i That's a good one, because if I only got three pieces for Armstrong Marietta, right, not to set the Keystone up for three pieces, that's where it's going to say, to notch, as long as I put to notch on the single head notcher understand well. And then missile saw in prep, I put in inch of five, three and a half, whatever.

Speaker 1  42:49
All right, so single head notcher that's creating, because the notcher is another saw. And for pricing purposes, we are calling that another pass through a saw, gets can't it goes through the cant size or a keystone, that's one pass. Then it also goes straight over to the notcher. That's a second pass. That's more cost, but for your miscellaneous prep, because you're not seeing on the Keystone. You're not sick. Well, what? Let's go to that job

Unknown Speaker  43:31
of the arrow one. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  43:44
Eastern, three and a half by six, 192 can't species size or miscellaneous prep.

Speaker 3  44:04
I'll say, if I was three pieces, I know it put,

Speaker 1  44:08
I guess Matt, there's no as if, if it's on a sizer and there's no missing, like we said, if there's no miscellaneous prep, then George gonna have to enter something. And if it's on a saw with no miscellaneous prep, and then he has 10 or something, okay?

Matthias Miller  44:23
And then do you want, if there's a sizer and a saw, do you want the raw material input for sewing? Or do you want to take a look at coming up with that automatically?

Speaker 1  44:31
Well, we talked about that a long time ago. I don't remember what what you said could or couldn't be done then, uh,

Matthias Miller  44:38
well, it looks to me like we need a saw, one multiplier to do that.

Unknown Speaker  44:44
It might, I mean, so,

Matthias Miller  44:48
like we,

Unknown Speaker  44:51
we don't have,

Speaker 1  44:55
let me check Where's an example of the multiplier. When does that kick in?

Matthias Miller  45:00
Okay, well, I'm just going through a list here.

Speaker 1  45:02
Does that kick in? If, if I, if I say, it needs a salt. One like, if I go, what's one where you run on a single hit? Not sure. Or what's

Unknown Speaker  45:12
one? Alfred diesel, Stafford diesel.

Unknown Speaker  45:20
Okay, that's good. Do

Unknown Speaker  45:23
you remember size to 72

Unknown Speaker  45:27
at 32 think so.

Speaker 1  45:30
There's another one down at the bottom 72 by 32 Why was there two of them?

Unknown Speaker  45:35
Well, they're different numbers.

Unknown Speaker  45:37
Solution, 13, three and a half, 72 i

Unknown Speaker  45:43
No, that's inch and seven. So it's not that

Unknown Speaker  45:46
this one here is engine 13. The other

Unknown Speaker  45:49
one, it's got to be this guy, ancient 13, three and a half, 72

Speaker 3  45:57
see the screwy Lily with that one is one ends notch different than the other. That's why I can't do on the keys. Then okay,

Unknown Speaker  46:04
so can't size at least kids BCS

Speaker 3  46:15
and see, that's why it wasn't notched when they were getting ready to make it, because there's nothing there, and I know it was there.

Speaker 3  46:27
As I said, I think it's 15 and a half on one end, and 12 and a half on the other end.

Unknown Speaker  46:35
And you think that was in your word?

Speaker 3  46:39
Well, I was scratching my I didn't really do get the look at it since it happened. But, you know me, John T came in and said, hey, when the runners ain't notched, which, I know I had it in there, because it's, it's a

Unknown Speaker  46:55
it's the only one that's different on each

Unknown Speaker  46:57
end. I don't know why they different.

Unknown Speaker  47:00
And then. So that means this should say, saw one is single head. Not sure, right?

Speaker 3  47:15
So, like miscellaneous approach, should say engine 13, three out of 72

Speaker 1  47:21
Well, if that Matt could that role, if, if it goes from sizer to Saul, can the raw material be the dimensions that we're trying to get off the sizer

Unknown Speaker  47:37
is that easy. So

Matthias Miller  47:39
can you pull up an item. Well, I'm looking at one right now. Well, I'm looking at a specific one. ARSP, 52 by 38 I've got a question. How you would do this one? SP, 52 by 38 you

Matthias Miller  48:03
so scroll down. It's the, it's one of, I think it's the first the second row there, that one. So it is coming out of a three and a half by six by 16. Oh, can't demand, yeah, but this doesn't have a sewing multiplier on on it anywhere.

Unknown Speaker  48:27
Smaller four kids,

Speaker 1  48:31
single it. See there's the same as what we had earlier that this would typically, this was miscellaneous prep. But now this needs split, like some of this, the cut 152 and a kick, the 144 and eight needs to be on the sizer, miscellaneous prep. And then the two notch eight inches from man that needs to go on the solve, miscellaneous prep.

Matthias Miller  48:59
Okay, so that's fair, but one of the questions is, it's coming out of a three and a half by six. Can't we're cutting it there's inch and a half by three and a half. There's no indication anywhere on this that we're like is, is the, is the can't cutting it down to inch and a half by three and a half? Or is the single head notcher doing that?

Speaker 1  49:21
The can the sizer is?

Matthias Miller  49:24
It's interesting. So then we we need a size or yield of some kind, or a size or multiplier or something

Speaker 1  49:32
the size or yield or is it is the inch of five, three and a half, 52

Matthias Miller  49:36
Hang on. No, what am I missing here? Let me. Let me go back and check if because the raw material maybe I'm on the wrong row, go to the last row this one.

Unknown Speaker  49:50
Okay, okay,

Matthias Miller  49:53
the raw material is a three and a half for sawing is a three and a half by six. So. Is the raw material wrong?

Speaker 1  50:05
Wait for sowing. Hold on raw material for

Unknown Speaker  50:13
saw it shouldn't be there.

Unknown Speaker  50:15
Oh, well, that would have How'd that get there?

Matthias Miller  50:23
I mean, it's the bottom line that somebody needs to go through and clean up all the

Speaker 3  50:29
let's see that bottom line shouldn't even be there. Where was it originally?

Speaker 4  50:34
Well, you don't. You already have your strength. Go back to the left, please.

Speaker 1  50:42
But this was something that was typed in sometime, right, or came off of a cut list, or,

Speaker 4  50:48
yeah, but it's, it's, it's double do. It's double dipping on the inch and five, six

Unknown Speaker  50:54
go the whole way left.

Speaker 4  50:57
See You already got your three stringers, and it's double doing. We don't need another three stringers and 10 boards, right? It should be just 10 doors. First two cells are good. The bottom two are repeating ourselves.

Unknown Speaker  51:16
I had a simple one too, yesterday. I

Unknown Speaker  51:24
I don't know why. I don't care. Do you

Speaker 1  51:32
have any idea why that got why those two lines got duplicated, Matt and then, I mean, it's diff. See that one thing that I see is that, I mean, the one was saying Brewer size or the other one saying Keystone sizer.

Matthias Miller  51:51
Like, if I could find out,

Speaker 1  51:56
give me a minute. I mean, the simple answer is that at one point we were cutting it on the brewer, running it through our single head. Not sure. Now we're running it on the Keystone and,

Unknown Speaker  52:17
oh, okay, so this is

Matthias Miller  52:23
yes, this one is

Speaker 3  52:26
the so if I change it on the sawing cut list, will it? Change it in there? It should so that's once and done. If I change it just on the song cut list, so that don't that doesn't stay right.

Speaker 4  52:41
That's why I go back into the items list once I type it in there and

Speaker 3  52:45
make make the correction, so it'll be right to next time. Let

Matthias Miller  53:00
me see if I can find this.

Speaker 2  53:04
Make some comment announcement there. Great. Tom I think just to let people heads up trying to do Monday,

Speaker 3  53:15
old sweet bend, I'll try and get here. You want to know, see ones, see what's now. One's talking about nobody coming over here Sunday.

Speaker 3  53:32
Alan said, I don't understand that. But I said, You got to get back home too. Then he saw I got road trips.

Speaker 1  53:43
He'd be here. We don't need to be. It's snow day, Sunday, but he said

Speaker 3  53:48
it's going to be a lot easier. That's yeah, I understand that. But then he said to have 18 inches of snow land all at one time.

Speaker 3  54:01
Jeff color did that with that 28 inches that day. I said, we just got to keep pushing. Because I said 28 inches. I said, we got and that's when we just had the two jcbs, and now we decided to get home, and that was wrong. That was stupid. So they either camp out in here somewhere, or stopped at my mom's and stayed there.

Unknown Speaker  54:28
Dad didn't offer you bed.

Speaker 3  54:31
I just want to get home. They were, I think we were pushing since four about that, and we decided to get out here two, 230 or three o'clock in the afternoon. It helped out, though, because then we didn't have as much stuff to do. Then it got windier, all get out, and everything blew shuffle for three days. And.

Matthias Miller  55:00
Have your name. I mean, the Excel file has you check this to 238 Yeah, the Excel file had four rows in here for this. So that's where that came from, back from the from Steven's Excel file.

Unknown Speaker  55:19
It had what? Four rows. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  55:21
four rows in in here for this.

Unknown Speaker  55:40
So, I

Matthias Miller  55:46
mean, the bottom line is, we've never split this apart into two pieces, and somebody needs to do it. That's, I mean, it's obnoxious, but, and so the question then becomes, what's the best way to go about doing that? Who should do it? What do they need? What's the best, best way to go about doing that?

Speaker 4  56:05
Well, my vote would be, let's get the prints into the system, into silver loom, and then start from A to Z, and if we need to have that print to refer to rather than right now we're getting a folder out of the drawer, like, right now I'm in the ARSP because that stuff's that's the stuff I'm going through the cleanup. I did the cleanup and then I found some other ones. So I'm just starting from the beginning and doing the cube, whether it's flush, whether it's side wing, because there's some of them are messed up. But it'd be nice to have that print that you could refer to, rather than growing like there's only one queue. And you go to the drawer and get the queue, you got a couple T's, you go to the T file, bring that out, where we would have the prints in silver loom. We could relay that right from the screen, rather than jumping up, going to the drawer, pulling the stuff out.

Unknown Speaker  57:08
Yep, is that Matt, um,

Unknown Speaker  57:15
what? Yeah, it was. Saves time, is what I'm saying.

Speaker 1  57:17
I'm I know we don't have everything scanned, but I'm not sure how much, much needs scanned yet, but I know, I'm pretty sure everything was, well, I know everything went was going through at least one time, like, in other words, separating the prints that we want the ones we don't want. And so if Amanda hasn't scanned the rest. She should be able to do that Monday. Okay, are you in a position where, how close are you to where that would possibly show up on a screen somewhere?

Matthias Miller  57:53
As soon as she's got them scanned in and and has them assigned out, I can easily get them moved over. Okay.

Speaker 1  58:05
And then do you have a Can you give us a picture of where would we see? Find those on here.

Matthias Miller  58:16
They'll be down at the bottom. Yes, yeah, down there under attachments, you'll have a list under attachments with the link to download.

Unknown Speaker  58:30
So we're up to, will we have to click on it to see it? Yes, will that open another window?

Matthias Miller  58:41
Well, either it'll open a new window if you have unsaved changes, I think, and if not, it'll open in this window, or you can hit, hold down the control key to open it up in a new window.

Speaker 1  58:53
Is there? Like, if we're working on this stuff and we want to look at the print while we're working on the item data there,

Matthias Miller  59:02
we can give you a split screen.

Unknown Speaker  59:06
That good, yep,

Unknown Speaker  59:09
that'd be awesome.

Speaker 1  59:11
So when you so clean up, so can you make that automatic? So we want to, we want to look at the print, and you just goes right into a split screen. Yeah, okay, that'd be good. Matt, your question. I hear what George is saying that I think that's gonna be very good, helpful. Who should clean up this raw material stuff? It, it has to be George. That's my video, it only, it can only be George and again, um, I, I don't. Is there any objection from either one of you guys by just simply saying, if the sizer doesn't have raw material information, I'm sorry, let me start it. Server, if the sizer doesn't have miscellaneous prep, or if the saws sewing doesn't have miscellaneous prep, you're going to flag it, because that, I think that catches all the glitches and then, like these ones here, where it says it gives you sizer, sizer instructions, but it also gives you notching instructions. We're going to go in there because the one's missing, and George is going to split it out manually, and it's going to

Speaker 4  1:00:31
be right. Well, I hear you, but is if there's nothing that has, if the item doesn't have any type of size or fret whatever. It's not going to be in there. But if you're saying, if there's nothing in there, say you're going to Red Flag stuff that's not, don't need stuff in there. It's there's stuff like, say there's any type of

Speaker 1  1:00:57
you're saying, there's some that are, they're just not going to have instructions like, what?

Speaker 4  1:01:01
There's not examples. Hey, I'm cutting 716, three and a half 40 inch boards for

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
give an example.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
Let's do Arnold's. I'm not sure what it's a 4840, Arnold one. Yeah. It's driving off. Is it five and a half inch boards? Yeah, scroll out there as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
Can't brew Matt that optimal. Can size. That's just a we can

Matthias Miller  1:01:33
get rid of that. It doesn't matter anymore,

Speaker 1  1:01:38
okay, I agree. I ain't got, sounds good. There's, you can't length species, see

Speaker 4  1:01:44
there any nonsense? Because right, insist for through the gang saw, it's done. So you're setting, wait, you're saying that, yeah, it's, it's blank, red flag. You want throw stuff on there that, if

Matthias Miller  1:01:59
it's going to a saw, we'll put, we'll ask for miscellaneous prep. But if it's not perfect,

Speaker 1  1:02:06
that's right, Matt, if it's, if it's just on a size, or it can be blank, but if it's going to sawing, then there has to be something there. And, well, I guess there has. Doesn't necessarily have to be something there, but let's just see what happens.

Matthias Miller  1:02:32
Well, we can. So if there's this, if it's going to the sizer, we'll we'll flag it if it doesn't have a size or miscellaneous prep, if it's going to a saw, we'll flag it if it doesn't have a sawing, miscellaneous prep. And the one remaining question then is, would you like to find a way to automatically generate the raw material info for sizing or for sawing?

Speaker 1  1:02:59
I don't I think that would be fine, because the yield on the sizer is always the raw material on the saw, right? George, so it could be Matt, that you know, the the yield on the sizer is these dimensions, right? Here. This one here will be some 16, five and a half 40, if you want to do something else with it. This probably gets notch. Don't know, they're not sure.

Matthias Miller  1:03:30
But so the main thing that I would need then is,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:38
then I gotta cut it on the bones like blocks or Miller chair.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
Well, I understand, right?

Speaker 1  1:03:57
And we No, no, we talked Hang on. No, we talked about that. Let's look at that.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
Matt, did you have a question? Sorry, you did.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
Usual mentions can't

Unknown Speaker  1:04:37
see, and there's another one since only again that's I

Speaker 1  1:04:43
went there automatically at some, some time, when we did, when we migrated, I think something

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
so if I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:04:57
I have a host of questions, I could do this. Yes, I don't know if it's

Unknown Speaker  1:05:03
right. They do have,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
well, I'm I'm just looking at one that 1116, three and a half, 17, 1/8

Speaker 1  1:05:27
that's the end goal. But the sizer cannot cut that short.

Speaker 1  1:05:38
George is telling the sizer to cut it, 69 a quarter and last piece long, length, right? George.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
But then that's

Speaker 1  1:06:04
so in that scenario, the raw material wouldn't be right for the sawing.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:14
Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
So what are your questions?

Matthias Miller  1:06:27
Matt, well, so what's your what's your proposal? How do you suggest we handle it here,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40
with what's in goal in mind.

Matthias Miller  1:06:44
Well, if you're if you really would like to have automatic the raw material, automatically generated, generated from the rest of the info, no, I hear you. How should we handle this?

Speaker 1  1:06:54
One raw material for sawing to do every to make sure everything is correct would have to be entered manually. You're good with that big Big Cheese. Big Cheese is good with it. Then that's the then that's the answer.

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
Matt, okay, yeah, because there's a lot of and some of the stuff. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but there's some of it that's there. Some of it may be discrepancy, some of it may just be the way it actually is, and all of that. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:07:44
you're looking at what some different examples. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:47
if you go to, I made a, yeah, I'm looking at different examples. If you go to the folders icon on the left there and go into shared, go into the go out and go to automatic raw material down for that one.

Matthias Miller  1:08:15
I mean, ah, F 10 is where it starts to diverge. You know we need to handle

Unknown Speaker  1:08:25
HF, would you say 10?

Matthias Miller  1:08:28
Yeah, like that first line there. We'd have to figure out how we want to, how we'd want to handle, how we want to handle that. How do we handle random, that's an that's an issue, etc, etc. So if George is happy with it, doing it by hand. I thought there was another one that looked like looked off, but I don't remember where it was. It was, oh, you go to Al 50 a.

Matthias Miller  1:08:56
We're yielding into 116 so raw material is one by random. So we're yielding more than the whatever.

Speaker 1  1:09:06
That's an example. The thing there is, I'm sure we, somehow, we designed the pallet to be inch and a 16th thick random instead of one inch or less. That's what happened there. Sure, do we? We don't. Do we still do that sometimes. Could we change that? Because, I mean, assuming we would, if we run this guy, we don't. We saying one inch. We telling the guys one inch at this point. Or are we still trying to, boom, yeah. So that one there just needs,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46
just change it from mention the 16th element,

Speaker 1  1:09:49
item number, all material, instrument, 16th, right, and with 54

Speaker 3  1:09:59
OH. And see that ain't right either. Well, it's at with one by random by 54 this either should be 30 or should we?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
Well, if that's That's raw material, though, let's go there. I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
The length is 30

Unknown Speaker  1:10:28
See, that's what it was saying. Raw material, 5454

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
should be coverage over your stringer.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
That's two and a half inch

Unknown Speaker  1:10:39
space, and that's why it's 54

Speaker 3  1:10:44
you see what I mean. It should be 30 inch random, not 54 inch lengths. 54 is your coverage.

Speaker 1  1:10:57
Raw material, mix in this clear, plain, one inch playing one edge. So Matt, this guy

Speaker 2  1:11:13
missed so funny. Matt, wine, that's mine. I

Speaker 1  1:11:23
Well, Matt, this isn't, I can't remember. It doesn't. The random get calculated at layers of 40, a 40,

Matthias Miller  1:11:34
yeah, but this one's not specified as it the random isn't. Nobody clicked the random thing on here. It's not yielding random. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, it is. It is layers that

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
never mind. Does the box need clicked? Or

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
what's the Yeah, how are you cutting it out of random without yielding random, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
That was the problem, right? The box wasn't clicked, yeah? I think so yeah, because now yeah, that's what it

Unknown Speaker  1:12:08
was if the

Speaker 1  1:12:13
romance message were random, okay? That is, isn't that? What it's saying? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:12:30
sorry, boy, do that one more time.

Speaker 1  1:12:32
Save it. Yeah. Do you want? Is it well, isn't RW? Was an RW. Is RW?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:47
What you want? Well, I thought,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
didn't we say it could be random or RW?

Speaker 1  1:13:02
Yeah, we just for, I mean, just for, like, because stuff that was already in there,

Matthias Miller  1:13:10
well, so it depends, it depends how the how it's specified. I mean, we use both, and we'll continue using both. Sometimes we use random, almost like a species. Sometimes we'll use our and we'll use our W as dimensions. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:13:34
we can, can allow both,

Speaker 1  1:13:37
okay, so can I leave this ignore and save for now,

Matthias Miller  1:13:43
just just Ignore and save.

Speaker 1  1:13:54
Excuse me so, so that the task at hand is going to be, it's going to be added to this. What I just do. Just closed it out. All right, all right.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:18
Wait item, clean up.

Speaker 1  1:14:25
So Matt, wait You just, if I go back to that folder, that was a lot of stuff. How many lines was in that folder?

Matthias Miller  1:14:36
I was showing everything? So it's, it's all the lumber lines for everything.

Speaker 1  1:14:43
Okay, 1400 Um, well, this folder isn't a it's not a worksheet, right? I mean, it's not, it's just a folder.

Matthias Miller  1:14:56
Yeah, it's not, there's not great. So if

Speaker 1  1:14:59
we go back, if I. Go to item cleanup, do you want to show again? Okay, yeah, if the sizer, if the size or miscellaneous prep is missing, you want to show that, even though there's times there's so if there's no miscellaneous prep required, if it's just the size or, like, can we leave it go and then it'll accept that? Or is that

Matthias Miller  1:15:39
if, if it's if it's running the sizer, but no miscellaneous prep is required, then we don't have any way to flag missing miscellaneous prep.

Speaker 1  1:15:51
So if you fly, but I'm saying if you flag it, and we do all the cleanup, and we leave some sit there, like that Arnold that we just looked at there, not only items list, am I Maybe orals in here?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:09
No, it's not the items I

Speaker 1  1:16:25
So Matt, here's one, the 40 inch lumber.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:31
It's sizer you would want to just

Matthias Miller  1:16:39
put in something like na or something if nothing special is required.

Speaker 1  1:16:45
Well, my I think my question was, if there's no sawing down the road, do you care if

Matthias Miller  1:16:53
we leave it? No, we I don't care if there's no sawing. I don't care if it's blank, if there's no sizer, do you care down the road two years from now, George hands this off, somebody else is putting sawing info in, or is putting setting up item data. They select a sizer. Do you want it to flag for them if they leave the miscellaneous prep blank? Or do you not care? That's my question.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
Yeah. Here.

Speaker 3  1:17:38
Either way, I don't think it doesn't hurt, but I think they put more information in, right? It shouldn't be miscellaneous.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:48
Miscellaneous. Prep isn't always necessary.

Matthias Miller  1:17:59
So do you care about them forgetting if it's not necessary, and if not, we'll just add the temporary cleanup stuff and we'll get rid of it later. Or we'll, we'll,

Speaker 1  1:18:10
yeah, that's what I'm that's what I'm thinking, Matt. I mean is that a box? Is that a window in sawing on the printout every time.

Matthias Miller  1:18:24
Miscellaneous prep, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:18:26
so whether there's something in it or not, it's going to be there the columns there. Yeah, correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:42
I guess we could just write in none, or

Speaker 3  1:18:51
just something that it's going to see, and then once they get used to

Unknown Speaker  1:18:57
it's text, yeah, be nicer to just to

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
not that one. Pull it in again, sir.

Matthias Miller  1:19:04
We'll add it temporarily, and we'll get rid of it once you're once.

Speaker 1  1:19:08
All right. So Matt, then,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:12
oh shoot, there's a couple of things I was kicking along the way. I think

Unknown Speaker  1:19:22
smoke coming off our ears. Mike,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:34
what were we at random?

Speaker 1  1:19:41
Well, I think that answers the question on the miscellaneous prep conversation for now, right? Matt, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:19:49
what triggered it all was raw material, and we have answers for all of that, as well as miscellaneous prep. So, yes, correct. Okay, yes, but I do have something for George, if he's still. Available.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:03
Yep, I'm here,

Matthias Miller  1:20:06
MERV, if you want to go back into the folders, yes, and there's one dated for the day that's called cleanup, right below where you were down right there. So, George, there was a bug in the software where yield sometimes got entered on the well, yield got recorded on the date of entry, not, not by any fault of your own, on the date of entry instead of the date that you had put in. See, I was going to we could filter this down. Hang on. Give me one second. There's actually we can, we can? We can prune this list just a little

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
bit after our

Speaker 1  1:20:56
phone. It's business as usual, if possible, but you're thinking about as far as pushing production back couple hours. Yeah, now I like to say something guys, either at last break or right after last break, just before asking. So, yeah, before then, I

Speaker 3  1:21:16
think it'd be nice if this evening for lunchtime, if at all possible. Now, fish drifting and, I mean, these guys on the back roads in vans, they're not right? No, lunchtime makes

Speaker 1  1:21:28
a short it's probably worth give me it's only four. I mean, like 10 o'clock, I think by then it should be very the forecast hasn't really changed. No, it has Sunday right Sunday morning looks like it. It might be done by midnight the way it looks.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:49
I think we should be. Things will get that's my opinion. But even

Speaker 3  1:21:57
what time you starting Monday morning, maybe two or two or three of them see what happens

Unknown Speaker  1:22:05
early Monday out,

Speaker 1  1:22:09
if it's, if it's not snowing, and you can come and you can start, we'll talk. We're on the phone with we're still on that. We'll we'll get when I'm going up here. Oh, Mel, if you don't mind. And then let's create some space in that fleet shop to at least put one tractor in there, the which the repair work, the I figured that out, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:36
two tractors

Speaker 3  1:22:38
like you have. Maybe take me out.

Speaker 1  1:22:42
Is that right? Yeah, that's good. Does Melanie help you? I don't want to clean it up, the pallets and stuff down there or, I mean, if he's covered, if he's good, then yeah, you're free. I was going to, I wanted to come down to by the farm, but I just couldn't I'm I'm still not caught up, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:23:12
Okay, so there was a bug that in which the thawing yield got recorded. I got recorded on the wrong date, and I'm happy to help clean up in any way we need to. This is a list of anything where we recorded yield after the due date, which I'm going to guess is basically,

Matthias Miller  1:23:50
I'm going to guess that's the majority of the of the time, unless, unless you were cutting ahead several days, in which case We might have more discrepancies than this.

Speaker 4  1:24:01
Well, sawing, yeah, sawing and upload, or sewing I'm doing daily. So, I mean, it was the dates. I mean, anytime it would change date wise would be if it's in inventory, and then I take it off the sewing cutlet or not the saw, like the sawing, the sage, not orders that Tina makes, and I'll do it, you know, mean to sit that day. But other than that, everything else installing is like great with the date, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:34
So we could look at the that's actually a good idea and think about that. So we could take a look at the Hang on. Let's. Let me check something.

Speaker 4  1:24:43
I noticed there was one in there once in a blue moon. And when I'm putting something into sawing yield, it won't. It'll go up red and say, I can't save it. So I reload it. Try it again. It don't. So then I go back to the sawing page. Age, and just put my quantity there and put the date, and then, you know, main market complete, because it won't allow me to do it on the sole yield sheet. It's only happens once in a only once in a while. I mean, could this be part of that bug you're talking about.

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
It's possible. Yeah, yes, it is. It is possible, yep, if you refresh. So this is, this is when the 20, the created date is when we when you sent it over from the cut list. Due Date is a due date. And then here's the sawing date, which is obviously wrong in these in this case,

Matthias Miller  1:26:00
can we use the date? Well, it wouldn't be the date it was created. It would be the day before the business the next business day, typically, right? Or no, you would, you would make it morning of

Speaker 4  1:26:17
Yeah, because I'm going to, when I click on it, it's got the date from the day before. Oh, man, I don't have now when I'm like, the only time that's a schedule date, Keystone, I'm not I don't have all that information in, so I gotta create a date to put that info in. But sewing, I'm right on par.

Matthias Miller  1:26:50
But what time of day will you? Will you? Will you make the cut list for the next day? Or will you make it in the morning? I do

Speaker 4  1:26:58
it between six and seven. Okay, so waiting on papers to come in, papers don't come to me till the end of the day. And I'm here 10 after five in the morning. I don't want to be here till another you know, man, another hour doing that. So I try morning, and that's when it generates, you know, I mean, the date of the day before. So I don't really have to change anything, unless they get behind and but sewing, I gotta definitely do sewing, because it'll generate it back on the cut list, and then they're going to be asking me, Hey, it's already done. Why? So I gotta definitely, because once it gets on this, when I take it on a cut list, yield it disappears off the sewing list.

Matthias Miller  1:27:48
So I guess the question is, how do we get these we need to get these cut list. We gotta get these dates cleaned up accurate for reporting purposes, what's the best in MERV, we might need your input on this. Do we need the do you need to go back to the original papers and cross reference and I can help sort this stuff out? Or do you have a

Speaker 4  1:28:21
well, I have from December 1 to date and each day in a separate packet with the time sheets. Time sheets and my sewing papers are hooked together from December 1. So I got a pal starting to become the skyscraper. But I have them all hooked together from December 1, from the get go.

Matthias Miller  1:28:49
So MERV, how do you want to? How do you want to?

Speaker 4  1:28:55
Well, but is there any other information, like the created date? Is that what I'm is that to date, and I'm going to go into the packet, I need to figure that out. So there's not like sizes or anything like that to know.

Matthias Miller  1:29:12
I mean, well, I mean, I could, I could add sizes here, but,

Speaker 4  1:29:18
or we'll click on, if I can click on the sage, will that generate What's wrong or,

Matthias Miller  1:29:34
well, I'm not sure I'm okay. If you're sending it across, morning of, if you're generating building the cut list, morning of, then treated date, most likely should be the stalling the daily sawing date, or the day before, like it's it should be. Here's the item, list,

Matthias Miller  1:30:14
lumber, dimensions,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:24
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:31:29
Let's do this plus

Matthias Miller  1:32:13
okay, You want to refresh? Yeah, I here. So this would group it by, we should actually maybe that's not quite right. Be.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:34
Why is that? So? It's, is it bang on? Awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:32:57
It's not sorting in the rate.

Matthias Miller  1:33:16
Not sorting in the right order yet.

Matthias Miller  1:33:45
We need, I think that should be right if you want to refresh again.

Matthias Miller  1:33:58
And we could probably grouped by,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:09
are you saying it's these?

Matthias Miller  1:34:12
Well, any of these, we should probably refresh one more time this. I'm I think most of them are suspect.

Matthias Miller  1:34:30
Actually no hang on

Speaker 1  1:34:32
is every is everything that you're doing on work orders, is every size order separate a separate entry.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:47
Yes, so this is

Speaker 1  1:34:50
how's this being recorded. Are you just going in and entering you? You're just entering yield. That's it. Okay, it's just yield entries.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:58
And then size are on the. Adam can side organic quantity.

Speaker 1  1:35:03
How's this sporadic? Matt,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:06
well, here's where. I don't know how.

Matthias Miller  1:35:12
I am not sure at what point this I was almost, well, I

Matthias Miller  1:35:25
I see some of these sawing dates. Okay, I changed it to have to include all of the

Unknown Speaker  1:35:36
let's do this yet.

Matthias Miller  1:36:06
Okay, I don't know. The problem is, I'm not completely sure what I can trust and what I can't trust. If you refresh one more time, this is everything grouped by when it was sent to the cut list, and it's showing anything that was done after, after the due date.

Matthias Miller  1:36:36
And I think most of the started showing up 12. I uh, about mid December. It appears to me like mid December is when these started, any anything entered after about mid December is where it started going sideways.

Speaker 1  1:37:01
And what's the and what's the what's the sideways scenario?

Matthias Miller  1:37:08
The the the date for the yield is the wrong date. It's the it's it got set to the date that it was entered, instead of the date that of the actual yield. What?

Speaker 1  1:37:22
Was there an update that affected it? Or do you have any idea there? Um, so you're saying some was right and some wasn't.

Matthias Miller  1:37:37
Let me see if I can on

Unknown Speaker  1:37:38
that same day?

Matthias Miller  1:37:42
No, not, not likely on the same day.

Speaker 1  1:37:48
Well, this is here. You have everything for 1120 right? And so, well, no, there was more. All this 1120 is this all stuff all wrong? Or is it just the stuff in blue?

Matthias Miller  1:38:06
Well, I don't Okay. I don't know for sure. It seems unlikely that the stuff that's not in blue is wrong. It's very likely that the stuff in in or gray is wrong, because it says it was done on the 24th when it was due on the was due on the fifth

Speaker 4  1:38:25
but the problem is we didn't start till December 1, so there shouldn't be anything for November. December 1 was our launch date. So there's something in in November. I mean, maybe I didn't put any yield in for November. It was December 1, when I started.

Matthias Miller  1:38:50
There was yield that got put in on in November. I don't know if it was for November or not, but it was put in on the 26th

Speaker 1  1:39:03
December 1. But Matt, what you're saying? There's one that was sent the cut list, 12, one. How do you know it wasn't the sewing date?

Matthias Miller  1:39:20
Well, I'm saying the song dates after the due date. So it seems so.

Speaker 1  1:39:28
So what would have to Golly? So do we need to look at all these gray ones and see if they're wrong, and then open the silver limb ID. Here is that how to get into it?

Matthias Miller  1:39:47
Well, you can edit the daily sawing date if you know when it was done. Here, these are blanks here, hang on, we don't care about we don't care about blanks. Um, let me take those out.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:31
Of No, I

Speaker 1  1:40:48
ah, Matt, we have to get um, we have to have a meeting about our snow prep for Monday before the guys come back to work. And so we better job here for a minute. Um, are you going to be here for a while yet. I've got

Matthias Miller  1:41:03
some other stuff I have to chase, and I want to get some of this stuff send off so that we can get some of this stuff available to you for Monday. So I think we should sorry. I think we should probably wrap

Speaker 1  1:41:14
does this, is this still happening? Or when is the last time? Or when did you catch this, or I

Matthias Miller  1:41:24
caught it. I think the fix went live in the update last night. Should have, I don't know when the last time is, if you want to, you can send me the scanned sheets, then I can see if there's a good way to cut through the noise and and get it cleaned up in a relatively low effort way.

Speaker 1  1:41:58
Well, I'm asking. So here on the 20th. It's the center the cut list on the 20th, but the sawing date was the 19th. How's that possible? And the dude the 19th,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:17
there's a guy asking for you. Let me take give us some pictures. Um, thinking you might want to do my

Speaker 1  1:42:31
play. Tom, I'm 30. I'm too old. You may have back. Oh, he's on the phone, yeah, yeah, I love to kiss me his number. Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:43
Yeah, I'll play. Do

Matthias Miller  1:42:47
you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I have no idea. George, the work order got created on on the 20th so I don't know. I don't have the answer to that.

Speaker 1  1:43:01
I mean, and this doesn't include everything for the each day, because I'm sure there was more line items each day. Or how did you

Matthias Miller  1:43:09
Yeah, this is anything that has yield entered. And so if there was ever yield not recorded, then it won't be on this list.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:20
So do you want

Speaker 4  1:43:22
that's but first yield was December 1, the due date, or the date that I put it in, yield was December 1, is when I started. So there, I don't understand why there's November stuff there, because I kind of like sent it to, where is there one November,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:48
20 out, November, oh, that was early.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:53
That was way back here.

Speaker 3  1:43:56
My package start, December 1, and one of the first, because I was behind on it, and I went to December 1 and started, and then I got everything that's

Speaker 1  1:44:06
a lot of those that are just all I mean, is there things that you're sending to the cut list two days in a Row,

Speaker 4  1:44:19
if it's not done, right? That's anytime. So Matt, which,

Speaker 1  1:44:23
which sent the cut list is recorded here. Is it first time?

Matthias Miller  1:44:29
The first time? Well, it's not even, it's not even the first time. I guess we could again, change this, and again, this would be better. We could change it to the first time that it was at marked scheduled, so that would get us even closer.

Speaker 1  1:44:55
Yeah, I don't know. I mean 1600 lines. Why this isn't all the lines. How did you come up with these lines?

Matthias Miller  1:45:07
This is all the recorded yield.

Speaker 1  1:45:10
This is everything that we cut each day. That's a sewing, oh, this is a sawing. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:45:19
think it's sizers.

Matthias Miller  1:45:22
No, it includes sizers. Well, there's

Speaker 1  1:45:24
sizes in there, not, not in all the not in all the days. It doesn't

Unknown Speaker  1:45:30
maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker 1  1:45:34
I'm sure the brewer cut more than this on the 18th.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:39
But if you're Yeah, what's that?

Matthias Miller  1:45:43
Why don't you? I mean, we don't. This does not have to be cleaned up today. If you need to have your snow meeting, let's have your snow meeting. Let's figure it, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:45:57
How many, how many papers is it, George, you have all is it was right in front of my coffee. Pot? Because it's all the different guides, or

Speaker 3  1:46:08
all the time sheets that size was unsawing, yeah. And then I have the sewing packet together with the time sheets, okay? And then Brewer sizer is in the one, one clip and Keystone. Keystone is way behind footnote. I don't have a lot of information, alright?

Unknown Speaker  1:46:29
Matt shoot, that wasn't

Speaker 1  1:46:36
Alright, okay, well, oh yeah, I don't know. I've had another thing I was gonna throw out, but that's okay. Um, tools that we're going the wrong way right now, all right.

Matthias Miller  1:46:50
Um, okay. Well, the the opera still stands. You can send me the papers. I can take a look at it. I know that you've expressed a desire to see to have error free development and not pay for mistakes on our end. So feel free to send over the papers. I'll see what I can do.

Speaker 1  1:47:15
Yeah, it'd be how many papers, George, I A

Unknown Speaker  1:47:25
hundreds of papers, so we'd have to

Matthias Miller  1:47:27
like comment like,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:35
10 to 12 pages on your song schedule

Speaker 3  1:47:38
every day times that's

Matthias Miller  1:47:42
40, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:44
something like that. Times 40, days 3030, to 40. Yeah, we can't, I mean, we will, Matt, if you want. I mean, maybe that's the quickest way to for you to see what's

Unknown Speaker  1:48:01
because I don't, I

Speaker 1  1:48:03
don't know if this helps at all, but I'm sure we cut more on the 18th than just these six sizes on the brewer. Well.

Matthias Miller  1:48:11
And again, this is we could refine the date. This is the first time it was sent over to the Cutlass generator, but not necessarily scheduled. So if we would look at the schedule date, that would also, yeah, that would also help, sure,

Speaker 1  1:48:25
okay, oh, yeah, we'll do that. Scan or email is best. I'm sorry, fax or email. I don't know what's easiest for I don't

Matthias Miller  1:48:36
I'll have a fax.

Speaker 1  1:48:38
Yeah, we can probably, can we run them through there, George, like five at a time or something. Should Amanda scan them the way she's doing the prints? If she would

Matthias Miller  1:48:51
scan it into a single document, she could do it the same way that she's well, okay, yeah, she could. And then either from there, she could either email it or upload it into the upload it as a print and I can get rid of it when we're done.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:09
So just do it the same way. Or is that

Matthias Miller  1:49:12
that's that's fine, that's fine,

Speaker 1  1:49:14
and send the folder to you. Yeah. Is there one folder, or could she, like, create a separate folder? Sorry, if that's a dumb question.

Matthias Miller  1:49:28
I mean, she can, okay. The ideal would be if she just,

Matthias Miller  1:49:37
I mean, it's fine if she, if she scans them in order, she could just scan them into a single big file, and then how she gets that to me? That's, I think, if she tries to email it to me, it'll send it through Google Drive, and she just attach it to an email, I think, but

Unknown Speaker  1:49:55
well, I'll ask her to send that over Monday morning. Okay. Is that good for you? Yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:04
all right, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:50:08
okay, if there's something else that pops here, are you available for a little bit yet today?

Matthias Miller  1:50:13
I Well, it depends how much of this stuff you went moving by Monday, so, but I'm right,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:23
which stuff, man,

Matthias Miller  1:50:25
let me go back over the list. We have

Matthias Miller  1:50:32
some of the miscellaneous prep flags.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:38
Oh, you mean sliding that into the cleanup window,

Matthias Miller  1:50:41
yeah, etc.

Speaker 1  1:50:45
I mean, yeah, as soon as that's in the cleanup window, it, yeah. Is that a pretty quick move for you to
