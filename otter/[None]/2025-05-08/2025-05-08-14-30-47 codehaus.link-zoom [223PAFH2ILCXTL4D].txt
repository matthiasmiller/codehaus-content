Matthias Miller  05:12
Oh, here Hang on. Oh, maybe there we go, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  05:17
Let me get let me get Joel on.

Speaker 1  05:52
I have a voicemail from Hostetler that oh two things. Hostetler is deciding to start do inventory management with Paragon paradigm, and they've had a long call with them. They still think they want to send the game somehow. Paragon says they'd love to. I mean, they work with other third parties. They're glad to work with us. I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what the first piece will be. How it'll be, I'm kind of guess suspecting will be on the I mean, it may be fringes, short term, fringes, long term, I just don't know. And it may, it may go all in or and I and it might be that this is actually going to give them exactly what they need. I suspect that they would have spent a lot more with us, and would have gotten something a lot more time and something a lot better,

Matthias Miller  06:50
right? Are you free to join? Yeah.

Speaker 1  06:55
So anyway, that's the update there, but I have a voicemail haven't listened to yet, so got it. Yeah, so just a bit of background. And I mean, I'm not sure, I guess I'm not sure why this wasn't on my radar as the whole RTO question came up, but just as we've been talking about it and the well, and then I think some of these conversations, more details came out from affordable barn. Like, for affordable barn, they'll actually offer, you know, bank style financing through some kind of third party if people have decent credit, and that's at, you know, probably 20, 1015, to 20% something like that, you know? And then, if they don't have, do you know what interest rates for affordable barn charges on? I'll ask doing too, if you don't know, offhand, but

Matthias Miller  07:51
the, I mean, the I mean, if you actualize it to an interest rate, yeah, I think it's in the RTO calculation somewhere.

Speaker 1  08:04
Anyway, industry standards about 40% so it's,

Matthias Miller  08:09
it's probably something like that. So

Speaker 1  08:17
I grew up poor. I know the visceral feeling in a kid's stomach when parents overwhelmed with debt, and we're not responsible for other people's choices, but we're really good at software, and I'm trying to figure out, do do I want to put tools in in lenders hands, to put people into the equivalent of 40% loans?

Matthias Miller  08:42
We're well, there's Okay, possibly, possibly not. Yep, yep. I have like So Richard Miller tells a story. He was dead broke, moved to North Carolina. Yep, he he had, he had a bunch of plumbing tools, put him under a tarp, and that was his livelihood. His dad was a plumber. That's what he was doing to make money. Yep, he had them under a tarp and it rained. Yep, and he lost about he lost a couple $1,000 with the tools, which was a couple $1,000 he didn't have. Yep, and so just like that, he lost his livelihood. Yep, and if he had known about RTO, and I'm not sure at that point if he did know about RTO, or if he did not. My understanding is he didn't. If he had known about RTO, he could have gotten a building for a couple 100 bucks a month and saved his livelihood. And it was literally, it literally would have been the difference between him being able to keep working or not. That's an anecdotal story. The other piece too is that there is no collateral here. So it really is a rental. It's, it's, and this is, this is all a playing devil's advocate, I guess. Sure, I don't know angels advocate. I don't know which it is, and, and there is no obligation. So you. Really can stop saying and, and so that is the that is the flip side, and the flip side is also you're making something accessible to people. And as a side note, there are there. I've heard stories about multi millionaires who've done RTO just because, no, they don't want the credit check and they don't want to do financing, they just don't want the hassle. And don't want the hassle and whatever, like, bizarre from a financial standpoint, but they have sure reasons for doing it. Yeah, Joel, Joel might be better able to rationalize why? Why somebody might, might do that. I don't, I don't really know. And so I think it's probably just ease, like there's no paperwork to fill out. Just like, can we just get it done and get it moving quickly?

Speaker 1  10:48
And maybe, I don't know if I'm going to be at this place five years,

Matthias Miller  10:53
yeah, I don't know Sure, sure. Could be any, any number of those things. But that's, that's all, that's all, but then you're kind of at the mercy of the ethics of the salesperson as well, which is pretty far downstream so. And I think there are people who, I mean, there's a wide variety of sales styles within the shed industry. You have everything from the Grand car down India. Well, I don't know if India, let's wait like this, but, and I don't I, I think a lot of these guys look very, very in my opinion, they look very soft and nice on the surface. But I really think there's some barbs and how they sell that I don't personally agree with. I think you got other people on the other side of the spectrum, like, and I would put Richard Miller in one of those categories where it's, like, when he was selling sets, it was, I'm gonna help people, yeah, yeah. And I'm not gonna scream over. And if selling RTO helps them out, then I sell more to Yep, yeah. So I don't know what are your but you have to, I think if I had to put a nice bow on it, you have to be able to sleep at night with what you do. And that's your decision on your values, yep, yep. So

Unknown Speaker  12:18
the

Speaker 1  12:20
okay and here's, here's a truly evil example that I ran into as a deacon, a perpetually poor person cheerfully said, Well, there's this one bill I can't pay, but I have a a Care Credit program where I can put vet bills and hospital bills and dental bills on this and not have to pay for six months. And I wonder if I should put this other bill on there too, because other options, the church, church stepping in again. And I was like, care, credit, that's interesting. So on and search them, it's a 0% interest for six months and then, bam, 33% retroactive interest. It's a zero. It's your standard 0% credit card, but packaged as if this is a program to help you with your emergency expenses when when you're in crisis. And just as I mean, that gets me riled up. I mean, that's just evil because people are clicking on it. I mean, she clearly, she recognizes that I do need to get it paid in six months. What you know, she's not financially savvy enough to say, Now, what is this? Oh, this is a really expensive credit card, and their goal is to have me not pay it and suddenly be on atrocious interest rates, right? And them preying on these people, pretending to be nice and and and hoping to stab them the back is just, it's just dark. So, and maybe I'm over adjectivizing them or ad firming them, but I don't love it so, and the flip side is, you know, you know, the extreme is payday loans. Some people it might, you know, having that 200 bucks so that they can get their car fixed and not lose their job may be worth it, but you're sucking people into a five to four to 600% interest program. I mean, just unsavory So, and I do think RTO is has its place, and I don't think as a vendor, I need to say, I mean, I'm not sure how much as a vendor I can I mean, I there's just a lot that I can't control. But is there anything that. So I think I have, I've got three options. One of is to convince myself that I've built a morally neutral tool. You know, it's the equivalent to selling computers. Some people use it to save lives, and other people use it for destruction or etc. So that's the one option, is to convince myself this is morally neutral. Is morally neutral or morally positive. Option two is just to walk away say, No, it's let everyone else do what they want to. You know, we'd, we'd, we'd rather. We don't think this is making the world a better place, and we don't. We're not. We think that the net that we're actually enabling people that in to do things that we don't trust Well, and that's and I think what we're not, we're not saying every single person out there, because I I felt fine building RTO for affordable barn. So I think part of my question is, how many people out there that are using this is that the average, I mean, would we feel good about the average client here or not? Perhaps, is maybe part of the question. And option three is to say, oh, we'd love to build tools, if there's ways we can build it that make the world better instead of worse. And I don't know if there's actually a way to do that

Matthias Miller  16:17
kind of the less evil. Like I talked to a guy in Wichita who runs RTO software, yeah. And just, I want to ask around see what he's like, but he's very much seems to be like, the high energy, like, Oh, hey, here's money. Like, we should go make some Yeah. And so part of the answer to that is, I've found that as tried it as it is, birds of a feather really do flock together. And having getting around the Richard Miller's and RTO and the Duane burkholders In RTO and some of the other, I mean, there's another new guy I met in RTO as well, who's fits the vibe like, like, let's go find the let's, let's, let's, let's find the non exploitative people in the industry, and let's come get behind them. And so there is that you're gonna just because of who Dwayne is, his his tolerance for, he has a higher tolerance for, I don't know, shenanigans, than I do Sure.

Unknown Speaker  17:22
Josh said the same thing, but he's still, I mean, he is still, you know, he's still someone that you could hand your house keys to.

Matthias Miller  17:33
So he is, yes, he is. And I think, generally speaking, he's probably not going to attract the worst of the worst. But, sure, but then again, you know that's goes back to, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:53
So I'm curious,

Speaker 1  17:59
so I don't think there's much to explore with the option walk away. I mean, think Josh and I both feel, wait a second, we were the ones that offered him into a high level design. Matthias has done everything he was supposed to do. Okay? Well, two questions. You probably would not wish to build the whole system yourself and just take it, would you? I'd be able to explain that. Okay? So that that could be one possibility.

Matthias Miller  18:23
And I was wondering whether hosting is a, you know, is, you know, there's hosting development, like, Where does the Exactly, exactly live for you?

Unknown Speaker  18:35
Well, clearly, okay, we are not going to host gambling software on our servers, so,

Matthias Miller  18:47
but that project

Speaker 1  18:50
that was the most innocuous bad example I could come up with, right exactly,

Matthias Miller  18:57
or something fair bet. Fair already has fairly strong market saturation, so I'm not quite sure. Get the curve off a smaller slice, I guess. Yeah. So

Speaker 1  19:11
camp like for Amish by facts,

Matthias Miller  19:17
facts, where you get the model of facts, that facts is faster, so that you can get get, you get some time advantage. Oh, there you go.

Speaker 1  19:28
Anyway, so, okay, first of all, I think I think RTO software in general, yeah, if Matthias would say, hey, where I'd like to go all in with Dwayne. We've got to do RTO software. I don't think I feel a lot of I mean, it doesn't feel like it's on the spectrum where I'm doing something wrong. I mean, that I feel is troubling that I'm hosting it. Joel, I'm curious what you say, but I.

Speaker 2  20:00
Yeah, yeah. I mean many shades of gray, yeah, yeah. It feels like it's

Speaker 1  20:11
Yeah, but it does feel that it I feel much more responsibility. If I am the developer making this thing happen, and if I'm this is what I'm actively building.

Unknown Speaker  20:25
So

Speaker 1  20:29
I suppose the next question is, if you say, Well, can I hire your developers to work for me? Then, now we're really into semantics, and maybe all I'm doing is just leaving you the profit. But maybe that's what's the right thing is to do. It

Unknown Speaker  20:48
does feel

Speaker 1  20:53
really different to find the business partner somehow. I don't know why, but it viscerally feels different to find the business partner on, you know, on the software vendor side of things, or the solution provider, sure, and

Speaker 1  21:15
the so that, I think that's one possibility to explore. I'd also, I mean, I'm curious what Josh Well, I don't think Josh is going to say, No, you can't host it on our platform. Josh may say, I feel unclean with this. I don't want my 3% or he might say, oh, you know, Ellis, please donate my 3% to and financial literacy program or something like that. And if he wants to, that's fine. I mean, he could choose not to take his 3% and send it elsewhere, or he could do it himself, sure that would actually look I'm sorry, this is like,

Unknown Speaker  21:50
pause, we

Matthias Miller  21:52
create a bar gig, spin off for that. That was mercenary. I'm sorry, no, I mean

Speaker 1  22:00
the Well, I actually toyed with saying, Dwayne, you're a person of integrity. This industry is not known for that. What if you double down and make that your brand? You know, professional, ethical, profitable, RTO, right? That's actually kind of interesting.

Matthias Miller  22:24
Well, do you mean RTO the RTO industry, the shed industry? How far are we drawing the line here? Yeah,

Speaker 1  22:35
so now in the shed industry, what percentage of shed builders are minnow? Do you have any sense?

Matthias Miller  22:42
I don't have a good sense, really.

Speaker 1  22:43
Do you think would you, would you put the ethics levels among Meadows pretty different than other shed builders? Or

Matthias Miller  22:52
is it pretty broad spectrum on both sides? I think it's pretty broad spectrum, is my understanding. I'm sorry. I think I've been looking for needles in haystacks, basically,

Unknown Speaker  23:03
yeah, and,

Matthias Miller  23:07
yeah, yeah. Anyway, I don't have much to say. But, I mean, there's a reason why I work well with Ohio and other districts and and it's, you know, it goes both ways, so mistakes, but yeah, there's other stuff where starting from scratch. And I'm not the only one who's experienced these things. So yeah, outside of Dwayne so and this stuff came up spontaneously, not that I was trying to dig up dirt on people, but sure, yeah, so it is. Ethics is, is an issue, yeah, ethics and good leadership is an issue within the industry, in my opinion, yep.

Speaker 1  23:47
But Dwayne, if Dwayne would brand himself as that, then the Do you think he limits his I mean, it harms his art, his RTO sales? No, no. Because he gets, he gets his, I would think he gets his kind of people, and then that's exactly what he wants to have, I mean, and that's

Matthias Miller  24:02
who you want to those are the best clients in the world. Like, why would you want to do business with a bunch of jerks? Exactly? I mean, little anecdotal. I've got this little side project that I'm like, on the fence of, yeah, breaks even in 30 days. Yeah, but it's a headache and a half, and it shows potential. But like, the guy checks every box except for he's a little bit green and hasn't had to, kind of has to step up his game a little bit, yeah, like, and he told me he's, like, I've tried all kinds of stuff. Like, this is the closest thing to ever working like, in its culture. Like i He said, How many people rip them off? And so there is a, I just think it's a, I mean, okay, insert little rant, yeah, in the world of AI, yeah, culture is a moat, and culture is going to last for 200 years, and you can't fake culture. So,

Unknown Speaker  24:59
um. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  25:01
you know, you have to check the boxes on everything else, like you have to have a competitive product and all this other kind of stuff, but, but I think the people who are a grade quality people are dying to work with people who are a great quality people. I think culture is one of the things that makes Hostetler so hard. Makes it so hard for them to say

Unknown Speaker  25:22
no to us. I think you're right.

Unknown Speaker  25:26
I think you're right.

Speaker 1  25:30
Okay, well, this is super helpful. And I think there may be, I think it's just, I think I'm just going to wait and I are talking tomorrow. I think we're just going in with a just a, let's start. Let's explore conversation. I'd like to hear what your vision is here, and what kinds of people you're hoping to work with, what that looks like, and not in any way projecting values, just saying, you know, here's here are things that I'm wrestling with, and here's different possibilities of how it could happen. And just have a conversation. I think it's fair. Okay, very good. I um, the um, oh, how quick question on Strausberg, I'm sorry about the rates thing. How should would it be helpful for you if we would hold lower rates for them for a few months?

Matthias Miller  26:43
Echo, echo, we just signed a one year. So that's no

Unknown Speaker  26:46
but echo is not, it's not hosted. This is hosted.

Matthias Miller  26:50
Echo is a test system. Okay, well, so,

Speaker 1  26:58
well, I mean, if it's, if it's if it's a $10 difference, I can, I'm glad to refund. I mean, cover $10 out of my own pocket.

Matthias Miller  27:06
I don't, I don't know where. I mean, okay, so echo does have, have some profit margin built in Strasburg did communicate pricing. It's really, I don't know, sitting from where I say, it would be nice to have a bigger heads up saying, hey, price hikes are coming.

Speaker 1  27:31
Totally fair. Yeah, and on the Yeah, totally fair.

Matthias Miller  27:37
So I don't know. I don't know what the appropriate I don't know what the appropriate thing is on. I don't know. I don't know what

Matthias Miller  27:51
week I'm planning to, as soon as we get this live, planning to charge them in an annual maintenance Sure, bring some cash in. I forgot to include pricing for the test. That's my fault, but it does affect me Sure, having a an event like,

Matthias Miller  28:16
yeah, yeah, anyway, I don't know, yeah, just

Speaker 1  28:19
I forgot about your test systems, and I was, you know, I had the, the the non hosted systems on my radar, but I, I didn't have Strasburg on my radar. Sure why, and didn't know about it. So the when do you think they're going live? Do you have any sense on that? We

Matthias Miller  28:42
were hoping in the next week or two? But okay, it's been one fiasco after another.

Speaker 1  28:47
Sure, and you have, you've communicated to them the the 5010, yes, pricing. How many users do you think they'll have? They're at six right now.

Matthias Miller  28:58
It's like, yeah. I mean, they're not going to be adding, okay, adding things. I mean, they're not gonna be adding quickly. I don't think, okay,

Speaker 1  29:09
yeah, let me talk to Josh and let me see what we can do for you. I think we can do something and the

Speaker 3  29:20
i Yeah. And

Speaker 1  29:24
I would say on your, on your, I mean, I don't, I don't mind doing an internal transfer on the two test systems until through the end of the year or something. So I

Matthias Miller  29:35
don't feel, I feel less strongly about nhm. Mostly, any ship is paying for it. I don't mind communicating to them that we have a small price hike. I think

Speaker 1  29:45
it's very got it. So that one there is going directly to them. So it's going directly to them.

Matthias Miller  29:52
Yep. And and then echo is, is done on an annual basis. And if you need to, I. If we need to, I think I would rather next year roll in a bigger I would even be open to doing a slightly bigger price hike and feeding a certain number of months back to you, or I guess I could do that same thing, but

Speaker 1  30:27
yeah, well, it's just not that big a deal. The let me do a four, 125, I'll chase that one.

Unknown Speaker  30:56
Okay, yes,

Unknown Speaker  31:21
the

Speaker 1  31:32
and I'll, I'll do this, I mean, I'll do the Same thing on your test system as well. And

Matthias Miller  31:42
you CMM, yeah, I and I don't feel as strong as that on that as happy to I'm not going to turn down, yeah, well, I think that

Speaker 1  32:00
answers my question. Okay, let me go ahead and fix, I mean, pull up straws. I'll fix it offline here. But I think the now as and as far as rates go now, let me think this, this through, yeah, no, it's fine. The going forward, we do the 10. I mean, Josh's rates are 10 or $15 for 10 users and $10 and $5 and then eventually it goes even below that. But then he splits a 5050, with a provider. So,

Unknown Speaker  32:45
so just want to make sure

Matthias Miller  32:51
and user fees. So I had actually had $150 per month for the first five users for Strasburg, for Strasburg. And so that's probably enough to cover test system and or no,

Matthias Miller  33:18
what is the base that you're doing

Speaker 1  33:20
now? Basis 75 I mean, it covers, it's not, it's not plush, it's covers it and spaces. It's 75 plus 35 that's 110

Matthias Miller  33:31
and so typically, but you, typically, you would be, that is, that is the recommended retail value. That is a recommended

Speaker 1  33:39
we are, and we are just bumping that one now to to 151 75 is the recommended reach. I mean, with this April pricing, we're bumping the recommended retail to 175

Matthias Miller  33:53
so that $25 short, yeah, 12 and a half, 12 and a half short,

Speaker 1  33:58
sure. Yeah. So, and some of mine, I ended up because they, well, I did a bit of custom pricing to start getting because I had some people still stock back at the $100 a month. And so the 150 a month. And so I some of the people that were already at 150 I took up to 175 the people that were at 100

Unknown Speaker  34:22
some of them, I gave a, you know, a temporary discount, and, and then, you know, you know, For a year or something like that.

Speaker 1  34:34
But the i Uh, but yeah, earlier you would have had 70 150 you would have had the you would have had $75 left, although, and interestingly, if he wants with these increases, you're actually down $10 I mean, if you use our. Adjusted rates, you're down $10 a margin. Even at 175 you're down to $65 margin. So 75

Matthias Miller  35:08
because of the test system, because of the test system.

Unknown Speaker  35:14
So

Speaker 1  35:16
now are but you're charging just the 50 until the system goes live. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  35:22
I have not. I don't know what I'm charging until it goes live. I'm like some of the out of pocket too, sure or not, but it's probably

Speaker 1  35:35
the invoice is scheduled to go out to them in for the first month in although we do sometimes wave up to a first month it looks like they're they've been live for about a month. We do sometimes wave the up to a month free as they're launching. So that would be

Matthias Miller  35:56
we could also,

Speaker 1  35:57
although I could let you drop, actually, I think we're okay. Yeah. Thank you. So I'm going to propose that Josh has given us leeway to weigh the first month of hosting, and it sounds up to a month of hosting. And so if they went live on, if they're four, three, and you're still trying to take them live, then that's, I think, what I would what I would do, sure, so let me find Strasburg here

Unknown Speaker  36:27
pallet test. That means that we need to avoid the draft invoice. Yeah,

Speaker 1  36:36
I'm in there right now on the draft invoice, I I'm

Speaker 1  36:47
actually, I'm going to be right rerunning invoices. I think, because I'm going to be, I'm going to, I'm trying to get the the tier pricing actually happening automatically, instead of, because we're taking a whole bunch of people to tiered and I'd like to have that happen automatically instead of doing it manually every time. Yep, so So if I would just Strasburg, I'm going to edit theirs here. So we're going to say that the base cost is free, and I'm going to say initial

Speaker 3  37:26
launch and no charge.

Speaker 1  37:33
And that goes till 430, 25,

Unknown Speaker  37:40
and then we add a new one.

Speaker 1  37:51
And do you, do you feel comfortable charging them 150 from this month? Or should we with you taking part of that? Or do you want to adjust there?

Unknown Speaker  38:06
Yeah. I mean, I think it's fine.

Unknown Speaker  38:10
But you've, you've quoted them at $10 per user, right?

Matthias Miller  38:14
It was, it was here, hang on. I'm pretty sure it was, it

Unknown Speaker  38:19
was probably the 1510 five. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:23
it was a 1510 five.

Speaker 1  38:24
Okay, so you'll get seven and a half dollars a month there. Okay, so then down here, sales, item,

Unknown Speaker  38:37
hosting, subscription,

Unknown Speaker  38:45
and so this one is minus 75 Yes, from five 125 invoice by Josh, paid to paid by

Unknown Speaker  39:07
code house I

Unknown Speaker  39:20
let me just share my screen quickly.

Speaker 1  39:38
So here so from from the next invoice. So we've got the initial launch at no charge. Next invoice, we'll bill them for 150 and then minus 75 by Josh, which goes to code house

Unknown Speaker  39:59
train. For 75 to ch

Speaker 1  40:07
and then, then, I think we just need to add, I mean, but that still leaves you $35 short per month because of

Speaker 1  40:33
I'd be comfortable how big a project is it that you're doing for them? It's

Matthias Miller  40:40
probably going to end up being 20 to 80. I don't really get that. It's a big ballpark, but I don't know exactly what's going to be. I'm not I'm also not opposed to is a little janky, but we're not using the test system. I'm not entirely opposed just taking it down. Why don't we just do that? Sure that'll

Unknown Speaker  40:59
take care of it right there. And I'm just going to, I'm going to avoid this invoice here. Canceled.

Matthias Miller  41:12
That does it? Okay? I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:23
oh, let's do it to 430, 25,

Matthias Miller  41:35
okay,

Unknown Speaker  41:39
let me just shoot Josh a message. Josh,

Matthias Miller  41:50
we're disabling the zpa test system in case you get alerts. So words,

Unknown Speaker  42:13
the test CPA system, to

Speaker 1  42:14
be clear, yes, I said the zpa test, and then I include the word Strasbourg palette test. Okay,

Matthias Miller  42:22
and then test in each Okay, so, so that takes care of that. Echo, nhm,

Speaker 1  42:29
so. Nhm, do you want to shoot Shall I? Shall we shoot them an email?

Matthias Miller  42:33
I don't mind. Can we make it effective? June 1? Sure, sure. I mean, yeah, let's just do that. Did you have an effective date?

Speaker 1  42:43
Let me find that one test. Nhm,

Matthias Miller  42:50
yeah, so let's do this. This is 531 this is six one. On, starting, starting later. Heads up. Effective June 1. Since this is build retro actively, this will be reflected for July in voice Correct, yes, I

Unknown Speaker  43:45
So,

Unknown Speaker  43:54
okay,

Unknown Speaker  44:02
okay,

Speaker 1  44:04
and then the other one is echo test. And let's what we will do

Unknown Speaker  44:13
is,

Unknown Speaker  44:19
did you enter this. I already,

Speaker 1  44:26
I might have already done this for you. Okay, that's okay, fine, yeah, I must echo is good till the end of the year. It echoes good to the end through the end of the year.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
So good. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  44:48
okay, and I guess, I

Unknown Speaker  44:54
guess I.

Unknown Speaker  45:07
Make a note in the template, sure system I

Speaker 1  45:37
a bit of a marketing note that my Rosewood came in with a last year we had been a, I think they were at like a $45,000 budget with 10% Oh, I mean 10% contingency, which they used up. So it was about 50,000 this year they came to me with an like a $75,000 budget plus, well, plus some online ads that came out to 80,000 and I just had a mild heart attack there on the phone. And I'm sorry I'm tight on cash flow. I can't do this. And, and so we basically cut back to complete bear. I'm basically keep the newsletters going, stuff like that. And we're doing a they're keeping the higher level coaching, which is fruitful stuff, because that's good time with with those guys. And and we're back down to $40,000 plus 10% contingency and and I think we're going to, we included one sale a cell sheet that I want, and I said, you know, if things are going well, we'll add more. And they were, they were pretty understanding, and I think it was, but I just saved myself about three, $3,000 a month of cash flow, right there. Now, art, the return on investment is a great question, but just I need to have cash anyway, you got to prove it at

Matthias Miller  47:11
some point exactly.

Speaker 1  47:14
And the I we talked about taking some things. Okay, one thing I think we will do, if we do further newsletters and stuff, I'm going to have Nick do the editing at, you know, 50 bucks an hour, instead of having them do the editing at their rate just went up 270 an hour, which is totally fine for Ed. I have no problem with that. But Nathan and their secretary Terry, when they're ordering gifts for me,

Matthias Miller  47:48
yeah, that doesn't work.

Speaker 1  47:51
So so one thing I decided, I can source my own gifts. Thank you very much. And I mean, so, so and I think it's a fair call. I mean, should I be bringing all of the I mean, if I'd really want to, I could bring the whole news, I mean, the whole newsletter publication, because he went through it. It's about four hours a month so we had spent an hour copywriting is not going to do that anymore, and then an hour finding pictures, pasting it in, getting the bold where they want it and stuff. Now, Nick won't want to do that, and I don't think I want Nick to do that, and then getting it on the uploaded to the website and and when new subscribers come, make sure they're they it's manually send them an email. Now, that kind of thing I could do with pen at 35 so but then it does, you know, and they said, what I mean, they're glad to let me take stuff over. Where they're hesitant is if that's if it chops up their commitments, where, you know, it actually makes it harder for them to be, I mean, to be, which, I think is fair. I'm just curious if you have thoughts off hand, like $3 an hour at 170 Okay, should I have them figure it, find the images and send the email? I'm guessing it often ties in with what they're doing, okay. But the other thing is, when, when he's doing that, he's also it often ties into the copy that they use for the ad, which I'm fine. I've been happy with what's happening there. They've been doing a good job with that. So I kind of feel like having them produce the email actually does make sense.

Matthias Miller  49:42
I think there's a line between EA slash ba slash agency, where, if you had the right EA, who was skilled, yeah, some of that stuff could make sense, but right, I just don't think you want to exactly. Want, yeah, you don't want to think about is Benjamin,

Speaker 1  50:01
yeah, yeah, exactly. So that's so but, but I did say, I mean, having Nick will do a totally fine job for editing. I don't have to spend money to have Nathan spend another hour pouring over verbs. Yeah, for sure. That makes total sense to me. But then I so it sounds like we're kind of together on the rest of it. Fine. I mean, it's not cheap, but getting the news the email newsletter, maintain having email. I mean, having a weekly, a monthly email go out and maintaining the list and stuff for 500 bucks a month, and that's reason it says it's actually less than 500 now it's 400 or something that's for that's reasonable So and, and I told him that I just love working with you all. You all are so good. And I know that there's that, there's in growing companies. There's a scarcity of the really good people, but I feel like I'm dramatically overpaying for for some people in order to get your access to you. All right, I don't think they can. I mean, I don't think they did try to push back too hard. I'm pretty sure they'll take that feedback back to Roy and other people and say, Ah, you know it's leaking. Our challenges are leaking. Yep. So anyway,

Matthias Miller  51:29
do you know still side note, do you know where the phone number routes to right now?

Speaker 1  51:38
I mean, it should be routing to what's his face there in Kenya?

Matthias Miller  51:50
Desk phone line. I'm just trying

Matthias Miller  52:01
to find the office settings users. I'm not showing a user license for him. It would be on our account nowadays, isn't it? Oh, you moved it to your account? Yeah, yeah, okay, got it. So I just tried to call just because why not? Yeah, no answer.

Unknown Speaker  52:25
That's terrifying. Do you know that's very

Matthias Miller  52:28
expensive, like try calling him again. Do you have login access to the account or to the admin? Let me check this. This is your mystery shopper.

Unknown Speaker  52:51
It's terrible. I

Unknown Speaker  53:03
10 bucks. They dropped the ball. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  53:13
this is Matt calling.

Matthias Miller  53:16
I was trying to get a hold of somebody over at Cook craft or sped a custom project. Can you give me a call back? 719-458-1650, thanks. Amber knows it's me if she gets it, but

Unknown Speaker  53:32
sure to share your screen.

Speaker 1  53:37
Sure, sure. And I'm not sure if I admit or not, but

Matthias Miller  53:51
if you go on The left, there's a history. Yeah, there we go. So then do a change to members to no

Unknown Speaker  54:13
Call participant, maybe

Matthias Miller  54:20
is the receptionist in there?

Matthias Miller  54:42
Unbelievable. There's been no connected calls. Um, it changed the date range. Let's see when the last connected call was.

Unknown Speaker  54:52
Unbelievable,

Matthias Miller  54:55
365, as far as it goes. And do the you could actually. Filter by conversation type and see just filter by

Unknown Speaker  55:05
now,

Speaker 1  55:08
duration, more filters. Anything that went took over a minute, sure. Feb 27 that's

Matthias Miller  55:21
you got some voicemails to catch up on?

Unknown Speaker  55:23
I can

Matthias Miller  55:30
you turn it to 363 65

Unknown Speaker  55:42
that's Still,

Speaker 3  55:57
yeah, folks, we got trouble that is, oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  56:03
gut wrenching. Why be light?

Speaker 1  56:13
Steph Steven Zimmerman, so here died,

Matthias Miller  56:18
just go back. Go back 100 go You didn't select the 365,

Unknown Speaker  56:26
and hit Apply. And let's see if I

Matthias Miller  56:34
mean the real question you really want to change it to one to seven, and see if you have anything on the last year for one to seven, the other question would be, the other question would be, this would probably be a very easy tell

Matthias Miller  56:52
from receptionist that November 23 that's the last email from the receptionist.

Speaker 1  57:03
Let me see with what I have. Though. Okay, so here you have bond tracker Steele calling for seven minutes. Did they connect with no, that was the receptionist. That's these are all from June to June 24

Matthias Miller  57:19
to when there's a month in June.

Unknown Speaker  57:24
So in June they were,

Unknown Speaker  57:34
I mean, unbelievable.

Speaker 1  57:42
So surely there should be some way that you can more filters,

Unknown Speaker  57:51
dispositions,

Matthias Miller  57:54
maybe those are, maybe not. I

Speaker 1  58:04
There you go unanswered and voicemail, right?

Unknown Speaker  58:09
Yeah, and no minutes,

Speaker 1  58:18
and some of these antonet car that's generational I know about already, that's spam, but we have 120 missed calls. Well, we're changing that. That's coming to code drafters now, that was easy.

Matthias Miller  58:35
Ben, Ben, you always wanted something do with it. Oh, my goodness, you should, actually, you should still send a, well, I don't know. I don't know. Maybe not. I know. You probably shouldn't do what. There's you could just shoot an email to Amber. It's not really worth it, honestly, like I've decided I'm not doing business with them again, and and there's nothing they could do about it. What have we been paying them for a month? Have you been paying them?

Unknown Speaker  59:09
I think so. I mean, I think I'll ask for a refund of that.

Matthias Miller  59:13
Yeah. I would refund for everything except June. Yeah, I totally would.

Unknown Speaker  59:20
Can I can that services?

Unknown Speaker  59:24
Surely,

Matthias Miller  59:28
what's a little gut wrenching is, well, I guess you go into the receptionist email address, email account and look for voicemails older than that, see if you can, or maybe even in that account you can go back there might even be further than a year, if, November was, when they,

Speaker 1  59:43
when they Okay. Sam Jose is likely not legit. 7247, those are 717. Machine Shop. Machine Shop. These people are trying to really drive.

Unknown Speaker  59:54
Oh, Jesus. 120

Speaker 1  59:58
and these are not a bunch of this. Spam, some same numbers.

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
We don't care if they're spam, 10 leads, and that's right there. I

Speaker 1  1:00:07
mean, this might have made me feel like Rosewood was doing a better job

Matthias Miller  1:00:12
well. I mean, yeah, all right. I think here's, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:00:18
I just, I just solved my marketing problems I did. I just paid for all my calls for you. I think, I think you're probably right, unbelievable. Well, I should have trouble. Shot it. Shooted that one sooner. So the first thing we need to do is even without saying anything, I can just start Rerouting. Do you know how I can reroute this thing to reception? You into settings,

Matthias Miller  1:00:52
departments, I think

Matthias Miller  1:01:00
go to go to mainline,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
Assigned Operators and phones,

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
said, Tim or add Ben do

Matthias Miller  1:01:24
and let's go ahead and remove this guy, and you probably disable his user license, and we should still be able to search for, I mean, yes, for, for Ben, he'll be able to or, what do You

Speaker 1  1:01:41
mean search for? I mean, we can still see all his calls, even if he's disabled. I'm sure, right?

Matthias Miller  1:01:47
Yes, unless he made calls directly from his own and unless he has a separate line he made calls from that. I'm not too worried about that. Now,

Speaker 1  1:01:55
where is the main Go ahead, let's, let's get everything exported before we disable him. It's 10, you know, it's 10 bucks or whatever. To disable him. To

Matthias Miller  1:02:02
disable him. Yeah, no, let's or let's even, even wait a few months, but, yeah, exactly,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
totally.

Speaker 1  1:02:12
Well, Ben's gonna be busy here. He's got plenty to do. Um, now I could even, actually, I could have Sean go back through say, Hey, I'm sorry. We've We've noticed that we've missed some calls. You know, come up with a script say that we had an answering service that was not following up on calls that, and we didn't. We just found out and notice that you had called about custom software. Is there anything we can do for you.

Matthias Miller  1:02:41
Here's what I would do. I would okay if, if I had my druthers, yeah, I would put Ben on it. Ben's got way better people skills. And I would just say absolutely, Can Can I, just as an apology, something like, Can I set up a, just a reappointment with Alice? Yeah, yeah. And like, we're so sorry, and we understand if you moved on, but yeah, I'd be happy to step in appointment with Alice. Wow,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
unbelievable. How

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
much are you paying? Five was it? What was it? 500 a month. 250

Speaker 1  1:03:13
for is cheap. Okay, let me see if Jules here right now he's not take A one minute break and be back.

Matthias Miller  1:03:23
Okay, right on

Unknown Speaker  1:05:58
Come back. I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
Well, well, well,

Speaker 1  1:06:07
I don't know. Well, I think God has spoken fairly clearly that we want to take calling into our own shop. I think

Matthias Miller  1:06:16
that's I think that's very clear. I think it's very clear.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
Code crafters, receptionist,

Matthias Miller  1:06:40
this is slightly vindictive and a little ego driven, but considering that I got rent invoice six months after I was out of the building, it feels kind of good to have things flowing the other way.

Speaker 1  1:06:55
Code crafters, exceptionist. Now the the main line, let's make sure that I've got the main line. Let me

Matthias Miller  1:07:01
try. Is Ben still. He's not he's out, though. Well, he

Speaker 1  1:07:05
might be out, but you can let me just ping him and say that. Well, you can try. I mean, you might still get voicemail, but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:17
what happens?

Matthias Miller  1:07:22
Either? Way, you should see on your logs that it got. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:28
by the way,

Matthias Miller  1:07:30
we just discovered

Speaker 1  1:07:34
that the CCI receptionist has not been picking up phone calls. We have a lot for months. Have a lot of work to do to clean up the mess. Ben, we have moved

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
the main line. This is advice. You should theoretically get this message. If you do, you can let Ellis I know. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
Oh, wow. I

Matthias Miller  1:08:24
Yeah, you're right. It is, it is cheap, it is it is a wait. Is there no retainer at all? Though,

Speaker 1  1:08:32
I think we paid some kind of retainer 20.

Matthias Miller  1:08:38
I'm seeing $25 a month on my invoices. But

Speaker 1  1:08:44
I think it was something like it was some it was ridiculously low. I mean, it was low enough that was like, oh, that's fine, but that's only if, if they actually pick up the

Matthias Miller  1:08:53
phone, another 400 bucks back to your 300 bucks back to you.

Speaker 2  1:09:02
And Yikes.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:14
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21
so mainline info,

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
okay, but why didn't this not get caught in the in the KPIs?

Speaker 1  1:09:29
It's my fault. I've told them. It just feels like we're not getting leads recently, but we did, yeah, so we

Matthias Miller  1:09:39
haven't been doing our because they put together fancy APIs. They're like, want to keep track of this that just

Speaker 1  1:09:44
No, I said we haven't gotten calls this month. Okay, but tell us Hello.

Matthias Miller  1:09:52
Okay, good luck. You

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
know how many mistakes I've made in life when. Eyes, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:10:01
well, my wife once told me I basically made every mistake in the book. So there's plenty, plenty to go around. Oh, well, this is exciting.

Speaker 1  1:10:15
This is exciting. So I we could set up call hours, and I could ask him about that, but right, you could, yeah, but for now, this gets us going, and

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
I just

Speaker 1  1:10:36
Well, he won't get any calls anymore now, except for spam to so. So that was on the history thing that I found those

Matthias Miller  1:10:52
that's 365 days Apply Filter by code crafters USA, either because that might exclude some spam. No, it is all that. I mean, it is even spam. Is that? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:11:12
so and then. And then I do more filters. And it was, was it

Speaker 3  1:11:23
call category? Yeah, inbound,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
unanswered and voicemail

Unknown Speaker  1:11:37
apply,

Matthias Miller  1:11:40
right? But you shouldn't see that much of a drop two pages is still a lot of drop for that. Because there were, there were only three. We only saw three live calls.

Speaker 1  1:11:50
Okay, so let's, let's go back to that 119, to 153, okay, well, let's see what else It is then call categories. Answered,

Matthias Miller  1:12:08
messenger, spam,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:16
outbound,

Matthias Miller  1:12:22
a Okay, here they all are.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:28
Some of these were

Speaker 1  1:12:33
mask called, so it's here. Tim called and actually got them.

Matthias Miller  1:12:44
February. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:12:45
we had Tim test, I think I told him to, and he checked October,

Matthias Miller  1:12:53
but so we're not clear whether anything happened after March, March, April, May,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
Summer, August, but we

Matthias Miller  1:13:03
didn't get an email for the last how many months? That's the crazy thing,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
well, but I wonder if you did, but I might have,

Matthias Miller  1:13:11
oh, maybe I did the wrong that's when you receptionist. I probably don't have the let me see what it is, because that would have been

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
diligent about that. February 120, 24 oops,

Speaker 1  1:13:41
um, 626, was the last one. Is

Matthias Miller  1:13:52
there any way to see if Evan is still well, that's interesting. I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:07
right, okay, but somebody answered when Tim called, right, and so in October, September, Willard mast, Jason King rich, so I wonder, I don't know for sure how we got these calls here. Okay, let me see if I can copy these into

Unknown Speaker  1:14:42
a Excel or Word,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:49
yeah, they copied Excel, just great,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:53
minus some kind of

Speaker 1  1:14:59
well. I mean, great enough. So that's that one.

Speaker 3  1:15:11
Do you recognize these? Some of these? Yeah, okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:15:36
Okay, let's actually try something else.

Speaker 1  1:15:40
Well, I can chase this separately. I don't have to pay you to watch me copy and paste stuff. The Good, well, well, so somehow, when, okay, I think I had a I'm not sure why I wasn't picking up some of these in my searches, but

Speaker 1  1:16:06
good was ice. I was searching by length or something, and now here, unanswered and voicemail I'm worried about apply. And there's 119 that we want to chase as recently as me. That's still as recently as may 6, seven, once that's my client. I mean, 717,

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
here, let's do a caller ID. Look up 717? What's the number? Sorry, 4423191,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:54
forest Ridgeline.

Matthias Miller  1:16:56
Has it? Forest ridge? Lawn, I just know

Speaker 1  1:17:01
that 717, that 717, numbers make me smile. It's, it's Lancaster,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:04
ish, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:09
March, 27 March, 27 forest

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
Ridge, woodworking, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
unbelievable. I

Matthias Miller  1:17:23
it's also really bad for Jim getting any emails

Speaker 1  1:17:25
120 missed calls in the last nine months from the receptionist, including Lancaster County, quite a number and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:41
Anyway, Joel still sitting over there, giggling

Matthias Miller  1:17:48
or something like that. So they like it.

Speaker 1  1:17:55
At least we have the logs. Yeah, so fantasy, while back. Well, okay, Matthias, I think you told me, are they or or rose would sit? I mean, it's receptionist answering the phone, and so that's where I said, Hey Tim, could you check this out? Tim called, and that time it worked,

Matthias Miller  1:18:15
right? But, but we haven't been, but we haven't been getting emails is, do you have any admin way to view their sent emails, like, have they been trying to send?

Speaker 1  1:18:28
That's a fair question. Joel, can you see individual users, email address, email inbox, or email folders and stuff?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:42
Reception? Receptionist is what we're wondering about.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:49
Well, we also just do it for Seth, I'm just kidding.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:56
Sorry that he fairly boring. But hey, I

Speaker 1  1:19:13
Well, I guess we could reset the password and log in as a person, but I

Speaker 1  1:19:44
Erica, mailbox, delegation or something. Login to exchange, recipient mailboxes do.

Speaker 1  1:20:02
Anyway we can. We'll chase that then, yeah. Question is, has he been sending emails for anything, although, and I'd have to go back and look, because some of those answered calls, I kind of think, well, I wonder if they were, if he was reaching out to, he was reaching out to Ben directly, or something like that. Because, I mean, I some of those names do feel from, oh, well, I'll chase it with Ben. Some of those names do feel really familiar, right? So, oh, Wowsers, well, I think we just solved our some of our biggest marketing problems.

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
Good. Well, that's what these calls are for solving the biggest marketing problems

Speaker 1  1:20:57
and sales the the unbelievable. Well, Ben is might just be making himself very valuable. Yeah, I do think the more I could we can get him into sales, the better. So he is not a he is. He

Matthias Miller  1:21:19
does not think of himself as a natural salesperson. But if you think of him as a go build relationships, yeah, with people, and that's actually the kind of sales person I think you want with this exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:30
I mean, it's not the kind of company we are. I mean, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:21:33
yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Wow, wow, wow.

Speaker 1  1:21:41
Well, that was very, very soon, but I'm kind of glad I've already chewed rose. I mean, not chewed. I'm glad I said the tone for rosewood, where I have and we can go from there. I did just hear the voicemail from Hostetler, and they're saying, oh, we'd like to talk about a proposal. Proposal builder. You know, that's the kind of thing we like talking about. That's more fun than inventory.

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
Oh, yeah, exactly, sweet.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:09
So, yeah, anyway.

Speaker 1  1:22:20
Okay, 510 minutes on with with investor tools, we're landing there Monday noon, and we actually have, I think, two hours or so just to Splunk around before we actually have a meeting with CS managers about the projects, I'm okay. Project management is a pain point. Just general, keeping on top of stuff as a pain point. I think they have some specific things that they're wanting. I don't know if those are the things that they're needing the but one of the things they asked for is, you know, please come to an on site visit. I mean, pretend to an on site visit for us, like we do on sites for our clients, because then we get, because when we go on site, we get to see what they're doing and understand better what their real pains are. So I'm kind of going in as much as possible with that mindset, hey, I'm just going to start. I'm going to, I'll ask questions too, but I'd like to just do, have us do a bunch of watching, and then, and then also interviewing and things, um, so,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:28
um,

Speaker 1  1:23:31
what would I mean if we'd spew out a few interview questions? I mean, should we spew out some interview questions from various people, and is a question really about software or just more about their job?

Matthias Miller  1:23:51
Well, so I have a few opinions about that. Yeah, I think it's very easy for people to talk about. What's easy for people to talk about. It's easy for them. Some of my best marketing copy, including stuff you got for your stuff came over the equivalent of a beer, except it was, you know, a coffee, but whatever, like, that's the people loved, love and need places to vent and without creating a negative culture. But alright, what's what's bothering you, what's bugging you, what's the hassle? What do you wish change like and, and most people don't know. Well, I mean, you have the rainy sources for like the Apple idealists who have hand wavy ideas that are almost possible to implement it because you can't nail it down. Yeah, but, but then you have the David garage, who, who have some ideas, but I think, I think just going in and saying, Look, we're not looking to, we're not looking for client scope enhancements. We're just looking at what makes your life difficult. And then we're going to, we are going to evaluate, because this is our job, right? I mean, sure, if you have ideas of tools, great, but we are going to evaluate what. The best way to solve this problem, and which ones, which problems? Again, it's the ROI question, which problems solve give them as business value with a minimum amount of effort? Yeah, yeah, for appropriate levels of effort, yeah. And so I'm going to suspect that some of your best Well, yeah, I don't know. And then there's questions. You want to do this in group setting? It's definitely not everything in that, right, right?

Speaker 1  1:25:37
I would think I've quite a bit not in a group setting. Quite frankly.

Matthias Miller  1:25:45
So like Melvin, okay, so then there's also the question, I feel like you would be a great interviewer for those types of questions. Yeah, yeah. So if you want to divide and conquer, so it's Seth and who else is going to be there? Jonathan. Jonathan, okay, so since Seth and Jonathan off, I mean, I think there's opportunity for you guys to divide and conquer if you want to Sure. The question is, what are the if you had to have an interview style that fit Seth like a glove, and he would just knock it out of the park, like, what would that look like

Speaker 1  1:26:19
for Seth, you said, Yeah, I think for Seth the one of the best, I think just saying, it's just saying, hey, having him just literally trail people for a while and making ops. I mean, you know, making notes and observations and asking questions when he wants to, maybe even Jonathan too. But maybe we should just let them, I mean, not have them do lots of, I mean, they can ask questions if they want to, but if I do the more the interviewing and and I want to shadow some too, I have done this is fantastic. You can decide later whether you were glad that you invited me to dive bomber,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:05
but, but it's, it's, it's really interesting. Just so sorry I can't have you join us for several days. That

Matthias Miller  1:27:12
would have been an absolute last, like, the worst timing, like, I know, ways, anyway, anyway. So but then I like that a lot,

Speaker 1  1:27:29
yeah, yeah, well, and I kind of think, Okay, what I really think is their lives, okay, two things, their lives are wild, chaos of many things, and it's basically just what screens the loudest, so basic triaging. And here are and cockpit kinds of reports that say, Hey, this is, this is what you should be working on with some kind of prioritization queue, because I think there's 1000s of open incidents right now, probably a bunch of those need to be triaged and just dropped and whatever.

Matthias Miller  1:28:06
There's plenty of room for automatic, well, okay, this is really annoying, but go high level has a we'll close it automatically in two days. But like, there could be an automatic de escalation process, de escalation in closing.

Speaker 1  1:28:19
I mean, maybe, yeah, actually, and you might have, there might be a way to opt something out of that, but by default it's going to just de escalate on you.

Matthias Miller  1:28:27
Well, I mean, and I think it's opt out, I think, I think it's keeps around for X number of days,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:31
sure, sure, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:28:37
just, we've done a really simple one. We're just aware follow up date, and all it does is it clears a priority once it hits a follow up date and adds a comment to the memo. But it's remarkable for product changes. It's remarkably effective, right? So

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
I like it.

Speaker 1  1:28:54
That was Mark Boyers, brilliant brainchild. Brandon also has like a deprioritizer, doesn't he? No Mark Boyer used to, and then I think he's in trouble for it. I mean, I think for development Q, it's just it's not right. I mean, I don't think it's the right thing for development Q, but for client, client facing stuff, I kind of think it might be,

Matthias Miller  1:29:16
yeah, there's stuff, like categorizing stuff, like certain, certain types of incidents. Yeah, sure.

Speaker 1  1:29:27
Okay. The other thing that I think, and we will be solving this problem soon, I think, is that they spend an inordinate amount of time doing free component writing for people. And we don't know for sure if it's 25% or 50% or what it is. So the but, but that's going, there's there are structural things changing that that are going to take care of that issue. So. So customer service has become, going to become customer service so, so I'm just interviewing CRMs. Maybe sometime I'm thinking more often than more skilled ones, but I'll probably do a few really Junior ones,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:19
and asking questions, but I'm curious. Okay, let me I'm curious. Do your thoughts offhand on what questions you would ask,

Matthias Miller  1:30:41
not besides the questions I did ask, and I also feel like, if you tell Seth as an example, I see if I can find something here,

Speaker 1  1:30:57
actually asking chat GPT, what questions to Ask would be really smart. Did you have something that's smarter than chat? GPT?

Matthias Miller  1:31:08
I have a potential resource in the labs. They have a book fellowship. Mythology, focus, areas, perspective,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:41
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:31:56
if you can, I don't know for sure. Let's do this. I have two developers who are going to spend time shadowing client, either Joy inc or chief. Joy officer, be good books for them to read, to Prepare them. I

Matthias Miller  1:32:51
so Joy Inc, right up here, which parts of joining would be most relevant, which chapters and

Unknown Speaker  1:33:23
so

Matthias Miller  1:33:26
I would think so Joy Inc and Menlo Labs is a very interesting take on it. Yeah, okay, and I don't know here is here, let's do this. I'll shoot. There is a PDF in the signal chat and you can read. And I don't know if it's worth and Joel, I think Joel has some context and experience with he does, yes, he does philosophy, but I wonder if this could actually lend some especially the high tech anthropology. Uh huh. Can you provide a detailed breakdown of i

Matthias Miller  1:34:29
Here we go. I think honestly, if you had them, I don't know, maybe this is too heady, yeah, but

Matthias Miller  1:34:48
yes, please make a printable Field Guide drive. Let's go to the silver limb shared. I'm. Share drive. I'm just gonna throw it in here. Probably doesn't vlog in there, but I'm

Speaker 1  1:35:28
fun to see. I know I have not pushed into joining, but Joel has been have effusive about them. So,

Matthias Miller  1:35:38
yeah, I think, I think, I think some of the key things

Unknown Speaker  1:35:43
is,

Matthias Miller  1:35:52
I mean, here's also this. I think the key things is, like, people lie when they're I mean, don't lie, but you don't know, always get the full picture, accurate picture, when people are talking to

Matthias Miller  1:36:08
you, this is great.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:12
Oh, encourages working in pairs. That's interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:20
Avoid jumping to solutions during the observation phase.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:23
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:33
you pick so

Matthias Miller  1:36:35
this is not very it's not very structured or dialed in, but it's some raw material to work with. No, that's fantastic. That was

Speaker 1  1:36:43
fruitful. Thank you. Okay, good times. Good Well, I don't think it was well, I don't know that it was the Lord making me miss calls, but as I look back at how awful the last eight months was, then I say, Well, I guess I didn't, at least have a lot of sales calls through that time. At least

Matthias Miller  1:37:10
she didn't have that on your plate. She terrible, unbelievable. Here we go, God, yeah, I've got a random Report Writer question, yeah, I want to be able to write x 30s that move RG rows from one record to other records. And is the best way, I think the best way that I can find is to have a sub pane. So I don't think X 30s for selected values, respects RG rows. And so I think the best way is to have a sub pane down at the bottom of the screen that's pretty innocuous with a button then that that runs, runs. It does that sound right?

Speaker 1  1:37:52
Sounds about right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:37:56
Good, good. Awesome.

Speaker 1  1:37:59
Thank you, sir. Oh, by the way, we're getting tiles, which is, I mean, you've seen dashboards where it says it's got a heading and a big number or staff or something on the tile. So we are, in the next several months, we're going to get tiles for our dashboards along with our charts.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:16
So sweet. Our

Matthias Miller  1:38:18
dashboards are standard components only still,

Speaker 1  1:38:21
right? I'm not sure actually let me check if web sandbox, I know they were recently actually toying with making them for everyone, user, folders,

Matthias Miller  1:38:39
new file,

Speaker 1  1:38:41
no, you got them in dev that you have them. I'm not cheap, all right, um, I, and I would, I kind of think we need to start building dashboards into almost every single project where, I mean or when we're possible. It's hard to come up with the stats, but they're they're powerful. So they are powerful.

Matthias Miller  1:39:08
Really short, fun stat story, doing a discovery with shed client, and one of the sales people said, hey, when production sends us buildings versus when we request them, production hangs on a lot longer. I was like, Well, is this true or not? So I scraped data out of the shed app and ran some numbers. And sure enough, it's, it's at least it sits on the lot for, I want to say, three months longer, and for their particular location, that their location was doing about a million and a quarter, and it was accounting for, if you could shorten it up by two months, it was accounting for about a quarter million of revenue. So it's just fun being able to like, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:39:49
so you're the difference is whether the dealer chooses what he wants or whether the production just put send something to them,

Matthias Miller  1:39:56
yeah. Basically, I mean, they said they've gotten spotful stuff. Like, oh, we're. This customer wins green, we're gonna send you guys some more green. They're like, green doesn't sell. Like, green, like, yeah, yeah, sure. I mean, it's optimized for two different things. One's for sales, one's for production efficiency, sure. And there's a hidden cost to it,

Speaker 1  1:40:15
yeah, that's fantastic. Good work anyway. Good. Thank you, sir. Yep. Take care. Bye.
