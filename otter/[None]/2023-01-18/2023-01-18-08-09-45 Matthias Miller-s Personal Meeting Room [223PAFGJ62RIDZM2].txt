Unknown Speaker  01:00
This is Ben

Unknown Speaker  01:08
we jump into deep into this stuff, we are

Matthias Miller  01:17
looking to work with a recruiting company that specializes in hiring virtual assistants.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
And the

Matthias Miller  01:27
company I'm working with now, which is basically just very, they're not actually recruiting company and just some very lightweight kind of help on the front end are suggesting that we keep the existing interviews that we have. But if we do that, the existing logic tests, but if we do that, then we'll still have to redirect any winners across over into

Unknown Speaker  01:53
the other to the other

Matthias Miller  01:59
other company other listing. So there's a whole host of varieties of why we're making this change. I mean, there's a handful of reasons why we're making this change, predominantly to make my life simpler in this process. And for the additional support that the other other company can provide. I am inclined to just pull the plug

Unknown Speaker  02:28
and free up about

Matthias Miller  02:33
eight to 10 hours of your time over the next

Unknown Speaker  02:35
week.

Matthias Miller  02:39
And have you be working on other stuff instead?

Speaker 1  02:43
But unless you literally are unless

Matthias Miller  02:58
you don't have other things to work on?

Unknown Speaker  03:04
Then you just be

Matthias Miller  03:05
burning that time regardless, or unless you have a reason to talk me out of doing this.

Speaker 1  03:13
Right. Um, yeah,

Speaker 2  03:17
I've definitely really enjoyed, like monitoring them I've had, I think I've done like seven of them. And I've had just about that many either cancel or not show up.

Unknown Speaker  03:30
But yeah, I think

Speaker 2  03:33
it definitely would make your life easier to have somebody or another

Unknown Speaker  03:39
company running this,

Speaker 2  03:40
the only issue I can see with that is that

Unknown Speaker  03:45
we know really well what type of person we're looking for. And so yeah,

Speaker 2  03:55
for me to be able to sit there and observe them and take those notes during a test. I'm not exactly sure how the rest of the interview process goes, or something like this. But for us to be working directly with the candidate. I feel like it can provide a lot of a lot of insight for us personally. That being said, yeah, that has definitely been taking up a decent bit of my time here the last couple of weeks.

Unknown Speaker  04:27
But it's not like

Unknown Speaker  04:29
there's been a lot of other stuff that has been

Unknown Speaker  04:33
pushed to the side because of that.

Speaker 2  04:37
Yeah, because about half of them are are canceling or not showing up. That still frees up that much time to be able to work on other stuff. So yeah, as I would get deeper into some of these other additional jobs that we've been talking about, maybe that would change but once again, I have a feeling that we would be able to find a kid Did before too long within hopefully next couple of weeks

Speaker 1  05:03
to to end up stopping that, that any process and bring someone on? But yeah, I don't know, I definitely see both benefits and and potential problems with with shifting it all over to a hiring company like that. Yeah, I could be I could be fine. Either way, whichever way you want it to swing with it. So, here's the

Matthias Miller  05:44
here's the upside and the downside, the upside is that

Speaker 1  05:59
from a from a business philosophy standpoint, so, okay, a few websites number one,

Matthias Miller  06:14
this company is not a random company, it comes with high recommendations from people that I know like and trust. And

Speaker 1  06:22
number two, philosophy and approach to business is probably better aligned than most companies.

Matthias Miller  06:36
Okay, that's the, that's the upside. Downside like you said

Unknown Speaker  06:41
is

Matthias Miller  06:51
is some loss of control over

Unknown Speaker  06:55
you know, what are? Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  07:03
unless you monitor these exercises, so we will have an interview process where we can basically give a yay or nay. So the way they do it is they do all the upfront filtering based on some of the values we establish and based on things, you know, the types of work that they're going to be doing, etc. And then they presented us with candidate one we do yay or nay. If nay they go find candidate two yay or nay? Candidate three, yay or nay? And if by the third candidate, it's not the middle, take a look and say, Hey, are you the right fit for you guys?

Unknown Speaker  07:38
And if not, then

Matthias Miller  07:40
the search portion of it is refundable.

Unknown Speaker  07:46
So so that gives

Matthias Miller  07:51
that gives us some opportunity to

Unknown Speaker  07:55
engage with the person and know from that standpoint,

Matthias Miller  07:59
is this a good fit? I found it pretty interesting to observe your observations and the problem solving exercises. So it's, it's been helpful so one possibly to consider maybe, no, can we actually run those as part of the onboarding process and have a yay or nay in the process?

Unknown Speaker  08:34
And so we'll have to we'll have to talk that through

Speaker 1  08:43
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, knowing that this would be I mean, yeah, I kind of figured it was somebody who had

Speaker 2  08:55
been highly recommended to you or something like that, that it wasn't a just a random company out there. But, yeah, having having at least somebody that it's been recommended for multiple people that you trust and stuff like that definitely helps, I think.

Unknown Speaker  09:15
Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  09:18
The 50% cancellation makes me much more comfortable for you going ahead and I mean, I know that's all estimated we don't know exactly what's going to happen but makes me a lot more comfortable about about this. I think the biggest question I would have actually here is the name this is the question

Unknown Speaker  09:36
see?

Unknown Speaker  09:51
Go to

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Let me see if there's any information about what what I'm actually legally allowed to do with this?

Matthias Miller  11:25
Okay I don't think there's anything in my agreement that prevents me from basically going back to these folks and saying hey,

Unknown Speaker  11:36
there's a change in this process you have to go

Matthias Miller  11:40
through X or Y process and then determine from there whether you're a good fit so let's go ahead and keep rolling with whoever sticks. If for some reason we find an 80 percenter

Unknown Speaker  11:57
then we can

Matthias Miller  12:01
just update them on the changes and pass them over in the other direction. Okay.

Speaker 2  12:07
Got Yeah, just for reference. I currently have 14 people booked or scheduled from the next one starts at noon today. And the last one starts at 930 Next Wednesday morning. So I've got 14 people within the next week

Unknown Speaker  12:27
that are booked so

Speaker 2  12:29
percentages are averages they stay the same I have another seven candidates that are monitored between now but if if you want to end up shifting that all over to them, let me know and I can

Unknown Speaker  12:45
Yeah, we can figure it out. So guys for those sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  12:56
All right. Now I actually realize that there was a change request for zfp documentation and rather than giving you another see let me just go ahead and sharing my screen so let me go here and I am going to since for somebody for 16. I'm going to oops, it's not what I wanted

Unknown Speaker  13:57
ah interesting. Can you change your

Matthias Miller  14:03
timecard from this

Unknown Speaker  14:05
to

Unknown Speaker  14:12
that to that Brown is right here.

Unknown Speaker  14:52
70

Unknown Speaker  15:16
change mine ever as well

Speaker 2  15:22
you want me to go back to last week and change it and last week as well Yes?

Unknown Speaker  16:37
Is it relevant

Unknown Speaker  17:03
okay so

Speaker 1  17:35
so let's let's start working on the outline perhaps and see what we've got so we have a whole host of things that are wildly out of date

Speaker 1  18:00
this module two isn't really relevant or helpful

Unknown Speaker  18:13
so we have okay let's figure this

Matthias Miller  18:17
out first where should the outline go? Do we want the outline to be

Unknown Speaker  18:24
what if we did a report

Unknown Speaker  18:36
that was a client proposal report and

Unknown Speaker  18:54
be prepared for organization

Unknown Speaker  19:08
All right, then we've got

Unknown Speaker  19:17
going to include

Unknown Speaker  19:33
actually, we're going to repeat on

Speaker 1  19:50
there's a name or something called group by proposal name. One goes away.

Unknown Speaker  20:13
Somewhere we have a macro that lets us add the outline numbering

Unknown Speaker  20:52
what that one is little section outline

Unknown Speaker  21:17
posle section number pipe list

Unknown Speaker  21:25
there no way to well I guess we could do it repeat for list

Unknown Speaker  21:47
no section

Unknown Speaker  22:15
this is actually how it's

Unknown Speaker  22:33
okay that's what I wanted

Unknown Speaker  22:51
we've got our outline this is we're gonna save this as we're just gonna see right here

Unknown Speaker  23:15
all right payroll and employee management

Matthias Miller  23:19
we have reporting and dashboard sales and sales order entry system we have that as a CRM

Unknown Speaker  23:31
internal sales dealer sales party two contracts order entry was the one point of walkthrough

Unknown Speaker  23:49
not sure

Matthias Miller  23:50
diagram payment of a retail wholesale a bill of lading

Speaker 1  23:55
retail price settings and you fracturing production lead time count up or assigning what builds

Matthias Miller  24:09
a lot of the stuff that we built out actually forget so we get

Unknown Speaker  24:13
county CRM.

Speaker 1  24:55
So either Commission's logistics and hauling payroll Here's our to while brainstorms okay to financing and funding Spearman this should be I'm gonna change this over to things it's actually Brickell with management

Unknown Speaker  25:25
yeah that's clearly

Unknown Speaker  25:41
so I got we're

Matthias Miller  25:43
the sales side they're working through what do you do

Unknown Speaker  25:46
for

Matthias Miller  25:53
$23,000 rent to own contracts Oh, so if you have an investor or do funder who doesn't mind risk

Unknown Speaker  26:03
there's I mean it's double or triple your money

Matthias Miller  26:12
so the current proposal is you have a series of three or four non refundable down payments before the building gets built and are delivered and that gets taken off your your rent to own contract if it's within your budget but you're already established and then you prove that you can actually pay

Unknown Speaker  26:35
gotcha interesting

Speaker 1  26:45
ah this is the original the very original oh wow I'm just gonna go should go the attendance

Matthias Miller  27:19
no longer put pricing and main proposals so that we can

Unknown Speaker  27:31
oh this is hilarious

Unknown Speaker  27:37
compass reports straighter interface expectations for parties

Matthias Miller  27:56
the facts of the weather forecast

Unknown Speaker  28:08
Alright, so I think where we want to go probably where we want to go is

Matthias Miller  28:18
this one needs to be worked through. Let's start with this one. This is like the master behemoth of everything reporting and dashboard

Unknown Speaker  28:28
somewhere we need a list of probably it's

Matthias Miller  28:34
this wild brainstorms

Speaker 1  28:41
let me split this into a different screen new shear alright so.

Unknown Speaker  29:46
internal sales to your contracts we

Matthias Miller  29:53
got that in there order entry

Unknown Speaker  29:56
says projects list of deliverables

Unknown Speaker  30:11
They have a ton of

Matthias Miller  30:11
ideas that they never even touched on

Unknown Speaker  30:16
negotiated warranty tracking most of this stuff is done sales order internal sales okay let's do this let's do

Unknown Speaker  30:37
it going to do Mark Troyer to do's

Unknown Speaker  30:55
be Dwayne I'm not sure billings on the rake be pure Sales Lead regional sales site

Matthias Miller  31:13
inventory received money we got that building logs modification history kind of

Speaker 1  31:19
scheduling repairs scheduling hauling customer communication

Unknown Speaker  31:32
driver access we got

Matthias Miller  31:33
that filter law inventory holding lot enter in Tori

Speaker 1  31:49
yes and active RFID we got that documented Sales Lead funnel pipeline lead qualification gift ology we don't

Unknown Speaker  32:35
don't even know exactly what

Unknown Speaker  32:43
which initially was here

Unknown Speaker  33:17
changes from wild brainstorms to something a little more maybe we should actually

Unknown Speaker  33:41
better way

Unknown Speaker  33:48
to be have anything on should be going a little different direction inventory management I wonder if we should

Unknown Speaker  34:14
seems just a little overwhelming here. manufacturing and production

Unknown Speaker  34:25
county you're

Unknown Speaker  35:00
I think these compass reports QuickBooks reports Minister you're in a place

Unknown Speaker  35:42
going to do this

Unknown Speaker  36:00
actually it is it is pretty close to that what do we call it in the live system

Unknown Speaker  36:27
okay

Matthias Miller  36:28
so that takes care of that one let's go into price calculator and see what this one actually is so we

Unknown Speaker  36:32
need one of those fields um who made this one is this a Josh when I made it

Unknown Speaker  37:02
this one I think

Unknown Speaker  37:12
wow Ah

Unknown Speaker  37:23
this one we have not

Matthias Miller  37:30
you probably haven't even seen the configured there configurator have you

Unknown Speaker  37:35
so

Unknown Speaker  37:47
per se Jack Marissa

Speaker 1  37:59
So, these is the configurator

Matthias Miller  38:02
it's not 3d its duty at this point. But everything integrates into live pricing which I know I don't know, I haven't gone in depth into what's on the market right now. But there are very, very few visualizers that actually integrate this deeply into the backend manufacturing I think there might be maybe one or one of the products that do but all of it like literally all of this all of this stuff is configured in the database

Speaker 1  38:43
gotcha and all kinds of cool stuff you can do. Like you can go inside and you can see what it looks like from the inside you can put I don't know why I don't have oh, I can put into your lights somewhere wherever I want et cetera and

Matthias Miller  39:10
all kinds of other add ons I'm gonna have to get into but yeah. Okay, so this is going to be assist

Unknown Speaker  39:17
2.0 visualizer

Matthias Miller  39:22
and this one I'm going to say

Unknown Speaker  39:33
we're going to mark all of these as inactive because they're just scratch pads that.

Unknown Speaker  39:56
Known as the configurator. Okay so there's that All right now we're starting to get somewhere

Unknown Speaker  40:17
management need a

Unknown Speaker  41:00
doesn't show up it's empty let me make sure that

Unknown Speaker  41:20
changes reports

Speaker 1  42:09
all right up there okay so manufacturing production

Unknown Speaker  42:27
this can go into I don't know this

Matthias Miller  42:33
is actually the best way to do it

Unknown Speaker  42:35
but I went

Unknown Speaker  42:52
actually let me just do this even better

Unknown Speaker  43:05
goes into their finished goods management holding lots we have not done

Unknown Speaker  43:38
logistics we have six in hauling

Unknown Speaker  43:48
delivery app signed to you

Speaker 1  45:41
So here

Unknown Speaker  46:10
spec true history false

Unknown Speaker  46:57
we check that we can actually do this thing

Unknown Speaker  48:20
Alright so this doesn't need to go I mean this can go this can go this can go

Unknown Speaker  48:39
this is

Unknown Speaker  48:59
so this is Mark gonna do Dwayne

Unknown Speaker  49:16
Do

Unknown Speaker  49:22
you want the

Speaker 2  49:23
number for there to say To be or not to I'm sorry Thank

Unknown Speaker  49:27
you. Yep, I do all right. So, that will give us driver communication assume this is

Unknown Speaker  50:11
It was planned for him I

Matthias Miller  50:12
mean I don't know customer support repairs

Matthias Miller  50:23
financials

Unknown Speaker  50:26
we already have gone crazy on that one marketing

Unknown Speaker  50:46
July users

Unknown Speaker  51:09
sure

Unknown Speaker  51:15
should we put

Matthias Miller  51:21
should we put future development ideas in its own thing or should we would probably make more sense to put it in the section of wherever it goes

Unknown Speaker  51:35
right yeah that's what I think all right well so this is

Unknown Speaker  52:00
the visualizer for

Unknown Speaker  52:23
daily station sheets

Matthias Miller  53:01
we should distinguish between we've got two categories one is a we think this is probably a good idea and then we have these this is a wild off the chain

Unknown Speaker  53:20
thing that is interesting enough to record right

Unknown Speaker  53:34
What is good I guess if we're putting them

Speaker 2  53:40
in their thing and that would work I was gonna say what if we would have a spot where we just put all of those kind of wild idea

Unknown Speaker  53:55
What if we keep this this section as wild brainstorms there you go and then

Unknown Speaker  54:19
this one is definitely

Speaker 1  54:46
oh I sorted the search okay. So I think besides the TV news that takes care of that

Unknown Speaker  55:02
And here's another idea this might actually make it a little easier to read

Unknown Speaker  55:25
was it was wider okay so

Unknown Speaker  55:42
I'm going to

Unknown Speaker  56:40
okay I think I don't know that we need

Matthias Miller  56:44
we need to wrap up the two dues but I'm gonna close this one out because it's it's not part of the active list of

Unknown Speaker  56:52
things that we're looking to do either Commission's effects okay now let's go let's go into here so your sales

Matthias Miller  57:05
just covered logistics production inventory

Unknown Speaker  57:16
I think this one probably shouldn't be

Unknown Speaker  57:32
here we have firm in your admin

Unknown Speaker  57:41
STURMS okay so

Unknown Speaker  57:56
now let's do

Unknown Speaker  58:04
this is well

Unknown Speaker  58:23
let's go through the wild brainstorms let's get that one cleaned up

Unknown Speaker  58:32
so we're going to add a

Matthias Miller  58:53
Imagine having a little GPS item in a in the building says you build the floor or whatever you put it in there and you do offensive moves over here

Unknown Speaker  59:07
do that

Matthias Miller  59:15
okay, I think we might have a separate question but this

Unknown Speaker  59:30
data entry

Unknown Speaker  59:41
crash report

Unknown Speaker  59:49
should be proudly interested in the role

Unknown Speaker  1:00:28
sticks

Speaker 1  1:00:46
okay well let's let's qualify as well brainstorms

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56
Good now

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
let's start with permissions next good place to go oops I should put a link to do this

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
right now

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
alright

Unknown Speaker  1:02:55
alright inventory management manufacturing and production I mean only like

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
and visualizing configurator only like the core parts of

Unknown Speaker  1:03:13
the system started manufacturing production so we'd have

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
buildings

Unknown Speaker  1:03:47
companies

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
this one is

Matthias Miller  1:04:51
let's actually do this as well

Unknown Speaker  1:05:03
Well now let's do this we'll get to that so that's that inventory management we've got

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
Oh fun stuff

Matthias Miller  1:05:23
we're gonna have to distinguish between the core reusable inventory management module and the customizations that they have

Unknown Speaker  1:05:31
but either way

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
sharing this with you

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20
this is core modules

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
right here we are just going to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:21
check we need business

Unknown Speaker  1:08:06
oops

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
okay so the imagery management times

Speaker 1  1:08:24
inventory adjustment ledger account purchase order you you lot

Matthias Miller  1:08:36
you location Do you have any other core modules that should be included email reminders

Unknown Speaker  1:08:42
Accounting I actually do

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
allocation Sir let me finish this before we get even more distracted

Speaker 1  1:09:14
we're going to have to probably have to have help to figure out which ones are standard and not billable equals email reminders or

Unknown Speaker  1:09:30
accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
attacks

Unknown Speaker  1:09:52
get even more interesting inventory management Production let's go okay so now let's go

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
campaign and CRM payroll module base

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
this is all visual

Speaker 1  1:10:43
got the building definition building item building

Unknown Speaker  1:11:07
compass mapping

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
we want to separate

Unknown Speaker  1:11:52
contact group

Matthias Miller  1:11:53
going to guess that comes in

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
phone actually it's probably is dealer oh goodness

Speaker 1  1:12:15
I don't even want to think about this document let's go to this this is the phone menu

Speaker 1  1:12:49
never leave electronic contracts be or to

Unknown Speaker  1:13:24
All right well

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
now what I need to do is figure out what needs to be done to start pushing this stuff across into their wiki

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
next step would be

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
This

Unknown Speaker  1:15:27
Hey so there's that one

Unknown Speaker  1:16:08
what gift allergy

Unknown Speaker  1:16:21
why wouldn't we actually

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
actually Wayne?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
that okay

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
alright, let's see what it's not to be a drop off

Matthias Miller  1:19:08
me see if I can actually, no, you won't be able to make the call but let me see if Dwayne would actually be he wants to talk to me about other stuff. And I'll nap him and get some of these questions answered that I've got for him. So think so I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:22
think that basically nails down a good bit of the outline, at least. Probably some more work that can be done.

Matthias Miller  1:19:32
Next piece on pay one of the big things.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:36
I should have covered this earlier. Let me draft you

Matthias Miller  1:19:43
an email with more of what I'm thinking on the payroll module. Were you able to spend any time working on payroll?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:49
I was not no. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:19:57
Let me jump on and then we're good

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
As I said, just depending on

Speaker 2  1:20:02
second half of the day tomorrow and all day Friday who shows up for problem solving exercises? I could work on that. Okay. Yeah, I have not been able to do anything

Unknown Speaker  1:20:15
why don't we actually

Matthias Miller  1:20:37
let me have it we do we circle up 3pm

Unknown Speaker  1:20:40
on Monday and touch base on the project. Okay, work gonna send it over to you. Oh, thanks. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:02
Thank you. You bet. See
