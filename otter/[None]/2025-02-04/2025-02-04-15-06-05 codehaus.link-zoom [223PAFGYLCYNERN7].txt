Unknown Speaker  00:03
I need to turn on my recording too,

Unknown Speaker  00:09
so,

Unknown Speaker  00:14
or even if I know okay, I need to ask him for his ein what type of business or whatever, like the full list of things I need to be asking him to

Unknown Speaker  00:30
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  00:32
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  00:35
so

Unknown Speaker  00:38
part

Unknown Speaker  00:40
one

Unknown Speaker  00:42
that doc I sent about two hours ago.

Unknown Speaker  00:47
Yes, I imported that into the account, contains my brother, contains most of

Unknown Speaker  00:57
one second. No.

Unknown Speaker  01:06
Uh,

Unknown Speaker  01:08
contains most of the details. There is no single, solitary, clear path, so, um,

Unknown Speaker  01:19
give me a second, I got too much going on on my screen.

Unknown Speaker  01:42
And just try this again.

Unknown Speaker  01:48
Need a button that says, whole window. What is going on here?

Unknown Speaker  01:58
Oh, I ran into this the other day. Zoom won't let me share a whole desktop anymore. Have you seen that?

Unknown Speaker  02:06
I've seen some cases where it will but

Unknown Speaker  02:09
seeing some limitations to that, I think it's thing. It is a

Unknown Speaker  02:20
because Oh, it must be, because it's your meeting and not my meeting. I don't even know that I can.

Unknown Speaker  02:29
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  02:32
we'll do this and

Unknown Speaker  02:37
hold Shift to select multiple windows.

Unknown Speaker  02:41
Okay, supposedly I am saying multiple windows with you. What do you actually see? Okay, give me. Give me one

Unknown Speaker  02:58
second. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  03:01
You

Unknown Speaker  03:03
typically,

Unknown Speaker  03:09
yes, I'm seeing, I mean, it's an overlay, so if you want me to see them all at the same time, you have to change them, not to overlap. But yes, I'm seeing

Unknown Speaker  03:17
that I see only need one at a time. Like, which one are you seeing right now, high level is on top, and the 502, new plan is underneath, and if I know it's reversed, okay, that's just weird, but thank you. Zoom, okay, so in so this is the doc that I put into chanty earlier. I'm sorry. I know it's very long. This is the one I showed you a few weeks ago. And there is lots of stuff in here about how to get through the

Unknown Speaker  03:49
the thing in general, but the short version, there is no short version. But the short version is, if you go to settings,

Unknown Speaker  03:58
as far as I can tell, nobody is going to get away with not filling this out. So yes, name, legal name, email, actual address, ein, and all that, and, and and all of this, you're just going to have to have that before you can try to apply for

Unknown Speaker  04:20
do you need the website?

Unknown Speaker  04:24
Okay, I guess that's debatable, but I always did

Unknown Speaker  04:30
I get the point. Because he doesn't have his website up yet, we can send it to the landing page. I think we can just do it to the land make sure you have a CNA point yet. I'm pretty sure you can just, yeah, no, I'm absolutely sure you can fake it out with this subdomain for the landing page. The one thing you cannot fake is the EIN and the tax ID number, and

Unknown Speaker  04:53
then they definitely want name, state, address, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  04:58
Okay, so you.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
Easy Way is on the business profile. Let me go back to Jeremy Weaver's account

Unknown Speaker  05:07
business profile. Can you please fill out

Unknown Speaker  05:11
all right so we can do go dot Cornerstone building. What is it?

Unknown Speaker  05:19
Right?

Unknown Speaker  05:25
That go that person, outdoor structures.

Unknown Speaker  05:28
I have to say, it's really not a memorable name. I know he's a client of mine, but

Unknown Speaker  05:35
this is niche

Unknown Speaker  05:39
shed builder, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  05:43
Okay, so we've got this business profile. We have business physical location.

Unknown Speaker  05:49
We need business information. So this is the business information, obviously, USA and Canada

Unknown Speaker  05:57
wonder what Colorado should put in for their they

Unknown Speaker  06:01
put it in construction. I don't

Unknown Speaker  06:04
know if it's construction, retail. Probably would you retail? Yeah, probably yes.

Unknown Speaker  06:16
All right, so let me do this. Let me get a screenshot,

Unknown Speaker  06:20
and so the next step would be for Jeremy to fill this out.

Unknown Speaker  06:28
Jeremy

Unknown Speaker  06:44
thanks.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Jeremy,

Unknown Speaker  06:52
can you please fill out this section?

Unknown Speaker  07:00
Here's

Unknown Speaker  07:06
this to set up,

Unknown Speaker  07:09
all right, so in the onboarding.

Unknown Speaker  07:13
So let's make a note. I'm going to send Audra a message.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
I'm to take a screenshot,

Unknown Speaker  07:28
and I'm going to

Unknown Speaker  07:32
grab the marker

Unknown Speaker  07:35
and the Scribbler. This one, I'm

Unknown Speaker  07:43
this.

Unknown Speaker  07:49
Oh, he did not. I can get his

Unknown Speaker  07:55
and this,

Unknown Speaker  07:59
actually, I should have done the

Unknown Speaker  08:09
done,

Unknown Speaker  08:14
marker,

Unknown Speaker  08:16
markup, scribble, scribble. So this thing over here.

Unknown Speaker  08:25
See over here.

Unknown Speaker  08:29
So in there,

Unknown Speaker  08:31
this stuff,

Unknown Speaker  08:34
okay,

Unknown Speaker  08:40
and then

Unknown Speaker  08:42
drop it into Audrey, into her channel, because she's also likely to miss it

Unknown Speaker  08:47
Audra.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
So one of my clients saw

Unknown Speaker  08:58
Audrey name assume because she's a Miller, she's my wife, had

Unknown Speaker  09:02
a conversation with his sister in law who met my wife, and high clarity and confusion ensued.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
Or Mormons?

Unknown Speaker  09:16
Yeah, no, we're not. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  09:22
Can you please include this in the CRM onboarding? We need this information to enable SMS. Okay. So then one other thing, Cornerstone outdoor structures, Texas. Let me go find his.

Unknown Speaker  09:40
I think he said he's on Google Maps. So

Unknown Speaker  09:46
is DO

Unknown Speaker  09:49
THIS IS

Unknown Speaker  09:59
THE.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Is the physical location you get.

Unknown Speaker  10:05
And we were,

Unknown Speaker  10:09
use this Texas. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  10:12
we're just going to put

Unknown Speaker  10:15
them in there. Use this Texas.

Unknown Speaker  10:21
I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:23
Texas.

Unknown Speaker  10:25
I Okay, so balls in his court, that takes care of that, until he gets back with us. But the other thing we could potentially do is go into his sites, or his funnels. So now we go into sites, okay? And I just, I told you slightly wrong, and I'm terribly disappointed, not just for the wrong but for the lack of what I'm looking for. So it looks like, can you see my screen again? Yeah, it looks like you did import.

Unknown Speaker  10:57
Ah, come back. I just had it in front of me.

Unknown Speaker  11:11
Sorry, I totally lost one second.

Unknown Speaker  11:15
There it is. It looks to me like you did just import this into Jeremy's. Is that true? Yes, okay, and I'm sorry that is nothing but the terms

Unknown Speaker  11:24
of service and compliance page. I was thinking it was the funnel as well, and I absolutely do have the funnel, but give me just a minute to try to find that.

Unknown Speaker  11:34
So now I need this, this and this. Now I got, I guess three screen

Unknown Speaker  11:44
sharing with you.

Unknown Speaker  11:52
Please work

Unknown Speaker  11:59
it's on.

Unknown Speaker  12:01
There we go.

Unknown Speaker  12:16
It's got this weird, grayed out

Unknown Speaker  12:21
load.

Unknown Speaker  12:28
So I should

Unknown Speaker  12:31
wait to connect the domain to anything

Unknown Speaker  12:39
we got the

Unknown Speaker  12:42
no should be fine.

Unknown Speaker  12:46
Literally, just trying to think what the fastest way to

Unknown Speaker  12:51
Get the funnel in here is Not automation sites.

Unknown Speaker  12:58
I

Unknown Speaker  13:42
No, idea why this has been so slow, sorry. So basically, what I really want is this. I'm actually looking for this right here,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
form with consent checkbox and a thank you page,

Unknown Speaker  14:00
and

Unknown Speaker  14:04
please load,

Unknown Speaker  14:06
just load. And in terms of service, privacy policy that should fly, that should fly just fine, that looks the same. And why would we modify this thing to be universal and pull in things like company names that we can just literally plan to fall

Unknown Speaker  14:23
I'm hoping to do that on The spot.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
Let's see what I can do here.

Unknown Speaker  14:31
I

Unknown Speaker  14:56
be, s be for.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Funnel only for A to P compliance

Unknown Speaker  15:08
locations. I don't do I have to choose. I have to choose a location, okay, Jimmy Weaver's

Unknown Speaker  15:18
clone. I

Unknown Speaker  15:23
And I'm aware that this is ugly and other stuff, but it works

Unknown Speaker  15:28
if

Unknown Speaker  15:30
somebody was, I mean, I don't care about ugly. I just, I mean, having something like this, but you can literally, like, go, follow these instructions, clone the funnel. Yep, it shows business information to get approved, and we're rolling is, like, incredibly valuable, oh yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:49
oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:51
Why it's stuck or stalled there? I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  16:00
Well, seeing you stuck.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Hey, there it is. So it made it in spite of all that,

Unknown Speaker  16:23
why do I not see

Unknown Speaker  16:27
there? It is custom values, custom values. Agency name.

Unknown Speaker  16:33
Oh, dear. Oh, yeah, okay. Did you have that in here already?

Unknown Speaker  16:38
I think this just stuff just came in with that thing I just imported. I think it came in with that thing to support it.

Unknown Speaker  16:44
So this is about to be agency, agency name. Oh, yeah, I know why. It says agency name, edit. It's basically business name. This is corner corner stone out door. It's not sheds, is it buildings, structures,

Unknown Speaker  17:04
structures,

Unknown Speaker  17:10
go, go, go.

Unknown Speaker  17:16
It's this one. I want to see it.

Unknown Speaker  17:21
Yeah, look at that.

Unknown Speaker  17:23
Unable to find form, oh, oh, no, well, um, that's odd. Okay, so does that mean I have to share a form separately, Form Builder,

Unknown Speaker  17:39
share. Oh, thank God, oh, I can't do that kind of share, So

Unknown Speaker  17:45
that's too bad.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
Fastest way to do this, I

Unknown Speaker  18:05
I do not

Unknown Speaker  18:19
don't really want to this

Unknown Speaker  18:28
before I waste an hour. Well, you know what? That's not bad. What does this say?

Unknown Speaker  18:33
Because we don't need the actual test drive. First Name, Last Name phone,

Unknown Speaker  18:41
first thing, last name, phone, email. I agree, in terms of conditions provided by the company, I agree to receive text messages from the business. Do

Unknown Speaker  19:58
a break um.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Um,

Unknown Speaker  20:01
I think in

Unknown Speaker  20:03
the interest of just getting this done, I think that's good enough.

Unknown Speaker  20:08
So then back out of here,

Unknown Speaker  20:13
back to

Unknown Speaker  20:16
just give it a decent name.

Unknown Speaker  20:18
Rename, Rena, rename,

Unknown Speaker  20:22
okay. Edit.

Unknown Speaker  20:24
I'm

Unknown Speaker  20:58
that one,

Unknown Speaker  21:00
that one

Unknown Speaker  21:03
edit

Unknown Speaker  21:14
forms yet that is not true. I have a form. I

Unknown Speaker  21:37
but it wants me To make a form. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  22:08
So why this is blank. I

Unknown Speaker  22:24
going on in here. Imagine domain sleeping. Oh, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
That's the pages. Where's the form

Unknown Speaker  22:40
giving Andy how to fix this problem.

Unknown Speaker  22:43
I'm sorry you're not seeing it.

Unknown Speaker  22:47
It's just not letting me

Unknown Speaker  22:50
you do.

Unknown Speaker  22:52
Maybe it's when you hit edit form on the right. Let me just try it. Open this blank looking page right here, which you don't understand.

Unknown Speaker  23:02
I

Unknown Speaker  23:06
i try that again. So edit,

Unknown Speaker  23:10
or what if you create a new form element, are you able to?

Unknown Speaker  23:20
Did you do not like I want to choose that form because it just maybe didn't save. Just go back to that builder. No, it's there. It's biggest life. Oh, maybe it's not published.

Unknown Speaker  23:32
Do forms get published?

Unknown Speaker  23:37
Preview, Save,

Unknown Speaker  23:40
integrate.

Unknown Speaker  23:46
Copy, form, link, I,

Unknown Speaker  24:32
I feel like I need an edit box or something. Why are why is nothing editable? Doing something wrong?

Unknown Speaker  24:38
Custom? No,

Unknown Speaker  24:43
open Settings. Oh, that is the settings.

Unknown Speaker  24:46
Aha, advanced. I.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
That every time I click edit, it kicks me out to the dashboard. Wonder why that is

Unknown Speaker  25:05
by creating a new a new element in there,

Unknown Speaker  25:15
a new form element,

Unknown Speaker  25:19
if only I knew,

Unknown Speaker  25:26
there we go. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  25:30
And so this one up here can go away zap

Unknown Speaker  25:35
and

Unknown Speaker  25:37
gotta be A blue color here somewhere. Where is that blue? I'm

Unknown Speaker  26:23
okay, I don't feel like playing this

Unknown Speaker  26:27
that's so funny to me. Something like choosing a color, like any web platform anywhere, it should be brain dead simple to see and pick a color

Unknown Speaker  26:42
and right, it is just not here. Do you see it? Am I missing like a color? I mean, it's, it's probably under somewhere on the wrong element, you know, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  26:58
Okay, well, it's gonna be white. Um, I think this is gonna work. What's in here? Custom HTML, open the code editor. Give me a second to use. Taking too long,

Unknown Speaker  27:09
we don't

Unknown Speaker  27:11
I can all. That's fine. That's DHL stuff. Just gonna leave it well, okay, it's not relevant. It's not like chat. We did set up. But anyway, all

Unknown Speaker  27:23
right, finally,

Unknown Speaker  27:25
save,

Unknown Speaker  27:30
publish, select your domain. This is, does this?

Unknown Speaker  27:36
The name exists? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  27:40
dig C name, go,

Unknown Speaker  27:45
dot corner stone, out door structures.com,

Unknown Speaker  27:55
Side Slip, okay, good. Save,

Unknown Speaker  27:59
Save, publishing,

Unknown Speaker  28:03
save

Unknown Speaker  28:06
back,

Unknown Speaker  28:10
open again. I don't know why that looks so funny. There it is.

Unknown Speaker  28:15
Okay that. Why did that fail? Let's see that. Let's figure that out.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
That needs to

Unknown Speaker  28:27
that's inside the form itself,

Unknown Speaker  28:35
custom values,

Unknown Speaker  28:37
biz phone,

Unknown Speaker  28:39
that's totally normal. I don't see anything about that that's odd or broken.

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Huh? Any idea what's causing that to fail?

Unknown Speaker  29:07
Sorry, what's feeling so in my experience, custom values work literally everywhere on GHL, like you just don't really even have to think about it. And so I've just made a new one. I'm trying to put it right there, and it's turning it

Unknown Speaker  29:25
into this odd little hyperlink. I would save

Unknown Speaker  29:29
it and see what it works anyway. It didn't like I proved it. It broke. See that. See how it broke.

Unknown Speaker  29:37
Ignoring the underscores. But it's that's just super odd. Oh, it's the dot biz phone. Change it to like business phone, bus or not, or.no

Unknown Speaker  29:48
dot support phone or something, or you have to delete it and recreate it really, okay, something that's not a, not a TLD, i.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
And I don't know if it'll work, but at least it's a shot.

Unknown Speaker  30:08
So like,

Unknown Speaker  30:14
company phone is like that is that we're talking about, sure,

Unknown Speaker  30:21
PD stock company is in the TLD, my knowledge. Oh, dot biz is a TLD. I get it. Okay, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  30:32
Learn something new every day, as we say, I

Unknown Speaker  30:50
is company a TLD as well,

Unknown Speaker  30:59
right? Well, anyhow, I don't like that, but for now, it is that company.

Unknown Speaker  31:05
I'm just gonna stick the phone number in there, which I do not dot phone is as well.

Unknown Speaker  31:14
By the way. I wonder if we can use different location, like location dot phone and other things like that, instead of these. I

Unknown Speaker  31:24
Oh, what is that? Let's just give that a really quick shot. It's it's really

Unknown Speaker  31:33
merge fields. Let me see location.

Unknown Speaker  31:37
I'm not sure where I find a list of that.

Unknown Speaker  31:40
Let me go into the API and see what network location, dot phone simply, let me just make sure not to save and refresh. And by the way, using this for business name too would be awesome, because it's very likely to be set up instead of agency name.

Unknown Speaker  32:00
Yep, I got your point. So let me delete this. Delete custom value, and just tell me what that one would be, please.

Unknown Speaker  32:11
Let me

Unknown Speaker  32:14
go find the

Unknown Speaker  32:19
sub account. It

Unknown Speaker  32:21
would be location dot name,

Unknown Speaker  32:24
probably

Unknown Speaker  32:27
there's also location that website, location that email. I can do those

Unknown Speaker  32:31
or dot domain.

Unknown Speaker  32:36
You try location dot name, say

Unknown Speaker  32:44
all the publishers,

Unknown Speaker  32:49
no Jeremy levers account. Where's that coming from? Well, but, I mean, but that should be updated. The friendly business name should be quarters and under structures.

Unknown Speaker  33:02
I

Unknown Speaker  33:04
boom,

Unknown Speaker  33:09
ah, and where is that weird little

Unknown Speaker  33:13
meta,

Unknown Speaker  33:15
just put in like location, dot name, again.

Unknown Speaker  33:20
Sorry, what

Unknown Speaker  33:22
in the title

Unknown Speaker  33:24
here? No, the page, title, SEO, title, got it.

Unknown Speaker  33:36
That's what you mean,

Unknown Speaker  33:39
right? I I

Unknown Speaker  33:43
did that wrong.

Unknown Speaker  33:44
Publishes needed every time,

Unknown Speaker  33:53
location, dot, name. I clicked

Unknown Speaker  33:59
publish.

Unknown Speaker  34:02
I don't know how to reopen that.

Unknown Speaker  34:07
Seo. There is

Unknown Speaker  34:10
Title, Location, dot, name, i

Unknown Speaker  34:31
i Okay. I don't know why it's not changing up there, but maybe it will later, caching something.

Unknown Speaker  34:38
Who knows? I Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:46
unless it's coming, could that possibly be coming from somewhere else?

Unknown Speaker  34:56
Keywords, authors, social management, tags.

Unknown Speaker  35:03
Just got to be it.

Unknown Speaker  35:12
If you can, you go up to the page,

Unknown Speaker  35:16
page element yet layers

Unknown Speaker  35:20
and hit page,

Unknown Speaker  35:23
nope,

Unknown Speaker  35:24
no settings on the

Unknown Speaker  35:27
page. Registered office needs to be fixed at the bottom location that we see what it is,

Unknown Speaker  35:36
location, dot,

Unknown Speaker  35:39
location, dot address, location at City, location at state, location at personal code,

Unknown Speaker  35:47
and then That's location dot phone. Is

Unknown Speaker  36:01
there another one state? Location at state, and then location.is

Unknown Speaker  36:07
it postal? Postal, capital C code, and you're

Unknown Speaker  36:13
going to want some commas and spaces in there. And then location that phone I'm

Unknown Speaker  36:51
Look at that.

Unknown Speaker  36:54
Love it. I love it. I love it,

Unknown Speaker  36:57
good. Okay, one last thing, how to how to change this odd little slug. Where would that be? It might be out in the main level

Unknown Speaker  37:10
settings. Left There you go,

Unknown Speaker  37:14
index or something or home.

Unknown Speaker  37:19
I'm just making this up. Because, like, why not?

Unknown Speaker  37:32
Hey, boom, coming to you in shanty.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
And why is this a book? I mean, this is not

Unknown Speaker  37:43
the headlines, wrong, where, where, where.

Unknown Speaker  37:47
I mean, we're not selling an accelerator. We're, we're,

Unknown Speaker  37:51
I think you might be overtaking it. We're just trying to pass ATP.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
Or what do they care? What do I care? Just tell me what you want

Unknown Speaker  38:00
to be. I

Unknown Speaker  38:03
yeah, I would just say something like, get a, get a custom or get a, get a custom personalized quote on your backyard storage building.

Unknown Speaker  38:12
Get a custom personalized, right? Personalized, yeah, yeah, quote on your backyard storage building on your back yard storage building

Unknown Speaker  38:31
for free. Now there you go,

Unknown Speaker  38:34
and then on the and we'll start your

Unknown Speaker  38:40
your shed design experience or something. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  38:46
I love it. All good, very good. What I did not do was double check that

Unknown Speaker  38:52
good update, save, publish.

Unknown Speaker  38:57
Feels like way too much saving and publishing here,

Unknown Speaker  39:01
all right, so there's that one, and then the privacy policy in terms of service don't go anywhere. Let me fix them. So now, at the bottom, though, we have the

Unknown Speaker  39:14
links at the bottom are going straight back to this page, by the way,

Unknown Speaker  39:19
I will fix that. I'll fix it right now. I did notice that it's not updating again. Shed accelerator, maybe

Unknown Speaker  39:31
just a moment.

Unknown Speaker  39:37
Go down in here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  39:43
this really should just be Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  39:56
Thank you, clone, clone. Thank.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Oh brother,

Unknown Speaker  40:03
and that needs some editing as well. But you know, one thing at a time, just a moment, I

Unknown Speaker  40:33
that's in Oh, it's in here twice. So this is

Unknown Speaker  40:40
link please.

Unknown Speaker  40:45
Paragraph animations advanced. Any idea where that is. This is a footer. I'm editing the wrong thing. It would be in the well, the form, the privacy policy link is on the form itself somewhere Well, or it's on the company settings. I'm not sure which. Oh, wait, hold on, I just didn't highlight, right? And then this one here is, is, is separate.

Unknown Speaker  41:08
Oh, we

Unknown Speaker  41:12
do this. You pick. I mean, well, I mean, where's the form getting it from the form itself. Don't worry. I'll get to that in a minute. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  41:23
I think, uh, universally, we should be able to do, I don't know what to you know how this goes another note having to be fixed manually, either way, each time, this is what, no link. Um, same deal.

Unknown Speaker  41:41
Open linking new window, yeah, that's fine, um, and

Unknown Speaker  41:46
save and publish again and again and again.

Unknown Speaker  41:52
And then now we're going

Unknown Speaker  41:55
to put back,

Unknown Speaker  41:59
and I'm going to change that to shed shed design.

Unknown Speaker  42:05
That's right.

Unknown Speaker  42:07
Shed design.

Unknown Speaker  42:12
Save

Unknown Speaker  42:18
open

Unknown Speaker  42:22
here. Aunty, let's see if it got that right. Yeah, it worked. Boom, boom, okay, and then back to the form. Form

Unknown Speaker  42:33
here.

Unknown Speaker  42:38
Okay, so the privacy doesn't actually have any kind of

Unknown Speaker  42:43
well, there might be some custom values that need to be updated in the privacy form, like reach out directly to the phone number if You really want to

Unknown Speaker  42:52
do it right. Coming, coming. I

Unknown Speaker  43:06
i do this gotta be kidding me, so then that would be

Unknown Speaker  43:10
a compelling reason to go ahead and use that other thing that I just deleted,

Unknown Speaker  43:16
right? I guess it's fine. Um,

Unknown Speaker  43:22
we can make this all more perfect when we start cranking them out by the dozen, right? Yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:29
save preview back.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
This should look better now.

Unknown Speaker  43:37
So,

Unknown Speaker  43:40
yeah, it just doesn't, it's like caching or something.

Unknown Speaker  43:44
That's fine. But if you edit the, if you go back into the site and you edit the page for the privacy policy

Unknown Speaker  43:54
and search for double double bracket, double curly brace,

Unknown Speaker  44:00
Yeah, which one

Unknown Speaker  44:02
customized estimates phone number, change the location that phone customized advisor business name, change the location that name

Unknown Speaker  44:11
exists, right?

Unknown Speaker  44:13
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  44:15
and

Unknown Speaker  44:20
where was phone location, dot name in the privacy policy we're at right now.

Unknown Speaker  44:28
I think phone is right there. Location, dot, phone,

Unknown Speaker  44:34
custom privacy policy. URL is blank.

Unknown Speaker  44:39
You know what? We really probably should just use that, because it's in too many places. You think any issues with that? I mean, probably

Unknown Speaker  44:50
okay,

Unknown Speaker  44:54
settings and then

Unknown Speaker  44:57
just if you just search on your page for double crochet.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Grace

Unknown Speaker  45:02
I will do within moments. Yep, I gotta drop off for Justin. That's weird. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  45:31
whoa, already exists. Already exists. Oh yeah, pulled in with

Unknown Speaker  45:39
that makes sense. I

Unknown Speaker  45:50
well, I was About to

Unknown Speaker  45:52
Okay. I

Unknown Speaker  52:23
All right, I'm

Unknown Speaker  52:26
just trying to Clean this back up again. I'm

Unknown Speaker  52:26
I'm just trying to clean this back up again. All right.

Unknown Speaker  52:26
I'm just trying to clean this back up again.

Unknown Speaker  52:52
I can't remember if we got that right in here, and just look, I

Unknown Speaker  52:53
Who's that can't remember if we got. All right.

Unknown Speaker  53:29
I'm pretty sure I got All that.

Unknown Speaker  53:29
man pretty sure I got all that. this back up again.

Unknown Speaker  53:32
I'm pretty sure I got all this.

Unknown Speaker  53:39
I

Unknown Speaker  53:45
I control,

Unknown Speaker  53:51
sorry.

Unknown Speaker  53:55
Oh, it does its own redirecting if you do that. Okay, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  54:01
Does it matter? Thank you, and I'll just do chat design.

Unknown Speaker  54:25
Okay, so now we have, here's Dante right now, experience with a checkbox and terms and terms,

Unknown Speaker  54:36
if they submit it,

Unknown Speaker  54:38
it goes to here.

Unknown Speaker  54:42
I did not mean to edit that close.

Unknown Speaker  54:46
It goes to here.

Unknown Speaker  54:51
All that's automated.

Unknown Speaker  54:54
Privacy, privacy,

Unknown Speaker  54:57
okay, I think we're done. I'm. here and just like.

Unknown Speaker  55:12
Okay, um, are you there?

Unknown Speaker  55:16
I'm here. And what now, I assume you're

Unknown Speaker  55:22
wanting to

Unknown Speaker  55:24
well, we can't, we can't actually apply for ATP until

Unknown Speaker  55:31
you just one thing just you did. Did you do a finding page on the

Unknown Speaker  55:38
on the template page for double curlies, just to make sure we got everything in here. Yes, yep. Like, if you just okay. I mean, if you did that, that's all I care about. It wasn't watching.

Unknown Speaker  55:49
So, one more time, double curlies. So there's location, name, green, location, name, location, phone

Unknown Speaker  56:01
and name,

Unknown Speaker  56:04
or email. Fill that out. Why not location that email for that

Unknown Speaker  56:11
no idea for support email.

Unknown Speaker  56:21
I like it.

Unknown Speaker  56:34
I

Unknown Speaker  56:38
Okay, brilliant.

Unknown Speaker  56:40
Do we want?

Unknown Speaker  56:46
By the way, this is really, really nit picky. But why are these cold, sweeping beauty?

Unknown Speaker  56:53
Um, because, so this, this is that droid that I tried to build and sell. Um,

Unknown Speaker  56:58
so he it's based, so it's remarketing via text message, so these people already know or should know, your company. So the very first contact message

Unknown Speaker  57:11
is a variation of Dean Jackson's nine word email. Hey, Jim, are you still interested in buying a shed? Okay, or getting Google ads or whatever? And

Unknown Speaker  57:22
the fellow that developed all this, he's a fairly good marketer, so of course, he didn't want to call it nine word text message. So he's he's playing off of the Sleeping Beauty Prince, charming idea,

Unknown Speaker  57:39
if you remember, right in that fairy tale, the prince kisses the sleeping princess to wake her up. And so, like it's a playoff of the idea of waking up your list, for

Unknown Speaker  57:50
you know, reactivation,

Unknown Speaker  57:53
waking up your old dead leads, yep,

Unknown Speaker  57:58
yep. And we can turn bugs you or anything? I don't care.

Unknown Speaker  58:18
There you go. All right, do you need any without and do you even need the page without the page without the

Unknown Speaker  58:24
consent? No, I just really hate deleting stuff. But you know what I can get from somewhere else. I need it. I hate keeping it if it's I mean, we're always going to use consent here. This is a single use case you are. Oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  58:39
so you'll have to take your digital hoarding elsewhere.

Unknown Speaker  58:46
There you go. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  58:51
nothing else to do because we're waiting on Jeremy to give a little bit of info for here, right? Like, literally, we cannot apply.

Unknown Speaker  58:59
And then I'm

Unknown Speaker  59:03
assuming you're in agreement, in agreement with that. Yeah, agreed so. And then I have, Oops, got two of those gone. I have popped the URL itself into chanty already so that when you can get that far, you can use

Unknown Speaker  59:24
the URL

Unknown Speaker  59:29
in your What am I looking forward to here somewhere in your application,

Unknown Speaker  59:37
right? And you've seen this already just a couple weeks ago, but Yes,

Unknown Speaker  59:43
yep, and if you get lost, the details on that are

Unknown Speaker  59:49
in the depths of here,

Unknown Speaker  59:53
yep,

Unknown Speaker  59:57
all right, and I'm hoping that sooner rather than later.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
We can

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04
never be involved and have a specific SOP for all this. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
Okay, what else you had listed is that good for today? For now? Yes, that's that is great for today, and it balls in his court. And

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
you know, what else is there to do? Yep, you listed getting my existing CSC client off their nine on one call. No idea what that actually is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:45
getting,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
yeah, getting the first video shot for Thursday, for the sprint. So, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
you went you went quiet. I'm losing you. I don't have you anywhere.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:19
Okay, so speaking of How's that looking for my networking game. Can hear me at all? No, no, I can.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
Yes, I can. Can

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
you hear me now? Yes, I can. Network drops. Have no idea what cause of that. I've already had them come fix it, supposedly, and it's not fixed. But

Unknown Speaker  1:01:45
okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:47
we were, you had said a little list of things. One of them was getting your client off their nine on one call. I'm assuming that's

Unknown Speaker  1:01:55
solved or something. No, it's not. I've been working on it as we've been talking so

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01
okay, and then getting your first video shot for Thursday, for the sprint. So tell me about the sprint. How's that going?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
Well? I mean, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
people are signed up. I think just Jeremy. I mean, there were other people who were interested, but I can follow up with him tomorrow. I just have not had

Unknown Speaker  1:02:34
how much group coaching were you originally planning on doing in the sprint? Was like none. It was all kind of, I hadn't, I didn't promise any,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:45
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:49
So, yeah. So you're just going to build it as you go. Is that the general plan? That's the general plan. And if it's just a handful of folks, email, text, I mean, I don't care. I mean, Telegram group, I don't really care what let's just

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
I'm I'm out here creating chaos, I suppose. But anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
um, I am curious. Is that going to be very time consuming for you for the next while,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:13
getting the videos out? Oh, like, yeah, get keeping everybody on track every day for three weeks, potentially, I don't know, but

Unknown Speaker  1:03:23
I'm gonna have to find a way for it not to be, yeah, okay, hang on. I gotta, I gotta just, can you just wait one second? I gotta hit the Deploy button on on my server, and then I'm gonna switch to my phone and I'm gonna start biking home, and we can keep talking.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
So if you just give me like two minutes, I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
Miller,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
yeah, just a Minute. All

Unknown Speaker  1:04:39
right, can you hear me? How about now? That's good. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:48
so I mean, this is

Unknown Speaker  1:04:51
a side, but not related. I was messaging Josh long about delegation. His basic thing was, well, I don't think it's quite this simple, but it might be this simple. He said.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Is you have probably have some guilt around making other people do things, and you maybe some head trash around other people not doing it as well and

Unknown Speaker  1:05:11
well. The truth is that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:15
I mean

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
not to be obnoxious, but our work together resulted in a better end product because of me than it would have otherwise. But was that actually necessary? So if there's head trash might not actually be because I do it better, or I push things to perfection. It might be that 80% is good enough, but I hate lack of I hate lack of efficiency and I hate lack of perfection.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
So all that to say is,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:49
I think part of this is, you, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:53
being forced to grow, and I can't stay where I've been, because it's not work. It's not going to work.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
On the flip side, you know, with the CRM project, it is highly technical. There's stuff that would not be possible if

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
that 99% of folks would not be able to do,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
even with the proper

Unknown Speaker  1:06:18
Well, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:20
like it takes somebody with my level of experience to find pathways through some of these obstacles,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:28
so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:32
that's not a great answer to your question.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
One takeaway from Scott Shang this morning was like, he shared me his brainstorming GPT, and he's like, you gotta work with this thing to flesh out your ideas and spend more of your ideas, more of your time in high level strategy and innovation, and because that's where you're, that's your superpower, and that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
that's where You gotta, gotta stay.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
And I don't disagree with him.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:09
So

Unknown Speaker  1:07:13
I also

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15
am incredibly demanding right now of myself, which Richard, Richard cautious, says it's a terrible, terrible way to live. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:23
think because of my personality, I'm coo ish enough

Unknown Speaker  1:07:29
that I actually

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
don't mind giving myself heart attacks.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:35
And I'm not. I'm not the conventional

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
narky,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:42
lazy owner kind of guy, but that can change. I mean, not the narky part, but lazier part.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:52
So I guess all that to say,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:57
okay, so I played around with a website, and I was brainstorming with chat, G, P, T, and it's like, oh, no, no, no. This is too complicated. We don't want people don't want six steps. They want three

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
a few times. But anyway, got on, yep. And then I was like, Well, can you build? Like, let's go brainstorm. And then do you have a brief for my developer.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:22
He's like, Yep, here it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:24
And

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
I was just in the process of being like, Okay, let's get on up worker or wherever. And

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
I mean, you're talking about put it in a funnel. I'm like, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38
maybe we should put a put it in a funnel. But, and this is probably me over thinking, but I hate funnels as the main site. It's really difficult to maintain,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:52
and it's not that bad to have somebody push it into WordPress,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:59
which is really a simple thing to delegate, but again,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:07
that that has not should

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09
be a simple thing to delegate, but that has not happened, and with chat, TPT, it makes it so much easier. But

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
I don't know how to answer your question. I feel like sales. I need to protect sales.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:25
I don't think I've been I know I haven't. I have not worried about, oh, what's the right strategic thing to do? I just said, pull the trigger

Unknown Speaker  1:09:35
and it's all going to work somehow. Actually, I'm not, I'm not sure that's a bad thing. I do get the point of delegation and Richard Koch and efficiency,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:47
but

Unknown Speaker  1:09:50
I think pull the trigger. Do it live. Get it done. Do it fast, quick and scrappy. MVP is awesome, especially for who we are and where we're.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
At right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:04
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
I mean, it's simple things like,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:15
I am half inclined

Unknown Speaker  1:10:20
to give you access to my email

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
so that I can tell you,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
go, pull up my chat GPT conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:30
And can you

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
get a dev to roll out X, Y and Z,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:38
and we can actually have somebody working on the website.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
I'm good with that. Any reason why not? No,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:50
let's just do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
I keep hearing, you know, there's so many AI tools out there, and I can't hardly keep track of any of it. Supposedly, there's a way to add teams or people to your chat, GBT, but using your login is fine as well, like either, either way. Oh, I didn't even think of that. I could potentially, I know this month I'm on a high enough plan. I could let me actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
well, I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:26
it's just,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:28
I know this is like, I don't know this is head trash laziness.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:34
I just hate trying to think through.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:37
I hate the process of password sharing. That's what I really hate.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:42
Like,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:44
if I give you access to my email, then you've got

Unknown Speaker  1:11:48
page and access. You've got, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:53
95% of what you need access to. You can get through my email,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
and you can assign passwords if it needs to be delegated, but like the Hey Jen, email needs to be downloaded, pushed into Wistia, or wherever it's going to live, and

Unknown Speaker  1:12:12
then

Unknown Speaker  1:12:14
getting website access and sharing that, Sharing that with the with the contractor, and

Unknown Speaker  1:12:21
anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:23
all that to say, I hate sharing passwords. That's probably one biggest Hangout right now, hilarious. Okay, all right.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:36
Anyway, I guess from your perspective, maybe I need to brainstorm with GPT a little bit on

Unknown Speaker  1:12:43
how do I free up My time?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:51
Interesting? Um, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
I think there's

Unknown Speaker  1:13:02
a i

Unknown Speaker  1:13:08
i have a lot of ideas and thoughts, but I'm not sure which one of them applies. So

Unknown Speaker  1:13:14
for me,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
uh, okay, well, I and of course, I'm not in your shoes. I don't know how you look at it. I think that

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
there's theoretical world, and then there's reality, or however we want to call it,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
there's like,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:38
do I want to be like Richard Koch, yes, yes, I do to get there. Do I need to become more strategic, work smarter, not harder, and learn to be efficient? Yes, yes, I do.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:50
Does that need to be pushed way off into the future when I'm already a millionaire and can start acting like one? No, probably not. That's there's got to be some sort of logical trap in that and yet, are you or me or my teenage son, given where they're at in life right now today, are either of the three of us able to snap our fingers and just offload? No,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:17
particularly me, I can't offload hardly anything. I have one assistant. I can barely afford her right now. I desperately need to keep her because she has been immensely valuable to me for years. And I'd have a

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
second guy, a contractor, who does tracking. If I was to fire either one of those, I would pick up another 45 to 60 hours worth of work a week that I would have to do, and I can't, there's no way I can do that. And so, like, that's that kind of Indic there are little

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
pools, you know, next to the ocean, so to speak, that efficiency matters, and they work.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Sure, but then, is it an automatic corollary that you or I or anybody can then offload everything

Unknown Speaker  1:15:08
else? No that there is a context director

Unknown Speaker  1:15:14
that keeps you and I and my son as a random example from turning into Richard Cox today. So I'm thinking that. I'm thinking that for you and we both,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:27
when something is identified as important, contextually important,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:37
it has to get first focus, like, whether I like it or not, I'm at the point right now, or everything I do

Unknown Speaker  1:15:45
has got to either be making money eating the making of money soon. That includes my interactions with you on all all this stuff. Uh, because I have a million other things I could do that might make me money in two or three or four or five months, and I can't, I can't even touch those today.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:03
So within that context of priority,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:07
if it becomes apparent that there is a step to be taken that matters, that can be handed off to AI or an assistant or somebody new on Upwork, and there is time, resources and capabilities to do the handoff, then, yes, by all means, do it like you know. Let's pretend for a minute that you had handed the postcard design job to me, the you know, the one we were talking about yesterday, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:37
I I probably wouldn't have crossed my mind to take that to chat. DBT, I think he said McGee told you to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
And if I had gone and done that on my own, I would have wasted a week on that, right? So the

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
fact that something brought to you both hours and hours and hours, but not everything can be handed to chat. GPT, and not everything can be handed to to a contractor. So I think that even while we're on the endless pursuit of efficiency and delegation, that there is just a certain juncture at which time and money goes down the drain on the personal level anyway, like even while delegating or even while working, we still have to spend that 10%

Unknown Speaker  1:17:29
does that help at all

Unknown Speaker  1:17:32
well? And what it means is,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
yeah, or

Unknown Speaker  1:17:42
I don't have to sit I can choose set up each sipping martinis, taking my grand old time,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
or

Unknown Speaker  1:17:53
save 90%

Unknown Speaker  1:17:57
and push the gas pump all the way down to the floor. Hopefully I Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
audio is breaking up just a little,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14
okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:16
I mean, yeah, so my point was,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:19
I mean, you can either sit on a beach and sit martinis with your 90% time, or you can reinvest it and launch 10x faster, which I feel like is what we're doing. Yeah, I agree, I and I agree that it's a good idea and that it's what we're doing.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:37
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40
uh, that was a

Unknown Speaker  1:18:43
very convoluted answer to your question of,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:47
I'm still not sure how I'm going to get my agent stuff rendered by tomorrow

Unknown Speaker  1:18:54
or by Thursday morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:56
Now keep in mind, I only need one video. First one.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:02
probably me just a tiny bit. You already have a chat GPT script, and you need to feed it into agent to turn it into a vocalization. No, the one thing I need before that is

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
I really need to cross reference

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17
and pressure testing and make sure that

Unknown Speaker  1:19:21
what it's teaching is literally what was in the training

Unknown Speaker  1:19:28
and output by chat GPT that you're using for the lesson.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
Yes, take the chat GPT transcript

Unknown Speaker  1:19:38
and basically fact check it. Yep. Do Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:48
I mean, there you go,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
okay, and that's like, that's a good example. Even if I wanted to help you, I don't think, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Enough about sales, and I know nothing about the thing you're referencing or drawing from. I can't take that off your hands for you, and I don't think anybody, but you can do that

Unknown Speaker  1:20:10
the fact check. I think you're right. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
Well, the odd thing is, I don't understand,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:18
I really don't understand this, Jonathan, but

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
even

Unknown Speaker  1:20:23
I don't know people who can move at my pace,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:28
even somebody, even the guy, even the trainer,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33
I still think I can bet it faster than he can.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
I maybe not. You are indeed a pretty fast mover, I agree.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:43
So

Unknown Speaker  1:20:46
anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:48
so potential next step to offload is, I think I have at least part of the 911, off my back. Side note, my brother just emailed me and one of his client sites is down to which I said, Well, how bad is it? I should have asked him, How much do you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07
pay? But

Unknown Speaker  1:21:09
anyway, and his junior dad wasn't able to handle it. Said, No, so I got to drop off good, because they don't know what to do. They don't know what to do. Okay, I don't know what. I don't know what, where the knowledge gap is. I don't know why they can't figure it out. But anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
so

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
I gotta draw but bottom line is, I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:33
chat GPT and I had a conversation about whether the website actually is important, I think for the sake of credibility, lending credibility to cold SMS, it is and as a basic lead capture and authority piece.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:50
And I think if I send you the brief,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:54
I mean even, even some of this stuff like literally sending you the brief, go find a dev, and here's the Wistia link, and I can get you admin access to the to the site, and you can go find somebody still

Unknown Speaker  1:22:07
takes five to 15 minutes of my time, and today I just didn't have it, yeah, and very, very well understood I live there too.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:17
So okay, well, I think to a certain extent it's keep putting one foot in front of the other, and we'll get to the light on the other end of the tunnel at some point.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27
Yeah, we will. We will. All right, all right. Appreciate it. Jonathan,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:34
yep, bye, thanks, bye for now. Yeah.
