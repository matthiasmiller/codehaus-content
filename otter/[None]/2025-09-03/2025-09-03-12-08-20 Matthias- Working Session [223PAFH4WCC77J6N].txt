Like, literally, what is this? So let's try this again. Like, I have the contact ID, I have the location ID,

Speaker 1  00:17
like, what? Like, it's not like, I literally. It's not working, so let's get over to twist man.

We'll get logged in here and sure and let's do a i a new request, and we're going to get request, I'm going to copy the link, and then going to add authorization error token. And we're going to send it Well, fair enough version header, so put in version, accept application JSON. All right, let's try again. That is so bizarre, because it's working from there. That is, that is the most bizarre thing, okay, but if I go back over here again, lock server, live server, like, literally, I have no idea what I'm missing here. I have the location ID, I have the token, unless this needs a bearer in front of it, which it shouldn't, but bearer, bearer, no, it doesn't send API request. It says it does not have the required parameters, services, location, contact, Id headers. Headers include all that I can't. I just literally can't. I can't do it. And as a side note, I'm going to trigger the crazy.
