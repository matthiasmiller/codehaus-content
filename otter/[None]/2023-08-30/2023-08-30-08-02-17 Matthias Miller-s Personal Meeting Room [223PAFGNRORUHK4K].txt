Unknown Speaker  00:27
What do you drew here tomorrow morning Are you been

Matthias Miller  00:36
a Matthias

Unknown Speaker  00:37
morning drew mark

Matthias Miller  00:42
all right. Well I gotta admit I feel just the text

Unknown Speaker  00:48
here I just see your

Unknown Speaker  00:52
email here

Matthias Miller  01:05
some CDs do not have succeeded let me take a look

Matthias Miller  01:37
think probably the reason why you're getting that warning for ABC and vinyl or ABC and vinyl structures is because well probably the first place I would check is to see whether you've got the FTI financial allocation set up for those districts because that's how we determine which accounting company to map to for those those skews

Speaker 1  02:14
but we're also seeing it on a lot of shit times well

Unknown Speaker  02:21
okay

Matthias Miller  02:24
let me check something here let me let me see if I can create a

Matthias Miller  02:33
stable overly eager warning

Unknown Speaker  02:42
me

Matthias Miller  02:49
this is going to take just a little bit of time out

Matthias Miller  03:08
we see big and find out we're ready

Matthias Miller  03:21
you used to counting Okay so

Speaker 2  03:26
I've got well we're getting to

Unknown Speaker  03:37
the I'm guessing you didn't

Unknown Speaker  03:46
write

Matthias Miller  03:55
to stream it's going to count from GL account to see

Unknown Speaker  04:08
what counts

Unknown Speaker  04:19
yeah

Unknown Speaker  04:26
yeah

Matthias Miller  04:32
do this

Speaker 2  04:35
I know they just they just had a price tag

Unknown Speaker  04:54
Yeah, we've tried to

Unknown Speaker  04:59
do Look I'll just tell the guys get ready

Matthias Miller  05:09
it looks to me like

Unknown Speaker  05:14
great thank you

Unknown Speaker  05:19
skew actives let's do this yet

Unknown Speaker  05:51
Okay

Matthias Miller  07:02
let's do this actually in Smite

Matthias Miller  07:41
do we have that sounds right so some of these accounts

Unknown Speaker  08:19
you see

Unknown Speaker  08:32
is

Speaker 1  08:37
there yes breaking it up just a little bit because I said miscellaneous miscellaneous

Speaker 3  08:52
human reality that was a joke specifically created something really cute that was

Unknown Speaker  09:05
supposed to go to the next person just dumped something

Matthias Miller  09:48
well okay and then this is probably because

Matthias Miller  10:13
Okay then then we are needing one of the next things we're needing is an FDI channel allocation record for vital structures in ABC

Matthias Miller  10:46
if we should I mean we should district

Unknown Speaker  10:49
the oh

Matthias Miller  10:53
okay why is this one not so we want to go to ship time next I want to do that

Matthias Miller  11:31
This is district skews GL account this is

Unknown Speaker  11:57
oh

Matthias Miller  12:03
you don't have a well

Matthias Miller  12:25
so there's a few issues one we shouldn't show the warning if there's no reception date that's probably the biggest thing

Matthias Miller  12:52
so those are the ones not received which means we're not going to we're just going to include

Matthias Miller  13:03
this one has a reception date this is Ohio Indiana Ohio

Matthias Miller  13:25
so that over here this warning right here

Matthias Miller  14:07
okay so then let me I think we do this

Matthias Miller  14:28
okay, so I think I think if you create your FTI financial allocation records, everything should be in a position to be able to re enable the warning as long as we ignore POS they don't have reception date which is something Josh needs to do. So Josh needs to fix a bug but would you would you guys need to do is that You have financial allocation for Indiana, and I'm sorry, Ohio.

Speaker 4  15:06
So would that be? The reception is for what is included in that allocation? So the all prior to

Unknown Speaker  15:16
that allocation? Sorry, what was that?

Speaker 4  15:21
Was that that reception date? Is that the date of the allocation?

Unknown Speaker  15:28
That we do? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  15:29
The reception date is used to determine which allocation record we use. So.

Matthias Miller  15:43
Is that your question?

Speaker 4  15:45
Yeah. But what I'm trying to get a hold on is this is this for, you know, if the allocation date is in the past, you know, let's say for

Unknown Speaker  15:59
there for

Unknown Speaker  16:01
August.

Unknown Speaker  16:04
What about in September?

Matthias Miller  16:06
Yeah, it'll use the, it'll use the latest as of now. So. Yeah, if we're in September, it'll just find the it'll it'll find the one dated? The most recent one dated 830? Or before? So if you have one for seven, one, we use that if you have one for but if you would have one for a 31? We would not use that.

Speaker 4  16:30
Yeah. So use the latest one prior to to the data that,

Unknown Speaker  16:36
Pio?

Matthias Miller  16:40
They're good. So are you thinking you would just

Unknown Speaker  16:42
go back to my five, three long film?

Unknown Speaker  16:46
Whatever you did? Yeah, we

Unknown Speaker  16:48
can do that.

Speaker 1  16:49
And you know what, when he's done there, right, as far as setting those just that

Unknown Speaker  16:56
right there. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  16:59
Just replicating

Speaker 1  17:03
with with ignoring the ones that haven't been received. That was the issue on ship time. Why we're getting the warning. Ship time.

Matthias Miller  17:13
Okay, correct. Yep.

Speaker 4  17:17
So is this those accounts right there that are listed right there, those would have been the only ones that would not have been receiving warnings?

Matthias Miller  17:31
Well, there were. The other issue is that I created this report to just look at here, let me do this.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
Well,

Matthias Miller  17:52
I created this mapping report to take a look at just named comparisons. But the other issue was, we can't see it here. But the other issue is that we are actually still relying on this, on this field being filled in. So I just modified this report to update to force linking between the accounting report and the GL and the vendor invoice GL account.

Unknown Speaker  18:31
Now, are you still seeing any last Wednesday, Drew and Aaron, did they audited between the accounting GL accounts and the IMS GL accounts and believe that everything matched? The two lists match perfectly are perfectly in sync with each other. Are you seeing any of them? That are not the reason I'm asking is Josh mentioned this morning that even on ship time, he was still seeing some that? What did he say that? He was still seeing skews with GL accounts that did not have the matching aren't associated GL Account financial side.

Matthias Miller  19:23
I think what I just did here to fix the underlying records, fix that problem.

Speaker 1  19:29
Okay, so from what you're seeing as we speak the mapping between the two tables, accounting and IMS is is matching up 100%?

Unknown Speaker  19:44
Yes.

Speaker 1  19:46
Okay. And then moving forward. Our plan is to just it'll just have to be a communication thing where it's added on the SKU data sheet, uploaded to IMS at the same time added on On the accounting side the exact same thing just we don't foresee as any we shouldn't be adding more than one a GL Account between now and the end of the year but I think it's

Matthias Miller  20:13
yes and be sure to fill in this this account as well set this field under to formally link between the two banks

Speaker 5  20:31
we still want to list our excuse right I think we're still wondering

Unknown Speaker  20:37
oh

Matthias Miller  20:40
let's take a look at the skews and see which active skews I'm gonna just say this year for memory sake if nothing else

Matthias Miller  20:57
let's do

Unknown Speaker  21:10
this is

Unknown Speaker  21:18
well

Matthias Miller  21:54
let's do this

Unknown Speaker  22:08
yes

Unknown Speaker  22:14
Gam Gam to pie chart

Matthias Miller  22:33
accounts

Unknown Speaker  22:45
box how to bundle

Unknown Speaker  22:57
it wasn't Ali

Unknown Speaker  23:07
we aiming right there

Unknown Speaker  23:44
no two

Matthias Miller  24:08
okay Here are a list of all the ones all the active skews that do not have this is the

Matthias Miller  24:40
here are the ones that

Matthias Miller  24:49
these must be active SKUs that are tied to inactive GL accounts let me to

Unknown Speaker  25:02
actually change this

Speaker 3  25:18
generic I hope it's hope it's all those shouldn't be because

Unknown Speaker  25:30
well some of them are being

Matthias Miller  25:33
sued they

Unknown Speaker  25:55
Ah

Matthias Miller  26:34
okay so we have to do one more thing let's make it nice

Matthias Miller  26:58
okay so we have the following skews which you can also see here may also

Matthias Miller  27:35
Okay, here are we've got SKUs that are tied to inactive ledger accounts

Unknown Speaker  27:48
and these need to be cleaned

Speaker 5  27:53
so there's a setting somewhere on each SKU. There's a handful, probably like I'm gonna guess 20 SKUs that are generics use. There's a setting somewhere. And it looks to me like most of those are generic. Can you can you give me a report that shows all generic skews?

Unknown Speaker  28:18
Yeah, right there.

Matthias Miller  28:20
It was generic. Okay. Let's do this.

Speaker 5  28:25
Or either just show it on that report that you had generic or not

Matthias Miller  28:38
so should these GL accounts just be blanked out then if they're generic skews?

Speaker 5  28:46
Well, I I think I think we'll have to get rid of these generic skews. And so the generic skews are only in a car says and they're not on our SKU. datasheet if that makes sense. Yeah. So so we can't really touch those from our side and I think if we could just recreate them here, the ones that we're still using and the ones that we're not using we'll just get rid of or marked me to active

Matthias Miller  29:19
so let me do one more thing. Let's swordplay you name just so it's way easier to track and then we only really care about

Matthias Miller  29:49
really care about these

Matthias Miller  30:00
Do you drew, do you want to link to this report? Or do you want to chase this down? Or?

Speaker 4  30:12
Yeah, there's the link to it. Or as Excel file would work

Speaker 3  30:24
some of those are ones where we create a sub, and that's still to the parent account. And so it's

Matthias Miller  30:35
it's okay, so those probably are the ones that Josh was seeing. So everything I can tell everything else is fine. I can tell everything else is squared away.

Matthias Miller  31:06
All right, mapping for this. This is done. Yep, you're right. Here and those are generic skews. Oh, did you want should we put together a report of

Matthias Miller  31:29
I don't know how often they were used in the last

Unknown Speaker  31:33
what timeframe?

Speaker 5  31:35
Like the last if, like the thought there was if we're not the generic skews that haven't been used in the last three months, we can probably just mark them inactive and call it a day. But if we're still using them, we'll create another one to

Unknown Speaker  31:55
work at that. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  32:01
There's a big we should actually be let's let's go again, I can I can pretty easily give you so we're going to do purchase order.

Unknown Speaker  32:25
up

Matthias Miller  32:27
so this would be not Pio canceled group by the SKU PIO and your reception date.

Matthias Miller  32:56
If we could go ahead then and sorted by

Speaker 5  33:21
those are just the ones that that have inactive GL accounts. But what about what about all the other generic skews that we still have? Sure.

Matthias Miller  33:51
I mean, these are all the generic accounts but I think typically I mean typically what would happen on a generic account is that on the on the verification report, you would have to manually fill in this SKU.

Speaker 1  34:16
These are typically used by Dwayne's office or more so in the past, right,

Speaker 5  34:21
but yeah, okay, so, so we when we created this generic thing, we had to create a purchase order in order to pay an invoice. And since then, that has changed so that we don't have to create a purchase order to pay an invoice. So a lot of these there's no need to keep, and we can get rid of them. Yeah, so that's why we wanted them sorted by the reception days last reception there. So that the ones that haven't haven't used this year will just

Unknown Speaker  34:59
calendar I buy

Matthias Miller  35:05
a little low telling selling things we buy sounds like good clean up okay I will we will send you an updated one with that report link will still show this I guess yeah

Matthias Miller  35:32
I mean we can even do one better I can even do one better for you to save yourself a little bit of time but

Matthias Miller  36:28
All right, so

Unknown Speaker  36:33
yeah

Matthias Miller  36:37
if you want to then you can use the deactivated select deactivate selected well I can't I couldn't spell it right

Matthias Miller  36:51
deactivate selected skews if you want to do a mass deactivation good

Speaker 5  37:04
the ones that are at the bottom are the ones that are creating problems right

Matthias Miller  37:09
the ones that these these ones at the bottom are fine they're they're inactive skews it doesn't matter okay and then the ones at the top these are the ones that are active that are either generic or they're mapped to an inactive

Unknown Speaker  37:30
they are generic yes

Matthias Miller  37:33
they're either generic or Well they're all they are all generic yeah they're all the generic ones some of them are okay like this one these matte but then these if you want to keep these we should just blank out the GL account setting on here I think

Unknown Speaker  37:56
they have been used fairly recently it looks like

Unknown Speaker  38:05
well just means

Unknown Speaker  38:07
credit definitely use that for

Unknown Speaker  38:13
not just names that

Speaker 4  38:16
GL Account dated is that that particular account is now a parent account

Unknown Speaker  38:23
account with a mentor so we just

Speaker 5  38:24
want to create that on the skew data sheet. So either either use a new a whole new GL a whole news you are then just open it in assess and uncheck the generic and at the same time create it exactly like that in

Unknown Speaker  38:43
the SU data

Unknown Speaker  38:44
so that our upload matches that so this gives

Unknown Speaker  38:47
you what you need to resolve that

Unknown Speaker  38:49
looks good Cool. Well,

Unknown Speaker  38:58
does that take care of number one

Matthias Miller  39:01
we got three number one

Unknown Speaker  39:07
two that is

Speaker 1  39:11
weird said that's not earth at it. I don't think it's it's basically only a bank that has the aesthetics on our financial

Unknown Speaker  39:34
there were are

Unknown Speaker  39:39
those are sub subtypes.

Matthias Miller  39:43
Other subtypes I see

Unknown Speaker  40:07
I'm

Matthias Miller  40:15
bad effects core accounting. And that's going to require some dialogue. It's one of those things that looks pretty simple but

Matthias Miller  40:34
you just want to get to show up in all caps on the income statement and balance sheet.

Unknown Speaker  40:40
That were

Speaker 1  40:41
Yeah, what were the reason is all of our What is it the first two? Like, is it all types and subtypes? So then, you know, like, if you look at the balance sheet All right, yeah. Yeah, just

Unknown Speaker  41:02
the way of handling

Unknown Speaker  41:04
sanctions

Speaker 4  41:09
we first ran into it thinking it might have something to do with the mapping issue.

Matthias Miller  41:56
All right, I've noted it in here. And let me also just.

Matthias Miller  42:19
Okay, I don't know that there's, well, this will this will show up whenever we do the better sections, which I think is a little bit down the list of what Joe's working on. Jill's working on cash flows and what I mean first things first is asset management, and then cash flows, and then the better sections for income statement and balance sheet. So we're, we're still hoping for the end of the end of the month for that, but that's kind of where it's at.

Unknown Speaker  42:47
I'm

Matthias Miller  42:49
putting FDA information to accounting. Have I resolved the issues at drink? And I've been doing this I think I did some so I certainly fixed one of the issues should be resolved ready to be tested how to proceed with testing.

Unknown Speaker  43:12
I mean, you

Unknown Speaker  43:19
well.

Matthias Miller  43:27
Think.

Matthias Miller  43:38
This opens up a little bit of a Pandora's box with

Matthias Miller  43:48
I think to continue with FTA testing, we need to give you a way to historically. Well, okay, going forward, we will simply reconciled with accounting every day, which means that I think it's going to be close enough to the actual date of the event, that it's going to be good enough and it avoids the issue of accounting numbers shifting too much in that timeframe.

Matthias Miller  44:23
Although we had some conversation about setting the date back as early as we can. Screening these transactions with a historical date is as close to the event as possible but not prior to an accounting or FGI period closure.

Matthias Miller  44:53
think Josh was hoping for Robert.

Unknown Speaker  44:58
Hey, man either saw

Matthias Miller  45:02
Josh's suggestion super simple workaround, you wouldn't have to that we can just the biggest issue is as we're testing, okay. We don't want these.

Unknown Speaker  45:14
Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  45:22
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:27
The, we want these showing up. We don't want to overcomplicate the ongoing process for the sake of initial testing. We want to do what we can to avoid prolonging. Testing we need to do here

Matthias Miller  45:52
in the long term, marker Drew, do you guys have a problem with simply the daily reconciliation between Oh, boy, power, with the daily reconciliation between accounting and and the rest of the system? Are you wanting it to, for example, if somebody says, if somebody comes back a week later and says, I delivered this building a week ago, do you want us to enter a transaction dated one week prior?

Unknown Speaker  46:29
And

Matthias Miller  46:36
you have historical numbers, but inflation.

Speaker 1  46:43
Well, this brings up and I think you're talking about the same thing that, Josh, that we talked with Josh this morning about when he was talking about the accounts payable impact about the ability to do historical information or just update historical information. And I think I think it's the same thing that that scenario was. Josh said, we can on supplier invoices jar said we will was planning to use the creation date as the date and impacts account. So you get an invoice today when someone enters an invoice today that stated August 27. But it does impact accounting until the 30th. Because that's the creation date. We said, No, we need that to be the date on the invoice. And he said, Oh, okay, that brings up a host of other things. He said, The Delta type transactions worked very well then I need to talk to buyers. And I think you're because he then said, Well, what if you have it then then we went deeper and said, well? Do we? Are we ever going to have invoices or reception dates that change where we're saying, Oh, we mistakenly entered this invoice for the for the 30th or maybe like September 5, but it actually should have been entered in August and impact financial reports in August. So if we we talk what happens if we change that date. And if Josh proposal was to keep accounting clean it week, backdated. It would basically delete the previous accounting transactions in September and then recreate them are always but he said that brings up rather than he asked, Do we have the same situation with buildings where we might change the build date? We said well, I'll need to talk to the fires about handling that so. Not sure if I'm making any sense or not. Does that I think that is the same. Same question you're asking on buildings versus indoors. Correct

Speaker 1  49:56
the word is, is that should should we just wait to do it Testing until we do we hold off until on testing this until Aplia Joshua toe sharp

Matthias Miller  50:40
I kind of wonder if we need to revamp how we're doing the

Matthias Miller  50:55
biggest because with with a billing impact this would be dated on the build date this would be dated on the delivery date

Matthias Miller  51:11
that you would read it

Matthias Miller  51:18
and then And then similarly with

Matthias Miller  51:27
it was over impact

Matthias Miller  51:38
you know, I had briefly talked about this, but

Unknown Speaker  51:42
I know that we

Matthias Miller  51:55
as much as I hate to say this, I think I think we need to

Unknown Speaker  52:12
yeah, yes,

Speaker 1  52:14
yeah. You're saying we need to hold off on testing until until after that

Matthias Miller  52:19
really? Yes, I mean kind of thing. So, yeah. As much as I hate to say.

Speaker 1  52:39
So nothing. So here's, here's what another thing, we're one of the things pointing to kids. Just enter assure a month's worth of peaks

Unknown Speaker  52:55
Tuesday, Monday on labor demand,

Unknown Speaker  52:59
worst of

Speaker 1  53:01
Oct expenses, the materials, the labor and the overhead using our new GL account, so that we can. So most of that information is currently going through our IMS, that verification process. We're getting invoices. And so thank you, Mark, I appreciate it. And then some of it like payroll is still going through QuickBooks. So

Unknown Speaker  53:29
yeah, pretty good.

Speaker 1  53:30
We want to take that information and just piecemeal that information together and manually entered into the accounting system using our new GL account structure. So we basically have an expense report showing a month worth of expenses so that we can use those totals then coming off of those like, what would be the in the finished goods inventory? The

Matthias Miller  54:04
production labor production,

Speaker 1  54:05
all right, see what we've incurred and then have the ability to apply actual costs incurred to buildings build in that time frame. So we at the NT, we should have a month worth of buildings with actual an accurate FTI cause there's nothing that would keep us from doing that. Currently is there now

Unknown Speaker  54:38
can you show us how what's an easy way to or is there an easy way to at least export

Speaker 1  54:49
export the information on the accounts payable say they just wanted to touch these possibly imported into the accounting system or even just exported into like all of the on all of these expenses that would have on the INS like that we've gone through that verification before. Perfect timing.

Matthias Miller  55:13
Yeah, there Hang on one second I'm gonna have to switch my MD you might have to move closer to becoming one second

Unknown Speaker  55:42
okay, so if you

Unknown Speaker  56:01
so I'm showing

Unknown Speaker  56:02
on on Monday I ordered

Unknown Speaker  56:12
Okay, let me just reset

Speaker 2  56:19
wonder if I was still looking at the the Okay, great good

Matthias Miller  56:38
none of this is exactly right.

Unknown Speaker  56:57
Okay

Matthias Miller  57:03
that's why you can't, it's in the end and I have anything I'm not sure why, but it should be that

Unknown Speaker  57:21
regardless of whether they're paid or not,

Unknown Speaker  57:25
we have to make sure the status is repeated, whatever. But

Unknown Speaker  57:36
anything that was approved for others.

Speaker 1  57:38
I think as long as we know, do you know how to get here? This? As long as we know how to get there, I think we can determine what settings then that we need? Or is this is this a report that Drew can access?

Matthias Miller  57:53
It says yes.

Matthias Miller  58:07
Think Dwayne would also be a good person to get in touch with and this. Okay. He's the one that put this report together and yeah.

Speaker 1  58:21
But then taking this into accounting, there's no. The easiest way is to just manually enter these or is there a better way to do that?

Matthias Miller  58:38
I mean, if you wanted to, you could do a transaction import. You could put together a spreadsheet, if that's easier for you. And then do a transaction import. That

Speaker 1  58:50
same as what what I did with Ben, way back? You started this. Okay. Yeah, I think that gives us what we need here then. Yeah, Dwayne might be able to help us on this. Anything else through that you'd have from Matthias? Or you?

Speaker 4  59:16
Are the all those transactions that were created by trying to do the FGI reconciliation there in that shut time company? Are those needing to be cleared out? Or does that material that you need to have there so that so that you can figure out what all went wrong and how to fix it or?

Matthias Miller  59:41
Well, I kind of feel like this hurt. Let's leave it for now. And let's decide. Once we decide how we want these transactions to work with decided that what we should do with them. I suspect we'll want to just delete them and start over a bit

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
Yeah, I don't really see a need to do anything with it until then.

Speaker 1  1:00:11
The other the other thing, well, sorry. The other thing I wanted to ask with is, is I think for us it might make sense to just skip the one o'clock meeting and maybe what do you usually do three to 330 Wow taking call, do something like three to four to give us time to quit, we're hoping that but we've got to have our accounts receivable process outlined. I mean, unless you're unless you tell me that with you being out you wouldn't work on it before next

Matthias Miller  1:01:02
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine with that. Something I do want to mention is that I'm going to be out of town. Well, Monday we have a Labor Day and then the following Wednesday, on the 13th I'm going to be out of the office I might be able to actually depending how I do it, I might still be able to do that. That some of those morning calls I am gonna have to see what how to do those how my day is gonna stack up with travel but but yeah, as far as as far as today, I don't have a problem with that. It can do you can do that. It can bump doing back a little bit and I've got plenty of stuff to work on as far as I've got a whole bunch of catch up and stuff to do plenty plenty to work on themselves

Speaker 1  1:02:01
