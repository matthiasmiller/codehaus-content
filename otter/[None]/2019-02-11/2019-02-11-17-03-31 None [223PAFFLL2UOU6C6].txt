three reasons that that we don't delegate.

Unknown Speaker  00:06
One of the challenges that I often hear from people

Speaker 1  00:08
is that they don't delegate because

Unknown Speaker  00:13
I like that kind of opening. But

Speaker 1  00:14
many people find it difficult to delegate because they don't trust other people to do the job. But many times there's actually a deeper

Unknown Speaker  00:23
reasons going on and and that's because they don't actually know how to effectively delegate

Speaker 1  00:26
and there's some simple tools that can help you to learn how to delegate

Speaker 1  00:30
more effectively. So here are three reasons why people don't delegate effectively. Reason number one, I don't like this at all.
