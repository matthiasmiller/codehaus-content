Speaker 1  00:02
You're micromanaging. Even if none of your team members talk to you about it.

Speaker 1  00:12
One of the big challenges as a major challenge for

Unknown Speaker  00:15
for leaders is to is, is

Unknown Speaker  00:18
the temptation to micromanage.

Speaker 1  00:23
Anybody working under somebody who micromanages knows that it's not a fun place to be, it feels like they're breathing down your neck, they're dictating your every move, you feel like you have to look over your shoulder and see if you're if you're doing everything, okay. And it's a really uncomfortable

Speaker 1  00:37
position to be in, however, for many for many of us, and once we move into leadership position, we end up micromanaging. Now, here's the question,

Speaker 1  00:48
how do you know and how can you tell when you're micromanaging? Well, let's start with a simple definition. A simple understanding

Unknown Speaker  00:55
of what effective delegation is.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
Many people think that effective delegation is essentially telling somebody

Speaker 1  01:01
else don't do something. It's like a go for like a

Speaker 1  01:07
little mini goals and tasks for you.

Unknown Speaker  01:13
And they come in and they sharpen your pencil you

Speaker 1  01:15
you say go take this mail out to the mailbox, Nico do it, and they and they execute simple tasks. This is

Unknown Speaker  01:23
certainly a form

Speaker 1  01:24
of delegation. But it's not a very effective form of delegation

Unknown Speaker  01:29
delegation requires you to take a

Speaker 1  01:30
step back and not just look at the so what are not just look at the specific tasks, but work as a specific outcome, that you're looking to achieve the goals that you wanted the mailbox, it's not just about getting getting payments, getting checks in the mail. That's about it. I'm sorry, I meant to say that's not just a log out to the mailbox that's making sure that the checks reach their vendors on their due date.

Unknown Speaker  01:58
Now, when you when you

Speaker 1  02:00
when you complain to somebody at somebody else's, they've not effectively

Speaker 1  02:08
to do your mailbox and drop these things in. That's okay. discuss that

Unknown Speaker  02:15
in order

Unknown Speaker  02:15
to delegate effectively, you

Speaker 1  02:16
have to be able to separate though from the how. And he said micromanaging is simply

Speaker 1  02:23
is simply a form of delegation that focuses

Unknown Speaker  02:28
on the how

Unknown Speaker  02:32
it focuses on controlling the

Speaker 1  02:33
process for the specific outcome that you want. Let's take a look at a couple of couple more examples.

Speaker 1  02:40
Let's say that you need to get your accounting system up to date. And you need to need to have all of your your transactions entered into

Unknown Speaker  02:47
into your financial

Speaker 1  02:50
financial into your accounting system. So you guys your team member, there is a step by step instructions on how to manually

Unknown Speaker  02:57
and how to

Speaker 1  03:00
how to find the paper bank statements that you filed and how to manually enter these into the system.

Unknown Speaker  03:09
And you give them these instructions for

Speaker 1  03:10
how to accomplish it that's controlling the How to then take a take a moment step back and look at what

Unknown Speaker  03:19
you actually want would you actually wanted to the end of the day

Speaker 1  03:22
is you want accurate numbers and you an accurate reporting in your accounting system,

Speaker 1  03:27
you give that you find the clear outcome for your team member. And let me tell you this, if they're younger than 30 years of age, they're not going to manually enter these views of the piece of paper, they're going to figure out what it takes to import these transactions from an online banking system, and how to ensure accuracy reconcile and they're going to provide you with accurate reports in a fraction of the time,

Speaker 1  03:50
they might even tell you that you need to start hiring a bookkeeper or a

Unknown Speaker  03:56
firm that's much more efficient

Unknown Speaker  03:57
at these types of

Speaker 1  03:59
activities that you are in house, they might present you with a cost comparison of what it cost you to to do this in house versus what it cost you to outsource it to another to another company.

Unknown Speaker  04:15
When you control the process.

Speaker 1  04:20
You end up micromanaging. The only way to effectively empower people is to be able to step back and to tell the be able to tell the difference between the the white and the specific outcome that you're trying to achieve. And the how, which is the way that you're going to achieve it. Many times when you're trying to dictate the how and you're trying to dictate the specific steps, what you're actually doing is you have an articulated outcome that you're trying to enforce. There's a specific thing, it might be a need for accuracy. It might be a need for

Unknown Speaker  04:55
for for feedback. You might be

Speaker 1  04:56
a need for communication, you have an uncommunicative need, that you're trying to integrate you're using today. And you define

Speaker 1  05:05
the how the steps of the process in order to make that happen.

Speaker 1  05:10
So how can you tell when you're micromanaging? Or it's it's as simple as this, look at the things that you're handing off to you to your team members and engage them? How are your team members operating on outcomes

Unknown Speaker  05:25
and the results that you're looking

Speaker 1  05:26
for? And how much are they operating on the on the steps so the 123 pieces of this is how I would do it.

Speaker 1  05:36
If you don't know the answer to that yourself. Ask your team members have a conversation with them. Ask them Do you Mia Mia dictating the process and are you using the process that's most natural to you

Unknown Speaker  05:51
want to make one more observation.

Speaker 1  05:54
Different team members will prefer different styles of leadership and different styles

Unknown Speaker  05:58
of delegation.

Speaker 1  06:01
The most important thing that you can do for your team member is giving them the style of leadership that is right for that

Unknown Speaker  06:07
some team members will resist you creating the structure for them.

Speaker 1  06:11
Some team members will will want some kind of structure in place and what the liberty to enhance it. And some team members are, frankly want you to be able to define the process work with them to improve the process as needed today, what they really want is they want a clearly defined process that they can follow.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Give the wrong kind of

Speaker 1  06:35
structure, the wrong kind of leadership is wrong kind of person, you'll end up with all kinds of results.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
Here's what I want you to do

Speaker 1  06:44
find a team member. But first of all, now, just let's just keep the one thing

Unknown Speaker  06:50
I want you to do today. I want

Speaker 1  06:52
you to evaluate what kinds of tasks you're handing off and whether you're dictating the process or whether you're dictating the outcome

Speaker 1  07:02
and not dictating. But whether you're you're dictating the process or whether you're defining the outcome

Speaker 1  07:11
and I want you to ask your team members. I said just one thing. So I think I'm just going to next that

Speaker 1  07:19
you'll find that as you continue to define outcomes, your team members really will engage and they'll begin looking

Unknown Speaker  07:27
when you give them permission to find

Speaker 1  07:28
ways to improve upon what you've done and to do it better than you they will engage and they'll find that you'll find them buying into what you're doing and you'll find them improving the systems and processes that you already have in place.

Unknown Speaker  07:43
Until next time.
