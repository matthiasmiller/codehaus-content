Unknown Speaker  00:02
How to get

Unknown Speaker  00:02
over the fear of delegating.

Unknown Speaker  00:08
A lot of people

Unknown Speaker  00:09
struggle with

Unknown Speaker  00:10
the fear of delegation.

Unknown Speaker  00:13
There's a lot of reasons for this.

Speaker 1  00:16
First of all, many people, when they get to get around to delegating, they know much more than, than anybody else, and they know all the potential pitfalls. And they,

Speaker 1  00:29
they know what mistakes are going to cost the company money, or the organization money, they're going to know what what

Unknown Speaker  00:36
what are the important factors that will cause a city.

Unknown Speaker  00:41
For some people,

Unknown Speaker  00:41
there's a fear of delegating, because

Speaker 1  00:44
they know that if if they delegate effectively,

Unknown Speaker  00:48
they may become replaceable,

Unknown Speaker  00:51
you only become replaceable,

Speaker 1  00:55
and one condition if if you replicate yourself without increasing

Unknown Speaker  00:59
the value of what you provide.

Unknown Speaker  01:03
And this key concept

Speaker 1  01:04
of understanding not only the value of your time now that the value of

Unknown Speaker  01:09
your time in the future is one of the most critical is a

Speaker 1  01:12
critical piece in understanding how to delegate more

Unknown Speaker  01:15
effectively.

Unknown Speaker  01:19
Here's the common common thing that I hear

Speaker 1  01:21
it, I don't have time to delegate, I'm too busy,

Unknown Speaker  01:25
and I can do it faster

Speaker 1  01:26
and better than anybody else. This is a very short sighted perspective

Unknown Speaker  01:32
Do you want to delegate effectively,

Unknown Speaker  01:33
you have to

Speaker 1  01:34
understand that you need to increase the value of your time

Speaker 1  01:37
to increase the value of your time, you need to be able to do things that are more

Unknown Speaker  01:42
important and more valuable to the to the

Unknown Speaker  01:45
organization into the business.

Unknown Speaker  01:47
In order to do something

Speaker 1  01:48
more valuable for the organization for your business,

Unknown Speaker  01:53
you need to stop

Speaker 1  01:54
doing something, the only way that you can stop doing something

Unknown Speaker  01:59
is the hand of the things that you're doing to somebody else.

Unknown Speaker  02:04
When you delegate effectively,

Speaker 1  02:05
you're making an investment into the future of yourself as a leader

Unknown Speaker  02:09
and into the future of your

Unknown Speaker  02:10
organization.

Unknown Speaker  02:16
The fact that it takes somebody longer than you and it's done

Speaker 1  02:19
less perfectly, didn't you in a situation doesn't matter

Unknown Speaker  02:25
if you're concerned

Speaker 1  02:27
about somebody else take you longer than you you're undervaluing your time,

Unknown Speaker  02:31
your time as a leader is always more

Unknown Speaker  02:33
valuable than the people that

Unknown Speaker  02:34
you lead.

Speaker 1  02:39
Why it's not because you're more important than them.

Unknown Speaker  02:44
It's not because

Unknown Speaker  02:47
I wanted to say it. It's not because you

Unknown Speaker  02:49
have more intrinsic values.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
And that because your choices

Speaker 1  02:53
and your influence on the organization has a greater impact than there

Unknown Speaker  03:01
The only time

Unknown Speaker  03:01
that you run the risk of not

Speaker 1  03:05
making yourself replaceable. It's when you choose not just do higher value thing.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Let me give you an example.

Speaker 1  03:19
If you're early on in your business, you might be spending a lot of time doing invoicing invoicing your customers

Unknown Speaker  03:27
seems like an important thing to do. Because

Unknown Speaker  03:28
this is part of what ensures that you've got

Unknown Speaker  03:30
money in the bank.

Unknown Speaker  03:33
With time

Unknown Speaker  03:33
you'll find that you're you're becoming busier

Speaker 1  03:35
and busier and you don't have time to do

Unknown Speaker  03:41
you'll just find yourself becoming busier and busier.

Speaker 1  03:46
As soon as you start handing off that piece of business, you can start looking

Unknown Speaker  03:49
at

Speaker 1  03:50
other interesting pieces of other business such as are there ways

Unknown Speaker  03:55
that we can that we could do that my team

Unknown Speaker  03:58
members can can work more effectively

Unknown Speaker  04:02
other

Unknown Speaker  04:02
tools that they should have access to that will

Unknown Speaker  04:05
make them work more efficient.

Speaker 1  04:08
And as you can do you grow that part of the organization you'll find yourself becoming increasingly

Unknown Speaker  04:13
busy with with managing your seat

Speaker 1  04:17
time you'll choose to replace yourself with somebody who oversees operation.

Unknown Speaker  04:26
From there

Speaker 1  04:27
you'll start to put yourself into a position where you manage and oversee

Unknown Speaker  04:34
your leadership staff, your management staff

Unknown Speaker  04:38
you keep them accountable

Unknown Speaker  04:39
for reports you you met, you look at the business of a

Unknown Speaker  04:41
high level and you engage with that

Unknown Speaker  04:45
you'll go from

Unknown Speaker  04:49
putting together

Speaker 1  04:50
the the advertisements on a daily basis to

Speaker 1  04:55
say daily weekly plans to setting quarterly and annual objectives.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
And you'll continue to do

Speaker 1  05:02
that as you continue to do that. And as you continue to delegate your value and what you spend time on continues to increase

Unknown Speaker  05:11
as you continue to replace yourself.

Unknown Speaker  05:14
Stop looking at

Unknown Speaker  05:15
how to how to find the right staff

Speaker 1  05:17
to how to find the right leadership now to create the right culture in your organization.

Speaker 1  05:25
Last of all, when you're busy, too busy to do that you may choose to replace yourself as the CEO

Unknown Speaker  05:32
and instead of spending your time

Unknown Speaker  05:34
focusing on the business and what you could do in the business

Unknown Speaker  05:37
you may choose to

Speaker 1  05:37
spend your time looking at the market looking for untapped opportunities

Unknown Speaker  05:44
can you choose to become the

Unknown Speaker  05:45
Warren Buffett of

Unknown Speaker  05:46
your own portfolio,

Speaker 1  05:50
leveraging the existing business that you have a place to match new a new opportunities,

Unknown Speaker  05:57
none of this can happen.

Speaker 1  05:59
If you don't choose today to give somebody on your team a chance to pay those bills

Speaker 1  06:06
to make that phone call to oversee that project.

Speaker 1  06:11
Take take the initiative to take that one thing off your plate.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
It all

Speaker 1  06:17
starts now. And the biggest mistake at night. Sorry, the biggest loss

Speaker 1  06:24
that you have in your business is

Unknown Speaker  06:27
not

Speaker 1  06:28
the time loss training somebody else it's the opportunity that you lose when you choose to do it all yourself.

Speaker 1  06:35
delegating effectively means valuing your time and filling that time was something that's more

Speaker 1  06:40
valuable to you do that you'll get you'll consistently improve the increase the value that you bring to the organization you will continually grow your business

Unknown Speaker  06:50
and you'll find

Speaker 1  06:52
yourself becoming more effective as you

Unknown Speaker  06:56
find yourself

Speaker 1  06:58
you find yourself becoming more effective as a as a leader I think more effective and more fulfilled as a leader select that.
