Speaker 1  00:02
three critical elements of effective delegation

Speaker 1  00:09
to delegate. One of the challenges that I find is that many people approach it from either a tactical level,

Speaker 1  00:18
from a conceptual level, this is the big picture of how you need to think can be very, very, they'll tell you, you need to empower your people. And other people will tell you that you have to write things down in a step by

Speaker 1  00:30
step instruction we're going to do for you is I want to build a bridge between the two. But to build a bridge, we first has to be able to see the overarching structure. And once you see

Speaker 1  00:40
the over arching structure, the tactical side will make more sense.

Unknown Speaker  00:45
Well, like a delegation,

Speaker 1  00:45
I look at three specific aspects.

Unknown Speaker  00:51
aspect number one, you need to have a clearly defined

Unknown Speaker  00:53
outcome,

Speaker 1  00:55
people delegate, they have some kind of vague idea in their head, there's something that they're imagining the challenges that many times they're not able to articulate it, I have some kind of marketing idea. And I want this poster to have this kind of field. But I can't give any kind of kind of specific, I can't tell you what else it should look

Speaker 1  01:14
like. I can't tell you I know when I see it, but I

Speaker 1  01:17
can't tell you on that situation, you're clear outcome might be tell you tell your team member

Unknown Speaker  01:23
that I want you to come up with three or

Speaker 1  01:24
four five concepts and here's the general general general boundaries

Speaker 1  01:29
and they'll be able to give you feedback that's that's a career research oriented outcome

Unknown Speaker  01:36
might say that

Speaker 1  01:37
the the the other common mistake with clear outcomes which we can discuss in depth here is they

Unknown Speaker  01:42
confuse the process

Speaker 1  01:44
with the outcome I want you to pick up the phone and and call the landlord and let him know that that

Unknown Speaker  01:54
something is

Unknown Speaker  01:55
we have something in disrepair

Unknown Speaker  01:59
and

Speaker 1  02:01
because of that the railroad is is and maybe it's not even

Speaker 1  02:06
you guys should change it to leave them a voicemail and not knowing that the landlord just dropped by

Speaker 1  02:12
and was was stopping by for some, some paperwork to drop off the paperwork, and

Speaker 1  02:21
you lost the opportunity to have a conversation with them, because you are focused on

Speaker 1  02:25
what needs to be done and the outcome. No, I understand that that intelligent employees will

Unknown Speaker  02:30
will be able to translate your step by step instructions and your how into the outcome. But the real outcome that you want is you want this issue to be fix. And perhaps it is it is the best way of having this issue fixed. Perhaps perhaps you take initiative and fix yourself

Unknown Speaker  02:47
is actually better approach

Unknown Speaker  02:50
it, it may completely depend

Speaker 1  02:52
on the situation, the clear you are about the outcome that you're looking for that

Speaker 1  02:57
the more opportunity you create for not not only for your team number to find the best way to approach it, but for your team to team member to clearly know what successes and how to reach it.

Unknown Speaker  03:11
Number two,

Speaker 1  03:13
you need to delegate to the right person, it doesn't matter if you have a 10 person

Speaker 1  03:20
to person team for 100 person team, you need to know how to delegate effectively. And we're going to look at what are the different characteristics of what makes people

Unknown Speaker  03:35
with specific

Speaker 1  03:35
tasks. However, in this case, just understand that

Speaker 1  03:41
delegating certain tasks to one person may yield results that

Speaker 1  03:47
may yield interior results. If you're looking for a highly creative, open ended, visionary type of brainstorm, don't assign it to somebody who's analytical and who likes following structure. In the same way, don't delegate certain tasks that require attention to detail to your your right brain, highly creative individuals who are looking for

Speaker 1  04:16
is looking for out of the box way to approach every kind of situation, one of the best things you can do to guarantee success

Speaker 1  04:22
and delegation, once you once you define a clear outcome is finding the right person for the job. And you'll find that if you find the person who's the best fit that that they will take that take that responsibility of the outcome that you've assigned to them, and they'll run with it. And many times the the run with it that they'll produce that they'll come up with something that's way better than what you ever work would have been able to do on your own. So you have to find the right person for the job.

Speaker 1  04:54
Number three, you have to define processes around the things that you want.

Speaker 1  05:00
Many people resist processes, because it sounds too dry or restrictive. But processes are the heartbeat of your organization. And when you put clear clearly defined systems and processes in place in your business, you can guarantee that and you can ensure that

Unknown Speaker  05:26
you can ensure that that

Unknown Speaker  05:27
the things that need to

Speaker 1  05:28
happen will happen on a consistent, repeatable basis.

Speaker 1  05:33
This isn't about turning people into robots, it's about taking care of details that you don't want people to need to remember and that people

Speaker 1  05:42
don't you want to protect people from happening to forget that if you put the systems and processes in place as you provide the structure and support around your team members to find that they become increasingly effective is completing the tasks successfully.

Speaker 1  06:01
Conclusion as you look at these three elements, this is the big picture

Unknown Speaker  06:05
of what we're looking at where we're looking at

Unknown Speaker  06:09
intentional, effective

Speaker 1  06:12
delegation. If any of these these elements are no let's not do that

Unknown Speaker  06:20
in the future. We're going to be looking at

Speaker 1  06:22
more specific ways of where we're going to be looking at specific ways to make these

Unknown Speaker  06:28
each of these pieces

Speaker 1  06:29
practical so that you can apply them and not only will you have it not, not only can you have a clear overarching structure in place to understand how delegation works, or how

Speaker 1  06:41
to delegate to also know the practical on the ground

Speaker 1  06:46
application as you as you apply to your business.
