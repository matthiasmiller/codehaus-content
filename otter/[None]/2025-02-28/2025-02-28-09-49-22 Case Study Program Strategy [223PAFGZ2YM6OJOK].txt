All right, so Jonathan is impressed with the results that we've been getting for Jeremy. And so the question is, how do we take something that's working and do more of it? And so there are two ways to go about it. Number one is, do the AI call summaries, identify the people who may be good fits for this, shoot them a text and say, Hey, we are launching a case study program or something. And would you be interested in more details? Option two, which I think could work really well, is we could do a postcard and mail out postcards, ideally, perhaps starting with the people that we've talked to already, and we Could do phone calls with all of these. We obviously the most direct approach is identifying the people who may be good candidates based on previous conversations. So if we go that route, really, the next piece that's required is a way to get a call summary or of these particular individuals, and one of the easiest ways to do this, as I'm thinking out loud, Here, would be for me to write a Google App Script and use grok or Claude or chat GPT to analyze them, summarize the conversation, score them on what a good how good of A fit they are, and put them into a giant summary document with links over to the contact in GHL, and then you could double check and based on that, send out the messages, and it'd be the fastest way to analyze all of this stuff. So anyway, I don't know what your thoughts are on that, but I thought maybe if I drop you a line, you can put some thought into it. We can talk about it more on Monday. I.
