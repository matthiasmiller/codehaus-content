Speaker 1  05:37
A Good morning. Good morning. Well that so

Speaker 2  05:47
everybody's late, except for Matthias. This morning. Hey, I was

Matthias Miller  05:50
actually early. Shock, shock.

Speaker 3  05:55
I was thinking, just thinking, Matthias is always the faithful standby here on time and yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:08
try to 730 is late enough in my morning that I can actually get there on time. But anything i The scheduling things earlier than that, which occasionally happens, there's always the little footnote at the bottom saying warning up to five minutes repeat

Unknown Speaker  06:28
fully wake up and show up.

Matthias Miller  06:35
Mark, I've got a random non assistance question, if you're open to it, the production overhead versus other overhead. How does that line typically get drawn?

Unknown Speaker  06:54
You're saying, how do we make the line there? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  06:59
or is there other, is there ever, like at, I don't know, sales and other types of, what do you? What do you, what do you put in, which, what do you draw that distinction, and what do you put in, which bucket,

Speaker 3  07:15
well, for, for our industry here, it's the hardest okay, it's easy to separate between somewhat easy to separate between production overhead and our three other buckets of sales, admin and marketing. Well, marketing, I guess there's not really, but, but like sales and admin, there's a little bit of crossover work. It's most challenging for us is between we have the reproduction overhead, and then we also have logistics. Site. What is it? Site? Site, prep, logistics. And if you would look at a balance sheet that is our income statement, we have underneath cogs, there's like a sub, I think we call it

Speaker 3  08:14
hogs, like, logistics is logistics and repairs like, it's kind of hard to determine, Okay, that the repair guy, or for where we're parking the repair truck, or the that that gets kind of, but, okay, sorry, I'm kind of being along with it here and not really answering your question you're saying. So production overhead, we typically say what Larry told us is whatever is needed for production. So, yeah, I remember him saying, like, if you gravel your parking lot, the parking space is where your production employees Park. You know that's part of production overhead. Or if you need to gravel for your sheds, then that's production overhead. But if it's like here, we at the location I am, we actually so we pay rent, we rent, we lease the real estate facility here. So we're splitting that monthly rent. The bulk of it goes to production overhead, and then a small portion goes because we also do some sales. Here, it goes to sales, and a small part goes to admin expenses, or admin officer

Matthias Miller  09:37
as well. So that's and you would just use an approximate split based on square footage, or like, how do you even we're really going down the down the rabbit hole, but best guess,

Speaker 3  09:55
well, I'm curious. Can you take a look at what. Up. We have a recurring vendor invoice for diversified services. I think, I mean, yeah, I think it's 15%

Unknown Speaker  10:09
is it 15 and 80 something like that? See.

Matthias Miller  10:16
So here, let me size this down a little bit. So

Unknown Speaker  10:25
but whatever the 2520

Matthias Miller  10:28
divided by 3600 that's 7070, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  10:36
So, I mean, I, I think when we came up with that, we said, wow, something like for for sales probably get more for sales there, because we also have some sheds on display and use a bigger part of the lot for that and admin just mainly Two or three little buildings for where we work, where the admin happens, and then else is for production and storage of finish or the completed shifts.

Matthias Miller  11:13
That makes sense. Oh, it's an art and science, basically.

Speaker 3  11:18
Yeah, the art, the art of finance. Have you ever read the book financial intelligence?

Unknown Speaker  11:25
I have not. It's, it's,

Speaker 3  11:28
it's an interesting read for well, they they give a lot of stories about how people well, about how companies actually cook the books, or how they can like, yeah, there was one in there that they wanted to make their bottom line look really good. So everything they bought down to the paper they used in the office was depreciated as an asset. So what that meant, rather than taking all their expenses in real time, it it split, it spread it out to like 10 or 15 or 20 years, however, far they had depreciated it so it looked like they were making lots of money

Matthias Miller  12:15
well, and as long as you're high growth and can exit before anybody catches on.

Speaker 3  12:21
But, yeah, there was another one that, for some reason, they call him chainsaw al I think he was a he would take over a struggling company and make the Almo said, turn it around. But it was more make the numbers look good and then sell it for big bucks. So what he would, he would usually, usually go in, I think that's where the nickname chainsaw came from. He would usually go in and fire about half of the staff and get rid of everything that wasn't making money, and then, but anyway, he, he took over this one company, I think it was sunbeam. They made grills, I think,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
and vacuum savers.

Speaker 3  13:10
So they, he wanted to prop up the numbers really, really high, so that to attract buyers. And he these companies use what, well, you could use. I mean, it's all for people. They use what's called bill and hold where you can. Or people do this with, say, Walmart, in those big companies a lot, where they they say, Well, okay, for the Christmas season you want, you know, a million, whatever, something, something that's seasonal. And we'll, we'll, we'll bill you for it, and we'll hold it, and we'll actually even store it in a warehouse near you. You don't have to pay for it until December 1, but we'll guarantee that you have it. And then they use that, then they go and invoice for that on their side, so it looks like they've got, and they may have, they may or may not have actually produced the product, but by invoice that, it creates a huge spike in revenue. You can only do it short term, but that's what he did. Like he, he went above and beyond what was ethical and doing that, and somebody was, I think it was a, I don't know what you call them, like a financial analyst was watching these numbers, and he was using his day sales outstanding, some ratio that he was running so that they were that this, this number had changed dramatically. That's how he spotted for it, most people didn't. And then he downgraded their company on whatever, wherever that they rate those companies, and then just said, the rest is, as they say they're. Rest is history. But then trigger D and D for, but anyway, wow, I found it kind of interesting on, yeah, they talk a lot about the art of finance, because you can, you can make things look, to some extent, look the way you want them

Unknown Speaker  15:21
to be ready, right?

Matthias Miller  15:24
Well, and it's pretty Yeah, wow.

Speaker 3  15:27
I think there was another CEO there that used to say that his accounting department is the most profitable, yeah, part of his company. So if he had them at his banking call, he could make numbers and show what he wanted

Matthias Miller  15:45
to investor pitch. Well, I mean, I mean, there's all kinds of good things you can do. Like, I mean, even if you, if you pump your revenue like that, and you have guaranteed invoices, and you lose it for collateral, for financing, and you do some other kind of like, there's no end to the stunts that I'm sure you can pull if you Yeah, yeah, keep chasing it down. Oh, gracious. That's fascinating. All right. Well, I might have to put that on my Christmas, Christmas reading list with my in laws. That's great. All right. Well, do we want to jump in with the pool stuff? Since Nick is here?

Unknown Speaker  16:28
Yeah, let's do that first. I Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:34
All right, so yeah, go ahead. Morning.

Unknown Speaker  16:39
Wayne, well, sorry, guys, I'm chasing erroneous transactions, and I completely

Matthias Miller  16:49
lost track of time. Welcome. We lost track of time too, but it's because of Mark's storytelling, not because we're chasing transactions.

Speaker 3  17:02
I I was telling them about the book Financial Intelligence. Actually, by the way, lean is the one that recommended that one in the first place. So recommended what the book called financial intelligence, if you've read it or not, but it's, I think it's I have not. It's quite helpful, actually, Dwayne, you, you might want to, you might want to read it before you it might serve you well for only if you want to, depending what you want to do or show with if you want to start playing with revenue on the only side. No, I wouldn't recommend it, but it it's an interesting read.

Speaker 4  17:46
Does if I read the book, does it provide the revenue to play with? It?

Unknown Speaker  17:52
Might find how you cook the books?

Speaker 4  17:56
Yeah, listen, I I am. Every time I try to cook the books, I end up burning the pan. So I

Speaker 4  18:09
funny, funny story. The other morning, Alexis usually makes her own breakfast, and I, I think I was at the gym or something. I come back in, I walk, and the whole house just stank. I was like, what happened? And she would, she was trying to make French toast, and she burnt the French toast. And, I mean, the whole house stank like crazy. And so when I think of cooking the books, that's exactly the smell I come up.

Matthias Miller  18:35
That's hilarious. Um,

Speaker 3  18:43
good. So I think where we want to start here is Nick can. Where is your you created a user report for this.

Unknown Speaker  18:53
It's in it's in my format, my personal.

Unknown Speaker  18:57
Let's take a look at it first, and then I know

Speaker 3  19:05
this guy, yeah, and I think we want to look at it for well as of this week, I believe for affordable barn, company two, I believe, correct. I think there's a, okay, yeah. So we have one building there you notice we now have pool production, non pool and total production, the which is all correct, this is what we're wanting to show. We there's two things that we want it to be excluded, that 17,000 or anything in non pool production be excluded from lead time calculations which we need to work with Josh on that mean, well, I miss I expect that's actually working the way it should, because Josh added this field on the billing record, but then on payroll, if we go to a company payroll verification report, I believe it is for the. Time frame we'll see this being added in where we don't want it to be added

Unknown Speaker  20:07
started week would be sort

Matthias Miller  20:10
of week is on the eighth.

Speaker 5  20:16
Think my auto correct for you too.

Matthias Miller  20:22
Okay, 70, right? It's showing this but this production total dollars should be this guy. Yeah, do you want to show the breakdown between the pool and non pool production, or just show that number as the production total.

Speaker 3  20:42
Well, Nick was suggesting we show both and which I like that idea show both of them on here. We don't have a strong opinion that we need to have both, but if we show both of them here, it would just be good and then, but the pools total within the 7% would need to calculate off of the the other number so we didn't know what needs to, needs to happen. Notice we want to Yeah.

Speaker 5  21:18
I mean, changing that report is pretty simple. I well,

Matthias Miller  21:25
we need to. We need to chase it the full way through, yeah,

Speaker 3  21:30
yeah, because it would affect all your payroll calculations. So yeah. Basically, the reason we're doing this, I think this is valuable to know, is a non Josh added to setting on the building. I think it's called a non pool production building. What that means is it's, it's outside of the norm, enough that we pay our employees hourly on those and not we don't include it as part of the pool because we don't want them sure, because there's, there's a lot of very a lot of things can change, where it'll take longer, or not as long, to build such a building, and trying to just come up with a manufacturer price and say, we'll pay you this time 7% It doesn't work very well. That's that's the main reason why we have full and non full production. And then you just good. We've been doing this for a while already. We were just the way we were handling it was, we just put it on a on a fictitious BPR, we just put them on ABC three BPR, that all worked just fine. And now, until we're starting to do build materials. And if we do build materials thing, it tries to pull materials from whoever the wherever the builder is. And there's no parts there to like the materials aren't there. Yep.

Matthias Miller  22:59
Let me Seth just pulled up a job here that I'm going to pull across now we ran into we had talked about changing production versus non production. Payroll to pool versus non pool. Payroll terminology, because it's and this further, I think, pushes the argument for doing this.

Speaker 3  23:46
I think we should. I mean, I think this makes the production versus non production does not make sense, because if you're building a you're still doing production, right?

Matthias Miller  23:58
Yeah. I Seth, I'll let you figure out how to tie it out. But yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:15
think that's I mean, I don't, I think, I think I mean the weekly prod amount. I mean, this is, this is very straightforward, presumably, actually the pool amount. This is the pool amount.

Unknown Speaker  24:31
It's just going to take some waiting through, well, it's getting a whole bunch of

Matthias Miller  24:36
it's not the pool amount, though. It's the

Unknown Speaker  24:39
pool production amount?

Matthias Miller  24:44
Yeah, it's the it's the production version of the pool, but you also have the compensation portion of the pool, right? We want to be careful with i.

Matthias Miller  25:12
They're both, yeah, they're both pools,

Unknown Speaker  25:17
so like the deep end or shallower.

Speaker 3  25:20
This is not, I don't know how much work there is to do this. It's not something that's super urgent, but what I would say is, if it would be nice, okay, the most important part is that I think Seth change needs to happen. Well, it Seth, we need to coordinate the timing. Seth's change needs to happen before Nick takes his change life on the weekly Bill sheet. Otherwise we're going to be skewing payroll. But payroll can be, I think the change could be made in payroll, and then we take the change live on the the build sheet.

Speaker 3  26:14
What are you thinking as far as time frame on this? Is this

Unknown Speaker  26:20
a day or two of

Speaker 3  26:27
easy. Is it realistic to I'd say, if we make a goal to have it live all of this live by end of the month, then we'd start using this in January for buildings that for building January, start using little materials. Then, if that's realistic, I

Speaker 5  26:52
mean, if this is top priority of the items that we have, then it's doable. Depends how many other things we try to push above it.

Matthias Miller  27:02
Well, we can put this in there and take a look at the list. Or, do you know, offhand,

Speaker 3  27:08
let's take a look at the list. I don't think there's anything else that's that's real urgent. The only other report and cash flow reports, I think, do you want

Matthias Miller  27:24
to put a queue or prefix on it? And do you want to? I'm assuming this would be very high priority, right?

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Yeah, yeah, we could.

Speaker 5  27:37
Well, if I'm not needed, I'll drop now. Okay,

Speaker 3  27:43
we covered everything on that that we had, Nick, right? I think, I

Unknown Speaker  27:47
think so, yeah, okay, Thanks, Nick, thank you.

Matthias Miller  27:57
I don't know what number you went down here. I

Speaker 3  28:01
don't really like that prefix thing, but I guess it's Yeah, put in whatever, whatever puts it to the top. Hey guys, I are just doing this.

Matthias Miller  28:16
Well. One's not going to sort very well. Oh one, thank you. You're welcome, perfect, duh, I should know this information. It's Thursday morning. Okay. Where is that? Why am I not seeing it, though, on this, is it assigned to

Unknown Speaker  28:36
Nick? Nick, oh,

Matthias Miller  28:44
I am very confused. It's doing, saying,

Speaker 5  28:48
Oh, it's up, if it's doing, then it's up at the top.

Matthias Miller  28:51
Oh, it's in progress. Got it?

Unknown Speaker  28:58
Okay? Well,

Matthias Miller  29:01
we're not technically, I don't know. I'm gonna oops the wrong one.

Unknown Speaker  29:07
I'm just gonna do that. We could get into the list where we want it all right?

Speaker 3  29:13
So yeah, let's look at at the the AI report and the cash flow reports, and then circle back and see if there's anything else to look at and prioritize.

Matthias Miller  29:23
But I think this is saying I feel strongly. Sometimes my eyes water just a little bit from the complexity of some of our reports and how many little check boxes, and not this, but that and all this other stuff. So that's

Speaker 3  29:45
the way that okay, if, if we were thinking about this correctly, on the AR report, what, from a use case standpoint, what Drew and I were thinking is it, would you. You, you exclude customer deposits when you want to audit your account balance like excluding that should, should match with your balance sheet account number, right? You, you show them. This is the place you go. You show them, and here's where you go. If we say, is there anybody that we we need to reimburse, that we've, that we've Okay, typical overpayment. We define that on the payment type, which then channels it to the correct report, and that all takes care of itself that all works well. This is, this is more the place where we find edge case, things like, oh, this customer canceled, and we never paid him back, the $500 down payment. And then we reach out and say, Okay, Mr. Sales Manager or salesperson, do we send this back? Or do we not and then deal with it from there?

Speaker 2  31:05
Yeah, because on the customer deposit report, they all show up as positive. So you can't just look at the report and see, oh, here's a payment that needs sent back, because it looks no different than a payment that was received before a building was inboxed.

Speaker 3  31:24
Actually, okay, I've just thought of one thing we show cancelation dates on post or deposit report, so you could sort all those to the top and use that simplify the ER report.

Unknown Speaker  31:34
Just, well, if there's something like that, yeah.

Matthias Miller  31:38
See, we could group by, well, we have, we could have canceled sales orders. We could do canceled invoiced and I mean, they shouldn't do we do in orders. I don't know what you could call the third one, uninvoiced,

Speaker 3  32:02
yeah, but why do we have, why do we have some with ends that means they're invoiced.

Matthias Miller  32:08
Why are they here? Invoice Date?

Speaker 3  32:13
What was all? Is it because of the date? Was it invoice of

Unknown Speaker  32:18
after? Right?

Speaker 3  32:25
I like your idea of self grouping with, yeah, like putting the cancel ones. I don't know top or bottom.

Matthias Miller  32:34
Well, canceled is more likely that you need to pay attention to it in my mind.

Unknown Speaker  32:38
So put it at the top. I

Matthias Miller  32:46
could we do something like that? Yeah, except, oh, you can drop journal entries, yeah? Oh, we don't need journal entries on this report, right?

Speaker 2  32:56
We journal entries in a sister account. So like for accounts payable, we have sales orders, accounts payable, and then journal accounts payable.

Matthias Miller  33:08
So if you were here in Colorado, I would give you a big fat hug. You're probably grateful. You're not. That is wonderful. Well, in that case, though, could we How much do I ask for?

Speaker 4  33:25
Doesn't that mean that you're on you're on a roll for asking you might as well get on with it.

Matthias Miller  33:29
We'll get on with it. Like, doesn't that mean we could just use the AR report? I mean, the only benefit this has, or the primary benefit this has, is that it's it throws the journal entries in there, like, how is How is this not different than just an AR report that lets you choose whether you want to see accounts receivable, customer deposits, or both?

Speaker 2  33:54
Well, we thought about that. And what's the difference between an AR report that you select which report you want to see, or just two different reports.

Matthias Miller  34:04
I get it. I like it. It's clear. It's not a Swiss army now. So then we always take customer deposits off the AR report, yes,

Speaker 2  34:16
yeah, because we can find them, then can't we in the customer deposits, there would be canceled orders. It'd be the canceled

Speaker 3  34:23
ones at the top. And then we removed the canceled ones. We go back, change the logic on the AI report and remove the cancel ones.

Matthias Miller  34:32
Well, it's not just

Unknown Speaker  34:35
if they've been canceled,

Unknown Speaker  34:37
what is it after

Speaker 2  34:41
they'd have to just put the current as update in. Also, like, if that's your job is to see if there's anybody we need to pay back, but as of today, but but on

Speaker 3  34:52
the AR report. On the AR report, if we say AR as of 1130 anything can. Sold any cancelations after 1130 of course, would would not

Unknown Speaker  35:05
right? Yes, yeah, it would

Speaker 2  35:07
be as of cancellated. Yep. Okay, so the AR report should only show things that are between invoicing and cancelation.

Speaker 5  35:16
So the grouping on customer deposits, are you grouping by current status, as of status, by as of No, it's it has to be as of status for it to make sense. No, right, when did, but invoice sales orders wouldn't be on there. It's impossible, yeah.

Speaker 3  35:36
Well, okay, they would be if you go back in time, because you're doing as of

Matthias Miller  35:40
No, but you would prove as of the historical status. Got it? Okay? All right, so on the AI report, let's run this through. We removed customer deposits, so basically we're already making sure It's invoice I believe. So I

Unknown Speaker  36:21
get about that. So

Speaker 3  36:24
before we leave this in Matthias, I want to go look at the vinyl structures AI report as of today, just make sure that that were, that I'm thinking about this correctly. I

Unknown Speaker  36:46
And then, sure, let's do that. T, Y.

Unknown Speaker  36:54
What does y do?

Matthias Miller  36:57
No, just t Ah,

Unknown Speaker  36:59
okay, why I suggest,

Matthias Miller  37:01
was just a fluke. It was, it was somewhere I actually put in t y or something, and it decided it like to remember that we

Unknown Speaker  37:12
thought we were gonna hit a new shortcut.

Matthias Miller  37:15
No such luck. If

Speaker 3  37:18
you go down towards the bottom on the negatives. I think that 7785 like that. One's been canceled. So this one would disappear, right with the change you're making.

Unknown Speaker  37:29
1211 Correct? As of 1211

Matthias Miller  37:37
the reports running as of the reports running as of 1211 I'm sorry that's yeah.

Speaker 3  37:44
But then there's others, I think, like the ken Menier, that's simply just an overpayment, right? That's not it. What what happened there is, is there's a pull barn. The sale was made. It was all on a handwritten the customer is happy. Vendors happy. Nobody's bothered to ever go ahead and update the sales order, or even new to update the sales order, to reflect reality in in here, I think is what happens.

Matthias Miller  38:15
Well, it's always nice when you happy people paying more happy money. The one question that I have is, do we want, do we want these sub panes as well on the customer deposits report?

Speaker 3  38:32
No, well, my vote would be no, it just makes the report slower, and I'm not sure that we

Matthias Miller  38:39
excuse them. Okay, does this next question is, since Dwayne stepped away now and can't fight for himself, does this affect workflow in Dwayne's office at all?

Speaker 3  38:55
No, because I don't think so, because right now, nobody's using custom deposits anyway that I'm aware of. We just created that report. So we have a, yeah, so if, if the balance sheet says we have 500,000 new custom deposits, so we have a way to see what Wait.

Matthias Miller  39:11
How do you know who's who's checking to see that something got canceled and we need to put in an overpayment to get pushed to a refund check?

Speaker 3  39:19
Nobody at this point, nobody is that's why he's hanging out here. So okay, I think it workflow will need to change. Somebody will need to take responsibility for that, but it's one of those things that just hasn't been done up until now.

Unknown Speaker  39:33
So there I would make those negatives on the AR anyway.

Unknown Speaker  39:38
Wow. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  39:42
and maybe the way to find

Unknown Speaker  39:45
I could still hear you. You're

Matthias Miller  39:49
not gonna let us get away with that. If you get away with that, are you?

Speaker 3  39:53
I'm not sure that the Dwayne who is responsible for the ER reports, but.

Speaker 4  40:00
Uh, somebody, we're just not sure if, I'm assuming you're speaking for, for final structures.

Speaker 3  40:07
Well, I was for all three companies. But, I mean, it's like Matthias, who's responsible for, like, the negatives on there to be watching those and issuing he was asking for a workflow, who's responsible to flag those and say, oh, we need to to do something with this overpayment,

Speaker 4  40:32
generally, here in North Carolina, where we handle AR, I mean, that's there's a process flow to get that if there's a refund being generated to get it over to AP to actually transact. But as far as, like Ohio and Indiana, I don't have an answer to that.

Speaker 3  40:48
Mean that's, that's each one of those companies, somebody in house there, but I think so. So how do we clean up this? Like, this is old, ancient. So should we wait? Should I just put it on our meeting for next week to look at some ones, and then we just work through those? Okay? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Okay.

Matthias Miller  41:14
I'm taking the liberty to break this out into separate job. Incident, 209, so then, is there anything left on the I mean, at this point, Are you guys happy with the AR report? Apart from this, you know, let's go.

Speaker 3  41:29
Since we're we're poking around in it anyway, let's go look at it. I think there's some columns we could possibly remove.

Matthias Miller  41:36
Ooh, I'm happy with that. All right.

Speaker 3  41:40
So hey, Dwayne, chime in here. I don't know. I mean sales, order, building stand, customer name, those are all probably

Matthias Miller  41:48
the invoice. They all seem relevant. They do.

Unknown Speaker  41:55
We could remove them anyway.

Unknown Speaker  41:58
Why stop? I mean, seriously.

Speaker 4  42:04
I mean days, days outstanding could be removed, although that's not going to make much difference. I mean, because we are grouping these things based on on their date time frame or on their day's time frame, anyway, so I mean that that column is a bit redundant.

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Yeah, I would agree.

Speaker 2  42:22
Well, one thing that that you could do with it actually has to do with the account balance audit, the sub like the little sub panes at the bottom of that report shows the total and the balance columns, but you can't see the balance column without stretching it and making it bigger. So I don't know if it's that report or this one, but if you swap those two, then you can actually see the balance

Speaker 4  42:54
when you resume your I presume your scroll, your scroll wheel works on your mouse doesn't it on, on the sales order, the details does scroll.

Matthias Miller  43:06
We don't want him to get arthritis in his finger.

Speaker 2  43:14
Wings. There's five of them in every single one. You got to scroll over so you can see the number.

Speaker 4  43:19
I mean, there's, there's no real you could stack your pain side by side instead of top and bottom. Couldn't you? Not with

Matthias Miller  43:28
it's a grid layout. It's using a lot of information on

Unknown Speaker  43:32
put it in a dashboard, and then you could,

Unknown Speaker  43:35
can we dashboard

Unknown Speaker  43:37
that it? This is,

Matthias Miller  43:39
it's, it's a multi pane. No, it's a multi pane. It's like 10 panes of dashboard. So we don't have a ton of room to play with.

Speaker 4  43:47
So not the one that I'm currently looking at on share here.

Unknown Speaker  43:50
No, no,

Matthias Miller  43:52
sorry, this report in Dwayne. Does it bother your people if balance and total

Speaker 5  43:58
are swapped? No, okay, well, then let's just swap air report. Well, you just need a bigger screen drew because I can see it all fine. Oh, really,

Unknown Speaker  44:09
yeah, that might be the case. Okay, I'll tell my boss I didn't bigger screen.

Unknown Speaker  44:19
50 inch TVs are an amazing thing.

Matthias Miller  44:22
So are you guys good with these two changes? Swap balancing total columns and remove

Speaker 3  44:28
days outstanding. I also think that the sorting seems wrong to me. Maybe, I maybe if you guys say That's right, then, Oh,

Matthias Miller  44:36
I agree. You should do the oldest version at the top. Yeah.

Speaker 3  44:45
And should we also get rid of, I mean, we could also remove the totals on on the Totals column, because it's, it does just, does that do any good? I mean, does it do anything?

Matthias Miller  44:57
You don't care how much you. The voices.

Speaker 2  45:02
It doesn't do any good for me, but I'm not,

Unknown Speaker  45:06
you know, the person

Unknown Speaker  45:08
actually collecting? May care. I don't, yeah, but how?

Unknown Speaker  45:14
I mean, you can see the, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  45:18
it would tell you if the guy has at least made some

Speaker 3  45:20
payments or No, he's we're leaving the total here on the but not, not, oh yeah, some of this

Speaker 2  45:26
whole that doesn't matter. Yeah, that's totally unnecessary,

Unknown Speaker  45:30
unless you're running ratios on that.

Unknown Speaker  45:33
Yeah, you want that, but

Speaker 2  45:38
then that's not going to be correct ratio either, because this is not all sales. This is just sales with outstanding balances,

Speaker 3  45:47
good, but let's take that off as well. Okay. I mean,

Matthias Miller  45:51
that's going to clean it up. Go ahead.

Speaker 3  45:54
I was just going to say, do we need to skin? And, I mean, I would be tempted to say, we also don't need to skin because we have to sell pains. I don't Dwayne. If you think we need to stand, then

Unknown Speaker  46:08
I don't, I don't particularly care.

Unknown Speaker  46:14
It's not my report. So I could say whatever I want.

Matthias Miller  46:21
The main thing is, if somebody knows there's a stint on AR, but then you can also look up the Sten and find the

Unknown Speaker  46:31
No, let's leave it there. I Okay.

Matthias Miller  46:35
Do you want? Do you want, like the little garnish on top of your steak dinner? Because if you select a district, we could hide the total for the district. Can we? No, we can't. We could hide the grouping if you run it for a single nevermind.

Unknown Speaker  46:51
Always, never run it for a single district. Well, then

Matthias Miller  46:55
let's require the district and then and remove this grouping here so you only get one total at the bottom.

Speaker 2  47:02
Oh yeah. I didn't even realize that it

Unknown Speaker  47:08
was a group by this group,

Speaker 4  47:10
plus garnishes on steak dinners are a waste of overhead anyway.

Matthias Miller  47:15
Well, I'm not sure which is the garnish. Maybe we're taking the garnish off. It makes Wayne happy. You here's the stage. I think more fried onion.

Speaker 3  47:28
The changes we're making here are, I remember way back, probably two, three years ago, when I don't even know what we were building, when Gabe Slayer ball had his his there was about three different stages of needs. One was what you do, what, what's real, urgent, and then long term. And then the final thing was toe wiggling, which meant when you're everything's done and working well, and you're sitting back in your chair, wiggling your toes. And I think some of these changes that we're asking for now are getting close to that stage.

Speaker 4  48:02
Well, that's actually progress, because I distinctly remember toe wiggling conversations at the beginning of accounting design. So to talk about toe wiggling conversations at this side of accounting, I'd call that some pretty good garnish on the steak dinner.

Matthias Miller  48:16
We have not had a lot of toe wiggling conversations over the last two years. I would say that

Unknown Speaker  48:22
we lost all our toes in the process. Yeah, we did.

Matthias Miller  48:26
We were all wobbling around.

Speaker 4  48:28
Give us all those freezing of numbers that we got us in trouble.

Matthias Miller  48:33
Yeah. So then, do you want? Okay, the write off column and the transaction ID can come off of the customer deposits report that's irrelevant now,

Matthias Miller  48:50
basically just, is there anything else do you care about payment method on the on the Customer deposit account?

Unknown Speaker  49:00
Yeah, I think that has value,

Speaker 2  49:02
especially when they're looking at returning it was, you know, they can know which way they're supposed to return it.

Speaker 3  49:08
But payment D, is there a deposit date? Here? No, no, there's no, no, we don't need deposit date, invoice date. We're doing sub grouping. Good, yeah, looks like through the slaves and dresses here. Well, would we be better off? We actually might be better off to do soft pains here and then diamond Avenue. Get rid of the invoice. Okay, what if we do sub panes? And since we're doing the groupings, get rid of invoice date and cancelation date, you just loop them,

Unknown Speaker  49:47
oh yes, like that tells you

Speaker 3  49:54
why it's that tells you it's class. If you're looking at it as a 30, it tells you. It? Yeah, no, let's keep those.

Matthias Miller  50:05
So do you want cancelation date as well? Yeah, but the same sub panes as the AR report, second address or No, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  50:17
that you need the bottom on true.

Speaker 3  50:21
That's just the real build. Yeah, let's just do the sales or something. For those of us,

Unknown Speaker  50:31
with little screens, we can actually see the payments Exactly.

Matthias Miller  50:35
That's right. Good. Oh, this makes me. This makes me so happy. I got everything I wanted.

Unknown Speaker  50:44
Josh, good.

Unknown Speaker  50:48
Well, that takes care of that. So, so

Matthias Miller  50:55
then that's the next piece that you guys need to do your AR reconciliation,

Unknown Speaker  51:03
yeah, yep,

Matthias Miller  51:06
cash flows, good,

Speaker 3  51:08
okay, before we go to cash flows, I think the ranks the reconciling account is, I mean, I consider it done for everything other than undeposited funds, which I think we should do a quick,

Unknown Speaker  51:23
safe update.

Speaker 3  51:26
Direct me through what is the story on that? I think it might

Speaker 2  51:32
be, yeah, well, Brian knows more on what the update is on undeposited funds.

Unknown Speaker  51:39
But, um, basically

Speaker 2  51:44
we're waiting on, we're cleaning up historical things, and then Josh is working, or will work, on handling refunds. Wayne, you could maybe share your little tidbit about creating refunds and assist. I don't know if that something Matthias should hear about, or if that's just a Josh thing, but

Speaker 4  52:09
Well, as far as update, I have most untied out credit card transactions tied up. There's, there's a bunch of stuff yet on on stripe reconciliation that I, yeah, I find bad behavior that I'm have to go fix around duplicate credit card transactions, and then people didn't tie them in and properly tie them out. And so you want to talk about a run around to try and find anyway kind of fun.

Unknown Speaker  52:38
I don't know, Mark, I presumed you're were talking about the

Speaker 4  52:45
generating refunds for credit cards directly from the detail screen, right? I don't know. I mean, that that's would end up being more of a Josh thing anyway, but I don't know. I could, I could give you the thought. It's basically that we would generate refund transactions directly from the payment RG line and pipe all the information out to stripe with the PI number or transaction number, so that everything under the hood ties out correctly, rather than inputting a manual line item and then manually tying out this stuff later. But as I said to mark this morning, most of these, there's a, you know, three to five to seven per company per month that it's almost just worth just continuing to manually tie them out. I don't know what your thoughts would be on that.

Matthias Miller  53:39
Matthias, so would we just create some kind of, some kind of report to create unique IDs that lets us tie it out somehow, like this, this refund is for this payout entry?

Speaker 4  53:59
No, what I had, what I had in mind is the whiskey, like you would it okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna wave my hands and describe it. The way I see it in my mind is basically you select the row that you want to refund that was a credit card transaction and and you actually hit a button on the detail screen that grabs all the relevant details and pipes it over to stripe and does the refund, and Stripe pipes back all of the details that are eventually tied out to the payout. Got it basically formalizing an actual way to refund credit card transactions, rather than running out to the to the stripe portal to run the refund. You do the refund directly inside of assist, yep, yep, but again, I repeat, the amount of these that's happening almost doesn't warrant the work to to actually formalize the process. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  55:00
So you're thinking, if we don't do that, then you could continue to use Josh little report that help, or report or whatever, at the end of the month, you just go and tie them in. Yeah.

Speaker 4  55:14
I mean, so, so essentially, what I have been doing is I go all of these that have refunds on them. I go find the original transaction, find from stripes portal, the actual payout. Go find the payout, and then link across the TXn number, and that ties everything out. And it's like it's a very quick process to do, especially, you know, if you had 50 of them to do. Yeah, it takes a while. If you have 10 to do, it's, you know, 1520, minutes.

Unknown Speaker  55:48
So basically, we're going to

Speaker 3  55:50
clean, clean those up. And then, when he grew up with, I think, regroup with Josh on do we? Do we need to make changes or not moving forward? Okay, Josh did. He did the refunds thing, and wasn't there one other thing that he also made,

Matthias Miller  56:08
the fees were the other ish, the missing fees.

Speaker 3  56:12
But the fees thing is, that's a fix. That fix, if the record would often fix moving forward or not. Yeah. So okay, so the only thing, kind of, the only outstanding, is the refunds thing, okay,

Speaker 2  56:29
as far as a fix, there were some crazy outlier things that's only manually fixed historically or dreams working on.

Speaker 4  56:39
There's, yeah, the biggest, the biggest pain point has been now that I get over the reconciliation sheet, is where there was duplicate transactions that took place that were never the there were never tied into the payments RG and and so then we get differences, and we got to chase down the difference, only to find that, oh, okay, this was there wasn't an In and Out on on credit card transactions that was never in the payments RG, that once you tie everything out correctly, Oh, guess what? The difference goes away. But it's like there's some bad behavior taking place. I don't know why September seemed to be the month for bad behavior.

Speaker 3  57:21
Good. Well, I'm very happy with where we're at now, after Josh did some work to tie those in, and Dwayne did all the detective work to tie them,

Speaker 4  57:37
tie those refunds, you mean to say Dwayne is doing the detective work. He's not doing

Unknown Speaker  57:41
it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  57:47
good. So, yeah,

Speaker 3  57:49
that's undeposited funds. So let's look at cash flow.

Speaker 5  57:56
So is there anything left on undeposited funds incident? Or can we close it out.

Speaker 3  58:00
Oh, close it out, right? I mean, should we go look at that report and see if there's there?

Matthias Miller  58:06
Shouldn't, shouldn't we, doesn't Drew, still need to cross reference with, sorry, doesn't he? Still need to cross reference with things after Dwayne does all the cleanup and stuff and everything's,

Speaker 2  58:21
yeah, that's, that's what I was going to say after, if I come up with something more, I guess I could just reopen it if needed, because we really haven't reconciled it out saying that, that, yes, this is all checking out now.

Speaker 5  58:39
What about the isolated credit card payments as prompt as well. We had talked about removing that at one point, and we weren't sure. I think I sent an email yesterday.

Matthias Miller  58:49
Main reason that we need it. Where was this undeposited? Remind me again this, this handles things that aren't tied to a stripe ID, right? Or it tries to is isolated for the credit card stripe fee, and it doesn't have a stripe ID, and the year is that year. But we really shouldn't have, like, do we actually have isolated payments for 2024, for 2025 seeing that was just a historical cleanup thing. No, we don't. I we don't have it for any for 2025 I think it's just a historical cleanup thing. I would vote to remove it unless would vote to remove it, unless there's some reason that you guys see to keep it.

Speaker 2  59:48
Wayne, you weren't using it at all. You were using a different report, right?

Speaker 4  59:52
Sorry, I was finishing up finding something.

Unknown Speaker  59:55
What are we talking about? This guy? I.

Matthias Miller  1:00:06
And what do we want to do with it? Get rid of it. Nobody's using it. You don't use it, do you?

Speaker 1  1:00:12
I don't Okay. Let's get rid of it.

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
I'm 90% sure that it's yeah, just old cleanup from migration or something.

Speaker 2  1:00:26
It was an attempt to find out what's going on with why it's not tying out.

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
So, yeah, but that was like nine months ago at the latest. Correct? Yeah. All right. I mean, I would vote to I would personally vote to keep it. We could move some more items to history. This part needs to be done. I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
that's what I would do. Sounds good, okay, all right,

Matthias Miller  1:01:26
so then cash flows.

Speaker 3  1:01:28
So Matthias happy. Just report that your clicker report van is working on clicking through those 4500 transactions.

Matthias Miller  1:01:38
So that's wonderful. We think there's probably going to be more to after that, but we thought it'd be easier to get rid of. There's like 500 other transactions of some kind, but let's get rid of these and then find take

Unknown Speaker  1:01:55
a look at what those are. Oh, that's that's possible.

Matthias Miller  1:02:04
So I, I mean, is it, I it feels, it seems to me, like this is largely up to you guys to take a look at the numbers and see if you agree with them.

Speaker 3  1:02:23
Okay, true. Well, okay, first off, we haven't, I don't think we've even responded to your questions or your notes, so I didn't know. Is there, if you tell us the we should try it out, and then we go from there. That's fine. I thought maybe there's value in just going through this.

Matthias Miller  1:02:46
Yeah, no, I think there is okay. So let's go pull up some things that we have a 10 124, 1031, 24 let's do an October to October comparison for ABC. All right. So by the way, this little section at the bottom here is a cross reference. These numbers here should tie out based on everything above. So we are currently reversing operations for all credits to accumulated depreciation, even when we are debiting the FGI assets. I think we could actually probably change this logic here. Okay, I made the changes to the income statement. Let's go here. I'm trying

Unknown Speaker  1:03:43
to expand. We now. We don't

Matthias Miller  1:03:52
balance sheet group. Yeah, we do. We now have a balance sheet group for fixed assets, which will force this to show up under fixed assets, allowing us to change this to accumulated depreciation.

Matthias Miller  1:04:12
So I have not yet changed cash flows to look at the subtype currently, cash flows, is digging it out of the asset to figure out if it's accumulated depreciation or not. So this would simplify how we classify accumulated depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
Can you go through that again? The issue is

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
that, are you familiar with the issue of, first of all, depreciation from the cash flow standpoint? But perspective.

Speaker 3  1:04:44
Yeah, it's an expense on the income statement, but it doesn't cost cash Correct?

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
Yeah, and and so currently, what we're doing is, for each transaction, we're looking at the asset that it's tied to, and if there's a if there's an account. Now, if it's tied to one of the assets depreciation accounts, then we treat that transaction as a depreciation adjustment.

Matthias Miller  1:05:15
And my proposal is we could simplify this substantially, and I don't think it actually has any substantial impact on this by by just looking at whether the transaction is, is a if,

Matthias Miller  1:05:41
if, if the, if the transaction is between a accumulated depreciation subtype account and a depreciation expense subtype account. So we would look at subtypes, instead of needing to look up the asset, we just know, basically, we would just know these accounts are accumulated depreciation accounts and these accounts and these accounts are depreciation expense accounts based on the subtype that's on there.

Speaker 3  1:06:11
So you, are you adding? Are you adding fields on the chart of accounts or to an

Matthias Miller  1:06:20
accountant, yes. So we want the issue was that we wanted this to be grouped on the income statement under logistic cogs, but we had added a new subtype in order to do that. And really what should happen is this subtype should be depreciation. So the subtype now really is a meaningful designation of this is what this account is and does. And if you need it somewhere else in the income statement, you put it in a different income statement, group to group it however you want to on the income statement. If we do that, well, then it's very easy to find that depreciation number. Go look at all, all, all debits and credits. And we could, presumably, we could, I suppose, look at all credits to accumulated depreciation and debits to that right, debits to the depreciation expense, and use that for the depreciation number. But by, by setting the subtype, we don't have to go look at each individual asset to find out whether this transaction is depreciation or a depreciation expense or not. We can just look at, at the at a certain, certain set of account type the accounts in the Chart of Accounts,

Speaker 3  1:07:44
and it makes your report faster as well, well, or you don't have to look to at two different

Matthias Miller  1:07:52
layers microscopically, yes, but I would also Yeah, and current, currently, the way It is right now, I am calculating cash flows nightly to because we want to, just to simplify the process, but we can, we can very easily change it to update on on demand. Have it? Have it be real time?

Speaker 3  1:08:19
But would there be any value in doing that? Because we're our accounting transactions are updating nightly as well.

Matthias Miller  1:08:26
So not really, no.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:29
I mean, if you, if

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32
it's something you could push if you want to.

Matthias Miller  1:08:35
I mean, there's a there's there's a button,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38
yeah, it's

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
that simple, and it goes and does it?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:47
Yeah, that is fine.

Matthias Miller  1:08:53
Also we're excluding we I went ahead and made the change to exclude closing transactions which cross your fingers should handle, I guess we should run through this. If we go, if we do like a 12, 124 to a 131 25 and a 12, 123 to 131 24 let's go take a look and see if this actually works. We are not, definitely not handling that, right?

Speaker 3  1:09:26
Wow. But the 23 I'm I would be surprised if that works, because we didn't start until Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:09:33
Well, let's do a let's just do a comparison to this. Just dumb, but let's do 10, 124, to 1130, 24

Matthias Miller  1:09:51
it's not me validation to make sure it's before still doesn't it still doesn't like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
Do you have to do a comparison?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
Mm. Doesn't matter.

Matthias Miller  1:10:03
So we are saying the net cash flow statement does not expect match.

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
Okay? These are the aren't

Matthias Miller  1:10:37
these considered closing transactions or not? No, not necessarily

Speaker 2  1:10:46
these, are you going closing transactions, as in, it hits an equity account,

Matthias Miller  1:10:57
or I was regarding, I was using, literally with this thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:05
I mean, there it's possible.

Matthias Miller  1:11:12
I think we had said, This is what We had said earlier

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
here, this guy, I

Matthias Miller  1:12:16
so in this particular case, we Okay, here's the fun thing. This is part of the change. So here is how it's currently wanting to categorize the cash flow. It's saying that initial capital decreased by 120,820 120 127, and finished goods inventory in operating increased by 126

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
Well, why inventory is involved there, but

Matthias Miller  1:13:11
other assets prepaid income tax, well, let's go take a look at the classification of prepaid income tax. Side note,

Speaker 3  1:13:19
I wonder if that's any issue goods, because we created that prepaid income tax account for 2024,

Speaker 1  1:13:29
some a big, yeah, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:33
that's just wrong. There

Unknown Speaker  1:13:37
do we know what it should be

Unknown Speaker  1:13:42
probably Financing, I guess

Matthias Miller  1:13:52
that is true. It would be

Unknown Speaker  1:14:00
operating,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:13
operating sentence. I mean, it's definitely an asset.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:28
It isn't financing

Speaker 2  1:14:29
short term assets. Short term, that's what I'm that's what I'm wondering. It should maybe be short term.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:37
So when we are temporary,

Speaker 3  1:14:39
no, it's not temporary equity. There was, there was something short term, yeah, isn't it?

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
Yeah? Investing, because it's outbound. I mean, no, well, I mean,

Speaker 2  1:14:51
that's, I mean, like stocks or something, you know, you threw some money. So.

Speaker 3  1:15:00
Basically what it was is I got the the numbers wrong, and we paid all the estimated prepaid estimated taxes in the first quarter, rather than quarterly. So it's prepaid, prepaid expenses.

Speaker 2  1:15:21
Yeah, in a way, well, no, but it's, it's, the thing is, it's not actually business expense, it's, it's a, it's an equity draw. It's payment of an equity draw. And it's not right.

Matthias Miller  1:15:41
I mean, but isn't, isn't fundamentally I understand financing in stocks, but isn't the fundamental difference. Maybe I'm being way too simplistic, that that financing is money coming in and investing is money going out. It doesn't. We have finance, financing outflows,

Speaker 3  1:16:07
some interest, where you could put it to financing. Other, I don't know, is our other liability. I mean, it is, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:16
it's not liability,

Speaker 3  1:16:18
but it's like customer deposit. No, you're right. It's not a lot.

Matthias Miller  1:16:22
It is an asset.

Speaker 2  1:16:29
Well, do the financial investment short term? I mean that,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:33
what's financial treasury?

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
Where financial treasury, that's that is, I'm assuming treasury bonds or something similar to that. Yeah, all right, let's say with the short term. So then this would be prepaid

Unknown Speaker  1:16:55
expenses. Well, not really, because it's not an expense, but

Matthias Miller  1:17:03
you could, what do you want to prepay? Did you just want to call it prepaid income tax? We can add one new

Unknown Speaker  1:17:12
prepaid expense. I mean, hopefully this never shows off. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:17:21
So then this guy, okay, so that takes care. Theoretically, let's go. Okay, then we can go back to this transaction. Here's a fun thing preview. See what it wants to do now.

Matthias Miller  1:17:42
So now it all. Now it moves from financing to investing, but what we're taking money out of capital and putting it into prepaid expenses, isn't that correct?

Speaker 2  1:18:05
Yeah, that's what happened. Like, in other words, they all dropped their their own capital as their own account, and it became capital as a this asset prepaid income account.

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
Okay, so let's take a look at this. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:25
okay, so now,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:33
here just going to refresh.

Matthias Miller  1:18:39
Now we have cash flows from investing.

Speaker 2  1:18:50
The thing is, is that that shouldn't even be on this report, because no cash happened. We just moved it out of equity to the asset. Well, we did pay it, though, yeah, but not this transaction.

Matthias Miller  1:19:06
This transaction true. So this one should be okay, so let's go into here. Let's go find out what is going on then.

Matthias Miller  1:19:22
So this guy, it's a closing transaction. Else we look at,

Speaker 2  1:19:36
somebody had made a report once that that listed closing transactions or possibly closing transactions that weren't marked, and I think it was based on things that hit the equity account that did not hit something else.

Matthias Miller  1:19:55
Check this out. Okay, so possible closing transactions. Let's take a look at how we calculate that. That is closing transaction candidate, does it reference both a, I didn't realize we had an is temp account. So all we would technically, theoretically, what we would have to do is, over here in this guy is, if it is a possible do

Unknown Speaker  1:20:25
we actually want to do that?

Matthias Miller  1:20:32
Just automatically? Include the closing transaction, exclude these candidates. It doesn't think it's a candidate. Let's go find that way.

Matthias Miller  1:20:48
It's equity and not a temp account, if it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:52
doesn't have any temp accounts. No.

Matthias Miller  1:20:56
How do we know it's a temp account? Is explicitly temp? Is it a temp account? So we have a setting that says it's certain subtypes are temporary accounts. Okay, well, all

Speaker 2  1:21:10
income accounts should be temporary accounts, like income statements.

Matthias Miller  1:21:14
Well, we're completely ignoring, ignoring those. I so we go to, sorry, thinking, configure, sub, sub, count, subtypes, counter, temporary. Currently we have dividends, income, summary, other comprehensive income, other temporary equity and owner's distribution. So here,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:50
once we're not using

Matthias Miller  1:21:52
current year distributions and prepaid income, let's go take a look at what these guys are. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:22:04
Oh, okay, the prepaid income tax gets a current asset, yeah, which is not temporary. Is that what you want it

Speaker 2  1:22:21
to be? Yeah, that should be correct.

Matthias Miller  1:22:30
And then the let's go back to the

Unknown Speaker  1:22:34
current year distributions.

Matthias Miller  1:22:46
And these are simply equity accounts, which would not be these are non temporary,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:56
correct, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:23:01
so this is not a transfer between temporary accounts, temporary

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11
equity in a temporary

Matthias Miller  1:23:13
which one's temporary. No, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:21
no, none of these are temporary, or they shouldn't be

Speaker 2  1:23:24
current year distributions should be, though. So what wasn't it equity and a current and a temporary? Isn't that what it was saying?

Matthias Miller  1:23:44
Oh, if, yeah, if it has a temporary account, and it has a non temporary equity account, fair,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:57
right? That's fair. This one has a temporary equity

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
should the three others? So, yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  1:24:11
well, I don't know, because this should not affect cash flow, and it's also does not fit that other things.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
So what?

Matthias Miller  1:24:24
What does it? I mean, we also can recognize that it's, it's assets, it's, it's a transfer between non cash assets,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:35
right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:44
which is what it is,

Matthias Miller  1:24:47
and so, but I.

Matthias Miller  1:25:03
But you can't necessarily do that because, I mean, you can't just blanket exclude non cash assets, because there's a possibility that, I mean, you went things like finished goods inventory and other things like that. No, I guess, apart from depreciation, doesn't matter. Is there ever a time you want non non cash transfers between non cash assets showing up on the cash flow statement? The primary reason would be moving things from a financing to an investing right? So if you have, okay, here's, here's, here's a so we could exclude transfers between non cash assets, between the same category, operating, investing or financing. I

Matthias Miller  1:26:03
I know this doesn't, but that, but okay, but then we're going to get into trouble because, you know, except for operations, because should in some for some reason, I mean, I don't know credit card liability post to finish. Or, you know, I don't know you lose your itemization potentially in this situation,

Speaker 3  1:26:34
we also have, I mean, should we? It almost seems like I don't know for at least for me, like we should, we should start using it and maybe get more familiar with it. I feel like you're asking questions. If you're clear on the fast but I think you're, you're way above my head on where you're going with this at this point, just because I haven't, I need to get my head wrapped around cash flows, I think before, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:27:07
Oh, one question, though, if you go back, what is the numbers it's talking about that don't match like are they all report

Matthias Miller  1:27:14
that is something? Yeah. So let's, let's go take a look. A little fuzzy on the details, but the cash and the net increase and decrease. Yeah, so there's a this number here and this number here don't match. It's off by 20, $20 so I'm going to guess. If we do.

Matthias Miller  1:27:46
We do this. It's all going to show up over the end of the year. So somewhere in here, and I'm not sure exactly where this is coming from, we're miscategorizing a transaction.

Speaker 2  1:28:03
That's yeah, okay, just I know what to look for. If the red letters show up, I know where, what we're after,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
where you're at, Yep, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:28:13
So is everything you showed us is already in the live system. Yes. Okay. Do good? Well, is there? We're almost top of the hour here. As far as, should we go back to the list of priorities or the list of projects, and just do a quick do? Ah,

Matthias Miller  1:28:50
okay, weekly build sheet, clean up these air and customer deposits report. Seth, you've got that fixed air report, true support.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:00
What he said, This is

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
that's your changes that you're making to the reports, right?

Matthias Miller  1:29:15
Do you have to review this after we're done with

Unknown Speaker  1:29:19
it? Yeah, should I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:27
it Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
right? This guy, very similar. So this is ready for Drew, and then we also have this other thing that we can knock out. So. Would,

Speaker 3  1:30:05
I mean, I think as far as priority, it's the weekly Bill sheet and how that payroll should be,

Speaker 3  1:30:16
no the changes to the AR that nine that that should be done ahead of there should be one that should be one that and that

Unknown Speaker  1:30:28
is almost done. We can

Matthias Miller  1:30:33
see who cares more about getting stuff done than figuring out cash flows. Figured. I meant it will be

Unknown Speaker  1:30:42
productive, Yep, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:30:49
the any positive funds is staying there as well for for Drew to double check, then Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:31:02
Except you're removing the checkbox, right the isolated CC,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:06
well, how Sean did publicly? Yes, yep, awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:31:17
Oh, we were gonna Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:27
Good. Anything else we should cover?

Matthias Miller  1:31:33
I don't think so. Do you remember what it was like two years ago?

Speaker 3  1:31:41
I Yeah. Drew used to say it was like, one do we have calls twice a week? I think so. I think, I think we did, yeah, I think you used to say that seems like, was it one call or one week? We we discussed all kinds of issues, and then the next week, and it seemed like we didn't make a whole lot of progress. So the next week, we made lots of progress, and it just kind

Unknown Speaker  1:32:05
of slog, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:32:08
yeah, I definitely expect this year's closing to go a lot smoother than last year's closing, for sure, prior to that

Speaker 3  1:32:20
good, yeah, where I think a really good spot, thanks to all the work that each one of you has put in. So Thanks for, thanks for, I don't know, making the journey as as smooth as it has been,

Matthias Miller  1:32:44
yeah, well, you're welcome. It's been it's been fun working here's here's a little, there's a little. I would not have been able to predict Dwayne can plug his ears and he can weep quiet tears, but I would not have been able to predict how much fun I've had working with accounting related stuff. So very weird way is grateful because he benefits from it. You also can call me weird, no, but it's been it's been fun having the opportunity to dig into this, into this stuff, and I've had a lot of fun with it. So I'm grateful the opportunity. I am

Speaker 4  1:33:21
extremely grateful that you had fun with this, because if it was you and me figuring this out, we would just have scrapped accounting for RTO, and we would be just like, Nope, we're not doing this. This. Our mantra, our mantra over a number of these calls, is that, let's just learn from this. Let's just learn from this. Yeah, store, that one away for the future. And, yeah, well, it's

Speaker 2  1:33:46
definitely been an extremely good exercise for me. I mean, there's just when you have to figure out if the thing is working. I mean, you just have to know what it's supposed to do, and you have to figure that out. So, yeah, a

Matthias Miller  1:34:07
little side note, fun thing. This is a little side project that I did, partially inspired by work on only but also just for fun, but I I came up with a much, much simpler and easier to understand. We'll see if Seth agrees when he actually reads through it, but simpler way to understand. RTO deposits with a CRA attached to it. It was looking through the through our calculations and assist it. It works. It's just there's no rhyme or reason to why it actually works.

Speaker 4  1:34:41
So anyway, well, there is rhyme or reason why it works is because you wrote the first one and now you're going to write the second one, so both of them work. Then there's only one common denominator.

Matthias Miller  1:34:54
Okay, fine. I wasn't fishing for compliments, but I'll take it.

Speaker 3  1:34:58
I. That is so so Dwayne, I'm curious you're sitting here. We're kind of accounting isn't done, but we're kind of reminiscing on on the journey, like you think this is where you'll be at a year in a year from now, with only are you, you've got that mapped out much better. I mean, there's, you're probably thinking, there's not near as many cleanup and on and on ongoing things to be worked on, like, like we've seen in accounting.

Speaker 4  1:35:35
Well, by nature, I think it's a bit simpler. And so I hope for it to be a simpler process. I what I get really excited about. I had to have a conversation this week. We were Matthias and I were discussing back and forth. There's a a concept in RTO where, when paying off a building or forgiving, late fees or something like that. That really what it is. It's, it's a marketing tool for the art to companies use in order to get customers to pay. And so we were discussing back and forth as to when you close a a customer's account as an early cash payoff and you decide to short pay that EPO as a as a method in order to get the customer to close out and make a happy customer, what are you gonna do with that money? And it was a fun conversation, because I was having this conversation, had this chat with two individuals in the in the RTO industry who heavily understand accounting and are very particular about the way they do their accounting. And it was, it was kind of fun to watch them scratch their heads and realize that, yeah, this is not something we've ever had to think about before, but if we're going to actually do strict accounting and books, then we get to show up a new GL account in our RTO accounting called discounts given. And I said to Leanne's uncle, was one of the individuals that I was speaking to. He's been in the rent to own industry for many, many years, and very particular about his accounting. I said, Wouldn't it be fun to show to be able to track discounts given on your on your P and L? He just sort of paused for a little bit and said, you know, that would bit kind of fun. We've never had that before, so, but I mean, it's, it's what we're going to be able to do. That really gets me excited is because we have such like all of this will tie out, and we can run many p and L's or gross profit margin on individual buildings, which also means we can run it on dealerships, on sales reps, on manufacturers. And for the I was standing talking with an individual this week in my office, and I said, you know, we're gonna be able to do this. And he just looked at me and go, in order to do that right now, in our books, it would take a tremendous amount of work, and it'll just like, by nature of being connected together with the management side, it just, it's a click of a button

Speaker 3  1:38:21
you're doing that just down to grow smart for the because, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:38:25
in order to start assigning overhead, I mean, we, I think we'll eventually go there. I mean, it just means that we're gonna have to do something very similar to income splits on on the P and L, like you guys did for for for wholesale and retail. We'll have to do something similar for for expense accounts, in order to tie out all overhead into into, into those kinds of reporting, but it would be gross margin at this point. I mean, assigning overhead gets tricky inside of an RTO company.

Speaker 2  1:38:54
That's where Matthias first opening question came from about assigning overheads. That's the one you missed.

Speaker 4  1:39:05
That's exciting. I mean, it's really exciting. There's going to be, only will be the first software in the industry that will be able to do such things. And that's, I mean, for for the guys who love like in large size, medium size to large size, RTO companies, there's always a person in there who just loves the numbers and the ability to now, whether you're a management company or whether you're you know your own rent to own company to run profit margins on on revenue channels, like dealerships, sales reps, manufacturers, to be able to do that and be able to break your portfolio up and go, Okay, this guy is performing really, really well, but this guy over here, we gotta, we gotta go work on this. Like, there's a lot of bad paper coming from this direction. And to be able to do that in minutes, you know, click, click, click, run the report, pull up, you know, assign an ad. Prompt on the dealership you want to run this for, and the date range on what you want to run. It's like, yeah, it's nobody has that capability Currently,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:10
only you, only, only us. Good, well, I

Speaker 3  1:40:21
see the next meeting is scheduled for January 8, so we don't talk to you guys till then. Thanks for everything you've done this year, and Merry Christmas to you and your families, and hopefully we can continue doing this next year.

Matthias Miller  1:40:43
Yeah, good. Merry Christmas to you guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:47
Thank you. Yep, bye.
