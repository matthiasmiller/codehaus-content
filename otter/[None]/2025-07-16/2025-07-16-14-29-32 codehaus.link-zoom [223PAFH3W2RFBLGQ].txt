Speaker 1  00:25
Hey, Mark, Hey, how's it going? Matthias, good. How are you? Hey, I'm doing pretty good.

Matthias Miller  00:34
It's got to be a little chaotic.

Speaker 2  00:41
Yeah, it's like, I told, told one of the guys today. I said, Look, sometimes we we put things into a certain process because this is how our software works, yeah. And so when we change a software, we're probably going to do things a little bit differently just because of how the flow of the software works, and so we're just going to have to be open to making some changes. It works a little bit differently, but from what I've seen, as far as you know, having the texting and the calling and the emailing all together like it is there, that is going to be a big improvement for him. I

Matthias Miller  01:23
allow me to rant. But why doesn't you know enterprise price? CRM not have that just blows my mind. Like,

Unknown Speaker  01:37
I don't know.

Speaker 2  01:39
Yeah, yeah. It's like, you know, you can, you can somehow patch in Twilio to work, which I which I didn't have Twilio is like, I was using some other systems, and then it didn't work as I wanted to. And you can't use this one in a workflow, or you can use it in a workflow, but you can't use it in a what was the other kind of automation they had? Is they had a workflow, and they had a some other automation. You could use it in one but not in the other, and it's just and so HubSpot just recently actually went and integrated SMS natively, but, but it's like three cents per per segment or something like that, and you basically have to prepay. It's not pay as you go. It's you. You buy a block of this many and if you're in a contract for a year. So if I'm running out big this month, and I put my, my sick, my, the amount I get another block or I get another two blocks now that stays active for the rest of my contract, that amount of blocks per month, whether you use it or Not. And that, that's just the business model. I'm like, dude, just at some point, at some point,

Matthias Miller  03:08
well, I think, I just think the only thing that's made, I mean, I think I look at IBM as one of the most interesting companies to have endured across 100 years at technology space. And I know they've, you know they're, I'm sure they've lost share, and I don't know what keeps them hanging on anymore. What they're actually their business is these days. But if you don't invent, reinvent, if you don't adapt, if you and if you, you can, you can turn a nice business into a cash cow, and you just have to recognize that it is going to your one competitor's innovation away from becoming irrelevant. Might not happen, yes, but it's just the nature of the game, yeah. So, yep, um, all right. So I, I did a i, i went ahead and played around with exporting, putting together a combined export. But I don't know if this is actually I found a bunch of deals that were not associated with any with any contacts. I'm going to guess that came from deleting old contacts to save within limits, or is there something else that was going on

Unknown Speaker  04:45
that is a possibility?

Matthias Miller  04:52
Okay, this isn't handling word wrap in Excel, but I. I see that has contact ID.

Matthias Miller  05:12
Should put opportunity ID in here, because I think that actually, that actually is meaningful.

Speaker 2  05:22
Okay, I'm seeing it down at the bottom, there's a there's a whole bunch of opportunities there, deals that don't have any associated contact. Do

Matthias Miller  05:42
do we want to what do you want to do with

Speaker 2  05:47
how we just eliminate them? Just eliminate them. Okay, yeah, because most of those are probably going to be real old, yep.

Matthias Miller  05:57
So let me go ahead and

Matthias Miller  06:05
see All right, so,

Matthias Miller  06:19
column Set, okay, so I'm

Matthias Miller  07:04
And so if we go Here this

Unknown Speaker  07:31
contact,

Speaker 3  07:40
import, I'm So

Matthias Miller  07:48
create just this time I'm

Matthias Miller  08:12
that actually reminds me. Did you add the HubSpot custom field?

Unknown Speaker  08:19
The Hub the custom

Matthias Miller  08:20
field for the HubSpot communication.

Unknown Speaker  08:25
I do not remember that I did.

Matthias Miller  08:28
Okay, so this would be multi line. This would be imported HubSpot communication. I where we want it. We can move it around. Okay, so I'm

Matthias Miller  09:20
so in my completely random not related to any of this I've been playing around with, let's keep going. Okay, so we have contact. I don't know if that's actually the way to do that, or if that literally means,

Unknown Speaker  09:49
see.

Unknown Speaker  10:11
Excellent opportunities.

Matthias Miller  10:14
It's the contact ID that go a level ID, or is it an external contact ID.

Matthias Miller  10:30
Okay, got it. So this one, actually, we don't, we don't map. So we got contact, contact, contact, contact phone. So we got first name, last name,

Unknown Speaker  10:52
last name,

Matthias Miller  10:54
email, phone opportunity, opportunity name

Matthias Miller  11:15
this pipeline. Just wondering a little bit how we want to handle these pipeline imports. That actually is another question, did you have an abandoned stage in

Speaker 2  11:29
hubs? It would have been, it would have been the closed lost,

Matthias Miller  11:36
which is, well, they, they have, okay, I mean, the short answer is no, because the closed lost is actually lost, not abandoned, okay, okay, so that's so, I think so the status should map, find pipeline. I don't know how it's going to like the pipeline at stage. Opportunity, value, and then this would be on the contact. It does not let me import into a Custom Field. Well, that's fun. I

Unknown Speaker  12:31
but

Matthias Miller  12:42
because it's because option, maybe I did create it soon enough.

Speaker 2  12:52
Yeah, you might have to re refresh it, because that I was seeing that earlier, when we were doing some custom fields. It's

Matthias Miller  13:04
always nice that we've got a BIG FAT file.

Matthias Miller  13:13
So I've been with my blog and email list. I've been playing around with Facebook ads to drive traffic, and just Partially, partially, just continuing the fine tune marketing and other types of stuff I've been waiting for today's post to go live, because it's the perfect one to Write an ad for. And so the jury's out. Cost is we're, I mean, it's still not performing really well. It's, it's pretty early in but my, my highest converting ad right now is converting at a 16% click through rate driving traffic to my blog. Okay? Six cents a click. It's just interesting to observe. What does the general public really I feel like I get lost in my own little world, and what, what does the rest what is the rest of the world thinking about, worried about all of that stuff. So these are rabbit trails that I go down. Money strikes a nerve, that's for sure, yeah, fear of loss. Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:51
I saw you were commenting on the one of the AI or AI conversations. Correct? Do? Something to let's see this map exists. So here's, here's how it's not in there. Oh, my goodness, I can't scroll. Okay. Well, we might want more fields in here than in this case,

Unknown Speaker  15:24
um,

Unknown Speaker  15:34
oh, the contact owner,

Matthias Miller  15:37
contact owner, opportunity owner,

Speaker 2  15:42
um, contact owner and opportunity ownership would be the same, the same. There are the Contact Notes. Well, that's Contact Notes. That's another one that I did. Here's this one. There's a yes,

Speaker 2  16:02
what I wanted. One Go ahead. Well, I'm going to say, Do you want to import it and then later update the update the owner. But that might be a little bit

Matthias Miller  16:14
we could pull in the I guess. Let's start by, what are the fields that we really need to have in here. So do you want? So contact owner is

Unknown Speaker  16:32
let's look at do.

Speaker 2  16:44
Is there. So some of the main things that I'm looking at, and I hadn't thought about this name, email, phone number, contact owner, the create date, and maybe the

Unknown Speaker  17:11
lead status is

Matthias Miller  17:29
the create date on the contact,

Speaker 2  17:31
yes, it created on the contact, and then the The source in HubSpot, it will have the source as being

Unknown Speaker  17:50
either paid social, paid search,

Unknown Speaker  17:56
see who are those. I

Speaker 2  18:07
You will have organic search, paid search, organic social, direct traffic, online, offline sources and paid social would be some of the

Matthias Miller  18:19
we'll probably want that. You want it to be a list, right? Or just to, I guess we can import

Speaker 2  18:29
it. It could import just as a text input, okay? I

Matthias Miller  18:45
is elite source a custom field.

Unknown Speaker  18:49
It shouldn't be Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:00
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:22
okay. I'm

Speaker 2  20:13
Yeah, that was some, some of the stuff that so I, I've, I'm working on setting up one, and I'm my first use cases for reactivation. Through a lot of these old leads go through and try to set up appointments off of them. Then down now. So the way I would think of AI response. is that one of the to. I think that one of the most helpful things ways to think of AI is to think of it as a dumb employee. And so if you could delegate. If your salespeople are worth. I mean, make up a number if they're worth salesperson, making 100 grand a year is worth $50 an hour. So what are the $5 an hour tasks, or $10 an hour tasks that you can delegate to AI, and that can be, that could be a welcome sequence, or like an opening sequence of people. I've seen a few things drive people really crazy, with AI, one, one, if they I have run reactivation campaigns where the sales people didn't have access to those conversations. That's just a nightmare, because people are like, Why did I have to repeat myself? But then also, the extreme version of this. There's a guy teaching Facebook Messenger, and there's you can go any number of ways, but the extreme case is text, like a teenage girl, you know, low cap, low caps and abbreviations and all that stuff. That's the super extreme. You don't have to be quite that extreme, but just not having formal language and having some mistakes in your in the messages makes it feel a lot more personal. Yeah, and probably, I think there is some truth to what some people, some folks, are saying about, you know, responding at 3am probably doesn't make sense, but having an after hours AI sequence where it's like, Hey, I'm I'm like, I'm with my family right now. Like, are you free tomorrow? Or and, or, you know, Monday, whatever the next business day is? Like, there's no reason why you can't, in my opinion, and that doesn't even really need AI, but in my opinion, there's no reason why not to. Yep, so that's one of my use cases. The other use case that I was thinking is new leads do an initial trying to set an appointment, instead of, instead of the sales people having to call all these people, you know, multiple times, never getting a hold of 50% of them. You know, that kind of a, that kind of a scenario to where you weed out and you end up just talking to the ones that do want to talk to you anyway. Yeah, those were kind of the two cases that I have. I actually did hear in in high level, I did set up basically, instead of a voicemail to where it goes to the built in AI agent in here, and basically wants to take a message and does it that way. Yep, and so more as an after hours, or somebody calls in and, you know, you're not able to get to it, it goes through and ask you some of the questions, and, you know, basically takes a message for to be able to reach back out, yep, if it would I really like, because that one actually does the transcript and the summary, and it'll update name, email address, and it'll do all of that. It will do so much of that, and it it's right in the conversation. So, you know, once they have it to where that AI can do, can do the outbound and do all of that calling, it would be so much easier here. But for right now, I'm working on integrating the other system that I'm that I'm implementing, I'm working on, on getting that implementation working, using web hooks and all that, to get a summary back in. Thanks,

Unknown Speaker  26:53
awesome. Yeah,

Speaker 2  26:55
so I've, I've sweated through it. I've figured out perplexity is my best friend when I'm not sure why it's giving an error

Matthias Miller  27:04
Exactly, exactly, exactly

Speaker 2  27:10
I've never, never done, done much of anything with web hooks, and I had one. It was giving me, you know, why is this? It was, if I did it with Zapier, it was, it was parsing the the data correctly. But if I was using make then, for some reason, I knew some setting wasn't right, and it was just giving me a big old jargon of undecipherable data. And I was like something, so I went over to perplexing like, what do I need to do different so that it parses it out correctly? They're like, Oh, you need to do this. You need to, like, what about this setting on or off? Like, you want that on or this setting on or off? And I went through step by step till then, literally, like, you know what the data is coming through just perfectly fine.

Matthias Miller  27:58
It's awesome.

Speaker 2  28:01
It's still, I still have some hiccups to work out, but yeah, definitely, definitely getting better. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:11
that's really cool. I

Speaker 2  28:26
uh, the testing is where it becomes a little bit difficult. Sometimes it's same as same as this. I was trying to make sure my forms and my and my workflows and everything are doing exactly what they what they're supposed to, and then, then it's not. And so you, you want it to always create a contact? Well, it has to be a new contact, because my trigger says it only works on a new contact, not if a context already exists. So by the end of it, I'm having like, 1011, 12 contacts created, and I have to give it a different phone number, a different email Address, 111111123,

Unknown Speaker  29:12
yeah, exactly, exactly.

Speaker 2  29:21
But it has been interesting for me. It's like one of the bigger, bigger projects I have have taken on to figure out like this. And so it's it, you know, I had a lot of the groundwork already, kind of the logic, what I wanted to happen is just making sure all the logic, step by step worked, and figuring out how how to do it, like some of them, if it's a yes, I wanted to do here, if it's a no, it had to go here, but then it still needs to come back into and I learned how to join, join it back in to a you. Know, yes, here, it has a couple of steps. No here, but then it joins, still wanted to go through the rest of the workflow and that, you know, kind of learning as I go, and like, oh, this makes sense.

Matthias Miller  30:16
It's, it's amazing how far, how far this stuff has come?

Unknown Speaker  30:23
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:33
don't tell me I forgot to Reese refresh. I think I think I'm fine. I you

Matthias Miller  30:49
like the opportunity? Opportunity name? I'm not sure how this is going to work with this pipeline, because the do you exact match pipeline name and stages? I

Unknown Speaker  31:05
don't think so.

Matthias Miller  31:09
Do you how much do you care if it's,

Speaker 2  31:11
I don't really on most of this. On the

Matthias Miller  31:14
import, the status should be fine, opportunity, value, okay, and then this guy is the contact

Unknown Speaker  31:23
hub spot,

Matthias Miller  31:26
all right, so we have the two IDs, all right. Well, let's do first name, last name, email, phone owner, lead, source, create, date, deal, name, pipeline, state, status, deal, value. Do you want any tags? Or we could do a smart list at least, yeah,

Matthias Miller  31:58
yes, they have consented. We're not the sneaky spammers.

Unknown Speaker  32:08
All right, just see Craig.

Unknown Speaker  32:21
I have,

Matthias Miller  32:26
I don't know if there's enough buying intent signals, but, and I don't know if the market would actually support this, but I've been very curious. So you can't do this. You can't do B to C texting, but I've been very curious whether you could do cold calling, outbound prospecting in an economical manner, for sheds, if you had good, low cost English speaking labor

Unknown Speaker  33:04
with, I think,

Matthias Miller  33:08
with a good data model, and I'm going to assume it's triggered to some consumer events, like purchase of a house, marriage, divorce, that there's some something. Some, some triggers you'll have to look for to make it workable. And there's also, you know, demographic information too. But I've been curious, you know, at at,

Matthias Miller  33:48
you can run some back of the numbers, math, if you can, if you could pay, if you could pay somebody like that, I don't know what the going rate is, three grand a month if they can make they're making 2520 times, let's say 300 calls a day, and You're getting a 1% 1% that's 60 leads. That's a it's $50 a lead, if they if they get one, you know, if they hit 1% of those. I mean, if you can get away with paying them $1,500 a month, then all of a sudden, and and you actually can get one out of 100 to raise their hand. You probably actually are close enough to be in the game. And at that point, you're not dependent on the fun thing is, the fun thing, the fun thing is, you're not dependent on the the the. Yeah, like you have control of your lead flow at that point, you're not dependent on if you want to, literally, all you need to do to double lead flow is go hire another person with the same amount, called twice as many numbers,

Speaker 2  35:20
300 times. 26,000, calls times, point 01, yeah, that's 6060,

Speaker 2  35:35
now, if you do it in El Salvador, you can probably get a

Unknown Speaker  35:42
get a

Speaker 2  35:47
call center employee for around $700 a month.

Matthias Miller  35:52
Well, that's so how many years of customer data do you have,

Unknown Speaker  36:04
probably around three

Matthias Miller  36:09
do you have anything? Do you have any friends in the industry that would let you borrow, like, 10 years worth from another area? I don't know if geography affect how much geography affects it.

Speaker 2  36:30
I would think there, there'd be some that, and this would be mostly just basically making a lead out

Matthias Miller  36:41
of it, correct? Yes, I think it's just an appointment setting. Just just appointment setting. Now, I've heard all kinds of people say, This is what baffles me a little bit. I've had all kinds of people say, there's I had, I forget who it was. There's a big company in the southeast region dealer model, they said they've tried appointment setting, and they had such a high drop off rate on the handoff. But it seems to me, I mean, but other industries do this, so surely, if there's some version of Look, you've qualified for something special and and I can't tell you about it, but this other person can, or, you know, I don't know what, what that actually ends up being, but

Speaker 2  37:38
there, There is a certain aspect to it, where the person So Joshua, my nephew, he was he was just on trying to get some more experience. He ended up taking another job that he worked evenings, cold calling for real estate agents,

Unknown Speaker  38:06
and

Speaker 2  38:09
with the experience that he already had calling customers and objection handling and that kind of thing, he I think he did better than their Average caller did as far as the amount of appointments he was able to set, and you know, how he was able to overcome some of their objections, just because of the training that he has had. But I know this was just, this was absolutely, he said, you know, if you it's not something that I would enjoy doing really, because it's strictly cold calling. It's like, it's like, ice cold. Especially, he was doing it in the evening. So he was mostly interrupting people's dinner plans. You

Matthias Miller  38:55
can't do it any other it's the worst thing, but you can't reach them any other time. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  39:06
but I

Speaker 2  39:09
I would see some, some benefit in in doing that. I'm just thinking of, you know, people that have big lists. I would even say some of my competitors here would probably have some decent sized lists, like Eagle ridge or wolf Valley or some of those probably have a fairly strong list.

Unknown Speaker  39:32
All that you need

Matthias Miller  39:35
is and I think you could sign some kind of agreement with them, where you send it to the third party processor to put together the data model, and then that processor can use. I mean, basically what you do is you take your you take your customer list, you map it against who else is in that. Region. And then, what are the, what are the correlating and positive and negatively negative correlating factors? And then you rerun that exact same. Then you use those factors to build your highest probability list, and you start with the ones who are. You know, 95% or whatever the you know, 95 percentile correlation, or something like that. And then you just start working through the list. But also given, given buying cycles, I would also expect that there's no reason why you can't call them every, I mean, at least once a year, every nine months. I don't know. I don't, I don't know. We drive a bonkers, but

Speaker 2  40:46
they're, you know, if you don't get an answer, you could probably call them once a week.

Matthias Miller  40:52
I think you could. Yeah, okay, well, let's see what this All looks like.

Unknown Speaker  41:16
Does this this doesn't

Speaker 2  41:26
so on the on the contacts, it looks like they're going to look at show stats. So the opportunity, opportunities look like it errored out.

Unknown Speaker  41:43
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  41:48
Okay, let's go back to the whole action. Let's see if it has show stats. There you go. That's what you're looking at. Error, yeah, see

Speaker 2  41:54
what it doesn't. Pipeline is deleted or does not exist. So that's why it did not do it on the pipeline and ensure the pipeline so it was trying to match the pipeline.

Matthias Miller  42:16
So let's go

Speaker 2  42:18
if we wouldn't import the pipeline name,

Matthias Miller  42:25
sure. Let's just do a

Matthias Miller  42:32
how do opportu? Okay, let's try this. Let's do this again. Then I think we're going to want to do both, so that it knows to link, and we'll still create opportunities, create update contacts,

Unknown Speaker  42:52
so duplicate phone found

Speaker 2  42:58
pipeline is deleted, so you so if there is a phone number already in there is it a way that it can do it with without just add the fields? I

Matthias Miller  43:26
Let's download this and see.

Speaker 2  43:32
Yeah, I was looking at his 511 pages, and so I didn't

Matthias Miller  43:38
want to scroll through. So there are some

Matthias Miller  43:49
and could not read the phone number. Now, some of these are because the phone number isn't

Unknown Speaker  44:00
correct.

Unknown Speaker  44:03
Let me raise it. Pipeline duplicate phone number found.

Unknown Speaker  44:18
Pipeline is deleted. I just

Unknown Speaker  44:28
could not read the phone number,

Speaker 2  44:35
which I'm not sure what that phone number is. It's literally downloading

Matthias Miller  44:39
every single that download is just downloading every single page. Gracious.

Unknown Speaker  44:46
I downloaded it as as a full full thing. Yeah, I.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
I guess I just did just

Matthias Miller  45:01
the errors, just the errors, and that's where I had been,

Unknown Speaker  45:22
just looking 2023, at Gmail. I think there's an issue with that email address.

Matthias Miller  45:33
So it's, it's, it's, I don't know it's, it's, it's doing each part as a separate thing for me. So I don't

Speaker 2  45:41
know why. Okay, okay, so mine is showing the errors. Is only on the pipelines.

Matthias Miller  45:51
Are you seeing any? I mean, there's a in the in the page I saw, there were a handful of contact,

Speaker 2  45:56
yeah, there, there, there were just a handful of them, the real let me

Matthias Miller  46:05
so if we just change, if you don't care what stage they come into, we can just push it into the shed sales pipeline, leave stage blank.

Speaker 1  46:19
Yeah. I we're

Unknown Speaker  46:26
not imported,

Speaker 2  46:36
okay, so I can see where, where some of them probably the phone number was Put as NC, which I'm think means

Unknown Speaker  47:02
it looks like there were

Speaker 2  47:07
no contact or it didn't, didn't work. So the one I was able to verify, the reason it didn't is because it they, basically they put some identifier in the phone number that doesn't exist, a wrong number or something like that, something like

Matthias Miller  47:25
that. Should we?

Matthias Miller  47:34
How concerned are you about I mean, we could? I

Unknown Speaker  47:44
I'm just

Speaker 2  47:48
so my question is, if we look at at all the contacts that are in here, it is saying we have 9959

Matthias Miller  48:02
and see, we said,

Unknown Speaker  48:04
HubSpot should have had like 16,000

Matthias Miller  48:10
I was only able to pull about 10,000

Speaker 2  48:14
that's API. I think, I think HubSpot has a has a 10,000 API limit.

Matthias Miller  48:20
So we're gonna have to

Unknown Speaker  48:29
well,

Matthias Miller  48:34
because on some of these other ones,

Matthias Miller  48:41
and I tried doing an incremental scan where look for the first 10,000 since eternity past, and then the next 10,000 From

Matthias Miller  48:58
but if we you know from there forward,

Unknown Speaker  49:06
If we would look at create date,

Matthias Miller  49:17
last right,

Speaker 2  49:18
303 103 165 days gives us about 6056

Matthias Miller  49:29
so we have for literally, yeah, we're seeing

Unknown Speaker  49:37
Create date is is only

Matthias Miller  49:41
able to get through 2024 like April, 2024

Unknown Speaker  49:46
so if we would go

Unknown Speaker  49:53
January, 21

Unknown Speaker  49:56
2024 i. Yeah, that is 9684 are you able to do it to where you do an export prior to 2024 and then an export from January 1, 2024 to present.

Matthias Miller  50:20
Let me here. Let's try this. So let's do

Matthias Miller  50:36
so we're doing. Hang

Unknown Speaker  50:42
on. Let me

Matthias Miller  50:58
okay so we're doing create date by 100 or sorry, create data sending hundreds of times it's going to take, Take a little bit till We get to 10,000 I'm

Matthias Miller  51:48
Okay, so then

Unknown Speaker  51:58
Here, if I

Matthias Miller  52:20
uh, so when I so the way of it's working is, oh, that's Part of the issue. Probably, filter property. This should be sort property,

Matthias Miller  52:50
and then, since ISO should be I'm

Unknown Speaker  53:04
Let's try this. I'm

Matthias Miller  53:39
7002, 1008,

Matthias Miller  53:53
nine. Okay, so when I do,

Matthias Miller  54:02
I read, 10,000 then I say, get everything with where the create date, the con, the create date is greater than, or equal to, September 320, 24 so I mean everything prior is, everything I got, is prior to that?

Unknown Speaker  54:20
Okay,

Matthias Miller  54:21
oh, hang on, yeah, it's working. Never mind. This will get us this will get us more so.

Speaker 3  54:40
Simple sort property. Let's do this lead source and create the.

Matthias Miller  55:03
So then, no calls objects, Okay, it's going

Unknown Speaker  55:16
this one I'm

Matthias Miller  56:00
all Right, I think we got a whole bunch more calls because of that. We'll see. We might be in for A big fat export here. I

Matthias Miller  56:46
all right calls are In March of 2025, all

Matthias Miller  58:15
I mean, at the risk of boring Here, you can at least watch it crank here, I

Unknown Speaker  58:33
What

Speaker 2  58:36
is the the status of the of the web hook integration?

Matthias Miller  58:41
Oh, that reminds me it's coming in through it. It should be working, but I realized there's some custom fields I forgot to Create.

Unknown Speaker  58:59
And let me go ahead and those up. I'm

Speaker 2  59:25
yeah, I'm glad you understand that, because I am lost.

Matthias Miller  59:31
Yeah, well, it's, it's actually shocking. I mean, I understand it, but it's also shocking how much AI can, it's just a sidekick, and I can go tell it to

Unknown Speaker  59:41
go do stuff. It's just yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:46
some opportunity. Okay,

Speaker 3  59:54
don't need that. Don't need that. That's.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:17
All right, so Let me start. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
this must be The opportunity I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
I said it wrong. I

Speaker 3  1:02:45
Hey, Mark Miller, Patrick Davis, here, please give me a call and get a chance. 512-569-5160, just want to check out the two building states you

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
I should do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:22
The other thing I'm

Matthias Miller  1:03:44
I see there's this One, but then there's also, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
Sky And

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
I this is what it is.

Matthias Miller  1:04:42
Actually, just do there's no reason this is come on. I.

Matthias Miller  1:05:46
So this will

Matthias Miller  1:05:57
it's a custom app I made so that when I um,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:04
why is it not let's at least try.

Matthias Miller  1:06:16
So on website fields, it pops up into a link, and you can Control click and drop into it. Okay, and then we'll drop the Shut up.

Matthias Miller  1:06:33
Here's a shut up one should Well, this is, wait

Unknown Speaker  1:06:41
a Minute. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20
That's not right, you

Speaker 2  1:07:55
on on the web hook here it says this endpoint requires verification. Web hooks will not be delivered until the endpoint has been verified.

Matthias Miller  1:08:05
Hit verify. That's where it should be set up on my end. Okay, it verified right now. Okay, there we go. And if there's any issues pushing them across, I'll find out I forgot that you had to go back in and verify it, but yeah, so

Matthias Miller  1:08:35
there may be some quotes from the last 24 hours that need manual opportunity creation.

Speaker 2  1:08:49
Okay, so if I do just a test one right now, it should probably push through,

Matthias Miller  1:08:56
should and if not, we can, it'll show up in my end And I can troubleshoot. I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46
see,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
all right? Like, see what's going on. This is order link field.

Matthias Miller  1:10:04
We do need that one. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
My Gosh, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:11:53
I Think okay, just if you can see it

Unknown Speaker  1:13:15
in opportunities, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:13:24
okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
20 6pm this is July. Why is this saying? July 15.

Speaker 1  1:14:01
There it is. I said To refresh mine. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
Is it not mapped yet to the i?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:04
To the stage. Yes, it is

Matthias Miller  1:15:10
this one we said when it's

Matthias Miller  1:15:39
we'll create just the event that's getting triggered here. But most like I think I originally had it as new lead.

Matthias Miller  1:16:02
Hang on, did I do that for sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:20
This quote sent, sort

Matthias Miller  1:16:26
of the order. So

Matthias Miller  1:16:40
this is a little bit of a misnomer. The Order create stage is for quotes or orders themselves, which is why we've historically like, in most cases we would have it as a new lead on this event. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:04
Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:17:09
I think, I think that's what you

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
want, that it would be as a new lead. I Okay, we

Matthias Miller  1:17:32
can't distinguish between. Maybe we could. We're not currently distinguishing between. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:17:46
hey, look at that. Uh, between leads that are coming in between when the salesperson creates it for a customer versus when the customer fills it out online. Okay, and so it'll never, it never goes backwards in the opera, in the in the stages, okay?

Speaker 2  1:18:08
What? What happens if, for example, a new lead comes in and we create an opportunity for them? Just blank, zero opportunity. Yeah. What happens when you then create a quote for them and now you have an opportunity? Does it overwrite that other opportunity?

Matthias Miller  1:18:34
It does. Currently, it's a little there's no good way to really handle it, unfortunately, but yeah, at the at the point that it signs, it locks into that Whoa, and it doesn't get overwritten, or what, at the point that it's processed, when it's processed, it gets locked in, it doesn't get overwritten. Where it gets weird is if somebody says, I want a chicken coop, and I want a, I don't know, guard shed of some kind, like, there's not a good way to

Speaker 2  1:19:09
handle that. Every time it's going back and forth, it is overriding from one to the other, right? Okay, okay, that makes sense. I

Matthias Miller  1:19:24
Okay, so we have here a file that's probably now huge, but let's go find out. Here we should open this up and whatever numbers. Why not? I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:53
still not

Matthias Miller  1:19:55
showing the full the.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33
Right? Because it's

Unknown Speaker  1:20:36
not Truly I'm

Matthias Miller  1:21:57
I'm a little confused because I'm

Matthias Miller  1:22:22
I thought I had, I thought it was pulling more than 10,000 content. I thought I had, it actually pulling more than 10,000 contacts.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:42
I see there it's,

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
let's read Those.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:20
No, it's Not

Unknown Speaker  1:23:29
Found 10,000 I

Matthias Miller  1:25:00
So when I try to pull I'm

Matthias Miller  1:25:27
that's baffling To me. I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
so it's cutting you off with those 10,000 it

Matthias Miller  1:26:21
is, and it is, and it doesn't seem to be. If I try to rerun filtering for any anything with the create date after the last it was 10,000 it's not.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
It's not, it's not wanting to, yeah, and

Matthias Miller  1:26:40
I'm not sure if that's something that's

Matthias Miller  1:26:54
just create date,

Matthias Miller  1:27:01
yeah. Last month, let me try something. You know what?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07
You try something? I

Unknown Speaker  1:27:49
see if it'll take that

Matthias Miller  1:27:52
might be A weird some inconsistent naming with contact fields. I

Matthias Miller  1:28:37
There we go. I think we're cranking now

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
there looks like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:52
So we'll see if teen, 16,

Matthias Miller  1:29:05
there we go. There

Unknown Speaker  1:29:06
we go, yeah, that looks that looks correct.

Matthias Miller  1:29:09
Okay, so that'll give us, then a bunch more opportunity that explains some of the unlinked deals. Actually, I

Unknown Speaker  1:30:06
Okay, now let me,

Speaker 3  1:30:14
is this I'm

Matthias Miller  1:30:38
Great that restarted To get the I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:31:04
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:31:07
so

Matthias Miller  1:31:14
I'm so then, if we Go down to the end,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:36
should see I'm

Matthias Miller  1:31:42
it's getting us through 225

Matthias Miller  1:31:53
that is,

Matthias Miller  1:32:01
that doesn't seem Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:12
Let's do this. Oh, no, do that. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:32:36
so that part actually means the number of rows looks right I'm uh, 2025, dash, oh, six.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:53
Okay, come on,

Matthias Miller  1:32:58
maybe it's just the sorting. So here's one from there. Should have one from oh seven. Yeah, there we go. All right, sweet. So now let's try this. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:33:26
18 megs, I suppose three or six or whatever it

Unknown Speaker  1:33:36
was, yeah, yeah, about six

Unknown Speaker  1:33:42
have to Think a little bit longer On this One.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:44
Exactly. I

Matthias Miller  1:35:28
Okay, Well, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:37:17
Okay, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:37:23
well,

Matthias Miller  1:37:29
it really, really, really does not like us. I

Matthias Miller  1:37:49
Where's my Slack Channel here.

Matthias Miller  1:39:27
We know that it can so 16,000 rows, it grew by, sorry, three, six times. So if we do like, surely, we could do like 3000 rows.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:55
I. Is that the next

Unknown Speaker  1:40:23
Okay, sounds Good. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:43:23
we could just may just need to chunk it. I don't know if there's any other i

Unknown Speaker  1:43:44
see i

Matthias Miller  1:44:00
Uh. So we could probably also get away With like 9000 let's try it once I'm

Matthias Miller  1:45:02
You write it

Matthias Miller  1:45:14
up, it's over. It's still over 10 Meg, so let's do since We're doing three anyway, let's do Like 6000 I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:46:07
Yep, squeaking by, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:46:53
that still didn't work.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:56
Well, we're back to this. Then see if we

Matthias Miller  1:47:00
can at least get one of These guys To I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:49:06
I'm What error is it giving there?

Matthias Miller  1:50:17
It's not showing any error. Is the weird thing I have To close this To hit Next. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:51:50
Have you played around with the MCP server yet?

Unknown Speaker  1:51:55
MCP server

Matthias Miller  1:51:58
tying being able to chat with go high level data. It's, it's on my, on my list to do, I just haven't yet. Me email you this video. You

Matthias Miller  1:52:22
get your sales guys trained on it too. You

Matthias Miller  1:52:39
can literally chat with chat with it and have it update contacts and do stuff like that, send him The message, send such and such A message that I

Unknown Speaker  1:53:06
Okay, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:54:04
CP server is live, Okay? I'm

Matthias Miller  1:57:02
workflow. How workflow. How will this MCP are have to watch the video. I mean, I want to start playing around with. will this MCP are have to watch the video. I'm gonna guess i. this MCP are have to watch the video. see how it will I mean, there's all kinds of there's like. how it will help them in their day to day like the fields wide open. day workflow. Uh, W. uh, yeah. I mean, I want to start playing around with like, I mean, there's all kinds of, there's like, the fields wide open, like, look at RFM and tell me who I need to be following up with. Or, you know, like, build me. Build me my top five call list right now. Well, here's people, latest, latest in the pipeline, whatever, and you could continue finessing that prompt. But imagine, imagine if you were a salesperson showing up, and you didn't have to think about what to do. That's one example. The other thing is, hey, can you go find me? Everybody who, and I don't know how deep in The messages and stuff they go, but Everybody that I Sorry. They're they're really. Uh, that 10 Meg limit is completely made up. There's some other limitation that's not actual size of the CSV that's making it blow up. And they're just saying 10 megs because it gives a clear answer, yeah, All right, well, let's try six megs. I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:00:29
resist the Air just Sitting I

Unknown Speaker  2:02:09
dokie, I'm

Matthias Miller  2:03:40
I'm gonna have to drop off here in about 20 minutes. We've got a commitment this evening. Okay? I so hopefully we have enough direction, at least on what's going on. Okay, and I should be I see what's going on tomorrow. Mike, cross your fingers. I should be. I could probably do I should be. I should be, I should be able to do a, do a we got a commitment until from like until like 730 I might be able to pick it up 830 my time, if we need to. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:46
and

Speaker 2  2:04:52
very good. I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch that video on that MCP and play around with that.

Matthias Miller  2:04:58
Yep. I. Recommend. Sounds good? Well, I will. There's, there's probably no reason really to to hang around much more. Oh, if I have anything meaningful, text you an update before I get out of the office. But

Unknown Speaker  2:05:14
okay, if not,

Matthias Miller  2:05:16
I'll keep you posted.

Speaker 2  2:05:18
Okay, very good. And then, okay, one question that I had for you on on phone calls. Is there a way to change the outcome of a phone call, whether it went to voicemail or to you connected with them or hold

Matthias Miller  2:05:36
like a call this position?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:38
Yes,

Matthias Miller  2:05:42
I think, I think they have it on our dialer,

Speaker 2  2:05:47
our dialer. There is on that one. There is now there. There is something in the phone configuration. When you're, you're look at it when I, when I set up the phone numbers, there is a setting in there, and it says, enable call connect feature. The call connect feature requires a receiver to press a key to connect the call. Please update the Whisper message accordingly. So I'm not exactly sure how that works, but it's like you have to, if you do connect, you have to press a button or something, and then it will log something. Is what I understood from that.

Matthias Miller  2:06:31
Yeah, that's basically, so the phone rings. So basically so that you could do a caller. I here's if you send calls to your cell phone, then your phone rings. It has a random call ID. You answer if they start talking. It's a personal call, if not. The Whisper message says, Hey, you have a lead from from SunView builders, press one to connect, and then you because it's on your personal cell you get to decide whether you want to take it or cure or not. That's where that okay,

Speaker 2  2:07:06
but if it's right on here, it's not really going to make a difference.

Matthias Miller  2:07:14
No, that it's it's disconnected from call. It's not related to call disposition,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:19
okay, okay.

Speaker 2  2:07:27
Okay, that makes sense, because I know on the power dialer, I did see that that you can select the call disposition, but in any other call that you make, I couldn't figure out a way to update the call record itself or anything like that.

Matthias Miller  2:07:49
Let me see if there's features available for both individual and manual. No, here's I'm seeing a you

Unknown Speaker  2:08:19
See if map this position I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:09:00
your collections I'm

Matthias Miller  2:09:25
I'm not sure that there is.

Speaker 2  2:09:42
Yeah, I wasn't either seeing anything. I just thought I'd ask to see what

Matthias Miller  2:09:52
it's, yeah, it's again, kind of you. That, that there's not But I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:10:32
Okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:42
so, okay, very good. All right, sounds good. Okay, have good evening. You do appreciate it. Okay, bye.
