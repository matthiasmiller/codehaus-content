Matthias Miller  00:25
This is Mark Hey Mark

Unknown Speaker  00:36
how's your day going?

Matthias Miller  00:38
Pretty good kind of a little bit of a classic neck completely reaching around but what's done will be done and what's not will not

Unknown Speaker  00:51
yeah

Unknown Speaker  01:10
well should I reach out to Drew

Matthias Miller  01:20
good thank you for holding we will return shortly

Speaker 1  01:43
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Speaker 1  02:01
thank you for holding. We will return shortly

Unknown Speaker  02:19
thank you for holding. We will return shortly.

Matthias Miller  02:35
Lamberth is still here.

Speaker 1  02:39
Drew did not answer I left a message but I think I know what he's wanting. And I can try to explain it I guess if he shows up good. If not, we'll just

Unknown Speaker  02:52
Sure. So where is he? Well, he basically. So Whitney has gone through and marked everything. He did a reconcile and then she's gone through and marked everything

Speaker 1  03:12
paid in assists that she believes he paid. So we're basically done with QuickBooks. So what drew is saying is, but can you go through and find all your report or whatever, find all prepaid approved statuses and do work your magic to change all of those to paid status. Which, and then immediately after that, push those. Well, I guess it okay, if you do that now, I believe when that pushes to accounting tonight. Saturday morning drew would come in and all of those transactions would now appear as transactions in accounting.

Matthias Miller  04:13
It shouldn't happen with out that.

Speaker 1  04:16
Oh, so you don't even need to. So, I mean, what typically happens is, is when he goes in, or any user goes in money, it's usually Whitney. But she goes in and says, Oh, yeah, I paid this. So I just updated this to paid and you're saying that immediately update or pushes a transaction into accounting?

Matthias Miller  04:37
I mean, tonight, it's based on weight. My understanding is that it should, but I'm not sure if there's another issue. Let me let me see if there's an issue that's not 18 438 Let's do this. Oh

Matthias Miller  05:19
what's up some of these are going to a credit cards paid parent payment account. Like there's one for eBay that the payment of an account is credit cards because that's not a valid it's not a valid account

Unknown Speaker  05:37
Okay, do you have a lot of them that are going to parent accounts

Matthias Miller  05:42
Yeah, let me Yes, I think so. Did she do this did you do this reconciliation today or was it earlier?

Unknown Speaker  05:51
It was earlier I believe. Yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  05:54
why they're not I'm gonna guess we got a lot of Let me try transaction errors. Let's do this for just for vendor invoices. And this is still going to take a really long time to run but I think it will but let's see if let's see how long this thing takes we're at nine might not be that bad

Speaker 1  06:17
yeah, it would only be on vendor invoices there would not be any hit up transactions they would all be tied to vendor invoices.

Matthias Miller  06:45
Can I get back from the model now I'm confused cuz the errors report does not appear to be working

Speaker 1  07:04
oh there is Drew let me know

Speaker 1  07:15
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Matthias Miller  07:24
if there's any and

Speaker 2  07:33
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Speaker 1  07:51
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Speaker 2  08:09
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Unknown Speaker  08:27
as Drew is joining on the Zoom call so

Matthias Miller  08:34
sounds good. I'll keep my eye open for him here. I recently broke the errors report so that's part of the issue. So I am while he's coming on I'm going to quick fix that though that that'll get fixed in the update tonight so that we've got that working but then I will also

Matthias Miller  09:05
also create a custom version of that so that we can

Matthias Miller  09:15
see the errors and take a look at that?

Matthias Miller  09:55
Okay, hey, Drew. Alright, so I found part of the problem here. Um I was not I made some changes in the year end changes that I made I accidentally broke our transaction errors report so we've got a bunch of vendor invoices assigned to the credit cards parent account, which is problematic. And then there are a few other miscellaneous debits and credits don't match Accounts Payable date I'm not sure why this one

Matthias Miller  10:47
ABC non Pio purchases current. It looks like we have an unmapped. GL account

Matthias Miller  11:12
we have yeah this one this one is not mapped I don't know what the GL account should be on this one that's why this one's not coming across

Unknown Speaker  11:33
go back to that mapping

Matthias Miller  11:35
page

Speaker 3  11:41
okay, that's just that's from the GL from the inventory side

Unknown Speaker  11:47
yeah

Unknown Speaker  11:56
I can open it up and which company has this

Matthias Miller  11:59
it's ABC I can drop both links in the Zoom chat for you

Unknown Speaker  12:21
know what you should go to

Matthias Miller  12:35
thank you Malcolm the chart of accounts so I'd be the place step

Matthias Miller  12:44
that's also building purchase there

Unknown Speaker  12:51
this was

Unknown Speaker  12:58
just

Speaker 3  13:08
you can assets

Unknown Speaker  13:30
FDI purchases buildings is what that was right.

Matthias Miller  13:34
Yeah. It was Yeah, I mean, it's a vendor's cricket Valley. Non Pio purchase of a building

Unknown Speaker  13:53
okay, that account is now mapped for ABC,

Matthias Miller  13:56
K, and then vinyl structures is using the revenue discounts, returns and allowances. account

Matthias Miller  14:21
and final structures also needs the buildings account as well the image rigor

Speaker 3  14:30
is there a blog to keep them from using parent accounts? Or unmapped accounts?

Matthias Miller  14:38
No, not not currently. I think it's something somewhere that we've got written up but not hasn't made to the top of the list yet.

Speaker 3  15:06
Now is that discounts, returns and allowances

Matthias Miller  15:13
revenue discounts returns and allowances okay

Matthias Miller  15:40
looks like ABC has one for that vendor invoice for that same one

Matthias Miller  16:33
so I guess to be

Matthias Miller  16:41
you you want to map this one for ABC yet

Speaker 3  16:47
yeah that's the returns allowances I got the vinyl structures once

Matthias Miller  17:01
I guess I mean taking a step back if the vendor invoices that you the link that said you sent over if these get pushed into accounting does that ultimately solve the problem that you're after or am I misunderstanding the problem here um

Speaker 3  17:29
so the way I understand what those is the like they would not have gotten pushed to accounting yet because they're not not marked as paid when they like I looked up several in the last and they were not there were no transactions for them

Matthias Miller  17:58
yeah that's because of it I think I have to do a little bit here let's let me do this I'm 90% sure that if we do

Matthias Miller  18:11
and and IDs and VX King cat I mean they should somewhere here we should have a few of them the invoice let's do po payment

Matthias Miller  18:32
now am I the training account trans transaction ID Okay, so Okay, let's try this account impact errors

Matthias Miller  18:57
Okay, so they're the errors. Why would that went? Okay, let's try not these will all be non Pio payments. Let's see which ones of those have. Still not.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
So are you saying these shouldn't be in accounting or

Matthias Miller  19:18
I would have expected them to be so this is modified on Friday. Now this one was created today this one wouldn't be but surely some of these older ones somewhere should have been five prepaid and verified. I mean, they they get pushed over as soon as they have a payment date. So they would have gotten pushed should have gotten pushed over on the 15th already. I think Okay, so let me let's get back to this guy. All right. So that's okay, let's let's make sure the nightly time askers running post API transactions and counter warnings so it should have yeah transactions records okay so we make sure that I wrote this piece of snow event type plus oh hang on I did this wrong baby

Matthias Miller  21:07
okay so some of them did not 124 Why did this one not yet

Matthias Miller  21:23
so clearly some of them did

Unknown Speaker  21:27
okay

Matthias Miller  21:30
now I wonder if there's a separate that's you know these are all prepaid approved

Matthias Miller  21:40
so why would this one

Speaker 1  21:48
because when when is it supposed to post to accounting when it's moved to status of paid or prepaid approved?

Matthias Miller  21:56
It's actually based on the payment date as soon as the payment date is specified, it gets pushed across as of that date.

Unknown Speaker  22:06
Oh, okay. I was way off on that

Matthias Miller  22:18
let me try one other thing and see if

Speaker 1  22:26
Drew will that create any problems for accounting or not? I mean, is that moving it to paid is just simply making it disappear off of the AP list?

Speaker 3  22:37
Right That doesn't that doesn't create any issues on that hand well, why were they are they simply popping up on prepaid approved after Whitney goes through just because they're late or is there more to that? Like they're entered late because that's kind of the other questions that I had. I mean, it'll be a problem if if they get you know if they don't ever move across because of some issue like what is looking like in some of these so why don't we get the problem sorted this problem

Matthias Miller  23:26
so the that issue will be fixed by okay now I lost my modified customers report right let's hide and show this again let's see what else is going on and transaction errors report was was not working so there was no way to find these these guys but if we just go through and clean up all of these should get pushed across so we've got credit cards this parent accounts those need to be cleaned up here we have what's this one? This one is not mapped long term liabilities notes payable negative current

Unknown Speaker  24:10
oh yeah

Matthias Miller  24:16
here are these looks like current assets. Production overhead breakroom supplies is not mapped perhaps let's see. Where are we right here. I mean, it looks like that's the issue this Yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:49
More missing mapping, we can see what is this net a current one equipment and repairs as parent account more unmapped Biden's I'm gonna guess it's a lot of these are basically the same missing but the unmapped items. Let me check this out though because I wonder if the unmapped accounts is actually working correctly so lope unmatched This is unmatched ledger accounts all ledger accounts non Pio Pio what oh let's try this let's see what ABC has to say ABC says it let's do this

Matthias Miller  25:53
let's see if there's anybody and get nobody in 2024 So let's go to this one was

Matthias Miller  26:09
ABC

Matthias Miller  26:15
so why would that one not be this was this is all the way back from October so I'm sure this one is so this one might not push across but you might not care about it because it was so long ago

Speaker 3  26:43
so pretty much if they're not across is because some error with the transaction not necessarily a system problem. Right error behind the transaction anyway.

Matthias Miller  26:55
Yeah, like here if you pull up said time you can see these guys that aren't getting pushed across well structures appears to have all active accounts pushed across and then if you if you want to double check as a start up here, change this date to January and if the report is completely empty then then all the transactions have been pushed across or will push across as at the beginning of the year oops let's do 12 Okay, so 12 One ABC vs

Matthias Miller  27:41
wait I mean maybe it just is the it looks like November may be the most recent

Matthias Miller  28:00
where we've got stuff that doesn't push across

Unknown Speaker  28:06
well like that net of current doesn't even exist anymore.

Matthias Miller  28:10
Right it is still listed as a as an active ledger account.

Unknown Speaker  28:16
Well Which company are you in? I might be correct times words oh

Matthias Miller  28:45
sure where are these gets set up anyway, okay, so I mean there is the bottom line

Matthias Miller  29:06
so I can vary would you work on cleanup this afternoon if you had this

Speaker 3  29:13
Yeah, well, yeah, it would be a couple hours to get to it. Maybe two hours I get to it but

Matthias Miller  29:19
okay, let me just going to create a temporary version of this so that you can you can keep working at it if you want to and then fix will come live tomorrow tonight in the update

Unknown Speaker  29:32
okay

Speaker 3  29:41
yeah, that account definitely does not exist on in accounting anymore. It's not active. is in my chart of accounts with active only it's not showing up. So

Matthias Miller  29:57
but it needs to be turned off in IMS. And

Unknown Speaker  30:06
then they couldn't use it anymore. So I

Matthias Miller  30:13
the IMS is showing us active okay okay

Speaker 3  30:17
yeah got it um so I need to get my get

Matthias Miller  30:30
yeah

Speaker 3  30:33
I need to get Aaron take that off his list or else if I change it here on the list

Speaker 1  30:39
yeah yep which one is it I can take it off no

Unknown Speaker  30:45
notes payable note of current

Matthias Miller  31:03
oh goodness I remember that was really the wrong way wrong are you seeing it

Unknown Speaker  31:14
abilities opening but

Unknown Speaker  31:22
All right there

Unknown Speaker  31:39
you said it's notes payable

Unknown Speaker  31:43
yeah long term liabilities

Speaker 1  31:52
I see it now i will oh

Unknown Speaker  32:12
this is really really slow

Unknown Speaker  32:34
reading it now

Unknown Speaker  33:09
okay i Well hang on

Unknown Speaker  33:25
making the changes to assist

Unknown Speaker  33:50
buying to save

Matthias Miller  33:58
credit cards as the biggest violator of the parent account

Matthias Miller  34:07
you don't know offhand if all of those would be under the same

Speaker 3  34:14
no probably all be the same. The same the primary one

Matthias Miller  34:22
I mean I guess we could reset them based off of the payment type did we used to have something kind of some kind of report kind of like that that

Speaker 3  34:35
oh to go into default payment type for the vendor?

Matthias Miller  34:38
Yeah. Yeah, we

Speaker 3  34:41
do. These are most likely not going to have the vendor set though.

Matthias Miller  34:53
But if we go like this

Speaker 1  35:01
Save. I just saved it to the Raspberry Pi. So the net notes payable native current should be gone

Matthias Miller  35:22
well it's still showing here but maybe it's not. Not Yeah. Not sure. Like drew here we have payment types for primary CC cap ABC payment account is credit cards. Couldn't we have some kind of bug here? Couldn't we assign given that the payment type is the primary CC cat? Could we assign the for the selected ones? Change these so I could probably see if we if we just take a few minutes to go through here we'll probably fairly quickly clean up so primary Okay, let's go here's credit card. So this one says primary. Well, that one I'll just let you chase. Think that one requires the research that one doesn't say that's all

Matthias Miller  36:42
maybe it's not as those might be actually the easiest ones to clean up if you look here

Unknown Speaker  37:04
is the same vendor invoice numbers?

Matthias Miller  37:09
Number 17. One seven

Unknown Speaker  37:13
months probably? Again.

Matthias Miller  37:18
Jimmy to send this over to you.

Speaker 3  37:23
I'm just do it. I wouldn't worry about it. Well, that's actually that's a 20 Whatever. That's last year one. Right? I wouldn't worry about it.

Matthias Miller  37:42
That was alright. So I guess the bottom line is known the rest of these here's a credit card that says it was paid out of checking that requires research. This one has the same discrepancy. Do you want these? These the payment type or a credit card? Do you want that copied across or

Speaker 3  38:06
do you want to? Um, to get more? E okay. Yeah, no, those would work.

Matthias Miller  38:15
And then here, we don't know what the payment type was. This one that says checking. Here's an Amex that looks like it can be well, yeah, Amex It's looks like it could be

Unknown Speaker  38:30
you can do those.

Matthias Miller  38:33
Okay. And then that's all of those are all of the well, so that's not much but at least it can help you a little bit I think it's just a matter of going through those other transactions and getting those cleaned up

Matthias Miller  39:10
and I also found an issue where checks I introduced the bug again in the in the closeout stuff where all the checks got voided and hadn't been pushed into accounting again.

Unknown Speaker  39:23
Oh, okay. So

Matthias Miller  39:26
that fix will go live tonight. And then tomorrow morning, you'll have shed your checks and accounting again.

Speaker 3  39:34
So it will it will correct whatever the issue was.

Matthias Miller  39:40
You'll lose any reconciliation information that you had for them but yeah, be fine. So is that

Speaker 3  39:53
so are you moving? Are you going to be getting rid of that rebate approved here?

Matthias Miller  40:03
So you want to compete or you want to completely eliminate prepaid approved and change it into paid? Yeah.

Speaker 3  40:13
Because the only difference between the two was the designation for whether Whitney had gotten it recorded or not. Right. And the approved status, if it's not paid, it keeps showing up on the VR.

Matthias Miller  40:35
Alright, so if I do let me yeah, I'll try to I'll try for that. Let me just pull up a. Okay, so anything else that you need for this update?

Unknown Speaker  41:05
No, I don't think so.

Matthias Miller  41:10
Let me Alright, I will chase that then.

Matthias Miller  41:22
Good. Anything from you, Mark that you need?

Speaker 1  41:28
Um, I thought there was something but I mean, so when when can we expect the prepaid approved to go to disappear?

Matthias Miller  41:40
Like, I mean, I can, I think I think I've got some time right now if I mean, if we don't you guys don't need anything else? I think I've got time to do it right now. Unless you guys want to just move it till next week?

Speaker 1  41:57
I mean, so. So the plan is that by Monday, we this would all be switched. Is that correct?

Matthias Miller  42:04
Right.

Speaker 1  42:11
Perfect. I mean, the only other the other thing while there were two questions we had through and I had yesterday, I don't know that we need to get into those now. But you had send out an email that we were a little confused about. Thursday, you said agenda item for after pm update. You said How will this be used? What do you want to see? Right. Oh, was that?

Matthias Miller  42:39
That was attending.

Speaker 1  42:43
Got it? And then the other question was, what I mean, do we have like on the on the duplicate check, duplicate checks issue? What do we know what happened? And do we have resolution that will keep it from happening again in the future? We

Matthias Miller  43:04
have resolution that when you try to reprint checks, it will not print them and it will not assign new check numbers. We have no idea what happened. I think it's a stretch to say that the closest we can come is something with Drew. I don't understand how drew could have a three week old tab open that he would have rerun it, but we also can't find any other satisfactory explanations for why it happened. So we think we we think it's not going to happen. I mean, we plugged the hole so we don't really sign check numbers on top of printed checks. Beyond that, don't know?

Speaker 1  43:59
So like what is what do you just in layman's terms, explain to me the stop gap?

Matthias Miller  44:09
Yeah, if you if you open a window to print the most common sense. Well, I don't know what the most common scenario is. But Drew has two windows open or drew pulls up and wants to print checks. And Whitney pulls it out and wants to print checks. And Drew clicks the Print button. And it goes into science check numbers. Right after drew does that Whitney clicks the button says I want to print. And previously what happened is we would give those checks new check numbers and let Whitney print them again. And instead what's going to happen is Whitney will get some kind of error or blank screen or something and she will not be able to print and when she refreshes the page, she will see that these weren't actually somebody else already printed them.

Speaker 1  45:06
Okay. Makes Yeah, makes sense. So good that that's yeah, bit here.

Speaker 3  45:16
So if you actually reprint a check, then what happens to the check number you can select you can give it a new check number.

Matthias Miller  45:26
If you want to reprint a check with the new check number, you will have to either go blank out the check number and use the unprinted checks feature to print it more you have to type in a new check number and print it directly from the check itself.

Unknown Speaker  45:41
Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  45:42
But you you just can't batch print any check that has a site check number anymore. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
Well, thank you very much. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  46:02
You're welcome. Thanks, Matthias. You bet. Thanks, guys.

Unknown Speaker  46:05
Have a good weekend.

Unknown Speaker  46:07
Yeah. Bye
