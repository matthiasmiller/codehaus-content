Matthias Miller  01:58
Howdy. Howdy. Oh, boy, I do still know, there we go.

Unknown Speaker  02:06
That'll do it every time.

Matthias Miller  02:08
That will that has a way of, yeah, I can really get to you.

Matthias Miller  02:19
Here's your fun little story of the day. So my wife's been getting these phone calls and text messages saying, Hey, we're we're running late to clean your house, like or not. No, we're getting ready to clean your house. Just want to make sure you're going to be there and anything you need. She's like, it's not my house. I don't live there. I grew up in Delaware. I don't live there anymore. Wrong Number, and they're all independent contractor folks and so, and nobody does anything about it. Well, I found out that you can log into the account through the link that they send by text message. So I should have done something that's interesting, like switched it to, like, an AI phone number or something to give them some kind of rigmarole that chase them on a

Speaker 1  03:06
while you should, you should have switched to your actual address. You get free house cleaning.

Matthias Miller  03:12
That's actually kind of funny.

Speaker 1  03:14
Somebody, somebody's paying for this service. You know, somebody's

Matthias Miller  03:17
paying for this service. I don't know if they operate in Colorado anyway. So what I ended up doing is I redirected the number to the local Walmart. So,

Speaker 1  03:29
so Walmart's gonna be getting phone calls from a cleaning service. Thing I were exactly

Matthias Miller  03:36
the poor the poor cleaning lady is gonna call him up. Be like, Wait, Smyrna, Walmart. Like, no, this is that. Am I cleaning what anyway for somebody to deal with? Somebody at Walmart's gonna get wise and go like, Oh, free cleaning service. I gotta direct them to my house Exactly. Yeah, the wrong address. Now, man, this is what happens when somebody puts in the wrong phone number, and my wife's been getting tormented with text messages and phone calls from people trying to clean her house, and she's keeps insisting that it's not her house. She lives in Colorado, not Delaware, and nobody, apparently nobody's capable of comprehending that or making any changes because of that. And so I took the matter into my own hands.

Speaker 2  04:25
Well, it's probably just the AP people that put that phone number in so that they could get a check written out.

Matthias Miller  04:33
Yeah, exactly. It's probably all for the address. Yeah. To man. All right, Seth is Seth forgot about the call this morning, and he's going to call in from the road and he'll be on another 15 minutes or so, he'll be on but

Unknown Speaker  04:56
oh, where's he heading? Just.

Matthias Miller  05:00
Coming into the office. That's all, nothing super profound.

Speaker 1  05:08
I thought maybe he was on some trip to go bird watching or something like that.

Matthias Miller  05:14
He tried to. He went hunting yesterday, came up, came came out empty handed, but it's worth a try. All right. Well, how's, how's life in Ohio?

Unknown Speaker  05:34
Oh, cold,

Matthias Miller  05:38
sorry, I don't have anything I can hang over your

Unknown Speaker  05:43
head. Our first significant snow.

Unknown Speaker  05:46
Cool, yeah,

Speaker 2  05:51
there's, there's an old wives fable. I think that something like the day of the month of the first snow that you get that's over two inches is the number of snows that you'll have, significant snows that you have that winter. So I hope that holds out, because that would mean we have two and we've had one now, so we're halfway there, December 2.

Matthias Miller  06:17
That's great. I have a feeling

Speaker 3  06:21
those old wives fables, typically the reason they're they're true, for the people that try to make them true, they they see all the reasons why. Yeah, it also helped you last year and the year before, it's a day off. But yeah, it was closed. And so we can't

Unknown Speaker  06:39
really count, because there mean,

Speaker 4  06:43
it was a day off November talks about, let's just say something why it's basically, the

Matthias Miller  06:53
problem with being a day off is it could be November 30 or December 1. And so that's a small detail.

Speaker 2  07:02
There's just a difference as to whether you count having come the evening before or during the morning or

Speaker 3  07:14
good. Well, I just one other note. I was looking at the shed Business Journal, and I quickly read Matthias article. And I also read something about only where three RTO companies mentioned, and only was RTO smart, RTO national, and only they did that didn't elaborate very much. It just said providing some innovative tools for managing contracts or something like that.

Speaker 1  07:45
It's nice when people get you free publicity that you didn't know about.

Speaker 3  07:49
Wow, I wouldn't say the the the way you were mentioned, there was just like, you know, was just another company that was listed. It didn't really do justice to what you're doing.

Unknown Speaker  08:03
So, oh, still, I mean, it's, I don't know anything about it, yeah, that was more

Unknown Speaker  08:10
than that was said the last time the journal came out. So

Speaker 1  08:20
you're saying last time, right? Exactly. I need to reach out to Marty. I should, I should, I should provide him with some information. I, I, I cringe about putting too much out. I've, I literally have started an email about once or twice now to Shannon Lathan on the on the podcast as well. But it's like, well, if you generate all this, you know, publicity, and then it's like, they call you up and say, All right, we want to get on board. Like, oh, sorry, we're not ready to put people on boards yet. And then it's like, it's kind of deflating.

Matthias Miller  08:53
Well, there's enough of the not to be too critical. There's enough of that that happens already. I think the people that you really want to, want to attract as customers are the ones who prefer, prefer reality and announcing it when it's when it's closer to ready than hyping it up 12 months before.

Speaker 1  09:16
But, yeah, but the flip side of that is there's kind of this expectation in the industry that you start yapping about it long before you're ready for this kind of stuff, and then it's like, I don't know. Yeah, maybe, maybe I'll use, I'll use your idea, but I use your idea, Matthias, and I'll have a booth at the shed Expo in 2026 with a Ferrari at the booth or something like that. You know,

Matthias Miller  09:52
exactly just, I mean, can't be that expensive to rent it for day? Yeah, or two days. You know, it's. Few days, yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  10:01
know, yeah, put a Lamborghini or put a Bentley there this year. Sorry, what was it?

Unknown Speaker  10:12
Oh, I said, What did you this year?

Matthias Miller  10:17
I still didn't. I still didn't catch the word dropped out one more, one more time.

Speaker 3  10:22
Oh, I said, What did, what did you do in your booth this year?

Matthias Miller  10:26
It was just a very simple booth. I didn't do anything.

Unknown Speaker  10:31
Idea that. Okay, it

Matthias Miller  10:32
was just my idea. I told my idea was probably more of a cut. I was like, I don't know. I get very cynical of the See, I'm the wrong kind of guy for this. This is why. This is why, every time I've drifted over to the sales world, I always run it by numbers and drift back my way but I get very cynical of all the celebrity by association. So you know, whether it's a whether it's a Ferrari, or whether it's a supercar of some kind, or photo with Grant Cardone, or, you know, I have my photo with John Maxwell, I can post around and make it look like I'm an exceptional leader because of it and all these other types of things. And I mean, they make pretty pictures. It says nothing about me like except I was at a John Maxwell event. So

Unknown Speaker  11:28
there you go.

Speaker 3  11:33
Is our Well, seems our connection is a little unstable on our side, but we'll, we'll go ahead and get started. First of all, upcoming meetings. I think we've got next week nailed down as well. We confirmed that already. But what about looking into January, the eighth and the 22nd

Speaker 1  12:00
let me check works for me, maybe not for me. There's potential for some dealer days on on that date here in North Carolina, but that's fine on the eighth, seventh and eighth, we're talking about having some dealer days here

Speaker 3  12:24
in North Carolina. Well, we'll put it down and plan for it, I guess, good. So I sent you a list of projects, and I tried to keep it pretty. Just keep it to the ones that we really need to look at. The i The Well, the first one is, should we wait to look at that one till Seth is in,

Matthias Miller  12:51
Oh, see, that's the standardized FGI calculations report.

Speaker 3  12:55
Maybe it's, I think all we need to do is just basically say priority one.

Unknown Speaker  12:59
Yeah. In not cold

Speaker 3  13:04
Dwayne, that was, yeah, also, no, am I confused on that the standardized FDI calculations report, did we determine to know you want to turn that one standard? So

Matthias Miller  13:28
you should, you should be able to here. I'm going to send this

Speaker 3  13:32
to oh no, no, no, no. This is something different. I me, sorry this. This is disregard this Seth is waiting on some information from me on this.

Unknown Speaker  13:49
So, okay, I'll need to do my

Speaker 3  13:58
so I think the biggest one, okay, let's look at the 8011 fixed AR report there's,

Speaker 3  14:10
yeah, you're saying you're seeing What we have now is incorrect. The report is incorrect, and this we're saying this change would fix it.

Unknown Speaker  14:31
Is your common to see, oh

Speaker 5  14:33
yeah, it wasn't zeroing out if a sales order was canceled because we were ignoring payments between invoicing and cancelation, but then if the refund was on the date of cancelation, then we included that so it wouldn't zero out. So we need to include the payments between invoicing and cancelation. If it's canceled, because there might be refunds, then do.

Matthias Miller  15:02
To paraphrase, at the moment of cancelation. All Yeah, to paraphrase, at the moment of cancelation, all payments turn into deposits, and we were ignoring payments during the invoice period, which created a discrepancy, because we're looking at the payments before and after, and it doesn't zero out because, but that's not reality. At cancelation, everything becomes a deposit effectively.

Speaker 3  15:30
And yeah, it does. It pulls it off of accounts receivable and moves into a deposit, correct? Okay, so, but this, how did you like? Is this okay? Because it happens. So rather, there's just a few cases where this is, yeah, so

Speaker 2  15:54
it's like, where they make two payments, you know, they make the deposit before they make another payment after invoicing or something, and then they cancel, which is really, really rare.

Speaker 3  16:07
Okay, and the report that you have here, Seth is, is, if we want it to complete it and verify that maybe we could use that user report, yeah,

Speaker 5  16:17
that user report just shows what the AR report will show after the next update.

Speaker 2  16:22
Okay, perfect. Is there. Did I send an email comment back on that one? Should have posted it here. I suppose I replied an email to some list that I looked up.

Matthias Miller  16:36
I was thinking you did sign off on this by email. Okay, here, I'm gonna, I'll drop it in here.

Unknown Speaker  16:51
Say it 11, yes, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:01
yeah, I would go for

Matthias Miller  17:08
undeposited straight payouts 12.

Speaker 3  17:13
So the next one is the undeposited funds, which I think is if the one right below the app, if we, if we do nothing else but get this one ironed out today, I would consider it a success. So well. DREW Good you. You have,

Speaker 2  17:39
um, if you pull up sales order, a sales order, then I can show you what I'm seeing. The main thing we were talking about there is, is fixed. We just got one more thing coming through. I got a sales number, order number for you. Oh, got it. Sorry, sales order.

Unknown Speaker  18:02
Ah. Sorry. Okay, go for it.

Unknown Speaker  18:11
Ready when you are okay. And 2507992,

Speaker 6  18:22
I, so

Unknown Speaker  18:29
on the payments.

Speaker 2  18:36
The third line on nine, one, the credit card for 634 does not have a strike fee line with it, which is making a difference on the report and accounting. I think everything is doing what it's being told to do. Our problem is just we don't have a stripe fee line for this, for this payment, because it's, it's putting the 634 into undeposited font, but it's never pulling the fee out, and then two days later, with the payout, it's only like 615 right?

Matthias Miller  19:16
Dwayne, do we have a way?

Speaker 2  19:17
So I think the question is, how do we find all of these. Can we make a good way to find these so we can just enter the stripe fee? Or is there a, is there a stripe linking issue that we should take care of here?

Matthias Miller  19:33
Well, I'm very curious why it never should have been the first place.

Speaker 2  19:41
It may have masked by some other things, I think, because the difference that I'm showing in the reports and accounting is actually doesn't match this amount, I think it's a it's an aggregate amount of several of these happening on the same day. I.

Matthias Miller  20:04
Let's do,

Matthias Miller  20:10
where is this guy here?

Unknown Speaker  20:16
So we got added here without a fee, no

Speaker 2  20:27
but go go up to the third to ones on the 13th and the 14th. Doesn't it get edited somewhere?

Matthias Miller  20:44
Detroit stripe transaction ID got filled in on that row. That's interesting

Unknown Speaker  20:55
was that Josh's work to link stuff probably i Okay.

Matthias Miller  21:10
Well, so what are the what are the potential ways that we could solve this? Number one, we could, we could take a look at, I mean, the simplest thing would be to have a stripe payout reconciliation, where you look at the payout and the recorded payments, and make sure that that that those Things, oh, make make sure that those tie out. I would also think that we should chase this with Josh and find out why the fee was never added.

Speaker 3  21:54
Matthias, you were broke up. All right, our service is pretty bad. We just got pieces of what you just said.

Matthias Miller  22:00
Okay, I would. So number one, we should check with Josh on why was the fee. Never added that okay? And second of all, we should have, I think that what makes most sense to me is doing something along the lines of, I don't know what this actually ends up looking like, but doing a, Let's see. Let's try this Once, it

Matthias Miller  22:47
would Be stripe. I

Matthias Miller  23:15
i i Really payment stripe ID,

Unknown Speaker  23:32
what is the area?

Unknown Speaker  23:37
It would be here?

Matthias Miller  23:43
I can find it where this guy is.

Unknown Speaker  23:53
We can't we can

Matthias Miller  24:04
No, it'd be undeposited funds,

Unknown Speaker  24:17
right? Payout. We

Matthias Miller  24:20
don't have an index on it, okay, well, then let's do this. If we see I

Matthias Miller  24:43
so we would do a sales order, and we would do a sum of amounts, and by this, and.

Matthias Miller  25:05
Wow, that's really not liking me.

Matthias Miller  25:13
Where The slower?

Unknown Speaker  25:20
Yeah, no, no, T

Unknown Speaker  25:37
and then,

Matthias Miller  25:44
a two decimals nine wide, because why not? And right aligned with commas.

Matthias Miller  26:03
Uh, like, here's here's one. These are all off by,

Matthias Miller  26:15
are you seeing a lot of these or just a few?

Speaker 2  26:19
Um, there's, like, there's a lot of days that have that have issues in them. Now, did you, are you including the combination of the fee and the payment?

Matthias Miller  26:33
Yeah? Like, here's one, yes. I mean the

Unknown Speaker  26:36
fee and the payment together. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  26:43
Yeah, okay, this is, like, here's one. This doesn't have a fee on it. So that's that is a genuine problem, I mean, and I think this is close to right, if you want to, then here, let's do this, the essence value assign font Format

Unknown Speaker  27:12
equals, if so value be does

Matthias Miller  27:18
not equal the

Matthias Miller  27:32
call sure We and we could do a difference.

Unknown Speaker  27:40
Let's do this.

Matthias Miller  27:56
Let's end then we can do zero to NA, Some locus of value to

Unknown Speaker  28:13
write

Matthias Miller  28:19
difference, payout, amount, Stripe, sorry, sales, order, amount, difference, nine and two. Use commas right line. We don't actually need to read anymore in this case, not only 1118, look at that.

Matthias Miller  28:49
I mean, just a few issues here and there, if you want to look at any of them,

Speaker 2  28:57
393, I guess not quite um. Pop open a few just to verify. But the 2400 that looks

Matthias Miller  29:11
that looks pretty interesting. Let's see what's going on with that. Okay, so here we have, well, this guy's not record. I mean, wait a minute, we have a payout.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
What's this mean?

Matthias Miller  29:30
We have a payout of 2554, but it's not there's no line items accounted for. Dwayne, are you easily able to pull

Unknown Speaker  29:40
up this payout. What's on?

Matthias Miller  29:47
Matthias sales order just has a

Unknown Speaker  29:52
say that again. Matthias, you said, Can I

Matthias Miller  29:55
would you? Would you be able to are you? What do you need on this thing to be able to pull up? The payout. I don't know why. I can yell. I can jump up and down.

Matthias Miller  30:12
So the there's nothing with the balance due that's close to that amount. We could look at a modification history on

Matthias Miller  30:28
make sure nobody did anything goofy. No, that's not those payment Well,

Speaker 3  30:38
I'm suspicious. Is this sales order canceled. I was working on one yesterday. That was the one that

Matthias Miller  30:49
no but it's possible that there was another. I mean, it's possible that it was a charge that was never tied out. What seems likely is it? Somebody ran a charge manually in stripe, but never put it against the sales order.

Unknown Speaker  31:14
Okay, are you?

Matthias Miller  31:18
Dwayne, I was wondering, can you what's Do you need a transaction ID to look up the payout.

Speaker 1  31:24
Or I would love to know I can. I can do it by transaction number. I can also do it if you don't have the PO Well, you're the PO number there. So the stripe po would be the preferred method. Sorry, next, one stripe, right. Next, oh, the PO number, right? Sorry, that would be confusing if I call it the PO number. I mean

Matthias Miller  31:44
it makes sense, right? Ready? I get it fine. Here, let's do this. I would suggest. I

Matthias Miller  32:02
would propose we make this a standard report. And by the way, this is only in India.

Speaker 2  32:08
Definitely was 2554 75 that's what the bank statement says. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:21
and it's not inland.

Unknown Speaker  32:28
Sorry. Matthias, what company was this for?

Matthias Miller  32:31
This was for Indiana. So

Matthias Miller  32:41
that would explain the missing one. This one just doesn't have anything at all. These all look like fees. Based on the amounts these look like fees. This guy, this guy's Interesting, yeah, 1612, there's a RE, oh, I'll bet you there's a

Speaker 1  33:06
Okay, the particular, the particular payout number, is going to be fun for you, because we, we don't currently track disputes, etc, but this one has a chargeback reversal for 2401 80 inside of it, that's going to cause you all kinds of fun headaches.

Speaker 1  33:31
Charge back with Indiana had a situation with a particular customer where they went and accidentally ran a whole bunch of payments. Then there was confusion with the customer, and then the customer and then the customer did a chargeback, and it was a bit of a mess. And this particular payout that you sent to me here, I'll just drop you a I'll drop you a screenshot so that you can see

Matthias Miller  33:55
wouldn't the reversal have a unique transaction ID tied to it.

Unknown Speaker  34:04
Good question, not sure.

Matthias Miller  34:06
And if so, shouldn't we theoretically just apply that to the sales order, and all is well. Well, here I'm going to

Speaker 1  34:11
drop, I'm going to drop you what I'm looking at so you can see. Or actually, why don't you want me to share the screen?

Matthias Miller  34:18
Yeah, yeah. You should stream screen. Go for it.

Speaker 1  34:23
Let's see, here we go. All right, so you can see this, yep, so this is the particular payout that you sent to me, and you have this giant, oh, okay, so we can link across to it. So here is the, this is the dispute, etc, etc. Do we have? We have a, okay, there is a different ID when it comes to disputes,

Matthias Miller  34:56
but that's likely the dispute itself. Mm. Not necessarily the reversal transaction. Is there a

Matthias Miller  35:11
last charge?

Speaker 1  35:13
There's your there's all your connection for payout.

Matthias Miller  35:19
Does this have a transaction ID or not?

Speaker 1  35:22
Oh, this is going to be fun. Which way was which way? Was it reverse or because, okay, so this is interesting. So we actually won this dispute. Finally, they tell they tell us, we actually won this thing. So I have no idea which, which one's, ins and outs, because I know there was, there

Matthias Miller  35:37
was a dispute reversal. So they, they, they went on the consumer side, and said, Nah, they shouldn't have charged you. That took the money away from us, and then they reversed it. And said, yeah, actually, that was legit, and the reversal is deposited back into our account.

Speaker 1  35:51
So is So which way is this one going? So that's in or out then. So this would be, this could be in, in from the customer. So this would be 2401 80 higher than what was expected?

Matthias Miller  36:02
Yeah, we received the money, but it's not recorded on the sales order.

Speaker 1  36:08
And good question tied out. Yeah, that's well, if the question, I don't know that we ever tied out the original reversal, and then we probably never tied out the recording back. So I don't even know where to start on this one, to be honest.

Matthias Miller  36:26
Well, I mean, I think the option, basically is okay, so technically, though, what we would expect to see is like a I don't know where this would have happened, but somewhere we should see about a $1,600 discrepancy. The other way, maybe it's this guy.

Matthias Miller  37:00
It's probably this guy tend to where we were shorted a bunch of money.

Speaker 1  37:06
You want to, you want me stop sharing so that you can share with go to

Matthias Miller  37:10
the can you? Can you pull up the dispute and view other I don't know how much is okay. So we

Unknown Speaker  37:16
big picture. You want to go back to the dispute. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  37:20
Can you, can we go to the What date did they pull the money back out? You saved evidence that's we need to go further back in history.

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Did it just show this pop up? Yeah, all right, so let's

Matthias Miller  37:45
go, yeah, funds withdrawn. USD, 2416 80 funds withdrawn for dispute,

Unknown Speaker  37:51
October the second.

Unknown Speaker  37:53
Yeah, we're right here.

Matthias Miller  37:58
2416 that's exactly, that's exactly that's exactly it. It's right here. I think the big question is, how do we? Man, it would be nice if we could just have Josh handle if there's, well,

Speaker 1  38:21
here's the question, though, is I expect, out of the numbers of years that we've been credit card transactions is the first one I think we've done from a dispute standpoint. So is it worth handling to doing a bunch of development to actually handle it, or do we just, when we come across something like this, have to figure out a way to chase it down? Can we,

Matthias Miller  38:43
if we have a unique stripe ID, can we manually add rose? Well, I don't know that we want to do that either. Yeah. I mean, I think, I think that's the short and, I mean, the short answer is that we need to go chase chase down. Chase it down manually.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
I don't know, Mark, what's what's your thought on? On something like this?

Speaker 3  39:08
Sorry, our I didn't hear most of what Matthias said.

Speaker 1  39:15
Okay, so proposal, the short, the short synopsis of this whole entire thing is we've had a number of payouts that don't make sense because of this dispute. And this is the first dispute I think we've ever done in in all the years we've been doing credit card transactions. So is it worth really trying to do development, to try to to make sure all the ins and outs are captured correctly and on the sales order, et cetera, et cetera. Or do we just go through an awkward phone call like this to sort it all out in the you know, whenever it happens in the future?

Speaker 3  39:53
Well, I don't think it's worth probably not, but we do have to have a way to i. I guess, see when this happens. So I'm not sure how we like, how would we fix this now? Like, now that we know what's happened, can we just like, how do we even fix it?

Speaker 1  40:13
So well, I guess the first question I have Matthias is, do we have good reporting to find stuff like this on on the assist side? Obviously, you went and wrote some stuff to find it. If we had good reporting to go come up with the good po numbers. You can research this on the on their portal within a matter of, you know, seconds, as long as you have good IDs.

Matthias Miller  40:35
Well, I mean, you just, you will have the difference column. And I think the biggest thing that we need is a notes memo on the payout so that you can say, Okay, this is a this is a dispute. Here's a link to the transaction, where we put in the the journal entry to fix it and get everything squared away. And here's the originating payout. And you know, so you can create a documentation trail, these two rows will show a discrepancy in perpetuity.

Speaker 1  41:10
I'm handing it back over to you so you can, because you're obviously that we can't see

Matthias Miller  41:16
I am pointing. Okay, so my proposal would be if we just add a notes memo on here, where you can add some documentation whenever that shows up on the stripe, payout, add notes that you can document, and then, and then just, you'll just have to create journal entries to get everything handled. I know that's a little hand wavy, but

Speaker 3  41:50
so how do we Okay? And you're saying, how would we be alerted to we this report? Anything that shows up on this report says, Hey, I need to be researched and most likely have journal mentors created to match what this report is showing.

Matthias Miller  42:11
Yes, well, and so, I mean, there's a lot of these that are

Unknown Speaker  42:20
land builder box.

Speaker 2  42:25
So for this one, we eventually got that payment. We can't just put the payment in as of the day that the payout happened and say that's when we got the payment. Or should we be doing more than that?

Matthias Miller  42:42
Yeah, you could it just wouldn't be linked to a stripe transaction ID, and it would still show up here forever. But yeah, you could just put the put the day that it was taken out of your account, put, put a payment, a reversal in for that, and then put it in, yeah, I it.

Speaker 3  43:04
But you're saying that won't make that won't they won't drop off the report. Then if we do that,

Matthias Miller  43:11
no, we need some kind of way to tie it out. I mean, we have to have Josh, basically. Josh, is not recording dispute entries on here, and so we have to have him go ahead.

Speaker 3  43:36
I was just we're trying to figure out if there's anything we could do to improve our internet connection.

Matthias Miller  43:43
Here you could, if you have a Drew, could call in on his cell phone and put it on speaker and stay, if you can stay on here, but just join by the audio settings as well.

Unknown Speaker  44:01
Do this. Come back on. Makes

Speaker 2  44:05
it a little better.

Matthias Miller  44:10
We can also, okay, well, there you go. We could also next, or all our videos happening with your wavy blue screen comment, decided it needed to do some AI stuff, and I'm not sure what it was trying to do. It's still trying to do something. Stop, stop, stop. I want to take control. What in the heck are you doing? It's very pretty. It is very pretty. Oh, that's kind of scary.

Speaker 1  44:41
That comment, I think is going to happen more in the future, as AI is integrated into our browsers and everywhere else in life, they'll be like, That's awfully scary.

Unknown Speaker  44:50
Not supposed to be

Matthias Miller  44:53
doing that. I don't know what it got in its head that it was supposed to be doing. I.

Unknown Speaker  45:05
Them, yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:18
any any better, no, we, we, we can also all turn off her or videos, and it would help the that way you can Help the screen sharing.

Speaker 3  45:34
It seems better. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:40
okay. Okay, so there are, there are basically three scenarios that I'm seeing missing fees, transactions never put on a sales order and then disputes. So Mark, we could ask Josh to research why disputes, you know, support disputes in payouts, the and make sure that we can add them to sales orders. The question is, simply, we've only had one in the last X number of years. You know, why bother?

Speaker 3  46:27
Well, that's I don't I feel like it's not worth it on the disputes, if we can just manually handle those, as long as we have a way to spot for those situations. But what do we do with well, keep going with the other, the other two pieces, I guess, that you're or your suggestion on,

Matthias Miller  46:53
well, my only, my only suggestion, really, was to just leave them on the report and just document what happened. And unless, unless, for some reason you need to need it off, in which case, let's create a I mean, we can. We can create a. You. Yeah, we can create an override amount, or something like, or something like that.

Speaker 3  47:31
Like, is there a way that we could? I'm thinking similar to what we call it, but the accounting impact, like, if we not the accounting impact the mismatch report, where we can do reconciles, we can reconcile differences that have happened in a closed period. What do we call that report true, where you can go in and make changes, and it takes a mismatch report where that sounds good, it sounds good. It ties it back somehow, doesn't it? And it also it's linked. Well, I don't know if you can do something

Matthias Miller  48:10
like here, here's my proposal. Add a field called the unlinked Sales Order amount, and just throw it in the total. And so in this case you would add a, a, no. In this case you would, you would add, you would put in 2401 80. And here you would put in minus 2416 80. And you would just explain what happened on your

Unknown Speaker  48:46
positive funds report. You just add that,

Matthias Miller  48:50
well you would okay. First of all, what you would do, first of all you would do is you would create a payment on the sales order? No, you still need a way to have it manually deposited. You would, you would create a payment on the for disputes in particular, create a payment and deposit the payment on the same day as the payout, and then give a way to do it right off. That's one option. That's probably the cleanest option. I mean that. And then, and then we give you a way to adjust this number here, plus or minus, so that you can tie it out.

Speaker 2  49:39
Well, like on that dispute the 2401 if we just make another payment line on the so deposit as a regular payment, you know, like as if it were a check, then if we would just have a, I mean, even a memo link possibility to say, Okay, this check was actually. Are part of this payout. You know, these two go together to match what hit the

Unknown Speaker  50:04
bank or something like that, right?

Matthias Miller  50:10
The The big question is, exactly, and every everything you can do all of that right now, the biggest question is, do you want to be able to make an adjustment here so that these don't show a difference. Oh,

Speaker 3  50:27
well, how would you do that? Or can you could we do one one sales order? Just actually do one sales order now and walk through the steps on Sure.

Matthias Miller  50:44
So in this case, let's go back here, because we know, I know this, this one's direct. So what we would do is we would create a well, this would make the most sense to do it on the original sales order. Dwayne, do you have the you have the sales order number?

Speaker 1  51:13
Is this for that to charge back? Yeah, give me a minute. The customer's name is Valkenburg. Let me go look up this customer.

Matthias Miller  51:36
Okay, how do you spell

Speaker 1  51:38
the coming to you? Coming to you racing.

Matthias Miller  51:42
You unfailing. How about that? Look at that. Okay, so what we would do here, then is on the payment. We have a we would add a row for 10, two. Of this for how do you want to record it? To record it as a as as you can't deposit credit cards, can you? So you'd have to have a check or cash.

Speaker 2  52:17
I just just do check and just make a note.

Matthias Miller  52:28
So we do something like that, and then we would

Matthias Miller  52:39
deposits. And create a deposit for shed time. Sorry, hang on deposits. Create a new deposit for 10 two and we would do

Matthias Miller  53:04
uh, then sales, order payments, go find this guy. We need to

Matthias Miller  53:15
speed this up for you guys. This guy include

Matthias Miller  53:26
as well. Sorry, which, okay, so that's that. That's that. So now, so then we don't have a way to record this, but now, technically,

Matthias Miller  53:50
here we could do we don't even Have a memo on here. That's great. This would be,

Matthias Miller  54:10
wasn't that one? It was this guy, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:13
24, 1680,

Speaker 2  54:24
wonder if it wouldn't have been a chargeback that was reducing the different payout like so it's already, it's already included in a payout.

Matthias Miller  54:39
It Yes, it was. And so what we can't do though bank that way, right? It was that this is, this is the discrepancy we thought we were supposed to get, 7292 and we actually got 4875 i.

Speaker 3  55:11
Oh, so we don't even so we don't really want to do a deposit, because it deposit would mean it needs to reconcile with the bank account. Um, right? Is that what you're

Speaker 2  55:25
Yeah, I'm good point guessing. I'm pretty sure that I just wrote a journal entry to work this one

Speaker 3  55:33
out. Made it 4800 or so, the one that

Unknown Speaker  55:37
didn't. What was it? 2416

Matthias Miller  55:41
80. So do you want me to Well, if you've already reconciled that one, then we should. We should unlink this one and delete the deposit. Right? Oh, oh,

Speaker 2  56:03
yeah, I created a vendor invoice, vendor stripe.

Matthias Miller  56:10
Okay, well, good. Well, we can link it out to, I guess. I mean, we can at least cross reference that then, okay, so this is then we're just gonna nuke this guy.

Matthias Miller  56:27
So here's the

Unknown Speaker  56:39
is, VI, 4518, five, where your bracket link,

Speaker 6  56:47
yeah, yeah. Get

Matthias Miller  57:00
it eventually perfect. So then, basically all that needs to happen then is we need to document this so that we know what happened. And then, so then my unlinked

Unknown Speaker  57:34
a barns Bishop, what we're looking for. These are my lost, my report, sales, order, amount,

Matthias Miller  57:56
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  58:05
Yes, makes sense. So then, so

Speaker 3  58:11
I'm lost, but if it makes sense to you, then like this, like, how are we going to clean up the these? Is it? You just have to go through them one by one, yeah?

Speaker 2  58:24
Well, I mean, for most of those, we have to just go in and put in a stripe fee, right?

Matthias Miller  58:29
Yeah, but, but please, let's talk to Josh. Because there's so many, there's some kind of systemic problem here that stripe fees are being recorded,

Speaker 3  58:39
sure, but do you think Josh will be able to fix historical things? I was thinking, Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  58:47
don't know why he wouldn't, but maybe not.

Speaker 3  58:59
So. So if he does that, what you're thinking is like, the one you're that $10.28 cent, he would, he would add a line to that sales order with the stripe fee. I mean, is that basically what he would be doing? Yeah, okay. And the downside of doing it manually is doing historical ones manually

Matthias Miller  59:31
is that it's, it's not going to leak out to your it's not going to link out to your payout. So you're so you're going to have

Speaker 2  59:40
to this is always going to show that there's a difference. Then you open it up. Oh, no, this actually was manually fixed.

Matthias Miller  59:47
Or, or you have to put in the manual over here.

Speaker 2  59:51
Like, could you just add a column for memo? Or wherever we're we put our notes so that we can just see on the report that it's that it has a manual fix.

Matthias Miller  59:59
But you. Why would we, I mean, that's, that's what the manual adjustment is for. Like, if you would add a manual adjustment, then it could show a zero difference, but, but there's other reasons. Like, I mean, I don't know, just deposit date and all this. Like, it's, it just seems to me like, when it comes to the recording, the missing fees, that a historical cleanup would be super useful.

Matthias Miller  1:00:33
But, I mean, but if you guys want to just again, if you guys want to do it manually, you can do that on Monday, and weekend after, after you have that manual adjustment,

Speaker 2  1:00:44
I'd be happy, happy with Josh throwing in a bunch of those lines.

Matthias Miller  1:00:48
I would just check with him and see what it takes.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
Okay, are you going to check with him? Matthias, I can. Yeah. I yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:10
good, okay, so that's that's that part of it does

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
that give you guys what you need on this one?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:24
I think so.

Speaker 3  1:01:29
So will this allow us? Could we use, by using this through, could we see if everything else is tying up like, could we use? Probably we could use the differences.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
Okay, the payout amount is what the payout amount is coming from

Speaker 3  1:01:48
the accounting site or the deposit that's being made, right? And the sales order amount is the amount showing on the sales

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
order normally.

Speaker 2  1:01:58
So like for the top one has got highlighted there 2030 on that's the only one on the 15th. So on the 15th, we should be seeing that difference

Speaker 3  1:02:09
for sure time and which should be higher. Would we expect the accounting to be 2930 lower than our undeposited funds report? Yeah, because undeposited funds thinks there's $1,000 that's not been deposited, or in reality, it's just 970

Speaker 2  1:02:34
because the sales are pushing 1000 undeposited funds and payouts on them pulling nine seven out i

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Yeah, so if Josh fixes this, that would take care of all the stripe fees, right? That's the then.

Speaker 3  1:02:57
What else do we have there? Oh, the ones that were not strike payments not linked to any specific sales order.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
Yeah, because of like that,

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
we could be right. It could be like, this is a dispute charge. I mean, this is a some kind of dispute charge or something, or dispute charge reversal,

Speaker 2  1:03:22
I'm sure it goes on right there, just to 20 401 Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:03:28
So, I mean, but then there's stuff, like, where, what are other ones that are negative? I mean, like, here's one. There's what happened with this man. I don't know. Something happened. We got more money and we thought we should. So is there missing transaction? I don't know. Seems likely that they're good. How do we

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
so what's the solution for these?

Matthias Miller  1:03:59
Well, Dwayne's gonna go find out what this guy is, out of the goodness of his heart, also, for shed time, is

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
that your way of making sure I'm still paying attention?

Matthias Miller  1:04:14
Yeah, it is. It's my way of checking up on you.

Speaker 1  1:04:18
Well, thankfully, my, my camera's off. You can't see that. I It was completely not paying attention. All right. What do you want? What do you want from this?

Matthias Miller  1:04:28
What's Is there, like, $100 charge or something on this one or payment that we received?

Speaker 1  1:04:35
If you let me share, I can show you what the PO number you sent to me. Yep. Go for it. Don't think so this is

Matthias Miller  1:04:48
290 so sorry. We have two 291-391-1161 282 one. Maybe, Okay, hang on. We have, okay, let me pull up these sales orders. So the 875, Stripe feed two, hang on. One of these guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
What the world

Matthias Miller  1:05:25
somebody moved? Jeez, oh, somebody moved the payment, but not the fee. I think I

Matthias Miller  1:05:43
What is the difference? Difference is 5742 which has nothing to do with okay, there's 391,

Matthias Miller  1:06:02
you'll see if this payment is over here. Where is this guy?

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
Is this guy

Speaker 1  1:06:19
has a you still need to share this? Or do you want me to stop sharing? Yeah, no,

Matthias Miller  1:06:24
hang on to this one. Okay, so the Steve Franks looks to be good, but there's something goofy with the Starks one here. Let me just grab I'm going to do this. Grab a screenshot. Okay, you're good.

Matthias Miller  1:06:47
Okay, so, so there's a discrepancy on the on the Starks, okay. The interesting thing is, on this sales order here,

Matthias Miller  1:07:01
there's a stripe fee, but the payment itself isn't on this one. So the question is, where is this? Where's The where's the other payment? Uh,

Matthias Miller  1:07:37
and wait let's do this.

Matthias Miller  1:08:00
Okay, I don't know how you're supposed to figure this one out, but this amount is wrong. It's linked.

Matthias Miller  1:08:18
It's the wrong date and the wrong amount. Also did partial refund. Here's what it is, did a partial refund on stripe.

Matthias Miller  1:08:44
I am so that's where the $100 is, or the Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:08:55
this is a nightmare. Wow. Why? Because they changed the date. He changed the date and the amount on this. This guy almost guaranteed.

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
Wiz. Yes, he added a row. Add a row.

Matthias Miller  1:09:35
Exactly? Did he do here? I

Matthias Miller  1:09:43
Now it came in with this date. It came in with the 291 and then here he said,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:55
forget that.

Matthias Miller  1:10:02
Let's go delete that guy. We don't want that guy. So this was it. This was the manually entered one.

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
So he had a manual. I

Matthias Miller  1:10:26
He manually added the charge the system did. It was recorded as cash on 11 four. Then we linked

Speaker 1  1:10:45
see just this is the point Matthias, where you need to have aI on the platform that tells us why this took place.

Matthias Miller  1:10:56
Do you mean a clinical psychologist or what it's I mean, this also looks goofy to me. Why? Why do we have a fee? Why is the transaction dated on?

Speaker 1  1:11:12
Send me the send me the transaction number

Speaker 3  1:11:18
booms for everything. Strategy be too legal as to just handle those differences? Never put them in as positive funds, and they just go straight into,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
well, all right, let me. Let me share for a minute. Yeah, this may help answer some of the questions. So here's that transaction ID, and you can see what was taking here you can see what took place. So we

Matthias Miller  1:11:59
do, we have dates for these events, or this is the

Unknown Speaker  1:12:06
sure we have dates.

Speaker 2  1:12:11
So should, should he have recorded the full payment and then a refund?

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
A refund amount? Yeah, but the admin page did something really goofy with this guy.

Speaker 1  1:12:23
No, the admin page didn't do something goofy. It brought in the 292 9137

Matthias Miller  1:12:28
but it recorded the 875, Stripe fee that should have been recorded on 1028, not on 11 four.

Speaker 1  1:12:34
And you sure you didn't override the do you want? You want to take a screenshot of this, and then I'll drop back over so we can see what you're

Matthias Miller  1:12:40
looking at. Yeah. I Okay, got it. So here's, here's, here's the part I'm confused about. This was linked from the admin page. Here's the stripe fee. The date for the payment was 1028, the date for the fee was 11, four. This. This is the fee.

Speaker 1  1:13:03
Yeah, but the fee, the fee comes from, I'm presuming it's part of the refund, isn't

Matthias Miller  1:13:10
it? The fee, 874 No,

Speaker 1  1:13:13
870 why? Processing Fee? Well, sorry, you can't see what you pay the fee.

Matthias Miller  1:13:17
More you pay the fee initially, when you, when you first run the card, you pay the fee, the refund just doesn't give you the feedback.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:27
You may be correct. I'm not sure. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:13:33
I think I am. Any other time you run a charge, we the fee gets taken out right away. So unless it has, it's, it's, it's right future mode that it knows it's going to incur a refund. That was sarcastic. I'm pretty confident.

Matthias Miller  1:14:04
I think it's an issue when we link Absolutely, when we link a transaction after it was subsequently refunded, and the refund never made it onto here. No, hang on. I'm yeah, when the refund never

Speaker 2  1:14:27
made it under here, fee should be dated 1028 the 1028 amount should be the full amount, and 11 four should

Matthias Miller  1:14:39
be the payout for This guy is 1029, yes, the data is wrong. So well, let's go. Let's go fix that once that is correct. But the but the refund made it through on this? Okay, here's the part I'm confused. No, it's right, and this should be the original, okay. Do it? Hang on. We'll get here. He should not have changed the amount. He should have added the refund row. Let's go back to what he did,

Matthias Miller  1:15:17
just to triple check, yep, this is the amount It should have

Speaker 6  1:15:41
been great. Okay

Matthias Miller  1:16:01
now good news is this thing when we go back here, where were we?

Matthias Miller  1:16:12
1350, what do we have? To 662, 94, this guy, if we refresh it, ties out now somewhere on 11 four, we have a 5742 discrepancy, because, drum roll please, because that's where the refund is. That's where the refund was never Well, here is the refund, right?

Speaker 2  1:16:44
It's part of the payout, but it, you know, it's, it was never recorded properly,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:52
right? Is

Speaker 2  1:16:53
that the right? So Id? Yeah, absolutely. Wait.

Matthias Miller  1:16:58
Do we? Do? We have a way to add this as a row, link to the transaction ID or not.

Speaker 1  1:17:11
Every time I've tried to link any kind of refund stuff, it, it, it doesn't like it. I think the

Matthias Miller  1:17:19
reason is because refunds use the same transaction ID as the original charge, and it gets confused, and it's not differentiating. And we need a way, and you can have multiple refunds, and so we need a way to differentiate which instance of the refund we're talking about.

Speaker 1  1:17:31
Yeah. Plus, I actually, like, there is actually a refund ID, but I think even when we try to use the refund ID, it still doesn't like I think Josh needs to do some work to actually track these correctly,

Matthias Miller  1:17:52
well. And so the option then becomes to add a this thing and and just do a manual payout override to make it outright. On that one, I won't save it, but yeah, except for make it 11 four, right? It should be 11 four, right? I mean,

Speaker 1  1:18:20
see, even, even when I got, even when I go search the actual refund ID, it still takes me back to the original transaction, right? And so it's, it maybe on the API we can get some better well, no navigation on that, but it's, it feels to me like a stripe.

Matthias Miller  1:18:42
Maybe, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:18:56
Is this enough that you guys are comfortable chasing it, or do we are? I mean, I mean, I think it's going to just be a lot of back and forth between your Stripe account and this, you just find this. Look at the payout ID, look at these guys, see if you can figure out what's going on. And if you run into any brick walls, dead ends, whatever we can, we can take a look.

Speaker 2  1:19:23
Well, except for that, I don't have access to the stripe thing that's a been a Dwayne specialty.

Matthias Miller  1:19:31
Well, then either get Dwayne, then Dwayne, you get to have some fun time with Drew, or you get to figure out how to share access. I is

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
i much? I much prefer the latter.

Speaker 2  1:19:47
I prefer just, we're just continue.

Speaker 1  1:19:50
Yeah, you prefer, you prefer the first, and I prefer, I believe in empowerment. But couldn't we still?

Speaker 2  1:19:59
I mean. And if we still check with Josh on just the regular missing fee issues, that would, that would be a better first step, because that could clean up most of these, and then we can easily see what we're working with. We're not like, Oh, this is just a normal fee issue.

Speaker 3  1:20:20
Okay, so it sounds like we have, I mean, do you have the next steps outlined here on the incident, or Matthias like you?

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
Well, so, I mean, I think here's the report. We're going to add a memo to the payout. On the memo, wow, I should probably type the right thing on the payout. We'll add a manual payout adjustment for a manual so adjustment maybe, and then include this so that you can adjust this total in the difference so it comes out, so you can reconcile. And then there's three common scenarios, missing fees, and then this is the

Matthias Miller  1:21:15
other big issue, is refunds that never got or got recorded wrong. Dispute clean up. I mean, yeah, I think so,

Speaker 3  1:21:30
what are we? So the transactions never put on a sales order. How do we? How are we going to fix that?

Matthias Miller  1:21:35
You're going to have to look, look at the Stripe account, figure out what transaction it was, figure out what, what user it was, and then go to the sales order and record a stripe payment for that. For that guy, it

Speaker 2  1:21:49
will, pretty much, it will show up on that payout thing.

Matthias Miller  1:21:53
Yeah, it'll show up in the payout thing. And then, and then you just need to figure it, well, actually it would be in here. It should be in here, and you just take the transaction ID, find the rate, you know where it goes.

Speaker 2  1:22:06
Yeah, really, the same fix as the refund issue, because that's essentially the same thing as

Matthias Miller  1:22:12
well, well, except this is this one's easy. I mean, this one's easier because you just need to figure out the right sales order, and then you can manually link it on the sales order. You don't have to do like or you can use the this guy record stripe payment. It should just work.

Speaker 3  1:22:29
Yeah, you do record strike payment, and then you, where do you put the transaction ID?

Matthias Miller  1:22:35
It'll pop open this guy, oh, paste it in there and hit link payment.

Speaker 3  1:22:42
Okay, now could we? So I'm curious if we, if we now go to the, if we take this report and we go to the that trial balance audit sheet, if we, let's say we do a we look at undeposited funds for 1031 and 1130 and see if our, if we add or subtract this, these

Speaker 3  1:23:13
payout discrepancies at that point, if we we would expect those amounts to otherwise be same, right?

Speaker 2  1:23:23
No, well, no, we would expect the change

Unknown Speaker  1:23:26
to be the same, right? Yeah, so to be

Unknown Speaker  1:23:29
the same. So, because we're not so starting at a zero, true.

Speaker 3  1:23:33
But look, if we look at 1030 to 1031 balance, and then

Speaker 2  1:23:41
pull up 1030 and 10 and 1031 find, what's the change between the two?

Matthias Miller  1:23:45
Oh, there you go. What's the what am I looking for?

Speaker 2  1:23:49
It's a standard report, travel balance audit, balance sheet audit, something to that extent,

Matthias Miller  1:23:58
account balance audit. Okay, so we have run shit time. This would be undeposited,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:06
yeah. I mean, let's just do 1031 and 1130

Speaker 2  1:24:11
or Yeah, but you'll need the day before so that we know the change of that. So, oh, you want to do, just do 1129 29 No. I mean two days, 1130, 1129, and

Matthias Miller  1:24:29
then we need more. Because, why not? I think it

Speaker 2  1:24:32
would be better off if we go to October, because if anybody was doing entries today for some reason like that, it tends to be an issue. Yeah. So just pull that. Just keep going, because you got to fill all the dates

Unknown Speaker  1:24:47
in, yep. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:24:50
so then coming down here, it's going to be the we expect to see these guys, total of debits and credits do not balance. That's not good.

Speaker 2  1:24:59
I. Oh, we got the divot. Now we'll have to find the difference. So the 1030 the difference between the 210 31 numbers and the difference between the 210 30 numbers. And then the theory is that the difference between those two differences is the amount on that other report.

Matthias Miller  1:25:27
Okay, so if we go this guy minus this guy,

Speaker 2  1:25:38
well, you could theoretically go that way, but you mean that?

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
Yeah. Okay, so this guy here, let's do let's pull

Matthias Miller  1:25:56
up, Excel,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:01
you're right. Running about 10,000

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
oh yeah, this one's off the page.

Matthias Miller  1:26:10
Okay, so this guy, and we have this guy, and then we have this guy, and this guy, and then we have this, minus this, that minus that,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
that would you expect? What's

Unknown Speaker  1:26:35
the next one in

Speaker 3  1:26:37
1029, I think there was a charge or a gift.

Matthias Miller  1:26:43
So see, let's see, this is this one, and this is,

Speaker 2  1:26:47
yeah, this one. We'll have Matthias trained on how to do this, and shortly, you know, what's your difference there?

Matthias Miller  1:26:55
177, 40,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:01
look at that. It's not the same.

Matthias Miller  1:27:09
Well, that was fun.

Speaker 3  1:27:18
Okay, we are, for sure, looking at the total on the sub things down below or not. I was looking at one of the other ones, and there was, I had to scroll to the Oh,

Speaker 2  1:27:28
widen the column one. Yeah, that was AR. AR. I had a whole report, a whole email written up about how it's pulling the wrong number. Discovered the column was too narrow.

Speaker 3  1:27:49
I looked at it and said, Something's way out. We're not even close. And figure out what was the problem. Still of them. So that's kind of okay. Now we're saying,

Matthias Miller  1:28:17
I mean, the real way to do this then is to compare this and this guy and see what changed between the actual reports themselves,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:32
all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:33
and then how that changed from the ledger, right?

Matthias Miller  1:28:42
Well, there's a fair bit of you got 282-273-3009,

Matthias Miller  1:28:52
I mean, I don't know. Do we want to fall down this rabbit hole

Matthias Miller  1:29:00
to 118, you know,

Speaker 3  1:29:03
I'm wondering if, how does your here's what I would like to suggest, or what I would suggest is, if you have time this afternoon Drew and I can spend some time looking at these differences, and then could we regroup this afternoon to discuss? Because obviously there's something more than just like if this our difference here had been, had matched what was on the other report, where you say, Okay, it's all coming from those strike issues, but now we're saying, well, there's something else going On. So wait,

Speaker 2  1:29:38
pull that. Pull your payout report again, what? What is your date? Or no, you got two dates. What are they?

Matthias Miller  1:29:52
The 1030 and 1028

Speaker 2  1:29:59
right, but I'm. Mean, are they so payment dates? Are they

Matthias Miller  1:30:04
payout date?

Speaker 2  1:30:06
Payout date? So what's the arrival date on the right? Then,

Matthias Miller  1:30:15
same, same thing. We just can't We can't stand only having it there. Well, no, it's, it's, it's the same day. In this case,

Speaker 2  1:30:28
I'm just thinking maybe there's other ones that that are affecting this day.

Matthias Miller  1:30:34
That's a great question. Maybe they arrived on the same day. But no, but no, sadly.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:48
Oh, what's 2341 minus 2930 do the math on wasn't

Unknown Speaker  1:30:53
that 60? Wasn't that 66 662, the one we just got done fixing. Where? That one in the middle wasn't

Matthias Miller  1:31:07
that the one we just had, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:31:09
with the $57 so that would not have pushed to accounting, so it would not have affected the accounting numbers yet, right? So add, what was it, $57 add that to your difference there. Does that get us to the 230 that we're looking for?

Matthias Miller  1:31:28
Oh, to the two Well, let's, let's do this. Let's do the, let's do the,

Speaker 2  1:31:32
let's do the next day down so sons on the doll trade of,

Matthias Miller  1:31:38
I mean, is this? This is what you're looking for? Really, really, 5601 which is about right, but doesn't sound exactly right.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:47
Not exactly right. I don't think well,

Matthias Miller  1:31:55
but that's not the No, it

Unknown Speaker  1:31:57
wasn't there. Oh, let's see 5742 on the 11 four. That's the amount 57 anyway, that might just be a rabbit hole too.

Matthias Miller  1:32:16
I don't know I got I got it I can. I got an hour at one. One, yeah, one o'clock.

Speaker 3  1:32:26
We're gonna go out to some, some coffee shop. Okay, I'm not sure how much you don't have any time later, because then I don't think we'll have too much.

Matthias Miller  1:32:38
Exactly, no, I my day is like it's gone after unless you guys want to work late.

Speaker 3  1:32:48
Um, what if we do 130 to two instead of one to two? Maybe that, that would give us a 130 to have an hour at

Matthias Miller  1:32:58
one, an hour at one. I could do one. I could do 130 to two.

Speaker 3  1:33:01
What do you think, too? I mean, I think we could, yeah, okay, let's do 130 to two.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:11
I need to be doing one at three. Yeah, give

Unknown Speaker  1:33:17
us a lot of time. We got, like,

Speaker 3  1:33:20
to have a lot of other things with okay? Or do you, no, I don't good well, we'll regroup at 130 and we expect you to have some brainstorm on how to fix this easily by then. Or we're, we're optimistic and hopeful,

Matthias Miller  1:33:39
but that's that's based on the assumption I'm going to be sitting around thinking about this, which unfortunately is very unlikely to be true. Most. Most of these ahas happen over a 24 hour, 24 to 48 hour period. So that's the sad thing.

Speaker 2  1:33:54
You have to include a shower Exactly.

Matthias Miller  1:33:58
They don't have any of the office here, so kind of out of luck.

Speaker 3  1:34:04
Good, okay, we'll see what we can do until then and go from there. All right, we good. Thank you. Yep, thanks. Bye.
