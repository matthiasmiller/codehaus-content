Okay, Ben. Yeah. I'm seeing you're typing on Dialpad, but now I don't think anybody's gonna show up. But I thought I'd give it a few more minutes. Just do you have a sense of how much we can accomplish without Matthias?

Speaker 2  11:20
I don't usually March sends over kind of like an agenda. And if he doesn't have one, then the highest will. And yeah, I haven't seen. All right.

Speaker 1  11:31
It might be that they assumed that we wouldn't be meeting. I don't know what Matthias has been communicating. Exactly. So,

Speaker 2  11:38
you know, I'd sent Drew and Marquis email earlier this morning. Okay. Saying that his schedule is fairly uncertain for the rest of the week. And then it was a couple of hours later that you sent out your email. But they hadn't responded to that when either so. Okay. I'm sure.

Speaker 1  12:02
Well, I say we consider it canceled. And then if they want to do Monday, we can regroup.

Unknown Speaker  12:08
Hmm, okay. Yeah, prepared word.

Unknown Speaker  12:11
Sounds like plan to me. I will see you later.

Unknown Speaker  12:14
All right, sounds good. See you.

Unknown Speaker  12:16
Bye. Bye.
