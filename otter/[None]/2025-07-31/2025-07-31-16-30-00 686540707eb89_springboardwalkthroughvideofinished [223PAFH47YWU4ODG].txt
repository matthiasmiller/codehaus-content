Hey guys, Justin here from funnel bandits. In this video, I walk you through how to use the springboard strategy custom planner. This tool helps you land one new client per day without posting content or doing any sales calls or any of that nonsense. So if you're not familiar with this strategy, go back and review the one page that you bought this tool from. This video focuses purely on how to use the planner. So the first thing you're going to do is click the Start button. You'll be asked for your name, your current monthly revenue and your 60 day goal. For example, if you're currently making $10,000 a month and want to reach $50,000 a month, enter those numbers. Next you'll

input your ad budget. We recommend starting with $10 starting with $10 a day, just enough to test and get early traction. If you can afford more, for example, $50 a day, you'll see results faster. Enter whatever amount you're comfortable starting with, then you want to enter the price of your offer. If you have one main offer, just enter that price if you sell multiple products or services, estimate your lifetime customer value. For example, if your core offer is priced at $3,000 the tool estimate your cost per acquisition at $150 with a $300 ad budget, in your first month, you could land around two clients, which would generate approximately $6,000 in revenue in the reach $50,000 a month, 17 clients at $3,000 each, you'd need to reinvest around 43% of your revenue into ads, which comes out to about $2,550

next, describe your ideal client. Be specific, for example, online coaches, making $20,000 a month, working 40 hour weeks, who hate sales calls and want more time freedom. Maybe they've tried running ads to a webinar, but didn't get results. If this works for them, they could cut their work week down to 10 hours.

Now we map out your process, the steps you use to get clients results. This isn't about what you're doing in your own business, but the process you teach or implement for others. For example, you run an ad on Facebook, offer a lead magnet, follow it with a $10 front end offer, and then close the sale in Messenger. Next, we dig into what makes your method unique. Maybe the $10 offer is a 20 minute over the shoulder case study on how a client went from a to b. The tool will help you build your unique method one pager. The format we use when writing one pagers is who it's for. For example, coaches earning $20,000 a month, who are tired of long hours and sales calls, who it's not for. For example, those without a proven offer. Why your method works, step by step, breakdown of your method results or proof from clients or your own results, a clear call to action to purchase your AI tool. This is what you'll send traffic to. It leads people into your Springboard tool and then toward your core offer. Use the plan it gives you to write your own one pager. The tool will not write it for you. That's something we do for clients at funnel bandits. Next you'll define what your tool actually does for leads. For example, you could write the ads. Tell the user what to make the $10.00 training about generate headlines. The planner will also create your three ad scripts, a 62nd new method video for cold traffic, a case study ad that retargets viewers of the first video, a direct message ad that sends people to your one pager. If you're using a $10 a day ad budget, we suggest putting $5 into the first video and $2.50 each into the other two. You can tweak the scripts to match your voice or real client stories. The first video is the only one you'll need to record, and something simple, like a whiteboard or talking head style video works great at the end, the planner gives you a complete strategy summary. This includes your 60 day feasibility plan, the ad scripts, your one pager outline, and your tool concept. So if you don't have time to build all of this yourself, we can do it for you. We offer a 28 day trial where we set everything up help you get results and then discuss the option to work together long term, the trial costs less than most people's monthly car payment. If you're interested, just message Caleb using Caleb using the link at the end of the tool or below this video. And if you have any questions, just ask inside the tool, it will guide you step by step you.
